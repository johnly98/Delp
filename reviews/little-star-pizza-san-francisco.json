This special gem is surprisingly not too crowded on the weekdays (can't speak for weekends); my boyfriend and I walked in around 7:00pm on a Wednesday night and got seated right away.\n\nLocation: Divisadero Street between Fulton and McAllister. It's a cute, vibrant street with plenty of restaurants and cafes. We got lucky with a parking spot around the corner on Fulton Street.\n\nAtmosphere: Dimly lit but with enough lighting to see the menu. I think it would be a great date spot, if you don't mind sharing food!\n\nFood: This is where all the place gets all the stars! The pizza is UNBEATABLE and they offer deep dish crust or thin crust. I've wanted to relive my Chicago deep dish memories for so long, but so few places outside of the area can do it well. Lo and behold, this place is not one of those few! My boyfriend and I shared the 9\" deep dish pizza with half margherita plus and half little star. The portion was just enough for the both of us -- the 9\" has 6 slices and I left feeling pretty full but didn't feel like I had to stuff myself to finish it. It is quite a bit of a wait for the deep dish (~20 mins), but I assure you it is worth it. The crust is made of cornmeal, so it added a really nice texture that had the perfect amount of crisp and allowed us to eat the pizza cleanly with a fork and knife! (It was pretty easy to cut through the crust) I prefer pizzas with more tomato sauce and this did the trick -- it was also really flavorful with the garlic, but it also wasn't soggy. The little star was my favorite of the two, because it had ricotta cheese and spinach -- one of my favorite combinations in pizza. But the margherita was also a solid choice. I'd highly recommend both!", "author": "Lillian T."}

I got held to my statement, so Little Star Pizza it was.\n\nWe got the half and half deep dish-- half old school with pepperoni, olives, and onions, and half little star, which is a combo with spinach and mushrooms.\n\nIt arrived piping hot. The top was smothered in fresh-tasting diced and sorta wilted tomatoes, which made it a bit hard to tell the difference between the two flavors. I liked the cheese on this-- not that pungent, but perfectly stringy and made you feel like they were using real ingredients. The dough was super soft and the cornmeal crust was a nice change of scenery-- a bit crunchy for my tastes, with slight grittiness from the cornmeal. A 9\" would be sufficient for two moderately hungry people.\n\nAs with all other foods, I tend to eat my layers separately so I can actually taste the ingredients. All were high quality. There was a decent amount of toppings on this. A 3.75/5 for me.", "author": "Nicole H."}

The pizza travels great and came super quickly (thanks Caviar).\n\nThe pizza was great, my only complaint is that the BBQ chicken pizza crust got SO hard I thought I'd lose a tooth. But on the other hand, the deep dish was one of the tastiest I've had in a long time, so I can say it was definitely worth it. It had the perfect amount of sauce (sometimes deep dish has too much), and the crust was the smallest bit crispy on the bottom, but just doughy/squishy enough to be super satisfying texture-wise. Overall, amazing. \n\nAdditionally, I would like to point out that the ranch here is bomb.com. Everything you could want and more: plentiful, runny and fresh. I'd come back just for the ranch.", "author": "Jamie J."}

The dough for the thin crust is the same as what is used for the deep dish, so it has the same unique, delicious taste. I especially recommend the thin crust because instead of feeling stuffed after one slice (like for the deep dish), you can keep eating more slices. The crust also has a nice crunch to it.\n\nFor appetizers, I highly recommend the chicken wings! I like that they are a dry rub, so there is no extra sauce to get all over your face.

My bf and I had to take half of the pizza to go, so if it's only two people, a small is more than enough. \n\nNot too many places in SF that do deep dish but this place has got it right.

I don't like deep dish pizza, too heavy and cracker like crust. I really don't understand this pizza style.\nAs for thin crust, it was just mediocre.\n\nOk the goods.. you can get added to the waitlist from restaurant's website, loved it!

We ordered Deep Dish BBQ Chicken and a Thin Crust Italian Combo.  I usually like thick crust but the crust was hard and I usually never leave a pizza crust, but could not really eat it.

I was impressed with the kale - it was fresh and crunchy and flavorful as well as not overly salty. It was a good prelude to the pizza itself. I usually prefer thin crust to deep dish pizzas as I find many deep dishes to be too oily as well as over saturated with sauce. Neither was applicable to Little Star's pizza as it was honestly one of the tastiest pizzas I have ever had in the Bay Area.

This is some of my favorite pizza in SF. It's deep dish but the cornmeal crust really sets it apart, its crunchy on the outside and soft inside and really really good. I like to order it with meatballs (delicious) and/or ricotta (small dollops on each slice so don't expect it to melt into the pizza like ricotta often does). The wings are pretty good although fairly spicy and the salads and other items are alright. But the real star (no pun intended) here is the pizza so definitely order that. They do a good job of packaging it for take out and delivery so it stays hot and doesn't get soggy which is an added plus. Prices are perhaps slightly higher than other pizza joints but each slice is pretty filling and the ingredient quality seems high. Definitely 5 stars from me.", "author": "Seema U."}

This place is perpetually mobbed, so I got a little star (spinach blended with ricotta, feta, mushroom, onion, and fresh garlic) pizza to go. By the time I could dig into it, it was already cold, yet somehow this didn't dampen my enjoyment a bit. I just heated it up in the microwave, and even the portions I couldn't finish made for a great lunch the following day. \n\nMmmm, that crust.

Was stoked to see that they had happy hour food and drink specials until 6:30p. Woot woot! \n\nWe started our meal with some appetizers off of the weekday happy hour menu. The caprese salad was your typical sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, basil chiffonade, and olive oil and balsamic vinegar--delicious and definitely didn't disappoint. I ordered one order of the roasted kale then snuck in a second order before happy hour was up because it was THAT GOOD. I highly recommend it. You simply can't go wrong with big pieces of kale topped with sprinkle of Parmesan and feta, roasted to perfection and topped with fresh lemon wedge for you to finish off at your table. \n\nFor our meal, we had the portobello pie deep dish pizza with tomato sauce. Crust was crispy and not crazy thick which I love because then you can really taste the toppings instead of every bite just being a mouthful of doughy crust. The ratio or crust to sauce to toppings and cheese was perfection! Sauce was very balanced between tart and sweet. Getting the big chunks of flavorful portobello was the best though. I normally like sausage or some type of meat on my pizza but this really didn't need it. Pizza also came out piping hot which made me really happy because last time I had deep dish pizza across town at another pizza place, my pie came out cold and crust was doughy like it wasn't fully cooked through. No such nonsense at Little Star! No wonder these guys have a 4.5 stars rating out of over 2500 Yelp reviews! \n\nFor those of you with kiddos, little ones 10 and under get a free mini pizza during happy hour with order of a regular pizza for the grown ups. What a deal, right? Just make sure they don't sit you close to the door because as soon as anyone comes in, a bunch of cold air blows in and can be unpleasant when the temp gets below 60 outside.", "author": "Betty R."}

We put our name down and the hostess told us we could pre-order a deep dish while we wait because deep dish can take up to 30+ mins to make. How convenient! They also have thin crust option available for some topping choices. We decided on their small size classic deep dish and ordered buffalo wings as an appetizer. I highly recommend the trying the deep dish as the filling of the deep dish outweighs the crust by a LOT, which is why I think a lot of people like this place because you definitely get bang for your buck. The buffalo wings were really good too because they weren't as oily and saucy as most places do it.

Pretty small restaurant with a largely forgettable design, but plenty of seating. I came mostly for their deep dish pizza, and if you're planning to do the same, keep in mind that it's a 20-30 minute wait. Our interaction with our waitress was very brief, but she was nice-- gave us space when we asked for more time to decide, reminded us of the option to split the flavors, and was all smiles.\n\nI shared a small deep dish, half Classic and half Pollo ($1 extra charge for getting two different types) with my friend. I'd say we're pretty capable eaters, and the small was enough to make us super full! Needless to say, it was great. The cheese was chewy and stretchy, there's chunky tomato, and the crust is just right (firm enough to hold the toppings and not fall apart, but not hard and tough to eat). I also like how the edge of the crust is seasoned. If you're a pizza lover, it'd be hard to go wrong with this place! Would definitely recommend.", "author": "Vincent L."}

Despite that first trip not being so memorable, I came by again last night and LOVED IT. \n\nI honestly wasn't in the mood for pizza on a Sunday night, but my options were limited at 9pm.  A quick phone call confirmed that they took orders until closing at 9:30 so off we went! The place was pretty empty by that time, but service was still spectacular. It wasn't too hard to get anyone's attention and we quickly placed an order for a small (9\" with 6 slices) Classic deep dish. The pizza smelled amazing, and more importantly, tasted amazing! The sauce smelled/tasted meaty and inviting. There were adequate amounts of meat/mushroom/cheese spread throughout, and the crust was perfectly crunchy and unburned. A small seems perfect to share for two people, my only concern was the uneven cutting... we had one tiny baby slice!   Dinner came out to just over $20 which really isn't bad for tasty deep dish! \n\nJust some other info: Deep dish pizzas typically take about 30 minutes to cook so don't come starving! Thin crust is also available, but come on, you can get that anywhere else. There's a good amount of 2 or 4 person tables available, I didn't see too many tables bigger than that but I'm sure stuff can be moved around.

Happy hour ran all night on a Monday so it's a good time to take advantage of the limited happy hour menu if you come in a little later in the evening. \n\nAn order of wings and a small pizza with a couple drinks was perfect to share. I'm afraid if we went with the deep dish we wouldn't have been able to finish everything and ended up in a food coma! I do recommend getting the large and the deep dish if you want to take home some leftovers otherwise the small is good for two!", "author": "Shane T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-05", "description": "3.5 stars. While the majority of patrons come here for their deep dish pizza, I tried one of their thin crust called WHITE PIE (garlic infused olive oil base, mozzarella, roasted zucchini, fresh tomatoes, feta, $26 for a large). The crust was a bit too hard to chew for my taste, and it probably didn't help that just one day before I had pizza at Il Casaro in North Beach. \n\nOur table also ordered deep dish (Classic, $26), I liked the rich flavor - but one piece and I'm done. \n\nI forgot to mention - fantastic garlic cheese bread as a starter. While Il Casaro remains my top spot for pizza in SF, Little Star is a great little place in the Divis corridor.", "author": "Sebastian F."}

Doesn't help that Little Star isn't exactly near any real parking, which was a serious deterrent from heading here. But having stayed at a friend's place nearby and noticing it was within easy walking distance, decision finally made to come through!\n\nKept it simple and ordered a Classic deep dish. Definitely some of the best deep dish pizza I've had. Giordano's does have me favoring a lot of cheese in my pie, but Little Star's deep dish has the perfect blend of cheese and sauce that puts it over the top (and kinda why I'm not as high on Zachary's as others are). Plus fresh cornmeal crust on any deep dish pizza is EASILY the best kind of crust you can have on this kinda pie.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed the pizza here, definitely glad I finally took the time to come here.", "author": "Alexander Y."}

And the ooey gooey cheese...so good. \nCustomer service is also pretty good. The second time I had Little Star, I ordered for pick up and they accidentally got only half my order correct. I didn't want to wait for them to make another pie so they offered me a discount or a gift card for my next visit. I took the discount and the manager gave me a little more than 50% off. \n\nAnd...I prefer it over the famous Tony's.

We order the pepperoni and onion & the meatball and onion.\nThe meatball has a pile of herbed ricotta on top on each large slice. The cheese base is the perfect pull apart texture, with lots of cheese. The sauce has big chunks of juicy tomato's that add just the right amount of sweet and acidic and can cut through the cheese and rich crust. Meatballs are flavorful and savory.

Both were pretty standard, nothing too special. The pizza though was delicious! We were able to do half-half and ended up ordering the \"White\" and \"Little Star\". The pizza was well balanced, but the star was the crust - provided great texture in contrast to the cheese! We also ordered the warm brownie to share for dessert, but it was only so-so and I probably wouldn't get it again. \n\nOverall, my pizza craving was definitely satisfied and this is a great go-to place if you are a deep dish lover!

Neither wet crust nor a mouthful of sauce appeals to me.\nHowever, the cornmeal crust on this deep dish pizza is delightfully crunchy and substantially thick enough to support the weight of the filling. \nInstead of a heavy tomato sauce, the interior was stuffed with spinach and mushrooms. There was so much spinach that I think they must have saut\u00e9ed and wilted down the leaves first before mixing it into the creamy ricotta & feta. \nAlso, it was so incredibly cheesy that the gooey strings just kept on stretching. \nSince the tomato sauce sits on top of the cheesy filling, the crust does not absorb the moisture from the sauce. The order of the toppings must be the reason why their pizzas come out solid and crunchy instead of wet and soggy.\n\n$12.50 Spicy Chicken Wings - pound of wings with baby carrots and blue cheese dressing:\nThese wings seemed to be baked with a spice rub, as opposed to fried. The result is considerably less messy than most chicken wings. It had quite a bit of heat and spicy kick to it, which I attempted to quell with the baby carrots. I didn't use too much of the blue cheese dressing since the flavor is too sharp for my preferences. \n\nThe pizzas range from about $20-$30. Deep dish pizzas come in 9\" & 12.\" Thin crust pizzas come in 12\" and 16.\" There are also plain cheese pizzas, and you can basically build your own by adding toppings for ~$2-$3 for each topping. \nOur server informed us that deep dishes here typically take about 25 minutes, which isn't too bad compared to baking times for most deep dish pizzas. \nApparently, the wait times during weekend peak dining times can be rough. For lazy people like me, I'd rather opt for delivery.", "author": "Joy W."}

I realized that I am not a deep dish kind of gal. I literally feel like Im just eating tomatoes on top of bread and cant even taste the fixings. Seven of us split two pizzas, wings, and the garlic bread. The cool thing about this place is that while you are waiting, they will place your order and they will time it so when you finally get seated, the pizza should come out fairly shortly after. That is efficiency at its finest but likely you will be waiting 45 minutes on a weekend night. There are bars around while you wait. Parking can be tough but you just gotta search for days.\n\nClassic - Sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bells. Like I said before, with all the sauce, I didnt even taste the toppings. \nLittle Star - Spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, garlic. I could see the spinach and definitely tasted the feta but meh.\nChicken Wings- These tasted weird. They were a bit spicy and something about it...couldnt put my finger on it but something was off....the skin tasted fake? I derno\nGarlic bread- This was pretty much cheese bread.

Fortunately after walking in it was a very intimate, cozy experience with clean bathrooms, kind servers, delicious food and reasonable prices. $5 appetizers on the weekdays. We had a classic deep dish, food wait was just long enough to let us chat but not so long that we were like wtf. Everybody there was comfortable and happy and the whole vibe was amazing. The pizza was DELICIOUS. I'm super picky about my food since I am an experienced cook and this pie was worth every dollar. Which was priced at $29 for a large deep dish. Which fed 3 people til full with an appetizer. I see complaints about price but honestly you get what you pay for. Quality costs and I am grateful for what they do here. Don't be cheap guys pay that extra few bucks for good food. The only part I would say is not good about this place is the outside presentation. It looks closed off and dark.

Little Star deep dish pizza is not like Chicago deep dish pizza. Pizza is very much a subjective thing, so I'll tell you what my preferences are so you can compare. My favorite deep dish place in Chicago is Pequods. Gino's East, Giordano's, Uno's etc., none of those rival Pequods to me. Why do I like Pequods? Because of the caramelized crust, because of the huge and generous sausage and pepperoni toppings, and the way that when they serve it, the cheese is just oozing from each slice. \n\nWhy don't I like Little Star as much? Because this pizza feels like a healthy version of deep dish to me. That might sound weird, but this pizza has a higher concentration of tomatoes to cheese than any deep dish pizza I've ever had in Chicago. It just tastes way too tomatoey for me. The cheese doesn't have that super ooey gooey thing going on here. The toppings aren't as decadent and bursting from the pizza. And I'm not a huge fan of that cornmeal crust.", "author": "Lin Z."}

When the roommate said he was craving pizza, I suggested Little star. Finally, I get to try their pizza! I know they're known for their deep dish, but I wasn't in a deep dish kind mood, so we stuck to their thin crust pizzas. We got take out of the following:\n\nSpicy chicken wings ($11.50) - Pound of wings served with baby carrots & blue cheese dressing. I was expecting the usual buffalo wings, but I was pleasantly surprised. The wings were juicy, crunchy and had a nice little kick. \n\nHalf White pie & half Pesto chicken ($19.50 for a small 12\") - I couldn't decide which pizza I wanted, so I went for the half and half. The White pie ($19.25 for a small 12\") came with a garlic infused olive oil base, roasted zucchini, fresh tomatoes & feta. The Pesto chicken ($19.50 for a small 12\") came with a pesto base, roasted chicken, roasted red peppers, mushrooms & onions. Being the carnivore that I am, I was surprised that I liked the White pie the best. The zucchini,  tomatoes and feta made it very simple and delicious. And I loved the garlic olive oil base. I enjoyed the Chicken pesto as well. Who can go wrong with chicken and pesto sauce?! But I could have done w/o the roasted red peppers. I felt like the pesto, chicken, mushrooms & onions already made it a good slice. The peppers seemed out of place.\n\nMeateor ($19.50 for a small 19\") - Sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms & onions. This was the roommate's pizza. He loves meat pizzas so this was perfect for him! I love a good pepperoni & mushroom pizza, so I'm glad he picked this one so I could have a slice! I loved the quality of the toppings and pizza, but this one suffered since I got it for take out. It wasn't hot and melty like it should have been.

We waited about 10 minutes to get a table, but were allowed to place our order ahead of time. Upon being seated, we ordered an appetizer of spicy wings (only deep dishes can be pre-ordered). Overall, service was speedy and both our appetizer and pizza came out at appropriate times.\n\nThe wings were pretty special--on a totally different level than the Popeyes a couple blocks down the street. They were moderately crisp without being overly drenched in oil which I liked. They were, on the other hand, pretty spicy in a peppery kind of way.\n\nNow, for the pizza. We ordered the Mediterranean Chicken which had chicken breast, artichoke hearts, red bells, green olives, onions, and feta cheese. A stray away from the typical meat lovers Chicago style pizza, but still a deep dish and just as savory. The acidity from the artichoke and olives blended perfectly with the seasoned chicken and marinara. The pizza tasted really special aside from the fact that it was a deep dish. The crunchy yet buttery crust was also really unique and appealing.\n\nI must still be mesmerized by my meal from last night, but I can't yet say whether Little Star trumps Zachary's.. They both have great things going for them and I feel that even though both establishments serve deep dish pizzas, they are unique in their own ways that it'd be unfair to compare the two.

The highlight came with the deep dish pan pizza. We got the plain cheese pan pizza and I have never been so delighted by a plain pizza. At first I thought they had made a mistake and forgotten to add cheese when, in fact, they had layered the chunky tomato sauce (which was more a thick chutney-style sauce full of large pieces of tomato) over the cheese. \nThis was a game-changer! We all agreed that the pan pizza reigned supreme and we gobbled it down in minutes. I swear I blacked out to an empty pizza box. \n\nThe salad we ordered was also pretty freakin' surprising! It could not have been more vibrant, with cherry tomato slices, nuts, fabulous greens, etc. This. Salad. Was.

Little Star PIzza doesn't require any marketing, I suppose. The recommendation of many San Franciscans as I've come to learn, had left me with little choice but to try this place. While parking in this neighborhood may not be easy, consider parking a few blocks down or around. Be sure to bring your friends, but not your bosses. \n\nThe Caprese Salad: You'll find that the basil in this salad over powers much of the rest, as the other ingredients are more for texture than taste. The Caprese ends up being a good start for those who want a little bite rather than leafy greens. It isn't too oily as well, which I absolutely loved about this appetizer. \n\nThe deep dish Mediterranean Chicken: Served in the famed Chicago deep dish style that may resemble Zachary's across town or in Berkeley, you'll find that this pizza pie will fill you up and more. Being good enough for two to three hungry guys the pie took a while to arrive to our table during a busy pre-dinner hour. You'll note the pie is filled with sauce that may ooze from your mouth as you try to fork and knife your way through it. The bread on the pizza pie isn't too thick, and so that leaves plenty of room for all the chicken, artichoke hearts and onions. \n\nWhile I may have left with bad breath, I can safely say my stomach was given some comfort food. Little Star Pizza is a gem, and among all the pizza joints in Bay Area this one sticks out. You can tell they want to stick to a small menu because they focus on a craft, and that is to make really amazing pizzas.", "author": "Mohib Q."}

But, today we got a large and obviously had some slices leftover to take home. \n\nWe've also tried the mixed greens salad in the past and it's pretty standard. Their wings are decent. You really can't go wrong with their deep dish though. I love their sauce and the ingredients are fresh every time. Always a winner in our book! As far as drinks are concerned, the bf usually gets an Arrogant Bastard beer and recently I tried the Hey Kool-Aid champagne cocktail and it was alright.\n\nParking can be difficult. It takes us on average 20-30 mins to find parking. The longest we've ever had to wait was 30 mins. Don't be dissuaded by the long wait for a table. I feel like some people are impatient once they hear that they have to wait for an hour or longer and they just walk away. That just gives others the chance to get seated faster. We were once told that the wait for a table for 2 was going to be an hour and 15 mins. But, they texted us within 30 mins and a table had opened up for us. So, don't give up right away.\n\nI mean, what else is there left to say that hasn't already been said? This place is great and their deep dish is amazing, granted I haven't had deep dish anywhere else. But, I don't mind staying loyal to this place.

The space was small and quaint, giving it a cozy feeling especially with the dimmed lighting. I ordered the Mixed Salad and Mediterranean Chicken Deep Dish. In hindsight I would've completely skipped the Mixed Salad since the deep dish is where it's at! The cheese was perfectly ooey-gooey and not greasy like other deep dish pizzas from my past.

Luckily there was no line at all and maybe a handful of diners at the tall tables near the bar. \n\nI'm gonna start by saying that I've never had a deep dish pizza before and one of my good friends told me that this may possibly be the best place to get some in sf.\n\nThe 4 of us were seated at one of the tables on the left side if the restaurant. The artwork here is pretty unique and the dim lighting puts a relaxing/romantic ambience on the dining experience (not a bad place for dates). The bad part about this is that it's difficult to take a good picture.\n\nOur waitress was very attentive and always came by to make sure everything was okay. We ended up ordering the classic and Mediterranean chicken deep dish pizza to share (both small); our waitress informed us that a small pizza is 6 slices and feeds about 2 people. Honestly, I can eat quite a lot and surprisingly, 3 slices filled me up! Anyways, after ordering the deep dishes, our waitress told us that the pizzas would take about 30 or 35 minutes to cook so we decided to order some garlic bread so we wouldn't starve. \n\nThe garlic bread came out in about 5 minutes and was basically a mini pizza. It was warm, fluffy, cheesy goodness that disappeared as soon as it came. The pizza arrived just on time passing a little over 30 minutes and we began to dig in.\n\nDon't be embarrassed to take advantage of the forks and knives to avoid getting your hands messy with the pizza stuffings. The best of this particular pizza has got to be the crust; it is literally the best pizza crust ice ever had, it had this amazing crunch and wasn't too hard to bite through. The ingredients were all super fresh and meshed well with the flavors we ordered.\n\nBy the time we finished, there was a line going through the door but we weren't rushed whatsoever. In fact, or waitress helped refill our water pitcher and boxed the rest of the pizza for us. \n\nOverall, the service at Little Star is superb and the deep dish pizzas are amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-17", "description": "I used to fear deep dish because the crust has classically been my least favorite part of the pizza and a bad tomato sauce could also ruin everything.  Perhaps it had to do with growing up on Domino's deliveries and thinking that was how all crust was created.  I always left it behind and never second guessed my approach, so the thought of deep dish was understandably troubling when the main composition of the pizza was more of the thing I detest.\n\nSo my first time at Little Star (circa 2008), 3 of us met for dinner and I reluctantly agreed to share a deep dish if we could also get a thin crust pizza (with pesto, b/c why subject myself to too much of a scary thing?).  Well that thin crust sure was tasty and just how I like my pizza....but that deep dish! whoa! I must admit I'd never had deep dish before, so I didn't really know what to expect, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  The heartiness of the toppings met with the crispiness of the crust was actually quite delicious.  There is just something about that cornmeal crust that's buttery and crispy and nothing like the bland over-inflated crust of my childhood.  \n\nI was an infrequent diner at Little Star until I moved to an apartment a block away.  That's when everything changed.  Well, and my deep dish consumption increased.  Every time I go I order a deep dish Little Star and add sausage.  I just can't bring myself to try something else because the Little Star is just so perfect (I mean it is their namesake, no?).  Many a night I ordered a small deep dish to go, would trudge the 2 block roundtrip in the bitter San Francisco  wind and return home with my bounty.  4 slices for dinner, 2 for lunch the next day.  Mmmm.  Now that's if you're a hearty eater, like me...for many only 2 slices suffice to fill up.  Plus you shouldn't overlook sides and apps here.  The garlic cheesy bread satisfies the niche of returning me to my childhood favorite, the kale is delicious yet I tell myself it's healthy so it's all good, the salad (even a small) is piled high.  Plus they've often got a nice mix of lesser known beers on tap.\n\nAlas I no longer live next door so my cravings for Little Star oft go unanswered.  So brave the elements, try to avoid the crowds, and take a chance on their deep dish...it's my favorite in the entire city.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

We ordered the Crispy Kale ($5), Spicy Chicken Wings ($9), and BYO Deep Dish Pizza: small Cheese ($14) with Sausages ($2.75) and Feta ($1.85). To begin with the appetizers, the kale completely exceeded my expectations. It was baked with parmesan cheese on top, which was so delicious! A little bit of veggies to balance out your meal is always nice as well. For the wings, they were tiny but came in plenty. The flavor was okay, but still pretty good with the ranch dressing as a good snack before the main course. I was very excited for the pizza and it was just as great as I remembered it. It is comparable to the ones I've had in Chicago and is super filling. Never underestimate a deep dish pizza with all the fillings inside of it! I didn't taste so much of the feta, but still good.

We went for the classic pizza, and it was so amazing and delicious- and I loved the cornbread crust as that was something I have never had before!   My only issue was that there were a little too many tomatoes on top- so it felt like the tomatoes and sauce overpowered the rest of the taste.

You can order deep dish or thin crust. My friend and I decided to go with the deep dish. We got the special that day, BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple and cilantro on top. The crust was very crunchy and didn't have the soft inside I was expecting. It was a more crunchy and dry crust. We were informed that it would take 30 minutes to come out so we also ordered a small mixed salad to share. The salad was fresh with just enough dressing which was nice. The salad and 9'' pizza was perfect to share between 2 people coming out to about $20/person. Overall, the food and service was good, but it didn't stand out to me.", "author": "Christie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-04", "description": "Not that this place needs any more glowing reviews (I mean, they only have 2,300+ reviews!)... but I wanted to throw my two cents in since I feel very strongly about pizza. As someone who recently moved from Chicago, I'm supposed to \"know\" what good \"deep dish\" is. Alright, sure I do. But, I'll admit... *whispers* I actually prefer California-style or New York-style pizza. *ahem* Anyway, having said that, my boyfriend and I went in the other night to Little Star. Knowing I'm not wild about deep dish (I'm an Angeleno), my boyfriend (who is a native Chicagoan) was happy to know I was pleased with Little Star. \n\nFirst off, for deep dish pizza, this met the requirement of being hearty. Yet Little Star managed to pull off the near-impossible(!): hearty but not disgustingly heavy. Let me break this down... the crust was slightly buttery, slightly golden, but not drenched in butter like the \"typical\" deep dish pizzas of Chicago. (I mean, those are downright pies -- which, again, many Chicagoans love but I do not.) Secondly, the deep dish (we ordered the classic) filling had the right proportions of cheese, tomato sauce, sausage, onion, and bell pepper. In other words, there wasn't one ingredient (technically, they aren't \"toppings\" since this isn't CA or NY style) that dominated. My boyfriend and I split a small 9\" pizza (six slices). We wound up eating 3 slices each which - for deep dish pizza - sounds like quite the feat, but again, this was light enough where we needed to eat all three to be full. Personally, I think this is a good thing. I'll say it once more... Little Star managed to do the impossible: eat lots of deep dish without feeling gross afterward.\n\nIn terms of service, Little Star also delivered! No, not deliver pizza (*womp womp* insert bad joke). Little Star provided all-star service! Upon entering, the hostess took my cell number and said we'd be texted when our table was ready (she quoted us 35 minutes... it took about 25 that night). She was friendly and sat us at the bar (though I do wish she would've let us know we'd be taking seats at the bar). Our server was also the restaurant's bartender. She was friendly and checked in on us at all the right times. I didn't feel like she was lurking or un-attentive. I also ordered a glass of sauvignon blanc which went well with the pizza. The restaurant itself has no cohesive decorative theme. In fact, it's unclassifiable. It's modern yet vintage and then there are relics of random nostalgic toys and figurines hanging on shelves (especially near the bar area). I couldn't make sense of it, but somehow, this mishmash of design didn't distract from the experience. Lastly, this place can get pretty loud (I mean us millennials can't shut up even with all our smart phones). I wouldn't suggest bringing your folks visiting town here. Unless they thrive off high decibels and occasional bursts of screams, shouts, and laughter, they shouldn't dine here. Save Little Star for your friends' night out or (like in my case) a meal with your boo.\n\nAaaand finally, while they are known for their deep dish, I'd like to come back to try their thin crust (or as my Chicago-born boyfriend jokes, \"California and New York flatbreads\") (Psh!). We made a deal: I tried the deep dish for him, he needs to try the thin crust for me. This is what happens when a Southern Californian and a Midwesterner are in a relationship.", "author": "James Z."}

It's a very small place, with dim lighting, both a great place for a date or coming with friends. \n\nThe wait was a little less than 30 minutes during dinner time, but fortunately we were able to get some wine and beer while we waited. The ros\u00e9 was decent priced and very light and tasty. We also got a dark beer suggested by the bartender since they didn't have the one on the menu, and it was just as good. Unfortunately, I forgot the name, but it was a dark, light-tasting beer. It went great with the hot wings we ordered as an appetizer.\n\nHowever, the star of the night was definitely the classic deep dish pizza. The ingredients tasted fresh and the tomatoes were chunky and sweet but not overbearing. All the ingredients harmonized well together. Although the wait for the pizza itself was a little long, it was definitely worth it. \n\nThe service was friendly and helpful.

The whole trip was pretty whirlwind and we really just needed food at this point. I had gone on a walk while my husband napped, but nothing was really catching my eye, so we headed out in the opposite direction for dinner and stumbled across this little joint. I can't wait to come back! \n\nWe started with the mixed salad for three of us and it was perfect. I honestly could have just eaten that whole bowl of salad and been happy. After a weekend of vacation and celebrations, some greens were necessary. But when the pizza came, I knew that there was no way to come here for salad only. Seriously. We got the little star pizza, because how could we resist on our first visit? It only seemed right. The spinach and feta were creamy and delicious, as were the mushrooms. I'm not the hugest fan of deep dish pizza, but this was pretty amazing. I think I enjoyed this more than the deep dish pizza I had while visiting Chicago.

I didn't see a whole lot of parking on the street so that could be an issue for anybody not walking.  It took a couple of minutes before anybody noticed us at the door.  There were a lot of people here and at the bar.  The lighting gradually got darker was we approached the back where our table was.  There were candles at each table so at least there was some kind of lighting to read the menu. \n\nOur waiter told us a 9 inch pizza would be enough for two people and if it were two hungry people, then an appetizer would be enough in addition to the 9 inch deep dish pizza.  We ordered two Blue Paddle Pilsner ($4.75 each), the Spicy Chicken Wings ($11), and a 9 inch pizza that had half with the Mediterranean Chicken ($19.75 for 9 inch and $25.50 for 12 inch) and the other half with the Classic ($19.50 for 9 inch and $25 for 12 inch).  We felt that should be enough for both of us. \n\nThe Spicy Chicken Wings came out first and there were 10 pieces.  It was pretty tasty and good.  I didn't think it was spicy, but it was pretty hot temperature-wise.  I nearly burned my fingers trying to hold it, but I also don't have callus on my fingertips since I haven't played guitar for a long time.  The pizza came later (maybe 30 minutes after we ordered) and it looked like one topping for the whole pizza but it wasn't.  The side with the Mediterranean Chicken was good as well as the side with the Classic.  When the pizza was hot, then it tasted good; however, as it got cooler, the pizza's taste went down as well.  The Blue Paddle Pilsner was not bad and I wouldn't have known what else to order since the selection on tap was limited to beer I've never drank before. \n\nOverall, pretty good food and I would recommend trying their deep dish pizzas.", "author": "Daniel H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-13", "description": "My friends from the Golden Gate City advise that there at two Chicago style deep dish pizza restaurants that I must try if I'm in Northern CA. One is Patxi's and the other being Little Star. From the rumorville, Patxi's has the better sauce on top, while Little Star has the better crust on the bottom.\n\nTHE SLICE IS RIGHT\nI ordered the smaller 9 inch size, rather than the larger 12 inch, knowing very well that these deep dish pizzas make your stomach quite full. One half of the Classic and the other fifty percent as the Little Star. It takes about 25 minutes to prepare. The Classic contains sausage, mushrooms, onions, and green bells. The Little Star has spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, and garlic. I'll make sure to add sausage to the Little Star next time, but more on that later.\n\nI pretentiously favored the Classic, given that it had the combination of toppings that I liked. But, the side that contained the Little Star was far superior. Probably because of the salty and tangy taste of the different cheeses that the other half lacked. For not having any meat topping whatsoever, it was quite scrumptious.\n\nThe crust felt rather delicate, yet crisp with a flaky quality. Just the right amount of lightly sweet tomato sauce and seasoning. I normally don't enjoy deep dish pizzas that are super thick and bready, when it's so hard to chew because there's so much of the cornmeal crust. This however, was different. For those of you that's had the deep dish pizza crust at Masa of Echo Park in Southern CA, this version is way, way better.\n\nIf you're gonna have the Deep Dish, you gotta try the Thin Crust, right? I also heard that the Spicy Chicken Wings are worth a valiant effort, as well as the Cheesecake for dessert. Here's a link to their online website, in case you want to window shop their everyday menu. (http://www.littlestarpizza.com/index.html)\n\nTHE HIDDEN MENU\nTwo pies that are absent from the usual are - the Brass Monkey & the Abba Zabba (aka the Half Baked). Remember, how I said that I'd add sausage to the Little Star pizza? Well, that's the Brass Monkey. Almost like a lasagna, but not soggy. The Abba Zabba is any pie that's half cooked and then thrown into a TO GO box. At home, you cook it for another 25 minutes until it's ready to be served.", "author": "Chris C."}

They have a decent list of wines, listed on the chalk board at the end of the bar. Whites, Reds, Draft Beers, bottled beers. \n\nThe pizza can be deep dish a la The Windy City,  or thin crust a la Big Apple. The combos are fairly unique and have good ingredients, more for the foodie than the little league team. \n\nI had a small Greek pizza, that had sun-dried tomatoes, feta, olives, roasted garlic for $19. I helped to wash that down with a decent Malbec, normally $7.75 but I think I got the HH price of $6. Not sure if it was French or Argentina, but my guess is Argentina. Which was my small gesture of support for their loss in the World Cup finals today. \n\nThe total was about $27. I couldn't finish the small pizza, as it was more of a medium size, with a nice thin crust, good ingredients, and stringy, melted cheese, but in a thin way, not an unmanageable thick gooey mess. So I took home a few slices. \n\nParking is a b*tch on the city streets, so a lot of neighborhood types, and a few lucky parkers. The City lifted the Sunday Parking meters from activity, thank heaven those greedy city council types went too far with that one, which helps. I think it will help businesses in the City on Sundays too. \n\nLittle Star is a Little Star.

Pizza. \n\nThe atmosphere is wooden and dark, and perfect. Definitely a date spot. We sidled up to the bar, and had  their ginger champagne cocktails and wings while we waited, both were excellent.

Small: 2 people, large: 4 people.\n---\nI was out with AT and some of our friends and decided to have some pizza. And when you're in Lower Haight, of course you want to go to Little Star. One in our group was vegetarian, so we weren't sure if we would have to do a full vegetarian pizza. Lo' and behold, Little Star was able to do half-and-half. We ordered a large pizza with half Mediterranean chicken, half vegetarian. Note: small-good for 2 people; large (8 pieces)-good for 4 people.\n\nOf course we decided to order ahead, since we knew deep dish pizzas take a while to bake. The estimated time was something like 40-45 min. In the meantime, we checked out some of the shops on Divis. We arrived just before the estimate window, and were  seated anyways. Note that the interior is small, so you may not be able to get a table without waiting (unless you're lucky like we were). Upon being seated, we were asked if we were interested in the daily special, which sounded amazing. Unfortunately, we had already ordered and our pizza was probably just about ready by that point.

As for mushrooms, salami, and sausage, there was not much of any at all. I actually forgot we ordered salami until I ate the leftovers the next day in a brightly lit room and saw a piece. The cornmeal crust had good texture but wasn't impressed with the flavor. Something was missing, but we couldn't seem to pinpoint what. \n\nWe asked the waitress how big a small size was and the size she made with her hands looked like a tiny frozen personal sized pizza so we ordered a large. LIAR. Big mistake. The large wasn't as big as a normal large sized pizza elsewhere, but the small definitely wouldnt have been as small as she had shown.

I guess being a Midwesterner, I have high expectations for my deep dish pizza.  \n\nMy biggest frustration w little star is the fact that I think their \"specialty pies\" don't have the best flavor combos. They kinda seem to throw a bunch of common things together, but none of them are particularly compelling to me. Also, I always try to balance flavors (so pair a salty topping with a sweet or spicy or sour topping) and they don't really seem to do that as much here. Creating your own topping combos gets really expensive! \n\nAnyways, if you're looking for a hearty Chicago style deep dish- def check it out.

I had a number of concerns, which were all misplaced! I was worried that the mushrooms would be soggy and overpowering but they had been thinly sliced, pre-cooked, really just the perfect note. I was expecting the spinach, cheese and onions mixture to be wet and stringy but again, it was expertly balanced and my leftovers didn't show the slightest signs of sog. I contemplated what the addition of meat would bring to such a meal and the answer is not a thing. Much like the coveted Taqueria Cancun burrito, the vegetarian version is supreme. The 9\" pie provided enough food for two people and leftovers for the next day.\n\nWe also ordered a small salad, a couple glasses of wine and dulce de leche gelato, which hit the spot nicely and didn't leave a hole in our wallets.\n\nTo sum, this is the ideal little pizza place.

The think crust pizza was good - clearly fresh made with quality ingredients, and a large was enough to feed two people with a couple slices leftover. I like the creative combinations and options on the menu (e.g. zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, feta, ricotta, artichokes, etc.) - the special of the day was good, too. I was not super impressed with the actual taste/texture of the crust and found myself leaving it on the plate, where I usually look forward to finishing those last couple of bites!\n\nWe ordered the \"garlic bread\" to start, which was basically an individual-sized pizza with garlic and cheese on top. We also got the caprese salad which was quite good - fresh sliced tomatoes, mozzarella, basil and a couple different types of olives in a yummy drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. \n\nI really liked the Blue Star Wheat beer - and the bar was a great spot to hang out while we waited for our table. \n\nI would recommend this spot for a date or intimate gathering with friends.

It ain't Zachary's out in the East Bay, but its darn close and the best Chicago-style pizza that SF has to offer.  No need to go crazy with the toppings.  It all gets buried underneath a 1/2\" layer of chunky tomato sauce.  We got half of our pizza with just cheese and the other half with spinach and chicken.  There really wasn't much difference between the two halves, except for the price. \n\nTip 1:  If you are doing the deep-dish Chicago Style, try just a plain ol' cheese. \n\nTip 2:  If you are doing take-out, call at least 45 mins ahead.

The pizza we got was perfectly cooked and super good. However, in SF if I had to choose a deep dish pizza I like better, it has to be Patxi's because they have the honey that you can use with the crust.

Good pizza, as in proper & effortlessly delicious, must take a vero pizzaiolo's  time and attention.

But when you're told that a souffl\u00e9 must be ordered in anticipation, you're receiving pillowy and piping peauty (for the sake of alliteration). The deep-dish pizza was no different! Hot and ready, like me at the table.\n\nThe art shows in how wonderfully crusty the crust was. Don't know what I mean? The bottom and sides of the deep-dish were golden and toasted to a delightful crunch, while the \"sugo\"  permeated the middle and ridges of the pizza making  softer, doughy, yet cooked, goodness. Timing and precise oven temperature created the harmonious two-toned textures that entered my body.\n\nService? Our server facilitated our dinner. Extremely attentive and minimally intrusive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-04-28", "description": "It's staggering to think about how many pizza joints there are in the Bay Area.  Even if you consider only the ones in a single category, say Chicago-style, there are still more of them then there are Doyles in Boston.  That makes it all the more impressive that Little Star is so outstanding that it's one of only three pizzerias in the Bay Area good enough to be included in the \"Holy Trinity\" of Chicago-style deep-dish pizza joints.\n\nWhich of the Trinity is the best of the best?  I've weighed in with my opinion before:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/patxis-chicago-pizza-palo-alto#hrid:rIQ6W8ebPxMBcGCOd1VkAQ Several of my friends have also weighed in with theirs, and horror of horrors: our opinions differ!  With the other two Holy Trinity pizza joints still fresh in my mind from recent visits, I set out to revisit Little Star at the end of February.  Maybe I'd change my mind, maybe my friends would change theirs; either way, you can't go wrong with pizza as good as this, and Yelpers that are this cool!  I organized a small PYE and set out to meet uber-Elites Cecilia S., Janice C., Bobby L., and Peter L. for an evening of world-class pizza, drinking, and (eventually) Karaoke.  Our first stop was Little Star in Western Addition.\n\nThe first of us hit Little Star at 5:30 and immediately proceeded to the bar (we Elites have our priorities straight); a table became available just as the third and fourth of our number arrived.  The atmosphere is a little dark, but decidedly classier then your average pizza joint.  The very friendly and accommodating staff served up some excellent recommendations about toppings, and got our pizza and drink orders started in short order.  \n\nFirst up, we got an order of garlic bread for the table.  The garlic bread is a \nloaf of warm sourdough served with a blend of butter & extra virgin olive oil and a bulb of roasted garlic. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/__I9HmtBMV4dDkEgT22V4g?select=9zl79X8GugMmlChpiTMTNw As I didn't know Peter was coming loaded for bear, I ordered a Red Tail on draft to compliment the bread.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/__I9HmtBMV4dDkEgT22V4g?select=J1o2YGM2OylQBpRqlUcfjQ\n\nDeep dish being Chicago style pizza's claim to fame, we ordered a large Little Star - Spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, garlic, to which we added sausage, as we're all unrepentant Carnivores. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/__I9HmtBMV4dDkEgT22V4g?select=6IEfuIUvVz5Ko2DKoXOVMA Because diversity is the spice of life, and (more importantly) because Yelpers eat like Grizzly Bears coming out of hibernation, we also ordered a White Pie - Garlic olive oil base, mozzarella, roasted zucchini, fresh tomatoes, feta. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/__I9HmtBMV4dDkEgT22V4g?select=BYJZd609SPcwcpqCtx67Dg\n\nJanice C., who quite out of character started out the evening drinking water, traded up her beverage when Peter L. arrived; he brought a couple of outstanding bottles of Imagery wine to share!  With Janice leading the charge (you don't think our vesper knew Peter was bringing premium vino, do you?), we had no problem demolishing both the wine and the pizza in short order.  Thanks Peter - next time, it's my turn to bring the wine! :-)\n\nThe $64,000 question - just how good is their pizza?  I for one am convinced that Little Star unquestionably belongs in the \"Holy Trinity\"; their corn-meal crust is without equal, their sauce and their toppings are first tier, and every slice of their pies drips with lush, gooey, cheesy goodness.  For my money, while I think Chicago style pizza is at it's best with double-crusted variants like those that can be found at Zachary's and Paxti's, I'd happily consume mass-quantities of Little Star pizza multiple times a week.  Mammon only knows what I was thinking on my first visit to the Little Star on Valencia Street - five stars all the way!\n\nNow, on to the drinking and Karaoke!", "author": "Glenn G."}

Welcoming hostess plus a waiter than never let our glasses be empty and always with recommendations made for an awesome trip. With their apparent success, it would be easy to let this fall to the wayside, but they haven't! \nFood: We got the garlic bread to start based on recommendation. It was as good as described and pretty huge actually. My only issue with it was that it was a little similar to the pizza, which was what was coming next, so I felt a little like we ordered two of the same thing. Not their fault and it was definitely good, but just something to keep in mind. For pizza, my fiancee and I shared the Little Star deep dish (Duh! How could we not get their titled pizza on our first visit?!). It was everything we had hoped it would be and more! The ingredients were all clearly fresh and it was packed. One small was definitely enough for two medium hungry people. We had leftovers too! It was a little greasy, but hey, it's pizza! Can't expect completely healthy. There were pretty few options on the menu, which I think is a sign of a good restaurant that knows what it does well.\nAtmosphere: Super SF-y. Fairly small, a little dark, and very hipster. I dug it! They had curtains I assume to help keep the noise a little lower, which I thought worked well. \n\nOverall: I was super stoked after my visit to LS. From service to food it was spot on. The price was appropriate for what you get and the whole vibe was great. I can't wait to come by again!

After our baby was born, I called Little Star and brought it back to the hospital (they're very convenient to Kaiser).\n\nMy personal favorite is The Classic, which is the deep dish pizza with sausage, peppers, and mushrooms. When I'm rolling with the wife, who's vegetarian, we usually pick up a Little Star (spinach, mushrooms, ricotta, feta) or just a straight-up Cheese. \n\nThese are all deep-dish, mind you. I've tried the thin crust, which is fine, but the deep dish is where Little Star really shines. That cornmeal crust is just phenomenally good, and although the first melty slice usually gets the fork and knife treatment, I can usually hand-hold the rest of them - that's how strong (and yet delicious) the crust is.\n\nI also highly recommend their mixed salad to start. It's a delicious mix of greens, cherry tomatoes, onions, walnuts, blue cheese, and vinaigrette. It's going to knock your socks off and prepare your belly for the main event.", "author": "Andrew M."}

Could it truly be as good as the excellent stuffed pizza I was born and raised on in the East Bay? The answer: yes!  I actually give Little Star the edge over Zachary's in a couple of areas including their corn meal crust and the chill vibe working.  Although parking is tough, the pizza makes it worth it!

I was surprised when we walked in and there were only a few people inside since it was prime eating time on a Saturday. We were seated right away and our waitress was super nice and very attentive =)\n\nWe ordered the chicken wings and the classic deep dish pizza to share. I was looking forward to the pizza so I didn't give the wings a second thought until my boyfriend told me I had to try them. Holy crap these were AMAZING! I usually like my wings nice and saucy, but I was blown away by these wings, they were dry but so tasty!! Nice and tender with a subtle spicy kick that creeps up on you as you keep eating. Delicious.  Our pizza followed about 10 minutes later and we dug in. SO NOM. I can't remember the last time I had deep dish but I don't want to go anywhere but Little Star from here on out. The crust was perfectly crispy and had a delicious bready, handmade flavor. Also NO SOGGY, GREASY RESIDUE!! The crust was totally dry and perfect. I'm not a big cheese fan but no worries as there was the perfect amount in our pie, along with a copious amount of toppings. But what really pushed this pie over the top was the addition of the delicious tomato sauce on top which had chunks of tomatoes to give a tasty texture. I could eat that sauce straight it was so yummy.\n\nCan I come back tomorrow? I loved everything about this place, the food, the people, the ambiance, it was PERFECTION. This is my go-to pizza place for sure, I can't wait to go back! We already decided we are getting the Mediterranean Pizza next ;)", "author": "Sam F."}

Sacramento isn't known for their deep dish pizza so I never bothered to try it. After our New Years festivities, we decide to try this place for a hearty meal. This place is a little bit hard to find because there outside is pretty plain with a small sign in front. The inside is very nice with a bar and wood tables. It only fits about 30 people max so it may not be ideal if you have a large group of 10+.\n\nWe sat down and I ordered (split between two) the spicy chicken wings with the Little Star Deep Dish Pizza with a nice beer. The wings were awesome. Deep fried perfectly so the skin is soo nice and crispy! The wings had just enough spicy for a good kick. The pizza was delicious! Very hearty with a lot of spinach.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-18", "description": "I've had pizza in Chicago, and pizza in Brooklyn, and this place is as good as it gets for California deep dish. \n\nI'm a fan of pizza (surprise). Part of how I judge a city is by its best pizza joints. I've tried to make it a point to visit the best rated pizza shops in every major city I've walked through. From the folding thin crust of coal-fired Brooklyn slices, the generous pies of Chicago, to the fresh wood-fired oven Neapolitan pizza of Tony's Pizza Napoletana here in SF and innumerable shops in-between, I've somehow managed to refine a fairly snobby palate for the end product of cooking tomato and cheese on dough.\n\nMost places with mediocre to decent ratings manage them with the portions. It takes more than a lot of food to make me remember it, though. I need personality/flavor to keep me coming back. National chains reliably suck at accomplishing this, and everywhere else just throws heaps of frozen, processed or greasy food at you. Little Star manages to avoid all of that with a standard of memorably good pizza. \n\nThough I've had several types here, my weakness is the deep dish. It's the only thing I've had that comes close to standing up to the immensely flavorful Lou Malnatti's in Chicago. Little Star deep dish crust is crispy and substantial, the cheese is real, and its tomato sauce rivals most. The ingredients aren't limp or bland. While this is a deep dish, the similarities with Sicilian style pizza are only good: the bottom is the crispiest, and the dough above that soft and pillowy. It's a quality crafted gourmet pizza, and you realize it the minute you sink your teeth into its old-world perfectly ratioed wedges.\n\nThe thin crust is above serviceable if you're a homesick New Yorker, but I wouldn't be tempted to call it better than a Di Fara's (good flat pizza in SF can be found at Tonys Pizza Napoletana, or Emilia's Pizzeria in Berkeley). Still, it's some of the best you're likely to find on the West Coast. The deep dish is where Little Star shines.\n\nThe last I checked they don't sell by the slice, and the cost is a bit steep as you add more ingredients, but for the quality, it's easily worth a visit. This isn't drunk food. It's where you go to get quality pizza.", "author": "Brian S."}

The ricotta and feta cheeses give the pizza a nice creamy and smooth taste of cheese without having to worry about never ending cheese when you cut it (though I'm guilty of sometimes liking this).  The sauce was really good too with plenty of herbs. I loved the garlic which complimented the veggies, and the sausage was juicy.  The crust was perfect too..mmm nom nom!

Yes. \nIs that saying much given the lack of options in the Bay? No.\n\nCrust - pleasingly solid base that withstood the sauce well but overcooked and had very dry edges. A great cornmeal texture but lacking any real flavor. Not terrible but not great. I've had better cornmeal crusts.\n\nSauce - Very... average. In a deep dish the sauce is what defines the pizza and this was not sweet, not tart, not herbed, not spiced, not.. well anything much. Just... a tomato sauce. Felt like a great base for the sauce I wanted in there. Again, not bad... just not great. Almost dull.\n\nCheese - good ricotta, nice cheese base, but would have preferred more of it. Probably my fav part of the pizza overall, just needed more.\n\nMeat - couldn't taste it through the sauce but it had a good texture. \n\nService - Minimal. Friendly staff but they are terrible at setting expectations (pizza took about 40 mins to get to our table... 20-30 is fine but it wasn't even that busy) and don't really pay any attention to you once you've sat down.\n\nOverall... it's a decent enough pie I suppose but it's mostly popular as far as I can tell due to the novelty of this style in SF. Which is also how it justifies its kind of too high prices. Certainly not worth it unless you're in the area and only then because it's different. \n\nWould I go back? Sure, but I won't be seeking it out any time soon and that's a shame: I think it could be amazing if it just... tried harder. But it's SF... so it doesn't have to.", "author": "Gregory W."}

When we checked in for a table the hostess asked for my number and I immediately got a text showing how long I've been waiting and how many people are in front of me. Our wait was about 45 minutes and was killer because of the aroma of the pizzas. There's little couches to sit on or you can wait outside but most chose to stand outside to avoid clustering the entrance. When you are waiting they can also take your order so that once you are seated you immediately get your food since the pizzas take about 35 minutes to make.

After an earlier run-in with a highly recommended SF pizzeria, I was skeptical of Yelp's reviews of Bay-area pizza joints.  But Little Star is a big slice of happiness.\n\nIt's small, and kinda hard to find.  Their sign doesn't even light up.  I was dining alone, so I sat at the bar to avoid a 30-minute wait.\n\nI began with their garlic bread.  It's basically a sliced sourdough loaf with a cup of melty butter and half a garlic clove.  It's up to you to scoop out the garlic and administer that and your butter as you see fit.  Initially, this annoyed me, but it was so good, I let the do-it-yourself assembly slide.\n\nThen came the pizza.  I ordered a small deep dish pepperoni.  The sauce is the best part.  It's fairly chunky and zesty.  For any Chicagoans out there, it reminded me a bit of Giordano's.\n\nThe crust was surprisingly well done.  It was thick, but light.  Even when you get to the notoriously difficult-to-manage end of a slice, it remained good.  It looked similar to Pizzeria Uno/Due, but tasted far better.  They even had some cornmeal action on the bottom - a nice touch.\n\nThe only place where Little Star's non-Chicago roots were painfully evident was the cheese.  In the midwest, we know cheese.  Some of us wear it to football games.  It's a passion.  In California, I assume cheese is a 4-letter word.  It conjures thoughts of cholesterol and the human manatees Chicago is famous for.  So maybe that's why Little Star skimped a bit on the cheese.\n\nThat said, I was more than happy with my visit to Little Star.  And if I ever make it to San Francisco again, I'll be back.  And for those of you in San Francisco looking for an equally awesome pizza treat when visiting Chicago, look up Lou Malnati's.\n\n(Important Note: Little Star does *not* take credit cards.)", "author": "Ben B."}

It was really dark despite the beautiful sunny weather we were having in SF. Although it was dark, Little Star is cozy and tastefully decorated with lots of hand painted artwork.\n\nOur hostess/waitress was also very sweet and nice.

After looking at the huge menu, my boyfriend settled on a small deep dish sausage and pepperoni pizza and I settled on the small special which was an olive oil based pizza topped with bacon, broccollini, sharp cheddar, and garlic (all the things I absolutely love!) The wait was about 15-20 minutes for our orders which was pretty long but well worth it!\n\nOnce I took that first bite, I was like \"OMG GIVE ME MORE!\" At pizza places, I usually have up to 2 slices and I'm done but that wasn't the case at Little Star. Good Lord, I must've had at least 3-4 slices plus a slice of my boyfriend's pizza. SO GOOD! The special was absolutely delicious! The bacon was crunchy, the broccollini was fresh, and the garlic? Well, spread it before biting into your pizza or else you'll get a whole lotta garlic! The deep dish pizza was also very good! If you like lots of tomato sauce on your pizza, then you'll like their deep dish pizzas. The cornmeal crust was my favorite! SO good!

The pizza was very good, I give them that, though the sauce on the thin crust pizzas leave something to be desired the deep dish is delightful. But sadly the service is awful. My party arrived in two parts, myself and one member first, where we were greeted and seated promptly, off to a good start. I asked for water because its no longer complimentary (pretentious but expected from this sort of establishment) and we mentioned two other members were late. Fine. Eventually our party showed up, and Little Star was still nice. We placed our orders, two small pizzas, a deep dish and a thin crust, and the gentleman took out order and went on his way. Having worked in pizza places I wondered what the time would be for the deep dish, they usually take a while but nothing was mentioned. We had some drinks and awaited our pizza. Just after our beers arrived another couple was seated near us. Then another. Then after we finished our beers a large mob of drunken soccer fans just leaving a World Cup party was seated. And pizzas? Well one couple to my right got one, we were ignored. Then another group. Then the squawking gaggle of idiots started getting there's. \n\nBottom line we ordered at 2:40 pm on a Sunday and received our first think crust at 3:40. The deep dish was another 10 minutes. No word about it, no \"hey we got busy\" no \"we forgot\" not even a \"hey we burnt it\".  \n\nHe'll we didn't even get a thank you for waiting. Or even asked if we wanted a second round of drinks.

The thick crust, thick tomato sauce, and melted cheese inside is a slice of pizza heaven! The ingredients in this pizza is different from your average pizza. One of the best things about Little Star is that their crust is more like cornbread and has a sweet taste to it. If you're not a fan of tomatoes, you might not like the sauce too much. Their sauce is very thick and has huge chunks of tomatoes in it. I brought one of my SF friends here on my visit and they weren't a big fan of LS bc they hated the huge chunks of tomatoes. (Weird right?)\n\nBut, if you're not a fan of tomatoes, they do offer other varieties that I'm sure are quite tasty too.\n\nIf you want something different in your diet, come by Little Star and prepare for a pie of goodness.

That being said, it's not a bad pizza.  \n\nIn any case, the pizza is pretty good. The cheese is tasty and of good texture. The crust is decent (could be a little crispier and have more of a butter taste), but the crust also isn't as tall as a true deep dish is supposed to be. If I can pick up the slice of pizza and eat it like a normal hand tossed pizza with relative ease, we are not dealing with a true deep dish pie. Not a bad attempt, but not quite there yet. Little Star provides a decent meal in any case. Restaurant has nice ambiance and good service, nothing over the top.\n\nAs a native Chicagoan, I have come to the conclusion I will never be satisfied with eating deep dish pizza in the Bay. Little Star provides a quality meal in any case, but it's not what I would consider a new favorite. I'd be happy to return, but I'm in no rush to do so.", "author": "Lauren P."}

For the latter, end your search and just come here. We ordered a pie of the thin crust and one the of the deep dish and were not disappointed.

After sitting down to our table, our pizza came about 10min later. We got the veggie deep dish (substituting regular garlic with roasted) \n\nPizza was delicious as always, though the veggies were kinda huge and thick and I could barely taste the roasted garlic. My hubby also ordered the wings (OK but nothing special) and I also ordered thier cheesecake to go, after reading so many reviews of how great it was.\n\nThe cheescake was nothing too special, decent but not the best I've had. I still prefer Charlie's Cheesecake works in San Jose. \n\nOne minor complaint with this location is that iced tea is not listed as (Bottled Honest tea or the flavlor) and don't get me wrong I LOVE Honest tea but NOT for $3 bucks when it costs less than half that in stores. The reason this bothered me was that I was expecting a refill with the amount of food we got as I have at thier other locations but obviously, it being bottled, they weren't going to do that. So if I'm expected to pay so much for iced tea, I expect refills!\n\nTIP: Go right at opening or no later than 7pm, unless you wanna wait longer than 30min. I also HIGHLY suggest pre ordering your pizza so you aren't waiting for another 30min once seated. I also think it's courtous to others as well because it also shortens thier wait.

I would say the best pizza in San Francisco, but not the best in the U.S. and that's why I give them a 4 stars instead of 5. The best pizza in the US is at Gino's East in Chicago.\n\nNow more about this place. This place can get extremely crowded and the wait can be insane. I recommend either going before 5pm or after 9pm if you don't like waiting. The ambiance here is dark and noisy but the service is good and the place is clean.\n\nThe pizza here is deep dish and I've tried most of them and I got to say they are pretty good and they are worth the wait.\n\nOverall, I recommend at least trying this place once and most likely you will come back for more.", "author": "Anthony N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-24", "description": "Review #200.  I'm dedicating this landmark review towards something that's near and dear to my cholesterolized heart, Chicago mutha fucking deep dish pizza!!  All those midwestern/Chicago transplants in the Bay Area have made San Francisco a heaven for Chicago Deep Dish pizza.\n\nMy standard bearer, for Chicago Deep Dish is Lou Malnati's in Chicago, closely followed by Zachary's in Oakland.  Why are these pizzas so good?  It's a combination of buttery crust that just breaks in your mouth ever so easily and the tomato sauce and cheese proportions.  Crazily enough, you can actually have too much cheese and too little tomato sauce, like Giordano's in Chicago.\n\nLittle Star Pizza comes close to reproducing what Lou Malnati's does, but it falls just slightly short.  The taste of the crust is great, but that texture falls short.  There's an absolutely buttery, airy flakiness in Lou Malnati's crust.  It makes you crave the crust, which is an amazing feat considering how many of us don't eat crusts on any type of pizza.  Little Star's crust is just slightly too crunchy.\n\nAs for the pizza itself, we had the Classic (sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bells).  There was no complaint about the pizza at all.  The toppings were plenty, the taste was what I expected.  There was a good balance cheese and tomato sauce.  (holy shit, my mouth is really watering right now).\n\nThe wait at Little Star is probably the worst in San Francisco/Bay Area out of all the Chicago Deep Dish places in the city.  Patxi's and Zachary's seem to have better wait times.  We waited 80 minutes for a table of 3 on a Saturday night around 9pm.\n\nOverall a pretty good effort in recreating Chicago Deep Dish.  Less wait time and more buttery crust would get an extra star for me.", "author": "Kyle W."}

They weren't very busy so being sat and service was quick. We picked out the Pesto chicken for our thin crust. This was very good, but a little too much onions for me. All over the top was thinly sliced onions. I did like that the flavors from the other ingredients weren't masked too much. The chicken was not dry - I was happy about that. I actually prefer thin crust. The pizza was very crispy on the bottom and the crust and not burnt. It was great.\n\nFor our deep dish we had the vegetarian one. I didn't like this as much because there was too much tomato sauce and tomatoes in it. I did like the zucchini though. The crust was very cornmeal-y, which I didn't like as much, but it had a nice texture.\n\nOverall our meal was good, but next time I will choose different pizzas.", "author": "Katherine L."}

Some people prefer a more bread-y crust but this one was more cornmeal-y but not too much (like Gino's East). Came in on a Wednesday night with a friend and was seated right away.  The staff and atmosphere is laid-back.  We had some wine, split a salad and a small pizza.  The serving sizes were just right, however, the only reason why I removed a star is that it's a bit pricy for a tiny pizza.  Deep dish in Chicago doesn't even cost this much.

It was not Pequod's Pizza in Chicago.  I'm starting to believe that no other pizza will compare.\n\nAnyway, service was attentive, but we were placed close to the front door and we were freezing!  They started us off with water.  I ordered a diet soda and they brought it in a can, my friend ordered a beer and she said it was really good.  We also ordered the wings.  Those are definitely some of the best hot wings I've ever had.  They were not your typical wings, dripping of sauce, they were crispy and spicy and just plain deelish.\n\nThe place is extremely small and it explains why there would be a long wait.

I did some Yelp research and decided to take a drive up to Little Star and see what's what. My biggest problem with Yelp research is expectations.

I have always been a high expectations even bigger let downs kinda guy. \n\nI really want to love Chicago deep dish pizza. Especially when the crust is as perfect as it is at Little Star. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. What I don't love is a pizza covered in canned tomatoes. It really prevents me from tasting the fresh toppings. For example, when I order a pepperoni and sausage pizza, I want to taste greasy swine. When I took my first bite, all I got was canned tomatoes. I was hunting and searching for the swine and it was there, but I wasn't happy that I couldn't taste it. I guess I could ask for no tomatoes on top next time, but I have this policy. When I go to a place for the first time, I don't get picky. I order what they do best, I take it the way it's prepared and then I bitch about it.

We were completely satisfied and full.\n\nSide note: the garlic bread recipe changed a few weeks ago and now it's sort of like a mini garlic cheese pizza.

Zachary's Debate, I was always a little partial to Zachary's pizza, but Little Star (both this location and the one in the Mission) wins out on ambiance.  Where Zachary's is more of a family-friendly environment, Little Star is more of a warm, hip, even romantic vibe.  The NOPA location is pretty small, but a neat, cozy and hip little space - *sigh* no one does cozy AND hip quite like SF.  Hiphiphip.  And yes, it seriously does have a romantic thing going on - my husband took me here for dinner right before he proposed to me (it should be noted, actual proposal took place in Alamo Square over a shared flagon of whiskey, so, you know, when I say it's romantic, you can trust that I know what I'm talking about because CLASS.)\n\nThe wait is almost always really long, but the pizza is outstanding.  Delicious, chunky tomato sauce on top of cheesecheeseandmorecheese, and a delicious crust that I...can't even describe without feeling a little bit like I want to cry, but just know that there is cornmeal and it's crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside and it does this kind of pullapart thing....\n\nAnyway.

I have yet to sample another pizza place with a crust that rivals the one at Little Star.\n\nThe Little Star pizza is my go-to. It has spinach and ricotta, as well as mushrooms, garlic, and onions. Or for those of you craving a little bit of meat, order the Brass Monkey. It's off menu, and is basically the Little Star with sausage added to it.  I've had the vegetarian pizza here as well, and while not quite as good as the Little Star, it's definitely worth a try.\n\nI almost always get the garlic bread appetizer. The bread is served nice and warm and accompanied with butter an d an entire bulb of roasted garlic! If you're a garlic lover like I am, or just trying to ward off vampires, you will not be disappointed with this dish.\n\nThe only reason why I need to dock off one star is because I have issues with the consistency of this place. I don't know if it depends on who is back in the kitchen or how busy the place is that particular night, but sometimes I leave Little Star feeling happy as a clam, and sometimes the pizza disappoints since it wasn't as good as previous experiences.

Seated and ordered the spicy chicken wings, a deep dish large brass monkey pizza, and the thin crust large italian combo small pizza. Was debating on getting 2 larges but the waiter was nice enough to say I think that would be too much food (which is nice of him, cause he really didn't have to). The chicken wings were alright, kind of forgettable... but I guess they aren't known for their chicken wings. I've never had a deep dish pizza so this was my first and it did not disappoint. Sure, it was hard to eat (I just gave up and ate with my fork) but it was pretty good. I'm not a huge pizza fan, so I can't go into too much detail, but it was definitely pretty good and worth the wait... I can see why some people go crazy over this place. The Italian combo pizza was good too... just because it had a variety of toppings that complimented each other. Deep dish or thin crust... I think I'm more of a thin crust kind of guy... just because I felt like I was eating a quiche while I was eating the deep dish pizza.

I've been to Little Star far more times than I'd like to admit and in fact, have been here twice in the past week! I just couldn't overturn the decisions of the other 3 people I was with at the time. But it's a pretty standard and awesome place so of course, I kind of had to oblige. \n\nFirst of all, get some reservations in and add about 30 minutes to said reservations to calculate actual seating time. No joke. But the place is so darn tiny, I can't blame them really and you could always order appetizers and beers at the bar so what's the big deal really? Sure there's a ugly horde of people squished in like sardines at the waiting area, the scenery outside is nothing awesome to look at and there's less than 10 actual bar stools but it's all part of the experience.\n\nIf I may, I'd like to recommend the caprese salad for all of you mozzarella cheese lovers.

I could just about drink/eat that concoction every day. I try to perfect it at home but I'm just not getting something right. It's the basil, it's the size of the mozzarella balls, it's my lack of crack that's standard in all LIttle Star dishes-I just don't know.\n\nI debate over getting appetizers and pizza because the small pizza is just too big for two people. It reminds me of home in a way with the cornmeal crust and the tomato sauce that's not too thin and acidic. My friend and I had the classic and each bite was just magical. It seriously takes me back home each time I bite into it. I can almost see the little finger pinches of the crust which makes me appreciate it that much more. \n\nSave some room in your tummy and don't go overboard with the pizza 'cause their cheesecake is pretty awesome and there's a gorgeous raspberry to go with it too.

As everyone else has stated, it is powerful enough to change the perspective of a hater like me on deep dish pies. The thin crust pies are also good, though the two I've tried were not as memorable. Overall, the service is friendly, and I have never had any complaints. \n\nTip: you can convert any thin crust pie into a deep dish, though just remember, the pie will have tomato sauce on top as a deep dish. In other words, if you convert a white pie to a deep dish, it's going to have red sauce on it.\n\nConstructive criticism: I wish they had a more variety in their appetizers. The selection is very bread and cheese heavy.

Little Star won out this time due to the fact I didn't feel like going into the city on the way to Santa Rosa... but don't worry, next trip up to SF Tony's here I come...\n\nSo this is a tiny little pizza joint right offer Divisadero... it can be easily missed but just seek out the little star logo and you will be fine... the building is painting in dark colors but I'm sure you will see people there for the food....\n\nLet's start from the outside and work our way in...\n\nParking is metered like everywhere else in SF... very limited around the area so good luck... Nina R. and I visited this place at about 2:15pm so we scored a perfect parking spot right in front... however, $0.25 for 8 minutes???  Is \"The City\" that strapped for cash???  Sigh... I had no change so I had to ask the LS hostess for some change for parking...\n\nUpon entering, the hostess was very nice and cordial and immediately get me the change I needed... so back out I went to pop some coins in for parking...(remember... bring lots of coins!!!  It's gonna run you about $3 bucks or so for sure!)\n\nPlace is dimly lit... about 10 tables or so... clean, quiet (during the time I was there), and pretty intimate.....\n\nBathroom was clean and artistic just like most of the places in SF....\n\nSo we went ahead and ordered the Spinach Feta/Mediterranean half and half pie (deep dish)...  \n\nBe prepared.... it took 30 minutes for the pie to come out... yes it's hand freshly made to order, but man.... 30 minutes..... there is at least $1 out of parking already.....\n\nWhen the pizza came out it was piping hot and cute!  It looked small but the small portion was filling enough for 2 people with left overs... the Spinach Feta was delicious and creamy while Mediterranean tasted healthy than it should be which is not a bad thing....\n\nI do believe it was corn meal crusted... not my favorite cup of tea as I love them buttered up crust baked to crisp that tasted like a Danish butter cookie.... so Little Star take note.... get more butter on your crust please!!!\n\nThe bill came out to about $28 + $3 for one pizza... little steep but can't beat the experience...\n\nSo here's the Pros and Cons part...\n\nPros:  Tasty pizza, great service, nice atmosphere, clean bathroom...\nCons:  No parking, expensive price point\n\nI would of given it a 3 star due to parking and the cost, but I did enjoy the experience and the food so bumping it up one star is very fair in my opinion....\n\nNow that I've tackled one of the top pizzeria in SF...

It feels almost light.\n\nBut there's still something missing that guilty pleasure you can sink your teeth into and wipe from the corners of your mouth; dense with cheese, layered with smoking toppings; held together by that all-important flakey, almost pastry-like crust that you crave for in a good deep dish pie; the one that you anticipate, brace, and save yourself for, like a virgin on their wedding night submitting themselves to a visceral celebration of sense and sin.\n\nIn a word: Buttery. That's what's missing.\n\nAnd it keeps little star from shining brightly in the constellation of great deep dish pies.", "author": "Tony L."}

The crust was nicely crisp and the sauce was robust and zesty. I would however, preferred my sauce to be more saucy like a stew, rather than thick like a sauce. The meat is what really set this pizza off. The pepperoni and sausage we had were transcendent and I wish i had some to take home!\n\nOur waitress was amazing. Being on a time crunch to see the surrounding areas before the sun set, we asked if we could leave our table (we had already received our drinks) and come back in time for the pizza to be ready. We offered to leave our credit cards for her assurance but she insisted we didn't need to.

I've never had Deep Dish/Chicago Style until Little Star. I'm sitting at the table, with the menu staring at me, still hesitant to go for Deep dish. My boyfriend gave me a little push so I gave in. :P (Hmmph!)\nWhen our \"Build your own Pizza!\" arrived at our table, I was still very intimidated by the thick and dense looking thing. Needless to say, I'm glad we went for it!\n\nThe cornmeal crust was amazing! :) I've also never had that prior to Little Star! (I know I know...what is this girl doing with her life?! She's missing out!) I love that it wasn't so heavy compared to regular pizza dough, it didn't become soggy even after it was out on the table for a while, and it was crispy!\n\nThe first bite of that Mushroom, Spinach, Sausage, and Sun-dried Tomato Cheesy goodness, was a moment of pure indulgence.

I've had a few of these Chicago deep-dish types now, from different places, several times each, and Little Star is just the best. \n\nI almost always get the small Little Star with artichoke hearts as an add-on. Lemme tell you bout this pizza. Usually I think tomato sauce completely take-it-or-leave-it, but this one really tastes like crushed tomatoes and is never too acidic. The spinach is fresh, the mushrooms savory, the top layer of ricotta is pleasantly creamy while the bottom layer of mozzarella is satisfyingly stretchy. I love that the artichoke hearts they use aren't over-marinated and tangy, and preserve the real flavor of the vegetable. \n\nAnd the crust. I always save it for last, savoring it like a dessert. This rich cornmeal crust is perfectly crispy like a cornbread muffin top. Eating it is like visiting the southern grandmother I don't have, going back to some roots that aren't mine, but still being enveloped in the warm embrace of home cooking.\n\nIf it seems like I don't want my crusts, you are wrong.

My friends Crys, NY and I happened to stumble into Little Star Pizza just before 6pm and got to take part of their Tue/Wed night special (5-6pm).  We ordered an appetizer (the DELICIOUS garlic sour dough bread) and got our pizza 1/2 price.  Our total bill for 3 beers (also happy hour), 2 sodas, garlic bread and a large pizza was less than $30 and less than the large pizza would've been.  We felt like it was our birthdays.  \n\nOk, that being said, the pizza was good.  Very good.  It's Chicago-style, like Zachary's or Paxti's... which is a style I really appreciate.  The crust might be not quite as thick as the other 2 but it was still unique and good.  Because it's not as thick, it didn't take as long to cook.  (At the other places, you have to order 40min in advance.)  After a bit of appetizer, I could only eat one piece of pizza.  That's ok though... I can't wait to eat the leftovers!\n\nAnother note, the restaurant space is really cool.  It has interesting art on the walls and though dim when you first go in, is a cozy, comfy joint.  Our waitress was cool and efficient too.\n\nSee ya there!", "author": "Susan D."}

Having tried Zachary's on multiple occasions, I hadn't heard much about Little Star except through word-of-mouth.\n\nLet me tell you, this joint is WORTH THE WAIT. Come early so you're not frickin' about to die of hunger by the time you get a table and are actually served your pizza -- it takes time.\n\nI tried the Little Star and the Vegetarian varieties. Both were really great pizzas, but my vote goes to the Vegetarian! Loaded with fresh veggies, all the flavors really stood out and fit well with the sauce and the crust.\n\nSpeaking of the crust, I think this was the differentiator between Zachary's and Little Star. While the former had a flakier pastry crust, Little Star's pizza was made of a grainy cornmeal crust, which obviously contains more flavor. Also, corn is an ingredient rarely found in pizza crust, making it that much more unique. Two thumbs up!! \n\nDefinitely THE PLACE for deep dish pizza lover.\n\nNote: I was so tempted to give them a 5-star review, but have to reserve the last star until I try Paxti's.", "author": "Mansi A."}

I found out some F@#ker in Missouri got a hold of my debit card numbers and charged up almost 200 bills in 3 separate transactions. For a good half of the day I was pissed, I wanted nothing more than to smash this person's face in with my own two fists. Being a college student and not making that much money can make a guy upset tat he lost almost half a checks worth of money on stuff he didn't buy. After not having much of an appetite all day, I just needed to get out of the house.\n\nMy good friend offered to take me out to dinner, even tho his day wasn't going any better. I was seeking comfort food other than my fav bowl of noodles.  When we got to Little Pizza, we found a parking space within a matter of minutes right across the street. We were told that it would be a half hr wait to be seated. I said well we are here already so we mind as wait it out. We browsed the menu and figured out we wanted the Italian Combo Deep dish pizza. The hostess was nice and said that we could do a pre-order for the deep dish while we waited. \n\nWhen we were seated, i got to check out the decor and the restroom. There are alot interesting furniture and artwork. The hostesses podium is actually a dresser.  http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6U4kIcBB6--R5DlGhsFVdQ/l\nThe Pac Man bathroom sign was super cute!

To me it masked the flavors of our Italian combo. Maybe that pizza isn't good for deep dish but everything on the pizza was very fresh and tasted good, but the sauce was so strong. The crust was delicious, crisp and different from any other crusts i have ever had.  \nhttp://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DqTwUXYUqOuOTMd517LKiw/l\n\nAfter eating 3 slices of the deep dish, It still wasn't hitting the spot for me, so i ordered a small Chicken Pesto thin crust. It came out piping hot and after taking my first bite, I noticed that the pesto taste was very pronounced and the mix of onions, chicken, pesto and cheese were perfect. Exactly what my tastebuds were looking for. My only gripe was that the edges were burnt a bit and the chicken was a lil bit overcooked, other than that it was a good pizza. Considering i ate half of that too :X. http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6q27r5vWaaamiqAKvEtW5A/l\n\nMy conclusion about the thin crust: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/__I9HmtBMV4dDkEgT22V4g?select=ZvfIvn_CkWd5dfg5CGGGLA\n\nI would like to conclude with giving props to our waitress CLAIRE! You were awesome, she came back to check on us and ask us if we needed anything. Keep up the good work Claire!\n\nSome Words of advice:\n\n-CASH ONLY! (remember i said my friend was treating, well he didn't have any cash so i had to pay -__-, but at tat point I could care less.)\n\n-If you are waiting to be seated and you have a 30min or so, do a preorder if you are getting a deep dish.\n\n-The place gets noisy btw the music and many people talking at once, prolly not the best place to catch up with someone unless you like talking over the noise.\n\n-Be prepared to wait, this place gets insanely busy", "author": "Jonathan W."}

The first time I went I ordered their daily special; a thin crust pizza with white-sauce, bacon, broccoli & garlic... holy crap. I couldn't get anything for a while. \n\nWhen I finally made the switch to the deep dish it was just as magical. Let me just warn you that the deep dish is big and heavy and it actually made me sick because I kept eating it. I think its a good sign when something makes you sick because its so good you just can't stop eating it? \n\nAs much as I love this place I don't know if I would recommend it for delivery or even pick-up. It's restaurant style pizza at restaurant style prices.", "author": "Eduardo R."}

When its cut in thick cubes it leans heavily into being ham. \n\nAs harsh as my review is on the thin crust pie, which they are absolutely horrific at making. I have enjoyed their thick crust pizza, which is not really pizza. Its more just pie, but it is good, hence the many positive reviews. I feel I am giving them very constructive criticism as they are getting big heads thinking they can produce great thin crust pizza. Its either one or the other. \n\nI love pizza debate.", "author": "H K."}

It's clearly a popular spot, and it was a Friday night. We ordered the large Classic deep dish pizza (23\" with sausage, mushrooms, onions, and green bell peppers) to share when the hostess took our name after she told us that it takes 30 minutes to cook.\n\nWhen we sat down, we also ordered the garlic bread and the large mixed salad to share as appetizers. The garlic bread was a few slices of sourdough with a bulb of roasted garlic and side of butter. We all enjoyed it, though I suggest that you get two orders for four people The mixed salad is good too, and the crumbled Gorgonzola was a nice touch.\n\nI was worried that the pizza might be overrated because it's hard to make pizza taste amazing and stand out, but it far exceeded my expectations. The cheese, toppings, and sauce were very well balanced with each other. The cheese had the perfect gooey consistency, and the sausage and cornmeal crust were amazing. \n\nThe service was attentive as well. Our glass water bottle was refilled quickly, and the servers came by to check on us often.", "author": "Sara L."}

However I had my midget terror child (dog) with me, so I was not able to go inside and wait. This time I went with a group of about 8 or 9 people. Since they do not take reso's, we headed over there at about 5:45pm on a Saturday and put our name down on the list. They said it would only be about 15-20 min, so we happily waited at the bar and got a couple glasses of wine. By the time the table was ready he asked if our whole group was there, which they weren't. I asked if he could seat us anyways b/c we were only missing one girl. Luckily he agreed and added an extra chair when we realized we were actually missing two, Ooops! Loved how accommodating they were considering how booked they were! :)\n\nNow onto the food. Once again their deep dish pizza was delish and super filling. Their garlic bread was really good too-- whole roasted garlic, dish of butter and sliced bread to make your own piece. Because I was wearing a rather tight outfit and didn't want to shove my face with carbs, I skipped the bread and went straight for the roasted garlic. Maybe if I hadn't had a bf I wouldn't of done that Lol. Whatever, it was yummy! \n\nThe servers were friendly and helpful, and I liked that they had a jukebox with a wide selection of the bands I liked. The sad part is that we couldn't hear any of our songs where we were sitting...maybe they should slightly up the volume? \n\nAll in all, it's a very tasty pizza spot if you can get in!", "author": "Sonya D."}

After hearing all the ranting and raving reviews from all my friends and coworker, I have to say I was overall disappointed. We ended up getting the plain deep dish pizza and some chicken wings. Ok the wings were pretty good. They were black pepper galore :) I loved it. Medium sized wings with pretty juicy too. Nothing covered in oil or anything like that.\n\nThe pizza on the other hand was just so so. I have only been to a couple other places that specialize in deep dish pizza. The crust was flavorless and a little too hard. The sauce not so good imo. More like I was eating bread with some sauce on it and some cheese.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-16", "description": "Little Star first introduced me to the world of deep dish pizza and I sure did want to stay a while! Since the pizzas are about an inch thick, a small 9\" one can feed a few. Who cares how many calories are in each slice? You can't stop after just one so you might as well go all the way (I was only able to eat 2 slices btw). \n\nBrass Monkey ($18, off the menu) - The ricotta and feta cheeses made this pizza special. It had a creamier texture and was mouth-watering with the spinach, mushrooms, onions, garlic, and of course sausage. It was amazing how much they were able to fit on top of that crust. Totally to die for! \n\nClassic ($17.50) - This one was similar to the Brass Monkey but used regular mozzarella cheese, excluded garlic, and subbed the spinach for green bell peppers. Another successful concoction but I preferred the first one...the green peppers just didn't go very well with all that sauce. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/__I9HmtBMV4dDkEgT22V4g?select=7sVx0VbtFsx2tba66gBABA)\n\nThe best part about these pizzas was the generous heaping of chunky tomato sauce that topped everything off. So fresh, tangy, and just oh-so-perfect. The crunchy, buttery crust that kept the pizza intact was incredible as well. Mmmm!\n\nI wouldn't be able to eat this all the time but everyone needs an indulgence at Little Star once in a while. Be sure to call ahead if you are planning to pick up your order since they take around 30-40 min to make. \n\nHope your first deep dish pizza experience will be as unforgettable as mine!", "author": "Karen Y."}

After an \"SF short\" walk (usually translating to 6 blocks too long to me) of 8 city blocks, I gratefully slipped into the door of Little Star Pizza to try to warm my nearly immobile fingers and toes.\n\nA kitchen error resulted in an extra 15 minute wait on top of the 20 it usually takes for a deep dish to come out of the pizza oven, but the silver lining manifested itself in the form of a complimentary order of chicken wings promptly brought to our table. I can't say for certain whether it was the wonderfully flavorful spices, the abundantly juicy meat, or the on-the-house value that amped up my enjoyment of these, but this chicken was the best I've had in a long time.\n\nInstead of 7x7's recommended Little Star deep dish pizza (spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, garlic), we opted for the Classic (a more mainstream combination of sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bells) as the prospect of a meatless pizza didn't entirely appeal to us that night.\n\nThis double layered pizza certainly didn't skimp on the cheese, and the gooey spread was blanketed by a generous layer of toppings and finished with warm tomato sauce. What really stood out was not what was on the pizza itself, but what the pizza lay on top of. The cornmeal crust was absolutely my favorite part of the meal, and the homey, nutty flavor complemented the rest of the dish surprisingly well.\n\nThough I had hoped my first experience with Chicago deep dish pizza would be in Chicago itself, I'm more than certain that this San Francisco take is a worthy comparison.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

I couldn't resist the temptation of devouring one of the most delicious creations in SF.  Chicago deep dish, watch your back. Little Star Pizza won't go down without a fight.      \n\nTo die for pizza:       \n- Brass monkey (secret menu item): The Little Star (spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, garlic) with sausage  \n- Mediterranean Chicken - Chicken breast, artichoke hearts, red bell peppers, green olives, onions, feta\n\nLittle Star Pizza creates some delicious pies that pack some serious punch.  I'm really at a loss for words when I try to describe the gloriousness of their pizza.  The deep dish pizza is cheesy, loaded with toppings and covered with a layer of chunky tomato sauce.  But the real kicker is the crispy cornmeal crust.  The texture of the crust is well balanced with the spectacular flavors of the toppings.  Be prepared - it will knock your socks off!  \n\nIt was a pretty standard wait time for two deep dish pizzas.  The service was great - we were seated almost immediately and our waiter was attentive.  The vibe I got from this LSP location was equivalent to a dive bar - relaxed atmosphere, dim lighting, and chill music.  A perfect place to kick back after a long day to enjoy some cold brewskies and unforgettable pizza.    \n\nConsider yourself warned: CASH ONLY!!!\n\nBrass Monkey deep dish at Little Star Pizza - check! I can officially die happy.", "author": "Ashley O."}

Little Star, you made that happen! My heart still has a place for Zachary's but Little Star's crust really is something else. \nMy group of 11 came here on a Saturday night and the wait wasn't too bad (20 mins or so). The waitress let us order ahead of time so that by the time we'd be seated, our pizzas will be out. We ordered the classic and vegetarian deep dish pizzas and two other regular pizzas that I forgot. I have heard about their delicious corn meal crust and the hype is true: the crust REALLY is worth the wait. I know people complain about crispy crusts but that's the key to my heart. The pizzas aren't overly drenched with tomato sauce and they've also mastered cheese proportions. Since we had a large group, the waitress made sure our pizzas were double sliced so that each person can try a pizza option more than once. Neat! The waitress was incredibly attentive and came by enough times to make sure we were taken care of. This truly was one of the better service experiences I've encountered in San Francisco. \nBONUS: I didn't realize they had a location in the East Bay so I'll definitely stop by there for my next pizza craving!", "author": "Annah L."}

Living in Hawaii and trying other poor examples of the doughy mess I had come to know as deep dish disaster pizza,  my bar for what constitutes good deep dish was set pretty low as is.\n\nThough Friday night was probably not the best night to attempt to dine here without reservations as upon arrival we were warned the wait for a table for 2 would be 30 to 40 minutes.  This was not surprising because 1 - it *was* Friday night and 2 - I had seen studio apartments in Hawaii that rivalled the dining area of this restaurant.\n\nMy friend promised it was worth the wait so we grabbed a couple of drinks from the bar, grabbed a menu to peruse and discuss while seated in the waiting area... er... blue comfy chairs in the corner.\n\nWe eventually settled on the Little Star with sausage added. When we gave our order to the hostess (who kindly and wisely advised us to place our order with her first in order to minimize our wait time) she told us that we had inadvertently stumbled on a \"secret\" menu item. Allegedly the brass monkey earned its name as the most frequently ordered menu item by one of the Beastie Boys.\n\nSatisfied with our ordering prowess but dissatisfied with our empty wine glasses we ventured back to the bar for refills.  Luckily as we made our way through the dinner crowd two bar seats opened up.  Happily seated at the bar with a carafe of water and bottle of wine planted in front of us, I have no clue how long our wait actually was.  Whatever the length of time, it was most definitely worth it.\n\nOur pizza eventually arrived from the kitchen and was a perfect circle of mostly red with a golden brown crust outline.  I was immediately apprehensive because it seemed to be the epitome of everything I dislike in a pizza - excessive sauce and overly doughy crusts.  However the moment that first bite hit my lips all was forgiven. The sauce was amazing! Perfectly seasoned and not at all runny. Oh and the crust! I admit, I can be a bit of a crust snob and was certainly expecting to find an uncooked doughy disaster underneath all the topping but I was thrilled that these expectations were proven wrong.  The crust was crispy but not uncomfortably crunchy and overall the pizza just had wonderful flavors!\n\nOverall despite the Friday night rush of people and the inevitable wait because of it, the service was still great and the food was amazing!

We were told by the hostess that the wait would be 40 minutes but since all the parties ahead of us had at least 4 people in their groups we were seated at a small 2 person table in the corner of the restaurant within 10 minutes. \n\nWhen it comes to food my friend is very boring. He hates almost everything (except cheese and meat), and orders everything plain. He is not a big fan of deep dish pizza because he feels like there is always way too much sauce and not enough cheese. Since he is a big cheese and meat fanatic we ordered a large pizza with extra mozzarella, feta, gorgonzola, ricotta, pepperoni, salami, and sausage. It took about 20 minutes for our pizza to be prepared and brought out to our table. When the waiter brought it to us he said \"This has to be the cheesiest pizza I have ever seen leave our kitchen\". I actually think this was the cheesiest pizza I have ever eaten. Every bite had tons and tons of melted cheese in it. \n\nAs I said before my friend does not like anything so when I suggested we add pesto sauce to our pizza he looked at me as if I was crazy (he is so boring) so once our pizza was brought to us I asked the waiter for a side of the sauce. Even without the pesto sauce this pizza was great but with the sauce it was phenomenal. I really can't think of a better tasting pizza. \n\nOur pizza came to about 30 dollars but considering all the toppings we added it was not bad. Our waiter was amazing too. He kept our water glasses full, made sure we had lots of napkins (we needed them), and checked in on us every few minutes to make sure we had everything we needed. \n\nIf your ever find yourself in the city by the bay make sure you check out little star, I know you will love it.", "author": "Craig R."}

We were greeted almost as soon as we were seated and our first round of drinks arrived in less than a minute. We always had a full pitcher of water at our table throughout the meal.\n\nWe started with the caprese salad which was great. Very fresh ingredients. Fresh mozzarella and tomatoes served in a tasty olive oil and vinegar blend with olives and a couple pieces of bread. Definitely the perfect light appetizer to precede a very heavy entree. \n\nFor dinner we got a deep dish pizza with meatballs (which were a special, not on the normal menu), peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini. I am obsessed with pizza, so I would say this meal appeals to me more than most. But that being said, this was one of the best meals I've ever had. I could taste the freshness of the ingredients. There cornmeal crust was crispy and flavorful. For a deep dish pizza, there was a great balance of sauce to cheese to toppings. Everything about it was delicious.\n\nFor the quality and amount of food you can get, the price is very reasonable.

Because I love it that much.\n\nHere are 5 reasons Little Star gets 5 stars:\n\n1) Bomb. Diggity. Thin. Crust.  Period.  It's not like a Delarosa or Tony's type of paper-thin crust.  Instead, it has a crunchy bottom that's firm and doesn't wilt under the weight of the toppings.\n\n2) Speaking of toppings, stringy cheese.  Without it, pizza just isn't good (hear that, Domino's?).  Oh, and lots of fresh toppings.  FRESH.\n\n3) Not sure if it's because it was Labor Day weekend or whatnot, but I found parking half a block away.  This is a major win in my book.\n\n4) GARLIC BREAD.  Please get this.  At first you may be like, wtf they just gave me a loaf of sourdough bread, a thing of butter and a half head of garlic.  I didn't realize that it was DIY garlic bread.  But then you get a bit of that roasted garlic clove on the bread and you'll be ready to ward off vampires.  But it's so, so worth it.\n\n5) Takes credit cards, nice service, plus a cute restaurant.  Not much more you can ask for, right?\n\nSo there you have it, folks.

The pizza crust tastes like cornbread, and it's amazing.  Now imagine throwing in a deep dish of ingredients and cooking the combination to perfection.  Awesome.\n\nThe interior was a little bit ominous and gloomy looking, but some would probably see it as romantic.  I called in for a pickup, and they gave me a very narrow time estimate (thirty minutes on the dot), and when I got there in thirty-one minutes, voila, there sat my pizza, waiting to be taken, and eaten.\n\nService there is really nice and friendly, and I would definitely hit up Little Star Pizza to sit down and enjoy the food and atmosphere.\n\nI got the Little Star, which comes packed with spinach, ricotta, feta, mushrooms, onions, and garlic, all topped with a generous helping of tomato sauce slathered on top.  For a pizza with this many ingredients, you'd be paying the same price at a Pizza Hut or Papa John's, but for lower quality.  The pizza itself was great.  I think the feta was a little bit overpowering, as it tends to be, but overall, a great title pizza.\n\nI recommend letting the pizza rest a little bit before you dive in.  I know, it's difficult because it smells so freaking good.  But if you eat it immediately, the slice gets difficult to manage from all the melting ingredients and still-flexible bottom crust.  When you let it rest, the bottom crust hardens a little bit, and all the toppings don't come avalanching down when you pick up a slice.\n\nIn summary, Little Star Pizza shines brightly in a city inundated by a sea of pizza joints.\n\nGET:  Any Deep Dish Specialty Pizza", "author": "Michael K."}

I heard from the reviews here that this place had a romantic vibe so I brought the wifey with me here for lunch. Maybe it was because it was lunch, and broad daylight, but I didn't really catch that vibe.\n\nWe arrived to find the place empty except for one group of people who were already seated. I was surprised because I've heard that the wait time can get very long. We ordered some beers on tap, the spicy  chicken wing appetizer, and the small classic combo+pepperoni.\n\nThe chicken wings weren't very memorable, I could probably do without them next time. But I didn't count it against this place because you obviously don't come here to eat chicken wings. The wait for our pizza was roughly 30 min. I was so excited when it arrived because I love Chicago style pizza and I don't get to eat it hardly enough.\n\nThe small was perfect for us, about 6 slices, and we split it right down the middle. All the ingredients in this pizza married well for a symphony of tastes and textures. The flavor of the meats were robust but not muted by a red sauce that was overbearing and dense. The red sauce, although at first glace looked heavy, was actually really light and had a hint of sweetness to it. Simply delicious. You can tell too that they use only fresh, quality mozzarella simply by the way it melts away and gets super stringy. \n\nAnd lastly the wonderful, buttery, cornmeal crust. Now let me tell you something about me. I'm the kind of person that hates crust. I don't eat the crust on my sliced bread and I hardly ever eat the crust on my pizzas as well. But lemme tell you, the crust on this pizza was so flaky and buttery, I could eat a whole damn pizza of just that crust. It's that delicious! Now I never been to the other Bay Area's claim to fame Chicago pizza joint in Berkeley, Zachary's, but until I can judge firsthand myself and determine otherwise, Little Star pizza rules the roost when it comes to Chicago style pizza.

We got there around 7 on a Saturday night and ordered some root beers to get us through the 20-minute wait. We sat at a high top right next to the bar. Don't expect roominess and comfort here, unless you're at the room, which is apparently offers the most elbow room out of the entire place. \n\nWe placed an order for a half Classic (sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bells) and half Mediterranean Chicken (Chicken breast, artichoke hearts, red bells, green olives, onions, feta). We had ordered a couple of root beers and it was perfect. The Classic was way better than the Chicken, so I'd go with that next time. The pizza came out to about $21 with tax. The crust was good, but greasier than Zachary's, and we had to wait entirely too long (it was like 25 minutes) for a small pizza and like no appetizers. We both were comfortably full, and had two slices left between us. And it was entirely way too noisy in there for a conversation. I was pretty much yelling the whole time. So it's good if you're with a bad date and you don't really care what they're yapping about anyway.\n\nTIPS: Don't go with a large group, go early, and sit at the bar or at the high-tops.

Little Star doesn't take reservations, and is not an ideal place for parties larger than 6.  Most tables fit 4, but bigger party = more varieties of pizza, right?  That was my mentality coming into this.  With a party of 8, we ordered 3 pizza's: the classic, the pesto chicken thin crust which we made into a deep dish, a thin crust vegetarian piece w/ feta, and chicken wings!

It's of a different caliber and style.  We ordered the Classic Deep Dish (with sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bells).  The tomato sauce on it was plentiful, but light at the same time - chunky and fresh, it didn't taste heavily processed and heavy, as other places tend to make their pizzas.  The sausage also seemed fresh with fennel and a tinge of spice.  Damn, it was good.  \n\nMy friends knew about my aversion to deep dish pizza, and also ordered a Pesto Chicken Thin Crust pizza for me.  Ironically/sadly, I didn't enjoy this as much as I enjoyed the Classic Deep Dish.  This is a dry pizza comparatively, and I wished that there could have been some tomato sauce on this.\n\nWe started the meal with the Garlic Bread:  warm sourdough served with butter (blended with perhaps sour cream?) AND the best part.....  a bulb \nof roasted garlic.  I was trying to dig every last bit of garlicy goodness from the bulb, layering it on heavy on the bread, and on my pizza crust.  Yep...

The guy on the phone said that's fine and to head over. \n\nI was very excited to eat here since I've read the reviews and everyone is raving about it. When my boyfriend and I got the restaurant it wasn't what I expected. The ambiance was very chic. It was dimly lit with some heavy black curtains by the windows. There were some art on the walls for sale and I thought that was pretty cool. The host tells me there's a 10-15 minute wait and I said that's fine as long as we will still get served. The place was packed by the way; I got even more excited.\n\nThen everything after we got seated went downhill. After the host showed us to our table he didn't give us any menus or asked if we wanted to start with anything to drink or even said \"your server will be right wit you.\" I guess I'm just anal since I studied hospitality management. After 5-7 minutes with no menu or water, I finally flagged someone down and asked for the menu. I tried to ask for water, but the guy did the raise-one-finger motion; which I really didn't like. It took a couple more minutes for our menu and five more minutes after that to get our waters.\n\nOur server finally came and asked us if we were ready to order since the kitchen will be closing. In my head I'm like we've been sitting here for almost 20 minutes and no one stopped and asked us if we were ready to order. On the other hand, the food was great. We had the classic deep dish which is a cornmeal deep dish crust filled with sausage, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms. It was DELISH. I had Patxi's before and I would prefer Little Star's pizza over theirs. I think it has a good crust to sauce to cheese to toppings ratio. I would definitely buy pizza here again, maybe for pick-up.

After looking on Yelp and seeing this place serves Deep Dish Pizza (similar to Chicago style), we decided we had to try!  Great little restaurant, which we happened to get there at perfect timing before the crowd started rolling in (5pm).  We ordered a Pepperoni Dish Dish.  Takes 30 minutes to make-- but that is typical and expected for this type of meal.  Service was great.  Has a juke box to listen to some music. Meal was great, however nothing to compare to Chicago.  The crust was almost like a Fried Cornmeal.  However, for a deep dish pizza on this side of the coast, it's great to get your fix.  I saw a few people order the salad and garlic bread near by and that looked great too.\n\nWould recommend to go in if in area, just not something I would go to over and over again (if that even makes sense)?", "author": "Sara S."}

So it's safe to say, we know good pizza.  \n\nWe really like their deep dish.  It is so incredibly flavorful.  The sauce is on point -- the right amount of salt and sweetness, and full of chunky tomatoes.  Their veggies are fresh and delicious.  Their sausage and pepperoni will make you wonder why you ever considered being vegetarian.  Their crust is crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, made with a yummy cornmeal flour.  It's not at all greasy.  \n\nWe aren't a big fan of their thin crust, however.  It was ok, but not memorable.  I make a mean thin crust at home, so the standard is high for us.\n\nTheir mixed salad is really good, if you're into rabbit food.  The vegetables are so fresh, full of perfectly ripe tomatoes and other goodies.\n\nIf you're into deep dish pizza, give this place a shot... it's delicious!", "author": "Jade F."}

However, I would say that this location actually has a harder time getting people seated and through the door. Most often, my group has to wait 1+ hrs just to get seated (during peak hours). However, I would say that waiting for that amount of time is WORTH IT! I would say that you have to start with a plate (or two) of their wings before you start to eat their delicious pizza. Their thin crust is really good but I wouldn't come here for the thin crust. I only come here for the deep dish. I absolutely love the corn meal crust and their sausage. \n\nThe only gripe about this place is that they CHOOSE not to allow refillable fountain drinks. It doesn't cost much to get a soda fountain and maintaining and replenishing it is cost effective. If people want the bottled sodas, then let that be an option but don't deny people the deliciousness that comes with drinking unlimited coke with their pizza.", "author": "Rylan C."}

The garlic bread particularly, because it comes out warm with a side of fresh baked garlic and butter.

The pizza was awesome and we're both huge fans of deep dish pizza. \n\nNow, I don't know how many other people who have tried Patxis and Zachary's but Little Star Pizza's deep dish is slightly different. Both Patxi's and Zachary's deep dish pizza crust are a bit softer and chewier in comparison and Little Star Pizza's cheese is much stretchier and more chewy. I'm not trying to say who is better because simply put, it's in a different ball park when it comes to deep dish. It's good in a different way. \n\nThe tomato sauce isn't too much to handle, the toppings are just right, the crust is crunchy and the cheese is chewy- it is GREAT pizza. \n\nWe also tried the spicy wings- they were ok - I wouldn't recommend them especially to anyone. \n\nThe staff were friendly and helpful, the place was clean, and there was no wait because we went on a weekday and it was at 5pm. \n\nParking may be a little hard to find and it sucks because most parking around the area is limited to 1 hour max (meter parking) and you have to keep running back to feed the meter.\n\nOverall, it's worth it- I really liked the pizza and would love to go back for more.\n\nNote: Deep dish pizza takes about 30mins to make so just an FYI", "author": "Kelly Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-07", "description": "I kept hearing from friends and colleagues that this place has the best chicago-style deep dish pizza. Having lived in the midwest and eaten lots of good Gino's East and Giordano's pies, I'm always up to finding more chicago style pizzas in the bay area. I have tried Zachary's, Patxy's and now Little Star.\n\nI ordered a Classic deep dish pizza at Little Star. It was just not a very good pie and didn't have the authentic heartiness that Chicago pie has. Crust was too dry and seemed overcooked. I like cornmeal crust and this light crust wasn't recognizable as cornmeal. The tomato sauce lacked proper herbs and seasoning and as a result overwhelmed all other toppings with more acidity than a good pizza sauce should have. The flavor of the cheese wasn't there either. A good Chicago pie has flavor depth and heartiness - and this pie lacked both. \n\nThe service veered towards neglectful rather than attentive. Our waiter (though seemed nice at first) didn't say much outside of taking our order and didn't check in with us while we waited for 30-40 minutes for the pie. The two other people who dropped off our pie and check were the same - just dropped things off with not much explanation and disappeared.\n\nI came to this restaurant with high expectations due to all the word-of-mouth recommendations and the good yelp reviews. I really wanted to like Little Star because having more places to go to is always a great thing. Unfortunately, Zachary's in Oakland is much better than Little Star even though Zachary's is not by any means the model of a great Chicago style pizza. I didn't expect the bay area to have a lot of good Chicago style pizzas but it disappointed me to find Little Star to be overhyped and under-delivered. \n\nIf the restaurant is reading this review, I would really hope that they do something about the sauce. Zachary's actually used to have a very fresh style sauce that had quite a bit of acidity and they recently improved their sauce to cut down on the acidity and brings out more flavor. Gino East's pizza in Chicago also has a cornmeal crust and is probably similar to Little Star - if I were this restaurant's owner/chef, I would consider tasting Gino East's pizza (which can be shipped frozen to everywhere now) and see why an authentic Chicago pie has so much flavor and soul.", "author": "Quynh T."}

That, and flavorful crust that's crispy and still delicious by the time you reach the end of your slice.  It was kind of like eating a cheesy thin breadstick that you buy in packages.

To be fair, I ate two pieces of the thin crust before even touching the deep dish, so it was a bit cold and I was already full.  I'm willing to give it another shot later this summer since they have that killer half off pizza deal if you order an appetizer!  \n\nIt was also nice that the restaurant itself had very San Franciscan touches.

I'm convinced that all good things are worth the wait, and everyone seems to pee themselves when it comes to Little Star pizza, so I was determined to see what the fuss was about. So we put our names down and went to Mini Bar across the street to have a few drinks to while away the time.\n\nWe came back and within a few minutes, we were seated and ordering pizza. I could talk about the salad and the beer we ordered, but let's cut to the chase. Classic deep dish and Mediterranean chicken deep dish pizzas were ordered. And when they arrived, I almost died. \n\nI firmly believe that the crust is the heart of the pizza, and if the crust is bad, the pizza isn't really worth eating. I was pretty much blown away. The crust is amazing, and unlike anything I've had anywhere else. It's so crispy and delicious, and I really can't get over it. I ate a bajillion slices and took some home because I was just completely flabbergasted at how good their crust was. \n\nThis place blows Patxi's out of the water.

I know, right!?\n\nThe pizza was delicious and while not quite as filling as some of the other reviews indicate it was still filling.  The crust was awesome, the cheese plentiful and gooey, the sauce was just good.\n\nI would skip the 9\" pizza even if ordering just for yourself.  I read the other reviews that made each slice sound gargantuan and should have known better.  Typical of most yelp reviewers they were delusional.  The slices are plenty filling, but I ate all but 1 slice of the 9\" pizza.  Not leaving me enough to satisfy the next day.\n\nLSP had a decent ambiance but again the delusional here seem to think it is a great date spot.  I would avoid taking a date here, at least not if you haven't been dating a while.  This place is to noisy to have any kind of conversation or to get to know someone without yelling.\n\nThe service was pretty good.  They were friendly and didn't mess my order up(something I consider to be a required minimum not worthy of a star), but i called ahead for pick up and was told it would be 30 minutes.  It took just shy of 40.  It wasn't a horrible delay and I was in no rush and would rather get the pizza late and just from the oven than have it only take 20 and be ten minutes old when I show up to pick it up.  That said many of the reviews here indicate that they are busy and they should have been able to anticipate based on how busy the place was when I showed up that it would take more than 30 minutes.\n\nThe pizza was not cheap, but was more filling than the usual 'Za and was delicious.  If you are on a budget or just looking for something cheap it's not the place for you.  Not cheap but a decent value for the fillingness and delicousness of the pizza.\n\nIf you are the typical yelper you would probably consider this a 5 star place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-05-25", "description": "First off, huge kudos to all of the staff, from the host who courteously and patiently kept us updated on the substantial waiting list, to the awesome girl at the take-out bar and to Patrick, our waiter.  Based on the plethora of 5-star reviews and the considerable delay for a table, I anticipated nothing less than the \"Soup Nazi\" treatment from the staff; I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nMy buddy and I were wisely advised by the many reviews here, to pre-order the deep-dish pizza in advance, since it takes 35 minutes to prepare.  This was good planning, as we were famished, and luckily we got a table at just around the 30 minute mark; pizza arrived about 10 minutes later.  So we ordered a couple of appetizers to share, including their Spicy Chicken Wings (not to be confused for Buffalo style), and the Caprese salad, the latter of which was the highlight of the menu.  The chicken wings could best be described as gummy, but somewhat tasty; certainly no more appealing than what you can get at Original Buffalo Wings further down Divisadero at Lombard Ave... I think we ate about three of them, and tossed the rest.\n\nBut really, it's about the pizza.  If this represents the best that San Francisco has to offer, then by all means avoid the city like the plague when you have a pizza craving.  While the pie was hearty and loaded with all the stuff your cardiologist warned you about, it wasn't worth the indulgence.  Sausage that tasted on the verge of its expiration date, ditto for the pepperoni; a lumpy layer of acidic and metallic-tasting tomato sauce; chicken that was roasted to dry flavorless-ness; and a dry cornmeal crust that reminded me of muffins that were on the clearance rack at Safeway.  I think if we weren't nearly starving by the time  this pie was served, this wreck would have gone back to the kitchen for a re-do.  It was edible in a pinch, but barely so.\n\nAgain, thank you to all the staff for being courteous.  We tipped 20%, but it would have been nice if the waiter actually asked or cared about the mediocrity he served, but I think he already knew.  Stick to North Beach; there are a handful of places that can make a reasonably tasty pie, even if its only thin-crust.", "author": "Brian B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-27", "description": "You must be my Little Star\n'cause you shine on me even though you're far\nI just think of you and I start to grow\nAnd I need your special pie\nAnd baby, you know...\n\nFor my 400th review - count 'em 400 (...and I do get depressed thinking of all the time I could have spent solving world peace) - I decided to review Little Star Pizza because I had never tried it before last evening. Ever since I saw Nish wax on about it on \"Check Please! Bay Area\", I had been curious what the fuss was all about. But like many who caught sight of the place from the outside, I merely shrugged at the sight of the waiting throngs.\n\nYesterday was a particularly blustery day, and Little Star was not even our first choice. I had actually been meaning to try the bar burger at NOPA. Even though both places open at 5PM, NOPA doesn't serve food until 6, so alas, that will have to wait for another time. Even at a scant 2 1/2 blocks between establishments, it was like barreling through a wind tunnel on Divisadero, though I was heartened to see that Lilly's Bar-B-Q finally replaced their old Brothers-in-Law sign.\n\nIf you wait about ten minutes before 5, you get the privilege of waiting in the little cove of a doorway. One by one, the staff - all very skinny and on bicycles (...I hate them) - give the secret knock and enter the door, as we shiver in the cold wind. Jamie W. and I got dibs on the table next to jukebox. No reason except it provided a bit more light than the ones in the back, and we ended up dodging a bullet when a gaggle of shrieking, South Asian girls galumphed toward the back... apparently to raise the decibel level of the place several inches.\n\nWe were hungry, famished really, so we ordered the $8 Spicy Chicken Wings as an appetizer. Unlike those served at honky-tonk bars across this great land of ours, these were blessedly not greasy, and the spiciness provided a great kick even when doused in the cooling blue cheese dressing. I would have licked the ramekin dry had I not realized I was in public. Oh...and I ate the accompanying mini-carrot sticks so I could pretend I had a vegetable.\n\nGiven the excessive protein content of our appetizer, we went for the small Little Star Special ($17), a smart choice as it turns out. I refuse to call it Chicago-style pizza since a meal at Giordano's or Gino's East could hardly be more different. First, the crust was a lot lighter and crunchier than a standard-issue deep-dish pizza with a cornmeal flavor and consistency similar to what they served at Nancy's in Chicago.\n\nSecond, the filling was a lot fresher-tasting, not the heavy tomato sauce I would normally associate with deep-dish pizza. In fact, the fresh tomatoes used in the sauce moistened the bottom just enough to make the crust that much easier to chew without overwhelming it. The equally fresh spinach had obviously been reduced and then mixed with ricotta, feta and sauteed onions. The combination was ideal, and if a deep-dish pizza could ever taste light, they actually achieve that objective here.\n\nI like the place, even though it was a bit too trendy-dark for my taste. Definitely go as early as you can to avoid the inevitable wait. But if you wait, rest assured, your patience will be rewarded. This is one place where the hype may actually be warranted because...\n\nPie light, pie bright, first pie I ate tonight\nPie light, [Pie bright!] makes everything all right\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...worthy of the hype, at least as far as the Little Star Special and chicken wings are concerned\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...a bit dark, a bit crowded..but a warmish, welcome vibe all things considered\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...fast and unobtrusive...perhaps to increase turnover but met my needs for a relatively quick meal\nTOTAL - 5 stars...Nish is right yet again", "author": "Ed U."}

But not just any pizza..a chicago style pizza~!! So after reading all the wonderful things everyone had to say about Little Star we headed towards there. But since I was not smart enough to read the times of the restaurant, when we got there they were not open yet...OMG~!! -_- \n\nSo after heading towards Japantown for a little while we came back and sure enough 10min after they opened, the place was almost packed. Luckily we got a seat and remember i think it might be best to sit towards the wall or towards the back cause I noticed that if you sit in the center the wind might get to you whenever the door opens.\n\nAnyhow, we started off with the chicken wings, which were not spicy just a bit of mild spice to it. They were a little salty for me but quite tastey. The wings were a good size, not too big so you dont get full but not too small where all you are eating is bone and skin. Furthermore it takes the Pizzas about 30min+ to be done so you might as well order something to chew on if your hungry like a salad or the wings are quite good..I wouldnt suggest the garlic bread cause bread will make you full and you wont be able to enjoy the full extent of your pizza with bread in your tummay~ \n\nSo after a bit of time, the pizzas showed up..and yes I said Pizzas with an S. We ordered the Classic and the Mediterranean. Are we crazy? No....well maybe just a little bit..\nThe Mediterranean was good, artichokes and olives might offset a bit of flavor for some, and the chicken was grilled. Overall quite yummy~\nThe Classic is by far my favorite. If you enjoy meat you have to order the Classic..hahaha i ate like 5 pieces overall but i think i could of finished that Classic myself...the crust was nice and crunchy towards the end, the toppings were great especially with all the tomato sauce on top and the cheese, it would just pull forever lol.\n\nOverall, this was a success~ as a matter of fact I am having some of those leftovers right now kakakaka~ yay~ o before i go, they dont accept credit cards so if you come in big groups remember to bring enough cash~", "author": "phillip w."}

Since pizza isn't the healthiest of dining options, a salad also found its way into our order.  Although it's not your typical bowl of greens, their Caprese salad was really good - the mozzarella tasted fresh and had some quality to it.  In fact, I've already decided it'll be ordered again next time.\n\nAs for their pizza, we ordered their thin crust, half White Pie and half Veggie.  Didn't get a chance to try the Veggie side, but the White Pie was also vegetarian and pretty damn good.  I did find myself missing some hearty meat however, so I may have to look into their Italian Combo or Pesto Chicken next time.  The only problem that I had with our pizza was that the crust was a bit softer than I would have liked for a thin crust.

Regardless, it was lovely and delicious.\n\n\n\nFast forward to Little Star.  A friend of mine heard our travel story and was delighted to inform us about Little Star.  And seriously? We cannot explain why we've been missing out on this for years. It was AMAZING!\n\nThe place was packed when we arrived, but they had one table for two tucked away in a back corner.  We were hesitant-since a busy restaurant and a tucked away table usually means you're often forgotten.  But at Little Star, our every need was met before we even knew we needed it!  The staff was super friendly and attentive, and extremely helpful in explaining the menu\n\nAnd the food. WOW!  Really fantastic.  We had the garlic bread appetizer-and the bread was fresh, the garlic perfectly roasted, and pretty much it was perfect.  \n\nThe pizza was ridiculous.  By far my favorite Bay Area pizza now.  Perfectly balanced with fresh ingredients, sauce to cheese ratio, everything.  We dipped our cornmeal crusts in the housemade bleu cheese dressing-which was divine.\n\nBasically, we've found yet another reason to have us cross the bridge and get our noms on in SF.

The take out counter people were very friendly and the wait for our pizza was only 20 minutes!\n\nMediterranean Chicken - chicken breast, artichoke hearts, red bell peppers, green olives, onions, feta.  Very good!  All ingredients went well together and didn't overpower each other (I was worried about the olives because they were cut bigger than normal, the artichoke hearts which can be tart & the feta which is just strong in general).  I couldn't taste the feta distinctively in any bite so they must incorporate it throughout the sauce.  Overall, a very unique pizza and delight to eat.\n\nPesto Chicken - pesto, roasted chicken, mushrooms, onions.  This was okay.  The pesto is very lightly distributed on the pizza.  Tasted generic.\n\nSpicy Chicken Wings - pound of wings served with baby carrots and blue cheese dressing.  Chicken wasn't very spicy.  They give you 5 pieces of baby carrots.  Nothing special.\n\nDon't get me wrong.

Little Star does not disappoint.\n\nHer and I shared a small deep dish with roasted garlic, spinach and tomatoes (a twist on our old favorite from Lamonica's in Westwood). The small is definitely big enough for two people, so don't be tempted by the low marginal cost of upgrading to the large.\n\nThe pizza here is like no pizza I've ever had before. The crust is crunchy; it kind of reminded me of a graham cracker. Other Chicago style pizza I've had has way more crust, which in my mind is a waste of space. Little Star wastes no time getting to the good stuff. Their sauce is really tasty, perfectly spiced and perfectly thick. The roasted garlic is a great topping choice, as it adds depth to the overall flavor of the pie. The cheese is tasty and melted perfectly. However, if I could go back, I probably wouldn't get the tomatoes as a topping, because they just put one slice of tomato on top of each slice of pizza; there's much better value to be had with another topping.\n\nLittle Star offers one of the best pizza meals I've had in a while.

The pizza looked very typical, but it tasted super delicious! The amount of tomato sauce was perfect and it had a little spice in it. It was hot, gooey and surprisingly not messy at all (well, I ordered a small). But other than that, I ate half of the small pizza myself, and it was a lot of delicious goodness.

This experience was much better. The pizza was as good as I remembered it being in the past and the entire staff was very friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nUpdate: One of the owners of Little Star was kind enough to send me a polite and professional message apologizing for his employees childish and uncalled for behavior and she has been terminated.  For this I'll up the star count\n\n---------------------\nService: 1 star\nFood: 3 Stars\n\nIf you flip through my reviews I generally stay away from writing nasty passive aggressive shit about a business; especially a small local business and especially because so many of my friends in the service industry loath yelp because of these types of reviews. Anyways, I seriously doubt this one bad review will sway anyone away from eating at this over-rated pizzeria but here we go...\n\nBased on the few times I've ordered pies from here to-go in the past, I've liked their pizza and I would generally recommend LS to people as one of the better pizza joints in SF. Last night however changed my mind and was a completely different story. \n\nI don't think the beyond-rude-horrible service had anything to do with swaying my taste buds, but the pizza just tasted below average at best if not kinda funky. I hope the rude waitress didn't spit in it.\n\nThe do-it-yourself garlic bread wasn't my cup of tea and again, the service was beyond excusable. I have no idea why we felt obligated to tip our rude waitress? This was the first time in my life I've ever decided to tip under 20%. My friends and I ALWAYS tip at least 20% or higher. I'm sure her jaw dropped when she saw any tip at all on the table after her beyond horrible display of service.\n\nI on the other hand was super polite and friendly to the staff, kept my iPhone in my pocket and politely ordered without asking any annoying or obnoxious questions besides *POLITELY* asking them to please place the sausage so it stays on my half of the pizza because my friend is a vegetarian. I don't consider this to be a strange request in a city full of vegetarians and I'm sure I'm not the fist or last person to make this very simple request. \n\nThe waitress on the other hand completely ignored us in every step of the process. I'm amazed she even took our order. I dropped my napkin and after politely asking her twice to grab me another napkin when she had a moment, I finally walked up to the counter with greasy hands and grabbed a few myself. When the bitchy waitress saw me walking back to the table with a handful of napkins, she didn't even give a flying fuck nor did she apologize for her lack of service. Besides taking our order, almost slamming me in the face with the pizza lifter thingy while placing it on the table and giving us the check which I had to flail and wave my arms to get, she didn't do jack shit. With so many people looking of work now-a-days, I'm surprised they would keep an employee like this?\n\nOk, I changed my mind, this IS a passive aggressive review and I probably should have told her on the spot, what a horrible childish bitch of a server she was and NOT tip her 15% for the crap service we received but it really didn't sink in till after I got home and started thinking about all of the rude things she did.

This place is great. Went on a fri evening, just beat the crazy rush. We got the a little before 8 and the wait was 20 min for a party of 2. At about 8:00, 10 people all walked through the door. The host told us the pizzas take 30 min to cook so we ordered while we were waiting. We got seated in about 15 min, ordered an appetizer, that took about 5 min and right when we finished it, our pizza arrived. It was deep dish, crispy thick crust, yum. We got pepperoni on the whole thing, artichoke hearts on half and roasted garlic on the other half. The garlic side was delicious. Loved the thick tomato sauce on top of the cheese. The organic beer and peach iced tea were also great. This place might not be so good for large groups, I didn't see any table that seats more than 4 besides the bar. The dim lighting and cozy tables makes this the best beer and pizza date place. Let's not forget the juke box, great selections and cheap. 3 songs for $1. Thumbs up.", "author": "Sylvia L."}

I would probably characterize it as a distant cousin, rather than a direct descendant. Or perhaps half pizza, half lasagna. I mean, the pizza is topped with tomato sauce- something i'm not a fan of, because it disguises all the yummy tantalizing toppings.\n\nHowever, I put aside my pizza purist attitude for a day at Little Star, and I'm so glad I did. There's a reason why there is often a two-hour wait for this pizza, and it's not just because the place is small. The pizza is really good. I had the Little Star pizza. Their description: Little Star - Spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions. OMG delicious!!! The ricotta and feta made the pizza just cheesy enough. Spinach and onions were fresh and tasty. Great combination. But the best part is the cornmeal crust. WOW!! It's crispy, corn-y, and really adds to the pizza. I think this is what sets Little Star apart.\n\nThe wings are not bad either. Just spicy enough, paired with a good blue cheese (but microscopic carrots.)\n\nAlso loved that they had a decent selection of beers, wine, and some cocktails.

First of all, Little Star truly is a minute place, so on a busy night, be prepared to wait. We had a party of 10 and arrived at 6:30 on a Sunday evening, but still had an hour's wait. No worries there; there's a small dive bar across the street that happily housed us for a bit. We moseyed on back after about 45 minutes, but still had a while longer to go before getting a table. Luckily, the hostess told us we could order while waiting, which meant our pizza got out faster.\n\nWe went deep dish all the way here (except for one \"weirdo\" in our party from New York, who absolutely had to order a thin crust). The Little Star highlighted by a spinach-cheese blend was the hit of the table. Yet between that, the Veggie, and the Classic (sausage substituted with chicken), they all tasted about the same. That's a bad sign at a pizza place.\n\nThe pie crust is absolutely fantastic, if not perfectly fitting for a deep dish pizza. It's cornbread based, but I think I'll stick with traditional pizza dough, thanks. The cheese is absolutely amazing, but Little Star definitely doesn't pay enough attention to the sauce, which is really the highlight of the Chicago-style. The pizza definitely came off a little too cheesy and dry at times.\n\nIf it sounds like I'm complaining, I'm not; these are just nitpicky details. On the whole, the pizza was excellent and well worth the wait. But as a truly magnificent deep dish pizza joint? I'm going to have to vote \"no\" on that.", "author": "Jeffrey C."}

On our way out, there was a long wait.  We had the usual \"special\" which is sausage, green peppers and onions.

When the pizza came out, the aroma was definitely very appetizing.  When we finally dug in, the pizza was warm and gooey, but the thing you noticed the most was the crust.  The crust was moist, crispy still and a touch of cinnamon included.  It was the best out of the three places but the toppings seemed lackluster compared to the crust.  The crust seemed to be the redeeming feature of LIttle Star.

There was lots of good flavor from the onions and bells, though the meat and mushroom flavor got a little lost in there. \n\nI never ever microwave pizza leftovers but had to since the pizza is so dense. Reason being, I don't like mushy crust. However, with this pizza, the crust stayed nice and crisp (except the bottom, which was soft but not soggy). I was impressed. The crust has a delicious olive oil taste that made the pizza heavenly. I don't ever want to have deep dish from anywhere else but Little Star.", "author": "gabby m."}

(read her very thorough review!)\n\nFirst thing I noticed here was well... the line!! Normally, I hate waiting. But their eager-to-please host more than made up for the wait by being so friendly and helpful. He let us know exactly how long the wait might be and the option to pre-order our deep-dish pizza. I appreciate good, helpful peeps... especially when I'm hungry!  \n\nThe three of us split a Caprese salad... yummy flavorful tomato slices atop fresh mozzarella. Be it on a salad or in a pizza, the mozz here rocks my world. No joke. We tried their special deep-dish (with meatballs, peppers, topped with dabs of ricotta!!) Little Star's cornmeal crust wasn't super crispy (like I had anticipated) and really held together all the ingredients. Their sauce worked well with the gooey mozz and toppings. Little Star has really edged out my past deep-dish favorites (Zachary's in Berkeley and Gino's East in Chicago).\n\nVery lively atmosphere with fun, chill patrons.

The crust was the reason for me picking Little Star over Zachary's. Little Star's crust is just more flaky and delicious, where Zachary's crust tends to be a little soggy and not as tasty. As far as the toppings and overall flavor go, they both taste similar to me with their tangy tomato sauce and cheesy/gooey insides. \n\nParking is indeed a problem for Little Star though, but definitely worth the effort.

So far I've tried the classic deep dish (sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, onions) and the Little Star (spinach, ricotta, feta, mushrooms, onions, garlic), and both were wonderful. The deep-dish crust is tall, fluffy, and flaky, in the style of Pizzeria Uno. The rest of the ingredients are fresh, ripe, rich, and perfectly done.\n\nNext time I think I'll try one of the flat pizzas, perhaps the white pie (garlic olive oil, mozzarella, zucchini, fresh tomatoes, feta). I'm curious to see how it stacks up against Slice of New York here in San Jose.\n\nThe goodness doesn't end with the pizza either. I highly recommend the caprese salad, made with perfectly-ripened tomatoes, and the garlic bread, which is actually plain bread served with a bulb of soft roasted garlic. The mood is terrific, perfect for a date with nothing but candlelight, a jukebox, and a bar lamp lighting the place.\n\nService has been excellent every time I've been here. The staff especially impressed me when I accidentally spilled my drink: Both our waiter and the bartender rushed to the table instantly to stop the spill and mop up what had already fallen.\n\nThe place has only three significant drawbacks that I've noticed. First, as some other folks have mentioned, you may need to wait a while for a table. However, you can hang out at the bar while you wait, or hop across the street to Bar 821 for a few minutes. Second, seating is pretty tight, and you may end up back-to-back with another customer. Finally, they only accept cash.

Luckily the waitress said they can do half and half, which I opted for.  \n\nI definitely liked the Little Star more than the Mediterranean Chicken.  The waitress also noted that she personally thought the Little Star was more delicious.  My friend ordered the special of the day on thin crust, and it was okay.  It had spicy sausage and broccoli raab, which was overwhelmingly bitter.  \n\nLittle Star has a pretty good selection of beer on tap.

Beware the \"fresh tomato topping\" which equates to about one half of a measly Roma tomato sliced so there is a single ring on each piece of pizza. Last I checked, Roma tomatoes max out at around 99 cents a pound, so I got royally ripped off for my half a tomato. \n\nThick Crust: very cornmealy, dry, and burnt. BLEH, they ruined one of the best parts of the pizza. There is no dough, just dry, hard junk.\n\nThe thin crust was just OK. None of the pizza is that great leftover and I think I threw away the thick crust one because the dry crust sucked even more the next day.\n\nThe pizza down the street is way better... for each slice you order you actually get two big ones.

After Little Star Pizza, I may have to rethink that philosophy.\n\nOf all the pizza variations, I've always preferred Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, and Little Star is definitely the best I've had.

A warm half-loaf of sliced sourdough, two full cloves of roasted garlic, and a ramekin of creamy butter.

Half Classic (sausage, onions, bell peppers) and half Little Star (spinach, feta, ricotta, mushrooms, onions, garlic), it came out drenched in marinara sauce on top. Anyone who has eaten at Little Star will tell you that what makes the deep-dish so damn good is the cornmeal crust. Crunchy, crispy, and buttery, the deep-dish crust is unlike anything I've ever tried in a pizza, and it's, frankly, the best pizza crust I've ever had.

The graham cracker or corn bread or whatever crust is just inexcusable. \n\nThe staff was nice and the wife claims the crust was 'OK' so I won't 1 star this place but all of you people claiming this is on par with Zachary's are just full of it. Give it up. It's not cool. \n\nForget the reviews. Just look at the name.", "author": "Thom H."}

I was expecting a cheesy pizza parlor. The setting seem more date-ish. Lights dimmed candle light dinner kind of thing. I felt kind of trapped and out of pace.\n\nAnyway, I ordered my pizza before I was seated because the hostess told me deep dish pizzas take 30 minutes to cook. When I was seated an hour later, I waited another 15 minutes for the food to come. We ordered the Little Star Deep Dish. It taste so simple and fresh. The best pizza I've ever had in my life. I don't know how I could possibly go back to pizza hut. The crust was so crispy and buttery. The cheese was cooked at the right temperature cause when I took a bite out of it the mozzarella was nice and stringy. The tomatoes were perfectly cooked. So sweet and perfectly seasoned with oregano. We ordered a large and regretted it the instant it got to the table. It's so big! I don't even think the two of us could even finish a small. We still had half the pizza left by the time we were completely full.\n\nIf you've been dying for good tasting pizza in the bay.

I've never been to chicago, so i don't know how chicago pizza is. I do not like deep dish. I much prefer THIN crust pizza.\n\nBut whoa. This blew me away!\n\nGot here on a late sunday afternoon, around 5.30pm. Parking wasn't good and had to park like 4 blocks away. It was surprisingly a full house for being 5.30pm. \n\nOrdered the garlic bread and spicy wings, which was brought out speedily.\n\nGarlic Bread, the bread was warm but nothing special. However, the butter was melted to perfection. The garlic was, well, a softened whole garlic, which is plenty for your bread and guaranteed stinky breaths!\n\nSpicy chicken wings, a good portion, I didn't count how many, but i would presume there was around 10? delicious and didn't even need the ranch! However, by the time I had finished these (shared) I was regretting the order of 2 appetisers.\n\nThe pizza took about an additional 10 minutes. I didn't think it looked big, only 12\" long (that's what she said =p) By long, i mean in diameter! But after the first slice, even if you skip the crust...you remember, it is a deep dish with an overload of ingredients on it, leaving the quest to finish the pizza to be a very daunting task. Actually, impossible after eating the two appetisers. I only managed to squeeze in 2 slices and was full for the next 12 hours. Meanwhile, my bf finished 3 slices. The pizza was indeed, very well made. The crust wasn't soggy at all. The best of the pizza was somewhat crunchy and a great foundation for the pizza. I personally preferred the Little Star, even though it lacked the meat, it was filling enough. the Mediterranean chicken had a little sourness from the artichoke and i didn't think it matched well. Overall though, incredibly well made! Water, which was essential, was refilled every so often. \n\nWhat's even more amazing was that after 3 days, I had 3 slices of pizza left. I microwaved a slice for 1 minute and toasted it in my toaster oven for another 10 minutes in 350 degree. It was still very good! Not soggy at all! Amazing!\n\nThey accept card now!!! Thank goodness! But the ATM is only $0.25 anyways.\n\n***\n\nTips: Get the little star, get the garlic bread, get the wings, dare i say one of the best wings and pizza ever! One appetizer to share, with a large pizza is enough for 2! Leftovers aren't that bad. Get half and half! Weekends, come early and you wouldn't have to wait for a seat.\n\nFavorites: Little star pizza and chicken wings!\n\nDo not want: Too full. Garlic bread was too stuffy. A little plain on the bread. I expected more?\n\nLast words: Come and get a pizza, you will not regret it!", "author": "Celine L."}

When I think of most pizza places in San Francisco, I think of hole in the wall joints, but Little Star Pizza is a hole in a wall, but extremely classy.  It has a great ambiance to it (it's small and a reservation is highly recommended) and the service is awesome.\n\nWhen I went I had 2 types of pizza.  They have a short menu of pizzas that they created, so my friend and I decided to create our own with their long list of available ingredients; they do charge per topping onto a regular cheese pizza.  The thin crust was delicious, well cooked, and tasted very fresh.  The deep dish, it was thick, but not as thick as Zachary's deep dish, but still delicious.  The best part about both were its freshness and such a great balance of flavor.\n\nLittle Star also offers alcohol so a glass or bottle of wine goes perfect with it.

After a ridiculously obnoxious experience the first time I came here, I was ready to write this place off. However, the owner saw my overtly negative review and e-mailed me to apologize for my experience--that really impressed me. Little Star is so popular that a few unhappy customers probably wouldn't make much of a difference, but I really appreciate that the owner took the time to try to make things better. That's classy.\n\nThe hostess this time was much friendlier. We arrived around 7:30 on a Sunday night, and our wait time was about half an hour -- not horrible, although we ended up just sitting at the bar since I was starving. We ordered the 'Little Star' specialty pizza -- spinach, mushrooms, onions, garlic. Yum. The cornmeal crust was, once again, amazing. Possibly the best pizza crust in the Bay Area. A small pie easily feeds two people, with leftovers to spare.\n\nThe service was acceptable this time around, and that's all I really ask. I'd still recommend takeout for those who live nearby since I'd be concerned about a much longer wait, and I'm also not a huge fan of high-top tables, which is a good portion of the seating.

We ordered a small Classic for the two of us, along with some Spicy Chicken Wings to tide us over while they made the pizza.  The pizza itself was very good, with the perfect blend of tomato sauce and sausage, onion, bell peppers, and my personal favorite, mushrooms.  The only negative was the crust, which was a bit crumbly and just didn't feel right for some reason.  The chicken wings were pretty average, though they were mildly spicy and had a good kick.  The blue cheese dressing that came with them was a nice addition.\n\nService (0.5 stars):\nThe service was alright here, they were very busy so we had to wait a while to get the attention of our waiter whenever we needed something.  Because of the long wait, they took our order while we were waiting so it wouldn't take as long to get our food, but it still took about 20 minutes after we were seated.\n\nValue (0.5 stars):\nPrices here are almost the same as the local competition (Zachary's, Patxi's).  A small deep dish was more than enough for two people, and the chicken wings were plentiful though a bit on the pricey side.\n\nExperience (0.5 stars):\nThe restaurant is located in the Mission and we had a really hard time finding parking.

Our wait was close to about 25 minutes and the lady told me that if I ordered first, she'll send it to the kitchen so it should arrive when we get seated. I liked this idea because my gf and I were very hungry and the thought of being able to eat as soon as we sit was great.\n\nWe decided on the vegetarian deep dish and added sausage. After we got to our table, we also decided to get the spicy chicken wings. I was hoping our pizza was gonna come in the next few minutes. Nope. \n\nAfter about 20 minutes, our chicken wings came. These were really good! Spicy but not the kind of spicy that you get from hot sauce or chili, spicy due to some undetectable spices that they coat the chicken in before baking. It hits your tongue but sort of in an indirect way. The heat is definitely there but it isn't overwhelming, it peaks then it slowly disappears, leaving you all confused and wanting to chomp down on the next one. I sensed some cumin and the gf sensed some celery root or coriander. Definitely a puzzler. \n\nAfter about 30 minutes our pizza finally arrived. It looked great! It was sauced nicely and the crust looked amazing with the flecks of cornmeal on it. So I took a bite, and it was good, you definitely know it was a vegetarian pizza because there was a lot of different textures from the zucchini, mushroom, and I forget what else was in there. The sausage was a bit bland, and maybe overpowered by the veggies. So after the initial slice, everything started to just wear off. I guess this place is the kind of place where you come with a big group, order a bunch of pies, and then try a slice each. It's good, and I'll definitely be back to try the thin crust pizzas.", "author": "Derrick L."}

Because its now four hours since I ate there, and I still have this great taste in my mouth and my stomach is sending happy messages to my brain. \n\nLook its a little dark inside, yes, but the atmosphere is great inside, just a touch of class, a touch of NY flavor, but you still know you are in CA for pizza. \n\nStarted with the caprese salad, which was made very well with fresh ingredients. Ordered some Ginger Beer, a Sam Adams, and PBR, all served chilled and very tasty. Ordered the Chicken Pesto Thin Crust and the Little Star Deep Dish. \n\nLets just say the Chicken Pesto is orgasmic. Bite after bite, I kept looking forward to my next bite. Then we all gazed and put dibs on our next slice. What can I say? You can taste the fresh ingredients, the cheese is just to the PERFECT amount, the mushrooms add intense flavor, and the chicken is cooked to perfection, none of that dried out stuff that happens in the oven. The Pesto sauce wasn't too oily, just the right saltiness, and a little tinge of butter. \n\nThe little star deep dish was also amazing. If you were to compare this to say, Zachary's in Berkeley, this place is much better. Why? Because it doesn't try to overload you with ingredients. Great crispy crust on the edge that isn't hard where you don't want to eat it, but isn't soft where it doesn't hold up the pizza. The tomato and spinach inside was so intense in flavor that I had to chew slowly to juice all the ingredients out. \n\nAnd you know what? Those two pizzas, beers, and appetizer turned out $15 after tip per person. Great Great Great. I will definitely go back in a second.", "author": "Jon H."}

After my first experience here, it's hard to argue with the majority of the comments I've read and heard.\n\nI went with a friend who's been here before.  The special was a meatball, ricotta, mushroom deep dish.  Whenever I go to a place for the first time, I make it a point to either get the standard or the special.  I want to give a place the best opportunity to succeed.\n\nIt was totally decent.  The meatballs were appropriately spiced, the mushrooms had a nice texture, and they use a good quality cheese.  The sauce was just a hair on the sweet side for me, but everything else met or exceeded expectations.  The one thing I have to say is the crust was amazing; absolutely amazing.\n\nWe (two healthy guys) split a small deep dish.  I definitely could've eaten more, but I didn't leave hungry.\n\nPrice: 4 stars, totally appropriate for the amount of food (note: cash only)\nAmbiance: 4 stars, A little crowded, a little noisy, but an appropriate experience for a pizza joint.\nService: 4 stars, the crowd made seating a challenge, but our server was excellent.\nFood: 4.5 stars, I might upgrade to 5 after further dining experiences. \n\nOverall, I'm a supporter.\n\nOne final thing, I didn't try it, but I hear their cheese cake is amazing.", "author": "Thomas K."}

I think it's safe to assume that the people who were dressed up, were on their way to go someplace else, afterward. Otherwise, they really need to get a life.\n\nThe pizza was relatively good, but it had way too much sauce for my taste. It was sour, tangy, red sauce...so much of it, it was like a bread bowl of tomato sauce. However, I did like the dough/crust, despite the strange texture.\n\nThe pizza was pretty pricey. I had a small personal pizza, which was $20 +tip. \n\nI think a lot of people would really enjoy the pizza, but I took a couple of stars off, because I got some crazy allergic reaction to it.

This is truly a five star place.\n\nHere's what makes Little Star better than the rest:\n+ Cornmeal crust.  I was skeptical at first, because I thought the cornmeal crust was a gimmick.  But it's not.  It's a smart way to get a crispy, substantial crust without too much doughy globbiness or grease.  Little Star's crust wins out over Patxi's or Zachary's.\n+ Sauce is just the right balance of tangy and sweet.  Little Star's sauce wins over Zachary's (too tangy) but draws with Patxi's.\n\nHere's what put Little Star over the top:  \n+ Caprese salad was also top-notch, with vine-ripened hothouse tomatoes that tasted just like summer and creamy buffalo mozzarella.\n+ Service was honest, friendly, and no-nonsense.  I love that our waiter admitted to forgetting an additional side, and that the host legitimately tried to figure out how long our wait would be and took down our cell phone number (turned out to be about an hour...)  I also loved that we could preorder our pizza, so we didn't have to wait too long after getting seated to start chowing down.\n+++  Bonus points go to Little Star for making me feel young, SF-y and hip.

For about the same price, you get so much more at Patxis (full off of 2 slices vs not full off 3 slices at Lil Star).

It's just not as good as Patxis.  \n\nWhere Little Star clearly beats Patxis is what i like to call the \"ambiance factor\".

Why would you even consider getting the thin crust?  \n\nThe cornmeal crust is like eating a crunchy, perfectly cooked biscuit.  The sauce is not too heavy, has great tang to it, and is beautiful.  The cheese is the perfect amount.  The toppings are always great (I really like the Mediterranean pizza).\n\nAlso, the deep dish isn't too heavy.  Patxi's and Zachary's pizzas are like pancakes.

Had spicy heat but it was not overwhelming. Tasty. And delicious with beer. I totally recommend this. \n\n* Half and half 9 inch thick crust (3 of 5) \n** Half Mediterranean Chicken - Chicken breast, artichoke hearts, red bells, green olives, onions, feta $19.50/2 \n** Half Classic - Sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bells $19.25/2\n\nSo the 9 inch was a good size three people. There are six slices and it takes about 25 minutes to come to the table. Mind your timing. The dough was very different. The dough is probably the thinnest thick crust I ever tried. And the sides were very light, airy, and crunchy. Similiar texture to a biscotti, but with much more finer pores in the dough. The sauce was chunky with lots of tomatoes. And I though this chunky sauce perfectly complimented its crunchy crust. It reminded me of how well the Tostito Scoop works with a scoop of thick salsa. It just holds the fillings perfectly. It was amazing dough and sauce. But the pizza fillings weren't strong enough for me. I ordered half and half, but I could barely taste the difference since both sides were heavy filled with the chunky tomato sauce. It looked like they lined the pizza with the cheese, then the fillings, and then topped it with the chunky tomato sauce. When it is presented on the table, you just saw a lot of tomato sauce. No doubt, it was good crust and sauce, but I don't feel like I tasted any  sausage or chicken.  \n\nOn another note, there was lots of cheese on the bottom layer of the pizza and I find myself twirling the cheese 3 to 5 times before I was able to break it off. This pizza is definitely a fork and knife kind of meal.\n\nThis was a darling fun place and if you are a fan of thick crust and lots of tomato, I  definitely recommend trying this place.", "author": "Janice T."}

So when I tried Zachary's and loved it, and then people told me I *had* to try Little Star, I was sure I was going to be in for some out of this world pie.  High expectations... they get me every time.\n\nWe ordered take out, and the 30 minute wait was very reasonable for our three pizzas.  If I had eaten these sumptuous-smelling beauties right away, I'd probably be singing a different tune in this review.  Instead we had to wait about 40 minutes to get to someone's house before chowing down.  By that time, the crusts were a little soggy, the pies weren't as hot, and I just wasn't feeling them.  \n\nThe flavors were really good though... we got a Little Star, Brass Monkey (just LS w/ sausage), and Vegetarian (all deep dish - HELLO).  The tomatoes had a smokier, roasted flavor than most other deep dish sauces I've had, and I loved the ricotta-feta mix on the LS pies.  The roasted zucchini was excellent on the Veggie.\n\nIn all my years of eating pizza I've realized that pizza is just better when it's fresh, or when it's a day old and you eat some out of the fridge for breakfast.  Anything in between is just a gray area.  If you're getting take out, then TAKE it OUT of the box right away.  Eat on the street if you have to.  Better yet, suck it up and wait for a table - that's what I'll be doing from now on.", "author": "Laura B."}

The roasted garlic that you spread on the bread really makes this a stand out.  \n  \nAs for the pizza, we ordered the thin crust special (garlic, mozzerella, heirloom tomatoes, basil, prosciutto di parma) and the classic deep dish.  The classic deep dish is always consistently delicious! But the special, OH MAN! I almost didn't want to order it cause my fav is the deep dish, but it was outstanding.

Just as we know (now) we don't live in a geocentric solar system, phrenology is hogwash, and brunettes are hotter than blonds, so too can pizza be served up inside out, made of strange new ingredients, and is still absolutely fantastic.\n\nI suppose to clarify, I have never had an \"authentic\" Chicago style deep dish pizza before. (My assumption was that elusive beasts were only found in the frozen wastes of the windy city) Hence I never bothered searching one out. If you've read my previous reviews, they characterize me as a pizzian (is that a word?) neophyte, used to chewy crusts, pasty sauce, and copious amounts of cheese.\n\nI was intrigued by Little Star from the get-go. No lunch hour (opens 17:00), cash only, just two sizes of pie (sm and lg), no delivery, and where some parlors will put anything on as a topping - they've relativly few(although good).  As every girl knows, restrictions, scarcity, and mystery are all that more a turn-on. Why all limitations, yet no shortage of people willing to sell their first born for a LS pie? hmmm.\n\nSo, a beer and a pizza later, I have my answers. They do the cute Chicago thing, with the toppings under the cheese, under the sauce, all in crust that's kinda like a dense cornbread, fried up all crispy from being done in a pan/deep-dish.  I have to say, I like pizza as a knife and fork kinda food (hey, I could go on a date here!) and you really have to, with the pulpy sauce now unbound by cheese, it can get messy. It was a unique pie, for me anyway, I really liked having all the gooey cheese and toppings contrasted with the crunchy crusty. \n\nAs for everything else: the wait for the food was rather lengthy, but that's normal with pizzas done like this I suppose. It'd be a good time to have a chat with someone(s) over a drink or two.  The service friendly and astute, among a ambiance resembling a cross between Pizza Hut (those red glass table candles) and a hipster coffee house (mixed media/found materials artwork all over the walls). \n\nAs a specialty pizza place, I was impressed and will return.", "author": "Sarah M."}

A little while after opening, Barack Obama happened to stop by while he was in town and made the place an instant hit when he named it his favorite pizza. I was very intrigued by this and decided to head down to Divisidero and try out the original.\n\nThe pizza is great! It's been a while since I've been there so I don't recall which one I tried. I do remember liking it a lot. It's not your typical hole-in-the-wall greasy pizza joint. They've put a lot of thought into their recipes and turn out a really high quality pie. The restaurant itself is really cute, dimly lit, and nicely decorated.", "author": "Aaron H."}

Because this eatery converted me from a thin-crust pizza lover to a deep-dish pizza fan (but ONLY for this place).  No exaggeration!  I have NEVER been a deep dish pizza fan.  All of my previous experiences have led me to \"stereotype\" deep dish as: Heavy, doughy, soggy and overly saucy with the overly-tangy-powering-tomato-sauce-marring-all-the rest- of-the-ingredients\".  \n\nIn fact, every pizza place that I would go with family or friends, if they'd order deep dish, I'd always order a thin-crust for myself. But after seeing the high rating and reading the amazing reviews on Yelp about Little Star, I decided to \"risk\" it, and join my friends in eating the pizza they had ordered: the Classic deep dish.\n\nLittle Star tears down my \"stereotypical walls\" of deep dish pizza: the crust is deliciously crispy and thin at the bottom but crunchy enough to hold all of the savory concoction of sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions, altogether topped by a lightly sweet and tangy chunky tomato sauce.  Now that I am converted, my mission is to share with other \"deep dish\" unbelievers \"Litte Star Pizza\" and have them join me in a crusade.", "author": "Nadine M."}

They have good beers on tap: California Anchor, Blue Star Wheat, Arrogant Bastard,  and a few others and a larger selection of bottled beers.

We were craving pizza, and who can say no to a place with 1000+ reviews and 4.5 stars?\n\nThings went really well from the beginning. We were told we were going to have to wait 30-40 minutes, but were seated in less than 20.\n\nWe had a Large Classic Deep Dish pizza with pepperoni added. For an appetizer we had garlic bread.\n\nI had never been served garlic bread like this and I was pretty impressed. They serve you sliced bread, a portion of butter and some perfectly roasted garlic. The bread and butter were great on their own, but that roasted garlic did not fuck around. I have a friend who is a garlic lover and puts hella garlic on everything. This roasted garlic brought me closer to understanding how she can be that way. \n\nThe pizza was pretty incredible. Unlike Zachary's, Little Star's deep dish has a slight crunch to it. it's perfect. And unlike Zachary's, we didn't wait an eternity for it. \n\nFood wise, this place got 4 stars really. Little Star earned that extra star thanks to the waitress that served us. I've never had a more attentive and pleasant waitress or waiter in my life.

Across the bay, Zachary's kills this place in the deep dish department and does it without all the coolness and trendiness that Little Star has. I can name 5 spots in downtown Chicago that would destroy Little Star (Edwardo's, Giordano's, Lou's, Uno's, Gino's). It's good for San Francisco standards, where everybody can pat themselves on their back and relish in how cool and unique this place is. But in my opinion, the deep dish is average, I just don't like their spaghetti sauce, err tomato sauce, that  they use for their pies. \n\nI will say that their thin crust is much better and tastier. The crust is very crispy and it has a good balance of cheese, sauce, and toppings. In fact, I would even say that it is in the top 4 for thin crust with Gialina, Pizzetta 211, Delfina, and A-16 battling for top spots. I would give the thin crust 5 stars and the deep dish 2.5.

It can only be described as a \"quarter-life\" crisis. The way many of us have been attempting to steal back a portion of our youth, has been by celebrating our birthday's the way we did when we were in elementary school. A few months back, a dear friend had an actual sleep-over where we wore jammies, played truth or dare and crank called boys.

First, here's the good...\n\n--Super friendly and accomodating staff. Their corkage is only $10 so we brought about 6 bottles of our own and they had no problem opening up the champagne for us to enjoy in the lobby while waiting for our table. \n\n--Delicious Caprese salad. I make this at home about 3 or 4 times a week, so I know my stuff. \n\n--I dig the loud yet cozy ambiance.\n\n--Portions were large and priced moderately.\n\nReading all of that, you might be asking yourself \"Why the 3 stars Lynsey?\" Well here it is, the bad...\n\n--Cash only!! Come on people, this is the generation of speed and efficiency. This is a huge issue for me, as I've written before.\n\n--Not sure I'm a huge deep dish fan. Not sure what it is...I liked it and definately ate every last bite...but there's something missing. Some sort of herb or spice. I found myself dumping hot pepper flakes all over it, which I usually do with original style pizza...but it just...needed something. Ya know?\n\n--They would not seat us or even take our party number until everyone was there. Do they think I'm going to show up solo and claim to be a party of 6?? This doesn't make sense, and probably lost them some revenue. If myself and the other early people had been able to sit while we waited, we may have ordered an appetizer or even bought one of their bottles of wine.\n\nAll in all, it was a great night with the ladies reminiscing on our childhood, the food was good (not mind blowing) and we took major advantage of the small corkage.

I had Giordanos and Uno under my belt, but I wasn't sure it would be enough, but now after trying Lou Malnati's I can give it a well deserved review. \n\nLocally, it's pretty close to Zachary's, however, the main difference is the type of ingredients they use and the Crust. OMG, the crust is to die for. The first time my friend and I ate here, we ate the pizza just to get to the crust. It's a cornmeal based crust, with enough butter to satisfy anyone's taste buds. The pizza here uses large chunks of tomatoes which is great. \n\nThe Pizza (all deep dish):\n**The Classic - Huge chunks of sausage, flavorful, peppery, and well balanced. Everything comes well together. It's my second favorite here. \n**Little Star - Spinach, Cheese, Garlic. Out of this world. I would recommend this over anything they have on the menu. If you're a vegetarian, this is great, even for a carnivore like me. \n\nI would defintely recommend getting half/half the first time there, but everyone who's gone with me has liked the little star over the classic. \n\nLittle Star also has 2 other stores, this place is still the best. It's not that much different, but it is definitely noticeable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-03-01", "description": "After a year of culinary straying, last night completed my second visit to the Little Star family.  This location serves up equally delicious food to the Valencia one (http://www.yelp.com/biz/little-star-pizza-san-francisco-2#hrid:OoMs1qCM23FswwkZOKbTEw) and was where it all started as I understand.  \n\nThe decor in here is all Divis, with a little East Village vibe for good measure.  Graphic art on the dark walls gives an edgy feel.  Complete it with lots of young urbanites eating before a show at the Independent.  Service was downright sweet, and our salad came almost immediately.\n\nThe spicy sauce and cornmeal, almost-cookie-like crust make this not just any pizza, and not even just any deep dish pizza.  Also give their salads a try - they're much fresher and more intriguing than you'd expect from a pizza parlor.\n\nGet in by 6:15 to avoid the wait, and maybe even find parking.  Bring cash, since they don't take cards - but if not, they have an ATM machine in-house that boasts an old-fashioned 25-cent transaction fee.  The last ATM I used in the city gauged me $3.50.  And didn't give me any cash.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

The kids certainly seem to like it though, as the place has been packed every time I've ever walked by it.  So I decided to finally get down with the Star, see if it lives up to the hype.\n\nAs expected, the wait was pretty long, but they let us put an order in before we were seated, as is customary in such places (the pizza takes a darn long time to cook after all).  We ordered the Classic, which is the quintessential Chicago style pizza (sausage, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers).  You can't go wrong.\n\nOr maybe you can.  There are certain things you'll never taste if you're eating a true Chicago style deep dish pizza, and one of those things my friends is fucking cornmeal.  Lou Malnati must be spinning in his grave right now.  To be fair, it isn't necessarily a bad pizza, but it sure as heck isn't authentic Chicago style.\n\nIf I wasn't such a purist, I probably would have enjoyed Little Star more.  However, I ams what I ams, and Little Star is what it is (ie: not authentic Chicago).  When I'm in the mood for some of that tasty pizza, I go for Patxi's: the crowd is better, the Pabst is only a dollar, and the pizza is far superior.  Recognize.\n\nI give Little Star Pizza a fantastic score of 2 out of 5 stars.\n\nLove,\nJames", "author": "Cheryll M."}

Their crust is an interesting mix of cornmeal and sourdough.

I really enjoyed the Little Star, which has ricotta, spinach, mushroom, garlic and onions.  \n\nI would have to say Zacharys and Little Star are definitely on par with each other when it comes to deep dish pizzas, but I like Little Star's ambiance more.  It's dim, laid-back, and kind of hippie with the staff's unique sense of fashion.  \n\nI also tried the pear cider, which was really good on its own, but not so much with pizza.", "author": "Jen Y."}

Had excellent service.  Cornmeal crust is a new one for me but worth the minor wait for a pie.  Get there early as they are often too packed to be seated.  Very alternative looking staff and decorations which added to the appeal for my wife and me.

Needless to say, I was not disappointed. We ordered the Little Star deep-dish (added sausage) as well as the chicken wings. Both dishes we're very well prepared and delicious. The chicken wings are rather petite - which makes them a bit easier to eat. Anddddd the Little Star deep dish was incredible. I've had Chicago deep dish and NY deep dish, and this was right up there with them. The crust was infused with butter and garlic, toasted perfectly and melted in your mouth. The pizza did not come out scolding hot and was ready to eat right away. Then, to top it off since we couldnt finsish the deep dish, we wrapped it to go and brought it for lunch the next day... and it was just as good.

I am quite the pizza lover, so I was excited to hear of a Chicago Style pizzeria in SF.\n\nThis place has the BEST Chicago Style pizza in the SF Bay Area!!  Definitely better than Zachary's...in my opinion. OVERALL in the bay area, Little Star is #2 behind Rainbow Pizza.  (Overall Grade:  A)\n\nWe ordered a large \"Classic\" (combo) pizza. I've been to 3 pizzerias in Chicago and Little Star seems authentic. It was definitely deeeeeeep dish and had a great crust. It had a pretty good amount of toppings. The sauce was pretty good, but not nearly as good as Rainbow Pizza's. The sauce also had some tomatoes that I picked off.

It is good, but it's not Zachary's.  In fact, to me, Little Star deep-dish is better in lesser quantities.  Yes, it still tends to be extremely generous with the toppings, but the flavor equilibriums are off, the mixture isn't quite zen, the cheese tends towards the sharp.  All in all, with more outings, I may even now be leaning towards the thin crust over the stuffed, and for this East Bay Zachophile, that's just blasphemy.\n\nFor those of you out there unfamiliar with the brilliance that is Zachary's, just go.  I hestitate to oversell Zachary's because then people may have unrealistic expectations, unsure of what to imagine near-perfect pizza should taste like.  Zachary's is always extremely good; quite often, it's unreal.  Zachary's simply gets better with time.  I've converted several people to Zachary's deep dish, including my father and my girlfriend -- and for those of you who appreciate that one cannot be a prophet in his own land, you know how good Zachary's must be.\n\nI write this review to counterbalance my first review questioning whether LS or Zachary's was a better pizza.  To this critic, there is no comparison:  Zachary's wins any day of the week.  Zachary's is like Usain Bolt:  who cares who else is in the race?  Certainly, if I lived in SF and near Little Star, I would frequent more often.  I don't.  It's a luxury to be relatively near the original Zachary's outpost in Oakland.  I encourage everyone to try it when they're out in the East Bay.  It's a destination and worth the effort..", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

There's a good reason for this: even if you never eat at the restaurant and only get take out, and even if you never order anything other than a basic deep dish pie, you are going to have an incredible meal.\n\nBut if you do decide to branch out, you'll find their various pizza selections to be very rewarding.  The thin crust is almost as good as the deep dish.  And they have some incredible combinations.\n\nAnd should you decide to dine *in* - you are in for a treat.  I've come to Little Star on many an occasion by myself or with one friend to sit at the bar, drink a beer and destroy a pizza or two.  The ambiance is dark and fun, the beer is good and the bartenders are friendly.\n\nAnd should you get stuck waiting for a seat - I highly recommend Minibar across the street for a bloody mary or some other concoction.", "author": "Oliver N."}

My no-good asshole fuckface douchebag Ex who cheated on me FINALLY came by my apartment to pick up the last of his shit -- over a YEAR after moving out.\n\nThat's right.  I know you're surprised to hear I didn't give his belongings to a homeless person/have my Santeria priestess curse them/hock them for drug money, but the truth is we're friends. Also, I'm not a vindictive bitch like one of his former boyfriends who, after an argument, actually CALLED AND EMAILED all of his friends with the vicious lie that he had every STD known to man, and while I can appreciate how BATSHIT FUCKING CRAZY that was, I also know it's cruel and patently false because The Ex may be a lot of things but he's definitely NOT some hooker saddled with STDs, he's just impotent.***\n\nSo anyway he came by to collect his 20 bottles of shitty wine atop the kitchen cabinets, his massage chair, his Viagra ***, and a few other personal belongings, then decided to CLEAR OUT MY FUCKING KITCHEN since, as he put it, he PAID FOR THIS BOX OF PASTA.\n\nWHAT THE FUCK?!? JIGGA WHAAA? \n\nYeah, he wanted to play THAT game. Besides, you don't cook anyway, right Darin? Oh and while I'm here let's take a look in the fridge. Yeah, I bought this bottle of Scharffenberger liqueur, lemme pocket that. Who bought this almondine eau de vie? You gonna use this brown rice? Does brown rice go bad? I'll take it anyway. Hey, what about this miso mix? Where's the cd/dvd cleaner -- I think I paid for that. Oh yeah, these shot glasses are mine. These champagne flutes -- mine. Mine. Mine. Mine mine MINE!\n\nI finally said:\n\nOH FUCKING HELL WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE THE FORKS, TOO? I MEAN, NOT LIKE I NEED TO EAT, RIGHT? HEY, WHY NOT TOSS IN THE SPOONS AND KNIVES AND MAKE A COMPLETE SET? ASSHOLE.\n\nWell, I just figured that since you don't cook I could take the pasta. There's no need to get bitchy.\n\nBITCHY? WHO'S BITCHY?!? NOT ME. OH NO. I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE WHAT'S *RIGHTFULLY* YOURS! HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE BOY BUTTER TOO, DEAR?!? NOT LIKE I'VE FUCKED ANYONE OR WHACKED OFF SINCE I KICKED YOUR PATHETIC ASS OUT FOR TRYING TO SUCK DICK IN ATLANTA!!\n\nI guess I should pick up my old sneakers too.\n\nOH PLEASE! YES! I THREW THEM UNDER THE BED SINCE I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU STILL WANTED THEM, THOUGH NOW I REGRET NOT SMEARING MY SHIT ALL OVER YOUR PUMAS.\n\nLook, I don't want to make this difficult.\n\nNO SIR, NOT DIFFICULT AT ALL. I WANTED YOU TO EMPTY ALL MY CABINETS. EAT ME, ASSWIPE!\n\nWhy don't we grab some food.\n\nGO FUCK YOURSELF!\n\nNo, seriously, let me cook for you.\n\nCOOK WHAT? THE MOTHERFUCKING PASTA YOU JUST BAGGED?!? AND LET YOU POISON ME? FUCK YOU.\n\nI'm not gonna poison you, I need to keep you alive so you can cat-sit Tillie when I'm on vacation!\n\nOH RIGHT. Ok, fuck it, you know what, let's go to Little Star. I haven't had their deep dish pizza in a while.\n\nWe called in our order since we figured the place would be packed at 9pm on Saturday. To our surprise, it was rather empty -- definitely a change from the last time I ate here when the place resembled a camel toe convention or sexless hipster orgy, wait that doesn't make sense, everyone knows hipsters don't FUCK to reproduce, they just strike an emo pose, in other words meiotically. \n\nOur large Classic deep-dish pizza was phenomenal as always. The cornmeal dusted crust was hardy and hearty, and held firm against the substantial weight of the sausage chunks, juicy tomatoes, mushrooms, and cheese. One bite and I forgot about the machinations of The Ex and any misgivings I held because of them. All that ran through my mind like a ticker tape was the opening line in Bellow's paean to Chicago The Adventures of Augie March \"I am an American, Chicago born -- Chicago, that somber city -- and go at things as I have taught myself, free style, and will make the record in my own way,\" and while this makes for questionable politics (VOTE EARLY AND VOTE OFTEN!) and an idealism easily bruised, it's a GREAT FUCKING RECIPE for pie: these folks have perfected their deep-dish and elevated it to both a science and a peerless ideal. \n\nThe deep dish pie at Little Star can paper over and heal long simmering resentments -- is that some powerful shit or WHAT?!? I downed my four pieces, and in the process swallowed some of my pride as well. \n\nBeautiful.\n\nAnd towards the end of dinner, we had the following exchange.\n\nEx: Hey, are you still on that site?\n\nMe: What site? Gay.com? Yes. Are you still picking up sluts at Badlands?\n\nEx: Very funny. No, no, I meant that review site.\n\nMe: You mean Yelp? Yeah, still on it. Why?\n\nEx: Oh just asking...So have you reviewed this place?\n\nMe: Why no, now that you mention it, I HAVEN'T reviewed Little Star. Yet.\n\n\n\n***TOTALLY kidding. He is not impotent. He has a small dick. WHAT?!?", "author": "d s."}

And I never have had a Chicago Deep Dish pizza, and the food was surprisingly good.  After eating my dinner and boxing it up and taking home it was still good.  Put me into an early food coma which I cant complain about.  \n\nBut here is what I can complain about Little Star Pizza:\n\nDriving from a museum the restaurant was sandwiched tightly between two businesses.  (I of course had directions).  After getting lost (on the street it was supposed to be on) I called them and asked where they were.  After being told it was on the same block down the street I continued to remain on the phone with them, but they however obviously got kinda impatient and hung up on me.  HUNG UP ON ME!  Without so much as a \"Well ma'am your not talking anymore so I guess you are either dead or being quiet but I have a job to do and I hope you find your way to the establishment.  Goodbye\"  What is the deal with that?  Usually there are tricks to getting a customer to hang up without seeming like a royal douche. \n\nThen I found it!\n\nWhen I went in, I was first greeted by the beautiful and kinda artsy surrounding.  The hostess was very pleasant and showed us to our table.  My family and I ensued in very pleasant dinner conversation when low and behold I spotted a Juke Box!  Wow a Juke Box!  How long had it been since I have seen one of those!?  Eagerly I jumped out of my chair, rushed over to it, searched the deepest part of my pockets for some spare change, but right as i was about to slide my money into the juke box.  The worst tragedy I ever beheld seemed to have fallen on the poor Juke Box.  It was all music by Blondie or a bunch of musicians I have never heard of.  Now don't get me wrong I love Rock but seriously!?  I thought every Juke Box by law was supposed to have at least something good.   Hence the -one star so far.  Now lets continue onto why It doesn't have four stars.\n\nWhen I got back to my table and sat down, the waitress came up and asked us what we wanted to drink.  I had spent all my day in the city and had worked up a thirst.  My throat was parched and I needed something a little extra besides water.  Looking up, I asked her, \"Do you have refills on Coke?\"\n\"No they come in a can\"\n\"Do you have refills on iced tea?\"\n\"No it comes in a glass\"\nBewildered I looked and saw that they had a whole bar with tons of beer on tap.  Now here is where I tell you that I am not a fan of alcohol.  But i thought to myself, don't all pizzerias have some sort of refillable beverage on hand besides WATER?!  With a sigh, I said I would order a coke.\n\nAlright so when I eat I love to have a calm atmosphere.  When I was eating, however, a man kept on walking by snapping his fingers as if he were thinking if he left his oven on at home.  Then when I said something to my family he quickly abandoned snapping, for the time being, and started whistling.  Honestly guy, its called decaf!\n\nNow the pizza was extremely good.  I could only eat two slices and that was great.  We ordered the Little Star and the Classic Deep dish.  I loved the pizza and the surroundings but I don't think I will go back again.

The spoiled me had a split second knee-jerk reaction along the lines of 'WTF is this $h!t??'. Then as I looked at the fresh, hot bread with the side of butter and a fresh roasted garlic right next to it, I thought this could be fun, and tasty.  And yes, it was both.  Delicious, even.  The garlic was easy to spread and the end result was so good.  The sodas and if I remember right the beers as well, had a nice variety of local and or obscure brands I had never heard of.

And when I first walked in, I expected to feel like the least attractive, least hip person in the room (as I often do at places like this) but I was pleasantly surprised at the diversity. I even saw some blue collar folk. Fancy that. \n\nThe interior is seductive. Dark, design-y, neutral. And yet artsy. Which I dig. The wall art was painted on window panes (and if you know me you know about my fenestration fetish) so I took it as an omen (because I'm nuts) and decided that this might be my new favorite restaurant. \n\nBut actually, it might qualify in more substantial categories, too. Like the service. Our waiter was probably the best I've ever had, and that includes fancy downtown places. I don't know what his name was. I thought of asking him (\"Excuse me, sir, could I get your name to post on the internet?\") but decided against it. Anyway, you'll know him if you get him. Because he is AWESOME. \n\nSpeaking of awesome, they have Henry Weinhard's root beer, which pairs itself nicely with their fantastic pizza. It's deep and crispy in the right places and filled with everything you could possibly want and I'll be here twice a week for eternity, k thx. Also, I grew up eating Zachary's and I think this is better. Just to throw my hat into that ring, which will probably come back to haunt me and be a huge pain in my ass, but yes, I think Little Star is better than Zachary's. \n\nBut, we should not have gotten a large. Seriously, get a small for two people. I may never eat again. And I'm pretty good at eating.", "author": "Megan W."}

When I go places I like to soak up everything and try my hardest to file my feelings at that moment into my memory.  I am leaving in a week for Germany to visit a friend and I have no plans - I am going there and I KNOW I will see historic ruins and museums, but I don't have an itinerary.  I usually like it that way.\n\nThat said, Yelp has made me an information-seeker.  I go places now and find myself dorking out in the corner being like \"no she DIDN'T just roll her eyes when I asked about the nightly specials!!\"  I'm constantly noting things that may or may not go in my reviews on Yelp.  Collecting factoids, if you will.  Point in case, my experience at Little Star Pizza.\n\nI've heard from friends that Little Star made awesome pizza, and then I Yelped it.  It might just be the #1 yelped about spot in SF. . .there's an overwhelming yay response to the place.  Another friend of mine has said in (hers and others' opinion) that yelp in general is pretty hard on restaurant and bar reviews.  I kind of agree, it ain't hard to get three stars, but it's damn near impossible to get an overall 4.5 stars as an establishment.  Usually, when a place on yelp has a solid 4 stars or above, I just KNOW I'm gonna have a great meal/time.\n\nHowever, my overall experience at Little Star felt like a field trip. \n\n\"Here I am, FINALLY made it to Little Star. . . now what makes this place so special. . .\"\n\nThe food is wonderful of course, but I have to say it lacked that great pizza place atmosphere.  It's pizza, I just think it's one food that even if you are in San Francisco the place should be more comfy and homestyle, yo.  There's enough restaurants in SF that try uber-hipster or super she-she.

No fifth start for you.\n\n***************************\nThe fact that I'm only giving Little Star 3 (and a 1/2) stars may make some of you question my qualifications as an official foodie, but my first experience didn't wow the pants off me. And believe me...I wanted to be standing there in my Gap boyshort underpants blushing like a drunken pirate.\n\nDriving down Divis with boyfriend in a hungry and semi-inebriated state after a heated game of kickball, my eyes fixed on the dainty and modern pie sign dangling outside Little Star. Now, I was in no mood for pizza. Actually I was envisioning myself licking the tahini off a falafel or caressing a damn fine burrito. Boyfriend says to me:\n\n\"how about pizza\"\n\n\"Ick, no! I sooooo don't want piz... Holy shit there's Little Star! I've never been. We're going\"\n\nI said this as I sharply turned the corner going 50 mph. It was like a high speed chase in one of the \"Fast and Furious\" movies but without Vin Diesel and his massive guns and cone-shaped dome. Thank god!\n\nWhen we arrived, we gave the tiny pixie working the hostess stand our names and were told the wait would be 20 minutes. But fortunately the party of two on the list before us bailed, so we got seated pretty much immediately. Thanks Lisa, Party of 2! I owe you one girl!\n\nWe ordered a deep dish pizza. Half Little Star for moi and half salami, garlic and olive for the carnivorous man I call my own.\n\nWe started off splitting a small garden salad, which was a perfect size for two and was fresh, light and delicious. I probably would have given the salad one big \"meh\" if it hadn't been for the two pounds of Gorgonzola they dumped on top. They know me so well...it brings a tear to my eye. I'm all choked up.\n\nThe pizza was good. It was really good. The sauce was delicious and just the right amount of spice to leave my lips burning, in that good kind of lip burning way. The crust was corny and mealy and yummy. Ok, so now getting to the three and a half stars *ducks.* The cheese yo! Where is the mother truckin cheese? I need my cheese. Bring out the oxygen tanks cause I can't live without a massive amount of cheese on my pizza! I mean damn yo! I thought you guys knew me. I feel so betrayed.\n\nThe toppings were good, but I must admit, I kept looking at the couple with the thin crust pizza next to us with envy. Plus that dumb bitch with the fugly white flats kept eaves dropping on our conversation, which isn't such a nice thing to do when you're bickering with your significant other and hitting his elbows with your knife just to piss him off. Smooches lover!\n\nThe pizza was great....but my heart wasn't into giving it the full five stars yet. I mean how is it possible that the best pizza I've ever had is in Chico? I mean when there's nothing better to do in a small college town than drink massive amounts of booze, play Frisbee golf and watch the cows grow, I guess you'd have that time to perfect pizza. But come on! San Francisco is a culinary mecca and I've yet to find pizza the can even compare to my precious (yes I stroke each slice like the ring that ruled them all) Celestinos. I'll come back to Little Star again and again until I can give it the full amount of stars it deserves. But it does need to try a little harder with me. They need to woo me. Court me. Show me they care. And then, after I try each and every concoction they can come up with, will I upgrade my review.", "author": "Sammy S."}

After a very, very long bike race on Saturday where I was able to ride more than ever before. I was starving, and the only thing that could quite our stomachs was lots of carbs, sauce, cheese, meat and vegetables. Where do we get all that wonderful goodness in one place? Simple. Pizza.\n\nAfter the routine brainstorming of pizza places, we decided on Little Star. It took some arm twisiting. Since it was all the way over there, parking is hard and the wait would be super long. A call to Nizario's would have been a good solution, but I won the arguement. Parking was easy, drive was quick but the wait was long.\n\nWhen you go to Little Star on a week night be prepared to wait 45 minutes to an hour. Luckily there is plenty of seating and a bar. The beer selection is excellent. $4 for a Racer 5 IPA, that alone is worth 3-stars in my book. Three Racer 5 IPAs. four PBRs and two Samuel Adams later we were seated. Since we already decided what to order, it was placed even before we sat down. \n\nOur two pizzas. A deep dish with tomatoes, sausage, green bell peppers, and mushrooms and thin crust Chicken pesto were a welcome sight. The waiter was impressed we could devour the pizza so fast. We were hungry, and the beer acts as a pizza lubricant.\n\nSadly they ran out of garlic bread, don't restaurants usually run out of specials not appetizers? Must be some really good garlic bread.\n\nOur deep dish was awesome, never had the real Chicago thing, so this will suffice until a trip takes me out there. Stay away from the Chicken Pesto, it lacked pesto! Almost tasted dry and the chicken was the only noticeable flavor.\n\nNext time, we will place an order for pick up.

Because it was our first time, we wanted to try a variety of pies to get the full experience.  \r\n\r\nClassic Deep Dish - oh my my, it's absolutely perfect!!  (and I am an uber-critical Chicago girl)  Exactly the right ratio of sauce:  cheese:  crust.  Nice distro of sausage as well.  Deeply satisfying but somehow not too heavy.  Wonderful cornmeal crust that is neither too doughy nor too fluffy.  Fresh chunky tomato sauce which has a great flavor, and is not too acidic or runny.  #1 for me.\r\n\r\nBBQ Chicken Pizza - (special of the night) mmmmm, just the right amount of sauce so as not to be overpowering, chunks of chicken, green apple, red onion and cheddar cheese.  Thin, crispy crust.  Beautiful & yummy.\r\n\r\nWhite Pizza - this is much lighter pizza, and works well as a 3rd choice if you have 2 much more boldly flavored pizzas.  Cheese, tomato, zucchini.  I might have added something for a little zing, like arugula, but that's just me.  The others in my party found it perfectly fine as is.\r\n\r\nDessert - cheesecake - good flavor, a bit dry.  Next time I would skip dessert and opt for the garlic bread or a salad instead.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is cool, from the dark walls to the low lights, to the retro couches in the waiting area.  Clientele matches the decor - casual hipsters, all ages.  GREAT juke box, which is key for me - because I usually like to eat pizza at home, so having your favorite music on rotation is the second best thing.  The place is packed, and the noise level is somewhat high, but you'll forget that once you sink your teeth into the delicious food. \r\n\r\nCASH ONLY.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, I think this place will make me eat pizza in SF in an entirely different way - as a true destination dining experience.\r\n\r\n(Update 7/19:  Takeout is a viable option here.  Please try to restrain yourself and don't eat while driving.  It will be tough, but you can do it.)\r\n\r\nImportant tip:  save at least one piece to take home for breakfast the next day.

I'm indifferent to the fact that it's not an 'authentic' Chicago deep dish pizza; I like the crisp cornmeal crust and the integrity of the slice; not soggy and messy when you eat it by hand, the way pizza was meant to be eaten. The combinations they offer are sensible as well; None of this California style curry chicken, brussel spouts, and passionfruit nonsense, though they'll probably make it for you if you bring your own sprouts.\n\nIt's a pleasant space to be in; Not cluttered, not too bright, not too crowded.\n\nYes, it takes a while, around 35 minutes from when you place your order, but they're upfront about it.

Based on the mood you're in when you step into the restaurant, this could be a good thing or a bad thing. I perceived it as a good thing because it represented a change, and change don't hurt.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant's atmosphere is pretty dark and it gets quite loud in there (partly because of their fantastic jukebox)...as a result I had to struggle to hear the person sitting across the small table from me.\r\n\r\nThe host and staff were terrific, and the food and drink were excellent. We had the mixed salad and the classic deep dish pizza. The nice thing about less cheese is that I didn't feel that oh-so-popular 'post-Zachary's bloat' that we all get when we go one slice too deep...\r\n\r\nIt took me a while to make it here, but I'll be back!", "author": "Art D."}

I'm a thin crust pizza lover.  I had Zachary's pizza and the food coma I had from that experience was so bad, it pretty much turned me off the deep dish pizza for good I thought.  I'm not a fan of feeling painfully full after eating a meal.  Then, my date suggested Little Star, and because I'm normally the one who makes plans (I'm a default planner take charge type of person), I agreed, happy to let someone else be in charge of the plans.  I would not have chosen Little Star Pizza if it were up to me. \r\n\r\nI'm glad I tried Little Star.  We ordered the salad which was super fresh.  I would even order the salad to go in the future without pizza.   We also ordered two pizza's, one deep dish and one thin crust.  Both were really good.  The deep dish was perfect.  I like the crust and the sauce.  I like my pizza crust crispy, and both thin and deep crusts were crispy (but not burnt).  The pizza's were NOT oily or overly cheesy which I also liked.  \r\n\r\nI'm one of those people who wouldn't choose to eat pizza unless it's sort of fancy and a gourmet-like experience (caveat being I'm drunk, when it becomes a medicinal type thing).  That said, Little Star Pizza was way above good pizza in my opinion.  They use fresh high quality ingredients which you can taste with each bite.  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to thin crust, I'll probably stick to other places in the city known for their thin crust pizza but if I want deep dish pizza, I'll come back to Little Star for sure.\r\n\r\nViva Little Star Pizza!", "author": "James M."}

I am not one to give praise unless I feel it's something truly noteworthy. My family would travel back east often and my father made sure we had only the very best pizza at our fingertips. Places like Round Table were just not in our vocabulary.\n\nWith that being said, my three star rating is twofold - one whole star was taken due to some pretty lousy service. Our pizza took over 30 minutes to get to us - pies kept coming out, none of which were ours and were being served to patrons who had arrived much later than us. Our server, while friendly enough, didn't check on us once during that time.\n\nThe other half star is due to the fact that the deep dish pizza, while amazing, is still not quite as good as the deep dish I've experienced in Chicago.\n\nOverall, I would definitely go back and would encourage people to try it.

I tried it this weekend for the first time and I don't think it lives up to the hype. I don' t know about you, but I feel like there is something wrong about having deep dish pizza in an swank bar-like ambiance. This is not to say I'm against swank bar-like ambiance, it just that pizza and \"local art\" don't really go together. Like Bud Light and Dom Perignon. Also the pizza itself wasn't that hot, the sauce and crust are a ways off of Zachary's. All that said, I'd go back - but you better be buying.", "author": "Jeremy S."}

Why hasn't anyone else thought of this?  \n\nSome may say that the crown for the best deep dish pizza in the Bay Area is held by Zachary's out in Berkeley.  I beg to differ.  Little Star is by far the best Chicago-style pizza you'll find in the Bay.  Period.\n\nNot only are the ingredients uber-fresh and flavorful, but the jukebox at L.S., which features a plethora of great indie tunes, is one that cannot be passed over.  You'll find the lights turned down low at night, but candles burn soft and romantically at each table.  Great kitschy art pieces can be found strewn on the walls, making the general ambiance neighborhood-y, comfortable, and hip [but not so hip that a new patron would feel out of place].\n\nSomething else noteworthy: The garlic bread is AHH-MAY-ZING.  We're talking a whole bulb of garlic oven-roasted and brought fresh to your table next to thick slices of sourdough bread.  Yee-uhmmmm.", "author": "Katie C."}

The appetizer was bomb, fresh bread and they provide the garlic cloves so you can spread it yourself. However the deep dish pizza itself was a lil disappointing for me. Way too much tomato sauce to taste any of the other toppings.\n\nAlso, I believe its 2009 - I don't understand how some establishments are still cash only.

Perhaps its because people don't usually tend to care about the small details in life.  A well planned day.  A perfect golf swing.  A perfectly timed joke.  \n\nThis pizza was probably the most well constructed piece of food I've eaten in a long time.  One gripe about most pizza is how it breaks apart when its picked up.  This pizza had none of those careless characteristics.  \n\nProbably the best part of the pizza was that it was right before our kickball game and their was no crowd when we got there at 5.  We had the classic Deep which consisted of Sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers and onions.  The tomato sauce was also on top, which was a change of pace, but the toppings....um...middlings were fresh.  \n\nAgain if you are a person who likes the well constructed things in life, then this is the place for pizza.", "author": "patrick o."}

So, this part of the review may only make sense to anyone from the Illinois/Wisconsin/Indiana area...\n\nLittle Star is closer to Gino's East. The crust is very similar in that sort of crispier and more buttery way. If you're looking for a more Giordano's crust (more sturdy, less buttery), Zachary's in the East Bay is more similar to that.\n\nAnd that said, Little Star is close to Gino's East. So, yes, it's \"real\" Chicago-style pizza. You will not be disappointed.\n\nFor those who have no idea what I'm referring to, the deep dish here is very authentic to what you'd get in Chicago. If you're not used to deep dish pizza, it is a very filling pizza. If you're able to polish off a medium sized thin crust pizza on your own, you may be able to handle 2 and half slices of deep dish. If you don't  like a lot of sauce on your pizza or a lot of crust, this may not be for you. If you do like a lot of sauce, Little Star's sauce is really good.  The crust is crispy on the outside, but flaky and buttery. It's good stuff.\n\nI've also had both the caprese and mixed salads. They are good.  (The mixed salad is excellent.) They also have organic beer.  It's a noisy place to eat, but the jukebox has some really cool stuff on it. The staff is nice. Get there early if you don't want to wait.", "author": "Allyson V."}

Seriously, next time I go (and like, actually get a table), I'm ordering two large pizzas... for myself.  And I'm not sharing (see above).  The cheap champagne cocktails served in huge glasses are a nice plus, and the blue cheese salad was delicious too.  \n\nSo, Little Star, the victory is yours.

The 'buffalo' wings are also good and I will continue to make this my pizza choice when I'm not too lazy to walk the four blocks to Little Star.

I've been going to Zachary's in Berkeley for many years and it will always be my #1 spot, especially if you plan on ordering the chicken special. It is so f*ing amazing. But if you're in the Mission and have a craving for pizza, Little Star Pizza is the place to go. I don't recommend getting the thin crust as it's not what they are known for. They have good veggie and meat combos and the crust is made from wheat and cornmeal.\n\nThey don't take reservations but wait for a party of 2-4 is usually under 30 minutes. Yes, even for a Saturday night. I saw some reviews that said the venue was swank. Hardly, unless you think of swank as a hipster bar with old wooden tables and handmade resin artwork.

Fortunately, there weren't too many people ahead of us, and surprisingly, we really did get seated after 20 mins!  But as we sat down, a whole throng of people--pairs and groups alike--came through the door and waited to have their names jotted down, while the hostess intermittently tried to solve her sudoku puzzle.\n\nI would definitely describe this place as totally hip and totally loud.  I loved the interior decor of the restaurant, but I really could not get over the ear-aching volume of noise in the room.  Not only did I have to scream across the table to speak, but I also found myself screaming \"What?!\" back at my SO far too many times during our meal.\n\nHowever, I must vouch for their delicious pizza.  I can't say I can compare Little Star to many other Chicago deep dish pizzas (as I've only had UNO's), but I really enjoyed my Classic Deep Dish here.  The crust was very cornmealy and crunchy (although I do kinda like the buttery and somewhat chewy crust that UNO makes), the sausage was tasty, the chunky tomato sauce was flavorful, and the cheese wasn't piled on too high.  \n\nMuch to my surprise, though,the pizza was EVEN better the next day!  I popped a slice into my toaster oven at 300 degrees for about 20 mins, and it was even tastier than I had imagined!!  The pizza juices had more time to soak in, and the crust softened up a bit overnight: THE PERFECT combo for leftover pizza.\n\nI'd come here again, but I'd probably order my pizza to go, like I saw a lot of people do.", "author": "Diane L."}

This purely based taste wise on their thick crust pizzas. \n\nOne problem I have with it is how overpowering the sauce is. I would say the sauce is about 80% of the taste of the pizza no matter the topping (meat or vegetables). All three of our pizzas tasted roughly the same because of this. While I am more than in agreement with the the fact they use fresh ingredients that you can immediately taste, it is not enough to account for a \"good\" pizza. \n\nThe second is I really disliked the corn meal crust texture . It reminded me of eating a crumbly cookie which was not at all appetizing to me while having pizza. \n\nAdmittedly I am more a fan of artisan pizzas. However I've had pizzas with fresh ingredients and sauce that had a taste profile unique enough that I was amazed how I have never tasted anything like it even though it was just a simple pizza. All I got here was the taste of sauce, yipee. \n\nI just don't see this pizza being a real benchmark of any kind. I feel kind of sorry for people that have experienced this pizza as the best they've had, just know that there is much more variety and craftsmanship of pizza out there.", "author": "Andy C."}

Well, it felt slightly cramped but, it's in San Francisco-- what do you expect?\n\nThe pizza here is awesome, plain and simple. I'm not one of those \"pizza experts\" from Chicago, or New York or whatever who claims that a pizza joint isn't as good as that hole in the wall Greasy Eddie's on the corner of 5th and Pretentious in some slum on the east coast. All I know is this pizza is good. Really good. \n\nI, of course, went with the deep-dish style because after I tried that, I never thought of thin crust again. The deep-dish crust is probably the best part of the pizza. I had a veggie pizza with spinach, garlic, and mushrooms--- perfect. The sauce, while it could stand a few more spices thrown in, was also perfect. I used to be a die-hard Patxi's fan but that might be changing...\n\nThe garlic bread-- what can I say about this garlic bread... they give you a sourdough roll sliced. In a separate container you get butter and olive oil whipped together and then a whole BULB of roasted garlic. You spread it all on the bread yourself and it is glorious. I think I liked it even more than the pizza to be honest. \n\nThe beer is a little overpriced but, beer and pizza is like PB and J so, I had to go for it anyway. \n\nThe atmosphere and service were awesome. We hardly waited at all for anything to come out after we ordered it and we were seated within 2 minutes. Granted, it was a Thursday evening so I don't know what the weekends are like but, still impressive. \n\nThe dark and velvety atmosphere is perfect.

I was never wowed. Don't get me wrong, it's deep dish and as Stephen Baldwin said, \"Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.\"\n\nBut those delightful pies were still missing something, even on their hometurf. When you have \"Chicago-style deep dish\" at Little Star or Zachary's, for example, the ingredients taste fresher, the pie is less oily, and the whole experience is just overall... tastier.\n\nNow, to touch upon the Zachary's vs Little Star face-off. Not necessary. They're two different styles of deep dish, and although inherently stem from the same wonderful Chicago origin, they're tough to compare, much less compete. Little Star is much more like its Chicago roots than Zachary's -- it's a little more shallow and has flattened the ingredients internally -- some purists actually prefer that, as they think Zachary's is \"too jumbly in there,\" allowing the extra ingredients to hop around too much.\n\nThe real difference, however, is the crust. Little Star has that cornmeal crust... that's really what it comes down to. If you prefer that, you're a Little Star fan 'til the end. But if you prefer a more traditional wheat crust while still prefering the \"Chicago-style\" to ACTUAL Chicago, then Zachary's is the place for you.\n\nLONG story short, Little Star is delish, just not my preference.

I have friends that have eaten a little bit of Chicago pizza here and there. They have strong opinions about Chicago pizza, and if I'm going to quantify an assessment of Chicago pizza I'd better be able to defend it.\n\nUm. I'm not good under pressure.  I like the pizza. What else? We'll start with comparisons, since this seems to be the norm.  I like Little Star less than I like Patxi's and more than I like Zachary's. I like it less than I like Papa Del's in Champaign, IL, but more than I like Giordano's in Chicago.  The latter might be sort of sacrilegious, but I guess I'm in good company if Little Star is President Obama's fave. \n\nAs far as \"authenticity\", here's where I risk a heated multi-hour debate.  The crust is nice and crunchy, but there's not enough cheese. The quantity of sauce is good, as is the consistency/viscosity.  However, I do agree with Carson H. that an alleged Chicago-style pie that comes out of the oven in 25 minutes is suspect.  45 minutes is a respectable amount of time to wait; an hour is more like it.  Additionally, the California twist is unmistakable in the add-on selections. Artichoke hearts? \"Garlic olive oil base\"? Wtf. Gelato for dessert? Ha.\n\nHowever, I guess \"style\" allows a bit of wiggle room, and I'd say Little Star has successfully re-interpreted the concept of deep-dish Chicago pizza.  If you're looking for a carbon copy of the fare at a classic Chitown joint, prepare to be disappointed. If you're OK with roasted zucchini on your pie, though, I'd definitely recommend LS.", "author": "Janna M."}

They have an ATM right beside their front door, so you really don't need to have a shit-fit about the cash only policy.  You're having Little Star pizza.  Isn't it worth the two buck surcharge?\n\nSomething that you often face when consuming deep-dish pizza is a richness so overwhelming that it can distress one's bowels.  Such is NOT the case here.\n\nThe thick cornmeal crust has a delicious butter-free crunch and bulky texture strong enough to support the weight of the selected toppings.  The fresh vegetable and meat toppings are well-measured and topped with the perfect amount of mozzarella cheese... not too much to make the pizza soggy, yet enough to act as nature's greatest (and tastiest) adhesive.  The zingy tomato sauce has a consistency and flavor of perfectly stewed and reduced tomatoes.

Don't forget to order a can of PBR or Movie Star (champagne cocktail) to wash down all the goodness.\n\nBy the way...

We were greeted by attractive male waiters, which is always a plus.  Truth be told, our own waiter was just cute, but the other guy was quite attractive.  When we walked in, Weezer was playing over the sound system, which we were both fairly indifferent to.  However, a trip over to the jukebox revealed a great music collection.  There had to be around 100 albums, by artists such as Death Cab for Cutie, Iron & Wine, The Postal Service, The Shins, The Pixies, Franz Ferdinand, Pearl Jam, David Bowie, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was quite nice- we got there when it was still rather quiet, but it started getting more interesting as the night went on.  There was a definite buzz in Little Star.  The decorations were a nice mix of modern, elegant, and classic.  The lighting was on the dark side, but for the atmosphere and furnishings, it definitely worked, and did not commit the oft-commited crime of overdone, hindering, mood-dampering darkness.\r\n\r\nTo start out, we ordered the garlic bread.  The waiter came out with warm, fresh sourdough bread, a lot of butter with a tad bit of olive oil mixed it, and a large roasted garlic bulb cut in half so that we could get at the sweet, delicious roasted garlic insides.   It was absolutely brilliant, and worked perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe pizza wasn't so shabby, either, to say the least.  We ordered the \"Little Star.\"  Deep dish with a savory pie-like crust, it really \"hit the spot.\"  On top of the crust was the cheese (just strong enough, but not too strong...perfect pizza cheese) and sauce and toppings over that.  I  been avoiding the cliche Zachary's/Little Star comparison (funny that after only about a year there's already a cliche), but here I must interject- they definitely copied Zachary's, but it's so good, who could object?  The sauce was a nice strong tomatoe sauce that I cannot say enough about.  The toppings were great- feta, ricotta, spinach, mushrooms, onion, and garlic.\r\n\r\nGo on a casual date, go with lots of friends, go on your own and sit at the bar- you're sure to at least have great food, an attractive waiter,a dn hopefully a great time.", "author": "Alyssa O."}

Most deep dish pizzas are not Chicago style, which consists of high wall crusts, thick bottoms, and SAUCE ON TOP of the cheese and toppings. Pizza Hut tried to put out a Chicago style deep dish and let me say, it was probably the worst pizza I've ever tasted. But they did put the sauce on top (well actually, they brought you a bowl of sauce you had to put on your pizza yourself for some reason). \r\n\r\nFinally, a place outside of Chicago that sells deep dish pizza! Almost as good as the real thing, the bottom part isn't as thick as it should be. I don't know why anyone would get thin crust here since you can get that anywhere in the city.

I've never actually had Chicago style pizza before, so I wanted to find a place that people raved about. After a few searches on google, I wanted to try this place. \n\nIt's hard trying to find parking and the wait is ridiculously long. I put my name on the list for three people and the wait was an hour. It's super dark and hot inside. So we decided to just take it to go. It was a better alternative than standing outside for an hour. \n\nAs for food, the pizza was better than I expected. I ordered a Classic Deep Dish and it was SooOooOo good. I also ordered some chickens. Not the best chicken wings I've ever had, but pretty good still. I wish I would've gotten an order of the homemade cheesecake, but it was too much for me. \n\nVery friendly staff, but the place is too small. I would still recommend it.", "author": "Joy D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-14", "description": "I tried Little Star Pizza for the first time tonight, and I may be a little biased, because we went there after biking for 6 hours in chilling grey fog, and all I could think about was how much I wanted deep dish pizza like Zachary's! I was also starving, so to me, even the sourdough (which you have to pay $4.50 for, but it comes with butter sauce and a whole roasted garlic) was like the best thing I ever tasted. And just earlier I was ranting about how I'm so sick of having sourdough at every SF restaurant.\n\nSo instead of just writing a review of Little Star, I'm presenting you with a play-by-play of how Zachary's and Little Star compare -- since the subject consumed a good part of my husband's and my dinner conversation! Now I KNOW some of you say that there's no point comparing Zachary's to Little Star, but you have to admit, it's pretty much inevitable -- and they really aren't THAT different pizza-wise, except for the crust! They LOOK identical and are priced VERY similarly!\n\nWe got Little Star's parallel to our Zachary's favorite -- Spinach and Mushroom -- so it was pretty easy to start drawing comparisons!\n\nSo here goes...\n\nWAITING:\n(wait times were comparable -- close to an hour during peak time)\nLS - Had a nice couch and a bar where you can order drinks and appetizers while you wait. For a 45-minute wait, didn't feel very crowded.\nZP - People stand in line inside and out and crowd around the counter. You can go for a walk around Rockridge though which is nice.\n\nPRICE:\nLS - $18/9\" and $23/12\" -- small is still more than enough for 2! That's about 3, 1.5\"-thick slices a person!\nZP - $18/10\" and $23/12\" plus they have 14\"\n\nSAUCE/TOMATOES:\nBoth are very similar and perfect in my opinion. Little Star maybe tastes a little more savory -- almost roasted. The mozzerella was chewy and delicious and comparable as well.\n\nFILLINGS:\nLS - More generous with the spinach and mushrooms. But we paid $1.50 to add sun-dried tomatoes, and there was seriously about 1 sun-dried tomato per slice. Sad, because they were good... and sad, cause we paid for them!\nZP - More generous with the tomatoes -- and maybe they go a little overboard. It's more like tomato pizza than spinach/mushroom pizza. The toppings are more mixed, which may affect my perceptions.\n\nCRUST: (THE BIG DIFFERENCE)\nLS - Buttery, cornbread crust -- like a pan pizza. Crispy and porous, not doughy or chewy. Delicious flavor and crunchy cornbread texture. Nothing like typical pizzas or Zachary's. Apparently this is more like \"real Chicago pizza.\"\nZP - Chewy crust that's more like traditional pizza crust but kind of flaky/layered like baklava or pie. When it's fresh, it's almost too crispy on the bottom and hurts my sensitive teeth, but when it's leftover and a little chewier, it's PERFECT and JUST like crust I had in Italy. Features BONUS soggy (in a good way) crust layer between the toppings and tomatoes. This is my favorite part about Zachary's, so I missed that at Little Star.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nLS - Featured 100% San Francisco hipsters. The loud, hip atmosphere and dim mood lighting aligned perfectly with the crowd. Our first reaction was, man, it's dark in here. It felt like a club.\nZP - A bit more \"Berkeley\" -- earthy and artsy and diverse. Not overly-polished or slick. Features pizza-shaped art. More bright and sunny.\n\nOVERALL:\nIf you're craving deep-dish pizza, it's good to know that satisfaction awaits, regardless of which side of the Bay you're on! Both are a bit expensive for pizza, but both are totally worth it.", "author": "Alexa A."}

That's right, I said it, and you should have known this already. Golden Boy is my favorite so far but after trying Little Star it's going to be my local favorite (the schlop on Lower Haight is only good for drunk eating).\n\nAmbiance (4): Standard issue hipster-ish interior with low lights, mixture of wood and metal, and some art on the wall. Not complaining, it's good to go, just not what I expect of a pizza joint. \n\nFood (4): They are known for their deep dish but after going to Chicago a few times, I have sworn off deep dish pizza. It's just too much...too much! We had a thin crust with pancetta, goat cheese, chicken, and I don't remember what else (it had me at pancetta). It was pretty tasty and the crust was good and crisp. We ordered the smaller size since we were having wings too and it was just the right size. The chicken wings were not bad, but I haven't had a chicken wing that doesn't remind me of microwaveable buffalo wings since Sports Grill (new English rule: double negative bad, triple negative good). This might be related to the wings not being grilled, which is my preferred wing preparation method. In terms of drinks, I appreciate that they have tempranillo and malbec in stock in addition to the usual suspects, so if you like red wine, they are bound to have something that appeals to your tastes. Of course they have beer and white wine too. Also the 10 dollar corkage fee is appreciated.\n\nService (4): Great, friendly service. The timing of the dishes arriving was perfect and I don't know if it's coincidence or the server putting in the order in a certain way or us eating at just the right rate. Anyway, I felt welcomed and being taken care of without the incessant and forced niceties of some fancy restaurants (I am looking at you Gary Danko). There always seems to be a wait to get a table though, but what can you do when the place has good foodie cred?\n\nValue (4): The prices of all menu items seemed just right. That includes the cost of drinks and I already mentioned the corkage fee.\n\nOverall: I liked this place but did not love it like I do Golden Boy. The quality is good and the flavors were good but just not amazing. However, this the best option in my area, so next time take out will be the way to go to avoid the wait.

It's pretty obvious that they specialize in deep dish and I am surprised by the people who review this place with utter conviction without talking about the deep dish. That being said, I'm more of a fan of Italian style pizza--no, not quite NY, I like it rustic, fresh, simple, and crisp.\n\nIf you like deep dish you will probably like the zza here. It's got a great crust--can't really describe it. It is cornmealy but it's not like cornbread. It's buttery but it's not like pie crust. It's the kind of crust that I wouldn't like for anything but deep-dish pizza.\n\nThe fillings are also good--fresh veggies and springy cheese topped with a hearty and acidic tomato sauce. So it's the best deep dish I've had and the price was reasonable.\n\nThe only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because I still don't get deep-dish.", "author": "Shawn T."}

While both of them have their similarities, they each have distinct differences that make me love both of them equally.\n\nSimilarities:\n1)They both serve wonderfully delicious deep dish pizza. (Obviously).\n\n2)Both restaurants are CASH only operations.  Be sure to make an ATM stop before going to either.\nUPDATE: Zachary's now takes plastic.\n\n3)No reservations are taken at either place, so be prepared for a wait.\n\nDifferences:\n1)  The crust-Little Star's crust is corn meal based which is more traditional with Chicago-style pizza.  The crust is crisper than Zachary's layered crust.  \n\n2)Accessibility-Zachary's is more accessible to the public as the Rockridge location is a short walk from BART.  Also free parking (after 6pm) is available at the BART station.  Parking can be difficult in the Western Addition.  Plus, no pay-lots are nearby.\n\n3)Ambiance-Zachary's is well lit and family friendly.  Little Star reminds me of a bar with its dimly lit dining room, jukebox, and echoing din of the crowd in the dining room.\n\n4)Leftovers-Zachary's holds up better the next day than Little Star.  Trust me.  I did a side by side taste test.  I heated both in the oven and Zachary's pie tasted just as fresh as the night before.  The same cannot be said for Little Star.", "author": "mandy f."}

The sauce was good and the toppings were fine but the crust was like eating a pizza on flatbread.  It might just be I'm used to a bit doughier crust but after all the talk, I was kind of underwhelmed.  The chicken wings we got as a starter were fine, cooked well but no zip to them (although that might have just been because my friend ordered them that way).

I actually prefer it to Zachary's, Giordano's, and other deep dish styles I have tried in Chicago. But I had the funniest experience last time at Little Star that I have to share...\n\nSo not a busy night so there appears to be one or two servers covering the dining room. I just want to charge my bill to my card and my waiter appears busy so I signal the hostess who is walking by. She actually looks straight forward and pushes my hand out of the way. \n\nOkay fine so I see there is someone behind the bar next to the cash register so I ask if he can just charge my card. He responds that he is manning the takeout station so I'll have to wait for my waiter.\n\nTen minutes go by and my waiter hasn't come to my table. But I notice that the guy behind the bar and the hostess are both sitting around doing nothing. So I stare at the guy behind the bar. He nervously notices I am watching him. He moves side to side. He takes one step to the side, lifts up the fold down section of the bar. Hides behind it so my view is obscured. Looks over to see that I'm still staring at him, and moves back so I can't see him. Still doing nothing. Not helping any customers. Not cleaning the bar. Not pouring any drinks. Just looking too cool for school and not wanting to be helpful in any way, or even signal my waiter.\n\nWaiter comes 10 minutes later. I tip him generously because he was busy and helpful. Too bad the staff probably pools the tips so it went to the useless hostess and cashier too.\n\nI am not from this country so it still shocks me that staff in many American restaurants refuse to help customers at other tables that they are not serving directly.", "author": "Lorenzo C."}

Very tasty and a perfect size for two with the salad.  \r\n\r\nThe food was delicious and even better that we didn't have to wait for a table.  This place is uber popular right now and my only real complaint was feeling a bit rushed out and the initial slow service.  Once the wine did come out (11 minutes after ordering) everything was smooth.  Would probably take out next time.  Ambiance was fine, just don't need tablecloth / turn the table service when I'm out for pizza.\r\n\r\nVisit #2 - Until this visit I hadn't eaten a deep dish pizza I'd order over any thin crust version.  Now, I DREAM about a deep dish Little Star.  Amazing.  The crust, the sauce, the toppings were incredible!  Trying to get a table however is a nightmare, borderline insulting.  If I get reminded that, \"You need your ENTIRE party to be here, inside the door to be seated\" I just may bypass their pizza altogether.........maybe not.  Come on!  Where in SF that is popular can you get seated without your entire party?  I don't really need the visible reminder nor the insulting barking from the hostess.  She actually threatened to not seat our party of 8 unless we made the 9:40 check-in time with our entire party.  Just a little TOO much.  For this, I take it down from 4 to 3 stars.

So, I put Little Star to the ultimate test: taking my Chicago native fiancee in for dinner with a couple of friends visiting from the Midwest.  Verdict?  It stood up favorably against Chicago strongholds like Giordano's.  \n\nI think it's the cornmeal crust ... this nice, crispy but crumbly bottom layer that meshes beautifully with the melted cheese and sauce and toppings.  I'm a big fan of the classic dish (sausage, bell peppers, tomato), but really: everything is good.  Also, the garlic bread is worth killing for: half a loaf of sliced sourdough served with a dish of butter and several gooey roasted garlic cloves.  \n\nThere's usually a wait here, so plan accordingly. Thankfully, the bar has Racer 5 IPA on tap and a better-than-average wine selection to take the sting out (try the Malbec if you're into reds!) -- not to mention a killer jukebox.

This place has won Best of the Bay- Pizza for at least the last 3 straight years. I went for my first time recently and was beyond impressed by everything except the d\u00e9cor. The place opens at 5pm, but since there was a big party that day, they had their door open at 4:30pm. As the party was walking in, I walked in and was seated immediately. None of this, \"We aren't officially open, so you'll have to wait,\" crap you'd get at pretty much any other restaurant. I was very impressed by this.\n\nThe rest of the lunch/dinner went great. Even though there were at least 20 people in the big party, another table with 2 people, and then my 2 top, we were treated just the same as we would be if we were the only people in the restaurant. I think they only had 2 servers at the time, so again, impressive. I got the Little Star pizza because it's good to order the dish named after the restaurant and I'm not big on meat (spinach, feta, ricotta, mushrooms, onions, garlic). It was amazing. The crust was great and the tomatoes on top were so unbelievably fresh. I've been to Uno's in Chicago and I like Little Star better. Yeah, I said it. One thing I read in the comments was that the crust was buttery- I disagree. I thought the pizza crust was going to be like eating a croissant, but it wasn't. Just the cornmealy goodness you would expect. By the way, the pizza heats up great, too.\n\nThe only MINOR issue with the place is that black curtains cover the windows and walls.

The table we sat at was clean and overall the place was very well kept.\n\nTHE FOOD OOOOH THE FOOD\nMy wife and I had the 9\" deep dish classic, the garlic bread, and roasted wings.  The first thing to arrive of course was the garlic bread and oh my what a sight it was to see.  I was happily surprised to see that the bread was soft and hot, as most places serve rather cold, crusty bread sharp enough to cut diamond.  Along with the bread was a side of pillow soft butter and a bulb, a mutha FRACKIN BULB MANG, of yummy roasted garlic that spread on the bread with absolute ease.  The hot hottie bread was followed up by hot, perfectly seasoned wings that had a tad bit of spice on them tempered by what tasted a like a creamy cool blue cream cheese ranch deep and cold crunchy carrots. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of this visit by far was the deep dish.  The deep dish is simply a delight to eat with it's stringy gooey cheese, zesty tomato sauce and fresh and I mean FRESH veggies.  Every savory, hot and juicy bite made me want to eat more.  \n\nOVERALL RECOMMENDATIONS:\nSanfranciscan and tourist alike should all try this place.  The prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is awesome and the food will make you do a happy dance.  Please keep in mind that we went early, like when they opened early so we had no trouble getting a table and got our food very fast, but should you go later in the evening this place is known for getting packed fast so if your starving get there at a reasonable time.", "author": "JiujitsuGrinds X."}

So after moving away, I felt a pizza-shaped void in my heart and belly - that is until my friend introduced me to a little pizza place around the block from my pad called Little Star.\n\nBasically all you need do for this place is get a group of 4 friends and get one thin-crust and one deep-dish.  The thin and crispy slices go hand-in-hand with the thick and crunchy deep-dish pies.  My two favorites are the deep-dish \"little star\" and the thin-crust \"white pie\".  I'm not a vegetarian; however these pies are and the toppings on these pies complement each other perfectly as well as the particular crust they're on top of.\n\nOne drawback to this place, however, is that there is always a really, really long wait, so give your name to the host/hostess and get a brewski (or more) @ many of the bars on Divisadero.

Well lemme tell ya -- it only occurs to me after spending some quality time at one of the bars across the street and those aren't the times when I'm willing to wait an hour for a table...especially when that crappy pizza place down the block will sell me a slice in five minutes.\n\nSo THAT'S why I'd never eaten at Little Star.\n\nBut then last week by homies and I were feeling peckish and they suggested we go across the street to Little Star. I was like KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT! I'm not leaving this bar stool just to go stand around and wait in a hot pizza joint for an hour.\n\nBut THEN I remembered that something at Little Star called the Brass Monkey is on 7x7's list of 100 things to eat in SF before you die:\n\nhttp://www.7x7.com/content/eat-drink/big-eat-sf-100-things-try-you-die\n\nAnd I like crossing things off lists more than I like sitting at bars so we headed across the street, put our name on the list and spent the next hour trying to stand at the bar while also not annoying the crap out of the servers who were trying to work.\n\nOur wait ended up being longer than expected, but everyone there was SO DARN NICE that it didn't matter. I had a lovely conversation with the bartender, Jessica, about getting her Ph.D and about how disappointed I was that none of the male patrons were hot and about snow globes from Austin.\n\nThe upside to waiting for a table is that you can pre-order your pizza with the hostess so that when you DO sit down, you don't have to wait too long. So we sat down, ordered some garlic bread (that was actually a loaf of bread served with a head of roasted garlic and a thing of butter) and ate our pizza.\n\nMy homies were a-okay with ordering the Brass Monkey so I could check it off my list and BOY HOWDY, we weren't disappointed. It turns out, the Brass Monkey isn't even on the menu (how In-n-Out of you, Little Star!), but if a sausage, spinach and feta pizza sounds like it would even remotely float your boat, I highly recommend it.\n\nIt's definitely knife-and-fork pizza -- not something you'd order to eat while watching the big game -- and I know that there's a big pizza debate raging on in the pizza world and that if you can't fold it up and eat it standing up, it's not real pizza, but whatever.

Though I get that some folks don't like deep dish, that's basically the whole reason for this pizza.  Unlike Zachery's it's not stuffed -- it's a more or less traditional Chicago style deep dish with a cornmeal crust.  In addition, the service is generally good and the atmosphere is pleasing, unlike a traditional pizza parlor.   \n\nThat said, it's long past time for Little Star to start taking reservations.  Their wait times at both restaurants regularly run more than an hour and there is very little room to wait.  On a recent Tuesday at 8:30 PM, we were told the wait time would be 1 and 1/2 hours.  That would have had us eating more than 2 hours later.  \n\nIt's actually painful to write this, since I've been a fan from the very start, I've been going there less and less.  Given the wait times and lack of waiting space, their unwillingness to take reservations shows a level of disregard for their customers that I find off-putting and rude.   \n\nLittle Star, I want to keep loving you, but my patience is running out.", "author": "Rose H."}

We went with one deep dish and one thin, both pepperoni and sausage. To our waiter's surprise we demolished every last bit. Deep dish pizza is one of my favorite things and this rivaled the best I've had in Chicago and outshone several of them. The crust was the perfect blend of crispy buttery-ness and pillow-y lightness.

You may walk right on by if you weren't looking for it. We came here on our 2nd night in town. Craving for some wholesome food, we found this place. \n\nIt was a breezy night and we had given our names to the host. 1hr wait for a party of 6. Ouch! Well, we decide to wait outside, there wasn't much space inside for everyone, including other parties who were waiting. Yes, there's tons of people waiting to be seated here. Must be good huh?\n\nWell, a little over an hour passes and we are finally seated. Whew! We immediately order a couple glasses of their house wine (red). Mmmmm! I love me a good buzz especially with Italian food. And we start off with some appetizers. We order (2) Garlic bread: warm sourdough bread, served with a blend of butter &amp;amp; evoo and a bulb of roasted garlic ($4.50), (1) Caprese salad: fresh mozzarella served with slices of tomatoes, basil and drizzled with evoo and balsamic vinegar ($9.00) and (1) Mixed salad: mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, red bell peppers, red onions, gorgonzola cheese, chopped walnuts tossed with housemade vinegarette dressing ($6 small, $9 large). For our main dishes we decided on: (1) Large deep dish 12\" Classic: sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers and onions ($17 small, $22 large) and (1) Large deep dish 12\" Little Star: spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions and garlic ($18 small, $23 large). The crust is made up of cornbread. You can taste the different layers of ingredients placed upon this badboy. From the crunchy crust, warm gooey cheese and the textured tomatoe which lay above it all. It was great! My overall experience with Little Star is one to be remembered and passed on.

All three with their own brand of awesome.\n\nThing 1: Garlic bread.\nI've eaten some serious garlic bread in my day, as my love handles will attest to, but nowhere have I seen a presentation like this one before. Warm sourdough (if my tastebuds don't deceive me) with a crispy crust sliced just thick enough, with a ridiculous amount of butter that you apply yourself, as with the garlic. The bread's good enough to eat alone. Just imagine what butter and garlic do. It's like the holy trinity of taste. Or so I'd think if I hadn't had...\n\nThing 2: Chicken wings.\nWhile I've definitely had my fair share of both breads and pizzas, I have not once eaten chicken wings before. I don't know how. I don't know why. Mostly, I don't know how I survived without eating these particular wings. I'm salivating as I'm writing this. I'm wondering if they're still open right now so I can run blocks over there and get more. A bit of spice, plenty of sauce, cooked nice and soft so it comes off the bone... and onto mine.\n\nThing 3: Special of the day: deep dish barbecue chicken pizza\nHere I think is where my opinion deviates from my gf's. I prefer thin crust. I'm not the world's biggest barbecue sauce fan. I won't rave about this pizza like I do Things 1 & 2, but despite the fact that the pizza wasn't what I'd design for myself (next time I'll get the thin crust Mediterranean chicken, which sounds quite my style), the quality was such that I will definitely return, even if I don't get my coveted wings. I can tell a good pizza, even without my favorite ingredients. The cornmeal crust was appropriately firm without any blackened areas or mushy bits, the ingredients were fresh and the cilantro nice and perky-- good combo with the barbecue sauce, I might add. I will say: I just told my gf what I wrote, and when I said I wasn't the pizza's biggest fan, she said in a meek voice, \"I thought it was good.\" So there you have it. It was good, because she is always right (and I happily finished my leftovers about an hour ago).\n\nObviously I care about food more than anything else, but I'll also say, in case I haven't made this long enough yet, that the service was good, the decor was cool, I liked the art, and we didn't have to wait for a table for a late Sunday lunch.", "author": "Shaina 'Occasionally Rahn' K."}

Never ever.\"  Clearly, these people have never tasted the perfection that is Little Star pizza.  \n\nThe thin crust style is very good and they use just the right amount of sauce (not too sloppy, not too dry).  The deep-dish pizza is made with an incredible cornmeal crust that makes me wanna curl up with it and snuggle.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-12-24", "description": "Edit: A year later, my heart has warmed significantly more to Little Star, and frankly, now that I simply call in an order, step over the masses, and walk out with my pizza nullifies most of my complaints.  Take off half a star if you don't live in the neighborhood.  Also, I'm not catching BART to Zachary's, even if I grew up eating their deep dish well before Little Star.  Eff that noise.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's a wonderful feeling to have a restaurant that I can use as a landmark to tell people where I live.\n\nIt's an even more wonderful feeling to be able to walk out of my apartment, turn my head, see a traffic light turn green, and be able to sprint across the street and be right at Little Star.\n\nI've never been masochistic enough to try to eat here on a Friday or Saturday night, but I know that Sundays can be a bit of a nightmare, with half-hour to forty-five minute waits.   \n\nThe jukebox leans toward hipster (as do some of the clientele), but has enough classic hip-hop gems to keep things interesting -- I seem to always put on some Digable Planets whenever I eat.  It's dark, but that's not necessarily a terrible thing.\n\nEnough about the ambience, though; Little Star is all about the food.  Deep dish that rivals Zachary's for Best of the West.  Good appetizers, including excellent salads and wonderful garlic bread.  Champagne cocktails that work well with the food.\n\nIf I were single, I'd say that it's a great place for a first date, if you don't find yourself flirting with a waitress.  As a taken man, it's a wonderful spot to take your lady on a weeknight and enjoy great food and a dimly lit, intimate vibe.  Takeout is an option and works well with a nice bottle of red, but there's something about ordering a \"Pom-pagne\" with dinner that just works.\n\nThis is one of those times that a half-star addition on Yelp would be nice, but whatevs.  The long waits, above par (but nothing to call home about) thin crust, and the \"being closed on Monday\" thing are ding-worthy, even with hipster-magnetism aside.  No superlatives, no bullshit, there are few places in SF with better pizza than Little Star.", "author": "Sterling M."}

Lou Malnatti's in Chicago.  Now that's a good pie!  Just too far away.\n\nWhat took me by complete surprise was the thin crust.  My friends and I ordered a small cheese thin crust as well as the deep dish and I couldn't keep my hands of it.  Man it was good!  Crust was crispy, perfect sauce/cheese ratio and the ingredients were were very high quality.

I usually get the classic deep dish but don't mind the occasional foray into thin crust territory, especially for the pesto chicken.

My friend and I went around 7pm on a Sunday night and were seated immediately, though maybe just by luck because when we left there looked to be a long wait. Everything on the menu looked great but in my opinion all the thin crust pizzas were priced $2-3 more than the usual \"specialty\" pizza restaurant in NYC (like Roberta's). We decided on thin crust Italian and deep dish vegetarian to share. Thin crust Italian came out first (and fast!) and it was actually way better than I expected.. something about the garlicky crust was unique to what I've had before. Trying not to make ourselves full we anxiously awaited the deep dish vegetarian. SO GOOD. We took home the leftovers and let me tell you.. they were just as good cold.

Maybe I simply don't like deep dish pizza and therefore too biased to review a place like this.  But we all need someone to jump off the bandwagon once in a while, right?\n\nThe four of us went to Little Star on Divisadero first and found a waiting list of at least an hour.  So we wandered into Mission looking for Pauline's as a substitute and ended up finding another Little Star on Valencia!  This time we were extremely lucky that the four people who were next on the list were nowhere to be found.  So our wait time was zero minutes.\n\nI like the decor of Valencia Little Star better than Divisadero Little Star.  Less dark, more modern.  It was a bit loud because of the exposed brick walls, but I have a deep fondness for exposed brick walls so I tell myself I can live with the loudness.  Seating is crowded but charming and still comfortable.  They have the cutest coasters that look like they were bought in a Museum store.  \n\nI had a small mixed salad and it was fine.  Good amount of cheese and nuts to fill me up.  No overpowering dressing which is a good sign. \n\nI didn't try any pizza this time.  My dinner companions liked their pizza, although they did comment that the taste was a bit strong at first and pizza was kinda greasy.  Nevertheless, they liked it. \n\nThe wait staff looked, um, ready to go home.  Our waitress was either super tired or totally uninterested in us.

My friends and I ordered a thin crust pizza with half pesto chicken and half classic.  To me, it was lacking a lot of flavors, and it was kind of bland; the only thing it had going for it is the fact that the thin crust is a crusty bottom.  Those are very hard to come by nowadays because most pizzeria have the soggy fold 'em up thin crust and I personally hate those.  Yeah, I don't have anything else to say about the pizza, it's OK.

We had essentially no wait since we sat at the bar and we even went on a Saturday night. \n\nThe pizza itself was delicious, the chunky sauce on top is killer! Let's just say that I've gone from never having any deep dish to being a complete convert (I can only imagine what the real Chicago stuff is like!).

Then pesto chicken pizza thin crust was ok, the chicken was dry.\n\nHowever, there were a few weird things about Little Star that our group found odd.  First, the garlic bread came out \"unprepared\", so there were slices of toasted bread with a small tub of butter/fat and a roasted bulb of garlic that we had to make ourselves.  Frankly, I prefer my garlic bread to come out ready to eat already.  If I have to prep it, I might as well have stayed at home.  Second, the spicy buffalo wings weren't \"buffalo style\" at all.  It's like oven baked chicken wings with pepper and no hot sauce no ranch.  It was still good after a few dashes of tabasco, but just weird they say they are \"buffalo wings\".  The last thing is they don't offer pitchers of beer.  For a pizza joint, I guess that was all surprising to us.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very dark and it was hard to even see how much pepper flakes I was shaking onto my pizza.\n\nOverall, the food was good and service was really good.

I called them a little after they opened on Saturday, I ordered the Little Star deep dish and a pepperoni deep dish for my kids. I ordered the pizza to go because I did not want to deal with the crowds or the difficult parking. I was told that it would take 30 min to bake, and when I got there in 35 min, the pizza was ready as promised. I was surprised that the place was not that crowded that night. Maybe because it was still only 5:30, and would get crowded later. Also, very disappointed that they do not accept credit cards!\n\nWhen we got home and ate the pizza, I admit the pizza was good, but the sauce was very salty. The crust was excellent, but my wife and I really miss eating the deep dish from Pizzeria Uno. Our favorite there was the Spinoccoli pizza.

[side note: this is not exactly true. According to Little Star staff, someone at Little Star gave their recipe to a restaurant in Louisiana, where the Prez ate it and had it it flown to DC from there, not SF]\n\nOk, so I finally ventured over to Little Star. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, but I still think Zachary's spinach mushroom stuffed pizza is simply better than the comparable \"Little Star.\" Here's why:\n\n-The cornmeal crust is nice and crispy, but the texture just doesn't work for me.  The grit from the cormeal was strangely distracting and unappetizing. \n\n-Tomatoes: Zachary's are just more flavorful and juicy. These were fine, but didn't give me the flavorgasm that I always get at Zach's.\n\n-Spinach: LS leaves the leaves rather intact, meaning you get the spiny bits that make for a chewy, messy eating experience and a much more pronounced spinach flavor. At Zachary's, they chop up the spinach and remove said spiny bits, so you know there's spinach but you're not overwhelmed by it. \n\nAlso, I gotta say you get more bang for your buck at Zachary's. I'm usually stuffed silly by two slices there. At Little Star, I ate four and was still hungry. However, Little Star's mixed salad is f-ing amazing and put's Zachary's attempts at salad to shame. And I don't even like salads. Get one. \n\nI also appreciate the fine selection of beverages at Little Star (cocktails AND beer AND wine) and the fabulous jukebox , so I gotta say for a dine-in experience Little Star beats Zachary's, but on pizza merit alone, Zachary's is and always will be the champ.", "author": "Reina G."}

Their signature 'little star' deep dish was excellent: substantial without feeling heavy, not burying the spinach taste in garlic and cheese but also not coming off like a bowl of roasted vegetables dumped on a pizza crust.  It was ready on time and hot.  Two things keep it from being five stars for me:\n1)They don't deliver.  This is probably a completely unrealistic thing to expect of them, but it's nevertheless inconvenient if one doesn't have a car handy.  It happens that I'm lucky enough to have a parking space and a car, but I think a car-based business (even partially/inadvertently) doesn't quite earn the 5th star.\n2)They're also just expensive enough to require a (again, probably unrealistic) level of stand-out taste.  I think they're great, probably the best I've had in the Bay Area, but they didn't change the way I think about pizza or anything, so I can't quite give them the fifth star for this on a taste basis either.\n\nObviously, I'll be back, and maybe I'll  re-rate higher, but right now I'm just not quite ready to give all five.", "author": "Nathan P."}

It's a pretty small place, easy to miss unless you looking for (especially at night).\n\nI ordered the classic, and deep dish. It was delicious. The crust has a wonderful texture: crispy on the bottom and soft in the middle. The toppings were very top notch, none of the disgusting stuff you see at most pizza chains. The bartender was very nice, and kept my drinks coming. Altogether, the taste of the pizza was superb. Everything mixed together so well: the texture of the crust, the flavor of the toppings If the taste of the cheese, and the amount of sauce.\n\nIt does have a very long wait list, so if you go on a weekend be prepared for that. The interior is small, but charming, being decorated with all sorts of interesting trinkets. It's worth a visit if you're anywhere in the Western division and hungry for some pizza.

Service was par, not sub and definitely not above.  Salads were good, albeit too heavy on the cheese (when the only other choice on the menu is pizza, duh, go light on the cheese!).  ...it's the kind of place to bring four friends, then have mini, scream-in-his/her-ear chats on the side.  Plus, there's a LOT of pizza to share.  ...makes for great leftovers!\n\nFavorite pie: thin crust with artichoke hearts, tomatoes & garlic...haven't tried the meat pies, but sure they're good, too!  Deep dish pies almost feel like Chicago, but with less grease.  The deepest, please!\n\nS'more drawbacks:\n(1) the front door never stays shut, so if you're sitting or waiting to sit near the door at night, bring layers.  Brrrr!\n(2) the music is definitely awesome (contemporary indie hits mixed with 80s & 90s classics), but everytime I've been inside (3 now), it's always way TOO loud!  I'm used to yelling at a bar, but when I go out to dinner, it's nice to eat AND socialize, not just stuff my face and constantly cup my ear, like \"What?!\"\n\nSolution: Get take-out (way better than Stelladoro's just down the street) or maybe try for a night when the speakers are blown.\n\n...Great food ruined by too much noise!", "author": "Carrot C."}

Not sure why, i generally never get cravings for it, but none the less, I had a craving and it wasn't going away. I hopped on yelp and after reading briefly it didn't seem like a hard choice: Little Star was the place to go for deep dish pizza in San Francisco. \nTo add to my later disappointment, my girlfriend wasn't at all in the mood for it, but I did one hell of a job convincing her how good it would be so she hopped on board. \n\nWe peeped the menu on-line and ordered the 'classic' and 'little star' 9\" deep dish pizza's. The garlic bread also got a nice review so we added that to the mix. The nice gentlemen on the phone confirmed my order, gave me my total and informed me that it was cash only. I liked that he did this because I've been to multiple places that haven't and it really sucks when you show up with just a credit card. \n\nSo, parking wasn't easy but since I knew I'd be quick i blocked the parking structure next door, ran in and grabbed my food. The place was packed and actually looked like it would be a fun place to grab a beer and pizza. My food was ready and they had me out of there in just a minute. So far so good. \nI get home and I can already taste the food. we open up both boxes, dig in, and I just give my girlfriend a look. She can tell, and she starts laughing(a sympathetic laugh) because she knew how much i was looking forward to this. \nThe pizza certainly wasn't terrible. It just wasn't really that good. The crust is very different. I believe its cornmeal which seems to be why some people love it, but not this guy. The peppers and mushrooms on mine weren't flavorful and the texture was very bad. All in all just not good. \nMy girlfriend was pretty blah with her description as well but I generally don't like spinach pizza so i didn't try. The sausage chunks were large which was nice, and tasty, but the pizza just didn't do anything for me. \nAbout 10 minutes after my first bite we realized we ordered the garlic bread and got excited again because we thought that may salvage a little bit of dinner. Well, we opened the bag, found a loaf wrapped in foil with a plastic container that had butter inside. I opened the foil and didn't smell any garlic. They just gave us bread and f'in butter. At this point I nearly hit myself in the face with a beer bottle. I may have given the place 3 stars initially(since they don't have 2.5), but not after this. \nOne of the 5 star reviews I read below actually said they consider this better than the deep dish they have in Chicago. I have never been to downtown Chicago, but I've been to the outskirts. I've also had deep dish all over the northeast and I don't know what the hell this person is talking about. Generally i consider Pizzeria Uno to be 'airport/mall' food, but I guarantee if I lined up the 'Chicago classic' from uno against the 'classic' from little star, I think people who love little star would fall over from how good the Chicago classic is. I just really can't believe that this is considered awesome deep dish pizza. \n\nI'm going home for Christmas very soon, and there are a ton of great places to eat high end food. I won't be going to any of those places however. They have those here in the Bay. No, when i land back east, it's gonna be all about chicken wings, pizza and deli sandwiches.

The pizza here is top notch and very tasty.  However, the ridiculously long wait times, plus the snottiness and rudeness of the host here takes away from the charm of the place and knocked it down to 3 stars instead of 4 for me.  \n\nThe host had given us an estimated wait time of 1 hour...an hour and 20 minutes later, we watched as he sat another large party who came in after us..I went up to ask him why he was seating them before us, and he snapped back at me that they were on the list before us.  If that's true, fine..but it seemed like he knew these people & were giving them the table because of that.  When i gently pointed out to him that we had been waiting a long period over the time he had given us, he decided it was good customer service to tell me that I hadn't been waiting an hour and 20...but an hour and 10 minutes instead.  And he didn't say it nicely either.  He was outright rude, and a flat out ASSHOLE.  Very unnecessary and uncalled for, and if the manager of Little Star is reading this...he's the shorter, thin mustached/bearded host with long hair pulled back into a ponytail.  This was Saturday Jan 17th. RUDE RUDE RUDE.  He should NOT be in the service industry if he doesn't know what it means to treat customers with kindness. \n\nWe were finally seated about 20 minutes after that..and the food was very good.  We started with appetizer of :\n\nSpicy Chicken Wings - pound of wings served with baby carrots and blue cheese dressing $9 - these were delicious. VERY good. spicy & not overly sauced.  \n\nClassic Deep Dish pizza - sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers & onions $22 (for large) - the deep dish pizzas are definitely the way to go. TONS of toppings, piping hot and cheesy, for crust lovers (like me!) the crust is a deliciously crunchy buttery indulgence. \n\nThin Crust Chicken Pesto - pesto sauce, roasted chicken, mushrooms & onions -$17 (for small) - also very good, but in deep dish i think it would have been even better! \n\nFYI:  the large/small sizes did not seem to differ much at all.  it was right in front of me, and I couldn't tell the difference.", "author": "Lulu C."}

Dare I say...better than in Chicago *GASP!*\n\nI am from Chicago (well, if you want to get technical - Buffalo Grove - but I still say \"pop\" and \"maaahm\" instead of \"soda\" and \"mom.\") so I am very picky about my deep dish. When a restaurant claims to be Chicago-style, I get really easily annoyed about the tendency in SF to \"Californify\" all the wonderful, artery-clogging specialties of other regions. Little Star, however, has managed to hit the ball out of Wrigley with their rendition of deep-dish pizza.\n\nI applaud Little Star for striking a great balance between fresh tasting ingredients and stick-to-your-ribs satisfaction. The Classic, which has toppings of tasty sausage (I am super picky about my sausage), mushrooms, green bell peppers, and onions. The Vegetarian pizza's toppings (mushrooms, onions, black olives, red bell peppers, garlic, zucchini) were even hearty enough to satisfy this discerning meatlover. I was also impressed with the sauce, a crushed tomato variety with good body and flavor - not too chunky, watery, or sour.  Then there is the clutch of any good deep-dish pizza - the CRUST! Little Star's style is most closely related to Gino's East in Chicago, with a crispy cornmeal crust that makes for a slightly sweet, grainy savory treat after you're done eating the rest of the slice. I appreciate that their crust is not too heavy or doughy because eating the crust is supposed to be part of the experience - not meant to be left on the plate as an afterthought. \n\nSome other Californication observations (I just pictured School House Rock meets Red Hot Chili Peppers): There are a few pizza selections (Mediterranean Chicken, Pesto Chicken) that are not exactly authentically Chicagoan, but it's nice to have different options. You would also be hard pressed in Chicago to find garlic bread made from sourdough which you flavor AT YOUR TABLE with olive oil and freshly roasted garlic (!!!).  This is *AMAZING.* Their caprese and mixed greens salads (cherry tomatoes, red onion, gorgonzola, walnuts, and vinaigrette) are two great ways to start the meal - delicious, fresh, and large enough to share with a few friends. Little Star also features a great array of beers and offers up an eclectic, but contemporary selection on their jukebox. My favorite pizzerias in Chicago have some good pizza, but they really lack all the other things that make for a fun, satisfying dining experience.\n\nAnd that's why Little Star deserves mad props. They successfully execute a Chicago classic, giving it a California twist. They do it WELL and without bastardizing the experience. 5 stars.", "author": "Steph P."}

The staff is very friendly and theres a juke box where you can select songs to be played if you are so inclined.  Theres candles on the tables and its very dimly lit inside, so even though it has a tendency to be very loud, my husband and I enjoy going there on a date night.  It can sometimes be a little bit of a wait, but well worth it!  I love the deep dish veggie pizza, we always get the garlic bread and the spring mix salad.  I like things salty so their food is always a little underseasoned for me, but if you ask for salt they will gladly bring some for you and then the food is just homey, awesome, comforting - great.  If you were to eat it without the salt, the flavors dont really pop to me.  The garlic bread is so interesting, it comes with a whole head of roasted garlic, butter and sourdough.  It is wonderful; if you're really broke, go for that and a coke and you'll be a happy camper.  You can tell all the ingredients are fresh and organic, it tastes like you went outside and picked everything from your garden.  The deep dish pizza is not doughey it has a lot of cornmeal in the crust so it makes it a new interesting take on pizza.  Its an experience for me, not just the same old boring pizza. :) Highly recommended.  Only one con is that I have noticed a little inconsistency here; sometimes out of this world and sometimes just good. :( Still high on my list of favs. Pretty tight inside, so I wouldn't bring a group larger that five.", "author": "Guapa A."}

I can't think of a better location for this place. It's comfortable hip vibe is home to many locals. The familiar background music (all jukebox) , along with the vivid, punchy artwork, set the tone for a light & happy evening with friends.   The lengthy wine, beer and cocktail list aid in creating ample leisure time!\r\n--THE FOOD: I have never met a pizza I didnt like...but I REALLY enjoy the variety of pies available. The option of thick or thin is just the beginning. The trademark \"Little Star\" thick crust pizza, is by far their showboat. The ricotta cheese and fresh chunky sauce blanket the pie. Though the cornmeal crust is a unique delicacy, the flavors atop the pie create a meal on their own.  I'm also quite impressed with the vegetarian, and non red-meat options. The thin crust Chicken Pesto is also a favorite of mine. --DESSERT: It is nearly impossible to not gorge myself when visiting LSP, but on the slim chance that I'm still hungry (or feel like splurging) I take full advantage of LSP's dessert menu. All desserts are made on the premise by a specialized dessert chef. Perhaps the most popular, is the Cheesecake. Words can't describe how light, fluffy & dream-like it is. I also recommend the gelato. Various flavor are available, depending on the availability each night. It, too, is dreamy and parallels the Italian wonder! --OVERALL: Overall, I'm so very impressed with my local pizza joint. LSP is a place where people know youre name (or learn it quickly). It's the perfect Sunday  night dinner with friends, or a place to kick off an evening of bars or music.

When My Big Fat Greek Wedding came out in the theatres, everybody was like, \"ooh la la, you have to see it, big fat blah blah blah.\"  I made a point not to see it.  Then, it came out on DVD, and a friend basically abducted me to make me watch it with her.  That's how important it was to her that I watch this damn movie.  And then we watch the movie and she is looking at me every other minute while laughing maniacally because at this point she's memorized the entire thing and I was like, \"meh.  It's okay.\"\n\nSo I read all the Little Star reviews and I expect this pizza not only to be fantastic, but to do my taxes and tell me I'm a fairy princess, because that is sort of the curse of being talked up and having your reputation precede you.  And the first time I had Little Star I was like, \"meh.  It's okay.\"  But the next morning I thought, I wonder if there's some of that tasty pizza left.  And on subsequent pizza cravings, there was no doubt which neighborhood pizza I wanted, cash only and long wait be damned (helpful hint: ordering over the phone usually cuts down on the wait frustration).  Yes, I've had the real deep dish slim shady in Chicago, and yes, it's not the same.  But that doesn't mean that Little Star's cornmeal deep dish, with its delicious sauce and fresh ingredients (artichokes, holla) isn't, in fact, amazingly good.  Wow, that was a lot of negatives in that sentence.  Little Star is amazingly good, that's what I'm trying to say.\n\nAnd you know what?  I caught My Big Fat Greek Wedding on tv some time after I was forced to watch it, and I actually liked it.  Sure, it was cutesy, but it was also pretty funny.

The Deep Dish tastes a lot like Pizano's in Chicago. A flaky, light but crispy crust with a good helping of cheese and toppings.\n\nI had the special for the night. Meatballs, Pepperoni, Ricotta and Spinach. Well, the special was with Mushrooms instead of Pepperoni but they were more than happy to modify it for us. The pizza took the typical 25 minutes to come out. We arrived right as the opened so there was no wait. By the time we left though there was a line out the door.\n\nThe best part of the pizza was the meatballs. If they've got them the night you go, you owe it to yourself to order them. They are a bit spicy, but not too spicy.\n\nWe ordered a small pizza (9\") for two people. It was the exact right size for the two of us. We didn't order an appetizer.

We got here around 5:50 pm, the wait was 50 mins. So we just went around the corner to Alamo Square. While we were there, we pre-ordered our pizza. Around 5:30, I got a text that our table was ready. The seating was really packed. We were so close to the diners next to us that I literally just turned my head to my right and was able to look over the shoulder of the person at the next table. A little awkward, but that doesn't keep me from wanting to try the deep dish pizza! It took about another 10 mins for our pizza to come out so my friends and I ordered the garlic bread and chicken wing appetizers. I could've done without the garlic bread, but I liked the chicken wings. They were simple and not over sauced. Then our pizza came out and it looked soo good! We ordered a large Little Star and added pepperoni and sausage. Best deep dish pizza I've ever had. There was a good amount of cheese, it was stringy but not too chewy. I like the tomato sauce. The pepperoni and sausage went well with it. The crust was nice and crunchy but not greasy. I had only one slice, a piece of garlic bread, and three chicken wings. That was enough to fill me up. In my group of 6, each of us had one slice. And there were two slices left over, so our pizza was 8 slices. All of my friends agreed that what we ordered filled us up. All of that and we only paid about $10 each, that was including tip. This place is good to come with friends or even on a date. I wouldn't recommend it for people with children who would need to get up and run around because the place is tight. It took us 15 minutes to find parking, but we found free parking a couple blocks away. Our waiter, Patrick, was very attentive and checked on us a couple times.

Boiled wings sprinkled in spices, if you like your chicken well done you will not like this.\nThe pizza was too salty ( as mentioned in another review) If you like that, the pizza sauce is bland with salty toppings.

I was so thirsty after finishing the drink, I had to grab my friend's beer.\nThe eight of us orderred one deep dish and two thin crusts. I liked the thin crust the best, Mediterrean the most of all. Some of my coworkers like the pesto chicken the best but I thought the bird was a bit dry. The deep dish is also good but I prefer Zachary's. \nAfter the pies arrived, the inconsiderate wait staff starting showing their skill. (Big parties beware: this restuarant hates you.) Our waitress kept asking us if she could take our plates away. I had a freaking slice of pizza on my plate and she has the nerve to ask me if I was done. I fended her off but she was able to pick off some of my friends. 2 seconds after throwing my napkin on my plate, she whisked it off while saying \"napkin on plated definitely means you are done.\" WTF?!? I get charged 18% gratuity just so I can feel that I need to leave as soon as possible?!? Sure there were people waiting but we ate $200 bucks worth of food. Let me digest a bit. \nNow, because my friends are pretty cash poor, it took some effort to pay the with Benjamins. That, though, is a different complaint.", "author": "Lams L."}

Every single bite must contain sausage.\n \n3) Eating more than 2 pieces in one sitting results in severe stomach pain that can only be cured by watching 6-8 hours of some sort of sporting event or action movie interrupted by numerous naps and trips to the bathroom where you pray to god the evil cheese will find a way to exit your *ss. \n \n \nAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH  \n \nI am so pissed off right now.

Only one in the Bay that can compare has got to be Zachary on the east bay.  We had the Little Star Vegetarian Pizza with spinach, mushrooms, feta, etc and it was delicious!!!!!! We also had garlic bread with roasted garlic pulps, the boys had root beer in frosted mugs and I had a great pilsner on tap. Wonderfull casual place to come on a Friday night.  It was a nice ambiance as well, candles on the tables, art work, specialty drinks and our waitress was the best. So nice and accomodating.  There were many families with kids when we were there, I personally would not bring little kids to this restaurant, but that is just me I guess. My teenage boys and I will be back, next time perpahs we'll try the classic.  My son who thinks vegetarian is boring loved our vegetarian pizza, it was simply so flavorfull you did not notice the meat was \"missing\".

It was decent, although forgettable.  The pizza, on the other hand, was very good.  Cornmeal crust is not an innovation, nor are occult ingredients like spinach and artichoke, but the pizzas were put together intelligently, and the taste was dead on.  Every time I have a hunger for deep dish I pick up a pie from Little Star.\n\nI originally was going to give Little Star 4/5, but I came to my senses and realized that this was certainly the best Chicago deep dish pizza one would find in San Francisco; furthermore, the restaurant is fun and the service is great.", "author": "John B."}

(with an ALL CAPS people!) - kick ass rocking good pizza! kick ass rocking good Caprese salad (my favorite!). I mean seriously, the ingredients in this joint are so incredibly fresh, it's the freshest I have ever tasted and that is what makes this place superior to even Zachary's over in Bezerkely, which is the only other good Chicago style pizza in the area. And what is most unique about Little Star is their crust, I believe they use corn meal, I've never asked, but that is my guess. All this yummyness (freshest ingredients, corn meal crust) makes this Chicago-style pizza joint EVEN BETTER than Chicago pizza! And to add to all that yummy goodness, they have a killer kick ass alternative jukebox (makes me want to go home, plug in my iPod and rock my tunes even louder!) My only gripe about their beer selection is that they don't have Chimay. Being that I am such a lush when it comes to beer I am going to have to start asking them \"Hey, can you carry some Chimay please?!\"\n\nSo one of my girlfriends told me recently that they opened up another Little Star on Valencia. Honestly I did not believe her. \"Are you sure, it's a Little Star?\" I asked, \"Yes! I'm sure, we ate there the other day, it's right by my house!\" she said. Still, I was in disbelief. So on a sunny weekend afternoon, the old man and I took a stroll in the area to sniff out the inventory on some furniture stores and so I told him that there's a Little Star in our neighborhood, so as we were walking down Valencia to look for it he asked, \"Are you sure?\" even he was in disbelief that our favourite pizza joint could be even closer to home now (we live in the Lower Haight). The man was the one who spotted it first and in the distance I could see the star, it was like if you were walking through the desert, dying of dehydration and you spot an oasis far in the distance, marked by a a few palm trees growing around the perimeter --- that was my joy! I seriously jumped up and down like I was Tom Cruise on Oprah's couch! No kidding!\n\nSo I've yet to make plans to check out the Valencia spot, but I have no doubt in my mind it is just as fabulous as the spot on divis..

I will warn that the wait can be long for a chance to eat at my beloved little star so be prepared. And by prepared, I mean do not go to little star when you are starving to death, about to pass out.

Pizza is just one of those things that is done so many different ways, that one persons favorite method is the next persons death.  I don't know you, you may be my inverted pizza doppleganger.  Do you like Pizza Hut, Chuck E. Cheese, Escape from NY Pizza, Pizzeria Delfina, Patxi's, Orgasmica, etc...  I'm sure if I had the time, and patience I could go on and on about crust styles, cooking styles, toppings, sauces, etc.  but I don't and won't.  Having said that Pizza made with crap is gonna taste crap, and pizza made with quality ingredients, has a chance.  If we cut our pizza teeth together, compared pizza notes together, sat down and philosophized about pizza, if I knew where you were coming from, then I could take your advice.  Hey wait, I could read your other pizza reviews, but I'm just too lazy for that and prefer to rant a little.\n\nAnyway, I digress.  I can't say I'm a fan of Little Star pizza.  The first time I went there, I got one of their deep dishes and one thinny to share.  It was long ago, but the one things I remember was there was no balance to the toppings on the deep dish, i wish i could remember which one it was, but I do remember it coming out too salty, needing something to contrast the salt to bring it all together.  There was something mediocre about the thinny too, but I forget.  The second time I went to LS, whatever.  I had another pizza there tonight and was disappointed once again.  This time just a plain cheese thin one; this is like the blank canvas of pizzas, upon which a great pizza can be built, but also could and should be great in it's plainness.  So, in addition to the crust being burnt (this should NEVER happen), I found the crust too chewy to be enjoyable and wasn't too jazzed about its flavor when I got to the end.  I wasn't crazy about the sauce and even the cheese was not that great, I think too thick for a thin crust, but that's just my opinion, take it or leave it.  So, i don't like their pizza, you do, I think we can still be friends.\n\nI do like the ambiance here, the dark dining room, quite music, I remember the bartenders being friendly, comfy couches to wait the two hours it can take to get a table.

Needless to say, moving to SF has left wanting for authentic Chicago Style Pizza, so I've tried the most talked about places in town. I tried Paxti's and it was OK, a very nice meal-I'd even go back--but a touch underwhelming, especially for the price. Little Star really lived up to the hype. It is true Chicago style in most every way save for the overall size--in SF \"deep dish\" isn't all that deep. The sauce and ingredients were tasty, and I loved the crust, in some ways, even better than the big Chicago places like Lou Malnatti's. There was a bit less crust and it was sweeter and crunchier. So while you definitely get more pizza for the price back home, Little Star is definitely the reigning SF champ, at least so far. \n\nAlas, my true favorite Chicago pizza is stuffed pizza, like they specialize in at Giordano's back home.

Luckily, earlier this month, I finally had a chance.  Their deep dish is brilliant.  I had the pepperoni and cheese, pretty basic, but it's what I like.  I'd say this place beets Zachary's, but for deep dish pizza, Paxti's is my favorite.  Little Star is a very close second though.  It's very nice inside.  I imagine if we needed a table we would've needed to wait because the place was packed.  We ate sitting on the sidewalk in front of the Independent, which went great actually, I really enjoyed it.

So I figured pizza would be a good option. I've actually been in search for some really good pizza spots and this place has stellar reviews on Yelp. \n\nWe originally tried to go to the Valencia location because it is closer to our house but after driving around looking for parking for 15 minutes we decided to try the Divisadero location instead. So, we head over to that location and what do you know....we find a parking sport just around the corner. =) Place is smaller that the Valencia spot but I like the cozy feel to it. Tables are small and not an ideal place for large parties...although there was probably a group of 8-10 people towards the back of the restaurant. There was a slight wait (only 15 minutes) so the host advised us to take a look at the menu and place our order anyway because it would take 30 minutes for them to have it ready. There are a decent number of vegetarian options that all sounded absolutely delicious. We opted for the vegetarian deep dish. It was just me and the hubby that night but we ordered the 12\". By this time we were so hungry that the 9\" seemed too small since that was the only thing we were ordering. After being seated we realized that this place is cash only. Thankfully, there is an ATM right in the front of the restaurant and only charges you an extra $0.25 (not including your bank's fee of course). About 20 minutes later our pizza comes out and it looks sooooo yummy! Definitely a good pizza! Not great but still very good. I think it was the crust that threw me off. I think it would be better if it wasn't so crunchy...maybe like a bit crunchy on the out side but softer or more doughy on the inside? I don't know....it just couldve been better.Warning - a 12\" deep dish pizza is too big for 2 people. I only ate 2 slices and the hubby ate 2 1/2. We ended up taking a lil more than 3 slices home. And when I picked up the to-go box it felt like it weighed 5 lbs.! That's some heavy stuff! Anyway, still a good pizza place and I definitely want to come back to try their thin crust pizzas.", "author": "BrElla4eva H."}

Yesterday my friend and I were driving down Divis and thought...\"why not?\"  I was impressed when we first walked in, it was a hip funky little spot, jukebox music playing, fun art displayed, nice little bar and I started getting excited.  We decided to share a garden salad which was very delicious and ordered the Little Star deep dish.  As it was being delivered to our table my mouth started watering...boy o boy the long wait is finally over!  Was it all the hype!? or have people who rave about this place not ever tried deep dish before?  I was disappointed to discover while the pizza is good, it's nothing out of the ordinary and my friend completely agreed. I'm reminded often by my Sconi boy that San Francisco  just doesn't know how to do pub food, Chicago dogs, and pizza like they do in the Mid West so I'm not accustomed to what true deep dish is like, but I'm hoping it's more memorable than the one I had last night.\r\n\r\nThe service was fantastic though...our waiter was super attentive however our friends who we ran into (table of 5 guys) said the same waiter was a jerk to them.

Contrary to the reviews and the LSP website, the music is nothing special.  There was one Elliott Smith track, but for the most part it was standard top 40 radio: Sting, Radiohead, and R.E.M.

The first time we tried, we wanted to get lunch on a weekend.  We made the trek over to Little Star only to find that it was closed.  Okay.  That sucks.  No lunch, even on weekends?  The second time we tried to go for dinner.  We made it over there, and... oops. They're closed on Mondays.  That also sucks.  Our third attempt was on a Sunday night, and we decided that if it didn't work out, we were giving up.  What's the point of a neighborhood pizza place that requires planning in advance?  And indeed, when we got there, we initially thought it was closed again.  We groaned, noticing the completely black exterior.  But we got closer and--wonder of wonders--it was open!  You wouldn't know it were it not for the lack of the usual iron bars in front of the door.  But it was definitely open, and we were seated immediately.  And overall, we had a great experience, owing entirely to the excellent pizza.\n\nOur service was adequate, but barely.  We were seated for probably six or seven minutes before we got water, which was served in a medium-sized carafe.  That ran out shortly after we got our pizza, and it was never refilled until we were given our bill.  Nevertheless, the server was polite, and anyway, we weren't making any big effort to get his attention, so it didn't hurt our overall experience too badly.\n\nMy biggest complaint was how dark it was inside the restaurant.  We were seated in a nook on the side-front of the restaurant, with walls on two sides and an opaque curtain on the third.  The meager light from our candle really didn't do much.  With pizza that's this good, and this gorgeous, I'd prefer to be able to see my food.\n\nThe pizza was so good that it overcame any of those (relatively minor) complaints.  We had a thin crust pizza, with all sorts of toppings.  Everything was extremely fresh and high-quality, and it reminded me of the homemade pizzas that I often make (usually with less perfect results).\n\nWe went halfsies on the pizza, with my girlfriend getting her faves on her half, and me getting mine.  I had ordered black olives on my half, and it came out without any olives.  I brought this to the server's attention and told him it was still great without them, and he took the olives off the bill.\n\nAnyway, we definitely plan on coming back.

Not your average pizza joint with a waiting list. The staff here are very quick and super friendly. When we got our seat, we ordered their Spicy Chicken Wings. This comes with baby slices of carrots and blue cheese, they don't serve ranch here. The wings were a bit salty, but was very flavorful. We wanted to try out their garlic bread, but they ran out! I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. We had their large deep dish half vegetarian-mushrooms, onions, zucchini, black olives, bell peppers, garlic and half Classic- sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions. Both were very delish! How come I never thought about putting the sauce on the top to keep the bottom nice and crunchy?! The cheese was gooey, toppings were generous and sauce was perfect. If you love non-oily, crispy, flaky, hot, gooey pizza, this is one to try. \nBest time to come is during the weekdays between 5-7, an inside source had said. \nCash only!

Plus, I've been on a deep-dish pizza kick(thanks a lot Leanne, David, Lauren, and Jim!)\nParking: you're stuck with the street. Use mass transit if at all possible. Otherwise, you just have to circle around. I did find spots on a Saturday nite around Turk and Eddy.\nWait: you can't phone in reservations. For a Saturday nite, it actually wasn't too bad. A wait for table (for 3) ran roughly 35 minutes. However, the wait is shorter if you plan on eating around 7. Beyond 8, anywhere up to 45/60 minutes.\nAppetizers: I highly recommend the garlic bread and mixed salad. Bread is very delicious. There's something about butter and roasted bulb of garlic to get the taste buds going. Definitely get appetizers as a deep dish pizza takes 30 minutes to bake.\nThe pizza: Right now, I'm slightly leaning towards deep dish as the best type of pizza around. Great menu with vegetarian, classic, and custom-topping pizzas. We ordered the classic with sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions. A large will feed about 3, so you can do the math for larger or smaller groups. Considering we were very hungry, we got our fill with about 2 slices per person. The fresh tomatoes were the deal maker for me and I loved the crust.\nService and environment: servers were very friendly. Nice couches and chairs in the waiting area. The main competitor for Little Star might be Zachary's. Zachary's is great, but has more of a college feel to it, and sometimes it feels a bit cramped inside. Little Star is better for buds or a group wanting great pizza before an evening in the city. More ambiance and it's easier to have a conversation while listening to the jukebox.\nOverall: I was very pleased with the pizza and service here. More appetizers(including wings) give a slight edge over Zachary's. On the other hand, they don't take plastic so BRING CASH. But, there's an ATM inside for  your convenience. \nA great place to eat before bar-hopping in NOPA or a nite at the Independent. I highly recommend going to the Divisadero location and will go here again or order for takeout.", "author": "Neil N."}

The ingredients taste suspiciously of Costco quality stuff and the service is so abominably bad, I can't even bring myself to give it another shot. \n\nI tried people, I have eaten there 6 times in the past year, and yet each time I am surprised I even went back. The last time was the last straw. First we waited 45 minutes for our pizza, which had been dropped off twenty minutes before at the table next to us. They ate our veggie pie, never once questioning why it had no chicken on it, which was what they had ordered. We got their chicken pie, which now I understand why they wouldn't have noticed if it had no chicken on it. I think I found one, no two pieces of chicken. Hard to tell when you just open up a cheap can of tasteless stewed tomatoes and dump it all over the pizza. The owner finally came over to tell us what had happened, our options were to eat this pizza or wait another 25 minutes for the one we had ordered.  I am a good sport about mix ups and mistakes, so we ate it, but it was not good and it ruined our meal. Plus the wench who served us never apologized for the mistake, even though she was the one who ran the wrong pizza to the wrong table. \n\nToo much attitude for one dark place that makes me feel like if the lights were turned up, I wouldn't want to be eating in there. Also, you know you are in a classy joint when they have security cameras aimed at the host station and the bartenders register.  If you have such a bad stealing problem with your staff that requires security cameras, kindly keep them hidden from customers view, or fire those lousy rats.\n\n I've had it with coffee shop service at restaurant prices. Take it seriously, be nice to your tables, and watch the tips roll in. I waited tables for over 10 years and I get sick of the cooler than you 18 year olds that places like Little Star and Farmer Brown hire to provide service to their customers. I can overlook a lot of things, but after awhile it is the  bad service that will make me never return to a place even if the food is really great.

Little Star also doesn't let you order ahead and then have your pizza when your table is ready.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-02-10", "description": "This is the ultimate pizza in SF. It's everything you want from food; flavorful, textured, and enough to fill you and your friends up. And it's pretty comparably priced to any run-of-the-mill, unspectacular pizza joint. But this is by no means average pizza. The buttery, crisp cornmeal crust adds a texture and flavor that makes this place unique. All of their pizzas are topped with a fresh, extra chunky tomato sauce that really compliments the texture of the crust, and bursts with flavor on its own. Their self-titled signature pizza is a must, and probably one of the best foods around that I could actually share with or recommend for any of my vegetarian friends, one of my favorite foods in general, actually.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, too. I haven't actually done anything but sit at the bar, there, but it's pretty cozy, and a lot nicer than any other pizza place I've been in that offers take-out.\n\nGive it a try. You will not be disappointed. With a large pizza, you and two other friends will be full for just over $20. Their hot wings are good too.\n\nIf you call in an order, they will remind you that they are cash only, but they have an ATM just inside the door that will only charge you TWENTY FIVE (25) CENTS. That's 1/10th of any other ATM I've seen in the neighborhood. I'd give them an extra 6th (little) star for that.", "author": "Cooper B."}

I'd say this place met my expectations, and perhaps with less knowledge about how great everyone thinks it is, there would have been more \"wow\" factor.\n\nCame here for dinner on a Tuesday night when they opened at 5:00 pm.  This was ideal because (1) street parking was relatively abundant and (2) we walked right in!  As we were the second people in the place, we were one of the first orders of the night... and so our pizza came out fresh and without much wait.  The happy hour drink specials are from 5:00 - 6:30 and the wine was very affordable (between $5 to $7 per glass).\n\nService was good... the only caveat (which we actually didn't know) was that this is a cash-only kind of place.  We came up several dollars short.  Oddly enough, I had a roll of quarters in my bag from the bank (think laundry money)... which was the missing $10 we needed!

My friend and I were hunger shakes/faints level starving, so we were in quite a neurotic state when we were forced to circle the block for at least 30 minutes trying to find parking. No luck. Gave up and decided to play ninja and just double park in front of the auto garage next to them. 20 minutes later we had a small thin crust pesto chicken in our hands. Had to play ninja again by parking in front of a fire hydrant so we could eat. I don't know if it was because of the hunger shakes or the adrenaline of playing parking ninja but freaking A that pizza was HEAVEN. We are 2 tiny girls, and we downed that entire 12\" pizza in less than 15 minutes.  The chicken wasn't dry at all which is usually the case with most chicken toppings. Generous pesto sauce and gooey cheese completed its pizza perfection. It was SO worth all the hoopla. But next time I think I'm just going to phone in my order and pick it up lol.", "author": "Jen L."}

I was pretty pissed off.  But the manatee convinced me to eat before yelping so I ate.  The chicken wings are pretty good here.  The pizza is also pretty good.  Definitely better than Zacherys.  Everyone will have their own opinion and preference for the crust however.  Its a corn meal crust that is on the dry side.  But I like it dry (*snicker*).  So I felt it was good. The manatee was indifferent.  We had the littoe star special.  Everything was fresh and meatless (lame).  I am still on the fence as to whether or not I'd come back.  Parking here is the biggest bitch in the world.  So I would most likely pick it up instead of trying to eat there.", "author": "Fatty A."}

Parking is hell, waiting is hell, everything up until you get your table is hell.  Once you have a seat, the service is amazing, even on the most crowded of nights the wait staff always finds a way to single you out.  The fact that it seems every single waiter is unbeliveably attractive also helps.  If your lucky, and you get there early, you might be able to hear the jukebox, which has one of the best selection of music i have seen anywhere.  Unfortunatly the speakers are some of the worst i've seen, and shortly after Little Star opens, it gets to loud to hear the music. \n The garlic bread is fantastic, even though it's just toasted sourdough, butter and a head of roasted garlic.  Simplicity has its advantages.  \nThe pizza is phenomenal, as long as you get the deep dish.  The thin crust is ok, but it doesn't have the same taste and texture.  It's simply not as good.  The sauce is nice and chunky, full of herbs and spices, with hunks of tomatoes floating around, bits of spinach and ricotta meld together into a pizza superbeing.

I'm more the traditional NY-style (thin crust; minimal if any toppings) kinda guy.  But to keep me on top of my game, I venture into the deep(-dish) area and try the hearty stuff.  This particular trip to LSP was my first.  Went with a bunch of work colleagues for one's b-day feast.  So with a pack of 14, it was imperative that we get there early. 6pm to be exact.  The hostess quickly accomodated us although we had to squeeze a bit and the waitstaff was attentive to our big group the entire night (cute too!).  Being the big (that is, appetite-wise) pizza eater that I am, I was a bit curious about the sizing of the pizzas... a \"large\" was ONLY 12 inches wide.  So we ordered a combination of some thin crusts and deep dishes.  On the thin side, the vegetarian and chicken pesto.  On the DD side, the Little Star, Mediterrenean and Classic.  I claimed that I could consume a whole large pie by myself, and so was carefully watched the entire night by some colleagues who doubted my claim.  The pizzas themselves were incredible.  I'm never one to really eat veggie pies... but this one was so deelish.  That cornmeal crust is awesome, but quite filling.  So after eating my first slice, I knew that my \"whole pizza\" claim was going to be tested...\n\nThen I went to the dark side... each slice of the different DD pies was so good, it reminded of my younger, \"better metabolism\" days in college when I was a lot of active and thus could inhale slices and slices of pie.  This night was not the case... after the 4th slice, I was reaching an immediate slow down point.  But the Pesto Chicken thin crusd was calling... \n\nNot to be missed... the Chicken Pesto offers a real clean taste... not-too-overly-done on the pesto, and the chicken wasn't dried out. This was a great slice of pie.\n\nI finished the night having consumed 6 slices (4 DD's, 2 thin) and a pint of pilsner.  Although I was able to walk it off throughout the course of the night.. I knew that I would make my return to LSP many more times in the future, and probably go through the same ritual!!!!", "author": "Dale K."}

Yes the parking is little funky and yes it's kinda a hole in the wall.  But the place is jammin with locals (of which I'm not, I came from the East Bay).\n\nWe had a cool server who refilled our water. The beer comes in bigger than normal pints. I think they are like 20oz.  And we got a great deal on the happy hour or early bird special.  \n\nSo onto the pizza. \nDeep Dish.  This deep dish I can really only compare to Zacharys.  I like Little Stars tomato sauce. It's not as vinegary.  The dough is not as crunchy/crusty as Zachary's but I thought it was good. The amount of stuffing was okay. Not over generous, but not skimpy.  Fair, but I would have preferred more.\n\nWe also got a chicken/pesto thin crust pizza.  This was okay.  It's not super greasy like a  thin new york pizza which I liked, but the downer was that the chicken was extremely dry.  Add that to a drier crust and it was not something you want to come back and order again.  Had I known the crush was more on the dry end, I would have said order a more \"oilier\" topping like sausage or more veggies.\n\nAnyways--- the pizza was decent-- I wouldn't call it my favorite but I wouldn't tell you to avoid this place.  But the atmosphere and the service and personnel were fun so give it a try and try different pizzas. I'm sure if I do, I'll find something I like. \n\nWe also got a salad.

The veggie one with spinach tastes a little bit too much like lasagna. The garlic bread is good if you are going to eat in, but they are pretty stingy with the bread which is annoying. My only consistent complaint is that they routinely mess up my orders. Granted, this ends up getting me free pizzas, so this ultimately I guess I end up benefitting from it.", "author": "Jenica M."}

The hostess was completely attentive to us and made sure to get us as soon as a table opened up. A+ attention right there.  The place is filled with hipsters and non hipsters, but wasn't as tragically hip as I remembered (or expected) it to be. Like Goldilocks, the porridge was just right.  Service was great. We got a dude with tattoos and big gauged ears that was right on the ball. We ordered and our 4 individual 9\" deep dish pizzas came. I did NOT remember the food being this good. The crust... perfect. Not greasy, a little crispy. The only thing that still turns me off a little is the chunks of tomatoes in the sauce.

When my friend told me about this place, I was like, \"Corn meal does not belong in my pizza crust,\" but it turned out better than expected. Being that I'm from New York, and therefore a pizza snob, I can only say that the pizza was good, but didn't exactly meet my ideal. It wasn't bad, just different. Also, because I'm from New York, I have a very particular notion of what makes for a good chicken wing - and that is deep fried wings slathered in a sauce of butter and Frank's Red Hot. The Little Star wings were tasty, but not what I look for in a wing. We sat in the back and it was a lot darker than the pictures suggest. Our table was kind of tipsy, but after a few glasses of Racer 5, so were we, so it didn't matter. Our server was friendly, but not particularly attentive. By around 9:00, the place filled up with people hanging out around the bar and generally being more casual than us, which I think is the way to go at Little Star.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Went again last night. The place seems to be much more popular now. The vegetarian deep dish we had was better than expected but I'm still ambivalent about the wings. \r\n\r\nAnd another thing: Enough with the comparisons to Zachary's. The crusts are completely different, people!", "author": "Brad L."}

It's a good place for hipsters to hang out and have a drink. Have not tried the garlic bread, salads, or cheesecake (which I've heard good things about).

The parking can be tough, but they did put our names down on the waiting list while my brother parked. The garlic bread left much to be desired. It literally was a roasted garlic, a cup of butter and a sliced loaf of bread. I generally expect some preperation to go into food that i'm going to buy at a restaurant, and I also expect it to taste really good. Neither occurred with the garlic bread.\nThe last thing about this place is the noise. It is super loud inside. We were there on a Friday night, so maybe on other nights it would be less noisy, but we were literally yelling to hear each other. \nI highly recommend this place, but I doubt I'll ever stay here and eat again.

We looked the butter-basted flavor.The tomato sauce was nothing like I have tasted before. We thought the cheese on top was a little sparse, but I didn't mind--the tomato sauce was just the best I have ever tasted. With six beers--4 PBR and two Racer 5s--the bill came to $22, minus tip.

During that time, we saw a ton of carry out from this place, and it smelled so good in there, we were dying to try it.\n\nWe ordered a large Thin Crust and Large Deep Dish for 4 people.   At $20+ a pie, it's not cheap, but the pizza is pretty large.  Since we had multiple tastes, the restaurant was nice enough to let us split each pizza and have 2 separate flavors on each pie to accommodate everyone.  \n\nThin crust - the spinach and feta special (can't remember all of the toppings) but it was awesome.  The spinach was perfectly wilted without being too wet, and the flavors really popped your mouth perfectly.  The sauce is perfectly flavored and amazing. \n\nDeep Dish - sausage and mushrooms.  The crust is delicious and amazing.  One thing I didn't like was the sauce is put on top of the pie, and fills in the crust and toppings are underneath.  But there is so much sauce, I couldn't even tell what toppings were on the pizza.  Still, I could've done this as a deep dish cheese pizza and been more than happy with all of it.\n\nHad a black cherry soda which was also a nice little addition to the meal.  \n\nService was awesome and I can see why this place had such a wait.

So tasty and I do not normally like chicken. In addition to the pizza, we started out with a mixed salad. It was a nice mix of greens, gorgonzola and some veggies. We were all ridiculously full even though there were four of us sharing the 2 small pizzas. I noticed a home made cheesecake on the menu and asked the server if it was worth stuffing ourselves to the point of discontent. He said absolutely. We ordered one piece and four forks.

Thick-crust, aka Chicago, pizza lovers are attracted by the deep-dish pies with their crunchy cornmeal crusts. The signature Little Star is stuffed with a mix of spinach, ricotta and feta cheeses, and mushrooms, then topped with a thick, zesty red sauce. The white pie is a bit of a misnomer, considering it combines mozzarella, feta, garlic, and olive oil with colorful zucchini and tomatoes. A selection of cracker-thin crust varieties are available as well. It's not likely you'll have room for the delicious housemade cheesecake, but gelato is known to aid with digestion, at least in Italian families.

The place is just down to earth and chill....it relaxed me like I was in the Himalayan mountains in a secret spring behind the waterfalls having a bubble bath.  The thin crust pizza was very delicious, but the Chicago style pan pizza was insane in the membrane.....it's like having two meals in one.....first you have your pizza of choice (I got the little star...which has spinach and feta cheese on a cornbread crust) and then they put a mote of thick pizza sauce in the middle....very addicting.  I was on a strict diet for two weeks and I put it on pause for that day like I was playing Nintendo WII to use the bathroom and had 4 slices of the Chicago style, 3 slices of the thin crust, 5 spicy wings (which were just alright for me....not spicy at all), and a slice of some tasty homemade cheesecake.....oh snapples was that good!!!

I've eaten here (well, mostly take out) dozens of times--I remember a time when I got pizza here once a week. Both the thin and deep dish pizzas are excellent--spicy, flavorful sauce and crispy, perfectly textured crusts in both cases. I think the deep dish here is a little better than Zachary's, but it's a close call. It's definitely better than the crap I just had in Chicago--totally due to my own bad decision in the place, I'm sure (or so I've been told...now I have to wait til next time damnit!!). But actually perhaps my favorite thing at Little Star (other than the fab jukebox) are the the chicken wings--so. good. This deep affinity could have something to do with my pizza burnout, but really I've always loved the wings....just more so lately. Cheap PBRs (normally like $2 a can I think?) are a plus, too. And the champagne cocktails are served in a huge glass--or at least they were, last time I ate inside. I knocked off a star because I was truly annoyed when this place switched to CASH ONLY! WTF?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-11-13", "description": "I don't want to pose as the World's Greatest Expert on Chicago-style deep dish pizza, but my credentials are pretty good. I'm in my early fifties, so I come from the era when you were either an Uno's family, a Due's family, or a Gino's/Giordano's family. We were Due's fans. Then Uno's sold out to corporate interests, Due's faded, and Lou Malnati opened up his place across the street from my house back in 1971. The Brian Piccolo Foundation fundraisers and the fairly constant stream of Bears and Cubs and Blackhawks (defenseman Eric Nesterenko was another neighbor) spurred the popularity of Malnati's, but it was the pizza that made it a legend. And the family - Lou and Jean and Marc and Rick are just good people. It was nice to be in their place, they made you feel welcome. \n\nSo, like every Chicagoan, I get my jones for some of the Real Thing. I had been to Zachary's and Patxi's, and then I started hearing about Little Star, and reading all the praise here. I went there the other day and ordered the Chicago classic: sausage and onions and bell peppers and mushrooms, and, as is my habit, substituted black olives for mushrooms. \n\nThere's no doubt that this is the genuine article. No prefab Uno's, no \"what the hell is THIS\" Pizz'a Chicago nonsense (and can we please punish the advertising mastermind who came up with that ridiculous spelling of \"pizza\"?) , this is a real Chicago-style deep-dish pizza. And it's a thuddingly average specimen. The crust has little too much cornmeal, it's more oily than buttery and flaky. Mine was perfectly done, but it seems like it would burn pretty easily in another minute, and that it would reheat much too tough. (It did toughen too much when reheated. Notable fail - one of the essential joys of the Real Thing is that it reheats well. I spent one summer hanging with friends, most of whom worked at Malnati's or at Gabby Hartnett's Bowling Alley across Lincoln Avenue. We'd bowl and close the alley, then go across to Lou's. Lou would give whoever was working a break to sit down with us; he'd often join us himself. We'd order whatever we wanted, and when the bill came, it would be for one medium cheese. And when Lou learned that I lived across the street, he'd always make sure I took home the leftovers. \"What, you got somewhere else to go so fast you can't drop this off at home first?\" I had leftover Malnati's for lunch at least twice a week all that summer. Rest in peace, Lou; you were a sweet man!) The cheese was very good and in the right proportion. The onions and bell peppers were UNDERCOOKED. Too much raw veg flavor, too much crunch. Only the crust and perhaps the edges of pepperoni slices are supposed to crunch in the Genuine Article, not the veggies. It's Comfort Food. \n\nThe most important part is the sauce. There's gotta be a lotta sauce. I estimate the proper sauce-to-other ingredients ratio in the Real McCoy to be about six times the ratio in your average delivery thin pizza. It has to be rich and chunky, but it ISN'T just chopped tomatoes. It's a SAUCE - it has to be cooked. The Little Star sauce is so acid, so jarring with uncooked flavor, that I immediately took up knife and fork to probe and see if someone suffering from temporary insanity had put GREEN olives in my pizza instead of black. Whew - not the case. But a HUGE disappointment, after the accolades of Yelpers. \n\nThey serve the Goods here. It will quiet your Jones. And while I'm sure that some of the complaints about service I read here have validity when the crowds are out the door, I showed up at 5 pm and I found the service to be very friendly, although the place is a little dark for my taste. But this deep-dish will not thrill you, it will not make you exclaim \"My God! It's like I never ate pizza before I tasted this!\" it will not excite that instant sense memory that is the essence of food nostalgia. Like Patxi's, it's good. Serviceable. More than acceptable. But it doesn't come within a mile of Zachary's, which could open up in Chicago any day and do a land-office business, even up against Malnati's.", "author": "Randy K."}

Circled the area for 15 minutes with my friend, until we finally realized that maybe I should at least put our names on the waitlist... did that, then circled the area for another 15 minutes looking for a spot. Parked. Went in and waited for another 20-25 minutes. The hostess was very nice, and came over to us to give us updates on our table every so often. We get seated finally - waitress brings over water, we put in our order for garlic bread and their special for the night - Large thin-crust pizza with pancetta, arugula, mozarella and fontina cheese. The bread came out fairly quickly, was OK - it's french bread (very soft, yum) served with a tiny bowl of butter and huge bunch of garlic cloves you spread on yourself. The pizza was good, but reeeally salty cos of the pancetta - so I ended up taking all the pancetta off.. but other than that, was pretty good... didn't like the crust very much, ended up not eating it. The waitress was very attentive and nice.  She even sliced the 3rd slice of pizza in half so we could split it evenly for our take-out boxes, haha.  With my glass of sauvignon blanc and my friend's ginger beer, the bill came out to be around $40 - so $20 per person, not too bad... I'm not sure if I'd come back here anytime soon cos of the long wait, and the pizza didn't blow my mind. Too harsh? Sorry..", "author": "Christine Y."}

Translation: I am in no way a connessieur of pizza. However, I've been known to suffer the consequences now and then (or take some Lactaid pills) to enjoy a nice slice of pie. And I've heard such rave reviews of this place that I just had to put my food allergies aside and check it out. What I really appreciated was that they were more than happy to make my thin crust pesto-chicken pizza with minimal cheese so that I didn't leave the place with massive abdomonal pain and/or nausea = we could go out to bars after dinner. And I really appreciate that. I went to dinner with a couple of friends, and included in the trio is a vegetarian. So needless to say, when searching for dinner venues we're confined to those that accommodate vegetarians and the lactose-intolerant. And here, all three palates were happily fed. The pizza was delicious, the prices more than reasonable, and the service was superb. I'm definitely going back there again!", "author": "Marie M."}

Everybody talks about this pizza and how it may be the best in the city. In my opinion...it depends on if you are a huge fan of corn-meal crust and deep dish pizza. Yes the pizza was good. I ate it all. The crust was amazing....nothing left on the plate, but the pizza had all this crushed tomatoes slopped over the top. I guess that's how deep dish is done. It was good...don't get me wrong. I need to try the rest of the pizzas before I give it my ultimate judgement.  I think Little Star Pizza is one of the best \"Different style\" pizzas in the city.

We told the waitress who graciously offered to make us another pizza. We decided to split it. I wanted something different, but my friend decided she would give the chicken another try. There we were chatting and patiently waiting for another pizza when a guy (who we later found out was the manager) came to our table. \"Why would you order the chicken pizza again if you didn't like it the first time, you are going to get the same thing\" he said somewhat accusingly. We were both really surprised... oh I don't know maybe you won't cook it until its bone dry for the second time. There was no apology from him nothing. It really did feel like we had made the mistake and he came to the table to chastise  us .We left money for the salad and wine and left.

Little Star has top notch thin-crust, eastside style pizza that you've grown to love and miss so dearly. My three friends and I split two large pies, which was more than enough for us all to have our fill for the night, and also take home a few slices to enjoy the next day. My recommendation - The Italian Combo (pepperoni, salami, white onions, black olives, green peppers, and pepperoncini). Savory to the last bite.  For a cocktail, go ahead and order the Hey Koolaid - a light, delicious mix of champagne and cherry soda.    The place is small, so I wouldn't recommend parties over 4 people going there unless you're willing to wait around for 30+ minutes.

The crust on the night I got it was delicious, crisp, buttery, savory. We got the classic deep dish with sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms and cheese. Everything was good except for I felt the sauce on the pizza could have been cooked just a touch longer, it still had that slightly sour uncooked taste to the tomatoes. We also got a thin crust pizza which was okay but the crust was soggy and the onions were undercooked. Others in my party liked it a lot though. I was a little confused by the garlic bread as you have to to sort of put it together yourself, they give you a plate with bread, olive/oil butter spread and a roasted garlic bulb, which is fine except for they didn't roast the garlic long enough so it wasn't spreadable so basically we paid for some bread and butter.

Where have you been all my SF-life?  I didn't have a pizza hang-over like when you eat deep-dish in Chi-town (my privilege for 4 years at Uni), that over-carb-ed, over-cheezed buzzy feeling.  It's deep-dish that has been Californ-ized with that NorCal water in the crust.  We had the Little Star and the thin-crust White Pizza (not that great, by the way).  I also have to say that \"White Pizza\" is called \"white\" according to some folks back in NY because NOT ONLY is the creamy base ricotta (and maybe some garlic) instead of RED sauce (See?  White!), but it also does not contain ANY red items.  A little basil chiffonade, some cracked black pepper I've seen, but not really chopped tomatoes.  That's missing the point, I believe.  Also, white pizza is not license to slap on the cheese- it's kindof a delicate balance.  So, thumbs up on the cornmeal crust, beer selection, champagne cocktails and the NOPA hipster code (i.e. black tees)  that's just shy of pretentious and thumbs down on the \"white\" pizza and the wait.

I also love the fact that the drink selection is cheap and reasonably priced. I HATE restaurants that overcharge for drinks, I go for the food not to pay $3 for a coke or $6 for a beer and Little Star understands that. My only complaints, which are by no means reasons not to go there, are that there could be a little more variety on their \"specialty\" pizzas, I would expect some more unique ingredients and combinations out of a place like this and the second would be that the sauce could use a little work. Maybe it was just the day that I was there but the sauce struck me as a little too tart, perhaps undercooked, and not salty sweet like I like my pizza sauce.

DON\"T GO THERE UNLESS YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME ON YOUR HAND. Small place, limited seating, average service, average pizza, big price, and ridiculously long wait time.  It has a tiny sign which is hardly visible from the street. We drove right past it even though we had a map and the address. We went on a Saturday evening around 5:45pm, and the place was already pretty crowded.  We were seated right away, which turned out to be the only positive about this experience.  And since we knew what we wanted, the waiter had our order immediately.  When we saw a lot of people streaming in to line up at the cashier, we realized they were here for take-out orders, and at one time there were more people standing in line than those sitting down at the tables.  After waiting for about 20 minutes, I started to see a pattern.  Waiters were coming out of the kitchen with stacks of big and small take-out boxes, but most of the eat in customers were kept waiting. As the time went by I started to get impatient and wanted to leave.  Finally after 55 minutes, our two small 9 in. pizzas arrived separately.  But I had totally lost my appetite.  The deep dish mediterranean chicken is average and the thin crust pesto is nothing special.  We each had one slice and decided to leave. I will never go back.Total disappointment!  The food was definitely not worth the 55 min. wait time.  Final words: Don't go there when you are hungry, and prepare to wait an hour for something you can get at any pizzeria.", "author": "Mia C."}

Since we didn't have a menu on hand, we ordered a deep dish pizza with tomatoes and bell peppers.  It was a good pizza, a darn good pizza in fact.  It's hard not to compare this place with Zachary's, since that's pretty much the only other deep dish pizza that we eat.  I won't say that either was any better, they are different.  Little Star's sauce has a cleaner tomato taste with less oregano and other spices.  The crust was good, it stayed crispy, even with all the fixins' on top.  Maybe I ate less, maybe it's less filling, but I felt a little less like stuffed pizza myself after eating the Little Star than I do after eating Zachary's.

But not just any sloppy pizza, well made pizza.  I live near this place and decided that we should check it out.  I am so glad we did!  The wait was pretty long, but we managed to snag seats at the bar.  I do recommend finding a spot at the bar if possible, so you don't have to wait too long.  We ordered garlic bread and we were a little bit disappointed.  It was literally warm bread, a roasted piece of garlic, and a side of melted butter.  I was not expecting that!  They should of just brought me dough to make the bread too!  Sure it was interesting and different, but they should of mentioned that on the menu.  Anyways, the pizza was AMAZING!  I had the white pie and my friend had a deep dish.  We both were in pizza heaven.  Both pies were flavorful and satisfying.  The true test came when we brought it home and had it the next day.  Left over pizza can sometimes fail, but this did not!", "author": "Dominique T."}

I better write this review before I change my mind. Little Star Pizza is the best pizzeria in San Francisco, hands down. That does not, however, mean that they have great pizza. The four stars that I have awarded this establishment are for attitude and effort, not achievement. Little Star makes two types of pizza: a Chicago-inspired deep dish and a more standard thin crust. Unfortunately, both of these pizzas arrive with more than a tinge of California. Just look at the menu of pizza specials and toppings... feta? artichoke hearts? Please. Being a Chicagoan, of the two pizza styles, I prefer the deep dish. Chicago-style deep dish pizza should be hefty and artery-clogging. Little Star's version seems to be inspired by the top-notch pizza at Chicago's Gino's East, which has a cornmeal crust and, if you order right, an enormous thick Italian sausage patty. Little Star's got the cornmeal crust, but here it's a little more rustic... sort of polenta-y, almost. And it's particularly crumbly when cold, which sucks. The tomato sauce is good, with a nice herb flavor. But the toppings and cheese seem to get lost underneath the sauce. I prefer a thick well-done crust of cheese on top, a la Chicago's Carmen's Pizzeria. Vis a vis the thin crust pizza, it's passable. Who cares about thin crust when deep dish is on the menu? Recently, I enjoyed a Pompagne... a generous champagne cocktail with pomegranate juice. Yummy and drunk-making. Final gripe: why no delivery? What is it with you people?", "author": "Jon L."}

But there is nothing typical about Little Star---it's in a league all its own.  The dim candle lit, retro-hip ambiance was the last thing I expected in a pizza joint.  It ain't no Fat Slice, that's for sure.  I dare say, Little Star is even romantic, but totally unpretentious and friendly.  We arrived at primetime on a Saturday night and waited 15 minutes at the bar.  They have a great beer and wine selection, and super creative champagne cocktails (much better than Soju, if you know what I mean).  During our wait, we bonded with one of Star's regulars who insisted \"Deep dish is the only way to go.\"  We took his recommendation and ordered a small \"Little Star\" pizza, add chicken. Deep dish rocks---crispy, hearty crust and fresh scrumptious toppings. We also shared chicken wings which were uniquely good---subtle simple flavor, but no buffalo sauce (if that's what you're looking for).  We had plenty of food with two slices to spare.  Did I mention the jukebox?  Now that should win an award!  It's curator did an excellent job of representing the best of all genres...Manu Chao, Modest Mouse, Tribe Called Quest, Stevie Wonder, Madonna, and many more.  Bring some singles and expect to hear your songs almost immediately.  I was not excited about going out for pizza, but Little Star proved it is a Star!  Expect to throw down more scrilla than you normally would for pizza though (3 beers + chicken wings + small za + tip=$50). I will be back to jam the juke and taste the buttery thin crust so many other yelpers are raving about.", "author": "Regan P."}

We were in the mood for some thick ass deep dish pizza so, naturally, we left our decision up to the yelpers, and, obv, we were not disappointed. On the outside- this place kind of looks like a hole, but step inside and you'll find a sweet little place that looks like IKEA has decided to design restaurants. We couldn't get a table right away so we got a drink at the bar. The bartender gave us his attention immediately and we exchanged friendly and humorous banter while we waited. After we sat down at our table the waitress came and took our order. She was super nice and gave us her recommendations. A friendly staff is so key for me and I was glad to see that they weren't another pretentious restaurant with employees that think they're too cool for school. We ordered a salad and the Little Star deep dish (such a clutch decision- thanks waitress!). They say it takes around 30 minutes to cook the pizza but it sure didn't seem like it. Once it got to our table, talking ceased and the grubbing began. The pizza was cooked perfectly and we were incredibly satisfied when we were finished. I've never been to Chicago but something tells me that when I go to eat pizza there, I'll have something to compare it against. Thanks, Little Star!", "author": "Marjorie P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-15", "description": "We ordered two pizzas. The first, was a 16\" medium crust cheese and pesto. The crusty, traditional flour crust gave a good solid, almost crunchy contrast to a hot, wet, topping of melted mozzarella and fresh pesto. It was a perfect combination. Our second pizza was a 14\" vegetarian deep dish pizza with olives, mozzarella, tomatoes, zucchini, bell peppers and oregano. It usually comes with mushrooms, but we opted not to have them. This being said, I now believe the mushrooms would have been a fine addition. Even without the mushrooms, the pizza was fantastic. The crust was more of a corn meal mix with a gritty, well browned outside to it that give it a unique opposing texture in the mouth. The bed of the crust was lined with mozzarella, then the vegetables were in the middle, with a bed of tomatoes resting on top. Outstanding. The combinations are well thought out, balanced and tasty. The lighting was low, and the restaurant was large enough to feel like there was enough personal space, but cozy enough to feel warm amongst fellow pizza aficionados who also happened to be in the know as to where some of the best pizza is in San Fransisco is.", "author": "Dave S."}

Fresh quality ingredients go into making their savory pizzas, they really ROCK the deep dish! I haven't tried any other dishes here because I can't get enough of their deep dish. They  give you warm sour dough bread, butter and a whole roasted garlic for starters.

The salad was large and a decent way to tide us over while our Chicago Style pizza took 30 minutes to cook. We ordered the Little Star Pizza and unfortunately, it wasn't that hot when it came out to us. We asked them to reheat it but learned that because they use a conveyer belt, reheating it would totally burn the cheese. They gave us that as an option, but we opted to keep our lukewarm pizza. It was decent, but not worth all the hype. I did love the cornmeal crust and the cheese was really good but the sauce was too sweet and it certainly wasn't worth a 30 minute wait.
