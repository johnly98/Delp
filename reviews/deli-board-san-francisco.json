It was a Saturday at lunchtime, and Deli Board was surprisingly busy which seemed like a good sign. I walked in and examined the menu. It certainly had plenty of options but it also seemed to be an accumulation of everything that I don't like. Certainly, this is partially because of my dietary restrictions (no beef, no pork) and pickiness, but I don't think I've ever struggled picking out a sandwich at any other restaurant before. \n\nGiven my restrictions, I had 2 possible sandwiches to pick from: one turkey (all other turkeys have pork, too) and one vegetarian. The turkey one had swiss cheese, pepperoncini blend, cole slaw, Board sauce (AKA ranch), and mayo, which are all things I would never choose on a sandwich (except maybe the swiss but there are better cheeses). I was really feeling meat, so I decided to make my own sandwich. I chose turkey on dutch crunch with cheddar and lettuce (why are there no tomatoes on the menu? or regular onions?), and I paid almost $20 for it with tax - quite expensive for a sandwich. \n\nI walked home and opened up my sandwich to find that they had put jalapenos on it, and there was no cheddar to be seen, so I was quite disappointed. I didn't have enough time to go back, so I picked out the jalapenos and ate it. The sandwich itself was very large - the turkey was almost an inch thick the whole length. I had noticed double meat was an extra $10 and I can see why. I kind of wish they halved the amount of meat and lowered the cost of the sandwich by $5. \n\nI realized that I'm the minority in sandwich preferences, but my order was so simple and it still came out wrong. If I go back, I'll try a salad instead.", "author": "Kristin A."}

I'd list some of them here but Yelp frowns upon this , as they sometimes consider this promotional.\n\nI've tried more than a few (sandwich places) and why did I give this place a 3 star rating ?  It's not the price which I know a lot of people take issue with but it's simply because the taste wasn't enough for me to crave another one when there are other viable options.  Yelp shows \"I'm a fan\" when you hover over the four star rating and I just didn't think this place was deserving of 4 stars for me let alone 5. \n\nThe Leroy Brown however surprisingly was my favorite of the 3 sandwiches I've tasted to this point. I'm not a pastrami fan but as others have pointed out the quality of meat here seems to be above average. I like how the balance of the meat and the \"others\" (stuff in the sandwich) is just right in the Leroy Brown.  \n\nThe service was friendly and the sandwiches came out relatively quick as well. \n\nI tried the (in order of what I liked the most) :\nLeroy Brown-$17-  romanian pastrami, turkey, koshe salami yellow american cheese, muenster cheese, pepporcini blend, pickles, board sauce on dutch crunch\n\nTina- $16- turkey avocado, muenster & chedder cheese, cherry peppers , cole slaw , board sauce, brown mustard, garlic french roll\n\nZeke - $16-  turkey , avocado , bacon ,cream cheese, pickled onion, sprouts , mayo , french roll", "author": "Rod M."}

However, I expected it to move and it did, but slowly.  After placing my order I went back outside to wait for my name to be called.  \n\nAt first glance I didn't like any of their sandwiches as almost all contained pastrami (I have NOTHING against pastrami but don't like it combined with other meats) and I didn't want a basic sandwich either as I knew that would not be a good test of how good the establishment could be.  I decided on the 555, which consisted of pastrami, turkey, cheddar and american cheese, pepperoncini, coleslaw, pickles and Board sauce on a garlic dutch crunch roll.  The sandwich is heated, which allowed the cheese to be oozy and stringy when the two halves were pulled apart.  The flavors of the sandwich produced a wonderful taste and taste sensation with each bite but the flavors became a bit muddled over time.  Overall, this was a pretty good sandwich.\n\nYes, the sandwiches are a bit on the pricey side but I assume that is because they are making so many of the sandwich components themselves.

First off, the meat portion; the meat portion wasn't too little, but it wasn't a lot either. Before receiving the sandwich, I was worried about there being too much turkey meat and thus creating too dry of a texture; however, this was not the case, so all was good. Probably the first thing you notice when you pull apart the sandwich would be the cheese, as it stretches and pulls apart into the respective sandwich halves. This would only be possible because of how warm they toast their sandwiches, which was something I really appreciated on a cold day like today. The Dutch crunch provided a really nice crunchy texture that housed all of the middle layer ingredients, though I didn't really taste much garlic.\n\nI honestly don't know what the Board sauce tasted like because I ate it all too quickly (I must have been pretty hungry), but I remember overall being very satisfied with the flavor profile of the sandwich.

Everything from the meat, bread, cheese, and vegetables taste of luxury. You would think with such great tasting ingredients the portions would be small, but, Deli Board packs a mountain of food in-between two slices of bread. I would even say half of the sandwich would be enough for lunch. \n\nIf you plan on arriving around lunch time, be aware that Deli Board's line is consistently out the door. Don't be surprised waiting in line 10-20 minutes before placing your order. Upon arriving, the most noticeable thing will be, the ever changing menu hanging on the wall. The menu is extensive, however, the wait in line will give you plenty of time to read it over. \n\nThe space is small and sparse. There's not much seating inside and there's only a couple tables right outside on the sidewalk. If you plan on eating in, be prepared to wait again for seats to open up. I can't wait for Deli Board to move to a larger space and revamp their interior to be equal to the quality of their sandwiches.", "author": "Julian L."}

While it was a good sandwich, I can't even say it was a GREAT sandwich. I got this specifically because I wanted the cherry peppers, and that flavor didn't really come through. I also think it's says a lot when myself and another in our party kept going back to the hot sauce. I don't need hot sauce on everything, but it's one of those things where I slap it onto something okay just to amp up my palate a bit.\n\nPerhaps I'd have a different opinion if this sandwich cost $14, $12 instead of $17. That is absolutely ridiculous for one sandwich, and it's not humongous either - sure, enough for a meal for your average male, but as a small female I could totally eat one (and be very full). The pickles - though large and juicy - were also just mediocre, not particularly crunchy and a little on the mushy end.\n\nI'm not sure why this place gets all the hype. I think some people respond to a high price point and shift their perception of the meal more favorably. I'll admit I fall in the opposite camp.

For those of you who haven't experienced a Deli Board sandwich, it's time to make the trek.

I opted to build my own sandwich and boy did I nail it. Disclaimer: any sandwich you build here will be delicious. Anyway, my sandwich consisted of turkey, all the veggies, cheddar and the house made bomb balsamic dressing. The result, a massively delicious sandwich that hit the spot! Everything about the quality of ingredients is top notch and it shows. \n\nThat being said, it's expensive. How expensive you ask? Well, just shy of $20 bucks for the sandwich.

I'm from out of town, so usually I trust the judgement of the locals. Lots of times it bites me because they aren't foodies. Luckily, this time it didn't, as they suggested Deli Board.

This description is 100% accurate.\n\nWalking up at around 12:45 pm, there was a fairly short line (read: it didn't extend outside the door). We were not only able to order, but we were also able to snag a 4 person table! Apparently, for one of my co-workers, it was the first time in his 2 years visiting this location that he was able to sit inside. What can I say, I'm a good luck charm :)\n\nFor food, I got the Carzle based off recommendation. It was. So. Good. The brisket was perfectly tender and just melted in my mouth (I never thought I'd describe meat this way, but I am). Would recommend, although I'm sure all the other options are just as delicious as well. To drink, I got a bottled water, which was free as they don't offer tap.\n\nRight after we sat down, the line got super long and extended past the entrance.

Deli Board's pastrami is nothing like that.  It's flavorful without being overly seasoned, relatively lean, and easy to eat - where has this pastrami been all my life?  The balance of the sando includes jalapenos (don't worry, they're not that spicy), cheddar cheese, and coleslaw.

I feel like for an appetizer, it should be cut into smaller pieces (before being wrapped in egg roll wrapper) to promote sharing.\n\nBradley: Got this one because it had the trifecta of corned beef, brisket and pastrami.  The meat is shaved super thin, like a good cheesesteak.  Though I enjoyed the texture, the 3 distinct meat types kind of merged together because of their thinness.  Probably better just to enjoy them individually.  Loved the soft and chewy roll, however it didn't taste particularly garlicky for being garlic bread (nor was it that crunchy on the garlic butter side).\n\nPickles: Two big chunks of pickle.  Sour, but not too sour.  Was decent.", "author": "Adam B."}

These sandwiches are loaded with meat and it's hard to choose a sandwich from their menu because their all so damn loaded and sounds delicious. I had the Boca:brisket, romanian pastrami, corned beef, muenster cheese, pickles, Board sauce, brown mustard, french roll purely because it's the first item on the list and my rule is the first item means the store's signature! \n\nAnyway the sandwich is delicious of course for $16 + tax, I mean it pretty much has to be to justify the price.

The Ruby Claire: pastrami, thinly sliced to be fluffy that fell apart easily. Good flavor on its own. Corned beef, pretty much the same idea. All really good meat. A classic Reuben-ish sandwich with the sauerkraut giving it that extra kick. Bread nice and making this one of the easiest sandwiches to actually eat. I do wish it had more thousand island dressing, but can't complain too much.\n\nI honestly preferred the Carzle. Brisket and pastrami has the same meat deal. Thinly sliced and delicious. I love me some provolone on a sandwich and their board sauce added well to these flavors. Despite this, it was the cherry peppers that really made this sandwich for me. A bit of spiciness with the pickled flavor really went a long way into elevating this sandwich, which makes me think that I should've gotten the KUIP.

This sandwich place is OK. If delivering a warm sandwich, as promised, makes this a 5-star place, then standards must be low. \n\nThe place itself is nice and very hipster. The service is polite, expedient, and friendly (despite a long line). The hours are a little weird, making this really a lunch place more so than anything else. \n\nNow onto the food. The sandwich is indeed good, and the portion size of the sandwich delivers. The Turkey sandwich (The Fey) was tasty, meaty, and will make a person full. The meat itself was good, but did not have any particular flavor notes, taste or texture, that would otherwise indicate that this is more than just an average turkey sandwich. The veggie sandwich was also good, but didn't quite hit the spot. \n\nThe place is very meat-focused, and offers a lot of beef options (for those who don't eat beef, you aren't left with a ton of pre-designed items). That said, you can always make your own custom sandwich.\n\nWe spent about $16/sandwich (and the veggie one is $14!!!) these prices are absurd, even for SF. In fact, my friend who ordered the veggie sandwich said she felt like she had to split the sandwich into 4 portions, to eat throughout the day, so that she could justify the $14 spend on veggies.\n\nGiven the price, I'd expect complete and utter satisfaction between two pieces of bread. Sadly, the sandwich was just average. Nothing special, and I've had better (and cheaper) sandwiches elsewhere. Hell, even Ike's (a to-go sandwich place) gives you a better price to taste ratio (in my opinion). People may say \"the taste of the sandwich is different than the price\", and they may be right. However, a Yelp-rating, to me, is far more comprehensive. \n\nIf people are in this part of town, looking for something good to eat, that is filling and won't bust your wallet. I highly recommend Frena/Taboon a block-ish up from Deli Board. \n\nOverall, I'd say this is a good once and done type sandwich place.

The sandwich also had coleslaw on it. I've gotten sandwiches with coleslaw before, where it just didn't go right, but you can tell this coleslaw was made to perfectly pair in the sandwich. You can tell a lot of care goes into this food. If you've never been here before, you need to go. Your life is incomplete.", "author": "Michael K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-28", "description": "Goodness me - what a sandwich. I'll come straight out with it: my experience at Deli Board brought about what is without a doubt the second best sandwich I've ever had (if you're curious, it's behind only the Porchetta sandwich at Italia Deli and Bakery in Agoura Hills, California: http://www.yelp.com/biz/italia-deli-and-bakery-agoura-hills), and if the price point were just a smidgen lower this would be one of the easier five-star reviews I've ever written. Come here. Now. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nI've only been to San Francisco maybe four or five times over the past couple of years, so you might chuckle when I say that I was initially a bit concerned walking through a rougher part of town on my way to the gentrified oasis that houses Deli Board. Surrounding area aside, the service and atmosphere at Deli Board are both excellent, and while each sandwich is indeed a masterpiece, they come out quickly. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nAs I touched on, my experience at Deli Board was sensational, and the one and only drawback was the price. Have a look at the picture of my 'Mina' sandwich at the bottom of this review. Looks delicious yeah? It was, as you'll read, and it was pretty big, but the price tag prior to tax/tip was fifteen bones. $15? That's like, two guac-less Chipotle burritos just about. I don't think I've ever had a sandwich that expensive, and while this was a decent amount of food and some seriously fresh and flavorful ingredients, I simply can't dish out the value star here. $12? Even $13? Now we're talking, but half way to $20? I can't do it even though there are some cheaper sandwiches on the menu. No Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nAgain, this was absolutely brilliant. Fresh pastrami that was flavorful without being too fatty, lettuce, peppers, cheese, sauces, and some of the freshest bread in town. Above all else, while I can't say how they do it, the sandwiches at Deli Board are either toasted or packaged in a way that melds all of the ingredients together into a single cohesive dish as opposed to the piecework stuff you find elsewhere that ends up being nothing even resembling a sum of it's parts. The sandwiches at Deli Board are something special, and you won't go wrong regardless of what you order. Dual Stars Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nWithout a doubt I could eat this every single day of my life if my organs (and wallet) would allow it. Wonderful. Star Granted.", "author": "Paul V."}

I almost prefer the meat chopped up like this vs. the old-school NY-style meats in chunks/slices.\n\nThe Hermine consists of pastrami, corned beef, and beef brisket, and is sort of a replacement for The Boca which many Yelpers talk about.  It's all chopped up so I can't really tell the difference between the meats as I'm eating it.  All I know is that I love it.  This thing costs $15 and comes with a side of pickles which is one pickle with the ends chopped off.  It tastes strong on its own but I barely notice the one in the sandwich.\n\nIf you're looking at the specials online, know that there are more options when you get there including some for vegetarians (mostly containing falafels) and nothing really for vegans unless you abstain from the mayo-based board sauce.", "author": "Shannon L."}

It lived up to its reputation. The carzle has both brisket and pastrami (along with cheese and other toppings) on a garlic french roll. The brisket and pastrami were both sliced so thin, and the entire sandwich was really flavorful with their special sauce. I especially approve of the choice of garlic french roll - the bread is soft and just slightly garlicky. Their sandwiches have a great stuffing to bread ratio (aka LOTS of stuffing but still holds together and fits in your mouth) but are not quite as huge as a sub. \n\nThey have limited seating, so I would definitely suggest taking your sandwiches to go and eating somewhere else. The only annoying thing is that, for some reason, they won't take orders of 6 or more sandwiches during lunchtime. The cashier was really rude to us when we tried to place an order of 6... so... we split our order into two orders of 3 and paid separately.

This place has been in my bookmark section for about a year now, and I finally got the chance to try it. They close at 3 on most days so it is ideal for lunch. \n\nGot to try the Carzle and Hermine, and they are hot sandwiches! The meat here is very soft. There was nothing I particularly love about this sandwich, and to be honest, it didn't leave an impression on me. It was neither good or bad, and it is definitely missing a wow factor to it.  \n\nHowever just like everyone else, I was taken back by how small the sandwiches actually are. I was thinking they might be at least a little bit bigger than the actual size of it. I am also disappointed by the price. You are paying more than what you are getting. $16 for an 8 inch sandwich that just tastes mediocre. I do love the pickles that come with the sandwich.

All of the flavors together were amazing. The garlic french bread wasn't too garlicky if you're concerned about garlic breath afterwards.\n-Fay: turkey, avocado, swis cheese, cherry peppers, on a garlic dutch crunch roll. I ordered this one because I love turkey + avocado. This one was also yummy but not as amazing. Maybe because the turkey was not as tasty as the pastrami? Or maybe because I was already getting stuffed from the Caralze. \n\nPROS:\n-PICKLES!!! fat, thick, juicy pieces of pickles to compliment the sandwiches. Also  chips. \n\nCONS:\n-Gets kinda crowded around lunch + limited seating\n\nAhh such a good place for lunch. I was stuffed afterwards and I had about 1/4 of my Fay sandwich left.

Deli Board is a small hole in the wall, fast paced shop with a tiny kitchen that dishes out soups, salads, sauces and most importantly: hand crafted, loaded, mouthwatering looking sandwiches! Their menu is jam packed with tons of pre made selections of sandwiches that come loaded with various meats: briskets, pastrami, corned beef, roast beef, salami...etc as well as a plethora of toppings to go along on their freshly baked breads. It's also bit overwhelming to decide what you want to order with all these options and if that is the case, you can always customize one too!\n\nSo I ordered the $$$ sandwich (pronounced as the \"money\" sandwich) which came with brisket, corned beef, kosher salami, muenster cheese, cheddar cheese, cherry peppers, cole slaw, board sauce, all inside their french roll. It was the first item on their menu and I heard good things about it. When my order came out, it looked massive, eye appealing, and my mouth was ready to tackle every bite of it. The sandwich was filling and hit the spot but something about just seemed missing, there was not \"it\" factor to it to distinguish it from other sandwiches I've had in my life. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but for $15 dollars (the standard price for most sandwiches there) I guess I expected just a little more. I left feeling full but unfulfilled after the hype I had in my mind. \n\nNonetheless Deli Board seemed like a great spot the locals frequented and I'd be happy to come back and try some other menu items!", "author": "JP G."}

When I am craving a sandwich there is no place that satisfies that urge more than Deli Board up on Folsom. In my opinion these are the best sandwiches I've had or know about. \n\nThe menu seems to change periodically but the ideas and ingredients are generally the same. Everything here is high quality, especially the meats that they include. On the subject of meats, they absolutely stuff an unbelievable amount of meat into each sandwich. I very much like the breads here as well and I generally try to substitute in the garlic dutch crunch which comes out nicely toasted. Lastly, the sauces are all good but the board sauce is so delicious that I always get an extra side to dip my sandwich in.\n\nOverall, while the prices are on the higher side (~$14) it is definitely worth it as these are the best sandwiches around.

It's got the real crunch without the palate cutting. And since its freshly toasted, it comes out nice and warm. \n\nTheir combinations are delicious with thinly sliced meats. Everything from toppings, meats, cheese and sauces were perfectly proportioned so that not one component was overwhelming. We got the boca and the $$$. I liked the boca more but the bf preferred the $$$. I did expect more of a wow factor from all the great reviews. But that Dutch crunch bread left a lasting impression which is why I'm giving it a solid 4 stars instead of 3/3.5. \n\nThe downside is that prices are expensive. $12-15 for a sandwich the size of earls in LV. I expected a larger sandwich for that amount I paid. It's definitely not as large as an Ike's or little Luccas sandwich but tastewise I think deli board beats them. They also beat Ike's and little Luccas on meat quality and bread quality.\n\nThey're homemade pickles are delish too.\n\nThey accept card and cash.\n\nThey also cater.

After waiting and getting my sandwich, I was immediately enlightened with my eyes opened to the chicken salad/salami combo.  That plus the bread and the condiments, wow!!!  The chicken salad itself wasn't a mayo-based creamy mess, it was actually more chicken which was a great change of pace.\n\nYes the sandwich was $15 but a big sandwich that can at least two meals for any person who is not crazy to eat the whole sandwich in one meal.

I walked in and was immediately accosted by Guns N' Roses blasting from the record player behind the counter.  Don't get me wrong.  I love old school Guns N' Roses, but it was too loud.  I perused the menu desperately trying to concentrate over the vocals of Axl Rose and decided on a salad.  \"Ok,\" I thought, \"This is cool.  The salad is expensive, the music is too loud, but I'll have a glass of wine or a beer and chill.\"  I was informed by the friendly cashier that they don't serve wine, but that I could go down the street (a block away per her instruction) and get wine.  I was confused.  First of all, was she suggesting I vacate the premises and find another place to eat?  Was she suggesting that I make my purchase, tote my little salad over to the wine oasis a block away and sit on the corner, bottle of wine in one hand, salad fork in the other?  Or perhaps, turn around, walk to wine shack in the nether regions of Folsom, then mosey on back to super expensive sandwich shop with booze in hand from a different locale?  I pondered for a second and said, \"I'll just have water, thanks.\"  As I sat waiting for my uber expensive salad sans wine or beer, I heard my name bellowed, \"Niki!  Niki!\"  I waved to the person holding my salad and smiled politely and said thank you.  No smile back.  No, you're welcome.  No, enjoy.  Nothing.  Just a deadpan glare.  I wasn't looking for a friend, just a level of courteous societal niceties for a brief second in time.  Anyway, I digress, I looked down at my salad expecting to find it displayed on fine china with stainless steel Oneida flatware and a crisp, linen napkin.  Instead my salad was served in a clear, plastic box, with a single, rough, brown paper napkin and a plastic fork.  I opened the plastic salad box top and began eating.  It was good, but tasted like a salad from a plastic box.  It was clearly not fresh, but tasted as if had been in the plastic for a while atop other lonely shelved salads in the dark recesses of their industrial sized refrigerator.  We were now onto Mr. Brownstone bellowing from the archaic music chambers of the sandwich counter.  I rubbed my head detecting an inevitable headache approaching.  Halfway through my salad I asked wannabe hipster sandwich guy if they served bread with their salads and he said, \"Well, we caaaaan, but it's gonna to take a few minutes.\"  Damn.  Well that sure sounds like it's going to be super inconvenient for you.  \"That's ok.\" I said.  Seconds later, \"Are you sure?\"  Me, \"Yes, I'm good thanks.\"  Sandwich guy, \"I've got pita bread right here...you want that?\" Me, \"No.  Thanks.\"  Him, \"Are you sure?\"  Ok, at this point I'm thinking, what the fuck.  Do I not look sure?  What is it about me that is forcing you to continue asking me if I'm sure.  And then it continued, \"It's really good pita bread.  It's from the bakery down the street.\"  Me, clearly annoyed, \"I'm fine.\"  Him, \"Are you sure because I'm just going to throw it away.\"  Well damn!  Give it here then!  Let me shove that pita bread into my face so as not to waste it!  Listen folks, I'm a native San Franciscan and a grown woman and this is what I'm sure of:  don't deter your guests by telling them to go down the street to buy wine, don't blast the music so loud that people can't have a conversation at noon and/or blast away, but offer wine and beer so people can tolerate your establishment and when a guest asks for bread the correct response is, \"Yes, I'll be right back.\"  Not, you can have the shitty pita bread I was about to throw away.  For the price of that salad, I'd rather go where I can have a glass of bubbly and gracious service.", "author": "Niki Y."}

We waited in line for about three minutes to place an order at the counter, then grabbed the last 2-top in the small dining space, about 8-10 tables inside and two tables outside. Food was delivered to our table in less than 10 minutes. And, bottled water was free since we ate in the restaurant as opposed to taking sandwiches to go. The corned beef, pastrami, ham, and brisket were tender and flavorful and there were lots of cheese and other sandwich toppings from which you could choose. And the accompanying pickles (served in zip lock bags) were terrific like they were pulled out of an old fashioned pickle barrel.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-14", "description": "The variety of sandwiches in the San Francisco food scene is amazing for a sandwich lover like me, from the overflowing Ike's sandwich to the touted Roli Roti porchetta. Deli Board is the hidden gem of sandwich spots, deep down in Soma where only those in-the-know frequent for one of the best sandwiches in the city. It's an Ike's-style sandwich, on the heavier side with meat, sauce, and cheese, but somehow it's lighter on the palate, with a better formed sandwich that doesn't leave you feeling weighed down. Their Dutch Crunch is honestly the best that I've had, sourced from The Rye Project just around the corner. Although on the expensive side, their sandwiches boast a hefty amount of meat, to the extent that I end up taking half out. My favorite sandwich is the Fay, made with roasted turkey, your choice of cheese, Board sauce, and avocado. It's packed tightly so your fillings aren't oozing out the side, but you get some of each ingredient in every bite. The garlic Dutch Crunch has the perfect crunch and zing of garlic that brings the whole sandwich together. The size is much more manageable than the behemoths from Ike's and nothing is too sweet or too salty. Deli Board is my go-to for an indulgent sandwich that keeps the tummy happy throughout the day!", "author": "Ashley T."}

Other top contenders are Ike's and The Sentinel, but I feel like the Deli Board has a lot of combos and they don't skimp out on the meat and the fillings. About 50% of the people get their sandwiches to go, so it seems like you can find a seat to eat there if you'd like. I went once at 12 pm and another time at 12:30 and found a table both times. I like their wood decor and it is clean, which is always a good thing.\n\nThe first time I went, I got the Mezman, which has pastrami, deviled egg salad, muenster cheese, jalapenos, pickles, and board sauce. I think it came on garlic dutch crunch. I loved the bread, it was soft, fluffy, and so delicious. I loved the deviled egg salad and the way the cheese was melted into the meat. I did find that the pastrami was too salty for my taste and I could only eat half the sandwich before I wrapped up the other half to take home.  I guess pastrami is not really for me. In small doses, yes, but the sandwich just had too much for my liking (I know, most people complain that sandwich shops skimp out on the meat)\n\nI decided to give this another shot, because I think I just ordered something that wasn't right for me before. I got the Zeke which was completely up my alley and delicious. It had lots of turkey, bacon, cream cheese, pickled onions, sprouts, and mayo. I wasn't too much of a fan of the cream cheese, but I'll get it next time without. The whole thing was delicious and I ate the whole entire thing. \n\nThe sandwiches are a bit on the pricey side, around $10 - 11, but they are worth it - the portions are big, the quality of the ingredients is great and very fresh, and they don't skimp out on any of the fillings. If you take half of it home, it reheats pretty well in the toaster oven. Remember to try the mustard they have, it's spicy and a little bit sweet and complements the sandwiches really well. \n\nIt's fairly close to the courthouse, so if you're there for jury duty, make sure you come here for lunch - it will be the highlight of your day and the only saving grace to having to go to jury duty!", "author": "Christina L."}

To their credit, the Dutch crunch bread is great and it was crunchy on the outside, but warm in the middle.  The pickle was a perfect dill and there was a ton of salami on the sandwich.  But, it's hard to justify $15 for this sandwich.  The salami was a bit oily, and $15 for a sandwich is high even is sf.  Especially given that it's at 6th and Folsom (not the nicest block.).

This sandwich literally eats like a burger. It's packed with generous servings of brisket, corned beef and kosher salami. The muenster cheese provides awesome goodness while the sharp cheddar adds another layer of flavor. With each bite, the slaw and cherry peppers provide great crunch and heat.

Their Grog sandwich sounds bomb too - brisket, bacon, cherry peppers, American cheeses, 1000 island, Board sauce and cole slaw on a garlic french roll. They also offer several selections of bread. I wanted to get the $$$ on dutch crunch but decided to stay true to their own creation and take it as is. They have wheat, french roll, dutch crunch and variations of the last two - garlic french and garlic dutch. If you're not in the mood for a sandwich, they also have salads. But let's be serious...

It's originally served on a French Roll, which I would recommend staying with! However, the corned beef, pastrami, and brisket were all really tender, but a little salty.

The new place is beautiful and with more seating area than I ever expected, I really liked what they did with it.  Even then, with the nice weather, I ended up going outside to wait.  Hey, old habits die hard!!!  I guess somehow I got used to hanging outside while my sandwich is being made.\n\nAnd what a sandwich it was!!!  Someone was nice enough to bring a bag with my order outside to me and I discovered that it is an easy hop onto the freeway from there.  I admit I drove faster than I should have on my way home since I was hungry and wanted to eat it while it was still warm.  I even kept the sunroof closed which is highly unusual for me, but I didn't want my sandwiches to get cold.

Go here if you're looking for a decent to large to oversized portion of meat in your sandwich (I assume the veggies are overstuffed too) and be prepared to be very happy once you leave.  Still, I found that maybe, just maybe, there was too much meat in my sandwich, such that it detracted from the rest of the elements of my meal.  Note that the bread is usually baked in house, a la deliboardsf.com, and that you can certainly tell that this is the case by TASTING IT.  The Dutch Crunch, for one, was amazing!\n\nMy only qualms were that the line was out the door, which made for a somewhat stuffy atmosphere, and that the tables were really, really close together.  I get it, that's how a business is run, so that's fine.  I wonder if it wouldn't make sense for the management to petition for a parklet out front.  I'm sure that there are several who would disagree with me on that point, being that parking is limited as it is, but I think it could do more good than harm; businesses succeed or fail, first and foremost, via word of mouth and presentation.  A line out the door is a GOOD thing, yes, but seeing people actually sitting out in front of Deli Board would a) reduce congestion inside and b) bring in more foot traffic.  It's a win/win!\n\nTIP:  Order ahead?\n\nTIP:  The bread is made in house... YUM\n\nTIP:  The water comes in small cups and getting a refill can be a pain.  Consider bringing your own water and/or ordering a drink.  Or, Deli Board, can you consider moving it out from behind the counter?\n\n4 out of 5!", "author": "Bryan H."}

All the sandwiches were hefty and heavy STUFFED with lots of meat and whole pickle in a ziplock bag.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW0vRdM8N-rteR2FfV1jg?select=HFVwJKJjR3sZ0y0I62_Rvg\n3.  The pickles were chunky, crunchy and reminded me of the deli pickles in New York. The bread is always fresh. The signature sauce compliments but does not overpower the sandwich.\n\nWould I join those folks on the sidewalk if  ever Deli Board decides to not deliver anymore, you betcha! I am the one in the big sunglasses.\n\nPRICE: $7-$9 per ginormous delicious sandwich.", "author": "Leah E."}

Long story short, I have been a Deli Board customer since their first day in business. And I fear that Deli Board is changing for the worst. \n\nBack in the day, Deli Board was (literally) a window on Howard and 7th. You'd go up, order a sandwich from a paper menu, stand outside on the street, and then it would appear - almost magically. My co-workers and I literally went there every day, and for good reason. Awesome sandwiches (big enough for people with a hearty appetite), delicious side of pickles with every order, Danae (server) and Adam (owner I think) were the nicest people ever. Literally the best meat you could find on a deli sandwich. We had days where we'd skip breakfast just to tackle the Boca (brisket, pastrami, and corned beef). I loved the D-Nice (Turkey, Bacon, Hot Peppers), Skinny Rueben (Turkey Rueben), and Zeke (Turkey, Cream Cheese, and Sprouts). Ten million stars. This customer satisfaction led to Deli Board opening their very own location just a few blocks away on Folsom (where it is now). And it was awesome. Now we had an actual venue. A place you could sit down. I'd even bring clients there, as it was a true San Francisco spot that I loved. \n\nHowever, the last three times I have been to Deli Board, I have not had a good experience. For one, the service is worse than it used to be. The people who take your order are still fairly friendly, but the people who give you your sandwich don't really even look at you or smile. Second, prices are through the roof. Double what they were when Deli Board got started out. Third, you get less sandwich than you used to, so despite paying way more, you're more hungry. Fourth, you get less pickle than you used to. Fifth, they aren't running some of the sandwiches that they used to make, even for loyal customers. Sixth, the atmosphere was about getting as much of my money as possible. I'm surprised that they didn't charge for napkins. \n\nLook -\u00a0I get it. Businesses have to grow and have to make more money. They should charge more and increase product margins once they get more customers. \n\nHowever, Deli Board is on a bad trajectory. Their business no longer is about making the best sandwich, keeping customers happy, and ensuring customers come back. Their business is trending toward making you feel like you overpaid for something that wasn't worth it. \n\nI hope this trajectory changes, as this used to be a place I truly loved. There are a ton of other sandwich shops within walking distance of Deli Board that have just as good a product. Go there instead.", "author": "Kane R."}

Also, the Zeke was pretty good too but not as good as the $$$.  Skip your health kick for a meal and just go all the way with the $$$.  The only substitution I would make is to get the dutch bread instead of the regular roll.  Anytime you see dutch bread as an option, you should always get that.

My sandwich felt like it weighed five pounds.\n\nEven on this rainy day, there was a small crowd gathered outside. The staff set out some umbrellas for us to use while we waited for our food - that was a nice touch :)\n\nBack to the Boca - this thing was huge (that's what she said!).

I ordered, waited about 5 minutes but it seemed forever.. \n\nThen.. there it is.. another nice lady came to bring my order out.  I ran to my car and opened my prize... I was amazed w/ just the appearance of it when I unwrapped it.. I think I may have died the second I took a bite out of my Boca, added jalapenos.. the pickles, the Muenster cheese, the piles of meat (nicely piled though) blended so well together.\n\nI might come back tomorrow..

Some of my friends have been ranting and raving about this place recently and I decided that this past Saturday I had to make trying it a priority. There's nothing like a solid sandwich when you're hungover and let me just tell you, Deli Board hit the spot.\n\nMy two friends and I arrived there at around 12:45pm on Saturday afternoon and the place was busy, but luckily, we missed the massive rush of people! 15 minutes later, there was a line out the door...also, keep in mind that the sandwiches take about 10 minutes to make, so you'll have to wait for those too.\n\nI don't eat red meat, so it was pretty easy for me to make my selection: I ordered the Zeke without bacon but also got a side of 'board sauce'. This sandwich was all kinds of wow. It's served on a french roll, super nomtastic - it's soft and not too thick and is filled with avocado, cream cheese, turkey, etc. They stuff the sandwich in with lots of turkey so you'll get full pretty quickly. I saved half my sandwich for later in the day. Another one of my friends got the Rueben's cousin, and another one of my friends got the falafel one (forgot what it's called), but all are very very yummy.\n\nI just think this place has really fresh tasting sandwiches, and the staff is SO COOL. They're fun and quirky and so cheery. They'll tell you what they think is best, and they're so upbeat! I love it. They also play real records as the music here (super cool - the lady made me hold on so she could change the record in the back), and the decor is all wooden yet modern looking.\n\nAlthough the sandwiches are a bit pricey ($9-11), I think they're well worth it. They have tons of sauces you can throw on at the front counter too. The boardsauce is yummy times, be sure to get it on the side. \n\nOnly bummer is that it's only open during lunch hours, so go here on a Saturday if you need to-- I think they're closed on Sundays. Officially my new favorite sandwich place in SF, can't wait to go back and try more of em!

Each bite packs a wallop of flavor that renders you speechless for a minute or two.

Get this if you're not as much of a corned beef fan, and you'd like to stick to traditional brisket.\n\nYes, the sandwiches are a bit pricey at around $11 each, but the quality of the ingredients, the size of the sandwiches, and the explosive power of the flavors make it one hell of a deal. \n\nThink of Deli Board like a mature adult version of Ike's Place.

The atmosphere of this place is really fun and laid back, with most of their menu items named after people (I had the \"Stephanie\"). The staff that work there are really cool, fun to talk to, and seem to enjoy being there. Moe is my favorite!\n\nLike I said, I had the \"Stephanie\", which was tuna salad, american cheese, bacon, sprouts, and their special sauce, all on a French Roll. This was such an amazing sandwich! It was also the HOTTEST grilled sandwich I've ever had! It went from the grill to my table in less than 10 seconds, easily. Deli Board also gives you a ziplock bag with a giant pickle in it, which is really cool because it feels like a true homemade lunch you are taking with you somewhere!\n\nThe only thing I didn't like about Deli Board, and this isn't entirely their fault, is that it was really hit inside. The day I was in San Francisco eating there was one of the hottest days the city had experienced that summer, so it was hot everywhere. But Deli Board doesn't have air conditioning, nor did they have any fans going to cool down their customers. They did offer free cold water, but that didn't cool me off much. It was almost unbearable in there, unfortunately.\n\nBesides the uncomfortably hot air inside, Deli Board was a great experience. Great food, quick service, and friendly staff.

After checking with the chef, they said yes for $2 - done!  \n\nWhat we had:\n\nBoca - pastrami corned beef and brisket muenster cheese Board sauce brown mustard pickles sweet french - $11 and added a fried egg - $2. \n\nd. nice - turkey breast bacon avocado pepperoncini blend cheddar\ncole slaw Board sauce brown mustard sweet french -$10\n\nbottled coke, free water.\n\nAll sandwiches are hot.  It's perfectly toasted - crunchy outside and soft inside...the heat makes for a very juicy sandwich with the meat, cheese, special sauce...etc.  The Boca was insane especially with the fried egg.  If you like meat, this is a must have - it's loaded w/ brisket, corned beef and pastrami.  The turkey was just as insane - loads of turkey, bacon, creamy delicious avacado...YUM!\n\nWhile we were enjoying our boca, the chef came out asking \"who asked for the fried egg on the boca?\" - first thought that came to mind was \"crap, he wants to see who's the trouble maker\".  When he asked the 2nd time, I raised my hand.  He smiled and said that's awesome then came over to ask us if it was good.  We nodded and gave the thumbs up and said \"everything taste better with an egg\" and he agreed.\n\nIf you like their meat, you can take them home - they sell them with a 1/4 pound minimum.\n\nLook forward to our next visit.", "author": "Gloria H."}

I had the Golden-Burg-N-Stein (I think that's how you spell it). It's a french roll that's filled with a lot of meat, mainly tasting of corn beef. This sandwich has to be one of the most condensed and compact of sandwiches. I don't know how they squish so much meat into one sandwich! It's perfectly constructed so that eat bite cuts through smoothly. It still drips a little grease. I couldn't really taste much else besides the corn beef and bread even though there were some other ingredients added to the mix. The slaw is almost laughably small in comparison to the amount of meat. I wish there had been just a bit more veg for a different texture. A sandwich comes with two quarters of a giant pickle.\n\nThe sandwiches aren't that big. They're \"pocket-friendly\"; however, since they're packed so tight with meat you shouldn't be hungry afterwards. I ate my entire sandwich and thought that I was going to tip over. Watch out because these sandwiches are served piping hot. They're friggin' hot! (But good) $11 for a sandwich seems steep except once you start eating the sandwich you forget about the price. It has a sort of addictive quality. I do agree with Erica T's comment that the sandwich is pretty salty. You'll be fat and dehydrated afterwards.\n\nThe interior is pretty basic. Just one little storefront with enough seating for maybe 30. The walls are covered with menus and sandwich photos. There are two cashiers and nothing much else. This is a sandwich shop after all. Most of the clientele looked to be young white and asian. It always seems to be busy.\n\n____\n\nIf you're craving a well constructed hot meat sandwich this is the place to check out.", "author": "Michael H."}

So I hunted around and, thanks to my fellow Yelpers, found the Deli Board.\n\nWe ordered the Build-Your-Own board with roast beef, turkey breast, and black forest ham (with provolone & cheddar cheeses).

These sandwiches created a feeling in me that I can only describe as what I imagine Andy Dick feels like when he buys coke. It was just THAT. GOOD. My brother-in-law snuck into the room to eat, too. He made a sandwich, bit into it, and I'm pretty sure his eyes were gonna bug out of his head; he looked at me and said, \"Holy crap, this is the best sandwich ever!\". \n\nAnd he's pretty right. The meats were all super fresh and tasty, and the roast beef was perfectly cooked (medium to medium-rare, thank you - just as roast beef should be!). The bread was still warm when they brought it to us, and the condiments & fixins were just amazing. All in all, it was a great way to start a busy, busy day.\n\nAs if amazing food wasn't enough, the staff who helped us were just unbelievably courteous and friendly. Adam, who handles all the catering orders, was SUPER friendly and really great with handling our order. The person who delivered our food (I think his name was Jim...) was also really friendly and helped us sort out of the food on the table before he left. All the folks I spoke with over the phone were great, too.

The fresh bread is pretty good! The prices are a bit pricy, in my opinion, but the portions are large. I think it would be better if they had a half sandwich option, for a cheaper price, especially for those who are visiting just as my friends and I were. The atmosphere was decent. It's a relatively small place, but there are plenty of little tables. The customer services was great! I gave this place 4 stars for two reasons:\n1. the prices are a bit high\n2. they put too much mayo/cream cheese on their sandwiches, which distracts from the flavor of what else is in the sandwich.\nI wasn't a fan of their homemade pickles, but my friends loved them.

I adore the staff like family and I eat there everyday.\n\nFrom Justin's delivery service to Adam's culinary versatility: there is a genuine passion and care put into this food that you just don't see at larger establishments. \n\nI have a pretty diverse palette, but the deliboard keeps me satisfied. I love that the menu changes monthly, and that each day there are 3 new specials.\n\nAs for the service, I've never had a bad experience. The staff is extremely friendly, flexible, and sexy. You just have to understand that it gets busy during the lunch rush and customers who're rude or have their heads up their keyster won't receive the pampered treatment they feel so entitled to. \n\nAnyone familiar with the SF sandwich game knows that the relationship between residential tenants and delis can be a little testy, sometimes it can lead to the demise of a beloved business; thus it is very important that you follow the rules. \n\nthe rules are very simple:\n\nDO NOT ENTER THE KITCHEN. If you complain that the staff is rude, chances are you never even considered reading the two GIANT signs that say \"STOP HERE, you will be helped\" and \"NOTICE: Employees Only!\" before you waltzed into the kitchen. \n\nMaybe you should've noticed the other 15 people politely waiting outside, maybe you could head back to to where ever it is you came, though  last I checked burger king doesn't allow their customers in the kitchen, either. \n\nDO NOT ORDER +9 SANDOS. If you need catering, use the catering menu, order 24 hours in advance, but do not try to game the deliboard by submitting multiple orders. You're not the first to try. It won't work.\n\nAs for people complaining about bike delivery needing a 35 minute window: when was the last time you ordered a pizza with a specific receiving time? Chinese food? Comcast? Hell, when did you ever have a sandwich personally delivered to you? Spoiled yelpers.\n\nDon't know what to do for lunch?

Simply delicious substitutions I must say.  Rumor has it that the board sauce is a mayonnaise based sauce with brown mustard and spices which provides a great condiment , this and the brown habanero sauce are the perfect compliments for any sandwich.  The bread is lightly toasted which gives it a nice crunch and brings texture to the sandwich.  Both the corn beef and the pastrami are surprisingly lean and are thin sliced resulting in a slightly sweet and salty assault on the palate. The homemade pickles are excellent although I did find the turkey to be a little dry.\n\nIt is a fairly small restaurant which tends to get very busy so it gets loud in the board. The staff is friendly and the wait is reasonable for the sandwich.  Prices are a little steep, with a sub and a drink averaging between twelve to fifteen dollars.

Seeing Deli Board on the list, I quickly pointed the name and confirmed, \"DELI BOARD! We are going to deli board!\" \n\nWell Deli Board ain't no shop, that I will tell you. I think they make their sandwiches inside a home/apartment. You stand outside an apartment complex and posted on the wall is their menu. Every once in a while, someone will come down to take orders, runs back up and runs back down to tell you the price of your order, they run back up with your credit card or cash and runs back down with your change or credit card receipt. \n\n10-15 minutes later, they run back down with your sandwich(es) and a side of pickles to eat with. Delicious! Their pickles are yummy and I think my mouth is watering right now as I'm typing this.... hold on, let me wipe my mouth. \n\nGot the pastrami sandwich w/ lettuce, pickles, avocado, jalapenos, grilled onions, sprouts and pepperjack.

I forgot about it until I saw the internal email go out to everyone that I selected today's lunch of salads and sandwiches from Deli Board. All of a sudden my food selection skills were on the line!\n\nThe food looked amazing upon arrival. We got three \"boards\" for a wide selection of sandwiches for the office: Board #1, Board #2 and Bubbees Board (these included ham, turkey, roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, brisket, egg salad, tuna salad, and chicken salad sandwiches), plus veggie and caprese sandwiches. There was also a box of pickles and peppers, all sauce was on the side-- which everyone appreciated-- a box of cookies and two kinds of salads with the housemade dressings.\n\nHow did my reputation fare this lunch selection? I feel like maybe I just got one stepper closer to being one of the cool kids.\n\nThe meat sandwiches have thin shaved meat which melts in your mouth (with a little board sauce and those pickles!), the vegetarians loved the caprese-esque sandwiches and the salads were also a huge hit. The fusion dressing was the perfect amount of tang and sweet and several people noted that it was really good. Would I go back? Absolutely. Would the office order from them again?

As Jewish men, we were immediately drawn in by the smell of warm pastrami and corned beef. I went with a GoldbergNStein and subbed brisket for salami. Ike's aside, a better sandwich in SF I've yet to have. The meat + slaw + 1000 island + cheese all came together to create a special lunch experience. If I was to design my ideal sandwich, I honestly think this would be it.\n\nWe had one small hiccup on coming here. I gave them the name \"Jon\" when I ordered and when the sandwich-artist brought out my meal, an imposter posed as \"Jon\" and took off with my lunch.

Yes, we had to wait in line (out the door, on the sidewalk), and yes the wait was kind of long-ish. However, everyone in line was pleasant, respectful, and obviously fixated on making a decision as to what lovely sandwich they were going to stuff into their faces.\n\nOnce we placed our order with the cute and friendly staff behind the counter, it took about 15 minutes to get our sandwiches, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait.\n\nI had a Gold-n-Berg-Stein ($11), which is a corned beef, pastrami & kosher salami sandwich with Muenster cheese, the house slaw, 1000 island dressing, served on  grilled sweet french bread. The mix of salty and sweet, creamy and crunchy, veggie and meat was truly something to behold. This is a big sandwich, filled to almost overflowing, and constructed in a way that, if you are careful, it is possible to take a bite without everything squirting out the back end.

I'm from Cleveland and there is nothing cool about it. \n\nBut these are very good sandwhiches.  I loved my turkey and cheese and my friend who is a very picky eater got the pastrami and commented after each bite about how good it was.  And she raved about the pickles.

So good.\n\nThe people who work there are nice and spin vinyl (real LP's) between orders.  \n\nThey get busy, so if you are pressed for time, go early or late.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-01-25", "description": "My coworkers and I ordered out of this place today. Here are the multiple reasons why I'm giving this \"establishment\" a horrible review. \n\nFirst off, I work in the entertainment industry, which is very fast paced and we don't have time to fiddle with pre ordering 24 hours in advance for a quick lunch. We we busy, therefore it was a slightly larger order, for 11 people to be exact. We weren't asking for anything to be different, i.e. either subtracting ingredients and adding others. \n\nSo my first complaint is that as soon as we picked up the phone today at 11:30 this morning, they said we could not place an order over the phone of this extent. Granted we had gone through all of the offices and specifically told them to look at Deli Board's menu. Because of this and because it's a hassle to go back and tell people that they didn't want to take our order, we decided to put most of them over the phone, and once there place the rest. MInd you. both girls that work outside the establishment taking orders were very polite and worked with everyone patiently waiting outside in a slightly sketchy side of SOMA. What really ticked me off is when one of the guys from the kitchen came specifically towards me and told me that because i had ordered more sandwiches once I made it over to the location, that it would take longer and that it was my fault that the sandwiches would not taste as great and to next time order 24 hours in advance because they care about the quality of the food. I politely nodded and inside thought, that was completely uncalled for. Why was I, who gave them a $100 dollar order being nagged for giving them this much business?? Un freaking believeable! \n\nAnother 10 minutes went by (this is by now 40 minutes from when the order was originally placed) and one of the girls told me that my order would soon come out. It did, with three guys and bags out the door- which mind you I had no idea that all three bags were the order that I had placed, therefore I asked if that was all of my order. One of them had the nerve to say, and I quote \" well, you placed the order!\" - OMG! Are you kidding me? Do you want the business or not? Do you want me to go back and tell my 200 + crew to never go through your establishment that is only opened from 11am til 3pm and say what a pain you were to deal with? Your sarcasm and your bad customer service makes me want to throw your sandwiches out the door and ask for my money back. How rude. Plain and simple they don't deserve your business and in downtown SF, if you don't deal with people properly, you'll just be another shop from the past. \n\nSo once I made it back to the office, I opened mine and granted for being a warm hummus sandwhich, the flavors were not worth even half of that experience. The sauce on the sandwhich was nothing more than what quiznos can do for a vegetarian. Perhaps their meat menu is what everyone else is craving, but this is nothing overboard. For all of you foodies, I prefer Brainwash a few blocks away for much better service, actual tables to sit on while you eat and a place that will treat you like a customer, not like you're a pain in their neck. \n\nSo again, if you work downtown and have a group of people larger than 9, this place won't bend over for you, or your money and if I were you, try Ike's place before even thinking that this is a biased review.", "author": "Carolina S."}

Easily big enough for two if you don't want to eat all your calories in a single meal.  They are really that big.   \n\nSo, there seems to be a bit of controversy in various reviews about how to order one of these yummy sammies.  One thing to understand is Deli Board is literally a hole in the wall, its a door you do not enter.  It is not a restaurant or cafe.  It has more in common with a food truck than cafe, except it has a permanent location. There is no inside at all.   I talked to the owner once about this and he said that Deli Board as it is is a bit of a phenomenon that he did not intend.  He was trying to open a catering and delivery sandwich shop and one day people started showing up at the door to order.  So he started to feed them.  And now it is what it is.  \n\nI've never had to wait longer than a minute to be waited on.  But it does take some time to have the order filled.  The only time I ever got any attitude was the first time I went and clueless-ly  started to walk in, ignoring several signs.  As far as waiting on the sidewalk the patrons almost always seem to be extra friendly.  I've always had a conversation started there with someone I've never met, like the self proclaimed Pastrami King of San Francisco.  Hell, its worth going just for that.", "author": "Michael D."}

I got to experience the deliciousness that Deli Board has to offer during a recent lunch meeting in the office, catered by Deli Board. Their version of Caprese [the Mila] sandwich was spectacular and the grilled vegetable sandwich [the Leia] with some other worldly spread -  was it cream cheese? Oh yes, it was. Either way, it was exactly what I was hoping for. No one makes em like that anymore.\n\nThat's not even the best part. The bread. I used to be something of a bread connoisseur before the advent of the Atkins diet. While I'm not a practicing Atkins dieter, it did help me take inventory on my abundant consumption of carbs and I have since slacked a bit in my hunt for delicious bread. I digress. This sandwich bread is perfect in every way. Soft, fresh hoagie rolls. Whether you go white or wheat. Pretty much everyone who got a bite of these is now planning a group pilgrimage over to the brick and mortar for more. Among the others tried and received rave reviews from the meat eaters were the brisket - this disappeared first, the corned beef and pastrami and turkey. I'm pretty sure some of us ate our weight in sandwiches that day. \n\nEven their pickles are crisp, fresh, and delicious. Perhaps I'm starved for a decent sandwich in this neighborhood [doubtful because while this neighborhood is starved for variety in lunch options, there are sandwiches aplenty] but I'm definitely on board with Deli Board.", "author": "Angela N."}

For lunch. Ouch. Indoor seating accommodates maybe 30 people, but since there's always a crowd and line, it gets very full very fast. There doesn't seem to be any active airflow either, so on hot days, it's slightly uncomfortable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-31", "description": "I had two sandwiches in one day: \"The Mish\" and the Roast Beef. The Mish was a hot take-away sandwich, right from the kitchen. The Roast Beef was a 'catering' sandwich, pre-made and wrapped for catering setting.\n\nI don't care what anyone says; these two sandwiches are built for two very different settings.  And I think it's for a reason.\n\nThe hot, take-away sando is 'built for speed': made to be consumed within 15 minutes. After 20-30 minutes, the dressing is soaking into the bread and it can get a bit soggy (I had mine after about 10 mins.) The catering style sandwich is what i call 'built for cruising': it can sit for awhile in a conference room or office fridge.\n\nThe Mish was hands down the best sando I have ever had. A little heat from the jalapenos, with perfectly slow-grilled onions, and shaved meat siting on top of crispy bacon and toasted bread.  I hate sandwiches that when you bite into them whole pieces of ingredients get dragged out with the bite. This is NOT one of those.  No single bite had me dragging onions or bacon or pastrami from the sandwich.  And no gristle, either. Really, it was warm, easy to eat (even while standing on the Muni train), and had an incredible combination of flavors.  This had East Coast written all over it.\n\nThe Roast Beef (catering wrapped) was a solid sandwich. The bread was a little thicker than The Mish and had less dressing. I think they do this to cut down on the soggy factor. You can always add a little what-have-you when you get it in front of your face.  Like the Mish, this had shaved meat (roast beef on this one) that was seasoned just right, with horseradish and I think some spinach or lettuce between it and the bread (again, I think this is to cut down the soggy factor.  I ate this after it had an 12-hour layover in my fridge, and I have to say that it was every bit as good as The Mish. I'm partial to hot sandos, so I am going back for The Mish. But if I had to cater an event, I won't think twice about getting them from here.\n\nI haven't had the soup or breakfast, so don't ask me about that.  Maybe later.", "author": "Tristan D."}

I had my first Deli Board sandwich in August, and I still remember it clear as day-- Hands down the best sandwich shop in CA. This place is for meat-lovers, but there are sandwich and salad options If you're a vegan/vegetarian. On our first visit, we got the Boca (classic brisket, pastrami, corned beef) and the Zeke (turkey) and both were fantastic. Had the Boca and Carzle this weekend, and it was a good pairing of a classic (the Boca) and spicy (the Carzle). We liked the Carzle so much we went back the next day for it. A lot of it has to do with the carved meat and how it is thinly sliced, almost shredded, which makes for really easy bites out of a hefty sandwich. The bread is good too. The menu has plenty of choices but without overwhelming. You will pay extra for a sandwich here ($15 including a soda and chips) but it is TOTALLY worth it. The pickles are awesome and come with your sandwich. \n\nParking is easy and the lunch line can be long, but I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 5 minutes.

I ate here the next day after eating at this place called The Refuge in San Carlos..  I eat pastrami multiple times a week and this place was one my favorites.  The last time I ate here it seemed as if the portions of meat were getting smaller and smaller.  I ordered the pastrami on a roll and added bacon.  It was a huge disappointment.  The roll seemed to have shrunk.  I couldn't believe it.  This sandwich was about seven inches long.  It was an average pastrami sando.  Nothing special.  The bacon was definitely overcooked and I was still hungry after eating it.  This place will definitely go out of business soon.  I am from S.F. and this place will soon disappear.  Mark my words.

If you come during lunchtime during the week, you will definitely be in for a wait as nearly a dozen people milling around are waiting for their sammies. The owner, Adam Mesnick, is a cool guy who takes his sandwiches very seriously. The best thing I can say about this place is that they truly understand the concept of proportions. The width and crunch of the bread combined with the right amount of meat with a smattering of slaw for texture and just enough sauce...it all makes for a very elite sandwich, which is good cuz you are paying elite sandwich prices! (It is not a particularly large sandwich either, as I can put 2 of them down in 1 sitting on a hungry day). My favorite sandwich to date (out of 3 thus far) would be the Carzle, a combo of super thinly sliced brisket and pastrami with just enough provolone to hold it all together, with pickles in the sandwich already; my only complaint is I wish that the peppers he chose were hotter. While I might be able to buy 2 bowls of pho with the same amount of money, if you are craving an extremely dope sandwich before their early closing time, I'd say this place is your spot.", "author": "Gene C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-23", "description": "In writing this review, I was incredibly torn about how to rate it.  I had my first experience with Deli Board at lunch yesterday.  My friend emphatically recommended it, so we called in an order and were told it would be half an hour.  That sounded a bit long, but it wasn't a problem with us.  \n\nWe showed up about 20 minutes later, expecting to wait a little longer for our food.  Little did we know, however, that we would be waiting there for over a half an hour.  Let me make this very clear: it took almost an HOUR for them to prepare 3 sandwiches that were called in.\n\nWhat added to the absurdity of the wait time was that every single person who walked up and placed an order while we were waiting (including both those who had called in and those who were placing their order at the window) received their sandwiches first.  At least 8-12 people received sandwiches before us while we waited (trying to be patient!).\n\nWhat was even more irritating was that the employees (friendly as they were) seemed to be making no effort whatsoever to make haste to get the orders completed.  There were no apologies for our 50+ minute wait, or the fact that others who came after us were served first.\n\nThat being said... once I took a bite of this heavenly sandwich, I was very pleased.  I got the Zeke, which had turkey, bacon, cream cheese, avocado and sprouts... and WOW.  Delicious.  My friend had the Ron, which was beef with cheddar, jalapenos, and avocado.  Both are HIGHLY recommended.\n\nIn other words... if you're going to get a sandwich from here, allow yourself at least an hour.  I missed my afternoon class because of that, and despite how delicious the sandwich was, I left pretty irked.  Or better yet, have it delivered, and make sure to place your order absurdly early if you hope to get your food before you starve.", "author": "Erin B."}

Heard great things and seen all the big meaty pictures of their selections. \n\nI ordered the Boca and wow. It was just packed with deli thin meats with pickles, sauce, and fitted into their toasted french roll. I have to say I prefer this over my experience at Ike's. Sure, Ike's sandwiches are unique and VERY hearty, but this place is almost too simple, and simple is sometimes better. Great quality meats and it really fills you up. A bit on the expensive side, but well worth a try. \n\nThe area that it's in isn't too bad. As long as there's daylight and people around, it should be fine. However, Deli Board is easy to miss if you don't look for it carefully. I only knew it was there because my cousin saw a building with some people outside. It looked just like a run down apartment on the outside, so the only way you can tell it's Deli Board is by the sign on the window and the line of people waiting to get their lunch. \n\nThe people were really friendly too. The person who took the orders was nice and chatted with the people outside. I also really recommend calling in before to place your order.\n\nI'm dying to get another sandwich from this place.

And the people there are friendly enough.\n\nI had the Mila sandwich with tomato, greens, basil, pesto, fresh mozzarella.\n\nA number of very real problems here:\n\n*  The bread doesn't hold up to moisture so it's soggy by the time you sit down and eat it.  Like most rational grown-ups, I HATE soggy bread, especially on expensive sandwiches.  This isn't Subway, guys.\n\n*  The bread by itself has no flavor at all and it's that halfway-between-Merita-and-baguette style that makes no sense for carry-out sandwiches.  A good sandwich needs a crusty bread to withstand moisture, to be easy to hold, and the interior should be buttered (or brushed with oil, or toasted, anything) to help keep moisture out.  \n\n*  And even if it were the best bread in the world, it makes no sense whatsoever to serve mostly soft ingredients on soft bread.\n\n*  The \"fresh mozzarella\" is completely bland.  No, it's not supposed to be that way.  It's unseasoned.\n\n*  The tomatoes were at least ripe, so props for that, but the ripeness just contributes to the sogginess.  Again, unseasoned.\n\n*  There's an uneven pesto spread that's predominantly just salty.  It's really the only seasoning on the sandwich, and it has little standalone flavor.  Because nothing else on the sandwich is seasoned, you just get a hit of pure salt, followed by an abyss of flavorless mush.\n\n*  The thing is heavy.  I'm all for big portions if it keeps me wanting more.  Not so here.\n\n*  The pickles are pretty good; granted, it's hard to screw up pickles.  The way they're cut makes no sense at all.  Shouldn't you be able to put the pickle on your sandwich without overwhelming its flavor?  Why cut them into such thick slabs?\n\nThe people here saying this place has the best sandwiches in the area ... wow.  It's like a parallel universe exists where flavor, texture, and quality don't matter; salt and pepper are virtually forbidden.

As I'm writing this I'm contemplating going back to buy this sandwich again because it sounds so good. \nBut then I remember what happened when I ate said sandwich. \n\nThe Bateman turned into a Meat and Mayo sandwich. \n\nNo veggies, no cream cheese, not toasted, crappy bread. OVERRATED. \n\nMaybe it was just the sandwich I ordered, but look again at the ingredients. It's pretty hard to mess that sandwich up. But omitting 90% of what the sandwich is suppose to be is a great way to start Deli Board. To be honest the ingredients were in there...somewhere. But a sandwich must have balance. More fat doesn't make a sandwich taste better, just fattier. Some of us can taste the difference. \n\nI really wanted to give Deli Board a 1 star. My hopes were so high for this place, and it was all dashed away by a flood of meat and lard. \n\nBut the sandwiches aren't poisonous or disgusting, just really really disappointing.", "author": "Alex M."}

You might pop a boner just looking at it.  A meat stack of easily 2-2.5 inches..it's fair to say 75% of the entire sandwich is meat, you can barely see the other condiments.  The Boca is out of control - 3 cuts of meat w/ melted cheese oozing from in between.  The Gold-N-Berg-N-Stein is also tasty, similar to the Boca but more saucy.  The Zeke probably has the most enticing combo of everything - bacon, avocado, sprouts, cream cheese w/ a huge pile of turkey, all for $8.

But that leaves very little time dedicated to sitting down and spending the 45 min it takes to come up with something worth-while and witty to post on a yelp, all in hopes that some sexy hot stranger sends me a message reading \"I like your review, lets act like two sea turtles and have wicked hot sex.\" Because sea turtles = wicked hot sex. \n\nWell I found something, no no, I was introduced to something that merits mention on the hallowed virtual halls of yelp... and by the looks of it, I am not that only person that thinks so. \n\nDeli board, deli board, deli board. You have re-awakened an obsessive foody beast once again. I  was given bagel chips, with fresh made veggi shmear, or something along those lines. If i wasn't in the company of others, I would have seriously violated that little container or creamy goodness. I also had the Boca sandwich, which with the first single experimental nibble I felt it necessary to remove my jacket, because I knew things were about to get serious. The Boca is this warm, delicious little layered creation or freshly made, and prepared in house, combination of pastrami, corned beef, and brisket. That alone should make your mouth water, but with the delicious drippings of that meaty trinity mingling with amazing house sauces... well... the most non-perverted and creepy way of putting it is... I savored every bite.   \n\nEverything at Deli Board is made, cured, concocted, simmered, grilled in house. Even the pickles... which I naturally hate, unless deep fried (because I'm fat), but the pickle that was given was like no pickle I've ever had. It was fresh, light, dreamy even, providing euphoric visions of two sea turtles making wicked hot sex. \n\nWhen I finally made it home last night, I opened the fridge and let out a sigh. My house is not deli board. My fridge contains nothing worth making. I went to bed hungry last night. Hungry and yearning for some more deli board. \n\nBravo Deli Board.

Because it was a fly by night trip to SF (and I didn't check in on the Yelp app... *handslap* bad Jon Bon Jovial, bad!), I didn't remember to write this until I recently I got the meat sweats and it took me back straight to that sensational meat session. \n\nNote: this review may be vaseline-lensed, or have a Saved By The Bell pink-hue boarder, to give it some nostalgia. \n\nLike most days, coffee takes precedence over protein. When I realized I should eat, I had 30 minutes before a pretty important meeting. I was on foot back to The Mosser (later, you'll find out why the Deli Board justified this hotel stay). I didn't even have time to check the Yelp app for anything nearby. I turn the corner to see a fistful of folks standing around with an Angel from Reubenia handing greasy brown bags with the waft of pastrami to them. I notice her order paper pad, and I dart. Without looking at the menu, \"Reuben?\" She jots, then darts into a dark room. I looked around and no one other than her & her fellow angel-winged Reubenian were the only two going in & out. I couldn't make out what was happening in there, but I knew what was coming out of it. \n\nI hoof it to the hotel. In 18 minutes I need to iron a shirt and scarf this reuben. The reuben clearly takes top priority over de-wrinkling. I can only get halfway through the reuben before I have to leave. No fridge in the room (proves to be a good thing). I don't fret over it as the meeting should just be an hour. I start to get the meat sweats about half-way through the 1st half of the sandwich. I consider showering. Bah! Roll with it. Those meat sweats will allure all in my path. I leave the 2nd half of the sandwich in the room. I get back from the meeting and I can smell that reuben down the hall. The only way The Mosser can justify those tiny rooms is to leave a Deli Board sandwich in there for about an hour and it becomes a nouveau sauna from Reubenia. Pastrami instead of cedar. Kraut instead of towels. I just lied down to let it all go osmosis into me, then took down the 2nd half. \n\nThe experience proved that even if you only have 20 minutes to order, scarf & sweat -- even without looking at the menu -- it's worth it.

I prefer hand sliced meats but I know some people prefer machine sliced.\nThe meat, we were told was from Chicago - looked smelled and tasted like industrial CAFO meat - which seemed right for the price. A Pickle was sliced into 4 wedges and it tasted pretty commercial too.The sandwiches were well wrapped and nicely presented.\nI wish Deli Board luck and would encourage them to go local especially with the bread. They have only been open a few months.I will try them again in a few months.", "author": "p l."}

But as soon as you've begun to appreciate the perfection that is the sweet french, the flavor of the meats and cheese melded together draws no less than a visceral utterance of satisfaction. It's a good amount of meat and the price point is great given that it's delivered to your door. AMAZING!\n\nIf you're not a vegetarian or a vegan, I would recommend sticking with the meat-based sandos.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-01-03", "description": "I tried deli board for the first time today. To be honest I wasn't blown away or anything, but perhaps my expectations were just a little high, after hearing so much about this place and seeing the great yelp reviews and the crowds lined up to eat there. I did enjoy my meal, though. It was definitely worth going and I would definitely go back if for no other reason than to try one or two more of the many concoctions on their extensive sandwich menu. The service was very friendly and the sandwich came out pretty quickly, considering how crowded the place was. All of the interesting combinations of cured meats and other unique ingredients on the sandwiches are what I guess what sets this place apart and makes it so popular. I got the \"Cohen\" sandwich, which has corned beef, brisket, white american cheese, cherry peppers, and coleslaw. Like I said, it was good, and worth checking out, but don't expect to have a sandwich epiphany or anything. I guess I just thought the unique combo of ingredients would make the flavors pop more than they did. On the plus side the sandwich came out nice and hot with nicely melted cheese and the french roll was very good (not enough sandwich places go the extra mile to use high quality breads like this!). My only small complaints were that the corned beef and brisket were put on opposite sides of the sandwich (this was done on purpose but personally I would've preferred to try the combination of the meats together) and they used spicy cherry peppers. Usually when you see cherry peppers on a sandwich (they are popular on authentic cheese steaks, for example) they are of the sweet variety, which makes a better contrast of flavors with the salty meats. Also I could see coleslaw on the sandwich but couldn't really taste it, it didn't really add anything to the sandwich. Overall very small complaints, and my only reason for not rating deli board higher than 3 stars is because I thought it was good and satisfying, but not great and not anything I haven't had before. Perhaps my rating will go up after I try one or two more of their creations.", "author": "Benny A."}

A toasted version of this would be killer, and possibly trump my favorite pastrami spot on west portal.\n\nTurkey and ham was nice blend of meats, although I wouldn't mind sacrificing a few slices in exchange for more vegi, and I'm not sure if the dijon mustard was a good choice...unless there was another sauce to counterbalance the strong mustardy taste. A toasted version here would have also made an impact.\n\nThis is a great place to grab catering for a large office! Fresh sides, huge cookies, soups, and bagel chips! No co-worker will leave hungry.", "author": "wes w."}

I was recently in SF and had the pleasure of sampling the menu at Deli Board, SF's new home for fantastic east coast deli-style grub.  My hands down favorite is the Mikey Likes It - piled high with THE BEST pastrami this side of NYC.  The special sauce made what was already the best pastrami sandwich i ever had 10 times better.  WOW.  Also of note was the Kosher club - real deal kosher salami!  Oy vey!\n\nI have to agree with everyone else about the wings.  Baked (not fried) to crispy, juicy perfection.  I highly recommend getting yourself some - perfect for game day.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing on the menu is the daily selection of savory bread pudding.  Imagine a ruben sandwich that you can eat like a piece of cake...you get the idea. \n\nAnd the best part?  You don't even have to get off your ass to go get it.  They will bring it to you!

The husband and I had the day off, so we decided to get food somewhere we can't normally go during regular business hours. Thanks to Yelp, we checked out the Deli Board. We were a little confused by the nondescript entrance and the fact that they took our order on the sidewalk, but the guys there were super nice and helpful. I ordered the \"bg\" (brisket, with cheddar cheese, peppers, house slaw, tomato, pickles, red onion, and board sauce on a sweet french roll). He got the \"Mal\" (corned beef and pastrami with muentser cheese, house slaw, brown mustard, and board sauce on sourdough). Holy crap, these things were ridiculicious. My brisket was piled high and so tender it barely required chewing. The bread deserves equal praise--soft and soaked in the brisket juices, but burly enough to handle all that meat (that's what she said). Based on the size of the sandwich and that I haven't worked out all week, I had thought that I would only eat half, but I couldn't help myself and the next thing I knew, I was polishing off the last bite of the entire freaking sandwich, which was the size of a small dog. My husband said I'd regret it, and even though I am still painfully full 6 hours later, I'd do it all over again...", "author": "Angie Y."}

We knew it was a delivery/pick-up place only and wanted to see what it was about...\nNot sure if the guy out front was \"Adam\", but he was very friendly... my gf wanted to go there, but I told her \"they might not be happy to have people going there right before they close...\" and she said \"not everyone is like that (gets annoyed when customers go in just before closing)...\" She was right... The girl who came out to \"take our order\" was very friendly as well... We ordered the Zeke and Zoe... another guy had brought out the sandwiches and he was really friendly, too...\nWe took our 13-year old dog and sandwiches to the park... The three of us enjoyed the sandwiches... yes, including our dog... (btw, we don't feed junk food to him...) This was our first visit and it won't be our last... My gf says Deli Board is better than the Sandwich Shop and is different than Ike's in that DB's is fresh and simple... and the bread is better than Ike's...

On a whim, I decided to give Adam and crew a call to see if I could somehow convince them to make me a sandwich on Saturday since as far as I knew they only slanged sammies Mon-Fri. To my me and my wife's delight Adam tells us, \"come on in, it's the first Saturday we are doing sammies, they will be waiting for you when you get here\"....I ordered two \"Amol's\", how could I not? They were epic, so delicious, I can't describe how happy those moments of eating that sandwich made me. Adam even hooked me up with the usual \"extra mustard\" and offered to sell me a big gallon tub because I am hopelessly addicted to that stuff.

Yes there is a weird \"spy\" like vibe when you walk up to a random apartment door and look at a faded menu in the window.  Yes there is a nice girl that comes out with a small notepad and takes your order and money while you question whether or not she's going to bail with it this time, and yes the sandwich will weigh more than your Shitszu.  But OMG, this sandwich is good.  It's what you would make if you had all day and your choice of the finest meats, marinated to perfection and sliced razor thin on a soft roll.  Did you know that Adam (the owner) is actually a soup master?  Next time you go, try the soup.  God knows I haven't been able to deviate from the sandwiches yet myself, but the soup is legit.

I didn't get much sleep Sunday night, something having to do with a pair of lost keys... Anyway.. After renting a Zipcar and running some errands, I drove to Deli Board on Folsom to fill up my personal gas tank. I parked illegally outside and walked in. The queue had about 8 people, with 15 others waiting around for their orders. In my experience, this is the typical crowd size for \"early\" lunch. Problem- I only had 20 min left on my Zipcar reservation. Even if I got my food instantly I would have been delayed on the return. (As other Zipsters know, late returns carry a hefty penalty.) So that was my dilemma, sandwich or Zipcar. I chose the sandwich! This food is that good. I extended my Zipcar reservation over the phone (a monetary burden no doubt), got in the Deli Board queue, ordered the BK and sat down. In 10 minutes my fare was delivered to my table. The BK is a massive sando with the sole purpose of providing an all encompassing eating experience. Sausage, bacon and fried eggs, dressed with American cheese and that amazing homemade board sauce. Did someone say Dutch Crunch bread? I wasn't the only one excited to eat. There were many smiles in that building today. I'll be back soon.", "author": "Nicholas E."}

This is a deli with a Cleveland flair and it doesn't disappoint.  My wife and I arrived about 11:30 am. and were glad we did, because the line gets long--out the door by noon.  But, even if you are in line, the service is very fast--Adam Mesnick, the owner, sees to that.  He has put together a wonderful menu of homemade soups and sandwiches that are spectacular.  We split the Boca and the Gold-n-Berg-n-stein (best sandwich ever!!!) sandwiches along with unique cream of spinach soup this week.  The sandwiches are piled high with flown-in corned beef and pastrami and settle in with a special sauce.  Served with a delicious pickle, they are flavorful, mouth watering and extremely satisfying.  The soup, one of Adam's specialties, was also not to be missed.  The ambiance is plain but funky.  Old lps on the record player are a nice touch.  Adam likes to join the customers (great touch) and the service is quick and friendly.  Now, if they add a cookie.", "author": "Richard L."}

Nope - this one is TWICE the fun. Now these Yelper bozo's have created a Yelper \"war\" between the TWO most mediocre sandwich joints in town - Ike's and the Deli Board. I gotta say - it is just about as funny and idiotic as anything on Yelp to date. Instead of the usual hype and rant over some completely average (or less than average) single store front location in the bay area - we now have Yelper commentary on which is cooler - the limited hours of Deli Board or the tiny out-of-the-way location of Ike's. When you add in all the blathering about Ike's recent eviction woes - it is priceless Yelper over the top hype \"please please think I am cool too\" nonsense! I just can't take it anymore - I have tears in my eyes I am laughing so hard. The same thing happens to me when I drive by Ike's and see 20 idiots standing in line to buy a $10.00 sandwich that you could get across the street at Safeway for about half the price - and no waiting. OK - forgive me - Ike's is better than Safeway - but not much better - really it isn't - same for Deli Board. The sandwiches are good - not great - not even really good - they are good. Keep it up Yelpers - honestly - this has got my interest in you clowns peaked again. Just when I think you can't get any more mindbogglingly stupid - you do. Congrats!", "author": "stephanie d."}
