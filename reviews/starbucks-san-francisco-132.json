It mirrors the shithole this city has become, unfortunately, but Laurel Heights remains relatively nice, so it's kind of strange. I guess people flock here from all over because it's the only 24/7 Starbucks in SF. \n\nThe bathrooms are filthy. On the bright side, I doubt the asinine new public bathroom policy announced the other day will affect this location. The bathrooms are tucked away where it's impossible for baristas to tell if people have purchased something. \n\nSpeaking of the baristas, this so isn't the demographic I'm used to. They are highly unprofessional and rude, and they make the worst drinks around. As an aside, whose job is it to keep the store stocked? Are the employees tasked with reporting what they need on an average night? They have been out of essential ingredients every time I've stopped by lately, including last night. Like, how are you out of coffee base, and what is this repulsive replacement?", "author": "Paulina F."}

It's open 24 hours, it's a haven for homeless people and it's dirty.\n\nIf you want to sit next to a greasy 50 year old homeless man who leers at women and calls one of them a f**king whore and stands up and physically intimidates her while she's seated because she took out her cell phone and he thought she was going to take a photo of him, this is the place for you.  The same man left and came back (with all his gear) three times in the hour I was there late last evening.  One time he got up and stood three feet behind an 11 year old girl who was at the condiment bar, staring a hole in the back of her head with a grin on his face.  Just standing there looking at her.  It was beyond creepy.  \n\nThen he ate potato chips and left crumbs all over the floor, as well as dirty napkins on the table.  In the entire time I was there not one employee cleaned anything.  \n\nFinally he decided to clean out his ears with a paper clip.  This went on for 20 minutes.  He was grinning the whole time.\n\nWhen he verbally attacked the woman she complained to the manager who instead of ejecting the man, said if she'd been assaulted he had to call the police.  So basically, management punted?\n\nThe police came and (I heard the whole thing) politely apologized to the man for the understanding then *suggested* he leave for a while.  He went out and stood in the bus stop.  The woman was still there when I left so I don't know if he came back in, but another woman I talked to said she's a regular and the man is *always* in there and is *always* leering at women.\n\nAnd he's just *one* of the homeless regulars.\n\nPlease note that since the Starbucks incident in Philadelphia, the instructions have come down from on high - anybody may use the bathroom, anybody may sit in Starbucks all day without buying anything, and you practically have to punch someone in the face to be ejected.  Note that this man was not ejected by management even after a customer complained that he had intimidated her and called her a f**king whore.  The manager's solution to this was to come over and tell the man not to communicate with the woman any more then kicked it upstairs to the police.  Didn't even tell him to move and he was sitting right next to her!", "author": "Hannah T."}

Be careful shopping in their regular grocery section since they ARE more expensive in this upscale neighborhood.\n\nI forgot to add also that you can BE FREE of those long lines for your drink by downloading the starbucks app at www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/mobile-apps for your mobile device.  You select this branch where you'll pick up your drink and their menu is presented to you on your mobile screen and then you order & pay on the mobile device and then your order goes straight to the barista who will have your order ready by the time you get to starbucks.  I usually pay with my app if I see a LONG line which NEARLY ALWAYS happens here at this popular Starbucks.  The only problem I have with the starbucks app is it takes up so much memory over 150MB.  You can increase your memory by buying a mobile SD memory card for your mobile device to hold your large docs(including music, videos) to make room for the starbucks app, but hey, to avoid waiting in 2 hour lines, it's going to STAY on my smartphone and I'd rather delete the other apps!!", "author": "Frugal C."}

I find it funny how I've been coming here for years since I work at the hospital down the street, how much the staff has changed in the last 6 months or so. I usually come here after a shift around 9 or 10pm sometimes... this is usually a busy time because it's when the SFPD night shift usually starts.  Regardless , every time I come here with co workers or just by myself I think it's the manager ..or supervisor, an older black woman has taken my order and every damn time she does not fail to have the worst and the most sour attitude with me. It's like she has a personal grudge with me. I know I have not done anything to her but wait my turn and order in the most polite way. I have witnessed her treat other customers like shit as well.  I have witnessed her berate a customer because english was not his first language. Smdh...starbucks should be ashamed to have a person like this on their staff!  She is rude, demeaning , and flat out doesn't give a shit how she is treating the customers. I mean we are paying for the drinks and she does work at Starbucks. She's not the owner and she's definitely not better than us. So how about you just do your job! And pretend to be friendly for once !... if you hate the job that much, don't work at Starbucks where you have to interact with people every day. I'm so sick of her attitude and have stopped coming here unfortunately.  I hope they get better staff and remove this rude and careless person, she should not be working in a customer service job....bitch should be working where she doesn't need to interact with anyone. \n\nAnd no, it's not always open 24/7 this same woman has kicked me and my party out around 1am before .", "author": "Coraline J."}

After apparently dismissing him, she said something under her breath and looked visibly irritated, which kind of made the atmosphere uncomfortable and awkward. After that a customer in front of me had some sort of issue with her order that she was also upset about.

I certainly did not think of you as a potential relationship, since I did not care for your seeming disregard for the small business man.  I thought that you were self absorbed & selfish.  I didn't trust you.  So, understandably, I kept you at arms length.\n\nAnd, seriously, your being from Seattle did not help matters any.  I'm a San Francisco snob.  Even worse; a North Beach snob.  We NB'ers drink espresso imported from Italy for chrisake.  Who the (bleep) is \"Starbucks\" from Seattle to show up here & who does he think he is?  What kahunas!  We turned up our noses, & oh...how we laughed.  You were mistaken for merely another interloper; not the first, & surely not the last.\n\nI figured you would continue your feeble attempts to lure me to you, & I would just continue to blow you off, & then you would be on your way back to Seattle.  And you would be completely forgotten.\n\nHow wrong I was.\n\nI can't put my finger on the exact moment you started to breed my interest instead of my contempt; but I do know that once you got me to turn that corner...I never turned back.\n\nProfessionally, you proved your integrity by the way you value your employees, contribute to your communities, & work to sustain & prosper our valuable resources.\n\nPersonally, you impressed me with how you are always there for me whenever I need you.  Day or night.  Even all night sometimes.  And it doesn't matter where I am; because wherever I happen to be, there you are, too.  You're always receptive & accommodating.  You always listen.  You have always happily put up w any requests I have.

And when I wanted organic, you gave me organic.  It seems that you just love making me happy!  Seriously, I've annoyed myself on many occasions.  But you?  Never.

Unfortunately, the second one was only slightly sweeter than the last, but no where near as good as I've had it done by so many other Starbucks baristas.\n\nI decided not to try a third attempt as it would only serve to frustrate both me and the barista.\n\nNow, when this has happened before, maybe 2% of the time, sometimes I'm told that I should ask for eight or nine pumps, or that WHOLE milk diluted the sweetness.\n\nThe other 98% of the time, other Starbucks baristas get it right the first time round (and on occasion, the second time round), with only the same instructions to go on.\n\nIn this case,I had left a pre drink tip of $2.

Not just to cure your morning headaches related to a lack of your caffeine fix, but also for those sad scholars trying to make their college tuition mean something. Which is exactly why I love the \"California Starbucks\" which is so conveniently located on California Street and so conveniently open 24/7.\n\nThey just recently renovated the place, so it is much more open and is now featuring even more spaces for you to study, chat, or read a good book. It also has a ton of outlets, which is so necessary seeing that 90% of people sitting here are on their electronic devices (I'm guilty too). \n\nThe bathroom has two stalls, which is beautiful and unheard of in any Starbucks, but Cali Starbucks is special. \n\nThe only downside is that parking is kind of a drag. There is a designated lot, but it's only 90 minute and there isn't much all day parking in the area, just a bunch of 2-hour parking. On top of that, everyone working at CPMC California tries to snag all of the good parking. \n\nWhatever the case, Cali Starbucks has all of the sugar, caffeine, and open hours you need to live your nocturnal life, so I'm definitely glad that it exists.", "author": "Cara O."}

There is more light in the back corridor area where the seating expansion occurred, and the bathrooms are now *unlockable* (which is atypical for a Starbucks), and the bathrooms can accommodate multiple people at a time.   No more will people hog the bathroom to themselves for hours doing who-knows-what.    Definitely not friendly to homeless people trying to take a bath at the sink now.  Before the upgrade I also saw a fisherman with a pole and fish bucket leave the bathroom just before I entered, and there were fish scales clogging the sink and fish guts in the trash can.   I doubt any of those creative uses of the bathrooms will occur now.  Thank God.\n\nAlso as expected, the wifi is still painfully slow.  It's AT&T wifi.  No upgrade there.  I clocked the wifi in the uncrowded store, (uncrowded because many don't yet know it has reopened), at 2.23 Mbps down, 2.84 Mbps up.  Once it gets crowded again, expect it to drop to 1 Mbps down and up, or if it has a lot of heavy bandwidth users, 0.5 Mbps down and up.   For scale, streaming *one* HD video won't need much buffering at 2 Mbps.   So close all your web pages if you want to stream a video.   Expect to continue to hear people complain about the wifi being \"dial-up\" speed.\n\nBut for those who must have a late night Starbucks with fast wifi, I noticed the Dublin Starbucks (In the shopping center off of the Hacienda Dr. exit) which is open to 1 am every day was recently upgraded to Google Starbucks wifi.    It is also a very big store with plenty of shopping mall parking.   It might console a few of the aggrieved that the Laurel Heights upgrade doesn't include decent wifi.   The Dublin store is probably the closest Starbucks with both late night hours and fast wifi that you can actually park at for unlimited amounts of time as well.\n\n(And actually, since the Dublin store is larger than the Laurel Heights store AND has Google wifi AND has vastly more parking...I'd rate that Starbucks higher.   But like the Laurel Heights store, it is also tends to get packed with people day and night, ...students and mall goers, but fewer homeless).\n\nNot sure what commenter \"Amir\" was smoking when he reviewed, but Laurel Heights has quite a few homeless camped out there most of the time.   Police are frequently called in to roust them as they try to sleep on the couches in the evening.   There is also a loud schizophrenic who often tries to hang there, but he shouts out scary stuff so the police are usually called in to boot him as well.   But he always returns.   The homeless problem in fact is likely one of the main reasons for the remodel....so the baristas can monitor both entrances and all the seating more easily.   The expansion in seating is, by comparison, minor, and by itself would not make much of a dent in the seating issue.", "author": "Trevor C."}

Parking is ample, whether it be on the street or in the rear parking lot, so kudos for that.  Just don't bank on always being able to find a seat; they've probably tried to arrange everything so they can maximize the number of chairs and seats, but it can still get tough because of its popularity.\n\nThe baristas are cool, and they've never messed up with any of my drinks.

So we approached her and she didn't even give us the chance to think as she immediately said, \"What do you want?\" in the sassiest attitude. I asked my mom first and my mom's not sure so she says never mind and as this is happening i see WANDA straight UP roll her eyes at my mom.

And the phone navigator sent me to the Starbucks on 19th...right before closing.  Ok.  Where is the more coffee at this time of night?\n\nStarbucks in the Laurel Village center!  That's where!  \n\nThis 24 hour establishment is a ringer for late night coffeeshop needs.  Parking is obviously, very easy because it's the only place in the shopping center open at a late hour.  Validated parking is during the day, FYI.  Don't forget to get your validation stamp!  There's a back door on the lot that funnels you to the front counter and you don't have to walk all the way around in inclement weather.  (Not that it's that far of a walk.  It is on the corner after all.)\n\nBecause I usually feel like a pilgrim in an unholy land just out of my need for coffee and landing in a Starbucks, I never notice anything else other than just getting my coffee and getting out of these places.  However, my partner in crime pointed out this snazzy contraption behind the glass called a Clover coffee maker.  Upon further questioning, the barista tells us its a bit like an inverted french press.  (Apparently, been around a few years.  But really, it's a Stanford-engineered, vacuum, inverted, French press thingy.  $11k a unit.  But who's keeping score?)  I'll try anything other than that cigarette pack flavored swill percolating in the tank for who knows how long!  We got two of these Clover coffees, different flavors.\n\nWatching them perform the elaborate operation to make a single cup was entertaining.  A whole lot of stirring, filtering, vacuuming, etcetera for a single cup.  If you're in a hurry, get your frapp\u00e9-thing and just go. Turns out, this stuff isn't half bad.  Definitely a smoother, more flavored cup of java.  Not overly bitter.  Really changed my paradigm of Starbucks.  Later, a realization was made that the recommended flavor of one of the cups was the most expensive on the list!  Hey I don't care.  Good job barista!  Doin' your job makin' a sale!\n\nOther store details:  \nIt's clean inside...blah blah blah.  Sell tons of coffee stuff.  I definitely don't like the fact that there's table campers almost everywhere here all the time, making it hard to get a seat or a comfy seat or sofa by a window.  It's a real turn off for me because that clearly means there's not a lot of rotation going on for folks that want to drink coffee and interact with other human beings.  People even fall asleep at tables!  It looks more like a university computer lab in here than a coffeeshop.  You just got to watch like a hawk and strike when you see a seat open up.\n\nWithout a doubt, it's got to be the safest place in town as many of the local law enforcement community stop in on a frequent basis.\n\nOh little Clover machine, how I miss you...", "author": "Marty S."}

And there's even an area of comfy brown leather couches for socializing over by the window.  \n\nWhat makes this Starbucks location a little bit nicer than average?  Well, for one there's FREE PARKING in a generally-crowded parking lot behind the building.  And this location feels very ROOMY, well-laid-out.  It's clean, efficiently run by friendly staff, and there are no bums lounging around on the furniture spreading bed bugs.

What makes this Starbucks any different from every other one out there? A $12,000 piece of coffee machinery set to send any engineer or coffee geek into a tizzy. \n\nSo in the window, there's this sign that promotes \"Clover.\" Thinking it had something to do with tea, I ignored it for the most part. Then the barista asked if I'd like just a regular cup of the house blend OR (pointing in the direction of this exclusive looking contraption) \"a Clover cup.\" Regardless of the cost, I had to know what the Clover thing entailed, so $2.95 later, I watched on as she pulled the 100% Kona beans out of a plastic container, measured them into a small tin, ground them up fresh to order, dropped them in the top of this Clover brewing system and watched as a stainless steel filter lowered my grind into the brew chamber. Hot water (at exactly 180 degrees) poured into my brew and not before long, I had a fresh cup of crazy good coffee.\n\nI'm just as pretentious as the next Californian when it comes to individualized drip coffee, but Starbucks just took a sleek, geeked-out approach to what a place Blue Bottle does best: serving you freshly ground coffee at the peak of its flavor.", "author": "Monica S."}

They are usually spot-on with espresso varieties (specifically, the male baristas); I don't recall having a drink that was meant for someone with and uber-sweet tooth. If you're someone that likes the exorbitant amounts of flavoring, then the Fillmore location will do you just right. This place also has the clover-brewing system. I don't claim to have fine-tuned palette for coffee so I'm not exactly sure if it lives up to the hype, but the machine is sleek and shiny so it must be awesome right?\n\nAn added bonus is that it's open for 24hrs minus the 3 hours on Mondays 1am-4am, I believe. This place usually filled with students and cops (I like to think of this place as a police station that serves coffee) Like other reviews have said, it's extremely difficult to find a seat at certain times, but there is usually something open. The way to get the \"perfect seat\" is to just take what you can get, then upgrade as the day/night goes on(I guess this could be said about a lot of things in life haha). Figure out the best times to come yourself...\n\nThe lines seems to be at its worst right when the high schoolers come, which is could take about 8-10min to receive your order; other than that, the wait time seems to be on par with other busy coffeeshops.\n\nAll things considered, this place is better than the average Starbucks.", "author": "Carmelo D."}

His immediate response was you don't have to. Thanks. But I insisted because it is an honor for me to write this review for Keith. \n\nThis is why:\n\n1) Keith's presence makes Starbucks in Laurel Village a unique coffee drinking experience. He greets you with his charming smile and kind eyes making you feel you've come over to his house for coffee! I used to think Keith was the owner of that Starbucks exactly because of his warm hospitality.\n\n2) A friend of mine once said the experience of drinking coffee mainly comes from your company not the quality of the coffee. That is why I highly recommend Keith to open up his own coffee business. Even if Keith sells coffee grown in his backyard, I am sure he will be successful, knowing the way he makes people feel loved and welcomed.\n\n3) From my observations of Keith's interactions with young, old, hurried, loud, ill, disabled, anxious, funny, talkative, quiet, man, woman, gay, straight, rich, poor, tall, short etc. customers at Starbucks, I can attest to the many roles Keith has played for folks, as well as a barista. His roles include a social worker, counselor, coach, lover!, listener, nurse, nap police, comedian, an interested audience when no one else is watching, and a childhood friend.\n\n4) I wouldn't be surprised that the reason the laurel Heights Starbucks is packed even at odd hours like 3 am is because of Keith's reputation. Other coffee shops including other Starbucks in the neighborhood must have experienced the disappearance of their patrons as soon as Keith started his shift at the Laurel Heights Starbucks.", "author": "Joy J."}

Well, I don't know HOW my coworkers and other friends don't know this -- or maybe they know that there is no Peet's close to my office.  At any rate, I received a lot of Starbucks gift cards for Christmas.  So, this Sunday, after playing in the city, my family stopped in Laurel Village.  I got my coffee at Peet's and then we strolled down the long block (with stops at the Gymboree, bookstore, and 5 and dime along the way) to get kids' drinks for my little ones.  \n\nI have to admit that as much as I love Peet's, drinks for kids' are limited there:  milk, hot coco, orange juice.  That's it!  At Starbucks, there are several options: several fizzy drinks and juices (in addition to what Peet's carries).\n\nThis particular Starbucks is a gorgeous space, with glass tiles behind the counter and a comfy, yet upscale living room feel to the space.  In addition, it was well-staffed so the line moved very briskly -- two baristas, two ringers, and one floater who took the order before we paid.  \n\nSo I don't mind stopping by for drinks for my kids as long as I get my Peet's fix first.", "author": "Patty W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-01-13", "description": "I'm writing to complain about an experience at this Starbucks late one evening  around 12:30 a.m. There was nowhere to sit when I arrived. The store was filled with mostly students who were studying for exams. Some students had moved furniture so they could sit side by side which was strange to see walking in. I should have just left when I realized it was that time of year since it is always like that around exams at this particular location. But, I ordered a coffee and a pastry and found a makeshift seating arrangement that was probably abandoned by some other student that had placed a regular seating chair at the end of the bar like area in the store. Moments later someone left a regular table so I prepared to move, but as I was sitting down I saw a disabled couple who also wanted to sit there and I just let them take the table because I thought that was the right thing to do. \n\nMeanwhile, this other chair in the front of the store was available so I sat there instead. Wow, I wish I did not do that! Sitting directly across from me was a homeless looking person who was sound asleep with no beverage or anything in sight. And I was already irritated because of all the students leaching off and slowing the wifi connection, some of whom also did not buy anything. But it wasn't until I saw the person seated next to me inhale a white substance that I thought was cocaine that I asked to talk to the Manager on Duty. While I was waiting for the Manager, who was not on the sales floor for whatever reason, the associate I talked to saw this person inhaling whatever it was that they were inhaling. The Manager appeared a few minutes later and apologized, said he would call the police, and offered nothing else. I reiterated that I was not satisfied and at my urging he gave me coupon, or gift card, or something for a free drink. I was fine with that at the moment but was pretty surprised by what happened next. The police came and escorted the drug user or person who was inhaling something out of the store. And at the same time, I should mention that the other two homeless people seated in the same area were still sound-asleep. I thought to myself well, at least I did something and I felt fine. \n\nBUT THEN- the other homeless looking person who was escorted out by the police returns to the store! AND- it gets even better, the Manager then apologizes to him and offers him a free drink or refill??!  I was dumbfounded and frankly, shocked that this is how it was being handled. But then again, I seemed to be the only person bothered by it. I decided to just leave since I did not feel comfortable and talked to the Manager again before I left because I didn't want to seem like the bad person involved. There was no line but at one point someone else appeared and I casually said something like \"wouldn't you be weirded out if someone sitting next to you snorts a white substance that looks like cocaine?\" in their direction. That other person obviously had no idea what I was talking about and said nothing and then the Manager acted as if I was being confrontational. Maybe I was, I don't think so, but I probably should not have even involved some other random person. Regardless, I've experienced many weird situations living in San Francisco as long as I have, but this has got to be the weirdest I have ever experienced inside a Starbucks! \n\nI sympathize for the homeless people in the store but they should not be allowed to just occupy space inside a Starbucks without buying anything and likewise, using drugs or inhaling substances should not be allowed in any store, Starbucks or not. The Manager was friendly and said he could do nothing beyond what he already did which I believe is mostly true. I think apologizing and offering a free refill to a homeless person who is inhaling substances, cocaine or not is a little strange but I get it that his actions were limited. The store doesn't have security and after all, I appeared to be the only person bothered by this anyway. Most everyone else was oblivious and plugged into whatever device they were using. Surprisingly the most observant people in the store were the disabled couple I mentioned. They appeared to be hearing impaired as they were communicating using American Sign Language. I only know a few words in ASL but could definitely understand the shrug and eye roll that we exchanged as I was leaving.\n\nI don't know what the answer is or what Starbucks can do about this, but something needs to be done and I know for certain that what happened that evening is not the right thing.", "author": "L.

Schulz\nFounder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President\nStarbucks Corporation\n2401 Utah Avenue South\nSeattle, Washington 98134\n\n Re: Starbucks Stock\n\nDear Mr. Schulz:\n\n I am a shareholder of Starbucks stock and am writing you in an attempt to understand why my investment has lost over half of its value in less then two years.  Let me start by saying I purchased your stock because I was a longtime consumer of your product.  I enjoyed the coffee and the atmosphere that Starbucks offered.  After some financial research I thought it wise to invest in your company.  \n\n At that time Starbucks was not only selling coffee and teas but also divesting into the compact disc market and selling refrigerated drinks in grocery stores.  Starbucks even had a coffee store in China's Forbidden City (quite a feat!).\n\n Since April 2006, when I invested in your company the stock has done nothing but drop.  I've included a chart in case you needed a visual.  It's gotten so bad that when I see the stock only slip 5 or 10 cents on a given day I think it's a victory.\n\n Now, you've just lost a lawsuit requiring you to pay $100 million in back tips to your employees.  I don't normally make a habit of writing letters to the CEO's of a company I own stock in, but in this case I've made an exception.  I need my voice to be heard and I can no longer sit on the proverbial sidelines and watch this company dump my investment.  \n\nWhat are you going to do to turn this around?  Tell me; what future plans do you have that will right this sinking coffee company.  \n\nOr should I just sell what little of my investment is left and join the growing membership of those dissatisfied with big corporate business. If that is ultimately what happens I can tell you that there will be no more of the proverbial sideline for me, I will be vocal, but not for you.  \n\nThank you for your time in reading this letter and I would appreciate a response. \n\n\nRegards,\n\nChris G. \nShareholder\n\nSo let's all go somewhere else for coffee now!! \n\nWho's with me!! hehee", "author": "Chris G."}

There is no excuse for cutting down the forest, building a coffee plantation, fertilizing/ pesticiding (petro chemicals) and use a fossil fuels to ship the stuff half way around the world so you can drink it.  You don't need coffee!  You could drink water.  With that said, I don't believe in that global warming hogwash, so I can enjoy my drink of choice.  If I see you there, I'll know you don't care about global warming too and we can toast to our fossil fuel SUV's with abandon or even worse the earth destroying Prius.  (read the down and dirty on the Prius here http://clubs.ccsu.edu/recorder/editorial/print_item.asp?NewsID=188)  \n\nSo many coffee/ tea houses burn the crap out of the tea leaves with too hot water, or by leaving the bags in for a long period of time (yes I could stick my fingers in and yank the bag or the  melted straws used to dangle the bag out but it's too frakking hot and messy.)  All these practices used by these big liberal-progressive-democrat-supporting-ozone-destroying-global-warming-multinational-corporations like Starbucks make the tea become bitter.  These liberal progressive multinationals are too busy trying to make money pushing out 3-4 buck latts to the clients who are destroying the planet to use proper tea making protocol for the low profit margin drinks like the more earth friendly teas.  So it may your tea weak like the science behind global warming, but yank the tea out of the cup quick or you will become bitter like AL Gore.\n\nMeg says the coffee here is acceptable but prefers Peets.   I don't particularly prefer the tea here, but I do appreciate the clean nice atmosphere.  The great muffins and breakfast sandwiches (soon to be ax'd?) make this a decent choice for a breakfast alternative to a sit down restaurant.   The kids and I don't like the hot coco here as it's more bitter-grainy euro-styled than American (funny that I prefer my chocolate euro styled but hot-coco American.)

This Starbucks is all of the above with the added plus of being open 24 hours.  No matter how hard I try, my circadian rhythm just peaks late at night.  Therefore, I appreciate establishments open late because there are so few.\n\nThe crowd is a conglomeration of people.

You wouldn't want to come here during the day anyway due to the crawling children, would-be soccer moms, and geriatrics. At night, it isn't much better. Depending on the day of week, the place is either crawling with wannabe mafioso Russians, students slaving away with their heads in books, drunk people post-club, or slackers absorbing the free internet.\n\nAnother problem with this Starbucks is due to the fact it's late night hang-out central to some, it's a feat finding some place to sit past 7PM. If you manage to find a seat inside, better have a friend to save your spot if you need to piss. There are benches outside, but beware if you're not a smoker. The spit and butts will no doubt disgust you.\n\nGiven how close this Starbucks is to my house (far closer than the quiet, empty, lots of parking 24hr Serramonte Starbucks), I frequent this place often enough to know who works there at night. All the night/early morning baristas are nice and no one I know has ever had a drink order messed up.\n\nIf you're already on this side of the city, really need coffee at 3AM and don't want to pay the booth-minimum at Video Cafe, head here.

No easy parking on weekdays if you happen to drive a car from out of area. Now, as a work-from-coffee-place veteran I feel entitled to have some strong opinions about which of those are good spots. My first impression of this one - a coffee factory. High traffic levels. People fighting for a place to grab and work. Pretty descent infrastructure, though. Lots of sockets (unfortunately a major consideration for someone working on media intense, lousy-battery life laptop). Coffee - a matter of taste, but definitely plenty in your immediate reach. Food - never found the Starbucks food appealing. Bottom line - one does not go to Starbucks for food. I don't.

I tried the Ethopian and it was delightful!\n\nI like the fact that this coffee location is a 24 hour site and that the neighborhood is central to many medical facilities.  The scones are scrumptious especially the vanilla and maple scones.\n\nI happened to notice that this Starbucks also offers a breakfast sandwich and coffee, which I think is a good idea at a coffee site.  They also have items for lunch and for snacks too.  \n\nI would like them to expand the number of microwave cups that they sell so that the customers who want microwave cups in large sizes will have more of a visual selection of ceramics to choose from. Last time I was in there I purchased the large brown Starbuck Mug with the company name on it.\n\nThe seating in this coffee location is really great, you can spread out or choose to be by yourself.

Your only option is to have them individually brew a cup of decaf for more money. No more Starbucks for me. Peet's is only a short walk.", "author": "Doug H."}

The comfortable chairs, and Carmen Lundy music really sets the mood. Order something extravagant with a pseudo-name, and you will be pleasantly suprised. Look for the cute barista with candy cane striped socks, and one rolled up pant leg. Beware of the one with blonde hair, tatoos, and black rimmed glasses, he may look cute but really he is a grumpy mini-frap server that interrogates you for laughing at the funny banana flavored mini-fraps. He hates his job, and you, in turn hate him.", "author": "Bethany D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-07-17", "description": "First off I am a big Starbucks fan.  I like great coffee and for the most part Starbucks delivers the quintessential American Coffee experience as well as the lifestyle that is sold to the customer.  That is fine with me.  I am not a coffee snob and for what they do they have a good product....for the most part.  There is a reason they are on every street corner.  This Starbucks in particular is what you would expect in this neighborhood...busy...crowded...and full of rich people and their children.  Fine with me, what else do you expect from a Starbucks in Laurel Heights, 24 hour Starbucks nonetheless.  The only problem I have with the Starbucks corporation is the inconsistency in drink making.  You never really know if you are going to get a good drink or not when you go in.  Made correctly you get a good product, but that probability is 50/50.  Most of the time their blended drinks aren't blended enough and for the coffee drinks you get a lot of burnt milk, for that I give it 3 stars.", "author": "matt g."}

If you were supposed to do something all day but didn't come here and work until you hate your life.  I must warn you this place may be run by the yakuza b/c I see a lot of them in here.  The breakfast sandwiches taste like the box a frozen pizza comes in.  Sometimes they play decent music which is scary or my taste sucks.", "author": "Dirk C."}
