My roommates and I came around 8pm on a weeknight and there were a couple of large groups as well as a few smaller parties - clearly a go-to spot for many.\n\nWe ordered a bruschetta to start with, and then decided to share the Fettuccini Alfredo and Gnocchi Alla Sorrentina. The bruschetta was pretty standard and made for a great appetizer. The gnocchi was a little too chewy for my taste and the sauce was watery and didn't seem to blend very well with the dish. The fettuccini, however, was perfect. The noodles were al dente, and the sauce was just buttery enough. Most restaurant alfredo sauce is too heavy and creamy, but this one was light and authentic and felt like comfort food. I would come back just for that.\n\nThe atmosphere is bright and relaxing, and the place, while classy, has a family-friendly vibe that makes it comfortable.", "author": "Apoorva A."}

I ordered the Risotto of the Day, which was a Portobello Mushroom Risotto topped with Parmesan.  The flavor was incredible and I love mushroom risotto in general. It also included some asparagus pieces, which I appreciated, since I felt a little lacking in vegetables. But, it was utterly disappointing that the risotto was not cooked completely through. I understand that sometimes people cook risotto more al dente. But, this did not qualify as al dente.  The arborio rice was hard at the core and almost crunchy. It clearly did not have enough time to break down and give you the right creamy and smooth risotto quality. I know risotto is hard to do, but for an Italian restaurant that called this dish one of the specials of the day, I was very disappointed.", "author": "Jess Y."}

Via Veneto is nestled away between rows of condos and apartments about a mily from the hustle and bustle of Union Square. It provides a quite intimate setting that separates you from the noise of downtown SF. When you initally walk in thre is a small upstairs seating area and open kitchen. When you decend down a rather steep staircase, you find yourself in the main dinning room, which is dimly lit with white table clothes an old Italian decor. \n\nWe were seated right away and our waiter greeted us with fresh bread and oil and vinegar dipping sauce. \n\nWe decided to share a few things. Below is what we tried\n\n-Soup of the day. Creamy tomato bisue-This was excellent. Creamy and rich\n-Beet Salad- Very good. Beets can be a bit overpowering, but this salad was great. \n-Caesar Salad- Tradition Caesar.\n-Traditional pasta with tomato cream sauce-I cannot remember the name of the exact dish, and endless menu searches didn't ring a bell. The best I can do is describe it as a traditional pasta noodles in a tomato cream sauce with spices. It was very good with tons of flavor.\n-Margarita Pizza- Very good, and just the right size to share\n-Tiremusi- Excellent and home made\n-Salted Carmel Gelato with espresso and biscotti-Probably one of the best desserts I have had to date\n\nOur waiter was friendly and attentive and provided excellent service all around.

I wasn't sure how much it would cost but it was only $2 more. Great deal! The calamari with shrimp was also very good. I also really liked the bread because it's not the typical oil and balsamic, they do roasted garlic. My bf got the Sacottino (large pasta pouches filled with lobster) and shrimp and asparagus.

On a Friday evening, there was no wait for a table and the restaurant was half full. It's a small place and they had just one server attending to all the tables. That server was either drunk or ambivalent. He was huffing and puffing as he bused tables. Throwing bread here, a glass there, and  in general, completely in disarray. We had to wait a long time to be attended to and getting his attention was near impossible. The waiter who helped with water seemed disinterested in helping us when we wanted a second glass of wine and we could not get our server's attention. Our glasses remained empty for a long time. Perhaps the worse thing was that he served one of our friends a soda drink that had expired!! It tasted really bad and off and when we checked the date and informed the server, he seemed nonchalant about it, claiming that that was not the expiration date in reality. No apologies were offered. No drinks on the house as a way of customer service. If the food had been top notch, I think I would have forgiven all the above. But the food reminded me of olive garden. And I have nothing against olive garden. But there the prices match the food. Here, we are paying for prime real estate. \nAll in all, avoid. There are some fantastic Italian places to eat in SF very close by. Our fav is Bella Trattoria on geary. You won't be disappointed there!!", "author": "J S."}

Nice mix of regulars and first time visiting patrons. \n\nPortions are moderate to large, and well-priced. You can get a massive bowl of pasta for $19.

The glass was 80% gin and was served alongside a small bottle of Mediterranean tonic, a nice touch!\n\nWe ordered:\n\nBeef carpaccio. Beef was so thin and so delicious. generously topped with fresh grated parmesan and capers. We put a little garlic olive oil served with our bread on it for further flavor augmentation.\n\nShrimp with marsala wine, mushrooms, tomatoes, and green onions. Served alongside a vegetable medley and well cooked flash fried potatoes. A lighter dish, but very good. Shrimp were very slightly overcooked but large and fresh tasting.\n\nThe Chilean sea bass special. So good. Fish was so soft. You dont need a butter knife or a fork to cut it. You could use something as dull as a rolling pin and you'd still cut it perfectly. The sauce was lemon,garlic, white wine but very light. Not thick in texture or super buttery. \n\nCreme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Pretty good but you could tell it was prepared in the morning. Great vanilla flavor but a little custardy.\n\nWith a glass of wine, that gin with a side of tonic and all the food above, we escaped for just $85.

Immediate seating (and a former coworker's recommendation) is a reason to eat at a restaurant, but not necessarily the best one.

The d\u00e9cor is fairly nice and the dinner crowd seemed to be a little more well to do (probably from the area).

My family is Italian and we have spent countless 2-3 hour dinners at Italian restaurants over the years. We have a big chaotic family and everyone likes to talk... luckily most Italian restaurants get it and never try to hurry us. My family does \"Sunday Dinner\" but when I moved up to San Francisco I found myself missing our weekly family dinners and wanting to still go out for some comfort food on Sunday nights even if without them. \n\nI had walked by Via Veneto numerous times and it's charm had appealed to me. It doesn't have the \"trendy/modern\" decor of most San Francisco restaurants, in the best way. It's authentic, home-y, and truly Italian. So one night, with some pushing & encouragement over text from my brother, I decided to venture out to Via Veneto all by myself. I had never really dined by myself but I put my Kindle in my purse and walked into the restaurant trying to hide how petrified and nervous I felt for this new social experience. They instantly made me feel at home with their Italian accents and warm, gracious greetings. [Huge sigh of relief from me.] I think they could sense my nervousness and when asked what table I wanted, he jokingly offered to put me right in the window. I requested a small table in the back and he took me right to the table. Now is the point at which I learned going out to eat by yourself as a woman is great- the best service you will ever get! :) \n\nI always get the gnocchi (my favorite!) and have also had good wine here. The bruschetta is delicious as is the tiramisu. The tiramisu is perfectly fresh and light as it should be, not soggy. My family can be quite critical of Italian desserts and Via Veneto is authentic.\n\nI have since been back many times including take out and am always greeted with the same warmth. I hadn't been there in a while recently and when I stopped in they were so happy to see me, asked where I had been, and took care of me while I waited for my order. I always get the sense that most of the other customers are longtime regulars and this is a gem in the neighborhood.", "author": "Amanda M."}

The staff here serving the table are very knowledgeable about their menu. We must have asked the staff about 10 different dishes and they described them perfectly. Our waiter said he had been working at the restaurant for 12 years which was pretty impressive. We asked what he recommended. He gave us a few dishes. I ended up getting lobster sacottino, one of the special dishes of the night, and my lady friend ended up getting the Gamberi Al Diavolo. My dish was a lighter dish. Came with a wine butter sauce which was not bad and was topped with shrimp. Inside the noodle pouches was a lobster spread. Was good but not my dish of preference. I'll probably go back and try something with a cream sauce next time. My lady friends dish was a little more tasty. She asked for tortellini instead of vegetables. Definitely liked her dish more.

Hint: being 1/2-full on a Saturday night when you're located right on Fillmore isn't a good sign...  \n\nIt took over 10 minutes until anyone even came over to fill our water glasses and bring us bread - and the bread by the way was cold, stale, and personality-less. Another 10 until my dad's drink was brought (in a pink and purple paint-penned \"birthday girl\" martini glass, no joke) and our order was taken. \n\nService aside, I've had better food at Olive Gardens. The salads had bland, watery dressings and were served with hard, tasteless tomatoes (ok, I'll take some heat for ordering tomatoes in the winter - but if you're going to put them on your menu, at least ensure they're ripened before serving). My parents ordered linguine with clam sauce; the clams were fine; the sauce was a thin, flavorless broth. My lasagna was drowning in a creamy tomato sauce that wasn't worth the calories.\n\nAs for people claiming that it's reasonably priced, sure it's not expensive, but you can get infinitely better dishes of pasta for the ~$20/plate they charge. My overall take: I'd be embarrassed to be a native Italian (which the owner is) serving such mediocre Italian food.", "author": "Sara L."}

You expect a face-lifted society matron wrapped in mink to come in with a gigolo named Paolo. Yeah, it has that Dean Martin feel about it, especially with the unctuously congenial waiter and the unadventurous menu. I came here with my friend Maggie who lives in Pac Heights, and she loves the place. I can see why since the food is very nicely presented, but I have to admit I left something less than satisfied. The ho-humness must have gotten to me after all. \n\nMaggie ordered the $15 Spaghetti al Gamberi, which was tossed with fresh prawns, a little garlic and plenty of olive oil (see photo). I had a taste of it, and it was good enough, just kinda boring. I went for the equally somnambulant Scalloppine al Limone ($16.50), which were veal medallions sauteed in white wine, lemon, capers and garlic. The veal was certainly tender enough, and it was not too lemony, the downfall of many a family-run trattoria. But the blandness factor was setting in, and I started thinking why a restaurant so dedicated to presenting traditional cuisine couldn't take more of a risk in the execution. \n\nThe one surprise was actually the $10 Insalata Caesar for Two, which promised a \"tangy\" dressing (see photo for one serving). It actually was because it was not turned into the creamy globbiness one expects at a restaurant. Instead, the zinginess of the lemon made for a lighter taste that was most welcome after a hefty bread basket. The place gets crowded quickly, and they do squeeze as many tables as possible together, so watch those elbows. By the time the meal ended, I have to admit I was somewhat relieved to be out of the place. The irony is that they didn't do anything wrong. They just didn't bother to delight me. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...traditional Italian fare done well and with next to no surprises except that Caesar salad \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...Dean Martin would be here every night if he wasn't dead \nSERVICE - 3 stars...unctuous and perfunctory but with an accent \nTOTAL - 3 stars...I think it's back to North Beach for me", "author": "Ed U."}

Forget the ambience, I already know this place is considered foofy, but I don't go for the atmosphere, I go for my palate!\n\nBefore lunch, I looked at the menu online because I needed to watch my calories. Ha, go figure. So I get there fantasizing of a caprese salad and I copy one of the doctor's entree and end up ordering  a grilled salmon with tomato slices and basil. My mouth is watering. \n\nIt was beautiful when it arrived. I had to take a picture. I mean, yeah, we all know what a nice salmon looks like, but come on, it was for Yelp purposes. It looked so beautiful paired up with the bright red tomato slices and the rich, green basil leaves, accented with a nice pop of yellow lemon! I squeezed the hell outta that lemon onto my whole dish, sprinkled some salt on those bad boys and ate like a sophisticated woman, all dainty and *ish because I needed to be professional.\n\nIt was so nice taking in all the flavors of the fish and the vegetables. It was delectable. It took most of my energy not to scarf it all down, that plus there were only a few slices of tomato. If I were at home, those tomatoes would be gone in a split second.\n\nIt was excellent; salmon was moist and beautifully seasoned. Heathy and delicious. Ah, I'm so proud of myself. \n\nThe service that everyone talks about on Yelp (being that it's crappy and stuff), I didn't experience today. I was on radar for it because that's all I read on the reviews. Then again, the dental school is a major patron of the restaurant and since we had a reservation, perhaps we got special treatment?

There's only a couple of places like this left round these parts: tasty, friendly, reasonably priced and not part of the scene.\n\nMassimo owns the place, he and his restaurant have been there for thousands of years.  Among the understated decorations are some huge wine bottles and, in the back, a U.S. flag that was flown over the capitol accompanied by a plaque signed by a unit of Marines.  Somewhere hidden behind the bar is a photo with Massimo and Robert De Niro - not being served, not eating; just hanging out.\n\nIt took about two months before girlfriend and I were sick of Fillmore Street's other options: uninspired Mexican, gourmet Vientameese street food, \"free range, grass fed, sun tanned, oxygen treated, humanely fried, organically slaughtered, omega-3\" CONSTANTLY OVERCOOKED PIZZA (yeah, I'm looking at you, Del Fina on California Street).  Blah, blah, blah.  Just give me a thoughtfully prepared cream sauce with fresh ingredients and portions large enough to pack a small snack for later.\n\nRecommended specials: Lobster ravioli or lamb shanks (I think it was in a sherry reduction).  Start with an insalata Via Veneto (they are generous w/ the dressing so order it on the side if you want it light) and split the calamari with someone.

Pleasant late 1980's decor. Wait staff is mostly friendly, sometimes uneven, but ultimately, professionalism reigns.  It is rarely loud (weekends excepted) and one can be an individual human being here. Alone or with a group. There is no annoying canned music. You can get carpaccio.  The food is dependable.  I repeat.  The food is  98% dependable. I didn't say it will make the top 100 restaurants in SF.  If you order right, it's good. The strongest items are fish specials and traditional bologneses, meat balls, lasagna, sometimes ravioli.   Don't expect pizza. And it is reasonably priced.  You pay  a fair price for what you get.  All ages and various walks of life come here, though it is preferred by the over 50 set.  \n\nThe minestrone has saved me, body and soul, more times than I care to think.  It's simple.\nThe wines are at least decent, always.  Not spectacular, though perhaps by the bottle, and there is a substantial wine list.  Which is kind of all around how it is--not spectacular, but wonderful in its own way which is a minor miracle in this recently benighted  town.  \n\nReasons not to come here: the reasons not  to come here might be the same reasons  for others  to come here. This is not a top tier gastronomic experience, so don't expect that. Americans rush rush rush at meals and Europeans do not. A number of reviews complain about slow service here, but I don't find that a problem at all, since I can't stand America.  But you might.    The menu hasn't changed in 20 years, and some ingredients are on the cheap-ish side.   Which you may like or not like.  As far as authentic, well, the owner is Italian, so in a sense the food is authentic, but as an example, at times quick rice rather than arborio is used for the risotto, so if you are a stickler snob about Italian food, nota bene.  Lovely olive oil and garlic, but so so bread. Vegetables are uninspired.  Tomatoes always under-ripe.  Personally, I wouldn't come here  for a special night out--but I come here for daily fare.  New customers or certain favored  regulars seem to be treated with more consideration at times, by some unique formula.  If you want to be coddled by wait staff, forget it. \n\nVia Veneto is either your kind of place or it's not. It is my kind of  place, most of the time.", "author": "harmonia b."}

Our normal go-to spot, Jackson-Fillmore, was completely booked.  Luckily, I remembered that there was another Italian restaurant just a few blocks down.  We walked in and were immediately greeted with open arms by the boisterous owner (I wish I could remember his name).\n\nHe sat us at the large corner table and personally waited on us.  He asked all about us, where we were from, what we did, etc.  A very bold man, if you will.  He made us feel like regulars.\n\nThe bruschetta was great, as were the stuffed mushrooms which were complimentary since we were first-timers.  The Gorgonzola Gnocchi was out of this world.  Light, airy dumplings covered in a rich coating of gorgonzola cream.  One of the best pasta dishes I have had in some time.  The wine list is pretty extensive as well, but our trusty new friend made the appropriate selections.\n\nWhen we returned a few weeks later, he knew exactly who we were, what we had ordered prior, and where we sat.

I was visiting Pacific Heights, and decided to stop in. The food is fresh, and cooked in a very homestyle fashion. The atmosphere is casual and friendly, often getting more noisy into the late evening hours (7pm-9pm). When I was seated, I was given some bruschetta--which was fresh and flavorful. I ordered the veal with lemon, which was yummy. On my second visit, I ordered the lobster ravioli. I recommend the lobster ravioli since it is served with a rich cream sauce and calamari. The wine selection is great, and Massimo is a wonderful host. During my second visit, I brought the chefs some of my homemade Tiramisu. In return, I was given a glass of Limoncello. If you get a chance, have David make you a cappucino...it's wonderful! If you are looking for great service and homestyle Italian food, give Via Veneto a visit.", "author": "Anastacia S."}

I had a bite of the bruschetta (yum!) before joining them.  Wines by the glass were $9-10, and I had a good malbec.\n\nOn a random Thursday night ~6pm, the restaurant was pretty empty but it made for easier conversation. Service was fairly attentive, and they start you off with good bread with a super yummy garlic oil dipping sauce!\n\nPrices are VERY reasonable for Fillmore -- $12ish for pasta, closer to $20 for the entrees.  \n\nI had the special of the day - porcini mushroom ravioli ($15), served in a gravy-like sauce with bits of asparagus and mushroom. It was SO good, I couldn't stop eating! I appreciated how the portion was sizable, unlike other Italian places were sometimes you just get one or two ravioli (sometimes I joke that it should be singular - just raviolus).  There were probably 7-8 large (maybe 2in x 2in) raviolis on my plate, and of course I ate it all (MOO!).  My coworkers had the special risotto of the day with prawns (also looked very good) and halibut special (served in a red sauce).\n\nOverall, it was a great meal, good service, and fairly reasonably priced for the area.", "author": "Karen S."}

It's been a while since I had eaten here and decided to take a friend from out of town for a nice dinner. IT was bustling to start with and we were shown seats right at the very back, inspite of making reservations. The place was chaotic and nobody showed up to take orders for a long time, while we sat sipping iced water.\n\nWe ordered stuffed mushrooms for starters which lacked flavor. My friend ordered the Prawn Risotto and I ordered the mushroom Ravioli with asparagus in white wine sauce (also on the specials). Frankly, it was horrible. The Ravioli seemd something made from the instant super-market packet and the white wine sauce was watery and thin. My friend's Risotto was dry and he felt he could make better Risotto himself.\n\nWe skipped dessert and ordered espressos. When the arrived, my friend who is a coffee connoisseur was aghast that they lacked the brown film (which I learnt is essential to good espresso). We sent it back and they came back with the \"real\" version.\n\nAll in all - major disappointment in every possible way.

I am vegetarian and have tried most of their veggie pasta dishes, which tasted OK but are invariably too salty, creamy and/or oily.  In fact, recently I had their gnocchi all florentina, which had way too much cream sauce, as well as their fettucine alla norma, which was drowning in oil.  Both dishes were too salty as well.

Unfortunately, the one and only time I was at Via Veneto (for...wait for it...boyfriend's mom's birthday...), I was seized with anxiety and in the throes of a panic attack for the duration of what ended up being about a three hour meal, including appetizers and dessert. If you're not well-versed in the specifics of social anxiety disorders, you may not know that when one is gripped with fear and anxiety for no apparent reason at all, one finds it hard to salivate, let alone eat. Your mouth more or less dries up, your tongue shrivels to the back of your throat, and even getting down the beloved Jesus Juice becomes more a chore than a joy. \n\nThat said, I still give Via Veneto 4 stars. I know it's been a Boyfriend Family favorite (or at least Frequent) for some time and the little food I was able to force down and keep in was quite good. In fact, writing this has me jonesing for a repeat visit. The service is gracious, the prices are very reasonable, and everything from the appetizers to entrees to desserts was well presented. I just love the frilly, girly low-lit interior (this is the antithesis of hip and your mother will love it). Wine list is decent and markups aren't over the top.

It's not the BEST italian food in the world -- but it's definitely up there in the top 5.

And, it was overcooked with a bland sauce.\n\nI moved back to SF in April and living in Pacific Heights I have passed by Via Veneto several times. A few weeks back I walked in with my partner on a Saturday night at 9pm and was asked if I had reservations. It never occurred to me to make reservations at what seems like a neighborhood Italian joint, so we promptly left smirking and went to Jitlada for Thai. Last night we decided to try Via Veneto again since the bridge was closed for Labor Day and I figured they would be hurting for business. \n\nIt was empty. We were promptly seated by an unfriendly older waiter who spoke Italian to another older man. First thought - they're speaking Italian, this is going to be good.\n\nWrong. It was bland and unremarkable. The minestrone soup was decent, not great. The gnocchi was obviously not homemade and was over cooked. My little Italian grandmother made the world's best gnocchi, so I am something of a snob when it comes to this dish, but I expect it to be at least homemade and it should be firm, not mush. My partner had the mussels appetizer which was very fresh and the pasta puttanesca which was overly salty and a very small portion.\n\nHalf a carafe of wine for 12 dollars was a good deal, but I would not recommend this restaurant and will not go back. We should have gone to Jitlada again last night.", "author": "Marcia B."}

The environment is chatty, the staff is friendly and the food is simply delicious. \n\nThe first time I walked by the place, I just stop to practice my rusty italian with the owner. I didn't even eat there, just stopped to talk and my experience was so nice that the following week I went back to eat. \n\nA week later, I just stopped for a glass of wine with my Italian friends. It turned into appetizers and later into a full meal. Later I took my mom, an Italian food snob, and she loved it too.\n\nOpposite to most comments, my service has always been speedy, although I admit that they are not rushing it as they are more concerned about making you feel right at home.\n\nWhat to eat? The capresse salad and bruschetta are a good way to start.  The penne matriciana is amazing. The sword fish in a wine/lemon/caper sauce is to die for. The pasta with boar ragu is strong and tasty. But as Massimo pointed out, their specialty is the fish, so make sure to order one of the many seafood options.\n\nAs a tip, their house red wine is outstanding and you can order it by the half or full carafe. And yes, the pear dessert is as unforgettable as everybody says.\n\nIn conclusion, the service is like in Italy, if you demand it, you'll get it. The feeling is local, you will find a lot of regulars (me included) and the food is authentic and fairly price. If you are looking for a quiet place where to catch a bite before a movie, go somewhere else.

I was willingly to wait the hour, i mean its valencia st and there are a millions things to do to past the time, but my friends thought otherwise. \n\nNow we had to decide what we wanted to eat, so we spent 20mins sitting in the car debating where we should go next. If we had put ourselves on the waiting list at Dosa we could have been 20mins closer to eating at Dosa!\n\nSo we decided to head to the fillmore/pacific heights area, we parked and began our walk up fillmore street. Everyone was hungry and indecisive so i made an executive decision, the first place i saw that i thought would be good, and then i saw this place, looked pretty nice, wasn't too crowded and but it wasn't dead, and the wait....was non-existent.\n\nMy thoughts at first were..hmm...thats funny the cook is winking his eye at me and blowing me a kiss...i should be flattered..strangely i don't think i was, but moving on.\n\nWe were seated at this table in a corner but i was nice, my friend, Nicole and i said we felt like we were in a buffet at a vegas hotel because of the paintings on the wall. The Waiter was cool, not great, the owner was much cooler. It did surprise me though that they didn't have garlic bread, but maybe that just an americanized idea of Italian, that they all should serve garlic bread. We did however get some wonderful french bread.......hmm...with garlic and oil...so i guess thats kind of Italian.\n\nAnyway we order our food i order the Chicken Marasala, with this very tasty spinach and i hate spinach,but i loved that spinach, could it be it was drenched in garlic..i love garlic...so anything drenched in garlic, is a winner for me. My friend whom ordered the same thing wasn't the biggest fan. My other friend wayne got some oysters or mussels , something that had shells and he was not impressed,so i don't know if i would recommend those. \n\nSo as we are eating and in a walks a very strange looking made in a black trench coat, and all the sudden, i feel like i did when i first walked in the cook blew me a kiss,and winked at me, that feeling very-uneasy.And thats when the owner walked up to the table and any uneasiness i felt disappeared! \n\nThe owner makes you feel as though you are right home with his family back in his native Italy. He greets us with a grand hello in his thick Italy accent and a huge smile, He joked with us and was so grateful that we are there. \n\nI thought the food was good, but not exceptional, the service was ok,and the wait for a check was pretty long, the desert wasn't very good. I'm big on customer service so when the owner themselves comes to your table to greet its always a plus. True i would have preferred Dosa but i'm glad i checked this place out, i can't say  i'll be very soon, but i can say i will return at some point if i'm in that neighborhood.\n\nI'll just hope the cook doesn't recognize me, if and when i do return. There is just something about the cook blowing a kiss and winking at you that makes you feel like you are at a cafe in the middle of nowhere, in one of those campy b-movies where the teenagers get stranded.", "author": "Nia W."}

Odd, since the place was only about a quarter full and there were two waiters who were just wandering around the restaurant, doing nothing at all.  After we finally got seated, I noticed that pretty much everyone in the place was drunk, including some of the staff! Solo patrons downing a bottle of wine each, a drunk woman going in and out of the restaurant with a full, then less full wine glass and then conversing loudly with those seated near her.  The owner seemed kinda sauced as well, amusing.  Between ordering and receiving appetizers, the staffer who seated us asked if we'd like dessert menus.. haha...what?  \n\nI'm not a restauranteur, but I don't think that spaghetti + 4 shrimp + a little olive oil, black pepper, and rosemary should cost 15 bucks unless it's amazing.  And this dish was among the most amateur looking and tasting items I've ever had in any restaurant.  Pile o'bland, oily noodles, 4 overcooked shrimp, room temperature.  My girlfriend's chicken was pretty sub-par as well, and the vegetables accompanying the dish were a joke straight out of your grocer's frozen foods aisle.

It's not like the restaurant was crowded or anything, so I still can't figure out why that old cat who reminds me of Geppetto couldn't be more attentive. I might give them another try someday, but it's probably gonna take some serious 'Eye-talian' coaxing.", "author": "Gregor G."}

I continue to be impressed and satisfied with the class, quality and service of this restaurant. The owner/main waiter/sometimes bartender moves quickly through the ample dining room and bar, and the other person at the bar helps on the floor when needed. The food is wonderful. Last night, I had the special-salmon and halibut, with mixed vegetables and potatoes. The fish was poached and so tender and perfectly cooked. Although I've had the tiramisu on other occasions there, I passed on dessert this time around as I was contentedly full. My partner requested a dish not on the menu, which was a sort of variation of a dish on the menu. The owner/waiter was happy to accomodate, which is unusual in restaurants. I had a couple of glasses of wonderful Italian Barbera with my dinner, and my partner had the Chianti, both very nice representatives of the varietals they are made from. All in all, a fantastic experience which I am recommending to you for your pleasure. Located up on Fillmore Street across from the Clay Theatre, it's easy to get to as well.", "author": "daniel k."}

As mentioned by other reviewers, the owner takes a personal interest in your comfort and satisfaction.  The coffee was good, the food was nice (if a bit bland - my omelet needed salt) and the service was the best.  The price was nice, too, with our party averaging $12-13 for entree and coffee.

Their speciality is a rendition of Venetian cuisine that's a little different than your typical Italian place. They have several veal, chicken, and seafood choices - but no beef, pork, game, etc.\nThe attitude of the hostess was snobby - but we're kind of used to this living in Pacific Heights.\nWe kept hearing about what a great value Via is. Well, that is all relative. Yes, it's reasonable for the neighborhood. However, it's not especially cheap for Italian. The appetizers are in the $10 range, pastas run about $15-$17, entrees around $20.\nI had the clam and mussel appetizer in a simple white wine butter sauce. Excellent - some of the best I've had in SF. My friend had the Carpaccio and it was a HUGE disappointment. Yes, it's hard to imagine bad Carpaccio - but this tasted like it was shaved right off a frozen piece of beef. It had a disagreeable icy texture and bland flavor that really ruined what is usually a treat.\nThe pastas were very decent. They use a lot of garlic, which I don't consider a negative. I had a spaghetti with chopped , shrimp, and garlic in an olive oil sauce. My friend had the pasta with pancetta and ham in a tomato sauce. Both were flavorful and thankfully cooked perfectly al dente. The portions were sufficient, but on the smallish side for Italian. Without the appetizers we may have gone away hungry, which should never be the case in an Italian place! And especially at $15+ for pasta.The service was a bit rushed but acceptable. The decor seems like it was trying a little to hard to be \"playful\" and verged almost on tacky. The place was way too bright! The halogen lights made me feel like I was eating in a department store. The small space on Fillmore calls out for candles. Overall it was OK, but I wouldn't make a special trip if I didn't live in the neighborhood. The clam mussel appetizer and glass of wine would make a decent lunch", "author": "David C."}

The food is good and the owner works almost every night to ensure quality control.

After sitting, we were welcomed into two other tables conversations as all parties looked at each other's plates with envy and commented.  I sort of felt like I went with a group as the tables next to us would lean over and ask what we ordered, how it tasted, what we were doing later, etc.  It was a GREAT atmosphere, and I'd say a really easy and fun place to take a date.  Not too loud and not silent by any means.  The stuffed mushrooms were good but kinda small and at $8 for 6 caps, I'd pick a different appetizer.  The bruschetta was excellent with plenty to share for 2.  I'm still in search of a 1200 calorie cesar salad in this town, but Via's was closer to 200 using a fresh olive oil base - a very good spring salad version of a cesar but not my type - it was sorta Zuni Cafesque.

We are polite, well-dressed people and could see no logic in this: it seemed oddly  \"random\".  That was just the first sign we had innocently stumbled into the Twilight Zone to dine.  A man with a deafening air of stereotypyed  Italianness told us the specials.  One was crabmeat ravioli.  I selected that and a salad to follow.   He bulldozed me with \"No!  Salad comes first\", as if he were correcting some rube.  Of course in classic Italian cuisine, salad comes after the main course.  The appetizer comes first and is seldom something so ordinary as a small house salad.  But I felt myself in the presence of an overbearing ass, so---noblesse oblige--- just let him make my order HIS way.  (Made me yearn for my high school days dining at Burger King.  At least they knew how to do it MY way!)    Moments later a server arrived at the table to tell me \"No crabmeat ravioli.  Porcini.\"  I changed my order to Chicken Sorrentino, a decent chicken dish.  My companion had chicken marsala, also okay.   Nothing, please believe me, nothing special here, though we had fun later laughing at the Bunuelian sequence of events, many not reported here, at Via Veneto.  Go for a laugh and no other reason.

That kind of shocked me and I looked at all of the shellfish carefully to make sure all were open, etc.  They were so I thought OK, let's try it.  The mussels were varying sizes, some were really BIG.  The clams were smallish.  And there was some definite grit going on.  The broth is what ruined the dish for me.  It just had an \"off\" flavor to it.  I usually like to dip my bread in it (which you have to because it is so tough!) and finish it off, but I couldn't.  Where was the garlic bread that usually comes with it at other places I've tried?  The mozzarella and tomato salad I ordered came WAY after the mussels and was served with olive oil and basil leaves.  I asked for balsamic vinegar because I prefer it that way.  The mozzarella was dry and the tomatoes appeared to be the hot house variety and had no flavor.  The balsamic was runny and weak tasting.  But the basil was good.  Fresh cracked pepper would have been nice also.  And I was surprised at how slow the service was considering they weren't even busy!

The 'service' bordered somewhere between rude and dis-engaged, and there are far too many options for what I remember to be a pricey restaurant with only average Italian fare from a few years back.", "author": "Larry M."}

To my surprise, the gentleman who answered the phone at Via Veneto was more than accommodating with my dinner request for two.  After informing me that they were booked until 10PM he asked \"When would you like to eat?\"  I answered with 7:30 and he responded \"How about 7:45?\" OK!!!  \nSo... so far so good... but then we had to eat.  Upon arriving at the restaurant, it didn't appear to be that busy.  The menu was not fixed and was pleased to see several solid options.  I ordered the rib-eye (which I never would order unless at a steakhouse - but the waiter insisted it was their best item) and my date ordered the fish.  My rib-eye was overcooked and tough - her fish was dry and bland...  \nOverall, the place itself is cute - staff is helpful - the meal was moderately priced... but I would have been happy to pay more for a decent meal.  I would pass on this one if you have an alternative.", "author": "Matt G."}

The menu seemed very reasonably priced so we finally decided to check it out last Friday night; just the two of us.  If it weren't for the service, I would have given this place 5 stars but just as many other Yelpers have said, this is where they're lacking.  As soon as we walked in, the host said he could seat us now, just give him a minute.  We weren't in any rush, so we stood there patiently with another group of 3.  Basically, there was a lot of going back and forth, more confusion and about 3 more \"just a minute\"s.  Again, we weren't in any hurry but we just wanted to know what was going on!  The group of 3 ended up leaving which caused the host to chase them down on the sidewalk and bring them back, only for them to continue waiting.  I don't know what was going on there but whatever, the host seated us a few minutes after that.  Our server greeted us and we asked to hear the specials...there were quite a few and I'm pretty sure they sounded awesome but they were rattled off so quickly, I wasn't able to catch most of them.  I would recommend they have a separate list of just specials since they have so many.  Anyways, I decided to give the basics a try: Bruschetta and the Fettuccine Alfredo (my fav food in the whole world).  Bruschetta was very decent and came with 6 pieces for $5!!!!  Amazing!  Usually, I pay around $7 for 3.  So I was eager to try my main dish.  I'd heard excellent things about the Fettuccine Alfredo here and it didn't disappoint!  Perfectly al dente, rich and creamy sauce, good consistency with a touch of nutmeg!  5 stars alone for this!  And only $10.50?!?!  Did I read that right?  YES!  Yes, I did!  Bottom line, I will be returning if only to enjoy that dish again...oooh, better idea...I'll get it to go.  I hope they do take-out!", "author": "Kelly H."}

Nothing was right - the atmosphere was tense, the owner (or someone \"in charge\") was arguing with patrons, the service was really slow and the food itself was very disappointing. In my opinon, it's hard to do Italian poorly, but Via Veneto does. I will never go back there again.", "author": "c c."}

And I'm not just talking about the hospitality you recieve from the moment you enter the threshold of this authentic and charming nook. I love all the collector magnum bottles of wine around the kitchen... talk about gettin' a party started! Seriously though, the wine list is very impressive.  Every dish I have tried is delicious.  Lobster ravioli is so good, as is the scaloppine de funghetto. GREAT date spot. I also really enjoy the intriguing murals on the walls. Mossimo and the entire team at Via Veneto are top notch and they will make you and your stomach very happy :)", "author": "Zachary D."}

Based on appearance and the vast menu of Italian faves like calamari, scallopine, and marsala, Via Veneto looked like it could be a winner and at 5pm we knew we would receive impeccable service.  The ambiance is charming...green vines and faux frescoes.  There is also a quaint patio in the back for those sunnier days. The house red was great...Montepulciano. ummmmm.  We shared a half carafe for $11.  What a deal!  I sensed it was going to be a good meal by the freshness of the table bread and whole roasted garlic clove-infused oil.  We started with the beef carpaccio.  Paper thin quality beef served w/ oo, capers, parm, and lemon wedges.  Tasssssty!  My dunch-mate ordered the gnocci with gorgonzola cream sauce and I ate like an animal.  I went from raw beef to a big fat pork chop.  (hey-i need my protein).  It was one of the specials...pork chop stuffed with prosciutto and gorgonzola served with mixed veg and roasted potatoes.  This was one tasty hunk of meat and I'll have to admit the veggies weren't mixed, but the veggie sure was good.  We think it was chard, but I forgot to ask.  My gal-pal said the gnocci was authentic and scrumptuous.  We talked our way well into the dinner rush and finally dessert.  What's an Italian dinner without the Tiramisu?  Man, am i glad we splurged.  It wasn't too soggy, nor to creamy, it was just right and the fresh raspberries were the perfect touch. Wine, premium app, two entrees, and dessert...for $60.  That is a serious steal for a quality meal in SF and even more so in Pac Heights.", "author": "Regan P."}

They have an awesome special of lobster ravioli which you can order when it's not even on the menu.  The service is great if you want a chilll meal (not if you're in a rush).  Massimo was very friendly with great wine suggestions.  I recommend the poached pear for dessert!  A great meal!", "author": "Jaclyn M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-24", "description": "This place is great for a group/family dinner. The staff are very friendly and the place feels genuinely Italian. The waiter was quick to take our order and there is a good selection of wines and main courses to choose from. The stuffed mushrooms and bruscetta were really tasty, very fresh tomatoes and nicely toasted bread. Everyone enjoyed the main courses, with the lobster ravioli and sea bass being the stand out dishes. Overall, we had a really enjoyable dinner - the service was great and while the food isn't anything that will blow you away, it's simple and tasty - just how Italian food should be. If there's anything negative at all, the decor and lighting is too bright for me so if you're looking for a super trendy place or a cozy romantic restaurant, this isn't it. But if you're looking for a friendly Italian spot with good food then you should definitely consider going here.", "author": "Andy F."}
