I used to live walking distance and came almost every weekend. Now I live across the city and will literally still take a 45 minute muni or $10 uber just to get a bowl. Is that a little much? Probably. But I love Basik that much.\n\nI am a creature of habit and like things simple, so I get the same thing every time- the Brazilian bowl. Their granola is the best and I always ask for extra to make sure the acai to granola ratio is on point. Recommended!\n\nMy only complaint is that the line moves slowly and it feels like they should be able to be more efficient back there, but it's honestly so good that I'm willing to wait.", "author": "Lindsey S."}

I like a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls as much as the next guy, but this Hawaiian-based chain has taken it to a level of heavily sweetened excess. Now I suppose I could have ordered the $8 Brasilian, which is their basic blend of a\u00e7a\u00ed and apple juice, topped with honey, granola, and bananas. In hindsight, that sounds pretty good, but hey, if this cafe is saying aloha to me, then I felt the need to order the $11 Islander, which blended a\u00e7a\u00ed with hemp mylk (...yes, they spell it 'mylk' so I won't think it came from a cow). Toppings were kinda on the manic side...\n\nNot only was there granola, bananas, and honey but also strawberries, gojiberries, and coconut shavings. Wow, look at this monstrosity with the honey dripping over the side (photo: http://bit.ly/2M3GizB). It was frankly too sweet for my taste, and I couldn't finish it. The other choices appeared just as elaborate with toppings like bee pollen, cacao nibs, and hemp hearts in the mix. The smoothies sound like they'd go down easier assuming they are fully blended. There wasn't much in the way of festive decor in here - no ukuleles, no welcome leis, no voodoo-cursed tiki dolls. All the tropical decor will be in your stomach...at least temporarily.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls with a lotta bells & whistles\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...no Hawaiiana in here, pretty spartan\nSERVICE - 2 stars...unsmiling like they've already OD'ed on the a\u00e7a\u00ed \nTOTAL - 3 stars...if you want an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl with all the fixings and then some\n\nRELATED - Looking for something Hawaiian for dinner?

However, a little overpriced, even for a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls. If you get the large ($14) and split it between two people it becomes an average SF price, but paying ~$11 for a small (1/2 to 1/3 of the size) is definitely not worth. I do like that you can customize the bowl, like swapping out granola or different types of milk. Of course, this also costs extra.\n\nBut overall, the price warrants the experience and service. The space itself or gorgeous, lots of large, tall windows and an super high ceilings. Our bowl came out in under ten minutes, which was impressive considering there were a decent amount of customers in the store and only 2-3 workers!", "author": "Rachel L."}

However, Basik holds it down! I ordered the Puna Bowl to go since my boo dropped me off to take the order. There is only street parking, and even then it's kind of difficult to find it on this busy street...so I'd recommend using public transport or Lyft to drop you off. I chose the Puna because of the spirulina and the lack of nuts #allergyyelper ALSO, can we all say a hip hip hooray for them using hemp milk instead of solely nut milk!? THANK YOU. Now to find an acai spot that does oat milk...hmm\n\nI went with the largest size because we were sharing it, and both wanted a refreshing and light \"pick me up\" for lunch. The bowl was made within 8 minutes or so, very fast! The acai itself is the quality that I always judge hard. Basik's is more on the slushy side in terms of mouthfeel, but the taste is so flavorful and NOT overdone with extra ice or any of that extra crap. The flavors of the Puna bowl are so good and balanced. It was so delicious with the blueberries and YUMMY crunchy granola (nut-free for my allergy folks! however, they did preface my question with the \"traces of nuts\" component). We were able to finish the whole bowl without it melting in the car, while the sun was shining and heating up the bowl.\n\nTheir storefront is quite small in space, with a few high top tables and seats...so I wouldn't recommend coming with a large group. They don't have wifi, but they do have water and other utensils for those who are ordering to go. Service was quite friendly and they all seemed like high school kids. I'd totally come back to Basik to order other bowls...I've got my eyes on all the other options.", "author": "Jodi H."}

Just know that it takes about 7-10 minutes for you to get your bowl after you order if here were people in front of you. Also each specialty bowl is $11 for small and $14 for a large in case you were price conscious.\n\nThe first time I tried this place I tried their special jungle love bowl, which was a pitaya bowl with mango juice in the blend, topped with granola, kiwi, strawberries, blueberries, cacao nibs, bee pollens, and honey. I got the large because going or go home right? Well, This bowl was delicious and went above my expectations (which wasn't super high in the first place without much to compare it to). It was good for two meals!\n\nWhen I went back this past Sunday, I was sad to see the sign for the jungle love bowl gone, but hey, I should try another bowl this time, which I did. I tried the Forager and this time, I went with the small size and it was enough for a meal. It was similar to the jungle love in terms of the toppings and was just as good. \n\nSeating is a bit sparse even early in the morning, so it's better to take your bowl to go\n\nDef coming back whenever I'm in the area for another bowl!", "author": "Karen Y."}

Acai bowls and smoothies sounded perfect.\n\nIt's a small space that fills up quickly. Most people take their orders to go or eat quickly. The wait for a table doesn't take too long. We grabbed a Banyan acai bowl and Waialeah smoothie. The large acai bowl is pretty big.. you might want to split it between two people. I didn't really think about the size until it came out. The fruit they used was very fresh the bananas were sweet and soft. Great crunch texture from the granola and almonds. Nice sweetness from the honey drizzled on top. The acai was blended to perfection it wasn't runny or a frozen chunk. I liked that they layered the bowl so you're not having to dig to the bottom to get all the goods. The smoothie was great.

Other reviews mention hefty lines, but when we went at 4pm on a Saturday, we were the only ones waiting, with just two others in the cafe.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - The cafe itself is on a bit of an incline, while the interior is a bit on the smaller side. The cashier is completely accessible, but aside from a lower, accessible counter right by the door, all other seating is comprised of high tops.\n\nBathroom - Didn't try them.", "author": "Johnny W."}

This is your place to go for acai bowls if you like them, love them, or have never had one.\n\nThe first time I went there I ordered the Banyan bowl, and have never been able to go back! The blend consists of acai, peanut butter and cashew milk and the toppings include granola, almonds, hemp seeds, bee pollen, and honey. Peanut butter in an acai bowl might sound a bit weird to some, but trust me, it's a game changer in all the right ways :) They also make their granola in house, which adds to the deliciousness of this bowl. \n\nThe only reason I am docking a star is because of the price- $14 for a large acai bowl definitely makes Basik Cafe a place to go to when you want to treat yourself.", "author": "Elizabeth M."}

I was surprised when I saw my bill at $140.96 when I was expecting a little less at $108. I was told by the cashier that they started charging service fees for orders 5 or more, that it's a \"new thing\" they started doing. I asked how much was the service fee cashier can't give me the percentage, instead told me that I have to just do the Math. \n\nI thought the food has priced itself out of my budget. The service fee by the way is 20% of total bill plus tax which in my case svc fee $21.60 + 11.36 tax. which added a total of $32.96 on my bill just because I ordered more than 5 items. \n\nOn the way out I asked for a bag but I was told that they started charging for those too and to top it off, When I got to work I found out that they messed up the one I ordered even though I gave them a word pro copy of the order. \n\nIt was disappointing...", "author": "Ryan A."}

The use of whole/half/quarter almonds with the Acai Bowls is the worst example of judgement I've encountered in a LONG time. It completely ruined the texture, consistency, flavor, and experience that a great Acai bowl can be.\n\nIf you don't get almonds, it'll be fantastic. Great ingredients, etc etc. But their use of almonds shows to me no thought from the company in regards to how the bowl is supposed to \"flow\". If they had thinly sliced and roasted the almonds I think that would have worked quite well. But you're enjoying this nice smooth Acai bowl with delicious fruit when all of a sudden you hit a massive, effectively frozen whole almond, or actually multiple! I picked them all out and they must have put in half a cup or more of almonds. I implore you to pass on the almonds if you don't want the granola.

It's not as good as the acai I got in Brazil, but really, nothing is.  It's not even as good as the acai in Hawaii but you know what, it's here and you try taking an acai cup from either of those two places and keep it from melting, so yeah, I give Basik 5 stars.\n\nI'm a fan of two things really: the Brasilian acai cup and the Acai smoothie.  I don't like bananas so I get it with no bananas but get strawberries instead.  I kind of think the smoothie is more enjoyable and tastier, and a little cheaper, but if you want to replace a meal, you probably want something you can eat with a spoon.\n\nIf they have fresh fruit, check out what they have because sometimes you can add on fresh peaches or pineapples and it's super yummy!\n\nThe line is often times really long and goes outside the door.  If it looks long then yes it will take a while, and a lot of times I won't wait because it will take you 15-20 minutes just to get to order and then another 15-20 minutes to get your food because they'll get that backed up.  If the line is still inside the store, be patient and it should be fine.\n\nBathroom is a single and it's locked with a code you have to get from them.\n\nThey used to close the store exactly at closing time, regardless of if you were standing in line.

I think this is one of the best acai bowls in the city, and I've tried at least 3 other places.\n\nThe small is a decent size for $11 and will fill you up, and the large is massive - like the size of a large tub of yogurt. It's certainly large enough to fill up 2 people, and at $14 is not too bad for what you get.\n\nI got the Banyan, which has the acai blend, peanut butter, almond milk, granola, bananas, honey, bee pollen, almonds, and hemp hearts. I love any acai bowl with peanut butter, granola, and bananas, and this was excellent. They didn't skimp on the toppings, and it the acai base wasn't too sweet.\n\nI'm sure I'd be happy with any of their other acai bowls, as all the other combinations look great. I wouldn't necessarily come here all the time though. While this is certainly all the rage, and deemed really healthy with antioxidants, etc. in the acai, there's still a lot of natural sugar in here. It's better than a bunch of refined sugar, but it's still sugar all the same.

Beware that the lines can get long (can be 15-30 min) and if you go on the weekend you may have to listen to a lot of Marina girls rehash bad decisions they made on the weekend when they come with all their friends post-workout or as they nurse a hangover, and you have to stand in line next to them for 30 min.", "author": "Christina L."}

They use fresh ingredients, have fast/friendly service, a great atmosphere and make what I think are the best a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls in the city- and that's not a bold statement either (give it a try and you'll see).\n\nFirst of all, if you've never had an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl before, you need to make your way over here as soon as possible. Besides being delicious, they are also incredibly healthy. How healthy you ask? Well, the main ingredient used in these bad boys is a\u00e7a\u00ed berry, which comes from A\u00e7a\u00ed palm (which is a species of palm tree that originated from Brazil). A\u00e7a\u00ed berries contain a bunch of antioxidants, fibers and heart-healthy fats that are really good for your system. But I'm not a doctor, so don't hold me accountable.\n\nSo now that I'll tell you that I ordered the \"Brasilian\", it will actually makes sense and doesn't sound like they just gave it a random name based on a country. History! Don't you love it? No? Dang. Anyways, the Brasilian was top notch! It's basically a mix of blended a\u00e7a\u00ed, apple juice toppings, granola, banana and honey (see picture). They have a diverse menu, so if you're still on the fence about getting an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl, you also have the option of getting something similar yet different, like a smoothie. We all love smoothies right?\n\nFinal verdict: Basik Cafe brings a very relaxed vibe to what is otherwise a pretty busy area. They have fast service, fresh ingredients and top notch a\u00e7a\u00ed.

I looked over to my partner and asked her about some of the options for acai around the city and so we looked up Basik on yelp. It looked like it had gigantic and delicious bowls so we took the plunge and headed out there!\n\nWe arrived at the scene only to see a gigantic line. A line? For acai? Well we had already made the trip out here so we figured we'd wait in this gigantic line that took us about 15 minutes to go through, plus the bowls looked really good so I figured it would be worth it.\n\nWe get closer to the front and begin to see the menu. \"14 dollars???\". My partner was blown away at how expensive a bowl of acai could be. But again, all the signs were there to indicate that this bowl of acai would blow us away. \n\nSo I ordered a $14 forager bowl and waited around for a seat to clear. I was hella excited.\n\nTo my disappointment the acai was bland, the bananas were not fully ripened and the strawberries tasted as though they were picked out of target. There was just no flavor. So after all of this commotion it's hard to really think of any positive experience coming out of this restaurant. The hunt for good acai in SF continues.", "author": "Ramie C."}

I've only been here on weekdays so there was no wait for me. On my first visit, I was eying the Banyan, but after telling the cashier that I love the taste of acai, she recommended the Brasilian since the peanut butter in the Banyan is strong. I substituted the apple juice for almond milk, but found the Brasilian bland. All I could taste was granola. They told me they use one scoop of acai and it's unsweetened. The owner/manager let me try two different acai bases to compare. He said a lot of places over sweeten their acai base making their bowls more like ice cream, but Basik only adds honey as a topping to their acai bowls. The unsweetened acai that they use has a very subtle, slightly bitter flavor. I do prefer my acai base sweetened; he told me that Brazilians like to use a lot of guarana as a sweetener. \n\nI was curious to try Basik again so I visited first thing in the morning on a weekday. I wanted something I can drink while I walk to pilates so I decided on the Mayan smoothie which the cashier said was her favorite. I took it to go and was disappointed that it tasted more like minty milk. Again, I didn't taste the acai. I should've read the board more carefully and gone with a sweeter smoothie such as the drifter which is blended with strawberries. If you give them your phone number, they'll sign you up for their rewards program but you only get credits for acai bowls and not the smoothies. After two disappointing visits, I'm not sure how many stamps I'd accumulate. Maybe I should give the Banyan a try but I'm hesitant to spend another $11 here.", "author": "Diana B."}

I got the simplest acai bowl ever which is the \"Brasillian\" which costed me $8 and extra fifty cents for add on chia seeds. The price is decent for what you pay for now a days for acai bowls. They didn't have much toppings, just the bananas and granola. Oh and the honey drizzle. The acai was good but only if you eat it with the granola or banana.

So how does this place compare to the many other Acai places in SF now? \nFor starters, its a bit cheaper. its 12 bucks for a large, which is LARGE. I've seen Acai bowls go over 15 bucks easily (and for a smaller portion than you would get here). \n\nAlso, being Brazilian and having had my first acai there, I constantly compare it to how its done there. This means just the original acai, with a thicker sorbet consistency ( most of the ones we find in SF are almost smoothie-like)  blended with guarana, although I'm not sure they  blend it with guarana here, and served with honey, bananas, and granola. They have a bowl here that fits that description and it is appropriately named the \"Brasilian\" (spelled with an S, so bonus points for that) and is what I got. It was really, really, good and I could immediately understand why this place always has such a long line (i've walked by a couple times before and was deterred by the line). Not too sweet, or too tangy, great consistency, and huge portion. \n\nThe great thing about this place is that it does acai the original way (or at least how the original is in my mind), but they also have many variations of acai bowls and topping choices. In addition to bowls, they also have smoothies. Sort of like a one stop shop for all things acai. Its a small place with limited seating and the seemingly intimidating line out the door goes pretty quickly. I took mine to go and headed up polk towards Fort Mason by the water. \n\nThis place and Bowl'd Acai are my favorites in SF thus far.", "author": "Thielson D."}

A refreshing feel though, for sure. \n\nI tried the BANYAN bowl after asking the store lead what the most popular acai bowl was. It came with granola, honey, bananas, and was blended with peanut butter. It was absolutely DELICIOUS! Great texture, the honey drizzle was the perfect touch of sweetness, the granola was not too crunchy but not too soft, it is topped with almonds which adds the perfect extra crunch, and the base itself was great (esp. with the touch of peanut butter).\n\nOverall, the meal felt satisfying and refreshing - not too heavy. I was a little iffy about paying $11 for a small acai bowl, but hey... they're based out of Kona and so you're paying for some authentic stuff here.\n\nOVERALL VERDICT: I'm 100% addicted to acai bowls (would definitely say they are in my top 3 foods of all times) and I have nothing but great things to say about this spot!", "author": "Roopa S."}

Ironically, it was also one of the earlier acai bowls we'd ever had, so we didn't fully appreciate how good it was until trying many others. The price tag is high, but if you get the large, you'll be full for hours and maybe only need a light snack before dinner, no lunch. $14 for two meals isn't bad! While the price tag is hefty compared to other acai bowls, they're really delivering you quality ingredients and massive servings. This is their second shop, their first was on the Big Island in Hawaii.\n\nWe mostly had the islander each time we went - a blend of acai and housemade hemp milk, topped with strawberries, bananas, goji berries, organic coconut shavings and Hawaiian honey. This stuff is good! Sweet without being too sweet and a perfect blend of flavors that come together nicely. The acai is also the perfect consistency of just a bit thicker than a smoothie, perfect to eat with a spoon. You can choose to get the granola gluten free or not.\n\nThe acai bowls are completely dairy free (as many are), and they also have a long list of smoothies if that's more your speed. I believe they're also selling Kona coffee now. Service is very friendly. Seating is limited, but it's good if you go with a friend, have them order and snag a seat whenever one becomes available. My mom and sister were in town for a long weekend, and asked to go back to this place more than once - it's that good.

I personally think Basik Cafe has the best acai bowls in the city! The acai bowls come in two sizes - the difference between the small and large is pretty significant. If you ask me, I would just say, \"supersize it!\" For a couple more dollars, you can more than double your delicious acai bowl. A large is plenty enough for 2-3 people.\n\nI've tried the Brasilian (classic acai blend, tangy and fruity), Islander (has hemp milk, so it's more creamy), and Puna (has spirulina powder, so has a greens/leafy hint). I'm not a huge fan of the nutty acai bowls, but they have a few blends on the menu that incorporate lots of nuts. There's something for everyone! : )\n\nIn addition to the acai bowl menu, they also have a smoothie menu. Most people come here for the acai bowls, so I'd stick with an acai bowl. I did recently try the Acai smoothie and it was underwhelming. It wasn't a very satisfying smoothie. The texture was more like a thick juice; it had a very watery consistency. \n\nThe store is very clean and on the smaller size (there are 2 small tables and limited bar-style seats by the window). \n\nOne thing to note is that they are very strict with their closing times. If they say they will close at 1PM, THEY WILL CLOSE at 1PM sharp. Even if you were waiting in line for 30 mins and you finally make it up to the ordering window - once it hits 1PM, they will turn you and everyone else behind you away. That actually happened to me... it's sad, but I respect that. Just something to keep in mind... : P\n\n\nTL;DR\n- best acai bowls in the city\n- large size is best value\n- very strict closing times; do not come around closing, especially if there is a line\n- there is usually a line out the door\n- they have smoothies, but they're just okay... stick with acai bowls imo\n- limited indoor seating\n- clean store/clean bathroom", "author": "Monica T."}

First off, let me tell you what's great about this place. I love the decor, the cleanliness, the fact they use organic and fresh ingredients, and the location. Once I saw it was open, my coworkers and I started visiting it every other day. I typically have good experiences with the staff. I have only tried one smoothie - the Wailea and for the most part, it's amazing (hence why it's the only drink I've tried.) There have been three or four times I've ordered it and received a different drink. I know this because the color and taste is different. Only knowing what the Wailea tastes like helps. Each time I spoke to the staff about it, they were some-what defensive, but always made the drink again. The second time making it--it's always right! Since I leave with the correct drink, I never complain. \n\nToday was a different experience. I ordered the Wailea and got the wrong drink. I told the guy at the register what was going on and he grabbed the owner. The owner is a bearded bald guy that wears flip flops and white tees. He listened to my concern and then showed me the receipt which shows I ordered a Wailea. I agreed and stated that the drink didn't taste like the Wailea I normally get from them. I explained that this had happened before and that each time they remake it, the drink is correct. Instead of calmly remaking the drink, refunding my money, or apologizing--he chose to tell me I was wrong, belittled me in front of customers, and outwardly showed frustration. \n\nI worked in hospitality/food service for over 10 years and I know that it can be hard to apologize and swallow your pride when you've made a mistake. This was worse than that. He told me that they didn't have measuring spoons and blamed it on one of the ingredients being too powerful. How can you expect to make the same drink over and over with no failure without measuring spoons? How can the consumer recommend a business and its product to someone else, without the guarantee it will be the same product for that future consumer? This blows my mind. \n\nTo conclude, I was made another drink. It was not the Wailea.", "author": "Jessica R."}

I got the \"Banyan\" which seems to be one of their most popular bowls. The acai was a bit watered down and did not have the real taste of acai berries compared to Blue Hawaii Cafe. If you've tried both, you can definitely tell the difference in terms of texture and taste.

I emailed them, followed them on instagram, and pretty much made sure I would know as soon as their SF store opens. Basik Acai in Kona was one of my favorite places on the Big Island so I would go there at least 2 times every time I visited. I haven't had an acai bowl in California that tasted like the one in Kona, so needless to say, I was extremely excited for this and had high expectations. \n\nI tried the puna bowl, kilaueau bowl, and banyan bowl with two friends. Perhaps because the girl behind the counter is still new and hasn't perfected proportions needed to make the acai base, but the acai base for our 3 bowls had varying textures.  It was very apparent that the puna bowl was the iciest since there were ice crystals...\nThe kilaueau bowl tasted extremely diluted and barely had acai taste to it. The banyan bowl had more flavor since the peanut butter thickened the acai base and gave it more taste. The fresh fruit toppings and granola on all the bowls were the best part!  \n\nOverall I was very disappointed in the lack of flavor in the acai base. I'll probably give Basik Cafe another chance after a couple of months.", "author": "Cindy L."}

To me, the ratios were totally off - 1/3 acai base, 1/3 banana, 1/3 granola (got the banyan bowl). The granola was so abundant that it soaked up all the sorbet and I couldn't appreciate a virgin bite of acai base. The banana was underripe and detracted from the flavors instead of enhancing, as underripe bananas will do. And when I asked to do half and half banana and strawberry instead of all banana, I got the longest pause followed by response of \"well.. We only use half a banana in there so if we cut that in half you'd get like two slices\". So what do you do then for all the other bowls where it is a banana strawberry mix?? In any case, for those wondering, I had 10-15 solid fat slices of underripe banana in my bowl.\n\nGiven all the glowing reviews I will shell out another 11 bucks to give Basik a second shot and happily update my review if  it turns out I simply got an off bowl.

I would consider splitting the large for $11 with one or two people depending on how hungry we all were. Overall, a wonderful experience, can't wait to go back!", "author": "Charlotte C."}

I was only in town for a short time and this place was close so I headed over for breakfast on a weekday (around 9:30). I was second in line and ended up getting the Indian Summer bowl (a bowl only available in the fall). While I was waiting for it to come out (which took about 3-4 minutes), I was getting mad at myself for not going with one of their more traditional bowls (as I had never had an acai bowl before and I figured the more traditional the better). But when I tried it, I was in heaven (and definitely not regretting it!). So good!! For me, the price was quite steep for a breakfast bowl (11$ for a small), but the small bowl was quite large and there were definitely enough toppings and granola pieces to make each bite flavorful. I would definitely recommend trying this place!", "author": "Annika R."}

Moving to SF and not having many acai bowl places near me, I was so excited to try this new acai bowl place; but I was SO disappointed when I finally did. I walked in all super stoked to try the bowls because the cafe was so cute and had a Good Vibes sign on an arrow pointing to the cafe. Although the options were limited and this place was pricey, I was still excited to try it. But when I finally got my overpriced bowl, it had no flavor, at all. On top of that, all they added to my bowl was honey, granola, and banana. If you're gonna charge me $8 for a bowl that only has honey and granola, you could at least make sure  the acai has some flavor. Beware, it doesn't. If you know your acai bowls, this place was is no good.", "author": "Kapri H."}

The staff was very accommodating and you can normally swap out a dry topping for another.

I've been when the fruit was extremely fresh and I've been when they masked the middle layer of my large bowl with old bananas and strawberries...gross. The add ons are ridiculous. While I like that I can add a seasonal fruit for $1, getting 4 raspberries is just plain highway robbery. Lastly is the service, it too is very inconsistent. Most of the time, the person at the register has been nice but the last time I visited the girl behind the counter waited until I added in my tip, flipped the ipad around looked and then went and put my order together. After subbing almonds for granola and adding on $.25/piece raspberries I wasn't too inclined to tip more than a $1, sorry. That's probably why I got 2day old bananas and strawberries I suppose.

We went up and told them why we were upset and even said we aren't try to be your boss but thats not right. The employee said, \"Well, it sounds like you are\". And continued to argue with us.

Also I liked that they have cashew and almond milk bc my friend can't do almond milk. Now if they just served these bowls with a side of meat this Paleo girl would be jazzed.
