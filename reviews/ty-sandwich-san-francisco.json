I went with a #1, which is fancy pork with pate. If you opt for everything, you'll also get the regular fixins of carrots, cilantro, jalapeno onions, cucumbers, and mayo. I also paired it with a deep roasted oolong milk tea with boba.\n\nThe boba came out first, on first sip, it wasn't too sweet and you could definitely pick up on the roasted oolong flavor - definitely one of the better versions I've had, which actually puts a fair number of boba places to shame. The boba also had the right chew and sweetness. Shortly after, the sandwich came. On first look, I was a little disappointed at how thin the fancy pork was sliced, but otherwise, there was a good amount of pate and it was well stuffed with the fixins. \n\nBut when I picked up the sandwich, that's when the magic happened! The bread crackled with a beautiful symphony of sounds and the everything just fell into place after. Overall, it was delicious. If I could change anything, I would probably ask for a little more mayo (kewpie mayo is noms).", "author": "Elaine Y."}

I ordered the lemongrass beef sandwich and a Vietnamese coffee for lunch, and I am happy with both though the beef is like ground beef instead of thinly sliced grilled beef. It tasted okay even though it is more like a big piece of ground meat on a sandwich. I will rather try the lemongrass pork next time to see if it is the sliced meat which I think has better texture and quality. The onion is raw if you are not a fan like me, then skip it. Overall a decent sandwich for $6. \n\nThe coffee is very strong and sweet so I had to ask for a cup of iced water to dilute it. It is like buying one cup for two cups of coffee!

Out of several times I've gotten this, there was only one incident of them forgetting the egg rolls in my order, but I caught it before I left. They were apologetic and made the egg rolls for me right away. \n\n** General tip: Always double check your to-go order before leaving. **\n\nThey also sell prepacked shrimp/pork spring rolls ($6.00; 3 rolls with peanut sauce) at the counter next to the register. They're okay.\n\nWill visit again for a quick fix but only occasionally since it is a bit pricier than other vietnamese places.", "author": "Amy T."}

I've tried a variety of products and was hoping to change my perspective on my visit. CASH ONLY! We ordered the Combo (#3), Grilled Chicken (#4), Spring Rolls (#10), a Thai tea, and milk tea (both with boba). All for Take-Out since the interior was pretty small.\n\nBEWARE! One main reason why I resorted to a 2 star rating was because our milk tea was made with SPOILED MILK. A couple sips in, I noticed it tasted sour. I called them inquiring whether it should resemble a sour/lemon taste and they sounded surprised - which I think was their way of saying \"no it shouldn't.\" Thankfully they offered a complimentary milk tea, but I graciously declined since I had left the area and was too far from the shop.\n\nAs for the other items... I personally tackled on the Grilled Chicken #3 and I felt that the sauce was not evenly distributed throughout the sandwich. I also forgot to ask for pate so that may be another reason. But based on their high rating, I was expecting something tastier. Their spring rolls didn't have mint and was pretty bland. Their spring roll sauce lacked hoisen sauce as well so maybe try asking for some extra before you leave.\n\nOverall, this place has potential and is located right on Mission. Parking may be a hassle, but if you're not staying too long the Safeway lot is located close by. I hope to return sometime in the future to alter my perspective and hopefully have a more successful visit next time.", "author": "Jana V."}

This is especially awesome considering how often I find myself in and around the neighborhood.\n\nIt's a small shop that's run by two of the friendliest people you'll ever meet.

Much better than the banh mi from Mission Noodle House just a few doors down.\n\nAfter the kitchen remodel in August 2015, sandwich prices have gone up by 50 cents, but $4.50 is still a very good deal. The cold cuts (steamed pork, ham+pate) banh mis are now $4.25 (was $3.75).\n\nNew menu items = Bubble milk tea ($3, regular, taro, mango, strawberry, or honeydew). There's now a lemongrass beef (beef meatballs) banh mi. The rice plate (white rice, fried egg, 2 mini rolls + choice of grilled pork or grilled chicken) is still $7, but now there's also a vermicelli bowl (similar to the plate but with rice noodles, same choice of meats, but no egg) for $7 too. And the previously unlisted fried imperial rolls (8 mini rolls for $5.25) are now included on the menu board.\n\nService is also much faster now. Yesterday, I got my order in under 5 minutes. In the past, I often had to wait 10-30 minutes. Service has always been very friendly.\n\nMy favorite banh mi are the grilled chicken and the grilled pork.

Otherwise, as good as always, with a few jalapeno slices for heat, and a good crunchy crust bread.\n\nFYI, I was told that the name \"Ty\" is the owner's nickname (I think his name is Huynh).\n\nAfter the remodel, the shop now offers catering and delivery service (call for info).

It was crunchy on the outside, but when you bite into it, it was so soft!!!\n\nPate:  I like mine with a bit more pate and a little saltier.  I could barely taste the pate on my sandwich.\n\nMeat:  Is it weird that I like my sandwiches with less meat?  They PACKED it with the lemongrass beef!  So if you like lots of meat, you'll like it.  I thought it overpowered the sandwich.  I also tried the combo banh mi.  It wasn't as tasty as I remembered when I had banh mi's at other restaurants.\n\nI also ordered the fresh spring rolls and they were a disappointment.  There were only vermicelli noodles, lettuce, and shrimp.  (and the cost was $5!)

My friends and I decided to pick up dinner here and looked up the menu on Yelp so we could call in it beforehand. The lady who answered the phone was super sweet and spoke good English, and said our order would be ready in 10-15 minutes. Highly recommended to do take-out since the place is super small. Our order was ready when we got there, and we tried:\n\n-House Chicken Wings ($5.25, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ty-sandwich-san-francisco?select=quPIOaOAlCryq5fgiM2_LQ#quPIOaOAlCryq5fgiM2_LQ): The sauce was very flavorful/borderline salty, and the wings were on the boney side so there wasn't much meat on it. I wouldn't order this again.\n-Grilled Pork Banh Mi w/Pate ($4+$??, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ty-sandwich-san-francisco?select=quPIOaOAlCryq5fgiM2_LQ#I9dHR2LrSOaClpf3y7HS4w): Yum! The grilled pork was done well, as were the pickled vegetables and the bread and mayo- highly recommended. However, the pate was just ok since it wasn't that flavorful- I like my pates very peppery, so I wouldn't add this again.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my banh mi from here and will definitely be back to re-order the grilled pork and also try out the chicken and other fillings.

The baguette is light and crisp with a crunchy exterior. Shredded pickled carrots brighten the b\u00e1nh m\u00ec with its tang and crunch. Cilantro sprigs add a taste of freshness while jalape\u00f1o slices lend a small kick. A swipe of mayo adds a subtle savoriness to an already rich medley of ingredients without being greasy.\n\nOut of all the b\u00e1nh m\u00ec fillings, my favorites are the grilled meats and tofu for their marinated flavors. The grilled pork and grilled chicken have a light chargrilled taste on top of already juicy meat. The tofu comes in thinly shredded slices that are dry, but the moisture from the pickled carrots and mayo balance it perfectly.\n\nIn addition to quality ingredients, well-balanced proportions are Ty's key to a stellar b\u00e1nh m\u00ec. The most common shortcomings are too much bread or a smothering of mayonnaise, but you won't find that at Ty. They achieve a perfect balance between bread and filling, which is a generous amount enough to make the b\u00e1nh m\u00ec feel stuffed. They also don't shy away from giving ample amounts of meat. You'll definitely end up feeling satisfied if not completely stuffed!\n\nOn top of all these qualities that make Ty's b\u00e1nh m\u00ec great, perhaps the greatest is its price: about $4.00 with tax for each b\u00e1nh m\u00ec.\n\nIf you're ever in the area, I'd highly recommend stopping by!", "author": "Tanya A."}

They should be humble. They don't need to brag about being organic or lactose- or MSG- or anything-else-free or brag about having meats from Niman Ranch or Marin Sun Farms or any other fancy meat purveyor du jour. The sandwiches just need to be consistently well-crafted and delicious. \nAnd as I mentioned before, here at Ty Sandwich, they are! \n\nThe place is cozy, clean, and inviting. The prices are spot-on (sorry, folks...anyone paying much more than $4 and change for banh mi is a complete fool trying to eat at a place that shouldn't have banh mi on its menu), and Lin and Edison are just about the nicest people you could possibly meet.\n\nIf you like your sandwich on the spicy side, make sure to ask for more jalape\u00f1os. Also, be aware that they have other stuff that isn't on the menu, so don't be scared to chat Lin and Edison up and check out more of their tasty goods (like the spring rolls, which are available fresh or deep-fried and served with the usual nuoc cham OR their other sour/spicy sauce, the name of which I can't remember)!\n\n(And no, I didn't know Lin and Edison from before I tried their food, so this isn't one of THOSE reviews, okerrrrr?!? #justanhonestopinionfromthehood)", "author": "Ricky C."}

Walk in and you will find a display of chips and bottled drinks. On the menu, shown on a poster board above the register, they keep it simple with a total of 12 menu options: 7 sandwiches ($3.75-$4), chicken wings, rice plate, spring rolls and iced coffee or thai iced tea.\n\nIt was hard to decide which option to pick, as they all looked good.  We finally decided on 3 sandwiches: Combination, Meat Ball, and Grilled Pork.  I added extra pate to all of them because I LOVE pate. The sandwiches came out piping hot and you could tell the baguette was freshly baked by how fluffy the bread was and how crispy the crust was.  Inside each sandwich was the typical offerings of mayo, jalapeno, pickled carrots/daikon, and cilantro.  My ultimate favorite was the grilled pork, the char flavor on the pork was so delicious.  I also ordered a thai tea ($3), which was delicious.\n\nWhat a great place to go for banh mi and milk tea! The lady at the front called me sweetie, so she'd already sold me there.

We ordered the grilled chicken, tofu, and lemongrass beef. I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken and tofu but was disappointed with the lemongrass beef.

I recently had the misfortune of eating the blandest bahn mi I've ever had, and the one before that gave me a stomach ache, so I am very happy to report that this sandwich has restored my faith in the entire genre of bahn mi.\nThe veggies were exactly what I wanted; crisp, fresh, perfect but subtle balance between sweet and sour, neither overpowering the other.  The bread was crispy, crunch, but didn't cut my mouth up when I bit in. The tofu had a really nice flavor that just blended everything together into one happy sandwich. \nAlso, I don't really like coffee, but this was goooooood.\n\nTruth be told I try to rate based on overall experience, but service alone gets 5 stars. So I had to put my phone down and wait to get my bahn mi before going any further. Gosh they are so nice there. She was out of change and made me feel good about giving her a bunch of coins! I will definitely be back on days when I just need a sandwich.", "author": "Astrid V."}

The ham and pate sandwich is even better than the ones I get from chinatown! The pate might have a strong taste to some, but to me, it makes the sandwich more flavorful. The grilled chicken and pork are similar but my favorite would be the pork. It taste like korean BBQ! So delicious. I also had the shrimp and pork spring rolls. The peanut sauce they use is a bit different, a darker color, but I love it! I usually don't like peanut sauce much but this one was spectacular. \nOverall, a 5 for the delicious food, quickness, and nice employees who smile genuinely. Definitely coming back! This will become a regular spot for me. :)", "author": "W L."}

Do yourself a favor and ask for the beef lemongrass banh mi (it's not on their poster menu), but it's one of the best sandwiches I've eaten in the bay area (in the league of pal's takeway, il carne rosso, ike's etc). Notice I didn't include saigon sandwiches in that list. Why? Because -- yes, I dare the universe by saying this -- their beef lemongrass banh mi is way better than anything I've tried at Saigon. The meat to bread ratio is perfect (Saigon's is too bready for me). You get a satisfying portion of meat in every bite, along with the fresh crunch of carrots, cilantro, jalapenos and cucumbers (I think?). But what puts this sandwich over the top is the amazing dressing on the sandwich -- I'm not sure if this was the marinade of the beef lemongrass or some kind of sauce they put on every sandwich, but it was divine. It tasted like a combo of siraccha, tamarind, tomato ketchup, and fish sauce. And despite the pungent (yeah, it's spicy!) flavor of this sauce, you taste the gorgeous freshness of lemongrass in every bite.\nFantastic sandwich, and sets you back 5 dollars.
