Why is there a grand opening sign on the storefront when this place seems to have been open for at least a year now from the looks of all these review.  The other thing that confused me is why the  gigantic sign  hanging over the door outside says ALL DRINKS are $1.99 until 6-15-12 and I was told this was not the case when I was there on Mother's Day.  Since I was with my mother, I didn't make a stink because I didn't want to upset her.  If I was by myself, I would have demanded the promo price or gone across the street to the new boba tea place.  Instead, I sucked it up and I paid the $4 for my drink.  It's pretty crappy to have a huge banner out front to get customers in the door with false advertising.  (See my picture.)\n\nThe pineapple juice with boba and lychee gelee I had was thicker than I expected.  The juice was made from putting frozen pineapple in a blender so I get kept getting the stringy pulp in my mouth.  Since there was only one person making all the drinks, it also it took awhile to get mine.  And my sister's drink was ready but just left on the counter until I asked the cashier to hand it over after waiting a few minutes for it.    Moreover, the same woman was handling money at the cash register and ladling the boba into our drinks.  That seems like unsanitary food handling to me.  Do you know how many germs can be found on money?  \n\nAnd I am also turned off by the fact that they couldn't even make the effort to hide all the previous frozen yogurt furnishings.  Obviously, I am never going back.", "author": "Jeannette W."}

Not very smart on their part because deep fried stuff is a really common late night snack that people go out for.\n\nAs for the avocado milkshake I ordered, I asked how sweet it is and she said I can decide so I told her really sweet and it tastes like she didn't really make it that sweet.

Quickly made for an acceptable stop gap, but I'm so glad there's better boba to devour in the area now.  Helloooooo Sweethut!\n\nThe semi-newborn sister of Wonderful Foods (my favorite boba joint in SF), Sweet Hut is more of a typical boba joint than places like Purple Kow (they don't really have the chubby cups or a lot of the \"dessert drinks\").  Nothing wrong with the basics though!  I ordered a regular Boba Milk Tea and it tasted just as good as what I get from Wonderful Foods.  The tapioca has a great consistency, they use just the right amount of syrupy sweetness, and the milk tea itself has a good balance of cream/milk and tea.  Just spot on good!\n\nSo why only four stars, when I gave Wonderful Foods five?  Because I haven't tried my other favorites here yet!

None of that powdered crap. \n\nService is quick and friendly although you can't tell where to order if there are a lot of people standing around. the Menu is next to the register, but it's off to the side from the register so it makes it a bit awkward to look at the menu. I actually stood in front of the menu and did not see the register since it was tiny. Welp, others (who either has been there before or who has better vision than I do) went directly to the register and ordered... basically cutting in line in front of me. Fortunately, the guy behind the registered asked me for my order since he noticed I was standing there with a confused look on my face. \n\nAll in all... I would definitely be a regular here... at least during their $1.99 promotion. Their regular prices seems a bit high, but for the freshness of their drinks, I might splurge and still continue to get drinks from them.... we'll see how my budget holds up. hahaha....", "author": "Mei C."}

The decor inside feels old and the lighting is none to very dim. It feels dark and scary. I was the only customer at the time so it felt even more scary. The cashier aka the boba maker was very nice and attentive though. She quickly acknowledged me. \n\nTheir menu consisted of milk teas, smoothies, ice teas, and some snacks. I would probably say it's half the size of a Quicklys menu. Anyhow, I wasn't feeling too creative today so I just ordered their regular milk tea with boba. \n\nThe boba itself wasn't anything special, no honey nor anything, but it was well cooked: soft and chewy. I noticed that they make the milk tea fresh and it isn't just pre-made or anything. I see them add quite a lot of ingredients into their \"boba shaker aka margarita shaker.\" My milk tea took about 3-4 minutes to make. Overall, it was sweet to my liking. Definitely better than your typical boba chains out there. However, still average. Maybe next time I'll go give their flavored milk teas a try :)", "author": "Fiona L."}

The reason I love this place is that there are plenty of fresh fruit options for smoothies with boba and the prices are simply amazing. Where can you get a fresh fruit smoothie for $2.99? I haven't seen many without compromising quality. The fresh strawberry smoothie is amazing. Honeydew is a bit on the bland side, but that is how the fruit is. The watermelon tastes like a regular watermelon. The pearl milk tea here is pretty good, but sometimes when new employees get hired, it can be a miss. \n\nThe owner of this place is simply amazing. I've seen him go out of his way and leave the store in order to purchase fresh fruits to satisfy a customer's order. Most people would simply say \"sorry, we're out for today.\" \n\nThere are a couple of small tables inside the store and there are window seats also. Too bad there isn't wifi here for people wanting to use their laptops. The \"coming soon - frozen yogurt\" sign has been there for ages.

That means that the milk tea is made right in front of you, poured into cocktail shakers, shaken, and poured out with just a bit of crushed ice. The flavor of the milk tea is strong (just the way I like it), although it could do with a little more tea flavor. It seems like the condensed milk kind of overpowers the tea flavor sometimes.\n\nTheir boba is also made to perfection. It's chewy, not too sweet, and just makes me feel like I'm in boba heaven.\n\nSweethut has specials going on right now: $1.99 for milk tea or green milk tea and $2.50 for various fruit smoothies (strawberry, strawberry banana, mango, watermelon, and papaya are the ones I remember, but there are a lot more). Just check out the blackboard outside of their shop for the complete list! And did I mention that these $1.99 and $2.50 prices INCLUDE boba? That's right. No extra $0.50 charge for the boba. It's all included in the price. Pretty sweet deal, if you ask me :)\n\nSo why four stars and not five? Because without these specials, the drinks themselves are kind of overpriced, in my opinion. Average of $3 or $4 for the cheapest drink, and then adding the price of toppings on top of that. I'll admit that the drinks are good, but I don't know if I'd be willing to pay regular price for them.", "author": "Yvonne K."}

Since I usually opt for honey black tea and that wasn't on the menu, I decided to try the wulong milk tea, which I have never had before.\n\nI felt like a fool for being blind to it for so long.

So much better than Quickly! There is a good selection of teas and flavors, and they offer fresh fruit juices and smoothies with boba too (haven't tried these yet, but have seen customers get fresh watermelon juice that looks great). The tapioca has a good consistency and mild flavor, personally I think the amount they put in is just right.\n\nSo far my favorites I've tried - Milk Black, Milk Green, Wu-Long Tea, and Winter Melon tea. My BF has gotten mocha, coffee, and chocolate flavors and those have been rich and tasty. I have tried a few others I haven't liked as much - Sesame (was a bit gritty) and Yogurt (a bit too sour). I also LOVE that you can request they make it less sweet - often times my main complaint with boba drinks is that they are too sugary. I know they are supposed to be sweet but I appreciate that there are options here.\n\nDecor is clean, bright, cheery, but I rarely see anyone sitting/hanging out in here. As others have said it seems like more of a to-go place, which is fine. Employees are friendly and give good service. Prices standard for boba, start at $2.50 (for basic tea) and range up to $5-ish for the juice/smoothie drinks.\n\n Yay for Sweet Hut!", "author": "Remi X."}

No questionable syrup containers, no unknown ingredients, no suspicious powders; just a delicious fresh beverage.\n\nAs a service to you, here is how to read their versatile yet somewhat unorthodoxly presented menu. I happened to stroll in off-peak, and the charming young lady behind the counter enthusiastically shared the following with me:\n\nTea section: Means what you think it means. Your favorite type of tea plus fruit plus milk (you have a choice here between whole milk, half-and-half, as well as soy milk, which means that you can have vegan drinks too!)\n\nFlavor section: The ingredients listed in this area are blended up with Coffee Mate. And when they say \"flavor\" what they mean is actual fresh fruit, down to fresh taro.\n\nJuice section: This basically lists what I would call \"smoothies\". I had the mango-coconut, and it was incredibly delicious.\n\nSlushie(?): I can't remember what this section was called exactly, but that part is self-explanatory.\n\nThey also have a small selection of fried foods which I have not personally tried.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out once more that your drink is entirely customizable and can be made VEGAN.\n\nTo those of you already decrying the \"terrible customer service\": Waah waah waah. Yes, this place gets busy during weekend afternoons, especially due to the $1.99 promotion, and yes, maybe they need better (or any at all) signage that tells you where exactly you are supposed to form a line, but these guys are working hard, and fresh fruit blended beverages just take a little extra time. \n\nThey also sell you an experience: They are the Starbucks of bubble tea if you will, with their neatly displayed fruit containers and clean and open preparation area. If instead you're looking for impersonal, quick-and-dirty artificial beverages, and some greasy old couches to sit on, I have just the chain store for you.

Not bad, the pearls were a little too sweet, and I found it interesting that my tea was poured out of a plastic gallon-jug (a bit weird, but I guess when my tea is usually ladled out of the huge buckets, there's not much difference).  \n\nThe more I think about it, though, the sweeter the pearls get.  It was actually a little difficult for me to finish my drink after I ordered it, and I always finish my tea (if not always my pearls).\n\nWhen I went, last month, they had the installations open and waiting for Fro-Yo machines, so probably something to look forward too!  I'll definitely be stopping by again in the future, see if  I can get them to ease up a bit in the sweetness (pearls were great in texture, just a bit cloying).", "author": "Emilynne A."}

Their $1.99 grand opening special was enjoyable and I'm upset I didn't take advantage of it more. They're regular priced drinks are about ~$3. At least now the line doesn't come out past the door...\n\nI came here when it first opened so the employees were still a bit nervous and uncomfortable. What made it even more awkward is that the girl who took my order had a hard time understanding English. I ordered oolong milk tea but received an almond milk tea instead (she remade it for me, though). It was a bit bland, eh. It lacked actual tea flavor and I regretted ordering it.\n\nTheir milk tea is a bit generic but I do prefer it over Quickly's which is a few blocks away. I like that their taro milk tea, but my ultimate favorite is jasmine milk tea. I ordered it with \"less-sweet\" and \"more-tea\" but it ended up tasting the same to me. The girl who made my drink was the same girl that messed up my drink the first time, so perhaps that's why.\n\nHOWEVER, their popcorn chicken is really good and is hilariously named \"salt and paper chicken\" on their menu. Try not to laugh when you order it. Comes with real basil leaves, crunchy breading, and the chicken even stays hot and juicy!\n\nI hope that they switch to the sealing lids that Quickly and most tapioca joints use. I don't like the old-school plastic lids because the drinks tend to leak if they're too full. I once dropped my drink (my fault) which resulted in the lid popping off and spilling my whole drink...\n\nThey open as late as 11PM which is a plus.

BUT, it has become that if you order the good old original milk tea with boba, you may not always get a fresh drink or your own individual drink.  \n\nmeaning, they premix and preshake a regular milk tea and for some reason uses a shaker that serves more than one milk tea.  so if no one orders another milk tea after the first person orders it, the left over milk tea goes to the next person who orders it.  and that maybe 1 min, 5 min, 10 min and so on. premixed with the ice, sitting there.  getting watery and flat and warm. blah...\n\ni don't know about you, but i don't want a premixed drink with ice that's been sitting around for a while.  come on now, you're different because you hand mix each drink. i am fine waiting for a min or two that it takes to mix the tea with the cream.  so stop the bad habit and use a smaller shaker for the regular milk tea.  stop giving us left overs from someone else's drink.\n\nguys, tell them you want a fresh drink.", "author": "Food Is L."}

My first drink from Here was an avocado snow and I'm not sure if it was because the place was new or what but I don't think the guys working there knew how much avocado to stick into the drink and the drink was really thick and rich with avocado. I went back to have it a second time and it was les thick but still delicious. They give you a ton of boba and I really liked how they used fresh ingredients rather than mixing powders like how Quicklys does it. I also had their honey green tea ans it was pretty good as well. It's just too bad after their promotion was over all the drinks went back to regular price and boy were they really pricy. That we.avocado snow was around $4.50! I can barely spend so much on a 16oz drink!

We ordered milk tea tapioca and salt and \"paper\" chicken. We got the drinks quickly, but they forgot about our chicken. We told them after about 10 minutes of waiting and they took another 5-10 minutes to make it. While we waited, the cashier offered two free drinks because of our long wait! That definitely made up for it. \n\nAlthough the chicken was unique in taste, it was amazing! I normally don't like popcorn chicken that much but this one gets a thumbs up from me. Also, the tapioca seemed to be very caffeinated. My brother said that's \"authentic\" but I've had authentic milk tea, and it did not taste like this. Either way, it was not bad, but a little strong.\n\nMy favorite drinks are the fruit smoothies, they are amazing! They are definitely REAL fruit and you can definitely taste it. Right now, it is $2.50 per fruit smoothie, I can see them raising the price AT LEAST to $3.50 soon because drinks that are this fresh and natural are not worth only $2.50 nowadays.", "author": "S Z."}

One girl came in complaining about a drink, then the owner got mad at the drink-maker. 10 seconds later, the associate storms out cursing the establishment. So line is twice as long and they are down one man. I saw him making my drink, but then he gives it to the complaining girl---which is fine, but he should make mine again immediately. \n\nAll these people were nagging \"I'm waiting for my watermelon and taro\" or \"I asked for soy milk---is this soy milk?\" and I didn't get my drink. Finally, I go up to the counter, and he notices I have been waiting for a while. He makes my drink---puts it in the wrong cup, gives it to somebody else. 25 minutes after I pay my, I get my drink.
