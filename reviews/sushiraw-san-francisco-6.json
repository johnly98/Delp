As I'm trying to think if something to eat sushi pops up in my head. I think to myself that sounds bomb.com right now. Its about 10pm mind you so I start looking for sushi places on yelp thinking I would be out of luck. I came upon sushi raw and. saw that they were open till midnight which is rare and I was pretty excited about that! I start looking at the review and to be quite honest they're a mix of reviews however the good out-weighed the bad. Mind you I'm not a huge fan of sushi but everyone in a while I like to have some.\n\nNow on to the good part..... the food!\nMy friend and I got the Deep fried spicy tuna roll= my favorite of the night! not too spicy either\nMiso soup = pretty good not too salty\nCalifornia hand roll= interesting concept think of it like an ice cream come but with sushi in it? and the \"cone\" is wrapped in seaweed. It was good your basic California roll \nSpicy scallop roll= good not great  \n\nOverall the service was good and so was the food. I definitely would come back again and its a bonus that they're open late!", "author": "Eva B."}

Perfect for after a baseball game or NBA game! \n\nSecond, this place has GREAT sashimi. It's super fresh, not chewy (which I've had bad experiences with other places before), and just tastes really good! I've had their chirashi bowl once and it was so delicious. The fish is very fresh and the rice they serve with it complements the fish very well, it's like sushi rice. \n\nI also love their bento boxes. It comes with a good amount of food. The tempura is really delicious, especially the vegetable tempura. The chicken is slightly crispy, and the teriyaki sauce is not overwhelming, which is good. \n\nMy boyfriend and I always go here if we need a late dinner, because it's the only place open that sells good Japanese food. Parking is not too bad, all street parking. Service is good, I've never had issues with the service here.", "author": "Nikki P."}

You never know what you'll get with 3.5ers, and it seems like the complaints for Sushiraw are a pretty good mix of slow service, sushi quality, and cleanliness. I'd say in terms of quality, don't come here if you're looking for a fancy, expensive sushi experience. Come here if you're just craving sushi or you're hungry. So keep that in mind.\n\nI personally loved Sushiraw. I came here with my SO after a long day at work, on a cold, misty night. It was quiet and laid-back, and the server seemed friendly enough. \n\nWe ordered the sashimi combo, the chicken udon, the devil mountain roll, and the shrimp tempura roll. The sashimi combo was alright and I loved the chicken udon. The broth was flavorful and the chicken was tender, although I did wish there was another fish cake (there was only one). We loved the devil mountain and the shrimp tempura rolls! They were super tasty. Also, the presentation is pretty cool--the sashimi plate came on a light up tray! And the other rolls we ordered were pretty neatly arranged.\n\nI'd say the only downsides were that the sashimi combo wasn't the freshest, and I did think the chicken udon was a little heavy on the vegetables and could've used more chicken and fish cake.\n\nOverall though, this place is pretty good for being a sushi place in the sunset at these prices. Some people come in expecting Jiro Dreams of Sushi, and this just isn't that kind of place. So, you get what you pay for and if you want the best sushi in the world, of course you're going to be disappointed.", "author": "Claire C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-20", "description": "Have you ever passed by a place so often that you kind of forget about them?  More than a little nonsensical to say, but pretty true for me and SushiRaw.  It's nothing against them; they just happened to blur into the background as I would pass by every day on my way to my old job.  As we aimlessly drove around in search of a late dinner though?  They sure did stand out, especially since we had a hankering for some sushi!\n\nStepping inside, the first thing that struck me was how much nicer this location was compared to their old spot in San Bruno.  Granted, it was a low bar to clear (the other one still reminded me of the Taco Bell that used to be there), but I like the dark decor and tinted windows.  More importantly though, the menu here looks a whole lot better.  Not only does it cover a wider range (sushi, sashimi, bento boxes, starters, udon, etc.), but it seems like there are more choices than I remember the other location have, especially with their rolls.\n\n-- FUJI MOUNTAIN ROLL - Lobster Salad, Avocado, Mango Baked with Crab Meat, Scallop Spicy Sauce, and Tobiko...$16.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushiraw-san-francisco-6?select=bQtXHd_UXDk7bChNeo7Mgw)\nIt may not have added to the dish, but it was pretty cool to see them set the dish on fire.  In any case, this was pretty solid.  Despite not being able to taste the mango, I liked the mix of flavors from the lobster salad, avocado, and crab meat.\n\n-- ROMEO & JULIET ROLL - Salmon and Avocado topped with Fresh Scallops, Tobiko, and Mayo and wrapped with a Soy Paper Wrap...$13.95\n-- HOTATEGAI - Scallop Nigiri...$6.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushiraw-san-francisco-6?select=r9GyFlqPoEtvyGmVyFmR_Q)\nI was looking for a roll that was relatively light and the Romeo & Juliet did the trick!  Both the scallops and salmon were really fresh and there wasn't a ton of sauce.  As for the Hotategai, I didn't plan on more scallops, but I'm glad I did.  Not only was the cut pretty large, but it was really tasty!\n\n-- HAMACHI NIGIRI...$6.25\n-- ROMEO & JULIET ROLL...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushiraw-san-francisco-6?select=M_A-TTfdTtJoLH8DVkfMuw)\nHaving already tried their hotate and sake sashimi/nigiri, I only had the hamachi left to try.  All in all...not bad.  The cut was both generous and fresh, but this wasn't the most flavorful one I've had.  As for the Romeo & Juliet roll, it was just about as good as the first time around.\n\n-- SESAME CHICKEN - Deep Fried Chicken Japanese Style with Spicy Sauce...$6.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushiraw-san-francisco-6?select=Enps7aCSuLliCEoaNXkycA)\nHonestly, this just wasn't very good.  Not only did every piece have more batter than chicken, but they weren't all that flavorful either.  Had I known the \"sesame\" was just a ton of seeds dumped into the aioli, I wouldn't have bothered with this.\n\n-- SAKE SASHIMI...$11.95 (or $6 if you order $25 or more)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushiraw-san-francisco-6?select=ADVTNp_0JpMII-8M1P_JlQ)\nWhile they may not have been the prettiest of slices (a little uneven and a couple looked a little \"torn\"), this certainly tasted the part!  As with the scallops and the hamachi, the salmon was both fresh and tasty.\n\nConsidering all of the restaurants that have passed through this space in the years since the old ZIm's closed, it's great how SushiRaw has found continued success over the years.  Whether it's day or not, it seems like there are always at least a handful of folks grabbing a bite here whenever I pass by.  What's more, it seems like they do a steady amount of to-go business as well, as I saw a ton of people stop in to pick up orders.\n\nAll in all, despite some of the things I tried not amazing, SushiRaw isn't too shabby.  The food is decent, prices are fair, service is fine, parking isn't hard, seating isn't tough, and they're one of the few Japanese joints around that's open late (until midnight).  It may not be the type of place you make a point of going to, but they sure are handy to have around!", "author": "Mike L."}

I had only been to this location one time before and enjoyed it but with so many other options wasn't compelled to come back. In the last 5 years they've remodeled their inside and definitely upped their game because this place is solid. \n\nAll the nigiri i had was incredibly fresh, highlighted t the always stunning sake belly. The fish was perfectly presented and lush in color with a great ratio of plump meat to soft rice. \n\nBoth rolls I tried were also knockouts. The City Roll was a complex play on texture with crispy soft shell crab, succulent yellow tail, and fatty avocado. It towed the line between over the top American and more traditional in a way that really spoke to me. \n\nThe Mexican Desert Roll was more rich and absolutely awesome. Perfectly presented with little slides of jalape\u00f1o and dabs of hot sauce atop squishy imitation crab and seared smoky albacore. It legit tasted like sushi nachos and I would order it again in a second. \n\nService was great and they even brought out a big bowl of mango ice cream for my brothers birthday.

The mango was a good addition and the seaweed salad was really crunchy and delicious.  The Shrimp Tempura and Chicken Teriyaki Roll were both also quite good. I like the Swamp Roll the least - I think because it only had the sweet potato in it and just wasn't complex enough.\n\nIf you purchase $20 off the menu then they have a special menu which you can order something else off of for cheaper which is cool (a small beer for example is only $2).\n\nIt looked like they had some really fun specials too - like a LIVE urchin, and other sashimi platters served on ice with lights (advantage of sitting at the bar - sight seeing). \n\nThe way they managed the making of sushi was interesting. They made some of ours and then they paused, made other peoples, and then made more of ours.

This place has been on the corner of Taraval and 19th for as long as I can remember. With so many other sushi options around, I never thought to try out Sushi Raw. The other night the bf wanted a lighter meal for dinner, so he suggested Sushi Raw. Apparently he'd gone with a friend not too long ago, and it wasn't bad in terms of price and quality. \n\nWe came by on a Friday night around...9? It was late and way past a typical dinner time, but the place was pretty busy. We got seated at the bar right away and served up menus and tea. They have like 3 menus, and they're quite extensive. Nigiri, rolls, appetizers, udon (I think), donburi and some other Japanese dishes. \n\nWe ordered some nigiri (hamachi belly, hotate, tai and maguro) and two rolls (I don't remember exactly which two, but I think one was the tuna lover's). We also ordered 2 eel hand rolls and 1 spicy tuna hand roll from their special \"if you spend over $30, you get these items for $1-2\" menu (dine-in only). Our total was somewhere in the $45 range, which isn't bad for sushi.\n\nThe nigiri wasn't half bad! They give you pretty big slices of fish and the rice is passable. They do put some sauces on the nigiri and also put wasabi IN the nigiri, so that's another nice surprise. The quality of fish for the nigiri is decent for what you're paying, though I feel like the pieces of fish are a bit too big. That's just my preference -- It kind of makes me want to gag when it's just a huge piece of raw fish (especially if it's not the fresher fish out there). Rolls and nigiri came out quickly and presented nicely (I'm sorry for the overuse of \"nice\"). \n\nOverall service wasn't bad, though we never got our tea refilled (even after asking) and it took forever to wave down someone to get us the check =/\n\nDecent nigiri and good selection of rolls makes Sushi Raw a viable option for sushi.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-28", "description": "Our choices came down to 3 Japanese restaurants for delivery.  Sushiraw is a place we had never tried so we gave it a go.  The prices were average to high, but through the Yelp reviews, I gathered that they had a reputation for good taste and quality.  We ordered a variety of 8 sushi rolls, ranging from the lower priced California Roll to the pricier Dragon Roll and an order of Chicken Udon.  For a Tuesday evening, delivery was fairly quick (35-40 mins).  The sushi looked great and tasted very fresh.  It wasn't soggy or overly sauced, the rolls that had a crunchy element, such as the Salmon Skin Roll, were actually crunchy.  The only average item seemed to be the udon.  There was nothing special about it.  If you want really good sushi for delivery, I would highly recommend Sushiraw.  We will definitely be ordering from them again.", "author": "Mel P."}

Mainly because the place is a Poke-Gym and I was really down to battle while I waited for my food, but also because I didn't feel like I could accurately review this place unless I actually sat in the establishment and experienced all it's glory. \n\nThe food is good. Standard sushi for a standard price with delicious miso to match. I ordered the Taraval Street Roll ($9.25), which I think is delicious with tempura, mango and cilantro all working your tastebuds in perfect harmony. I also have tried the Philly Roll (standard) and the Dragon Roll (good, but not fantastic for $12.25). The food gets a thumbs up.\n\nHowever, the service was less-than-to-be-desired. Our waitress was brusque and all my food arrived about 10 minutes later than my friend's. I was hungry and even pokemon couldn't distract me from the long, unnecessary wait.\n\nNeedless to say, next time I will skip the dine-in experience and looking presentable, and just order take-out again where I can stay home and watch Netflix in peace.", "author": "Anna P."}

They were very basic, not bad but not in any way extraordinary. At least the cali rolls were kinda big. \n\nBecause we had an older over $15, we added an unagi hand roll for $1 (special deal). \n\nThere were two waitresses working.

They're open until midnight on weekdays, which is pretty darn late for a sushi place! \n\nPleasant decor with dark wooden tables, hanging lantern style lights, and a mixture of booth, table, and sushi bar seating. The windows are tinted to help shield you from the bright car lights on 19th Ave. and maintain the dim lighting and warm ambiance of the restaurant. \n\nAll the rolls are very Americanized, on the larger side, and heavy on the rice. The fish didn't taste super fresh and I felt like the quality wasn't there. No clean and distinct flavors stood out to me. I found the Lion King Roll particularly disappointing because it didn't taste fully baked through or creamy like most other places. It only had cooked salmon on top. \n\nOur server wasn't pushy about getting us out of the restaurant even though we were there 15 mins past closing, but she wasn't exactly attentive with refilling our waters or punctual about asking if we wanted the check later either. \n\nPrices are pretty good and the rolls aren't bad, but if you're looking for authentic, fresh tasting sushi, this is not it.

Prices are decent, but they offer a cheaper menu with every $15 dollar you spend (ex. $5 for 5 thick slices of salmon). I personally don't like the rolls as much and I would stay away from the lion king. It's not baked in an oven and doesn't even come out in foil so it doesn't taste the same as the other places I'm used to. The raw oysters are also always super tiny; on my recent trip I got one that was a size of a quarter. \nI do recommend ordering the sashimi and nigiri, they offer generous cuts and they're always fresh. Uni nigiri is priced at $8, unfortunately they don't pile on the uni, but it's enough to satisfy my cravings. \n\nAlthough the place is fairly small, there's usually barely any wait for two people even during the prime dinner time at 7pm.

Also in the Philadelphia roll, the smoked salmon was pretty nasty (and I love lox). Also the walu on another roll that I had was not terribly fishy but not great, kind of mushy, no firmness to it. I ended up throwing these away. So ya, good cooked sushi but in the end of the day, you gotta have really quality raw fish to be a good sushi restaurant.

Upon arrival, our normal waitress who had always been there was not present; and the chefs we knew who worked behind the sushi bar were also missing. That's alright, restaurants have high turnover rates.\n\nAt some point during the meal, my father asked the waiter whether there is any yakisoba type noodle dish on the menu. We've been coming here on-and-off for 2 years and I knew the answer to that question was more than likely going to be no; but hey, there is no harm in asking right? What if the menu was changed? The waiter rolled his eyes, said a curt \"no\", and walked away. I thought that was going to be the end of it. My glance followed the waiter and this is what I witnessed next. He walked over to the other waitress on the floor, shot a sideway glance towards my father, scoffed, and said in Cantonese: \"what an ignorant man\" at a volume loud enough for me - which means also for my father, mother, Boyfriend, and the next table - to hear.\n\nI have scoffed and mocked people n my life so I am not trying to come off as holier-than-thou. However, I have never ever done it in public and I definitely have never done it while I was working or in a professional environment. And regardless, my father did nothing to deserve this blatant display of disrespect; he asked a very simple question that any Joe Schmoe could just as easily have asked in that situation. So let me ask, mr. waiter, what about my father's question irritated you so much so that you had to react this way? And mr. waiter, even though I don't work in the food industry, let me offer you a piece of advice, the next time you feel the need to disrespect a person who pays your salary and your tip (20% in this case), don't.", "author": "Karen S."}

After the 2013 Color Run, our party of 5 was craving something light for lunch (or so we thought). We had planned on dining at Sushi Zen, but our hunger got the best of us--the more convenient, eye-catching Sushi Raw got our business.\n\nDespite the affordable lunch specials, we decided to go family style with 4 rolls and some Big Discount items (described below).\n\nWe first chose the ISLAND ROLL with tuna, salmon, and yellow tail wrapped with cucumber, 6 pieces for $12.99 (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VoBBC_Z9yH2uIaZQhzsexQ/l.jpg). The combination was refreshing, although the cucumber was not that crisp and the fish were not markedly fresh. Since this is a light roll, eat this first because its flavor can be easily overpowered!\n\nNext was the FOUR SEASONS ROLL with eel, imitation crab, and avocado topped with tuna and avocado, 8 pieces for $12.99 (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d71TaWul4vjL-oIbw2uc3w/l.jpg). This was my favorite by far...EXCEPT FOR THE WASABI SAUCE. AUGH. They drizzle it on top with the other sauces, but because I have an aversion to wasabi, it totally killed my palate :(\n\nThird was the TARAVAL STREET ROLL with eel, shrimp tempura, imitation crab meat, cilantro, and mango, topped with tobiko, 6 pieces for $8.99 (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5fGG2OQ6tgVzHbvU6WNoiQ/l.jpg). This is a good, reliable roll, though the mango is not very noticeable. Gotta love that shrimp tempura though!\n\nLast was the HOT SUMMER ROLL with spicy tuna topped with crab meat, salmon, and baked with spicy sauce and tobiko, 8 pieces for $12.99 (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/chB1j_Q8rzFnGwu7a_iVxA/l.jpg). The stringy red things on top were very interesting texture-wise, but the crab meat and spicy tuna overpowered the subtlety of the salmon.\n\nFor every $15 ordered off the regular menu, you get the option to choose an item off the Big Discount menu (borrowing Jessica C's picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-raw-san-francisco-3?select=GbuCLrQRKTIfUm9ue_ZgzQ#93Snh8xG0eUMkiLS4qRc9w). Since we had ordered over $45, we chose 3 items: UNAGI HAND ROLL for $1 (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MzsP_bAr1K-0v-IZyN005g/l.jpg), SPICY TUNA HAND ROLL for $1 (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OEtkgaDNi7yYFJ8muZH78g/l.jpg), and SEAWEED SALAD for $2, normally $4.99. The spicy tuna was fantastic.\n\nOur total bill was $52, which came out to $13 per person. After a morning of colorrific running that cost each of us $50, having a decent lunch at less than a third of that price was pretty good. The rolls aren't mind-blowing, but I would recommend the TARAVAL STREET ROLL, $8.99, and the FOUR SEASONS ROLL, $12.99, as long as you don't mind the overpowering wasabi sauce (or ask for it on the side).", "author": "Adele F."}

Initially, we were impressed with the attentive and friendly service, tastiness of the entrees and the good value.  Unfortunately, the restaurant has gone downhill until the final straw when we felt they no longer valued our business and walked out of the restaurant (more about that later).  As stated, our initial experiences were very positive.  Portions were generous and the service was attentive and friendly.  However, we slowly noticed a deterioration of the service, friendliness and the food.  For example, when we ordered the tonkatsu bento, we would receive two cutlets.  But more recently, it has been reduced to a single cutlet.  Although probably  better for us in the long run, we felt that we were treated inconsistently.  The final straw was when we (party of 4) arrived around 6 pm on a Friday evening.  There were 3 people in the whole restaurant but they tried to seat us by the front door next to a table with a young baby.  I wanted to avoid the draft coming in the front door whenever people entered and didn't want to sit that close to a young baby and asked if we could sit at one of the open tables by the window.  The waitress said they could not do that because they would not be able to split the tables IF 2 groups of 2 came in.  There was no reservations, but they were planning for the possible contingency.  Ok, we are not ones to linger - we eat and run.  Yet, they would rather have us leave than to try to accommodate us.  No apology or anything.  This was surprising given that we have been visiting every week.  In view of their attitude, we will accommodate them and won't be back.", "author": "Will L."}

It tasted great, but could have really used some heat.\n\nLooking over the menu there are so many options, we settled on a special that came with California Sushi Roll, Sashimi, Miso and Salad. \n\nThe Miso and Salad came to us very quickly. Soup was tastey but nothing unusual. The salad however was a little disappointing. The lettuce was either old or had been frozen, the leaves were basically translucent and limp. The dressing did taste good, peanut-y but the lettuce just ruined it for us.\n\nCalifornia Roll was well put together, slightly over-sized, but smaller then others I've had. I prefer the smaller size as they fit better into the mouth.\n\nSashimi was fresh and beautiful, just as it should be. Cut wonderfully and laid over slightly sweet sticky rice it was a beautiful addition to the meal. All the fish had a soft texture, some event buttery. Each carried their own unique flavor and needed little to no soy sauce.\n\nThis is a nice little spot for late-night sushi and I would happily return.", "author": "Meghan L."}

It wasn't crazy busy, but my food took longer compared to the rest of my party.  I had ordered sushi whereas most of the table had ordered ramen.  However, some still had rolls too.  Anyways, the service is pretty meh, but I really enjoyed the food.  They had a really good special that offered cheaper items for every $15 you spent as a party.  There were some great deals like $1 handrolls, $2 beers, or $5 sashimi.  I had the Double Hamachi maki as my main.  It was really good combining fried and seared hamachi.  Really nice combo.

The handrolls were pretty good too, I liked their spicy tuna hand roll, and the unagi was not bad too.

I usually skip the soy paper and ask them to use seaweed.\n\nI like this place only because it's pretty cheap. The sushi is not super fresh or anything, but worth the price.

This place is hard to find parking here since it's on 19th and Taraval. I guess we came here for a late lunch (1pm almost 2) so the place wasn't so crowded. Gotta love how quiet the restaurant is despite the fact that it's at the intersection of two busy streets in the Sunset.\n\nOrdered a variety of nigiri:  otoro, uni, aji, sake, waru, hotate, hamachi, and ika; also ordered two oysters for $2 from their HH menu. The oysters wasn't anything special, I believe it was the miyagi oysters from the look of the size. For such cheap pricing, I'm very happy to not find any sand in them. Bravo on the prep. Their sushi was average, with some tasting fresh and some are so-so. Their otoro that day was on point, the fattiness just melts in my mouth instantly.  Uni and sake were fresh too, no weird after taste, the colors were bright and welcoming. Maybe a bit too welcoming, I feel like I enjoyed them a bit too quickly. The others were just so-so for the quality. I've only been here once, so I can't really tell you how consistent are their sushi.\n\nOverall, the pricing isn't that bad. Certain items are going to be market price like otoro, otherwise the nigiri are priced around $5-7 per two pieces. Not a bad price for what they serve.

And that's being nice. \n\nWent here over the summer with a friend of mine. Dinner time just started so there were probably 2 other parties with us. I ordered miso soup and a roll while he ordered two rolls. Both of his came out first before I even got my soup. Uhm. Really? Soup is supposed to be the first thing that comes out. Anyway, I wait. Thinking it'll come out soon. I keep sitting there and the waitresses are just chatting with each other so I ask one of them for my soup and I said I also ordered a roll.\n\nShe said she would bring the soup out and did so, but 20 mins later the roll NEVER CAME. I got fed up and didn't want to wait any longer even after I reminded them so we paid the bill and left a dollar tip, which was more than they deserved.\n\nHow the hell do you completely forget someone's order?

Woke up at 10:30 pm starving. Nothing else was on my mind but sushi, so I decided to turn to Yelp in hopes of finding a place still open! Most late-night sushi places that were 4 stars were still open were located in downtown. Not wanting to travel so far, I opted for Sushi Raw. \n\nLocated on the corner/busy streets of 19th Ave and Taraval, I always avoided this place. Maybe cause the place seemed big outside and the sign made it seem janky. Entering, I was quite surprised. The interior looked very modern-chick with a black and red theme to it. The size of the place is quite small, so I wouldn't recommend bringing parties of 5 or more. The sign outside does no justice! Seriously, change the font, Sushi Raw. \n\nThe service was okay, but don't expect it to be authentic sushi. I heard the chef behind the sushi counter speak Chinese. No, not rumors or reviews, like I literally heard them speak! Haha. It was nice of the server to give us water as we waited for our food. My bf and I ordered 3 sushi rolls (Taraval Street Roll, Lion King Roll, Unagi), and we ended up getting an order of California rolls for free!...or so they say. According to one yelper, for every $15 you spend, they will sell you one special item for $1. Not so bad, at least it isn't the regular price. I find it quite interesting, cause it's like you get more than what you paid for! In a way.. \n\nThe food itself was mediocre. My bf ordered the Taraval Street Roll ($9), and he enjoyed it. He thought the rice was good, compared to other sushi restaurants; like the rice was just the right amount of stickyness. I tasted one of his rolls and it was good. I ordered (2) Unagi ($4.50 ea) and it was nothing special. Tasted like any other Unagi but it did satisfy my cravings for it. I also ordered the Lion King Roll (typical; $12), and it was good. I think out of all the LKR's I've tried, this one would be a little on the better side. I think for the quality of the food, the price is a bit pricey. \n\nOverall, I think this place would make a good late night place to eat if you're craving for sushi. Keep in mind, they close at midnight! They're mediocre but pricey.", "author": "Mandy G."}

Hiromi's song and dance in the pivotal role of \"Eugene\" (Hiromi was also \"Pete\" in The Thursday and Saturday production) was quite impressive.  Given that Hiromi is also All-City in football and the choice as MC for school events ...

Given that he was scheduled to drive his other daughter to Santa Cruz later, the gang opted for \"Sushi Raw,\" and I bet you were all wondering when I was going to get to that.\n\nWonder no more.  Given that Fujita-san (who is opening at a new restaurant in SSF in the next month or so, details when it opens of course) is Sushi Chef All-Pro, I thought it was somewhat of a curious selection but I think it was location driven.  When we arrived, there was rock star parking across the street and this feed the  meter on Sundays thing has got to go.  It was mid to late afternoon, there was just one other couple there and yes it's quite the lengthy menu with little bonuses driven by the purchase amounts.  How so?\n\nWell I ordered a ton katsu and tempura combination which entitled you to some tuna sashimi for a couple of bucks extra.  Then since it passed the $15 threshold, I had the option of an unagi hand roll for $1.  Service was slightly stilted but reasonably attentive.  Food was attractively presented, ton katsu was quite tender and well-fried, tempura was okay, the shrimp was kind of limp but they are good at frying foods and tempura-izing here.  The maguro sashimi was quite good, very fresh and the texture was perfect.  $20 for all of that, the rice was well-prepared and I would eat at \"Sushi Raw\" again.\n\nBut I am waiting for Yoshihiko Fujita's new restaurant to open ...", "author": "Terry A."}

Good thing I wasn't super hungry because there was only one waitress and the restaurant was half full. The waitress sat us down and gave us the menus, then she came back about 5 minutes later and gave us waters. I waited for her to come back to ask her for some straws for the waters, but she did not come back for another 10minutes. The waitress kept on speed walking and dragging her feet back and forth between tables and from the back, it was a little weird. She finally came over and took our orders, and brought our straws. It took about another 20 minutes for our food to come out, and I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the salmon teriyaki rice plate ($10), and I swear when I first looked at it I thought it looked like an appetizer. The portion was tiny with a small serving of rice, two small salmon strips and salad. We were about to start eating until we realized the waitress didn't give us any forks. I understand that it's a sushi restaurant, but not everyone eats with only chopsticks, and I know that it's even harder to eat salmon with chopsticks. My boyfriend actually ended up going up to the waitress and having to ask for forks because we were just sick of sitting there and waiting for her to come back. The food was okay, I think the service just killed my whole experience there. Our bill came up to about $50 for three people (no appetizers).

Another reason is they are not busy at all and after my interaction with them today it explains everything.  When I got home we noticed that we are missing an item from our order.  I quickly called them and they kept speaking Chinese and said it is in the other box but nothing in the two boxes had unagi.  They kept speaking Chinese and even said come back and get it then (very rude).  In the background as I was talking to the person on the phone she kept asking the person in Chinese what can we do and they said it is in the box.

Other times I have gotten what looked and tasted like Albacore and it was good too. It's 9 pieces total.\n\nWhat I did not care for much was the ramen and the bento box. Both were very ordinary and nothing to rave about. If you crave ramen, go to Japantown. And most places will have better bento box with larger portions and better tasting mackerel. \n\nI'm giving 4 stars because the fish is fresh and better than the other Japanese restaurants near my house.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-01-08", "description": "Typical Chinese run Sushi joint. There's a certain characteristic with this type, and it is the opposite of authenticity, and quality. This is not to say this place severely lacks in these two areas, but if you ever had good sushi from a Japanese owned bar, you will note differences.\n\nI love Chinese food, when it is prepared by Chinese. I love Japanese food, when it is prepared Japanese. This place (turning into a chain) is run by Chinese, and as such lacks the skill in rolling sushi (there's no demand to roll it perfect), specialty rolls are drenched in heavy sauces that masks the level of freshness of the fish, and mediocre quality sliced sashimi.  We ordered a variety of rolls, sashimi, hamachi kama, and their ramen to give a thorough test-run.\n\nRolls were not neatly rolled, and contained too much rice. Nothing special about any of them.\n\nSashimi selection were maguro, sake, and yellow tail. My issue was the maguro, as it was veiny, and therefore chewy. Sake was good, as was the yellow tail.\n\nHamachi kama were small, and lacked the tender freshness that I come to expect after having it so often. Later, I saw the sushi chef repack what looked to be frozen hamachi kama. Could be, or not, but it would explain why it was just okay.\n\nThe ramen. After being spoiled by Santa Ramen, and Ramen Dojo, I thought I'd have difficult time liking any other restaurant's ramen. This one just plain sucked. Broth was too sweet, ramen too soft, and the pork was just meh.\n\nThis leads me to my low expectations, and general disdain for these types of restaurants. Japanese cuisine itself commands a higher premium in cost, and therefore a higher profit margin. I just feel that Sushi Raw, and others like it are serving sushi to make the money. There is no inherent art form to sushi prep, ramen, and insistence for fresh fish. Service by the two Chinese waitresses uttering a few Japanese phrases were okay, but not great service. We decided not to come back again, and would rather walk up a block to Shi Mo for the real deal. It costs a little more, but is well worth it. \n\nIf you are the buffet-loving type, you may give this a 4 star, since high quality isn't in your expectations. I give this place a 2.5, as the food was just meh, service was okay, and ambiance was nice, but trendy.", "author": "Bor C."}

I thought the food was about average-price for a Japanese restaurant and the service was pretty good; the waitresses - very nice.\n\nI think the 3 selection bento boxes are worth $13.95 since there are over ten choices to choose from. The beef, beef short ribs, and sushi are all good. The tempura batter is one of the best in my opinion, I like my tempura cooked where the fried parts are flaky not the ones that are jagged and hurt when you take a bite into it.

I was starving and was happy that we were immediately seated and the waitress took our order right away.\n\nWe ordered the tuna poki, which was delicious, but tuna poki is kind of hard to screw up. The hamachi kama came out next, the sauce was amazing. Our first two dishes came out in a very timely manner, however, everything else took ridiculously long. We had to wait an hour before the waitress came out with our seaweed salad. YES, AN HOUR! Seaweed salad comes already made!! All they had to do was put it on a place and bring it to our table!! Absolutely inexcuseable! When I asked the waitress about our orders, she ran to the back and checked. She came back and apologized and told us that the rest of our food would have a high priority with the chef. She was very nice and apologized many times for the mistake.\n\nAlthough the food was very good (not OUTSTANDING, but still, very good) and the service would have been excellent if it wasnt for our server's error, I have to give it 2 stars because bad service at a restaurant is one of my biggest pet peeves. \n\nTo be honest, I was iffy about whether or not Sushi Raw deserved a 2 or 3 star rating, but I decided to go with 2 starts because \"Meh.

Makes me unsure if Sushi Raw will be here much longer either after my experience...\n\nThe decision - My wife and I had vowed to continue to goto our favorite neighborhood sushi place further down the street on Taraval but this past weekend we decided to order some sushi for delivery from Sushi Raw. It was raining and we were pooped out from a long weekend of snowboarding in Tahoe. We had received a flyer in our mailbox for some specials and free delivery since we live very close so we went for it.\n\nThe order experience - I'm a big fan of technology so I went to order online, but their online menu/ordering system is painfully slow. I could have gone to the store and made my own sushi faster than ordering online. Don't do it. We decided to call in and order and pay with CC over the phone. It took my wife about 10 minutes to get the order correct, relay our CC info, and give them our address. That wasn't comforting and I wouldn't have been surprised if they got something wrong w/ the order. They quoted us 45 minutes on a Sunday night at 7:30pm for delivery. I felt that was a bit long especially since I could throw a rock and hit the place, plus I've never seen this place full/extremely busy whenever I walk by.\n\n45 minutes came and went. I was about to call and check then there was a knock at the door, 60 minutes after placing the order. Seemed a bit long, and if that kind of time has any relation to the time it would take if we were dining in, then I will never go back.\n\nThe food - We ordered the following; Red Dragon Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Lobster Roll, Tempura Appetizer, and received a free Spicy Tuna Roll. The Tempura was good, not great, and it definitely didn't help that it probably sat for several minutes getting soggy before it was sent out for delivery. The Red Dragon, Shrimp Tempura and Spicy Tuna rolls were okay, not the best I've ever had. The Lobster Roll was okay, mango and lobster don't really go together, and the cucumber wrap was so-so.  Overall the rolls were tiny, and definitely not worth the price in my opinion. Our order was over $40 for 3 rolls and an app w/ an hour wait.\n\nThe vote - I definitely won't be going back unless all my other choices for sushi are closed.  I would recommend going to get sushi from the happy people down the street at Sushi Zen if you live in the area.", "author": "Ryan D."}

Service was nice enough, but I definitely agree it's somewhat slow and hard to get the attention of the waitstaff. Plus we waited ages for the check (partly because our plates were removed so swiftly we would have had to call after her to ask for it). The food itself was pretty delicious, and we thought it was evenly priced with other sushi places in the city, but... turned out the rolls usually had six instead of the more standard eight pieces - not all of them, but most of them. So we would have ended up ordering more rolls than we normally would - but instead we went somewhere else afterward.", "author": "Amanda P."}

The location has always been very small, but they made the space look larger than it is and not at all crowded as it felt before. The decor is also nice and neat, while the best aspect is that, despite waiters and cooks being so close, you never feel like you are constantly \"under their watching eye\" while eating.\n\nAs for the food itself, it was good. We came quite hungry, so ordered a California roll and a bento special (tempura, chicken katsu and avocado rolls). The California rolls were good, although we were slightly disappointed that there wasn't eight as there was in the other sushi plates on that page. The tempura was very good. It had been awhile since we last had it, and were both impressed... in fact it kind of stole the show.\n\nAll in all, we were sold. The only drawback for us were the prices, which may or may not keep us from coming back. It wasn't expensive, to be clear, but there are cheaper sushi alternatives all through out SF. Still, we would be open to coming again someday.", "author": "Sami R."}

Because it was new, the whole place still smelled like the finishing they paint on wood to protect it.  After we were seated and got our menus, they gave us some complimentary edamane and miso soup.  \n\nI ordered the chicken teriyaki entree/bento box for $9.95.  It came with chicken teriyaki, tempura, and 3 pieces of sushi along with rice and a bowl of salad on the side. I thought the chicken teriyaki was great - very tender and juicy as well as flavorful.  Also, the sushi tasted very fresh, it was good quality salmon, tuna, and yellowtail.  The service was responsive and I thought my meal was a good value for the quality of the food.  \n\nMy friends ordered a spicy tuna roll and tempura udon, a salmon teriyaki entree/bento, and a 49ers roll.  I got to try a piece of the spicy tuna, and it was very good.  The tempura udon was a big bowl of udon and soup, but it didn't look very appealing because it was just noodles and soup with tempura on the side.  I think they need to add some veggies or fishcake in the udon to make it more appetizing.  The 49ers roll was 8 pieces of salmon over avocado and tobiko, but the pieces were tiny.  I didn't think it was a good deal since the roll was $9.95. \n\nMy conclusion is that the sushi is fresh and really good here, but some rolls are overpriced.  I'll probably stick with the entree/bento boxes.  Keep in mind that if you order the bento box option from the entrees menu page, it may save you a few dollars over ordering it from the bento box page.", "author": "Tyler C."}

I hope this one sticks through. This is one of the only late night sushi places around. Also this is one of the few healthy late night options.\n\nThe sushi here is decent. A bit overpriced (I'd opt to go Shimo or Okazu Ya since one has bigger cuts for the same price while the other is cheaper), but hell, its open late... \n\nThe tuna rolls were pretty normal, but good. The fish was of good quality and the rice texture was decent. Looking at the fish in the display, those were of also good quality. My gripe is on the price of their fish, which is kind of expensive for what you're getting \n\nI ordered the Salmon Teriyaki rice plate while my friend ordered the Saba Shioyaki. Both are pretty much grilled fish with some rice, salad and miso.\n\nThe miso was your standard miso soup... didn't have any green onions which was sad for me, but it tasted pretty normal. Nothing amazing, but then again I've never had amazing miso soup.\n\nThe salad was whatever. Didn't care so much for the dressing on it. Tasted almost like an Italian dressing or something\n\nThe salmon and saba portions were perfect for a post work out meal or just for any person who's trying to eat right. They both were grilled nicely and lightly seasoned. The saba also did not have as fishy a flavor as other saba that I've tried, which gets plus points in my book.\n\nThe rice is also of perfect portion control.  We opted for the sushi rice because it tastes better.\n\nOverall this place is ok. A bit overpriced for what you're getting but its an awesome late night spot to eat at for  the health conscious plus the portion control is good. I only wish they had brown rice. Since it is a healthy late night spot, I'll probably come back. However, there are better options for sushi around town if you're looking for lunch/dinner", "author": "Marc T."}

When we did get a hold of someone she didn't apologize for our missing order. She just asked if we wanted credit or for them to redeliver it. We asked for it to be redelivered and she said that we would get it when they had time. \n\nWhen I ordered sesame chicken, I was thinking of the one at Sanraku. It was nothing like that. It was breaded chicken pieces. There was a cup of spicy sauce with sesame seeds on top. Eh....it was ok.\n\nI must say that the cod is delish!

The ambiance immediately drew me in. It's got a warm sort of glow to it, the wood theme gives it a mellow vibe but with a clean Japanese aesthetic. The menu then really won me over when I saw the selection of ramen!! A sushi place which also offers ramen yay! happy dance happy dance! And not just one or two different types of ramen, but several. And boy was it good! I ended up having one special roll and ramen and it hit the spot just right.

Ever since JT's closed down, businesses that came after didn't fare very well. Now that Sushi Raw is in, perhaps this will break the spell of the cursed corner? I like to think so!\n\nFirst off, Sushi Raw did one thing right. They spruced up this lot both inside and out. Looking from the outside, it's hard to tell if business is going through well with those tinted windows. Step inside and it's miles away from previous businesses. Modern look takes over and you feel like you're not in the Parkside district. Everything seem to be influenced by modern design as bento boxes are replaced by clean squared ceramic plates. \n\nI've tried the Bento Boxes a couple times prior to this review and I say it's a good value for the quality of the food. At around $8, you get yourself miso soup, California rolls, Shrimp and Veggie Tempura and a variety of entree options to fill in. I have to bring up an observation though. If good value to you is measured by quantity, this might be a target for the opposite. It's not the same portions as Kitaro, but this meal will fill you up. \n\nI've also tried the Toro, or fatty tuna, in its Niigiri form. Freshness and creamy is all that you taste and that's all you need. Or maybe it's $10 for it that you really need...\n\nOverall, Sushi Raw is another Japanese restaurant among many that does almost the same thing as the one next door.

Maybe its because its a sushi store chain and people are iffy about trying chains because they think of fast food joints.\nWe mostly had bento boxes which was 3 items for $9.95. Which is a pretty reasonable price for bento boxes. I had the beef teriyaki, chicken katsu and tempura. It tasted okay. Nothing really special. Pretty small portions though. We also had the tuna poki, pretty spicy but pretty good. It has cucumbers, white radish, raw tuna and black tobiko on top in a spicy sauce. We also had the squid leg katsu, which is basically squid legs in batter. the batter was pretty plain and not even crunchy.\nFor 6 people, the total was around $97. Pretty pricey for the amount of food we had! I would only come back here if it was for another lunch with work or if I really had nothing to eat because seriously, its nothing special.", "author": "Linda N."}

We got the bento box with teriyaki salmon, saba mackerel, yellow tail sashimi ($13.95 + $2 extra for sashimi) and a Four Seasons roll ($13) and a small Kirin beer. \n\nThe fish is top tier. The sashimi was tender, juicy, and fresh but about 1/3 smaller cuts than your average sushi place. The salmon was grilled very well but they kinda smothered it with too much teriyaki. Still very good though. Their saba mackerel was better than I expected. \n\nThe Four Seasons roll was to die for. The decoration of the plate was beautiful and truly art. \n\nAgain, I thoroughly enjoyed our meal but I knocked down 1 star for the price. $36 for 2 people before tip and we didn't really get that much food. My gf was still hungry and was debating to ordered another roll but decided not to. \n\nI knocked down another half star because of the small cuts for their sashimi. Any legit sushi place needs to have legit sashimi. yes it tasted good but no one deserves cuts that small, especially for the price I paid. \n\nThe place has been opened for 12 days they said and it was pretty empty for a Sat night at 8pm. It was only 2 other tables and very quiet, almost uncomfortable eating when you have 3 waitresses and 2 sushi chefs congregated talking 10 ft from you. \n\nDefinitely glad I tried it but I probably won't be coming back due getting better value for your money at other nearby sushi spots.", "author": "Eddie L."}

There's a \"discounted\" menu you could order from after spending $15 or something so we got a Seaweed Salad for $2 and then a Spicy Tuna Roll for $1.\n\nOverall, good experience here.

It was a sushi day for my boyfriend and I before we start school. We went to masu for lunch and came here for dinner. It's a nice place and I like the setting. It felt really warm and casual. My boyfriend and I had the salmon sashimi, the taraval street roll, four season roll and the lion king. Let me tell you. These rolls are deelicious!! Oh my god! I was in heaven. :) to top that off we were still hungry so I ordered a beef udon and another four season roll for my boyfriend. Okay I know this is. Lot of food but we went with our friends so we shared some with them. Haha. The reason why I'm not giving it a 5 star (even though the food was deelish) was because they took forever on the udon and the rice plate that our friends ordered. We finished our food before the udon even came out and after. Ordered mine, it probably took another 20-30 mins to come. I understand there was a big party that night with 10+ ppl but other than that there were only our table and 2 other small ones with 3 ppl max. But overall food was good and the waitress was very deligent and apologized about the long wait and checked on the ordered very often. Thanks for the great service. :) will definitely come back!", "author": "Shirley Z."}

The sashimi was pretty good and cheap and the beef tongue was really really tasty!   So we ordered another beef tongue.\n  \nFast forward:  What a big mistake!!!\nWe decided to have my boyfriend's bday party there, since we were pleasantly surprise the first time.   When we ordered some rolls for the party, they came out soggy (ewww soggy sushi rolls???  wth??)  all the flavors didn't combine well with each other, and the bill came out to be way over priced.  If we knew were going to spend that much money we would've gone somewhere else that tasted better.    One of the biggest reasons we came here was their beef tongue was a huge hit when we first came to try this place out and the sashimi wasn't too bad for the buck.  Well  the night of the bday dinner, the beef tongue was not the same nor did it taste remotely the same as before.  Did they switch chefs already?\nOver all, I don't think we'll be back, I love love love sushi,  so quality and consistency is very important to me..

I ordered the dinner bento box with three items: spicy tuna, cali roll and beef teriyaki. They never asked me how well I wanted the meat cooked, so I assumed they were going to cook it at LEAST medium rare. When my food came out, my meat was LITERALLY RARE. WTF, am I a dog or some type of animal? What do I look like eating RARE meat? Im a little paranoid when eating anything rare, especially beef cuz my stomach is really sensitive. When I told the waitress about my meat she gave me this strange look and kind of had some attitutde. Uh...YOU WORK HERE, and I am the customer. If i'm going to be paying whatever amount at least make my food taste a little better. Don't give me a hard time for asking to cook my meat a little more. On top of that ordered a roll., and the roll was GROSS. It wasn't fresh at all, even my spicy tuna was disgusting. How hard is it to make a decent roll?

It's been so many different restaurants we were sort of hesitant to try it due to the high turnover and the many different restaurants that have came and went, but we decided to give it a go.  It's a very cozy, modern and relaxing restaurant.  Since it's located one the busy intersection of Taraval and 19th, you'd expect to hear the traffic and be bothered but what they did was add tinted glass so no one can see inside which gives the restaurant a much better and relaxing atmosphere.  \n\nAs for the food, we received our food very promptly and the waitress came over numerous times in order to make sure we were fine and everything was to our liking.  The food was really good.  We had a couple of rolls but the one that really stood out was the Lobster Roll which was wrapped in cucumber instead of rice.  It was absolutely delicious as well as the other rolls but that was the one that really stood out.  We began with a soft shell crab and finished with a Green Tea cheesecake which was all very good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the location at times can be a little hard to find parking which is a minor fault but I could see some getting frustrated.  Other than that I'm probably just nit-picking but maybe the next time I go and have the same attentive service, good food and enjoyable time my rating will probably be a 5 star.  Certainly worth a look if you like Japanese and live in the area.", "author": "Ryan T."}

Anyway, the raw salmon was very fresh and delicious and so was the teriyaki salmon. However, the portions were very small for the price we paid. I only gave 2 stars because the service was HORRIBLE! We constantly had to keep flagging down a server if we needed something. No one ever checked up on us to see how we were doing or to refill our waters. We were dying of thirst!

When a friend suggested that we have dinner at Sushi Raw, I was thinking, \"Oh crap... another chain sushi wanna-be place.\" With construction outside, it didn't look too promising. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in, as there was somewhat modern decor and the place was very clean (including the restroom - VERY important). It was 5 plus a kid, and we ordered a few things; Tempura Udon, 2 2-Item Bentos, Soft-Shell Crab app, 1 live Uni, 1 5-Piece order of Toro, and a app order of lamb chops(2 pieces). Nothing too extravagant, nothing too much.... Here is where the problems began... The uni was HUGE, and yes, still moving since it was a live uni, yet, as huge as the uni was, we only got 6 pieces??? Everywhere else, they give you everything inside the thing! At the market, live uni? $6, so when you pay $16 for one, you expect to get the whole thing. Second, our Toro? Not soft, stringy, and DID NOT TASTE ANYTHING LIKE TORO. The cost you ask? 5 pieces for $47!!! $25-35 depending on quality, and they charged me what?! For GARBAGE?! Sure, it can be Toro, but the grade was REALLY LOW. The lamb wasn't that good and the bentos were borderline (chicken was over cooked, and beef wasn't good even)\n\nAll in all, will not come back again. If it wasn't for the great service, I would have blown a gasket when the bill came. $198+tip was our bill for that amount of food.

DELIVER IT TO MY TABLE!  It truly boggles my mind that a place spend hundreds of dollars advertising and when it works to bring in the customer, then they treat them like shit?  Apparently I only qualified if they delivered it to my house, so we didn't get it.  I felt dumb ordering so much food just to qualify, I thought that was very foolish of them to do that to me since I'm never going back there.  They might have saved a whole buck, but they lost all my future business.  I'm a local so they really lost ALOT of potential business from me.  I would pass on this place if I were you.   It's rare for me to leave a place still hungry after dropping $40 for two people. (No booze)   I'm going back to Noriega Teriyaki, it's only 5 mins away, better service, better food, better prices, better parking.", "author": "Nicholas W."}
