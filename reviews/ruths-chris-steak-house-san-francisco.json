Since there was 13 of us, we had a prix fix menu and contract. We needed a minimum amount to spend. This of course is done for large groups. My friend selected a menu from the options given. \n\nWhen we sat down, we were served with cheese and fruit platter, then soup/salad, appetisers and your main course with side options. There was so much food, a lot of us could not finish our meal. Including alcohol and gratuity, it was about  $170 per person. Considering the cost and amount of food, this was a great option and everyone agreed. \n\nThe fruits and cheese platter were fresh, crisp and cheese was flavourful. I opted for the lobster bisque instead of salad. My soup was creamy and great. A friend had the salad and her only complaint was too much dressing.\n\nThe appetisers were crab cakes and shrimp. The crab cakes were delicious chunks of crab  and prepared unlike any other crab cakes I've had. Very flavourful and minimal (not sure if any) bread crumbs. The  shrimp platter was also amazing. The shrimp must have been jumbo, since they were so huge. Seared ahi tuna was great and seasoned perfectly! \n\nOnto the main plates! I opted for the filet mignon, which came out piping hot and medium rare. Outside was nice dark,  crispy, caramelised colour, while inside was nice pinkish and juicy.  I had it without any sauce and the taste was flavourful. Others opted for surf and turf, which came with two good sized lobster tails and smaller cut of filet. Done with gargantuan appetite, had the cowboy cut steak.....which in itself is a monstrous piece of steak. Salmon filet dinner also looked delicious. \n\nOur side dishes included mashed potatoes and asparagus. Both were very delicious. \n\nDESSERT was amazing!!!! I had chocolate molten lava cakes which was intense, rich dark chocolate (recommend with coffee) and others had the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e!\n\nRestaurant has a full bar, drinks are delicious and reasonably priced. \n\nAmbiance is classy, upscale steakhouse with fun, relaxed atmosphere. Interior walls are wood and have that \"old San Francisco\" feel. Staff was super nice and very attentive! It is a nicer restaurant, so business casual attire at a minimum is suggested. \n\nParking is street parking with meters, however valet is offered. I suggest if you're near in SF to take taxi or ride share. \n\nDefinitely a place for a great time with friends/family.", "author": "Albie E."}

This may be a personal preference kind of thing but if you like your salads on the less dressy side, don't get the Caesar.\n\nThe steak, however, was my main heartache. I ordered my 6oz. filet medium rare and it was basically a medium-well. There was a tiny thin line of pink in the very middle of the steak and very well done on all the edges. Going back, I'm reading a lot of other Yelpers experience the same thing. I feel like a steakhouse like Ruth Chris should be able to execute their steaks flawlessly and something like temperature control should be a given. \n\nTIP: My bf ordered his filet Rare Plus and in my opinion that was more of a Medium Rare. Definitely going with that if there is a next time. \n\nPrice-wise this place isn't bad. We ordered the combo meal which was a pretty good deal ( $60 gets you a steak, salad, side, and dessert ). The sides were yummy,the dessert was okay, and the service was attentive. Overall, probably not coming again but sending hopes that this place might get better.", "author": "Jenny L."}

Everything was delicious and perfectly portioned, enough to fill us. If you have never been there, each entree (meat/chicken/seafood) is served by itself. You must order sides for more food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-28", "description": "This place can admittedly be hit or miss, but when they're on, it's incredible. \n\nMy last dinner here started with the crabmeat stuffed mushrooms, which were decent. They're pretty much exactly what you'd expect: crab stuffed in some mushrooms. But they're good!\n\nThe Ruth's Steak House Salad was next, and is a good, clean tasting start to the meal. The balsamic vinaigrette is tangy, but not overly acidic like they are at some places. Otherwise, it's a fairly simple salad just to get you pumped for what's to come.\n\nThen came what I was there for: the 12 oz ribeye. It came out on a sizzling hot plate in a small pool of butter. The steak was incredibly tender and was well marbled with a really good amount of delicious, melt-in-your-mouth fat. This ribeye was literally the kind of tender where you could cut it with a fork. The meat was cooked a perfect medium rare with a good beefy flavor without being overly intense. It isn't a very salty steak, so if you prefer your steaks saltier like I do, you might be a little thrown. But it is still delicious as it is. And it doesn't come with a serious sear, but there's so much fat marbled into the meat that it's not lacking for flavor in the least.\n\nAs for sides, the steamed broccoli is exactly that: steamed broccoli. The garlic mashed potatoes are okay, but not amazing. I like more butter flavor in my potatoes, but it's possible that I wasn't tasting butter in them because I was overwhelmed by the fat in the steak. \n\nBut the best side of all is the sweet potato casserole with a pecan crust. It's just some creamy extremely sweet sweet potatoes with candied crunchy pecans on top. It's pretty simple, but it is just so good. Even if I didn't get a steak, I would probably be happy coming here if I could just eat bowls and bowls of this sweet potato casserole. \n\nSurprisingly, I still did dessert, which was the cheesecake with fresh berries. It was a light, fluffy cheesecake with the berries actually inside of it which was surprising. But it was a perfect wrap-up to a delicious meal.\n\nThis past experience was absolutely incredible, but I have been here before with some less than stellar results. Usually the issues have been with underseasoning and overcooking the meat, which can definitely ruin your experience at a steakhouse. Especially since they don't really reinvent the wheel with their food, it's a let down if they can't get it exactly perfect. But if you catch them on a good day, it is truly an amazing experience!", "author": "Eric Y."}

As far as the taste, it was quite good but the flavor of the steak overpowers it.\n\nThe calamari is a must. One of my favorites now possibly. This is what brought my ratings to a 4.

Unfortunately, my experience was less than at this location of Ruth's Chris, and in many aspects.\n\nLocation specific: San Francisco, CA\n============================\n1.  The Bar: small, more modern than I would have liked -- not classic.  To make matters worse, the one bartender was inexperienced.\n\n2.  Small location: 50% of restaurant space was filled with casual clientele from, what appeared to be, a hip-hop convention.  Jeans, sweatshirts, sweatpants, caps, gold chains.  Is there no dress codes, or standards?\n\nNice:\n====\n1.  The menu has all the usual suspects, but they had a $59 special with a few entree choices, a side, and dessert.  Sign me up!\n\n2.  Faust cab $26 glass is steep, but I couldn't resist one of my favorites.\n\nLess than good:\n=============\n1.  The server had zero personality, and described nothing.  I'm used to a little delivery of specialties, cooking principles, perhaps shown cuts of meat -- nothing at all.\n\n2.  I ordered the Filet, 11oz was slightly off-tasting.  I didn't finish but half.\n\n3.  Garlic Mashed, my side was garlic-less, and what little there was tasted if it was from a Costco jar of minced.\n\n4.  Crumbs were not scraped from my table after my meal, and before dessert.\n\n5.  Bread should have been served with my salad, and was not.\n\n6.  I added $15 for 6 large shrimp, take it or leave it.

We made a reservation for 8:15 PM online, and we were pretty much seated right away when we arrived at 8 PM. I decided to get the Ruth Classic with the Cesar salad, garlic mashed potatoes, the 6 oz filet with shrimp, and then the dessert duo of the apple cheesecake and Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream. My boyfriend ordered the squash bisque, the creamy spinach, the 11 oz filet, and the same dessert duo. They also give you a roll of bread with butter and I ate almost all of it. It was so crunchy and the butter just melted on the hot roll.\n\nThe ceasar salad was standard but it was still delicious. I'm not that big of a fan of the cheese they used so I didn't eat that. The bisque was pretty tasty even though I don't like pumpkin.\n\nOh the filets were THE best part of the meal. It cut really easily and even the meat was super tender. You only had to take a few bites before you had to swallow it. The shrimp was alright. We wanted to save room for dessert so we didn't finish the filets and I asked for a to-go box. I KNOW I had 3 shrimp left but when I checked at home, I had only gotten 2 of my shrimp. I was a little bummed. \n\nThe dessert was pretty good too. The crust on top of the cheesecake was crunchy. Apple cheesecake was a combo of my favorite desserts, apple pie and cheesecake. Vanilla ice cream helped the dense cheesecake go down.\n\nOverall the food was really great. The service was alright.

I'm so glad the waitress informed me about this option because it came out exactly the way I wanted it to and it tasted fantastic! The steak came out on a hot plate with lots of butter to keep it super juicy and flavorful. I read that some people don't like all the butter, but this is steak and if you wanted a lean healthy dry steak, there are other places for that. I'm pretty active and healthy, but when I eat my steak I like to indulge. Every bite was amazingly tender and flavorful and purely delicious! \n\nWe complimented our entrees with creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and roasted brussels sprouts. Oh man, these brussels sprouts are next level since they're made with honey butter and bacon bits. These sweetness and savoriness was amazing. Highly Recommend!\n\nAt the end, we shared their white chocolate bread pudding and a complimentary birthday apple turnover with vanilla ice cream which was awesome.

We had reservations on a Saturday evening and were greeted and seated in a booth.  The booths surrounded large rows of tables that accommodated larger parties in the middle of the restaurant. We were seated at 6:00 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty when we first arrived.\n\nSo, our young girl server came to our table and seemed so nervous.  OMG, she was like Bambi in front of the headlights ..... I kid you not.  To make the matter worse, she had the personality of a door knob.  She asked us if we had ever dined with them before which we answered \"Yes\".  Then she states that the steaks are severed a la carte and she would be back with some bread and will take our drink orders.  WTH?  It's funny now that I\"m recalling my experience but I wasn't laughing at the time.  Since it was a b-day celebration, I just held my tongue and went with the flow.  \n\nOur young lady server returned and the service just went downhill.  We ordered:\n\n(1)  Cocktails\n\n(2)  Appetizers:\nCalamari, Veal Ravioli, Crab Cakes, Lobster Tempura & Lobster Bisque.   \n\nSo, my lobster bisque was served in a huge bowl.  I wanted to share my soup with my friend and asked for a cup from the bus-girl who served our appetizers.  The bus-girl argued with me and told me that they have no small cups.  WTH?  She brought out a small dipping sauce cup so that I could share my bisque .... really?  The way she was talking to me was so offensive.  I was afraid to ask her to split my bisque in fear of what she would do to my soup.  I was looking for our server to complain but she was no where to be found.\n\n(3)  Main Entrees:\nBone in Filet Mignon, Cowboy Ribeye with Blue Cheese Crust & a Lobster Tail, New York Steak & a Filet Mignon. \n\nI ordered by cowboy ribeye medium rare and it was cooked \"medium\".  Again, I did not want to ruin the celebration dinner and did not return my steak.  But, really?  I'm at a steakhouse and they don't know how to cook a steak at medium rare?  \n\n(4)  Sides:\nLobster Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes & Corn\n\nThe food was \"Ehh\" and I've had better prepared entrees at other Ruth Chris locations.  The problem with this Ruth Chris was the service.  The only time we saw our server was when she took our order and when she delivered the check.  She never checked on us, never delivered any of our dishes.  I had to flag down other servers/bus boys for water, etc.  Plus, the bus people who delivered our entrees were not professional.\n\nThis is the surprising part of my experience .... ready?  OMG, the larger parties that were seated in the middle of the room were so loud and rowdy.  I felt like I was dining at the local Bar and Grill.  The only thing missing were the large mounted tv's on the walls.  I was so surprised that management did not ask them to keep their noise level down.  I was shouting at the person in front of me in order to have a decent conversation.  \n\nI have dined at many steak houses including other Ruth Chris' in Southern CA and I have never experienced such poor service.  In addition, I have never dined in a fine steak house restaurant where I felt like I was at a frat house party.  I was just speechless which was a good thing because no one in my party of four could hear me with all of the out of control loud voices surrounding us, lol.  Maybe I should host my son's B-Day dinner at the restaurant when he turns 21 and all of his friends can drink and be rowdy at the restaurant ..... I'll just pick up the check, lol.\n\nThe service and dining atmosphere was horrific which made the food forgettable.  If I wasn't an invited guest, I would had walked out.  A very disappointing dinner experience especially when it was a b-day celebration.  Shame on you Ruth Chris .... Most people dine at your establishment for special occasions and management short staffed the patrons which resulted in awful service. Also, I was so appalled that your patrons were allowed to be SO loud and rowdy which ruined your other customers dining experience.  I won't be back ..... 1 Star!", "author": "Maite H."}

The trouble is, it's extremely pricy and although the steak is good, I'm not sure if it's worth it (unless you have an expense account then by all means.) Basically, for this kind of money, you can get Michelin-star tasting menus which are multiple courses, really unique, and fantastic.\n\nFor such a pricy place, I'm disappointed by the ambiance of this location. Construction on the outside, the \"bad kind\" of dark, people wearing shorts, and almost feels like a semi-abandoned tourist trap.

We also got the spinach, the scalloped potatoes, and the Brussels sprouts.

Table was decorated with confetti for his bday which was a nice touch. The waiter, Joe, came over to take our order and since neither of us are drinkers we both ordered water. I think the waiter was hoping we would order drinks because he asked us again in the same conversation what we would like from the bar and again we both said just water. After he took our order we barely saw him again, at least not at our table. Our water glasses went empty during dinner and we had to track someone else down to get them filled. I saw him visit other tables several times and the difference seemed to be those tables were spending a lot more money than we were. Granted for 2 our bill came to $144 which is to me is a LOT of money but to these waiters it's nothing. There was also a leaky light fixture right where you enter the dining room and mgmt was trying to fix it and it kept getting worse and dripping more and more. This was very distracting to me as I could clearly see it and it made the venue seem far less classy.

We are quite well off. We own a rare single family house outright in Nob Hill and make a good living. It was our anniversary when we went to Ruth Chris. It was unplanned and spontaneous visit. We first went to the superior House of Prime Rib but it was full as usual and the wait was over an hour. So we walked over to Ruth Chris. I thought it would be a good experience as it was my first time at the chain. We went in and it was very empty. Let me remind you that this was an impromptu outing and we were quite underdressed. There was this white waiter who looked at us up and down and annoyingly while unenthusiastically greeted us. He proceeded to sit us at the bar table without asking us if it was ok. At first I did not realize it was a bar area until I went to the restroom and saw people enjoying their meal at the proper dining area. I was pissed. I confronted the dude and his reply was, \"you asked for it!\". WTF. Why would we ask for a shabby bar table with a loud TV noise above our heads on our anniversary! It was a shocking accusation. We promptly left this god forsaken place and called them a racist on our way out. What a disaster. We will NEVER go to Ruths including all of its chain thanks to this horrible experience.", "author": "jay o."}

I expect amazing like the last time I was here but I experienced continuous disappointments.  \n\nThe place is not well organized.  We had a reservation and it was not busy, but still had to wait to be seated.  Lots of staff were standing talking and laughing or moving around.  The dim light and decor were cool and hip.  Service was poor.  Servers were not attentive and rude.  \n\nComplimentary rolls were surprisingly cold.   The salad was nothing spectacular, the dressing was rather bland.  The seared Ahi Tuna and Chilean Sea Bass were delicious.  Who'd know that the fish here would taste so good.  My 12oz ribeye was well done so I sent it back and got another disappointing piece.  Luckily I got full from the fish so I decided to take my steak home for my kitty Mimi!   Haha. \n\nThe creamed spinach and Cremini mushrooms were salty and tasteless--the worst I've ever had. Mashed potatoes with garlic was yummy.  The chocolate sin cake is yummy. \n\nMy advice is NOT to come here and make the same mistake I did.  Go to Lolinda, Harris, 5A5, Kokkari or Bobo for steaks \n\nI wouldn't go back and hope others don't have to endure my suffering dining experience.

Parking is a little bit tricky as you have to park in the residential streets with very limited parking. They do offer valet here if you choose to do that instead.\n\nThe ambiance was romantic and dimly-lit. I would definitely take a date here. It's definitely not a place where you have to worry too much about your attire. The service here was great and well-timed. The timing between each dish that was brought out was strategic and our server was polite and helpful.\n\nWe both each ordered the ruth's classics meal, which includes a starter, entree, side dish, and dessert. We also ordered the lobster mac n cheese (which was good, but we could've skipped on this as it was really rich and heavy). I would definitely recommend going the ruth's classics meal route if you want to try a little bit of everything. For the starter, a steak house salad which was enormous for a starter but delicious! All of the ingredients seemed really fresh and it was the perfect start to my meatlicoius meal. For the entree, you know I had to order the filet mignon and the shrimp. The filet was delicious - unadulterated from any other ingredient that would mask its true flavor. The shrimp was meh though. For a side dish, I would definitely recommend the sweet corn succotash if you're a corn lover like I am! It complimented my filet really nicely. The dessert which was an apple pastry with vanilla ice cream was yummy as well! \n\nOverall, I was pretty impressed with my dining experience here and would definitely come back again!", "author": "Joanne Y."}

I requested to be seated before my dining partner came since he informed me that he was running late.  The hostess was accommodating and I got seated first.  To keep in the back of my mind, patience is a virtue.  Practice it because I get agitated.  Sometimes, I just need to learn how to breathe and take a step back.  That's where dining helps on letting me reflect a bit and enjoy the fruits of labor.  \n\nThey know their recommendations on wine and the Prisoner, Napa Valley red Cabernet, was well unique to the palate.  We ended up getting a Pinot Noir since both of us like Pinots. \n\nWhen looking over the menu, it tells you how Ruth's Steakhouse came about and I find it not only admirable, but awe inspiring on risking one's own home mortgage to start this business, despite many liabilities, risks and setbacks. I'm impressed on how it became a chain and it hit a soft spot for me.\n\nI love the juicy cowboy ribeye steak! Medium rare is a must!  Mushrooms and the creamed spinach is to order up!

However, I just went there last night, and I really need to get this review off my chest, and I can't stop thinking about my bone in filet mignon.\n\nI went here with the wife to celebrate and early Valentine's Day dinner, and upon walking towards our table they had decorated it with shiny heart confetti. Looks like they also placed rose petals on a couple's table that was celebrating their anniversary. Talk about attention to detail right?\n\nAnyhow,I brought my own bottle of wine,  a 2004 Caymus Special Selection.  The waitress, looked at the bottle and I mentioned it may have sediment, and she ever so gently opened the bottle to ensure the cork did not break, placed the bottle down got a decanter and strained out any sediment and the night started off from there!  I love a steakhouse where the waiters know how to handle a bottle of wine.\n\nMy wife got the petite filet mignon, I ordered the bone-in filet mignon (both medium rare).  For an appetizer we shared the seared ahi-tuna which came with pickled cucumbers and ginger.  Yum!\n\nOh, I almost forgot, they provide you with warm bread with butter whipped to perfection.\n\nOur sizzling steaks came out with our sides of the shoe strings potatoes and cremini mushrooms.  The mushrooms are a must. The little gravy it is served in actually somewhat enhanced the steak which is always drenched in parsley butter.\n\nNow, back to my bone in filet mignon, this was the most amazing 16 ounces of steak I have ever eaten. I would say even above Marinus' Wagyu.  Honestly, I was blown away with the first two bites, and getting to the center was another level I didn't think even existed.  It was hands down the best steak I've ever had.  From the beautiful crust on the steak to the texture that just melts in your mouth to the actual flavors.  It was harmonious.  By the because of the cut I was given the option to select a special knife out of a wooden box!\n\nThe petite filet mignon was delicious too, but if you've never had a bone-in filet mignon put it on your bucket list!\n\nFor dessert we ordered the chocolate molten cake and that also blew me away.

Found a metered parking one block away (you don't have to pay after 6 pm.) Came in with my husband and our 6 yr old daughter. Was not greeted at all, probably a good 3 to 5 minutes, front hostess was too busy with her computer,side chattin with her co-workers and I just stood up and told the front hostess that I have a reservation for 6:15 pm, checked us in, waited about 10 minutes more and finally they sat us. \n\nThe ambiance is dark but not overly dark, the seats are kind of cramped together but it's cool.\n\nHad the blueberry mojito to start (too minty), we ordered the Ruth Chris classic's; 6 oz filet and lobster tail for me, 12 oz ribeye and addt'l lobster tail for the hubz, roast chicken and French fries for our baby girl. The Caesar salad that cake with the entree was bomb! And the lobster bisque was delectable all three of us finished it, scooping the sourdough bread with it too!\n\nThe steaks and seafood came in (be aware of the sizzling hot plates, the server just told me to be careful and not touch it, but me being a rebel, ohh I got a lil burned by a slight touch so do not touch it!); the steaks were cooked medium rare to perfection and it was really flavorful. The lobster was probably a teeny tiny bit over cooked but not trippin cuz ya birthday gurl was hungraaay!!! The sides were creamy corn and mashed potatoes (we thought we ordered creamed spinach but they gave that, it was still good!) Our daughter's chicken was pretty good the only thing is that it kind of looked like a quail?!? Lol it was really small but it is pretty good too.\n\nThere was a complimentary birthday dessert. There was bread pudding, vanilla ice cream and some kind of chocolate bar with coconut flakes.\n\nThe bill was about $175.00 plus tip for the three of us including the drinks. Not bad, we paid more than $250 at the other steak establishments.\n\nWhat made it better were the servers inside. They were really friendly,polite,patient and they are really attentive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-12", "description": "First - I'll open with the fact that even with this email that I wrote to the general manager (see below); her and I had what I thought was a productive phone conversation with her and she was \"allegedly\" apologetic for her manager and her restaurants performance, and assured she would be sending an apology in the mail....\n\nTHAT NEVER HAPPENED!!! Which now has cause an even worse reputation for her restaurant than before. Here is the abbreviated email for the dismal experience at this \"alleged\" great restaurant.\n\n\"It was my first time at any Ruth's Chris restaurant, we visited on 9/3/17, and have only heard about the fabulous and empeccable service there is. Sadly your manager, Brian, this evening was lacking.\n\nTo begin, we had ordered beverages from the bar that took an excessive 20 minutes, for three cocktails. Upon receiving those, our server Chelsea took our order. The night progressed at a dismal speed as we waited 40 minutes for our hot food to arrive. We were informed by Chelsea that she was informing your manager, Brian, that the normal ticket time is 20 minutes for food, yet ours was double the wait time. \n\nFollowing him coming and greeting our table, he assured us that ours was the next order out and simply apologized for this excessive wait period. Ours was clearly NOT the next order as we watched an order leave the kitchen that wasn't ours. \n\nYou'd think that would've been the last of the nights issues; however, it was not. In my experience in the serving business for 10+ years myself, it was always the practice of the managerial staff to not only bring the late food out to the table, but frequent checks thereafter. When we finally got our food, which was delivered by two individuals we'd never seen, the manager had to inform us that your kitchen was out of mashed potatoes. The kitchen staff had not even informed our server, so she was unaware as well. Which if our food had come out at the appropriate time we may have been able to have our garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nPoor etiquette and poorly run kitchen line. \n\nI asked Brian for your contact number to make this phone call, which also took him an excessive amount of time. \n\nThe restaurant was not busy by my observation, which can usually cause long ticket times etc. as I said, I've been in the business and understand the logistics of it all. Which is also why I am writing this email. \n\nThe evening ended and Brian brought the bill over and had comped the drinks and took off $50 from the whole bill. While I realize he did recognize there was a serious issue, he should have definitely informed of us of any accommodations and comps he was going to do for us at dinner, to make the experience more enjoyable that he sincerely cared about the poor service. Rather by not letting us know until the end, we sat angry about the situation and how he handled it with a simple \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience.\" \"\n\nTHAT IS ALL! If there were an option to give no stars they'd have it on all accounts", "author": "Kala B."}

Years ago, I'd mistakenly made reservations at the Sacramento location (not SF, like I thought), and they found a way to seat my friend and I at a pretty nice table. They never made it seem like it was an issue. \n\nCocktails: Ruth Chris makes a great cocktail, whether it's something exotic or a bourbon neat, Ruth Chris takes the time to formulate a standout cocktail. And for those who enjoy a nice glass of wine, this is just the spot for a Merlot or Pinot noir or an juicy berry-forward Shiraz, their wine list is extensive. \n\nAppetizers: Ruth Chris has a stellar selection to chose from, my favorite is the Crab Stack, the crab is tender, juicy and refreshingly sweet.\n\nSalads: The Ruth Chris' Chopped Salad is so good, I would come here every day, just to have the salad, (and a steak). The Chopped has three different kinds of lettuce ( iceberg lettuce, baby spinach and radicchio) for the ultimate combination of crispy and tender textures, paired with red onions, mushrooms, green olives, bacon, eggs, hearts of palm, croutons, bleu cheese and a lemon basil dressing, topped with crispy onions for that special crunchy kick. \n\nMain: Ruth's has a number of steaks I love, but my top two are the Ribeye and Filet Mignon, both have superior flavor and tenderness, served on a sea of buttery sizzling goodness and cooked just the way I like it (MR+). If you're a seafood fan, try the Chilean Sea Bass, it's perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection.\n \nDessert: If you have room, and you dare risk cardiac arrest and an elevated cholesterol, their creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and N.Y. cheesecake are delicious, rich and creamy, each and every satisfying bite.\n\nIt is obvious the staff at Ruth Chris San Francisco take great pride in their work, and take care to ensure customers enjoy a lovely experience from start to finish. \nI have enjoyed visiting this restaurant for 17 years; each time I walk in the door, it feels like I am greeting old friends.

First thing is first, the valet here was anything but nice, and he almost forgot to give us our ticket for the car. We reserved a table on open table and arrived early. When we got there it took them an additional 20-25 minutes to seat us. The most I am waited at the Walnut Creek location was 2-5 minutes if that. Our server took forever to come around to take our drink order, so when we saw her again, we ordered everything at once. This was towards the closing hours, so it I wasn't busy so there was no reason as to why the service quality should have been so bad. As for the food, thankfully this is the only thing that went right. It tasted just right and cooked the way we ordered it. Overall, I would not be back to this location and will definitely be sticking to the Walnut Creek location from now on.", "author": "Anne R."}

Bread | Looks like unpretentious white bread, but it had a magical balance of a crispy crust and fluffy soft interior.\n\n1. Salad | Mmm several items in this salad made it stand out from generic salads. Vinaigrette and sweet onions are among my least favorite salad items, but they turned out to be the highlights here--the vinaigrette was sour in a delightful and refined way, and the onions were sweet and juicy. The garlic croutons another highlight, with nice garlicky flavors and a texture that was just firm enough for a mild crunch without being soggy.\n\n2. Petite filet & shrimp | I asked for medium well filet mignon, and it was pretty close to perfection: succulent and tender with a thin roasty exterior, boasting rich beef flavors accentuated with butter and pepper. The grilled shrimp were surprisingly delicious as well, juicy and robustly flavorful, though a bit too salty.\n\n3. Sides | I didn't care much for the mashed potatoes or creamed spinach. There was nothing special except that the small sprinkle of parsley on the potatoes. As for the spinach, I found it way too limp and gloopy, so creamy that it seemed closer to dessert than vegetable.\n\n4. Dessert Duo | Shaped like a cupcake and tasting like fudge, it lacked dimension and was too dense and sweet. I would pass on dessert; more steak is a much better use of your stomach space\n\n5. Cocktails | Pricey-ish at $14, but the alcohol is strong and their mixed drinks are well crafted. My Aviation was excellent, balanced yet bold. \n\nThe verdict? In my opinion the steak quality and cooking technique are superior to House of Prime Rib, while the overall dining experience is shy of the more memorable details at HOPR with its flamboyant steak cart, branded plates, and tastier dessert. Also, Ruth Chris's presentation is quite underwhelming, although steak is not the most photogenic foods.", "author": "Edna C."}

We've heard good things and decided to try it. For a high end steak house, it really wasn't anything special. The fillets and rib eyes we ordered were good but not spectacular. The 5 sides we ordered were good but we ordered shoestring potatoes and when they arrived, they were actually SOGGY and LUKE WARM rather than hot and crispy! One person in our party commented it looked like leftovers from a previously served meal.  How does this happen at a premium steak house?! They remade them, but by the time they arrived, we had almost finished our dinner.  Our steaks were ordered medium rare and were medium to medium well when they arrived at our table. The service was good but our server could have come by sooner after our entrees arrived to ask how our meals were. For us, Harris', Osso Steak House, or House of Prime Rib (all where we have previously dined) provided a much better dining experience.

We came on a Friday night at 7PM and were seated promptly. \n\nWe were asked what kind of water we wanted (sparkling, bottled, still), and I noticed that every time the lady asked any table she never mentions regular tap water as an option - just an FYI, but we got regular. We were also given a nice warm loaf of bread and butter to start.\n\nAs we looked at the menu, we decided to each get something from Ruth's Classic section, which comes with a starter, entree, side, and dessert. \n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon ($55.95) and chose the caesar salad starter and mashed potato side. My boyfriend ordered the 16oz. ribeye (+$4 to the $55.95) and also chose the caesar salad starter and creamed spinach side. I also ordered a side of Shoestring Fries ($10), and a Rasberry Rosemary Cosmo ($14).\n\nThe caesar salad came out first. They put a lot of shaved parmesan on the salad but I'm not complaining. \n\nThen our entrees came, the steak comes out on a sizzzzzzling hot plate so be careful not to touch it. My favorite part of the meal was my filet mignon. It was so tender and juicy! I ordered mine medium and it had just the right amount of pink and seasoning to make every bite delicious - totally would recommend. \n\nFrom the pictures, I had thought the side dishes would come out in a bigger portion. Maybe if you get it outside of the Classic selection, it does. Anyways, my boyfriend and I both agreed that the creamed spinach was just okay. I thought that it would taste better, but it is what it is - creamed spinach. The mashed potatoes were good though and had a garlic flavor which I liked. \n\nThe shoestring fries we ordered were very overly seasoned with salt/pepper and my boyfriend complained (to me) that it wasn't as crispy as he expected it to be. Once we got past the top layer of the fries, however, it wasn't as heavily seasoned. Maybe they should shake the fries more to spread out the salt/pepper before serving it. \n\nWe didn't finish our entrees, and by the time dessert came out were both really full. We each got a dessert as a part of our meal; a cheesecake and chocolate pieces (bark). We decided to just split one of them at dinner and then take the other to go. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal and am glad that we came to try.\n\nOn a side note, prior to coming, I had wanted to see what the menu (+prices) looked like but could only find a picture of 1 page of the menu outside of all the DAT menus people took pictures of so I took pics of the entire menu in case anyone ever has the same need as I did ;)", "author": "Michelle C."}

We were greeted promptly and got seated towards the back area of the restaurant. Unfortunately, there were \"drunk\" loud girls sitting on the next booth... they must be having too much fun on ladies night out or something... we could hear them chatting about their bad dates whatsoever very clearly despite the \"echo\" and somewhat loud restaurant. \n\nService was very friendly and courteous. The hostess sprinkled flower petals across the table as I noted on the reservation that it was for our anniversary date... a very nice touch!\n\nWe opted for the Ruth Chris Classic menu as it's the more bang for your bucks and we both opted for the larger cut of Ribeye, medium rare.\n\nThe SALAD that came with the RC Classis menu WAS HUGE!!!!! One could easy split one salad!!! or actually you would be full by the time you finished eating the salad, yikes!!! \n\nSteak came out in the famously HOT plate..I liked that the plate kept the meat warm however, I disliked the sizzles and SPLATTERS...watch out for your clothes...!!!! I covered my top with napkins to shield the splatters.. yikes!!! It did die down after a while but it was not very pleasant and I felt that the whole table also got dirty from the splash and splatters from the sizzles.\n\nMy mistake was, I cut into my steak way too quickly.. apparently they did not rest the steak in the kitchen... so my steak kinda bled out, *sobs!! Unfortunately also... the steak was kinda BLAH and BLAND... I had to add salt to the steak, which was ok BUT when I go to the restaurant, I prefer the \"chef\" to season my food that me having to do it myself. The flavor of the steak itself was not better than Black Angus... since I paid more than double the price... the steak at RC was not very impressive to me.\n\nThe mashed potatoes was very creamy and delicious and so was the cream spinach (you got to pick 2 sides with the RC Classic menu).\n\nSo I will say, I give 4 stars for the sides and salad... and about 2.5-3 for the steak..\n\nThe dessert course (also came with the RC Classic menu) was delicious and rich. They gave us a scoop of sorbet and wrote \"happy anniversary\" on one of the dessert plates (we each got one of the same dessert with the RC classic menu).\n\nThere were lines out the door when we finished dinner.\n\nOverall.. it was just an \"ok\" place for steak... certainly, not worth paying the price and driving all the way to the city for the food... sorry..", "author": "Yun C."}

Thank you to our server Phil, he was very patient with us and answered all our questions about the menu. \n\nYou start off with their warm bread with their whipped butter. So delicious!

Thr lobstet bisque that my mother had was very creamy. \n\nFor our entrees, we had the filet mignon and the ribeye steak along with a lobster tail. The lobster tail is served  with butter sauce and a lemon. Phil helped remove the shell from the meat for us. It was delicious. Now those steaks though. The filet mignon were perfectly salted and peppered. The butter sauce that the steak was sitting on was the best. The meat was nice and tender. My brother could not stop complimenting about his ribeye.\n\nThe sides that we ordered were brussel sprouts, mash potatoes, and cream spinach. I loved the brussel sprouts. They were perfectly carmelized and the bacon added a nice touch. The mashed potatoes were delicious and creamy. It wasnt too dry. The cream spinach was good but house of  prime ribs cream spinach is better. \n\nAnd finally, we ended our meal with an espresso cake with fresh berries and cream and a creme brulee. My family liked tge expresso cake more than the creme brulee. But I loved both of them. \n\nOne recommendation is definitely make reservations because it helped us get seated right away and it was  full night for Saturday.

We made reservations a month back so we were seated within 10 minutes in a booth tucked away from the rest of the restaurant. \n\nThe complimentary bread and butter was so delicious. I had to stop myself from filling up on it. We all ordered the Ruth's Classic for $56 each. It includes your choice of meat, starter, side, and dessert.  \n\nThe caesar salad with garlic croutons was super good but filling. The mac and cheese side had a subtle jalapeno kick to it. It reminded me of Homeroom's mac and cheese, yum! I tried my boyfriend's mashed potatoes, but it was just whatever.\n\nAs for my meat, I got the 12 oz Ribeye medium rare. When it arrived, it was drowning in grease and butter... Don't get me wrong, if I'm eating out, I like my food unhealthy and buttery but this was just too much. It also tasted too salty and peppery, rather than flavorful.\n\nComing into the meal, all 3 of my friends, who have previously been to Ruth's Chris, were really excited to have Ruth's Chris again because they assured me that it was really good. But turns out they all said that their steaks did not live up to their previous experiences.

We were seated immediately at a table covered in Happy Birthday confetti (cute). As a group we ordered two petite filets medium rare, one 12 oz ribeye and a salmon. I additionally ordered the SIX large shrimp, the dipping sauce and (stupidly) I tried the creamed spinach while everyone else got the mashed potatoes. I even specifically asked the waitress if the creamed spinach was something she would get, and she said yes, she liked it here. \n\nBread: amazing, hot, with delicious butter. I already stuffed my face while the rest of my party was just testing the temperature with their fingertips. \n\nSalad: \"Steak house salad\" doesn't have any steak in it, but it was still the most delicious salad. I loved it. The dressing was perfect and tangy/tasty, and all the ingredients were nice and fresh. \n\nThere was a bit of downtime while we waited for our entrees after the salad. But that's okay, we had a drama couple next to us, so we covertly watched their (non)interaction during our conversation. \n\nOur entrees arrived! My filet looks and tastes perfect. It was definitely cooked with enough butter and salt/pepper. But, wait- why do I only have 3 shrimp? (I wanted to share with the table), and they were actually positioned to look like only 2 scrawny shrimp. And they were pretty tiny. and not that flavorful. I asked the busboy who brought them, and he said that it was only three. I was kinda upset, but decided to deal with it with the waitress at the bill time (I took a picture, as proof!) \n\nMy boyfriend's ribeye was pretty tough, so he didn't finish it. The salmon seemed fine, my friend didn't complain. the creamed spinach was downright terrible. Ugh, I will never try it again! Dipping sauce was fun, but I still felt that was overpriced. \n\nDessert was this slightly deconstructed carrot cake. Too sweet, and after all the face-stuffing I did, I didn't really finish much of it. At least it came with a candle for my boyfriend. :D \n\nWhen we got the bill, I noticed they billed me $15 for 3 shrimp. So I just got up and found the waitress (you don't understand, we see her like once every thirty minutes!) and asked her to please change it. She agreed that it was supposed to be 6 shrimp and offered to give me the three extra shrimp now. Hah. No woman, I don't want those three shrimp, after I've already eaten- thank you. So she charged me half for it. Reasonable, but not exactly satisfying. ($7.50 for three tiny shrimp, not exactly what they seem to be advertising in all their luscious pictures). \n\nGood: the petite filet, the salad, and the BREAD \nNot-so-good: the carrot cake\nBad: ribeye and shrimp.

So when my boyfriend said he wanted steak at an affordable steak house, I was like, let's go to Ruth's Chris, thinking it was ghetto AF.\n\nHowever, when we got the restaurant, i was pleasantly surprised. I want to start off by saying that the service is REMARKABLE. we said it was our anniversary and they laid the tables with rose pedals. each server came by and said happy anniversary which i was pretty nice. \n\nNow onto the food - we ordered the 22 oz cowboy steak, salad and shoe string fries. i don't personally eat steak, so we shared the 22 oz. i ate like 4 bites, and thought it was good. the butter they drenched it in was amazing. The shoe string fries were a little hard to eat. a little too stringy. we devoured it though. the server even told us that we're the first couple to finish the fries - we love fries. \n\nat the end, they gave us complimentary dessert because of the special occasion. not some cheap ice cream either, legit dessert that we could ordered off the menu. the taste of the food and service were top notch.\n\nHOWEVER, the reason i'm not giving more stars is because 12 hours later, my boyfriend got extreme food poisoning. Since i only ate 4 bites, i had a bad stomachache but it quickly passed. my boyfriend was throwing up his food the next day. maybe my instincts were right and Ruth's is ghetto AF.", "author": "Andy H."}

That was a huge turnoff. \n\nBecause I am such a loyal fan of Ruth Chris, I decided to give it another try. Everything was spot on.\n\nThis particular restaurant is in the middle of San Francisco, so you can't expect much in terms of the car or elegance. But the food West everything you would expect at Ruth's Chris. The steakhouse salad was bountiful and fresh, the mashed potatoes and au gratin potatoes were amazing. The ribeye steak was cooked to perfection, in the desert phenomenal.\n\nLove Ruth's Chris coffee!", "author": "Jaime J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-21", "description": "Ruth Fertel's story and the history behind Ruth's Chris is impressive. \nMy steak was not as impressive.\n\nWe went with the 3 course menu.\nCaesar Salad:\nSometimes I just crave a salty Caesar salad with croutons and creamy dressing. The shaved parmesan was good. Romaine lettuce lettuce had a lot of dressing, a little too much. The one cherry tomato was halved, and seemed more like an afterthought than a topping.\n\nPetite Filet and Shrimp:\nApparently Ruth perfected the 1800 degree Fahrenheit broiler, but the execution was not so perfect. It was overcooked. Since it is served on a 500 degree buttered plate, it keeps the meat cooking much longer after the steak is removed from the broiler. I would have liked it medium rare with some pink in the center and flowing meat juices, but it was more cooked through.\nI wasn't expecting the steak to be topped with shrimp. It looked interesting, but I would have liked them separately. The shrimp seemed to have some Cajun rub on them and almost took over the flavor of the steak. The shrimp themselves were good and were cooked well.\n\nFilet & Lobster:\nThis filet was also overcooked and a little dry. The outer part of the steak had a chalky texture, which was just odd. The lobster tail was a little tough, but the flavor was okay and the clarified butter helped.\n\nThe sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes were okay, but could have used a little more flavor.\n\nChocolate Cheesecake:\nThe miniature round cheesecake was served with a single scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with raspberry sauce, and accompanied with a few berries dusted in powdered sugar over a custard-y sauce. It made for an okay dessert. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, as it was a little dense for me. The ice cream and fruit were not bad. The plate was nicely decorated in chocolate sauce for our special occasion. \n\nOverall, the food was alright. Plating was a little messy at times. The steak was just too chalky and a little too well-done for my preferences. I was a little distracted from the steak and enticed by the seafood pairings. Perhaps I would have liked my steak better sans shrimp.\n\nService was pretty good. After we checked in for our reservation, we were taken to a booth with a small lamp on the table. It was about $50/person, which is not a bad price for the amount of food. It just wouldn't be my first choice since there are better options on Steakhouse Street.", "author": "Joy W."}

Waited about 10 minutes despite having a reservation from opentable, and the restaurant was only about 10% full when we came in at 5:15.  When we arrived at the table, it was missing two menus and one table setting despite the wait.\n\nAppetizers\n\n- blue crab stack: 4/5  it was really good.  good amount of delicious crab with avocado, cucumber and mango.  it could have been stacked better as we had avocado and cucumber clumped together, otherwise it is a solid 5/5.\n- fried calamari: 5/5  everyone loved this dish.  i loved the addition of chopped jalapenos and roasted red bell pepper.\n\nSide dishes\n\n- lobster mac and cheese: 4/5  the lobster was fresh and tasty.  mac and cheese underneath looked a little stale (?) but the taste was ok.\n- mashed potatoes: 4/5  texture was a little loose but overall very good\n- mushrooms: 2/5  very salty and the mushrooms were not rendered well\n- french fries: 2/5  soggy and tasteless\n- creamed spinach: 4/5  it was good.  creamy, but not mushy\n\nSteaks\n\nHere's where it fell apart.  We had 5 steaks ordered, 3 medium well, 1 medium and 1 medium rare.  Three came out with incorrect temperature.  Two were sent back, waited 10 minutes, and came out with still incorrect temperature.  I have ordered 16 oz ribeye with temperature medium rare.  It came out medium / medium well the first time.  The replacement was more like rare.  My friend's medium well came out as well done the first time.  The replacement was a medium rare.\n\nAs for the quality of the steak, despite the claim of being USDA Prime cut, my ribeye steak was extremely sinewy and tough, even at rare temperature.  The rating for the steaks are 2/5 overall.  I've had steaks much better prepared at Alexander's, Michael Mina's, Forbes Mills, and even McNamaras.  The experience we had was no better than Black Angus steakhouse.  I won't be coming back.", "author": "J L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-11-07", "description": "I am so disappointed to write this review.  This WAS my favorite restaurant.  I have been to many steakhouses.  Morton's, Fleming's, Dominick's, Alexander's, Stark's, etc., but the southern style of Ruth's Chris was always what I fell back on.  I've eaten at a few other locations including, San Diego, Thousand Oaks, Irvine, and Sacramento.  I've hosted private events in the San Francisco location for birthdays and have celebrated several birthdays there as well, over the years. \n\nI'm not sure what has happened.  The last couple of times I visited, I experienced poor service.  I took my mom for one of her birthdays and the server completely neglected us.  The manager at the time offered to comp our meals but I declined because I was such a fan of the company that I knew it was a fluke.  Unfortunately the following attempts at redemption were a complete failure.  \n\nOnly speaking to my last experience, I took my gf there in September to celebrate a special occasion.  The server did not explain anything about the way the steaks were prepared or served, something that is consistently done at every meal in every location.  The food came out plated terribly, and the plates were not even warm, let alone 500 degrees, like they should be.  I have high expectations of Ruth's Chris and pay a premium because the consistency is what holds a place like that together.  At every turn I was disappointed.  I made reservations in advance and we had to wait.  Our table was in a very awkward position and I requested a booth, but our server said there was nothing she could do about it.  The food, like I mentioned, was absolutely sub par.  Overall a very poor experience.\n\nThis time I decided to contact the manager and explain the situation in hopes of gaining a better understanding of what has changed over the years.  I spoke with B****** G***, the general manager, who responded back to my initial email around a week later, apologizing for the delay.  I kid you not, she sounded medicated.  She was speaking very slowly and sounded very scripted.  I confirmed what my initial email had explained and she verified that the server should have explained all of the standard stuff, and other accommodations could have been made.  She was polite and offered to send me a $100 gift card.  I have spent thousands at this place, and like anyone else that frequents there knows, you could barely get away with $100 for one person.  I spent $220 on the night of the last poor experience.  I expressed my discontent, but decided if that was the best she could do to bring me back maybe I would give it ANOTHER try.  A week later, still no card, so I attempted to reach her again, this time explaining the amount of money I had spent there over the years and that I should be able to retry the last experience, at least.  No response.  I have written back 3 more times, attaching each previous email.  No responses to any of them.  No gift card, no contact whatsoever.  I know it is just a restaurant, but when you have a tradition, or any emotional attachment to a place, it's much harder to want to change that.  I will literally never support this business again. I am beyond disappointed.", "author": "J J."}

The ambiance is nice, tables a little close together for my liking, but somehow not as loud as you would think. My boyfriend and I went there for Valentines Day and it was our first time dining there. We each opted for the special 4 in 1 deal which in life's a starter, an entree, a shareable side and a dessert. I started with the caesar salad which was really good but a little heavy on the dressing. He got the acorn bisque which smelled so sweet and tasted delicious. Next was the main course. I opted for the Filet as I always do and him the ribeye. First off, they are served on plates that are 500 degrees and sizzling hot. DO NOT TOUCH. However, this keeps the steak hot the entire time you are eating it which I thought was a really nice touch. The flavor on his ribeye steak was to die for. Both our meats cooked perfectly. The filet was tender and you barely needed to chew it. We chose the broccolini and garlic mashed potatoes as sides, both great. For dessert we upgraded to the berries and cream and the crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Both very sweet but that's what desserts are about right!? Side note, the bread and butter, though plain, was REALLY good and we had to tell ourselves to stop eating it. \nThe waiter was great. We are both avid beer drinkers and not wine drinkers so it's safe to say we were a little out of our element but the server knew every bottled beer they had which I was impressed with. Our drinks were never empty and our table always cleared which is a small thing I love is having a clean, cleared table. Since it was Valentine's Day, there were rose pedals on every table, the manager or owner was going around to every table and handing out gift cards and the ladies received a rose when the check came. These were all nice touches the restaurant did that I enjoyed and will definitely be coming back again!", "author": "Allison H."}

I knew that it would be expensive, but $200 for a very modest meal just isn't worth it. The steaks were okay, but not amazing. The sides weren't very special. Baked potato wasn't even cooked well. Mushy and had clearly been overcooked. Our waiter neglected us at times (had to ask for water twice). I think others were there for their birthdays, and they seemed to get some special treatment, but none for my son. They sat us in a weird spot, too. Overall, a huge disappointment. I won't be going back to Ruth's Chris again. I honestly don't understand why this place has such a good reputation.

I much prefer the service at House of Prime Rib where the servers are much more genuine and energetic. \n\nI didn't like that our appetizers and entrees came all at the same time. All the other tables around us had apps first before their entrees were brought out. Bad timing on the kitchen's part I suppose. \n\nOn to the food:\nLobster Mac N Cheese - a MUST order, this was delicious. The hint of green pepper in the dish was perfect. \nHash browns - the boyfriend loves hash browns so when our server mentioned this as a unique to the SF Ruth Chris, we though why not. Completely underwhelming and was not worth ordering. We wish we had gone with the shoestring fries or ahi tuna instead. \nRaspberry Rosemary Cosmo - I may have gotten the name wrong for this, but it was good. \nFilet Mignon - boyfriend absolutely loved this. I had a bite and it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. \nLamb chops - also perfection. The mint jelly was also great with this. \n\nI'd certainly come back for the food here, but I wish the service was a bit less stuffy.

She took a look at it , and then swiped my card again and had the machine printing out a paper receipt saying something like the previous transaction didn't go through, and then she pulled out her iphone, putting it on the table in front of us, and calculated the tip with the percentage she wanted  for me to put on the receipt.

We also brought our own wine ($15 corkage fee), which I definitely suggest doing because the price for a glass of wine is ridiculous. \n\nFive minutes after we place our order, our waitress comes back and tells us that they are out of Creamed Spinach.

I was a little hesitant because it's a chain but I wanted a steakhouse and something close to the Kabuki theater on Valentine's Day so I made my reservation over a month in advance (I'm a planner). Due to my drinking one too many beers while doing my makeup, we were 10 mins late for our reservation (shout out to our Lyft driver who drove like I was 10 months pregnant with L&D set as my destination tho). I thought they would honestly just send us away. But they didn't even guilt trip us! They said we'd just have to wait about 5-10 and that was just about exactly how long we waited. \n\nWe stood by the bar and watched this awkward encounter happen between this lady trying to order to-go from the frazzled bartender and that made for decent entertainment during the brief wait. \n\nOur server was phenomenal. Full disclosure: I gave her my number like a creep cuz I wanted to have a dog play date but she never called me :( she probably thought I was just on MDMA but I  was rly just high on love and passion for my grossly attractive date. We think her name was Nikki but I gotta check my records at home. Yes I said \"check my records\". \n\nThe food was incredible. I ordered a Caesar salad and it had A LOT of dressing on it so I was scared. But I finished the whole thing, it was SO good! The croutons are insane. I told our server how much we liked them and she brought us a little bowl of them to snack on!  \n\nI ordered the petite filet, cooked black and blue. It was the best steak I have ever had in my life. The outside was seared and flavorful and the inside was raw, succulent and juicy, just how my freaky self likes it. It was served on a 500 degree plate swimming in butter. Side note everything should be served on a 500 degree plate swimming in butter TBH. The fact that the steak was so rare yet the plate was so hot was incredible because normally rare juicy steak is not going to be super warm, since you are undercooking and then letting the meat rest. The effect this hot ass plate had on my dining experience was magical. That butter tho. I never knew how much a steak wanted to be drenched in melted butter, it's the right thing to do. The creamed spinach was amazing, I barely renember it because I inhaled it. \n\nI can't talk to you about the bread pudding because I don't want to get emotional or start crying. It was so good.

It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't anything AMAZING or too memorable.\n\n- Parking can be difficult. There are parking lots around the area. Luckily, we found street parking 3 blocks away which isn't bad at all, but if you want to avoid the walk or being late, there's always valet.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience, we had fun trying Ruth's Chris!", "author": "Diana X."}

We elected to use the Restsurant Week program to lower the normal cost that is in the range of $250.00 for us.\n\nWe had a reservstion and were promptly taken to our table. When the waitress saw that we were on the Restaurant Week program we got the feeling that we were being treated like second-class citizens. We ordered drinks and they were quite nice.

It also had more starters and sides to choose from. Gumbo is great but a bit heavy when a big slab of red meat is on it's way. The caesar salad was classic and a large portion! Ribeye was a nice medium and luxuriously covered in sizzling butter. Mashed potatoes and mushrooms were okay. The real gem was the dessert. Upgraded to the Cheesecake and Chocolate Lava cake.

I didn't think not having a reservation was going to be a problem.  The restaurant opens at 4:30, we pulled up at 4:25 and saw people sitting inside so we went in.  The girl at the front desk was on the phone and had her back to me.  She got off the phone and kept her back to me, I am pretty sure she knew we were there since my husband had to walk past her to go to the restroom.  When she turned around I asked if I could put my name on the list for a table of 3?  Her response was, we don't open until 4:30.  I looked at the time and it was 4:27, I replied it's 4:27, you want me to stand right here and come back to the desk at 4:30.  She said again, we don't open until 4:30.  Well okay.  I asked my husband to put our name in at 4:30 because they weren't open yet while I used the restroom.  At 4:30 when he tried to put his name in he was asked if we had a reservation, which we did not.  He was told they were full and our only option was the bar.  I am really not sure why we couldn't have been told this at 4:27.  There were other people sitting and waiting, I am assuming for their reserved time.  But did they get to check in prior to 4:30???  And the people sitting in the bar, did they just go to the bar area on their own free will?  Or were they told they needed a reservation as well?  I don't mind sitting in the bar.

The salads we had were pretty standard salad so that's nothing to really write home about.  Service was pretty slow but decently attentive.

Even though the steaks come out drenched, showered, and splattered with butter, Ruth's Chris just knows how to make steak.  Call it a chain, sure, but this is still the best steakhouse in San Francisco, period. On this particular night, they were serving the Bone In Filet - which is freaking perfect. \n\nIt is evident that they spent a lot of time on the customer experience.  From the always friendly and professional host/hostess, to politely escorting you to your table, to the extremely attentive and over-qualified wait staff, Ruth Chris understands the customer experience, or they did, at least.\n\nAfter another stellar, perfect performance, it was time to pay the bill.  Our waiter dropped off the check, and then promptly showed up with one of those janky, ugly, bright, large, archaic mobile credit card machines.   My friend and I were enjoying our conversation as we wrapped up an amazing meal, and the 12 minute awkward interruption began.  I was handed the device and instructed to swipe my credit card, at the table, over white table cloth.   After inserting my chip, I had to choose the tip amount (right there, while the waiter was looking over me).  I noticed that the device accepted Apple Pay, so I instead took out my phone and to pay via iPhone. While the transaction was processing, the waiter informed me that if I use Apple Pay, I will be unable to tip for some reason.  At this point any positive vibe was broken, and both the waiter and I wanted this process to wrap up asap.  I then had to start over, insert my chip, wait for the VERY SLOW machine to process it, click the TIP button (which would have been easy to miss), insert the tip amount, and then wait for the machine to process the transaction again.  After all this, the waiter handed the device to my friend and the whole process started over!  \n\nA long-time Ruth's Chris superfan, I went away dissatisfied and annoyed -- it didn't feel high end anymore and definitely reflects on the brand.

While we were waiting to be greeted by our server, all we could hear was loud rap music blaring from the back party room (don't get me wrong, I like rap music but a bit inappropriate at an expensing steakhouse). Once our server finally greeted us, we placed our order for app's and those took 25 min to get to the table. When they arrived, our server apologized and informed us the Oakland Raiders were in the large dining room and that the kitchen was backed up (the rap music now made sense). We immediately placed our orders for our entrees and sides and those took another 25 min to come with the steaks being luke warm, the sauce trio messed up and the sides barely edible. We had to motion someone to come over everytime we needed water and our server did not check on us until we told him to clear the table. I would've thought that looking at a table where items are barely touched, a waiter may ask if everything was ok--he did not.

Thank you for a abysmal night out.  \n\nI made 7pm reservations for four for my wife's 50th birthday via the web.  We arrived at exactly 7pm and gave the keys for my car with brand new rims/tires to your valet attendant from Express Parking.  Valet was $14, I gave him $20 and asked him to take care of my car.  He said thank you, and pulled it forward while we waited in the front area.  My wife checked in and was told to have a seat.  We waited about 5-10 minutes prior to being seated.   \n\nThis is where our experience degraded:\n\n* Hadji, our server, did a brief into and then disappeared.\n* We had to ask three times for more bread - I asked random waitstaff as ours was nowhere to be found\n* We had to ask multiple times for drinks and water as our waitstaff was missing\n* Our mixed drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive. \n* My Goose and 7 tasted like water as the ice melted by the time we received them\n* We waited 35+ minutes to have our order taken.  \n* Hadji was very rushed each time he did come to our table.  I interacted with the other waitstaff more than our dedicated server.\n* Hadji told us the mashed potatoes that come with my sons surf and turf was small, so we ordered a separate order.  Turns out it was near full sized.  So we had more potatoes that we needed.\n* We had to flag down random people to top off our water and ask for more bread.  \n* This was my wife's 50th birthday dinner.  No mention of her birthday other than the sprinkled birthday glitter on the table.  I don't know what Ruth's Chris policy is, but I recall on my birthday I was given a small tart or some desert with a birthday wish on it.  Perhaps that was another steakhouse. \n* While it is exciting to see pro athletes, we noticed the difference in service he and his family received next table down from us.  Waitstaff wishing them a happy birthday, etc.  This did not go over well with my wife.  We've seen the nice birthday wish other people receive.  \n* Getting our check took longer than normal.  And, surprising to me, I had to waive my bill holder with my card around in the air to flag down someone other than our waiter to make payment.  \n* Almost two hours to eat dinner without appetizers and without desert.   Most of that time was spent waiting.\n\nAt this point I have a $278 bill, a pissed off wife on her 50th birthday, and I'm trying to figure out why I went out of my way to take her to your restaurant.  We headed out front to get my car, which had been backed up about 50ft to make room for your other valet customers.  The attendant was rude to my wife when she simply said \"the Tesla over there\" pointing to my car.  He rudely said \"oh, I have another one in the garage, do you want that one instead?\"   I was shocked at his curtness and totally unprofessional response.  I told him I'd take my car, thank you.  \n\nWhen he pulled it up he parked it at an odd angle, and was unfriendly and brief giving me the key.  I knew something was wrong but sadly, failed to inspect my entire car.  \nWe we returned home and my flood light turned on I found the rim damage.  The right rear rim has been curb-rashed the entire circumference.  Its beyond me how someone runs the entire rim along a curb.  Anyone who has ever driven a car would STOP when they first made contact with the curb.  \n\nAfter calling you directly four time and leaving messages as you happen to always be busy.  Too busy to call me back.  I'm left writing this review and making sure anyone I do business with knows how we feel about our night with you and the total lack of followup.\n\nYour horrid valet service seems to operate the same way you do; total silence and denial.  They deny they damaged my car and will not even work with my insurance company to work out liability.   I wonder if they even have insurance.  \n\nThe only comfort I have is knowing that business Karma catches up with everyone.  It always does.  You both will have terrible experiences and I'm very sure you'll be treated as you have treated my family; total lack of respect and professionalism.

But, what I found was that their standard has remained the same while my taste and steakhouses around the city have gone up in quality, taste and value for money.\n\nFor starters, I was not impressed with their DAT menu; there were only two items on that menu that was on the regular menu. My girlfriend ordered from the DAT menu, consisting of the house salad (no choice), the 6oz Filet and the chef choice dessert (again, no choice). I opted from their more expensive prix fixe menu, consisting of the Caesar salad (1 of 3 choices), the 12oz Ribeye (1 of 5 choices) and the bread pudding (no choice).\n\nI have nothing to complain about the salads, both of them were full portion and tasty. The steaks were well portioned also and initially they were done properly. However, since they serve their steaks on a VERY hot plate, the steak will continue to cook throughout the meal! My medium rear steak ended up being medium well before I got to the final 1/3! And, I know I shouldn't complain about getting a lean steak, but Ribeyes normally have some marbling giving it some tenderness, mine felt more like a tenderloin than a ribeye. I had a side of mushroom with my steak and they were very flavorful.\n\nBoth of the desserts were just OK. The chef choice dessert turned out to be just a chocolate cupcake with a dollop of icing on top and red sauce swirled around it. The pineapple coconut bread pudding was just so so, nothing to write home about.  \n\nService was kind of inconsistent. Our waitress was very patient with us initially while we were trying to decide whether to go with the DAT, prix fixe or a la carte menu. Then, she pretty much was a no show the rest of the night. Our water man refilled our glasses 3X. The manager did stop by to ask if everything was perfect. But, the slow service made our 3 course dinner last more than 2 hours! At $110 for the two of us, it was a very expensive and barely enjoyable evening.", "author": "Tony L."}

This year we decided to celebrate our anniversary here which happens to fall on a weekday; we even pre-paid for parking at the garage right around the corner, didn't realize the valet parking at Ruth's only costs $10. \n\nArriving early to avoid traffic (before 6pm), the place was almost empty, we had our pick on where to sit, since the more formal area by the window was not open until 6:30, we chose to sit in the bar area close to the front. \n\nService was very attentive and friendly from the start with the rose petals sprinkled on the table. A glass of Merlot for each to start; hubby ordered his NY 16 oz medium rare with an appetizer of crab stuffed mushrooms while I had the 3 course prefix with house salad, filet and lobster and dessert; in addition we ordered the lobster mac N cheese to share. \n\nThe appetizers came within minutes, salad was good, liked the taste of arugula,  stuffed mushrooms were OK, not bad but not great either. \nThe winners were the NY steak, perfectly seared, tender, juicy and super tasty, I had a little taste and the rest was inhaled by a happy hubby. The quality of meat really stood out and was well worth the price. The mac N cheese was also wonderful, rich, cheesy flavorful topped with chunks of lobsters. it had certainly lived up to it's reputation, although not normally a fan of mac  n cheese, I must say it's one of the best .  My filet / lobster combo was good but the steak didn't not look like the ad :) ... it was pretty good but did not blow me away. \n\nWe had candle and ice cream added to the dessert (course #3) and they made it look really nice,  we were also given 2 extra desserts to go as anniversary gift?\n\nOverall we enjoyed Ruth Chris quite a lot, the atmosphere was a little more casual then I anticipated with is a good thing; the cut of steaks are definitely premium and cooked right.

I was skeptical about their claim of having only the top selection of beef in the country, but the steak was seriously impressive. It's served on sizzling hot plates with melted butter, which can't be beat. Favorite cuts are the NY strip and filet. Highly recommend getting the trio of dipping sauces on the side - the teriyaki is my personal favorite, but mushroom and truffle butter are also solid. After sampling a variety of appetizers, our faves are the creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin. Only issue we ever had is when we ordered the brussel sprouts and they were barely even cooked, but the servers were nice and didn't have a problem with us returning the dish. Cocktails were a little strong for my taste, but you definitely get your money's worth! I usually stick to wine, and they have a TON of options, especially if you're getting a bottle. Dessert is also solid, if you're not already stuffed from the meal. Recommend the cr\u00e9me br\u00fbl\u00e9e or white chocolate bread pudding, which comes with your choice of creme anglaise (raspberry is my favorite).

My lucky bf surprised me and of course, he made reservations on the VERY LAST MINUTE. I guess someone didn't show up for their reservation. The wait wasn't very long. And of course they had the lights lovely dimmed. They handed me a yellow rose when we were seated. Just a comment but I guess they had those roses out of water for a while because they were pretty wilted. But it was a really lovely complimentary gift they handed out.\n\nThey had cute little red heart confetti sprinkled all over the table. They of course brought out some warm bread and butter. I found it unusual that the butter wasnt warm temp or whipped. Not complaining but for a real nice place, you'd think they would have thought about that. \n\nI ordered the prefix dinner. The beet, goat cheese salad was divine. It had walnuts and such light dressing! We shared the salad so I wouldn't get too full and it was a nice serving. I ordered rib eye medium rare. It came on a hot plate and their idea is so that every bite is as hot as the first. I definitely recommend medium rare for that reason because it will cook more on the plate. We always wondered what 50$ steak tastes like and oh my god, it was worth every penny. They only use salt and pepper since its such high quality steak they don't want to deter from its original flavor. It didn't need much. It came with buttery mash potatoes. I loved everything it came with. We also shared the dessert which was some sort of chocolate fudge. It was so rich and delicious. It came with fresh fruit and cream sauce. Of my god, I loved it. It wasn't even that chocolatey. \n\nWe also shared the lemon drop. It was a bit strong but we didn't get tipsy off it of course. My bf ordered a rib eye and 2 lobster tails. He ordered medium rare but it came medium sadly. The lobster tails were also a bit overdone. Definitely don't order the lobster tails.\n\nI'd say we will definitely come back once more time.

They are from Sweden and very polite, so she stayed to pay. Yikes!\nWe ordered and started a long wait. Finally after about a half hour the food came. THREE steaks were overcooked. Should have been  2 medium rare, and 1 rare. They were all well done.  We pointed it out and someone came out with a flashlight to examine them. How rude. They were sent back and another 20 minutes passed. Our host's wife ate her potato and I ate my shrimp. It was embarrassing to say the least.

Our server wasn't really on top of his game. We had early reservations so it wasn't even super busy when we were there. You would think the service would be extra good considering they knew we were celebrating something special. We even mentioned to the server neither of us had been there before. He kept thinking it was my birthday even though we told him repeatedly it was my boyfriends birthday. When the food came out we were really disappointed by the quality of the side dishes. The lobster Mac n cheese was super low quality. Not creamy. Severely lacking in flavor all around. Wish we hadn't ordered that. The Brussel sprouts didn't seem cooked well. They were very bitter, oily, and hard. The scalloped potatoes were the best tasting side dish, but it wasn't hot when we were served. It was barely warm. Cheese was barely melted on top. It definitely needed more cooking. Not to mention we actually were brought the wrong side dishes at first and not what we ordered. In addition, My boyfriend ordered the surf and turf and they brought out the steak but not the lobster. When we asked, the waiter said he had forgotten to place that order so it would be awhile. He ate his steak which was super undercooked for how he ordered it. He ate the edges of the steak but inside was way too undercooked. By the time the lobster came out we had already been eating other food and didn't have an appetite for much else. Took it to-go but lobster isn't really good reheated. It was a waste. We ordered dessert and I ordered a coffee with it which was never brought out to me. When we received the bill the waiter mentioned he forgot to bring my coffee. He offered to bring it but we had already finished dessert and we're ready to leave. Was looking to have a superb time and expected stellar service, received the opposite. Disappointed, don't think I'll be back. Lots of other nicer steak places with good service. \n\nThe pros would be the table we had was probably in my opinion the best table in the house. Nice corner location in the back of the room. More private and quiet. Less people walking around us. The confetti on the table was a nice touch for the birthday dinner.

We mentioned how we thought that was a little strange if our reservation was at 5, because you would be slightly late, if you just started getting valeted at 5pm.\n\nWe mentioned we had to park around the corner in the garage and wondered if we could have valet take care of it, so when we were leaving, the car could be brought around, as it was clear that our friend was disabled. She just said no, they do not do that, and that the garage is expensive. (That was obvious, when we parked in it) \n\nShe said that is just how they do it. We then noticed someone getting ready to take care of valet.\n\nWhen we were sitting in the waiting area, we could not help but notice that the glass and mirrors, were in need of cleaning, floors were very dirty. The light shone on the underside of a bench and you could see where it was swept or mopped in certain areas under the bench, but not thorough. \n\nThe restrooms were not as clean as I felt they should be for this type of establishment. The bathrooms were not close to being Disney standard and I feel that Ruth's Chris should top Disney.\n\nWe just felt there was no attention to detail, as there is in other Ruth's Chris restaurants.\n\nWe then noticed someone off the street, with a skateboard, come in and ask to use the bathroom. (We're not snobs, but this is not a Mc Donald's, for someone off the street to come in and just use the bathroom) The hostess told him it was towards the back.\n\nThe man went to the bathroom, I guess, and then came through the waiting room, hopped on his skateboard and left.\n\nWe did not get sat at our table until 5:00pm, on the dot, and valet was still not out.\n\nOnce we were sat, our waiter came and introduced himself. He was VERY good! His name is Kenneth.\n\nHe was on the ball and took care of us very well.\n\nThe food was very good. Everything was good, but my filet was excellent!\n\nI was slightly disappointed about the whole parking issue, as it's not fun having your disabled friend have to walk down a street, that is on a hill, even though the garage had disabled parking, which we used.\n\nIf they took care of the parking and cleaning issues, it would really help this restaurant become the restaurant that fit into the Ruth Chris family.\n\nAll in all its a three star experience with a five star price.

I love that it wasn't totally enrobed in some frying batter. Lightly fried and tossed around in a sauce that tasted like grapefruit, vinegar, cilantro, lemon (I'm probably totally all wrong, but this is what I got from the sauce. and it was great.) It is a pretty big appetizer. \n\nCaesar: I'm never one to order this type of salad, but after looking through reviews, I decided to give it a try! It's a little dressing-heavy, which I don't mind, but if you don't like that much, then you should ask for dressing on the side or light dressing. It is covered in freshly sliced parmesan that is just so great. \n\nCowboy ribeye: YUM. You can see the meat quality, and it was definitely cooked to perfection. \n\nCreamed spinach: it was okay.. a little too creamy and not salty enough so I packed on that salt. \n\n6 oz Filet & Shrimp: For me, it is the perfect size. It is a cute little filet topped with 3 grilled shrimp. Shrimp is tender, juicy, and fat, and the steak was also a deliciously tender. A little butter heavy, but that is the Ruth's Chris signature and Mike warned me at the beginning of the meal.\n\nChocolate Explosion: Perfect end to this meal. Warm, gooey chocolatey goodness topped with cold velvety vanilla ice cream and drizzled in caramel. A win in my book. \n\nOverall, Mike's service really made this meal outstanding and enjoyable.

Ruth Chris isn't my favorite so I personally don't want to pay full price for it. \n\nThere was a man who came to check on us every now and then and refilled our waters. He was very pleasant and warm. The main server lady was interesting. I asked her for the restaurant week menu and she said something along the lines of how they hide the menu and don't bring it out unless people exclusively ask for it. She said it in a tone that made me seem less of a human because I wanted the restaurant week menu and that Ruth Chris was THE GOD OF RESTAURANTS. \n\nListen, lady. To me, Ruth Chris is literally just ok but it definitely isn't THE BEST, MOST EXPENSIVE, MOST FANCY restaurant so please get off ya high horse and give me the restaurant week menu. \n\nI ordered off the restaurant week menu but my boyfriend didn't because he wanted a bigger piece of meat. \n\nThe bread is good. The water is good. The salad is good. The bottle of wine we got was fine. \n\nWe ordered the lobster tail mac and cheese. Apparently, the one they were making for us sat in the oven for too long and got burnt so they made us a new one. I appreciated the honesty and the re-do. When it came out, it was very watery and I was not impressed. Do.not.get.the.lobster.mac. Please. \n\nMashed potatoes: it literally looked like someone took 2 cups of melted butter and poured it in the bowl, put the mashed potatoes in, and then poured more butter on top. I thought it was mashed potatoes and gravy, not mashed potatoes and butter. Barf. \n\nSteak: Yeah, it was real juicy and buttery. The steak was so flavorful, probably because of the butter. Half way through the meal, I saw a 4mm layer of solidified butter on my plate. I kid you not. \n\nI felt really disgusting after the meal. I walked 2 miles home to try to make myself feel better and drank a detox tea before bed. My insides felt very greasy the whole weekend. This is def not a light meal and I def would not go again. My boyfriend felt the same way but at least he can say he's been to Ruth Chris before.", "author": "Esther C."}

My bf was really excited to eat here so he made reservations about a week in advance for Thursday at 7 pm. I'm not much of a steak eater but I was down to try Ruth's Chris. \n\nService: Everyone was super friendly and sweet! (I almost feel guilty giving them 3 stars because everyone there was so nice!) They explained the different steak options and came around frequently enough to check up on us/refill water/refill bread. \n\nFood: We ordered the lobster mac and cheese and the 3 course special with the ribeye steak. We opted for the Cesar salad as our starter. The Cesar salad was yummy - super cheesy (I love cheese), crunchy, and tasty. The lobster mac and cheese however, looks better in photos than it tastes :( I'm not a fan of the little mac and cheese pasta noodle which is what they used and the cheese was a bit too liquidy. \n\nThe ribeye was really rich. My bf thought it was alright but didn't care to eat there again.", "author": "Kayla O."}

New, trendy, artsy steakhouses turn me off - I want consistent tried and true steak on a sizzling platter.\n\nRuth's Chris is a New Orleans institution that carries a few New Orleans recipes on their menu world wide. The N.O. BBQ Shrimp is the best around, and even rivals Mr. B's in New Orleans...they beat Pascal's Manale by a bit, and Manale's claims to be the originator of the dish!\n\nService was top notch, we were seated exactly on time, and the wine the waiter suggested was just right. We suggest that you get a lobster mac-n-cheese side. That, and a steak is plenty to eat.\n\nOur last visit to a Ruth Chris was in Hong Kong!! It was just as good, but as you can imagine, it was double the price.\n\nI doubt you would find a better steak in SFO, and if you said you did, I might argue with you over it!", "author": "Ken K."}

I didn't enjoy my first time at Ruth's Chris at a different location but it was a lot better at the SF location. I ordered the Ruth's classic, consisting of the steak salad, 12 oz ribeye, creamed spinach, and a dessert. The steak salad was perfect and wasn't too filling- definitely have to try the champagne vinaigrette!! The ribeye was amazing! I had it prepared medium rare and it was perfectly juicy and the flavors were so good. I was a bit hesitant ordering this at first because the last time I had the ribeye at another Ruth's Chris, it was underseasoned, but I definitely made the right choice. The creamed spinach was a bit bland this time and it was just okay. For the dessert, I upgraded to the creme brulee for an additional $4 and it was perfect. The creme brulee is a big portion and the custard is amazing!!", "author": "Cindy C."}

I don't recommend making a special trip out here just for restaurant week. They do have a special restaurant week menu but the prix fixe dinner they offer every day is very similar. So I ended up getting the restaurant week special which was the house salad, petite filet with creamed spinach and a carrot cake dessert. Mainly because it came with a dessert and the prix fixe did not. My friends got the prixe fixe and it comes with shrimp and steak (surf and turf) along with a salad and side (we tried the mac & cheese and the corn). My steak was nicely cooked and tender. And I liked all the sides we had except for the mac & cheese since it had a slight kick to it (from jalapenos?) and I'm not a fan of spicy. I also don't think that that was how it was advertised on the menu. It was about a $50 meal. Service was good. We made a reservation on open table, I think and they seated us promptly when we all arrived. Parking in the city is a pain but lots of paid garages around. It's not really around BART or that would be way more convenient.", "author": "Alison W."}

We all cleared our plates out! Fresh cracked pepper on top really made it one of the best I've had.\n\n- Filet - seriously such a great cut of meat. It has that buttery and velvety taste that you long for in a filet but they made my portion just a tad too salty compared to my friend's filet, which they had done perfectly.\n\n- Lobster tail - Good but doesn't taste fresh, so I'll prob come back only for the steaks.\n\n- Lobster mac n cheese - Ok, this was my go-to dish all night! So glad we upgraded the sizing on this. You get chunks of whole lobster in here and the flavoring was done perfectly, not too cheesy or salty.\n\n- Mashed potato - Standard, not great.\n\n- Potato au gratin - Pretty cheesy and quite buttery. It started forming a layer of grease on top and it didn't look appetizing after 20 min of sitting there so we skipped this.\n\n- Creamed spinach - It's good but the ratio is a bit off; I would have liked more spinach. \n\n- Chocolate duo - Actually found that this wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. Not bad with an extra scoop of vanilla ice cream!\n\nIt's a three star experience.

We got seated right after we arrived, and out server Jessica was so nice and informative. We both have the Ruth Classic with ribeyes and we shared mashed potatoes and creamy spinach.... Oh wait, I forgot about the corn chowder with crumbled bacon on top. It was huge and super tasty. The meat was sizzling on a hot plate, and it was scrumptious... Mashed potatoes was great but I slightly liked the creamy spinach better. We were full after that, then come the key lime cheesecake... Ending the dinner with lime flavor was brilliant idea.

Nonetheless, I wanted to give one of the restaurants a try and I've heard many good things about the Ruth's Chris chain so we chose this place as our one stop.\n\nComing in late on a Sunday night, we were surprised to see so many empty tables. Admittedly, the place is pretty big so even 3/4ths of the place being full is a lot of people but considering 8:45pm was the only reservation we were offered... We were just confused. ANYWAYS, that thought was wiped away once we sat down and our server came over. I wish I could remember his name (it's been a while) but this guy was so friendly and so well-versed on the menu. A+ for that.\n\nWe told him we were here for Restaurant Week and he let us in on the option that their prix-fixe menu was less than $5 more with way more options. Okay, convinced. For the salad, I ordered a Caesar salad which is what I always get but I forgot to ask for dressing on the side so it was drowning in dressing as usual. For my entree, I got scallops which were huge, delicious, and probably the best scallops I've ever had. The sides were a light cream of spinach and dank mashed potatoes - seriously, I could've eaten 5 of them. I also wanted to order every potato option as there were quite a few and they ALL sounded so good but luckily my dude said no. For dessert (which I only had room for one bite) was Key Lime Pie. No, I'm not talking about a small to large slice that I've usually seen... I'm talking a whole mini (but not that mini) pie that was heavy and ridiculous.\n\nI immediately went to sleep when I got home, which probably wasn't the best idea... but it was awesome.", "author": "Kat C."}

For the money and name, I did expect more. Let me just break down what we ate:\n\n1. Bread with butter (bread was very soft and very warm.)\n\n2. Caesar salad (expect a lot of cheese and dressing. order light on these items if you don't like a lot of either on your salads. The plate was very cold but the actual salad was a bit warm, so that was disappointing.)\n\n3. Filet cooked medium (it was tender and  perfectly cooked. Had 3 shrimp on top of it. the flavor was average. Same as any other steak house in this price range.)\n\n4. Asparagus (grilled and Charcoaled- average) had better at home. They need to add seasoning. Didn't even finish this between the 2 of us.)\n\n5.  Mashed potatoes (also lackluster - basic with lots of butter melted on them.)\n\n6. Chocolate molten cake- which is my favorite dessert. It was good, not hot like other places serve it. Had to order a la mode to get a scoop of vanilla ice cream. They serve it with a chocolate heavy cream and whip that are good too. I would eat Flemings over this one any day of the week. Or dominick's if given the choice. It was good, just not as good as other places that serve it.\n\nThe service was as expected. the table we sat at was very close to the date occurring at the table\nOn the side or us, directly in front of the window.

All had great attitudes.\n\nThe food was tasty, however, I expected a bit more for the $200+ meal for two. Sweet and sour calamari was stellar as was the perfectly al dente grilled asparagus with delicate hollandaise sauce. Baked potatoe with fixin's was devoured. \n\nThe Caesar salad, though very tasty with a generous shaving of parmesan seemed either over dressed and gloppy or wilted, but not sure or maybe it was both. It seemed like it was more chopped salad style which I detest. Again, it was tasty but not crisp, airy and lightly dressed. It sat flat on the plate weighed down. The croutons were too tiny not really giving you a nice crunch, but became sodden by too much dressing. This style of preparation seemed out of place for this establishment where quality is expected.\n\nIll timing interrupted our salads and appetizer with our main entrees so we had to push them aside causing what was left of them to get cold, more wilted and abandoned.\n\nThe medium rare t-bone arrived sizzling on the ultra hot plate with beefy aromas wafting in the air. The tenderloin on the steak was really quite small as if half was missing, so I felt a bit cheated there. The flavor was okay, but for $58 for prime, it actually seemed a bit bland and tough with extra bits of tough sinew as well. Something was amiss here. I cringe at saying this, but I've had better flavored, tender steaks from the meat counter at Safeway and the tenderloins are bigger. I just feel horrible saying that. I am truly surprised by this since this place has always had rave reviews. \n\nWould I come back? Only if someone paid my way again.\n\nThey greeted my birthday meal with birthday sprinkles on the table. Nice touch. They also brought out a scoop of ice cream, a mini key lime cheese cake and pieces of chocolate bark with embedded salted nuts on an artfully designed plate spelling happy birthday.

The occasion was for the boyfriend's birthday, which I noted on the reservation as well. We got there about 15 minutes early, but we were seated within a few minutes. There were a good amount of open tables from the time we got there to the time we finished. We were then greeted by our waiter, explained the menu to us, and started our orders. We both went with the Ruths Classic, which includes a starter, entr\u00e9e, side, and dessert. I had the filet mignon and the boyfriend had the ribeye, which were both pretty good. Also, I enjoyed the tomatoe bisque soup and caesar salad. I prefer the mash over creamy spinach. Dessert was on the sweeter side even though I definitely have a sweet tooth. The food didn't take the longest time, but it could've been quicker. Before the food came out the waiter placed happy birthday decorations on the table. The reason for my stars isn't because I didn't enjoy my meal, but I guess I just had higher expectations. For what we paid for, I was hoping that there was going to be more of a special feel and I think a big part was that we didn't feel a connection or something with our waiter. Im not saying we had to be like bffs, but you just know when your waiter/waitress is hands down the best compared to having mediocre service. Sometimes, I feel like we just look young so we're treated differently but that's just my opinion. Before even making a reservation I went through reviews, so i had expectations. Also, i know that you can pay a mini fee to substitute some things. When it was time for dessert our waiter asked if we were ready for dessert, which we answered yes but I thought he'd at least ask if we'd like to switch things up or go with the deasert that went along with our prix fixe meal. It wasnt a big deal because i guess we didnt ask, but i only knew from reviews and he mentioned substituting items briefly when we were ordering in the beginning, but im sure not everyone is aware of that option.

Waiting for nearly an hour even though we had made a reservation a few months ago was just no bueno. The food was good. The wait staff was ok, although I didn't get what I ordered and the sides were cold. \n\nThe front of house staff was mediocre at best. Zero customer service skills were demonstrated when - towards the end of the evening I complained about the wait. From there, the front of house staff person managed to throw another employee under the bus for making our reservation saying, \"a reservation for a party of 19 should have never been taken in the first place.\" Really?? Do you think this is what I want to hear after just dropping $1400? Wow.\n\nNo apologies for the wait were EVER rendered. No offer of even a round of drinks for our guests who stood inside and outside because there was really no room to stand around. It was terribly poor planning on their part not to seat us immediately, or make amends for being completely unprepared.\n\nTo make matters even worse, besides paying with a AMEX gold card, we had two Ruth Chris gift cards as part of the payment. The person taking our money (not our server) came back and announced that the cards were \"no good.\" Wow. My husband insisted he run them again and he did and got one of them to work.  Nothing like being made to feel like an asshole at your own party as if we were trying to pass off BAD Ruth Chris gift cards! \n\nSuffice to say - the staff at this location all need customer service training. Even our server who was a nice enough guy, but when I asked him about who to talk to about the long wait I got a speech in a big loud voice ( it left me feeling like he was yelling at me for asking who to talk to)  about how it was \"out of his pay grade to address this situation.\"  So basically NO ONE bothered to really address it!! Excuses of all kinds were made. Other employees thrown under the bus. The whole situation left me embarrassed in front of our family and friends.\n\nI will never again return to this restaurant.", "author": "Vee B."}

We had a waiter named Patrick and he was simply awesome. Great customer service and very attentive. Also. I was running late for my reservation due to traffic and the ladies at the front desk were very accommodating even though I showed up after the grace period. \nFor food, I ordered the ruths classic with a medium well rib eye, Caesar salad, and creamed spinach. I also got a baked potato and a lobster tail on the side. Skip the lobster tail. It's not worth the price. I even found a hair on mine so I had to send it back. The steak was a little overdone, but it was OK. The salad was also ok. I chose this restaurant because the others were booked and it was familiar. I will come back, but hopefully the food is better.\nP.s. order the blackberry sidecar, it's delicious.", "author": "Jae L."}

The bf and I planned a low-key New Year's eve with just dinner and no crazy parties. (hmm...grandma and granpa status!) We also had a $75 gift card to spend and that helped greatly with the bill!\n\nI purposely starved myself before coming here and of course as soon as we sat down, warm bread arrived.  Slathered on some buttah (ok, a lot of butter!) and I was happy.  The mushroom caps stuffed with crabmeat is awesome with a sprinkling of Romano cheese on top. \n\nCocktails arrived soon after and I have to say I am NOT impressed. I still downed my nola reviver (too much on the lemon juice!) and the bf liked his old fashioned because it was clearly heavy on Maker's Mark. But, why do most places make this with cherries and big orange slices?! I digress...\n\nOur entrees were put down with care onto our table (very hot!) and we haven't eaten at a steak house in awhile, so we savored every bite in silence. My filet mignon was perfectly pink in the center at medium rare and the lobster that came with it didn't need additional butter!  That combo was at a very affordable $46.95! Bf's ribeye was amazing.  How amazing did the meats turn out? Ruth's Chris cooks their meat in BUTTER. (now, you know the secret!) \n\nFantastic service, relaxing ambiance and great value.", "author": "Janice C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-01", "description": "Ate here for the first time last night. It was a last minute choice and I was able to make a same-say Saturday night reservation. \n\nStrangely, although the only reservations available online were for 5:45pm and 6:45pm, the restaurant was largely empty when we arrived ~15 minutes ahead of our 5:45pm reservation time. Not complaining about that exactly; now I know where to go on Saturday night if we've craving steak and a walk-in table.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. A caesar salad to share, at the recommendation of our waiter when I asked whether he'd recommend the caesar or the wedge salad. It was largely forgettable and I couldn't taste any anchovy flavors. Came with plenty of cheese, and oddly, half slices of grape tomatoes. Not traditional. I've had some of the most iconic caesar salads in the world and can make a better one than 99.9% of most restaurants, so I'm very picky on that front. 2/5. \n\n2. The BBQ shrimp appetizer. This was delicious, but overpriced ($17 for five pieces of shrimp???). To make it worth your while, make sure they don't take the plate away even after you eat all the shrimp (admittedly quite delicious and perfectly cooked). The remaining sauce is delectable. Dip your bread in the sauce, maybe even your meat. And protect the plate from being carried away until and unless you've satisfactorily sopped away as much as possible. 4/5 (would be 5/5 if the pricing wasn't crazy). \n\n3. A couple of drinks: a hurricane and either a lime drop or a daiquiri (I forget which but they're basically the same drink except the former uses vodka as the spirit; the latter, rum). \n\nThe hurricane was tasty in its way but odd. Used regular ice instead of the more pebble-y ice I associate with hurricanes. The second drink was fine but forgettable. Both drinks were $15 each and thus way over-priced. 1.75/5 (and this feels generous, TBH). Ruth's Chris originated in New Orleans; they should have a fantastic hurricane (its birthplace). They don't. Or at least not at the SF location. \n\n4. The petite filet mignon (8oz), ordered medium rare and was served exactly so. \n\nDamn. \n\nNow THAT was delicious. I'm normally a NY Steak or flatiron steak (the latter when I'm being cheap) gal, and usually consider filter mignon to be boring (albeit tender). The quality and flavor of this particular filet was outstanding; and in fact, exceeded expectations. \n\nEasily a 6/5. No fat, no gristle, just tender, tender steak and surprisingly beefy tasting for filet mignon. I have a petite appetite so I wasn't able to finish it on my own, but my partner very much appreciated the slices I cut off and deposited onto his plate :D. \n\n[Side note: Ruth's Chris's schtick is cooking steak at 1,800 degrees and serving them on 500 degree plates. Worked for me. Sizzle, sizzle]. \n\n5. My partner ordered a much larger piece of meat. I think it was either a porterhouse or T-bone (not sure the difference?). He went in intending to order the NY steak but spotted a bigger steak on the menu and went with that instead (he has a rather....large...appetite). He noted that it was a bit fatty and gristly, and had to cut off pieces to make it edible. I didn't taste it, but based on his description and how much it cost, I'm guessing it was a 2/5 or 3/5. A bummer, as it looked to be a very costly hunk of meat based on size alone. \n\n6. The sweet potato casserole. Delicious and sweet enough to be a dessert. A standout side and way, WAY better than most steakhouse sides (I've never met a creamed spinach that I would wax euphorically re:). But yes, very sweet, to the point of being cloying (but I still loved it). We were too stuffed to eat the whole thing but took it home as a leftover. Spectacular, but don't order if you're diabetic or on the verge of becoming so. 5/5.\n\nIn sum, the service was fine. Some aspects of our meal were mediocre but others were amazing. I don't feel like giving them three stars is fair, but I also don't quite feel like they earned four stars either. I hovered repeatedly over both ratings (A-OK (3 stars) vs. Yay, I'm a fan! (4 stars)) and in the end, went with four stars. We'll be back again based on the highlights but will order differently next time. Needle nudged in 4-star direction for that reason alone.\n\nFinal notes: the free bread is just decent but the butter is amazing (whipped, light as air). And you can request garlic butter -- even better! -- but keep in mind that the garlic is probably raw (which I love; my partner doesn't).  \n\nTook photos of all the food but none of them came out that well hence I'm not posting any -- we were in a dark corner (but no complaints there; it set the mood :D).", "author": "Maya B."}

We made a dinner reservation earlier and were promptly seated upon arrival. In addition the table was sprinkled with rose petals, and the lighting was dim, which added to the romantic atmosphere. Our server was very attentive, but not too attentive. I rather like when servers are aware of the conversations of guests and allow for privacy until a moment arrives to ask if anything is needed or even when simply called upon. She was just the right combination for the occasion. We ordered calamari and salads to start and were very pleased with both choices. The calamari was not dry and had just the right seasoning so as to enhance the flavor.  We both ordered the filet mignon with lobster and shrimp and were not disappointed when the entrees arrived. As is their custom the steaks are cooked right not he plate so they were sizzling and made to perfection. It was a rather delightful meal, and an even better atmosphere. We were both so satisfied to even order desert, but our server graciously presented us with a small desert to commemorate the special occasion. We were extremely satisfied with our evening and will definitely be back soon.", "author": "Jeremy R."}

Let me preface that the host is a private orthopaedic surgeon who happens to be African American. Reservations were for 5 pm and Van Ness is a hell hole around that time, so it was stop-go until we finally arrived at 5:16 pm. Host and his wife were sitting at the bar and told us that the ma\u00eetre d' told him they were \"...(A)bout to cancel my reservation.\" (Strike 1) Then when we were seated, one person from our party couldn't make it so it was four instead of five. The waitress begins to remove plate, flatware and stemware AND THE CHAIR. Huh? I asked if she could leave the chair so that the women could place their purses there. She did.\n\nThe host then tells us that while he and his wife were at the bar, they ordered drinks, but the bartender never came back to their end of the bar. (Strike 2) Waiter was very courteous and attentive. We ordered and also ordered cocktails. For the gin and tonic the options he gave were, \"Bombay Sapphire or Tanqueray?\" Um, I haven't had Bombay Sapphire in 10 years and this is not a Snoop Dogg video. Hell no, I don't want Tanqueray. Y'all charge $52 for a steak, Tanqueray should only be used to fuel the grill! \"Do you have Hendrick's?\" Oh, magically Hendrick's is an option.\n\nGot our cocktails. Two people have Hendrick's & Tonic, one had Hendrick's on the rocks and the other had a Hendrick's Martini. Three sips. Tonic was flat --absolutely no fizz. \"Hendrick's\" was barely noticeable. The person who had Hendrick's on the rocks immediately says, \"This is watered down.\" (Strike 3)\n\nTwo of us got the Ruthe's Classic and the other the \"Surf & Turf.\" \n\nFor starters, two of us started with the white bean soup with chorizo. I didn't quite know what to make of the soup... When it came, it was in a tomato(?) broth with julienned basil (why?) and cut up pieces of chorizo. I don't know why I was thinking it would be a creamy broth with ground chorizo and a bitter green like kale, but it wasn't. It wasn't bad, it just threw me off. My mistake for not asking for clarification. The other guest said the soup was not hot enough. \n\nAccording to one guest,the lobster tails that came with the surf & turf were mushy and tasted like they just boiled the lobster in plain water until it was mushy. Yuck.\n\nThe person who got the arugula salad with walnuts and apples said it was very good.\n\nHUGE BROWNIE POINTS: Steaks were magnificent! Everyone loved their steaks!\n\nThe steaks were seasoned with just salt and pepper, and were the perfect shade of pink. They were flavorful, juicy and tender.\n\nHere's the whomp-whomp-whooooomp part. The sides came five minutes after the sizzling steaks. We also ordered a bottle of wine for the table. The waiter didn't present the wine list until the host asked. So we couldn't get the tonic spritzer taste out of our mouth until halfway through the meal. \n\nThe creme brulee was INCREDIBLE, as was the bread pudding. I asked for coffee and another guest asked for espresso. Both came when we were halfway through our dessert. \n\nThere was enough food that I brought the rest of mine home.\n\nCircling back to the \"We're going to 'cancel' your reservations\" b.s. Three different tables with parties of 4+ ALL HAD PEOPLE WHO CAME LATER!! \n\nThere were plenty of kids and parents at the restaurant, so maybe that's a draw for them, but I've been treated crappily in better steakhouses than this one. There's valet parking and the valets were awesome for not noticing that my car looked like a \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" prop. \n\nI was disappointed in this place, especially by it being on Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco. They seemed genuinely confused by African Americans. The host never threw his credentials or title in their face, but I kind of wish he had because their ma\u00eetre d' and staff need to have a clue that you treat customers as well as you'd like to be treated, and to stop creating micro-aggressions and static environments for certain customers. Also, the wait staff need to work on their food service skills and time the service better. \n\nI'm pretty sure that I won't be back and would never recommend this amateurish restaurant to any of my family, friends or co-workers.", "author": "Adrienne A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-01", "description": "This was my first visit to a Ruth's Chris and it did not disappoint.  My steak was perfectly cooked and delivered in a shallow pool of melted butter (be still my waistline!)  The shoe string potatoes were very crispy so if that's what you're in to, that's the side for you.  We also had the corn with chiles which was immensely tasty.  The corn tasted very fresh, we were wondering where you can get good sweet corn in February in San Francisco.\n\nSome low points that knocked a star off the experience: I ordered a gin martini that arrived with lots of ice chunks floating in it.  This means the martini was shaken.  There's a reason why James Bond specifies that his martinis be made shaken, it's because that's not the default preparation.  I (unlike James) prefer a stirred martini.  I suppose I should have specified, but I didn't think that I had to since that's the norm.  Alas, it was a passable martini, but I feel like an old-school steak house should have nailed it.\n\nAlso the decor seemed a bit stodgy and dated.  To be sure, traditional steak houses never have avant garde, innovative interiors, but this one seemed a bit more unpleasantly \"weird old basement\" than should be expected for a nice restaurant in SF.\n\nWe were way too full for dessert, so I can't speak to it, but I did see a miniature cheesecake walk by and it looked delightful.  (By miniature, I mean smaller than a normal cheesecake, but make no mistake, it was giant.  Seemed way larger than a typical slice of cheesecake)\n\nOverall it was quality dining and attentive service.", "author": "Rachel S."}

We were given a moment to look at the menu when we weren't ready but we were never checked upon afterwards to at least place in our drink order. The wait was long enough that we were staring around. By the time she came we had to place our appetizers, drinks, entree, and side orders. it was annoying to have to go through that long of a list because we weren't attended to enough. Wine came first, than the bread, followed by the calamari. Half of our wine, half of the bread and all of the calamari was gone by the time our food even came out. We were on the cusp of getting full and our server was no where in sight to check up on us and when she did, it was to take our orders again. She obviously forgot about us and apologized once she realized we were  existing patrons. Our food finally came out and it was delicious. Too bad the specialty knives that we were supposed to use wasn't given to us from the beginning. Midway through the dinner I realized that my wine had a bubble in it, shined the flashlight from my phone and it was a fruit fly! Our server offered another glass but by that time, we were ready to pack our steaks to go because we were full. However she did take off the wine from our check as I requested. Overall, food was amazing, server was engaging but her attentiveness was few and far in between. I couldn't tip her the way I wanted to because Ruth Chris's has a mobile card swipe system that generates a receipt that the server holds. So it was awkward placing the tip with the server holding it. We definitely can't bring ourselves to coming here again because of our experience.

Creamed spinach was good too but not the best I've had. Lobster mac n cheese was great!! I love mac n cheese and they had a generous portion of lobster in it too. \n\nThe steaks were both amazing. So they only season it with salt and pepper and then after cooking it, they finish it by broiling it in (I think) a 1800 degree oven. So the plates are super hot so they emphasize on not touching it (I did move my plate closer to me but by using my jacket sleeves and I could feel the heat through them). The sizes of the steak were great and it was super tender. SO GOOD!! \n\nHonestly one of the best meals I've ever had. We basically only finished half of our meal so we took the leftovers (and I had a great lunch the next day haha).

You definitely get what you pay for at this place. \n\nI'd recommend ordering from Ruth's Classic Menu. It gives you two options, one more expensive than the other (about $45-$55).

My friends have raved about their juicy steaks, but mine had every drop of juicy life squeezed out of it :( \n\nI asked for my ribeye medium rare and it came out well-done. I didn't even eat half of it because it was so dry. Why didn't I send it back? Because our waiter (Clarke?) was even harder to deal with than the steak -____-\n\nWe had a reservation so we were seated quickly, but we waited 20 minutes before we were even greeted by our waiter. It was 8pm on a Tuesday so there were maybe 3-4 other parties in the dining room. When he finally showed up, he was pleasant, but no apologies were offered. We ordered our drinks and that took ANOTHER 20 minutes to get. The whole time he was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. We were hungry, we wanted to order. Eventually we caught a glimpse of him at the bar (outside of our dining room) and he appeared to just be standing there waiting for our drinks to be ready. At least come take our order while you're waiting! Finally, he returned with our drinks and we were able to order. \n\nThe food came out after in a decent amount of time, but it was brought out by other people. Again, our waiter had completely disappeared! My boyfriend's steak was done appropriately (also medium rare), but mine was dry and I didn't send it back. I don't ever send food back, but I may have in this situation because of where we were at. This is supposed to be a high-quality steakhouse. However, with the waiter no where to be found, it was pretty much impossible anyway. The dinner dragged over hours -- more waiting to ask for the bill, waiting for him to bring the bill, waiting for him to collect the bill, and waiting to sign the darn bill. It was ridiculous. \n\nOther thing that was kind of disappointing is that people were dressed in hoodies, basketball shorts, and other super casual attire. Halfway through our meal, a group of guys dressed in hoodies and who reeked of weed were seated in the booth next to us.

Come on  who  has ever heard of a Wedge salad with Green goddess dressing  and  CORN ..       next  the Birthday  person ordered  medium rare  filet ..  came out  well done ..   then last but not least   the waiter throws  3 deserts on the table with out asking  if  we wanted to upgrade them   since  ONE of us is  allergic to  NUTS .      I have to ask myself is it me or the  restaurant.  !     please feel free to tell me if Im wrong . thanks            lets not forget .. nothing from the waiter saying  happy b day ..  just throw the  plates on table and walked off ..

As soon as we sat down, the servers delivered plentiful amounts of their complimentary freshly baked french rolls with whipped butter and they were so delicious when freshly out of the oven.  I probably ate more than I should have but I couldn't help it and the servers were constantly refilling our basket.  We all ordered the Ruth's classic, which is an appetizer (salads, soup), an entree (ribeye, filet, salmon, etc), and a dessert (fixed).  I ordered the Caesar salad and was pleasantly surprised by how large it was.  It was tossed well in the dressing and came loaded with lots of parmesan shavings.  I thought it was delicious, albeit a little heavy/salty with all of the dressing and cheese.  Next came my 16 oz ribeye cooked a perfect medium rare on a 500 degree plate.  I'd never had my steak served on a hot plate before but wow does it make a difference.  Each bite of my food was perfectly warm and it helped bring out the flavor of the beef.  My ribeye was seasoned very well and had a good meat to fat ratio.  I got the creamed spinach as a side and I thought it was rich and tasty, although I can see why it might not be for everyone due to the strong spinach flavor.  For dessert, I had the chocolate espresso torte with a side of creme anglaise and mixed berries.  The torte had a rich chocolate flavor, although I didn't taste the espresso much.  The berries and cream were a nice side component to lighten up the dessert and helped keep it from being too overwhelmingly sweet.  The service here was fantastic and we had no less than 3 servers at a time constantly checking up on us, refilling water & bread, and delivering food.  They were all very friendly and welcoming, making our dining experience very pleasant.  Overall, we had an excellent experience here and I would definitely come back!", "author": "Tiffany L."}

We sat in a cozy booth under dimly lit lighting making the ambiance very cozy with the smooth jazz tunes playing softly in the background.\n\nWe all decided to have our first tomahawk ribeye -one between the couples.  This ultimate carnivore's  delight arrived with a bone approximately 12\" long!  -quite the spectacle!  They cut the meat off for us in our presence, and we ladies opted to give our men the bone for etiquette's sake.  My honey was kind enough to hold it in my direction for me to unleash my refined savagery intermittently though.  The meat was cooked perfectly with simple salt, pepper and some butter.  We were given options of steak knives out of a formal wooden box.  The German knife was serrated and larger - more appropriate for the men.  We ladies chose the smaller, more delicate, sleeker looking French knife.  Either one did the job of slicing succulent morsels of ribeye.  With our steaks, we couldn't pass up the lobster mac and cheese.  I could have easily over dosed on this.  The roasted Brussel sprouts with bacon and honey were just as tasty as the asparagus with hollandaise sauce.  We washed our food down with a bottle of Stag's Leap Artemis cab- perfect steak pairing.\n\nWe usually don't do dessert, but the temptation was too much.  That creme brulee was one of the best if not the best we'd ever had.  The sweet custard below was rich and contrasted perfectly with the crispy caramel top.  The berries were a perfect accessory to this decadent dessert.  \n\nAll of us were at max capacity but extremely satisfied with the whole experience.  Water glasses stayed full.  Dishes were cleared quickly.  Staff was warm, and friendly.   It was a huge splurge but well worth it!

On a typical cold San Franciscan Summer afternoon after work in the middle of the week, we stepped in and felt the warmth of a very sincere and friendly greeter.\n\nWe both were handed a menu that was heavier than the ten commandments.  One eating menu. And volume two the cocktail menu.\n\nIt was \"Dine-About-Town\" night (woo-hoo), so that meant for two, we'd get excellent quality, upscale food at Denny's prices.\n\nWell, not so fast.\n\nLet's face it, the \"DAT\" menu lacked anything appealing.  Four courses, but not enough meat.\n\nSo what ended up happening  was we ordered from the overpriced option instead (scam!).\n\nBefore I talk about the dishes, let's describe the interior.  It's like a Rembrandt painting.  So darkly lit that when you check you cell phone for texts, you're blinded.  I guess that's part of the SF goth charm.  The seating seemed a bit disappointing.  With reservations, we didn't have a booth, but a half booth.  I didn't appreciate that.  Where I sat, I sunk.  To make matters worst, the neighboring tables were too close which means you're forced to hear the arrogant chatter of others and if you're really unlucky, you're seated next to loud boisterous know-it-alls.\n\nSo, I guess you could say I didn't find the ambiance here to be that appealing.\n\nAside from two other things, I've summed up the negatives of RCSH.\n\nOur server was super friendly and cool.  She politely and sincerely cued us in that the DAT menu more-or-less sucked and that we should just order from combination specials they sold at regular price (about $12-$16 more per person than the DAT menu).\n\nI tried the 12 oz prime rib which came with a tortellini chicken soup, a cauliflower dish, and a bread pudding dessert.  I also ordered a glass of Malbec (Alamos 2012, from Mendoza wine region).  All in all, pretty decent.\n\nIn all honesty, I might come again if I'm in a steak mood.  This is because the service was pretty good and the portion size just about right.", "author": "Tony U."}

We paired it with the Seven Trees merlot.\n\nThe food was excellent. My medium-rare steak was cooked perfectly. Although the gumbo was good, it was a bit on the heavier side thus I could not finish my steak. The wine mixed perfectly with our meal. The dessert was chocolate cake with bark. It was a bit on the sweeter side but a good ender to the evening.\n\nWe had reservations at 7:15pm and were promptly seated. Our server, Chelsea, was helpful during ordering. However, water was very, very slow to be refilled. We had to ask her to refill it to her astonishment. \n\nThere is valet parking out front, which is probably recommended. It is located on a busy part of Van Ness so it may be tough to find any street parking.

They don't have a good enough of a crust for me here but it's still good enough for 4*.\n\n\u00a4 Crab Cakes (2*). A lot of crab meat but also a little too much breading. The flavor is ok.

Made a reservation about a week in advance via Opentable. It was for an early dinner on a Wednesday but for some reason they sat us at one of the two tables right next to the bar. Not exactly my idea of a fine dining experience to hear bar patrons being obnoxious. I will say the service was excellent which saved it from a one-star rating. Our waiter was attentive and polite. There were two young ladies at the other table and they were obviously inexperienced, ordering things like \"the best steak\" and asking for it very well done. Their server was very polite to them, helping them with their order and was not at all pretentious or condescending. \n\nThe food was another story. We went with their 3 course special because it seemed like a great value and their choices seemed good. Salads were a bit boring. My spinach, strawberry, and goat cheese salad was bland and my partner's Cesar was equally as boring. \n\nMy main dish was the ribeye which I ordered medium-rare, but arrived closer to medium-well. The quality of the steak was not great. It had a bit too much chew to it, possibly because it was a bit overcooked, but I think it had to do more with the quality. I am no conspiracy theorist, but I have a feeling that they have \"Choice\" instead of \"Prime\" steaks reserved for folks who order the special because it did not seem as nearly as marbled or tender as a Prime cut should be. Believe me, I know my steaks and this was not a Prime cut.\n\nThe scallops that my partner ordered were even more disappointing as they were overcooked. This is to be expected at places like TGI Fridays, Red Lobster or other chains of that caliber, but we were not expecting to get rubbery scallops from Ruth's Chris. \n\nDessert was o.k. I had the creme brulee which is difficult to screw up but the key lime cheesecake was a little too sweet, lacking the tartness of the lime, and the texture was not at all like cheesecake, but rather some odd rubbery jello...or better yet, overcooked scallops. \n\nAs mentioned before, my experience at other Ruth's Chris establishments have all been great but this one left a bad taste in my mouth, literally.", "author": "quiahuiteuh a."}

We were placed in a side room where an alcohol specialist from Florida described the different cocktails that we would drink throughout the night. It was the first time they hosted such an event, and I think it was well planned, but poorly executed.\n\nWhat I mean by that is that people made reservations for the cocktail not, and many did not show. From my experience from many events hosted by other places like Chase Insider, all people are required to pay prior to coming. Because they did not have to pay, half did not show up, which made the event look weak for my clients (they were wondering why it was half empty).\n\nThe meal overall was tasty. The steak was good - on par with other Ruth Chris restaurants I have attended. The shrimp cocktail for an app was probably the best.

But if you can get past the chain part, they do a really good job. We had a 7:30 reservation on Friday 7/28 and the only negative is that we had to wait about five minutes to be seated. I'm always impressed when a host or hostess takes you directly to your table at arrival, but that didn't happen. Only a small negative. The best value on the menu are the price fix items on the left hand side of the menu. Salad, entree, a side and dessert for only $45 or $55 depending on the entree. Everything was prepared perfectly and waiter Chris (not related to Ruth) was friendly and good at his job. What I also like is that this restaurant does not add a 4% employee benefit tax to the bill.  I avoid most of these extra tax restaurants, which greatly limits my dinning choices in San Francisco.", "author": "Jim A."}

I had my doubts and honestly even thought about going elsewhere for our dinner of celebratory proportions of 5 ppl... Luckily, I was convinced to keep the reservation and I must grudingly admit that I was impressed...well, maybe I'm just not needy enough..? To that I say, the place was expensive.. and of solid quality. Ruth Chris seems truthful in it's advertising.. combining hearty midwestern steak and potatoes fare with fine dining service.. not overdone.. a little pricey, but they came through. \n\nLet's get to it, you came for the beef right? \n\nPetit Filet - Medium well minus a couple degrees.. yes they can do that.. and with a 1200 degree oven/broiler, they better be able to do that, because from my calculations.. you can time just about any temp you want on a measured cut of beef with a high and even oven temp. The petit filet was melt in your mouth good. I enjoy a good wood grill flavor on my steaks, but I did not miss it here and the beef flavors were pristinely distilled due to the searing temps and lack of other flavoring agents.\n\nVeal Chop - Medium rare... I'm not gonna lie even though I am a die hard Mid Rare gal, I shoulda gone a little more well done. It came out the proper temperature and looked at me divinely all glistening with it's buttery garlic and parsley topping..mmmm. It was tasty, the veal was delicious and tender.\n\nThe Porterhouse - the ultimate man steak.. It was, as the man at the table described it \"the best steak all year,\" now granted it's only February.. but he did love it.\n\nLobster Mac and Cheese - What say you? Lobster in the mac?! Yes, indeedily! It was described as the best mac and cheese and only second to Angeline's in Berkeley (coming from a harsh 16 year old palate).. but with the addition of lobster, and flavors of jalepeno.. in my opinion, this mac and cheese can't be beat.\n\nDessert was a spectacle and I dare not describe the foolish flingings of forks at the table, lest I insult your civility.\n\nI would further describe the meal.. but you would think me a lush and glutton, to which I admit nothing..", "author": "Sara F."}

I've dined at many other Ruth's Chris locations and was really looking forward to making this location a regular as we recently moved to the city but I was left feeling very disappointed. \n\nMy husband has a dairy intolerance and allergy and we notified our server of this before ordering. He was very accommodating and said he'd notify the kitchen staff. \n\nWe ordered the crab stack appetizer which was nice.\n\nWe then ordered a filet and the lamb chops which were excellent and matched what we expect from Ruth's Chris. We also ordered a side of fries. The fries tasted weird. Like old oil mixed with burnt onion. I notified the waiter and he quickly replaced the fries. The new fries tasted exactly the same. I brought this to his attention and he said there's not much else they can do and they'll remove this item from our check. Which they did. \n\nThe disappointing part comes in when we got home. My husband was terribly sick as soon as we got home. He knew that it was a dairy reaction. I immediately called the restaurant and spoke to the manager on duty. I explained the situation and he was very understanding as he too suffers from a dairy allergy and he could relate to what I was explaining.

However, I do believe that once in a while, people have to treat themselves, so when my parents told me that they wanted to eat at Ruth's Chris for their anniversary dinner, I had no choice but to go along. I made a reservation for 5 on a Monday night at 8:30pm through open table and lucky for us, the Dine About Town promotion was going on.\n\nThe valet staff gets pretty busy around dinner time, so be very patient! It helps to have your payment ready ($10) so you can save yourself from going through your purse/wallet. We were promptly seated and our server, Nicolas, informed us about the whole process about how they cook their steaks etc and seemed to know a lot about the menu. He brought us the requested Dine About Town menus, but also informed us that there was an section on their regular menu that gave us more options to choose from. My sisters and I ordered off of the Dine About Town menu while my parents ordered off of the regular menu. The Dine About Town menu comes with a house salad, a choice of either the Petit Filet, Fish, or Shrimp, a side dish, and a dessert. The dinner that my mom and dad chose came with a choice of salad, a choice of 2 entrees, a side dish, and 3 desserts.\n\nPetit Filet with Mashed Potatoes - Served on a 500 degree plate to ensure that the customer enjoys every bite hot, my Medium Well Petit Filet was seasoned with just salt and pepper and placed on a plate that was lightly coated with butter. The steak was divine and so delicious. It was definitely one of the best steaks I've had. The mashed potatoes, however, were very watery and tasted very bland. I'd skip on the potatoes and order the creamed spinach, as mentioned and suggested by other reviewers.\n\nChocolate dessert - Good, but definitely something you can get at a local bake shop.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a great 2 hour experience and the service was great. I was a little bit disappointed with the Dine About Town options, but I do recommend paying the extra $10 to get more options from the regular menu!", "author": "Joyce E."}

We just found street parking around the corner.\n\nBoyfriend and I made a reservation at 8 PM on a Tuesday and we waited for 15 minutes.

Great suggestion, but what a sneaky way of converting to the regular menu Ruth!\n\nTim explained to us that the steak here is the second best steak in the nation (don't quote me on that) and he went on about how great this prime steak is.

They do serve your steak on a 500 degree plate, so my steak might have cooked on it a little. I don't know. All I know is that it definitely wasn't medium.

In San Diego, Ruth Chris is considered a high end, amazing service, best-bet-for-a-fancy-night-out, mouthwatering meal but this place was no where close. First of all everything was super casual which is fine, that's not the restaurants fault...kinda. It was very dim and slightly crowded between all the tables that were crammed in. We had reservations for 9:00pm because everything else was booked, ok fine. But we get there and we sit around for 40 minutes waiting! (-1 star) What was the point of a reservation? Not quite sure. At this point we were all starved since we hadn't eaten since lunch around 2:30. We're finally seated and the waitress tells us not to feel \"rushed or anything but the kitchen closed 30 minutes ago\"....Ok...how is this my problem if your restaurant took us 40 minutes late? Second, if they close at 9, then why take reservations at 9? It was complete bologna. Anyways, we get the bread and butter first which was alright, not bad not the best either. We decided to order the Thanksgiving meal since it was Thanksgiving and I completely regret it. This meal came with an started (salad or soup), main course (turnkey, stuffing, some kind of sauce on top, cranberry sauce, and a choice of yams, mashed potatoes, and cream of spinach) and finally a dessert (pumpkin cheese cake and ice cream). The soup, according to my parents was good but the steak salad my and my sister got was just a bunch of rotting green leaves. Next, we got our main course. First of all, the all of our meals were cold. The only thing that was actually warm/hot was the middle of the stuffing mountain and the bottom of the casseroles. Honestly the entire meal was super basic for it to be in Ruth Chris. I can't even tell you how to fix it. The stuffing was boring, the turkey and sauce was boring, and the cranberry sauce tasted like it came from a can. The cream of spinach I got was ok, needed salt. Mashed potatoes were basic. The yam casserole was so sweet it could pass for dessert. (-2 stars) Finally dessert. Pumpkin cheese cake and ice cream? Couldn't we stick with traditional pumpkin pie and ice cream? The waitress was nice enough to just give me two scoops of chocolate ice cream and my parents tried the cheese cake, ditched it, and went for the ice cream. (+1 star)\n\nOn the plus side!

Nick was our server and he was personable but not to the point where you can tell its fake.  He did an excellent job.  The chef I think overcooked our first steaks, but my wife and I were having such an enjoyable evening on our anniversary weekend we didn't care.  Nick brought out a comp tuna ahi though while we waited which we didnt even need or request.  The manager also came over and talked with us, you can tell they want everyones experience there to be great.  \n\nMy advice is to order the specials they offer, usually about $52.95 and you get 3 courses including a side dish with your entree.\n\nMy wife really enjoyed the cheesecake they brought us for dessert.", "author": "Ryan A."}

It would be nice if they would state and enforce a dress code.  This isn't Outback Steakhouse or Benihana's.  20-somethings should not be seated in hoodies, sneakers, and the like. Most patrons were dressed in accordance with the ambience, but several weren't, including some who are old enough to know better.\n\nI realize it's San Francisco and not New York or Boston, but some of you diners out there need to step it up. Don't show up here dressed for Applebee's or Lark Creek.\n\nThe food was exceptional. We shared the mashed potatoes (superb!) and the creamed spinach between us. My steak (surf and turf of a sort--two huge shrimps curled up on top) was perfectly cooked to medium rare. Perfectly.  The beef was tender from first bite to last--no dry spots. The apple walnut bleu cheese salad appetizer was also delicious, and that autumn spiced cider or whatever it was, was splendid. Had it been served hot, it would have been heavenly.  \n\nMy friend had ordered her steak well-done, and it became a little too pink for her about halfway through. Our waiter graciously offered to have it cooked further, and discreetly whisked the plate away, and returned it 15 minutes or so later.\n\nThe pumpkin cheesecake with ice cream was okay, but not memorable. Perhaps dessert is not their strong suit.\n\nAll in all, I'd place Ruth's Chris above Prime Rib (also very good, but not exceptional!)\n\nThe staff is wonderful, from the host who seated us to the (different) host we passed on our way out.

The bread was nicely toasted so we scarfed everything down in a nano second so I kindly asked our server if we could have more. Two reminders later and still no sight of the bread refills.  Of course she was super friendly with the table next to us and even comped them an appetizer while she chatted away with them and totally neglecting us.  We gave up since our entrees arrived 30 minutes later.  The food was fine.  \n\nWhat I was displeased with is the fact that the server was either lacking in knowledge or trying to be shady when we were trying to order desserts.  She told us there is a $3.00 upgrade if we didn't like the cheesecake so we did the upgrade for the 2 desserts out of the 3 as we ordered the Ruth Chris Special. When the bill came, it was $4.00 for the upgrade and she charged for 3 upgrades when one of the dessert was the set cheesecake but she claimed it was a different cheesecake??  When I asked her on it, she said \"oh\" I guess it is $4.00 and not $3.00 for the dessert upgrade. Are you serious?  Not only did you tell me a different price and even charged me an extra $4.00 upgrade for something we didn't asked for with no shame and walked away.  Wow!\n\nMind you our bill was $340 for 4 adults and one child with 4 drinks so it is not a cheap dinner and I am not a penny pincher!   I even gave her an 18% tip despite that.\n\nI appreciate spending my hard earned $$$ at places that value their customers and not trying to cheat me a few $$ just to up her tab. \n\nManagement, you need to train your servers better!\n\nSorry, not a fan!!!

I don't normally eat shrimp because I only like to eat REALLY GOOD shrimp that's already peeled. Very hard to find. And they have really good shrimp! The filet was good too (although may be more on the medium than rare side), but I couldn't eat much of it because it was just SO fatty! With the butter and the fat already in the meat, it was too much for me. I would need to be in Pre-Hybernation-Bear-Mode. Wait, bears don't eat steaks?

This came with a scoop of ice cream and candle for me. Meh. Couldn't finish it.\n\nThe bf ordered some chilled crab soup which tasted like salsa.

And note that even though the Cowboy bone-in ribeye is 22 oz or whatever and is supposed to be huge, it's actually not that huge...maybe the bone counts as part of the weight.

BOOOOO!!!\n\nAlthough I'm not very keen on chain restaurants, Ruth Chris has been on my list of to-gos for the past ummm, 5+ years. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of DAT either because the items I would normally order (i.e. Foie Gras, Filet, Lamb Chops) are rarely on the menu and you're normally just getting a free soup/salad OR dessert which is not a spectacular deal. If I'm going to have a nice dinner, I rather pay for specific items I want on the menu. However, my friend suggested we try RC during DAT since it was both on our list and it seemed like a good deal. Since the filet was already $35, you're getting a free salad, side AND dessert!\n\nOn Sunday, January 30th, my friend promptly arrived for our 5:30 PM reservation. I, on the other hand, was late trying to find parking but they were able to be seated first. \n\nF O O D:\nI'm currently on the HCG 500-calorie limited diet, so in addition to ordering the DAT menu ($35) I ordered a side of steamed veggies since substitutions were obviously not allowed.\n\n*STEAKHOUSE SALAD: OK. \n\nAn array of lettuce with one cherry tomato (halved), thinly sliced red onions, croutons topped with balsamic vinaigrette. Leave it up to me to forget to tell the waiter to hold the croutons and to put the dressing on the side. :X The veggies were fresh and crisp, but the balsamic vinaigrette was too oily for my taste and lacked a sweet tang. \n\n*8 OZ. FILET MIGNON: OK, BUT OVERCOOKED.\n\nRC cooks their steaks at 1,800 degrees and serves it on a 500 degree sizzling platter with an ounce of butter. A restaurant that specializes in something should be able to prepare those dishes flawlessly. I think there was a timing issue and our steaks were probably sitting on the sizzling platter too long which resulted in all of our steaks being overcooked. \n\nI had requested my steak medium-rare, but it was medium-well to well-done as there was only a very small hint of pink in the center. See pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Kxwc8PIKy2JsegNwgBjAtA?select=V_85uja94fEA1g4sdjv72Q \n\nThe filet was somewhat tender but a bit chewy, and definitely lacked the buttery and juiciness that a rarer steak would have. The filet was well-seasoned though considering I ordered it without butter. \n\n*CREAMED SPINACH: I didn't try it and took it home to give away, but my friend said it was good. \n \n*FRESH ASPARAGUS ($10): MEH!\n\nI ordered the asparagus sans the hollandaise sauce in addition to the DAT menu since I couldn't eat the creamed spinach or mash potatoes. \n\nThe steamed asparagus was overcooked, which was evident by the dull green color and limpness. It wasn't seasoned at all and completely tasteless which may be because I told our waiter I was on a strict diet? Regardless of this, \"healthy\" food shouldn't mean boring and bland food. \n\n*DESSERT: SYMPHONY DUO - PETITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE & YOGURT WITH BERRIES\n\nAgain, I didn't try it and took it home. However, my friend said the mousse was too rich and if it weren't for the accompanying yogurt, the dessert would have been overwhelmingly sweet. \n\nS E R V I C E:\nEXCELLENT! Our waiter was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Our order was promptly taken, our food was brought out in a timely fashion, our water glasses were always refilled and we were checked on several times.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R:\nClassy and simplistic, but dated with little personality; wooden interior and fixtures, clean and crisp white linen draped tables and dim lighting. \n\nDespite it being busy, it was easy to maintain a conversation which makes it a good place for a date or an \"occasion\" dinner.\n\nP A R K I N G:\nSituated near the residential area of Pac Heights, finding nearby parking is difficult on the weekends. Valet parking is available for $10. \n\nOverall, I doubt I would return to RC. I know my dietary restrictions made it difficult to judge RC in its entirety but as an upscale \"steakhouse\" it's hard to justify serving an overcooked steak and borderline mushy asparagus. The issue may have been timing/sizzling platters, however, after being in the business for over 45 years, a restaurant of this caliber should be able to operate like a fine oiled machine.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

They asked if we were celebrating any special events and told them it was our anniversary.We arrived there early and checked in at the front counter. We were seated within 5 min in the back room. Kind of cozy but was crowded as they were seating all their customers in the back room even though the front was almost empty.\n\nTo our surprise, we were seated at a table with Rose pedals on the tables. (I guess this is their way of knowing who is celebrating what). Then, we were introduced to Nicholas, our server. He was funny and patience. He explained the menu thoroughly, and we decided to go with \n\nAppetizers: Calamari, Seared Ahi Tuna, and Spicy Lobster. \nEntree: Ribeye (Well done) and Filet \nDesert: Key Lime Pie\n\nLets talk about \n\nCalamari .. Both wife and I love Calamari. No matter where we go, we order Calamari (If available) 90% of the time. We though Ok .. just another Calamari. We were proven wrong. The Calamari that Ruth Chris offers is not just a plain jane (and who came up with the term plain jane anyway) calamari like other restaurants offer. It was sweat, and semi spicy and very delicious. (Towards the end, it was getting sweeter and sweeter that we had to down it with water).\n\nSeared Ahi Tuna .. Wow .. Nice and fresh. This is one of the best and fresh Tuna I had. I am not too much of a Fish fan, so only ate a few and was good. Only issue was that wasabi sauce (Which I do not like)  were all over the Tuna.\n\nSpicy Lobster Tail .. Must have .. Especially with the cucumber salad. It is fried with mild Habanero sauce mixed with sweet substance ( I am very sure the chef wold not want me to know what he is using). I was in Food Heaven at this time. I don't remember sharing the lobsters as I was too busy enjoying it.\n\nRibeye .. Just make sure to order lightly butter as they use butter to cook the meat. I am glad that someone from here put that as a tip and made sure my waiter, Nicholas, wrote down lightly butter on both Ribeye and filet. In my opinion, it was perfectly cooked (for me). Some what charred out side but juicy inside. Only complain was that the Rubeye we got came with 50% fat and 50% meat. \n\nFilet .. What can go wrong with eating great Filet. Tender yet juicy. When ever you cut, juices were flowing. WOW .. WOW .. WOW ..\n\nKey Lime Pie .. Awesome. Very tangy and it over power some of the sweetness. \n\nExperience\n\n5 STARS for Nicholas who was very attentive, and very accommodating. \n\n4 STARS for seating many many customers in a small room where we felt people were listening in on other's conversations, and lost touch of the \"Special Event\" feeling. In this may be 800 square foot room, I counted at least 20 people.\n\n4 STARS for Food .. Seared Ahi Tuna with plenty of Wasabi Sauce all over around the Tuna, and 50% fat on Ribeye .\n\nOverall Experience: 4 Stars", "author": "Bruce L."}

Especially when you get all dressed up to go out to a nice dinner, prepared for spending a little money to get the quality of a fine steakhouse, not Hungry Hunter.\n\nThe quality should be consistent, but it doesn't always work out that way. We ordered from the Dine about Town menu, I ordered the Filet Mignon, which was a perfect size 6 oz. I ordered it Rare and it cooked on my plate.\n\nHe ordered the 12 oz. Rib Eye, which was fatty and had strings of tendon through making it difficult to cut. We should have really sent the steak back, because it was almost 1/4 of the steak. \n\nWe mentioned this to our waiter and he didn't do anything about it. It was pretty disappointing and I felt awful for recommending that we go there. I really wanted to impress for the price you pay to come here.\n\nThis used to be my favorite steakhouse, but it has lost it for me. I'm really sad to have to say it - but we are over. :'(", "author": "Rebekah T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-02", "description": "Dine About Town review!\n\nTo celebrate my girl's birthday, we pursued her favorite food: steak. I made reservations two weeks in advance for 2 at 8:15 on a Saturday evening. We arrived at 7:45 and were seated promptly because this restaurant is huge!\n\nOur waitress Lena presented us with the $36.95 prix fixe DAT menu. The dinner includes a Steak House Salad, your choice of a steak, chicken, or shrimp entree (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q_W-4PSEnotoIsbhCeKepw/l.jpg), a side of either Creamed Spinach or Mashed Potatoes, and the Chef's Daily Selection dessert. Lena also pointed out the regular prix fixe called \"Ruth's Classics,\" which is $42.95 and offers more choices of course options.\n\nThe complimentary bread was brought out bundled in a napkin--I cannot describe the beauty that is warm, soft bread, even if it's plain white bread. The accompanying pat of light, fluffy butter did its duty in clogging up my arteries. Another loaf was brought out to tide us over from appetizer to entree, which meant I ended up eating two entire loaves myself (thanks Nance). I'm appreciative that I didn't have to ask for a bread refill though :') Service is fast and prompt with water refills and plate clearing.\n\nAfter we selected our DAT entrees, our STEAK HOUSE SALAD came out super fast (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PuPa7ULeIej_mh6pAGrYgg/l.jpg). It's a tasty but unmemorable plate of iceberg, romaine, and baby lettuces with cherry tomatoes, garlic croutons and red onions, served with balsamic vinaigrette.\n\nWe both ordered the 6 OZ. PETIT FILET of corn-fed Midwestern beef, which was just the right size for the both of us! She ordered hers medium (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FbJB4IJMmSAnBvJLNlwUKQ/l.jpg). When she cut into her steak, there were a few red parts. However, the steaks are served on hot plates, so she just let it sit on her plate so that the red became pink and the pink became brown. I, on the other hand, got a nice chunk of medium-rare. The middle was so red, it was breathtaking (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M-nVkQr1aRvUgktkEIVvEA/l.jpg). Perhaps it's better called medium-rare-rare? In any case, the filet was moist, tender, and chewy. It didn't melt, but it came pretty darn close. And yes, the steaks are served in a pool of butter, but both of us LOVED it. Paired with the seasoning (salt, pepper, parsley, and probably crack), the butter lent a rich, savory flavor to the filet mignon. This may sound gross, but I was literally mopping up the butter with pieces of steak. That being said, if you are on a low-butter diet, don't come here. And if you like touching plates that your steak is served on, I wouldn't come here either :/ \n\nBoth of us chose the CREAMED SPINACH (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bfcPtpvryhKo_5pCSaAFgg/l.jpg). I've never had creamed spinach before, and the creaminess of it took me aback. I could barely taste the usual bitterness of the spinach, and the texture was so mushy you could have mistaken it for baby food. Their reserved use of salt was appreciated as well. I was curious about the recipe, and I was surprised to find that they use whole milk in place of cream! (http://www.food.com/recipe/ruths-chris-steak-house-creamed-spinach-31045) But they definitely were generous with that butter ;)\n\nOur dessert was the Chef's Daily Selection, and the chef did not make a good selection...a chocolate cake with vanilla cream, a raspberry, and plated raspberry sauce (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gOT9d0ankvsbTFOODqviJA/l.jpg). The cake was moist, the chocolate flavor light, the vanilla cream not too overpowering. It was okay, but I could have gotten it at Safeway.\n\nOh, and if you let it be known while making your reservation that you're celebrating someone's birthday, they decorate your table with \"Happy Birthday\" confetti and bring out a complimentary 3-scoop sorbet dessert, complete with a candle, at the end of your meal. Unfortunately, I didn't think to do that for my girl :( But the table next to us served as my evidence haha.\n\nAll in all, it was a hearty meal in a great setting (think 1980s ambiance, with jazz playing in the background). I prefer DAT lunches over DAT dinners because I like picking my own desserts, and they're priced better. But I enjoyed my first experience at the Ruth Chris chain, and their steak is superb. Happy birthday Nance!\n\nUPDATE: Looking at Ruth's Chris versus House of Prime Rib, each is marvelous in its own rights. Ruth's Chris focuses more on the butter seasoning of the steak, whereas HPR showcases the steak itself. Ruth's Chris has creamier creamed spinach, whereas HPR distinguishes their house salad with beets and egg dressing. Also, HPR includes cornbread and Yorkshire pudding with your meal. The ambiance in HPR is homey and cozy, whereas Ruth's Chris is classier and dimmer.", "author": "Adele F."}

I was biased this whole time because the RC in HK tastes like shit (what do Asians know about steak, right?), yet SF RC dismissed all biases.\n\nI ordered the ribeye rare. It was sizzling on the plate and flavorful. What I especially like about this dish was the hot place. If I find my steak too rare or the fatty parts too \"stringy,\" I can just sear the meat myself on the hot plate... and that is just awesome :D\n\nTheir banana cream pie with carmelized scalloped bananas were slightly on the sweet side.... but SO DELICIOUS....

We arrived prior to our scheduled reservation time, and the hostess had no issues with seating us early.  Upon arriving at our table, we immediately noticed that the staff had placed multiple small \"Happy Anniversary\" banners to welcome us.  Nice touch!  Our server Trevor was an absolute gentleman!  He was extremely attentive and graciously answered all of our questions.  Ruth's Chris offers 2 \"Classic\" tiered meal options that include a starter, entr\u00e9e, 1 side dish and a dessert.  We went with the second (more expensive) option and chose both filet mignon and ribeye steaks.  Both were absolutely delicious!  My corn chowder starter was also amazing.  To top it off, the kitchen staff also wrote \"Happy Anniversary\" on my desert plate.  Unbelievable attention to detail - we were impressed!\n\nI brought in a mailed advertisement stating a special price of $43.95 for the aforementioned Classic meal option.  This document did not specify which Classic tier was included, so I assumed both.  I explained this to Trevor, and a manager named Tom came over to discuss further.  Tom did the right thing and honored the written offer price for our meal.  I would encourage the Ruth's Chris corporate office to improve the clarity of their mailings and specifically state any exclusions in writing going forward.\n\nGreat job Ruth's Chris team!!!", "author": "Jon W."}

If only we could have Colin at every restaurant; life would be exponentially better! I hope the top dogs at Ruth's Chris read this and give that guy a high five (or a cruise) for being awesome!\n\nThe Filet was perfect and Colin even brought extra butter on our plate. (A very nice touch!) The chop salad is a MUST, and they even picked out the black and blue berries from our berries and cream. I think it was quite possibly the best meal ever...\n\nAs a reference, I came in in a T-Shirt and sneakers...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-16", "description": "Let me say that my favorite steak houses are Harris' and A-5 in SF and Peter Lugers in Brooklyn.  Only went to Ruth's Chris (RC) because my GF's daughter & son-in-law gave us a gift card for Xmas to eat there.  Didn't have a preconceived notion of what RC would be like but didn't have high expectations.  Turns out my lowered expectations were met.\n\nSince we had a gift card for a good amount of money and since I was paying for any extras, I decided to treat it like a splurge.  Ordered a Blue Sapphire Martini (which was very good) and a bottle of Stags Leap cab (which was about 2x retail) that the gift card barely covered.  Wanted the wine to \"breathe\" a little and asked for a decanter.  The waiter could not find a large decanter, so he brought us 2 small ones.  A minor quibble.\n\nI ordered a NY Strip steak.  It didn't seem that large. Forget what the advertised weight was but it was probably around 12 oz.  My GF ordered the filet mignon (6oz) and lobster tail (2 of them) combo. I also ordered the lobster mac & cheese to share.\n\n I like my steaks rare and, in my experience, very few restaurants actually believe that you want a truly RARE steak or are simply incapable of cooking a steak rare.  Rare in the trade means COLD in the middle. RC was no exception to my experience in this regard.  \n\nThe steak was less than 1\" thick (probably around 3/4\"), which is difficult to grill rare to begin with, and was on a sizzling hot platter, which makes for a good presentation but continues to cook the steak.  So, that if you order rare, what you get is medium rare instead.  \n\nI made a point of telling that waiter that I indeed wanted a truly RARE steak and he promised that it would be so.  However, it was NOT.  What I got was a very tasty medium rare steak but it was NOT rare.  I decided not to make a fuss about it and just ate it because it did taste good but I mentioned the \"problem\" to the waiter, who initially tried to blow it off but later informed us that we'd get a free desert on the house because of it.\n\nMy GF likes her steaks medium and she was not disappointed.  I didn't taste her steak but I did try some of the lobster tail which seemed overcooked and a little rubbery to me.  Ok but not great.  The lobster mac & cheese was ok when it was hot but as it cooled it started to congeal and was difficult for me to digest.  So, I didn't eat much of it.  \n\nFor our \"free\" desert, we ordered the Key Lime pie which the waiter highly   recommended.  The pie was pretty large but it was very thick and gummy (too much gelatin)  -- not light and fluffy as it should be -- and lacked key lime flavor.  I was glad we didn't have to pay for it.  The restaurant wasn't busy, so we spent a couple hours chatting and drinking the wine until it was all gone.  The servers just left us alone which was good of them.\n\nSo, overall, I think RC is just ok.  The food was so-so and the service was acceptable.  As mentioned previously, if you're looking for a good steak in SF, I think you can do better than RC but, if you've got a gift card to eat there, I think you'll be happy enough with your eating experience there as long as you don't set your sights too high.", "author": "Martin C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-22", "description": "Been wanting to try this place for about 3 years now and I finally had the opportunity. The Dine About Town (DAT) menu consisted of: Steak House Salad, choice of 3 protein choices, and the Duo Symphony dessert for $34.95. The DAT menu is not that much different from their usual Prix Fixe menu which has a similar set-up but a little more variety for $39.95. I just stuck to the DAT menu since I only wanted Steak and could care-less about the other things. \n\nI upgraded to the 16 fl oz Angus Beef Ribeye for $10, which was probably the best decision I made that day (other than going to Ruth's Chris of course). The waitress always tells you that the plates are served at 500 degrees and that's how the steak stays warm the entire meal. Regardless if true or not, the steak was heaven. I enjoyed every single bite and was sad to fine myself done. I could probably have eaten another 8 fl oz but that may because I extend my stomach when I'm eating good meat. The mashed potatoes were decent. The Duo Symphony Dessert was a petite custard with mixed berries and chocolate mousse in a chocolate shell. The dessert was a good way to end the dinner.\n\nOverall i would come back for a special occasion or if I was craving steak and willing to make the dent in my bank account. This isn't necessary a \"romantic\" restaurant as it isn't candle-lit. There was a family and just a group of friends hanging out. Just make sure you keep it classy if you decide to drink. There is no need to scream and shout to have the manager come have a drink with you. This ain't no bar; go to the bar outside and let me eat my steak in peace.", "author": "Kathy W."}

Our steak tasted like leather, like maybe it was thawed and cooked. I was a little embarassed and didn't want to make a stink about it there. We had the white chocolate bread pudding for desert, and it tasted like paste. My friend also ordered it and he couldn't eat but about 1/4 of it. I just paid the bill and decided to call them today and let the manager know what happened. I spoke with exavior, who sounded polite, but didn't seem to care about the call.

The petit fillet was seriously the softest steak i have ever had and the rib eye was also very tender and both seasoned very well. \n\nSides: we had the steak fries and mashed potatoes (nothing special) so overall very average sides but the portions were larger than expected and each side order is definitely enough to serve two. \n\nAppetizer: we ordered the crab cakes which came out on a sizzling plate, two pieces per order and fairly large. plenty of crab and pretty good. \n\nService: decent, had both a server and server's assistant help us out. We overheard the server give the 30second steak 'pitch' to selective tables (ie. how the steak is prepared, served, etc) but didnt give it to us, it would've been a nice touch since it was our first time at the restaurant. There were brief moments where we were waiting on our server but nothing too extraordinary. Also forgot to give us our bagged leftovers when we were having desert and paying the bill, we had to come back for it. \n\noverall, it's a steak house and i enjoyed the steak... i guess that's the important part.", "author": "michelle l."}

A normal entree alone is already around $55. \n\nI got an apple kale salad and it was SO refreshing. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was very refreshing... My 12 oz ribeye really wasn't all that amazing. I got it medium rare and it came closer to rare but slowly cooked on my super hot plate... that was pretty cool. Three of us got the 12 oz ribeye and each slice looked different: smaller, thicker, fattier, flatter, etc. It really wasn't consistent. A friend who got the 12 oz too had a really nice cut. It had a good proportion of fat to meat. Mine was less fattier. i think because of this, as I slowly worked away at it the texture started getting worse and worse. My first bite was: melt in your mouth because I started where the fat was. The fiance got filet mignon and he really liked it. It was a very big cut too. We were all a little surprised it rivaled our 12 oz ribeye in size. The creamed spinach was really good. Our friend said the mashed potatoes were good too, but I didn't try it. The espresso torte was really strong and heavy. (Server told us for $4 more we could pick another dessert on their menu.)\n\nOur server Thomas was amazing and super friendly. The woman helping him was another case though... She skipped filling my cup because the person across from me said no thank you, even though I clearly wanted water. My fiance kind of stared/glared at her as she made her round around the room and she even made eye contact with him. Eventually when she came back to fill our waters again, it felt like she deliberately skipped him. Mind you, both times the cups were half empty. \n\nThis place is definitely a good alternative to to House of Prime Rib if you're looking for a place more low key and less snooty on Van Ness. There's no prime rib here though... which made me sad but at least I didn't feel like our server was judging us. \n\nOur booth was super cramped.

It also comes with an appetizer (I chose some sort of salad with pecans in it), a side dish (Brussel Sprouts Roasted w/ Bacon), and a dessert dish (paid $4 extra to get a Banana Liquer filled Pie Crust and we also asked for a scoop of vanilla ice cream to pair with the pie).  \n\nWe also ordered a Spicy Lobster and Veal Ravioli as our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered a Cowboy Steak and both potato sides.  I can't speak so much for his steak although it was massive looking, but everything I ate (which was mostly seafood) tasted AMAZING!\n\nThere are 3 things I'd definitely go back for:\n- Spicy Lobster Appetizer (had just the right amount of spice and tanginess to it)\n- Chilean Sea Bass w/ Lumps of Crab (the chunk of fish itself seemed like a giant lump of crab because of the way it peeled when I used my fork)\n- Brussel Sprouts roasted w/ Bacon (probably the best roasted veggies I've ever had)\n\nThe service there, of course...was also amazing.\n\nMy mouth is watering just talking about those 3 dishes.\n\nI didn't order any wine here because every glass seemed over-priced for what it was.

My steak wasn't as good as it was the first time mainly because I wanted to try their chef special/suggestion, which was the bone-in filet, but I was better off with the ribeye. That's what I had the first time and thought it was very juicy and delicious out of all the steakhouses I've tried (i.e. Alexander's, Gary Danko's, Harris, and Bobo's). And my friend had ordered the ribeye this recent time so I got to try a little bit of his and wish I had that instead of the bone in filet. So that's the only reason why I took away one star, wasn't as pleased with my food as the first time around. However, for dessert I definitely loved their cheesecake.\n\n  As for service; I do want to admit and compliment that my service was excellent! 5/5 stars! My server was Clark and he informed of us the daily specials and checked up on us occasionally. I regret not tipping higher than I should of (gave roughly 18%, but should've gave at least 20-25% tip), but I had to prioritize my funds.

Service wasn't appallingly bad by any means, but the staff was not what I'd call gracious. We also were forced to wait around 5 minutes to be seated, despite the fact that there were empty tables everywhere. I would chalk this up to being a one-time thing, if not for all the other reviews making this same observation.\n\nOne of the first warning signs that this meal would not be good-value was the very sub-par complimentary bread. I mean, this tasted like sweet and soft supermarket dough you buy off the shelves. None of that rustic goodness you'd find at most other San Francisco establishments.\n\nBut whatever. I didn't want to fill up on bread anyway, right? And I was super excited to discover that we could add a BLUE CHEESE CRUST on our steaks for an additional $4.\n\nI was considering the Petite Filet, but went for the Filet since it was just $6 more for a much larger portion (bringing it to a total of $46 + $4 for the cheese crust). Sucky thing is you have to order the sides a la carte. I really wanted to try the lobster mac & cheese but opted for the creamed spinach instead.\n\nThe creamed spinach is good, though I personally prefer the one at House of Prime Rib. \n\nI will concede that the steak is really, really good. It's USDA Prime served on a 500 degree plate, so that the meat is still cooking as you eat it. (But that means you must eat with caution -- do not under any circumstances touch the plate!) If you're a fan of blue cheese, the crust is also phenomenal.\n\nAs for dessert -- even if you think you have no stomach room left, get the creme brulee. It's quite creamy and delicious, and not overly sweet.\n\nSo all in all, I have mixed feelings on the place. Good meat, mediocre everything else.

The calamari was tossed in a sweet chili sauce, which tasted very good...However, made the calamari really soggy.

You will not regret it.\n\nThe $34.95 prix fix DAT menu includes: a Steak House Salad, an 8oz Petite Filet, a side of either Creamed Spinach or Mashed Potatoes, and dessert. In case you don't understand how great a deal this it, let me break it down for you: On a normal day/menu the salad would cost $7.50, the steak would cost $36, the side would cost $9, and the dessert would cost...I dunno, how about $8 (I made up the dessert cost since I don't actually know). Overall, you get a $60 meal for $35. That's Groupon-status right there. And, if Petite Filets aren't your thing, you can upgrade to a 16oz Rib-Eye for $15 dollars. According to the menu, the regular ribeye cost is only $9 more than petite filets,  but even so, overall the meal is still much cheaper than it would be otherwise.\n\nHowever, a good deal is only worth it if the food is good, so how was the food? Absolutely EXCELLENT. My petite filet was full of flavor, perfectly cooked, and just overall delicious. My date upgraded to the Rib-Eye and was really happy he did. It was insanely buttery and delicious. The creamed spinach was pretty unremarkable, but who goes to a steak house for spinach anyways? For dessert they served a little chocolate cake topped with a raspberry reduction and some other sugary goodness. We both devoured ours extremely quickly, if that gives any indication of how good it was.\n\nWe also chose a bottle of $40 Italian wine that our waitress helped us choose. She was extremely helpful and patience, I was very impressed at how much of her time and knowledge she bestowed upon us.  \n\nDefinitely put this place top on your list of restaurants for Dine About Town and make a reservations early!", "author": "Talia G."}

We ordered off of their Ruth's Classics menu (3-course meal) and boy was it worth it in every way. We each got a 16oz rib eye (SO BIG!), she got the creamed spinach, I got the mashed potatoes and for our soup we had the corn chowder. \n\nThe chowder was good, real subtle, and although there was supposed to be bacon sprinkled on top there was almost no bacon flavor, sad. The bread was good too, and the butter was soft enough to spread, but we're not here for bread...\n\nThe steaks come out and I ordered mine med-rare and it was PERFECT, she got hers med well and it was...med well...(sacrilege!). They say the plates are 500 degrees! How do they just hold it with a napkin? I didn't touch it with my hands but I had to position it using my forks because of how it was placed in front of me...then I stuck my forks in the two bread rolls and did a little dance on the table with 'em (what movie is that from? jk didn't do that).\n\nThe steak was fantastic and worth it in my opinion. It was seasoned only with salt and pepper; the only true way to eat a steak. The juices and flavor were phenomenal. Her steak was...med well hahah...but it was ok. I prefer my steak to moo a little when I cut it.\n\nSo then we also had our spinach and mashed potatoes. The spinach needed salt and the mashed needed pepper, and the two eaten together were amazing! All in all, they're sides, nothing too fancy, but I found them pretty yum-tastic.\n\nSo then, because it was OUR birthday (mine is a week after hers but we were there on hers) they let us get desserts of our choice. She got the creme brulee and I the Super Chocolate explosion cake of dooooooooooom. My cake rocked  the party and her creme was not what we were expecting in terms of previous bru-hahas we've had before and so my cake won which meant she ate a lot of it.

This is either wonderful if you want the same experience you've always had, or dreary and hackneyed if you were expecting a bright fresh menu. Time moves on, and truly wonderful meats are now available at a number of restaurants that source local grass-fed beef, and that use the whole animal in fresh and inventive ways. Still, sometimes you just want that greasy old burger you had as a kid, so I approached RC as if I were visiting it for the first time with today's SF palette.\n\nFrom that perspective, it's pretty poor. The lobster bisque was nothing of the sort, it was just a roux-based cream soup with lobster stock, and the corn chowder had TONS of sugar and salt in it, almost inedible. My steak was quite undercooked, (seared when I ordered M-R), and it was still raw on the inside. To be fair, if I'd read the done-ness levels carefully I would've noticed that M-R said \"warm pink center\", which means uncooked in R's C's parlance. Personally I think \"warm pink center\" means that the muscle fibers have started to form, and are not the gelatinous blob of raw meat. I'd stick to the tried and true descriptions and call M-R a 125\u00b0F pull, and then fine-tune from there.\n\nWe had traditional potatoes au gratin (way too salty) and creamed spinach (way too salty). Did I mention how salty everything is?\n\nAnd then there was the clientele, which has changed over the years. Let's leave it at we felt like we were in a rap video. Apparently a patron was arrested there awhile back, the cops got a tip he was dining there and swarmed in. Lovely, and enough said on that topic.\n\nIf I were looking for that traditional salty undercooked meal, then RC delivers in spades, but I feel my tastes have moved on and there are better steak dining alternatives, Alexander's for example.\n\nYMMV", "author": "Rob C."}

Doesn't Jackie Kennedy wear the nicest dresses? I have to admit that Ruth's Chris Steak House was not my first choice for Dine Around Town this year, but I was so late in making up my mind that it ended up being pretty much the only choice left on Open Table if I didn't want to eat close to midnight. Well, when I perused their menu, I thought I went into the Time Tunnel and landed somewhere in the early 1960's. Creamed Spinach? Potatoes Lyonnaise? Gee, I felt like I was in that episode of \"Leave It to Beaver\" where Beaver stuffed the Brussels sprouts in his pocket. \n\nThe entryway was packed with so many drooling meat-eaters that I was surprised the prim hostess was not holding up a chair to back us off. When Jamie W. and I were finally seated, we were pleased to get a roomy booth and a solicitous waiter who didn't get on our nerves. It honestly felt like a restaurant that my dad would have taken us to if we were really good. I would 've been six-years old and wearing a suit jacket, a red bow-tie, and matching shorts. I wasn't as well dressed this time, but I felt small anyway. \"Small\" meaning I didn't feel like I quite belong there. \n\nWe both went for the $34.95 Dine Around Town menu but upgraded from the filet mignon to the ribeye for $8 more. We also added an appetizer, the $13 Mushrooms Stuffed with Crabmeat (see photo). Instead of using portabellos, the obvious choice for stuffing, they went with four giant button mushrooms and put a combination of lump crabmeat and romano cheese in them. Good enough but then they decided to oversalt them. Too bad. This was followed by the Steakhouse Salad (see photo), as generic a pile of greens as you could imagine with a ladle of balsamic vinaigrette on top. \n\nThe Ribeye followed on a 500-degree plate with butter sizzling on the side. It's their idea of a carnivorous spectacle, but I have to tell you there was nothing extraordinary about the cut being served. Medium rare gives you a steak that's pink on the inside but severely charred on the outside, the contrast a bit too stark for my taste. The sides were very old-school heavy - milky Creamed Spinach and buttery Mashed Potatoes (see photos). A dairy-palooza. The meal ended with a duet dessert - a Chocolate Mousse in a Chocolate Cup and a square of Carrot Cake (see photo). A Betty Crocker double-header.\n\nWe had to get doggy bags for our leftover ribeyes, and then our time warp felt complete. It was time to jump forward to the year 2010 when doctors were to prove that such heavy, cardiac-arrest-inducing meals kill you.

It's their thing to cook all their meats in parsley and butter, but the taste is almost too overpowering for the meat. This could possibly be because I ordered a 16oz rib-eye instead of a filet. I imagine with a filet, you wont have too much of the buttery taste and it would be just enough to satiate your appetite. the meat itself tasted good though and was super tender so I can't complain about that.\n\nDon't get the cauliflower au-gratin. it was barely cheesy and too liquid-y. The creamed spinach tasted more spinach-y than other places, but i liked it because of this.\n\nThe salads are HUGE. I was almost getting negative utility trying to finish my caesar so I wasn't wasting food. Definitely worth it if you like salad. It's pretty much a meal in itself. \n\nThe blue cheese in the salad was good, and I believe the blue cheese in itself is good, but the blue cheese crust I got on my ribeye didnt add much. It wasn't even a crust really as it was more just panko and blue cheese dumped on one side of my steak. I sorta expected it to be around the edges of my steak and to stick there like a bread crust or something. Misleading symantics.\n\nThe bread was awful. It tastes like the dinner roll you get on an airplane. It's super soft and they just give you a load of butter to spread on it. Now, I could be a bit biased coming from SF, but almost all other steakhouses or fancy restaurants in SF give you some awesome sourdough or fancy branded bakery bread, but this bread was just not up to par.

It was my dad's 80th birthday-- obviously a very special occasion for all of us. Unfortunately, this place has gone drastically downhill. It used to be one of the very best with the most delicious steaks I ever had. \n\nStarting at the bar, the bartender failed to put ginger slices in all of the otherwise delicious coconut ginger lemon drop martinis (didn't know this until the server brought one to the table the correct way). Now, the server... Pleasant enough, but the service was grossly under par; it took almost an HOUR for us to even order our meals, had to ask for bread three times, no one came to fill our waters, and the waiter came only ONCE to ask how everything was! When he did, I didn't get a chance to respond before he whisped away. My ribeye was so full of fat and gristle, only one third was edible and even that was overcooked. My dad's filet was overcooked and only so-so. The crab stuffed shrooms were fishy, as was mom's sea bass. The creamed spinach was the only dish that wasn't disappointing. Getting the desserts and the check took a painstakingly long time also, well over 20 minutes for each, and waiting for the change almost as long again. Knowing it was someone's 80th birthday, consideration should have been made not to extend the dining experience into a late hour! It was not particularly busy this Thursday eve and were plenty of servers in the room. \n\nTo their credit, the manager came over and agreed my steak was unacceptable (the plate was piled with a wasteland of inedible crap). It was taken off the bill and the desserts comped. Only this warrants an extra star for my rating. \n\nI regret to this day that I chose Ruth's Chris as the venue for such a special night. It ruined the entire occasion for us, and I'm not exaggerating. Disappointing is an understatement. I'm very sad I don't have the confidence in the quality of service or food to return here again-- particularly for the price! Should have just gone to Marin Joe's. :(", "author": "Mick E."}

Everyone from the greeters to the servers were on point and made sure you were enjoying your meal. And it's not a hard meal to enjoy. All our steaks were cooked perfectly. My fillet mignon was perfectly medium rare and the warmed plate help maintain the right temperature. It was just a well seasoned and juicy steak to enjoy. I think the sides were forgettable (I wish I could have just spinach without the cream but when in a steakhouse I guess) but the steaks truly shine. \n\nDine about town is a good time to stop by Ruth Chris for a good old-fashoned steak dinner with the sides and all for a good price but otherwise,  it truly is a good steak house with amazing service.

We arrived early as parking was a little hard to find. We were seated closer to our reservation time. The hostess seated us at a booth that was right by the bar. It felt pretty casual and I am pretty sure we were in the cocktail lounge instead of the main dining room. As I walked to the bathroom I realized that that's where the main dining room was, a bit quieter too. Nonetheless we had a great experience from beginning to end. \n\nWe both ordered Ruth's classic dinner. I started off with butter lettuce BLT, if you love blue cheese then this salad is amazing. I planned on only eating half to save room for the steak but I basically finished all of my salad :). My boyfriend ordered the Caesar salad and the dressing was pretty good. We both decided on the ribeye because it's our favorite cut of steak with the right ratio of fat and meat! MmM! Thinking about it makes my mouth water. You also get to choose a side each, we chose green beans and garlic mashed potatoes. Omg the steak was so good and stayed hot for pretty long. It was very tender, I felt like it melted in my mouth and it had so much flavor from the butter and salt & pepper. Hands down the best steak I've ever had! I was sad I filled myself up on bread and salad that I didn't finish my steak. It was great for lunch leftovers the next day though :P. My boyfriend was pretty amazed by the quality of the steak as well, he said it's comparable to flemings where he had the best steak of his life! Lol.

The manager came up and thought he was doing me a favor by offering to pay for a $10 dessert.   Here I take my date to what is supposed to be a five-star restaurant and he insults me that way. Instead of sucking it up, sincerely apologizing and doing us right, which would have shown us they take full accountability,  it took a significant discussion before he owned up appropriately for me eating by myself. \n\nWe had a great waiter, Thomas, who fully understood what occurred and did everything he could to help us.  Kudos to him.  \n\nBased upon how the management handled the situation, I will not be going back there and suggest that all of you try one of the other great steak restaurants in the city such as Bobos, Harris', House of Prime Rib  and other locations where the management knows what they're doing and how to properly treat customers.", "author": "Peter E."}

First time I called while driving, the hostess said I needed to fax or email my credit card and my driver's license to complete the reservation.  Since I was driving, I got off the phone and was going to call back to get their fax number or email address.  A week later when I called back, I was able to make reservations for 8 people without providing my credit card or driver's license.  OK...more convenient, but that's the real policy?\n\nMost of the people in my party ordered from their classic dinner special and added items to our dish.  My filet was very tender and cooked perfectly, as expected in this type of steakhouse.  I added on a lobster tail with my entree.  Literally a 3 biter, and that's how small the lobster tail was.  It was a bit rubbery too. The salad that came will the special was pathetic looking.  A decent variety of greens and butter garlicky croutons, but the vinaigrette dressing was slapped on - not even a simple toss.  Come on!  This is Ruth's Chris, not Denny's!  Our dessert was carrot cake which was very good.\n\nService was OK.  Our waiter was good when he could be found.

But Ruth's Chris will always have a special place in my heart. Sorry Alexander's...but I'm team Ruth's Chris!\n\nThis is definitely my favorite steak spot to date. We had made reservations for a Saturday night and arrived about 15 minutes early. Unfortunately we did not get seated for almost an hour even though we had reservations, due to an accident on the bridge that had delayed other customers as well. The unprofessional hosts with somewhat snobby attitudes did not help either. Nonetheless the restaurant made up for the inconvenience by offering those who waited a while with complimentary dessert or appetizers. \n\nWe usually start off with the Caesar salad, which is good, but nothing out of the ordinary or amazing.\n\nMy boyfriend is a Ribeye kind of guy while I usually go for the New York Strip. Both are absolutely juicy and melt in your mouth, especially the Ribeye. I have to say that the heaping amounts of butter they put on their steak contributes to the juiciness as well...which in this case my health conscious self doesn't mind.\n\nThese are the different side dishes we've tried as well as my ratings:\n\nSweet Potato Casserole: Incredibly sweet! I love sweet and savory so I didn't mind this dish, but it is a bit too sweet for someone who wants something more savory with their steak. This dish is more of a dessert than a side dish to accompany your steak. \n\nMacaroni and Cheese: I love macaroni and cheese, and I do enjoy Ruth's Chris mac and cheese. But I have to say that it is average and nothing special. \n\nCreamed Spinach: LOVE! My boyfriend isn't too much of a fan due to the richness, but I thought it was very creamy and hearty. I loved combining this side dish with my steak.\n\nPotatoes au Gratin: Now I had this dish in Anaheim and I have to say that I wasn't impressed. Potatoes au Gratin is always delicious and hearty, but this dish was bland and tasteless. I'm willing to try this again in the San Francisco location because I love a good Potatoes au Gratin. \n\nNow for dessert...obviously the best part! We decided to choose dessert for our complimentary dish, and I'm sure glad we did. I'm just upset that I ate so much because by the time we got to the dessert, I was absolutely stuffed. We ordered the Chocolate Sin Cake, and I highly recommend it. This dessert is essentially a Molten Lava Cake topped with vanilla ice cream, and comes with a side of berries drizzled in chocolate sauce. I couldn't get enough of it...even though I was stuffed like no other. \n\nCan't wait to keep coming back here for more yummy food and memories!", "author": "Tara S."}

The food was great, and our server was very good.  After racking up a $800 bill, we went outside to pick up our vehicle from Ruth's Chris' curbside valet, and the valet said, \"I have some bad news.\"  He proceeded to take me to my vehicle and told me that he didn't realize that I had ski racks, and they were torn off when he drove into the parking garage.  Not to mention the fact that my recently detailed vehicle was completely covered in the insulation from the ceiling.  The valet felt bad and offered to pay for the damage out of his pocket, however, I didn't think that was right.  \n\nThe next day, I brought my vehicle back to my auto detailer and had him re-detail it ($160.00).  I then paid an auto repair company another $250.00 to fix the scratches in the paint from where the ski racks fell onto the top of my car.  I then had to purchase new ski racks (~ $650.00).  \n\nAfter this was all said and done I decided to call Ruth's Chris and talk to a manager to let them know what happened.  The manager told me that she would contact the owner of the valet company and have him contact me.  My intention was not to get reimbursed for the damage but to let him know what had happened to me so that he could have a talk with the valet.\n\nNeedless to say, the owner of the valet company never called...... \n\nIf you visit Ruth's Chris, I would skip the valet service.

It was a Monday night and the restaurant was somewhat slow. All the better for great service. And indeed the service was perfect. Appetizers included seafood platter that was simply huge. I didn't try that but my friends said it was delicious. Main course for me was a sirloin steak. It was perfectly cooked medium rare. Their beef is grain fed, not grass fed. Though the idea of a feedlot-factory farm is somewhat disappointing, most top steakhouses serve the grain fed as the beef is more tender and flavorful. It is indeed. The steak was divine. Though it was a large cut, I could have eaten two! When I go for steak, I want the bomb. This was one of the best I've had in SF, though not as good as some I had in Argentina last December (hard to beat those).\nI'm struggling with the four or five stars but alas, the potatoes were what lost them the perfect score. The mashed were just o.k. and not stellar as they should be for the prices you're paying. What I really loved is the total lack of Hipster pretension and another bare \"fake reclaimed wood\" table that is so evident in this city. And how can you go wrong with linen tablecloths?

I recently went to a Ruth's Chris in San Diego and the food was great and the service impeccable.  This is what I've come to expect at a Ruth's Chris.   Sadly I can no longer say the same for the SF restaurant.  I went to the SF Ruth's Chris twice in November and both times were disappointing.  The first time my medium rare filet was cooked medium to medium well.  This happens but I had finished my side before anyone came to check on my steak which isn't particularly good service.  To the managers credit, he seemed genuinely concerned and apologetic, and they quickly got me a perfectly cooked steak.  Thus, I was willing to try again.\n\nThe second visit was fairly awful and it was especially disappointing because we were there for a special occasion dinner for two.  It was the night before Thanksgiving and the dining room was practically empty.  All but one table was empty and booths on an adjacent wall were also empty.  We were enjoying our wine and salads when they inexplicably sat a family with two rambunctious kids in the booth right behind us.  I realize kids are going to be kids especially when they're young and these kids were approximately 3 and 5 years old.  So why would they seat young kids behind a couple having a romantic dinner when they had an abundance of empty tables and booths???  \n\nThe food was also a bit disappointing.  My filet wasn't overcooked which was a plus but about 3oz of it was heavily marbled/fatty (see uploaded image).  I order filet because I prefer lean steak.  The service was also disappointing.  The waiter, and other restaurant staff personnel, were running around trying to locate crayons for the kids.  First they managed to locate two crayons so those were brought to booth  with the promise of searching for more, better crayons.  During the crayon search, our water glasses sat empty and worse yet - my wine glass sat empty.  Considering the poor seating arrangements, the least they could have done was made sure I could order plenty of wine.  \n\nInstead of enjoying great conversation our adult 'indoor' voices were overshadowed (e.g., NO!  WE DO NOT climb over the booth.  NO!  WE DO NOT climb up on the ledge.  NO. You cannot have bread because you need to eat your dinner.  STOP SHRIEKING!  Do you have a hearing problem? You need to learn to use your indoor voice.  NO!  You CANNOT get up.  The last time you and your sister ran around the restaurant and really embarrassed me.  NO.  YOU NEED TO STOP THAT.   This is why daddy doesn't like to eat at restaurants with us.  And on and on and on.)  The father even joked with our waiter that at least the restaurant wasn't packed.\n\nInstead of savoring a great meal we ate and left as soon as possible.  On the way out we let the manager, a blonde woman, know that we were disappointed and perplexed about their seating choices.  She gave us a very insincere apology and told us they didn't know when people would arrive so they just sat the tables in order as people came in.  At that point we really wished we had gone to Alexander's, and next time we will.  There are too many great steakhouses and restaurants in SF to go to such disappointing ones.", "author": "Cantik E."}

I had the house salad, ribeye 12oz, cream spinach side, and the flour-less chocolate cake with fresh berries. It was part of Ruth's classic meal, (only about $10 more than the steak by itself, so $54 (?)). He had Cesar salad, filet mignon, raspberry sorbet and some champagne. We both did not share and were just way too full by the end of it. \n\nThe steak was awesome, and it should be with all the butter!\n All that food came to about $150+$30 tip.

He refused to have the bill split after it had been charged and told us to grab our things and leave the restaurant. My friend was there with his family and was extremely embarrassed in front of them - what was supposed to be an evening of good conversation and memories was quickly ruined by Josh who felt it was more necessary to force probably the only international party (we are from South Asia) of out of the restaurant.

They give the option of no butter or extra butter, but I just got it as is and it was GOOD. I was afraid the hot plates would over cook my medium rare, but it was perfect! The hot plate keeps the steak fairly hot till the last bite. I hate when my steak comes out dry so I thought this was great. Mashed potatoes and creamed spinach was just okay in my opinion.. but definitely will be back for the filet mignon since this has just become one of my favorite steakhouses.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give this place a 5/5 stars is because I came here to celebrate my bf's bday and I was hoping for it to be really special with the small bday cake/dessert at the end or at least something with a candle where he can make a wish or just anything that says happy birthday. This was something I specifically asked for it in my notes when I made reservations.. Our waiter (not sure her name, but she had short hair with bangs that cut straight across) knew it was my bf's bday, but she came up to us when we were finishing up our food and ASKED if we wanted the bday dessert. I thought that was weird cuz other restaurants I've eaten at don't ASK since they usually just bring it out if it's someone's  bday. I even saw the other waiters just bring out bday desserts to the other tables.

He was looking forward to it all week so we got all dressed up and headed over (so lucky our hotel was right across the street). The place is cute, pretty simple, and it was pretty much empty at 5:30p which was fine by us. We were greeted by a friendly waitress who seated us in a private area which was romantic. It's dimly lit, but not so much so that it's uncomfortable. She offered tap or sparkling water, and was pretty attentive to our needs. He ordered a rather large steak (by the way this place is PRICEY but the portions are HUGE) and I ordered their stuffed chicken. We also ordered lobster macaroni and cheese, asparagus, and dessert. The steak wasn't cooked to how he asked but he killed it anyway (I had a bite and it was pretty good). My stuffed chicken was overwhelmingly seasoned (the stuffing anyway), the chicken itself was fine. It's stuffed with this herb concoction that had a strange texture. I'm typically not that picky about food but if I'm paying $30 for chicken it'd better blow my mind. Again, the portion was HUGE though. The lobster macaroni and cheese is rich and delicious and the asparagus was cooked to perfection. The cool thing about this place is we shared our sides and it was perfect for the two of us so it didn't bother us that you have to order everything separately. They even had him choose a steak knife out of this really cool box of knives from different countries which was such a nice touch he didn't even know how to act. We ordered their creme brulee which is my favorite dessert and they made it PERFECT!

And of course they exceeded expectations. The service was good the drinks were great and the steaks were exceptional!\n I can't say enough about how accommodating they were. Luckily we were able to make a reservation that afternoon for 730 that evening for a party of 6, after a long day of walking around the city shopping we ended up there an hour early for our reservation. So we decided to go to the bar and order drinks. By the time my brother and I ordered everybody drinks and and sat down to enjoy them the hostess came over and had our table ready. When we got to our table they had happy birthday confetti spread out the table which I thought was very nice and thoughtful. My son my brother and myself had the cowboy ribeye, my daughter had a 2 pound lobster that took up the whole plate and my mother in law and wife had crab cakes and a filet mignon. Everything was cooked to perfection the lobster was great and the steaks melted in our mouth! Thank you for making my sons 15th birthday a memorable one and showing him what that Next Level Steakhouse is all about. #GreatXperience", "author": "Sancho M."}

The classic, 3-course option will run you between $43 - $53 per person (before tax and tip) and includes a starter, entree, side dish, and dessert. I like the surf and turf filet and lobster combo or the 12 oz. ribeye. I always order my meat with a garlic blue cheese crust and extra butter. I get my salad to-go so that I have room to finish my steak, which makes for a nice light lunch the next day, especially after chowing down on so much fat and protein the evening prior. I've never met a side dish I didn't like and desserts are generally pretty decent, though my appetite is rarely strong enough to power through to the very end.\n\nEntrees served on sizzling, 500-degree plates ensure that your meal will be hot and juicy down to the very last bite, unlike some places where your medium-rare meat will end up a cold, gelatinous mess halfway through dinner.\n\nFinally, in my experience, every member of the Ruth's Chris staff have always gone out of their way to treat their diners like valued guests. Service is consistently warm, friendly, efficient, and attentive.\n\nThere's nothing bad I can say about Ruth's Chris. It's always a pleasure to dine here which keeps us coming back again and again.

Everything they do they do well, and the service typically is amazing.  \n\nThat said this negative review is for the experience I had last night at the bar.  I am taking some medication for allergies that do not mix well with alcohol, so when I was at the bar last night, I asked the bartender what would be good without any alcohol.  He responded to me with an answer that he only had Sprite and that was it and walked away.  For 20 minutes he never came back.  He did manage to clean some glasses, and serve everyone else in the bar.  My uncle who was with me also wanted to order some wine, and he never served him or anyone else in our party of 5.  I felt like he deliberately avoided us because I wasn't drinking and that is horrible service that is not typical of Ruth Chris.\n\nLater at dinner, when our waitress took our orders I asked her for a fun non alcoholic mixed drink, and she came back with a delicious virgin blueberry mojitto which I loved and enjoyed.  I think it came to the same bar, and the same bartender but somehow when I asked he only had Sprite.\n\nI will never order drinks from him again (not that he would serve me apparently and if I had more time  I would let the restaurant know formally.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-19", "description": "I came here Friday night for the \"Dine About Town\" dinner. \n\nOnce you're seated, they will bring you a regular menu. You need to ASK for the dine about town menu. \n\nThe bread is soft and warm, and it comes with whipped/spreadable/dip-able butter. I'm guessing it comes straight from the oven because it takes awhile for them to bring it to you request more.\n\nThe steaks come on a HOT A S S, SIZZLING plate. My mouth waters every time I watch the video I took of my butter-bubbling, medium-rare, 16 oz ribeye. Do NOT forget to NOT touch it. If you are wearing long sleeves or nice garments, be careful for oil splatters. The ribeye was cooked and seasoned to delicious perfection. The buttery flavor melts in your mouth. Mm mm mmm.\n\nFor sides, both the mashed potatoes and spinach are tasty. I think both are necessary, so share with someone. Again...it's the butterrrrr ^___^. \n\nDessert was also delectable. I left a request on my reservation via OpenTable to include a \"Congratulations\" message on my bf's dessert for his graduation. I was worried that they would forget, but I'm happy to say that they followed through. My bf was very pleased. :)\n\nThere was a table right next to us that caused quite a scene in the restaurant. It was rather ridiculous and theatrical to observe someone trying so damn hard to get comped. I understand that the entire staff, including our server, was occupied trying to deal with this crazy lady, but that doesn't make it okay to forget EVERY OTHER CUSTOMER in the restaurant. We paid $140 including tip for 2 people, even for a \"discounted\" menu, so we expected exceptional service. We waited for our water glasses to be filled for well over 20 minutes, but our server never came back around. We had to ask the restaurant manager in vicinity for our check, and then we had to ask another server to take payment. \n\nA high-end restaurant like Ruth's Chris should be capable of upholding their professionalism. They should not allow all of their attention to be diverted to rude/obnoxious customers. Bad vibe for good customers. \n\nNeedless to say that the service was not on par that night. But the food was good, so I'll be back again. Hopefully there will not be another ratchet cheapo next time to nearly ruin everyone's dining experience.", "author": "Sandy L."}

From the food to the service I couldn't ask for anything better. Crab cakes were almost 100% crab, very little fillers if any. Stuffed mushroom were small mouthfuls of deliciousness. So good. Harvest salad was creative and delightful. Ahhhhmazing steaks. We had the filet mignon with the bone in and the cowboy ribeye, which is the ribeye with the bone in-- the best way to get the most taste from your meat.

As a steak lover, I had my chance on a business trip to San Francisco. My coworker and I were seated promptly and courteously. A basket of warm bread was provided while we looked at the menu, but the bread was rather tasteless.\n\nBoth of us selected the fixed price dinners, me with a 10-ounce ribeye and she with the (6oz?)filet+shrimp. Both of us had the strawberry, almond and blue cheese salad as a starter, and it was quite large and very tasty.\n\nOur entrees were served on the trademark sizzling platter. But I was disappointed in the ribeye - while it was done properly, I found it lacking in flavor (other than salt) and I've had better ribeyes from the grocery store. My coworker's filet and shrimp was \"just ok\", she said. She had the \"Fingerling potatoes\" as a side dish, and I had the green beans with garlic. The portions were much larger than I expected. The potatoes were in a spiced sauce that was rich and tasty, but there was a lot of it! Neither of us finished the side dishes.\n\nI'm a sucker for Key Lime Pie, so when I saw that on the regular dessert menu I asked if I could upgrade to that from the included cheesecake. Indeed I could for $4. Again, the portion size was very large - enough for two. The pie itself was better than I've seen some places, but the crust was soft rather than crunchy and the filling didn't have the tartness I like. Then again, when I make this at home, I double the key lime juice content.\n\nThe service was excellent and we were very comfortable there. The fixed-price dinners were a good value, all things considered, but I expected the beef to be better than it was. I still ended up spending $70 (not including tip), and that's a lot of money for a mediocre steak dinner.\n\nI'm glad I tried Ruth's Chris, but won't be eager to return.", "author": "Steve L."}

The server girls was so nice, she gave me extra side dish since she brought a wrong one. Water was refilled without asking. Don't get me wrong, I had a good time. BUT, I got sick.

All is well.\n\nPhil, our waiter and the rest of the staff who helped prepare/serve our food were great. He was very helpful, clear and concise when it came to letting us know what was on the menu etc... I also saw him converse with other patrons who asked him very direct questions. He handled that well.\n\nAnyway, the bread was SO delicious and to pair it with the spicy lobster. Wow, it tasted like a fresh roll Vietnamese sandwich (but with an american spin to it).\n\nFood came out quickly. Yum, yum. They also carry A-1 sauce.

First, we didn't have a reservation when we called from the road. \nThe Ma\u00eetre d' who answered told my girlfriend that the wait, since we didn't have a reservation would be a 30-40 minute wait. \n\nShe asked what time would be the next available, and he quickly asked \"Well What time would you like to come here?\" - Mind you this is at 7:45.\nShe replied \"8:00\" and he said \"Ok.\" - Really? What happened to the 40 minute wait?\n\nWe found a space right away  and checked in, around 8. We sat there and waited around for 20 minutes,  while everyone else was seated, but what was worst was that the restaurant was half full...umm..okay?\n\nNow to the real review:\nWe were waited on by a strange Waiter named Edward. Every time I would ask him about recommendations or order an item, he kept giving me long blank stares....(?).\nMy GF and I both ordered our steaks Medium. \nThe steaks came out bloody, and more on the Medium-Rare side. I'm okay with it, but my GF was freaked out, and didn't have much of an appetite for it. \nSend it back, right?\nThat would have been fine, except our Waiter, Edward was not to be seen for the rest of the meal. As a matter of fact, there were several occasions where he walked past and gave me his signature blank stare, and kept walking even though I made eye contact. \nHello? whatever happened to: \"How is everything?\" \"Did you need another glass of wine?\" \"How is the food?\" etc. \n\nThe next time I saw our friend was when he brought us the check..pretty weak, right? Maybe since there were only two of us, Eddy decided a larger party was more worth his while..who knows. \n\nOnly thing I can say is, that for the prices they are charging in this economy, they really should treat their customers better - again, there is a reason why the restaurant was half full.\n\nWon't be back and don't recommend, unfortunately since the food was pretty good besides the bloody steak.", "author": "Darren J W."}

The girlfriend & I were here during the Dine About Town promo. Our reservations were for fairly early in the evening, so we luckily managed to park on the street only a block away.\n\nArriving a few minutes early, we were seated immediately after we got around a disorganized mob of tourists who did not have reservations. Decor at this Ruth's Chris is stately but the layout is a little labyrinthine & confined compared to the openness & panorama of the San Diego Ruth's Chris. Service was friendly & mostly attentive, with a hiccup or 2. After a quick peek at the menu for comparison, we both decided to pick from their Dine About Town options. In hindsight, I would not make the same decision. The girlfriend got the Petite Filet & I upgraded to the 16 oz. Ribeye.\n\nFor our Dine About Town orders, we each got a salad, our designated steak (I ordered mine rare & the girlfriend ordered hers medium rare) w/ a side of mashed potatoes  & a dessert. Bread & salad came out before long. Steaks followed at a good interval after. There is certainly no issue with the food here. The bread & salad were very good. Both my Ribeye & the girlfriend's Petite Filet were divine & cooked exactly to specification. The mashed potatoes were supremely creamy. The dessert, though not grand in any way, was nice.\n\nWhere there was an issue, I suppose, was the value of the Dine About Town offering vs. the Ruth's Classic prix fixe on the menu. Initially, the Dine About Town deal was a few $ less, but that difference disappeared after the markup for my Ribeye upgrade. The Ruth's Classic prix fixe has better options. This was basically what I ordered at my previous Ruth's Chris dining experience in San Diego & that felt like a fuller, more well-rounded meal than the Dine About Town dinner. It's simply better bang for the buck & that is actually a good thing. Instead of trying to get into Ruth's Chris on the cheap during Dine About Town, just go whenever the mood strikes & order their prix fixe deal.", "author": "John M."}

Unfortunately we don't feel the same about the San Francisco location. \n\nEveryone and everything but our server seemed to be up-to-par. We got great parking right in front and didn't have to pay. The ambience was nice and relaxing. It felt a bit city-ish and dark but that's normal in steakhouses. Our glasses were always full. The food was amazing and satisifying. \n\nWe (me, my GF and her Mom) weren't checked on much by our server once a larger table was sat in his section. We were hungry and finished the house bread and we received no offer of more. It just didn't feel like he cared once the bigger party came. My GF's Mom said she just didn't feel welcomed or like she was being paid attention to. My GF and I absolutely agreed, especially after having such a memorable experience in Walnut Creek.\n\nOverall I rounded down to 3 stars but felt the food was 4 stars.

Warning - this is a long, detailed review, but I have to give them the credit they deserve.\n\nThe ambiance was sophisticated. Definitely felt classy eating at this fancy schmancy restaurant. Dim lighting, professional service, and no noisy kids... it was just great :)\n\nMore bang for your buck - go with the Ruth's Classics menu, which gives you a selection on an appetizer, entree, side, and dessert. Depending on what entree you choose, it'll come out to about $40 or $50/person, which is not bad at all, considering the amount of food you'll be getting. That's what we did.\n\nMy order:\n\nCaesar salad - honestly, it was all about the CROUTONS!!! Buttery, garlicky, cheesy goodness!\n\nFilet mignon with bleu cheese/garlic/panko bread crumb crust (additional $3) - Meat was perfect, tender, juicy... placed on a plate of deliciously browned butter, and the crust on top just added another layer of flavor. I'm not a big fan of the pungent flavors of bleu cheese, but the bleu cheese topping was recommended by a friend of mine, and I'm glad I listened. It was worth it!\n\nCreamed spinach - it was good, but forgettable.\n\nChocolate explosion (additional $3) - YUM! This wasn't part of the Ruth's Classic menu items for dessert, but I'm a chocolate lover so this was up my alley and totally worth the extra $3. It's chocolate molten cake with warm chocloate fudge, caramel, and vanilla ice cream.\n\nHis order:\n\nSteak salad with Italian dressing - he ate every nite of it, need I say more?\n\nRibeye with peppercorn sauce (additional $3) - Tasty meat, cooked perfectly, also served on a plate of browned butter with the sauce on top - it was very flavorful! The sauce was good, but I prefer the bleu cheese crust.\n\nMashed potatoes - buttery, creamy, and very good... better than the creamed spinach, in my opinion.\n\nCheesecake & chocolate bark with walnuts - this dessert came with the classic menu. The cheesecake was very unique - at first bite, you can really taste the tang of the cheese and then you taste the subtle sweetness in the end. The chocolate bark was good, too - sea salt was sprinkled on top and I think we tasted some type of chili in there. \n\nWe were served some french bread at the beginning of our meal with whipped butter. The bread reminded me of banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) bread - it was warm, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside... the whipped butter just made it even better. Although we could have had another serving of bread, we opted not to because we had so much food lined up ahead of us.\n\nOur waiter recommended the calamari, so we ordered that, too. Perfectly cooked - the batter was light & crispy, the meat was tender. There was also a light sweet & sour sauce drizzled over it. I apprecited that their halved lemons had a mesh cloth tied around it to keep the seeds inside - loved the attention to detail :)\n\nOur left overs consisted of half of the steaks, most of the sides, and half of my chocolate explosion dessert.\n\nIt was such a great experience, I cant' wait until we visit again!", "author": "Janis A."}

I tried to be healthy and ordered vegetable side, but I failed because the veggie was covered in oil also.\n\nThe food was delicious since it was overly greased. My filet mignon was thick and super juicy and tender. But I was done after eating half of it since it was quite heavy.\nAfter I was bloated, the chocolate cheesecake arrived!

Not to mention, she got me seated at another table right away with no delay. They transferred my order to the new table, my initial server was wonderful and came over to check on us and ensure that it was a smooth transfer. They really really really helped make the best of an uncomfortable situation for me (no fault of theirs). Thank you, Mandy, and our initial server (sorry forgot his name)!

The butter for the complimentary bread was so tasty and the bread was super soft.  I Had the Rib-eye Steak cooked \"well.\"  I had been wanting to try their steaks for some time now.... It was well worth the wait! Tastiess steak I've ever had.. No A1 needed, it would only take away from the amazing taste. \n\nWife had the house salad with ranch dressing.

Don't hesitate, just order it.   \n\nThe extremely hot plates:  The steaks are served on plates that are 150 degrees or so  in order to keep your steak hot for the whole meal.  \n       Tip: if you are debating to get your steak medium-rare or medium...get it medium-rare and the plate can literally cook your meat more to your liking. \n\nThe butter: Oh, where do I start...the filet comes surrounded in butter.  You can dip your meat in it, your veggies in it, your bread in it, the list goes on and on.  As stated by G\u00e9rard Depardieu, \"the secret to life is butter\".\n\nSurprisingly, it's not very difficult to make reservations at this place, although on both my visits, they didn't seat us for about 10-15min after our reservation time, which isn't really a big deal.  \n\n\nIf you want to get buttered up (who doesn't), eat at Ruth's.", "author": "Juliana K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-08-20", "description": "In preparation of attending this establishment for it's fine meats and extensive wine collection, I collaborated with my inner \"Bourdain,\" imaginging the white linen table cloth, freshly polished silveware, and marvelously clear, spotless wine glasses and finely aged and marbled meats.\n\nAt least they got the 3 out of the 5.\n\nI've been to Ruth Chris' several times, however not in San Francisco.  Located in a corner lot on busy Van Ess, I was excited and more than willing to brave the cold nights that San Francisco has to offer to make a valiant attempt to have some fine cut meats as I have had in the past in Ruth Chris locations in Texas.  Alas, the San Francisco establishment failed.  \n\nI thought to myself, \"Perhaps I simply should not write this review with the fear of causing severe ire amonst my fellow Yelpers that would skin me alive for tearing apart their beloved establishment, step by step.\"\n\nNahhhh.\n\nI entered this busy restaurant with my girlfriend - small, quaint, packed.  I would say \"about right\" for San Francisco.  \n\nOur table wasn't quite ready, so we waited at the bar.  After standing and standing, the bartender, Arturo, finally took notice from his break neck speed of pouring beverages to ask if he could help me.\n\nWhat happened next shocked me.  And I think set the tone for the rest of the night.  Upon asking me what I would like to drink, before I could even utter, \"Yes, I woud like.....\" - HE WALKED OFF TO OTHER END OF THE BAR.\n\nWow.  You're asking me to pay $17 for beer and you WALK OFF??!!\n\nJose, another bartender, was kind enough to ask me if I needed anything and at this point, Arturo had returned to the cash register which I promptly announced, \"No Jose, I think I'll wait for Arturo as I'd like to give him a piece of my mind.\"  Needless to say, I said that with a grin and was joking (not really, but I certainly was not going to cause a scene or embarrass anyone) and asked if I could have a beer and a Moscato.  Arturo, maybe because I shook him without really trying, reached up for the wine glasses on the rack and proceeded to shatter one, the lonely stem hanging up top, inverted, separated from the body.  \n\nI took our drinks, paid the man, with a tip mind you, and we were all seated.\n\nOur severs were Lena Joy and Hugo - Lena had little to no emotion in serving, even giving off a slightly irritated hint to her demeanor.  Hugo on the other hand, was excellent.\n\nWe were at a table of 10 and most of us ordered some varying cut of meat.  I ordered the Cowboy Ribeye - being from Texas, that's all I wanted - medium rare, on the bone, with a little blood pooling on the side (sorry to the Vegans for the visual).  The ribeye was supposedly aged in order to get that particular, marbling that good steaks should have.  \n\nThe steak came out on piping hot plate, very hot - I would not touch it if I were you.  I grabbed my knife and gently poked a side of the steak with my fork.  Here's my test - the knife test - I laid the knife on top and gently starting cutting, not applying too much pressure, watching the steak come apart.  I intentionally went after the portion with a tiny bit of grisle.  Unfortunately, I had to apply even more pressure as the meat simply was not separating.  Then  a little more.  By this time, trickles of the juices mixed with a tiny bit of blood began seeping against my knife, steam rising from the fresh cut.\n\nMy mouth watering, I began to chew.  \n\nThen I realized it...this meat had NOT been aged OR marbled.  If it HAD been aged, it was pulled and cut prematurely.  THIS WAS THE WORST STEAK I HAD EVER HAD FROM RUTH CHRIS.  I was utterly deflated.  The steak tasted as if I could have gotten the same thing from Safeway - hell, this wasn't even butcher quality.   I finished what I could and quietly sat in silence while the rest of our table finished up.\n\nWhat happened?  What did I just miss?  Why was this not what I thought.  A steak house that purchases steak cuts from Sysco or US Foods, but not grain fed meats.  No Kobe, not Wagyu....nothing \"high-end\" other than the prices.   \n\nIt was a flat steak.  \n\nUnfortunately, mabye I caught the cooks, and the house, on a bad day.  Perhaps I'll try them again in the future.  But in another city.  Even another state.\n\nBut for all of you meat afficcionados, I recommend thinking twice about eating at Ruth Chris.  I assure you, I can cook you a better cut of meat from Costco.  And I would even serve it with a smile.", "author": "Marvin J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-31", "description": "While they honor your special occasion and have extremely attentive service, the food is average at best.  The steak is melt in your mouth because of the marbling, which is to say \"fat\" in the steak and the extreme temperature at which they cook the steak and bring it to the table.   I don't particularly like my steak swimming in it's fat on the plate they present to you.  The steak is cooked at 1400 degrees and brought to your table on a 500 degree plate.  The sides however come in typical oval bowls for community sharing and by no means maintain a temperature conducive to eating, i.e. cold.  There is an extreme contrast between the steak and vegetables in temperature presentation.  They did reheat our vegetables when asked, and promptly, but still devolved to cold compared to the steak.  The sides are nothing to speak of either, very average at best.  We had the bacon, honey brussel sprouts which could have stood cutting out the stem in many of them rather than just sliing them in half.  They absorbed, slightly, the honey bacon flavor, but I have had them pan fried without breading at other restaurants that really enhanced the flavor and were 100% better than these.  The fingerling potatoes had run out just an hour into their service and they consider this one of their specialties.  So, we had mashed potatoes instead which were runny, or not stiff as you would expect whipped mash to be.  Again they were average or below at best.\nThen there were the charges:  I love a good ribeye, and they had varying levels of price from $49-119.  There were five different types you could have: petite, 16oz, cowboy and tomahawk, the latter two being bone in.  Of course they have a full gamit of other steaks as well at varying prices.  My pet peeve at a place that has inflated prices is not giving you options, but letting you muddle through on your own.  The waiter, knowing it was our first time did not give us any guidance, nor did the bus/waterboy.  They give you a choice of sparkling or still water, and not thinking about it, I thought I would be given plain water(when asking for \"still\"), but should have thought about it more and known when they give you this choice they are going to give you an inflated charge for it at $8.50 instead of informing you that you could have iced water from a pitcher, that is standard at most upscale restaurants, for free.\nParking )$5/hr is limited on the street, but there is a garage attached in the back that has a secret passageway to walk that opens on the sidewalk right next to the front door of the restaurant.  Expect a minimum of 2 hours at the restaurant.\nThe restrooms were not cleaned regularly throughout the night.  There were two stalls and an extra handicapped one in the female side.  My husband said there was only one stall in the mens.  Two sinks with soap dispensers that was only present at one just an hour into their seating.  There were only two seat covers left in my stall that had not been flushed prior to my using it fortunately it was only just stuffed with toilet paper.  There were expensive super soaker paper towels on the counter for wiping wet hands.  The restrooms were set off with an impermanent divider, so those sitting next to it did not feel as though they were.", "author": "Susan C."}

A 5:30 pm reservation for 4 got us to our table on time in the back room with several tables already occupied.  Service was prompt but wait person was hammy with flairs for selling.  Only wine was ordered, and decisions on what each one wanted were given promptly with seemingly helpful suggestion on how to change certain items in three prix fixed classic dinner order at a minimal extra cost of $3-4.  This was repeated a few times during the ordering process.  The 4th person in our party ordered surf and turf, and a la carte.  My partner & I didn't enjoyed the dinner at all.  It was our first time at this venue as well as it was for one of our hosts.  It was the second time for the other.  He decided to come here for the baked potato.  I shaded why we didn't go to HoPR, Morton, Harris, Issy's Osso or elsewhere.  I believe all of us have been to nearly all of the SF steak houses.  I have not gone here due to the not so favorable comments from family and friends who have patronized this place. \nI had the gumbo while my friends all ordered Caesar's Salad.  The gumbo was flavorful but you would think it was soup fit for seniors who forgot their dentures.  I admit that I am a senior but I do need some chewable bits of okra!  The others were enjoying their salad, that came with generous anchovies fillets on top.  Next came the steaks and the surf & turf when two of us had finished our first.  The third quickly finished his while the fourth being talkative expounding some Russian history and current event was just about half through his salad.  The waiter just had the BB cleared the table while trying to hint that the fourth gives his salad.  The wait person  should have suggested to him to set the unfinished salad to the side and have as a side, just as some Europeans do.  I even verbalized it but through the din the WP may be hard of hearing.  He just took it away when the diner was eating fast.\nHere come the steaks and the surf and turf.  The steaks all look black, perhaps it is the lighting of the room, but not.  The steaks were served in very hot plates but we were warned.  Unfortunately due to his salad taken away so ceremoniously by the wait person, his being scorched by a hot plate didn't help.  He remained stoic!  His steaks and mine were still cooking when they were served, sizzling due to the solid sutter or beef lard added after the steaks were done with no grilled marks.  They were ebony steaks.  When we cut into them they were no longer medium rare.  Quality was below average and quite gristly!\nOur dinners came with desserts, we didn't upgrade them.  While the a la carte Host didn't want any and wanted to share the dessert of his co-host, the waiter instead decided to bring him another one instead.  We two didn't know whether this extra dessert was complimentary.  We didn't have to pay, our hosts did.  We do appreciate their generous hospitality.  No thanks to the aggressiveness and the thoughtlessness of our wait person and the overcooked steaks made our experience a most unmemorable one during the holidays.  Our hosts left with a nearly whole uneaten steak and dessert doggie bag to bring whole.  And I did hear that our host who had the surf(lobster) was overdone and was okay with the fillet.  At least one host was marginally pleased. Happy New Year!!", "author": "John L."}

He called in to make a reservation and mentioned that it was an anniversary dinner. I got dressed up for the occasion, but I'm glad I did because inside is very dimly light and sophisticated, and I didn't want to appear too casual. Although I don't think it's that bad to go in with jeans and a nice shirt.\n\nAnyways, so the host brought us to our table and I was surprised to see rose petals scattered around the table. I thought my boyfriend was so romantic to do something this creative, but it turns out it was out of the courtesy of the restaurant (so minus one star off my boyfriend). The waiter started off by introducing himself and mentioned he was honored to celebrate the occasion with us and I thought that was really nice.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the lamb chops and I had the petite filet with shrimp. Both of our dishes were wonderful. I don't like lamb chops, but my boyfriend finished every single bite of it. My filet was so tender and it just melts in my mouth and the shrimp were cooked perfectly where it has a bit of that gummy and crunchy texture. Our meals also came with sides, I got the mushrooms and I can't remember what my boyfriend got. Overall, the meal was awesome and we were stuffed.\n\nWhile we were rubbing our bellies and ready to go, the waiter came out with the desserts with a candle in it. I forgot desserts were included in the meal! These people really do know how to add that extra gesture to make our celebration that much more special. So we slowly enjoyed our desserts and the bill came to around $150 something? My boyfriend paid so one star added back on, LOL. It definitely wasn't the type of restaurant we can enjoy every Friday night, but the staff were patient, friendly, and gave a little bit more effort to make us (the customers) to feel special.

I'd been here previously for Dine About Town and it really is more worth it to do the DAT prix fix menu. Anyhow, I digress..\nService: Immaculate. Superb. On point. that's pretty much to be expected with the prices they're charging.  \nFood: while the meat was well cooked, the seafood was way too heavy handed on the salt. It was almost unbearably salty. The sides were generous but nothing special at all; basic stuff you could make a home for less than a fraction of the cost they were charging (which was about $10/plate). \nOh! they were sweet in giving the Birthday Boy a free desert with a candle too! that was nice and a fine point, great way to end a bday dinner! also, the wine we had was quite good. they have a fine selection of wines. Lots of options.\nOverall, a good experience but probably not worth the full price. I'd wait around for DAT to come here; super awesome DAT spot. I blew over $200 (and under $300) on an all-out dinner for two with wine and dessert. We felt like exploding at the end of the meal because we were that stuffed. Moderation, folks.

I've been here about four times total now, and the first three times were just absolutely amazing. Good service, steaks, sides, everything was delicious, and service was great.\n\nBut...\n\nI had dinner there with my boyfriend last night. It was his first time there, so I did want him to enjoy it since it was my suggestion. We decided to start with the sizzlin' blue crab cakes ($20). I ordered the Ruth's Classics prix fixe menu, in which I chose the Caesar Salad, 6 oz. filet mignon with 3 shrimps, sauteed mushrooms as my side, and dessert ($42.95). He ordered the Cowboy Ribeye.\n\nThe crab cakes were delicious, as usual. This is actually the only place that I've ever enjoyed crab cakes from, because they are actually chock full of lump crab meat! Most other places are like batter with a side of crab.\n\nThe caesar salad was quite good, probably better than most other places. Only tidbit was that it was overdressed.\n\nBoyfriend's Cowboy Ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, as requested. However, it wasn't as tender as I've come accustomed to with ribeyes. It is possible that that is due to the bone, though. Not sure on that one. It was really juicy though =)\n\nFor my filet, it was definitely over-cooked. I requested medium-rare as well. I mean, c'mon, you DON'T order filet cooked anything above medium-rare. It definitely came out a solid medium, hardly any pink left in the center. I felt like such a wonderful cut of meat was being wasted =( The shrimps and sauteed mushrooms that came with, however, were delicious as always. Perfectly cooked.\n\nFor dessert we decided to have the Chocolate Explosion, essentially a molten lava cake served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, and the Creme Brulee. Both desserts were delicious, I think I enjoyed dessert more than my steak haha.\n\nNow, for the reason why this is only a 3-star, since the food sounds so great, right? It took forever for our food to come out, it felt like! I've never had this issue before. There was quite a while when we were eating our bread and butter, til when the crab cakes came out. At least refill our bread, if our appetizer is not ready yet? The pauses between each dish were just too long for the supposed standard of such a fine restaurant as Ruth's Chris. Also, the fact that my filet was overcooked left me a little bitter =/", "author": "Munnie T."}

He seemed to be more focused on other tables than ours- and this location doesn't have booths- buzz kill.  \n\nI realized that clearly, I had been spoiled by my 1st visit to Ruth's Chris in Troy. Our server and the others that worked with her were fantastic!  She was professional/friendly. A gentleman would come around a brush crumbs off our table on the regular, the water glasses were always full, and the food was sizzling hot.  Any and all requests were obliged- meaning,  I don't like stuff drenched in butter/oil, she listened and communicated it to the chef- therefore the food came out perfect.\n\nOk, enough about my favorite location, now onto my visit to San Francisco on Saturday 2/16/13.  My boyfriend and I had a 5pm reservation- we were seated promptly in a booth- which was requested- but that's about where it takes a turn as far as 'taking care of the customer'.  Our server  was m.i.a  for long periods of time.  He showed up on the scene to take our order and then seemed to leave the rest up to the nice guy who brought our bread and refilled my water.  This guy was the one clearing the table and such- while the server was chatting at the bar with other employees.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered from the Ruth's Classics wherein you get a salad, entree, side, and dessert.  I told the server that I don't like a salad that is drenched in dressing and he assured me that the apple, walnut, and blue cheese salad wasn't and that he would ask them to go 'light' on the dressing. I asked for it on the side but he said that it would be fine.  Ummm, hello- not sure what his idea of light dressing is but that wasn't the case. It was grossly over dressed- so oily that the plate was soaked- that's gross and not to mention- unhealthy.  The server was m.i.a so I flagged down the nice guy mentioned above and told him I couldn't eat it- he took care of it and brought me exactly what I wanted.  The salmon with steamed spinach and green beans were good although once again, the green beans were swimming in oil- I was very clear that I don't like butter or oil but once again it was as if the server couldn't be bothered with my preferences/request.  I'm paying a lot of $$$$ for this and I should get it how I want it.  Troy, MI and Boston, MA (for the most part) got it right.  Won't return to this location- perhaps Sacramento will be better.", "author": "Kristi O."}

Nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection.. very tender too. The mashed potatoes were good too.. and the salad was mehhh....

I really did enjoy the steak, so simply dressed with just salt and pepper and cooked to the perfect tenderness and juiciness. Hands down, being a steakhouse, they mastered that dish.

The three course meal at Dine About Town is $36.95 and we had an add-on of shrimp for $14. The meal starts with a nice salad but not up to par with the rest of the food in the place. I would have docked the rating a star for this salad, but it really wasn't an important part of hte meal. The filets and the salmon were cooked perfectly and came with mashed potatoes or creamed spinach. We tried both and they were both great. The ending of the meal was the real star-dropper here as they served a dry cupcake that was kind of chocolatey and had almost a garnish. Definitely not the perfect ending.\n\nDuring the meal, we had 2 glasses of wine each (two adults had wine, teenager had roy rogers).

You know you're going to eat well when even the free bread is good. Our steaks came sizzling hot. Seriously, don't touch it. Or eat it right away, you'll burn your mouth.

I mean, these cities are only 400 miles away from each other which when you look at it, is far in the 1820's but now they're next door neighbors. I still have yet to answer the question whether LA steak is better than SF steak but for now, I will describe my fantastic dinner at Ruth's Chris. \n\nWe were escorted to our seats which was a booth. Most of the time, I like booths but I can sit on anything (except for sizzling 500 degree plates.) The people who made these booths though forgot that people can be taller than 5 ft. We had to switch and although it took a few minutes, the waitress was extremely polite about it and always smiled. There are almost no tables in this restaurant except for big groups of people. All smaller groups sit in booths. Hopefully those smaller groups have smaller legs too or there will be a 12 hour long line for a table. \n\nAs you can imagine, I was not too pleased with Ruth's Chris so far. Then they served the bread which was freshly cooked (like everything here.) It was not milque toast, it was tropical fruit drink toast. I had a few pieces. The appetizer was definitely stopped me from giving Ruth's Chris one star. I ordered the barbecued shrimp and it blew my mind. The sauce and the shrimp blended together to create this wonderful dish. \n\nThen along came my medium ribeye steak. I have tasted better steak before but this was still really good. It was definitely cooked correctly, no problems with being too rare or too well. Some people though will not eat it unless cooked perfectly. Fortunately at Ruth's Chris, you can ask the waiter or waitress to put your steak back in four times until it is cooked correctly and the waiter or waitress will not grumble or even frown. I personally believe you get what you get but some people have to have steak a certain way. \n\nAlso, I had some lyonaise potatoes with my steak and I at first worried they had no flavor. As always though, onions make everything taste better (and made me cry of joy here,) because they definitely made the potatoes have more texture. Also, our fantastic waitress gave us spinach au grotto on the house which is spinach with cheese. Now everyone knows that spinach has the stereotype of tasting badly. This is Ruth's Chris however so the spinach and the cheese definitely went well together although I preferred having the more cheesier parts. \n\nFor dessert, we had cheesecake. I'll admit I am a cheesecake stickler because we make cheesecake at home all the time but I liked the cheesecake at Ruth's Chris. It was not lemony at all (if it were, the cheesecake would immediately fall below three stars,) but it did have almonds on the sides and I am not a fan of putting nuts along a cheesecake. \n\nOverall. Ruth's Chris had good steak, good potatoes, good spinach au grotto, barbecued shrimp TO DIE FOR but I would recommend that they either make bigger booths or have more table options. The booth is what prevented this from becoming a five star review.", "author": "Alec W."}

We started with some kind of shrimp cocktail, which was nothing special. \n\nBut the main course! Oh. My. God. We got the New york steak and the lobster&filet mignon. It was incredible how good the lobster tasted with the butter on the side, and the filet mignon was also amazing. Same with the steak. \n\nThe main reason why we went there; the creme brulee, barely went down after eating and eating of that delicious meat. But it was really good too :)", "author": "Diana G."}

He got the Rib Eye while I got the Petit Filet and we both thought they were perfect.  He said he would get Petit Filet next time though, since it was so good :)\n\nMinus one star for our disappointing sides and appetizer.  We got the Hash Browns which were highly recommended by the server and Asparagus w/ Hollandaise which is favorited on the menu.  The hash browns were burnt on the outside and soft on the inside.  Like an oversized croquet, but really burnt.  The asparagus were limp and over-steamed, and there was a side of hollandaise.  It is exactly as it sounds like...12 or so steamed spears of asparagus for $10. I really could have done that at home.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the Spicy Lobster. I love lobster and proooobably should have known better than to order it as an appetizer, but somehow I expected more from Ruth's Chris.  I take a bite out of it, and it tastes just like Walnut Shrimp that you get from Chinese restaurants.  Lightly fried, slightly sweet.  Not shrimpy, not lobster-y either. On any other occasion it would be decent, but at Ruth Chris for $17....not so much.\n\nRuth's Chris serves excellent steak, no doubt about it.  Not so sure about the other things on the menu. My ideal plan is to eat the appetizers at Harris across the street and have my steak at Ruth Chris.", "author": "Erica D."}

The steak was served on a sizzling hot plate and cooked just the way I liked (medium well), the potatoes were cooked to perfection and the asparagus was perfect with hollandaise sauce. \n\nLena Joy checked on us numerous times and asked if we needed anything else. Also their manager that night checked on us if we were enjoying our dinner. I thought that was nice. \n\nThe atmosphere was cute and comfy.

Several from our party arrived a bit early and had checked in with the host and was told that our table was not ready and that everyone from our party has not arrived yet so it will be approximately 10-12 minutes.  Fair enough.  By 8:05 PM everyone has arrived and the host was informed that our party is all present and was again informed 10-12 minutes.  We go to the bar and had several drinks and approximately 25 minutes has lapsed.  The person whose name the reservation was under, inquired again regarding the progress of our table and was told that they knew we were there and it will be ready shortly.  Long story short, we were not seated until over an hour after our party had arrived!  Then what good is a reservation?!  Furthermore, what kind of reply is the host's response of 'we know you're here' to a patron?\n\nFinally we were seated well past 9:00.  We order and our food comes.  The steaks were cooked well and were very good.  The side of brussels sprouts were excellent but the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were subpar.  The creamed spinach were bland and lacked seasoning.  The mashed potatoes were dense and bland.  Normally, it would not have been that big of a deal since the meat would have made up for it.  At Ruth's Chris the meat does not come with any sides so they are ordered separately at $10 per side dish.  At the price for the sides, I expect a spectacular dish cooked to perfection which in Ruth's Chris' case, it was not.  It may be possible that the sides were frozen and reheated, acceptable if included with the meal, but at $10 per item, no thanks.\n\nThe service from our server was good enough.  He forgot to enter an order for the scalloped potatoes and he made sure we were not charged for it.  If the spinach and mashed potatoes were any indication, perhaps he did us a favor.\n\nIn short, at the price range Ruth's Chris charges, the dining experience should have been exceptional.  Instead it left something to be desired after.  I don't mind paying for quality going by the old saying, 'you get what you pay for', but in this case one couldn't help feeling a little bit taken advantage of.", "author": "Jay C."}

My fiance and I went here for our anniversary, and for a two person dinner this is what our bill looked like, not including tip or valet services:  \n\n$236.00 for a two person dinner.\nThis included:\n1 appetizer\n2 cocktails \n2 salads\n2 steaks (one petite, the least expensive)\n2 glasses of wine (with dinner)\n1 side of sauteed mushrooms\n1 baked potato \n2 coffees\n\nAnd they comped us dessert. Which was great and we appreciated. \nService was great.  The meal was above average.  Just be aware that if you are interested in having a basic dinner like the two of us did, including tip you're going to spend about $250.00 at least.  Valet is another $10 (again, without tip).\n\nAlso, they knew it was our anniversary date, yet seated us next to a very loud and raucous party of 8.  The place is big enough to group couples together for a romantic dinner, and house the larger louder parties in a designated area.\n\nAnyway, we had a great time enjoying each others company on our date.

This was my first time ever at this steak house and my boyfriend had been to another one of their locations.\n\nEven though I made an reservation through OpenTable for 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday night, we still had to wait about 30 mins. until our table was ready (MINUS 1 star). The bar area is a little cramped so it made waiting for our table a little annoying, not to mention we were starving!\n\nOnce we were seated, our server mentioned the chef specials offered that night but the boyfriend and I decided to both have the Ruth's Classic dinner ($40-49) which comes with a starter salad, an entree with a side, and dessert.\n\nWe ordered:\n-Steak House salad: just a basic, mixed salad; I chose creamy vinaigrette dressing. The salad was crisp and fresh.\n-Caesar salad: standard caesar salad and the boyfriend said it was fresh.\n-Filet: I'm not sure what size filet I ordered, since it didn't specify, but it had to be either an 8 or 10 oz. filet. It was so juicy and had tons of flavor! I had it prepared medium-rare and it was absolutely perfect.\n-Lobster tail and filet: the boyfriend said the lobster tail was amazing and was really juicy! He prefers it without the cheese on top but said that it was still great. He really enjoyed the filet too!\n-Creamed spinach: I really liked the creamed spinach but the boyfriend didn't care for it very much. It definitely was creamy, maybe a little too much, but I thought it was good.\n-Garlic Mashed potatoes: SO GOOD! The garlic flavor  was really subtle and the potatoes were buttery. Definitely the best side out of the two!\n\nFor dessert we had the chocolate symphony that came with the Ruth's Classic dinner but our server talked us into getting the New Orleans style bread pudding. I didn't really care for the chocolate symphony, which was a chocolate cake with fresh fruit, but I LOVED the bread pudding! The whiskey sauce was not overly sweet and you could taste hints of whiskey. The bread pudding was sweet and had tons of flavor. \n\nRuth's Chris definitely lived up to my expectations food-wise, everything was delicious, but the service could have been better.

A starter. Soup or salad. Entre. And a decedent dessert. It's kinda odd actually... Because if you opt for ordering a la carte, it cost so much more. But believe it or not there were plenty of people ordering a la cart. Portions are pretty generous and all the steaks are lathered in butter!!! Please do not skip the butter. Why would you!

They do have a \"seasonal menu\" selection for $ 40, which is very reasonable for the quality (I am usually out of season, so this option does not work for me), and they participate in the \"dine about town\" food frenzy\" (since I am not into frenzy's, I don't know what they provide for this option). I don't do DAT.\n\nPersonal favorites: \n\nRib-eye (medium rare) - perfection on a plate, prepared to a true medium rare.....tasty & tender. The Filet is my 2nd favorite, tender tender tender.\n\n1lb baked potatoe (don't want to know what chemicals are used to get that tater to 1lb), while never ever finish it... it is something to behold. \n\nCreamed spinach (not trying to be Popeye the sailor man) but this is a really tasty rendition of spinach which eliminates some of the guilt of having a \"creamed\" vegetable.

The steaks are perfectly seared, the potatoes were everything that they should be, but better and the chocolate cake was super chocolatey and made me wish every place that had chocolate cake was as good as Ruth's Chris. We also ordered an additional dessert of the Banana Cream Pie, which has beautifully done banana coins with a caramelized sugar crust.

And the steak itself stays the same, unlike some restaurants that give you a smaller portion. \n\nI got a pear salad, the signature filet, and chef's choice of dessert.  The pear salad was tangy and refreshing.  Not something I'd try again, but I can see some people would like it.  The signature filet was huge, but Ruth's Chris cooked it to medium well when I asked for medium.  Regardless, the steak was still yummy.  The dessert was a chocolate cake with berries and sweet cream.  Although a big fan of desserts of any kind, this was actually just ordinary for a eatery like this.  \n\nThe bf got a caesar salad, which had too much dressing in my opinion.  For entree, he got the rib-eye steak, which basically filled up the plate it was on.  As someone who loves steak and has a big appetite, he was not able to finish it.  \n\nHonestly, we were full after the salad and dreading the steak to arrive.  That's how big the portions were.\n\n- Service, 5 stars - \nService was very good.  We arrived 20 min late to our reservation and thought we had already lost our table, but they still managed to get us passed the line of walk-ins (i think?) and secured a table within 10 minutes after we arrived. \n\nThe waiter was very friendly in explaining the menu etc to us, as we were both baffled by the strange pricing of the entree-only versus the pre fixe. \n\n- Atmosphere 4 stars  - \nWe ran into 8+ groups around us, so the atmosphere was very lively.  It was my first time there so I wasn't sure how the atmosphere was supposed to be.  I thought the liveliness was acceptable, except the group next to us would try to talk over each other and I was not able to hold a normal-volume conversation with my boyfriend until they left.  \n\n- Price 5 stars - \nBecause of the pre fixe menu, it was actually much cheaper than I expected and I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who craves for some quality steak with a smaller budget.", "author": "Emily W."}

From the crab cakes and ahi tuna to the steak and lobster, i had no complaints whatsoever in terms of taste. As for presentation, it was a bit lackluster. It is an expensive restaurant to dine at, and i was expecting to see dishes that resemble something beautiful. Instead it was just a dead carcass on a plate. \n\nREALLY GOOD RESTAURANT! =D", "author": "Jerry C."}

Knowing how busy restaurants can be, I made a reservation days ahead. We arrived right on time, and were seated within 5 minutes. The smell of steak was intoxication, so we knew we came to the perfect place for steak and couldn't wait to get our hands on some :)\n\nOnce we sat down, bread / water / menu / wine / beer / soda all started coming in no time. Be sure to ask for the DAT menu if you are here for that, but there is a regular prix fixe menu as well - there are some good deals! The DAT set came with salad. The waitress took time to explain how the steak were aged and cooked. We ordered 3 different cuts of beef: petite filet, NY strip, and rib eye. Got the cream spinach and hash brown as sides as well.\n\nMinutes or so later, \"the steaks are here!\" They came out sizzling hot and smelling great!! As we cut into them, they were just perfectly cooked - tender and juicy and tastful and de-li-cious! The hash brown was awesome too! Salad and spinach... eh, I had better... Dessert was not bad though.\n\nFor the value we got, I'll definitely be back for another hunk of beef!", "author": "Lois W."}

Before I get to the food, here were some notable highlights of the evening:\n\n*We were there to celebrate my Mom and niece's birthdays.  When we arrived for our reservation, Ruth's had sprinkled little \"Happy Birthday\" confetti all over the table.  Cute.\n\n*During the course of our meal, one of the servers was passing by and stopped when he noticed that my niece's other grandmother's coat was falling off of her chair, and pulled it up for her.  \n\n*I can now say for certain that Steve Wozniak is fantastic at holding audiences captive.  Even when he's not talking on a stage.  He and a group of six were at the table next to us and for over an hour, all we heard was his voice.\n\n*Despite not having enough room in our bellies to even think about dessert from the menu, we ended up getting it anyway - gratis from Ruth's!  After advising that we weren't in overeating shape, Lena Joy our lovely server, brought out two plates for the birthday girls.  I still had none, but everyone else at the table enjoyed a trio of vanillla bean ice cream, custard with fresh berries, and a little chocolate-peanut butter cake with whipped cream and caramel drizzle.  With \"Happy Birthday\" cursively written on the plates' rims.  They were both tickled :-)\n\n------------------------------------  Now, onto the food...\n\n*Veal chop, medium rare\n*Petit filet with shrimp, medium well\n*Lobster bisque\n*Hash browns\n*Steak house salad\n*Spicy shrimp over mashed potatoes\n*Loaded baked potato\n*Winter vegetable soup w/ chorizo (SotD)\n\nEveryone was extremely pleased with their meals, while I was just pleased.  I felt like my veal chop was under-seasoned, even though perfectly cooked.  The balsamic reduction onions were also very well cooked and added nice flavor to the chop, but when I didn't add them to a forkful of meat, I just didn't get enough flavor from the meat on its own.  I chose the veal chop because it's not a cut that I normally get.  I'll try it again and see what I get.\n\nThe hash browns arrived as a cake!  Finely shredded potatoes in a crispy, puffy cake as big as the plate, loaded with cheese, bacon, onions, and a touch of creme.  So yummy.  Perfect for a carbfest, if you're ever looking for one.  \n\nThe dining room is quite loud and it was difficult to hear over the table, especially for my 69-year old mother and 82-year old companion.  But this place is really great.", "author": "Tamar D."}

When we walked to our table, it took me minutes to figure out the rose petals scattered across the table top was for our special occassion. Several of the wait staff even wished us a happy anniversary. So sweet! \n  \nWe looked over the menu and noticed their 39.95/49.95 special dinner menu that includes a starter, entree, a side dish and dessert. Since the bf wanted a ribeye, this was the best deal since the ribeye a la carte was $42. House salad and creamed spinach rounded out his meal, and I had the petite filet.\n\nWe also ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms - yum! I got a little creative and squeezed some lemon on top (the lemon pieces came with my ice tea). Lemon and seafood is always a great tasting combo!\nI have to admit that the house salad is nothing spectacular, but their creamed spinach is one of my favorites. It has more texture than others I've had, and you can actually taste the spinach rather than a pureed creamy mess. \n \nOur meats soon came out, each on a 500-degree plate, sizzling in butter, and simply decorated with a few sprinkles of chopped parsley. But the diminished presentation did not compromise the flavors at all. Cooked medium-rare, my filet was nothing less than outstanding. I had a bite of the ribeye and the meat just melted in my mouth. I think the bf loved his meat more than me, but just for a moment. \n\nThe special dinner meal came with a dessert duo, carrot cake and a chocolate (espresso?) mousse.  Instead of just adding a candle on top of the carrot cake and calling it a night, the waiter insisted we order another dessert, on the house. Wow! So my sweet tooth and I didn't hesitate. My bf allows me to have free range when it comes to desserts since he's not much of a sweets person and he's just in it for the ride. So I opened up the dessert menu and found heaven, also known as Chocolate Explosion - devil's food cake with chocolate center and vanilla ice cream. We decided to share (yes, I can share chocolate and ice cream!) this one at the table and take the other desserts to go. Simple and delicious. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place for your special occasion.", "author": "Kimberly S."}

From the moment you step in through the doors -  the game is on. For my birthday last week - we had been wanting a nice out and felt that a visit to Ruth's Chris was a perfect opportunity. We arrived and once we let the host know we would be two not four, were seated right on time. The staff that night was plentiful welcomed us immediately. Once our over forty eyes adjusted to the lighting  - of course we didnt have our readers with us - thank god for apps!  We had to tackle the options for the night. We opted to share and appetizer and salad so went with the Sizzling crab cakes. The flavor of these were pretty out of sight - bug pieces of crab and jsut enough mix - my only comment was while well worth the price in taste - I did feel they were slightly smaller than I expected.  Next up was the Ruth chopped salad - since we were sharing it was served table side and slit for us. A nice touch and the perfect balance of textures and flavors. . For our entrees - we both went with filets  - I took mine straight up and he went with the blue cheese crust. For sides we weren't going to miss the sweet potato dish (neither should you with its crunchy topping!), the grilled tomatoes and a baked potato with all the fixen's. Each was well prepared and fit the tastes for our night. \n\nOver all the food was a 9/10 with the exception of the size issue I mentioned earlier. The only  item of note for the night was the speed in which we were served. The kitchen or the servers might not have been in sync - for a celebratory night - I felt that we were somewhat rushed. each course was served before the others had even been finished.  The bus staff were great that night making sure we were well attended - but our server seemed underwelmed and somewhat bored with himself - with each course not once was it noticed how fast the food was coming out - even after I joked about not having either the app or the salad by the time the meats were served.

We did this 4 years ago and decided it worked out so well that we made a go of it again. I made reservations on line and unfortunately the only time available was 6:30 which isn't too bad. We were running late and I called in to let them know I was behind schedule. We got there at 7:00PM and the hostess was very nice about the tardiness and we only had to wait a few minutes before they prepared us a nice table.\nParking was good since it was Sunday (no meters) and I parked about 100 yards away from the restaurant on Van Ness St. \nWe ordered appetizers of the prawns (4 per order) with spicy cocktail sauce ($19,00) and two orders of the stuffed mushrooms with crab. Both appetizers were well presented and very tasty.\nThey bring out hot baked bread which is really good.\nMy entree was the 16 oz rib-eye  ($46.00) served with steak butter and comes out sizzling hot. The wife had the stuffed chicken ($26.00), the daughter had the petite fillet and the son had the crab cakes. We also ordered sides of steamed broccoli, mashed potatoes and mushrooms.\nThe wait was a little long for the meal but it was well worth the wait.\nWe shared a single order of the chocolate decadence dessert  which is warm chocolate cake with hot chocolate inside and vanilla ice cream on top which is really good. I don't know if this is a new dessert item on the menu but it's really terrific.\nThe server, Jeremy, was great along with all the staff. Very efficient and not overbearing.\nThe entire bill without tip came out to $300.00 and it helped that I had a $100.00 gift card that eased the pain a little bit.\nHighly recommended.", "author": "jack d."}

We're big fans of steakhouses and have in the past had decent experiences at other Ruth's Chris locations.  The food was fine, however the waiter wasn't around very much and didn't provide much guidance on the wine menu.\n\nThe real problem really came towards the end of the meal.  I had given my credit card to the waiter ahead of the meal because I wanteld to \"win\" the who gets the privilege of treating the group debate that happens often at the end of meals with close friends and family.  When the bill came, my friend brother and sister, naturally, argued that they wanted to chip in, a friendly way.  \n\nJosh, one of the managers on duty, overheard our debate and without a moment to hear us out or any sort of understanding of the situation called us outside in the hall and started  telling us in a very rude and confrontational manner that we were disturbing other guests .  I explained that we were just having a debate about who got to take whom out and that by calling us out in this manner he was treating us like children and ruining our dining experience.  He was not understanding, in fact he blew up, making several derogartory remarks to us, suggesting he didn't need people like us in his restaurant, and then suggested we leave the restaurant immediately, without even a chance to review our bill.  It was humiliating.  I was shocked at his overreaction, his remarks, his temper, and felt singled out and very disrespected as a customer and person. \n\nOne of the other managers came out to us later and said she was sorry for what had happened.  We asked that Josh come out to apologize, she refused, although did take my name and number and said a GM would call us.  No GM called us.  My friend went the next day to express our concern and asked for an apology for being humiliated.  Josh refused.  I am not sure why the management team at this location is trying to ruin things for the rest of the Ruth's Chris franchise by promoting an environment of intolerance.  \n\nI'd ask that other customers consider this experience when deciding where to enjoy a steak dinner with their loved ones, and take their business elsewhere until the management of this restaurant can ensure a safe and respectful experience for all people.", "author": "Nikhil S."}

I am consistently satisfied with the food quality and service. On my most recent night out indulging in some delicious buttery steak, a very upsetting incident took place....\nWhile my friends and I were dining, the guests at the table nearby us stacked their wine glasses on top of the lit candle on the table. Now, maybe I am a stick in the mud, but in no way do I find that entertaining or  funny. When those glasses fall and shatter, isn't that glass going to be in MY food and wine? I mean think about it... how inconsiderate!!!! Well, I do appreciate that the manager PROMPTLY fixed the situation and politely asked the guests to disassemble the tower of wine glasses. Props to him for being present on the floor and being proactive in order to take care of all of the guests in the dining room.  Well, apparently these 4 guests weren't done making problems for RCSH....just a few moments later they started yelling at the TOP OF THEIR LUNGS....\"NO ME YOU MOTHER F***ER!!!!\" to each other in what seemed to be a dispute over the bill?? I mean once again, do these people have no care about anyone around them???? Or have any self respect?? I mean they were crazy loud, cursing and totally inappropriate. And, once again the manager was there super, super fast, asking them to please be respectful of the other guests. When they didn't and continued to make more of a commotion, he requested that he assist these guests to settle the bill out in the hallway, rather than make a huge scene in the middle of the dining room (all of us at our table as well as other tables around us stopped eating and were staring at this point.)  These guys went NUTS. They were swearing, threatening the manager and being crazy loud and disrespectful. We were right next to the hallway so we could hear/see EVERYTHING. After a few minutes of holding his ground and enduring this verbal abuse, the manager calmly asked these guests to leave and escorted them out. My overall feeling about the whole event is respect and appreciation towards RCSH, and in particular the manager, Josh (the guests kept asking and asking for his name!!). It proved that they are not tolerant of misbehavior in the dining room and want ALL of their guests to enjoy their experience. That's key to running a successful business...and of course the incredible steaks!!!!  Thanks Ruth's Chris and keep up the good work!!", "author": "El M."}

I got the day and time I wanted (important, because this was my fiance's birthday).\n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, I was reminded of the steakhouses I grew up eating at in Chicago (a city that has the steakhouse genre DOWN). I didn't know until we were seated that Ruth's Chris is a chain. Because it's so lovely and cozy in there, this only bugged me a teeny-tiny bit.\n\nThe host was responsive, though he had to sort out a couple of reservations. We only waited for a few minutes and then he got us on our way. \n\nCute surprise: I'd said on the online reservation that this was my guy's birthday and on our table there was a sprinkling of \"Happy Birthday\" confetti. Somehow it wasn't gauche, just sweet.\n\nOur server was fantastic. She checked on us often, but didn't hang around TOO much if you know what I mean. It was a very romantic evening.\n\nDOWN TO THE FOOD!\n\nI had the spinach/walnut/some-kind-of-dried-fruit-with cheese Official Salad of San Francisco. Can't lie, it was not good. The spinach leaves were bruised and limp.\n\nBut the steak...O M G. I had the small filet, rare (of course). I'm not kidding, it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. That 2,000 degree oven was a good move for this spot. So juicy and flavorfull, and perfectly seared on the outside, red inside. EXACTLY how I ordered it (it's kind-of amazing how many places in SF don't know \"rare\" from \"medium\").\n\nWe ordered creamed spinach, mushrooms and mashed potatoes for our sides. They are SINFUL I tell you. Delicious.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the little chocolate cheesecakes. They added a little scoop of ice cream and put a birthday candle on my finance's. And the server winked to him and said, \"Don't worry, we're not going to sing.\" The cheesecakes were RICH and neither of us could finish ours we were so full. \n\nNext time I go to Ruth's Chris I'm going to skip the appetizer/salad and just go straight in for the steak.

Oh Yelp, how you failed me. All the reviews are 4-stars so I thought it must be good.\n\nTheir wine selection is fabulous, their dining staff superb, the dessert was amazing! But the actual meal, not good! I'm sorry, but when I am practically selling my first born to pay for a steak, I expect that steak to be PERFECT. There is a lot of pomp and circumstance at Ruth's. They tell you how they flash broil their steaks at 1100 degrees and then serve it on a 500 degree plate; how the meat is such amazing quality they don't even need to season it with anything more than a dash of salt and pepper.  I wish that were true.\n\nWhen ordering our steaks the waitress claimed that they are served on the rare side so I felt confident ordering my filet mignon medium-rare. When I got my steak it was mostly medium and tasted over-done. The sides weren't that great either. I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes, which were bland and practically blended, at first I thought that they were out of a box. The corn-bread side thing was way too sweet and had the consistency of grits. My mom and boyfriend were smart and got the sauteed mushrooms, which are kind of hard to screw up.\n\nSo if the food was so bad, why the three stars? Well, like I said earlier, the wine selection is decent and each wine that the staff recommended was actually very good. The service is amazing. Your water glass is never empty and they time bringing out the food really well. And last, but most importantly, the dessert was fabulous! Each of us got a different dessert and each one was better than the last. My favorite was the creme brulee, it was perfectly caramelized and came with fresh fruit on top.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-08", "description": "Came here last night with a party of 5 for SF Dine About Town. They actually have their own prix fixe menu as well, that range from $39.95 to $45.95 I think for a 3-course meal, which is a great way to try this place without breaking the bank.\n\nFor the first course, I ordered the corn and crab chowder. I couldn't taste the crab, but for a corn chowder, it was thick, creamy, and comforting. A little salty though. \n\nI ordered off their prix fixe menu and got the 6 oz. filet + shrimp for the main course, which may look small at first glance, but really filled me up. The first bite of that steak - wow! It was hot, juicy, and tender, just as advertised. They cook the steaks at 1000+ degrees before placing it on a 500 degree plate with butter on the bottom AND on top, seasoned with some salt, pepper and an herb that I can't remember at the moment... but it was perfect. They've obviously got the seasoning and cooking down. I have to say though, once it cooled down a bit, it wasn't as \"best-steak-I've-ever-had\" tasting, and was actually almost a little dry, but still very good. But the shrimp! SO good. A little spicy, every bite was flavor explosion. Entrees come with choice of side, and the garlic mashed potatoes were, well, just mashed potatoes. Nothing special, except for the fact that I could see the butter/oil surrounding the potatoes, but that could be taken 2 ways -- extra decadent or extra fat... you choose.\n\nFor dessert, the duo symphony - carrot cake + chocolate mousse with fruit in a cream sauce (tasted like fancy condensed milk). Nothing spectacular, but the fruit was obviously fresh.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I finally can say I've been to Ruth's Chris, but I doubt I'll be returning. While the steak was probably one of, if not the, best I've had, the rest of the meal just wasn't that impressive. The price, I'd say, is for the steak and the ambience. Great place to take a date if you're trying to impress, but I think that you can find a better meal (meaning, all courses are equally delicious) for the same price elsewhere.", "author": "Kathy L."}

We were seated a bit after 7 and immediately given water and bread. Ooh, a whipping butter. Ryan, our amazing waiter(!!!) gave us 10 minutes or so to look over the menu while he got us drinks. I HIGHLY recommend the strawberry basil gimlet. After answering our questions (and suggesting the hash browns over the mashed potatoes, which was the absolute right decision) we ordered the following\n\nCalamari appetizer\nCeasar salad\nPorterhouse for 2\nHashbrowns \"loaded\"\n\nThe calamari was good. The sauce they toss it in is sweet with a bit of a bite, but I think it would be better if they served it on the side. It does tend to make the calamari soggy after a bit.\n\nCeasar salad was nothing to write home about. Standard faire. I, personally, would have ordered the tomato salad. But the bf and I were splitting it and he hates tomatoes.\n\nI did my yelp research and read about the scalding hot plates they bring your steak out on...which continues to cook it. Ryan assured us that they chefs cook the steak just under whatever you order, so that when on the plate; it cooks to the appropriate wellness. I was skeptical...i HATE when my steak is overcooked. But, we trusted Ryan and ordered medium rare. And it was perfect. Through out the whole meal. The porterhouse consists of two sides...the \"strip\" side and the \"filet\" side. I could have done without the strip side after tasting the filet side. Hands down, the BEST filet i've ever tasted. Soft and buttery...it was like biting into the fluffiest meat pillow ever. If I go back, i'll know not to waste my time on any other cut.\n\nThe hashbrowns. Oh the hashbrowns. When Ryan said we wouldnt be disappointed, he was f*****g right. Imagine the most perfect round pancake of crispy golden brown hash browns. Then top that with cheddar cheese, bacon and sweet sauteed onions. I was incredibly full from the steak, but could not stop eating this orb of deliciousness.\n\nMy boyfriend had mentioned it was my birthday, so there was happy birthday confetti all over our table (they sprinkle rose petals on the table if its your anniversary btw) Ryan, the sweet guy he is, purchased me a dessert. I was absolutely stuffed, so i got the chocolate cake. I hate chocolate, so I made my boyfriend eat it. I did eat the vanilla ice cream on top though...also, delectable.\n\nAll in all, this place was delicious!

I noticed it was very stringy with tendons and fat. About 15% of my meat was stringy tendons/membrane whatever you call it. The creamed spinach is not all that. It tasted bland and HOPR beats it hands down. \n\nWe also ordered a side of mashed potatoes. It tasted normal but for $9 I expected something more special. We also had a regular salad.

If you guys don't know what the Vesper is, it's a martini coined by Ian Fleming's \"Casino Royal\" novel and displayed in the 007 film, \"Quantum of Solace\".\n\nI am a huge 007 nerd, therefore I had it, it's dry with a hint of sweetness, not too much for a man's palatte, but not a typical vodka/gin martini. I don't even drink martini's because I always thought they were for old dudes and British Secret Service, but I had a couple of these and they were fantastic.\n\nThe food was great too, the Dine About Town brought a lot of new faces to this place. It's a bit stuffy in here, close proximity seating, quiet atmosphere, no music, as well as it being dark, to suggest that you shouldn't be too loud.\n\nA proper ribeye steak should have a seared crust on the outside from the skillet, and then either grilled or high heat on the stovetop to get your meat up to temperature. The best steaks I've ever had were unassuming with a charred layer on the outside, but once you get that first fork of meat, before you even taste it, you'll know what the deal is. Sorry to sound incredibly pretentious, but I'm kinda on a roll here. Anyway, it checked all the right boxes, it was incredibly luxurious and enjoyable from start to end at Ruth's Chris.\n\nThe cuts of meat sit on a bed of butter, I don't personally agree with this choice, but clearly it must be a recipe that works. Tis a bit salty for me taste parts, but overall the dinner was great, food was just good.\n\nI don't really have anything negative to say about the ambience, obviously it works for some, but we're sort of 20-something yuppies trying to have a good night in the city in a relaxing manner, parts of it worked for us, parts of it made us feel a little away from home.", "author": "Christopher T."}

Since I was alone, I opted to sit in the bar area. Big mistake!! It was 6:15p on a Wednesday, so the restaurant wasn't in full-on dinner mode yet. There were patrons about the restaurant, but it was mostly empty. There were about five people at the bar and other gentleman in the lounge area. Ok...scene set.\n\nI was seated at a table by the window and took a look at menu. Once I had decided what I wanted for dinner, I waited for someone to serve me. And I waited, and waited, and waited. After waiting for some time, I went back to the host Alex, to let him know that I was still waiting for someone to take my order. I wasn't sure if there was a server or if the bartenders served the lounge. Many apologies were said and Alex let one of the bartenders...who I saw helping the other gentleman in the lounge...know I needed service. I don't remember the bartender's name, but he had a bald head. Excuse #1...Alex tells me the bartenders they didn't know I was there. Huh? They didn't see me walk in with the you? And on the flip side, you being the host didn't let the bartenders know that someone was seated in the lounge??\n\nSo, cocktail order and dinner order have been placed. I step away to go wash my hands and return to see that three more patrons have come to sit in the lounge area. I overhear one of the ladies say she wants to order a Strawberry Basil Gimlet, which happens to be the same drink I ordered a few minutes before. Then I notice that the bartender that took my order first brings the gimlet to the other woman. He then comes over to my table with bread and tells me my drink will be right up. Huh? Didn't I order my drink first? And right up was about five minutes later. \n\nMy dinner arrives and was fabulous as always. The bartender comes to clear the table and I request a dessert menu. In the mean time, a few more patrons have come into the lounge and there is now a server on duty, which for some reason seems to ignore me. I figure it may be a territorial thing, since he hadn't been waiting on me to begin with. So I get his attention to ask if he could take my dessert order even though the bartender waited on me. He writes down my order and says he will let the bartender know what I want.\n\nDessert comes and is a winner. But the poor service really left a bad taste in my mouth and the tip I left reflected that. As I was leaving, I mentioned to the host Alex about the poor service. Excuse #2...one of the other servers/ bartenders called in sick, but they are usually pretty good servers otherwise. I would have bought that excuse if I would have received a \"sorry to keep you waiting\" at anytime during the time I was there. But everyone acted as their service was status quo.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning to Ruth's anytime soon. If I do, I will make it a point to be seated in the main dining room as I have done in the past. Next stop, Morton's.", "author": "Dana W."}

We got complimentary calamari, seared ahi tuna, veal ravioli, and crispy lobster bites. The lobster bites were my favorite - the meat was plentiful and the sauce was very tangy. So even though we had to wait, I think the service during our meal more than made up for it. (I am a sucker for free food).\n\nMain meal: Salad was just salad, but my entree of petite filet and shrimp was amaaaaazing. Yeah yeah everyone is hating because of butter but hey...the butter is delicious! The meat is so juicy and tender and the jumbo shrimp was equally tasty. I usually hate steak because I hate having to chew for long periods of time; the meat gets all dry an gross in my mouth. Ruth's Chris steak stays moist and flavorful. Creamed spinach was okay and I was too stuffed for the chocolate cupcake dessert but the appetizers + entree already made my day. I definitely recommend this place for a romantic date or birthday celebration. The DAT is a great deal too!", "author": "Joyce H."}

We were more so celebrating the fact that no one had thrown themselves off the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nI was a bit hesitant about coming to Ruth's Chris solely on the fact that my friend Nguyen once came here for a Christmas dinner and had a horrible experience. Something about a hour wait for cold steak, only to be full off of stale bread by the time food came out. Blah. I was hoping that my experience would be much better but that definitely wasn't the case. \n\nI was a bit disappointed when I found out there didn't have prime rib, so I settled for the petit fillet with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. I like my steaks medium rare where it's still pink it the middle but it came out well done. (C'MON now, your a steakhouse, you should know how to cook a piece of meat) The creamed spinach and potatoes came out cold, nothing to rave about. The service was just so so, you had to practically raise your hand and keep it up to get some service. I seriously thought we were back in lecture again. \n\nWe all gave the classmate that suggested to come here hell all night long. I would never come back here, I'd walk down the street to House of Prime Rib if I was looking for good food.", "author": "Ha N."}

I was having a hard time picking out where I wanted to do until my dad suggested a steakhouse. I took them up on this offer. And boy did I agree with him.\n\nThis place is a classical steakhouse - not like Sizzler or Golden Corral. They treat everyone like a first class citizen. Their cuts of beef are probably the best I've ever had. The service is great. The wine and cocktail list is pretty through. \n\nI have their classics menu, their interpretation of a prix fixe menu. To start off, a Caesar salad. The main course was a 6oz filet and a 1/2 Maine lobster. The steak was perfect, tender and it didn't need A1. I'm a firm believer good steaks don't need steak sauce. The lobster was decadent. To finish off, a peanut butter panna cotta and homemade chocolate truffles finish off the meal. It was rich and unique - I've never had peanut butter in a panna cotta. To accompany the meal, a bottle of Syrah was split 5 ways. \n\nNow this place is expensive - I saw my mom drop $500 here yesterday. But it's as close to perfection as I've seen. This is definitely a once in a while indulgence. And it's surprisingly kid friendly too. We had two rugrats with us, they did their best accommodating them but the kids were begging to leave. And I saw a few babies here. Isn't this supposed to be a classy steakhouse? But still, I walked away impressed, while my mom walked away $500 lighter.", "author": "Navi T."}

I don't usually order prawns or shrimp while out and about since they are so easily overcooked and become tough, but happily that was not at all the case here!!!\nWe also shared the surf 'n' turf rib eye and lobster tails which was by far, the best and most flavorful steak I have ever had! (And I am a home chef whose husband is the definition of a 'meat and potatoes guy') The tails were also cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. \nThe sides ordered; Potatoes Au gratin and asparagus with hollandaise were also scrumptious. The potatoes slightly aldente, were prepared the proper way as to avoid soggy, mashed texture. \nThis is an upscale, romantic experience that you won't want to miss out on! Not the place to go if you're looking for a diner quality, well done, sirloin served with A1 while watching the game. \nOverall an incredible meal was set over the top by the friendly, personable, professional and knowledgeable staff.  \nYou absolutely made our anniversary dining experience one that will be raved about for years to come!

He calls me Friday and asks me what I thought about Ruth Chris.... ummm, expensive and the City were what came to mind. Was not really on my radar to try, to be honest. \n\nAnyway, no amount of trying to be logical was going to dissuade Hubby from his meat quest. Not the traffic that I warned him about (but still complained about), not the lights on Van Ness (which I also warned him about that, we couldn't avoid) and so on... \n\nOkay, overall: \n\n- Service - 5 stars - Salvatore was great \n\n- Meat (Cowboy Steak and Filet Mignon) - 4 Stars - what they tell you is that the meat is cooked in a 1800 degree grill, but keep in mind that it's not a flame broiler, so you will not get that char or any type of markings that add a boost to flavor. They are excellent cuts of meat, truly, but the preparation really doesn't inspire you to keep eating. \n\n- Spinach & Pear Salad - 1 Star - the salad was drenched in this dressing that I just couldn't figure out - it wasn't a raspberry dressing, so maybe cranberry? It made my salad inedible, and I love spinach and pear salad. I don't know why the pear would be sour too. \n\n- Shrimp cocktail - 4 stars - our daughter loved it even tho she wasn't feeling well. \n\nSo, this w/a $120 bottle of Caymus was about $285 - expensive way to learn, but at least we can say we tried it, right?\n\nOh, just a quick comment on the atmosphere - felt very cliche. A lot of people we saw coming in, as we left, felt more like they were there to impress someone and were ready for a night out.

I've tried both the Filet and Rib-Eye, and they were certainly a good meal - but I've had far better steaks even at more casual places like Cattlemen's, which serves Harris Ranch beef. And yes, melted butter on a steak is pretty awesome, but I'd also say that an outstandingly aged piece of meat needs nothing else but to be cooked to perfection.\n\nService: 4/5 - Professional and friendly, but nothing memorable or super personable. Pretty good about coming around but it still has service that feels like what you might expect from a big chain. \n\nAmbiance: 4/5 - Typical steakhouse feel, a tad bit more modern than the old-school steakhouses though. It does attract some casual diners/tourists being that it is a chain, so it feels a tiny bit more casual - or at least acceptable to walk in underdressed. \n\nValue: 1/5 - I know it's not necessarily a fair comparison, but considering that the House of Prime Rib down the street offers a full meal for the same price or less than a single steak here ($40s and in some cases ~$50), this is in my opinion a rip. Add to that the fact that you need order salad, potatoes, vegetables, sides, for nearly $10 each, and you're spending a ton of money unless you're doing DAT, or ordering the cheapest steak and nothing else. And yes, I know steak does not = prime rib, but a rib eye here is pretty much the same meat as down the street. Also the potatoes, veggies, and salads are basically the same type of thing.", "author": "Kevin T."}

The hostess was nice and gracious enough, and we were able to sit almost immediately despite being late to our reservation. \n\nI ordered the Mixed greens; petite filet; mashed potatoes; and the berries with sweet cream and chocolate mousse in a chocolate shell duo. The salad is forgettable enough, and unfortunately I did not really like the steak. It was cooked medium-rare, the way I wanted to, but something about all that butter melting in the dish was a little unappetizing to me. I don't think it was very necessary, and made my steak extremely salty in the end. Also, the way in which they bring it out (sizzling in the dish, with warnings to exercise caution due to heat) was too much flair for me. The butter splashed on me and all over the table, and I was left wondering whether or not that was a little touristy. I did not care too much for the chocolate mousse (I was there for steak, after all), but the berries in sweet cream was a delightful surprise. It would not be enough for me to return, though.\n\nOverall, the service was \"Meh Ok\"- our waiters paid less attention but I think it may have to do with the whole \"Dine About Town\" brush-off, since the table next to us who went off the regular menu had significantly better treatment.

At least during my time spent there.. the next day however upon reflection, I have to wonder why even knowing just how bad it is for me I still ate it lol.\n\nAnyhow, I came here on a weeknight and the place was pretty empty 'cept for a few other tables that had a couple people at them. Where the crowd that gives 500 reviews was, I dunno. Safe to say on weeknights tho, you won't need a rez. \n\nThis Ruth's Chris had a less open feel to it and felt more like private dining. The dining room(s) were off to the back and removed from the bar area. While I liked this, I kinda didn't like not seeing the staff as much as I usually do. Still our server was very attentive. \n\nThe food:\n\nLobster Bisque: one of my *have to order* things when I come here. Yummy :)\n\nFilet W/Gorgonzola: Very tasty! And yes, I put cheese on a steak that was already riding the sizzling butter plate.. not like it was going to make it any more unhealthy! I asked for it seared and seared is what I got, very red and juicy.\n\nFilet W/Stuffed Lobster Tail: I tried the lobster tail and it was \"eh\". I'm not a big fan of seafood stuffing in general. It all taste like a crab cake to me and I don't find crab cakes to be anything amazing.\n\nMy daughters Filet: LOL, it was huge! They must have given her the manly, mans cut! \n\nHash Browns: In my own opinion I can sum these up with the word \"EW\". They were way too greasy.. yeah, yeah I know \"it's Ruth's Chris, what did you expect??\". But this was grease overload. I didn't like the way they looked but still tried a spoonful of them. They were like a greasier version of Denny's hash browns. Nothing special and I don't get why our server raved about them. \n\nShoestring Fries: They're fries.. just fries.

Six birthdays later, one day came (totally not his fault - it's all me). \n\nMy birthday fell on a Tuesday this year, so reservations were a snap. We were quickly seated and had a long discussion over the menu. Our server, Ryan, was helpful, friendly, and personable. I felt like he loved everything about the restaurant and was excited about the food, which in turn got me excited about the food. The BF gets so happy hearing the sizzle of the plates. With Ryan's help, we decided we wanted to do the deal of salad, entree, and dessert, with extra sides. Here's what we ordered:\n\n- Seared Ahi Tuna - LOVE. This is a definite must get if you're into raw seafood. So flavorful. It seriously just melts in your mouth like butter. I think I've said that in past reviews on other things but this definitely fits the description. \n\n- Sizzlin Blue Crab Cakes - Nothing but pure, delicious crab. In the size of a small cake substantial cake. So much substance. So much crab. Yummy.\n\n- Caesar Salad - Mine. I don't eat salad but it came with the deal so why not? Typical Caesar salad with tons of cheese but it was huge! I ate a third of it, yet it looked like I didn't even touch it. \n\n- Steak House Salad - His. He said it was okay, but that my salad tasted better. \n\n- Petite Filet with Shrimp - Mine. Shrimp and beef was cooked perfectly. Beef was tasty, but I felt that it was a little too salty for me. Side of creamed spinach for me. Yum.\n\n- Ribeye - His. I liked his more. Tender and flavor was on point. Side of mashed for him. Perfect.\n\n- Molten Chocolate cake - Mine. Came with a candle, compliments of Ryan. It was totally delicious, but I wish it had more ice cream cus it was so chocolatey and thick. And after a meal like that, I couldn't finish my cake. Sad face. But I would've taken a couple of more bites if there was more ice cream.\n\n- Raspberry Sorbet - His. He loves raspberry and he loves sorbet. Win win for him.\n\nOh and the other thing that I absolutely LOVED (other than the apps, haha) was my drink: Fresh Berry Martini. Blueberry + vanilla vodka goodness. So smooth and yummy. It was perfect. I would've definitely ordered another one. I should've ordered another one. I'll order it when we come back...when one day comes around again (:", "author": "Sandy L."}

I've been here more than 10 times on meetings, dates, and just to hang out with friends, (I had a glowing review for this location in the past, in 2008) but I will never go to this location again. The complete lack of respect the staff had for us during our trip was simply appalling, and their complete disregard of my opinions made me realize that the owners of this chain do not care about their customers in the least. It's really sad how far this place has fallen.\n\nThey absolutely don't care about how they're reviewed, we told them since we'd been treated so poorly, we'd leave a negative review on yelp, and the manager told us they \"could not care less about what someone says on yelp\" about them. I guess they think that when you're a chain restaurant you can afford not to care about your customers.\n\nIf they choose not to serve paying customers with dignity and respect, we will not bring our service to them.

I thought the waitress was adding mood lighting to my table, and it turns out it was butter in a bowl with a tea light underneath it to keep it warm.\n\nThe $35 DAT dinner menu at Ruth's is a great bang for your buck. 12 ounce rib eye, a side, a salad, and a dessert (to share between 2). I loved the butter soaked steak and the butter soaked mashed potatoes. My attempts to be healthy were futile as the creamed spinach was not only soaked in heavy cream, but also.. butter, ofcourse. Come to think of it, I bet the Chocolate Sin Cake was made of butter too. It LOOKS like a cake, but it tastes like a truffle (e.g. 90% butter, 10% chocolate). \n\nIt would've easily been a 4 had I not had to cut out 4 ounces of fat from my 12 ounce steak.", "author": "Jess C."}

Yummmm...\n\n1st course: Salad with balsamic vinaigrette - this is okay... nothing special about this salad... just spring mix salad with dressing...\n\n2nd course: 8 ounce petite filet with a side of mash potatoes - this is a really good steak but I asked for a Medium Rare and it turned into a Medium Well Steak... I think it's because they had the plate heated up with a lake of butter on it (pretty darn fatty... ask for little or no butter if you are not used to this)... it sizzles on the plate upon arrival!!! This is what Ruth Chris is known for! Unfortunately, it keeps cooking while it's on their way out to our table... If you want a Medium Rare steak at Ruth Chris... make sure you ask for Rare... it will probably be perfect by the time it gets to you! My piece of steak was still pretty tender at this point! *two thumbs up* and it was pretty tasty! Mashed potatoes was buttery and creamy! Yummy in the tummy!\n\n3rd course: Ruth's Symphony - this is okay... Chocolate mousse inside of a chocolate shell and it was paired up with a yogurt-like dessert with berries on top... it was a great pair because it kind of balanced out the sweetness from the rich chocolate but I bet it would be great for true chocolate lovers....\n\nOverall, I thought this was a great dining experience.

She was of Asian decent and was working between the time of 5-5:30pm on Friday the 18th. We arrive to the restaurant about ten minutes early to our 5:30 reservation for our 5 year anniversary dinner and we checked in and politely asked her where the restrooms were. She told us that she will show us to the restrooms once we are seated to our table. That was fine so we sat down and patiently waited UNTIL a group of 4 older people came in who were ALSO early for their reservations, (we are 20 and 21 years old). They were talking about how they needed to use the restrooms and the hostess immediately showed them where it was and sat them down at their table BEFORE us. My boyfriend and I were very upset because this was the one little problem we had on our very special day. She made us feel like we weren't getting the service that we had expected from a Ruth's Chris Steak house as paying customers simply because of our age. It was very appalling coming from such a great restaurant. Hostess aside, the dinner was great and the rose petals on the table and surprise dessert at the end was simply icing on the cake.

He was so friendly and over-the-top helpful. A bit too enthusiastic, but it made the dining experience 100x's better after our 40 minute wait (even with reservations) on a Thursday night. \n\nI made reservations for 7:45pm with my boyfriend for Dine About Town. Got there around 7:35 and was told they were 10-15 minutes behind schedule. Ended up being 40 minutes until we got seated. Once our grumpy selves got to our table, we were greeted by our waiter and our frowns turned upside down. He asked if it was our first time dining here. I told him I've had it in San DIego, but my boyfriend has never been so our waiter went and gave us the gist of Ruth Chris. USDA approved corn-fed beef from the top 2% of America, yadayadayada, 500degree plate don't touch, yadayada. \n\nWe initially went there for the Dine About Town special going on this month, but we glanced over that menu and decided to go with the Ruth's Classic menu which was their version of a prix fixe menu.\n\nBUTTER. This whole place is about how wonderfully fluffy and light their whipped butter is. Butter on the bread, butter on the steak, butter on the mashed potatoes (which is already loaded with butter). I cannot get over how amazing their butter is. I can sit there with my loaf of bread and just have butter the entire night. FATTY STATUS, but shit. Once a year? I'll take all of it.\n\nAppetizers: \n- Seafood gumbo - It was good, nothing special about it. I wish there were bigger chunks of andouille sausages in it. The soup had shredded chicken and a hint of crab meat or something...?\n- Steak salad - No steak in it. It's just called a steak salad for some reason, but it was full of arugala. I haaaate arugala!  Why did I order it? I needed some greens for a healthy diet.\n\nEntrees:\n- Filet Mignon & Shrimp - I ordered a 6oz filet and a side of 3 cajun shrimps on the side. Nothing special about the shrimps. The filet was amazingly juicy and tender. WAY TENDER. And of course, I plopped on more butter onto my already-buttered-steak. De-effin-licious. \n- Ribeye: Definitely meaty. Not just the size of the ribeye, but the taste was purely beef. If you like steak for its flavor, go with ribeye. Leave the tenderness to the filet. \n\nTIP: Both my boyfriend and I had the chefs prepare our steaks in between a medium rare and medium. If it was a tad on the bloody side, just let it sit on your scorching hot plate and it will continue to pink to the way you'll like it.\n\n\nSides: \n- Sauteed mushrooms - Literally just 5 pieces of mushrooms sitting in a soup. Tasted like how mushrooms should taste. \n- Potato Au Gratin - I remember this being better when I dined in SD. I guess I was so overloaded on the butter that the creaminess of the au gratin was a bit too much for me to handle.\n\nDessert:\n- Creme Brulee - A classic. The top is yummy. The rest of yummy. Can't go wrong with that.\n- Bread pudding - I kinda liked it and I kinda didn't. It was a large portion. Big enough to share, even among 3-4 people. Warning: The sauce taste straight up like Jack Daniels. Brought the rest to go.\n\n\nFor all this, the bill was only $125 (tip included). Definitely a steal for this amazing gourmet meal. :)", "author": "Rosanne L."}

So here it is folks: STAY AWAY FROM THE BUTTER! Also, I found that getting a porterhouse was a little better (my second time, not at the same location) than a regular steak on your own plate because the plate is so hot, if you order medium rare, it becomes medium pretty quickly at the end of the meal and then you kind of lose what you paid for.\n\nI am not recommending this place only because it's not fantastic steak and the San Francisco location is terrible, you HAVE to valet!

My friend arrived almost 20 mins early, and asked to be seated first. The hostess made them wait and said the reservation is for 6:30 so just wait. It's odd since there are empty tables open. This happened right after my bf was telling me about how they have negative reviews on wait time even when people make reservations. They were seated right before we arrive, so it was 6:30 prompt. It was rather empty considering it's D.A.T. and a Sunday.\nThey also offer 3/4 course set menus at 39.99 or 49.99, the food was not very expensive. Not sure why the four $ signs, more like three to me. Our meal was a bit more pricy since we added on additionals and had a bottle of wine.\nMy bf and I both got the petite filet D.A.T. menu, and added on a crab cake for an additional $14. The filet was not bad, but nothing spectacular like some people raved about. Maybe if this was years ago I would have been ecstatic over the steak, but as time and my wallet has progressed over the years, so has my taste buds. Don't get me wrong, I like some chili cheese fries from fatburger or nations, and I can chow down on in-n-out & McDonalds, but when it comes to fine dining or higher end dining, I expect a little more.\nBread was warm, and it tasted ok, it actually tasted better the next day, I ate about 1/2 loaf sitting at my desk!

When I saw the mashed potatoes come out I tried to move my plate to make room. BURNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN! OUCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

I ordered the Ruth's Chris classic menu option which came with a starter, entree and dessert.\n\nStarter: Spinach and pear salad- it was ok tasting. The dressing reminded me of some cheap bottled dressing. The pears were really soft so I gently placed them on the side.\n\nEntree: Ribeye done Med-Rare...Let's just say I got a whole spectrum of steak. On the  left side the steak was blue! The cow was still practically mooing. On the right side I had medium well steak. Besides the temperate being off the steak itself was horribly tough. I really did not taste like I spent 40 dollars for this steak. Another problem I faced was that the steak was served on \"the surface of the sun\" kinda plate. It was super hot the waiter stated that it was approximately 500 degrees. What it did was continue to cook my steak. So by the end of the night I was eating chewy shoe leather.\n\nDessert: With the Ruth's Chris classic came a standard chocolate cheesecake and berries. The cheesecake was really tart and lacked much needed sugar. The cheesecake was like a combination of chocolate mousse and cheesecake. The texture was all wrong. The berries did not make sense with the dish they just sat to a side, the dish was not cohesive.\n\n\nCocktail: The worst part of the meal was the cocktail. It tasted like cough syrup.

The Ruth's Chris way - fried in butter - ensures the steak is juicy and tasty.\n\nIn addition to steak, we got the potatoes au gratin and the creamed spinach.

This was the second time dining here and we were very disappointed. We have dined at a couple of other Ruth Chris steakhouses and had positive experiences, but for whatever reason this location does not seem to have the same standards.\n\nFor an appetizer we had the crab cakes. I love crab cakes and usually order them when they are on the menu. These were meh at best, soggy with nothing else on the plate. For dinner we had the porterhouse for two, asparagus, and a baked potato. The steak was cooked properly and somewhat tender, but for the cost it should have been better then what I can cook at home when purchasing from Costco, and it wasn't. The asparagus what very bland. The potato, what can I say? It was a baked potato. The highlight of the meal was the coconut ginger lemon drop, maybe we should have just drank our dinner? The service was some of the worst for an upscale/pricey dinner that we have had. The server seemed nervous and uncomfortable, and in my opinion would have fit better in your local Denny's. Our water ran out on two occasions and we had to ask for more. For a cheaper meal this might not have been a big deal, but we definitely did not feel we got what we paid for, not even close", "author": "Nate H."}

Their steaks are flash cooked in a ridiculously hot oven (~800 degrees i think?) and are brought out on the plate they were cooked on (so the plate is ~500 degrees or so). They are swimming in butter and if you get your steak rare enough, the blood that comes out gets cooked on the plate  :P (sounds gross, but its not really.) My steak was cooked at a perfect med rare (which I was happy about...I tend to order rare just because most places cook med rare wrong, but they did a good job here). Unfortunately my friend eating with me got his steak cooked med well, when he ordered med rare :\\ \n\nSo my meal consisted of the rib eye, a salad, a side (either creamed spinach or mashed potatoes), and bread pudding for dessert. Again, all of this was for 31.95, which is less than the steak alone would cost on their usual menu. The salad and sides were pretty good, but def nothing to rave about, nothing too special there. I think the rib eye cut was smaller than their usual cut (because of the dine about town menu). Still, I was stuffed by the end of the meal.\n\nOverall, a good steak, but I wasn't blown away. Because of the price, I probably would only come back during dine about town the next time it happens. So, four stars for the dine about town menu (a good meal for a good price), three stars otherwise.\n\nP.S.

I've been waiting to try this place out since I was a youngster and today was my lucky day.\n\nOnce you go in, dark. I should have expected the ambiance be all high end and stuff (idk why I expected it to be casual like Outback steakhouse;;). Super dim, romantic, sophisticated, blah blah atmosphere. After being greeted, we were seated immediately. BAM! I open the menu and all I saw was $$$$. Time for some $40+ rib eye steak. We were wondering if it came with any sides like veggies and what not but it did not. Our server kindly suggested we get the set menu which has a choice of rib eye (along with other stuff that didn't catch my interest like petrale sole =p. Why you order fish in a freaking steakhouse??), an appetizer, and a set dessert. I believe one of the set menus is around $49.\n\nI had the rib eye, medium rare with creamed spinach and the watermelon summer salad while my co-worker had the rib eye, medium rare also with string beans and garlic and the steak house salad.\n\nWatermelon salad: Really good! There were four big ol' perfectly cubed watermelons with some spring mix, bleu or feta cheese I don't remember, almonds, onions etc. The watermelon was really sweet too so that being said I was already expecting the steak to be phenomenal. My co-worker commented his salad being good as well but I couldn't make out what was in it because A) the lighting was too dim to see and B) I was too busy making out with my delicious salad.\n\nRib eye: Served on what our server said 500 degree plates and that the rib eyes were cooked in a specialized 1000+ degree oven. Saywutwutwut?? First bite... I had to stop. Just seasoned with salt, pepper, and parsley? There has to be some secret to make it taste THAT flipping good. I savored that first bite for a good five minutes. Our steaks were indeed medium rare, juicy, and had nice distribution of fat. Also, it is freaking HUGE. I saved/boxed half so I could make room for dessert.\n\nCreamed spinach: Nice compliment to the steak. Seasoned well with salt and pepper.\n\nString beans w/ garlic: Very nice as well. The beans were cooked perfectly as they were not overdone/mushy and not raw/quickly blanched. It was tender but also had the crisp and snap! that you're supposed to get when you eat these kinda beans. It was also flavored with butter and garlic well, not too overwhelming.\n\nDessert: I don't even remember what it was to be honest haha; Some sponge-like cake except more dense with flavored whip cream and strawberries. It was so-so. Not too sweet which is what I like. I was honestly too busy thinking about when I'm going to come here for the ribeye again huhuhu!", "author": "KD M."}

Fresh warm bread was pleasing with butter spread. Salad with balsamic vinaigrette set the bar for an excellent meal that was about to be served.

Nothing special like half the reviews said but also not bad like the other half claimed.  The steak itself was OK.  I can't quite figure out what was wrong with it, it just didn't feel very juicy, which was weird because it was not overcooked and it was swimming in butter.  I love butter on my steak and it tasted great when it just came out, but because the plates are 500 degrees, it melts really fast and I think goes from creamy to greasy which really put me off.  \n\nOverall, service was great but the steak (which is what we came there for) was slightly disappointing.  Maybe it was the cut, so don't fully take my word for it.

While on Open table yesterday, I clicked and booked a 5:30 pm reservation (maybe, open table is a better way to go?!). After giving my car to the valet and checking in at the hostess stand, we waited about ten minutes for our table. We were one of maybe a handful of parties either dining or waiting for their tables. After seating us in a booth, our hostess gave us the regular menus and wine list... I'm thinking, uh oh... maybe Dine About isn't in effect on weekends. Our waiter, Jessie, then handed us the special menus (whew...) and I explained them to my parents. Discussing what a nice deal this was, my dad and I did not hold back in ordering the following: \n\nAppetizers \n\nSteak House salad with Vinaigrette - fresh non-iceberg lettuce with a few halved cherry tomatoes and croutons; small portions, but good enough \n*** part of Dine About \n\nFrench Onion Soup - small crock of soup with yummy, gooey cheese baked on top; the broth was flavored well (not too salty), but the cheese had a burnt aftertaste though it was barely browned.. very odd. - $9.50 \n\nEntrees \n\n5 oz. Petite Filet Mignon - served on a \"500 degree plate\" (warning given when we ordered, do not touch); this was very tender and perfect for my teeth sensitive parents. \n\n12 oz. Rib eye - hearty steak flavor, ordered medium rare, but came close to medium/medium well \n\nSupplement \n\n5 oz. Lobster tail - grilled Caribbean lobster with decent flavor, but a little on the dry side - $17.00 \n\nSides \n\nCreamed spinach - similar to House of Prime Rib's version, but a little thicker \n\nMashed potatoes - did I mention, this place loves butter? That was the dominant flavor. \n\nPotato Au Gratin - potato slices mixed in a creamy, cheesy sauce; okay with me, but dad liked it. - $9.50 \n\nDesserts \n\nKey Lime Pie - decent sized slice topped with whipped cream, lime slice and raspberry sauce on the plate for dipping. \n\nNew Orleans Bread Pudding - think of a heated raisin snail with wine sauce. \n\n*** choices of one of either side dishes and either desserts \n\nIn extrapolating the bill, the Dine About price came to $34.95 per three course menu. Considering the Petite Filet is normally $35.00 ala carte, this is a great deal. As we left, I noticed that it was a mixed crowd of locals, families, couples, and tourists. It's a little more stuffy than House of Prime Rib, but it is a more relaxed atmosphere for eating; service was good as they kept our tea pots, iced tea, and ice water glasses filled.

Oh em gee, I really enjoyed that martini. It had a sugar rimmed glass, which I love.\n\nIn addition to the filet and lobster, we ordered brussels sprouts and hash browns as sides. The sprouts were to die for! They were in a brownish buttery caramelized sauce and were accompanied by bits of bacon. The hash browns were like meh, they didn't really match the meal but it's what the dude wanted.\n\nThe lobster... was totally meh. I'm not sure what happened here. Maybe it was a little overcooked? Don't get the lobster! It was edible, but disappointing.\n\nThe filet mignon was definitely the star of the show. Buttery and flavorful. My man's rib eye was good, but the filet mignon was the bee's knees. If you're coming here, do yourself a favor and get the filet. I wish I had forgone the lobster and just gotten a fat piece of filet mignon.\n\nTopped it off with a delicious creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with berries. Yum!\n\nThe service was pretty good, but I was a little disappointed that they weren't doing anything special for people for Valentine's.

Our love can never ring true, yet my heart would breaketh without you...\n\nOkay, enough of that. After a particularly awful experience with a dentist here in SF (I don't wanna blow up his spot on Yelp, but I URGE you to send me a message if you're planning on having oral surgery) and not eating solid food for almost a month, I wanted to go someplace REALLY special for dinner. As you know, I am a red meat fanatic, so my brain automatically defaults 1st to Espetus and then 2nd to House of Prime Rib for a special evening out here in The City. However, at this point I could barely finish a Peanut Butter Moo'd my stomach had shrank so much, so Espetus was definitely out. I tried to score a reso on Open Table for HoPR, but was about as successful as my Islanders have been this year, so we tried walking in. At 7:30pm. On a Friday night. During Christmas Party season. You already know how this ends...\n\nSo we headed south on Van Ness and came upon Ruth's Chris. Now, I can't lie, the wife & I have had some really memorable meals here, even though they are a dreaded \"chain\". The joint was really empty, plus they had a sign on the window offering Ruth's \"Classics\" menu for $39.95 per person. Unfortunately, our prior experiences with R.C.'s price-fixe menus had been very negative, and we felt like we were always treated like 2nd class citizens for ordering off the \"discount\" menu. But, we decided \"f*ck it\" and decided to throw caution to the wind and walk-in.\n\nWe were seated promptly at the bar, which was fine by us as we've ridden more than a few barstools in our day. I ordered the Filet Mignon (note: there is  a $10 upcharge) while wifey went with the 6oz. Petit Filet & Shrimp. Our AWESOME waiter, Jose, didn't even flinch when I asked him if we could replace the dessert on our price-fixe dinner with a 2nd side, saying \"Sure, go right ahead!\" like we were the 1,000th person to ask. So me & the boss lady both opted for the garlic-mashed potatoes & the brussels sprouts with bacon. Both meals came with a soup or salad starter and a loaf of fresh-baked bread with creamery butter. The  lady opted for the seafood gumbo while I went with the classic steakhouse salad. Both were excellent, and the bartender made a MEAN Manhattan. But you're wondering \"Where's the beef?\" so I'll skip right on over to dinner.\n\nThe filets were perfectly cooked to a medium-rare, with a warm pink center and a slight, crusty char on the outside. My filet was a 10oz cut easy, and so melted in my mouth that my uber-sensitive chompers didn't even have to show up for work. The mashed potatoes were buttery perfection, and the divine Brussels Sprouts were glazed with real Maple Syrup and topped with so much bacon that you would have thought there was an army of pigs tearing up the kitchen. Of course, we ordered the bread pudding with whiskey sauce for dessert, which was absolutely awesome, as always!!!\n\nMore than anything else though, Jose made sure we had an awesome time and that we were taken care of as a couple of peasants just as much as the guy trying to impress his date with surf & turf and Duckhorn Merlot was at the bar. For that, we had yet another truly memorable evening at Ruth's Chris. Who cares if they're a chain, they're 'effin awesome!", "author": "Michael T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-05", "description": "This rating was very tough for me to decide between 3 and 4 stars.  The reasons I decided on 3 stars are as follows:\n\n-The steak was not as good as it probably should have been.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good borderline great steak, however I don't think people come here for a good to borderline steak.  I think people come here expecting an exceptional steak.\n\n-The steak was over-priced.  I didn't feel the steak was far superior to say Outback, Black Angus, Cattlemens, or any other chain steak house.  I am convinced that if any of those aforementioned steak houses laid their steaks on a bed of butter and served on a super hot plate the steaks would be near identical.\n\n-An 8:45 reservation for two, didn't have us seated until after 9:05.  Yes, we were on time, in fact we arrived an hour early and had some drinks at the bar.\n\n-The drinks were overpriced.  $7.50 for a bottled Stella Artois beer is a little much, as was the $10 for a glass of Llai Llai Pinot Noir (basically a 15 dollar bottle of wine at a store).\n\nSome positives:  The steak was cooked as ordered.  This is something that I don't find very reliable in the Outback's of the world.  I prefer my steak Med-Rare.  This is exactly how it came, if I had gone to Outback or the like I always order Medium because the tend to not do Med-rare correctly. \n\nThe staff at all levels (bartenders, hosts, wait staff, bus staff) was very courteous and attentive.\n\nThe restaurant was laid out nicely and there was enough space so you weren't on top of another party, or having to listen to anyone else's conversation.\n\nOverall I just feel like the value was not returned for the cost paid.  I would much rather spend either much less by going to Outback or the like, or even better spend $10-15 more (per steak) by going to Alexander's and having an exceptional steak.", "author": "Kevin K."}

Our waiter went over the menu and our options - oh what to eat - STEAK!\n\nTo start we had the barbecued shrimp and the Ahi Tuna.  \n\n- The Ahi Tuna - absolutely fabulous!  The tuna was fresh, seared perfectly on the outside and just a gorgeous cut.  The spiciness on the sear was just right - you got the hit but still tasted the fresh luxurious Tuna.\n\n- The barbecued shrimp - I think they brought us the wrong dish.  It tasted like shrimp in a butter sauce.  Still good - but not what we were expecting - you couldn't call this barbecue and serve this in Texas and walk out alive.  But overall good - the shrimp were fresh - the dish just didn't have the polish or flavor the Ahi Tuna had.\n\nThe main event:  STEAK\n\nThat's the whole point of going to Ruth's Chris right?  \n\nWe each ordered a filet - two medium rare and one butterflied and well done.\n\nOH PERFECTION!!!  \n\nI sliced that baby open and she was soft as butter, the temperature, texture, and flavor all PERFECT.\n\nFor sides we had one of those humongous baked potates, the sweet potatoe casserole with pecan crust, and hashed browns.\n\n- baked potatoe - huge - done right.\n\n- the hashed browns - wow they should warn you the servings are about the size you would get at grandma's house.  But it hit the spot.\n\n- THE STAR - sweet potatoe with a pecan crust.  Oh deliciousness personfied.\n\nFor dessert we all shared the molten chocolate cake.  Very very nice.\n\nWhy not 5 stars?\n\n- first they brought us the wrong shrimp dish.  If it was the right dish there is no way it should be called barbecued shrimp.\n\n- second - they didn't bring a steak knife for my girlfriend - I waved, whistled, waved a towel - got ignored.  It was only when the manager came by to ask how our dinner was that we were able to get a steak knife.\n\n- finally - we couldn't finish everything - as a matter of fact there was a lot to take home.  Before we could say anything the busser came by and just pulled everything off the table and it was gone.  No take home - so sad. so sad.\n\nOverall I recommend for those who love steaks and enjoy really good food.\n\nDefinitely a good value for the price.", "author": "JP O."}

I gave Flemings SD only 4 stars and that place was flawless.\n\nOur meal was good but a couple negative points really hurt the experience:\n\n1)  Tables were way too crowded together.  This is a steakhouse, not a French bistro.  I dont want to know my neighbor.\n\n2)  My rib eye tasted good overall but had sinew running through a portion of it which was near impossible to cut through (with my high end butter knife they use as steak knives) or chew through.  Mentioned it to our somewhat \"canned\" server but  he passed it off as the type of cut.  Not.\n\nHad a rib eye at Cheesecake Factory in Minne and it was amazing.  Barely any fat and no sinew.  I dont mind a bit of chew in a steak but the rib eye and Ruth Chris was a bit much.  Maybe they save the poor cuts of meat for Dine About Towners..lol.\n\n3)  And whats up with the butter??  I mean I know why they use it but I didnt order a butter steak.  If they have to add fat to a steak to make it taste good is it really a good cut of meat to begin with?  I want to taste the meat and seasoning instead.\n\nPositives:\n\nRebekah's filet mignon looked amazing, mashed potato sides were great, general atmosphere was good.\n\n** Flemings has a very similar approach to cooking their steaks but no butter lake around the steak, decor is steakhouse but modern, more relaxed?, service is professional but naturally friendly.\n\nSticking to Flemings......SD.", "author": "Laine D."}

We had the petit fillet and the rib eye. Everything came cooked as ordered, with a juicy center and perfect grilled outside. The meat tasted delicious and concordant with the cut, served in really hot plates (no kidding! food was sizzling) and a bed of melted butter. So delicious!!\nThe sides were tasty, somehow heavy, but we were having that kind of food so that was OK. A pretty decent list of wines completed the picture. Also the desserts were chocolaty and well crafted.\nIn sum a place to come back! One good thing we involuntary did was to reserve at 5:45 (the other available slot was at 8:30).

The pinnacle in fine steak house dining achieved. This provided by the fantastic Ruth's Chris Steak House.\n\nThe night started off with a quality made cocktail from their classic style bar. The drink, an Old Fashion made with 12 year Jameson and extra bitters. We were led to our table where within minutes of being seated we were greeted by our waiter. He proceeded to inform us about the special \"Dine about Town\" event menu that was taking place at many upscale San Francisco restaurants. A very knowledgeable fellow indeed, he provided us with all the information about the quality of food and preparation that took place in every meal served at this house. \n\nDuring this event, Ruth's Chris offered a 4 course meal for a set price. It started with their house salad, a simple spring mix and cheery tomato combination drizzled with a tasty vinaigrette. Next came the main course. I chose the 8 ounce petite fillet, cooked at 1800\u00b0 and brought to the table on 500\u00b0 plates sizzling in butter. That little bit of technical information brought to you by our wonderful server.\n\nYes the plate was hot, I touched it, and yes the steak was unbelievable, I tasted it! Perfectly cooked, medium well on the outside and medium on the inside due to the thickness of the fillet, I have never had better in that cut. I also chose the creamed spinach as my side, which was great, but I wish I ordered the mashed potatoes as did other at our table, they were amazing.\n\nThe dinner concluded with dessert. A selection of fresh seasonal berries in a sweet cream sauce and a chocolate mousse in a dark chocolate shell. Both simply divine. \n\nEverything here from the decor and ambiance, to the food and service, reeked of refinement.

Lucky for me, the steaks were not disappointing even with all the hype!\n\nFood: \nThe dine about town menu was a preset menu that had: \n1) Salad: Steak House Salad with balsamic vinaigrette - this salad was ok, nothing too great about it. The balsamic vinaigrette was a little too thick if you ask me, but overall, a salad is a salad, so nothing too spectacular about it. \n2) 8oz Petite Filet - DELICIOUS!!! The meaty/beefy aroma of the steak preceded its arrival and made me drool a little. And when it actually came out on a sizzling plate, it was AMAZING!! The beef was so tender and just melted in your mouth. The meaty juice was still perfectly infused inside the filet. I'm drooling just thinking about it! \n3) Side: Mashed Potatoes or Creamed Spinach - Mashed potatoes were ok. The creamed spinach was also nothing to rave about. Just some typical sides to go with the AWESOME filet!\n4) Pudding with chocolate cupcake: This dessert was interesting. The chocolate cupcake was pretty tasty when you dipped it into the yellow pudding. Great presentation of the dessert!\n\nService: \nExcellent service! Very professional and tended to your every need. The only thing was the food kinda took a long time to come out, but that's ok, it was worth the wait. \n\nAmbiance: \nRitzy, upscale steak house feel to it. I think this would be a great place for an upscale date if you wanna impress them. The room lights are kinda dim and gives a very romantic feel about the place. The noise level is moderate so the date can still stay pretty casual. \n\nPrice: \nIf it wasn't the dine about town price, I think I would have had to pay an arm and a leg for this meal. I would say that the steaks are worth chopping an arm off to pay for it, but everything else might be only worth a finger or two. \n\nOverall: I think the steak was definitely worth it but everything else was ok. Nothing too great about it. The filet really carried the meal into the 4 stars range or else I would have just given this place 3 stars.", "author": "Amiee H."}

But at 9 & 8 $$$ each for the sides not worth it.  $11 per glass of wine was ok as i have no problem spending a couple hundred bucks for a good bottle of wine.  But this is a steak house and I wanted a good steak.  :(. So sad.   Ordered their cowboy,  rare. Came back medium and self cooking. Barely pink in the middle and turning grey fast.  Good beef is good even medium but not this and i sent it back..  $50 for steak should be better then what you get at ponderosa .  They were quick at getting a new one out and cooked properly, but it was still disappointing,  Ate a few bites looking for a delicious bite of steak was so disappointed. Ieft most of it. Which I rarely do even if its breakfast of steak and eggs at a cony island.   Perhaps other cuts will pass but not the cowboy.  I've had much better at places charging 1/2. And much much better places charging as much.  I won't eat here again unless all I want is a good glass of wine and a ok side", "author": "Robert L."}

There are only a few locations in Canada and none in my hometown, so I decided to come here for dinner, especially since they're running one of their Ruth's classics promos currently and there's 3 course menus for $39.95 or $49.95 depending on what entree you choose.\n\nI went with the $39.95 option and had a caesar salad, 6oz filet with shrimp and the symphony selection for dessert with included berries in cream and chocolate mousse in a chocolate shell.  Hubby had the $49.95 version since he wanted the11 oz filet, but he had the same salad and dessert as me.\n\nService was pretty good.  Their wine list is okay but limited if you only want to order by the glass.\n\nSalad was pretty good with crisp greens and nice parmesan chunks.  The steaks are nicely served on hot plates so your meal stays warm.  But for a steak place, they're not good at differenting the state of doneness!  I had a medium rare that was more well done than my hubby, who ordered a medium-medium well!  The steaks are literally sitting in butter, so it may be a bit greasy for some.  Flavor wasn't bad.  The peppercorn sauce on the side was quite nice (additional $3).\n\nThe sides were also okay - no complaints about the mashed potatoes or mushrooms.  Desserts were also okay.\n\nThe big thing that bothered me was inconsistency with the medium rare to medium well that shouldn't happen at a place where steak is their claim to fame.\n\nAt the price we paid, it was a great deal.

I'd rather come here in a group versus as a couple. It's obvious, the bigger the group the bigger the tables- but it's also the more space you get between tables too. \n\nTrue story, came in with my now fiance, and we were seated so close to the next couple that throughout the meal we ended up trying each others appetizers and conversing through the whole meal! Yes, so close to the other party it was no longer an intimate setting. No complaints tho, I'm just glad the other couple was so nice. \n\nThe appetizers that were shared amongst strangers (haha) was the calamari, tempura onion rings, and the mushrooms stuffed with crab meat. Both quite good, but typical in taste- the calamari had a nice, Asian dipping sauce. \n\nI had a perfect medium done, petite filet along with a juicy, lobster tail with a side of my favorite here- the Au Gratin; thinly sliced potatoes in a creamy, cheesy flavorful sauce. The asparagus and hollaindaise sauce was perfect- make sure to ask for the sauce on the side, it's better that way. \n\nI can't remember what my fiance had, I just know he was suckered into choosing hash browns as his side! I forgot their name for it, but the way the waiter described it was as potatoes prepared in a clarified butter and seasoned lightly. He fell for it and what we got was a plate of hash browns fried in clarified butter! The leftovers were great the next morning, with my eggs and \"clarified buttered\" toast haha! \n\nFor dessert, I absolutely love their Caramelized Banana Cream Pie.

I got there early thinking I was going to sit at the bar and have a drink while I waited but instead they seated me right away. The ambiance of the place was elegant in a welcome home sort of way. Our waiter, David, was perfectly energetic without being overwhelming. His excitement for the place and food increased my anticipation for the meal. Being a noob to this steak house David broke down the meat, FDA prime, and how they cook it with mouth watering detail. The Ruth's Chris Classics are by far the best value but I got the cowboy steak and the sweat potato casserole. \n\nThe steak was perfectly cooked just the way I ordered it, medium rare, brought out on their 500 degree plate meant the meat was still sizzling. Mmmmmmm, the smell was steak-tastic. David was right, even though I ate my steak slow, savoring every bite, the plate kept it warm all the way to the end. If I was not in such a nice place I would have picked the bone up with my hands and gnawed the rest of the meat from it since the knife could not get ever last morsel off. Then I tried the sweat potato, let me say this should be on the dessert menu. They were sweat like candy without being oily or overly buttery, absolutely amazing. \n\nAll in all I recommend this place to those of us that love steak for the flavor of the meat itself.

My dad and I started with the crab-stuffed mushrooms, which were absolutely fabulous and highly recommended if you like crab at all. For the main course, I ordered the filet and my dad got the lambchops, we shared sides of the sweet potato casserole and plain steamed broccoli. My steak filet was cooked perfectly to medium-well, just how I like it and although my dad's lambchops were also good, they were too fatty for my liking. I love sweet potatoes to begin with, but the brown sugar and pecan topping on the casserole really pulled together the side and made it memorable. We finished our meal with the chocolate explosion, which was just a molten chocolate cake, good but nothing extraordinary. \n\nMy only gripe was that everything was swimming in butter. Both the appetizer and my filet were both soaking in a puddle of melted butter, and I could very evidently taste the buttery goodness in the sweet potato casserole as well. Granted, the immense amount of butter probably explains why the dishes were so decadent, but ideally my food wouldn't be drenched in fat. \n\nIt was a very satisfying meal, exactly what I would have expected for the price paid.

The set-menu came with a starter, the entree w/a side of your choice, and a dessert for $49.95. You can also \"upgrade\" your side to a full sized side or different side dish for $2 more. This is the same with the dessert - if you didn't like the dessert that it comes with, you can also change it for only $3 more extra a person. \n\nSo we decided to go with the set-menu. They also bring you a warm loaf of bread with butter. We started off with a Cesar salad and a Crab and Corn bisque. Both were really good. We both ordered the 16 oz rib-eye (which would have been $10 more for the DAT menu) and I got the side of saut\u00e9 mushrooms, and did an upgrade for scalloped potatoes. The steaks were cooked perfectly and had great flavor! Can't go wrong with steak cooked in butter! For dessert we both changed our dessert and got a creme brulee and a chocolate molten cake. The molten cake was not as good as some other places I've tried, but it was not bad. The creme brulee tho, was really good and light! \n\nOverall, had a fantastic streak experience! Service was great and very attentive. I really like how they have the set menu now, because it makes dining there really fun! Will def. come back!", "author": "Betty S."}

I truly felt like a welcomed guest who the waiter, Ryan, took joy in serving. Even when I announced I was a vegetarian, Ryan took it well with a sincere chuckle and was eager to show me my options. The tempura onion rings were the best I've ever had, the green beans were fantastic, and the potatoes au gratin (and my date's mashed potatoes) were to die for. Not to mention the bread, butter and drinks. The atmosphere was so classy, romantic and welcoming. It was one of the best dinners I've ever experienced!", "author": "Rebecca H."}

With a succulent lobster tail on the side of course.  Maybe I do like baked carmelized mashed sweet potatoes while holding the pecans please, and thank you very much.

All the other months out of the year where I'm holding the butter, I will spend at Ruth's Chris punishing my lobster tail in that little golden bowl of goodness.\n\nI've been there 3 times this year.  Once in March for a girl's dinner, 2 weeks ago for my cousin's graduation in Anaheim, and tonight for my birthday.

We found free street parking about two blocks from the restaurant.  We arrived at our reservation time and were seated within 2 minutes.  The ambiance was romantic, with dim lighting and a candle lamp on each table.\n\nThe complimentary white bread was amazing...warm, soft in the middle, and slightly crisp crust.  It was accompanied by whipped butter.  We usually don't eat much bread, but this bread was heavenly...we both ate four pieces :).\n\nThe house salad was good...fresh, but nothing spectacular.  Same with the sides - mashed potatoes and creamed spinach...meh.\n\nOur steaks (8 oz filets) came out on sizzling hot plates each topped with 1 tablespoon of butter.  They were cooked to a perfect medium-rare, as requested.  We had to blow on the first few bites before eating them as to not burn our tongues...it doesn't get any fresher than that.  The steaks melted in our mouths...tender, juicy, buttery...the way steaks should be!\n\nFor dessert, we were served vanilla ice cream with raspberry syrup along with chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting.  Both were yummy, but I especially loved the ice cream...it was flavorful and creamy with a touch of iciness.  A perfect way to end the meal :).", "author": "Christella T."}

BF always orders the cowboy ribeye which he orders medium rare and I always choose the Ruths Classic Filet or Petite Filet---Medium rare of course!  Sides are all great!  My faves are the Baked Potato and Creamed Spinach. But I have ordered most of their side dishes and all are so yummy!  Recently they have their new orleans mac n cheese---which comes with cheesy jalape\u00f1os!    Asparagus, mushrooms, Potatos Au Gratin is yummy!  Creme Brulee is also my fav here.  Customer service is always great.  There was probably about 1-2 x that service and food was not that great and when we said something, they comped our meal and even gave us $25 off the next time we dined again.

The bisque was super creamy, just like Craftsteak in Las Vegas.  The calamari comes prepared with a sweet pepper sauce that is sooooo flavorful.\n\nThe steak comes dipped in butter that makes the meat so tender and juicy, and of course the sides were perfectly matched with the meal esp the crispy hash browns.\n\nFinally,the banana cream pie was just outfuckingstanding........the top of the pie is carmelized like creme brulee and is filled with loads of banana creme filling and whipped cream.\n\nDuring the meal, both the GM and Manager came by my table and re-confirmed to me how wonderful their service is.\n\nA great meal...........so satisfying..........we left and went back home to do the nasty.....the perfect ending after a pefect meal.", "author": "Raider J."}

We got creamed spinach and potatoes as sides.\n\nMy medium rare steak was actually done medium rare, which came out delicious.  It was delicious at first, but started to get overly savory with each consecutive bite.  A lot of other steaks I've had doesn't do this...they get better after every bite...not saltier.  And no, salty does not equal good taste.  Although, the texture of the beef was so moist and delicious.  I'll give them that.  My friends that got the medium rare filet mignon actually had theres cooked well done.  I don't mean that the meat was cooked extraordinarily in a 'well done' sense, but that the meat was overcooked.  BOTH OF THEM.  I can understand if it's just one person, but both?  You just messed up twice.  I had a small slice cut of their filet mignon and it was so dry that the meat had this particular bad odor.  And the salt somehow makes it more dry.  Not a fan.\n\nThis place has the feel of fine dining without actually really being fine dining.  In the end, it's just an expensive steakhouse.  I've experienced better steak at Black Angus than here...but maybe you're paying for the ambiance...although this place had a few folks with jeans and a t shirt here.

First I must say: do not listen to any of the other reviews bashing the service - it was phenomenal!  Our server, Courtney, always seemed to be there right before we needed her, with a smile and helpful advice.  Ryan, Courtney's assistant, was extremely courteous and friendly, and didn't allow our water glasses to get less than half full . . . ever.\n\nNow, to acknowledge the food.  After reading other reviews, I'm wondering if we just happened to order the \"hit\" items.  But every single item was a hit (I guess, the only thing I could possibly mark the review down on was the salad - it was much smaller than expected and little lack luster.  That doesn't mean that it wasn't good, and who needs a huge salad when a pound of award-winning beef is coming your way?)\n\nI ordered a glass of the Don Miguel Gascon Argentinian Malbec, and he ordered the Mendocino Fog wines.  Although on the low-end of the wine list, both wines were incredibly smooth, and mine brought a smile to my face every time I took a sip.  The bread that accompanied the meal looked as though it was Safeway brand french bread, but after having some you realize that Ruth's Chris isn't messing around.  Even the bread was delicious, we had to have two loaves.\n\nAs I already mentioned, the Steak House Salad was the low point of the night. But it still wasn't bad, and it actually was the perfect size and lightness to precede what was to come.  It consisted of some mixed baby greens, a few sliced grape tomatos and garlic croutons, drizzled with vinaigrette dressing.\n\nFor the main, I ordered the 8 oz. Petite Filet, au poivre, medium rare, and he ordered the upgrade (+$10) 16 oz. Ribeye, medium rare.  First I must warn you, when you order \"medium rare\", you will get medium RARE.  I'm sure the masters in the kitchen know what they are doing, but it wasn't what I'm used to.  This all being said, it was probably the tastiest slice of beef I've had in yeaaarrs.  And the au poivre sauce was a delicious addition.  He ate the entire 16 ounces that was served, and even without any additional sauce, the meat still had a great flavor.\nWe both ordered the garlic mash as a side, which wasn't too garlicy, but was incredibly creamy and buttery, yum yum.\n\nThe Ruth's Symphony Duo dessert was nothing less than five stars.  I died every time I took a bite of the chocolate mousse.  And I'm not sure what the custard was in the other bowl, but it paired nicely with the rich chocolate mousse, especially with the amount of fruit that was in the custard.\n\nAll in all, a great experience. I highly recommend Ruth's Chris on Van Ness.", "author": "Emily L."}

Anytime they think of a favorite meal, a big hearty steak is what always comes to mind. So when they came to visit SF, I knew I had to take them to Ruth Chris.\n\nAfter making dinner reservations for 8ppl a few days prior, we arrived promptly at 7pm. Although we were heavily dressed down (3/8 people were teenagers), the wait staff didn't seem bias. They served us promptly with drinks and appetizers. \n\nAppetizers were: Calamari (crispy with pleasant spices), Stuffed Mushrooms with crab cakes (interesting earthy flavor with seafood but good nonetheless) and Lobster bisque soup (a little too tangy for my taste).\n\nFor entrees, we ordered: Lobster with petite fillet Mignon, 4 prime rib (shared between 5 people), butter chicken and halibut. I had ordered the lobster with steak and all I can remember was the steak's buttery heaven that melted into my mouth. The lobster complimented the steak very well, and we had sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus with hollandaise sauce (the sauce was was rated about 3/5; too \"buttery-tasting\" with not enough flavor). \n\nThe people who ate the prime ribs were satisfied and even my kid-cousin mentioned that the steak was comparable to the best steakhouse where she frequents in the Philippines (Antonio's in Tagaytay). (On a side-note: my family from the Philippines is big on dining and spare no expense; taste and experience are priority). \n\nFor dessert, we ordered two Chocolate Explosions (chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream), pecan pie and cheesecake. The pecan pie was your average pie with vanilla ice cream. The only difference was the caramel that decorated the plate. The lava cake was also OK; cousins mentioned that they've \"had better.\" But the cheesecake was very good. Something about the right combination of buttery sweetness that made it noteworthy (even better than some Cheesecake Factory cakes). \n\nOur final bill came out to about $550 (including tip). For that price, we were delightfully satisfied (the week prior, we ate at Slanted Door for $700). Overall, we all enjoyed the food and company.

The place was packed and the rib-eye I had was simply one of the very best and rivaled the Smith & Wollensky rib-eye I had in terms of quality and cost.\n\nIt took a LONG time to get through dinner. We started at 7:30 and left by almost 10:30 PM because of the rather slow service and big crowd.\n\nThe table potato sides were Mashed roasted garlic, Au Gratin, Shoestring and Lyonnaise. All were great except for the Lyonnaise which was more deep-fried and dry. The veggies were Sauted Mushrooms, French Fried Onion Rings [Terrific], Fresh Broccoli Au Gratin, Fresh Spinach, Creamed Spinach [WOW] and Fresh Asparagus With hollandaise.\n\nOverall I was glad I did it, though I'm not sure I would go there again by myself or my wife for dinner for the cost. The a la carte menu has always bothered me since you think you can assemble exactly your own dinner, but the premium that this costs is clearly a play for money rather than really adding quality or value to a meal.\n\nFor the money and the fun and great quality meats go to a Churrascaria (see my other reviews).", "author": "Glenn H."}

Ruth Chris's Steak House has the best steak in San Francisco and is definitely a place to savor and try over and over again; it is even better than the famed House of Prime Rib. Let me give you a tip on that cowboy ribeye. Get it medium rare, and get it charred. What is charred? charred is where they put a smoky, peppery layer on top of the cowboy ribeye after its been through the 1800 degree oven. In addition to the cowboy ribeye, definitely add a side -be it a type of potato or Ruth Chris' famous creme spinach (10$). I had the creme spinach side and it was plenty for two people. It was buttery in texture and went well with every few ribeye bites. As I waited in anticipation, I absorbed the warm atmosphere within this establishment. I would definitely suggest a Merlot wine to prepare your palette for the flavors to come. The steak came out sizzling on a hot plate. Once it was set, I sliced in. The first bite......PERFECT. It is exactly as I would imagine the perfect steak to taste. It was buttery in texture, crispy all around, tender as you bit in. You could really taste the entree. The char... magnificient (don't eat burned foods, but this exception may be worth it.) The steak was so good. My girlfriend got the Surf and Turf, Filet Mignon 8oz and Lobster. It was about 50$ more or less. The Filet Mignon was very different from the cowboy ribeye; it was much more tender. The Filet cut was much more tender than that of the ribeye, but that is not to say that one is superior to the other in taste. I feel that both were flavorful in their own respect. However if you want a cut of steak that's both buttery in texture AND bite then I would recommend the Filet cut. The lobster was tasty too, but trust me when I say, come here for the steaks. Overall Ruth's Chris Steak House was a pleasant memory for my quarter century full of tasty steaks and friendly waiters. 5 stars.\n\nwifive", "author": "simon k."}

Of all the steakhouse San Francisco has to offer, Ruth's Chris unfortunately doesn't make the top of the list and really isn't that impressive. The steaks were good at most, probably because of all the butter the steaks are sitting on.  For its price, (after wines, appetizers, the main course and sides, and desserts) I would much rather spend that money elsewhere. My first time at this location, I asked for my filet mignon to be medium rare. Note: I typically get my filet medium but wanted to try it medium rare. The steak came out a bit dry and overcooked and I was not impressed. My second time, I returned to the San Diego location on the waterfront and tried the same dish and it was cooked way better. So, I decided to return to this location again a few months later, and made sure to get my steak the way I wanted it to be cooked.", "author": "Katarina D."}

I thought it would be too late, but the timing was actually perfect because we had other to things to do that day.  We got there about 10 minutes to nine and there were still a lot of people coming in.  I think there were about 10 parties/couples waiting for their table (some without reservations but still came hoping to get a table..haha... suckers!)  We still waited about 15 minutes for our table and the bar was full so we just watched people eat and smelled the aroma of freshly grilled steaks that caused my stomach to grumble.... I was ready to eat!\n\nWe got seated in a corner booth which was nice, more intimate, and away from the noise.  We shared a Caesar salad and mushroom stuffed with crab meat to start off with.  The caesar salad was good but a little too heavy on the dressing.  The mushroom with crab meat was absolutely delicious and perfect choice for an appetizer.  I ordered the filet medium, and he ordered the New york medium rare with peppercorn sauce both paired with a glass of syrah.   Also ordered mashed potatoes on the side.  The steaks come out still sizzling on the plate.  My steak was a perfect medium, tender, and melt in your mouth MmmM..Mmmm good!  The side of mashed potatoes was creamy and a perfect accompaniment to the steak.  To end the meal we got a nice slice of cheesecake.  I was super full in the end and still had leftovers to take home.\n\nOur waiter was very nice and made very good recommendations.  The only negative I can think of was the bread.

I've never been to Ruth's Chris but I just had a feeling it wouldn't disappoint me. And since DAT is happening right now, I couldn't think of a better time to go. \n\nWe had a reservation at 8pm on Thursday night. Parking was a little tricky but all three cars in our party ended up finding a spot. The ambiance was very classy. It didn't look worn down like at House of Prime Rib. \n\nOur DAT menu started out with a simple salad. I wish they didn't skim on the first course because it was a flat, boring pile of greens. My second course was the 8 oz. Petite Filet and it came out SIZZLING hot on a plate of BUTTER. Need I say more!? It was so satisfyingly delicious. Sometimes you don't need any special sauces to make a steak great. But butter is always a good idea! Paula Deen, you were right. The side of creamed spinach was also very good. You actually taste the spinach in addition to cream. \n\nOur night ended with a chocolate mousse and a carrot cake. Some people liked the fried strings of carrot on top but I didn't. It tasted like French's Onions which is not a bad thing but I don't prefer it on my cake! The chocolate mousse was nice. I don't think Ruth's Chris can ever topple the king, his majesty, House of Prime Rib but I'd say it could definitely be a lord in his court. \n\nP.S. This was my first dining experience with Gail N.

We had a reservation for a party of 8 at 9pm (and arrived on time!), but still had to wait 15- 20 minutes for our table. \n\nI think it's a good steakhouse, but definitely not the best I've ever had. I tried the Lobster Bisque ($10) and it was \"so so.\" I actually didn't like it very much; it tasted as though some sort of baking/ pastry ingredient was in there. The bisque had a little too much starch and wasn't particularly enjoyable. On the upside, it had chunks of lobster in it.\n \nThe salads were tasty, but pretty standard. \n\nI don't normally like creamed spinach, and Ruth's Chris's version of the dish didn't change that any (or if anything only confirmed it). If you're into it, you may like it. I don't. The mashed potatoes were too overwhipped and gritty for my taste. I personally (not to toot my own horn) make a mean mash, so maybe I've set my standards too high for a side. \n\nThe steaks came SIZZLING. I had the ribeye, which was really fatty (I did not lke that at all), but it was good nonetheless. Apparently all the steaks come cooked in butter and for good measure, they throw another dollop of butter on there. You can order it without the dollup or with extra dollops. I think in the future, I'll order without- having my steak bathe in butter isn't exactly a preference of mine. \n\nFor desserts, we had the Key Lime Pie and the Bread Pudding made with Jack Daniels. Both were very good/ excellent and our waiter was even nice enough to bring us over some Vanilla Ice Cream :) to accompany our Bread Pudding. It was a very nice touch. :) \n\nFor wine, we ordered the 2005 Paradox, which was a Zin blend; it was actually a pretty good red to accompany our very meaty meals. We also had a 2004 Cabernet from V. Sattui as well. \n\nOverall, I'd come back to try out a few other dishes and if I had the choice again, I'd probably go with another cut of meat (the ribeye was too fatty-- about half my steak was fat, but it seemed to be only my own?-- I think a filet or lamb would do the trick next time around.

I felt sorry for people who went into the restaurant hoping to get seated without a reservation because they were all denied. \n\nOur course breakdown included the following:\n\nHouse Bread: Goodness gracious, it was absolutely delicious! It comes out nice and warm, and they give you whipped butter to spread all over the goodness. Definitely beats other steakhouses that I've been to. \n\nSteak House Salad: Although they titled it \"Steak House Salad\", there is no steak in the salad. ;) It was quite tasty with their balsamic dressing.\n\nMashed Potatoes: It didn't have the \"WOW\" factor. It tasted like typical mashed potatoes that I can get anywhere else.\n\nCreamed Spinach: Now this was pretty good. It probably could give you a heart attack from the amount of butter and oil they used to make it, but it was very tasty.\n\nPetit Filet Mignon: I ordered medium rare, and it was slightly overcooked for my liking. But it was so good with the blue cheese crust that I requested (additional $3 charge). Well worth it! And as always, my petit sat on a bunch of butter. :)\n\nRibeye Upgrade: The husband knew that a 6 oz. Petit was not going to fill him up, so DAT offered a 16 oz. ribeye upgrade for an additional $8. He's eaten a lot of ribeyes in his lifetime, and said that the best ones he's had so far were still at Alexander's Steakhouse in Cupertino and Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo. Good to know. He also wasn't used to the amount of butter they used on his steak.\n\nDessert: The chocolate mousse was pretty good, but the carrot cake was a little too carroty for me. \n\nService: Our server was great and was attentive.

So this 2 star review is probably my fault.\n\n I think that when a business has 167 locations, they develop a process of production. This is mass-produced fine dining, which means its really not as valuable as the hand-made equivalent. I'm not trying to be snotty, but honestly I could see the difference in the details, like our generic salad. The service was very polite - not helpful or engaging, but polite. I think even if this place was $10-20 a plate (the price I deem fair) it would still be far inferior to a lot of other SF eateries.\n\nThe food was decent. The salads were tiny, pre-made bag-o-lettuce mixes drizzled with very little generic dressing. No nuts, no fruit, just one tomato. Big minus points for that - a salad is not hard to do well.  C'mon.\n\nWe didn't order the steak because it was a non-organic, corn fed sirloin.  Our entr\u00e9es, salmon and roast chicken, were both pretty good. But at 50+ bucks a plate, you'd better make me crave more... in the biblical sense. \n\nDessert was tasty - carrot cupcake and chocolate mousse thingy. Sweet enough so we couldn't finish, but good nonetheless.\n\nOverall, price aside, I'd give em 3.5 stars.

SO NICE! i loved that they did that. So creative!\n\nParking is not the best since its downtown on Van Ness, but usually after 6 it should get easier.

IT COMES OUT SIZZLING AND IT HAS THIS BUTTERY GOODNESS TO IT! MMM. 4 huge stuffed mushrooms so worth $15. haha\n\nMy boyfriend got the Ribeye, and i got the petit. I didnt think it would be big enough but it was more than enough! i finished every single bite of that thing!\n\nNEGATIVES.\n\nOne thing i didn't like about Ruth Chris was that it doesn't come with the sides, if you wanted sides it would cost you extra.\n\nAnother would be the ambiance. its small and crowded and very fast paced..not as personable as i would like.\n\nLastly, the dessert wasn't the best. We got the creme brulee, and the creme felt like it had been sitting in the freezer waiting to be served.\nThe creme is supposed to be soft and creamy rather than a cold, thicker consistency. \n\nIF YOU PUT RUTH CHRIS WITH THE HOUSE OF PRIME RIB AMBIANCE....I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS. \n\nI liked House of prime rib's all around everything because of the whole show you get with the food, the bathrooms, and the place itself.\n\nBut if we're just talking about the quality of the food and taste of the food.\n\nRUTH CHRIS WINS BY FAR. \n You get what you get with Ruth Chris, and it's so damn good.

This was my second time at a Ruth's Chris location. The first time was in Hong Kong and I can say the Hong Kong location is way better. I've been wanting to come to the SF location because of what I remember from the HK one...big juicy steak covered in a buttery sauce.\n\nOriginally I was planning to order the Dine About Town menu but we saw online that they have their own set menu for a little bit more with bigger portions. Ordered the cesar salad, ribeye with sides of mushrooms and mashed potatoes and some nasty dessert. The cesar salad was just an ordinary salad, the mushrooms and potatoes were somewhat plain. The table next to us kept asking the waiter how they make their steaks and the waiter kept telling him about some special oven they have. He also told the person he would be crazy to try to recreate the oven. No matter how amazing this oven is, it still isn't enough to beat my mom's steaks. I'm not sure if I would say this is even the 3rd best steak I've had because I'm pretty sure there are plenty of competitors for the #3 spot. #1 has to go to my mom, #2 Ruth's Chris in HK, #3 is a toss up. Finally the dessert...I thought I just ordered fresh berries but apparently I ordered fresh berries with sweet creme sauce. The sauce was pretty gross and I just opted to eat the berries by themselves. I wish I could've ended my dinner with something light such as sorbet cause I was pretty stuffed by the end of the meal. \n\nOverall I'm not sure I would come back here.

However Ruth's rib eye is the best I have had in quite some time.

It was cooked to medium rare perfection and served on a 500 degree sizzling plate. Each bite was just filled with mouth watering flavor and steak juices. Exactly what a rib eye should be. \n\nFor my side I opted for the cream spinach. The cream spinach was flavorless compared to the steak and I would recommend going with the garlic mashed potatoes or something else. \n\nTo cap the night off, I had some cheesecake with sides of chocolate almond pieces. The cheesecake was very good as I love cheesecake. The dark chocolate almond pieces were alright as I am not a huge fan of dark chocolate. \n\nService was very friendly and informative in making sure we do not touch the 500 degree sizzling plates before and when the plates came out. \n\nI will be back when I want a savory rib eye.", "author": "Albert L."}

We squeezed in at 10:00pm on a Saturday night and I'm assuming because of the lack of foot traffic in the restaurant, we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. \n\nThe service was great. The waiter was nice and promptly handed us DAT menus upon request. Bread and water were brought to us a little delayed, but refills were plentiful. Manager came by a couple times to give us our plates of steak and to check in on our experience. The decor was like any other higher end steakhouse, but a minus for the \"art\" that was hanging on the walls. The fragile framed blurred pictures of tulips and landscapes looked cheap and out of place.\n\nOn to the food, the real reason for this review. THANKFULLY we ordered from the DAT menu. If we had to pay full price for these steaks I would've balked and really made up my mind never to return. What gets me is my opinion that the steaks aren't so wonderful that it would be worth its sticker price of $50. If I had a vat of melted, perhaps even melted herb butter, and a meat injector, I could probably make the same steak in my own home--any steak with butter oozing out of it will taste better for that very reason. The steaks, the mashed potatoes, the creamed spinach, especially the salad and desserts (both the bread pudding and the key lime pie) were unspectacular. \n\nThis experience just confirms my past experience at Ruth's Chris a few years back where I ordered the filet mignon, side of fresh broccoli and fresh spinach.

Our friends told us good things and we were excited to have a nice meal together at a high end steakhouse. We were VERY disappointed and frustrated with our experience. Granted, it was a busy Friday night, but the party of about 15 men we were seated next to were so boisterous that we could not hear ourselves speak across our own table. The waiter had to keep repeating himself because he couldn't hear us and we couldn't hear him. He apologized for the noise but it was frustrating not being able to place our order because of the noise level. Other diners did not look thrilled to be there, either. None of us should have had to sit through a meal while listening to this loud party's conversations ranging from sex acts to Bruce Jenner's gender transformation. Some diners complained and the manager came in and spoke to the large party and asked them to quiet down. The atmosphere felt more like a zoo than a restaurant whose plates cost $40+ per person.

Besides, anytime I can get my wife into a nice dress and her sexy stiletto slingbacks I am definitely up for.\n\nBeing an SF native, I have never gone to Ruth's due to (a) other places like Harris or House of Prime Rib up the street and (b) pricey - you have to buy your sides.  Quite frankly, I can see why this will probably be my one and only time.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food was good and of good quantity.  Our steaks were made to our liking and they were quite good.  The caeser salad and lobster bisque were ok.  With our entrees, we shared some mushrooms and shoestring potatoes which were equally quite good.  The order of potatoes is quite large and can be shared with more than two people if you have a large party.\n\nOk, why the 3 stars you say?  Well, while the service during dinner was very good I was not happy that we did not get seated until a half hour after my reservation.  Mind you, we were slightly early even for our reservation.  What I suspect is that they accept a lot of walk in parties or were not managing their reservations very well.  Groups with reservations must have priority, not the walk-ins, ok?  Ruth's Chris, if you want to really be a bigtime steakhouse player, you can't do this.  I understand a lot of people perhaps make reservations and bail on you, so what you can do is simply charge them for missed reservations.  Require that guests leave their credit card numbers at reservation time and if they don't show up charge them a fee.  People have shows or things to go to after dinner and, again, you ain't some cheap hole-in-the-wall place.  Our dinner was easily over two bills and we ain't big drinkers at that.\n\nThe second thing that upset me was that while the valet parking was ok at $10 for the area I expect you to park my sweet Mercedes in some secure lot, away from the street.  Turns out that when we left and I went to get my car, it was parked in a regular metered parking spot between other cars.  Great, luckily my baby didn't receive any bumper rash from other cars.   \n\nLet's be honest, this would not be happening at Harris or House of Prime Rib up the street.  They cater to a more older, upscale crowd.  In Ruth's, you see a lot of touristy types and people in jeans.  For the prices that Ruth's Chris is charging, I have every right to have expected more and I simply did not get it.

My wife's assessment of the petite filet was that it was too chewy, the meat not tender, and was a bit dry as well.

The overall quality of the food has taken a big dive.  Thank God I was fortunate enough to be seated in the back at a table against the wall.\n\nLet's start with the question of whether or not you are ordering, receiving and paying for prime beef - yes, no - I'm not so sure.  I've always ordered the large filet there in the past but I was told by wait staff that the filets they were getting were not Prime - hmmmm...should I have questioned the authenticity of the other steaks and their level of quality?  I started with the chopped salad (when i asked if the salad had meat in it, I was told \"no\" - I decided to open the menu and read the ingredients only to see that it had bacon in it, which is what I recalled.  Okay, I love bacon as much as anyone but I didn't want the taste of it in my salad after my cocktail and before the steak (I remember the days of the revolting filet with bacon wrapped around it and it was not a taste I want to remember).  I ended up with the Caesar.  Really - the plate had two sliced cherry tomatoes on it - where does a tomato mix with a Caesar, and where was the anchovy?  Croutons out of a box.  Oh, yes, and the bread that was placed on the table could have been bought at the Safeway baker in one of the bins.  That's fine if you are at Safeway.\n\nNext came the Ribeye - ordered medium rare and it was cooked very well.  However, the abundance of fat that I left on the table should not have been there.  Side of asparagus - beautifully cooked with nice light hollandaise.  Shoestring Potatoes - artfully presented in a large tower - those on the top were warm and fairly crispy but as you ate down they became more and more limp and tasteless.  \n\nHad a dirty martini before dinner and a glass of Franciscan Cab with dinner - all fine.\n\nNice Waiter.\n\n\nEveryone has their own experience and I'm sure many have been over the top at Ruth's Chris - this one was not for me.", "author": "Billy D."}

I don't think the establishment would mind either way, but to make your dining more comfortable it is suggested.\n\nDeciding to splurge I ordered myself the special Australian Wagyu that ran about $130.

While we were waiting for our food there was always a server near to cater to our every need.  I never once had to ask for anything to be refilled which was great! The atmosphere was alive and buzzing, but it wasn't so loud that you couldn't hear the person across from you.  We couldn't keep our eyes off of the servers coming and going carrying sizzling platters of beef out - it smelled SO DELICIOUS! \n\nThe shoestring fries came out first and they were thin, but not to the point where they were all crunch like pik niks, they still maintained a potato-E texture inside which surprised me.  We almost finished the darn things off before I had to force us to stop so we could have some with our entr\u00e9es.  The rest of our meal came out in no time flat and we found ourselves drooling over hot plates of beautifully cooked meat sizzling in BUTTER!

It was just vegetables thrown in basically Annie's Goddess Dressing (if you've never tried that you can find it at your local safeway store) and I got the jambalya which was nothing to really brag about either\n\nThen came the main course. I had the filet which was topped off with shrimp and when my plate came it was still sizzling (literally) butter. I was afraid to eat it because it was literally a whole plate full of melted butter but I couldnt resist because who can resist the yummy smell of melted butter. I tried a piece of shrimp first definetely nothing special, it was just shrimp sprinkled in seasoning. But then I poked my fork into the big serving of mashed potatoes and OMGGGG it was the most delicious mashed potatoes I've ever had and I did not even need gravy or sauce. Then came time for the steak and I was in heaven. It was cooked perfectly and so juicey and tasteful.

Smart move yelpers.\n\nAnd.. another birthday dinner; this time for my look-a-like sister! I'll do you guys a favor by skipping the bull and go straight to the food.\n\nThe Dine About Town Menu:\n\n+Steak House Salad, nothing out of the ordinary. Not that salads can be mind-blowingly delicious, but i expected a bit more from Ruth esp. since we're paying a little bit more for their name.\n\n+8oz Rib Eye/ 16 oz, really tasty! Cooked in a 1800 degree oven and slathered with butter and parsley! UGH, died and gone to heaven! My parents got theirs prepared well-done which was a HUGE mistake because their fillet came out slightly burnt and not-so-tender..disappointment there.\n\n+Mash Potatoes, too damn mashed! Their mash potatoes are literally creamed potatoes. Not the way I like it prepared. I like mine with a bit more texture. Not to mention, it tasted really bland too... disappointment again.\n\nwe also ordered creamed spinach, but i didn't try it because i never liked it to begin with. sorry.\n\n+bread pudding topped with whisky, SO TASTY! The soft, semi-chewy texture of the bread putting, seasoned properly with the slight hint of whiskey is the perfect combination! ugh, i would go back just for this!\n\nHere is a taste of their Fall/Winter Special:\n\n+Louisiana Seafood Jambalaya, was too salty. The tiny scoop of rice that topped the jambalaya helped offset the salty-ness, but that was only temporary. I much rather have the mediocre 'Steak House Salad'\n\n+Salmon, perfectly cooked and seasoned. It was served on top of a bed of spinach which was a little bit too salty. The salmon was just...perfect.\n\n+Cornbread Pudding, best side dish! Cornbread baked with bits of corn in it was perfect. A little bit of crunch, a slight mush, YUMM! and who doesn't like cornbread? come on!\n\n+Dessert Duo with Chocolate moose and carrot cake. Can you say sweet tooth? Both the desserts were super sweet, but the minute slice of carrot cake was really good. It was topped with small fried strands of carrots which gave it the perfect balance of crunchy, soft and savory sweet. Chocolate moose? meh, i pass.\n\nThe service here was great, the waiter was extremely attentive along with the bus boys.

What does not taste good with butter?  Ruth's Chris knows what's up and it seems like everything they serve is butter-fied.  The steaks come out sizzling in butter.  The typical sides -- mashed potatoes, creamed spinach...with LOTS of butter.\n\nCame here for Dine About Town and got the petite filet (choice of chicken, fish or shrimp) which came with the house salad, a side of mashed potatoes or creamed spinach, and the classic dessert chocolate cake with berries.  The salad was whatever, seemed like the generic salad you'd get anywhere (it IS a steak house, anyway).  The sides were what you would expect -- nothing to die for -- but the filet was sublime.  I actually had my wisdom teeth pulled out two days prior and I had no problem whatsoever eating it.  It was tender, juicy and seemed to melt in your mouth...ahhh bliss.  The dessert was whatever, came out a little dry.  Also tried the sweet potato casserole which was good, but a little too sweet for my taste buds.  Seemed like I was eating candy.  The portions were good too.  My dining friend had to unbutton her pants after the meal.  I think that's a good sign.\n\nThey also have a regular prix fixe menu offering almost the same thing all year round for $40, compared to the $35 DAT offering.\n\nOh yeah, btw, the bread is amaazing.

Very well seasoned, and i enjoyed every bite... (couldn't finish the entire thing, so i had to doggy bag the rest... yes i bring home leftovers!) ha... they had this really cute doggy bag too =P\n\n* Side Dish - Mashed potatoes\nSide dishes are served somewhat a la carte, so one order, will be enough for 2 people.  Nothing spectacular about this dish... we got it just for something to eat with the steak.

DELICIOUS). \n\n* chocolate cake / fruit dessert: This was actually my least favorite. The chocolate cake was really rich (but in a bitter kind of way instead of the typical sweet chocolate taste). I wasn't a huge fan. The little mini tart with the fruit was good though :) \n\nWe also had a glass of wine with the meal.

The DAT salad was just mixed greens w/ balsamic vinaigrette. We got the ceasar salad, which was quite tasty with the other meal. Now the steaks. Goodness Gracious! It comes sizzling out on a super hot plate of melted butter. Cooked to perfection! Could have cut it with the butter knife. I will definitely try it with the optional outer crust options..YUM!

Desserts were ho-hum. DAT dessert was a choco cupcake. I had the trio: peanut butter/choco cake, custard and mixed berries and vanilla ice cream - surprisingly, the custard and berries were the best of the 3.

I was previously sworn off steakhouses, because of one awful experience at a different restaurant where the only non-meat entr\u00e9e was shrimp, which, besides being expensive, tasted like chemicals - a total throw away. Ruth's Chris prepares their seafood very well and offers many options which is refreshing (crab cakes, tuna, salmon, shrimp, scallops, lobster and a catch of the day). They have a vegetarian entree, \"personalized potato & vegetable selection\"- not very imaginative, but points for at least offering it.\n\nI've visited three times and have been more than satisfied each time. The food and service are great. Their waitstaff are very friendly, observant and knowledgeable. My last visit, I chose an entr\u00e9e and side that were offered on the prix fixe \"Classic\" menu, but I wanted a salad appetizer that was not. Once the waiter took my order, he offered the prix fixe pricing, without me having to ask, and gave me the appetizer I wanted. So then I was able to get dessert included in that price too! Sweet! I had the Ruth's Chop salad as my appetizer (very tasty with the perfect amount of dressing) with sea scallops as my entr\u00e9e. The scallops were served over fried polenta which was very good. The green beans w/garlic were terrific. I shared some broccoli au gratin and this new hash brown item, which was way too much food (although delicious), as everything is extremely heavy. Their entire menu involves some kind of sauce, butter, cheese or cream. I mean, I guess this comes with the territory at a steakhouse, but it would be nice to have a few lighter options. Key Lime pie was my dessert - also very good, with a delicious crumbly base, and a huge slice to boot, which I had to take home along with the other stuff I couldn't finish. Luckily I have to walk up a big hill to get home, which helps kick start my metabolism. Next time, I will order with my stomach, not my eyes!

During a cake fight fight they decided to have at their table one of the girls actually leaped into my lap and ending up smearing cake all over my pants and my shirt. I mean come on! For the waiter and the management to let this go on in an establishment like that this is just disgusting.

At 8:30 we were still waiting for our table which was fine, but then 8:40, then 8:50, then 9:00 came around and we were STILL waiting. The hostess, Brianna, was soooo rude. We asked about our reservations and she said the party before ours was still at our table. She was talking to another hostess, right in front of us mind you, and saying that we were early and that getting us seated at our time wasn't important and that we could wait. No apology was offered, no \"thank you for waiting;\" especially since there were 11 of us and we had plans to go out doing bachelorette things. Brianna, kept saying rude comments about our party right in front of us. I was appalled. I talked to the manager who offered to give us appetizers on the house, which was a nice gesture but honestly, something should have been done said and done sooner. By the time we sat down to eat it was 9:15... we didn't end up leaving until about 10:30/10:45.\n\nAs always the food was amazing; but the service and reservation situation was horrible. Luckily the 2 waiters we had were awesome. Everyone beware of the rude hostess Brianna.", "author": "Tiffany F."}

I indicated on Open Table we were celebrating a birthday and there was \"happy birthday\" confetti on our table which was a much-appreciated and festive touch. \n\nFood was great.  They have a fixed price menu which was very nice and you can upgrade sides and dessert for a few dollars more.  They have a nice selection of wines for $45 to celebrate their 45th birthday.  The wine our waitress suggested was excellent.  Filet was cooked perfectly.  Bread pudding was excellent.  Chocolate explosion was ok.  A little dry in my opinion.

We came here last night for our anniversary and i must say it was a fun experince.  We made reservations for 6pm and was able to park out at the meters since it was free after 6pm or you can do valet for $10 bucks.  We waited a couple minutes before we were seated.  Since they knew from the reservation is was our anniversary the person at the front greeted us.  It was nice becuz they sat us near the window in a quiet room so we could enjoy out nice dinner.  I think we were a little over dressed though.  There were ppl up in there were in jeans and some lady in sweat pants.  I guess you pay for the atmosphere really.  It was nice also cuz after a couple minutes some chick came over and put rose petals on our table. \n\nThey handed us a HUGE wine menu and the reg menu.  Since we dont drink we went straight to the food menu.  its pretty good menu! i went for 3 course $49.95 menu.  I got a ceaser salad and it was huge! i was so full already from it but it was lighty tossed with cheese crutons and it was yummy! i am glad the dressing wasnt overpowering.  For the main course I ordered the filet and had it butterflyed at medium well.  However I wasnt too pleased with the outcome becuz i wished our server had told us about the 500 degree hot plate thing.  My steak was well done by the time i started cutting into it.  The steak just has salt pepper parsley and butter.  Which wasnt too flavorful.  It came with a side order so i choosed mashed potatoes.  It was on the cold side like it was the first to get prep b4 being served.  It had a nice hint of garlic and it tasted like it was made from scratch.  However since it was a little cold i wasnt satified.  My husband got french fries with his steak and i must say they are the best french fries we ever had.  It was season was salt and pepper and it was nice and crisp on the outside and soft in the inside.  They were to die for! As for dessert that came with my meal.  It was nice for them to put Happy Anniversary on the plate.  It was i think some type of chocolate cake or maybe german chocolate cake and berries with cream sauce.  I MUST SAY you must try the fresh berries and cream sauce when you go to RC it was soo fresh but creamy at the same time.   I wish i ordered another berries and cream to take home but we didnt have time since we had to leave for a play.  The service was really good and the atmosphere was very nice.  The place was nice and clean and all the tables were nicely and neatly set.\n\nOverall I would come here again but it wasnt something I am crazy about.

Nice mix of dark greens and iceberg.\n\nEntree - Filet mignon for me and I added (+$15) a crab cake and asparagus with a creamy hollandaise sauce.  WOW!  The jumbo lump blue crab cake was amazing and really added to the steak.  Huge chunks of meat, no filler.  Sauce was on the heavy side, but I just pushed what I didn't want aside.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves a good steak, a good deal and good service.\n\nOur server was extremely friendly and helpful in explaining the specials - I suppose it's because it was 3 ladies ordering!  ;P  Nonetheless, he provided excellent service, and didn't pressure us to leave the restaurant as we were taking our time.  It can take a while for 3 girls to get through dinner while making much-needed girl talk!\n\nWe ordered from the prix-fixe menu, which had very good selections.  For $49.95, I was entitled to a salad, choice of meat, side and dessert.  I chose the Harvest Salad, which was delicious, ribeye medium and french fries (for an additional $2).  In addition to that, my companions shared their sides - which were creamed spinach and green beans.  The bread was warm and tasty.  Because our server knew two of us had birthdays, he hooked each of us birthday girls up with a dessert from the regular menu, so I had the bread pudding, which was delicious and my roomie had the cheesecake, which was also great to nibble on.  Our friend had dessert from the prix-fixe menu, which was a piece of carrot cake and chocolate mousse.  Our server brought the birthday desserts out each with a candle.  :)  We brought a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, which required a $25 or $35 corkage fee.\n\nFor the three of us, the bill was roughly $170.

What bugs me is the Ala carte menu. You are charging 40+ dollars on steaks and you are going to charge side dishes as well? The steaks are good not great. Butter and steak..............you really can't go wrong with that if you want to experience sharp pain in the chest, shortness of breath, and paralysis on either side of the body. \n\nThe sides can use a little help. The broccoli Au gratin was a little too cheesy(I know Au gratin........cheese), the shoe string fries tasted like those canned french fries I had when I was a kid. The asparagus, spinach, and mushrooms were the stars of the night. Actually the stuffed mushroom appetizers were awesome. The drinks are pretty stiff here so you will get your bang for the buck. The bartenders are always nice and friendly. \n\nThe total bill for 6 ppl came out to around 540 including tax and tip so it was reasonable. Something about everything being ala carte just bugs me.

That said, I would pick McDonald's over this place any day.\n\nFirst of all, they don't serve sourdough bread at the table because every Ruth's Chris across the country follows the exact same ingredients. So... we were served some pretty lame bread that probably came from thousands of miles away. Then, a pre-made salad that obviously came from a bag. The steak itself was average at best for an expensive steakhouse. The key lime pie also tasted like it was from a far away factory. Do they make anything in-house here? Granted, I was here for a $35 fixed price menu but I don't see how that justifies being served salad out of a bag.

The men ordered the ribeye upgrade for $8 extra, while the ladies ordered the filet for the regular prix-fixed price. I must say, I LOVED my filet. It was incredibly flavorful and did not need any type of blue-cheese crust, etc. add on that you can get. It wasn't as tender as some filets I've had in the passed, but the flavor was pretty blow-your-mind good. The ribeye, which I snagged a bite of (you would too), was good, but a little more fatty than I like. The dudes in our group enjoyed the fattiness though, so I guess it's good, if you're into that stuff. The sides, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, while good, were forgettable, but whatever. They're sides. You're there for the main course, aren't you? \n\nDessert-wise, the unanimous favorite was the bread pudding. I read somewhere that someone thought the whiskey flavor was too overpowering. To this I call bullshit (no offense).

Hmm.. I guess that's all you can ask for in a steakhouse, because come on you don't really have to be Thomas Keller to make a USDA Prime rib-eye taste good.  \n\nOne thing about those 500 degree plates.. they make it impossible for any type of garnish to go on the plate without getting singed, which kind of makes the presentation of the steak a little lacking.  Seriously it's just a steak on a plate.  Covered in butter.  No presentation points here.  But man it smells good.  Also I ordered my steak medium rare and by the time I was half-way through my steak it was probably at about a medium well because that plate was so hot.  If you're like me and like your meat bloody, get it rare or even blue.

I bit into the filet, expecting something amazing. I was sorely mistaken. It was bland, and not very impressive at all. I've had filet before at other restaurants in Southern CA (Paul Martin's was excellent).  My buddy ordered the chicken, and Gratin Potatoes.

Our server was Jesse and he was AWESOME! His attitude and knowledge of the food was top notched. The food here is actually really good compared to what some people say. I got the Rib eye steak and my boyfriend got the same but bone-in. We also added in sides of steamed broccoli and shoestring French fries. The steak came out sizzling hot on the plate, like literally still cooking! The steaks were cooked just perfectly as ordered and the fat was marbleized throughout the entire piece. When you bite into it, it just felt like it melted in your mouth, mmmm, so tender! The dishes were nothing fancy, just basic plates you would find at a diner. That's what I kind of liked about this place also was because it wasn't too fancy in terms of their presentation. They're very straight to the point as you can tell from looking at their menu. Everything is very basic and classic. They did not have Foie gras though which I was a little disappointed. What disappointed me even more was that they ran out of sorbet dessert that night! That was the only reason why they got minus a half star, plus the fact that their menu selection is a tad bit on the small side. Just note before you come here, everything is a la carte. Other than that, this is a nice little date spot to add to the list. Great service, Great food, and Nice d\u00e9cor! Dining in here made me feel like I was in a classier version of McLarens in How I Met Your Mother lol.", "author": "Marissa C."}

These meals come with a gumbo or salad, choice of meat, and a duo dessert.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-23", "description": "Wish I could give this place two reviews, one for the bar (5-stars), one for the restaurant (1-star). I split the difference. But what follows will detail why the one star and why the five between the two.\n\nI normally don't go in for national chain restaurants, but Ruth's Chris has very good steaks. I love the way they're prepared and served. Extremely flavorful. I've never been let down by the food. However, the restaurant experience is a different matter.\n\nTHE RESTAURANT (1-Star)\n\n(Note: be sure to read the second half of the review about the bar)\n\nI'd been to Ruth's Chris in other cities and wanted to try it out for an anniversary with my wife. First I was a bit disappointed in the dining rooms, it just didn't look quite as upscale as the pricing would lead you to believe. I know it's a steak house. I don't expect the decor to be show stopping. The booths and tables will be standard. The wall art, wall-arty. But there's something about the atmosphere in the dining rooms I find really kind of awful. Way too middle of the road, this could be anywhere indoorsy. Way too corporate and boring. And the lighting's a bit bright. And if you're there on a weekend night, there will be at least three crying babies as this seems to be one of the hottest, bring the babies to the expensive steakhouse for the once a year family celebration place in SF. \n\nSo we arrive. The dining rooms aren't full yet. There's only one big family in the main room, and we are seated in a booth right next to the big party. There were tons of tables and booths available in the main room, away from them, and in the side rooms as well. Why sit a dressed-up couple (obviously going out for a romantic dinner) next to a loud family with TWO crying babies and a few rambunctious kids? It was too loud to talk to eachother and after a few minutes waiting for the server,  I decided \"no\" we can't sit here. So I asked our server to switch tables when she arrived. I normally don't do this, but seriously, I really think they could have thought more about where to seat us instead of just sitting us in the order required by management or something. \n\nWe get reseated in a different dining room. And the rush begins. I suppose our table was earmarked for someone coming in a half hour later, because, I'm not kidding, they put our steaks on the table while we were half-way through our salads.  Here's your twenty minute $150 dollar meal.\n\nI will NEVER eat in the dining rooms again.\n\nTHE BAR (5-stars!!!)\n\nThe bar, on the other hand, is always a five-star experience. There's a romantic little table for two in the corner along the window that's usually empty. You don't need a reservation, just walk into the bar and sit at an empty table if it's set. Or just ask one of the friendly bartenders and they'll direct you to an open spot. There's even a few booths in the back of the bar that are available. I love that I never need a rez and I usually get that nice little table in the front corner. If not, the bar is a great place to eat. \n\nArturo, Jose and Dan are some of the best bartender/servers in SF. They always treat me right. Make great drinks and offer much better service than the busy waitstaff in my experience. The bar itself is nice, wood paneled and lit much nicer than the rest of the place. \n\nForget the hostess or the line, just walk right in the bar and grab a table, you'll probably have a much better experience than in the dining rooms. It's like a totally different restaurant. I try to come here at least once a month.", "author": "Jason G."}

Thankfully, this trip reminded me why we used to go for so many special occasions! The food was fantastic and the service excellent and appropriate - we can be a bit silly, especially once the drinks start coming, and having wait staff who are both humorous and friendly, while keeping it classy, is a huge plus to us!\n\nWhen making the reservation I was asked if there was an event being celebrated, and I did admit to it being my birthday dinner. When we arrived it seemed everyone on the staff knew which reservation we were and why we were there, and the table was decorated with cute happy-birthday-confetti.\n\nI know I heard a lot of praise for the food from around the table but as far as what I ordered:\n\nI tried their seared ahi tuna appetizer for the first time and it was exactly what I wanted - super nice quality tuna, just enough sear/texture on the edges and soft in the middle. I loved the sauce they serve it in, sort of a gingery, rice vinegary, tart-tangy thin sauce. For me it paired with the tuna really well without being your standard 'soy based dipping sauce'.\n\nI always end up getting a filet, medium rare, and this time I had them add the blue cheese crust. It's like a layer of creamy and crunchy cheese on just the top of the steak, enough to get a little bit with each bite but not have it overwhelm the meat flavor. Perfectly cut filet, the edges had that hint of salty slight-char to them and tender inside. \n\nFor sides I tried some sweet potato casserole and creamed spinach. The spinach is always excellent but I'd never gotten the sweet potato casserole before - personally I found it amazing, almost like a dessert, with a light fluffy potato texture instead of being thick. It's definitely sweet, so be aware if you don't like sweet tastes alongside your savory course. \n\nWhen it came time to order dessert they actually brought out a 'happy birthday' dessert plate with a piece of chocolate cheesecake (not too chocolatey, which can make it bitter - yay!), a small scoop of ice cream with berry sauce, and some berries in cream on the side. So good! I was even asked if I wanted something else instead since one of the staff overheard me talking about creme brulee. No worries, the birthday dessert was great!\n\nThis was also my first time bringing my own wine to a restaurant and RC handled it as if they do it every night - which they probably do. Very reasonable corkage and no fuss. \n\nOverall: I have nothing but praise for the entire Ruth's Chris staff - floor, front desk, kitchen, all of them - for being instrumental to an excellent night. The food was just right, the service fantastic, and we'll definitely be back... though maybe in smaller groups next time! :) End to end dinner and dessert took about 3 hours for our large group and it never felt 'slow', we just had a lot of people to organize/get ordered/served.  It's the kind of place that encourages taking your time, anyway. \n\nWith RC I think a lot of it is what you make of it - be aware of the food and drink costs set your expectations accordingly. You don't have to be on a dine-to-impress date to enjoy this place, I've been on intimate dinners and fun group occasions both and they always handle it superbly. It's more expensive than [insert italian-chain-restaurant-here] but I have a hard time saying it's expensive for what it is.", "author": "Ama F."}

I remember it being delicious and wanting to come back again.  \n\nI finally returned with my girlfriends on a Friday night for Dine About Town.  We had 9pm reservations and were not seated until about 30 minutes later.   We had to wait in the bar area where there was a ton of customers packed in there like sardines.   It was definitely not a relaxing experience.  The drinks were okay, but they cost upwards of $15/drink.   Due to the wait, a server came around with a platter of garlic shrimp which was nice...but at 9:30 at night, a piece of shrimp isn't going to quell my appetite or make me forget that our reservation was actually 30 minutes ago.  \n\nWe chose the $34.95 fixed menu.  I got the salad, petite filet mignon, mashed potatoes, and key lime pie.   My friends ordered the filet too, but got creamed spinach and bread pudding.  We also shared a bottle of red that we brought and they had a corking fee of $15.  \n\nThe salad was unimpressive.   Filet was really good...you can tell it was cooked in butter.  Hey, I love butter.  It's probably pretty close to my love for bacon.  I asked for it medium and it was perfectly cooked.  Sides were very disappointing.  Mashed potatoes tasted like that boxed Potato Buds stuff and the creamed spinach had a weird \"dirty\" flavor?  Dessert was okay.  I was told the bread pudding wasn't very good either.  Luckily, we got our own desserts.  I saw on some reviews that other Dine About Town diners were forced to share desserts.  booooo.\n\nI probably would not come again unless someone else was paying.  haha.  I think that is why I liked it the first time.   Our boss had taken us there for dinner and I didn't even have to look at the bill.  :)  I rather go to other steakhouses over Ruth's Chris.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-01-27", "description": "Probably one of the best Dine About Town experiences I've ever had!  \n\nWent here with a party of 4 on a Friday night, but had no trouble getting seated since we booked reservations on Opentable.  It was very nice that they seated half of our party though some of us were running late, it gave the early birds a chance to order some drinks and peruse the menu while waiting for the latecomers...so many restaurants don't do that anymore and force people to wait until everyone gets there.  The ambiance was nice, not too formal but plush and comfortable.\n\nBoth the bread and the salad to start were very good, but who am I kidding, it's all about the STEAK.  3/4 of us ordered the 12-oz ribeye (to get the most steak for the $$) and it was both huge and tasty.  I still preferred the 8-oz filet that I ordered, it was much tastier though it wasn't as fatty (all the butter they slathered on provided enough of the fat anyway).  It actually seemed much larger than an 8-oz, so it was still a killer deal.  Probably one of the best steaks I've had in the bay area.  \n\nThe DAT menu included the side dishes so I got the creamed spinach and the hubby got mashed potatoes, we had enough to share both.   Oh, and did I mention they let you get a lobster tail for an additional $17?   I didn't indulge but thought that seemed like a good deal if you're into lobster.  For dessert, I had the bread pudding which was awesome, hubby ordered the key lime pie (which I'm not really into) but he liked it too.  I pretty much liked everything they served me from start to finish (unlike Alexander's where we spent way more $$$ and the dessert was crap).  The portions for pretty much everything was very generous, so it seems like it would be a good deal even at regular prices (and a monster deal at $35).\n\nI gotta say, for a foursome ordering $35 dinners and bringing their own wine for $15 corkage (hey, it's dining out in recession season) they treated us very well and the service was excellent.  The server didn't even bat an eyelash when we asked him to open not one but 2 bottles of wine that we brought with us.  He was also just very friendly the whole time and we had no trouble finding him when we needed something, definitely deserved a good tip.\n\nFor DAT, I don't think there are any values better than this one.  Most restaurants totally skimp on both their food and service during DAT, which just violates the whole purpose of trying to let new people get to know your restaurant.  I usually don't like chain restaurants, but Ruth's Chris has convinced me that this is a place worth coming back to (especially if someone else is paying).", "author": "Arlene M."}

They are rather delicious and you are acting uncivilized!\" Bullets ricocheted, sending glass and shrapnel flying through what must normally be a fairly nice atmosphere to celebrate steak. I had taken cover behind my table and didn't appreciate these chavvy oiks opening fire, recklessly endangering my meal. I was yelling at them over the sound of gunshots and screams to leave the food out of this scuffle. I mean, from what I tasted before they opened fire, the crab-cakes were a delightful appetizer. A bullet hit the Hunnicutt bottle of cabernet sauvignon and a splash of wine hit my lips in the resulting explosion of glass. A nice hint of cinnamon and black cherry implied a great collaboration with the accompanying T-Bone. I sat there behind cover: smacking my lips, trying to embrace the taste of the wine, reloading my service revolver, wondering how I ended up in this pickle. \n\nCut to an hour ago:  There I was, stepping into the night air disguised as a grizzled mountain man, trailing two suspects to find a lead in my case (please see the Thirsty Bear case file). Just another puzzle piece in the Case of the Missing Papaya Diamond, I suppose, and I followed at a safe distance. On the few occasions they turned around to see if they were being followed, I would simply just pretend to be a local whistling mountain man nonchalantly window shopping for... elegant brassieres apparently. Everyone bloody dares underestimate my disguise skillset. The fake beard was getting itchy a few blocks out, though, so I did the logical thing and changed appearances. The industrial strength glue made it awkwardly challenging: the final tug of the fake beard made this gentleman wince. A manly, muffled wince, mind you. This isn't amateur hour. Through my teary eyes I saw the two chaps sneak into Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. Steak? I was highly motivated all of a sudden to follow this stake-out through to the end. Or should I say, steak-out.  See what I did there? Award winning British humour. \n\nSomehow in the course of ordering food and chatting with my waiter Jose, the two suspects realized I was the world famous Detective Honeybutter and that they were about to become BFFs with justice. They weren't too keen on this idea, apparently, because they flipped their table over and opened fire. My finely-tuned, genetically hard-coded, honorably mentioned survival instincts kicked in after about the seventh gunshot and second slug to the shoulder (I was in the middle of trying a crab-cake, you see). So here I was, demanding that they leave my food alone and signaling to Jose that I needed a refill on my water.\n\nEvery stray bullet from the thugs would allow pieces of my meal to fly through the air and make their journey to the intended participant: moi. I used this to my advantage by recommending to them that they shoot at various corners of my table. If I wanted to try the lyonnaise potatoes on the left on the table, for example, I would insult their mothers and say I'm hiding out to the left. The resulting shot would then guarantee a tasting of these delicious little reminders that potatoes deserve medals for being so customizable. Thin crunchiness enveloped a soft potato center. Jose, much to my satisfaction, reluctantly continued to bring out dishes, dodging bullets along the way. \"Sir, you are bleeding\" I recalled him saying. I also recall tasting the seared tuna and promising myself I would go back to get the actual dish. By the time the T-Bone showed up on my plate I was fairly annoyed with all of this horsing around with the gunshots and me bleeding and whatnot. Tip: get the T-Bone medium rare and take your sweet time enjoying it. The ongoing gunfight was drowned out as I chewed an excellent cut of steak; a kind of steak that makes you want to salute a flag, empower you to find your childhood bully on Facebook and call his kids ugly, a kind of steak where nothing else matters. Only the bone was left and, since I wanted to enjoy my chocolate cake in silence, decided to take care of the situation at hand. Gripping the bone in my fist with the sharp end protruding through my fingers like a talon, I leapt over the table and (CENSORED DUE TO SLAPSTICK VIOLENCE) and that's why you let me eat in peace.\n\nIn hindsight, the chief will have a fit when he finds out that we have two less suspects, and, more importantly, that I didn't recommend the Derby Peach Tea Cocktail sooner.", "author": "Brevin P."}

Everything was delicious, as usual. The steak was piping hot when it came out, still sizzling in butter and cooked to perfection as \"medium.\" It was so good, I felt literally felt like my arteries were clogging up as I was eating my steak and sauteed mushrooms. Oh and when the \"Chocolate Explosion\" came out? My fiance was ALL over it. When he laid eyes on my dessert, he pushed his carrot cake / chocolate mousse (which BTW wasn't very impressive) out of the way with his fork and didn't even look back at it. He ate more of my dessert than I did!\n\nThis year, the DAT menu ($34.95) didn't have ribeye as an option BUT you can upgrade to a 16 oz ribeye for $8.

The fries at Belly Burger are so much tastier.\n\nThe STEAK sucked!  I asked for medium rare and BF asked for medium well. Not like we haven't placed steak orders before, but there was a looong discussion with the server about these choices.\n\nWhy even bother?? We both had to send our steaks back. BF finally asked for a whole new steak because his was so overcooked and tough it was inedible while my steak was almost raw. The funny thing was, neither of us wanted to say anything because we just wanted to relax and have a nice time but the center of my steak was still cold and I was like \"for this kind of money, I am saying something\" and only then did he say \"well yeah, I can barely eat this it's so overcooked\".\n\nBeing a steak house and all you would think there would be an emphasis on excellent steak. But no. Well the steak was a beautiful piece of meat but by the time the chef finished with it, it had died twice.\nWe finally did get our steaks the way we wanted them but really they should have been served that way the first time.\n\nWe loved the ambiance and certain aspects of their menu but overall it was not a wonderful experience. You want a great steak the first time you order it at an expensive steakhouse and they just did not deliver that.\n\nActually as it comes back to me, this is the chronological order of the steak saga.\n\nA. 2 steaks too raw to eat.\nB.

Every time, we had a reservation for the two of us, but still had to wait 10-15 minutes at the bar before being seated. We enjoy the food though, and thus decided to come back with a group of our friends on a Saturday night before going out on Polk. \n\nWe had a reservation for 10 people at 8:15, and were then told to wait at the bar for 15 minutes. The bartenders were nice enough and served us our drinks quickly, but after 15 minutes, we were told to wait an additional 30 minutes. Our group of 10 was starving at this point, and after having waited all afternoon for our buttery steak dinner (which we had talked up to our friends), we were all understandably upset. Especially so since the staff kept stringing us along, and wasn't very sympathetic or helpful about the timeline. After over an hour, they still didn't know when it would be possible to seat us and then proceeded to kick us out. Guess reservations don't mean anything anymore. Ruth's Chris lost over $1k in revenue that night from our table, and countless dollars from our repeat business or any of our friends'. There are plenty of other steakhouses in the city with better service.

The evening, sadly, did NOT live up to expectations. \n\nWe arrived a bit before our 6 PM reservation and their tiny entryway and seating area are not conducive to waiting. Once we were seated, we found ourselves in a dimly lit room which could be romantic to some or just difficult to see for others. Our server, a nice young man, was very pleasant but did not seem to add much value in our food and drink selection. He also got distracted easily - he would ask what drinks we wanted, and if someone asked him a side question, he would go off to find the answer and leave half the table without drinks. He also asked us if we'd been there before (which we had) and then told us how to order. Um, we just told you we'd been here.\n\nWe all opted for the current special: a $49/person for starter (steak salad, ceasar salad or gumbo), appetizer (mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, sauteed mushrooms, and a couple others), entree (choice of 11 oz filet, 16 oz sirloin, or two others), and dessert. There is also a $39 special which has smaller portions of the filets, the chicken, and a couple other choices.\n\nThree of us went for the 11 oz. filet and one person went for the 16 oz. sirloin, and together we split sauteed mushrooms, mashed potatoes, two orders of creamed spinach, and a side of shoestring potatoes. FYI the side appetizers in the special are NOT the same size as regular sides...but still more than enough to eat. \n\nThe bread was soft and warm and tasted delicious. Like a white bread roll with a slight twist to it. The salad was really cheesy with heavy dressing. Don't get me wrong. It was good. But I felt really guilty afterward. There are four crucial components to a salad: lettuce, croutons, dressing, and assorted add-ons. Lettuce was crisp, croutons flavorful, dressing a tad heavy, and the cherry tomatoes and cheese tasted great. \n\nThe meat was juicy, but lacked any kind of substantial wow factor. The sauteed mushrooms were fabulous, but the creamed spinach and potatoes just tasted like cream was dumped into it. The shoestring potatoes were cold and over peppered.\n\nThe wine my pops and I drank was uninspired, and really not a good reflection on the wine list. He had the house merlot, I had a pinot and both just were lame. No flavor, and tasted cheap. \n\nAt the end, Mom and SIs opted to upgrade their desserts from the combo chocolate mousse and berry/pudding medley to the chocolate explosion and creme brulee, respectively, for $3 each. The desserts were all good...but by then I was stuffed!\n\nThe hostess and staff also seemed very uninterested in serving us or making our experience better.

Whenever my dad (who lives San Diego) and I see each other, we try and hit up at least one steak house. So far, Ruth's still reigns supreme. Even though, it's pricey, it is absolutely worth every single penny from the delish food to the great service.\n\nMy last visit to RC was on Black Friday, (as if I wasn't already sick of eating from Thanksgiving). I didn't care as I was going to fast until my beloved RC dinner. Of course, my dad and I started with a nice glass of the Parducci, Pinot Noir, \"Ruth's Chris Exclusive Blend.\" As we waited for our Lobster bisque soup, we munched on the warm and toasty bread.  \nThe bisque never disappoints me, with real chunks of lobster, and isn't too heavy nor salty. My petite filet was definitely sizzling upon arrival to the table, and every bite just melted in my mouth (as you can taste the buttery goodness). Of course, I savored every bite. We only ordered one side, the shoestring french fries, which was ginormous. We had to take the leftovers home (and BTW, it keeps pretty well). The creamed spinach, which we didn't order this time around, is an awesome side.\nFor dessert, we opted to share the creme brulee. I consider myself a creme brulee conneisseur, and this is one of my favorites. The brulee is perfect, and the creme is light and not dense. I like the variety of fruit, which was an excellent complement to a perfect brulee. \nEven after a few cups of the 'brave' coffee, I was still in a massive food coma. Good thing, I wore my stretchy pants!!\n\nYet another fabulous dining experience. Until next time, Ruth's!!", "author": "Gill C."}

Thanks Luis and Bernadette for not being EXFLICIT with me about how this place is just too rich for my blood.  Once I opened their menu, beads of sweat literally started forming on my temples.  My hands started to get sweaty as I perused through their $40-$80 entrees that come \"ala carte\" (so the effin sides, which averaged $10 each, came separately).  The waitress asked us if we wanted some drinks.  Without revealing my faltering confidence, I exclaimed, \"Give me the cheapest Cab you have\"... very FUNNY.   They gave us warm loaves of french bread with tubs of SEXY whipped butter.  This butter is so good I wanted to eat it with everything.  I slopped on butter on my bread, on every bite of my sumptious medium-rare ribeye steak, before every sip of my wine and water, and before every syllable of my speech.  I would fuck this butter if I could.  And you know it's going to be hella good, Butter.\r\nAfter we were all done with our meals, our gracious server told me that I get dessert on the house since it was my \"Birthday\" (which you can indicate in the online reservation)... very COOL.  She recommended the banana creme pie, Cindy and Bernz got cawfee, and Luis got the tawny.  The creme pie came with a candle, decked with perfectly caramelized, thinly sliced bananas, on top of this plate that was speckled with torched brown sugar.  It was DELICIOUS!  My party and I scarfed it down so fast that I forgot to invite my Butter to do a threeway with me and the Creme Pie.\r\n\r\n(tips to squeeze every value to your meal here at Ruth's: 1) Ask for more bread and more butter; 2) coffee refills are free, so ask for more coffee; 3) jack a handful of matchbooks on the way out to stock up your bathroom at home; 4) Say you're from Oracle and tell them to put it on the company card)\r\n\r\nWatch out for the eavesdropping Ewok.", "author": "Grace M."}

A salad. I'll implement my usual 'F*ck rabbit food' response for this one. \n  \nEntree: \nRib Eye with Blue Cheese crust. The Blue Cheese crust was heaven, if they had given me a plate of that instead I would have happily eaten it, unfortunately they had to add meat to it. That's right, you heard me. The cut of meat, if you can call it that, they gave me was so fatty that I actually started a pile of fat collections on a separate plate. Very..VERY disappointing and, frankly, absolutely unacceptable for a steakhouse. \n \nSides: \nMashed potatoes - ok, but who goes wrong with mashed potatoes? \nCreamed Spinach - Gross. Way too creamy and bland.\nShoe string fries - All string, no fry. I think the thin cut of the fries were meant to accomplish a crunchy fry, instead they were soggy and oily. I never thought I'd see the day where I actually ate oil but somehow Ruth's managed to make that possible. \n \nDessert:\nBread Pudding - At least they ended on a high note. The bread pudding was amazing, and that's coming from someone who's not even that big a fan of bread pudding. This is one of those desserts that's so good that the guilt sets in while you're eating it. You know..the whole 'This so good, it must be really unhealthy' thought. But it's worth it. \n \nOverall I'd say I was pretty disappointed with this place. The service was excellent, though we did have to wait for our table initially and the hostess didn't ask to take my coat. So..let me rephrase, the hostess kind of sucked but our waiter was excellent. \n\nAs for food, I hope you get a better cut than I did.

Yet even though I am free to eat there on the company dime I had never actually set foot in one until last night.  The occasion was a friend's desire for a whole lot of meat in her mouth.  I couldn't pass that up, could I?\n\nThis place is pretty simple.  They got lots of pricey food here, mostly of the broiled meat variety.  They do have a very decent selection of appetizers to choose from.  My choice from the night was the mushrooms stuffed with crab.  They also have all the essential cuts of meat that they broil to your request (why anyone in their right mind would want a good steak more than medium rare I don't know).

Crazy since I'm a steak connosseiur? I think not.\n\nMy first experience with Ruth Chris was in San Diego, where my ex took me for our prom night. The service was lacking then, which I attribute to our young age and the fact that my ex had dared to ask for A1 Sauce. *gasp* Yes, totally humiliating for both me and the restaurant staff.\n\nBut hard feelings aside for the San Diego location, Ruth Chris of SF really bombed it on Dine About Town this year. We were taking my brother out to celebrate a momentous occassion, with a reservation for 3 - showed up 10 minutes early and then were told we'd have to WAIT 30 MINUTES TO BE SEATED. \n\nUHHHHH ok hold up here. Let's review. \n-First of all, that reservation was made days before. \n-your hostess was a snappish bia who honestly, shouldn't be heading your table seatings if she's going to be condescending to people coming in the door. \n-the mob of people waiing around us did NOT have reservations...and I get it that its Dine About and you want to make a profit and all from the evening by serving 400 dinners at half the price instead of the usual 200 or so (quoted by a staff member, by the way), but overbooking to the point where your actual reservations aren't seated in timely mannner??!?! IT'S CALLED WALK IN FOR A REASON. If you put someone in charge of seating, he or she should be smart enough to know that reservations have priority and shouldn't be put in queue behind those who attempt to get in for a cheap meal. \n-you make enough money, as any establishment in Napa or most of San Francisco with a plate average of $30+ will do, offer to buy your guests a round of drinks. Or if that's not in your budget \"because of the economy\" offer them bread or a sampling of appetizers. It ain't THAT hard!\n\nSince it was such a late reservation on Dine About Night, we decided to stick out the wait. We were seated an hour later - NOT 30 minutes at our table. Miguel was wonderful, hence the second star. We were served efficiently and with attentive consideration of our tastes. He told us the pros and cons of the Dine About menu options (although when we asked for the special menus, it did take him a few minutes too long for him to get them to us at first....not sure if that was a subtle, disappointed \"OH\" that we weren't eating off the full-priced menu) and our wine glasses were always full. He, if anything, is what saves this restuarant from getting the horrible rating it deserves. And the fact that of the three steaks, I got the best cut! I think it had to do with my order being rare.\n\nGo to Harris' or better yet, make the drive down to Palo Alto for Fleming's which is fantastic both in San Diego and up here. You'll be much happier with your creamed spinach and steak at any of those locations.", "author": "Alita M."}

Service was attentive, and there was a Summer Celebration (a \"5\" course meal for two - $89) - 2 Salads, 2 Entrees, 2 Sides, 1Dessert - for two people. I was debating whether to spend $39 versus $45 to get more food, so the natural choice was to get the better deal and get more for what I was paying for. I'm Asian..

Someone ordered the Seafood Gumbo.. That looked good.. I think I should've tried that instead.. Salads are salads.. nothing special.\n\nI ordered the Petite Filet and my date ordered the same.. She also ordered the Mash Potatoes for her side.. I guess we should have coordinated or something, but we just kind of randomly paired up for the $89 deal and ordered without hearing each other. I ended up getting to try the Creamed Spinach - flavorful.. very delish!, and the Potatoes Au Gratin - cheesy and delish as well, but if I had more it'd be way too heavy.\n\nMy filet was perfectly cooked medium-rare this time.. Still kind of tough in some areas for a piece of filet. I've had better. It also wasn't drowning in butter, which I'm kind of glad about.. I like my steaks more simple.. black pepper and salt. My garlic mashed potatoes were chunky and tasty.. perfect.

Hopefully after this meal she will go back to home cooking without much hesistation.\n\nAlthough the average steak here will run you a little over two President Jackson's, you do get a hulking big piece of meat cooked exactly the way you want and as they describe it on the menu. The downside is that the side dishes such as potatoes, veg, are extra and upwards of $8 a plate. As of Saturday night their specials were wild salmon, chilean sea bass, whole lobster, Australian lobster tail, and a Kobe style steak (can't remember which cut) at over $60. Refer to my yelp review of Miyazaki Beef on what \"Kobe Style\" could mean...\n\nI shared a lobster bisque with my brother, who for this meal did not order his steak HHHHHHHHHRRRRRAAAAAAAREEHHHHHHHHHH\nlike at Le Charm (although he did get the T-bone). The bisque was one of the worst I've ever had. Practically no lobster flavor, the chunks of meat tasted nothing like lobster, more like shredded crab, and there was more cheap liquor flavor than anything else. Perhaps the version at Whole Foods would be a more worthy contender after having this.\n\nMy rib eye did come medium rare, and I swear the thing that caused me to have nightmares again was this melted butter thing on top that just sizzled into a puddle of oily goo on the side once the steak was left to sit on the plate for just a few seconds. Warning do not touch the plate.\n\nThe aged beef and quality, including the marination, is no doubt really good. However the greasy outer butter thing or whatever it is, kind of ruined my appetite for me. I have to say that as much as I love rib eye, it kind of pained me to cut away 40% worth of fat, although if I were 6 again  I'd eat this stuff first and even for breakfast without hesistation.\nDon't get me wrong, I don't mind butter added to my Benihana steak, or fried rice, but this amount of butter on this $40+ steak and then some, is like asking for a heart attack, a neck choke, a deep wedgie, an orgasm, and sharp objects scratching against a chalkboard at the same time, thus making it hard to enjoy the 2nd to last item.\n\nThere was a joke in the family about not coming back again in 5 years (since the first time was that long ago). But no thanks, in 5 years I'd rather go down the street to House of Prime Rib. Never failed me.\nSorry Ruth, unless your first name is Doctor, I'm not interested in the least bit.\n\nWhat really soured the dinner experience was the table next to us. After we asked for the check, and we had our plates taken away to be boxed, suddenly the guy at the table to our left was screaming bloody murder. Apparently one of the busboys \"misunderstood\" the meaning of \"getting the stuff to go\" and just threw down containers and bags.\n\nThe man scolded and lectured this busboy whose first language is not English (let's leave it at that), and instead of calling for the manager and his waitress, could not shut his trap at the poor sod. \"For this kind of money, YOU should be boxing this up, I can do this at home\" etc. Then the waitress gets a personal yelling \"why can you box THEIR meals (referring to our table) but not ours?\" Then the manager comes over, and this guy continues his sh*t fit. \"Get this outta my sight (referring to the food)\" and repeats the same lecture to the manager as he did with the busboy and waitress.\n\nThe table behind us and to our right starts to take notice and get annoyed. The dude behind me was on his date, turned to the guy and said hey stop ruining it for everyone. The complainer obviously didn't care and was ready to get the bill and get out (and never come back obviously). The madder he got, the louder he bellowed. Except he didn't turn into the Hulk, but an Ass.\n\nOur waitress, who waited the complainer's table almost broke down in tears.

And why don't they tell you on their website?  \n\nHere's why:  Apparently some chick named Ruth back in the day bought Chris Steak House in New Orleans.  She kept the name because it was bomb diggity.  One day there was a fire so she decided to move down the street.  But, and this is a big but, the purchase agreement said that Chris Steak House could be at no other location, so she had to change the name to Ruth's Chris Steak House.  So now you don't really pronounce it Ruth's Chris Steak House, you pronounce it Ruth's \"Chris Steak House.\"  Get it?  Good.\n\nRuth wanted there to be a steak house that served high quality prime beef steaks with great, honorable service.  And to be quite honest, I think she got exactly what she wanted.  This place is bomb.  The steaks are so yummy, I ate all mine.  And it came with shrimps in a wheel.  We also got the broccoli au gratin (mega cheese), and the lyonnaise potatoes.  Everything delic.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-01-29", "description": "Could you improve a waiter by drowning him in burning hot butter? Because it sure works with the steaks at Ruth's Chris.\n\nWhen it comes to steak, I'm a purist. Salt, pepper, then chuck that hunk of meat onto the grill. Burn it to make sure it's dead, then toss it onto my plate. Steak appeals to my inner hunter -- bloody and dead like I killed it myself. The steaks here are good. Better than I can remember any other time I've executed a cow in 6, 12, or 16 oz. portions. But these steaks aren't so much steaks as butter sponges.\n\n\"Careful, the plate's hot.\" That warning has never been warranted to my ears until now. I like my food hot, but Ruth's is trying to burn my taste buds or something. My rib eye came out on a small plate that was practically boiling with butter -- the steak was submersed in easily a stick's worth of butter. The plate is necessarily hot to keep the butter from congealing over the course of the meal. Unfortunately, the heat of the plate continues to cook your steak over course of the meal, and is also hot enough to scald your tongue if you foolishly assume that resting your utensil on your plate is a generally safe thing to do.\n\nNo argument, the steak is damn good, but I think it's primarily because of the butter -- something about seas of saturated fat appeals to your tongue like explicit porn to your dirty, dirty eyes. It's somewhat a smart idea -- the butter keeps the meat moist, juicy, and warm -- but a few of these steaks every month and you'd be starring in your own BBW porn. I could go on about the mediocrity of the sides and dessert, but honestly, we are Men of Meat. Talk of sides does not become us.\n\nFortunately for us all, the bang-for-the-buck here is so outrageous, visits once in a blue moon is the most anyone could suffer. What kills me here isn't the food. It's the \"decor\" and the \"service\" --- or what passes for it. When you're dropping \"upscale\" cash, you justly expect better than a diner experience. I can't speak for the other Ruth's Chris franchises, but I swear the Van Ness location used to be a cheap diner. Ruth's put up faux hardwood walls, but they skimped on a full remodel. They still have cramped booths and cheap acoustic office ceiling tiles. To complete the ambiance, big cheap speakers mounted flush with the ceiling tiles play loud 60's and 70's hits. Just what every fine dining experience needs: The BeeGee's.\n\nAs for service... first thing's first: they lost my dinner reservation. On a busy night, with a date, or a business meeting, this would have been more than embarrassing. We were seated by the bar, and apparently, this is where the wait staff kills their time, chatting about the guests. They were probably talking about us. Unfortunately, I couldn't overhear what they were saying, three feet away from my table all night, over the din of Barry Manilow and The Supremes.\n\nTo say the waiters were inattentive would be a disservice. They never once came to refill the water, but they did come over and ask if I wanted coffee, while I was still having my wine. They also did make sure to ask if I wanted dessert, while I was only half-way through my steak. At least we weren't being avoided. Multiple waiters came to the table, often interrupting each other. And on our way out, they were indeed nice enough to locate my scarf, which they misplaced when they put it into the coat check.\n\nI could just chalk up the incompetence to a series of bad luck. But I won't. Instead I'm going to blame whoever is their obviously blind and deaf general manager for delivering possibly the worst service I've had outside of fast food. Even in comparison to other diners --- Ruth's true peers --- at least the rude waitresses with the funny odors remember what tables are theirs. Go here for very pricey but tasty butter and steak. Do not go here with anyone else. They'll think you're an idiot. Unless they're one too. And then it's okay. Convince them to pay.", "author": "Perci N."}

Frankly I wouldn't because we have very good restaurants in the San Jose, but we had a $200 gift certificate. We vent there for my sister's birthday.  I knew that RC steak house has a great reputation and my expectation was set pretty high. We were at the restaurant July 27th 2014.\nReview:\nFirst of all, it is a pricey place.  The service was good and the staff was welcoming and polite. The d\u00e9cor was outdated and stuck back in 80s, but that doesn't matter much when you expect a great meal.\nFirst we ordered appetizers. I had a Caesar salad. The was so much dressing on the salad that green leaves of lettuce were drowning in and it was not crunchy. We then proceeded to main course, which were a New York steak ($48), gratin potatoes ($10) and sauteed mushrooms  ($8).  The gratin potatoes were over cheesed with yellow American cheese and potatoes were not cooked thoroughly. The mushroomed were tasteless, blend and rather boiled. Now, about those stakes.... First of all, I have asked for medium, but got rather medium rare cocked meet. The meet was rather a poor quality. It was woody and chewy.  For the price the charge I was expecting a better quality cut of meat. You can buy a steak like that probably at Safeway for $10. I want to finish on the positive note. When they have learned that my sister had her birthday on that day, they have brought us a very good desert for free, I believe. Like I have said, service and attention was good.  Overall: I would skip.  Quality of food and cooking skills were poor.

They have a tiny foyer, and it gets very loud out there while you are waiting, and there are not a lot of seats. I would say we waited between 30-45 minutes for a table, and in my opinion, that really sets the tone for the entire evening.

Thanks to Dine About Town my girlfriend and I were able to enjoy a great meal at a reasonable price.\n\nWe started with some warm, fresh french bread and probably the finest beef carpaccio I've had yet. The paper thin slices of raw filet were melt in your mouth tender and accompanied by garden greens and some white sauce.\n\nThe first course of the D.A.T. meal was a mixed greens salad which was identical to what was included with the carpaccio. Pleasant enough but nothing more than a simple, \"healthy\" start.\n\nAs expected the steaks were the highlight of the meal. I upgraded to the 16oz boneless ribeye and my girlfriend ordered the 8oz filet, both cooked to a perfect medium rare. The sizzle and aroma of the melted butter on the steaks is intoxicating. Few things can rival the flavor of a good ribeye, and this steak was no exception. The additional marbling in this USDA Prime cut of beef yielded an extremely flavorful, if not overly fatty steak. The filet was extremely tender and quite flavorful as well. Their signature melted butter is an excellent complement to both cuts of beef.\n\nFor dessert (which we hardly had any room left for) they served a moist carrot cake and decadent chocolate mousse. A sweet and satisfying close to a great meal.\n\nService was good overall. Our waiter was friendly and fairly attentive, though at times it seemed he was overextended among tables.

All of this for $49.95. HE had the fillet, broccoli and a salad + the same dessert for about the same price. Along with our meals, we decided to go all out and order the crabtini as an appetizer ($16). For drinks, I had the orange citrus mojito, he had a beer. \n\nFirst off, the crabtini was yummy, especially since it was made with huge chunks of fresh crab. Unless you're starving, don't get the seafood gumbo - it's VERY filling and you'll enjoy your entree more if you just get a salad. The steaks arrive to the table sizzling and straight from the broiler topped with butter & parsley. After first cut, I see that my steak is cooked EXACTLY how i like it, medium rare. After first bite, I fall in love. Perfect texture -- thin crunchy texture on the outside, perfect and juicy on the inside. Sides were just normal sides, nothing great. It's pretty pricey, but definitely worth visiting if you're a steak fan. \n\nTransportation to restaurant: there's a parking garage behind the place. They also do valet - but it's a lot of fun if you take the trolley in and very convenient since it stops right in front of the restaurant on California and Van Ness ($5 one way).", "author": "Melissa P."}

A couple of days later, my friend invited her roommates so I called them up and was able to easily change my res to 5 people, but got bumped to 8:15. NP!\n\nWe showed up at 8pm, a bit early, but was quickly seated even tho the rest of the crew wasn't here yet. We looked at the menu and realized that we needed to ask for the separate dine about town menu. \n\nSo all 5 of us ordered the 12oz ribeye. Some got mash potatoes, some got creamed spinach.\n\nAfter sitting around for maybe 5 or so minutes, our waiter came back and apologized that they ran out of 12oz ribeye and was replacing it with buffalo ribeye (really meant nothing to me...) and New York steak. I just went for the buffalo and called it a night.\n\nAnother 5 minutes later, he came back again to let us know that there's no more buffalo! So I just resorted to the 6oz filet that was also on the menu. Since I was just gonna pack half the amount of meat, I decided that now I room for bread.\n\nSalad: Nothing special at all. It was flat and hard to pick up. I wish I had chop sticks.\n\nCreamed Spinach: YUM. Full of flavor and still tasted kinda fresh.\n\nMashed Potatoes: YUM too, also flavorful.\n\nThe Meat: My filet came out a slight bit on the small side than what I've seen at other places, but it was simmering in herb buttaa. I cut a tiny piece of it and was completely WOWed. It was so tender, it's kinda like liver! (well..the liver thing was mostly on the outside). The meat at great heat and was slightly rarer than medium rare. It might be the blood, but damn it was juicy as hell. \n\nIt didn't get cold until the near last bite when I already have been yappin' away. I was so glad that they ran out of 12oz because this filet was already more than enough...and every bite was awweesome.\n\nKeylime Pie: Very tart as every keylime pie should be, portion was kinda big. It was soft almost pudding like. I couldn't finish it tho as my stomach started acting up. Eeps.\n\nOverall Ruth's Chris is a great place to dine. The staff is super professional, friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is sophisticated but relaxed. Service was great, despite the steak shortage. Definitely a place for me to come back to on the next special occasion. \n\nBest steak I've had in the city thus far!\n\nNow if I can only figure out why it is called \"Ruth's Chris...\" hm so good, maybe it's human meat!! \n\nJust kidding.", "author": "Faffy L."}

If the steak isn't cooked the way you want it, they are happy to re-do the steak for you, which is really nice.

We were seated in the back room and they had five tables at best with a ton of servers walking around.  \n\nI ordered the veal chop with a side of potato au gratin.  It was tender, juicy, but the lemon butter just tasted like butter.  The au gratin was good at best, but their sides were never spectacular (except the sweet potato).\n\nMy friends ordered from the set menu (not dine about town).\n\nTwo ordered the ribeye and the other ordered the filet.  The meat was cooked perfectly.\n\nTheir meal also came with a choice of a side, starter, and dessert.\n\nThey ordered:\n\nseafood gumbo-small shrimp, and needed more kick.  There wasn't much going on with the flavor profile.\n\nCreamed spinach-more liquid than cream and it needed salt.\n\nGarlic mash-that was nice and creamy, but not much garlic flavor.\n\nBrussel sprouts with bacon-the shining star of the night! It had a smokeless from the Bacon, and it was slightly sweet in a good way (we're guessing they prepared it with brown sugar).\n\nDessert:\n\nSymphony-dark chocolate bark embedded with toasted almonds and sprinkled with a bit of sea salt accompanied by a cheesecake.  I say accompanied because the chocolate was far superior to the cheese cake.  The cake was dense and didn't have the richness you'd think you'd get since it's so dense.\n\nCreme brulee-I was really disappointed that the shell didn't not crack with a tap or several taps for that matter.  My friend just stabbed it with the form afterwards.  No crunch = :'(\n\nChocolate explosion-molten lava cake topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  It's large enough for three people.  It was light, moist, and good.\n\nSo food gets 3.5 stars because the sides and dessert were hit & miss.\n\nNow onto the service.  I am considered the slowest water drinker out of my friends and yet I still managed to stare around the room and wonder where our server went.  Did she have a family emergency? Leave for a meal herself? Who knows, all we knew were that we needed our water refilled to make the butter food go down.  We asked other another server that walked by and she said ok only to never return either.  I noticed the table in the back was wondering the same thing.  Everyone was done with their entrees and thirsty.  There were plenty of servers, but only ours were missing.  I finally flagged down another server and told her we lost ours.  The manager came by and apologized and our server magically reappeared with no apologies.  I can sense she was upset.  Sorry Courtney, but you were gone for more than half an hour.  The other table that belonged to her was able to quickly leave shortly after her return.\n\nThe service here just didn't cut it.

I have particularly fond memories of ordering my first legal drink at an Outback in San Diego and then devouring their steak and potatoes with reckless abandon.\n\nUntil now.\n\nRuth's Chris has destroyed any appreciation or regard I may have had towards Outback. I have tasted the meat of gods, and I am not going back. Never again will I settle for a $30 steak meal. If Ruth's Chris had a Bloomin' Onion then I would have no need for Outback whatsoever.\n\nAppetizers: Crab cakes were buttery and melted away in my mouth. Scallops were AMAZING - make sure to eat the pesto with them - they're not the same without! And finally, I HATE calamari. Ok, not hate it. Strongly dislike. But not here. The calamari is fantastic. I may start becoming a calamari-holic and just go here for it as a happy hour eat.\n\nSteak: Generally when I order my steak medium well, it comes out brown throughout. I generally don't complain because I'd rather it be overcooked than still moo-ing. But RC actually got medium well done right with a little bit of pink on the inside! YES! The meat itself melts in your mouth and is served in butter, which completes the indulgence.\n\nSides: Hard to mess up a baked potato, but as someone who eats the skin, it's always appreciated when the skin is actually edible and doesn't resemble beef jerky. And their asparagus with hollandaise is also quite good - they give you way more sauce than asparagus so feel free to load up!\n\nGreat wine selection as well - we had the Silver Oak, and you really can't go wrong with a good Silver Oak cabernet. Good choices abound on the dessert wine/port menu, as well.\n\nIt IS pricey - expect to spend at least $60-$70 per person. And it IS a la carte - expect to order your sides separately from your steak. But I have to appreciate any restaurant that has enough respect for its main dish to let it stand as its own entity on the menu. The wait IS long - even with a reservation, expect to wait at least 30-45 minutes. But the bar is pretty accessable: my friends and I all got bloody marys, and they had a good strong kick to them. \n\nI am not well versed in upscale dining as of yet, but I would not recommend taking a sip of a bloody mary and then exclaiming loudly, \"Wow! This reminds me of being 5 years old at the Colorado River!\" \n\nThey were VIRGIN bloody marys, people, I PROMISE! Stop staring at me!\n\nMy childhood is gone. These days I can substitute Berryessa or the delta for the river if I want to go water skiing, but Outback is now nothing but a sad distant memory.

Hey, why could the waiters just offer that automatically?

I could not help to finish quite a bit.\n\n- The salad was just OK, quite small in portion, no character.  It's just like taken out from a packed veggie salad bag and add the little tomatoes plus dressing.  For a fine steakhouse like Ruth, I expect a better salad.\n\n- Both I and DH ordered the 10oz ribeye steak, medium well as entree.  The sauce was so delicious (of course, there were so much salt and pepper and butter) but the steak was a bit disappointing.  DH's steak contained a lot of fat and he cut out almost 1/4 of the steak size of fat.  Mine was leaner but I found it a bit overcooked.  I needed to really cut it with force and it's a bit dry inside.\n\n- We ordered creamed spinach as the side dish.  It's very tasty, soft but just too creamy.  Also, it's just warm not hot, most likely it's well prepared before, sat aside and be taken out to serve.\n\n- We tried key lime pie and bread pudding as desserts.  DH liked the key lime pie but I thought that it's too sweet.  The bread pudding, on the other hand, tasted plain.\n\n- DH ordered a bottle of bear and I ordered a glass of orange citrus mojito.

I chose the seafood gumbo (with fresh crab!), 6-oz. filet plus three shrimp, and green beans sauteed with garlic.  \n\nThe gumbo was good and the filet was pretty solid - tender, moist, juicy, and cooked to medium-rare perfection.  It could have used a tad more flavor, surprisingly, since I could see that it was sitting in a pool of butter.  I initially tried to save half as leftovers for the next day, but who was I kidding?!  My plate had nary a crumb left at the end.  Definitely stick to the green beans as your side if you come here.  Even though they were a little too salty, the sweet potatoes were too sweet, the mashed potatoes too buttery, and the creamed spinach was too thick in consistency to enjoy.  \n\nI switched out the chocolate mousse and carrot cake for the cheesecake as my dessert.

My friends and I were there for the Dine About Town menu, and I must say, it was one of the more worthwhile DAT experiences I've had.  I loved the fresh baked bread that arrived at our table along with the whipped-but-not-too-whipped butter; it totally made me almost too full to stuff all of my 12 oz. ribeye down (but I did since it was toooooo good to waste).  The first course of arugula salad with cherry tomatoes and balsamic vinaigrette wasn't anything to write home about, though it was a good appetite whetter (if the bread weren't enough).  \n\nWhat made my meal was, of course, the steak.  God, thinking about it now is making me salivate.  My medium rare ribeye came out still sizzling in a small pool of butter on the 500-degree plate.  The meat almost melted in my mouth - it was so tender and juicy.  I've never eaten the fat layer around steak before, but I found myself eating both meat and fat with equal gusto - that fat tasted wicked good.  (argh... still salivating over the thought...)\n\nI got the key lime pie for dessert.  It wasn't spectacular, but it's still a decent key lime pie.  After tasting a bite of my friend's bread pudding though, I have to say that I ordered the wrong one, especially for a cold winter's night.  That bread pudding was comfort dessert through and through.  Yum.\n\nWow, what an experience.  It was $58 per person - this includes wine, tax, and tip - but it was sooooo worth it.  I can't wait for the next DAT so that I can revisit Ruth's Chris.  I probably wouldn't go normally cuz it costs an arm and a leg, but I would 100% go back for DAT.  Yowza, what a deal!  :)", "author": "Diana C."}

I usually go to House of Prime Rib across the street, and going to Ruths Chris never really crossed my mind. My boyfriend had also heard good things about this place, and being partial to HOPR himself, he also had never really thought about trying this place.  So on a whim one day (withouth consulting Yelp, shame on us!) we decided to try this place.\n\nThe service was great, we were seated right away (we DID have reservations) and we were able to sit in a semi private booth towards the back. All the wait staff smiled and greeted us as we walked toward our seat. Once seated, we ordered the ribeye (for him), and the petite filet (for me). We also got shoestring potatoes and broccoli au gratin. Upon receiving the food, we weren't incredibly impressed like we were hoping. I mean, the steaks were definitely better than something you would get at Black Angus or Outback, but not $35-40 worth better. My steak was not tough but it wasn't as tender as I was hoping (and I got medium rare). The shoestring potatoes were crispy and over salted. The broccoli was more appealing to me than the steak (probably because it was covered in cheesy goodness).\n\nI'd say this place is slightly overpriced for what you get. The atmosphere is cozy enough and the wait staff friendly. If you're going to impress someone on a first date with steak (assuming it's their favorite), you may not want to come here (try Alexanders in Cupertino) but its worth at least a try so that you can judge for yourself (this place is either loved or hated, it seems).", "author": "Katherine P."}

That may be an unfair comparison, considering that the service we received in Hawaii, not to mention the food, was stellar.  \n\nFirst thing that struck me as funny was our valet.  Did his job, and did it well, but as he got into our car, he says, \"Have a good one, bro.\" Now I'm no snob, but I did work as a valet for several months out of the year for two years.  In the places where I parked cars, calling customers \"bro\" wouldn't get you fired, but certainly would affect your tip.  Anyway, no big deal, we got a good chuckle out of that as we sat at the bar waiting for our table.  \n\nOur booth was ready just as we finished our first round.  Great timing. \n\nWe ordered a fried calamari appetizer... No, not because we thought we were at TGI Fridays, but because that is the only seafood that my wife and I will eat together. Plus, a fried calamari at an upper scale restaurant piqued our interest.  Drizzled with a sweet and spicy thai sauce, it didn't disappoint.  \n\nBeing our cutsie selves, wifey and I sampled each other's steaks - my ribeye and her filet, both medium rare.  My steak was pretty damn good, but my feeling of contentment turned into a little bit of butt-hurt when I tried her filet.  It was PERFECT.  So from then on, although I enjoyed my ribeye, there was the little voice in my head saying, \"You should have ordered the filet, dumbass.\"  \n\nBut the sides, au gratin potato and creamed spinach, were to die for.  Those were a hit with both of us. Simple and delicious. \n\nWe ordered BR Cohn Cab, which paired very nicely with all of the courses.  Good wine, but pricey... DUH, I know, and I fully expected the ridiculous markup, but this was the BR Cohn Silver (about $12-16/bottle) at $16/glass.  BR Cohn Gold at BevMo is $50....  My advice, BYO and pay the corkage.  We didn't BYO because I only expected a million% markup, not a billion%.  Oh well. \n\nWe came close to finishing our steaks, but not quite.  We were absolutely stuffed, but that does not stop the good 'ol dessert upsell at the end of the meal.  \"Well, if your stuffed, we have some wonderful sorbet...\"  \n\nNO, you smoothly transitioning to the close bastard.

My first experience was fantastic, great service, great food, great atmosphere. Fast forward to Easter 2012. We arrived for our reservations around 4:30 and the restaurant was still pretty empty, but despite that our service was extremely slow. I have high expectations for restaurants of this caliber when it comes to service and they absolutely dropped the ball. When I have to ask my server for everything or make eye contact to get him to come over, you know it's not going right. Super attentive is what the description of service should be.. they were so inattentive it bordered on the line of being lackadaisical. \n\nThe food was ok. I ordered my steak well done and it still came out Medium, not even Medium Well. I am a trained chef, so I know the difference. They happily took it back to re fire it, but left my sides, so by the time my steak came back out cooked the way I originally requested it, my sides were cold and they didn't even offer to bring out new sides. For the amount of money that is spent, they should have immediately took my sides and steak to the back and brought both back hot.\n\nOur bill for a table of 3 was $200(inexpensive considering), and we still left the waiter a $30 tip despite his lack of service.\n\nI am definitely not impressed with the SF location, but I will revisit  Walnut Creek to hopefully bring back my original good feelings about this brand.", "author": "N B."}

Next time I'll call ahead for sure.  No matter, the bar had two seats open. The bar has full food service, so wait time was now 0, and I was happy to sit with Jose, the bartender.\n\nOn opening the menu, I noticed that it had changed.  Its been about 6 months since I've been here, and I was saddened to find out that they removed the Australian Rock Lobster Tail. That dish is incredible. They had replaced my dish with a less expensive Caribbean Lobster Tail, which is not quite the same, but actually works well on the menu.\n\nWhen you order the appetizers, please order the bbq shrimp. There is a reason its in red bold letters on the menu. Perfectly cooked shrimp nesting in a sauce so dangerously delicious that you will continue to sop up with bread, long after the shrimp are gone.  Sometimes I keep it around for the meal.\n \nI ordered the Caribbean lobster tail, which was nothing short of excellent - and its hard to follow the shrimp dish.  I also ordered the Petite Fillet, which was the perfectly medium rare and *insert deep sigh here*.  It cut like butter and just melts in your mouth.  I didnt need to season it. they use just the right amount of salt and pepper, and the steak does the rest. You can order this combo as a Special, and the tail is stuffed with crab meat too. My friend ordered the Special and he just about licked his plate clean.  (under $40 - no kidding)\n\nSitting at the bar was perfect. You have your waiter right there if you need anything at all. When our table did open up, we opted to remain at the bar rather than move.\n\nI've eaten at Ruth's Chris Steak House in several states, and it has been consistently excellent.

With the DAT menu you get a salad, choice of main course, side, and dessert. Sounds like a good deal (which it is) but there is just nothing exciting about it. So I ordered the stuffed mushroom appetizer and a side of sweet potato mash. Might I add this was shared with the whole table (I'm not that much of a hog.). But I didn't even have wine and my $39.95 DAT bill turned into an $80 contribution. The salad was alright (coulda skipped it), the steak was just a petit fillet drowned in butter, the creamed spinach was ultra rich... drowned in butter, and the bread pudding dessert which was really built up \"to die for\" was really bland. The stuffed mushrooms were barely stuffed with crab and also again drowned in butter. The sweet potato mash was really good though (sweetened with brown sugar, pecany, and drowned in butter). One of the dessert choices offered was out of stock so the waiter substituted my friend's dessert with THE TINIEST SCOOP OF ICE CREAM ever!!! It might as well been a scoop of butter. On our way out, I swear I saw that the table of two guys next to us had a dish of melted butter on the side for their steaks.

The four of us shared: the crab stuffed mushrooms (too peppery for me), seared ahi tuna (good sauce), the ribeye with bone (called the cowboy), the ribeye without the bone (both pieces of meat medium rare), potatoes lyonnaise (eh - nothing special and just tasted like fries), and the steamed asparagus.  John got a glass of really good red wine (I didn't catch the name) and I got a pom martini (it was delish!).  I thought the food was only ok.  While the portions are large, I was not impressed with the flavors.  Mimi likes the ribeye with the bone in it because she liked how fatty it was.  John liked the one without the bone because he said it had a more pronounced beef flavor.  You should pass on the two sides we ordered.\n\nWhat we all agreed on was the bread they brought out.  It was so so good!  I could eat that all day.  What was weird, though, was how the first loaf came out hot and crunchy, but as each loaf kept coming out (Meems loves bread), they were considerably colder and less crispy.  Maybe not enough time in the oven to warm up because we were chowing through them so fast?  Ridiculous.  Also, the decor was really nice.  We saw a lot of people out for a \"special\" evening.", "author": "Lynnie P."}

I came here with friends for Dine About Town after reading great reviews about Ruths'.  What I didn't expect was a butter overload.  If you like your red meat and sides drenched in butter, this is the place for you.  \n\nHere's the rundown: \n\nThe first course of salad was pretty standard fare, nothing special.  The presentation gave the appearance that there was a little more effort involved in preparation than just scooping pre-made salad onto a plate.  \n\nThen came the rib-eye steaks, which were all swimming in a pool of butter.  A little butter may accentuate the taste of the meat, but this was just overkill.  The amount of butter they used pretty much overpowered the flavor and the natural juices of the meat.  (To be fair, I found out afterwards that you can request your steak without butter.  It would have been nice if the waiter pointed that out while we were ordering.)  The sides, creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin, were also loaded with a buttery taste and the latter undercooked and slightly crunchy.  \n\nThe Key Lime Pie desert, decent, but it tasted like something I could have gotten at any ordinary bakery.\n\nSimply put: Ruth's came up short.  While an excellent value for Dine About Town, quality trumps value any day.  I was expecting more from an establishment of this caliber.  For the same price as Ruth's regular menu, I recommend that you head down the street to Bobo's and enjoy a much more satisfying steak dinner.  Bobo's has same comfy leather booths, is a little less uppity and they even have a clown on the wall that will share a laugh with you.

One thing that can be said of all these chain restaurants is that they are consistent, whether you are dining at The Palm in Mexico City, New York City or Las Vegas or at Ruth's Chris in Orlando or Cabo San Lucas.\n\nThey are all gimmicky to some extent, Morton's brings out raw slabs of beef for viewing, Ruth's Chris has the sizzling butter, The Palm has drawings of locals and cartoons on its walls, Smith & Wollensky for its older, gruff waiters, but of all these restaurant chains, Ruth Fertels, Ruth's Chris Steak House is the best of the lot.\n\nPrices at all of these restaurants are in the same range as is the grade of beef used, Prime, so how are they different, besides the gimmicks? I've found that the preparation of Ruth's Chris steaks wins hands down.  \n\nI've dined at 30+ different Ruth's Chris over the past 18 or so years and can honestly say that of all the steak restaurants, including independent steak restaurants, Ruth's is my favorite, and I am a pretty adamant chain restaurant hater.  In fact, our visits to Ruth's Chris started before they offered steak knives, that is how tender the steak is.  When steak knives were introduced years later we were shipped a set to let us know that they now provided steak knives for ones dining pleasure.  Steaks are seared cooked at 1800 degrees and with the exception of a few occasions, they have always been cooked to perfection, not bad after nearly 100 visits to this palace of beef.\n\nYes, the prices can be somewhat high, but you are dining on Prime grade beef, not Choice, or worse \"Good or Better\" grade.  This is not The Sizzler and one should be prepared to have to order each dish individually, such as sides, like the delicious Potatoes Au Gratin, full of cream and oozing with cheese.  Steaks are served nearly floating in butter, so this is not a place to have dinner at if you are on a diet either.  \n\nThe service at the San Francisco location is pretty consistent and cordial.  There are occasional specials as well, both on the menu and specially priced dinner combinations.  This particular location tends to attract the convention and tourist crowd, as I suspect that the locals head over to Lark Creek Steak at the SF Center, or other local steak houses, such as Harris'.\n\nThe banana cream pie is wonderful, but it is enough for two people to share, a must have, even if you are full.", "author": "Rafael R."}

Yes, you still have to pay for it, but it sure beats driving around and around on an empty stomach that's angrily groaning \"meaAattt.. MEaaTt..\" at every stoplight and stop sign.\n\nOnce we stepped into the restaurant, it was super packed. I'm not sure how the wait is when it's not DAT week, but it took us an extra 45min to be seated, even with a reservation. Luckily, our friend had gotten there a little early and we were able to squeeze in with him at the bar. We ordered a few drinks to kill some time. The two boys got their Jack and Cokes, while I, normally a Henny-neat girl, decided to try something new. The bartender recommended the Orange Mojito, which at first I was kinda iffy about, because everyone knows I only drink dark liquor and I especially dislike drinks that have too many flavors mixed in - they sound cool and fancy, but usually taste gross. So I asked if he preferred the Orange Mojito over a plain Mo- I didn't get to finish because \"Orange\" came out of his mouth without hesitation. I was sold. And lordy.. that was the best mojito I've ever had. I honestly have cravings for it to this day. I've scoured happy hour to happy hour in search of anything comparable, but to no avail.\n\nLuckily, we were then seated soon after, because I wanted to be coherent enough to taste the actual dinner portion of our visit. The three of us looked over the DAT menu, and since I had already done my research before going, I decided on the 8oz Petite Filet - medium rare, with no extra funny business (sauces and such). Like my drinks, I like my beef unadulterated, its flavor as close to its purest form. The two boys, being boys, decided to upgrade from the 8oz Petite FIlet to the 16oz Ribeye - \"Mo' Meat, Mo' Betta\"\n\nAfter we ordered, we started off with Bread and the Steak House Salad. The bread was warm, soft, and fluffy. SO GOOD. I think ate a whole roll myself. The salad wasn't really memorable but it allowed my stomach to warm-up for the main meat attraction.\n\nWhen our entrees arrived, it was like a symphony of sizzle, a Mozart of meat, just glorious gloriousness. I had to refrain from my usual cavewoman meat-eating tactics, and remind myself that tonight, I was a lady.\n\nI took my first bite of the filet and moaned. No joke; a slow motion, eyes closed, head back, shoulders slumped, hands falling, throaty, erotic moan. It was absolutely sublime. The only word I could think of to describe the meat: Butter.\n\n[After a cold shower..] So now that I've just relived that first-bite memory, I honestly barely remember the end of the meal.

Naturally, it was to my delight when my boyfriend suggested we have dinner there.\n\nWe started the night off right with champagne for him and a white peach Bellini for me. After we were seated, we were served one of my favorite parts of the meal: the bread and butter. Why b&b you ask? Because I'm a butter snob. Seriously. To me, there is absolutely nothing more delicious than a thick creamy slab of French butter on soft, warm bread. Heaven. The butter test is a very crucial part of my judgement of all the fine dining I do.\n\nAfter the butter of course came more champagne, which my boyfriend intelligently brought himself and coughed up the $25 corkage fee. Ouch, but whatever. Our appetizers included BBQed shrimp and lobster bisque. Both were excellent, although I wish they would have thrown us at least 2 more shrimp for what they charged for them. The lobster bisque was nice and smooth with lots of lobster bits in it. Manifique.\n\nMy bf got a rib eye, myself the filet minon, and we shared a order of potatoes au gratin. Both were fantastic, especially mine because it was slathered with lots of bernaise sauce. It cut like butter. Wow. I felt so spoiled. The gratin was good, but was on the heavier side and it needed salt and pepper, but that's okay. After I saw the huge baked potato and the broccoli gratin the people next to us had ordered, I wished that's what we had gotten. Too bad my bf won't touch broccoli. It's okay, I always end up envying my nieghor's food whenever I go out to eat anyways. It's to be expected from this little filly.\n\nWe rounded out the meal with fresh berries in sweet cream which was wonderful! Imagine the best vanilla pudding you've ever had in your life with a bunch of berries tossed in. After all that meat, fat, and butter, you couldn't pay me to eat chocolate. We also ordered a hot toddy which they made SUPER strong. After polishing off the bottle of champagne, it did us good, although I can never quite get used to the taste of brandy.\n\nThis moring we both woke up feeling like we had a hangover from all the good food/meat/butter we ate.

I was forewarned by all the yelpers commenting about the amount of butter this place uses but it still caught me by surprise! The salad was your ordinary salad but the vinegarette was very yummy! To end the meal, I had the key lime pie, which was one of the better key lime pies I've had. The tartness was just the right amount. I had some of my bf's bread pudding too and that was very good. But because of the amount of butter used, I'm minusing one star.\n\nAnd, I'm minusing two stars due to our incompetent waitress. Here's a few of the many things that happened: To get some straws, we had to ask three separate people (manager was the one that finally got us the straws)! Our waitress was really reluctant to let some of us change the dressing on the salad. For some reason she kept insisting we keep the vinegarette since it was the standard dressing (not sure why that really matters b/c it's not like they pre-mixed the dressing in the salad!)  Also, while she was taking our order, we asked for NO butter on the steaks..what did we get? Butter on the steaks AND two sides of melted butter on top of butter warmers!! I didn't know \"no butter\" translated to \"extra butter\".  I figure that for the amount of money I pay, the service should have been better than what we received. I was just completely annoyed of their service the entire night.\n\nOverall, would I come back here? Most likely not.", "author": "Sylvia H."}

Talk about developing a taste for blood.  \n\nThe first time I went to Ruth's Chris was in Honolulu, HI, and was EVEN better than the SF location.  But I think it's just because of the amazingly wonderful wait-staff that they have in Hawaii.  The past 2 years I've gone to Ruth's Chris for dine about town.  It's a great deal for an salad, steak, side, and dessert.  The food is MORE than enough and both times I've taken half the steak and half the side home to my boyfriend.  Their mashed potatoes are really delicious and a perfect complement for the buttery steak.  The prime rib steak....*gasp*....so good.  I LOVE when it first comes out, sizzling in the butter on the hot plate, screaming for me to take that first delectable bite.  We always end up spending a lot because we get wine, but it's so worth that once a year experience.\n\nCan't wait for next year!!!", "author": "Cindy K."}

Our server was really knowledgeable and friendly and let me sample different wines to see what I like. For my order I did the Ruth chris special I think, I cant really remember but basically it was a starter (soup) , appetizer (mashed potatoes) main course (6oz petite filet), and dessert (chocolate something basically like a big ass reeses pieces) for about $49 ish. I was already full by the time I got my dessert. Everything was delicious and I also tried my bf's 12 oz rib eye (YUM). The steaks here are slowly roasted and seasoned with salt pepper and garlic butter (i think). So you dont need a1 steak sauce lol and asking for one may be frowned upon.

The service was earnest, we could tell the guy was really trying, but he was not a real pro.  If you've ever had a professional server, you know what I'm talking about.  He wasn't able to give us answers to our questions beyond what the manual said, it was basically 1 or 2 sentences and we were looking for more detail.  \n\nThe tomato mozzarella salad was good, although it could have used more cheese (especially considering it cost $16, the most expensive tomato/mozzarella I've ever had).  The cowboy rib eye was too thin for my taste and the plate was too small to really maneuver anything.  I also wonder why a steakhouse that supposedly serves the most flavorful beef available in the U.S. , prime, would have to resort to piling on a half cup of butter to make it taste good.  Outback does that too, by the way.  \n\nThe asparagus was cooked perfectly but I like a little seasoning, this only came with a hollandaise sauce on the side.  The real standout of the meal was the sweet potato casserole which was covered in a pecan crust.  It was fantastic, I plan on trying to recreate it at Thanksgiving.\n\nOverall, try Ruth's Chris if you must, you will certainly get a great meal but if you want a truly outstanding steakhouse experience from a national chain, try The Capital Grille or The Grill on the Alley.", "author": "Ryan J."}

I make a reservation to be seated.\n\nYeah the meat is cooked with butter and yeah it's served to you on a 500 degree plate.  I was pleased with the quality of my filet (be warned - what they consider medium-rare here practically MOOs).  You can definitely tell the meat is good quality.  The spinach and mashed potatoes weren't super exciting.  I was a little disappointed in the key lime pie (my mom's is WAY better).  The wine list is extensive although if you're only looking to get a glass your choices are somewhat limited.  The service was great, and even though she was running around like a chicken (or cow) with her head cut off, our server did a nice job and was attentive.\n\nI guess there's 111 of these around the country now and they're looking to put one in downtown San Jose.

We had a table of four and choice the rib eye prime and a desert of key lime pie and bread pudding. First off, we were served a roll of bread and butter. There's nothing special about the bread, but the butter was so fluffy and creamy!  Next salad was served. Salad was your typical mixed greens from Safeway with Balsamic steak sauce and croutons. Nothing impressive. The steak however, was delish! Smoked savory to medium rare and oh soo buttery and garlicky good. The meat was grilled to the way i like it, pink in the middle and tender to the bite. The 12 oz morsel was more than enough.  Sides were also served between the options of spinach and mashed potatoes. I`m a fan of mashed potatoes, it was buttery and fluffy good.\n\nLastly, dessert. I shared a key lime pie and bread pudding. The key lime was good but not the best i've had. You could taste the citrusyness in the pie which is a good indicator, but it isn't strong.  The bread pudding was sweet and moist.

Arrived at 6:45ish and was seated about five minutes later. They gave us the regular menu and it took a while for our waiter to introduce himself, so that we could tell him we wanted the DAT menu. Strike 1.\n\nThe salad starter was okay - fairly typical. I asked for my balsamic vinagrette dressing on the side; it arrived on the salad. Strike 2. Luckily, it wasn't drenched in dressing, so I didn't make a fuss. We also ordered crab cakes as an additional app. Big o' chunks of crab, very reminiscent of my recent trip to Baltimore, so I was in heaven. The deliciousness factor helped us to swallow the $20 price tag for 2 small-medium-sized crab cakes.\n\nHubby & I both ordered the filet - I mean, we ARE at a steak house, after all. He ordered his medium-rare (it arrived more rare than medium) and I ordered mine medium/medium-rare (which the waiter suggested since I couldn't decide which I wanted and he assured me he could do something in between). It arrived more medium than medium-rare. Stike 3. Since we were hungry and it wasn't terribly bad (afterall, hubby could just \"cook\" his meat a little more on his 500 degree plate), we decided against sending it back. Both steaks were quite delicious and we devoured them.\n\nThe sides from the DAT menu - creamy, garlic mashed potatoes (divine) and creamed spinach (okay, but not great). Portions were good and I even had some steak and sides to wrap up for leftovers.\n\nDesserts - key lime pie and bread pudding. Both were delicious and had I not been so stuffed, I probably would have finished off the pie.\n\nNet-net, I'm really glad we finally got ourselves to Ruth's Chris and it felt so decadent to go out to a nice steak house on a random Tuesday night, but were it not for DAT, I probably would have given this a 2-star review.", "author": "Lynn H."}

We had initially come for the summer deal they were having, a 3-course meal for two for only $89.  However, the items that we wanted just weren't on the special menu, so we opted to go a la cart instead.\n\nI ordered the petite fillet and he had the ribeye, both with the bleu cheese crust and we shared sides of spinach au gratin and sweet potato casserole.  \n\nOur steaks were presented on 500-degree hot plates, sizzling with fragrant browned butter and topped with a golden, garlicky, blue cheese topping.  Our sides came in separate ramekins, nearly as hot as our meat.  The medium-rare steaks were melt-in-your mouth perfect, cutting into my fillet was like cutting through butter.  Both of the sides were delicious.  We both burned our tongues digging in.  It wasn't until our meal was more than halfway consumed before we were able to eat at a comfortable pace.  That being said, I totally prefer burning-hot steak to steak that becomes cold and gelatinous about halfway through the meal, which is generally what happens nearly everywhere else.\n\nAlong with drinks (I had a Kir Royale, he had a Mojito) our bill came out to about $160.  Not quite the $89 that we had initially meant to spend, but we both agree that it was well worth it.  I can't wait to return...I do have a birthday coming up in a few weeks...\n\n*funny story* I thought I'd mention that we were seated behind a couple that ordered chicken and fish.

But San Francisco's version is much classier, with a better bustle and butter smell than CT's could dream of.\n\nI used to wait tables at Morton's so I feel a little dirty when I even THINK of eating at Ruth's Chris.  But the simple fact that I could get Prime MEAT on a Dine About Town budget ...let's just say I HAD to deal with the funny feeling inside to revisit their Steaks and Wines.\n\nOf course, my dinner date and I threw the DAT menu to the side when we remembered how much better an 11 ounce slab of meat is (DAT offers a 6 oz filet), and how yummy ceasar salad is...you get the picture.  \n\nWe both ordered the same cut, although I asked for cold rare and he wanted rare +.  His was perfect, mine was very warm, but still red.  I mentioned it to the waiter, but had decided to enjoy the steak anyway.  I could deal with the extra ten seconds in the broiler.  \n\nOur lyonnaise potatoes were perfect, crunchy, not greasy, with nice moist fried onions mixed in.  We loved the whole crab cake on the filet (oscar style), it was pretty rich.  The sauteed spinach was a huuuuge portion, but really good - not too buttery and the leftovers made sweet love to my eggs this morning.\n\nThe hot chocolate cake was really large and really flipping good.  Because often these lava cakes have a sorta dry, gummy, or hard outer cake that NEEDS the lava/ganache to make it good.  Not so with this version, the cake surrounding the ganache was moist, bouncy and worthy of being eating sans liquid center.  \n\nI was most impressed with our waiter.  He was genuinely enthusiastic and geeky about wine (one thing I looooved about working at a steak house was the wine geekery instead of snobbery) and he made excellent suggestions, was honest when he didn't know something, answered a request for tastings openly, and even gave a wine we asked about a thumbs down that rang true upon tasting.  The wine we wanted was not available, but the replacement was similar and less money.  And stupid good.\n\nWill I go back? Maybe.  And for SF, that's a compliment.  And yes, come hungry, and don't be ashamed of taking home leftovers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-29", "description": "I absolutely love the steaks here. I eat steak quite frequently and have a few gourmet recipes of my own that are crowd pleasers; but Ruth's Chris always makes them the way I love: with lots and lots of butter. \n\nThis is not a place to eat at on a budget...like Gary Danko's or Morton's, you should expect about $100-$150 a person for a full course meal with a modest bottle wine. \n\nMy recipe for a great meal at Ruth's Chris is as follows:\n\n     1) Show up a bit early. Dress well. Get valet parking. Have a seat at the bar and have a cocktail while they get your table ready.\n\n     2) Once seated, order either some wine or another cocktail while you peruse the menu.\n\n     3) If you like big steaks, get the 9oz filet...if you like smaller, get the petite filet (5oz); I have always ordered the filet here and I have never been disappointed. They are served slightly charred on a red-hot plate of sizzling butter. YUM!\n\n     4) Order a side of potatoes au gratin and broccoli with b\u00e9arnaise. Note: the vegetables are normally served with hollandaise, but I think the buttery flavor of b\u00e9arnaise goes with the steaks better than the lemon. Ask and you will receive.\n\n     5) Make sure you get the steak at least medium...a meat of this quality is ruined by anything more done. If you don't like rare steaks, don't buy a filet. Filet of beef, like duck, should be served medium with a warm, red center. Overcooking shouldn't dry them out so much as change the overall texture and flavor. If you order any other steak (such as the prime rib or the NY strip), you are missing out on the main attraction. \n\n     6) Enjoy your steaks with a nice glass of red wine that is ordered WITH your meal. The staff is very knowledgeable about the local wineries and they go through frequent wine-tasking and wine-training events. I've never been disappointed when asking for a recommendation, even for a winery I've never heard of or with a varietal that one normally wouldn't pair with a buttery steak.\n\n     7) Order the cr\u00e8me brulee and an espresso with Bailey's and you won't be disappointed. The custard is served at room temperature, or sometimes warm, which I feel is the best way to enjoy cr\u00e8me brulee and the coffee with irish creme just hits the spot.\n\nThe manager should come by at least once during your meal to make sure everything is perfect. If it's not, they have always been friendly and courteous with remedying any problem.\n\nFinally, relax and enjoy the romantic atmosphere. I have never been rushed from my seat, even during the busiest of nights and have always felt like I had as much time as I need for my entire meal.", "author": "Jason H."}

I went with two co-workers on a Tuesday night. We easily found street parking, however, I was very much prepared to pay for valet as I often do in the city. \n\nWe arrived 15 minutes early due to the fact that there was no bridge traffic. They weren't quite ready for us, so we opted to hang in the bar where I got a drink. My two coworkers decided that the drinks were too pricey for them, so they just hung out. Sooo..boring!! Right about the time our reservations were for, the host came and took us to our table. Not bad at all!!\n\nWe all decided on getting the 12oz steak. I got the spinach. The guys got mashed potatoes. The bread came out...and OMG...it was great bread. Thank you for not serving sour dough. This bread was soooooo good!! Our salads came out right after that. Then our steaks and sides. I have to say, if you like it medium rare, order it rare. The plates and butter on top were so sizzling hot, that mine was almost over cooked. However, it really didn't bother me because the meat was very tender and buttery. I will remember to order it bloody next near. Then it will be perfect. The potatoes were great and my spinach was pretty nice. I think I would ask them for a different side with not so much cream next time. I think we could do that. \n\nFor dessert we had a choice between the Key Lime Pie (yumm!! A favorite of mine) and Bread pudding. Both of the guys got bread pudding. It was good, but they both thought it was way to heavy after the meal. They were kind of jealous of my pie. It was tasty. \n\nAfter all of the buttery goodness, I wanted to die.

Seriously. $35 for a salad, steak, spinach, and desert. Typically, that steak alone will set you back $35 at a restaurant like this. So I'd say go now...but DAT ends today, so...go next year!\n\nAs for the food, the salad was passable, the spinach was pretty great, and the dessert (key lime pie) is in the top-5 key lime pie's I've ever eaten (see my reviews from Key West, FL for more info). Anyways, the steak. I had a 12oz ribeye, which appeared to be much more than 12oz, but I'll take their word for it. It was in that \"Ruth's Chris style\" of coming in at 400 degrees with a copious amount of heart-clogging butter sizzling audibly. Which is kind of great, in it's unique way. I try to consider myself a meat purist, so that much butter was something I was a afraid of. But it worked. Maybe it was the temperature, but it wasn't just some steak with butter on it. It was steak where the butter went THROUGH it. It baked itself into the meat. Which made the meat wonderful, if not a little less than pure-steaky in taste. But really, I ate the thing in record time, it was excellent.\n\nBefore the meal, I had a tanqueray martini which was standard and perfect, if you're sitting there in a suit jacket and trying to look more sophisticated than you are.\n\nSo, a couple minor knocks on the place. Our reservation was 8pm, but the word is out on the DAT menu, and there were TONS of not-so-Ruth-Chris-type people there looking for a deal (ourselves completely included in this group). But yeah, our reservation was for 8, and we weren't seated until 9. On a Monday night. Still somewhat unacceptable. Also, they seated us at an audibly-challenged booth inside the bar area, which isn't what you'd hope for in a nice steak house. Not the best ambiance I've ever seen for a Ruth Chris for sure.\n\nNevertheless, they were accommodating and the actual service once seated was pretty good. The food was fantastic.

The only service snafu was a good 20 minute wait between ordering and the appearance of our appetizers- with no acknowledgment from the server. \n\nThe food: Crab cakes were absolutely awful. Not only did the crab taste \"canned,\" (oily, mushy, etc) but there is clearly a fair amount of filler in the cakes and the whole dish becomes a greasy, mushy mess. For $20, skip it.  The steaks were, I'll admit, OUTSTANDING. Having not tried the butter on steak combination I was weary, but really, I didn't find the butter to be overwhelming. I thought it made the meat even more tender and delicious. The petit fillet was large enough that I took over half home for the next night's dinner.  Creamed spinach was better than average.

I was armed with my $100 gift card and new knowledge and ready.\n\nGetting There:\nCome night of (Thursday night, 10:00pm res),we arrived 30 minutes early, found easy street parking right in front of the restaurant and were seated immediately.  Our server, Chris, was super charming and really excited about his steak.  After his schpeal on their million degree ovens and molten hot plates (or something like that), he mentioned a special of hash browns (no thanks...I reserve those for McDonald's or Denny's), opened up the wine bottle we brought in and let us decide on what to order.  \n\n\nFood:\nWe started out with the BBQ shrimp and caesar salad, then I ordered the Filet medium rare and my fiance ordered his cowboy rib-eye oscar style and medium rare. We also ordered the creamed spinach au gratin. \n\nThe shrimp was pretty good.  Next time I'll try the crabtini or the crab stuffed mushrooms. The sauce was good but didn't knock my socks off. I will say that the shrimp was cooked perfectly, not rubbery at all.\n\nMy Fiance's rib-eye was huge.  The sides were falling off the plate and it was topped with three asparagus spears, a crab cake and bernaise sauce.  The steak by itself was basically perfect. So tender and yummy.  The sauce and crab cake added another dimension.  The crab cake itself was delicious, mostly crab, not a lot of filler. His was cooked a tad more to the rare side, but it was only bleeding, not mooing, so it was all good.  My favorite part was this sexy seared crust that covered the entire outer part of his steak.\n\nThe star of the evening was my filet (sorry, fiance) which made love to me the whole time I was eating it.  No feakin' joke. With the first cut into the crust that revealed the yummy, buttery perfect medium rare-ness of it all to the moment I put it in my mouth (ha), my eyes were rolling into the back of my head and I was enamored. Perfection.  The thing is huge and I probably could have gone for the petit filet, but that would have meant no succulent left overs to devour the next day.\n\nOne note: I could taste the butter in the air at this place, but my filet didn't come swimming in a pool of it, neither did Fiance's rib-eye.  It was there, but wasn't drowning the meat.  I don't know...maybe the chef decided to spare our cardiac health, or maybe these two cuts don't come with as much butter as others do...hmm...\n\nThe spinach was yummy.  You can au gratin anything and have yummy results: potatoes, corn, tater tots...but I digress... it was a good side.\n\nSee...we came here with a plan, which was to eat steak and have dessert (well, that was my plan), so that's why we didn't order any potato dishes.  For dessert I had the creme brulee with a double espresso and Fiance had the cheesecake with a coffee.  \n\nThe creme brulee was like a small pot of creamy heaven with a granulated sugar crust.  The crust didn't have that fun \"snap\" when you break into it, but it lay atop the most delicious vanilla bean creme that I'd ever tasted.  Sooo worth all the calories. Do it.\n\nFiance's Cheese cake was the size of...of... it was huge.  We could have shared, but I don't like to share.  I like to steal bites of other people's desserts while devouring my own.  it was also delicious. I loved the sour cream sauce on top and the crust was perfect!\n\n$$$$:\nEverything came out to about $180 without tip.

Both pieces of meat came out sizzling hot on heated 500 degree plates, done just perfectly with I think butter and herbs sizzling with the steak on the plate.  It was absolutely delicious.  Both meats were generous and thick. I don't think I have had such a yummy piece of meat in a long time.  We don't usually eat steak but maybe a couple times a year if even that.  Our sides of mashed potatoes and saute brussel sprouts with bacon were also super scrumptious. I ate up all the brussel sprouts and had a big chunk of meat to doggie bag home.\nThe dessert that night was just fair in my opinion.  It was a duo dessert combo of chocolate peanut butter cake with whipped cream and caramel sauce and a mixed berry combo topped with cream.

Both steaks were prepared perfectly.  They had as much flavor as they did butter, which is a LOT.\n\nOur waiter recommended the New Orleans style hash browns as one of the sides.  It was a giant plate of hash browns, which tasted like mashed potatoes sauteed in a skillet.  It was a bit bland for my taste, but complemented the steak perfectly.  We also order some asparagus with hollandaise sauce, which tasted like, well, asparagus.  It's pretty hard to ruin a boiled vegetable.\n\nAs for prices, they're pretty high, but reasonable for a steakhouse of this caliber ($40-50 steaks, $7-10 sides, $8-12 salads).  Our bill with tip but without alcohol was $170.\n\nI wanted to try the banana cream pie for dessert, but my sister wisely talked me out of it.  I am sure it would have been delicious.", "author": "Yan G."}

Dare I say that? I think a lot of people equate spending cash with greatness and don't discern between some really quality ingredients. I had their filet, creamed spinach, and scalloped potatoes. \n\nThe sides were gnarled up in heavy cream with a ton of salt. I'm not salt sensitive, but what was going on here was like a tv dinner side. Why do many spots load their dishes with salt? It's a masking of cheap creams, cheeses, overcooked items, etc. \n\nThe filet was very tender and I do not recommend that anyone order it rare because they're fearful of it becoming medium or suggestions that you go medium if you want your well to not be overcooked. Both of our plates were hot, but did not cook the meat up a whole notch of wellness. The meat quality was not incredibly impressive in comparison to other moderately priced restaurants. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice, but nothing to rave about and honestly I'd say that you'd have better service, food, and overall dining experience at the House of Prime Rib.", "author": "M M."}

Knowing that I can get good quality steak, service and sides for a reasonable price at Harris, I definitely would not come back.\n\n*************************\nUPDATE on 3/11/2008\nOk, so had to go there again for a family birthday dinner, and I really do try to like this place, but it just doesn't impress.  The salads are nothing exciting, and very standard.  The fried calamari was really greasy and way too much batter.  Definitely not my favorite.  I had the new york strip medium rare.  It was cooked just fine, but it really didn't have enough flavor to it.  And can they please provide steak knives that actually cut???  Seriously, you can barely cut with their knives... maybe they think you don't need super sharp knives b/c their meat is supposed to be tender.  But that definitely wasn't the case.  I had to work hard to cut my meat!  The sides are not memorable at all and ridiculously expensive.\n\nI must say the service was really good, and our server was super nice and very accomodating.  Since we were celebrating a birthday, they gave us one free dessert!  First off, their desserts are monstrous, so plan on sharing!  So we had the cheesecake and the molten chocolate cake to share with 6 people.  The cheesecake was fabulous!!  I would seriously considering just trying to order the cheesecake from there.  So delicious!  The molten chocolate cake was ordinary, but good.\n\nAs I've said before, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.  Not bad, but there's way better elsewhere.", "author": "Mai S."}

So I FINALLY dined at Ruth's Chris last night to celebrate our post-Valentine's day dinner and also to see what all the hype was about.\n\nI was suprised to see alot of people dressed so casual...like t-shirts, shorts, and sneakers? I'm thinking.....these folks must've been tourists. We waited 15-20 min. for our table even though we had an 8pm res. That seemed to be the obvious case, since there were alot of people in our same situation standing around. That didn't bother me so much cuz we happened to run into one of my best friends there. What a co-in-ki-dink. ;)\n\nMoving on.....we got seated in a comfy booth in what seemed to be the main dining area. Our helpful server (Cyndi) comes to tell us all about their specials and their famous USDA steaks etc. Yumm!! We start off with their complimentary bread & butter, which I have to mention, cuz they were sooo warm and crispy outside with the soft goodness inside. Ughh, I'm such a bread lover. It's a love/hate thing, I tell you. \n\nNext came our calamari, which was sooooo good. The roasted red peppers gave just the right hint of sweetness in the background. I must say, probably the best calamari I've had so far. (wow...that's a pretty bold statement) For our sides....we had the sauteed spinach and the potatoes au gratin. The spinach was horribly salty, bathing in a boat of butter juice. It might as well have been salty spinach soup! The potatoes au gratin was rich and cheesy, but good. \n\nWe both had the Rib Eye which were cooked perfectly to our liking. Very tender and soft, but to be honest, not tasty enough to be worth $42 each. Even though we were STUFFED, we couldn't leave without having dessert. Now that put us over the top! The Banana Cream Pie tasted so sinful. We couldn't help but smile at eachother while eating it....it was so bad but so good. \n\nAs usual, we had a great time and will come back to have the Petite Filet instead, but probably no time soon.

So we went into the bar which is tiny. There were a lot of people in there so it was hard to find a location to stand where we weren't in someone's way. We ordered drinks which were really good but super pricey. 4 drinks - $58 OUCH. At least it was a good martini. \n\nOnce we were seated the service was good and the atmosphere was nice. Dim which is always nice for dinner. It was a packed house, so obviously the place is popular. I ordere the filet cooked medium. The girls and i decided to split the sides so we could try each. The steak was very good, awesome flavor and cooked perfectly. Dinner salad was good, mashed potatoes good, the spinach NOT very good at all. It had a gamey flavor which was weird...I'm not a fan. The Key lime pie was REALLY good. \n\nOver all it was a good experience but I don't feel it was worth anymore than we paid.

The first thing that you'll notice about your steak when it comes to you is that it's drenched with butter and it's piping hot.  The fact that it's drenched in butter makes it very delicious, but you can't help but think that this masks the overall flavor of the actual cut of meat.  Of course it tastes good, because there's so much butter!  The temperature of the meat is the best part.  It's served on a super hot plate, which will burn you if you're not careful, which makes it an awesome experience as each bite tastes like it just came off the grill.

I ordered it medium and when I cut into it, my plate filled with blood. Don't get me wrong, I will eat carpaccio and am not easily fazed by pink steak, but I asked for it medium. I actually had to trade with my friend who asked for medium rare as his was way more cooked than mine. The flavor was mediocre. Let's put it this way- my dad's George Foreman cooks a better steak than this.

It was well portioned and quite tasty with the sweet and sour sauce and the roasted red peppers.  \n\nI had the 6 oz filet and my husband had the 12oz ribeye.  They cook it perfectly to what you request and it is served on plates that are heated to 500F so the meat is sizzling and remains heated your plate... or at least there is never a congealing factor before you finish.   We estimated for slow eaters maybe by 90 minutes the oils might congeal.     We shared the spinach which was a little too creamy and the mashed potatoes that was butterlicious.    \n\nI loved the bread pudding especially the liquor'd up sauce.  The key lime pie was good too.  We made it a point of eating the pie first 2' tartness before the sweet pudding.... yum yum yum....   \n\nI would go again for Dine about Town, I think for regular prices it is a little more expensive than it is worth.

The filet mignon was EXCELLENT!! I have never had a filet mignon like that (or maybe I'm just a butter lover), or I was a bit tipsy from all the wine.  My brother's rib-eye was so-so, according to him.  Ruth Chris also has really good wine selection.\n\nAside from the ultra good filet, the salad was average.  It seems like they used over the counter dressing.  My dessert (bread pudding) was way too sweet.  I was not able to finish it, and I can eat a cinnabon with extra frosting!!!  My brother's Key Lime Pie was average too.  But yes, their filet mignon alone earned them four stars from me!  I will definitely come back if I ever want filet mignon.

Street parking difficult but we lucked out and found a parking spot right on Van Ness within 20 yards of the front door. Score !  Never had been here before. We had a dinner bet and the winner got the free dinner after having selected the Giants in preseason to win the World Series. The restaurant seems a bit small upon first entering. We were immediately seated on that rainy night. I selected the Classic special which included dinner course, I chose a ribeye, soup or caeser salad or my pick, the apple-walnut-blue cheese salad, a side dish, I selected the  button mushrooms(6) on the side and a chocolate desert($52? without tax and tip)  The steak was medium sized, about .75\" thick and comes with butter on top(not necessary imo) and it was super tender. Salad good, dessert was a chocolate cake with peanut butter mousse and whipped cream on top, a winner.. We had the crab stuffed mushrooms appetizer which were tasty. Bread was a sweet french on the smaller loaf side and I must admit I expected sourdough being in the City. Service was excellent throughout the meal, but when we hung a bit after paying the bill it would have been nice to get some add'l water re-fills but no one returned for that service. My buddy wanted french fries with his steak which was not a choice on the sides and that was $3 extra. I thought the mushroom side, which was drenched in butter, just OK. One guy ordered potatoes au gratin and it was SALT city.  The key lime pie was really good, and not a wedge, you got your own little pie.  Another winner.  Brought along two bottles of Cabernet which they allow with corkage fee.(Didnt catch the cost for that) Bathroom was really nice. Overall a nice dinner but I am just not that into steak houses which overall are good not great imo and seem way  too pricey when I have bought  and cooked at home something just as good if not better for far far less. I guess at this point when I go out to dinner I want to eat something that I cant easily make at home. Oh the total bill was $525 for 6 without any bar drinks.

It's very old school.   It's one of those steakhouses on van ness that look like they've been there since 1910 . the place probably isn't that old but it has the rich dark leather and the brass and the wood that give it the old-world restaurant feel.  \n\nI can also see where the fixation came from because the 40 dollar fixed price meal is well worth it.  A nice appetizer.  She chose the corn/crab soup and I chose the Italian bread+green salad.  both were nicely presented and prepared but perhaps a little salty.  The whole meal was basically butter and salt but you don't go here for a healthy meal.  We both chose the same entr\u00e9e: the 6 ounce filet with shrimp . the waiters will warn you that the plates come out of the kitchen around 500 degrees so don't touch them.  The filet and shrimp come still sizzling on the plate, that's how hot the plates are.  The shrimp is spicy and tastey.  The filet is buttery, soft and smooth.  The dessert is a combo of berries and an unusual chocolate cake selection.  Not my favorite chocolate cake since it's not very chocolatey... seems a little coffee-flavored actually.  The wine list seemed pretty nice as well.  I chose the special wine (not on the list) by the glass and it was more than adequate although not a stand-out.  Which is to be expected, I guess, for a wine by the glass. \n\nOverall, a definite must-try place if you like steakhouses, especially those located in the pac heights and van ness corridor.  it's an adequate addition to harris', bobo's, and house of prime rib.", "author": "dan h."}

The employees were really friendly, which didn't make me feel intimidated since the restaurant was pretty fancy.  \n\nSince it was our first time at Ruth's Chris, our server explained to us how they cook their steaks and how it is served (on a hot plate to keep the steak sizzlin' when it reaches the table).  I ordered the prix fixe menu that came with a starter, meal, a side, and dessert. For starter, I had the corn chowder soup and it was delicious! It was really creamy and thick, just the way I like it.  For my side dish, I chose the mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes were also delicious.  It had the right amount of butter and herb. I tasted a hint of garlic in it too, but the flavor was just right for my taste.  And for my main course, I had the petite filet cooked medium.  The steak was literally mouth-watering. As cliche as it sounds, but it was really cooked to perfection.  I loved that the outside seemed well-done, but when you cut open your steak, you can see the pink color and the juice of the meat.  (I'm getting hungry just describing the steak!) The meat is very very tender and really really good. \n\nI don't remember how the dessert tasted, because I was so satisfied after eating my steak. But I do remember leaving happy from Ruth's Chris, so I'm guessing it was also yummy.\n\nThey also have a bar here. I tried their citrus mojito and it was refreshing.

It is a hospitable retreat, especially when chilly outside, and your steak comes sizzling on a 400 degree plate. Service was attentive here. Both myself and my partner ordered the Cowboy ribeye and we were not disappointed. The steaks are more than enough for 2 people in themselves. This is just plain good steak and the flavor is awesome. Ordered the sweet potato caserole, which had brown sugar and pecans on top, maybe some vanilla hidden inside the sweet potato...it was just awesome. The plate was still sizzlin halfway into meal. This restaurant is pricey...paid $130 for 2 steak dinners with one side and no fancy drinks. But you can't compain...the steak is worth it!

My experience at Ruth's Chris last night made me inclined to create a Yelp account to save future diners from having the same experience as myself.\n\nTo note, I've eaten here on at least 4 prior occasions- eating both off of the a la carte menu as well as the dine about town menu.  This review is for the dine about town experience.\n\nTo begin, we were 15 minutes early for our 7:30 reservation and had a seat at the bar.  At 7:40 I checked on our reservation status at which point I was informed that they were still seating 7:15 tables and we were at the top of the list for the 7:30's.  At 8:05, we were brought to our table.\n\nOur server was fine, but certainly not what I'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nWhen it came time to order, my girlfriend opted for the $39.99 Chef's Menu with the Filet and Shrimp as her entree.  I selected the $49.99 option with the Ribeye.\n\nThe salads were delicious.  Delicious enough to earn the 2 stars I've given.  When the steaks came out the experience, for me, took a turn for the worse.\n\nMy Ribeye was so incredibly tough and chewy that it was profoundly difficult to even cut through.  I've eaten ribeyes here before from the a la carte menu and this simply wasn't Ruth's Chris quality steak.  They clearly ordered inferior cuts of beef to serve as part of their tasting menu.\n\nFrankly, I feel taken advantage of.  Perhaps if you're not willing to take a shave off of the margin of your ribeye, don't have the ribeye as an option.  Or at least give the customer a heads up that they're not receving the same quality cut that they may have experienced in the past.\n\nConsidering the other quality steakhouses in SF (Harris', HOPR, etc.), this will be my last time at Ruth's Chris.", "author": "Jim W."}

Our steaks literally came out sizzling on the plate just like as the waitress described. Ordered two sides, fresh broccoli and the lyonnaise potatoes. They were both pretty good. The kobe beef was very tender but of course it can't top the kobe beef we had in Japan. My ribeye was decent. It was juicy but not as tender as I thought it would be but very flavorful. The proportions was just right. I was able to finish my ribeye and we finished our two sides. He had to pack his kobe back tho.\n\nFor dessert we had their speical the molten chocolate cake. pretty good, not too sweet just how i like it. I love how molten chocolate cakes are topped off with the ice cream. The cold ice cream and the warm cake mixed together just makes my taste buds jump all over the  place.\n\nGreat experience overall.

This makes a super tender, buttery filet that melts in your mouth and blows any other steaks out the water. Oh, and they also add a couple fancy little tasty shrimps on top as well. The mashed potatoes are deliciously creamy and the sea food gumbo makes a great appetizer. I've also heard a lot about Ruth's Chris's Potato Au Gratin, but haven't given it a try yet. Next time for sure. Always be careful and watch your hands when they serve you, as the plate comes out sizzling. Wash this all down with a tall glass or two of red wine and you got yourself a 5 star meal! I would also highly suggest you to make a reservation before coming in and if youre wondering, there is also valet parking in the front. If this doesn't fit your budget, no worries, keep your eyes out for the annual dine about town specials. You'll be able to get deals on various resturaunts around SF that can save you a pretty little penny.\n\nI've also tried the Ruth's Chris in Fresno, Ca(Sadly, it is a chain). No valet there, but the steaks are equally amazing and the venue is a little bigger.", "author": "thai n."}

The other thing was that the service wasn't the best, even though the waiter was very friendly and try the best that she could.

The interior of the restaurant is quite nice, dark wooden walls, dim lighting and comfortable booths all give it a nice ambiance.  Right when I sat down though, the person seating us told me flip flops are not allowed in the restaurant.  I understand the restaurant states a casual work attire, but I say men wearing a T-shirt and jeans and even shorts.  So to talk to me about my flip flops and how inappropriate it is in the restaurant, a little difficult for me to excuse them and let it go.\n\nThere was a lack of service till the check came, then the service picked up a little which was a little annoying.  As for the food, over priced and not even close to what I expected it to be.\n\nFor the appetizer, we ordered the fried calamari which was a little too sweet everyone.  For the entree, I picked the lamb chops with Au Gratin potatoes and sauteed mushrooms, while the friend got a fillet steak with the cream spinach and garlic mash potatoes.  I had requested the lamb chops to be cooked medium rare and it came to me practically fully cooked.  There was a lot of fat on the lamb chops and some parts were even burnt.  The Au Gratin had a decent flavor, but they sliced the potatoes were way overly thick to enjoy.  The fillet steak was not even warm but close to being chilled when I tried it.  The cream spinach was bland and as well as the garlic mash potatoes, which was also a little thick and chunky for my taste.\n\nOverall, I expected a lot more quality from this place especially at the price they charge.", "author": "Kamui K."}

About a dozen other people were also waiting. I don't care how busy it is, a reservation means you shouldn't have to wait, or go to the bar and start drinking before your food. However, our waiter was friendly and helpful with my special dietary needs.\n\nThe food was good but not great, considering the price and the wait. My cocktail (Hemingway Daiquiri) was the platonic ideal of cocktails taste-wise, but the ice wasn't fully crushed which made it seem cheap. The menu seems to cater toward a very non-San Francisco taste, since it's a chain I suppose, with very greasy, potato-y, or cheesy sides, and butter on the steaks which is completely unnecessary. Butter on a $70 kobe ribeye? Is that really necessary? Sugar and pecans on the \"sweet potatoes\" (which I'm pretty sure was actually yams) -- also not necessary.", "author": "Erica M."}

Other than Alexander's (which I refuse to go to because I do not like some of the investors), I have been to most of the better steakhouses in the area like Morton's and Harris'.  Even so, my favorite steakhouse by far continues to be Ruth's Chris.  \n\nThere's nothing particularly special about the appetizers. The salads are decent and the seared ahi is pretty good, but obviously people are here for the steak so that's what my rating is based on.  Man, and what a steak it is!  My favorite cut is the ribeye and it's FABULOUS.  Sure, the prodigious amounts of butter may have a little something to do with it, but frankly, that's a cheat I wish more steakhouses would use. Ribeyes are already a nice fat cut of beef, but the butter just elevates the entire steak.  Moreover, I like how the steak is served on what is essentially the American equivalent of a sizzling platter (I end up holding my napkin up protectively over my face and clothes like I would when ordering anything teppanyaki).  That extra sear seems to make the steak even more tasty.  However, because the sizzling platter continues to cook the meat, I would recommend that people order their steaks one degree less well-done than they would typically prefer, and to turn the steak over after a few minutes.  I've also had the filet, which I didn't think was nearly as good as the ribeye, but I'm partial to ribeye so to each their own. \n\nThe sides here are pretty good.  Their garlic mashed is also topped with a crapload of butter, making it even richer and more delicious. The vegetables were run of the mill but the bread is great. It's french baguette-ish, always nice and hot, and absolutely perfect for sopping up all that steak/butter juice.  I don't think I've had a single good dessert here but I've found that the steak is so good it doesn't matter.  I do recommend getting a big steak, even knowing you won't finish it, because the leftovers are nearly just as good and it's such a great feeling to know you have an awesomely decadent lunch in your near future. I usually ask the waiter to pack the bread as well and I don't care if it does look sheisty, so there!", "author": "Tammy L."}

This is the kind of place where you can always take a date, have a client meeting, or gather with friends and KNOW that you will have a good meal.  It's costly enough to be fancy (as everything here is ordered a la carte) but not pricey enough to make you hesitate.  The wine list they offer you with their huge selection of meats is excellent - - huge variety of reds, a fair share of whites, and wines from every region you could imagine.\n\nI suspect that a significant percentage of the world's butter is consumed by this chain of restaurant, or more accurately, the patrons of this chain restaurant.  Combine the overly generous use of butter with a good quality hunk of meat, and you have yourself a good American dinner.  Ordering a la carte is totally my taste, too, as many times, what I want on a menu is accompanied by something I don't feel like eating on that particular day.  At Ruth's Chris, you pick whichever side you want, be it a baked potato with the works, or creamed spinach, mushrooms, fries, or what have you.  It's then served \"family-style\" and portioning is usually large enough to feed two people.\n\nTwo cocktails, then two orders of meat, one side dish, and one bottle of wine for two people will usually run you approximately $100 per person, assuming you order a $70-$80 bottle of wine.  \n\nEvery Ruth's Chris always offers a Chef's Special for the evening.\nWhat one does NOT do at Ruth's Chris, is stray from the regular menu, in my opinion.  I've ordered the Kobe Wagyu Steak here, and also had the regular Ribeye Steak - and their regular Ribeye was just as good, if not better, than what they were calling their Wagyu.  While I don't doubt it was imported from Japan, it occurs to me that ordering Kobe should be reserved for the fancier steakhouses, such as Cut in Los Angeles, Alexander's or Delmonico's, or even Del Frisco's in Las Vegas, which served up one outstanding Kobe Steak.  At Ruth's Chris, I'd suggest you stick with their regular menu, and if you want the high-end steaks, go elsewhere.  The extra $25 you pay here to get a Kobe beef steak is not worthwhile.  Their Filet Mignon, Ribeye with Bone-in, Porterhouse, and even the New York Steak, which is usually my least favorite cut, is quite delicious here at Ruth's Chris, and is ALWAYS served exactly as requested, or is redone immediately, should you not like how it's cooked.\n\nThe ambience of the place is such that one might assume the dress code to be business casual or higher.  In days gone by, Ruth's Chris had a stricter dress policy, in my opinion, but with the emergence of the higher end steakhouses, they seem to have relaxed considerably on this.  You can pretty much come here as dressed up or down as you like, though I'd definitely recommend wearing long pants and any shirt with a collar of some sort.\n\nIn my mind, on some nights, there simply is nothing like a juicy steak with a great glass of wine -  and for this purpose, Ruth's Chris always fits the bill.  If you have not been here, definitely try it out.  For this particular San Francisco location, note that there is valet parking in front for $10, and there is a bar at which you can wait for your table.  I'd highly recommend reservations as this place is usually packed, second only to House of Prime Rib up the street where your wait will be even longer.  It's good food, good ambience, and with the right company, always a memorably good time.", "author": "Grace K."}

Maybe its because I'm a fatass... or maybe its because I'm a sucker for anything with butter in it (Paula Dean is my culinary hero), but the butter basted steak was excellent. The sides were just as delicious, and the appetizers were great ways to start off the dinner. \n\nGoing down the list of things I had... \n\n- The gumbo was well seasoned, and had the right amount of spice to make it tangy but not leave my tongue burned for dinner. \n- The seared tuna was fresh, still rare in the middle and melted in my mouth like butter. It was a very light appetizer but the seasoning was just ok. \n- The potatoes au-gratin was flavorful and chunky... a great accent to a steak dinner if you ask me. \n- The creamed spinach is possibly the most surprising dish, as I am certainly not a spinach lover by any means of the imagination. This one was flavorful and smooth. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. \n- The ribeye was GREAT. I got this with extra butter... just to give my heart something to work with. DELICIOUS!!!! \n- If the ribeye was GREAT, then the cowboy ribeye is in a category of its own. I can't describe how butter and a big cut of meat fits, but if there was a marriage of epic proportions, this would fit the bill.

In particular, the Cowboy Ribeye (priced at $47) was the most tender and flavorful Ribeye I had ever enjoyed.\n\nThe overall establishment itself is relatively upscale.  The atmosphere is clean, sophisticated, and inviting.  The attention and service was good, as was expected from a pricey establishment. \n\nWe went on New Years Eve 12/31/08 when there was a special of a $39.95 entree which consisted of stuffed Lobster Tail and a smaller cut of Filet Mignon.  The Lobster Tail was a complete let down.  There was no freshness or sweet taste from the lobster meat.  \n\nA tip to people that want to enjoy delicious Lobster Tail, I would recommend going to Costco directly and buy their frozen lobster tails, frozen fresh/wild caught Honduras Lobster Tails - now those have flavor!  The filet mignon was good, nothing special to note.\n\nI took off 2 stars because I was very disappointed that our waitress pushed the sides as if we were supposed to order them.  Now I'm not sure if you are required to order them, but after ordering the Cowboy Ribeye with a cost of $47 for the entree itself, which was large and satiated my appetite, I did not appreciate the hard sell of over priced sides.  \n\nIn this case we felt inclined to order mashed potatoes and mushrooms.  None of them were worth the hefty price tag for sides (they say you are supposed to order them to share family style with your entree).  \n\nOverall, the Cowboy Ribeye was by far the best Ribeye I had ever laid my hands on, but the expensive sides proved too much of a rip off in my eyes.", "author": "Edmund Y."}

There are enough reviews, so I'll focus on my wonderful adventure. Took a crazy cab ride from my hood from a guy who just did not want to be driving that night. It's basically a $5 cab ride. Except the guy claimed to not know where it was and I didn't bring the address with me. I say it's around Van Ness and California, which was a good guess. Cabbie mumbles something which actually sounds like an address and shoots off. I'm looking for the address on my phone, so I'm not paying too much attention to his driving. Until I start sliding from side to side as this guy swerves around cars. These aren't cars stopped on the side, he's driving like a maniac flying in between other cabs. Isn't there a cabbie code where they don't cut each off? Or more like guidelines... Anyway, after a little while looking down at my phone, I have a splitting headache. It's my version of being car sick. I tell him what the address is, and he says he knows. Uh, a minute ago he said he didn't know. And somehow he magically conjures the address? WTF? So obviously that doesn't please him and he speeds up. Going down the hill on California to VN, he basically bottoms at several intersections. Finally pulls up to the corner. And he becomes all nice. Ya, here's a tip for you crackhead....\n\nSo on to RCSH. Though my head was still aching, not letting that get in the way of stuffing of my face. The DAT menu is the same as last year. Not because I was there, but because it still said 5th Annual. First course was the salad, nothing special. Though I do recommend the remoulade dressing. Second was a 12 oz ribeye, 6 oz filet or some chicken thing. Obviously not getting chicken. They were out of the ribeye, but the waitress said we could substitute a 12 oz buffalo ribeye. Compadre ordered the filet. Typical meaty goodness. I had the buffalo with the blue cheese crust. Not bad, but not a ribeye either. Also comes with a choice of mashed potatoes or creamed spinach. Dessert was key lime pie or bread pudding. The key lime pie was nice and tart. The bread pudding was good, though barely lukewarm. \n\nThis location is on par or slightly lower than others I've been to. Our waitress was wonderful and gave us really good service. I'm bad at remembering names, but she was good. \n\nBut, while we were waiting for our table, the hostesses and some staff were chatting. Which is fine, but they were talking about going out and this and that. Not in soft voices either. Then as staff changed the table and wiped the glasses and silverware of finger prints, which is a nice touch, again they would be chatting. That's just annoying when it's the adjacent table. I really don't care to hear about your plans for later and why you're trying to convince someone to hang out with you and your friends.", "author": "The Sock S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-09-06", "description": "The first really great steak I had in a restaurant was at Ruth's Chris around six or seven years ago. Since then I've eaten at many more restaurants and come to realize that their steaks are only pretty good.\n\nThe first thing to note is that their steaks are \"wet-aged' versus dry-aged. Wet aged is cheaper b/c the cuts of meat are sealed in a plastic bag, and let to age in their own blood and juices. This also prevents any loss of edible meat. In dry-aging, the meat is hung in rooms at certain temperatures and humidity. After a month or so of aging, the outer layer(s) of the meat are cut off. People say the flavor is greater in dry-aged than the mushy wet-aged meat.\n\nSecond, they use a crap load of butter to top off and during the grilling of your meat. There are few things that won't taste really good if you use that much butter. You could take an Outback ribeye, and tell them to use one stick of butter in the process of the cooking and you would probably get similar results.\n\nTo be fair, the steak was grilled as ordered (but hey, it SHOULD be at any restaurant) and the meat does come out with a nice seared exterior and juicy interior (if ordered medium-rare, rare, or black&blue). \n\nSo why only the three stars? I think there are better steakhouses out there with better cuts of meat and slightly lower prices. Alexander's in Cupertino might not be cheaper, but they do have dry-aged beef, and their non-steak dishes are more varied.", "author": "Cary W."}

WHY do you have to pay $8.50 per side? basically, the main entrees here come w ith nothing but your steak, and u pay another $8.50 per side that you order. now i usually wouldnt complain about paying $8.50 per side, but their sides are not good.\n\nchocolate duo & creme brulee- very good. the chocolate duo was pretty much a brownie desert you can get at any restaurant. however, the creme brulee was made very well. very soft, creamy, and smooth.\n\noverall, service was good and the wine the server suggested was good too. and even though the food was good, it's still overpriced.  for the four of us in my family, our bill came out to about $375, and i thought it should have been between $200-275 at most. \n\nplus for valet parking considering it is in the city, even though it is 10 bucks. \n\nhowever, i do want to try other locations (vegas and southern california), because i hear that those locations are up to par.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

I visited the Kailua-Kona Ruth's Chris in 2007 and I must say I'm disappointed of the rating for the SF chain. I do believe they deserve a better average rating. For those who truly had an awful time I feel bad for you guys. I honestly believe a person is not just paying for food or drink, but for the grandeur of it all.  People pay lots of money to eat here and to celebrate here and to enjoy fine dining here and if you have a problem, they really do try to accommodate to your needs because they understand that without your good word of mouth they lose business, reputation, and, of course, money .  If you really don't like what you're eating, speak up to the staff and they'll get you WHAT YOU WANT! It's great!\n\nThis restaurants serves extremely well corn-fed beef, fresh fish and seafood, and a variety of things for different palates. But this steak house definitely knows their beef! They know how to correctly sear meat to keep the juices in and to correctly cook meat to the desired temperature. If anyone has ever attempted to make beef as juicy and tender as them its me! I've tried many a-times but its that 1800 degree oven that I lack. I've never had steak made to my liking as well as they do it. In fact, because of all the extra butter I put on my Petite Filet, the roasted tomato that came with my dinner, cut the heaviness of the meat and made a taste sensation that was food-gasmic!! The acidity of the tomato was so perfect with each bite of the steak, that every time I put it in my mouth my tongue salivated just a tad bit more to have all those flavors coat everywhere inside my mouth . Truly amazing in flavor contrasts! I felt the same way every time I took a bite of their sauteed mushrooms. Each time I chewed the mushroom it would release a wonderful aromatic mushroom juice. OH IT WAS SOOO DELICCIIIIIIOOOOOOOOOUUUS!!! Now, my husband, Jon, disagrees with my rating because he feels the other dishes like seafood and chicken were average. But I'm not going to a steak house for other things I'm going there for their steak.  So my rating still stands. As for sides, the unhealthier the better. As for desserts, creme brule is my top choice with the custard slightly warmed (Jon doesn't like it this way but ate most of it), extra sugar coating and extra berries. \n\nThe service is impeccable. The general manager runs a tight ship there. They understand the importance of notice to small detail and aid in making memorable dining experiences for their customers.\n\nI recommend reservations a day in advance at least for the weekends and a price consideration of $80-$120 per person on an average night not including their summer promotion of $89 per two people.", "author": "Bern R."}

SF was having a Taste of the Town, where participating places had pre-fix Menus. Sadly they didn't make reservations but accepted walk ins, so at 500pm, as soon as they opened, we were there to put down our names.\nWe were promptly seated. The place has an old boys club feel to it, and the lighting is dark. The Prefix menu had 12 oz ribeye, and that was what all of us ordered, we had it topped with a blue cheese breaded topper (to me it was too salty, with not much blue cheese, I'd skip this for the additional 3.00). My friend ordered the potatoes/cheese gratin as an additional side dish, I'd skip this as well since the meal was more then enough with the side dishes that were included. Their drinks were great, I ordered the Lucille Merlot, and my friend has an Orange Mojito which was refreshing and very non-alcoholic in taste. The side dish or potatoes and spinach were both good and buttery. The steaks were heavenly and they were marbled nicely. Dessert was a choice of either Lemon Pie, or Bread pudding, both were lightly sweetened, and very good, sadly I only had room for one bite. Our waiter Josh was very nice and came back to refill our glasses and drinks. The establishment was very friendly and gave us wonderful service.", "author": "Tulie L."}

So as we were driving over the Bay Bridge, we started to look on yelp.com to find somewhere to go for a great dinner. We called Ruth's Chris and they gladly took our name. When we arrived the place was not very full but it was almost 10:30pm. Our waiter Josh was great and very helpful because our party never been there before. Josh explained how the steaks are cooked and what kind of beef they use. We took his recommendations and never looked backed. \n\nMost of the party had the petit filet mignon course and everyone was delighted. I tried something else--I had the fresh fish course which was wild Alaska salmon. It was outstanding.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-02-01", "description": "Along with Scoma's lunch, this place is the best value for your buck when you order from the DAT menu.  Luckily, we were able to get some great reservations at the last minute and squeak in under the wire to take advantage of the menu.\n\nThe decor is not much to talk about - basically, dark wood, dim lighting, private booths, and wine cabinets- the place just screams masculinity and steakhouse.  We were seated at a booth next to the waiters' station, which made for some interesting eavesdropping during the dinner.  \n\nWe started off with the house salad, which unfortunately came a little too dressed.  There was a heaping glop of the vinagrette in the mixed green salad, which overwhelmed the delicate greens.  However, it did come with the best croutons I've ever had - they were probably deep-fried in beef fat and butter.  \n\nI got the 12 ounce petite rib-eye, medium rare, with the side of creamed spinach.  The ribeye came screamingly hot in a plate of melted butter, but the creamed spinach was closer to room temperature...not that it stopped me from devouring all of it.  My rib-eye was a little too fatty for my taste - I left about a 2 ounce portion of fat and tendon on the plate.  Though the steak was perfectly done when it first arrived at the table, it started heading towards medium by the time you were done, from the heat of the plate.  That made the steak a little tough, but overall, still one of the best steaks I've ever had.  Some of my tablemates ordered their steak with the bleu cheese topping - it was delicious and the mildest bleu cheese we've ever had.  My dad got his steak Oscar style, which meant a crab cake, 3 spears of asparagus, and bernaise sauce on top of the steak.  Delicious, but I'm not sure if it was worth the extra $14.  What was worth extra money however, was the pecan crusted sweet potatoes - what a fabulous side.  I've never had such yummy sweet potatoes, though some might say its a tad too sweet, with the brown sugar pecan topping.  Though my tongue was singed after having my first burning mouthful (cause it was HOT from the oven), all I could say was 'Omigod! this is good!\"\n\nFor dessert, I got the key lime pie - wow! wow! wow!  The best key lime pie I've ever had and the whole table wholeheartedly agreed with me.  They gave a GENEROUS slice of pie and it was a slice of heaven.  Foodgasm right then and there.  We were underwhelmed by the bread pudding though, but it couldn't help but be overshadowed by the kick-ass key lime.\n\nService was a little off (water and bread basket not being re-filled, despite requests; our leftover desserts being smashed together in a takeout box) but our waiter was nice.  Overall, a great place to eat and treat the folks out.  I'm not sure that I could have afforded this place without the DAT menu, but I'd certainly try to come back here and at least get more of the sweet potatoes and key lime pie.", "author": "Angela H."}

The restaurant was elegant and their waiters and waitresses, even the bus men were very sophisticated and their service was incomparable.  Not only that, their steaks were unrivaled to any other steakhouse I've had the chance to dine on.  If you want a recommendation I would say to have the fillet because it is exquisite, although the new York was fantastic as well. You definitely cannot go wrong by choosing either.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-04", "description": "I've been here a few times and can honestly say that Ruth's Chris Steak House serves the best steak. Believe it or not, you don't even have to use A-1!\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nOn VanNess, it is certainly hard to find parking. My recommendation is to bite the bullet and pay the $10 for valet. The restaurant's interior is dark and formal. It has a bit of a stuffy feel to it. I expected to see the place populated with old white couples, but instead, there was quite a mix. (Oldies were probably at Sizzlers).\n\nSERVICE:\nService was very good. They were very understanding that I got lost and was 40 minutes late. They kept our drinks full and did not judge us (on the outside) when filling up our bread baskets 3 times. Our waiter was very nice and polite and described in detail how each meat is cooked (rare vs. medium rare) and brought out our food quite promptly.\n\nMENU:\nI've been here for a regular dinner before (and the menu was chockful of great cuts of meat and other stuff), but this time, I went for Dine About Town. We were allowed to choose from 4 entrees (rib-eye, filet, chicken or lobster), 2 sides (mashed potatoes or creamed spinach) and 2 desserts (key lime pie and bread pudding). The salad was fixed.\n\nFOOD:\nReally good! The bread was great and they served it with moussed butter (as opposed to block of ice butter). We also ordered the fried calamari and scallops for appetizers. The calamari was very good even though it didn't have a dip. The scallops were disappointing as they had no taste. The salad was iceberg, arugula and baby lettuces with cherry tomatoes, garlic croutons and red onions. It was just OK - nothing special. The steak was great and exactly how the waiter described it. I was bummed I wasn't able to finish it. Darn bread!! For a side dish, I got the mashed potatoes which looked boring but were really creamy and savory. The creamed spinach was very good as well. I would recommend the mashed potatoes but only by a hair. The dessert was excellent! (as they always are). The bread pudding would have been 10x better with vanilla ice cream. The key lime pie was fantastic. It was very tart and creamy. My mouth is watering as I type.\n\nVALUE:\nHad we skipped out on the 2 appetizers, it would have only been $31.95 which is incredible being that a filet alone would easily cost that amount. I love Dine About Town. Rumor has it they are having another one in the Summer. Keep your eyes peeled.\n\nOVERALL:\nGreat!! I felt fat and gross afterwards, but when do I not?? I had been craving meat for a long time and with everyone on their New Years diets, I'd been frantic looking for someone to go with. What luck that a friend asked me. It has completely satisfied my craving. Yay Ruth's Chris!! Ruth rocks at making steak and owning a Chris!", "author": "Alice H."}

When I got my food back they added what was missing and returned me a well done steak instead of a medium rare steak. I sent back the food again being very polite, the waiter took my plate with the steak and sides that I placed on the plate along with all of my utensils for what ever reason. Now I didn't have my food done right twice and couldn't eat anything while my fianc\u00e9e food wad getting cold.

It came out on a very hot plate which I accidentally touched (OUCH!  Make sure you don't touch the plates right when they come out!).  The filet had a huge piece of melting butter on top of it, which made it realllllllllly good.  However, if you eat as slow as I do, by the time you are half way done with the meal the butter would start to re-solidify on your plate, which is not too appetizing.  Our table ordered the shoestrings and spinach au gratin sides to share.  The spinach was good, but nothing spectacular.  The shoestrings were very addictive, it was like eating bits of (expensive!) potato chips.\n\nA few of my friends ordered the rib eye, and they were disappointed with it.  It came drenched in some kind of sauce that was pretty salty.  \n\nFor dessert we ordered the chocolate molten cake, which was delicious!

However, last week, we had made a big party reservation for 10 adults and 2 children to celebrate our grandmother's birthday.  The location of the table where they sat us was so close to other tables that some of our family members had a hard time getting out of their seats to use the restroom.  Disappointingly, when we ordered drinks for our 3 and 8-year olds, the waiter said they had run out of kid cups...we had made the reservation a week in advance, specifying that we had children with us, so this was very disappointing.  Furthermore, when our 3 year old started playing with his Thomas-the train, one of the waiters came and asked us to stow away the toy as it was making too much noise and was distracting other customers.  The toy was not even loud and our 2 waitresses did not even care, until this one snubby waiter came to have us take it from our child.  After stowing the toy away (which was the only thing that made our boy stay in his seats, our boy started to go around the table to the other family members.  We then saw the same snubby male waiter  giving our boy and our table a very unprofessional and rude look as he followed our boy with his gaze while shaking his head.  We were waiting for him to approach our table again so we can confront him, but luckily he didn't because we had just enough of him.  They didn't even have coloring books or anything for children that you would expect.  Totally not a kid-friendly restaurant at all!\n\nThe service was poor and very slow, even having been assigned 2 waitresses.  A couple of times, we even had to wave at them because the service was just taking such a long time.  The waitresses/waiters were not friendly at all that night.

The ribeye did smell good though (probably due to the butter) and the spinach side was creamy and enjoyable. \n\nThey also changed the dine about town so that instead of giving each person a dessert, it was a dessert to share between two people.

I've been to a good amount of steak houses and I would say that Ruths Chris rib eye is top notch.  They flavor is always full and the texture melts in your mouth most of the time.  I've been satisfied with my rib eye 99% of the time I've eaten here(there was only one time where the rib eye was chewy for some reason).  However, yes like all the other reviews say, the restaurant does drown the steaks with butter, so before you order you should request that they use little or no butter when cooking your steak.  Also, I don't understand why people complain about the prices... at any high end steak restaurant you should expect to pay the same prices.  If you want save a few bucks and still try a lot of dishes, then go with a group of 4 or more.  The reason is because many of the appetizers and side dishes can be tried and shared by 4 people(creamed spinach, au gratin potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, etc.).  And you can get one or two bottles of wine instead of buying by the glass which is expensive.  If you are cheap and really don't want to pay the high prices then I suggest going to Ruths Chris in January during the Dine-About-Town(if they have it in your area).  That way you can get a complete meal for less than $30.  That's about half the price of what you would normally pay.  And you can't complain about the Dine-About-Town menu because you get your choice of their two best steaks, a rib eye or filet mignon, along with your choice of appetizer, sides and choice of dessert.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...", "author": "Dean S."}

When our bill arrived they had taken my husband's steak off since he didn't touch it, but they charged us for  a $60 bottle of wine!  The waitress insisted that was the one we ordered.  They adjusted the bill and I demanded a $50 gift card from the manager for the terrible service.  \nWe decided to go back one last time in the hopes that it was just a new server or an off night.

The food is always amazing when I go to Ruth Chris no matter in what area I'm in. The problem I had was with the service. One must remember that this is a high end restaurant so naturally I expect some things to be up to expectation. When we first walked in the hostess looked like she had just rolled out of bed. She had no makeup and her hair was a literal mess. It was in a messy pony tail. She looked like she just didn't care. We were finally seated and the bus boy asked us what we wanted to drink. When we told him what he wanted he apologized and said he could only take water orders. (regular water or sparkling) He was embarrassed about this. I felt so bad that Ruth Chris cant even allow their bus boys to take a drink order. The thing that bothered me the most was that the most annoying was that the waitresses were gossiping on the floor. There must have been some kind of issue either in house or with the customer because the ladies were talking about it and rolling their eyes when they would walk past each other. This was annoying! I have dined at many Ruth Chris' and this is the first time that I was just annoyed the entire time.

Robert was our wait person and asked who's B'day it was since the reservation made said we're celebrating b'days. It was one of my best friend's partner's and my b'day so he wished us a Happy B'day and took our drink orders. When he gave us our drinks, he left and did not return for another 6-7 mins. We really appreciate that because since only 1 out of the 4 of us has ever been here, we had wanted to look at all the stuff they had to offer and I really don't like to be rushed. When he came back, we ordered 2 Cowboy Ribeyes, 1 160z Ribeye and 1 12oz Ribeye, an order of crab stuffed mushrooms, creamed spinach, mash potato and steamed broccoli. The steaks arrived on hot plates and smelled delicious. I ordered my Ribeye rare which is the only way I eat meat and it was perfect. The creamed spinach was just as delicious as the ones that House of Prime rib is known for. The mash potato was creamy and yummy. They were even able to make the steam broccoli appetizing. The crab stuffed mushroom was worth every penny, crabmeat was spilling over the mushroom caps. All conversation ended as we devoured our steaks and sides and it was like a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner you make at home when you want everything to be just perfect, this dinner was perfect. As if that wasn't enough, Robert came by with a plate w/ a mini chocolate mousse cake, ice cream w/ drizzle and a fruit cup w/ sweet cream sauce and a candle to wish us a Happy B'day. It was a wonderful surprise and very classy of Ruth Chris. Mike(the manager) came by to check on us and we assured him the food and service was top rated. Yes, it is very pricey to eat here but the quality of the food and the service is really second to none.

It started with a mediocre salad which was a bit plain for my taste but whatever. Then, came the 12 oz ribeye along with the mash potatoes. I ordered it to be cooked medium and it came out just right. I think I would ask for it medium rare next time as they did such a good job. The mash potatoes were money. Very fluffy and smooth. I tried some of the cream spinach that the girlfriend ordered. It was good but left this somewhat dry taste in my mouth. Maybe cuz it was spinach and it always does that for me. Otherwise, I liked it. For dessert, we shared a chocolate cake which was very rich and not bitter for a dark chocolate. I personally didn't care for the cherry sauce but the chocolate did complement the strawberries very well. The ambiance was very nice and dim lit. It was a bit loud for my taste plus there was a crying baby sitting two booths behind us. Our waitress was very friendly and we were more than happy to share a bit of our wine with her. \n\nOverall, I can't really complain about the food.

Almost got the 8 oz filet but 12 is bigger than 8 (though both steaks are plenty big).  The rib eye was awesome and not super chewy as rib eyes can sometimes be, probably the best one I've ever had.  Deliciously buttery.  I almost ate all the fat too (eww).  Be careful of the 500 degree plate they serve it on.\n- Wonderful, memorable, fresh-baked bread.  Our table of six got two full loafs and they refilled the baskets 2 more times without our asking.  Came with perfect butter that wasn't solid, but wasn't super whipped either... just the right texture.\n- Creamy mashed potatoes on the side.\n- Very affordable.  Was a very filling 3-course meal including wine for $50.  Shockingly cheap for such a good steak.\n- It's a small thing, but I really liked their mints.  They're those kinds that just melt in your mouth.  Everyone in our party grabbed multiples on the way in and the way out.\n\nLESS SPIFFY:\n- Neither the ambiance nor the service blew me away.  I liked the fancy silverware and it was a step above Outback, but wasn't near what I've experienced from other high-end steakhouses.\n- I alluded to it earlier, but there's a LOT of butter on everything.  You can really feel it a few hours later.\n- Wasn't as big a fan of the creamed spinach side.  It just tasted like plain spinach.\n- Dessert was surprisingly unimpressive.  I tasted both key lime pie and the bread pudding and neither was bad but neither was that great either.  I'd prefer a trip to Marie Callendar's over these desserts.\n\nI don't know that I'd pay $100 for a normal trip, but for that amazing steak, it's a steal during Dine About Town.", "author": "Wayne K."}

Okay, here's what's great ... the food is rich and most dishes are wonderful and flavorful, all but the chopped salad that was kind of greasy and lacked pizzazz.\n\nWhat else was good? The staff accommodated my request to turn down the music so I could hear my guests. They advised us well when we ordered. And they seemed friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nBut this is a place of contrasts. Here's what wasn't so good. I think they're understaffed, they could train staff better, and they're disorganized. It took a long time for them to take our order and we had to wait many times so the meal took well over four hours. After they take your order, staff disappears and like too many places, they don't make eye contact with other customers when they're in the room so you can't get their attention. It took way too long to order between courses. Some items arrived without the stuff that needed to go with them, like getting dessert without them taking a coffee order for the full table, or coffee arriving without a spoon or cream and sugar. When I eat out, too often staff doesn't realize that customers are helpless to help themselves because we don't have access to the kitchen or supplies, utensils and such, and it's a drag to wait for this stuff when you want to enjoy your meal.\n\nMy other gripe is we had a party of 10 and the table seating wasn't conducive to visiting with each other. It was a long table instead of a round one. I would never have thought that a problem until I realized I had to take breaks and wander around rather than visit with everyone next to and across from me. I guess they have long tables, butting several small ones together because it gives them flexibility for seating and probably maximizes capacity, but that's just not the best for a party where you want to visit as well as eat.", "author": "Gary S."}

We are both huge fans of steak and had been wanting to come here for a while. First off, let me say, the service here is impeccable, everyone is really friendly without being pretentious. That being said, there is a bit of a uniformity to it that kind of shows that this is a chain restaurant where everyone has been trained strictly in the same fashion. However, the courtesy is much appreciated. \nI started with the Caesar salad which I found very tasty. I did find that the salad was a little heavily dressed but it does come with two large undressed leaves that when cut up and mixed in with the salad evened everything out. Next we got our steak, potatoes (mashed and baked) and creamed spinach. The steaks are definitely tasty but here's the deal, they douse these suckers in butter, I'm pretty sure you could cook almost anything and add a stick of butter and it would be pretty tasty. The mashed potatoes were great but I made the mistake of getting cheese on my potato and the cheese formed an almost impenetrable crust on the top which definitely deterred from my enjoyment of the fixins. For dessert we got the chocolate \"duo\" which sadly hit the wrong note, there was something off about the cake, almost like it was still raw batter, while the pot de creme was reminiscent of boxed mousse mix. However, Ruth's Chris is not known for their desserts and when it comes to what they are known for, their steaks are nothing to sneeze at.

For sides we ordered the shoestring potatoes and baked potato. They were good, but unless you're really hungry, just go with one side to share if theres two of you.

I looked at my filet mignon and thought to myself, how the hell am I going to get full of this tiny piece of meat. I guess with a lot of bread and mash as fillers. My fault for ordering the filet. I ordered the filet medium rare, but it turned out more medium than rare. The filet was kind of chewy with the first bite, but as I carved into the middle of the filet, it was much more tender. BTW: The middle only took 3 bites to finish, then it got hard again as I approached the end. The ribeye on the first bite tasted better than the filet, but towards the end of the ribeye it got dry and the juiciness of the meat fadded. Overall, we got our money's worth, but I don't know about paying full price. \nThe service was fantastic; the staff kept checking up on us too frequently I would say.

In my mind, what really sets Ruth Chris apart is the way they cook their steaks. They cook their steaks at 1800 degrees in custom broilers and then drown them in butter. It's so good it makes me wish my own broiler got 3x hotter than it does!  Last time I was there I got a filet Oscar style (topped with crab, asparagus and bearnaise sauce), and it was cooked perfectly to medium rare. I don't think I'll ever order anything else.   The only reason I won't give Ruth Chris 5 stars is because their sides dishes didn't impress me. In my opinion, they overcharge for mediocre fries and over-cooked vegetables.

The noise level was a bit more than I prefer in a place like this, but was mostly due to one raucous guest sitting near us.  We got seated in the middle of the room which also took away from it feeling like an intimate dinner.  Those are my really picky negatives which should be taken with a grain of salt.  The food itself was most all excellent.  The hashbrowns were a bit too greasy and crunchy for my liking, and the cheese that came with them congealed pretty quickly which made them difficult to work with.  Aside from that, both of our salads (Caesar and apple / walnut) were really good.  Perfectly dressed and a great portion.  My fiance said he had never tasted better brussel sprouts in his life.  The peanut butter chocolate dessert was crazy delicious (if you like peanut butter).  My fiance found the peanut butter to be a bit much.  The real star, as you would expect, were the steaks we had.  We both thought they were the best steaks we had ever had in our lives (which is saying something since we're both from Nebraska), but I imagine it's hard to go wrong when the meat is drenched in butter.  Tasted delicious, but most definitely isn't a health food!  My fiance got the filet and I got the ribeye.  His was easily the superior of the two steaks, but mine was still sooooo good.

It's a solid as it gets for steak. There are lots of steak houses to choose from these days, but I have been to a few and keep coming back here. The decor is great, what a steak house should look like. Dark, wood, clubby feel. The waitstaff has never disappointed with a helpful but nice slow pace. My only real criticism is with the wine list. I would have liked to see more choices from Chile and Argentina. They make wonderful wines that are a great value. Sonoma and Napa wines are just so overpriced in places like this. Next time I may bring my own bottle and just deal with the corkage fee.", "author": "D D."}

Finally decided to give it a try.\nWow - never again. I don't care where it is, what's the occasion, will not give them my money.\nFirst off, the service was slow. It took us FOREVER to take our order. Then again FOREVER to get our first course, again FOREVER second course and so on. We did not even have a chance to enjoy our drinks much, because they would not stop by to ask us if we needed a refill. I mean, if the kitchen is slow, the wait staff should at least try to get us drinking, but nope, they would not come by to check on us.\nSecond - my husband ordered medium streak and it came back still breathing on his plate. Seriously, it was beyond rare. Unbelievable, a steak house does not make the right temperature of a steak?!\nThird, I ordered lobster.

We had the DAT, ordered three different entrees, we all thought everything was wonderful.  (Except, perhaps for the dessert, one of us had Key Lime pie which could not compare to the more traditional, less gelatin-like, original). \nThe service is impeccable.  I had read somewhere that they charge $8 for water, but they didn't (simply say regular water which the waiter will offer amongst the other pricier choices). \nWe had studied the DAT menus and felt that Ruth Chris and Asia de Cuba were by far the most forthright (they include items that you would choose if they were not DAT prices).  So we went to both and were very pleased, but we all liked Ruth Chris the best which is why I am writing this review. Also, we miraculously found street parking perhaps 50 ft up Van Ness from the restaurant. \nI think Ruth Chis would be a wonderful choice for regular dining if you can afford it, or if not, then for special occasions. The elegance of the rooms is wonderful. The steaks were terrific, the butter was fantastic. I thought the creamed spinach was to die for. We ordered a baked potato (not on the DAT) and it was excellent. (I wish I could buy potatoes like that, I have never found one that had that taste and texture, I wonder what grade they are, A++?)  The non-DAT prices were, I thought, very if not reasonable, then fair. Yes the Kobe steak is $70, but there are many other lower priced menu choices. The entire experience was memorable.

But let me tell you about my first experience at Ruth's Chris.....I was there last night and ordered the rib eye.  The menu read, \"An outstanding example of USDA Prime at its best. Well marbled for peak flavor, deliciously juicy\".  Oh baby, my mouth was watering.  I forgot to read the fine print that said,  \"and sprinkled with the waiter's GIANT PUBE\".  That's right I ate about half my steak when I discovered a 3 inch long PUBE on my rib eye.  Someone needs to get out of the '70s and start trimming their PUBES.  \n\nNeedless to say I didn't enjoy the rest of my dinner.  They gave me a free rib eye to try and make up for it.   Despite this nasty discovery, I really don't understand what all the fuss is about.  Buy yourself a nice cut of meat from your local butcher, cook it and drench it in butter.   Way cheaper than the $40+ they ask for at this place.  Salad and desert tasted like the crap you get at a cheap wedding.  San Francisco is known for it's fine dinning and Ruth's Chris shouldn't be part of that list.  \n\nIf you want a good deal for rib eye go to Maykadeh located in SF's North Beach.  $27 for some of the best steak you'll find in the city.  It's served with fries but I prefer to get it served with their rice.", "author": "J C."}

If I go to a normal restaurant I do not expect high standards and I mark it accordingly. I knew that Ruth Chris was not of lower standards so I was expecting big things. Having been to this establishment across Asia, I was looking forward to the American style. When We arrived, the front of house failed to engage with us and told us to sit down and wait for our table. We were not asked if we would like a drink at the bar nor were our coats taken. We were then escorted 15 minutes later to a table that had not been properly prepared e.g there were still decorations from a birthday party left on the table. Their were three of us and the server removed the setting where my guest was seated and expected him to move over or move the setting to his place. The server was very friendly but it ended there. We got our menus and ordered the wine. As she poured the wine she spilt some on my guests side plate and instead of changing the plate, she wiped it off with a napkin from her pocket. That shocked us all. The wine was exceptional but overpriced. (Da Vinci, Chianti, Tuscany, Italy 2004).  \n\nThe appetizers were good. Two soups and the palm salads. Tasty and not too filling. We were interrupted many times by staff . Three or four times during the course is fine but that amount in the space of thirty minutes is excessive and annoying. We all ordered the prime filet. The food was placed on a tray beside our table and it waited for three servers to place the entrees on our table. It was a confusion on who's role it was to place the food on the table! The atmosphere was fair but for such a place, to see guys in tracksuits and hoodies was very off putting. In fine dining establishments their should be a dress code of at least a shirt and slacks. The steaks were very tender and the 500 degree Celsius plates were over the top. I do not like to burn myself on the plates after I have finished my meal by 10 minutes. (it slips the mind not to handle to plates). My plate was removed while my guests were eating. A big NO NO in my book. \n\nTheir were smaller service mistakes but at this stage of the meal I felt to put them to the side as my expectations had been defeated. So I Went with the flow.  We had one dessert and 2 coffees . My guest recommended the creme brulee. The coffees were placed on the table while myself and guest went for a cigarette. The server told us that she would reheat them when we got back but she should never have served them while we were not at the table. The bill came to $250 and I left feeling unsatisfied.

It started with the service, which I expected to be second-to-none for a steakhouse of this caliber.  I asked Marc to describe the difference between the cowboy rib eye and the standard rib eye.  I got a less than satisfactory \"the cowboy is a little bigger, and more marbled\" response.  Not exactly enough to sell me on paying $3 extra for the \"bone-in\" version, but my manhood dictated that I take the larger slab of meat so I would not lose face in front of S and my friends.  \"Medium-rare\" I state with confidence, knowing that a good steak cooked anymore is just having the flavor cooked out.  A couple of minutes after we submit our order, I hear someone from the next table over ask their waiter the difference between the two rib eyes.  I am dumbfounded as their waiter responds, \"The standard rib eye is a 16 ounce cut, and the cowboy rib eye is 22 oz, but about 4 oz are bone, so you are really only getting two more ounces of meat.\"  I sulk for a little more until our food arrives, and I get a very large cut, with puddles of butter hiding in all of the crevices.  The meat itself was quite tasty until I get to the middle where I'm greeted by meat resembling the color of sashimi ahi.  Too proud to send back the undercooked meat I continue through my rib eye.  Overall a decent but not great steak.  The \"mashed\" side dish is nothing to write home about, and will not be ordered again.  The yam casserole side dish is fantastic and a must have.  Overall 3/5.\n\nS: Best. Steak. Ever. You can cut this rib-eye with a spoon. The sweet potatoes delicious. I have to agree with B on the wait service and mashed potatoes, but overall this was great for me.

I'll impart said worthless trivia, since that's what I do best. Many years ago, some broad named Ruth bought an existing joint called Chris Steak House and promptly changed its name to Ruth's. The people stopped coming. She wisely re-incorporated the brand recognition factor by changing it again -- keeping the vain, possessive 'Ruth's,' since, after all, she spent a lot of dough on it, but tacked on the familiar 'Chris Steak House.' The customers not only came back ... it became even more popular. So there you have it.

This place is bustling, with tourists and locals. First course was a choice of a steak house salad or caesar salad. I had the caesar, and my friend had the steak house. Service is amazingly polished. My friend left for the bathroom when they came by with the ground pepper, so when he returned, they appeared right then with the ground pepper for his salad. My caesar was very good. Main course was a choice of the 12 oz. ribeye, the 8 oz. petite filet, the stuffed chicken breast, or the market fish, which was sea bass. This being a steakhouse, why get anything else?! The regular ribeye on the full menu is 16 oz., and there is a larger filet on the full menu. If you compare prices and do the math to calculate the dollars per ounce, the petite filet is a better deal, as it is a more expensive cut of meat. It's also healthier, as it doesn't have the \"well-marbled\" tasty fat of the ribeye. I had the petite filet, which was oh so good. They marinate in salt and pepper and serve the steaks on 500 degree plates. You are offered a choice of no butter, regular amount of butter, or extra butter. I had no butter on mine. And you get a choice of sides: potato au gratin, or julienne fries, or baked potato. I had the baked potato, and you can have it topped with sour cream with chives, bacon, or butter. I asked and received a little container of just chives. For dessert there were 2 choices: key lime pie or bread pudding. The key lime pie was nice, but sweet, and too sweet for my friend, so if you don't like your desserts too sweet, the bread pudding would be a better choice.

Well we were an hour late for our reservation but they were very nice about it and got us a table after a 30 minute wait. I've read several reviews about this place already so all I was thinking about was STEAK STEAK STEAK!!! Both me and my date was anxious for the main course because we are carnivores. When we were seated, Scott, came to serve us. Scott had to be one of the TOP DAWG servers there because he was very very helpful. He asked if it was out first time and did the whole explaining. Food came out really fast after we ordered. She had the special, which included salad, 11 oz filet, a side (mushrooms), and desert. I ordered the ahi-tuna (which was incredible) and the recommended Cowboy Ribeye... when it came out... it was like heaven! I'm not going to make this too long so if you want steak! this is the place... wine, champagne, and a warm apple crush tart... PERFECT! good service and good food, just what I expected from a 5* restaurant.", "author": "Stanley W."}

Of course, I'm not an exception to that. So glad I opted for the 12 oz. instead of the petite filet because I was starrrrrrving! And the mashed potatoes? Oh my goodness, they literally melted in my mouth. The dessert is the only part that kept me from giving this a 5 star review. It said online that it was chocolate sin cake, but the actual menu at the restaurant had two different items. Turns out it was only offered at the beginning of DAT, and they didn't know there was going to be an extension. I was really looking forward to having my chocolate fix after dinner. But the key lime pie was pretty good, not too tart like others I've tried in the past. The wine I had prior to being seated was excellent, but I must get the mojito next time. You can't even tell there's alcohol in it, even though my friend and I watched the bartender make it. Yes, it's THAT good.", "author": "Rhia R."}

In one sitting.  Unless I'm eating popcorn.   I went with a large party.  Made the rezzies two weeks in advance for a dozen people.  Didn't change it so they knew how many people we would be.  But still, we were placed in the middle of the room in the middle of the way constantly getting bummed into.  The waitress must have been a spurn, forgotten lover of one of the people at the table; no other way to explain the instant distain she showered us with.  She stood at one end of the table and ran over the specials in a voice loud enough to carry two people in, at the speed of a well rehearsed  auctioneer.  When we asked if she could repeat it for the other side of the table we were showered with yet more distain and given a quicker version.  The steak was HUGE and a good cut.  It had obviously been double  dipped in a vat of butter.  The sides were expensive, huge and boring.  At some point a younger, hotter, more friendly waitress started helping Hateful Helga, and the cocktails kicked in, so we all relaxed and had a good, if not bumped into meal. It still had a bit of a \"Get In, Get It In, Get Out\" feel though.  When we ordered after dinner cocktails they were practically thrown at us as they made it clear that our hours rent on their little piece of paradise was up and we should take our doggie bags of butter and go home. I've been several times, this was just the most recent, and obviously the last.  The food is always good and huge, but you can get better steaks ESPECIALLY at this price at several places in San Francisco without feeling like you're a walking wallet.", "author": "Cosmolicious L."}

I went to the one in New York ages ago, and I remember the food to be delicious and the service- classy and professional.  The San Francisco location is not the same.  Although we had reservations for 8pm on a Tuesday, we weren't seated until about 8:30pm.  The hostess would repeatedly ask people \"D'you wanna wait over there?\" Instead of something like \"Would you like to have a drink in our bar while you wait?\"  I guess I'm being a little too picky, but for over $100 per person for a meal, I'd like to be treated as I would at an upscale restaurant, not a taco stand.  Our server was ok and the food was good, but not great.  The pasta w/cheese was too salty to eat.  And the most annoying thing was that I called to confirm that I was coming to celebrate a birthday (after already checking the \"Birthday Celebration\" box on the online reservation form), and they kindly confirmed on the phone.  I have no idea why they even ask because they didn't bring us a birthday dessert, or even offer to put a candle on the dessert we ordered.  I would've asked, but at that point, I just wanted to doggy-bag-it outta there.  Not worth the $200 for 2 people.", "author": "Jules P."}

I had large filet (cooked medium) and what I was served  was a over-charred petit file.  It was the worst filet I have ever had in my life, that thing should have never made it out of the kitchen.  I could have used it for a hockey puck.  The side of asparagus was also over-steamed and limp and the hollandaise sauce had the consistency of syrup.  Just  an absolute waste of time and $100.00.  I will never go here again.  This place shouldn't be allowed to be called a steakhouse.  I have had a better filet at Outback - go there and save $60.00 on your dinner.

I had the tomato & crap soup as appetizer and it was just delicious and tasty.   PP had the salad and it was like any salad.  For Entr\u00e9e, I had the 6-ounce medallion filet topped with jumbo shrimp.  My filet was tender and cooked just right.   The shrimp, however, was not all that.  PP had the 12 oz. Ribeye with au poivre sauce & the bleu cheese crust on the side.   He thought it was fantastic.   The ribeye itself was already yummy, but with the au poivre sauce, it was much better.   We didn't care too much for the bleu cheese crust with the steak though.  It was actually good pairing with the red wine though.  \nThe food was superior and our waitress was lovely.

The service was memorable in a bad way. I arrive at 7:00 and the hostess informed me that my group will be seated once everyone arrives. Totally understandable since my reservation was at 7:30. By 7:30 my group was ready to be seated, the hostess informed us that in a moment we would be seated. At 8:00 we still were not seated. We asked again and they finally seated us at 8:15, in the middle of the dining room, when we specifically requested in our reservation for  a booth seat. We noticed a booth next to us which was empty and requested to be seated in that booth. The hostess said sure just give us a second to clean up and you can have that booth, we waited out at the front only to discover that they gave the booth to another group and we didn't get seated until 8:30. The minute our waiter saw we were ordering from the Dine About Town Menu became distant and gave us the bare minimum service.

I finished the whole thing and I wasn't even that hungry to begin with. The sides were just ok in my opinion. The mashed potatoes were better than the creamed spinach. The creamed spinach was just lacking in flavor and I probably won't order that next time. We both ordered the bread pudding for dessert. It was REALLY good... the whiskey sauce went so well with the bread. Oh and we didn't even have to share the dessert. I saw in some earlier reviews about how two people had to share a dessert.

I came here with my bf for Dine About Town during this past February. It was a good deal, about $32 per person for a 3 course prixe fix menu (appetizer,  main course, and dessert). We made reservations through the Dine About Town web site and waited about 10 minutes before we got seated. Despite the crowd that was already there, everyone was brought to their tables relatively quickly. We both had the house salad for the appetizer, nothing special here. We both chose filets with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach for our main course. The portions of filet seemed pretty small, maybe b/c it was for dine about town (half the price, half the portion?). The meat was really tender and delicious, but I wished I had some A1 sauce (which I dared not to ask unless i wanted to be laughed at for this superb piece steak that is originally $60) I'm a saucey kinda girl, surprisingly this steak did not need any extra flavor. I loved the creamed spinach and the mash b/c they were very flavorful. The key lime pie and bread pudding were good as well, but I felt too full to finish everything.

In a place this big, with a nationwide presence and very high reputation, when you order a ribeye, you should get a ribeye--not a NY Strip.  That's what happened to me in December when I took the BF there for his birthday.  I love the quality of the steaks but their overall attention to our visit was pretty low. I told them ahead of time it was a birthday and we had show tickets, so seating and serving had to be prompt--but they stuck with their normal stately pace, and they screwed up in the most basic way--brought me the wrong menu item.  We didn't have time to wait for a new steak, so I had to eat my least favorite cut of steak at a premium price. To me a NY Strip is like a big loaf of dense brown bread. I didn't feel like putting a cloud over the birthday celebration by going all Krakatoa on them, so it was kind of a bummer.

Right when we walked in, I was engulfed with the smell of butter.  It immediately made me wonder how much butter they use on all their dishes.  I ordered the fish special which was pretty good, but was drenched in butter (surprise!).  My bf had the rib eye, which he was very happy with.  The service was mediocre.

Hands down, a top-notched steak provider. Wonderful sides and service. Does this justify a price tag of about $75 per person? This is the ONLY reason that Ruth Chris' (and other top restaurants) receive less than 5 stars.", "author": "Michael S."}

My hubby loves this steakhouse so for his birthday we made the reservations 3 weeks prior.  I would have given 4 stars but the rude host was a sure disappointment. He told everyone with reservations that it would be 15 minutes but in reality it was really 45 minutes to an hour wait. Why lie to the customers? Then on top of it, why be rude to the customers? At one point, someone asked him to provide a more realistic number, he said rudely and loudly, \"Would 30 minutes be better for you, lady?\" Another party mentioned that they had already waited for 45 minutes, so obviously 30 minutes was still a lie. Regardless of the shady host, the service and the food were excellent. But that didn't stop my hubby from saying, \"We'll go to Harris next time.\" Apparently Harris is just as good and down the street from Ruth's Chris. Note for R.C.: Reservations did our party no good. It will be a wait. Hopefully Harris treats their customers better.", "author": "Seymour S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-07-20", "description": "Made the mistake of taking my carnivore hubby to this place for his b-day a few months ago as it was okay years ago (last visit was probably over 10 years ago).   Ordered the calamari as a starter.  It was okay.  Lightly battered on the outside, but a bit slimy on the inside.  My petite filet was undercooked slightly as I wanted it well done since I was still nursing our baby, and it was more like medium so I ended up only eating the outside of it.  My husband's steak was extremely  undercooked inside and burnt all over the outside.  He ordered medium and he got rare.  You would think that a steak house would be able to cook a steak perfectly, made to order after serving mainly nothing but steaks, but I guess not this place.   The sides were also nothing to rave about.  We had scalloped potatoes which were a bit too cheesy and soggy and the wedges which were huge greasy suckers.  Nothing looked elegant in terms of the food or presentation.  The food was very poor in my opinion as I've eaten at way better steak houses over the years.  This one is at the very bottom sitting side by side with Outback Steakhouse (crap).  Top prices for poor meat and cooking techniques.  My husband actually threw up after we left the restaurant since all he could taste was a burnt flavor in his mouth.  The dinner cost slightly over $200 for the two of us which included probably five beers.  The waiter was friendly and attentive so no complaints there, but the food is really not up to par at all.  The only reason my husband didn't send his steak back is due to his fear that they mite pull a road trip (chef throws the french toast down his pants and re-serves to customer).  Go elsewhere if u really like steak.  Harris down the street is way better then this if you're going to spend the money.  I can't believe they're still in business serving food this way.  The one star is for the service.  Never going back....ever!", "author": "Kiki W."}

We made reservations for 7:15 three months ago, but unfortunately it was SOOO packed that we had to wait about an hour even with our reservations. I'm guessing its because it was Valentine's Day that they were so busy. When we were finally seated, I ordered a filet mignon and Jan ordered a t-bone steak and for our sides we ordered creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin. They serve their steaks sizzling ass hot and when we took our first bite, it literally melted in our mouths. Our steaks were super juicy and tender while our sides were very tasty. Mm... everything was SOOO good. The service here is good because our waiter kept checking up on us and our waters would always be refilled when it went half full just as it should. This place would've been given 5 stars if it weren't for the wait. We'll definitely be coming back again for dinner.", "author": "Jan And Daph S."}

It was so yummy!! i ate everything on my plate. i also ordered the potatoes au gratin. couldn't have done without it though since i had so much food on my plate already and also trying everyone else's steak. The steak was nice and tender and with just enough flavor. The shrimp was cooked cajun style. it had a little bit of spice which was perfect. the crab cake was sooo good. i took a bite of the rib eye , t- bone, and cowboy steak. they were all so good. nice time i come here, i wanna have the rib-eye. great place for tasty steak. OMG, almost forgot to mention dessert. even though we were all so full, we had to try the dessert and it was so worth it. we had the creme brulee and banana creme pie. the banana creme pie was so good. i tried the creme brulee and it was pretty good and i don't even like creme brulee. It didn't taste too eggy. we also had the cheese cake and it was nice of them to give it compimentary for my birthday.  in the beginning i though it was kinda weird because it was sour but once you get to the inside it is very good.", "author": "Connie C."}

I even took my team here and spent thousands of dollars for a celebration party.  So what happened recently really pissed me off that I have to leave them a bad review.  During recent months the seating of people who made reservations has been terrible.  The wait is at least 30 minutes if you have a reservation.  The worse part was during my last visit, I was told it would be \"just a minute\" when I first got there.  I asked the host how long exactly would that be, he said it was more like 10 minutes.  We ended waiting for 50 minutes.  WTF?  Alright, to be fair, the food was good even when my lobster wasn't cooked all the way through, I like sashimi so that didn't bother me.  This is the part that pushed me off the edge.. i got home, saw that I was charged for an additional bottle of San Pellegrino, the dollar was minor but since I don't get free bottle of Pelligrino from Ruth's Chris, why should I pay for what I didn't get, right?  Wrote them and email explaining the mistake they made on my check, two weeks later, still no response!  WTF?!  Additional charge on my check was a mistake; ignoring the mistake is plain criminal, stealing from a customer!  Shame on you.  This is how a corporation starts failing by ignoring their customers and stealing from their customers.  I hope we all as consumers or investors are smarter to not engage business with a corporation who commits crime.", "author": "Hawk E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-01-25", "description": "This was my 2nd trip to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and my first on Dine About Town.  The first experience was better because we were gifted with a $50 card thanks to a friend; it was nice because it cushioned the blow, but I still didn't like the overpriced drinks and having to pay extra for every little thing.  We spent quite a bit and didn't even have any appetizers nor dessert/coffee.    But the steaks were good as I recall and I even left with some goodies and bones from the cowboy ribeye.  But, this most recent visit, I didn't come away feeling like I had a great meal, even for the price.  Even though the DAT was $32/pp, for that money you'd expect a pretty good meal and experience considering this is a \"high end\" and special occasion restaurant.   We arrived early at 5:30 in advance of our reservations; bar was nearly full so we opted to go ahead and eat earlier.  We were escorted to a table which was in the middle of a seating of 4-5 tables-for-2 very close to one another.   I wasn't happy with this so I asked if we could be moved to an available booth which was accommodated (once I asked).  I didn't get a good vibe from our server (lady) shortly thereafter and esp. after I had to ask for the DAT menu.  I also requested that the wine list for examination.  Their wine list is extremely overpriced!  A glass costs at least 4x the cost of a retail bottle of the wine.   The cabernet sauvignon by the glass I ordered I later found out is about $10/bottle and that's retail.  Outrageous markup!  I ordered a petite filet, side of spinach and the dessert, which was bread pudding.  My hubby ordered the same, but with key lime pie for dessert.  The starter was an unimpressive mixed green salad with balsamic vineagrette.  I can do this at home for like less than a dollar.  I liked the warm bread and butter, though.   The filet mignons, at 6 ozs., were decent.  We both ordered ours medium rare and seems like mine was more medium in parts.  I like butter alot but I agree they over-saturate theirs to the point that it's maybe too much. Hubby liked it though so I gave  him with the remainder of mine which was probably 1/3 which I didn't want to eat anymore of.  It was OK but definitely not as juicy and tender as I expected.  Sides were decent (spinach),  but I have to say I make a better creamed spinach using my own recipe and they give you less in terms of quantity on this special DAT menu.   For the money, I could probably replicate the meal for far less $$$ at home.  For dessert, the waitress then accidentally spilled the contents of my water glass on my dessert and all over the table and into my lap.  Not a huge problem since it's just water, but it was a blight on my experience and while she apologized a few times and replaced the dessert, she could've done more and shown better professionalism.  I didn't think she exuded genuine friendliness...more like perfunctory service, although the busboys/other service staff were good.  It got almost too intrusive at times with servers interrupting your dinner conversation by removing plates and clearing the table.  I guess your experience has much to do with the service you receive.  A manager came around towards the end asking if we were all happy but it seemed somewhat impersonal and we were too polite to say otherwise .  For my money, I'd much rather go to the House of Prime RIb for a special occasion.  Have never been disappointed there and at least I feel I get my money's worth considering their dinners include a huge (great) salad and all the sides, with an extra helping if you're up to it.  And the overall atmosphere just seems more casual and friendly.  At Ruth's Chris, it seems to be all about the $$$.", "author": "Mimi L."}
