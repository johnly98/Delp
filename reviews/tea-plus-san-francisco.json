A few more minutes went by, and the couple got their drink, then your staff tells me that you don't gave the crystal yogurt available.

I saw a drink on the poster on their wall and it looked really good so I decided to order that. No one was at the cash register so I tried to look through the curtains to see if there were anyone inside to help me. A guy came out (possibly the owner) to take my drink order. I told him I want that drink on the poster and he said ok. Then he asked me what toppings I would like. The poster said it came with aloe vera. Confused, I asked him if it already came with aloe vera and he said no. I said to him that it says with aloe vera... He told me that it's just a poster and then said to me that if you go buy a car at the dealership based on seeing a catalog, you would still have to add this and that... I thought to myself, am I here for a drink or a lecture? He kept going on and on and then asked me if I still want the aloe vera. He says its extra charge. I said yes... Although their poster is false advertisement, it wasn't a big deal to me. I didn't mind paying extra for aloe vera, I was just a little surprised that it didn't come with aloe vera when it says with aloe vera. I wasn't trying to cause a scene or anything. He asked me how sweet and I said 50% then he went to the back to make my drink. He brought out a little sample to see if I liked the taste or the sweetness and I said to him that it's a little too sweet for me. He seemed annoyed and said to me that if I come back and order from another cashier, I should ask for no sweet first and then add the syrup afterwards. He went inside to revise the drink a little and came back out with another sample. At that moment, I just wanted to get out of there. I said to him that it's better and I'll just take it. I paid for the drink and then he asked me if I wanted a stamp card. I said to him, \"No, thanks!\" I was not planning on coming back.", "author": "B L."}

The food is even more garbage! And I f you want to try and mask the garbage taste, you can't because they don't even have any sauces to accompany their fried, greasy garbage! The customer service is garbage! I was craving boba so I ordered from here a couple weeks ago using Uber eats and when I received it, it triggered an angry response. I wasted money and time and then had to re-order and wait longer or food that was actually edible. The fact that this place would serve food in the way they do is just a disgrace! \n\nI ordered a honeydew boba tea. I received something that tasted somewhat like coffee with some melon flavor in it. It was so awful and instantly dumped down the drain!\n\nI ordered some super app combo. It was supposed to come with chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, curly fries, regular fries, spring rolls and jalape\u00f1o poppers. It was served in a 6 inch box in which half the items were lost in a greasy deep fried mess! It's as if they threw all of these items into one fryer together and then tossed it straight into a 6 inch box that it didn't fit in. I opened it and attempted to pick up a curly fry and the rest of the fried greasy crap came with it. It was so disgusting! Half of the items didn't even seem to be in there but to be honest I wouldn't know if they were because I'de never get that far. It was inedible and this place should be ashamed of itself!

This is the only Boba spot still open within mine & the boyfriend's vicinity. \n\n1 worker, all tables full but no one has any drinks. Is this a sign? Everyone is on their phone yet here I am waiting 28 minutes to order. A few more minutes, he says. The worker goes back and forth from the back to the front making no drinks or eye contact with anyone. He comes back again, apologizes for the wait and says, \"few more minutes.\"\n\nI'm waiting. Pretty sure this is the place for everyone to just walk in, take a seat, use the free wifi and sit for hours doing nothing but play games or be on their phones. On the bright side, they have the Costco version of Jenga and some games for little kids. They also play music on a TV screen. But still, it's pretty cramped in here. \n\n10:31. Finally put my order in. Green apple green tea with boba light ice, 50% sweet. Thai milk tea, light ice with boba. Lychee slush with boba.\n\nWhile waiting, I decided to look around.. in the spot I'm standing in -since the establishment is pretty small and all seats were taken by boys on their phones. The egg puff machine was dripping with old batter, on the sides and the table. You can see in the back where they keep everything, in plain sight, that all of their boxes are stacked from the floor to the ceiling. \n\nI feel bad for this worker. Why is there only one person working? 2/5 because he made the effort to make the drinks diligently and as quickly as possible. The green apple drink tasted disgusting. Couldn't taste the apple at all. To check I asked my boyfriend and one other person to try it without telling them the flavor. They couldn't figure it out. Their guesses were not even close to apple. The lychee slush was tasty, you could definitely taste the lychee but 3 quick sips and I hit ice. It was practically ice with lychee syrup... so disappointing. Wasn't to thrilled to try the Thai milk tea, but honestly, how could anyone mess that up?\n\nI also saw the worker grab the lid for the blender straight out of the sink without washing it. Suffice to say, I hope the couple who came after me just threw out that drink without trying it. Wasn't sure how to tell them as I wasn't sure if they'd understand me... they were speaking a dialect I'd never heard before.\n\nFirst & last try. Will probably wait for the next day if I get another Boba craving. Avoiding this place at all costs.", "author": "Shilo B."}

The service has been reliable, they have a variety of snacks, and everything is reasonably priced. They even have a small seating area that usually has some room open.\n\nThe food and tea is okay. In my experience the egg puffs are made fine but they're not outstanding, and the milk tea is indeed a little weak in the tea area - on the upside, they're particular here about how much ice and sweetness you want, and I always ask them to keep it down to 25% sweet. That's fairly sweet so I'd hate to know how the 100% comes out.\n\nLike most shops around here, they're cash only and only open until eight. They also get overwhelmed easily so you might not want to head here right after the schools let out. If you're in the area often, also check out 5 tea house which is only a couple of doors over and very similar - better or worse depending on who you ask.", "author": "Jesse C."}

I've tried the few other places around the area and you will definitely notice the difference in the tea. Can't beat the taste of fresh brewed tea. Give it a shot and see the difference for yourself.", "author": "W L."}

I asked them if I could sample the almond milk tea since I didn't know if the almond was too strong for my liking and they said with attitude towards their coworkers \"we don't do samples, why won't she just buy the whole drink... How the heck are we supposed to make a sample?\" They spoke in Chinese thinking I couldn't understand. Never coming back here again. Would not recommend.", "author": "Melanie N."}

But there were no grass jelly in our drinks and the egg puff looks like plastic. All we can taste from the drinks is syrup. Never again will I order from this place.", "author": "Tiffany Q."}

Then waited at least another three minutes to get my drink with no toppings and no refund on not getting my toppings. Very disappointed overall.", "author": "Shu Z."}

I think the young girl cashier is trying to teach a new guy near the boba machine next to the register. Maybe they were just focus didn't notice me? So, I tried to grab their attention. Eye contact, hand waving, waving in front of the boba machine, saying hello... I can tell they are busy, but please just give me a nod, a \"we will be with you soon\" - something! But no, they never once even look up!\n\nThankful, an adult came out from the back. He immediately came over and took my order. He was very polite. Sadly, he passed the transaction to the new guy - I was pretty sure he was new by then, seeing the intensely focused face and slow finger movement as he navigate the iPad register. After purchase, I realized he charged me wrong. I ordered a rose milk with mango popping boba. He charged me for rose milk tea, popping boba, and boba. *Sigh* By that point, I was tired. I was not going to make a scene against a newbie cashier for $0.50.\n\nBefore I left, the older guy apologize again for the wait and even help me get my straw. I was hoping that my experience ends there, with the polite old guy and two young cashiers new to customer service, but no.\n\nIt was the first time in my life that a milk tea taste sour. No kidding! The rose is so barely there that, the moment I got home, I asked my sister if she can taste it. Being a much more frequent boba drinker than I am, she told me it's just very light. Then, she frowned, and she commented that it taste very strange. Finally, she asked me if I can be sure it hasn't gone bad.\n\nI was so surprise by the taste that I didn't even consider that. But I was so thirsty that I already drink half of it (yes, I was that thirsty), and I wasn't sick. She finally proposed that maybe the syrup that the boba soak in didn't got drain out properly. After some thought, I wondered if some mango popping boba was popped while the drink was made, though the mango wasn't strong and shouldn't taste sour... Who knows what happened? But geeze... this is one strange, strange experience. \n\nThe drink by itself should have got this down to 2 star. The lack of attention from cashiers would downgrade it to 1. The only reason it is 2 is because the polite and pleasant behavior from the older guy and the fact that the store and its cashiers are obviously still new.", "author": "Amy C."}

Only because I was the only customer and I ordered 2 drinks. Honey lemon tea, how hard is it to make that? I waited almost 15 mins before she gave me my drinks. Just because you're not busy doesn't mean take all the time in the world to make a drink that ended up tasting really bad! Panda boba, is always busy but yet I never have to wait that long for what I want.", "author": "Denise N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-24", "description": "I purchased a regular lychee green tea with lychee coconut jelly and a large popcorn chicken, $8.18 for both. The level of sweetness is just right. Wish they would have given more jelly, but I won't complain. Nothing special about the drink. I was originally going to go to 5 degree next door, but they didn't have popcorn chicken. I would suggest people not get popcorn chicken though. It's not that flavorful. Kind of reminds me of chicken strips or whatever from McDonald's. I added a lot of chili pepper, but it wasn't spicy at all either. I can't handle spicy too well, but it isn't spicy at all. I ate the egg puffs before, but it was really doughy (totally not what \u9e21\u86cb\u5b50 is supposed to taste like). But I guess there are some people who like this doughy texture? Next time, I'll purchase drinks here (price is good), but I'll purchase the snacks elsewhere. Unless I hear that they've improved on their egg puff making skills! And hopefully some better chili pepper!", "author": "Rose G."}
