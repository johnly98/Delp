They had just the basics inside. Just a few taken chairs, a counter manned by two women and the letter board menu. The focaccia options were listed in price ascending order. I went with a pesto cheese for $6.50 and cut up to snack on while wandering in North Beach.\n\nSneaking a peek into the back, you can see the brick oven, storing racks and a table to slice and wrap slabs of focaccia up. You place your order, pay cash only, they disappear into the back, and come back with your food.\n\nIt's so soft, moist and fluffy! The pesto cheese seemed to be a special and it was light yet indulgent. Really delicious bread.", "author": "Samantha L."}

My friend had recommended it to me as a MUST for something really tasty. My friend and I woke up on our first day and made our way there around the time it opened at 8 AM.\n\nWhen we arrived there was already a line of about 6 people there 5 minutes after the store had opened. After ordering and trying their namesake focaccia for myself I understand why! Focaccia is a baked flat bread which originated from Italy. The family that is behind this store has been operating it for over a hundred years in the San Francisco area! When it came time to order I went with the Rosemary Garlic ($5.50). Fair warning, this is a CASH ONLY establishment. Make sure to come with a few bucks and you'll be set.\n\nThe rosemary garlic was out of this world. It literally was a HUGE piece of flatbread that was extremely tasty. My friend and I actually got our focaccia to go and walked to nearby Washington Square Park and sat on a bench to watch the people walking around while enjoying our flatbreads. I'd definitely recommend it if you've got some time to spare.\n\nOverall a great place to get an authentic Italian flatbread with a variety of different flavors to choose from!", "author": "Nicholas C."}

I hadn't read reviews but I've heard from a few friends that the bread here was amazing, so I thought I MUST give it a try. Upon walking in and waiting in line, I already noticed that these two women working (owners?) looked as if they were NOT happy to be there. SUPER grumpy, impatient and flat out unhelpful. Being my first time there, I didn't feel welcomed or simply comfortable enough to even ask any questions. So I just looked at the board and asked for two flavors. \n\nVERY QUESTIONABLE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WASH THEIR HANDS BEFORE HANDLING FOOD. \n\nI see that they use their BARE hands to hold my bread... and bare hands to receive CASH. Honestly, I don't care how clean your hands are, they're still your HANDS. You perspire. You can have sh*t stuck in your nails. Cross contamination!!! What if someone is allergic to garlic or onion or one of your other flavors? I'm sorry but food safety is one thing I can't turn a blind eye to.\n\nHaving said all that, I did eat/try the bread anyway, and it was good, no doubt. But not amazing, other worldly good.

On a Saturday at 11 am there were a bunch of people outside grumbling that they were completely sold out. This perked my interest and a couple of days ago when I happened to be in the area earlier in the day, I saw that there was no line so decided to give it a try. There was an old lady behind the counter and another younger one who was doing something inside.\n\nThe older lady was getting irritated with a young woman who was asking questions that any first timer would want to know. After two answers she ignored any further questions and just pointed to the barebones ordering board which had Focaccia written on top, followed by what I assumed were toppings. The young woman just stood there completely confused not knowing what to do next.\n\nAnyway while this drama was playing out the younger lady came out and decided to deal with the next person in line which was me. After seeing the fate of the other customer I decided not to ask any questions and simply asked for the pizza focaccia ($5.50) as I had never seen or even hear of this topping, and replied yes for it to be cut. The young lady disappeared inside and returned with a package containing the pizza focaccia bread. No cards were accepted so I paid with cash and got out without being insulted.\n\nThe focaccia bread was pretty good. It was nice and fluffy without being doughy. The pizza toppings were basically tomato sauce and scallions. Overall it was pretty good. Price was also pretty cheap for the area. \n\nI think this place is comparable to Golden Gate Bakery (which sells egg tarts). Its popularity is attributed to the scarcity value of the product rather than on the merit of the product. However good the product is, there is no reason for poor service. I'll leave this one for tourists, and only if I happen to be in the area early in the morning, will I return and try some more toppings from their menu.", "author": "Ahmad J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-19", "description": "I love Liguria Bakery! I've been eating this focaccia for my entire life and it's amazing. It is the best focaccia I've ever had. \n\nI used to buy Liguria's focaccia from Genova Delicatessen in Oakland before it closed. I believe the focaccia used to get delivered there once a week. Unfortunately, Genova in Oakland closed and so I haven't had my fix of Liguria focaccia for a while. \n\nI have also gone to Liguria's Bakery in San Francisco a handful of times. However, it has been years since I've gone out to SF to get the focaccia because you have to go early and there's usually traffic in the morning. If you don't go in the morning there will be a chance that the focaccia will sell out. \n\nI went to Liguria Bakery last Saturday. I went around 8:30/9am to make sure I got all the different kinds of focaccia that I wanted. I believe Liguria's hours say that they are open until 2pm however they close when they sell out. Liguria usually sells out. From reading other reviews I believe they tend to sell out around 11:30am. \n\n\nLiguria Bakery is very small inside. There are a couple cashiers and standing room for about 5-10 people. You can see the focaccia in the back cooling and waiting to be cut and packaged. It is pretty cool to see because there are a lot of sheets of focaccia. \n\nI recommend being ready with what you want when you order. The people working at Liguria weren't extremely friendly but they weren't rude to me either. They basically ask you what you want and package the focaccia for you nothing more. \n\nThere are many kinds of focaccia to choose from. I've tried the raisin, pizza, plain, pesto, and onion. My favorites are the pizza, pesto, and raisin. The raisin focaccia is sweet so it is a little different than the others. The pizza focaccia has sauce and onions on it. The pesto is pesto and cheese. This time I got the pizza and pesto focaccia. The focaccia is sold in sheets. (see pictures for the size) I think the sheets are a good size and they are about $5 each some are a little more depending on the toppings. You can also get the sheet cut into smaller pieces so you can eat them on the go or just get them wrapped in paper and tied. \n\nI am giving Liguria 5 stars because of the amazing and fresh focaccia. The price and the size of the sheets are great as well. The customer service may not be amazing but that's okay because I go to Liguria Bakery for the focaccia and not the service. I definitely recommend this place if you would like to try fresh and delicious focaccia!\n\nTIP: The longer you wait to eat the focaccia the less fresh it is; the focaccia will get harder so it is best to eat it within the first day or so of buying it. (That way it's nice and soft!) However, that won't be hard to do because it's so delicious! \n\nEnjoy!\nSimona", "author": "Simona N."}

Damn!\n\nThe bread is so soft and the flavors are so delicious. We got 2 pesto cheese and 2 mushroom. We had 1 of each sliced up and the other 2 left whole and wrapped in paper and string as a gift to our friends that we were meeting for lunch at the Ferry Building. I love that they do that. It's classic being that it's all wrapped up in old school paper & string. I love long standing places like Liguria Bakery and the history they bring. I grew up in San Francisco and Liguria is certainly a city institution. It should be revered and always supported.\n\nThe mushroom focaccia was very tasty. The bread was soft and the mushroom topping added a great flavor to it. Just so good. So much flavor... The pesto cheese was also very good. It was a little on the salty side due to the cheese but I didnt mind it at all. I am not the biggest pesto fan but this was very good. I would get it again for sure. The mushroom as well.\n\nThe mushroom was $5.50 each and the pesto cheese was $6.50 each. Well worth it... Cash only. Street parking only. I will be back on my next trip home for sure.

Our eyes widen as we stare at each other and check if we had enough cash. We managed to have enough cash for 2 slices. Good thing there slices were big and a steal. If we had brought more cash we would have probably bought one of each flavor.\n\nAbout the flavors, I know nothing about authenticity when it comes to focaccia but I can tell you this, it is soft, pillowy, and has the perfect amount of bounce in each bite and a bit of crunch. Note that you would not have this same sensation eating on the spot so you are going to have to take it home and pop it in the toaster oven. If you are okay with eating it cold, its just as good.

Also lacking is cleanliness as I saw the bread being handled along with the register and money, but I felt much better eating it after I had toasted it at home.", "author": "Jan P."}

No other focaccia can ever steal my heart.  \n\nThey have been around years before my time... Before Microsoft Windows, before Napster, before MySpace, before Facebook, before YouTube, before yelp, before IG, before SnapChat, before any social media even existed, affording \"foodies\" to hype up a raw baby carrot and a single split pea on a luxurious plate made of white gold eaten with a silver knife and fork at a pretentious restaurant to be the OMG best foodgasm ever for an inflated amount of \"likes\" and bragging rights on how deep they were able to dig into their pockets for such euphoric dining pleasures (some tag their sponsors).  \n\nYes.

The utterly familiar sound of the large roll or white wax paper cut n slid onto that counter top... The gentle crumple as she wraps my bread snugly like a bundle of joy right before she slips it into that little brown paper bag... Always brings out the excited little kid in me without fail.  For that, my heart belongs to Liguria... Always.  \n\nGo get it before they decide to close up shop for good. \n\n As we pray for Amatrice, Italy, it triggered my memories of my very first experiences of Italian culture as a first generation Chinese kid growing up in San Francisco's own Italy, the North Beach.", "author": "Colin M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-10", "description": "As a native San Franciscan, Liguria focaccia has always been a part of me. I am finally writing about them but mot to make them more popular, but because it is one of those rare places that needs to be discovered through a local contact, not online reviews, not even Yelp.  If you want that, go stand in line across the street at the tourist trap, Mama's.\n\nMy grandfather, a Chinese butcher, used to barter with Ambrosio.  Years later my grandfather introduced me to the pleasures of Liguria and I got a tour of their business and learned to appreciate the similarities of Italian and Chinese cultures.  As an Americanized kid, I would sneak down the hill from Chinatown to Liguria when I couldn't fathom eating my grandmother's authentic Chinese cooking of salty fish or thousand year old egg.\n\nTheir focaccia has gotten me through cross country road trips, camping trips, pot luck dinners, romantic picnics in Napa, and now most often these days those long cross country flights with overpriced box meals.\n\nMy gal recently suggested that we get some for our cross country flight and we grabbed a couple pizza and a couple jalapeno cheese cut up and bagged.  $5 each and so good.  Everyone on the flight was so jealous.   My son was going to sell a slice for a $1!  Nobody likes a five hour flight to visit their in-laws, but the focaccia made it tolerable.  haha.\n\nThe place usually closes down for the month of August for family trips to Europe or a Giants road trip so it is nice to stock up.  It is made to sit well in the freezer.  Just thaw it out gently when ready.  I like it fresh from the bakery but it also works well slightly toasted.\n\nFor those who complain about the service or lack of friendliness, remember that this is a neighborhood family business that was built on serving the local community.  This community has supported them over the years.  They never intended to become famous.  They supply a basic product to those Italian families and SF restaurants.\n\nThe line never gets long because they do one thing and one thing only very well. They don't have idle chit chat and give time or directions.  They have to move the line.  Even after all these years I speak to Mary quickly about the Giants and move on. \n\nSo like many great old traditions in SF, just keep it on the down low. So many things in San Francisco have been ruined by changes in society.  North Beach is full of young techies hanging out and drinking, but Liguria remains one of the old icons of North Beach that has transcended time.  Embrace it.  Savor  it.

Unfortunately we showed up around 12:30 or so, about 30 minutes prior to them closing. My mom was happy to purchase some frozen focaccia from their freezer. The moment that she opened the freezer to grab it, an unpleasant, abrupt woman basically shouted at her asking why she was grabbing it when she had no idea what she had in her hands. My mom was a bit taken aback, noting that she was happy with any of the focaccia they sell. This woman again abruptly and rudely let us know that they were sold out of everything but one type. My mom said she didn't mind, she was happy to purchase whatever they had. \n\nI was frustrated with how this woman spoke to my mother, a customer, first of all, but it was her birthday! I mentioned to the woman that she must really want business today, given her customer service skills. We walked out deflated and disappointed. How dare this awful woman speak to my mother that way!

We loved stopping by on a Saturday morning, buying a few slices of plain, onion, pizza or raisin focaccia and heading across the street to the park to enjoy our breakfast/lunch/brunch/snack. We were SO happy to return here this month while visiting SF to discover that NOTHING HAD CHANGED! Well, the price had gone up a little, but it's still such a great deal. Also, the neighborhood has really changed. North Beach is barely an Italian neighborhood anymore, which is so sad. But at least Liguria has survived! Believe the people who say that they run out by 11 a.m. on Saturday. And bring cash. Everyone visiting SF should stop here. Or, rather, they shouldn't - so there's more left for me when I visit!", "author": "Cynthia H."}

It's in the back where the taste treats are found. Each loaf is wrapped in string and butcher paper like a present and is reasonably priced at $4.00 to $5.00 per loaf. Be sure to arrive early as there will be lines and different flavors run out. My personal favorite is raisin, but I've had the plain and rosemary breads as well. \n\nUnfortunately, there are no seats inside the bakery but just outside is Washington Square where you can sit on a bench and enjoy watching tai chi from different groups from Chinatown. You may have to also fight off a few greedy pigeons in the park who are eagerly eyeing your bread.\n\nBe sure to also bring your own drinks or coffee as Liguria just sells focaccia bread. Every time I've visited the staff is the same and the quality of the bread remains as good as previous visits. \n\nSan Francisco is not a cheap city and eating out can be expensive. For a reasonably priced breakfast, Liguria Bakery is a find. The focaccia is filling and delicious and a large loaf won't last past breakfast. I've tried to carry a loaf in my backpack for a snack later but the bread never lasts long. \n\nFor a taste of the \"real Italy\" in San Francisco, Liguria Bakery is the place.", "author": "Steve N."}

On the corner of Stockton and Filbert street, this family-owned operation makes the most delicious, chewy, and soft focaccia that melts in your mouth. Their dough has no preservatives and is mixed in an antique machine, which is then baked in a large brick oven that you can see behind the counter when you order. You can buy them in an 8-by-10 inch sheet, wrapped in plain white paper and tied up with a string, or ask them to slice it for you into bite-size pieces so you can eat it before you're even out the door. \n\nI tried the mushroom, pizza, onion, and rosemary garlic. I must say, my absolute favorite was the pizza. The tomato sauce had the perfect amount of tanginess and sweetness, and the scallions sprinkled on top gave it a great texture.

One of my friends tragically lost her husband a few weeks back.

They refused, chastised her and made a simple situation much much worse.\n\nLiguria will keep plugging along and do great business.  There was no hardship on them as they would have sold out what they made (and they were offered payment by my friend).\n\nSometimes, people just need to remember that no matter how popular you are and how much people enjoy your business, every customer is important and every interaction can result in a customer for life or losing business from the way you treat people.\n\nShame on you Liguria - you lost more than just a single sale - you lost a few customers as well as some respect.", "author": "Kurt L."}

There's like ten varieties.\n\nThey'll wrap the sheets up in butcher paper for you and tie it up with string.  If you want to eat now, you need to tell them to cut the sheet up.   Then they'll put the strips in a paper bag for you with a stack of paper napkins.  Take your brown paper bag full of cut up focaccia and go over to the park.  Find a bench.

When I called to place the order the women was already hesitant to take it over the phone since they only take cash.  I told her I'd pick it up on the Saturday before the memorial service (the service was on Sunday) - gave her the specific dates, and off we went.  I get a call the week before from one of the women who was irritated asking when I was coming in to pick up my order.  I told her there was a mistake it was the following weekend - I felt so bad (for her mistake) that I even offered to pay for the order she had that day in addition to the next week's order.

So when the hubby and I planned a trip to SF I signed us up for a food safari (walking tour) of   North Beach. The tour was super duper cheap so I didn't expect too much...I was soooo wrong! This was one of the many delicious eateries that we were introduced to. We would have never ever tried this little gem if it weren't for the tour. \n\nThis small family run bakery specializes in different varieties of focaccia. I have never been a fan of focaccia because the times I have tried it I found it too hard and flavorless. That was until I found this  amazing bakery. As soon as you walk in the door the beautiful aromas entice your palate. I have never been a fan of the herb, rosemary. I decided that it was time to try focaccia and rosemary again...at the same time. We ordered one (loaf) rosemary & garlic focaccia. I cautiously tried a bite, almost expecting to dislike it, but instantly I was converted. It was so good that I ate a good majority of the whole thing!\n\n I should have brought some home to my carb loving children...I undoubtedly would have become their favorite parent. \n\nThey only accept cash and we were told they sell out before the posted closing hours.

It wasn't our usual sourdough loaf, and was nothing like the sliced bread in the drawer. It was this flat bread called Fugasa. (or Foccacia) An Italian flat bread that has a ragu of some sort, covered in green onions and baked to perfection. It was square pizza without the toppings. It had a light and airy texture with a salty kick. And I loved every square inch of it. It came gift wrapped in butcher paper with a little string around it, as if it were Christmas. Now as an adult, that first bite always takes me back to those days of fond memories that will be with me forever. \n\nThis past week I found myself deep in the heart of San Francisco. I have been trying to get out to Liguria for awhile and finally found the time. I knew the rules before I got there. There is no room for amateurs, this is the big leagues.

There was already a line of about a dozen people in and outside of this little bakery. It was an odd sight with empty shelves and two women working at the counter with butcher paper and string. Everyone was smiling and ordering in multiples. One guy ahead of me had more than twenty. \n\nThe prices were amazing. At first I was confused, people were ordering these big sheets. The price list topped out at $5. I wanted a sheet, but didn't know how much it'd be. I figured the prices would be for small squares. I was so wrong; it was for the whole sheet!\n\nI'll admit that I wanted one of each so I could find the one I liked best. With the slabs being so big, a rare exercise of self restraint was in order. I bought only two: rosemary-garlic and a mushroom. Both were incredible. The mushroom was sparsely decorated with yummy fungi. The rosemary-garlic had a wonderful pronounced garlic flavor that didn't overwhelm the rosemary. I would get them again, but I'd like to try more.\n\nThe two women behind me in line were old-time regulars exchanging memories of their past visits. Wonderful to hear the tales.

In fact, I think every Italian restaurant should serve Liguria's focaccia - forget bread and butter, bread sticks and maybe even garlic bread! \n\nSince childhood, there's only two things that Liguria makes... fresh baked focaccia and Liar's cookies... \n\nThe plain focaccia alone is so flavorful from the brushing of olive oil then lightly salted to the soft and airy bread. Topped with mushrooms or green onions or garlic or rosemary and even pizza (smothered with pizza sauce and green onions only)... ALL DELICIOUS! \n\nAlso delicious, Bugias or Liar's cookies. Bugia is liar in Italian. The story goes that these fried pieces of dough with hints of citrus were always being stolen from the cookie jar. The cookies were covered with powdered sugar so that a trail of powdered sugar would lead to who really stole the cookies from the cookie jar! A sweet tale for these lightly sweetened, crisp cookies.\n\nSome tips:\n\n* Get in early for the best selection- cause they do sell out.\n* You can pre-order days before for pick up, but it won't be the freshest cause they pack em in the morning and sit there til picked up. \n* You can request for focaccia to be sliced, but they tend to stale faster. \n* Purchase frozen focaccia - it's cheaper and so convenient for random pasta nights when Liguria is closed! \n* Cash only.\n\nLast tip:\n* Enjoy the SF Giants memorabilia while snacking on a piece of rosemary garlic focaccia (my fave)!

Way before focaccia got trendy.  Been through all of the changes in staff and prices (once 15 cents a sheet!).  \n\nWhat I don't appreciate is the surly service from the older woman.  I have had a number of incidences from her.  Once, when I called to confirm that they were open that day, her sassy retort was, \"I answered the phone, didn't I?\"  Who needs that?  \n\nGot back at her because another time, when I asked for some frozen pizzas from the upright freezer (btw, a bargain at $3, freezes and reheats beautifully), she picked through them for the flattest ones.  It was really obvious since I only wanted 4 sheets and she put back fluffier ones also marked \"T\" for Tomato. Not to be duped, I sent her to the back to also fetch me a fresh sheet and bought more time by having her slice it.  I then snuck  back to the freezer and switched out the flat ones for plumper ones!!!  When she came back out, she either didn't notice or was too embarrassed to observe how much my pizzas had \"risen\".  LOL!!!\n\nToday, I phoned and got the nicer younger woman, who said she still had some frozen pizzas still available that I then rushed over to buy.  When I arrived, only the older woman was at the counter and without even checking the freezer automatically said there was no more. Really?  By then, the younger woman remembered speaking to me on the phone not only got me my pizzas but let me pick.\n\nI suppose Liguiria is successful enough to not worry about a Fogaccia Nazi at the front counter.  Because it is a San Francisco institution, customers will tolerate its limitations, such as sporadic hours and surly staff.  I will continue to go because Liguirua is a one trick pony with an awesome product and I like supporting small family run businesses, well, most of their family.", "author": "Elizabeth D."}

My grammar school used to (and I'm sure still does) sell slices of their pizza focaccia bread for 25 cents a slice (thought I'm sure inflation has driven those prices up since back then).  This was a treat that I looked forward to every where through 8th grade.  Once I moved on to high school I forgot all about the place.\n\nFast forward 8 years and I had since moved back to San Francisco and happen to live 3 blocks away from a guy I became friends with in college.  One day I'm hanging at his house and he offers me some focaccia bread...low and behold it is the very same focaccia bread I used to eat in grammar school.  My friend gave me the address to Liguria and it quickly became one of my favorite food places.\n\nI have had several of the different focaccia breads they make here (rosemary, garlic, onion and mushroom) and they are all pretty good.  They are fluffily and fresh...but the star of the store is the pizza.  Each sheet is toped with a tomato sauce and covered with green onions.  The end result is a juicy and delicious.\n\nNOTE FOR FIRST TIMERS: Liguria Bakery sells out quickly.  They make a certain amout a day and once they sell out they close so you should always try and get there before 10 am (I usually go around 9) if you want to be able to choose from everything.

The old Italian lady comes into the nearly empty front room and says nothing to me.  Just stares and waits.  So I tell her I would like the rosemary garlic focaccia and she grabs it with her bare hands, wraps it in the paper, ties it up and says \"five dollars\".  I pay her and leave and later when I try the DELICIOUS focaccia, I laugh to myself about how quirky and unique this place is.

It wasn't a \"maybe if we have time\" stop, it was a \"someone will die if we don't go there\" stop. So we did, right before we hit the airport. I bought a pizza, rosemary garlic and mushroom to go and we also got a pizza sliced up to eat in the park. I didn't know that you could get it sliced up to eat right there. They just cut the sheet into 8 pizza sticks, so that you can grab and munch. I never had the pizza one before so was anxious to try it. GL said that it was good based on the reviews he read. \n\nVerdict on pizza: eh. It is what you would think it would be, it's only tomato sauce. Mind you, it's good, but it is really wet and makes the focaccia soggy, so the focaccia is really the victim here. That didn't stop us from finishing them while watching a tai chi battle in the park though. \n\nThe mushroom is tried and true. I took a couple of pieces of mushroonm on the plane with me the next day, and it was still soft and so yummy. I wish I had taken the whole thing because airplane food is just getting even more digusting. If that's possible. \n\nEach piece, which is about 12x5 inches is about $4 or $4.50 and totally worth it.

I know it's all about the bread, but when you walk up to the counter and say hello, you don't expect them to just glance at you and turn back to their friend and continue their Italian conversation for another 2 min before turning back to you with an expectant look.  Ok, yes, I know, this is SF, not Austin, but still.  And I know it's not just the cultural thing, because I've been to northern Italy and most there are very  friendly.

The only change is that over the years, they have added more flavors.  When you go there you have to know what you want or they will go to the next customer.  Like Seinfeld's \"soup Nazi\".

I live in San Francisco, and my wife and kids spend every summer 8 weeks in Italy, 4 in Milan and 4 in Chiavari, which is a town 3 train stops east of Recco, where focaccia was invented.  Liguria Bakery is not that great.  I know it is an institution in San Francisco, but if you think you're having something special, you're being duped.  Don't get me wrong, I eat it, and it beats many other american focaccias, just like I eat pizza here: because I feel like pizza even if it is not like at home, better than nothing.  And the price is good, but it is nowhere near original focaccia ligure.  Plus, I am sorry, but I cannot stand the sour, crotchety old lady at the counter.  There is nothing salvageable about that kind of behavior to customers.  You would not experience that misery in an Italian bakery, or focacceria.

That being said, I was very excited when I found this place and my boyfriend has been here many times. He said it's good, but not that good and I would have to say that agree with that sentiment.\n\nIf you're in the area the Pizza focaccia is great, but their hours are frustrating. We tried to come here (usually made it before 12 and they're not so good about answering the phone) THREE TIMES and two of the three times they were closed. Which is a hassle if you live across town. And if you call to try to have them set it aside for you, they don't hold it after a certain time, which I do understand because they want to sell everything, but if you don't even hold it for 30 minutes, that's not cool :( Although, I know they're popular so they can afford to be fussy.\n\nThe Pizza is the best flavor since the actual bread can be a bit dry. I like my focaccia a bit more oily than how Liguria makes it, but I suppose that's not good for the diet. But if you're going to be eating a ton of carbs, might as well!! Another thing I didn't like is the canned-type ingredients they use as their toppings. I can't say for sure that they are canned mushrooms, olives, etc. since I didn't see the actual cans, but it certainly tasted like it to me. \n\nI don't think I would make a special trip for this focaccia again unless I was REALLY craving a fix, but if I was in the area I guess I'd pick one up (if they're open!!).", "author": "Victoria J."}

I was a newbee and decided to only order one sliced rosemary and garlic foccacia bread. It was so warm, fluffy, chewy and flavorful.

Little did I know that this store would be the place for the best Focaccia Bread in all of the Bay Area. \n\nBefore Liguria Bakery the only time I eat Focaccia Bread would be with my pasta whenever I go to some Italian Restaurant. I never realized that it would be a great meal all on its own. \n\nSo after a wonderful breakfast at Mama's, my wife, daughter, and I walked across the street to this empty shop. I didn't really know what to order because they had so many different flavor. I decided to take the safe route and got the Garlic Focaccia Bread since that was something I tasted before. So I got one full order for $5 and took it home for our late snack. \n\nMy first bite of this Garlic Focaccia Bread, I was already hooked. This was the best G-- D--- bread I ever had.

I saw a good amount of customers spending $30-50 on focaccia bread?! I've had good focaccia bread but not good enough to buy sheets and sheets of it. So my expectations rose dramatically.\n\nThe menu surprised me. There were about eight different kinds of focaccia. Two women work the front. They run this place with true veteran's gruff. It's an odd pleasure to watch two women wrap up up stacks of focaccia like bundles of newspaper. What's strange is that once a customer makes their order they have to walk into to the back room and pull off the bread from cooling racks then walk back in to wrap it. There's a lot of storage space in the front where they could put the bread yet it's kept empty. Maybe it stinks up the place and makes the bread stale faster? There has to be a reason. They're don't rush because people are willing to wait.\n\nI ordered the raisin as well as the rosemary garlic focaccia bread. I expected better. Yeah it's good but it's just like eating pizza sticks. They don't put on a ton of toppings so the flavor isn't anything \"wow\". I imagine if you're a huge lover of garlic bread you'll love this place. I did like the raisin focaccia much better than the rosemary garlic. Butter and raisins, yum.

Head across the street to load up on more mind blowing carbs for later.  No brainer!\n\nMy group stopped by Liguria to get focaccia for lunch/dinner later in the day.  We went with the black olive and rosemary garlic breads which were $5 a piece tax included.  The nice lady behind the counter wrapped them up old school style with paper and string.  Walking in this place is sorta like stepping back in time.  I seriously don't think they have updated anything in the whole place in 30 years, but it must be working.  The focaccia was so amazingly good.  Soft and chewy with just the right amount of olive old and toppings.  The garlic rosemary was definitely my fav, but the olive was in a strong second.  Lay some italian meat on this bread and you have an experience!", "author": "Tripp W."}

For me, that person was my friend Agnes who used to live a block from Liguria over 30 years ago.  (Thank you Agnes!)\n\nA bakery that sells only foccacia?  Wowza.  Do we live in a great city or what?      \n\nIf walking by, I probably wouldn't stop in because it's nondescript on the outside and if you peer in, you'd see just a long white counter and some mostly bare shelves behind it.  But if you go inside, then you'd see a board (old school style) that lists the types of foccacia (pizza, plain, raisin, rosemary, black olive, mushroom, etc.) and prices (around $4).  You can also get frozen ones.         \n\nThe foccacias are about 8 x 10 inches and you can get it cut up into pieces if you like.  Agnes remarked that back in the day, it used to be $0.85 for the foccacia and $0.05 to cut it.  Whereupon the old lady sitting in the corner piped up and informed us, \"We haven't done that in YEARS.\"  Now they cut it for free.  (Nevermind the fact that it is no longer $0.85.)  One thing that hasn't changed?  The foccacia selling out.  Get there early!    \n\nI had the pizza foccacia which was topped with tomato sauce and green onions.  Now being a fervent devotee to all that is cheese I was skeptical of a pizza sans the good stuff but it was delizioso!

Don't let the spartan decor fool you...it doesn't look like much from the outside, but this place has some of the most incredible, most amazing, foccacia bread you will ever taste.  Been coming here for years and have had pretty much all of the different varieties they make.  The pizza one is my all-time favorite, but I also love the ones with garlic.  Even the plain and green onion ones are really good.  The pizza one is celestial when heated up in the oven, perhaps with a little high quality mozzarella cheese.\n\nI read somewhere a while ago that Liguria Bakery actually used to sell bread when it first opened in 1911.  Apparently, in competing with the big name bread companies of that era, they discovered that the larger bakeries were intentionally selling at a loss and giving free bread to new accounts to gain their business.  The grandfather or relative of the current owner was said to have told the others that they were not in business to make it, just to give it away.  At that point, they decided to specialize in foccacia instead and history was made!\n\nTwo things to keep in mind...Come Early and Cash Only.  If you go late, it is pretty much certain that they will be sold out.  Once they sell out, they are closed for the day, sometimes as early as 1PM if the weather and sales are good.  \n\nHere's two more lesser known things that you might not be aware of.  If you're craving Liguria Bakery's foccacia bread, but don't feel like driving to North Beach or fighting for parking, Andronico's recently carries a couple varieties of Liguria's foccacia bread.  Pretty convenient!  Also, if you go to Gino & Carlo's (bar) early morning on weekends, they often have free Liguria bakery foccacia bread for their customers there although it is served cold.\n\nI could totally picture Tony Soprano walking in here with a smile and picking up a slab or two tied with string for his friends at the Bing.

I think its a North Beach Sicilian tradition....\n\nOur cousins Vincenzo and Sarah Jane are still in charge of getting it as they are the only ones who still live in the neighborhood. They actually own the place I was born in (Francisco and Grant). Well, specifically the hospital was Mt. Zion, but I had the living room (alt. title: \"the front room\") all to myself for the first 2 years of my life. No wonder it's my favorite room! My entry into the family forced the move into bigger digs down the peninsula, which sucks cause I would have loved to have grown up calling this city home.\n\nNani made two kinds of home-made foccacia. The margarita (which is the standard flavor of awesome at Liguria) and anchovy. The only thing wrong with the anchovy kind was...well...the fucking anchovies....I'm not sure if the fond memories of grandmother cooking and cleaning for us (man, that lady could iron!) lean me towards any bias or not, but I'll note here that Liguria comes a close second. You see, my grandmother never had to use words to tell us she loved us. She just fed it to us.\n\nAnd that's that for the wistful melancholy...\n\nI kind of fell into this entry on the list. My sister Stephanie's surprise 25th anniversary (holy shit!) party was a couple of weekends ago and this was being served in plentiful doses. Once the surprise ended and the drinking started, I got to mingling with old family. As far as my mom's family goes, I'm known by two characteristics:\n\n1) \"Sarah's Son\" which may make it onto my epitaph.\n2) \"Computer guy\"\n\nOnly Vince allows me a third dynamic. Now, I haven't played league soccer in 20+ years. But our conversation since the time I was ten has always been (verbatim, I'm not shitting you):\n\n1)Sarah's Son: Hi Vince, good to see you.\n2)Vincenzo: How are you? You still likedah soccer?\n\nNow from the age of 15 to about twenty-five, I argued my case:\nI do not play soccer.\nI do not enjoy soccer.\nI do not likedah soccer. \n\nAround my mid 20s (someone's funeral or wedding likely) the battle of wills had been lost and Vince could claim victory. I now answer that I love soccer, and play it every chance I get...\n\nI also no longer have any convictions about anything else. At least Vince doesn't gloat. He's a good man, Vince.\n\nOverall - the party was a success. Tears were shed for those who left us in the last 25 years and toasts were made over those we welcomed into our lives.\n\nAnd - I got to take home about 30 pieces of foccocia! It only lasted about 2 days between Earl and I.\n\nMust go back there soon.\n\nSummary\n\nFood: I likedah foccacia! 5/5 2nd cousins on my mother's side twice removed.\nDrink: I fluidly eased between beer and wine like a gazelle sprinting on the safari plains. I don't know where that came from either... 3/5 irrelevant analogies.\nDB factor: Love seeing old family, unless they ask me to fix their computer.

There are nine different types of focaccia and the plain, pizza, and garlic are hands-down my favorites.\n\nThis place is about as old school as Mary Jane's and penny loafers, right down to the way they wrap the focaccia (with white paper tied with string) to the no-nonsense counterperson (she is there to only sell focaccia and take your money and the only words out of her mouth will be how much you owe her).  It is spotless inside with minimal decorations and product (focaccia is the only thing they sell, nothing more), however, you can tell Liguria has been around for quite some time by the old time equipment and the way things are worn.\n\nGet there as early as you can as the focaccia sells out fast, especially around the holidays and make sure you bring cash as this is the only type of payment they accept.", "author": "Kevin L."}

It seemed like an odd store, with some weird toys in the window, and a faded sign. But one day this guy asked me if I had been there and told me they had the best focaccia on the planet. And he was right!\n\nThere's nothing fancy about the place - it's small, one sign with the menu (the types of focaccia they sell), and two grumpy Italian ladies on the other side of the counter. Cash only. I started with the pizza one, recommended by the date. It was UNBELIEVABLE!!! It's been over a year since that moment in time, and I have tried all of them - mushroom, black olives, green onion, garlic, rosemary, rosemary and garlic, jalapeno and cheese and raisin. They are ALL very good, but as I love garlic, the garlic ones are still my favorite, before the pizza one. It really depends on your taste, but I think it's worth trying them all!\n\nEveryone already said it, and I will repeat: get there early as they always sell out, especially if you want the garlic or pizza focaccia.

And when you're eating it it's so light! Then you look at your fingers and the parchment paper, and it's just covered in oil. So worth it! It's not like super soft or airy, seems just dense enough. The Rosemary isn't overwhelming, which I think Rosemary tends to be. The super garlic countered it, so works very well together. I would not suggest eating this right before an important meeting or a first date, or meeting a vampire. Knock someone out that garlic!\n\nThe pizza is my fave. Its just so juicy and and just savory enough. Can't get enough. Its not super herby or bursting with extreme tastes like the garlic one, but it's very light so you can eat a lot. This is also the one that brings back the good ol kid days.. And that's something I can't just find at any old place.\n\nMake the trek, you won't be disappointed.

After visiting once before and enjoying I returned on the 5th of February.  When I entered there was an older woman behind the counter.   When I received neither eye contact nor a greeting I didn't panic.  I'm originally from New York City where indifference accompanies most transactions.\nI ordered the rosemary and garlic and requested 4 quarters for my expired parking meter.\nHer response, \"If you want quarters go to a bank.\"\nI paused for a moment, swallowing hard and thinking that perhaps I was misunderstood.  \nI repeated my request, being especially clear that I wanted to purchase Focaccia, that my car was just outside the door and that I wanted to feed the meter to avoid an expensive ticket.\nThe response, \"if you want quarters go to a bank.\"\nI then attempted to go the creative route and I got very specific asking if in my change she might be kind enough (I mean this literally as I asked \"if you would be kind enough\") to give me 4 quarters.\nThe response, \"you didn't hear me the first time?  If you want change go to a bank.\"\n\nI'm a reasonable man.  I understand that Liguria is not a bank and has no obligation to give a customer change or even to be nice.   However, I was at a loss to understand the contempt.  \n\nOur exchange ended as I told her she was a real charmer.  She told me to \"get lost.\"\n\nI realize that the Focaccia is good.  Heck, I enjoyed it the first time which is why I  returned in the first place.  But at over $5 for a piece of bread who needs the abuse?  It's clear to me that business has gotten so good over there that they have adopted the puzzling \"we don't need your business attitude.\" \n\nI ask you Yelp readers.... with all of the great food and grateful restaurateurs serving us in the bay area why would anyone give business to a place that is not only unfriendly, but also contemptuous of its customers?  \n\n\nYour wish has been granted Liguria......No Focaccia for me!!!", "author": "evan b."}

I decided to go in and check it out since I had at least another hour of waiting at Mama's.  Inside is completely bare bones.  An old Italian lady behind a counter and a single sign listing 10 types of focaccia.  You just tell her what kind you want and she goes in the back to get it.  Very old school packaging as well.  The foccacia is stacked and wrapped in wax paper and then tied shut with string.  \n\nThe best part is when you get to eat it!  Absolutely amazing!  The best foccacia I've ever had.  I've tried the pizza, jalapeo no and cheese and rosemary foccacias but my favorite is the pizza.  I even went as far as to go back to buy several slabs (each is about 12x10in) and hosting a pizza party with it.  Just get some nice mozzarella and some toppings and people can make their own personal pizzas.  \n\nAlso don't forget that they close as soon as they sell out so either call in early to put in an order or else make sure to get there before noon.

Otherwise your stuck with the ugly sister foccacia options. By early that means 9 am on a weekend. So no sleeping in. Parking is a piece of cake around the square around 7 or 8 am.

You are not going to get congenial customer service here, count yourself lucky if you get a smile or even a \"Hi\" back from the old lady behind the bar. I mean that in the nicest way of course.

The storefront is surprisingly void of any sign that this place sells some of the best foccacia I've ever had- the shelves are bare and empty.\n\nIn any case, I decided to get the pizza and the mushroom out of the list of about 7 varieties.  I was there at 11:30 am and the garlic was already sold-out- I guess I have to endeavor to get there even earlier to make sure everything is still in stock.  They did have the rosemary garlic on hand so I ordered that as well.  I'm glad I did because the rosemary garlic was my favorite of the three.  The rosemary smelled great while the garlic was fantastic and carmelized, though not particularly good for your breath.  Mushroom was a close second and my least favorite was the pizza- I thought the tomato sauce was a little too sweet.  Overall though, Liguria bakes some kick-ass foccacia- great toppings, with perfect texture, and a crisp bottom.  \n\nMy only complaint- it can be a little oily with a little too much salt sprinkled on top, but that's minor.  4.5 stars rounded up to 5 and I'll most definitely be back.  Remember its cash only and don't be surprised if you've finished your sliced foccacia within a block of the bakery- its that good!", "author": "Angela H."}

Cannot wait to take a bite into one after a buying a few slabs.  Focaccia from the other local bakers in the Bay Area are decent, but in my opinion, Liguria sets the standard.  Their focaccia has a nice soft top, but the bottom has a little bit of crustiness to give it that pleasant crunch.  The tomato, mixed with green onions, is absorbed deep enough for a complete taste.\n\nIt's difficult to find parking around Washington Square, but this focaccia is worth it.\n\nNote: If you have any leftovers (hard to believe), you can freeze it.

Honestly, the only one I've had often enough to talk about is their tomato and green onion foccacia.  It is absolutely the best anywhere.  I've tried foccacia from other bakeries and they are so far inferior it isn't funny.  This is one of those places that has no real set hours even though it's stated on their door.  When the foccacia runs out, and it often does, the doors get locked.  I drive up from Foster City to get this stuff.  Talk about addiction, one can easily get addicted to this stuff.  As much as I hate to freeze food, this stuff freezes great if wrapped properly.  I don't know if you've discovered this, but it seems that the fresher baked goods are when they are frozen, the fresher they'll be upon defrosting.  Other bakeries don't seem to put enough sauce or olive oil on their tomato focaccias.  \n\nThis place has been in business since the early 1900's.

If you take out the years I had to eat pureed foods, I would say I have been eating this stuff for about 28 years. Amazing, yes?\n\nBeing born and raised in North Beach is one of the best things that can ever happen to anyone. It's quiet apart from the fire house that's on Stockton. And the location is ideal to just about everything you need. Chinatown? Just a few blocks away. Little Italy? You're in it, son. Fisherman's Wharf? Just head towards the water. Awesome, ain't it?\n\nAnd along with the fine neighborhoods that are around me, there's this gem of a place. Liguria. Making focaccia for as long as most people have been around. Still the same white interior but no longer are the shelves and windows lined with raisin bread and the Stella cookies. And Mr. Scirocco is no longer working as much as he used to. But he deserves to take it easy. Dude's been making focaccia for forever. Now, his wife and kids run the place. Mary runs the front of house with mom and her brother makes the bread with other people in the wee morning hours before the crack of anything. And the prices are very decent. Not like they were before when a pizza was a buck and a quarter and cutting is an extra nickel. What a bargain. Times have changed. No more butting charge and the most expensive is 4 and a quarter, I think. Still a great price for the quality they produce for you.\n\nSure, it may be greasy but that's the love and olive oil they drizzle on the pan and dough to make it taste sooo good. It's okay if it stains your fingers with the red sauce. Just lick it off and show off the proof of eating a Liguria's focaccia, the best in the City if not the US, in my opinion.", "author": "Anthony L."}

You can have it whole, or ask them to slice it - but do NOT ask them to slice a big order. Mary'll give you a big scowl, and when it's packed - rightfully so.\n\nThe bread is soft, the aroma subtle, and the flavor shockingly good. As it has been mentioned here, they only take cash, the lines can be long on weekend mornings, and they do tend to sell out by noon. But you can also get frozen focaccia on occasion - it never hurts to ask. Not only is this a backup if they run out, but it's also a bit cheaper.

They just don't make that many, and they don't care since they have many orders from restaurants.\n\n2) Like Golden Gate Bakery, those people that work/own the place just don't care about their customers. They have this I-don't-give-a-sh*t-about-you attitude. Another similarity is both shut down couple times a year for a month. Not Many places can do that.", "author": "Ed W."}

I have seriously been eating focaccia from here since I began to eat solid foods. My parents are pretty hardcore Chinese and prefer Chinese baked goods, but even they had to succumb to the wonderful delights of this bakery. Despite the fact that my parents insist on eating the focaccia as a side to their jook (congee), long ago I decided to be more traditional and skip the jook part. I remember when this place only had green onion, raisin and plain as the only varieties. I thought their insistence on making their favorite traditional flavors was rather charming. The menu has since grown but it has continued to maintain its charm and character over the decades.\n\nThe raisin and green onion are still my favorite. The focaccia is baked to the perfect shade of golden brown and is finished with a touch of olive oil. The green onion adds a slightly crunchy texture to the bread and infuses it with a wonderful savoriness. The raisins are a perfect complement to the mouth-watering focaccia as it adds texture and hints of sweetness to the crunchy, and perfectly chewy texture of the bread.\n\nThis place is simply heavenly.\n\nTip #1: Get here early because Liguria only makes a limited amount each day and closes the store once it sells out.\n\nTip #2: Please take the time and effort to enjoy this delight fully by eating it while it is warm. I promise you won't regret it", "author": "Gary L."}

They take their sweet ass time and only take cash. I do not lie when I say my very own aunt was soup nazi'd from Liguria because she got there 20 minutes late to pick up an order. They told her never to come back. It sullied the family name. We could no longer make preorders when that was still allowed. My Italian grandfather may have considered disowning her.

And no Italian Christmas is complete without this stuff.\n\nTHIS STUFF IS MAGICAL!!!!!! It is perfect. Exactly what you need in Focaccia. The right mix of flavor, oiliness, saltness, and plain old wonderfulness.

Every couple of weeks or so, he brings in Huge stacks of focaccia for us, and I stuff myself with enough carbs to last an entire month ;)   It is SO good. And now they have a couple new flavors, mushroom focaccia, olive focaccia, and rosemary. I didn't care much for the olive one. It's just canned sliced black olives tossed on top of the plain focaccia. But the mushroom.... YUM!!! it's sauteed mushrooms on top of plain lightly salted focaccia. My favorite is still the pizza one. Something about tomato sauce that I love. But as the other reviewers have said, make sure you get there early cause as soon as they run out, they will close. The don't have set hours, and in the summer time they close the shop for 3 weeks, as their vacation time.", "author": "Marina K."}

The string is then cut using the finger (not a pair of scissors).  If you want a backrub while you're waiting - go somewhere else.

I can't wait to get more! If you have not tried this foccocia before, you are totally missing out, let your tastebuds live a little and make a trip down to get some. Best carb indulgence. Raisin, green onion, garlic or pizza- all are a little slice of heaven.", "author": "Rhea A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-04-21", "description": "The foccacia here is very tasty, sometimes a little too oily, but very good. I give them three stars because they don't seem to care about sanitation. They handle cash and then go handle their product with bare hands. It's been mentioned in an earlier review. Nostalgia for old-school style aside, just because you are popular and have been functioning as such for years does not mean you cannot upgrade your mentality of sanitary standards. I am certain they've heard this before. How hard is it to slip on plastic gloves before handling the bread? Really... how hard?", "author": "Maria Y."}

If you thought you never liked Foccacio bread you might be mistaken once you've tried Liguria Foccacio - available in raisin, onion, plain and pizza. If you live in North Beach/Telegraph Hill you probably already know that they are usually sold out by noon if not earlier so for the rest of us set your alarm clocks for bright and early and put on your coat because the trip will be well worth it.", "author": "Sequoia N."}
