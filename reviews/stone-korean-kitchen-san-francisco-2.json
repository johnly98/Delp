Google maps lied and took me somewhere else. I completely passed this restaurant and went somewhere else because of Google maps. Luckily after calling the restaurant, I was able to find it. The restaurant is located right in front of the fountain the shoots gree water. The location is gorgeous, plenty of seating, gets busy at lunch hours. The food is pretty good, they also have hot suace which I appreciated. Great place to go for food and for site seeing. Completely forgot to tell you about the bowl. There could have beeb a bit more kitchen, I only had like 4 pieces, the vegetables were good, spinach was a bit overcooked. Their kimchi is different not your typical kimchi, but it could just have been different for the bowl.\n\nUpdate: Also had the chicken curry cutlets. It was good but super spicy. I shouldn't have added the extra hot sauce but I wanted the extra flavor. Try it out, it's good.", "author": "Maria N."}

Stopped by for dinner with a group of friends.\n\nWe ordered a few things to share. We started with a calamari appetizer, which was decent -- the squid was seasoned very well with some slightly spicy flakes, and the creamy sauce went well with the crispy batter. \n\nWe ordered a kalbi, which came with about 8 small cuts of beef. The meat was very juicy though a bit too greasy for my preference. Portion size was quite small for the price.\n\nWe also ordered two bibimbaps, one with beef and one with spicy pork. Both of them were quite bland and extremely dry. Especially the spicy pork, which came in very small cubes, which was not quite what I expected.\n\nService was okay, though a bit slow.", "author": "Alvin W."}

Overall, food was solid though given SF prices, we look for food to go above and beyond in some way.  We didn't quite get that here. \n\nWe came for dinner on a Wed night. We got:\n* the spicy wing with dry rub: was tangy. Nice crispy-ness. Small wings. Fine as wings go, but not above and beyond \n* kimchi fried rice with spicy pork belly: served in a stone bowl which is nice. The pork belly was in cubes and it felt like the spicy sauce was a superficial coating on the pork belly and the flavor was not throughout the meat. Hubs misses the old kimchi fried rice which had sausage in it. \n* Kalbi: good, njce quality of meat that did have nice marinated flavor. I somehow find the one I get at a Cupertino restaurant more addictive, but this one was a solid showing\n\nThey only had 3 banchan (potatos, fish cake, and kimchi) -- potatos were phenomenal (crunchy, fragrant with a sweet glaze).", "author": "Kathryn C."}

I've ordered the bibimbap with pork belly as well as the soondubu.\n\nBibimbap was decent, though rice was unevenly cooked and lacked the crispiness that is so precious in bibimbap. They gave a lot of rice, a decent amount of veggies and a sad amount of meat.\n\nSoondubu was beyond disappointing. I had ordered it without shrimp due to an allergy. 20 minutes into the meal, everyone in the group had received their food, but mine was nowhere in sight. I was told that my soondubu had been made with shrimp, that it was being remade and that it would be out in 3 minutes. 10 minutes later, my soondubu finally arrived. I was famished but disappointed. There were only 2 clams in the whole bowl, the pork belly was dry and the tofu came in one huge chunk. I could see the lines from the tofu container, which I have never seen in 15+ years of eating Korean food. I had ordered the soondubu medium spicy and it basically tasted like water mixed with gochujang. The rice was mushy and I can honestly say I've never had rice that bad before.\n\nVery disappointed and will be sticking to East Bay for Korean food from now on.", "author": "Jenn C."}

We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Stone Wings: Fried chicken wings tossed in our house sauces, Original: Sweet & Spicy ($10)\n*Soon Du Bu: Silken tofu stew with pork belly, shrimp, Manila clams, squid, zucchini, onions, and egg served with steamed rice, Spicy ($19)\n*Stone Kalbi: Marinated short ribs grilled over charcoal wood chips served with green leaf lettuce, sauces, and steamed rice ($22)\n\nThe kalbi was pretty good. Came on a bed of onions with lettuce wraps. I love veggies so I ended up using the onions with the beef in my wraps. The rest of the dishes I found a little bland. I love super spicy and flavorful soups, so the soondubu was a little tame for me. Also, not a lot of porky flavor for a stew with pork. The tofu was good though. Nice and silky. The wings weren't really sweet or spicy, so kinda weak in flavor for me. They were nice and crispy though. The banchan came in little sauce containers with I found weird, but we got a small variety of brussels sprouts, bean sprouts, and kimchi.\n\nDecent spot for Korean food.

This restaurant changed ownership in May, and with it they brought in a Korean chef and some new dishes. \n\nI went there last week and the owner briefly sat at my table and told me about how \"food is culture\", and that every day the head chef does little changes to make their food better.

It was interesting talking to him. \n\nThe Dol Sat Bibimbab had delicious pork belly and the crispy rice added a great texture. The Calbi was so tender and delicious.

Sometimes hard to wave the staff down for a check, depending on how busy it is, but otherwise it again comes out quickly.\n\nI've come here a few times and even when my friends order something else, we all usually agree that the bibimbap is one of the best items on the menu.  I usually order the ribeye version ($18), but tofu is also good ($16).  You can also ask for half-rice; they'll usually add more veggies/meat as a result, which is how I like my dolsot bibimbap.  Sometimes the beef is dry, so I'll add the spicy sauce or soy sauce to make it more moist.  They'll also add some non-traditional veggies into the bibimbap (like corn or bean sprouts) but nevertheless, I find it very filling.\n\nNothing spectacular about the food here, but nothing bad either.  When I'm desperate for Korean food and don't want to travel too far, I'm perfectly fine coming here.  But if a friend wants real Korean food, I'd think twice before bringing them here.

One of the things I noticed immediately was the disappointing banchan. The kimchi lacked flavor and that spicy+sour bite one is accustomed to when eating kimchi. The pickled cucumbers also needed an extra oomph. To me, the most disappointing plate was the sprouts. They're typically served cold. These were warm. *collective gasp* I just could *not* get over that! Moreover, the sesame oil that is usually prominent in the sprouts was hardly present. I could barely taste it. \n\nThe bibimbap was way overstuffed. You couldn't even mix the stone pot. Ingredients were falling out. I mean, dang, I like getting more bang for your buck but if the food falls out and on to the table... what's the point?! The chili sauce that goes into the bibimbap also lacked some intensity. The most problematic part of the bibimbap was the soggy rice at the bottom. There was no signature rice crust. My face upon seeing that: O_O \n\nWe also ordered the chicken wings which were good. In fact, that was the best dish of the meal. The calamari was also nice: fried well and with a good dipping sauce. The beef noodle soup was rather one-dimensional.

Last night, June 12th was the first and absolute last time I will ever go to Stone Korean Kitchen. I brought someone very close to me for dinner there because I wanted it to be special, unfortunately I had to apologize for one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. \n\nI created a reservation via Yelp for 8:30 hours prior, on the Yelp page there is also a 15% off coupon off the entire order if you check in (I will get to this a little later). We arrived around 8:20 and sat down, the restaurant was pretty empty with two individuals sitting at the bar eating and one person eating alone near us. I brought up the fact we had reservations at 8:30 in case I would receive some type of communication from the restaurant or they may call, but I was ignored - no biggie!  Literally the moment we sat down, we weren't even able to open the menu's and the serve approached us and instead of asking how we were doing, saying hello or asked if we had any questions we were instructed that,  \"the kitchen is closed and we needed to order ASAP because the restaurant closes at 9:00PM.\" I instructed the waiter that we had reservations at 8:30 and we arrived and sat at our table 10 minutes prior to the start of the reservation but the kitchen is closed?! This was an annoyance to me, but unfortunately for me I'm kind of used to the treatment when I eat at certain restaurants, so we swiftly ordered. \n\nWe ordered two appetizers before we ordered our entrees, they didn't come until we received our entrees - another slight annoyance but we really weren't complaining (but by this time things are starting to add up as far as professionalism in a restaurant goes)\n\nWe received our food, and within two minutes of beginning to eat the restaurant over, two servers and the cook began to check in on is, not by asking if we needed anything, but rushing us so we can feel pressured to leave their establishment.  By this time it was was barley 8:35 (25 minutes before the restaurant actually closes and technically 5 minutes into our actual reservation). When I seen the original server, I flagged her down to let her know that we did check in with Yelp and there was a %15 coupon off of the entire order. She then went to the individual who creates the bill and let them know that I had the 15% off. The other server did mention that the coupon was valid  but the conversation instantly switched from English to Korean. Shortly after the conversation  in Korean ended, the server approached us and said that she apologized but the coupon wasn't valid anymore because the owner doesn't honor it. Once again, extremely annoyed but not surprised, at this point I started to keep record of the events of our evening at Stone Kitchen for a review. The food was decent, not the greatest Korean food, but still good. The original purpose of the Yelp review I was going to make was mostly about being rushed to order, closing early and not honoring the coupon. \n\nTowards the end of our meal, my friend went to the restroom as I was finishing up. The server then comes over to me again and says, 'sir, it's almost time for the restaurant to close and we're shutting down the computers so you need to pay now'.  At this point I am LIVID with the overall crappy service I have gotten since arriving.  I dropped my utensil, reached into my wallet and gave my credit card. I stated to my server that the service I have received here has been not only insulting but some of the worst I have EVER received in my life and I will never be returning. The server then smiled and walked away. At this point I have barley touched half of my food and had no interest in finishing it or taking home, because to me it was tainted with the experience. When my card was returned to me, it was by the other server who you could tell that she was in charge. Walking towards me, I thought she was going to apologize for the experience but then just decided to lie and make excuses. The other server said: \"We don't really check our Yelp for reservations, people don't really use it they just call and we don't honor the coupon from Yelp anymore\" While my friend and I are trying to explain the events of the evening and the areas of improvement, the server is showing she didn't care and laughed in our face - we simply got up, stopped talking, didn't make a scene and left.\n\nI am simply going to end this by saying you need to do better. People are more likely to leave bad reviews over good ones (alas, here we are!) and you have truly lost two customers. Right now, it doesn't seem like a lot, but these experiences keep coming up and you keep losing customers and you'll be closed because you're only concerned about the bottom dollar at not the customers you're supposed to cater to.", "author": "D.J.

I was one of the first in line to get it, but my only minor gripe was that I wish the meat and rice were a bit hotter though that's just a downside of catering. Overall, I really enjoyed the catering that Stone Korean Kitchen provides and would definitely recommend it!", "author": "Joshua M."}

In my opinion, Stone is definitely one of the better places to go for happy hour around the financial district. All of their small plates and alcohol are 50% off. You can get a pitcher of beer for $12 or a bottle of Soju for $7. That is basically unheard of in SF.\n\nFood wise, we had the jap chae, duk bok ki, original fried chicken wings, spam musubi, and bulgogi fries. With all of them being 50%, we got multiple of each appetizer. To be honest, they were all delicious and definitely work the price. I recommend getting whatever you are in the mood for because odds are, it's gonna be a lot of food for a little amount of money. \n\nThere's a bunch of outdoor seating but if it's like a regular SF day, it may be a bit cold/windy since they don't have any outside warmers. Inside it can get quite busy and a bit packed so if you have a big party for happy hour, I would probably recommend going outside. \n\nBe sure to check them out for your next happy hour if you like Korean food or cheap alcohol in general!", "author": "Eric L."}

Bibimbap was overpriced and mediocre. \n\nFOOD: \nDescription of Dolsot Bibimbap ordered via Eat24: our signature sizzling hot stone rice bowl served at 500\u00b0. Seasonal vegetables, sunny side up egg, steamed white rice, and your choice of: rib eye, grilled chicken, or crispy tofu \n\nActual \"Dolsot Bibimbap:\n- I have never been able to order dolsot (stone bowl) bibimbap  to go (searing hot, heavy block of stone to go, please!). I was excited to see how this would be done--perhaps, I thought, they will let it sit in the stone bowl before dumping it in the to go container. Alas! It was regular bibimbap (all the fixings, none of the crunch and sizzle from the stone) in a container ill fitted to support its weight (seriously huge portion).\n\nThe description on Eat24 described this dish containing \"seasonal vegetables,\" which manifested as greasy, raw cabbage. There were no other vegetables to speak of apart from the banchan I added. \n\nThe meat itself was too oily for my tastes and overwhelmingly sweet. It was supposedly rib eye, but I had the feeling I was eating ground hamburger throughout. \n\nThe portion itself was huge (2 meals worth for me), but at a restaurant that bills itself as higher end, I would have preferred quality over quantity. \n\nSERVICE: Very polite! Even offered me more banchan :) .\n\nAMBIANCE: For being so close to the waterfront, Stone doesn't take advantage. I would have hoped they would put the customers facing the water and the greeter at the door facing the street (locked). On the bright side, the people there longest can enjoy a nice view throughout the day :). Perhaps I was paying a premium on my dish for the view--in any case, I won't be back for the food.", "author": "Helen W."}

Traditional glass noodles, tossed with bulgogi (marinated rib eye), and julienned seasonal veggies with a hint of sesame oil. \n\n- Stone Wings:\nCrowd pleaser, I guarantee you'll need more than one order, you'll be forced to share as soon as the piping hot chicken comes out LOL. Lightly dusted in a dry batter, each bite offers crunchy perfection while the dark meat remains juicy. For the full chicken experience, request your wings \"naked\", with house sauces on the side for dipping.

It's actually how let down I felt after my wife and I had dinner late last week at Stone Korean in 4 Embarcadero. Stone's location is on the east face of the building which faces the Ferry Bldg. it took us some time to find it, but when we arrived my eyes lit up because we saw a large group of very fobby Korean dudes outside. Ok, good sign!\n\nAs I was preoccupied with work at the dinner table, I decided to order what my wife ordered and didn't really look at the menu of ingredients. It was called the Krazy Korean. We also got fried Korean chicken wings with their sweet sauce. \n\nWhen it came out, I had that \"Oh s--t Korean fusion\" moment. God I hate Korean fusion with a passion. So to politely describe what I thought this dohl sot bibimbap bastardization was, it started it's life right: white rice, veggies, but them it took its fusion course from there. They added this kimchi chigae type of sauce with strips of kimchi in it and they made sure you got enough to question if there was any rice in there. And to give it that extra fusion   last gut punch, a hamburger patty topped with a fried egg. $18 for this fusion mess. \n\nI reluctantly plunged the spoon into it and just tasted the thick almost corn starchy thick broth and tasted it. It was literally was a mangled fusion kimchi chigae broth thickened with something. Probably corn starch. It was not good to this Korean palate. In fact I looked up to see the wife's reaction.  She said it was good but I've seen her say the same word but more emphatically about something that was legitimately good. Then I tried to cut through the egg and hamburger. The hamburger was terribly over cooked. Like crumbly and grey. I pushed that aside and tried to stomach this meal. I got about a quarter of the way by eating every bite with the remaining bits of egg. Once the egg was gone, so too ended my meal. \n\nOnly one of us took our leftovers home. It wasn't yours truly. \n\nService was good but not outstanding. \n\nPerhaps next time I'll stick to the traditional bibimbap, but I'll probably not do this anytime soon.  \n\nOn a side note, in my new job there are three Korean Americans in my team.

Like the fact that they have indoor and outdoor seating at this place. I usually take seating inside since my friend told me about an encounter she had with someone outside and having a water bottle thrown at her. I've never had to wait whenever I come.  \n\nTIP: When you check in on yelp you get 15% off your entire order \n\nHonestly, I think this place is worth it only for Happy Hour (5-7PM). The most recent visit we saved over $80!\n\nService: It's average. Not the best and not the worst. But when you're there for happy hour it makes sense since they're packed and tend to leave you alone if you're with a group which I like. \n\nWhat i've tried:  \n- Calamari \n- Pan Fried Dumplings\n- Spicy Rice Cake\n- Bulgogi Fries \n- Wings \n\n^^ haven't had really any issues with anything. They're nothing worth 5 stars but for a happy hour it's totally worth it. \n\nDrinks\n- Soju: Mango, lychee, yogurt - Yogurt is my fave! \n\nThe servers are also very friendly about letting you know when happy hour is about to end and take your orders so you make the cut off time. \n\nWill be coming back", "author": "Keizzel C."}

I would only come here during happy hour because the half off on appetizers and drinks is a pretty good deal. \n\nThe food was alright and they give you big portions. The appetizers were ALOT. These are the dishes we tried:\n\n- Bulgogi Fries: The fries were so large! They kind of just put the sauce and meat on top and they didn't really stick to the fries but overall I thought it was a good dish.\n\n- Spam Fried Rice: My friend ordered this and it's an appetizer so it was only $4 with the happy hour deal! I was very suprised at how big it was, it looked like a normal sized portion so I don't know why this is considered an appetizer but hey, I'm not complaining. Friend said it was very ordinary though.\n\n- Kimchi Fried Rice: I ordered this but it's not an appetizer so it was kind of pricey. Overall I liked it and the sausages in it were very juicy and seasoned but I don't think it's worth the price. The flavor was decent though. \n\n- Spam sushi thing: Don't remember what this was called but it's basically a sushi roll with spam inside. Good portions and friends said it was yummy!\n\n- Bibimbap: Also not an appetizer so don't think it was worth the price. They do give a large portion though; we ended up taking half of it to go. Sauce was just the right amount of spice.\n\nThey also give free side dishes but they were kind of lacking. :( No fishcake or potatoes??? There were only spinach, kimchi, and bean sprouts... just the healthy ones I guess haha.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend just coming here during happy hour and ordering only appetizers.

My coworkers and I came during lunch and there was a ridiculous wait time to get indoor seating (it was super hot that day and we wanted AC). We opt-out for take out. The chicken was decent, it's not amazing and you won't rave about it to your friends but it's well flavored. The bulgogi fries were a major let down. As a fries lover, it did not do anything for me. The fries were not crispy and the bulgogi topping did not mix harmoniously. I rather have them as separate dishes. I wouldn't recommend.\n\nService was mediocre.

This restaurant is pretty big and has bar seating as well as indoor and outdoor seating.\n\nWhile I was craving bibimbap, I ended up ordering the soondubu because it was so chilly outside. The waitress brought three sides, and I couldn't stop laughing because kimchi looked diseased. Pale, white, and tasteless. I stopped laughing when I realized that it tasted the way it looked. So gross. But I liked the greens that were part of the banchan. I wish they had more options for the banchan but whatever.\n\nThe soondubu was alright. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely felt comforting after donating platelets and walking around in the nippy San Francisco weather. At that point, I was just happy to have food.

The red flags should have been that we could get in on a Friday night with 1 hours notice during prime dinner time. The location is convenient to FiDi but that is where the advantages end. \n\nWe came in around 5:15 (to make a baseball game) and were the only ones there. I was really excited to order the Tuna Sashimi salad that multiple people on Yelp are raving about. My boyfriend was planning on ordering the Pork Belly Bibimbap. We go to order and it turns out they are out of BOTH. I understand, restaurants run out of things and that's fine. But why couldn't they alert us before we sat down? Anyways, I ended up ordering the Grilled Chicken Bibimbap with brown rice and my boyfriend ordered the Bulgogi. They offered him lettuce to make lettuce cups and he decided \"why not\".\n\nThey brought us out our banchan and 1. there were only 3 items and 2. they all tasted like cleaning fluid. It was awful and we should have run away then. We, however, are too much of wusses to do that so we decided to tough it out. About 20 minutes later, our food arrived. And let me tell you-the food was TERRIBLE. My chicken bibimbap was bland and had frozen corn in it. The other vegetables were lame. They also gave me brown rice instead of white which is super duper annoying. I didn't have time to send it back so I dealt with it but only ate about 1/2. My boyfriend's bulgogi was super bland and tough. The meat quality was not there and they didn't bring him the lettuce cups which maybe would have made it more terrible.\n\nThe worst part? This meal was expensive. My entree was $17 and my boyfriend's entree was $20. This is a solid $5 more expensive than all of the fabulous places in Japantown or the Tenderloin which we have tried. Stone wasn't particularly nice, the service wasn't great and the ingredients were low quality. Overall, we were EXTREMELY disappointed.

I ordered the kimchee fried rice with pork belly, while my friends ordered the bi bim bap (spicy). I'm not much of a spicy eater so I asked for less spicy.

I do want to say its on the pricier side since it is in the financial district and its lunch time.

Happy hour is currently from 5-7 pm every weekday, and I was pleased to find that it wasn't super crowded as I was able to reserve a table for friends around 6 pm on a Friday night.\n\nWhether you prefer indoor or outdoor seating, the restaurant boasts a nice view of the clock tower and nearby pier, allowing for overstuffed happy-hour-goers to take a walk and help digest. I've tried most of their happy hour items and I would recommend the bulgogi fries, fried calamari, seafood pa jun, glazed pork spare ribs, and the spicy & citrus wings over the sweet & spicy wings (get both though). All of the soju flavors are tasty, but I think the lychee is the best! All of the mentioned food items and soju pitchers (normally $22) are half off! All of their beer is half off as well! I have ordered enough to fill up a group of 5 friends with hearty, fried foods and intoxicating dranks, which totaled up to a bill of $160, but ended up being just $80 after happy hour pricing.\n\nIf you and your friends are looking for a whole night out in San Francisco, Stone Korean Kitchen is definitely a good starting point for eating good fried foods and pre-gaming with pitchers of soju!", "author": "Ian C."}

So I recommend you get whatever level of spicy you usually get. \n\nThe soondubu, unfortunately was watery. The tofu is served in a gigantic lump at the bottom of the bowl. And the seafood that the soondubu comes with includes clams with the shell on. I don't know if this is typical since I normally don't get seafood soondubu but you have to scoop the clams out of the bowl so that you can open the shell.\n\nAll in all, the meal cost $20 (after tips and taxes) for a mediocre soondubu and was very disappointing.", "author": "Rica Z."}

You have a paying customer asking about an order, it also sounded like she was trying to place the blame on Caviar and when she put me on hold the 2nd time so I could find my order number the call dropped. So first impressions with their service, definitely not going well. \n\nI called back and got a different person, this time a man. He basically gave me the same answer and also mirrored what the first lady was saying about if Caviar missed it then basically what they could do was refund me. At this point it didn't even feel like it was about the missing rice anymore, it seemed like they weren't even trying to help me and/or give me options to help solve my problem. I didn't seem to get anywhere until I asked (in a somewhat frustrated tone) if he could contact the delivery driver and ask if maybe it was left in his car, which I also highly doubted because usually when you order delivery everything is in one bag, plus wouldn't whoever packed my order know to include rice with the entree?\n\nWe eventually got this solved with them telling me Caviar would be coming back to deliver the missing item (still waiting to hear from Caviar). But this was after all of the above had to transpire in order for us to get anywhere. \n\nI'm sure the food is delicious but for all that effort to get some missing rice delivered to me and for the the quality of the service assisting me with this issue does not leave an overall good experience, especially for the price of the food.", "author": "Shelley W."}

I don't eat meat anymore so most of what I consumed was either seafood or non-animal based, but it was super yummy.  \n\nI was with out it town guests from Germany that had never tried Korean food so I thought that the Stone Korean Kitchen would be a good start.  Me and my husband on the other hand had (before I stopped eating meat) been frequent AYCE Korean BBQ eaters so I believe I'm a connoisseur of the meats and a wide variety of banchan. \n\nWe ordered tons of food and drinks.  See below.\n\nThe drinks\n1. Pitcher of ice cold beer\n2. Pellegrino\n3. Coke\n4. Soju cocktail (I had this.  It was deliciously sweet, if I had more than one I probably would have gotten drunk).  \n5. Hot tea (I always get hot tea with my Asian food).\n\nThe food\n1. Crispy green beans (So good! Tempura fried and crispy.  Just the right amount of batter so that you could still taste the green beans. They were also had the crispy crunch that comes from being fresh). \n2. Cheesy corn (I loved the crispy edges that formed in the pan this dish was served on.  I found myself talking too much and enjoying the other foods that the corn got cold.  It was still good so I kept eating it even though I was plenty full by then.)\n3. Crispy tofu (Fried well and there was not any greasy flavor or feel.  I dipped it in the spicy mayo that was supplied with our calamari and that made it fun. There was a lot of tofu so be sure to share.)\n4. Calamari (fried just the way I like it and with light seasoning.  It came with spicy mayo and perhaps a spicy pepper sauce.  I'm actually not sure if the red pepper sauce belonged with it as there were so many dishes that maybe it was for the green beans or something. Doesn't matter, it was good with and without the sauces.) \n5. Seafood cakes (I didn't even notice it on the menu so I was glad someone ordered it. They were very flavorful and definitely something I would suggest a pescatarian to try. Not too fishy tasting either.  They reminded me a little of the crispy salmon croquettes my mother made growing up.)\n6. Stone wings (3 orders) the traditional and the spicy version. (I didn't taste these because I don't eat chicken anymore but from the looks of them I'd say they were meaty and fried up just right.  The German teenager that ordered them said they were delicious but not too hot. She likes her food really spicy. Her brother thought they were too spicy.) \n7. Bulgogi (Came with a serving of rice. Bulgogi was always my favorite food when I had KBBQ so I had to taste a piece.  It was great!  The meat was tender, not tough and full of tendons.  Getting served too many poor grades of meat is one reason why I stopped eating meat.  I like that the sauce it was marinated in wasn't too sweet, it was just right.)\n\nThe Banchan we were served were great accompaniments too.  The pickled cucumbers were slightly sweet.  The kimchi was spicy and not too sour.  The bean sprouts were my favorite.  They were salty and had a nutty flavor. I would eat the sprouts again as a side dish. \n\nI'll have to explore the menu more next time.  I was trying to get items that my German friends could enjoy that were within their comfort zone.  They loved it all, but I want to try some things that I haven't had when I visited the AYCE restaurant.  I'll try the glass noodles since they say I can replace the meat with tofu.  I'm already craving more green beans already so that's for sure on my list for more.  Maybe I'll start eating meat again by the time I'm back in San Francisco so who knows what will end up on my plate.  \n\nI've got to give props to Brian, our server, for putting up with our large table.  We did a lot of catching up with each other,  we asked lots of questions and didn't finish eating until the restaurant had closed.  I appreciate the patience of the entire staff and their positive attitudes.", "author": "Crystal M."}

They offer brown rice for those who want to be a little healthier. The Stone Rice Bowl comes with tons of fresh veggies as well as pickled ones and not a lot of rice so it's like a really good salad with surprises. The Stone Kalbi and Bulgogi come with rice and romaine lettuce leaves so you can wrap the meat and eat it that way as well. We even get ban chan with the to go orders!

Similarly, it's to be expected that prices are going to be a bit higher as well.  However, none of that should detract from the fact that the food both looks and tastes pretty darn good!  Service, on the other hand, is a different story...\n\nGiven their name and specialty, I had decided on trying the Dolsot Bibimbap even before we sat down.  While most of the menu options sounded really appealing, none of it was enough to sway me from my plan.  That is, until I saw that they served their kimchee fried rice in the same type of stone pot.

The touch of sweet and spicy contrasted quite nicely and the meat was tender and juicy.  Plus, the batter was so crispy!  Definitely recommended.\n\n-- KIM CHEE FRIED RICE - Served in a 500\u00b0 stone bowl with Housemade Kim Chee, Spicy Pork Sausage, Scallions, and a Fried Organic Egg...$15\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stone-korean-kitchen-san-francisco-2?select=PXWLRRbjujdLaPUxxT44nQ#XA28JWz3shI6L0UuZwVQHw)\nThey may be known for their bibimbaps, but this was pretty damn good.  Yes, it's a bit pricey for kimchee fried rice, but it's also a tasty kimchee fried rice.  There was a good amount of sausage and I really liked the kimchee - pungent but not too sour.\n\nDespite how much I may have liked the food though, I'm giving just three stars due to the service.  I wouldn't always take off a full star for an inattentive server, but not this time.  Not when our waitress ignored the five of us so many times, forgot our drinks, and was nowhere to be found until it came time to collect our money (one of my friends had to get up to ask for our check).\n\nThat being said, I'd still gladly come back to Stone Korean Kitchen again.

I stumbled upon this place and decided to eat here because of my Asian appetite. After checking Yelp, I also noticed a really cool 15% off your dinner bill coupon, so that was a definitely incentive to try it out! \n\nWhen you walk in you past the take out station, the bar tops and then hit the dining room. For my meal, I decided to eat at the bar top. Only a 6 top max, I was able to enjoy my dinner by myself. My bartender/server was definitely not the nicest to work with. She didn't even greet me. She literally just stared at me and replied to me once I initiated the hello. Throughout my meal, she wasn't very attentive and also ended up eating her food right next to me at the bar. Definitely an informal place, for sure. Closer to the end of my evening, a couple of the cooks, the take out girl and my bartender thought it was alright to pop open a bottle of wine and pour some IPA brew to end their evening! I was a little turned off by the informal and unprofessional manner. Eating next to your guest is one thing, drinking on the job and with other guests in the restaurant is a whole different thing. \n\nFor my dinner, I was going to get the dol sot bi bim bap, however, I decided to get the spam fried rice and ribs for $15, coming to around $13 and some change, with the coupon. Korean style fried rice with veggies and spam, topped with a sunny side up egg and kalbi. The Kalbi was awesome! Marinated very well and perfectly grilled. The only problem was that you only got three bones! LOL The fried rice was a little too oily for my taste. I liked the soy sauce flavor, appreciated the texture from the chopped carrots, however the spam could have been fried a little more and the rice again, was really oily. The sunny side egg brought a creamy flavor which helped to break up the oil. \n\nAt the end of the day, I probably would go back. I love Asian flavors and super curious to see what the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap would taste like.

Their website said that they open at 11 and we got there a little after 11. The door was open and we walked in. \n\nTwo girls were inside and they were cleaning.  The floor and some tables were dirty and we both noticed it. We said to each other that the place must be recovering from the busy weekend. We asked for a table to dine in and one of the girls said that they don't open until 11:15 for dine-in. It was 11:10. We asked if we can just sit down and would wait until they are ready mainly because my boyfriend can't stand up too long. \n \nThe girls looked at each other and reluctantly took us a table for two. My boyfriend is disabled and I needed a table that we could sit side-by-side to assist him to eat and I explained it to the girl who showed us a table. \n\nI asked if we could get the four-top so we could sit adjacent. Because the  whole restaurant was empty and it's not prime lunch time yet, we didn't think it was too much to ask. She said she would have to check if there was a reservation. \n\nI explained that we would not be able to eat without sitting adjacent and she said \"Fine!\" and walked away. We realized that she really didn't need to check the reservation and just didn't want to give us a 4-top. I wish I had a video to show her face and how she said it. \n\nBy now, we totally lost our appetite and desire to stay there. We have been traveling everywhere in the States and the world. But it was the rudest experience we ever had in a restaurant. \n\nI am originally from South Korea and my boyfriend is a typical American guy with some disability.  We are accommodating as we have traveled quite a bit and encountered all kinds of situation, but the rudeness of the hostess of this place was not acceptable. We looked at each other and agreed that we didn't want to stay. \n\nWe walked out and walked into a Chinese restaurant nearby.  A lot of tables had reserved signs but the receptionist took us to a four-top table (we asked for one for the same reason) by the window that was reserved for 2 PM as we would be done way before. We had a good lunch there with courteous servers and authentic Chinese food. \n\nI would give zero to Stone Korean Kitchen and it would be my first restaurant review with nothing good to say about, unfortunately.

A friend had groupon discount or coupon, but the Happy Hour menu prices and items do not apply to that particular promotion.\nThe space is a bit odd shaped as the greeting area is like a takeout counter that faces the kitchen.  The kind host led us to a wall table in the main dining room as they also have an outdoor patio area with tables.  The restaurant was about 1/3rd full when we arrived a bit after 6 pm and it looked like most were munching on the Happy Hour specials.  The host explained the menu to us and took our drink orders before giving us some time to strategize.  When our water and drinks arrived, the server also brought us a few banchans, kim chee, pickled cucumber, seaweed, and bean sprouts.

But I'd do it again any day!!\n\nMe, my co-worker and client came here to eat on a rainy cold day.  We were all bundled up in sweaters, coats, scarfs and thick socks.  As we entered in, a cold host looks up our reservations and tells us to follow her.   Her chilled attitude didn't make us feel any cooler, in fact, we were heating up even more!  Not because of her lack of personality but because the place was blasting the heater up.  Man, we were hot!  We peeled off our coats immediately to try to feel normal temperature again but it took a while to cool down.  But even at that, the food we ate brought our body temperatures back up!\n\nService is really lame, first with the hostess, then with our lack of a waitress. We waited for our waitress to come and she never did.  So, I had to flag any living breathing employee to take our orders.  When we pointed to the picture with the tasty looking sizzling corn mayonnaise cheese platter, the waitress explained that it was a dish not to be served at happy hour, nor lunch time but is only available at dinner time.  Man!  She sure was long winded and what a let down!!!!!  We were all so disappointed.  Throughout our stay, not once did they check up on us and we ended up flagging someone down for our bill.  Lame!\n\nFirst off, they provided 2 complimentary banchan dishes, which is CHEAP, because all other Korean Restaurants would provide 10-15 banchan dishes.  They only served pickled cucumbers and kim chee, both were house made and was in need of some fancy sea salt and more heat.  I normally scarf down kim chee and request for more but this one, I barely touched. If they are going to serve 2 measly banchan, they should knock our thick socks off, right?! Well, that didn't happen.  They need to take notes from watching, \"Le Grand Chef - Kimchi Wars\".  Anyone that watches that movie would expect better from their Kimchee, no joke!\n\nAside from lame service and banchan dishes, the other dishes we ate were delicious!  Here's what we ordered...\n\n! Fresh made dumplings - there were 7 of them with a tasty dipping sauce.  I must admit, these dumplings were extraordinarily tasty and fresh.  5 STARS\n\n! Krazy Korean Bowl - this was their version of a Hawaiian loco moco.  At $15 bucks, it better be damn good.  Well, at $15 bucks, it was extremely good!  The stone bowl came out with gravy oozing all over the top, in which it was bubbling hot out of the cauldron.  Rice was on the bottom, Angus beef patty in the middle, fried red onions and topped with 2 sunny side up eggs.  I popped those eggs and mixed it into the bubbling gravy to cook it up a bit.  Each and every bite was burn your tongue good and hot!  And surprisingly, the rice on the edge of the stone bowl became crunchy, which is soooo good to eat.  Missing a bite of that is a no no.  My client was quick to point out pieces that I missed...gee thanks.  Must eat the entire bowl!  5 STARS\n\n! Bibimbap Bowl - my co-worker ordered this one and she said it's okay.  She wished there were more pickled veggies in it and more traditional.  Since I didn't taste it, I can't rate it but the presentation was nice to look at.\n\nWatch out for those stone bowls, they are heated up to 500 degrees and can burn a dragon tattoo on your arm if you feel the need to hug your Krazy Korean.  Or worst yet, scream like a little girl if you accidentally touch it.  So, just be cognoscente of the hot hot hot stone bowl!  \n\nHOT seem to be the theme of our visit here!  I came into the restaurant feeling hot, I was sweating over my bowl of food, I burnt my tongue from eating the hot food and lastly, the price of the food may leave you feeling hot that it cost so much.  It is pretty pricy and should be close to $10 a bowl instead.  But I thought it was good, as I've never tasted such a yummy loco moco before.

Probably doesn't forebode well but it is what it is - a so-so Korean dining experience that is slightly overpriced to pay the rent for the place with views of the Ferry Building. \n\nOne saving grace is the stone wings but then again, it is fried chicken after all. If you're a fan of Korean fried chicken, this is a nice take on it with the sweet, savory, and barely spicy glaze. The chicken was still crispy despite the liberal amount of sauce on it. \n\nThe hwae dup bap is decent, but at $20 for lunch, is a little steep. The tuna sashimi is fresh though and the variety of vegetables provide a refreshing contrast in both taste and texture to the dish. The steamed dumplings are decent but the dough is a little too thick but the filling, when combined with the dipping sauce, is decent. The seafood pancakes are forgettable. Honestly you might not even realize there is seafood in them \n\nLunch prices aren't significantly less than dinner so come for the latter since the menu is much larger then. They do have happy hour specials from 5-7pm. Order a veggie platter (crispy green beans, crispy tofu, & jap chae) and enjoy a couple of pre-movie drink specials like we did once before heading to the theatre upstairs. Otherwise, the place is honestly overpriced for what you get. Service is either respectfully Korean or borderline apathetic but sufficient.

But, when you can get 50% your entire check (all the appetizers except the korean fried chicken), that makes this place super affordable for a place in SF. My friend and I ordered basically 5 appetizers and we ended up paying $24 before tip and we were very full that we couldn't even finish.\n\nThe five appetizers we got were the Stone Wings (Original - Sweet and Spicy), Dukboki, Jap Chae, Bulgogi Fries and Fried Tofu. If I were to order again I'd only choose the Stone Wings and the Dukboki to get again because those were really good and worth every penny. The Fries sounded better than they tasted (basically steak fries with bulgogi on top and minimal sauce), the Jap Chae had way too much vegetables instead of noodles, and the Fried Tofu was very tough... it was like chewing a rubbery substance. Couldn't even finish the tofu.\n\nIf I were you, I'd just get a bunch of Stone Wings (different flavors) and get an order of Dukboki. I can't give you any advice on the full entrees but why would you get those when most of the appetizers are 50% off.", "author": "Andrew C."}

Because it was TOO HOT after 5 minutes under the sun, we decided to change our table to a shady table and order our food. \n\nI decided to get a soft tofu stew in spicy. They didn't have a variety of choices for the different kinds of soft tofu stew (seafood, beef, chicken, vegetable, etc), just a description that said \"silken tofu stew with pork belly, shrimp, manila clams, squid, zucchini, onions, and egg.\" When the soft tofu stew came, I was shocked that it was going to cost me $15 plus tax/tip for such a small bowl of soup. Overall, the ingredients were plenty and the food was piping hot and delicious so no complaints there...\n\nThey did get us 3 banchans ahead of time, but we had to wait 15 minutes to get a server's attention to get some water. We also waited a total of 30 MINUTES+ for our food because either the server or the chef messed up and didn't put in our order/didn't make our order.....Very disappointed in the service for that day. :( Maybe it was just because they had a lot of customers that day?...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-09", "description": "I just had to write a review for Stone Kitchen because I can't stop thinking about their goddamn wings. Man, those Stone wings were probably one of the best Korean wings I've ever had. Me and my girlfriend ordered the original flavor and it had the perfect mix of honey sweet and umami flavors (with a spicy kick too). Crunch level is off the charts - that first bite is one of the most satisfying pleasures of life. I swear, I've been dreaming about those wings every now and then ever since I've visited. I would give the wings five stars. The only downside is that I feel they are too overpriced for an appetizer. The perfect recipe for a happy soul, but a sad wallet... \n\nWe also ordered the Bulgogi fries and the Stone Kalbi. The Bulgogi fries were fresh and large, not the crispy kind. The fries were delicious, but the spicy sauce wasn't anything special. Later during the meal, I found myself dipping my fries into the Stone wings sauce instead. I tried a little bit of the Stone Kalbi, which was tender and delicious, but much like most Kalbi I've tasted. You would expect a lot more if you were paying $19 for the meal. \n\nHeard they had happy hour, so maybe that would have been a better time to visit.\n\nI absolutely love fusion restaurants for their creativity and uniqueness, but my only problem with them is that most fusion restaurants I go to charge a premium for being \"innovative and modern.\" In the case of Stone Kitchen, the restaurant definitely has a very modern look and feel to it, which truly gives you the feel of a Western Korean fusion. That's remarkable, but on the downside, most of their menu items are just to pricey for what its worth. I found myself not enjoying the food as much because I was thinking about the bill the whole time..", "author": "Mari U."}

Overall, there's some room for improvement.\n\nThe pick-up itself was difficult as available parking nearby is scarce.  I was thinking about leaving my car on the cobblestone driveway and running in, but the combination of \"No Stopping at Any Time\" signs and a yellow tow truck hanging around the aforementioned sign compelled me to chicken out.  I then circled the block for a while until I could find an available metered space.\n\nNext, there was some confusion over the order when inquired about it in the restaurant.  I gave the name of our order, and they told me that an item was still being prepared despite the order being placed 30 to 45 minutes prior.  A few minutes later, after serving a few other customers, a manager asked me again about the name on the order, and they discovered that the order had been sitting behind the cash register all along.  This wasn't a big deal, but the execution just isn't as smooth as it should be.\n\nI ordered the Tuna Sashimi Rice Salad, and my wife ordered a Rice Bowl with Tofu.  The salad felt as though they were aiming for quantity over quality.  The portion size was large - so much so that I could not finish it in one sitting.  However, I was displeased with the taste.  Moreover, the dish cost $22.00, which was pretty steep in my view.  I suppose the rent expense at prime real estate such as the Embarcadero Center needs to be financed somehow.  \n\nMy wife didn't enjoy her Rice Bowl either and tapped out early as a result.", "author": "Sebastian N."}

I only get certain items from the menu, so I cannot comment on their overall menus. But I noticed that their menus are not \"authentically\" Korean (fries and cheese?). With that said, Kimchi stew, Kalbi and Bibimbab are close to authentic and are really good. And there is nothing wrong with fusion foods that incorporates various cuisines that please the crowd. \n\nI took 1 star off for less than good service and low quality side dishes. It feels like the wait staffs do not really have any past experience waiting tables. You don't get the typical water refills, frequent check-ins, etc. They just get your order, bring you food and get you the check. But this is not a major problem for me. \nThe sides dishes - This is really important as sides dishes are what make Korean dining unique. But their sides dishes are minimal and lifeless. What's more disappointing is that most sides that come out are the same ingredients that go into Bibimbab. So if you get a Bibimbab, you don't really need your side dishes. This is a shortcut way of serving Korean food.\n\nOverall, I have and will continue to fix my Korean food cravings at Stone Korean Kitchen for the tastiness of their foods, but I do see that they have areas of improvement, especially in service and side dish selections.", "author": "Jane M."}

They have a pretty big patio space, and it was a rare warm day in SF, but we sat inside, where the AC made the stone bowls a lot more comfortable to eat. \n\nThe menu has lots of fusion dishes like bulgolgi fries. I stuck with a dol sot bibimbap (stone bowl rice).  The rice never got a good crisp bottom, but there was a decent amount of vegetables on top (corn, carrots, zucchini, spinach, bean sprouts). The egg was nicely fried, and the bulgolgi (they called it short rib) on top was a generous amount. Flavor wise, the bulgolgi was probably too sweet, and I think the gochujang was toned down (not spicy, sweeter). \n\nAs for the side dishes, they only had 3 types: kimchee (standard, tasted like it was from a jar), cucumbers (under seasoned), and the tiny fish (not my thing, didn't try it), and they didn't offer to refill them, so we didn't ask (they also weren't great anyway). I thought it was odd to have the tiny fish at a more Americanized place, since most people don't love eating the fish (it actually went untouched at our table).\n\nI don't think any of the servers were Korean, and ours didn't seem to know the menu very well.

Pretty popular with the working crowd\n\nAmbience : Small but cozy. However if you are looking for a private place to sit and talk,might not be the best as it can get a little noisy and crowded.\n\nFood : We ordered the bibimbap with sweet and spicy chicken along with curry rice with pork belly. Both items were good quantity and tasted very fresh and well. Lots of meat and vegetables. Quite a hearty meal.\nWe also tried the kiwi soju cocktail which was delicious and a must try. \n\nService : Service was quite quick when you see the number of people at the place . \nNot a very intimate place but a great one to satisfy your quick Korean cravings after work.

Most of the barbeque houses offer a good 8-10 dishes of this wonderful accompaniment.  My hubby is Korean and we've traveled to Seoul quite a few times so my mouth knows good banchan at first taste.  The best way to judge Korean food is to first judge their banchan, especially the kimchi.  \n\nJacked up kimchi = Jacked up Korean food, get it? \n\nWhile this place doesn't always offer the worst kimchi, I can say that their kimchi is not always consistent.  Some days, I devour the kimchi before my meal arrives and beg for more.  Other days, I just want to push the kimchi to the far side of the table.  In addition to the kimchi, they usually offer two more side dishes ranging from beansprouts, spinach, cucumber, and radish.  On very strange days, they offer beets.  That's right... beets with some weird seasoning.  Sure..that's very Korean?!  \n\nThere's only two things that I order here although I've tried other items on their menu which are not worth mentioning.  The soon doobu (tofu stew) and the stone bibimbap (stone pot rice w/ a choice of meat, poultry, tofu & veggies).   The tofu stew actually tastes pretty good especially since they didn't skimp on the quality silken tofu.  In addition to tofu, they add pork belly, shrimp, clams, and squid.  It doesn't come out boiling vigorously so why they still give a raw egg with it is a bit puzzling.  They definitely are on the expensive side of Korean food.  The soon doobu is $14 and I think the bibimbap is around $15.  \n\nOverall, these are the only two dishes that are worth getting here.  Unfortunately, the rest of the menu along with their side dishes aren't really worth your time.  In addition, they have really crappy service with a side a attitude.  It's a shame that this is the only Korean dine in spot in all of FIDI.  It's also a shame that I'm in love with Korean food.  Otherwise, I would never, ever come back here.", "author": "Wina K."}

Jamie W. and I came here on a whim after watching the skaters and the non-skaters on the holiday rink. S.J. Sharkie, the official mascot of the Sharks, was there devouring the heads of young children for photo ops. This place is a bit hidden away from the plaza which makes it really easy to forget it's even there.\n\nThe menu is Westernized Korean fare obviously not approved by Kim Jong-il before he kicked the bucket. Dishes like O.B. Beer-Battered Fish n' Chips and Bulgogi Fries would have only made it to the Supreme Leader's palace, not in the rice paddies. We were swayed by our hip waitress to try one of their $2.50 tacos since we were there on Taco Tuesday. It was a nice little production with Bulgogi piled on top of a flour tortilla and accompanied by three toppings (see photo). Probably should have ordered more of those since Jamie W. and I both went for the $15 Korean Curry Rice, which suffered from an odd presentation.\n\nIt came in a deep bowl with the rice popping up in the middle like an island with whatever meat you ordered swimming like sharks in the curry sauce. It was alright though too heavy on the sauce to enjoy fully. Jamie went for the more predictable Chicken Cutlet (see photo), but I had to try the Pork Belly in great anticipation of what they would do with my favorite animal part. My hopes were dashed when it tasted just like the chicken (see photo). Hmmm, wonder if they made a mistake. Anyway, we were distracted by the loud youngster sitting at the next table obviously bummed his date didn't show up. He gorged on a bunch of tacos and let out an echo-inducing belch for all to hear. Ah youth.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...new age Korean could have used grandma to whip it into more flavorful shape, but the un-Korean-like taco has possibilities\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...just feels like another Embarcadero Center eatery to me\nSERVICE - 3 stars...the zeal of youth\nTOTAL - 3 stars...to be 22 again...no thanks!", "author": "Ed U."}

I asked him what had happened and he said it was nothing. Obviously it was something and this was gross. I will never come back to Stone again and will make sure to tell my friends and family to do the same.

You cannot beat their happy hour prices and it's a great change of pace to our usual happy hour haunts in the financial district.  \nWe chose 4 bar bites to share between the two of us.  Steamed Dumplings, Bulgogi Fries, Angry Tuna and Spam Gin Bap (Yes, I said SPAM and I can tell you it was delicious!).  Looking back, we could have ordered less food as we weren't able to finish everything but it was so fun to sample new flavors combinations.  The Banchan items were brought to the table as soon as we arrived.  I was a little apprehensive at first because I don't have a lot of experience with Korean food and I thought everything would be fire hot.  Instead, I was pleasantly surpised and appreciated how they tasted individually as well as how they freshened a bite when combined with our appetizers.  Out of all of our choices, I don't know if I would order the Bulgogi Fries again...not because they aren't good....but really, they are just french fries with hot aioli and beef.  Yes, delicious,  but the novelty has worn off.  I would say to anyone, you have to try them once though!\nThe restaurant was very clean and the gentleman that served us was great!

Contrary to what one of my co-workers thought, the \"on-site\" does not specify where the food will be, but rather that employees from Stone Korean Kitchen will actually be on-site.  I thought our weekly advance notice from the office manager was sufficient, but I guess some people need more clarification.\n\nSo out came two employees to set up and prepare our food.  It was nice having someone else put rice, meat, and veggies into a bowl for me as I find this too labor intensive to do myself.  I asked for everything on the table to be put into my bowl (except the tofu) and it was marvelous!  Cucumber, carrot, brown rice, red cabbage (I think), lettuce, chicken, beef.  Then I take my bowl that was prepared specifically for me and have the option to add various pickled items and sauces.  There were three to choose from: a red spicy one, a brown soy/garlic one, and a mayonnaise consistency one.  I piled on the brown stuff and added a few dabs of the spicy mayonnaise stuff.\n\nI was schooled on how to stir this (I honestly had no idea how I was supposed to mix it all) and then was ready to dive in.

Both were EXCELLENT.  The seafood pancake is crispy on the outside, soft and mushy on the inside, and the dipping sauce is GOOD.  Get it!\n\nMy kimchee fried rice was HELLA GOOD, and the portions were ginormous.  Probably enough to cover three meals.  It actually wasn't spicy at all, which was good for me, because I fear the spice.  It was exceptionally greasy, but that's also what made it taste so damn good.  You mix up the fried egg, the kimchee, \"spicy\" sausage, and all that bright red rice, and you hear the sizzling of all that awesomeness, and it's just an amazing combination.  I was getting extremely full after eating less than half of my dish, but I powered through to try to eat more because it was just SO GOOD.  Highly recommended.\n\nThis place is slightly expensive, and I'm thinking it's partly because of its location.  Each dish is a couple more dollars than what I'm normally willing to pay, but as far as the kimchee dish, I think it's priced alright because, for $11.50, you seriously get enough food for three decent meals.  And it's really good too.  \n\nMinus one star because they don't give you a lot of banchan, and what they do give you isn't very good.  We got three small plates of mung beans, kimchee, and some spicy cucumbers.  All were kind of meh, and it was such a measly portion compared to other places that serve you tons of banchan including a whole fish!  \n\nOtherwise, overall good food, slightly more expensive, great views.

It wouldn't be a spot for me to pick to eat korean food and get soju.  I would not bring a date here to impress her.  It wouldn't even be a lunch spot.  However, I find myself here quite often for happy hour.  \n\nAnd this is when you should go.  The BOGO drinks (beer/wine) are an exceptional deal, and the special of the day is usually pretty good for HH prices.  Today it was bulgogi fries.  Excellent use fo bulgogi and house cut fries.  They also had a Taco Tuesday special.  Good Kalbi Tacos...although at $3 a pop, it doesn't seem too much like a special.  The combination of drinks and food always makes for a good happy hour.\n\nOne big issue for me is that their Infused Soju mixers just aren't that good.  Almost all the places I go to drink blended sojus have their own take and all are pretty good (i.e. VIP, Porno Palace, and Toyose).

Located in a very convenient place, I came here for lunch with a co-worker after looking through their photos and menu. It's jammed pack on weekdays, but if you make a reservation online - it should be fine. We made one an hour before we got there, and didn't have to wait. \n\nWe went in at around 1PM, and ordered the bulgogi lettuce wraps and bi bimbap - both of which I highly recommend! Their service great and the food came really fast - within 10 minutes, which was amazing considering how hungry we were.  The bi bim bap did not disappoint, but what really struck me and makes me want to go back for more was the lettuce wraps. Stone Korean Kitchen makes its fusion food work with these kind of unique dishes. The bulgogi was great - extremely rich and flavorful. They gave us 3 different types of sauce to mix it with: so we can adjust it to how we like. \n\nOverall, the experience was great. It's a little bit on the pricey end for a lunch, but I will definitely still recommend and will go back a lot more times!", "author": "Winnie L."}

For the most part, their Korean dishes are classic with a Western twist. We ordered bulgogi lettuce wraps to start off the appetizer, and it came with three different sauces. One was a classic sesame oil and the other two resembled what I would consider Korean salsas. I also tried their kimchi fried rice, which was one of the best I've ever had. I'm not sure how they do it, but I'm guessing that they infuse the rice with the kimchi for extended periods of time, which is how it gets its rich flavor.

And I am upset after reading the review posted by Bruce M. \n\nWhile I respect your opinions about the food and don't doubt your personal experience wasn't what you'd hoped, I can't help but feel offended by the comments that were made about the cooking staff at Stone Korean Kitchen. I eat at Stone regularly and have asked about the recipes they use and was told that they all came from the restaurant owner's own mother's cookbook - aka all the recipes are traditional Korean recipes. Which brings me to question: are you really upset that you aren't getting an \"authentic experience\" or are you just being racist? I don't know what the restaurant scene is like where you are from, but in San Francisco you will be hard pressed to find any establishment where you won't find Latino workers who have been trained to prepare whatever dishes are necessary for whatever type of food they are required to make. \n\nFor instance, I have actually had a Latino man make my food at Benihanna's once and it was no less delicious than the food I would have had made by a  Japanese man who, for all I know, may have been raised in Kansas and had no idea how to prepare traditional Japanese food before working there. What makes going out to eat an awesome experience isn't simply experiencing a single culture at a time, it's knowing that all types of cultures can come together to share culture at a time, it's knowing that all types of cultures can come together to share their cuisine and flavors, whether it be through fusion or the strictest adherence of traditional techniques. \n\nOh! And that \"attractive and friendly\" Korean hostess you had? She's Filipino. So much for recognizing authenticity.", "author": "Alice Z."}

Eat and critique. \n\nStone Korean Kitchen definitely has lots of kinks to work out. Serving lukewarm kalbi and giving only a portion of rice? Those are No-Nos. But the biggest thing that needs much improvement is the food itself.\n\nBanchan (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z5Oa8wKjGPPc2XWzV4ShVA?select=RnqK7v7OdiOKn9LFBKANQQ): Unappealing. The soy beans were hard. The broccoli was raw. The kimchi was not very good.\n\nStone Wings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z5Oa8wKjGPPc2XWzV4ShVA?select=xenVfiskzRUTfmMyrlSFeA): These were really good. Not sure if its Korean. It had a great crunch and nice flavors.\n\nDuk Buk Ki (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z5Oa8wKjGPPc2XWzV4ShVA?select=8r6tI0txOw_eiu_mGaa2TQ): The rice cakes were inedible. Hard and chalky. I think they forgot to presoak the rice cakes.\n\nHwae Dup Bap (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z5Oa8wKjGPPc2XWzV4ShVA?select=oebdonpTYtlir_MsJiewrg): Needed more fish and less vegetable. The cooked zucchini, mushroom, beets, bell peppers did not belong in this dish. The dish also lacked sesame oil and green onions.\n\nStone Kalbi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z5Oa8wKjGPPc2XWzV4ShVA?select=0MbiWzyhRnyEiqm75hQyBg): Liked how they served rice paper and lettuce with the meat. The lettuce should be shredded. The kalbi was thin and overcooked. Pretty sure the meat just sat, since it was not sizzling when brought out.\n\nDol Sot Bi Bim Bap (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z5Oa8wKjGPPc2XWzV4ShVA?select=7P2fpPgDUh1HMfNjf0Q3VA): A lot of ingredients. But many unfamiliar ones in a bi bim bap. Cooked eggplants, mushrooms and beets? Did not go well. The rice was overly crunchy and slightly burnt. \n\nOverall, the food was decent but felt untraditional. For me, the biggest enjoyment of Korean food is the sense of comfort. It was lacking in these dishes. The restaurant was trying to appeal to the FiDi/Embarcadero crowd by using fresh organic produce that absolutely do not belong. Because of these foreign ingredients, the taste is just not there.\n\nSecondly, prices here are ridiculously high. Take out the poshy stuff, bump the prices down. There are many cheaper food options close by so the price alone may stop ppl from coming. Also as the soon-to-be only Korean restaurant around, it can certainly do well by focusing on traditional flavors and ingredients. \n\nUnder normal circumstances, this is not a place I will return. I gave 3 stars because of the whole experience. I applaud their asking for critiques, since it showed they know there are issues to be worked on. Best of all, one of the owners was very receptive in our opinion. He gave us his full attention and took in what we had to say beyond words on a survey form.  It's a place with great staff and great potential. I wish them the best of luck. I do look forward to a revisit just to see the changes and improvements they make.", "author": "Marti L."}

Seafood pancakes?  Pasty and flavorless, save for the bit of shrimp or calamari here and there. Our bibimbaps tasted awful...mushy rice, bland spinach, julienned carrots, and the same cucumber slices they served in those 3 measly sample dishes they put before you (where other restaurants put out 8 or 9 little sample dishes).  The diced chicken was dry, and without much flavor at all.  Think Safeway chicken the next day, all chopped up. Can't they marinate the chicken like most Korean restaurants?

Bad service once can be co-incidence but 3 consecutive time just means they don't care about their returning customers. \n\nHorrible experience - when I told the staff that I am leaving coz I am sitting since last 15 minutes without even being served water to drink while I wait for someone to take my order. The guy said sorry without meaning it and did not take that customer was leaving.

Wife and I decided to try it for lunch last week (10/29/13) after getting off the Alcatraz boat across the street. What a dissapointing and poor choice for lunch. First off the place was empty aside from two tables outside on the patio, we opted for inside seating and had the entire dining room to ourselves.\n\nThe Korean hostess was attractive and friendly and sat us promptly along with taking our drink orders. A waiter showed up a few minutes later to take our food order so we chose a few appertizers and ordered our lunch at the same time, again, we are bulgogi and kalbi lovers.\n\nAppertizers came out promptly and were delicious. Unfortunately the same could not be said for our main lunch items. Kalbi was tough and lacked flavor, my guess it that it was never marinated for more than an hour or two. Bulgogi was piled high, enough for four people and it too lacked good flavor, they were probably trying to get rid of what they had left over from the lunch crowd (if there was one) so we got extra, to bad we did not want to eat even half of what was on the plate. These guys also lacked on side dishes, we got rice, kim chee and bean sprouts........really? Yup, the waiter said that was all they had in stock.........come on now, a real Korean joint has at least a half dozen or more pickled vegies on hand.\n\nAnother thing we noticed about this place is that it is not clean, meaning the chef line floor was dirty. We could see right into the serving line from where we were seated and noticed that the floor was filthy. I also noticed that most of the cooks were not Asian but Latino......Hmmm. It's like me going to Benihana's and having a French cook selling me on the Japanese BBQ house claim to fame table side cooking show. Come on now, would you expect a Korean guy making you taco's? I am not trying to be racist here since I am half Asian and half European, and  know my foods very well and also know that many different ethnic groups can cross cook.....I am one of them.

And it tastes all the better when you don't have to pay for it yourself :)\n\nTips:\n1) The rib eye bibimbap is by far my favorite in terms of the meat flavor and the quanity of meat meshed in with all the other veggies like corn, the purple stuff, lettuce, carrots, sprouts, cucumbers, and other stuff. \n2) The chicken bibimbap is cheaper (probably because chicken is cheaper), but for some reason it also feels like there is less meat, at least when I have gotten it. \n3) The ahi tuna (hwae dup bap) is also a solid choice for you seafood lovers -- it is seared FYI. \n4) Kim chee fried rice is standard and is always a good option.\n5) The rib eye short ribs are also good, although I was still hungry after eating them, since ribs always cost more (or you get less for the same price).\n6) Tofu soup is my style. I ordered medium and that thing came out dark red and I was quivering in fear, but then in reality it wasn't that hot. So no need to panic, since I already did that for you.\n7) Jap chae appetizer is the only one I've ever tried and it did not disappoint.", "author": "Eric S."}

Our dishes arrived within a reasonable amount of time and I dug in. The idea of food in a \"500 degree\" bowl was very exciting to me.  My dish tasted alright actually, nothing really tasty or memorable. My friend had the same opinion of her dish. She said she's had much better and I believe it because she loves Korean food and frequents their restaurants.\n\nOne quarter of my way through I felt something in my mouth that felt strange.  I took it out and there it was....a piece of plastic.  Sliced plastic about 3mm wide, 3 inches long as if it got sliced along with other vegetables.  Needless to say I lost my appetite. I let our waitress know and she did not look surprised or apologetic.  Her supervisor or manager was right by us so she told her and she in turn apologized and offered options of either a new bowl or getting it comped. Since I was short on time, I chose the comp option.

If you like bibimbap, stop reading, put away the Yelp, and go eat here - now.\n\nIn fact, the bibimbap is so good, I haven't manage to try any other main dishes on the menu! I wish they served with a raw egg (traditional in Korea), but the fried one is a close second. It comes in a super-hot stone bowl, guaranteed the meal will still be quite hot by the time you are done eating it.  Oh, and its delicious.\n\nAll the appetizers are great, pretty much can't go wrong.  \n\nIf I had a single complaint on the meal, I think it's a touch pricey all things considered.  But it's certainly in the acceptable range.\n\nBottom line: if you like Korean food and work downtown, this is an awesome lunch option.", "author": "Jeremy T."}

It was my first time dining at a Korean restaurant so I can't compare it to other places, but I'll judge what I can.  \n\nThe appetizers were ok, served at room temp, though they generously brought out 5-6 plates of complimentary appetizers for my party of 2!  Spinach with sesame, kim-chee, bean sprouts, pickled carrots...\n\nSince bi bim bap is the classic Korean dish, we ordered the bulgogi bi bim bap, which was enormous!  It could have easily fed two people with moderate appetites.  (Then again, it did cost $14.50 for essentially a rice dish.)  In terms of taste, A-OK, but nothing spectacular.  The bulgogi was fine, but my non-Korean mom can make it just as well.  In general, bi bim bap is kind of bland, so it definitely needed the hot sauce that accompanied the dish.\n\nWe also tried the soon du bu, which I liked better.   It was fun cracking a raw egg into the boiling stew in a clay pot - very interactive!  This dish was full of seafood flavor and I was surprised to discover that the silken tofu is not the silken tofu sold in grocery stores or used in miso soup, but it is an ingredient that I have had in Taiwan before in a sweet concoction!  It was great experiencing it in a flavorful, savory dish.  For $14.50, I would definitely order the soon du bu over the bi bim bap.", "author": "Beatrice W."}

Probably the best small plate they have.\n- Fried tofu: I'm a tofu mastah since I ate tofu while growing up almost everyday. I love their fried tofu. It's light and crispy. Perfect bite size.\n- Galbi: good flavor. Big portion. But I like it to have more burnt parts.\n\nOk:\n- Seabass: Tiny 2 pieces of fish. It tastes good, but the dish is waay too small. Thank god I love the sauteed onions which is 70% of the dish.\n- Bibimbap: Not a big fan of the ground beef, I prefer rib eye slices. The bean sprouts aren't cooked either. The gochujang is served in a small plate, I prefer the squeezy bottle since I love me some gochujang.\n\nBad:\n- Seafood pa jun: meh. Too much batter, kinda thick (you can see it in my picture).\n\nThe banchan is sometimes kinda old. Sometimes the soybeans are kinda limp although it still tastes good. I have no idea why some people say that the carrots and daikon have no taste. They are pickled and taste fine.\n\nAlso, they use the same sauce for the fried tofu, pa jun, and the seabass.

We came early enough at 11:45 to beat the lunch rush and the 6 of us were promptly seated. \n\nBanchan consisted of 3 items: bean sprouts, kimchi'ed pickles (spicy pickled pickles?), and kimchi. \n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers to share:\n1. Stone Wings (fried chicken wings tossed in special house sauce)\n2. Bulgogi fries (marinated rib-eye over English-style chips topped with fire aioli)\n\nThe chicken \"wings\" were OK - San Tung's is way better. It only had drumettes (i like the actual wing!),was too sweet and I would have preferred more spices (like garlic flavor). The bulgogi fries were excellent! I've never had it before, and it's basically steak fries topped with a spicy mayo and bulgogi! Yummm!\n\nI decided to try the Kimchi Fried Rice in Stone bowl. The best kimchi fried rice i've had are at hole in the wall places. Kimchi fried rice isn't supposed to be fancy, it doesn't need to come in a 500F stone bowl (it prevents me from devouring it quicker), and it certainly doesn't need to cost $10.50! But then again, you can't really find much cheaper in the FiDI (the kimchi fried rice at John's Snack and Deli is $9.80!)  They were out of the usual pork sausage that comes with the Kimchi fried rice, so i subbed bulgogi instead. I really wish i got to try the pork! Sad face. \n\nThis is Norcal, (not LA or Korea) and I don't expect the Korean food to wow me. For what it is, Stone Korean Kitchen is a nice, clean restaurant that's close to work. Since it was a free meal (paid for by my manager), I enjoyed it, but if i had to pay for it myself, $20 per person would be too much for what it was.

I had actually, oddly enough, just been talking about this place the day before and how I was interested in trying them. Boyfriend, who has been working out in SF for almost two years now, told me that while the food is decent, it wasn't worth the pricing. So I set out to try it for myself.\n\nI ordered the Krazy Korean (their take on the ever-popular loco moco), he ordered the Korean Curry Rice and his mom ordered the Stone Bulgogi (or was it the bibimbap? I don't remember, but it came in a stone bowl).\n\nSo. When you order your food items and they come in the stone bowl (like the Krazy Korean and Stone Bulgogi/Bibimbap did), it warns you that it comes in like a 500 degree bowl. Scary hot. But what they DON'T tell you is that if you don't eat fast enough (which is extremely difficult, given the high temperature of the food), then your rice ends up burning and sticking to the sides of the bowl. Also, that it becomes super crunchy, giving your food an odd consistency unless you ONLY eat out of the center -- at which point, you kinda waste a good portion of your food.\n\nI liked my Krazy Korean fine. The egg was good, and so was the beef, but my rice got super crunchy because it cooked to the side of the bowl! I should've ordered the curry rice. It doesn't come in a super-hot stone bowl, and the flavors were full without being overbearingly spicy.\n\nI don't know if it's worth the price ($12-20 an entree), but I would go back again, if only so I can try out some of their other dishes.", "author": "Anna W."}

Thus, I often refuse to eat Korean and Mexican food when I'm in San Francisco and instead opt to eat it when I'm back visiting my parents in OC.  My reasoning is that I don't want to spoil my refined taste for deliciousness like bi bim bap, yookgaejang and soon tofu.\n\nAfter trying Brothers and another Korean place in SF, and living with a Korean roommate with awesome Korean parents who were amazing cooks, I decided that I'd stay away from Korean food in the city, especially after my roommate told me that the best Korean places were in Los Angeles.\n\nLate one night after work, I found myself at Stone Korean Kitchen with a childhood friend, who'd suggested this place since it was between our offices.  Sigh, okay.\n\nThe restaurant had maybe only 2 or 3 other tables occupied, since it was about 8:30 already.  We were seated and ordered the Stone Kalbi ($14.50), Kim Chee Fried Rice with fried egg ($9.50 + $1) and the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap ($12, plus $1 fried egg and $2 extra meat) with beef.\n\nThe Kalbi was okay.  I definitely prefer the marinated meats at other Korean restaurants, but it was decent.  Slightly sweet, tender meat, but I've had meats that were more tender.\n\nThe fried rice was probably my favorite, followed by the bi bim bap (but seriously, I've never seen another place charge extra for the customary fried egg).  They both had good flavor, but for some reason it didn't taste very authentic - maybe that's where the fusion part comes in?  The fried rice was slightly spicy, and the bi bim bap had enough seasonings on its own that we didn't need the sauce that came with it.\n\nIt's not a bad place to get your Korean fix (if you want the very basics), but if you're looking for some more variety and authenticity, this isn't your place.", "author": "Tori S."}

Korean food in SF is pricey, but Stone is competitively priced, AND gives you more food than other Korean restaurants that are in parts of town with low rent.  \n\nThe kimchee fried rice was OMFG ROFL LMAO LOL WTF really friggin GOOD!!!  It has spicy sausage in it, and comes in a stone pot (the ONLY place that serves that way!) and you can order a fried egg on top.  And the portion size is big enough for the fattest ass in the world to be satisfied with.\n\nKimchee jigae was impressive too!  Perfect flavor and spice, with just the right amount of meat, PORK BELLY (yep you heard me!), enoki mushroom... could've had a bit more zucchini though.\n\nBF liked his dolsot bibimbap.  \n\nI will NOT rate the banchan like all you stupid ignorant yelpers.  All you white people think banchan is how you rate a Korean restaurant.  It's not an \"appetizer\", and it's not a \"freebie\" or \"extra\"!  It's PART OF THE FRIKKING MEAL.  Don't count how many you get!  99% of you dumbasses don't even eat it all.  That shit pisses me off ~ there are millions of hungry people on this planet.  RAWR!  \n\nOh wait I'm not done ~ WHY does everyone compare SF Korean food to LA??!?  That's like comparing NY pizza to CA pizza!  OBVIOUSLY you dumb fux haven't figured out POPULATION has something to do with it... like there are THOUSANDS of Koreans in LA whereas there's only hundreds or so here.  Geez you'd think that's common sense... did any of you guys go to college?? Or h.s. for that matter O_o?\n\n***EDIT: Went for happy hour with 2 other gals, ordered lots of wings and a pitcher of the lychee soju.  We barely drank 2/3 of the pitcher!!!  And the wings are perfectly crisp on the outside with caramelized sauce, and hot and juicy on the inside.", "author": "s m."}

It didn't have a ton of flavor and the meat wasn't as well-seasoned as I've had at other places, but it was a big portion and very satisfying.  We split an order of the Jap Chae, which was really good - savory and slightly sweet.  \n\nI have to say that I was a bit disappointed by the service since it took a long time for our order to arrive, but despite that, I still enjoyed my meal there.

We asked for water (tasted funny!?), which was delivered another 20 minutes later.  That's 40 minutes before they even had our order.  The waitstaff was apologetic; it seems that for the size of their establishment (including the outdoor area) they definitely need more people.  Everyone else in the restaurant was having the same issues with attention.\n\nGiven the price of the food, you'd think they could hire more people.  Heck, if you hired more people, you'd have more turnaround and then you can have new people in the seats!\n\nEveryone else enjoyed their food - they were basically devouring it, presumably because (as previously noted), hunger is the best spice.  I got the tofu soup, which was passable - it was pretty thin, though all the pieces were there to fill it in.\n\nWe ask for the check, and after waiting for a bit, we decided just to go up to the counter to pay.\n\nIt sucks giving bad reviews.

Despite the mixed reviews, I really wanted to try this place for their famous dol sot bibimbap. I can't say I was excited to try it, but being a bibimbap fanatic, I just really wanted to try it to see how it measures up to some of the other places I've tried in the city. \nNow, we got there pretty early, as in, there was only one other party there. I got the bibimbap (of course) and my friends got the stone kalbi and the korean curry. \nThe kalbi came and we just knew that it didn't look right, I mean it didn't look like real kalbi. After tasting it, we confirmed our suspicions. The meat was too chewy and too sweet. The curry was also really sweet and according to my friend, didn't really taste like curry. Now, as for the bibimbap, I had a taste of the gochujang, and it was way too sweet to be gochujang. I also have to mention that my egg was burnt, and my rice was not crispy--which is the reason I love eating bibimbap in a stone bowl! It was just a hot bowl of rice and vegetables. So, burnt eggs, sweet gochujand, and non-crispy rice: not to mention the actual banchan and the seasonings in the bibimbap were not very tasty. In fact, everything kind of tasted...the same. I felt there was no variety. \n\nNeedless to say, my friends didn't finish their food. I managed to finish my bibimbap even though I really didn't want to. but i paid $15 for this bowl, and I couldn't just let it go to waste. \n\nI guess it depends on how authentic you want your food to be.

I'm talking my child's first birthday (which will make sense if you are korean or know anything about korean culture and my husbands big birthday bash).\n\nFull disclosure, I know the owners but that would not stop me from telling the truth.  The truth must have its way.  Always.1life2live.  Ok enough of my thug life credo.\n\nThe Good:\nOrganic quality ingredients.  This is missing in almost all korean restaurants.  Trust me, the Korean Ajumahs (capital A because they deserve respect) don't give a rat's arse about your wanting to be true to your farm to fork foodie hipster values.  So shut it.\n\nThe chef, the owners, they care.  They don't want no slip-shoddy this or that.  They want their good name out there and backed up by good food and good service.  They are very unKorean in this way.\n\nCatering is phenomenal.  The guests, always, always lurve their stone chicken wings.  They are crack on bones.  They have their appetizer and catering down and it shows in a great menu.\n\nDelivery, how awesome is that for catering.  I don't have to pick up, that is service well worth it to me.  \n\nThe Bad:\nIt's not the cheapest korean food but who am I kidding.  When is korean food EVER cheap.  HAHA.  Enterprising korean people.  Gotta hand it to them.  It's not the most expensive place, it's at a decent price range, truth be told and you are getting organic quality ingredients, so worth it and it's not bank breaking.  If you can afford to buy your hipster damn meat at some off the beaten path of a butcher in the city, where they hide their locale and it's 40 bucks for one lb of meat, this is not expensive.\n\nIt's not \"authentic\" in the way a korean person could tell so maybe not a big deal in the end.  But it's good and the chef's take on korean dishes is perfectly apt.  In fact, some creative license yielded really good flavors.  So this is a mixed good/bad depending on which side you sit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-02-09", "description": "Today we headed in this direction initially wanting japanese only to find out the restaurant that was there before (forgot the name) had gone belly up. We were hungry and feeling adventurous, so we were like \"surrre, why not?!\"\n\n\nRight off the bat...lots of space, very clean and mellow mixed crowd. \n\nI ordered a hot stone bowl with marinated rib eye while my cousin ordered the angry tuna. Our orders didn't take too long (about 10 min). So far so good.\n\nThe presentation of my bowl was as advertised; variety of ingredients that were both plentiful and colorful - and of course hot. My cousin's angry tuna on the other hand looked skimpy and boring.\n\nI'm not sure how they get the bowl that hot, but my sh@# was just too damn hot. I must have mixed the egg, meat, veggies and rice for about 5-7 minutes trying to cool it down. \n\nAfter it cooled down I took my first bite and was completely unimpressed - bland w/ no flavor AT ALL!! They serve it with a side of chili sauce, which I quickly dumped into my bowl...but no amount of chili sauce was going to fix this. It was especially evident in the meat...which they say is \"marinated\". Hardly. And it looked more like ground chuck than rib eye.\n\nThe only thing positive I can say about my bowl is that they give you a pretty healthy serving. But I'd prefer to have skimpy and flavorful than plentiful and tasteless.\n\nI didn't get my cousin's full take on his meal, but he wasn't complaining nor was he raving... so take that for what it is.\n\nAND to boot, my cousin ordered an iced tea only to find out they don't have sugar or any other type of sweetener. Our waiter said \"it's like that at most asian restaurants\". Really? And if that wasn't enough, the floor manager or some higher authority came over to reiterate what the waiter just told us, and appeared to be offended that we even asked for sugar... WTF?! No sugar?? Give me a f'n break!!\n\nSorry to bust your bubble folks, but this is what I call a \"one and done\" experience. I expect a lot more paying $30+ for lunch. You're basically paying for the location and view (what little there is). You're better off going to Osha a few doors down...which we should've done.", "author": "Albert G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-07", "description": "This is a Yelp success story!  My first review gave pretty middling (and all honest) feedback.  Shortly there after the Executive Chef, Terry, messaged me acknowledging the shortcomings and detailing plans to change them.  It took me awhile to give them a second go, but finally got a chance to today.  Sure enough, they integrated that feedback and the food is WAY better!!!  Also, (unlike some whiny Yelpers and scheming owners) I was pleased that there was no attempt at impropriety.  A good chef will let improved food, not freebies, speak for itself!\n\nKorean B.L.T: This time around the meat was spot on!  Thin, well marinated and the perfect balance of crispy vs. chewy.  The spicy mayo sauce was as good as ever.  The bread was ciabatta, which doesn't have the hard outer crust but still maintains a good chew.  The lettuce and the tomato were fresh and looked like they used higher end varieties rather than the lowly slicing tomato and iceberg lettuce some joints sling on sandwiches.\n\nSweet Potato Chips: When you have good, fresh chips you tend to not want to go back to the bag again.  There is a soft tenderness beneath the thin crunch that is lost on even the highest end prepackaged versions.  The chips helped make the B.L.T. just the right portion to fill me up, but not make me feel gross.\n\nStone Wings: Great rich soy sauce and sesame glaze.  Super crunchy skin, just the way I like wings!\n\nSteamed Man Du: Good savory minced meat center and supple dough wrapper.  Felt healthier than the completely deep fried option as seen at other tables.\n\nDuk Kochi: I've had a lot of Korean rice cake, but this is the tops.  Deep fried goodness enhances the flavor and texture!  The sauce is standard, but seems to absorb more into the rice cake because of the fried exterior.  YUM!!!\n\nDol Sot Bi Bim Bap: Standard.  A little akward cutting up the fried egg with a spoon.  The bowl was adequately hot enough to crisp the rice touching it.  The hot sauce was generously given to allow seasoning to taste.\n\nSoon Du Bu: Not a huge fan.  The tofu was rather firm for Korean tofu soup.  Also, the bowl could have been hotter since it's always satisfying to see boiling soon du bu.  Liked that a raw egg was given to mix in.  Didn't like that the pork belly was small and in short portion.\n\nSoju Mixer: Soju and lychee or mango in a huge carafe, with some sort of carbonated mixer.  I had the lychee and it was quite nice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-23", "description": "Thanks so much to Terry for inviting us to this soft opening and to Mina for being a wonderful server to our table!\n\nOur party of 4 all ordered a different dish for the appetizer course: chicken drumsticks, seafood pa jun (pancake), pork pa jun, and duk buk ki (spicy rice cakes). The pa jun was a tad tough and bland. I can usually eat this without needing to dip it into the sauce, but the sauce was the highlight of this dish. Needs more seafood/meat/veggies and less pancake. Our favorite plate out of the 4 was the chicken. Served with 5 pleasingly plump pieces of drumsticks smothered in a sweet peanuty sauce, I highly recommend starting off your meal with this flavor-shocker. However, I hope they consider cooking the chicken a bit longer. Seeing deep pinkish meat around the bone can be worrisome to a few diners, like myself.\n\nSpeaking of undercooked food, I knew there was something wrong with my duk buk gi when I tasted a stiff chalkiness in my rice cakes. It took a few more bites to confirm that it was indeed not cooked properly. I asked Mina to switch it out for a new batch, and the second time around did not disappoint. Though I was very displeased being served undercooked food, I'm glad they made such an effort to deliver a replacement without hesitation. I'm just fortunate it was just raw rice cake and not raw meat or seafood.\n\nThere weren't many options for entrees, so we ordered 3 stone kalbi dishes and 1 bi bim bap. The kalbi came with a side of rice, lettuce, kochujang (spicy Korean sauce), and duk (rice cake wrappers). Major points for serving duk on the side! Though the portions were generous, I can't imagine forking out $18 for such a simple Korean BBQ dish. I've seen this for a maximum of $15 at my usual Korean joints, and the meat is much juicier and flavorful. The bi bim bap was sadly a huge disappointment. Being tasteless, meatless, and excessively burnt on the bottom, this needs major improvement before the grand opening. \n\nI really hope the soft opening menu was just a fraction of the actual menu. If not, there definitely needs to be more variety to represent a \"Korean Kitchen\". I suggest adding soondubu (tofu soup), chicken based entrees, and even some noodle soup dishes to expand their menu. Additional ban chan items would be nice too (jap chae, potatoes, seaweed, fishcake, etc.).\n\nThis business has a lot of potential, being one of the very few Korean spots in FiDi. I get the feeling their trying to create a more contemporary dining experience with their selective menu and Asian techno music blasting in the background. I strongly believe keeping it traditional will win the hearts of San Franciscan diners over trying to be too modernized. I'd like to come back when they've worked out all the kinks in their business. Hey, that's what soft openings are for!\n\nMy experience with the food tonight was honestly a 2.5, but I'm bumping up my overall experience to a 3 for the commendable attentiveness and kindness from the wait staff and owners of Stone.

I only decided to check out this Financial District spot after finding out about their $5 appetizer happy hour where the majority of their appetizers (fried chicken wings, kimchee, korean pancakes, glass noodles, and homemade dumplings).  You could literally make a meal out of these $5 trays.   If I had to pay full price for any of the appetizers, I'd probably have to go for the fried chicken wings in the house sauce, especially since these are fried perfectly and don't have all that skin and fat like a lot of fried chicken wings usually do.   Just recently, they modified their happy hour pricing and now only one appetizer dish is $5 (seafood pa jun) while the other ones might be a dollar cheaper here or there, not quite as financially attractive anymore.\n\nOutside of their food, their BOGO free beer deals might make Stone Korean Kitchen the best Embarcadero budget alcohol happy hour place around.

When we got to the restaurant, our food was ready and all we had to do was pay at the cashier which was located right by the front door. We sat at a table in the sun outside of the Embarcadero center once we picked up our food and I opened my bowl of bi bim bop with chicken. I do not think it was the best idea for me to order bi bim bop to-go since I think it would have tasted as it should have, had it come in a stone bowl. The rice had a weird glutinous texture, one that rice should have never have. It seemed like the rice was packed into its foil bowl way too early in the day and was no longer fluffy rice. Also the fried egg placed on top of the bowl was not cooked thoroughly and you could still see parts of uncooked egg whites. I was glad that the chicken actually tasted pretty good and was not over cooked. The best part of my to-go experience was the fact that the many sauces and even the kim chee were packed into take-out cups and were conveniently located by the door. Now Stone Korean Kitchen needs to actually master preparing food to-go. \n\nPerhaps one day, I'll return to have a sit-down meal here.", "author": "Maya S."}

Have I had better bi bim bap in the financial district during a weekday lunch for take out?  Never.\n\nThis place isn't going to compare to an established Korean restaurant and I'll forever hold My Tofu House in highest esteem in the city, but if you're craving Korean and you're in the financial district, then Stone will satisfy. \n\nI used to go to John's Snack & Deli to get my bi bim bap fix during lunch hour but the dish here is better. Large portion for the $11 regular size.  It's funny that the fried egg on top is advertised as \"Free!\" but it seems that they used to charge $10 for the bi bim bap and $1 for the egg.  \n\nI got a split of the beef and crispy tofu. Delicious!  If you get the tofu, make sure to pick up the soy sauce with scallions on your way out.  I love that they don't skimp on offering you kim chee and gochuchang--there are containers by the door that you can take as many as you want.

It's not amazing or particularly authentic, but for what it is - it's pretty good. \n\nFor me, Stone is a sanitized version of Korean food (good for white people), but that also works in its favor because Stone is clean; the meat is good quality, and you're pretty sure you can eat off the table w/out picking up some kind of stomach disorder.\n\nYeah, there's room for improvement in terms of service and reading the other reviews, it seems like Stone just suffers from uneven quality. I don't know how old it is, but that's not something impossible to fix. I'm not sure that it's so deserving of all the venom that's on this page.\n\nI came some friends who had a groupon. Menu is pretty limited to Korean \"classics\" - kalbi, bulgogi, bi bim bap, kimchee fried rice, the pancake, the tofu soup (don't know the korean names sorry) and some more. The appetizers were fried tofu, korean fried chicken etc.\n\nThey have a nice selection of Hitachino beers (owl beer!). They're in the process of changing something related to their liquor license which is why they don't have a liquor menu. \n\nHmm. I asked for a mug of hot water and the waiter forgot. I asked again and it came in a water glass. So I asked one more time for a mug and I finally got one. I had no clue they had free tea. That would've been nice. Most of the other tables had them, but not all. Slightly annoying but meh.\n\nThey served 4 kinds of panchan. We got some shredded carrot and daikon, pickled cucumber, marinated bean sprouts and kimchee. The panchan aren't very interesting, not particularly spicy, but I attribute this to the fact that it's in the financial district and that its food is sanitized for the western palate. They're not going to serve those delicious deep friend small fish or anything more interesting b/c no one's going to eat it except for some Asians w/ their groupon fixes. That's just my take on it. \n\nWe ordered kalbi, bulgogi and bibimbap. The first two came with rice. That rice portion is not enough for a male adult. I'm just saying. We all thought the kalbi was pretty amazing. It had the right amount of fat and gristle for flavor but was pretty damn succulent. The portions were also rather large. One couple could split one of the large plates and come away feeling satisfied (in terms of meat). Bulgogi was tasty.\n\nThe bibimbap was a bit bland. I think it's because the vegetables weren't seasoned. All the vegetables that were in the panchan were also in the bibimbap. That was amusing. They also added spinach and corn. The corn was a nice touch b/c it was grilled by the bowl and was nice and crunchy. My egg was almost runny but not quite (again, the sanitized food). The stone bowl is really really HOT. I burned myself a few times, which was a bit of an annoyance. The portion was also large. \n\nThe staff at this place really try hard to please their customers. I also like the way the restaurant is designed with the benches and the low ceiling, all they really need to add are foot warmers underneath the table.\n\nHonestly, I feel like this place is a dependable win for the financial district. \nPrices were reasonable given the portions. The food wasn't heavily dosed in MSG, was of good quality, large portions. The food isn't authentic and amazing, but it's not trash. You can come away from here feeling satisfied that you just ate something well-balanced and healthy. \n\nIf you're seriously going to knock down this place for being inauthentic and westernized compared to your Mom's, well... man honestly, get over yourself and go to K-town.", "author": "Andrea L."}

I loved the stone wings. The sauce was just perfectly spicy with just a hint of sweet. I loved the sauce that I ended up adding the remainder to my dol sot bi bim bap when I boxed that up.\n\nFor sides, we received sprouts, cucumbers, kimchee, and what looked to be a potato/apple salad. The kimchee is mild enough that a small child could eat it, which is actually the way I like it.\n\nBecause I always wanted to try rice that is crisped in a hot, stone bowl, I saved my dol sot bi bim bap for last. I don't know if it's because we were the first people in, but the rice did not get crispy by the time I got to it. It got brown, but not crispy. I have never had this dish before -- I usually get short ribs at any Korean restaurant. And I erred and thought of short ribs while my fingers and voice picked out rib eye. Had I known that the rib eye was going to be minced, I would not have ordered this dish. Nothing against minced beef; I just preferred to see whole hanks of meat when I think of rib eye. Again, I have never tried this dish: The seasoning was okay. I had only a smidgen of the accompanying hot sauce. What made it taste better was the sauce from the stone wings.\n\nI hardly touched the sol dot bi bim bap while there (and the stone wings were filoing). And I just reheated the leftovers for dinner and it was still okay.\n\nI've had amazing food in San Francisco over the years, and I shouldn't expect my last food experience here to be the best one.", "author": "Ruiqiu K."}

But seriously, don't order the curry expecting Korean curry (which is basically the same as Japanese curry). This stuff is way too rich - tasted like it had butter or cream in it. It's as though the chef thought \"oh, butter chicken is a great curry dish, maybe putting butter in any curry will make it better.\" Wrong. Korean curry should have a clean savory taste, not this weirdly sweet/buttery thing I just ate.

A few friends wanted to check this place out and I tagged along. Korean happens to be one of my favorite cuisines, so it wasn't tough being convinced to try it out.\n\nI always just a Korean restaurant by the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap. It's my favorite dish and because I've had it at so many places, it makes it easy to compare across places. Overall, I'd say that I enjoyed this place enough, but not nearly as well as the Korean places I'm used to eating at. The Bi Bim Bap was all right. That's not to say it was bad (far from it!), it just wasn't as vibrant or flavorful as I'm used to it being. In addition, I ordered mine with tofu, which should have only enhanced the dish. Flavor-wise, it did; the problem (for me) was the the tofu was cut into large chunks and fried, which just doesn't fit with how the rest of the dish is composed. Smaller pieces would have gone a long way here.\n\nIn terms of the free appetizers that came out before the meal, they only brought three things out. And here, were had four people when I usually get twice as much as that when I go out with just my wife.\n\nFor several reasons, this place just doesn't strike me as one that produces particularly authentic dishes. With the Bi Bim Bap, some of the ingredients weren't correct and the way it was composed was just a little different that I've had it most everywhere else. Overall, it turned out to be one of the better lunch options I found in the Financial District and I'm happy to have come.", "author": "Jeff L."}

But I'm so very glad I learned about this place.  I'd read about crowds being the main problem here, so I came at 4pm on a weekend and had one of the best meals of my life.\n\nTo start, the hostess-slash-server was a million smiles, asked us about our afternoon, patiently answered our questions and showed genuine enthusiasm for the food.  It was not a spiel, it was faithful consideration of our questions and thoughtful answers. Seriously!\n\nWe started with a carafe of lychee soju, which was delicious.  It's served a little cooler than room temperature.  I thought, since lychee is so sweet, colder would be more appropriate, but the soju cuts through the sugar considerably.  Stone Korean Kitchen has evidently thought about this longer than I had.\n\nJust as an afterthought, I asked about another version of soju mixer they have, yogurt. Our server said it's Yakult-based, and suddenly, though I was enjoying the lychee, I felt a pang of remorse.  I didn't even suggest this (honest!), but she promptly brought a glass of the yogurt soju drink on the house.\n\nWe ate Ssam for Two with tofu soup, Stone kalbi and bulkogi.  If you attempt this after appetizers, expect to explode. The kalbi was perfectly cooked, and the bulkogi was among the best I've had.  The latter was a little strong on the marinade for me, but I detest salt in general.  The soup comes in a wicked hot bowl, and you can crack your egg into it to cook at your table. The whole thing comes with rice, lettuce wraps, three sauces, and enoki mushrooms, in addition to the pickled carrot, kimchi, and anchovy they put on everyone's table.\n\nI spent the next half-hour alternating heavenly bites, sighs of contentment, and exclamations of delight to my date.  Our server reappeared and was (as before) genuinely interested in whether we were enjoying ourselves, so I answered her honestly.  She then brought the operating partner over so I could say it again.  He was extremely appreciative and gave us a bit of the place's young history.  This is clearly a labor of love for him.\n\nWe were full from the meal, so for dessert we shared some coffee ice cream.  It wasn't AMAZING (ice cream is ice cream, I suppose), but here's what is: $2 for ice cream at a nice restaurant!!!\n\nFinally, Radiohead's \"In Rainbows\" was the house music for most of our meal - not loud, but certainly identifiable.  Big ups for tasty music too.\n\nYes sir, I will be back - many times.", "author": "Sean D."}

The service was pretty fast in taking our order once we sat down, and all of us ordered the dol sot bim bim bap.  Four of us had the marinated rib eye, one had the grilled chicken, and one had the fried chicken.  The major letdown here was that we had to settle for regular bowls and not the stone bowls.  I was sort of upset about this because I usually LOVE the crispy rice that comes with having the stone bowl.  I'm not really sure why we didn't get them, since everyone else in the restaurant seemed to have one.  We were told that we would have wait 20 minutes if we wanted a stone bowl.  Um...really?  There was no offer to give us a discount, and there was no real apology that came from the restaurant.  Ultimately, we were all starving and ate through our bowls, but this was definitely mediocre relative to what it could be.  The person who had the fried chicken said that it was just \"OK\" and said that he'd probably go with the beef next time.  The person who had the grilled chicken, however, said that it was delicious.  I've had the marinated rib eye twice now, and I can say with confidence that I really enjoy it.  The fried egg that comes with this is great, and I love all the vegetables that come with it. The small appetizers that come with it are good, especially the bean sprouts and cucumbers.

B.) hire one person to be the dedicated host/hostess to seat people. \nOnce you've done that, you'll be golden!  You won't have to have one person running back & forth like a chicken with its head cut off doing the job of two people and you'll get more happy customers enjoying your food! \n\nWhen I went there for lunch, there were 20 people who had been waiting to be seated for at least 15 min already, a line out the door for to-go orders, 6 empty tables & no one was being seated or taking to-go orders. Turned out only 1 person was doing these 2 jobs.  Not good for business & she looked stressed.  \n\nAs for food & pricing it was good & reasonable.  If they can step up the service and get rid of the slow & attitude filled waitress that said \"we'll seat people in a few more minutes\" even though 15 min had passed with no one being seated then maybe they would get a higher rating.\n\nOverall I'm happy that there's a decent Korean restaurant in downtown SF!

We had been a little wary of the reviews mentioning crowds and long waits, so decided to go for an early dinner on the weekend and avoid the workday lunch rush.  We were greeted and seated promptly and our server took time to answer all of my many questions about the menu.  Throughout the meal, the service was attentive but not at all intrusive, and we really felt that the staff cared to make sure we had a good experience.\n\nWe started off with a carafe of the lychee soju mixer ($20) which was more than enough for two people, and one of the tastiest cocktails I have had in a while.  We were curious about the \"yogurt\" flavored soju mixer, and when we asked whether it was any good, our server brought us a glass to try it on the house.  \n\nFor our meal, we decided to have the ssam for two, with bulgogi and stone kalbi, both of which were great.  The meat was perfectly cooked and the accompaniments were delicious.  We chose the silken tofu stew, medium spicy, and it was amazing - very flavorful and just the right amount of spice (and this is from someone who normally hates tofu...).  We were telling our server how much we enjoyed the meal, and she brought one of the owners over to our table so we could meet him.  He was very happy to tell us about his visions for the restaurant and seemed genuinely interested in our opinions.  It is really refreshing (and rare) to find people in the SF restaurant industry who actually care about their work.\n\nWe'll definitely be back to take advantage of the happy hour specials and work our way through the rest of the tempting items on the menu.", "author": "Marienna M."}

I knew something was up when the waitress kept referring to us as \"ladies\" even though I am clearly NOT a lady.  My manager complimented her pronunciation, but other than getting that correct, everything else was wrong.\n\nThey didn't write down one of our orders, and so one of my co-workers had to sit idly by while everyone else had their food in front of them.  I couldn't bring myself to eat while she looked at us with starvation in her eyes.  It was SO sad, like a puppy waiting to be adopted behind a window.  So I waited until her food arrived to eat.  The bus boy spilled hot tea on her to add injury to insult (scalded AND starving).  We barely got any kind of service and the waitress was curt to us throughout our experience and blamed us for her not getting the right amount of entrees.\n\nThe food was mediocre and my manager pointed out the fact that even though it was a Korean restaurant there weren't any Korean people eating there.

She had come here before and told me that I had to try it. We ordered the jap chae, stone wings, and the steamed man du (korean potstickers). The jap chae was delicious, one of the best we both ever had. My only issue was that it was too small of a portion--even for a \"small plate\". There were actually more meat and veggies than noodles. The stone wings were good but salty if you didn't have it with some white rice. The portion was good and we couldn't even finish the last one. The man du was my favorite. The sauce it came with just topped it off. Also, I've never been a big fan of kimchee but i couldn't get enough of theirs. Ma shi suh!!!!\n\nAs far as the service, it was decent. It was lunch time and busy so i didn't expect them to come to us every 5 mins. Our waitress was very nice and polite at all times.\n\nOkay, the price for me.. was a little harsh.

A little too much sesame oil in the noodles though.\n\nSashimi rice salad - Good.

I guess this is meant to be a more hip type of restaurant because I didn't see very many authentic Korean dishes.  Out of everything I saw, I decided to order the kimchi fried rice and had the fried dumplings for appetizer.\n\nI really liked the side dishes, they were a good start to the meal and I like how they are complimentary.  The dumplings were not good at all unfortunately.  They weren't fresh and there wasn't much filling inside of them.  The kimchi fried rice came in a stone pot which I love because I love the burnt rice on the bottom.  It's a pretty simple dish, spicy sausage, kimchi, rice and a sunny side up egg.  It wasn't fantastic but I liked how the portion was huge.  I ended up eating only a third of it and have a second lunch for tomorrow.", "author": "Rachel L."}

You'd think such an inauthentic Korean place would have good options for vegetarians/vegans but their vegetarian curried vegetables apparently has dairy. Fine, I know that coconuts are not a staple in Korea, and as someone who lived there, I know their curry is more along the lines of the Japanese curry, which has more in common with British curry than Thai curry, so okay, maybe it should have dairy. \n\nConsequently the waitress informed me that the only vegan option was to get the tofu bibimbap without the egg.\n\nThis was probably the most unappetizing bibimbap I've ever had, though I smothered it with kochujang (I had to ask the waitress for extra) to make it tastier.  The crispy tofu is literally deep fried cubes of tofu.  They give you a huge amount of rice and not very much vegetables (and as I said, the vegetables are not that good, sort of bland).

At the same time, there was so little of it in the rice bowl it was hard to really tell.  I think there was maybe a little over 1/4 cup of bulgogi in a fairly large take-out container.  Overall portion is decent, though most of it is rice, but....\n\n...the rice was the most disappointing part.  It was obvious that the person who prepared the rice mis-measured because he/she put in way too much water for the rice, and it came out untastefully mushy.  Mushy rice in a rice bowl is not ok....ever. Scratch that..mushy rice is never ok, period.\n\nThe girl taking orders was also a bit off...literally right after I made my order, my co-worker stood in front of the cash register for a full 5 minutes+ before she acknowledged his presence, and he had to ask her, \"Can I make my order now?\" and her response was a \"sure!\" as if she had no idea he'd been standing there the whole time. She was busy (very slowly) taking the prepared food and putting them in their to-go bags.  It was odd.\n\nI also saw a guy get takeout, only to come back a few minutes later saying he ordered grilled chicken for his sandwich and got beef instead.

Our server, Max, doesn't look a day over 18, but that didn't bother me.

Plus the plethora of korean restaurants in downtown are a dime a dozen, so I really have no complaints.\n\nExcept my colleagues and I saw that Stone Korean provided three small appetizers (kim chee, cucumbers and radish?) to all the other tables, but we didn't get any even after our dishes was served. So I asked 18-year-old Max if we could get some kimchee and the other little appetizers. His reply? \"Oh I think we ran out\".\n\nHuh? Ran out of kim chee? But thats a staple in korean cuisine!

I just reserved a table for 6 via OpenTable but the process was strange as reservation times would disappear and reappear after a refresh. For 1,000 OpenTable points, why not?! (I still haven't received my points as I am drafting this review.)\n\nMy group was seated in a few minutes as it wasn't super busy or packed at 8:30pm on a Tuesday night. Most of the menu selections sound very appetizing and I was excited to try some of each others' entrees. It took some time for the round of waters to arrive but that's ok. The order was crispy tofu, curry rice, jap chae, kimchee fried rice, fried chicken dol sot bibimbap, grilled chicken dol sot bibimbap, and a kalbi taco (off-menu special).\n\nThe banchan plates are pretty sad, 2 dishes of watered down kimchee, 2 plates of spinach, 1 plate of green things (zucchinis perhaps?\nI didn't eat them), and 2 plates of bean sprouts,The crispy tofu and jap chae were the first to come to the table and didn't take too long (makes sense since those are simple small eats). The rice entrees came a bit afterward. Those stone pots are so freaking hot! WAIT at least 5-10 minutes before digging into the rice!!! I am a fast eater but the 500 degree temperature is just too much for me and slowed me down. I guess it's a good thing but I had to continually down glasses and glasses of lemon water to balance the fireballs going down my throat and burning my stomach walls. I really like the curry rice my friend had, although it isn't spicy which is how I like my curry. The samples of the dol sot bibimbap I had were alright. I prefer my kimchee fried rice over simply white rice. Fried chicken tastes better than the grilled even though the latter is healthier.\n\nThe wifi, although free, is very weak. It really only works at the waiting bench and not the dining room. The restrooms are for one-person only but are pretty clean. The restaurant interior is alright but some may find the wooden chairs with low-seatbacks uncomfortable or unsupportive.

Great location taking advantage of being just off the F Line & working lunch crowd. The place looks sleek, if a little loud for all the hard surfaces. \n\nSoft openings, as others have said, are times for kinks to get worked out. Our lunch was full of kinks. We entered to a rather frantic looking desk staff and were eventually greeted & seated. We were then left to our own devices for just a hair too long with menus merely dropped off with no explanation if the smaller was to be the happy hour menu or just list some starters with drinks on the back. The same woman who sat us eventually realized we were not being served & took drink orders. Some disappointment that there were no Korean beers available (yet) & that the Japanese beer we wanted to try was also out. the menu did offer a decent collection & I thought prices were pretty fair.\n\nWe were ready to order, but the waitress didn't take our order for some time. I love getting a little sampler to start the meal, but I was a  tad messy without a plate. The appetizer of dumplings (da mun) were my favorite dish. My dish, the soup came with shrimp rather then pork belly. Major Bummer. No explanation from the waitress. There was also ample broccoli which I didn't expect & didn't really like.\n\nMy husband fared much worse. His entree of kalbi was delayed 30 min. Then we were told they were out. He ordered another dish. 10 min later- also out. Ordered another dish & an appetizer so he at least had something to eat and finally the kalbi came! Very forgiving when food is in front of us, we finally dug in. Kalbi was said to come with rice & crepe but just came with the lettuce so i gave him my rice and he enjoyed. It was nice, but far too expensive for what it was. Chicken was delectable & i would gladly order these again.\n\nAll & all- we would come back.

I won't eat whatever is put in front of me anymore. So I was very excited to see what looks like an authentic Korean restaurant open in the Embarcadero.  It's where the old Oishii was and even the furniture is the same, just a new paint job. \n\nShortly after ordering, we received a trio of banchan. I could have finished the banchan in three small bites. The lack of variety and small portions were disappointing, but hey this is the Embarcadero after all...\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, our food arrived.  My friend and I shared the crispy tofu. Two words: bad idea. There was too little food for what it costs and it tasted worse than flavorless Chinese deep-fried tofu. \n\nMy friend ordered the bibimbap. He felt there wasn't enough meat. There was one piece of chicken for his entire bowl of rice! The chicken tasted like Hawaiian BBQ.  I ordered the kalbi to see how well they managed to prepare and cook a staple. The kalbi lacked flavor and was rather chewy in a bad way. For what it costs, we should have gotten more food. At least, it should have tasted better. Birley's is next door and I think I would have been much happier with anything from there. \n\nThe service was nice, but the food took way too damn long for a lunch! C'mon now, people have to get back to the office!\n\nIf I could give this place 2.5 stars, I WOULD!

Tucked away nicely in the corner of the embarcadero center, across from the ferry building, with convenient parking underneath the building that can be validated. The location suits well with the stature of surrounding businesses, which suits the financial district clientele. \n\nAs you walk inside, you may be greeted by a chef with a white headband on or one of their servers in black. Either one you get, you'll be treated kindly and with a smile. You'll be walked to one if their cute (there's no better word for this) tables with fancy plates and chop sticks. Their menu isn't 10 pages long like some Korean restaurants, but it has all the basics that a Korean restaurant should have plus their own dishes unique to the chef. I haven't been lucky enough to go their during lunch time to have one of their bul go gi sandwiches, but I hear they are good. \n\nOk for food, you gotta try their Calamari small plate. I am a calamari whore and this place has my FAVORITE calamari. My friends that I go with really like their steamed dumplings which are amazing also. Their small plates, or appetizers, are pretty generous portions too so it's easy to fill up just on the small plates. As for entrees, my two favorites are the Bul go gi and the Pork Curry. OMG the curry. That's all I can say. I know you wouldn't normally think of curry when you go to a Korean restaurant, but they way they do it in the big bowl with rice in the middle surrounded by lots of curry sauce, fried pork belly, and carrots and potatoes is just like heaven. You will not be disappointed if you get this. The bul go gi is on-par if not better than other good Korean restaurants that I've been to in SF. Again, portions here are large so come hungry. In addition to having great food, you'll find their prices are lower than most Korean restaurants. So your wallet won't be empty when you leave either. \n\nThe servers here are friendly and helpful. If you have questions, they'll take the time to answer them without making you feel rushed...even if they are swamped with customers. No matter what's going on, they will always show a smile and you can tell they genuinely like the food that they are serving. It's hard to not mention the good looking girls that work there. They're not just good looking but friendly and helpful too. Stone also has a guy server there that is hella cool and smiles all the time. He's the type of guy you'd kick it with a bar or something. \n\nOverall, this place is great. Bring a date, or have a bday party here. Get the calamari, curry, and bul go gi and let Stone do the rest!", "author": "Evan A."}

I am always looking for awesome Korean food that can be comparable to LA or Korea. So when I heard about this new place, I was on it! Came here on a Saturday night for a late night dinner. The place was new and modern but casual. It over looked the Ferry Building and the Bay Bridge. We were immediately greeted and seated. \nNo wait?\nOh No...  (When the place is not happening on a Saturday night, it worries me.) \nLooked at the menu and was pretty standard and simple. We ordered the jap chae for appetizer and 'ssam for two' entree with bulgogi and spicy pork. It came with a choice of kim chee jigae and soon du bu (soft tofu stew). As usual with most Korean cuisine, you get all the side dishes. However, side dishes were on the smaller scale. I was a little disappointed. Jap chae was actually good. This looked promising. Then came the entree. Bulgogi and spicy pork were served on a sizzling platter. Entree came with a stack of lettuce and 2 small rice bowls. Bulgogi was very flavorful. Spicy pork was just OK. Soon du bu was suppose to be spicy but it was more mild than I liked it. The raw egg had a hard time cooking in the broth which is not normal. Soon du bu is suppose to be hot or near boiling. Although the appetizer was looking good for Stone Korean Kitchen, the entrees fell short. For the price though, this is a decent place. Prices are reasonable. Service was great though. Staff was friendly and our glasses were always full. Thank you. I hate to always ask for water. Overall, I think Stone Korean Kitchen is another average Korean restaurant in the city. It'll probably continue to do well though because of the great location and the reasonable prices.", "author": "Molly T."}

That's like complaining about bacon having too much fat on it!  \n\nI am always happy with their soon dubu jigae, bibimbap, hwai dup bap and the ssam for 2.  All of it is very solid and touches on the korean flavors that I grew up with.  \n\nI do have one complaint, however, which is that I went for shabu shabu, which is posted on their website as an offered entree (and 1/3 of their homepage advertises it!).  I came down to the fidi on the weekend specifically to get shabu shabu only to learn that it wasn't being offered yet.  I think that's false advertising and would recommend that they take it off the website until it's available OR list it as \"coming soon.\"  Yes, it is very disappointing to go to a restaurant for something that is specifically advertised only to learn that it is not yet being served.

Fantastic deal.\n+ 1 Stone Wings (part of small plates for $6.50, unless you make happy hour) - Big sizable drumlettes and wings in a sweet yet spicy sauce, all nicely crisped so you get crunchy texture on the outside, and sprinkled with white sesame. Truly delicious.\n+ 1 Jap Chae (small plate, $5.50) - I liked how they prepped it here since the noodles weren't over cooked nor stuck on each other and there was lots of bulgogi beef included.\n+ 1 Stone BLT ($8.50) - I like the new interpretation of this sandwich. \"B\" is for Bulgogi, and yum it is! Grilled marinated meat with lettuce, tomato, and mayo or some sauce on a soft french roll. I can see why this is also a popular lunch item.\n+ 1 Jenny, our server. She was super friendly and knowledgeable, despite our group overstaying our welcome I'm sure.\n\nNeutral on the following:\n- Stone Kalbi ($12.50): Yum. Juicy pieces of short ribs. Flavorful sweet savory marinade. Great with the rice it comes with. But the reason I put this in the neutral category because I expect Kalbi to taste like this.\n- Pork and Kim Chee Roll ($9.50): Somehow this one didn't quite have the flavor appeal as the BLT. My pork felt a little tougher.\n- Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap ($10): Really like the flavors but for some reason we didn't get any crisp rice, you know when you smoosh everything to the sides of the hot stone?\n- Seafood Pa Jun ($7): Traditionally one big round piece, this one came in 4 little rounds. Pretty cute. But I prefer mine a little less doughy.\n\nMinus\n- Location: Hard to find. Came at night and entered through street level. Signs weren't really visible to locate SKK. I had to circle around. Granted, it's not really their fault the building hasn't put up more locators, but gee, it's tough.

Every Korean kid knows the japchae from the Korean supermarket--cellophane and styrofoam encased blobs of greasy goodness.  Imagine all the tastiness, only with fresher, more vibrant flavors.  This place changes things up by going way lighter on the sesame seed oil than most other Korean joints.\n*Bulgogi sandwich is the bomb. \n\nCons:\n*There is not enough kimchi served at the meals.  Okay, so maybe I like to eat a socially-unacceptable amount of kimchi.  I admit that I have stunk up a communal fridge, and risked the ire of roomates, all for a kimchi fix.  And like any junkie I would totally be willing to pay cash-$$$ for it a la carte if the issue is that some customers are not raging kimchi freaks.  There must be a mutually-beneficial, efficient solution to this problem (hopefully one involving me eating out of a huge bucket of kimchi).\n*The place is kind of hard to find.  There isn't an entrance facing into the mall.\n*At full capacity it's pretty loud.\n*This may sound petty, but the ladies' bathroom auto-flush was way over-eager.  It got downright fresh with me.\n\nThis place seems to have worked out a lot of the kinks people mentioned (I assume from the very first soft opening day).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-22", "description": "Apparently Korean Stone Kitchen basically took over the place where Oishii Sushi used to be - adjacent to Justin Herman plaza looking out at the fountain (near Buckhorn Grill).  \n\nSadly, what I had such high hopes for, fell flat.  There is so much potential for being the only Korean restaurant in the FiDi.  \n\nFor lunch today I was invited for a soft-opening of the restaurant.  As it was a soft-opening, not everything on the menu was available which is entirely understandable as they are not scheduled to open to the public until next month.\n\nMy group of 3 ordered several dishes from both the appetizers & entrees sections.  For the appetizers, we ordered the pa jun (seafood pancake), Stone wings (chicken wings covered in a sweet sauce), da mun (dumplings) & the jap chae (noodle dish).  Of these our favorite was the Stone wings - we never received the jap chae.  The pa jun was not hot, only lukewarm, and it was very dense with a very strong oyster flavor (I'm guessing from oyster sauce since I didn't see much oyster in the actual pancake).  It did, however, come out pre-cut into pieces (for your convenience I presume).  The da mun didn't have much flavor other than that of the meat.  The coating in which it was deep-fried was also very thick and unlike any Korean dumplings/potstickers I'd ever had (thankfully).  The savior of appetizers was the Stone wings.  We received 5 wings on a plate coated in a sweet sauce which were also deep fried.  They had a deep, complex flavor to them and not your basic fried chicken.\n\nAs for the entrees, we ordered the sashimi platter, the kalbi dish & the tofu soup.  The sashimi platter was only 3 pieces of tuna on top of rice with lettuce and other vegetables.  My group was hoping that there would be some sort of sauce to accompany this dish, but there was not, only the hot sauces & some soy sauce which our waitress was able to retrieve from the kitchen.  (We actually ordered two of these, but they ran out, so we only received one.)  Apparently they were also running out of the kalbi dish, as the platter we received looked very anemic.  There were more onions on the hot plate than meat and they were out of the crepes.  (Picture to come.)  The tofu soup was interesting - I had requested pork belly, local mushrooms & local vegetables in it.  Apparently local vegetables means broccoli as that was the only vegetable I found aside from the mushrooms.  The pork belly was good, but the soup itself lacked flavor.  It tasted like a very watered down chicken broth with very little else.  I ended up squeezing half the bottle of hot sauce into it to give it some spice & flavor.  Another odd thing I found in it was jalapenos.  When I think of Korean food, I don't think I've ever seen jalapenos in it.  (Then again I could be wrong.)\n\nAs for the drinks, we ordered water & tea.  Only the water came out.  My two table mates ordered wine while I ordered a Japanese white ale beer.  Unfortunately, they hadn't received shipment of it yet (again, it was a soft opening so they hadn't received all of their stock).  In its place, I ordered an Asahi.  Came out fairly quickly and the waitress came around to refill water as needed.\n\nWould I come back?  I'm not really sure... The food left much to be desired but the service was good.  I feel that the prices were a bit high for what you get, especially with the sashimi entr\u00e9e.  I wouldn't mind coming back here for happy hour or something since it looks like all their appetizers are $5, but I'm not sure what their drink specials (if any) are.\n\nI truly hope that many of these kinks are worked out prior to the Grand Opening next month.  I would love to have a Korean restaurant out here - other than John's Snack & Deli which just serves certain items on certain days.\n\nOverall, I would say my visit for the soft-opening would be 2*, but since it was free and the service was good, 3*.  Our waitress tried did her best and was apologetic when she told us the food had run out or certain items weren't available.  However, bottom line is that the food needs some work.", "author": "Allan H."}

I'm a fan of Korean food and this is what we all came as a collaborative review:\n\n-Side Dishes: only 3: Kim Chi, Black Beans, and Broccoli - this was ok.\n-Seafood Pajeon - Was good, but it was cold! And where was the green onions?\n-Japchae - This lacked in flavor, basically tasted like cold noodles in sesame oil\n-Chicken Wings- Pretty tasty and one thing we all really enjoyed - only thing is that it looked burnt, but wasn't.\n-Fried Mandu - This was okay, pretty big pieces of dumplings but it felt like I was eating a meatball\n-Sashimi Bowl - Consisted of three giant pieces of tuna over rice. Wished the pieces were thinner so it would be easier to eat.\n-Bulgoki Stone Bowl - So I thought this would have been like the typical Korean stone bowl with the crispy rice on the side - I didn't realize it was going to be ALL crispy rice..so that was a little hard to eat. The Bulgoki was good but there wasn't much. Also, I didn't understand the saut\u00e9 eggplant on the side. That was different.\n\nWe also ordered the Kalbi entr\u00e9e but it never came. We sat there for an hour and 20 mins just waiting...and finally flagged down one of the waitresses to get our waitress and for her to tell us that they JUST ran out. Bummer. \n\nI was actually really excited to hear of a Korean restaurant finally opening up in the FiDi, but was disappointed in the food here. I understand it was a soft opening, but it wasn't prepared. You know its not so good when the soft opening runs out of food ....in fact they even ran out of rice! How does that happen?! I wish they had more traditional korean food. At least service wasn't bad - got our waters/drinks filled, and the waitress brought us what we needed  (forks, plates, etc) so an extra star for service.\n\nMy Scores:\nOverall Food = 2 Stars\nOver Food + Service = 3 stars.", "author": "Betty S."}

We picked this restaurant because we were going to watch the 7:30 show of Peter Pan 360...and the restaurant was right next to the theater!  One really great thing they do is the happy hour from 4-7 pm on weekdays -- small plates are $4!  We're light eaters, and we were able to fill up on the stone chicken wings, Jap Chae, and crispy tofu.  Our total bill for 2 without drinks came out to $12!  The wings were a bit tangy but otherwise good.  The Jap Chae is much lighter in taste and less greasy than at other establishments, and the vegetarian version we had was quite good.  The tofu was standard fare.  The banchan was also quite tasty!\nThe menu is fairly small, but what they do make they seem to do well.

As others have said, there aren't many good korean restaurants around here. \n\nI cam here for lunch with my family. I forgot most of the appatizers's names , but we had the steamed dumplings (man du?), the rice patty (bok chu?), and the seafood pancake (pa jun). The pa jun was actually pretty good. Not as meaty as in other places, but it still tasted good. the rice patty tasted pretty good actually, I liked it a lot. By itself it is bland I'm sure, but they poured a sweet/spicy sauce on it which tasted great. Finally, I don't normally like steamed dumplings anyways so im really nondescript about those. \n\nfor the actual lunch itself, we had\n kalbi (short ribs), - 1 out of 5\n the stone BLT (bulgogi, lettuce, tomato),  4 out of 5\ndol sot bibimbap (fried rice),  4 out of 5\nand the soon do bu (tofu soup).  5 out of 5\n\n\n\noverall, I really liked how they tasted. The bibimbap was pretty big and full of flavor (especially if you put in a good amount of the spicy paste). the BLT was actually better than I thought it would be but I wasn't expecting it to be very good. It had an interesting taste and I would suggest it for a somewhat lighter lunch. It also comes with sweet potato chips, which were just ok.\n\nThe star of the meal was definitely the tofu soup. I ordered it hot (rather than mild or medium), and it was actually hot. you could see the red pepper that they put in, and it tasted great. ive eaten at a lot of korean restaurants and this tofu soup was definitely one of the best I've had. It was flavorful, hot, and most importantly (for me), it was meaty. It is a seafood tofu soup (so it has a pretty different taste compared to the normal beef or chicken ones) and there was a lot of seafood and tofu. it will easily fill you up. \n\nunfortunately, the most basic dish, the kalbi, was not very good. it wasn't juicy and it was actually quite dry. Also, compared to the other dishes it had small portions. \n\noverall though a great restaurant for its location, but it might not be the best lunch spot.

The rice- its good. don't get me wrong. But what is up with the tiny portion of it? I'm Korean and I eat a lot of rice. The rice bowl was only filled up barely half way! I guess it kind of makes sense, since non-Koreans don't eat as much rice.  When i ordered more rice, they charged me $2 for a half scoop of rice!\n2. Kimchee Fried rice- it's so soggy... I mean I can make a better one at home. Maybe i should start making some and packing it for lunch... and they put so little sausages in there. If you want an egg, its extra charge. For the price of the fried rice, its over rated. \n3. Service- I understand that it gets busy during lunch hours. If i decide to wait outside for a table for 15 mins to 30 mins, that's fine. Because I made the decision to wait. But if I am sitting at the table and I haven't received my food and it has already been 40 mins. I get annoyed. \n\nGood things: \n1. The lady in charge is very nice. She came and apologized for the delay when the waiters were like, \"oh, we are backed up\". \n2. The side dishes are pretty decent and if you finish something, they will replenish it for you, no charge. \n3. If you share a soup type with a meat dish, 15$ per person isn't so bad. \n\nI would go back there again. Their steamed dumpling are perfect. I don't like think breaded dumplings. These are thin wrappings, and you can actually taste the meat instead of all the breading on it like some other places. Stone pot mixed rice, also called Bim Bim Bob, is pretty good. I would recommend it. \n\nOver all, service could be better, most things on the menu are pretty decent and the price is OK for the location it is at.", "author": "ji K."}

Trying to pronounce Korean food item names always makes me feel like I'm scatting. Which, in turn, always reminds me of the scat* battle between Brendon and Jason in an episode of Home Movies on Adult Swim but I digress... \n2. I can't keep eating the excellent Bolgogi and Kimchi burritos from John's Snack & Deli every time I get a hankering for Korean food while I'm working downtown. Why can't I? Look, don't get pushy, I just can't OK? I'm going to say it has to do with the incongruous cheese they put in them. Yes, I could ask for no fucking cheese. Are you always this contrary? \n3. My lunchmate and I left feeling healthy and satiated for a semi-reasonable price even though the food only had a passing similarity to what I would consider real Korean food. Not that I know Jack about Korean food but I know when I wander into those stoic yet friendly spots over in the Richmond I am smacked about the head and neck with flavor and presence, abundance and variety. At Stone the smorgasbord of snacky treats were limited to a mere three fairly mild choices (pickles, seaweed, very tame Kimchi), there was no \"cook-it-yourself\" (though my meal had raw tuna as the primary protein). It did have the geometric utility deco down cold (brrrr). \nDol Sot Bi Bim Bap - was told it was quite tasty \nHwae Dup Bap - I enjoyed it quite a bit though once I ate all the veggies and tuna off the top I was left with a vast starchy terrain of rice I was never going to finish. I've got a proportional bites fetish so this bugged me some. \n\nLike many others have said; if you're stuck downtown and must have Korean and have exceeded your quota of John's Snack & Deli this place will cut the mustard (though only just). \n\n*Scat like JAZZ BEATBOXING not, um, something else.

But then, we were able to place our order and the food was really solid -- the steamed homemade dumplings were tender and savory, the dolsot bibimbap tasty, and our drinks (a lychee soju for me, a Hitachino white ale for him) quite refreshing.

We ordered off of the Small Plate Menu and had the following:\nStone Wings- Fried chicken wings tossed in a special house sauce\n\nDumplings/Steamed or fried- filled with pork, beef, chives, and ginger served with a citrus soy vinaigrette.\n\nJap Chae- glass noodles stir fried with marinated rib eye, seasonal veggies and shitake mushrooms.\n\nCrispy tofu- friend marinated tofu served with a sweet garlic soy dressing\n\nCalamari- fried calamari served with a fire aioli and chili garlic sauce\n\nSeafood pa jun- savory pan fried Korean pancakes filled with white shrimp, calamari and scallions \n\nand to wash it all down a caraffe of Shoju(think korean Vodka) that was flavored with peach.\n\nFirst, these same dishes are sold on their happy hour special OR you can use a gift cert from Restaurant.com which is what we did. We liked all of the dishes, the wings were nice and crunchy and the sauce just a little spicy but not over the top.\nSince I was craving Dim Sum I especially liked the Dumplings which I ordered steamed and the dipping sauce was perfect to enhance the flavor.\nThe Jap Chae noodles were interesting to say the least, they really looked like glass or gummy bears I thought, nice flavor but when I saw \"Rib Eye\" in the menu description I thought maybe a thinly sliced rib eye would have been served with the noodles but instead the rib eye was ground like ground beef and quite frankly ground beef could have been used and I probably wouldn't have known the difference.\nThe tofu was nice not overly cooked so crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside.\nEver since my calamari dish at Scoma's (see my review) I've been spoiled so even though this calamari dish was good it couldn't hold a candle to Scoma's calamari but then again there's a $10 price difference. I think for the price and what you get it was certainly worth the money spent.\nThe Seafood Pa Jun pancakes were interesting, four palm sized pancakes arrived with a sauce, there wasn't any one particular flavor that stood out but they were good.\nThe caraffe of Shoju was Lori's idea, the flavor was good, certainly a chicks drink but I wouldn't want to get too drunk off of these just because they were flavored.\n\nOur waitress was pleasant, described the items to us in details when we asked questions, she and I were on the same page regarding the \"Do's and Don'ts\" with the $25 restaurant.com gift cert.

We had the hwea dup bab (rice with veggies, sashimi, and hot sauce) and the soon do bu jjigae (spicy soft tofu soup/casserole).  Both were good portions and filled me up well.  The banchan was decent too - good kimchi, cucumbers, etc.  The brown rice is terrible - don't bother.  It's hard and they give you about half as much but charge you extra.  Looking at other people's food, the dol sot bibimbap (rice with veggies, beef, and hot sauce in a hot stone bowl) and japchae (glass noodles with veggies) also looked amazingly good.\n\nDecor/Ambiance: I got there around the end of happy hour so it was busy and LOUD!

I checked out the menu online and saw a Stone Bulgogi bowl and was sold.  I decided to try this place for lunch with my boyfriend.  We sat outside on the patio since it was a pretty nice day.  When I ordered, they said that the Stone Bulgogi was only available for takeout or during dinner, so I decided to go with the Kimchee fried rice.  They brought out the little side dishes; sprouts, potato salad, Kimchee and daikon/carrot mix.  I asked for hot tea to drink.  Our food took a long time since there was a rush of people for lunch.  We didn't mind it too much.  But as we were waiting for our food, I had to ask for hot tea 3 separate times and they never brought it.  The food finally came, and I told the server that I don't want my tea anymore, and I need a container since I will be late getting back to work.  The server brought me a container and slammed a cup full of hot team on my table.  I absolutely lost it!  I got up, walked to the counter and said I needed to pay my bill now, so I can leave.  I was really upset about what the server had done and the lady at the counter noticed that I was very upset and asked me what was wrong. I explained the situation, that I had asked for hot tea on 4 different occasions, and that after telling the server that I didn't want the tea anymore, he comes over and slams the hot cup of tea on my table.  I handed her my credit card and said I just need to pay.  She was about to run my credit card, but turned to me and offered to pick up the bill.  It was the least she could do.\n\nNow, I don't know about you all out in Yelp world, but I believe there's a way in which people should be treated and respected, especially when you are a patron at an establishment.

The staff was amazing and the ambiance/location was/is perfect. But the real reason we recommend everyone must go to Stone? The food is UNBEILIEVABLE. So, must haves are: steamed dumplings, crispy greenbeans, The fried chicken or crispy tofu hot stone rice bowl (out of this world), kalbi & the crispy skin salmon... Ok, I just referenced about a 3rd of the dinner menu but seriously? I've never had anything not great here. I know the place is a must have during crazy m-f busy lunch, but this place is rad for dinner right on the Embarcadero. I love some of these people who bag on places b/c \"it's not traditional blah, blah, blah\". So I'll say this: if you love great flavors, quality ingredients and meats and creative dishes with a killer atmosphere where it's always consistent, then visit Stone Korean Kitchen.", "author": "Sean O."}

I thought the food in a 500 degree stone bowl was for presentation but it did a great job creating a unique texture - crunchy rice and slowly cooking the other items and keeping our food warm. OMG! I called this 'happiness in a bowl' and was still smiling on the way back to work. \n\nI enjoyed how the place is airy and filled with light and has a very welcoming feel to it. They staff were very friendly and enjoyed explaining to a novice like me, what the choices were. Very good. \n\nI think they have the best restaurant in the whole Embarcadero. I like to support hard working and friendly staff so I will be back and bringing friends and family to try other items. \n\nOh yes, still smiling!", "author": "Christopher P."}

The appetizers are reasonable and of course go well with beer.  If you you're a meat eater, the Kalbi is good.  Other than that, most of the meat dishes are skimpy on the meat and big on veggies.  If you're a veggie you could probably appreciate this place.  However, they give you the smallest amount of kim chee I've ever seen in a Korean restaurant.   Here's what gets me about this place - the food is okay, but not bursting with flavor the way a Korean restaurant should be and the owner/chef? had the nerve to say something about John's Snack n Deli in connection with the hot plate operation behind the counter.  Let me just say that John's mom is kicking Stone's butt in flavor, quality and portion.", "author": "Timer N."}

They give the little Korean side dishes to accompany your meal but it's extremely small unlike the usual Korean restaurant but then again this place is pretty Americanized. We ordered the fried dumplings as an appetizer and those were pretty good, probably even better steamed. We both ordered the dol sot bi bim bap since a lot of people have been raving about it. We both got ours with double meat and I got mine with an egg as well. It sucks that they charge extra for that. We were glad we got the extra meet though. The food was served in a heavy stone bowl so the dish was really hot and rice at the bottom was extra crispy which was nice. The food was so hot that it took a while before I could even taste what I was eating. I just was not getting any of the flavor. The dol sot bi bim bap really needed the red paste sauce it came with to give it flavor. I really liked the corn that it came with and I had leftovers for lunch the next day but the dish was overall so-so. I don't feel the need to come back for the dol sot bi bim bap. It's so close to my workplace though so who knows maybe I'll be back for a quick lunch fix.", "author": "Helen L."}

I enjoyed it and it was filling. The chips weren't too flavorful however. We got several appetizers; dumplings, chicken drumsticks, and cooked beef in a sushi roll. I forgot the names of each appetizers but they were all good. There were five of us at the table and everyone enjoyed what they had for lunch and the appetizers.

(and no, we didn't complain about the slow service, they brought it out themselves).  next was the bibimbap which was decent, with very little meat. the corn was a nice touch, but overall it was average. the final dish was the jjajang myun (black bean noodles)... and if you like the packaged stuff that tastes like crappy soy sauce, then this is the place for you. if not, steer clear of this. \n\nnice to know there's a korean place downtown, but i won't be going back.", "author": "Sam L."}

I will probably pass on the gim bap.  The kimchi soup is very salty and sour and tastes weird.  The spicy tofu soup can also be inconsistent in taste.  I really like the bibimbap and will probably just order that with the wings from now on and make the trek out to Sunset for My Tofu House for the really good stuff.
