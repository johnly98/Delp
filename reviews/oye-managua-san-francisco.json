It also seems a tad pricier than the rest.  Food is pretty tasty, though I believe Las Tinajas Restaurant is my favorite in the neighborhood.\n\nEspecial Mar\u00eda Elena: So much delicious food!  The charbroiled steak had nice sear marks and a little redness inside, so was just right.  The pork had a very pink marinade going on and was also charbroiled just right.  Neither strip of meat seemed overly spiced, but the pickled onion salsa on the side did a wonderful job of livening them up.  The rice & beans, sweet plantains and plantain chips were pretty standard and quite plentiful.  Not a huge fan of all the shredded cabbage, but that's more of a personal preference.  Loved the two chunks of fried cheese, definitely something I look forward to in Nicaraguan cuisine.", "author": "Adam B."}

Good food, good drink, fast cars, fast women... :)  all those things come naturally to me.  Being the first-born son of a scion of a well-known \" Somocista \" family will do that to you.  I have visited my lovely Nicaragua 9 times in my life and I have seen and experienced pretty much all there is to do in my lovely country, but the pleasures of the flesh ( specifically, the food, drink and female kind ;) are what keeps me coming back there for more every time before I have to hop on a plane and come back to the dreaded \" USA \".  \n     So what does a hoighty-toighty Nicaraguan expat do when he wants to eat a fine Nicaraguan meal when he is NOT at home, in Nicaragua?  He seeks out the finest place in his area to eat a fine Nicaraguan meal, and for the longest time I could safely say and surmise that the place to go in the San Francisco Bay Area for Nicaraguan food was Oye! Managua in the Bernal Heights district of San Francisco.  They had their stuff down COLD, I mean, the BEST Nicaraguan food you could possibly have within hundreds of miles of California's vast and varied terrain, I mean, you would have to go to, I guess, Los Angeles to get a meal better than the meal you would get at Oye! Managua.  Sadly to say, the past two times I have been there I have been SORELY disappointed with the quality of the food.  It has diminished considerably.\n     My Mother ( who was my Valentine's \" date \" this year ) and usually get the Maria Elena plate, which is the most colassal plate on the menu, consisting of the best Nicaraguan \" street food \", the kind you would get in the \" parillas \" and \" fritangas \" of Nicaragua, and on this plate you find:  gallo pinto ( Nicaragua's own concoction of mixed rice and red beans, VERY tasty ), fried Nicaraguan cheese, plantain chips ( plantain is a fruit like a banana ), ensalada ( salad ), carne asada ( grilled skirt steak ), chancho asado ( grilled pork ), and maduros ( ripe fried plantains ).  All of this is an ENORMOUS meal fit enough for 2 or 3 people and is a pleasure to behold and eat, and I took the liberty of taking pictures of the meal to show what it looks like.  Sadly, it didn't taste NEARLY as good as it looked.\n     It was HEAVILY doused in cooking oil all around!  I mean, greasy, oily, and nasty cooking oil taste all over, from the steak to the chips to the rice and beans, I mean, EVERYWHERE!  The steak was overcooked, fatty, and overseasoned.  The fried cheese was very good, as was the fried pork ( the highlight of the meal, you could taste the marinated lime, lemon, and other goodies used to marinate the pork in ) but the rest of the meal was SEVERELY lacking.  I would tack this to a bad experience but this happened the last time around too, so I believe they must have a new cook or something who does not know how to properly cook Nicaraguan street food!\n     I think I will have to book the first red-eye to Managua the next time I want to eat my beloved \" fritangas \" :(...", "author": "Gonzalo O."}

If it weren't for our friend taking us here and loving this place because it feels like home, I would've said something after 15 minutes, but I let it go. After ordering, it took another 30-45 minutes to get our food. What irritated the hell out of me was that two tables that sat down about 10 minutes after we did got their food about 20 minutes before we did. I hate it when restaurants do that! My 1 year old is fantastic when we go out to eat, but even this was too long for her, she was getting pretty fussy. \nOur friend ordered two plates of the Maria Elena Special, a side of the fried cheese, and 3 cacao drinks and man was the food awesome! I loved it!! He originally wanted to order just one of the Maria Elena Specials and then another, but the waitress told us that they were out of the other one. I didn't hear what he ordered, but I thought it was strange that they were out on a Sunday for lunch (probably their busiest time of the week). You should have popular items prepared.. just saying.. but anywho, the fried cheese was so good!! My husband really liked the asados and plantains, and my daughter loved the gallo pinto. Either that, or she was starving from the wait -___-. The salad also paired really nicely with everything else. I loved everything! The disappointing part... the waitress never brought the side of the fried cheese. Unfortunately, my friend never double-checked it, but I really hope he wasn't charged for it because I felt like he was. The crazy part was when she brought the two plates of the Maria Elena, she said the fried cheese was coming, so I don't know how it got lost there..\n\nWe left a 3:20pm. We were there for lunch over 2 hours!! 2 HOURS!!!!! I'm just glad that we were with good company. Chatting helped distract us from the RIDICULOUS SLOW SERVICE. And to me, the waitress wasn't all that friendly or apologetic about the long wait. I actually thought she was rude. I am so happy our friend took us here, but it sucks how bad the service was. I really wanted to give it a 5 star review because the food here is awesome. So awesome that even after the experience, I think I would come back, but I definitely don't think it deserved it. I actually think I'm being generous with the 3 stars..I think if this place were to do better in serving their customers it would be a HIT! Because so many people already love this place and talk it up. I just hope next time, service isn't as bad. I guess I'll have to see.", "author": "Kristina S."}

Managua since it was nearby. Everyone stared at us when we walked in and we were the only non-natives there which is always a good sign at any ethnic joint. The ambiance is very vibrant and cheezy (http://bit.ly/TvzSsQ). Not a good date place, fellas; well, not if you want to get lucky that is. If you're a carniwhore, you will be in meat heaven at Oye! Managua as the majority of the menu is very meat-centric.\n\nIn true Yelp fashion, we over-ordered and ordered for a family of four. The portions at Oye! Managua are no joke so beware. \n\nCraving something soupy, we ordered the Mondongo ($10), a beef tripe soup that's served with white rice and corn tortillas (http://bit.ly/TvzwTb). I'm huge fan of Mexican menudo but not the Mondongo. The tripe was very chewy and needed to be cooked down more while the soup base was too sour for me. The Lengua En Salsa ($13) totally redeemed the Mondongo. Huge chunks of lengua were stewed in a flavorful tomato and onion sauce until it was uber tender (http://bit.ly/Yh98RI).This was served alongside white rice, beans, plantains, fried cheese, salad and corn tortillas. I would come back for this dish alone. And then the Nicaraguan behemoth arrived...the Caballo Bayo ($26). HOLY F*CK, this thing was HUGE (http://bit.ly/UzIz4J)! Enough for a family of four, the Caballo Bayo (wrong description listed on menu) consisted of fried pork, shredded beef in the same tomato and onion sauce as the lengua, chicharr\u00f3n, Nicaraguan sausage, gallo pinto (rice & beans), fried cheese, fried plantains, and corn tortillas. This dish was more quantity than quality as the fried pork was dry, the chicharron so hard it can chip a tooth, and the plantains were over-caramelized causing a slight burnt taste. The tender shredded beef and sausage were good texture wise but that's it. The best part of the behemoth carniwhore platter? The gallo pinto and the fried cheese! Yup, you read right. The rice and beans were so robust in seasoning (cooked in meat broth?) that it was absolutely addicting. The fried cheese was crisp with a soft, oooey gooey center--simply irresistible.  \n\nBarely making a dent in our meal, we walked out with 3 full boxes of food to bring home. I also walked out with an 8 month old food baby. SEE, I knew wearing stretchy pants to brunch would come in handy. \n\nFellas, never second guess a women's decision.

I ate my meal, but I was discussed by it. The pork was hard and cold, Platanos cold and oily, the sausage burned out and cold, the queso frito cold. The Gallo pinto was the only decent thing, as well as the tacos.

When I lived in Oakland, I would travel to the Mission about once a month for lunch at Oye Managua. Nicaraguan food is hard to find on the west coast outside of SF or LA, but the mission has three (or four; one is half Salvadorean). I ate at all of them before I traveled to Nicaragua and easily Oye Managua is the best. I only wish that they would serve Guapote. The food compares to the Nicaraguan traditional breakfast food served in Nica itself. The service is courteous and friendly-even to gringos with only an intermediate level of Spanish (or less). I felt like Oye Managua helped satisfy my craving for Nica cuisine after coming home.\n\nGet the Gallo Pinto, the price can't be beat. The Maduro is excellent.

I recommend the seafood soup (siete mares), or the sampler \"Maria Elena\" will give you a taste of everything Nica (carne, gallo pinto, tejadas fritas, queso frito). But my all time favorite dish is the Indio Viejo, which is a meat stew. The nacatamal here is also really good, and less fatty than what you get in Nicaragua.", "author": "Amy P."}

This place should not even be above a 2-star. \n\nThe decorations confused me and made me feel like I was in a demented horror house - you will know if you go here what I'm talking about. \n\nThere was a man playing an organ and singing with a massive amplifier for place with maybe a dozen tables. This allowed me to not be able to speak to the people next to me. He did have a great voice however. \n\nA table in the back were celebrating a birthday, to which the cook from the back came out banging on soapy pots and screaming like a banshee. Very odd. At least they clean their dishes. \n\nThe food? Well, if what you want to order is salt, then this place is for you. We ordered and split their largest platter to share, which was fried, yet uncooked cheese, a 4lb heaping pile of the saltiest and least flavorful beans and rice I have ever had (how do you screw this up?) and a few slices of overly charred (and did I mention, salty) meat of some unknown origin. Thinking this wouldn't be enough, we ordered a tamale. Unlike a more traditional approach of wrapping in a corn husk, this was wrapped in saran wrap and wax paper. Interesting touch. Odd consistency. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this restaurant unless you are in a large group of Nicaraguan buddies looking for a dance party and salty treats on your birthday.", "author": "Anthony G."}

I tell you, finding a relevant location for Survivor Vanuatu  was tough, even in San Francisco!

I also sucked down a satisfyingly sweet, cold, cacao ($3) which was something like a mix between horchata and cinammon-flavored choclate milk.  \n\nThe Maria Elena, easily the most expensive thing on the menu was more than ample food for the two of us.  At $5, the nacatamal (big, Nicaraguan tamale, presented beautifully) would actually have satisfyingly served one of us.  The Maria Elena + the nacatamal meant both a) doggie bag needed and b) no room for dessert.\n\nThe Maria Elena platter includes:\n\n- Nicely sized slabs of grilled Carne Asada and grilled Pork\n- Yucca and deliciously sweet Plantains \n- Cabbage salad, a perfect complement to the meats \n- Fried cheese\n- all served atop a heaping volume of a black beans, rice, and onions.  \n\nEverything was VERY good and VERY filling.

I am not a big time Yelp user, but I had to log in and express what I witnessed today. I have been a customer at Oye Managua many times, and being Nicaraguan myself, I have developed a small relationship with the establishment. However, I will not be returning. We arrived to the restaurant sometime around noon and ordered. The food came out fairly quickly, and after we were finished we asked for our check. After four different attempts of asking the waitress, they still would not bring it to our table. After about twenty minutes of waiting, I had lost all my patience  and I approached the counter. I peaked inside the kitchen and I saw a pigeon walking around! The bird was just strolling around the room and the cooks just worked around it! After seeing that , I returned to my seat ( without the check ) and sat there in disbelief. They finally brought our check, and we left in a hurry.", "author": "Scarlet S."}

And the last thing that I hated about this place is that you cannot go with a big group. The first time the charged us an extra plate.

But it did feel like being in Nicaragua with the fact that everyone in there was Nicaraguense and the way the tables were set - plastic over the table cloths, serrated knives, place mats, etc. It was like home!\n\nWhen I opened the menu, I squealed! They had some of my fave dishes like mondongo and nacatamales. What is mondongo you ask? It's a bowl of awesomeness. It's a very flavorful soup with tripe, tendon, yucca, veggies and of course, the slice of corn cob. I hadn't had mondongo in a looooong time because no one wants to make it. You bet I ordered it!\n\nMy aunt ordered the nacatamal (think giant tamale, but WAY better) which was excellent.\n\n[Tangent on why nacatamales are better than tamales....nacatamales are 1) larger than a regular, Mexican or even Salvadorean style tamale 2) there's more going on inside: achiote marinated pork, rice, olive, raisin, a little potato, slice of tomato and a giant chunk of pork fat to keep it all moist. 3) Since they are steamed in plantain leaf, the masa is everso moist...and yes, the pork fat helps too. A completely satisfying meal in one package!]\n\nMy mom ordered the special which was Bajo (or vaho) which is meat cooked with yucca and green plantains in plantain leaves...SO good! It can be eaten with rice and the typical cabbage slaw of Nicaraguan cuisine. My dad ordered the grilled pork plate which came with rice, slaw and queso frito.\n\nWe also started with an order of tajadas, fried green plantains, and of course the queso frito. Don't be scared of the fried cheese, there are much \"scarier\" items in American food. It's a hard cheese that is fried...salty and delicious.\n\nThe staff was fun and it felt very comfortable being there although I'm sure some of the folks were like, \"Where did you people come from?!\"\n\nNicaragua is a very diverse place!", "author": "Karla F."}

Growing up we didn't know much about \"the Old Country,\" as he would call it, other than some of his childhood stories that usually ended up with him setting fire to something or getting severely punished by a nun (thanks for sending ME to Catholic school too, Dad.) As the self appointed cook of our family, my Dad would take a freestyle approach to cooking often not knowing what the final product would be. He fancied himself the Charlie Parker of the kitchen and believed that recipes were for people who didn't know what they were doing. More often than not, the end result had some sort of meat with a flour thickened sauce from the cast iron pan he would cook EVERYTHING in. Needless to say, my exposure to Nicaraguan cuisine was diluted by his \"creativity.\" He did make some kick ass fried plantains though.\r\n\r\nI pass Oye! Managua, a Nicaraguan restaurant, everyday on my way to work and decided that I should probably have some idea of what actual Nicaraguan food is. As I expected, we were the only non-Latinos in the place. That's cool. I'd be disturbed if the place was full of Chinese people.\r\n\r\nWell the waitress came over and started speaking Spanish to us. This was an excellent opportunity to impress my wife with my command of the Spanish language. Actually, my Spanish is best suited for making stupid jokes and insulting peoples' mothers but I muddled through. At one point she asked if I wanted a mix of mature and green plantains. Either that, or she asked if I wanted to be spanked with a piece of raw liver. In either case, the answer was an emphatic, \"Si!\"\r\n\r\nThe food arrived (sans spanking) and it was actually very similar to Salvadorean food.

Being 100% Nicaraguense and having grown up on Nica food all my life I knew exactly what I wanted for the party.  So Maria Elena worked with me on the menu.  I ordered Carne Desmenusada (shredded beef), Pollo Asado (grill chicken) with a jalape\u00f1o sauce, not terribly spicy but oh so delicious, Maduros Frito (fried sweet plantains), Platano Frito (plantain chips), Queso Frito (fried cheese), Ensalada de Repollo (cabbage salad), Gallo Pinto (rice & beans), and tortillas.\n\nMy guests consisted of Nicaraguenses & Gringos.  The Nicas were in heaven with everything we served.  The Gringos were in ecstasy, some serving themselves twice.  The Carne Desmenusda & the Pollo Asado were such a HIT!!  Everything was absolutely Delicious!!!!\n\nI ordered for 50 people, although I had 65 guests and had leftovers for my family (thank goodness).  All this food for under $500, definitely a lot cheaper than the Taco Bar.  Not to mention that she had a few of the guys help load all of this into my car.  \n\nI am a real foodie and since Nica food is my comfort food and my mother doesn't cook Nicaraguense food anymore I often visit another Nica restaurant whenever in the city.
