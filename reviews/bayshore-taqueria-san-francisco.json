We ate there and received complimentary chips with salsa. Not sure if that's just if you eat in or maybe you get it after spending a certain amount. Else chips are $1.25. When we received our order, we had to double check that the quesadilla was indeed a quesadilla- it looked like a burrito. We got the right thing and the quesadilla was very different (less cheesy) than what we both have tried previously. However, it was still delish as it was flavorful and creamy- just different execution (see pic). The tacos had a good amount of meat but thought they could have had a bit more seasoning or something. To me they were average and would get the quesadilla or burrito next time instead  \nGot aqua Fresca with a yelp check in. Choice was horchata or melon. Chose melon and it was really good. Fruity drink but not as heavy and sweet as a regular juice.", "author": "Christina I."}

San bruno is still the standard when it comes to mexican seafood. \n\nPlace charges $1.25 for bland trash salsa and chips. Or you can get it free with a checkin and other methods.

BTaqueria's food is almost like gourmet mexican like Tacorgasmico!!  The food is so fresh,  tasty, authentic Mexican!!  You can have spinach tortilla or tomato tortilla. You can have sauce on your burrito so it tastes even more like a meal! You can have 2 or more types of meats or shrimp with meats.  They have vegetarian burritos/tacos.  They have soft tacos or crisp tacos that look like little mini taco salads.  Even their nachos were light and heated up (not the stale old hard-to-bite-into nachos that taquerias usually throw into your bag with your burrito) with guacamole sauce that wasn't too hot  (i hate it when taquerias give you blazing hot fire-breathing dragon sauces that will burn your tongue and lips off!!).  The only problem is the food is pricey and the portions are not huge.  $2.75 for a large horchata aqua fresca, nearly $14 for a 2-meat superburrito.

He gave me a crazy look and walked away.\n\nI love Panda Express' orange chicken but I prefer Mexican food over Chinese food. And, although I have my all-time favorite taqueria in the Excelsior: Mexico Tipico, I'm always on a hunt for great lengua. And, I've found it at Bayshore Taqueria.\n\nBayshore Taqueria is in the cutties across from the Old Clam House. The makeshift parking lot only fits three cars. Sadly, their operation hours are VERY limited which makes it difficult to visit regularly. On weekdays, they close at 7 pm. On Saturdays, they close at 5 pm and they're closed on Sundays. (Update 6.10.15: Janet T. informed me that they now close at 3 pm Monday - Saturday. I called, and the employee confirmed this). *le sigh* They have an enclosed dog-friendly patio though. Yay!\n\nI judge a taqueria's authenticity on the meats they offer. If they don't offer tripas, buche, or lengua, I won't bother visiting. Bayshore Taqueria offers lengua but not the other two but they offer other meats not found at other taquerias like tocino and jamon. I read that on Tuesdays, they offer fusion burritos like chicken adobo burritos. It would be awesome if they can offer various fusion burritos as a daily special every day.\n\nWe had just come from happy hour at Holy Water so I was a bit tipsy, and of course wanted e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g off the menu (standard taqueria menu plus burrito bowls). This is a girl who once ordered $150 worth of hotel room service at 3 am then never ate the food because I had passed out. =X \n\nAnyhow, we ordered the Super Nachos w/ carnitas ($8.95) and two Lengua Super Burritos w/ double meat ($9.25 each). I like ordering double meat in burritos so I have leftovers for another meal. \n\nI really should NOT be in charge of ordering because we couldn't even finish the nachos (also received complimentary chips), and we only managed to share 1/4th of one burrito. \n\nThe Super Nachos w/ carnitas: http://bit.ly/1Jom7sn came in a heaping mound of super crunchy chips topped with refried beans, melted shredded cheese, carintas, fresh pico de gallo, crema, and guac. I rarely order carnitas because I find it dry and a lot of taquerias season the sh*t out of it. Not here. The carnitas is super tender, moist, and lightly seasoned. I wish there was more than 4 pieces though. The nachos also needed more cheese. Only about 1/4th of the chips had cheese on them.\n\nWe were pretty stuffed by now but we had to try our Lengua Super Burritos: http://bit.ly/1BM92RL. I think I should have ordered it sans refried beans because it was too wet for my liking. It didn't seem like we received double meat so Mr. NSS went back to the counter to inquire. The owner was nice enough to bring us out a bowl of lengua and sincerely apologized (this would never happen at other taquerias). We went to town on the bowl of lengua and saved our burritos for leftovers. \n\nDat lengua doe. \n\nIt was incredibly tender and moist, just like the carnitas. It's on the blander side which is just fine by me. The texture was so soft like it had been stewing for hours, and not masked with commercial seasoning blends.

Bayshore Taqueria is as good as it gets!\nI've been to Bayshore Taqueria twice now, and my biggest gripe is that they're not open enough! What I mean is I wish they were open after 8 pm on weekdays because I appreciate their food and service so well.\nI've had their veggie and meat options, and they are all awesome. The pollo, pastor and carnitas are to die for. I haven't found meat this tasty in a Mexican join in awhile.\nAlso, mad props for having a covered patio where I can bring Fido my dog (not my dog's real name, but it's like John Doe for dogs).

This is cool and I'll try that next time, but just note that the cashier offered the chips and salsa in Spanish to the two fellows in line after me...just sayin.  i really appreciated the owner's thoughtful retort to my review and will definitely give them another try.**\n \nOriginal review:\nAfter leaving BevMo with a fussy dog and it being an hour past my and my dog's normal grandma dinner time, I was about ready to throw a fit from *h-anger* so I stopped off at this Taqueria on my way home. I called as I was pulling out of the parking lot of BevMo and ordered an enchilada plate and a Horchata (because yelp had a check in offer for a free Agua Fresca and you can't beat free). \n\nWhen I got there, there was no parking, so I had to create-a-spot which is an old family secret. \n\nBayshore Taqueria is really dank looking, complete with a dim lighting and hobos crack-heading around outside the front door. Mmm, so hungry. The girl at the register was extremely sweet on the phone and in person. But I was surprised to hear my total for an enchilada plate and a free drink was a whopping $14.08 and the meal does not come with chips and salsa which was a huge boner killer. \n\nWhen I got home, I came to find out that this food seriously tastes exactly like La Corneta which you might think is a good thing but there's a reason that I don't go to La Corneta and that reason is that the food tastes really oily to me and I'm just extremely sick of it after going there for 10 years. Bayshore's beans are way better than Corneta's though. But La Corneta only has one hobo out front and that guy has a great sense of humor and is far less likely to shank you so Corneta wins on that count. \n\nWould I go back to this Taqueria? Only if I were in the same situation that I found myself in tonight, where my only other option was fast food, but, honestly, in that situation I would probably just go for fast food. This place wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, I just found it to be mediocre and coupled with the fact that it's overpriced and there's ABSOLUTELY no parking.", "author": "Emma H."}

I'm glad I got two groupons for here b/c it was that good.  The only setback might be the chips but it's free so I don't care for it.  But my friend that got the nachos said the chips were a bit salty.  I tried it I didn't think it was, so I'm givin this a 5 star.  I think you get off on Cesar chavez exit from highway 101 and then it's around the corner.  \n\nOwner was down to earth, super friendly & nice!  He seemed pretty young in his late 20's or 30's (could be a family buisness-not sure) This place is Dog Friendly!!!  If you have a doggie here, you just gotta eat outside in the patio area that has a roof covering, tables, seating, & windows.  NOT inside the restaurant though.  It looked like it's inside though but it's not.  I came here on a super hot day so it was great sitting on the outside. Yey!!  My poochie was so happy just sitting there.  Finally a place where I can bring him to eat too!!  But please do clean the seats afterward if your poochie is gonna sit there.  That's what I did b/c my doggie left foot prints on the chair.  This is just out of respect.  \n\nThis place is a hidden gem.  I'll definitely be back for more.  Tip: If you have a groupon for this place you can't get the free fresca drink offer for that yelp checkin.  \n\nThey don't have self serve salsa but they do have self serve water. There are hot sauces bottles on the table.  A tabasco sauce, a green one sauce (that's my favorite b/c kind of soury) and another one that he said is super hot (and of course I didn't try this.  I was already very satisfied with the green one and the tabasco sauce).  This place is worth trying if you like Taquerias.  :)  I can say one of my favorites.", "author": "Juila L."}

On the corner of Bayshore Blvd and Oakdale Avenue, you'll find a few new popups that are sure to please! I've recently noticed new window decor on Bayshore Taqueria and decided to check it out on their Taco Tuesday. \n\nI coincidently popped in on Cinco de Mayo just before closing. They offer $1 tacos on all meats except the obvious (shrimp). I ordered two carnitas, 1 al pastor and 1 grilled chicken. They're slightly smaller than the standard taco, but for $1, can you really complain?! I also added a sangria and during their happy hour (3pm-7pm) its only $4. \n\nThe verdict: Food service was quick and service was exceptional! The owner was very friendly, approachable, and even offers you his specials. He checked in on us once which I appreciated and I was more than happy to give him feedback. The food is unbelievably delicious. The carnitas were flavorful, crispy, with just the right amount of \"kick\". The al pastor and grilled chicken were also delicious, but my favorite by far is the  carnitas (and luckily I had 2!). The sangria was delicious without being overpowered by any specific flavor. I initially thought it wasn't strong enough, but by the end, I began to feel it kicking in. \n\nThe owner mentioned that he tries to invite other chefs on Tuesdays to offer special tacos. He mentioned doing a fusion taco with korean inspired cuisine, and even fish tacos. You'll definitely have to call to ask him for the week. \n\nThere's ample parking in the area, they accept credit card payments, and hell, its a great spot to check out before it starts getting too crowded by popularity.

I've gone here 4 times and have enjoyed it every time trying the super burrito, carne asada plates and the nachos.

I was happy to get a breakfast burrito at 1pm on a weekday. The GF got a quesadilla and my brother went less gringo and got real tacos. \n\nWe got our number, sat down and we expected to have to go pick up the grub when it was ready. What was nice is that they had a brief gap in being busy in the lunch rush, and so they had time to deliver the food to our table. This is a nice touch for a restaurant where clearly the expectation is that you pick it up at the counter. \n\nThe food was great, fast and hot; plus, there was plenty of it. Lots of guacamole and crema on my burrito. Others at the table had similar experiences. Yummy in general and not greasy or anything that you sometimes find at other joints. \n\nFor a place I don't know we'd normally visit, we will probably be back!", "author": "Drew D."}

I'm still wondering.\n\nThey have all the standard meat choices: steak, grilled chicken, chicken in red sauce, carnitas, al pastor, and pork in green sauce.\n\nBut what's really interesting are the Taco Tuesday specials that caters to a true SF foodie's palate.\nThey have these crazy fusion burritos that you can't get anywhere else.\n\nOne week was a crispy pork belly burrito (OMG sooo F'ing crispy), second week was a kalbi burrito (I die), this week was a chicken adobo burrito ( I LOVE adobo). \n\nSo to sum it all up:\n\nBayshore Taqueria is a quick and cheap Mexican joint that serves quality fresh food that you can taste. Their Tuesday fusion specials are everything!!\n\nAnd despite the fact that they are located right off the Cesar Chavez exit (traffic hours= the worst), it won't matter in the slightest after you take a bite of your burrito: every bite is filled with hefty slabs of meat, guac, rice, pico, cheese, sour cream and salsa.\n\nFor more pics and deets, visit: http://cyneats.com/the-best-burrito-in-san-francisco/", "author": "Cynthia L."}

I have eaten at every taqueria in the Mission, and have enjoyed the all the highest rated spots, and thought I had found all my favorites after years of trying all the different taquerias. I absolutely love burritos and thought I wouldn't find anywhere that I enjoyed more than what I have already had. That's why I was extremely surprised when I tried Bayshore Taqueria and it blew me away, this place has the best nachos and burritos I've ever had, and the staff is soooo nice! Plus they've extended their hours to 8pm. Stop into Bayshore Taqueria and you won't be disappointed! \n\nP.S. I've never wanted to write a Yelp review before, but this place is such a hidden gem that I had to!", "author": "Blah B."}

We needed some carnitas for our make-your-own tacos at home, so I dropped by to pick up a container to bring home. The owner chatted me up while I was waiting - very friendly and welcoming. He told me their hours, mentioned Taco Tuesdays, and told me that the outside seating is dog-friendly (how did he know?). He threw in complimentary chips and salsa. The half pound of carnitas ($8) was DELICIOUS. Can't wait to go back and try burritos, etc. Yum!!!", "author": "Esther L."}

Unlike other places (in Glen Park for example) which have started to charge more, give less beans and more rice in their diminishing burritos, Bayshore Taqueria's burritos are HUGE, full of beans and not hard on the pocketbook.\n\nMy only complaint is they sometime run out before I get my fix.\n\nI stop there a couple times a month.", "author": "Laura M."}

The guacamole and the pico de gallo are very fresh. Another thing I love about the food, is the fact that they serve lengua.

Both were extremely delicious.  The fajita bowl was fried to order light and cirspy and was filled with a large portion of lettuce, beans, salsa, guacamole, sour cream, grilled peppers and onions and meat.  The burrito flavours were so savory and the rice cooked to a soft perfection.  This meal was shared by 3 of us and our bellies were happy and full.  We also tried their horchata which was very flavourful.\n\nThe man taking the order was very nice and helpful in making our selections and other two cooks also nice when I changed my order and added the meat to my fajita bowl.  Place was bright, food area was clean.  Service was prompt.\n\nI parked up along side their wall which was easy enough but backing out you have to be careful to back up close to the sidewalk on the red light when the cars are waiting at the light on Bayshore then carefully watch the oncoming turning traffic directly across before merging.  I saw a sign for more parking down the block which was inside the restaurant but not really sure about where that was.  There needs to be more signage outside.  \n\nI would come back for their food for takeout.", "author": "Hermann C."}

Great location, right across Bayshore from The Old Clam House. I went by a couple of weeks ago when I saw there was a new restaurant in the space. Turns out this place is my new favorite taqueria, mainly because they are serving pozole and it's the most authentic version of my favorite Mexican stew. Loads of pork, some on the bone, perfectly seasoned red chile broth and loads of hominy - my biggest gripe about pozole is that most places are stingy with the hominy, but this pozole had just the right amount of hominy - a lot!
