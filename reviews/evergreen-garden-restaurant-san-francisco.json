{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-03", "description": "If there was one thing I took for granted from all of my years working along the Peninsula, it was definitely how easy it was for me to get my regular fix of pho.  With several options nearby, it was just a matter of which one to go to!  Now?  Well, let's just say #worklife ain't about that #pholife.  Which ultimately led me to Evergreen - not a spot I'd been dying to try, but more than willing for pho just a few blocks away!\n\nStepping inside, Evergreen has a quirky look about it - there's a \"main\" dining area, some outdoor tables, and then another section of indoor seating on the other side of the patio.  Pretty unique, especially if you want to eat your pho/bun/rice plate outside.  What's more, the menu (which has a lengthy array of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai offerings) includes some unique dishes that you don't see often.\n\n-- TAI NAM GAN SACH - Rare Steak, Well-done Flank, Brisket, Tendon, and Tripe with Rice Noodles...$8.75\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/evergreen-garden-restaurant-san-francisco?select=khUq7szaqsXforbAb8uvLA)\nWhile this may have satisfied my cravings, this definitely isn't among the best I've had.  Despite the ratio of noodles to meats being pretty fair, and how the brisket and flank were great, there was only one piece of tendon (booo) and the broth felt really generic. \n\n-- COM THIT NUONG CHA GIO - BBQ Pork and an Imperial Roll with Steamed Rice, Lettuce, Tomato, Cucumber, Carrot, and Fish Sauce...~$9.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/evergreen-garden-restaurant-san-francisco?select=gFlB0TRgS4Sf1oBwFuHBVw)\nMuch like with the pho, this left me feeling mixed.  The food looked good, the imperial rolls were crunchy and flavorful, and I liked the pickled carrots.  On the other hand, while meaty and seasoned well, the pork was greasy and not exactly plentiful (just a few pieces).  Fine for the most part, but not spectacular.\n\nBeyond the food, service was actually pretty solid.  The workers were attentive and decently friendly when I dined in and rather quick the time I ordered takeout.  Also, while the restaurant itself looks dated and a bit worn, the tables felt surprisingly clean (I have no idea why this even caught my attention).\n\nAll in all, for those who live/work in the area, Evergreen is a nice little neighborhood spot that offers something different than what most other places nearby have to offer.  What's more, they did enough to help me scratch my itch for pho.  However, I can't say I'd make it a point to come back.", "author": "Mike L."}

And when we pulled up the block, we were like \"where's the restaurant ?!\"... this place looked like a greenhouse! My party of 3 arrived and was seated in the main dining room. It appears they have 3 different seating areas: one was an outdoor patio kind. The place was spacious! Although a little old looking and the place seemed like it needed a little fix me up, I can tell by the decor and people that this place was authentic and family owned. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the lemon rare beef and fried egg rolls to share. The rare beef was fresh and full of flavors from all the toppings: mint, crushed peanuts, lemon juice, fish sauce, and onions. They even gave us an additional nuoc mum sauce to add as much as we want. The egg rolls came in 5 pieces and they were hot and crispy! Delicious and made  to perfection! \n\nFor the pho, the bf and friend got their #1 and it had lots of goodies ranging from brisket, flank, beef balls, tendon, tripe, and rare beef. I ordered #4: pho tai. The broth was delicious, clear, and not salty or MSG-filled. (How I know?? I didn't have to drink hella water after like most places after eating). The slices of beef were tender and not hard to chew whatsoever which I hate. Balanced amount of meat and noodles. They even gave us individually a mini side plate of veggies ! O.o (never seen that before!)  \n\nService was efficient and attentive. The female server with blond hair was really nice and friendly. She refilled our waters and took away some of our used plates. \n\nI guess only downside was my Thai tea lacked flavor.. tasted pretty bland and watered down. Other than that, food and service was great. :)", "author": "Anissa D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-04", "description": "This place has been remodeled recently and they changed their menu and ordering process. The new process is that you order at a counter, get a table number and then seat yourself. The menu has been shortened and the prices are a bit higher than before. Overall it seems like their system needs to work out a few kinks. I was overcharged for an item (the person ringing me up helped to rectify the charge quickly, but I was the one who pointed out the error) and I also had a hard time finding a place to sit with my coworkers because several tables were not bussed. Although we had table numbers we had an incorrect order come to our table and my food took so long to come out my coworker's clay pot had charred rice at the bottom of it (literally black) which we assume is from it sitting too long in the pot. The worst part was that their self serve water station had dirty glasses at it. I picked up a glass from the top of a stack and found lipstick on it.\n\n\nIn terms of food I tried their BBQ Pork Garlic Noodles which were ok. The majority of the Garlic was sitting on the bottom of the plate so the noodles lacked garlic flavor. The BBQ Pork was tasty. \n\nOverall, I like how the remodel looks, but I think they need more staff to work with their new system. I would give it a few more weeks before trying them again. Hope they're able to work it out!", "author": "Christine L."}

Good enough that I think I ate it 3 times that week. One of those meals that taste really good, but after eating it couple times you sort of not want it anymore because the flavors are a bit strong. Try it if you like chicken dishes.\n\n- Bun - what I get what I want to be a little bit more healthy. Get it with imperial roll too.

Come to Evergreen. The restaurant is nice enough where it doesn't feel like a hole-in-the-wall, but its without pretense. It just wants have you eat good Vietnamese food.\n\nI was real into the pho, and the spring rolls were great. A good amount of broth that I slurped up, and then drank my friend's too. I don't get why people leave broth over--it's the best part of the soup. Besides the noodles. And the beef. And the string beans. And the basil. Basically, everything is great.", "author": "Rosy H."}

I have ate at the actual restaurant a few times but order take out almost weekly from them.  Eating at the restaurant is very nice.  There is an open courtyard with umbrellas to shade from the sun.  They always make sure to keep your water glass full!  The pho is a really nice size with the usual accompaniments.  Some things outside of the norm I like is the number 102 Canh Chua Chay Dau Hu spicy sweet & sour vegetable soup, bean cake cooked with fresh vegetable in spicy and sour broth.  There are huge chunks of tofu, tomatoes, bean sprouts, and pineapple.  It is really good and vegetarian.  I also like the Crispy friend noodles.  I have only got the vegetarian version but they taste great.  Their mock chicken was really amazing too.  Tastes like real chicken, texture and flavor.  Spring rolls for the most part are always fresh.  You can tell by the color of the bean sprouts ;-)  The default sauce is the hoisin, but I always ask for the fish sauce to dip spring rolls, important if you are ordering take out.  They don't really have Tom Yum, they only have Tom Kha, but it definetly tastes different then the Thai version.  A lot redder with chili oil.  They will also put minimal coconut milk in and it tastes just as good.  They serve large dried chilis in it as well.  I also really like how they swipe your card once they get to your door, they don't take it over the phone, I feel a lot more secure this way.  I'm also a fan of their Pad Thai.  Tastes very saucy.", "author": "Tyler J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-21", "description": "I love Evergreen Garden! For me, this is one of the most beautiful restaurants in all of San Francisco! Why? Because it is *so unique*! I remember the days when all the places in SF had their own character - when you were inside some place, you knew it was irreplaceable and its own thing. You knew you were in San Francisco because there were no businesses like the ones here. These days, all the yuppie restaurants seem the same to me, like interchangeable black-and-gray-painted chain outfits that could be in Any Urban City, USA. But Evergreen is a throwback to more creative times in my opinion. It's so memorable  - just the shape of the building alone is unique,  and you have the option of two different dining rooms or the lovely garden patio to choose from. When you walk in, you really feel like you are traveling, like maybe you are in Vietnam or something. It's got a wonderful 1960's - 1970's feel to it actually. There are old tile floors, fish tanks, and, if you're lucky enough to hit the right day, even old Vietnamese violin ballads playing. A real mom and pop feel that is all its own. I just love that. \n\nThe service is also excellent and I have never ever had a bad meal here. Generous portions of delicious food at a very reasonable price (yes, you can have a great lunch for under $10.00). \n\nIf you're someone who misses the old-school places of yesteryear, you will love it here.", "author": "Heidi-Jane S."}

I work in the Mission so I haven't had much luck finding any Vietnamese food that isn't filled with scoops and scoops of MSG or its an Americanized version of Vietnamese food. I believe it was Friday, when my coworker and I were last to go out to eat lunch and she suggested that we go to this place cause its about a 5 minute walk from where we work versus the 15 minute walk we take to eat Americanized Pho at Mau. \n\nSo the ambiance of the place....plain and simple nothing too luxurious. The atmosphere had a very authentic feel almost as if we were going into a family house to eat grandma's homemade pho(no offense intended). The workers seated us right away, and like all Pho places you must try every locations Number 1 on their menu, being their Speciality Pho. \n\nLike all Specialty Pho's they come with obviously pho on the bottom with beef balls, flank, and all the basic meats that you would find at any other pho place. Well the only way to really identify how great the pho is, is not by what they put in as toppings to compliment the pho, but it's highly rated by the soup base. The soup base of the pho was VERY flavorful, obviously a hint of MSG...I mean who doesn't use MSG these days, but with that note the soup tasted very authentic. You see I scale my pho flavorful strictly by how \"dirty\" I think it is. Dirty not necessarily means that it can be lethal to your health, but to me dirty helps me identify how authentic the food is and how it can remind someone or place them in the setting of Vietnam where Pho is eaten like rice. The soup was delicious in my opinion, probably not the best i've ever had but definitely a great place to go when you don't have a long lunch. Portion sizes were great, there wasn't too much or too little, it kept me and my co worker energized for the rest of the day without knocking us out midday like all other carbs would do. \n\nSo the 3 star rating strictly comes from the cleanliness of the restaurant. I know I know up in the review I was talking about the term \"dirty\" and its relation to authenticity, but the cleanliness I am talking about is strictly on utensils. My co worker and I had to switch in and out forks, spoons, and chopsticks if i remember correctly about 3 times to get a set of utensils that didn't have left over food on it. I recommend all people that come here to take some time to wipe down your utensils before using them, cause based off my own personal experience I could have eaten who knows how many days old noodles that were stuck on the utensils. \n\nOverall, great small place on a cold day for lunch. Very affordable was about $10 a person walking out the door with great portion sizes. Flavor was very rich in the soup and noodles were cooked very well.", "author": "Allan H."}

I like to get the vegetarian spring rolls with peanut sauce, because I love peanut sauce and mint and noodles and tofu.  You get 4 large half-rolls (each half is almost the size of a normal full roll).  My BF has gotten the vegetarian crepe, veggie fried rice, and veggie chow mein, and I've gotten a veg/tofu/noodle dish almost identical to the chow mein but with flat noodles.  The fried rice was relatively flavorless, and the noodle dish wasn't anything to write home about.  (I didn't try the other two).\n\nThe service is pretty bad.  I've been there four times.  Once, nobody seated us.  Another time, we didn't get menus.  Another time, we got menus but no one took our order.  And another time, the lady taking our order left to attend to something else in the middle of taking our order and came back a few minutes later to finish.  Hmm.  The guy waiter is decent, as you can catch his eye and he smiles, whereas the two women are... more zombie-ish?  Not a nice thing to say, but it's impossible to get their attention, and they sort of ignore you, and one of them mumbles when she speaks.  \n\nThe bathroom is decently clean for such an establishment, and always well stocked.", "author": "Stacey B."}

It's close enough to the office, so I was initially excited about that.  It's a run down little place, no frills, no fancy anything and definitely no heat (it's 49 degrees here).  I wouldn't be surprised if I saw a roach crawling on the wall... you get the idea.  Customer service is ok - they're hustling to get people seated and food out.  They're terse with words, but pleasant.  The cost of the items are reasonable. \n\nI would assume that going to a Vietnamese restaurant they would know how to prepare 'bun bo hue' correctly.  Boy... was I wrong.  They used small vermicelli for the noodles and they used pho beef for the meat.  The broth was disgustingly salty and the whole bowl was full of oil.  I took a picture of it before I started eating and after... it looked almost identical. \n\nI want to try this place again to see why they had so many customers inside... perhaps something else they serve is actually worth going for?

We've walked and driven by this place a millions times so decided to finally try it.\n\nMeh. The Pho itself was good. Not spectacular but just ok. Had decent flavor but not that really savory beef flavor that you get from good Pho. We also got the crepe pancake with been sprouts and shrimp. That was kind of a dissapointment. Really not much flavor at all with out the sauce. \n\nThe other thing was I ordered a seafood soup that was just not that good. But the thing that really annoyed me was they weren't able to fit all the soup in one container so they put some of the broth in a regular thin Styrofoam cup with a lid that was open. So what do you think happened? It all freaking spilled out in the bag which I didn't find out until I got home.\n\nSo basically half my soup was swimming in the plastic bag.

I get it without cilantro (I'm one of those \"cilantro tastes soapy\" people) so I suspiciously eyed these big floating leaves in the soup bowl when it was first brought out. I've gotten the big spiky cilantro-ey stuff at other restaurants before. I'm not sure if it's a cilantro variant or not, but it tastes like it. Luckily these turned out to be pieces of cabbage. Haven't seen that in Pho before, but I need my veggies so munched it down whilst breathing a sigh of relief!!\n\nBroth was tasty. Unlike Sunflower's, it actually had some flavor. And when I mixed it up I could see some bits of garlic settled on the bottom. Yumm!! Just what the doctor ordered!!\n\nPlenty of basil, sprouts, some fresh jalapaneo slices, and a wedge of lime accompany the soup. A little skimpy on the sprouts, The shredded chicken was good.

I ordered the shrimp spring rolls and the bun rieu, the noodle soup with seafood, crab past and tomatoes.  This is my regular dish at other Pho places I haunt.

The rice paper on the out side of the roll was so hard it had obviously been left in the fridge after they made the roll a few hours ago.  The inside consisted of mostly noodles, a piece of lettuce and a sliver (not a half, maybe a quarter) of shrimp.  No mint leaves or basil or anything.  The bun rieu looked right when it came out but it didn't taste right.  It was not flavorful enough, the fish cake and the steamed egg was kinda bland.

Their biggest faux pas with this dish was that the noodles were the same kind used to make bun rieu.

There was no brisket or congealed blood, nor was there even some steamed pork loaf or gio.

The dining area was pretty crowded for a Tuesday at 8.30, but service was quick.  \n\nI read other Yelp reviews before coming here, so I knew that they serve Pho ... it just wasn't listed on the menu.

It's pho, right?  The person repeated what I said, so I figured I was safe.\n\nUsually, I stick to Pho with raw beef and flank steak (I'm really into the veggie stuff like sprouts, peppers, lemon/lime, basil, etc) but thought I would live dangerously today since I had to rely on the photo to order and didn't want to deal with the hassle of making a \"special\" order.\n\nThe combo pho had some serious offal in it.  I quake just thinking about it.  I stabbed at one of the beef balls with a chopstick and contemplated eating it, but my broth and beef ball started to resemble a goat scrotum soup that someone had attempted to serve me back in the USSR in 1990, and I just couldn't get my teeth to pierce the membrane and sink into that firm ball of mystery.  \n\nI fished out my beef balls, intestines and tripe and found myself with a small mound of rice noodle in a puddle of watery broth.  The sprouts and veggies as well as the hoisin and sriracha sauce helped liven up the broth, and I drank every last drop.\n\nNext time, I'll take a stab at communicating what I want from the beginning, or I'll just order off the menu like all the other happy people in the restaurant.\n\nWhy four stars?

Either my memory is failing me or my memory has been so saturated from watching 3 syndicated episodes of the simpsons everyday for YEARS. \n\nI used to eat here fairly often...the quality was hit or miss. Some of the curry dishes were of the generic thick yellow variety that looked like the skin color of the Simpsons. Ack...I swear...that TV show applies to everything. The bun was ok; not as good as Tu Lan, but not bad either. The pork was good...but when is pork not good?\n\nThe food is decent...it's for eaters not diners people!

You're fairly inconsistent with the quality of your food but you somehow seem to teeter above the line of acceptability.  Your service is horrible when you're busy - the food is incorrect, some dishes are quick and some are slow to arrive, you never pay us any attention let alone bring the check when we're done!  And the decor...those knick knacks that line every centimeter of the window sill need to go!  Embrace the concept of minimalism and clear it out.\n\nHOWEVER, you know I love you because I just had dinner with you, I have frequent lunches with you, and I've even catered our office board meetings with you - twice!  I've had the opportunity to get to know many people on your staff and in your family.  Everyone is warm and friendly and you always ask about me when my colleagues dine without me - which makes me feel loved :)  The variety you have on the menu is to be commended (though you could take out the Thai section and leave that to the Thais.) - I especially love your catfish claypot and sour soup, a combination that always makes me think of my mom.

The food on the other hand is not the best. I went here twice now and don't get me wrong its ok but hats the problem its just ok. I ordered the #1 and spring rolls. When the spring rolls came out they were dry and tasted bland and the peanut sauce was very watery and also not flavorful as it should be. The pho came out with a bunch of cilantro on top which I didn't like. It would have been nice to know that they toped it with that I would have opted out. Overall my first visit was ok there wasn't a lot of people maybe two other tables were occupied. The second time I came their with my friend. The service wasn't the best and we didn't even get water until flagging the lady down and when they brought the water out...5 min later they gave my water to the wrong table. I order the pho and spring rolls again hoping this time It will taste better. This time I opted out of cilantro. The spring rolls came out and they tasted horrible. My friend and I bit into it and then stopped eating it. They tasted like they were frozen or made 2 days before. Very dry and bland. The sauce was watery again as well. The pho came out and it was bland nothing special deff not worth the 7 or 8 bucks I paid. When it was time to pay the bill they didn't take the spring rolls off our bill even though we told them they were bad. We paid the bill and left but to my surprise I left my phone their. I realized this at around 11 pm when they were already closed. The next day I cam and the older man had it and gave it back. I love the honesty of the workers their. I believe this was the owner who gave me back my phone but it doesn't matter. Everyone is nice I say try this place out.", "author": "Nelly L."}

The pho is comforting and their Chia Gao (fried imperial rolls) are awesome.  However, the much anticipated Bun Bo Hue was disappointingly unauthentic.  No thick vermicelli noodles, and none of the crazy animal parts this dish is supposed to have.  But considering this place is located in the Mission (read: mostly non-Asian clientele), I understand...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn insider told me that the old owners of Golden Flower Vietnamese Restaurant in Chinatown (which was soooo much better when run by the old owners) took over Evergreen Garden.  The SO and I tried this out last night, after deciding we didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown and go around the block 10 times to find parking.  There's ample parking, and we've decided we'd come here for pho over Chinatown any day.\n\nWe started off with the Banh Xeo (crepe) and ordered a bowl of pho for each of us.  The crepe was huuuuge.  The garnishes were very fresh, unlike many Vietnamese places where the bean sprouts normally come out with a brownish hue, an indicator that they've been sitting out too long.  We enjoyed the crepe a lot, and loved the fact that they didn't come rushing out with our noodles.  We really got to enjoy it.  The pho was pretty good as well, however I noticed the broth wasn't as clear as it used to be at Golden Flower.  The portions are huge, we were stuffed.  I noticed that they have Bun Bo Hue on their menu, I can't wait to try it next time!\n\nService is good, food is yummy, I'd definitely come back here again.  The restaurant seems out of the place in this outer Mission area, and the decor made us feel like we were having Vietnamese food in Jamaica, but it fit and we liked it a lot.  My only gripe is the really really dim bathroom lights, it seriously didn't feel like there was even a light on!", "author": "Diane L."}

I'm not sure it went down in quality or that the change was unwelcomed, but the establishment leaves a lot to wish for. It is a very interesting building and has something of an outdoor garden eating area. I remember I thought I'd bring a friend here. We decided to sit outside at first. On that particular lunch hour the establishment thought it would be a good idea to get some construction done and started cutting some metal with an electronic saw. To make this short, there is really no quite way of cutting metal with a saw. They stopped sawing after we pointed out that we could barely hear the hammering over the loud scrapping and motor noise of the saw. \n\nThe food is ok. There was one bad day where the meal I got made me never want to eat vietnamese food again, but given the small choice of lunch spots in the area, I came back. They have a pretty good vegetarian menu and the spring rolls are tasty, if the sauce is made right that day. I swear the spring roll was going to spring back up from my stomach one particularly bad sauce making day.\n\nYou may ask why I keep going back or why I gave it three stars. I guess I don't know many vietnamese places or what I should expect from them. I give them the benefit of the doubt.

No doubt the work travels this week and general lacked of sleep helped make this happen, but come on, I was popping Airborne and zinc left and right and thought I'd emerge unscratched. Not so much.\n\nWhich brings me to Evergreen Garden, a random Vietnamese spot at 18th/Harrison. The neon pho sign illuminated my destination as I got closer, and I was anxious for what other yelpers had said was good, cheap pho.\n\nAnd that is exactly what I got. Not too heavy, very inexpensive ($6.50) and done up really quick. They even take credit cards.\n\nNext time I need a pho fix, and venturing to a new spot is out of the question, I'd definitely return.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-08", "description": "Yesterday I ate half a chicken, well actually I ate something probably predominately soy-ish shaped like half a chicken. I've officially been vegetarian since 6th grade, I say \"officially\" because by not really liking meat I was probably a default veg. for a while beforehand. As such, I've never been much on a quest for food that looks or tastes like meat. But, as I have had my fill of stir-fried tofu dishes at least until my 30th birthday, during my most recent trip to Evergreen Garden I had the Curry \"Chicken\" with broccoli. And what I was presented with looked VERY much like a bilaterally dissected chicken, I'm talking including the shape of it's little chicken thigh, with chicken skin (not kidding, it even had the variations of color chicken skin gets when it's cooked and a slightly bumpy texture on its simulated chicken tummy). When I cut into it, I half expected to cut into fake chicken bones. And I'm no chicken expert but the \"meat\" shredded similarly to chicken. The amazing part? I liked it. A very flavorful, not overly spicy, curry with onions, carrots, and broccoli, this was quite a pleasant tasting meal. Except that I'm still a little freaked out, I think for the same reason that people write science fiction novels about robots taking over civilization. I mean, there's such a thing as too close to the real thing. I don't know, what if this fake chicken decided to give me fake salmonella? \n\nAnyways, aside from this meal totally messing with my mind, if you are someone who wants to get as close as possible to eating a real chicken without eating a chicken, then this Garden is the garden of paradise for you. Tea is really good, I love the indoor-outdoor setting (makes me feel like I'm somewhere tropical instead of SF, wearing gloves while I eat my lunch), they bring you a lovely assortment of additions for your meal and it's plentiful food for the price. The non pseudo bird meals I have had there (mainly stir-fried tofu dishes of course) were good as well, though slightly oilier than I might have liked. But if  my fake chicken ever has fake bones in it I'm done.", "author": "Hallie R."}

A variety of plants, the swaying umbrellas and the peaceful air about this place make it a quiet Vietnamese food oasis in the strangest of spots.\r\nThe food is all serviceable.

The broccoli was fresh, the shrimps tasted good, the chicken was white (I'll say no more), but I could do without the crinkle cut carrot pieces.

I felt like the portions were rather meager, the pork was bland and flavorless, the beansprouts were limp, not crunchy like they should be and the noodles were nothing to write home about which is sad considering - how hard is it to mess up vermicelli?  Also the basil that came with it was limp and clearly not fresh and had very little flavor - one of the things I love most about vietnamese restaurants is the fresh and fragrant basil... but not at this place.  Furthermore, the bowl was practically 1/4th lettuce - not a good sign.  The salty lemonade I ordered was okay but nothing I'd order again, not here at least.  My friend's pho did not look like anything special either.  Nothing seemed fresh.  Lastly, I had to flag down our waitress to get our check, I don't like having to do that.  I like the ambiance of this place but it would take a lot to convince me to come back, this was definitely one of the least satisfying experiences I've ever had at a vietnamese restaurant.", "author": "Suzanne V."}

Last time I ate here I was blown away by a big bowl of soup with a generous portion of noodles and tender, perfectly seasoned pork, accompanied by a plate of fresh, fragrant basil, crunchy sprouts and a wedge of lime.  Fresh, satisfying and delicious.  The menu includes a selection of Chinese-style dishes which, while not their strong suit, are not bad.", "author": "Jennifer N."}

I've been a couple of times so far, and each time was a good experience. The pho is good- lighter and less-oily than a lot of places, which is just how I like it. The summer rolls and peanut sauce are also nice. This is, of course, not gourmet dining, but it's a good place for a cheap meal.", "author": "Nicole J."}

(Fiance is a med student on a rotation at the \"General\" or \"El Generale\" as they call it). In any case, drove past this place, had a parking spot right in front, so we decided to try it. Had the veggie fresh spring rolls (very good - always judge a place by their spring rolls and the price, which at $5.50 for 4 big pieces wasn't bad!), pad thai- was wondering if this was vietnamese or not but oh well - which was pretty good. fiance had the chicken vermicelli dish and vietnamese coffee which he liked. Service was nothing remarkable and decor gets thumbs down. But pretty good for a quick meal and comparable to the Sunflower Cafe in the Mission, but way less crowded, don't have the deal with the crazy waiter there and much more mellow experience.", "author": "M B."}

But the folks here never blink an eye. And, as chalkily ravenous as I may be, my Vietnamese food fanaticism still makes me pay close, careful attention to my food. And the food here is usually so good, homey, and spot on that I can simply sit back and enjoy the flavors. Ty, one of the owners, was awesome. A bit soul-weary, I found myself looking at a calendar on the wall, with some words in Vietnamese. Intrigued, I asked him to translate. By the time my to go order was ready, I had some insightful Buddhist philosophy uplifting my spirit -- words about waves and kites, nature and nurture, and I left the restaurant armed with  a fragrantly heady batch of noodles and a smile. Who knew that a little Vietnamese restaurant hidden in one tiny corner of the Mission could be heaven for the tummy and the soul? \n\nSometimes, you find gorgeous experiences in unexpected places.
