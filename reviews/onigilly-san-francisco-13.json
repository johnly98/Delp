My friend had bookmarked them on Yelp and we thought it would be the perfect spot to hit up during a quick lunch break.  The space is very small and the line twirls around in a sort of organized chaotic manner.  We managed to squeeze about 12 people in line in this tiny space.  \nThe menu is not huge but almost everything on the menu sounded appetizing.  Although they have some yummy sounding bowls on their menu, I figured that for my first time eating somewhere like this, I just have to order Onigilly.  They offer vegetarian Onigilly, as well as chicken, beef and pork, but the star for me was the seafood options.  I ordered the spicy shrimp and the snow crab Onigilly, getting a filling lunch for only $6.  What a steal!\nIt was awesome watching the staff construct the food.  They are definitely a well-oiled machine as they had an perfectly timed assembly line in the kitchen.  The kitchen is open to the small entry space so you can watch everything being made.  I had my order in my hand within 3 minutes of ordering.  \nI was super, duper happy with my experience here.  If I lived nearby, this would definitely be a weekly lunch.", "author": "Annie M."}

Prices are reasonable at ~$3 per onigiri.\n\nHowever, my last 2 visits were not as good as I remembered it... try spicy shrimp was too saucy (too much cream or mayo) and similarly, the crab one also has too much mayo... which over powered the rice and the seafood taste itself.\n\nBUT, the rice is always and consistently good -- perfect texture, taste and that makes that onigiri comes out perfectly warm...  mmmmmm...", "author": "Winnie W."}

Onigilly is a good option.\n\nTheir onigilly rice balls are really cute and delicious!  They're a great snack, though not the most filling.\n\nEach onigilly rice ball runs around $2.76 to $3.75, so it could be a small, cheap lunch if you only order a couple.  There are also other set meals that you can order.  I believe I usually order the snow crab onigilly.  The onigilly tastes good, but nothing mind-blowing.\n\nService is usually friendly and pretty quick.  The food is prepared in an assembly line and you can see them make your order.\n\nOne thing that I would suggest for improvement is to label the different onigilly or point out which one is which.  Perhaps when it's busy, they don't have time to do that, but it would be nice to know which one I'm eating.  It would also be nice to have a sauce bottle to add more flavor!  They have chili and salt available at the side counter where you can serve yourself, but some Japanese mayo or something would be nice.", "author": "Stephanie Z."}

The staff were really welcoming, friendly, and helpful, (which isn't always the case in FiDi), so I appreciated that. I wasn't sure what to order, so the woman taking the orders recommended a few options. \n\nI decided on the Edamame Set with 3 Onigilly: Unagi , Real Crab, and Ume. Service was quick and I loved the presentation. The food seems simple--a sushi rice sandwich with one filling wrapped in seaweed, but it was SO yummy, flavorful, and balanced. I want to go back again! (...I did learn that I'm not a fan of ume as the pickling was too strong, but that's my palette and I just wanted to give it a try.)", "author": "Lori C."}

Right across the street was Onigilly. I am a huge fan of gourmet rice balls, so I raced over to give this place a try.\n\nI must admit, I wasn't blown away by the menu. Nothing I haven't seen elsewhere, and definitely nothing innovative. These \"onigiri\" rice balls are shaped into a triangle. No, this does not qualify as \"sushi.\" Everything is made with brown rice. I'm not a fan of brown rice elsewhere, but here it's quite sweet and good. Definitely a fan of how they prepare the onigiri. Each one is made to order, so expect to wait for your food. Lots of vegan and gluten-free options, too.\n\nThe ordering system here is not fun. The little shop gets so crowded that the few seats available can't even be used. You'll likely become incredibly cramped and uncomfortable. There's no real line for ordering and picking up, so patrons just curve toward the inside of the shop and it's a struggle to walk in or out.\n\nI went with the Snow Crab for $3.45 -- simple, fresh, and with lemon aioli. Yes, this is real crab meat. For the price, it's a little high-end. In general, the rice balls will run you between $2.76 and $3.75, before taxes. However, I'd expect 2-3 to fill you up and that's not too bad for a nice lunch. I devoured my Snow Crab rice ball in seconds.\n\nHere are some other options:\n- Teriyaki Tofu\n- Renkon (Spicy Lotus Root)\n- Shiitake\n- Spicy Bacon\n- Spicy Miso Beef\n- Unagi (Eel)\n- Grilled Salmon\n- Tempura Shrimp\n\nBesides the rice rolls, they offer salads and soup. They also do small dishes like edamame and fried chicken karaage. There's even organic matcha lemonade.\n\nExpect a 3.5% mandate surcharge \"to help offset the additional regulatory costs of doing business in San Francisco.\" Yeah, yeah, yeah.", "author": "Kathy Z."}

The restaurant was small and there was little to no seating, so I immediately knew I would be taking my lunch to go. I was initially worried due to the fact that the line wrapped around inside the restaurant, but the assembly line was super fast and I was in and out the restaurant in under 10 minutes. \n\nThe matcha lemonade was a unique and refreshing choice, and I had downed the whole thing by the time I got back to the office. I ordered the onigiri combo: three pieces (snow crab, salmon, & eel) and a side of edamame for a steal. The onigiri themselves were all delicious, but the snow crab stood out as my favorite.

I've wanted to try this place for a long time but was never able to because I hustle hard everyday and by the time I get off work this place would be closed. Thankfully we moved our office near here recently, and I was able to finally try it because I left work early today due to being sick.\n\nI was a little afraid that they would take onigiri and bastardize it, but I'm happy to report that the onigiri is very unpretentious, delicious, and a great value for money (at least by SF standards). \n\nI had the miso soup combo that comes with two onigiri, and the soup itself was pretty good, which is usually a good indicator for how the rest of the food will be. The soup wasn't too salty, but definitely give it some time to cool a bit so you can enjoy the flavours without burning your tongue.\n\nI ordered the tuna salad onigiri and the tarako onigiri. Both were nicely seasoned, relatively filling without making you feel bloated, and easy to eat on the go. The important thing to keep in mind is that this food is definitely not meant to be compared to fine dining, and for what it is (quick, tasty, convenient), it pretty much checks all the boxes.\n\nI would have loved if this place was open in the morning so I can grab an onigiri for breakfast, but sometimes dreams are meant to stay dreams.", "author": "Calvin Z."}

I used to super like the ol' Onig and even had them at my office to rave reviews all around. So, yes, I super enjoyed them in the past, and I'm sure many folks still do, and will into the future. \n\nAfter my first few orders there, each one has left me dissatisfied he past couple years when I've tried again. I took a long time to consider it before I posted it and I do so very subjectively. Got yer grain of salt?\n\nOnigilly a nice option to have around I guess. (Doesn't Bamboo Asia have similar bowls w more variety for same price/cheaper? Hmmm think so...next review). Perhaps they've gone down hill, perhaps I'm a sushi snob on a budget (duh). \n\nMy opinion: Bland, Pricey, Meh service, hipster, long lines all around the lunch rush that take around 20+ min. Then everything you ultimately buy is mostly rice or salad w smallest portion of maybe 2-4 oz (?) depending on what size/s you pick. \n\nFeels like the now typical hipster gimmick to get me to pay $13 for 3-4 oz of low-med quality fish usually drowned in sauce bc thats how it tastes good. I promised myself I'd never go again after the last time. \n\n{Interlude, interlude my little pear...'}\nI gotta keep reminding myself: this isn't Oori Triangles over near Berkeley (they're doing something amazing over there). Check out if you're ever there--on a quaint (tho a bit bougie street mostly full of mom n pop shops and the various sundry results of moms and pops doin their thing (watch out for the tiny people on scooters). Right off the Bart bicycle path under elevated BART tracks. Pretty. {'if you got that reference PLZ lmk you will blow my mind and make my day}\n\nHere comes your REWARD for reading this far!! I hope its worth it...\n\nI have DISCOVERED the super special awesome secret hack to succeeding in getting some of the quickest, best, cheapest sushi in SF if you find yourself at Onigilly NOT wanting to deal with it for whatever reason but still facing the need for sushi speed. I FEEL YOU...YO (yay! I found a non-gendered pronoun! Thanks NYC upbringing! I got my yo! :p)\n\nOk here's the deal:\nStanding in front of Onigilly? Maybe waiting in slow moving line? Turn around. Look almost directly across the street kinda next to SuperDuper Burgers to its right from where yr standing is a place w smaller black signs you may not see til ya cross the street. Its a place called Tanmatsu. \n\nTenmatsu is 3x as fast as Onigilly in&out even when the line looks long - the older lady cashier is always there during the rush and she moves like lightning but isn't impatient. She also remembers repeat customers and is sweet and kind. I thinks she's great, I really like her. \n\nAlso its cheaper if you do the math, it has all diff offerings/prices (and cheap authentic udon/ramen/etc prepared as you like it before your eyes in a couple minutes). Basically you get more fish. And I think at least 50% better quality fish than Onigilly and most pickup sushi joints in the city. And this place is pick up ONLY- you can eat in any nearby park or in front of 555 California in their public area, or wherever. \n\nAll locals in the know sell Tenmatsu out by 2/3PM each day. I see same employees each day and a super organized operation with fresh offerings being put out all morning, just made. They're all kept refrigerated or in a temp controlled heated unit. You can order a lot of things to be made immediately and its always so good. \n\nThe make-now stuff can take up to 15 min if theyre busy. You can also call and order ahead or do so through Ritual app(calling to check order went through w app is wise). \n\nTenmatsu is also locally/family owned and so AUTHENTIC! Cool philosophical and Japanese quotes cover 2 walls behind counter. You feel the soul of the place in the people, food, its good vibes. \n\nNo charge for extras like spicy sauce/extra condiments. Cheap yummy $2/3 handrolls up front! Incredible- would never go anywhere else for quick sushi with this place nearby! So if Onigilly fails, you have your solution across the street here!", "author": "Viv R."}

Once I find something I like to eat I often crave it and seek it out. And that one thing is onigiri. Been on the hunt for some good onigiri grub eventhough I can technically make them myself, the simple one anyways. So when I moved to the area I was hype to see Onigilly and had it bookmarked. \n\nRecently realize Onigilly is a few steps away from my favorite boba place, so finally decided to seek it out. I tend to prefer seafood so I'll probably never get the chicken or the pork:\n\n3. Salmon: very basic onigiri filling, though not as good as I've hoped. Sort of bland. I mean it's salmon but its not OOMPH salmon. Will pass next time. Or perhaps spicy salmon would have been a better choice: IF that was available, which it is not. Yet.\n\n2. Snow crab: damn girl now you talking my language. Shhh so good. So addicting. Taste fresh, perfectly seasoned, beautiful with every bite. Always a go to.\n\n1. SPICY SHRIMP: this. is. everything. As tasty as the snow crab, the spicy shrimp is a whole nother level of deliciousness. A must get if you're sane. Addicting, I love everything about this. Could eat it all day. \n\nGot the rice bowl with teriyaki chix, spicy bacon, and soboro for the leech but he said it was too spicy and didn't eat a whole lot. So like I said I'll probably not go for those flavor in onigiri form either. Skip skip skip\n\nAlthough the leech did enjoy his zosui chix so maybe something I'll try myself next time. \n\nOnigiri aside: THE salt and pepper seasoning (???) on the side that you can get yourself is AMAZEBOMB. \nLike ok this is how pathetic I am: I buy my onis then get like 2 thing of the salt and the pepper seasoning and then I HOARD that shjt and eat it with my onigiri at home AND I got some extra so I'll be sprinkling it all over my own rice and my own seaweed and I am obsess with it. Someone tell me if they sell this or where I can get my own giant bottle because I need to put this on all my food. Thanks!\n\nService is quick. No hassle. Its only long wait when you're waiting behind indecisive customers. Them onigiri are make quickly though and for the seafood ones I've seen them really pilling it on. I don't see any skimping vs the way other reviews tell 'em. So I'm very happy with the proportion of filling to rice. Perfect. Love it.\n\nOnly sadness is the hour is not long enough. I guess they cater to the working hours. Q.Q But I get out so late and on my off days I wake up at 3pm how am I gonna make it there in time. T.T Also close on weekends? And holidays (them mondays holidays) as well? Why hast thou forsaken me, I want my onigiriiiii", "author": "Quynh Nhu D."}

When I can't decide where to eat, there's a good chance I will end up here. Even when the line is out the door, it moves quickly because people are in and out in minutes. They are known for their seaweed wrapped \"rice balls\" which which can be purchased individually or in a set. I usually order the edamame set, which comes with 3 rice balls and a side of cold edamame.\n\nMy favorites include:\nTempura Shrimp (only available at Kearny location!)\nUnagi\nSnow Crab\nSpicy Bacon \n\nThis is an easy lunch and I like picking this up when I just want to grab something quick. I have tried the rice bowl, which comes with 3 toppings over a bed of rice but it just wasn't the same. I enjoy the rice balls significantly more, must be the seaweed!

Salmon: a little dry but the sauce and the seasoning they put on helped\n3. Soboro: was a little too strong in flavors for me \n4. Snow crab: in my opinion not as worth the price but still good\n\nOverall, this place seems like a fast and relatively cheap and healthy place to stop by for lunch.

The whole construction of the onigiri seems a little wrong to me, because I'm used to triangles of rice lovingly shaped by a mother's hand.

I grew-up eating onigiri's that my mom used to make for us.  They are a good snack or quick lunch option.  \n\nOnigilly offers a different twist, by using partially milled brown rice, versus the standard white rice my mom used to make.

I stick to the meat options and prefer the Unagi, Spicy Shrimp, Snow Crab, Teriyaki Chicken and Salmon.  \n\nIt's not a large restaurant with very limited seating.

Whenever I'm back in Asia, I would either grab them cheap but solid ones from a convenience store, or head to one of the fancier onigiri places in the food part of a large department store. They are easy to eat on the go, have tons of variety, and best of all, there is tons of rice which I can't live without!\n\nImagine my amazement when a restaurant dedicated to onigiri opened up in SF. I didn't manage to go for years due to my office being in the South Bay, but oh it has been on my list for-freakin-ever. \n\nYes, I'm going to be nitpicky even though there isn't another good substitute for this restaurant anywhere this side of the pacific.\n\nFirst, the rice. Brown rice?! It isn't sticky enough to create that nice texture, and the onigiri fall apart easily because of that. \n\nSecond, the way it's wrapped. It's more like a rice party sandwich (rice/ingredient/rice) than a proper onigiri where rice is all around everything. It's got a nice aesthetic but it's at its best a rice sandwich. \n\nThird, the fillings. I'm wayyy overjoyed to see my favourite staples like takana or tarako on the menu. It's a treat, and will be the reason why I go back again, but some of the stuff I got was way too salty. Remember the sandwich analogy? Because of that, they filled each onigiri with too much filling. The filling are loyal to the Japanese roots and quite salty - that means you really don't need that much of it! Plus the salt really masks the taste of the natural ingredients (the poor eggplant...)\n\nAnyway, I'd recommend this place if you've never had an onigiri before.

I no talk right that. No tickee, no lice ball. So solly. Why not cast us all in a WWII propaganda film raising our bayonets and shouting \"Banzai!\" Am I making too big a deal over a name? Probably not. I was just watching \"Gentleman's Agreement\", and anti-Semitism in that movie starts with a tasteless joke. Perhaps the Yellow Peril resurfaces with a single rice ball. It's onigiri, my friends...with an 'r', not an 'l'. But you want to know about the rice balls, not my balls, right?\n\nAnyway, this was once a nondescript pop-up cart that showed up at the Heart of the City Farmers' Market, and now there's a spot in that alley of shame next to the Hyatt Regency and this larger, sit-down spot on Kearny. I noticed they sell lunch sets, which I assume to be bento-like creations but not really. But it was kind of a deal, $9.95 for two rice balls and a bowl of noodle soup (photo: http://bit.ly/1lAqfot). I went for the Spicy Bacon with garlic butter and chili paste and the Soboro, the ginger-honey-braised angus beef option (photo: http://bit.ly/1gYi1VP). They are prepared Chipotle-style in rote assembly fashion, and while the ingredients lent some interesting flavors, the execution not so much.\n\nThe rice balls at least were decent albeit unmemorable lunchtime fare, but the Tofu Noodle Soup was a rather drab concoction purportedly made of all-natural ingredients including the noodles made of \"tofu-yam\" whatever that is. The miso itself was too milky for my taste, and the only ingredients I enjoyed in the broth were the shiitake mushrooms and the seaweed (photo: http://bit.ly/1sJoQQ9). The whole experience always makes me miss my mom who was a true onigiri master with more traditional fillings usually involving daikon or natto (which they do offer here).

They also look a little different from regular onigiri. I ordered the salmon and the soboro. The soboro was awesome. The way they fashioned the rice around it was like using two rice patties, then wrapped with nori. Soooo good. Plus, you can get tamagoyaki on the side, which puts a huge smile on my face. My meal of choice is essentially two giant onigiri and a tamagoyaki. The best part of it is, it's quite affordable. It's only a dollar or two more than what you'd get at a Japanese grocery store, and they make it for you when you order it, so it's fresh and not wrapped in those plastic onigiri wrappers. Man...I love onigiri. It's just such a happy-sounding food.\n\nFor me, that's an entire meal. It keeps me full but not overly stuffed, like most FiDi lunches would normally do for me.

I chose three different ones - the spicy shrimp, the snow crab, and the terriyaki tofu. Overall, I felt like everything was very \"clean\" and \"fresh\", but missing a tad bit of a taste, specifically the snowcrab. The others were okay, but I think if they drizzled some sauce on top, it would have been 100. I definitely didn't think a few of those onigillies would fill me up but it definitely did. 3 later, I was stuffed. I did see their bowl and salad which looked very appealing. But given the option of poke bowl or these snacks, I would probably pick the poke bowl. I like things with more sauce, something a little more sweet and tangy.

It is what it is. Onigilly takes the simple concept of the onigiri and offers both traditional offerings, such as the various fish, shrimp, and other staples to Japanese cuisine, as well as fusion offerings following recent food trends, such as bacon. They make no effort to hide the fact that it's a really simple concept, having been developed primarily to have a simple meal that already wasn't in the market.\n\nAnd you know what, Onigilly does it right. The image is traditional enough, yet accommodating to its environment. It wanted to deviate from all the preconceived notions of how Japanese cuisine was to be in the United States, added the niche that was missing in America given that we don't have conbini here, and pulled it off very well.\n\nFor easily under $10, you can have a filling meal, and it's a great balance of carbs and proteins.

And for the snow crab, it was overpowered with mayonnaise, which was kind of gross in my opinion. Great place to grab a quick bite though. Oh and if you like miso soup, I suggest skipping it here. I've tried it a few times in hopes I just came on a bad day for it and to my disappointment, it always tastes watered down :( \n\nWould give this place 5 if there were many more things on their menu that I like.", "author": "cadence p."}

While there is usually a line that builds up for the lunch rush, the line moves quickly. I would recommend getting there fairly early if possible as both times I have gone, they have run out of certain flavors. I love that onigilly is such a convenient size and cute shape, portable and easy to eat - great for a quick lunch or maybe even a picnic lunch.\n\nFavorite flavor so far is Spicy Bacon - but it packs a lot of flavor compared to some others so you may want to save it for last if you order several onigilly. \n\nSo far, I haven't really found the combos to be that impressive or cheaper by any significant amount. The edamame is only okay (served cold, unseasoned) and the miso soup is actually a little disappointing (ended up throwing mine away). The one flavor that I tried that I also didn't find to be impressive was the chicken teriyaki because it lacks flavor.", "author": "Josephine T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-29", "description": "The word \"onigilly\" is a play off of the word \"onigiri,\" which is a Japanese rice ball with filling inside....which makes sense because onigilly is basically an \"americanized\" version of onigiri. They have many fillings to choose from (including some vegetarian and vegan options) which are all really tasty (the only one I do not recommend is the salmon because it is quite bland and costs a bit more than the other fillings). The sets are nice too but I usually just get the onigilly because I'm not a very big fan of their edamame or soup. \n\nKeep in mind that this is a very small place and they make your onigilly to order so it's best to come before/after lunch hours if you can.", "author": "Anna H."}

Also, there's no need for soy sauce, as the rice ball as a whole is already pretty flavorful depending on the filling.\n\nSize: The portions are small, and perfect for a light meal. They have a 3 rice ball combo for a little over $8, and a 2 rice ball combo with miso soup for around $6, give or take. Take advantage of these combos because you get your money's worth, as each rice ball can range from $2 something to $3 something, depending on the filling.\n\nService: Great, friendly service! The cashier was helpful and patient with my indecisiveness. \n\nThis was my first time here, and I loved the ones I tried: unagi, chicken teriyaki, and shiitake.

With so many potential combinations of fillings to stuff into triangular seaweed-wrapped rice balls (or a noodle salad or a rice plate or a bowl of noodle soup), we were honestly paralyzed by the decision in the beginning. Thankfully we came slightly after lunchtime so we weren't holding up the line. \n\nIn the end, we both decided on a preset lunch suggestion. \"Try set C!\" they said and so we did - the seafood classic (noodle salad). Overall I enjoyed the flavors but found several ingredients to be extraneous. The hijiki and the pickles provide a nice counterpoint to the tuna salad and spicy shrimp and when combined with the greens and light dressing, worked very well together. I just found the noodles and the plain onigilly to be out of place in the dish - total afterthought. \n\nNot a bad stop for lunch but Kearny is a competitive street for lunchtime FiDi eats.

It's a great concept for sure, one that brings the goodness of ethnic cuisines into the hands of office-goers who are looking to grab a quick lunch. I'm glad that Onigilly has applied that concept to Japanese food. \n\nThe crowd favorite seems to be Onigiri (indeed, most of my friends ordered that) - Japanese rice-balls sandwiching a filling of your choice wrapped in seaweed and presented in a cute triangular form. The standard Onigiri fare comes with three such rice-balls. \n\nI went with their rice bowl instead, which is basically a lot of rice (and I mean A LOT!) and an assorted selection of veggies and tofu, and some greens stuffed in the gaps. Unlike the Onigiri's presentation, the rice bowl's presentation wasn't anywhere near as cute, but probably a lot more filling. They have about 6 different options for vegetarian sides/filling, but most of them are variants of Tofu, Mushroom and Seaweed. My 3-star rating of this business might not be fully representative because it comes from a vegetarian who dislikes seaweed.

I have one near my office and discovered this restaurant in the Embarcadero location. I've got to say, this location is the best out of all the of them! \n\nTo be completely honest, this was the only place where they made their rice in a way that it wasn't a soft mooshy mess. Other branches would always make their rice soggy, but this location, it wasn't super hard nor was is super soft. It was perfect. It reminded me of eating onigiris in Japan (which are always fresh at the local 7-11). Now, for these branches, even though the rice is perfecto, I have to gripe about the seaweed. I think I was just spoiled in Japan (duh) but the seaweed is chewy. Now, at this location, it isn't as chewy as others but still, it's not fresh. I just wish they found a way to open those packets of seaweeds and just keep it fresh. Maybe use a green bag? Who knows.

Pronounced oh-NEE-ghee-lee, similar to Gilly on Game of Thrones with a hard \"G\", as opposed to a soft \"G\" which would sound like \"Jill-y\". Rice balls for days son. Heirloom Kokuho Rose organic, partially milled brown rice from Koda Farms, packing heat with the variety from soboro ginger-honey braised ground beef to tarako baked pollock roe aioli spread. Reasonably priced at around $3 each, variety is the spice of life, threesome every time my man. Just a personal preference, my favorites are tarako, snow crab, and unagi. I strongly suggest trying out all them selections as they are all rather different in flavors and texture. \n\nLunch time hustling, in the street of FiDi. An occasional who comes upon the man may wonder idly who he was, but seldom pursues this curiosity beyond a casual question. This man as many had accustomed to behind the counter is the cashier, a bandana tied firmly to his forehead during lunch hours, channeling the same ferocity as mythical momotaro riding into battle. In the busiest of hour, in the diversity of downtown, it's not that hard to spot him. One might even notice him with xenophobic eyes, as the only white guy working the line. The white guy with glasses? More than that, he notices your confusion as you stare at the blackboard, every single order, his service unwavering and never falter. His mouth steadfast with suggestions, yet tone soft with resolution. His gestures animated, yet controlled like an artisan that mastered his craft. Keith Haring in the flesh. One might question the validity of being a cashier as an art form, as similarly stances have been taken in regards to performance art, rest assure he doesn't do it for the fame, the limelight, the pay, merely a person with character playing a character.  However trivial, there is no debate about the significant an extraordinary cashier brings to the table on a daily basis for a business. \n\nThere are four different Onigilly locations, he is the reason I frequent this one. With all that said, it is with great sadness that I must say in my last two visits he has not been seen. I can only assume the worst and hope he found his true calling in life and that he has moved on to better things instead of dealing with the hoi polloi.", "author": "Roy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-03", "description": "A pretty decent rendition of Japanese onigiri. \n\nI LOVE onigiri (Japanese rice balls), and so when I heard about Onigilly, a restaurant entirely devoted to them, I couldn't wait to try it out! Unfortunately this place is very popular with the lunchtime crowd, and I got stuck in the middle of it. After waiting 10 minutes or so I finally placed my order: the wakame set with the renkon and snow crab onigiri. I also ordered a green tea lemonade to drink while I waited, which was another 5 minutes or so. \n\nInside is quite small but it's okay because most people take their food to go. I liked how they served free mugicha (barley tea) and green tea to customers. While I waited for my food I drank some of my green tea lemonade, and I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. The first sip was far too sweet but it sort of grows on you after awhile. Even so I probably wouldn't order it again. As I watched them make the rice balls I noticed they weren't using the traditional method for onigiri: getting a ball of rice in one hand, placing the filling in the center and covering the filling with a bit more rice. Instead they had a triangle of pre-formed rice, stuck the filling on top, then added another triangle-shaped rice on top of that. Kind of like a rice sandwich? Weird. \n\nBut I guess the aforementioned technique allows you to stuff more filling inside which is good for the customer. The renkon (lotus root) was pretty good, not too salty, a bit spicy, and it had the right amount of crunch. The snow crab was light and delicate tasting, but there was too much mayo inside.

However, I just felt like the flavor lacked a bit for me. \n\n- Salmon - This was one of the first onigiri's I got and I hadn't read the description thoroughly and assumed I was going to get raw salmon. I'm not a huge fan of cooked salmon but my coworkers have also mentioned they felt this one lacked a bit of flavor.\n\n- Miso Tuna Salad - Decent but nothing really memorable.Tastes just how it sounds. \n\n- Spicy Bacon - Pretty good but on the heavy/salty side so I don't typically order this often. \n\n- Snow Crab - Light but, if you like crab, this one is nice and subtle. Yay for real crab meat! (none of that imitation stuff!) \n\n- Spicy Shrimp - For a while this was my favorite - it's got great flavor and is a bit spicy but not in an overwhelming way. I've introduced Onigilly to a few friends (without telling them my preferences) and all of them have stated that this one was the standout. \n\n- Tarako - The new favorite. If you don't like fish roe you might not like this. What I love about this one is the unique flavor. It is on the saltier side but the rice balances it out. \n\nOther Pros - \n\n** Nice and clean\n** Super friendly staff\n** They use brown rice so you can feel like you're eating healthy! \n** Pretty decent lunch deals (esp for the FiDi area).

I got the Soup and two onigilly lunch special for $9.95, which ended up coming to $12.00.  Now I do understand that not all toppings are created equally but the good options you have without being upcharged are slim so expect to add an extra dollar or two to your order for anything you buy here.  \n\nI got the Salmon Skin and Miso Salmon Onigillys and both were average at best.  The salmon skin was not rich and fatty but instead flaky and dry and the Miso Salmon was an itty bitty piece of fish that was also dry.  I asked for a little container of hot sauce and was told that will be an extra charge.  Also, they advertise the lunch with edamame and kimchi and I got four pieces of edamame and the blandest cabbage (not kimchi) that I have ever had. The soup I got was also super bland and in desperate need of hot sauce and soy sauce, so I'm really glad I got it togo.  I doctored it with siracha and soy sauce back at my office and all was right in the world again!\n\nOnigilly loses a star today for nickle and diming my lunch to a bland, tasteless death!

Everything ruled!!! The server made a goof and thought we ordered mahi mahi. We didn't, but ate it anyways and it was awesome too. Our server endlessly refilled our glasses with sake sangria to make up for it, so no complaints at all!\n\nI had no idea the place closed at 8pm which seems a bit early for Friday.

I recently went to Japan and have been missing their onigiri that I find in convenience stores and better yet the little store kiosks in their food court with gourmet onigiri. When I found out about this shop called onigilly, I was skeptical at first because it's not even spelled right :O and then i saw pictures where it's not wrapped all inside the rice.. I was like is this legit? And it's brown rice compared to the japanese sushi rice. Anywho, I was in the neighborhood one morning and decided to try some Onigilly! I ordered a variety of flavors to take to go and share with my mom. I got miso tuna, snow crab, spicy shrimp, sapporo beef (my apologies if i got this wrong), and the salmon. I ordered 6, and the gentleman who rang me up was nice enough to give me a buy a certain amount and get one free stamp card and punched it twice since i ordered two sets. YAY!! :) I couldn't wait to go home and eat this, when i got back, i dropped everything and sat down to enjoy these babies. The brown rice WAS NOT BAD AT ALL, it tasted just like sushi rice, i would've been fooled if they didnt advertised the healthiness of it. CHECK, and the taste was good too. My favorites are the snow crab and spicy shrimp! It has many decent size baby shrimps in there, NOM!!! :) As for tuna, I will stick to the japan ones. The tuna and salmon didn't do much for me, or maybe i had too high of a expectation. All in all, i would definitely come back, as this is the closest I can get to Japan for now.

Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised. With an extensive menu, it's nice to find some classics such as Takowasa, tempura, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and random dishes (that's what makes izakaya fun). While the okonomiyaki was small, it was packed with red cabbage and tasty. I really enjoyed the shishito tempura and even the basic miso soup (packed with veggies). \n\nPerhaps the classics were even more heightened with the presentation. Despite the small table space, the plating was well thought out. \n\nThe sake selection is bleh, but they do have Coedo beer and Asahi (all bottles, no draft). \n\nThe onigiri are at a happy hour price and are filling.

I love onigiri, so was very intrigued by the concept of a place that specialized in it. \n\nIt looks like Onigilly caters to the Downtown lunch crowd -- at 1pm, there was still a long line up going out the door. I waited about 40 minutes from the time I got in line until I got my takeout order. The wait was a bit of a bummer, but was worth it to try something new.\n\nI was impressed by the amount of choice they brought into their onigiri fillings -- I tried bacon, salmon skin (special of the day), miso salmon (special of the day), sukiyaki beef (special of the day), terriyaki chicken, and prawn poke (special of the day). On the appearance side of things, their rendition of the onigiri is a little different from the traditional way they are done. Traditionally, onigiri fillings are inside the rice triangle, with seaweed wrapped all around the outside. Onigilly's onigiri are topped with the fillings you choose and the seaweed is wrapped around the rice triangle and topping to keep everything together -- sort of like a paper bag holding your groceries. \n\nAs for taste, the toppings were good, but not necessarily super amazing. Again, I like the different concepts for toppings they have, so the variety makes it special. The rice was a little hard and cold -- I like my onigiri with warm sticky rice :)\n\nOverall, a great concept and I did enjoy the food. Price wasn't too bad either -- it worked out to be $22 for all 6 of my onigiri choices.

You can grab a much better onigiri at Super Mira for a little over a dollar any day of the week, and they've been sitting out all day long. Unfortunately, I don't work anywhere near Super Mira, so that's just not an option.\n\nWhat do they do wrong? Well, their rice is neither cooked nor prepared very well, the extremely thick nori isn't toasted, so it basically turns to leather when it starts absorbing moisture, their interpretation of tsukemono seems to involve simply sprinkling salt on fresh celery, and nobody but small women and children will feel they've gotten enough food in exchange for their $10 when they're done eating. I also can't figure out why the dude who usually works the register--who actually does appear to be Japanese--insists on mispronouncing everything on the menu. Maybe they say \"nay-do\" instead of \"natto\" in Okinawa or something. I dunno.\n\nBut the meats are pretty good, as is the natto, however they choose to pronounce it.

There specialty is rice balls which is a ball of rice, with some other toppings, but not too much, in a seaweed wrap. It is Japanese but even there the ones I had were generally pre-packaged and not the delightfully fresh rice ball experience provided at Onigilly.\n\nThe fact that the group who started this restaurant started out running a food truck probably explains why things are so streamlined.You pick the initial layout (rice ball, rice bowl, noodles) and then you pick the three standardized toppings (I had number four, chicken, then eggplant, and spicy shrimp) and you pay, I assume cash only which is what I paid, and then you either get take-out, or if there is a table, and I was lucky to find one, you can eat-in. The three rice balls came with a wonderful side salad and as I had water i think the whole meal was around $10....\n\nIs it worth it? Well, let's just say, with all these food options around here, when my friend comes in today to join my frugal vacation experience, I'm taking her to Onigilly for lunch, besides, you fill out the survey and when you come back you get $2 off - I did say it was a frugal vacation, didn't I? :-)", "author": "George L."}

The line was pretty short, so I took the chance and waited my turn.  The ordering part is a bit confusing, as others have said, but since you will have at least 5 minutes before your order is taken, you'll have plenty of time to chose what you want.  What I found a little difficult about ordering is the weird handwriting of the person who wrote out the menu.  It's a bit hard to read.\n\nAfter a short wait, I placed my order for the 3 onigilly/salad combo and chose the seafood combo.  It was ready in a minute or two.  I bit right into one of those little packages and it was delicious!  The Nori wasn't hard or soggy yet (as others have complained) and the rice was delicious.  The toppings included miso tuna salad, shrimp and hijiki.  Of the three, I liked the miso tuna salad best.  The side salad was a nice size - just what you need - and I enjoyed the edamame that they threw in, but they need to hold the salt on the edamame - wow, sodium overload!\n\nOnigilly will definitely be on the rotation, but probably just every once in a while since I try to stay away from carbs, and the onigiri are in truth, mostly rice.  Delicious, but again, mostly rice.", "author": ".Hon H."}

Both of us were glad he did.\n\nI had the teriyaki chicken one, which was moist and delicious. I had the eggplant one, which was probably my favorite. And I had the tempura shrimp one, which was good, but probably my least favorite of the three (I would still eat it again though). The seaweed salad was the best I ever had. The little side salad that comes on the plate is delicious, with a spicy dressing and mixed greens. The chicken is organic. They serve Frog Hollow peaches. Seriously?

They went from truck to brick & mortar and are clearly doing all they can to smooth out any starter wrinkles. (2) I love the concept. Choose your own adventure. So many variations means it won't get old too fast (3) I love the ingredients. With a few exceptions the quality of all I've tried has been pretty top notch and it's my favorite flavors all under one roof, and...(4) I love the attention to detail.  Namely, the sides, which aren't just an afterthought. Well cooked edamame & fresh salad & seaweed sprinkles. Excellent touches. \n\nfavorite selection: the rice bowl. This is your winner if you're worried about leaving hungry. It's really tasty and satisfying. Especially if you're not afraid of togarashi seasoning. \n\nMy least fave selection: oddly enough, the onigily. I love the idea but there's too much rice for my taste, not enough sauce.  Granted, I am a condiment fiend. \n\nFavorite sides: tofu, renkon, eggplant, and salmon (salty and not a generous helping but delish) \n\nLeast fave sides: I didn't love the crab or shrimp. It didn't have the level of freshness I like. But I haven't tried it since week one so it's possible it has improved. \n\nAlso... It's a little confusing. Until you're a seasoned customer, and the other customers are also more practiced, it might take awhile to get thru the line.

I had three of them: lotus root, hijiki and garlic beet greens. They were all quite good, but the lotus root was particularly delicious. They use a lightly polished brown rice so it isn't as sticky as a short-grain white rice would be, but personally, I find brown rice to have a lot more flavor and a more healthy option.\n\nThe seaweed was wrapped a little funny because the onigiri aren't stuffed, but rather the toppings are placed on top so they have to do a full wrap of seaweed and it isn't as tight around the triangles as it could be otherwise.\n\nAs with all onigiri, the longer you wait to eat them, the softer the nori wrapper will be, so eat there or take it to go depending on what you like.\n\nI'm not sure why people complain about the price.

I go multiple times a week because I can't think of anything else I'd rather have for lunch. I usually go to their Onigilly Express location because it's closer to my office, but I favor this one much more. \n\nA quick rundown of their food: Onigiri's are rice balls and a filling of your choice all wrapped in seaweed. They're supposed to be like a little triangular, on-the-go rice sandwich that you can eat with your hands. At first, I was skeptical that the food in the restaurant could constitute a meal, but I was pleasantly surprised by what they had to offer!\n\nOne of the main draws of this location as opposed to the other one is that it's much larger and there's seating inside. As well, I really enjoy the complimentary Japanese tea they have. Each time I've visited, the staff have also gone above and beyond to provide great service. If it's your first time there, feel free to ask about their menu options (the staff will be more than happy to explain) because it can get overwhelming once you go in.\n\nNow for the fillings. In the last few times I've been there, I've managed to sample a wide selection of their options:\n\n-Spicy shrimp - My favorite! The flavors aren't too spicy or overpowering, and the shrimp is tender and juicy. I love the aioli they marinade it with.\n-Miso tuna salad - I love this one as well. There isn't much of a miso taste to it, but I still really liked the flavor. \n-Snow crab - Seems to be a very popular option. Personally, I thought they added too much aioli and it made me feel sick after. However, its popularity makes me want to give it another try because most people seem to really enjoy it.\n-Salmon - Very yummy and light. This one doesn't have a heavy marinade unlike a lot of other fillings, so I would really recommend it if that's what you're looking for.\n-Soboro - Another favorite for a lot of people. The meat tasted very tender and moist.\n-Spicy bacon - I actually preferred this one to the soboro. However, it tastes very \"meaty\" and a lot of the rice was also marinaded in the chili, so don't get it if you aren't a fan of that salty taste. \n\nAlthough I love the concept and the flavors, I have to knock a star off for the pricing. They have a set deal that is 3 onigiri's + edamame + pickles for $10. I usually only get two onigiri's because I just want a light lunch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-10-05", "description": "One of the more popular/convenient lunch spots near financial district.\n\nI would say, if you never had rice balls (onigiri) before, you should try this place.  Otherwise...  \n\nI think this is a one-time deal for me.   The price is average for what's around the area (except for Chinatown), but if you think about what you're getting... then it's definitely not worth the money.  \n\nOnigiri = a couple pieces of meat/veggie/fish with a huge chunk of rice wrapped in seaweed.  \n\nI tried the miso tuna, the chasu, and the pork belly.  The miso tuna was the best because it was flavorful and non-solid enough that you can kinda mix it with the rice when you eat it.  The chasu and pork belly, on the other hand, not so much.  They're very separated from the rice and just did not go well together.  I couldn't even tell the two apart, even though the pork belly was more expensive. \n\nIf you order the combo, you also get pickled cabbage and a salad.  Salad dressing is good but ti's probably VERY fattening.  \n\nI tried the green tea lemonade.  It tastes exactly as it sounds: a green tea lemonade.  It was very refreshing, but ... probably won't bring me back.", "author": "Emily W."}

Menu line up is very good, authentic Japanese + twist, the miso soup was delicious.  But disappointed in the way the rice balls are made.  They just make triangle shape rice, put the ingredient/topping in the middle and cover with another triangle shape rice, almost like a sandwich. The whole point of rice ball (onigiri) is you squeeze and make a ball (or triangle) shape. The pressure you squeeze the rice is very important to make a tasty rice ball. Other than the way the rice balls are made, the topping tasted good. I'd like other menu (like soup) but will probably not get rice balls any more. It was too disappointing.....", "author": "May S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-27", "description": "Rearry?  \n\nI did a double take as I cabbed past this spot that makes a soft pretty play on the Japanese word \"onigiri\" or rice ball on the way to the Bentley Reserve this morning and had to give them a whirl.  I took my new friends that I met at our sake certification course for a quick lunch.  I had my heart set on this place as I thought the concept was out of this world and so brilliant.  We got there and there was a line out the door and I immediately told my buddies that we could go somewhere else but Onigilly piqued their interest too.  The line went quickly and I was served before I sat down, no joke!   They have a very efficient way of running things or making onigiri to be specific and I was thoroughly impressed. \n\nJust when it was my turn to order, I was going to whip out the G-card and be that annoying person, \"What do you have that is gluten-free?\"  but luckily I didn't have too.  The pretty brunette in front of me who had the same purse as me ordered gluten free and I felt so relieved.  I'm severely allergic so I had to ask about the pickles and salad dressing that came with the lunch special (I ordered the 3 onigiri combo) and I had nothing to worry about.  So happy to hear that they had made a fresh vegetarian (actually vegan) vinaigrette that was simple, refreshing and tasty.  The pickles were simple and cabbage soaked in salt with a hint of fresh grated ginger... very traditional Japanese.  I couldn't have been happier.\n\nI get my plate, I snap a pic (I always do, I know it's annoying but someone's got to do it) and I smiled when I saw their style of onigiri wrap, it was like  the  Diane von Furstenberg of onigiris.  It reminded me of her famous wrap dresses - classy,clean cut with a nice deep v-neck cut that shows just enough but not enough for your boobs to pop out.  I ordered the  Wild White Tuna (Albacore) Aioli, Tarako and Bacon w/Spicy Sauce which all stuck out near the top end of the onigiri, adorable.  Although they weren't marked GF on the menu I had a pretty good inkling that the last two were gluten free friendly as well and they confirmed the good news.   The owner went out of his way to check the label of a sauce for one of my other allergies and I was in shock.   The rice had a light brown tint and I knew immediately it was a brown rice strain which is packed with nutrients well more than the naked white over milled short grain rice that we are used to.  The salad didn't have a leaf of our watery friend iceberg but a nice portion of mixed greens and there were even a few pods of edamame with a hint of sea salt.\n\nBesides the fact that their food is tasty, well prepared, affordable , I'm quite impressed that they are helping introduce a popular Japanese snack that has been around for hundreds of years in Japan to mainstream America... the financial district in San Francisco is an amazing place to start this food revolution!  Nice work Onigilly!", "author": "Shiho F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-14", "description": "I have walked by this place several times, and had wanted to try. The restaurant (more like a cafe, as seating is rather limited) serves 'onigiri' (odd play on the r/l confusion in the name), which means rice ball. This is very humble comfort food--the stuff that my mother and grandmother would make as a casual snack or light meal. It is also what volunteers prepared and served to the countless victims of the 3/11 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Yes, very humble stuff. Maybe like what sandwiches are in the US? And no, this is NOT sushi (as the restaurant spells out on their menu board). The food preparers were speaking Japanese and appeared Asian, so I assumed this is a Japanese run/owned place? (with a name like Onigilly, I would think so, but maybe that doesn't matter). Anyway, the fillings list is what convinced me to try, because they were, for the most part, my childhood comfort foods. I usually either make these myself or grab them at local Japanese markets, but it is nice to eat them freshly made and warm. Plus, how hard can it be to mess up rice balls? Well, first the positives. The ingredients are high quality. They make it a point to tell people that they use koshihikari rice (high quality Japanese rice), they toast the nori (so no chewy stuff such what one might find at places that do not know that the details count when it comes to Japanese food preparation) and the fillings that I tried were delicious (tarako or cod roe, kani or crab, takana or seasoned vegetables--all standard Japanese fare). But when I got my order, I noticed that the onigiri was actually more like a rice sandwich. They took the expensive rice and prepared what looked like dried out rice slices--as though they formed the rice into a triangular solid, then sliced it into convenient pieces--sliced?? The filling was put in between two of those rice slices, then everything was wrapped in nori. To me, it looked more like a rice sandwich than onigiri. The whole point behind onigiri is that the rice is shaped by hands which are salted, so that the salt is transferred to the rice and gives it a nice flavor. The hand shaping also helps to keep the rice together, so the onigiri maintains its shape. What I got was unsalted flavorless rice that was on the dry side. When I bit into the onigiri, the rice all fell apart. Tasty, but they sure cut a lot of corners putting everything together. It was also expensive! Usually, one onigiri costs about a dollar at Japanese convenience stores, and maybe no more than two dollars at a very casual eatery. The ones I ordered were upwards of $3 each! Wow!! I also order a set, which included some crisp but under salted edamame and 3 slices of takuan (very basic yellow daikon pickles). I think the set cost maybe another 1-2 dollars extra on top of the cost of the onigiri. Not really worth it, since these items are usually complimentary, and there was nothing really exceptional about these condiments/sides.", "author": "\u548c\u5b50"}

After attempting to figure out a somewhat confusing menu, (Think Chipotle-ish where you pick out a style, then your toppings, except we've got some crazy toppings, no pulled pork here!) My friend tried the Onigilly set, like super-sized sushi rolls and tried 3 specials off the menu, loved every one of them! I went with the Meat Lovers Rice bowl and it was fantastic!  Great flavors, all sustainable, and the staff was very nice and food came out 30 seconds or so after ordering, absolute phenomenal!  Try the Amazake!", "author": "Will H."}

It seems they are only open a few hours during lunch anyways so I assume their target customers are professionals in the area looking for a good alternative to sandwiches and salads for lunch.

I went there at 1:30p and there was still a short line. The wait wasn't long, though, and the stuffs they are making aren't that complicated. Now on to the food. The short version of this is, they are simply simple handroll in three-dimensional triangles. What you have are the rice, seaweed, and whatever thing you picked for it.  Their salad was fresh but didn't like the fact that they tossed the edamame right by the side so you will have to carefully take them away before consuming the salad. Also, they placed the \"rice balls\" so close to the salad that some of the dressing got on to the them. It's certainly something to try but I won't be going back there unless I really want a light lunch after a heavy breakfast.", "author": "Picky E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-11", "description": "I've always liked the cart -- just well-made food with great local ingredients, at least all the vegan options I've tried, so was happy to see this new location in prime FiDi lunching territory.  Glad to say the food quality still holds up, so I don't think the restaurant will have to worry about holding its own amongst all the other establishments here.\n\nI had what I think is one of Onigilly's most unique and compelling options, which you probably won't find anywhere else.  This is the salad with tofu noodles (which comes with one \"plain\" onigilly rice ball).\n\nI'm pretty sure the \"tofu noodles\" are tofu shirataki noodles, which a special high-protein noodle that doesn't have a ton of flavor, but a nice texture, and will please those who like Onigilly's offerings but are trying to go a little more low carb.\n\nAll in all this vegan is still pleased and will probably be back for lunch.  Only improvement I can think of for the salad option would be if you could upgrade the plain onigilly for one with filling, for an extra dollar or so.  The flavored fillings (which come as toppings on the salad, and all the vegan ones are great) are the real star at this place.  The menu might seem confusing at first, but just remember that you get to pick three flavors no matter what you get (and the menu is very helpful in identifying vegan and gluten-free choices).\n\nThe servings are pretty large here.  Two friends had two Onigilly balls instead of one of the lunch sets, and seemed satisfied.  Everyone I've talked to love the veggie options, with less enthusiasm for the chicken.", "author": "Tamara F."}
