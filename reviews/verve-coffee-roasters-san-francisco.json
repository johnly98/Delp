My boyfriend and I stopped here one morning during our visit to SF to fuel up for the day. I ordered a latte and a piece of quiche, and he got a pour over and the daily toast, which had ricotta and plenty of greens. The guy at the counter was super friendly, helpful, and patient, which was\u00a0refreshing as I find sometimes the customer service at places like this can be lacking. \n\nThe pour over came with a little card that includes the variety's flavor profile notes, cup characteristics, producer, region, process, and cultivar. I'm not a coffee snob by any means but I still thought this was cool. The latte was your typical latte, creamy and delicious. My personal favorite part of our visit was the quiche. When I ordered, I was informed that the slices are served at room temp and asked if that was okay, which I really appreciated. The quiche was so intensely creamy and rich that it almost felt more like a dessert, which sounds weird but it was packed with flavor from the salty bacon and so decadent. Definitely not an every day option for me but a nice vacation treat. The daily toast was just okay, not a whole lot of flavor and I thought it could have used more seasoning. Overall I enjoyed our stop at Verve and would go back in the future, or if I lived nearby.", "author": "Katy C."}

Love the pop of color. Simple and effective. The counter is long and gives the coffee a front-and-center placement. Not a crazy amount of seating but does include a small communal table and benches and low tables, allowing the coffee culture to shine. It's really a unique space.\n\nI went for a Gibraltar, which is espresso plus a splash of warm milk. (It's like a mini latte!) A bit pricey but definitely satisfying and delicious. The barista offered to add more milk orvchange the temperature of milk if we wanted. Not sure how he would have done the latter, but he obviously cares a about a customized cup.\n\nThere is a small but ample selection of sweet and savory carby foods. The open-face sandwiches, in particular, looked very pretty and tasty.", "author": "Jess L."}

Most of their cafes are in Santa Cruz, where co-founders Ryan O'Donovan and Colby Barr base their operations, and Tokyo of all places, where I think I saw one of their cafes in Shinjuku. In other words, they may be Blue Bottling toward Starbucks territory but there was no evidence of racial profiling yet at the Castro location. Just more of a preference for them to serve the local hipster populace from what I could tell from their droning chatter.\n\nI suppose I should have gone for one of their coffee specialties since they appeared to have all the shiny hardware necessary to prepare them (photo: http://bit.ly/2JkpKSO). However, I was in the mood for tea on a blustery day when I was a bit on the forlorn side. I went for a $4 cup of their Rooibos which was advertised as having elements of caramel and nectar and being 'bodied' whatever that means. I waited patiently for the barista to prepare it from a jar of loose leaves, and the result was smooth and, well, 'bodied' (photo: http://bit.ly/2Hl167X). There is seating in here, but good luck with that as the laptoppers lay siege to the space. In response, I was off on my merry way.\n\nTEA - 4 stars...a particularly smooth Rooibos can be sipped here\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...ah, to be young and self-entitled\nSERVICE - 3 stars...tersely pleasant\nTOTAL - 4 stars...probably helps to express some nerve at Verve", "author": "Ed U."}

Isn't coffee typically a beverage consumed in the morning? There are a lot of people out in the world at that time. [/rant])\n\nThankfully Verve decided to differentiate a bit with a 6am open time. \n\nAesthetics are great but be warned - first time visit is probably going to require some Yelp research or a bit of conversation with the staff. They have a slightly hard to decode drink menu, featuring several house specialty beverages requiring inquiry. The food menu requires discovery at the counter (but they do serve fresh food which is a plus) and the pastries in the display case are neither labeled nor visibly priced. \n\nThese usability issues aside, the food and drink here is really good! Mocha at Four Barrel still takes my vote for best in SF (it's that ground up Dandelion chocolate), but this one is probably the next best around. The whipped cream topping is both beautiful and tasty. \n\nSeveral other reviewers have mentioned the Manresa pastries. It's surprising they chose to import baked goods with Thoroughbread just doors down but if you want the taste of a Michelin rated Los Gatos restaurant brand without having to actually go there, this is one way to do it. Kouign amann (served in slices rather than individually) is competitive with the B Patisserie in taste and texture; also has the clear advantage of being way less messy to eat. The monkey bread is on the crunchier side but I like it better this way than mostly tasting like a cinnamon roll. Both are worth ordering at least once, but know in doing it, you're signing yourself up for a $5 snack. \n\nSeating is a bit like hanging out a friends house - there's a dining room table like space and several bench like couches oriented around coffee tables.

The bathroom is spacious and usually clean. There is wifi if anyone is interested in that. Seating is a bit hard, but there are areas where you can stand and enjoy your drink.

Their drip coffee is $4 (!!) and is worse imho than a $1.95 Starbucks drip. Given the number of quality cups you can get for cheaper in SF at Sightglass, Fourbarrel, Blue Bottle, Ritual, Revielle, etc. this aspect is really disappointing for me. They also don't have prices listed for their pastries and their breakfast menu starts at $7, so I'm concerned to ask. The location is great and the place is brand new, but they must be trying to pay their lease off early with the sky high prices.", "author": "Polina S."}

Although the quality of their beverages are still on point, their service could use some work. I recently went into verve and ordered  a dozen pastries and a 96oz coffee container. While placing the order, the barista appeared to be annoyed, and made me feel like I was being an inconvenience to him. He wasn't helpful when needing to select pastries, and when ordering the coffee container, he and another coworker told me I would have to wait 30mins to prep the coffee (as if to keep me from ordering it). Overall I felt like my order was a burden, and now feel like this won't be a good option when ordering for a group function.  Hope the service gets better, the longer they are open.", "author": "Celeste A."}

I came downstairs this morning to find that February 13, 2017 was Christmas morning!  After a long two-year wait, Verve has finally opened at Church and Market.  I welcome them with open arms as Church/Market has kinda gone downhill since the opening of Twitter at Market/10th pushed all the homeless folks upstream to camp on literally all four corners of our intersection.  Well, with Home restaurant torn down last week, and Verve opening today, I am honestly excited about a little revitalization around here.  Verve's build-out of the former Veo eyewear space is beautifully done, this place looks fantastic.  Verve had only been open for three hours when I visited but obviously had already become a magnet attracting rich late-twentysomethings.  The atmosphere was lively and upbeat, folks sure seem excited about Verve as an addition to the neighborhood.  Since I am basically 100 years old (43), I was the oldest customer in there by far.  I had a $4 ice coffee, plus an $8 poached egg biscuit that was basically tasteless, but beautiful.  There were some minor operational bumps with my ordering process and the wait felt a little long, but nothing that I expect won't be ironed out after they've been open a few days/weeks.  Most of the seating was full and there were probably ten people standing, waiting for orders when I arrived around 9:20AM.  But the standing folks cleared out after just a few minutes.   Staff seemed very friendly and were all smiles.  Not really being a coffeehouse person in general I will probably never go here again as I don't like feeling old and poor, but I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say I'm thrilled to have them in the neighborhood.", "author": "Dave M."}

I just didn't want coffee at 3pm but I love coffee and am a potential customer. But more to the point, what if I had IBS? What if I was homeless? What if I was a lost tourist? This really overpriced coffee shop (which I love usually) moves into a gentrifying neighborhood with really sterile impersonal graphic design, and refuses to give bathroom access to its neighbors.

Verve is widely known in national coffee circles for their sourcing, quality, attention to detail, showmanship, and top notch baristas. They also do everything with a great sense of style and offer friendly and knowledgeable service. The bean quality is top notch, as is the equipment with which the coffee e is produced. While I enjoy other great quality coffee in town like Ritual, Four Barrel, Equator, Lieana, Blue Bottle, etc, Verve has just upped the game a solid notch with fantastic coffee, service, style, and food. Note that I had the Green Tip Gesha and yes it IS certainly a splurge at $12, unlike some other high $ pour-over/siphon experiences I have had at some other places, this one was indeed truly unique and worth it in my opinion.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-24", "description": "3.5 stars\n\nA Santa Cruz import.  The cafe is thoughtfully designed with a modern, airy, beachy vibe.  A little light on the seating options/availability.  I sat on one of the padded benches and was surprised there weren't any outlets around to plug my laptop into - so that foiled my work plan.  Also surprising was how dirty the two coffee tables were.  There were at least 20-30 coffee rings on them that could have been remedied with a quick wipe.\n\nSo what about the coffee?  My go-to litmus test when trying out a new cafe is to order a mocha.  A bit of sticker shock when the tab came to just under $6.  But whatever, figured I'd give it a try.  The wait time was rather extended, considering I was the only one in line.  After at least 5 minutes, the barista finally slid a drink onto the counter, but told me it wasn't mine.  It was for someone sitting down.  Oh ok, so service is a little slow.  It's new.  I can cut them some slack.  So I waited awhile more.  Then the next drink came up.  Also not for me - for another seated patron.  So I waited some more, thinking wow, they're really taking this coffee-crafting thing seriously.  Finally!  After prob 10-12 min total, I had my mocha.  \n\nSettled into my seat, took a sip.  Texture-wise, it was prob the best I've ever had (and I've not really ever thought about the textures of my mochas before) -- smooth, creamy, silky.  Very nice.  Chocolate flavor was a bit mild - I prefer more of a bittersweet flavor (like at Peet's).  Not very hot (which actually worked for me, but prob not for most ppl).  Overall, a solid, enjoyable mocha.  \n\nI won't rush back as there isn't enough seating & no outlets.  And it's $$$.  But if I was in the area & in need of a special treat, I'd venture in again and give it another try.", "author": "Jason P."}

Definitely none of the fig called out in the tasting notes. The food seems crazy expensive, $7.50 for a small cup of oats with a fan of apple on top. I dare you to eat that with a spoon. \nThe streetlevel espresso tasted like all the other trendy SF coffee shops - thin and sour and boring. \nIt has a nice layout, but the uninspired styling inside feels like Starbucks meets McDonald's. The staff was over the top faux-sincere with their \"toootally\" and \"awesome\" lattes, typical verve friendliness. They really pumped out some drinks, though, so I gotta say they are fast. A little bummed to see who I presume was the manager pacing and phone checking and computer glaring so intensely behind the bar. \nWhile I've always had a strange soft spot for verve, I've only once had their coffee taste good in any of their cafes I've been to. I'll go back one or two more times, but realistically it'll be another cafe to file away in SF's boring, homogeneous coffee experience.", "author": "Mark B."}
