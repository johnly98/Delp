I truly regret this.\n\nI will admit it right here - I'm pretentiously picky. \n\nI'm so used to this fabricated notion that a restaurant should look like some \"fancy-shmancy\", commercialized establishment and I was too dumb to realize that I should never judge a book -- well hell, you know the rest of that saying.\n\nAs for El Tepa, I now work nearby again and I've eaten there more times than I can count. You can think of El Tepa as a neighborhood \"Chipotle\", but don't expect \"Chipotle\", expect something better.\n\nThis place definitely has its roots firmly planted in the Mission. I get that feeling of local ambiance whenever I walk in. I love how I can order from the menu, then customize my food, tweaking it the way that I want it - just like Chipotle - but better. Like I said, much better. The service is great, it always comes with a smile and a friendly greeting. The food preparers are attentive and they always confirm my order, and their salsa bar is clean and fully stocked. Speaking of salsa, I do have one gripe -- I need bigger cups for my pickled jalapenos and carrots. Those little cups at the salsa bar don't cut it. Hell, just give me a bag, I'll fill that puppy. Outside of that, keep doing what you're doing.\n\nSome early mornings, I may pass by El Tepa on my way to work (and NO, I'm not stalking the place) -- but sometimes, I'll see their staff diligently cleaning and prepping for the day ahead. It may be typical restaurant work, but I like that kind of commitment. It shows that El Tepa aims to bring their \"A\" game to their customers and they really do.\n\nI just wish that I was their customer, ten hungry years ago. That was my bad and I'm sorry. I missed out. I'm just happy that I discovered El Tepa later, rather than never.", "author": "John A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-14", "description": "When I went in line to order at El Tepa, the guy in front of me was ordering/chatting with one of the ladies behind the counter in Spanish. Then, they both stopped, looked at me, and started grinning. As they continued chatting, the lady glanced back at me several times.  \n\nUmmm, ok. This is awkward. \n\nIF I have a booger hanging out of my nose -  tell me, por favor!\n\nAnyhow, El Tepa Taqueria has been here for over a decade and I've passed by so many times but never thought to stop in until yesterday. I just finished my appointment down the block and all I can think of was a burrito. \n\nGallardos is cash only which I rarely carry so El Tepa it was!\n\nMy go-to at taquerias is always a lengua burrito but they don't serve any offal at El Tepa so I decided to order a Tostada Salad w/ al pastor & refried beans ($8.95) and a Watermelon Agua Fresca (L - $2.75). My order also came with a complimentary basket of chips and dibs to their salsa bar: http://bit.ly/2x4qo3B. \n\nWow, is all I can say. I was expecting mediocrity (or worse) because you never hear about El Tepa and they have so little reviews for being in business as long as they have. \n\nThe multi-layer tostada shell was light and crispy, and was layered with refried beans, a generous serving of al pastor then topped with shredded lettuce, crema, cheese, tomato, red onions, and cilantro. The al pastor was well-seasoned and I loved all the fatty, caramelized edges. The refried beans were very smooth though when combined with the al pastor, it's a touch too salty. More lettuce would have helped to balance the saltiness but nonetheless, it was a surprisingly solid tostada salad. I will definitely opt for guacamole next time for an extra $1. \n\nThe accompanying chips reminded me of a less salty and less greasy version of Chevy's chips which are purely addicting IMO. The salsas were on point - I really enjoyed the creamy tangy salsa verde (w/ avocado?) and the smoky orange salsa (reminds me a little bit of La Vic's orange sauce but more robust, smoky, and spicy). They also have two types of pico de gallo, and the spicy version had a good amount of jalapenos for some fiyah. \n\nI washed everything down the Watermelon Agua Fresca which was watered down but otherwise, a good thirst quencher. I would probably skip this next time and just enjoy their complimentary fruit infused water. \n\nThe cashier was friendly and I like that cleanliness seems to be important to them. The salsa bar was well-stocked and very clean. I constantly saw an employee wiping down the tables after a customer left. And, kudos for using compostable [Greenware] cups!\n\nI came after the lunch rush so I was able to find easily seating. As the food options are scant in this part of The Mission, this place seems to be frequented by nearby techies. \n\nOverall, El Tepa is a surprisingly solid taqueria. Though I can only vouch for their al pastor, if you ever find yourself in this quiet part of The Mission and hangry, give this unassuming taqueria a shot!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Unfortunately it was a very disappointing experience. The portion was decent, but if I'm paying almost $10 for loaded nachos, at least give me good, crunchy chips. \n\nI should've questioned it when I saw them digging into the bottom of the trash bin, yes a literal trash bin is where they store their chips. Never has \"bottom of the barrel\" so accurately described a situation. I mean, this 5\"2 lady lifted the bin from it's handle and flipped it upside down like a bully would do to a kid for some lunch money.\n\nTheir al pastor \"bbq pork\" was flavorless and came with grilled onions that weren't even sweet. The guac was just ok, but the salsa was pretty decent. \n\nDefinitely not coming back here since there are so many other places to try in the area.", "author": "Cam C."}

They were playing a movie on the huge flat screen TV. \n\nWe ordered 2 super quesadilla. One with beef and one with carnitas. Both were delicious. The carnitas tasted like the pernil we used to make at home for holidays, well seasoned and slightly gamey. \n\nTheir quesadillas aren't like the kind you get at other places. They look like flattened burritos and if you get a super, it comes loaded with sour cream and guac. They cut it into 3 large pieces. \n\nEach meal also comes with chips and they have a little salsa bar by the register. I like the creamy orange sauce.", "author": "Junella T."}

I started coming here when I worked in the area a decade ago.  I'm not a regular by any means, but I do still stop in now and then.  They used to hand out a lot of discount coupons; and that helped to drive my traffic.  \n\nMy burrito of choice here is the spicy shrimp; do they call it camarones diablos here?  One thing that I like is that the ratio of shrimp to starch in the burrito is pretty high.

OK guys, OK, I understand you want to save me money but why not just have a handy website I can access at my leisure? If you remind me one more time about how organized my closet could be I'm going to smack you in the mouth. \n\nOh, but we're talking about El Tepa. Thanks to the handy dandy $2 off Dinner Plate coupon Val-U-Annoy gave me I went back for a second run on the carnitas. Here's a little tidbit about Mission taquerias in general: if you were going to get two super tacos anyway you're better off getting the plate. It basically works out to 3 super tacos for the price of 2.5. That's half a super taco for free! And if you're sporting a $2 off coupon? Well, prepare for leftovers! \n\nI'm bumping El Tepa up from 2 (really 2.5) to 3 stars because the carnitas came correct this time around and the salsa bar was up and running. I'd happily not be able to give them 3.5 stars but they seem to be zeroed in on the sad-sack-iest employees of all taqueria history. That's saying something because, if there's one thing all us Mission folk know it's that a cheerful taqueria employee is as likely as meeting somebody interesting at the creepy laundry mat that's closest to your house but also soul damaging. Sure, it COULD happen but it's all together so unlikely you don't even bother getting your hopes up. Well, El Tepa just set a new Creepy Mission Laundry Mat to Taqueria analogy low. I tried all my tricks; my bad gringo Spanish, my happy carnitas yum yum dance, the suspiciously cheerful goodbye. No dice. \n\nSo, head to El Tepa if you've got a coupon and a hankerin' for thoroughly mediocre fare with a free side order of maudlin. On second thought, go get a corn dog at Whiz-Burger. At least you'll have the illicit thrill of potentially being jumped by the crazy resident crackhead with the Bozo the Clown haircut.", "author": "Milk N."}

This place is never, ever crowded and they serve the BEST, I mean the BEST prawn burrito in all of San Francisco (well, all that I have tasted so far!). The prawns are marinated in their secret sauce and it just gives an orgasmic taste to the burrito when you bite into it. If you ask for \"super,\" they really pile it on with all the good stuff (guac, sour cream, etc.) and you will be eating this burrito for days! I've also tried their super nachos with grilled chicken and it was great as well. The ladies are always very nice and efficient and they never get an order wrong......Whenever you are in the area, you gotta try this place and if you craving some good Mexican food, this is the place to go!", "author": "La C."}

And thank god for the consistency as it's one of two choices to which one can get run and get lunch in time to actually eat it after going out to get it since I toil in the world of the 30 minute lunch break.  The lovely lovely ladies at El Tepa are always pleasant and almost remember exactly what I'm gonna order when I walk in the door.", "author": "Kevin M."}

Everyone is really friendly, the food it great, especially the green salsa, and its  pretty cheap.  They also have a huge variety of beverages and colorful little tables.  Brightens my day every time.   I also swear that somehow they have the most amazing avocados that I have ever tasted in my life. It must be because they cut them with love.", "author": "Naomi M."}

So I drove here with my co-worker and she usually gets me stuff from here.  I ordered a super chicken burrito.  I figured if I am gonna eat I might as well get it with all the fixings.  My super burrito came with chicken, cheese, salsa. guacamole, hot salsa, rice, sour cream and a little bit if black beans....I usually skip the beans but I was trying not to discriminate.  The burrito was good with their green tomatillo sauce.  Definitely a huge difference from what I can get in the Pac Heights.s", "author": "Allison T."}

First the food is great - I usually get the roasted chicken or carnitas burritos, but I hear the fish is excellent.  The prices are modest, the service excellent (they are always so cheerful), its probably the cleanest taqueria in the Mission, and finding parking near by is always easy.   Their only downside is that they are not open on seven days a week.", "author": "Tony F."}

Super Tacos really are \"Super\" ....they're huge. I can usually eat 4-5 tacos, here only 2 fit.\n\nMy favorite part about this place is the Jalapeno's that are pickled fresh and stored in the sauce counter. They're crisp and spicy. Not like those other places that are boiled mushy and pickled to death. Also, the rice is the bomb! Most mexican rice I eat is dry, here it's moist and tastes so good I could eat it by itself.\n\nLastly my only comlaint rests with  the Flauta's. Those things are so good I gained like 10 pounds trying to sneak them into my usual burrito order.", "author": "connor m."}

I have been here about 5-6 times, and every time I go here I always have the best service, and everyone who have helped me is really nice. I met the owner Joe, and he is also very nice to me when ever I come here. Also they have a perfect clean score, and their food is Awesome. When ever someone asks for food suggestions I always tell them to go here...", "author": "Bridget A."}

I had a chicken burrito that was both adequately seasoned and large enough to satisfy.  Thumbs up for the serve-yourself condiment/salsa table too!  Parking in the hood isn't too bad, and seating is never a hassle.  Although I'm a devoted carnivore, I've had my veggie friends give this place a thumbs-up.  Not the best...but better than most.", "author": "Mike W."}

A work colleague took me here for lunch one day and I am hooked. I have the grilled fish taco with black beans and some times I have them throw on some cheese and guac. Outstanding.

Had their al pastor (bbq pork) burrito here today.  The al pastor was very flavorful and the regular burrito was a decent size not like some places where they don't give you alot of meat and and the tortilla is wrapped around twice!  Will have to come back and try some of their other dishes.  My only gripe is they don't put the salsa, pickled carrots/jalapeno, and limes out so you can get it yourself like some places.", "author": "Rick P."}
