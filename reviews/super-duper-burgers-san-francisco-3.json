Had never been to a Super Duper before. \n\nI ordered a mini burger with cheese and the garlic fries with the sauces. He had a mini burger and ordered a chocolate shake to share. \n\nThe burger was very good (I love sesame buns) but the patty itself was far too salty. I thought the size was perfect.\n\nThe garlic fries were far too greasy. The garlic flavor was strong, which I liked, but I could've skipped the cheese on top. Wasn't wild about the sauces. If I were to come back, would just order the plain fries and miss the sauces out. \n\nThe shake was only ok. Wasn't as chocolatey as I normally prefer. I'd say the main stand out for me was the free homemade cucumber pickles they had near the drink fountains. So good!", "author": "Ashtar B."}

This has to be my 3rd visit since this place has opened up in the city. Before my recent visit, I had thought the burgers were overpriced for the quality.\n\nNow to re-evaluate:\n\nService is pretty fast pace. Nothing to complain about. You order and they hand you a beeper and you get your food on an aluminum tray.\n\nYou do have to pay extra for cheese. Pretty ridiculous. Anyway:\n\nDouble burger: delicious! Patties were nice and salty, a good mix of fat and lean meat. But mostly fat. If you are a health nut, I recommend the chicken burger...\n\nChicken burger: I was very disappointed, since I assumed it was a deep fried burger. Aside from that, it was good. Big chunk of grilled chicken marinated in chipotle sauce. I originally ordered that, but switch burgers with my bf.\n\nFries: taste crisp and fresh. Super bomb!\n\nOkay place to stop by if you want to treat yourself to a gourmet burger. If not, there's a Burger King nearby.", "author": "Lynn C."}

Probably one of the best garlic friends and chicken sandwich I've ever had. I just didn't want it to end! The chicken wasn't dry at all. They're very generous with their proportions.

The first time I went, I ordered a super burger with two 4oz patties, a beer and garlic fries. The super burger is enormous for $8 which was way too much food for me - I was stuffed, but it was really good! I asked for everything on it (but no cheese - which is extra $) and grabbed some pickles on the side. All of the pickles are available next to the organic ketchup to be tonged from a pickle jar. The garlic fries had plenty of garlic and cheese, the portion was big and they tasted really good. The fries themselves were very crispy. The beer is also a great deal at $5. \n\nMy second trip included a mini burger which was much more my size, regular french fries, an adult sized twisted cone and a kid sized twisted shake. I actually ordered a kids twisted cone and they made me the kids shake on accident, so they told me to keep the shake and additionally gave me an adult sized cone to make up the cost difference. Even though I really didn't want this much ice cream, I thought the customer service was great! \n\nThe location itself has tons of seating upstairs and downstairs, even a few tables outside as well. I thought the restaurant was clean, as were the bathrooms. This is officially one of my favorite lunch spots when I'm in the financial district/at work.", "author": "Bri T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-03", "description": "This by far my favorite non-table-service burger in town (sorry In-N-Out).  It is a bit pricier than fast food, costing about $14 if you want the Super Duper Combo w/ Cheese.  A bargain compared to eating at restaurants in San Francisco, but definitely higher priced than Value Meals.  But it's totally worth it for the quality upgrade.\n\nSuper Duper Burger w/ Cheese: The patties are thick and juicy, with a brilliant sear on each side.  Infused with a nice fat-to-meat ratio, the mild cheddar cheese adds some extra richness to the experience.  I always get everything on it, plus jalape\u00f1os.  I've tried the specialty burger flavors, but something about the original format just makes it my favorite.\n\nFries: These have definitely improved over the years.  I remember their fries used to be disappointing like In-N-Out fries.  Now they're better, though not quite at McDonald's fries level yet.\n\nPickles: I absolutely love sour pickles (...though find sweet bread & butter pickles pretty nasty).  They taste fresh (for a pickle), not like they've been sitting around in vinegar for months.  So I can down quite a few spears while my burger is getting ready.  And then the pickle party continues during my burger to help cleanse the palate of all that rich fat between bites.", "author": "Adam B."}

I like to describe it as a much better Five Guys, with Beer. And for those that haven't had Five Guys, these burgers might be too good for you.\n\nThough because this is the Market Street location, expect schizophrenic yelling outside and aggressive homeless panhandling inside! And depending on time also long lines, confused Asian tourists \n\nThat shouldn't drive you away, however. The food speaks for itself. While they have salads and chicken sandwiches, the place is called Super Duper BURGERS. So you should probably get one of those. Split between the single \"Mini\" and the double \"Super Duper\" you can get them standalone or in a combo; they have seasonal specials like the Ceasar and the 4 Cheese. \n\nWhile I've felt like a fatty getting the Super Duper Combo and a Milkshake before, as my metabolism and lactose tolerance isn't as strong anymore, I usually get a Mini combo, adding cheese and bacon and including all the extras - lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce. This will usually be just enough and easily inhale the tasty burger. Don't forget the napkin dispensers because you will need them! If you like pickles, ketchup, and mustard, they have that available as well. \n\nI'm a fan and will usually hit them up once a year. While you do have Roam and Umami for fancier burgers, hard to beat Super Duper for quick and tasty.", "author": "Michael C."}

Don't get me wrong I love In-N-Out too, and I've been to several locations on the west coast - the best coast, but my first visit to Super Duper has me convinced that what I just consumed, between two fresh buns, was superior to whatever I had at In-N-Out. And sorry, my only proof is my crumpled eco-friendly napkins & a very satisfied stomach. Oh my was it good for you too, Scarlett?\n\nThe nanosecond I walked-in I felt safe & knew I belonged. Maybe it was the attractive hapa counter gal taking my combo order with fries & iced tea that started me up, or maybe it was a Mr. Spike Lee (see pic) challenging me on the east coast is the best coast theory, but the casual vibe with hand painted signs everywhere, and recyclable everything made it so right. Heck, good ol' friend Spike was too busy inhaling his soft cone to argue his Yo Knicks or Do The Right Thing, circa 1989 with me... no matter because it was all about the burgers, but not just any burger... a Super Duper Burger! And did I mention happy hour they have with b-e-e-r on tap!? Not a beer drinker? How about wine on tap, or a killer milkshake, or even Spike(d) shake! Just ask! \n\nSo if I'm correct, excuse Spike still grubbing away, this is a Bay Area phenomenon. The best burger on any coast is here, well under ten bucks! I mean I can debate Scarlett & Spike on how for $300, Le Burger Extravagant from New York's Serendipity 3 might be better, and yea it's a ten-ounce Wagyu beef patty infused with 10-herb white truffle butter, seasoned with Alderwood smoked sea salt, topped with Montgomery cheddar cheese, shaved black truffles, and a fried quail egg, served on a white truffle buttered 24K gold flecked Campagna roll, which is topped with a blini cr\u00e8me fraiche and Kaluga caviar. Yo! Let's just respectfully bury the coast talk with Tupac & Biggie, R.I.P. Besides rich folks... who spends $300 on burgers? And no, Spike Lee is not Chinese! Yo, who even cares because to me I just found the best burger ever under a Hamilton! That's ten bucks on you! \n\n*walks out with Scarlett Johansson smiling from ear to ear* And I don't want to brag, but... it was more than my Super Duper... To be continued...", "author": "Eric R."}

Service was top. Although we had never been there before - which made us that annoying couple that couldn't make up their mind - the cashier was super friendly and helpful.\n\nNow food: Oh man, I'm literally the worst when it comes to eating any sort of meat and am extremely picky but Super Duper Burgers blew it out of the park. Imagine a juicy burger, cooked to perfection that's crispy on the outside but full of juices once you take your first bite! Their signature sauce and fresh toppings were just a cherry on top. \nEven the fries were just so crispy and perfectly cooked. \nBeing the lame tourists that visit Cali and want to eat at In and Out we had no plans on eating burgers anywhere else but since we were so hungry we decided to \"settle\" for Super Duper Burger. \nNow lemme tell you, this was by far one of the best burgers I have ever had and when I still hit up In and Out a few days later I was greatly disappointed by how boring In and Out tasted in comparison to Super Duper.", "author": "Sarah T."}

In between appreciating art, we found ourselves getting hungry and used Yelp to figure out what was nearby with good reviews. We decided on Super Duper Burgers as we'd also heard a local friend describe this place as 'In-N-Out but organic'. I love In-N-Out so I knew I had to try it!\n\nI got the Mini Burger and it was still really filling. Every bite felt fresh and I could taste the quality of the ingredients. The real star was the house-made ketchup though! I love that it didn't taste as sweet as mass-produced ketchup and it was the perfect condiment to elevate the burger. My friend got the Chicken Sandwich and it was huge and yummy. The chipotle aioli definitely leans on the spicier side so I wouldn't suggest it if you can't take some heat.\n\nWe also shared the garlic fries and they were perfectly crispy. Seating was a bit limited as this place was packed but we managed to hover around and find something decently fast.

My total came out to around $16 including tax. \n\nFood:\nThe burger was really good! I kind of wished it had a little more seasoning on the meat itself but the bun, lettuce and tomato were all really fresh! The fries were really crunchy and rich - a little heavier on the cheese than garlic flavor, but good nonetheless - just maybe don't market it as garlic fries if they're not going to taste garlicky! \n\nWeirdly enough the ice cream was my favorite part! Tasted like a classic chocolate dipped cone from the drive-thrus of my childhood. Would definitely recommend you save room for dessert to try one of these, whatever chocolate they use is really sweet and complements the mild vanilla flavor of the ice cream well.\n\nService:\nThey were so fast and helpful! The cashier asked if it was my first time there and explained how big the patties were and recommended a few options to me.

Even though they have additional seating upstairs, seating is limited, as they do get very busy. They do have restrooms inside, but you'll need a passcode, which is available on the receipt after you order. \n\nAs for their food, they're good; but their prices are pretty expensive and their portions are definitely on the smaller size, although you are getting everything cooked on the fresh & healthier side.

What do I do? Find a quick and affordable option in walking distance of my hotel. I open up my Yelp app to discover Super Duper right around the corner. Having missed out on visits with my teammates, I decided it was time. \n\nThe order: Super Burger (add cheese) + Garlic Fries. \n\nThe verdict: Oh yeahhh, this was a deliciously tasty burger! Two four oz. patties with excellent char glued together with melty cheese, topped with LTO and yummy sauce, in between a soft, sesame seed bun. I appreciate the hell out of this old school recipe executed wonderfully. \n\nFor me, the fries were a bit much. They were rich as hell due to the aged cheddar. Honestly, I probably should have opted for the classic fries. Can I get a holla for those house made pickles though?! I could snack on these puppies for days.\n\nOverall, I find Super Duper to be a west coast spin on many of the fast casual burger joints in my neck of the woods.

Since it was my first time (and I wasn't very hungry), I just got a plain mini burger.  My bf, being the hungry beast he is, he had the super burger, which is two patties and added the bacon and cheese. With all the add-on's, it's a $10+ burger. And that's just the burger. If you want fries and a drink, that's more. I don't think the combos save you any money. I mean sure, it was good burger. Veggies seemed fresh and the meat had a good beef flavor.

When we ordered we were waiting for our food for 10 minutes and me and my cousin were wondering what is taking so long. My cousin went up to the person that's ever ordered and they told us there were some reason our order was not in the system. This made me really mad because we were waiting for food and for a long time and now we have to wait even longer, and we were also very hungry. They refunded my money, or you guys should be totally on top of me things. I am thankful that you guys gave me my money back and with the free food.\n\n\nNow going towards the food, the food was a bit too greasy.

What a funny name I certainly wondered how they decided to come up with that name until I tried the burger then it became abundantly clear. If anybody follows my reviews they know that I am quick to hit a restaurant that has burger and it's name. The first thing I did when I got to San Francisco was look for the best burger around me. I came across Super Duper burgers and it had an awesome Yelp reviews so I thought I would give it a try. It was around around 5 o'clock on a Thursday and the line was manageable it took about five minutes to get to the front with about 10 people ahead of me. I navigated through the menu and landed on the Super Duper burger and garlic fries. We sat down and was pleasantly surprised to find out that pickles were free.Kind of like other restaurants would offer peanuts or chips for free. I took full advantage of this and damn near and got full on pickles. They were spicy and fresh. I am a pickle fiend and loved every bite. \n\nNow the good part. It took about 10 minutes for food to come and it looks amazing so I quickly got excited. I took one bite and quickly thought \"Why don't we have one of these in my hometown!\"It was absolutely amazing! The burger was juicy and cheesy (extra napkins are required) and the fries were absolutely to die for. Sprinkled with garlic and cheese. My wife was full and could not eat all of her fries so I pigged on those as well:) I was one of those meals where I felt sad after the first bite that this is going to end.

But it's not necessarily a bad thing since I think they make the burgers on the spot, so the burger ends up being really fresh and tasty.

This location feels a lot more open than the other location just a few minutes walk away. It doesn't feel as packed and that makes the meal much more enjoyable for me and my fellow claustrophobes and messy eaters.\n\nWhile the food is super duper--it is a Super Duper Burger joint--it was the act of kindness I witnessed that made me sure that this was the Super Duper I'd be going to. Eating today, I noticed a handicapped person wanting to order what he could with the little money he had in his hand. The management quickly gave him the meal on the house and it warmed my heart to see them do it so instinctively.\n\nThis Super Duper cares and I like that.

Pretty affordable lunch for SF. I ordered it to go, but some tables opened up so my group opted to dine in.\n\nThe burger was hefty (and kind of messy - grab napkins!) but delicious, as were the fries.

But what I actually got was a slightly-overcooked beef patty sandwiched between soggy bread. *sad face* Not to mention that I was also underwhelmed by the lack of customer service. When I ordered with my parents, my dad wanted a combo meal with a soda. The cashier told us that we would be given our soda once our meal was ready. I also requested my super sauce on the side. When we were ready to pick up our order at the counter, we didn't get our soda or my sauce on the side. I asked the server, and he rudely tossed me the sauce on the counter and rebuked that we should have gotten our soda from the cashier.\n\nMaybe it was the fact that we went to Super Duper Burgers during peak hours for dinner, but I was really frustrated that neither the meal nor the customer service lived up to the chain's reputation. You would really need to convince me to give this place another shot, although funnily enough, I would rather come here for burgers than In n Out. (Surprise surprise.)", "author": "Connie X."}

Well, I was in the city for a tech event at the Moscone Center and had a short lunch break, so I figured this was the perfect time to try this semi fast food joint. \n\nGot there around 11:30 and there was already a line forming, which took me about 15 minutes to get through, but gave me enough time to figure out what I wanted. Luckily found a seat at the bar where I got to enjoy the action of the kitchen (Made me even more hungry before my meal). Ended up going with the mini burger and some regular fries. Burger was on point and as many have mentioned, very juicy, and cooked to perfection. Fries were crispy and not limp and soggy, well worth the affordable price. As for the sides, nothing spectacular, but the pickles were pretty tasty. I honestly wish I would've gotten a spiked shake, but I needed to be on my game for work, so next time it is definitely happening! As for the interior, it offers a new aesthetically pleasing feel with a second floor to accommodate the traffic of consumers. I saw a lot getting to go due to the fact that the seats filled up quick after 12:00. \n\nSo, was it worth the hype, I think so!

It has plenty of seating because there is an upstairs, cleanliness is not an issue here, and their workers are very friendly and helpful.\n\nTheir Chicken Sandwich is BOMB'DIGGS!!!  It is huuuuge and I proudly admit to finishing every last bit of it.  Their Chicken Sandwich starts with a lightly toasted Ciabatta bread that is crisp on the outside yet soft and fluffy on the inside.  The chicken in this sandwich is grilled, I believe.  I don't know how they do it but they manage to make the edges of the chicken crispy while keeping the inside moist and juicy. && the Chipotle aioli that goes with it definitely adds a bunch of flavor.  Although it seems pretty simple, this sandwich is well thought out because all the ingredients mix together beautifully without one overpowering another.\n\nTheir Super Burger has a lot of flavor as well but be prepared to get down and dirty with this one.  It's either really juicy or really greasy or a mixture of both because there is no clean way to eat this thing haha.

I feel like I need to get there soon and buy a jar because I read a Yelp that indicated you're experimenting with recipes - so please save that one.\n\nYour pickles made up for our burger orders being messed up.  I thought your meat was cardboard tough and tasted funny (as if it had taken an acrid smoke bath), but the problem turned out to be bacon.  Horrible bacon, don't buy that stuff again.  Hubby's burger didn't have bacon on it, so I got to taste what mine could have been and it was much better.  I also was meh about the lemonade.  It didn't live up to expectations, fortunately some water and a few ice cubes improved it.  In spite of the problems, I'll give you another chance but I'll order a shake next time.  I don't think the Super Bowl crowds threw you off today, because Yelp reviews say you're usually crowded during lunch and dinner.

I know I'm trying to sell this really hard, but that's only because it is really that good. Also, the garlic fries - amazing!

An unlimited supply of pickles with your meal! The pickles are a little bit spicy and just so delicious. \n\nI ordered the mini burger with bacon and a side of garlic fries. Everything was good. I like how they put a lot of cheese on top of the garlic fries. The price was decent as well.", "author": "Annie H."}

We ordered ours with cheese and everything on it. One thing I really liked was how thinly sliced the onion was. I personally don't like super thick onions in my burgers. \n\nThe burger was so good.

She wasn't just hungover - it was actually the best burger I ever had, too.\n\nSuper Duper had gotten even better since the last time I had it last year. Lesson learned: stick either the red onions that come on the signature burger instead of substituting my beloved grilled onions. The flavor combination is perfect just the way Super Duper intended. Believe them.\n\nThe garlic fries are also more delicious now, with melted (cheddar?) cheese and what seems like a bit less garlic for the perfect balance. Let's not forget the vanilla shake, which is perfectly light and sweet with a pure vanilla flavor. \n\nForget In N Out, and dare I say, Shake Shack.

Their menu isn't really huge, but it is big enough to allow for customization. They have options where you can get a burger with one or two patties, and even an option to get chicken or veggie patties. The free options of things to add onto your burgers were pretty good, especially the pickles that you can grab, but my favorite part was that you can add avocado and egg. The egg is always a winner if you ask me, but I felt like they could have added more avocado to my burger for the extra dollar I was paying, but it was still delicious nonetheless. The burger was really nice and juicy and I kind of wish I got the second patty, but at least I know for next time. I want hungry before eating, but I got hungry afterwards so I kind of regret not getting their fries, especially their garlic fries since I heard so much about it. \n\nOverall, great food and I would have done things differently myself.

The little money you spend here is placed back in the community you live in. Think real hard about this if this is a new concept.

So today after a hard ass workout at Cardio Tone I bit the bullet and decided to stop by with two of my said coworkers for a bite. \n\nWe got there at around 6:15pm on a Friday. We got lucky and beat the stream of people who came in after us. We also got the last big table. It smells so freaking good when you walk in. \n\nI was told to get a mini burger with cheese. I obliged and also added grilled onions because a burger always needs grilled onions. We shared an order of garlic fries as well. \n\nSeating-a lot of two people tables! See if you can push them together if you're 3+. We actually sat upstairs where they had a long wooden table that can accommodate a party of 6 ish. It's a nice area that overlooks the entire restaurant. There are munchkin tables outside. Some tall tables downstairs. \n\nMini cheese burger-DELICIOUS. I think super duper knocks out In N Out... The pattie was so juicy and tender and perfectly cooked. It was a very good medium well. Just the tiniest amount of pink. It was perf! The cheddar was melted beautiful. Ugh. I can't believe I waited so long to try this place. \n\nGarlic parm fries-so much parm and garlic. Sooooo much parm. I love it. Keep adding more parm! lol \n\nTheir homemade pickles are self serve. Have a bowl. It's got a slight kick to them. I enjoyed eating them. \n\nI love the way they have everything set up. If you're upstairs you don't have to go all the way down to get ketchup, napkins, pickles, etc. \n\nTL;DR-BETTER than In N Out, cheese burger and parm fries you won't be sorry! P.

Decided to do a search on yelp and then decided to go to the joint with the most reviews. Ta-da, our choice was Super Duper! \n\nSuper Duper's set up reminds me of Shake Shack. The quality is better than a typical fast food burger but it's still categorized as fast food. The prices are higher than your typical fast food burger as well. It's in that gray area between fast food and restaurant style. \n\nYou go up, you order, and you sit down with a buzzer. The buzzer buzzes when your food is ready and that's when you go up and get it. \n\nMy boyfriend decided to share one of their combos that included a double patty burger with cheese, garlic fries, and a drink. The whole thing came out to be about $14 with tax. Definitely a little pricey, especially if this is all for just one person. At least this was split between two people so it's decent for us. \n\nThe burger itself was DELICIOUS. It was juicy and seasoned really really well. If I was any hungrier, I would've definitely loved to eat one all by myself! There's also options to add avocado and/or an egg to your burger but we didn't see that until after. Maybe next time! \n\nAs for the garlic fries, it was like sheer perfection. You can smell it! I'm not sure how they go about doing these fries but it has a super garlic taste to it. Plus, they have shredded cheese on top to go with it so the garlic won't punch you in the face if you're not used to it. It was reallllly yummmmmy. \n\nFor dessert, we tried their soft serve! You can definitely taste the vanilla really well and it is definitely a notch above any other fast food soft serve. The texture is slightly different and it actually reminded me of the texture of gelato. \n\nThis particular location can be good or bad. If you're just walking around then it's perfect but parking will always be a pain. We came on a Sunday night so it wasn't bad at all but I can't imagine how it'll be like during the afternoon on a weekend.

One of my roomies has resolved to save more money in 2017, so he told me to pick an affordable place for dinner (not exactly easy to do in SF). I figured this was reasonable and classier than McDonald's. \n\nI had the mini burger (half sized 4 oz. patty) with cheese (additional cost), lettuce, tomato, and grilled onions (free!). He had the grilled chicken sandwich- eating healthy is another one of his New Year's resolutions. We both skipped the fries and shakes, which pained me, but was the right thing to do. \n\nThe burger was good for the price, and definitely several steps above a typical fast food joint, but not quite as good as Shake Shack IMO. I don't get the point of sesame seeds on a bun- just empty calories with zero value added, and makes it look like a Big Mac. I tried a bite of his sandwich, and it was surprisingly really tender and juicy.

I will admit it can get a little pricey if you add on a lot of toppings (example, cheese is 50 cents extra) but you really pay for a catered experience, friendly service, and a clean venue. Great breakfast deals too! You can get an egg and cheese sandwich with a small Dyanamo donut and coffee for $5.50. They sell Dynamo donuts by the dozen, $8 for 1 and $15 for 2.

But because it didn't come with napkins, I had to go get it myself, but in order to get up and walk to the napkins I had to stow my phone away into my pocket, but I couldn't stow my phone away because of the napkin problem and the oil just starting to dribble. \n\nIt was a catch-22 which then reminded me to finish reading catch-22, which was on my kindle, which I couldn't get because of the oil yet again.

With such a cheesy name like Super Duper Burgers, you may have some reservations about this popular burger joint on Market Street. Once inside, you understand why they are popular. The restaurant has counter service with a rather large two-level dining area. Drinks and condiments are self-serve to help speed up the process.\n\nI chose the Mini Burger, which is really a decent 1/4 natural beef patty with the fixings. Paired with perfectly cooked French fries, this burger hit the spot. The rich flavor of the meat cut through the complementary grilled onions and optional cheddar cheese. The burger is nice and juicy with a loose texture indicative of fresh ground meat. The fries are near perfect with a great crisp texture and soft interior.\n\nYou can easily add up the toppings and go overboard with extra sides, but I found the basics were nearly perfect which is a great sign. Even though they are very busy, they are fast and accurate with the orders. You can easily get a quick and wholesome burger fix here, and even an organic soft-serve cone after! Highly recommended.", "author": "Kristian D."}

All of these places are more expensive and less viscerally satisfying than In-N-Out, in my opinion, but I always appreciate them anyway.\n\nMy husband and I met my friend Yangchen C. and her family for a casual lunch when we were in San Francisco. Yangchen suggested the place because she has a toddler who likes to explore, and Super Duper Burgers is relaxed enough that no one really cares if a baby is doing some light climbing at the next table. We walked from our hotel in Union Square, and no one cared that we had our luggage with us either. The space was pleasant, cheerful and open, and we occupied a row of tables by the windowed wall facing onto the street. We ordered at the counter, and service was fast and friendly.\n\nI got a Super Burger, a hefty fast food burger with two 4-oz. patties and Super Sauce, with cheese for an extra 75\u00a2. I got some of the free toppings--grilled onions, jalape\u00f1os, and housemade pickles--and sprung for the avocado for another dollar. Ended up being almost a $10 burger without fries, but fine enough for a sit-down lunch. My husband got a Super Burger with bacon, and we split an order of the French fries, and supplemented with strawberry and vanilla shakes. The food was solid, if not especially memorable. I enjoyed my burger and fries, and the shakes were thick and creamy.\n\nMy husband loves his burgers, so I have a feeling Super Duper Burgers would be in our rotation if we lived in the Bay. It's a likable place with good fast food, a nice default for a cheap sit-down meal where you can still get a beer.", "author": "Steph C."}

From the burgers to the garlic fries and to the shakes; everything about this place is so delicious! \n\nLocated in the mist of the shopping areas of Union Square, this is my favorite place to stop by. \n\nI usually get the mini burger which isn't mini at all. The difference between the mini and the super duper is that mini has one 4 oz. patty and the super duper has two 4 oz. patties. Hungry? Then get the super duper! Add the cheese for $0.50 extra because you won't regret it. It's perfectly melted onto the juicy patty. TOTALLY MOUTH WATERING GOODNESS. There are free toppings that you can add on such as lettuce, tomato, red onions, super sauce, jalapeno peppers, grilled onions and pickles. If you love to add an egg to your burgers, it's an extra $1.50 and it goes perfectly with the burger. My boyfriend usually gets the chicken sandwich which he completely loved. The chicken for the sandwich was perfectly grilled and super juicy. Pepper jack cheese goes great with it! Definitely would recommend you getting that if you're not much of a beef person. \n\nThe garlic fries here...bomb. They have a generous topping of cheese and the garlic isn't overpowering. The shakes here are super tasty as well. My favorites are the vanilla or fresh strawberry shake. They come in a big glass cup that fills you up & it's organic! Try dipping your fries in your shake because it's actually pretty good.. if its not weird. \n\nFor all you pickle lovers, they have homemade pickled jars for you to enjoy with your meal! Eat as much as you want! \n\nService here is great. Even when it seems crowded, the lines move up pretty fast and your food is ready in about 5-10 minutes with the buzzer to tell you when it's ready. I wouldn't recommend taking your car to get here because it's crazy in this part of SF. \n\nAll in all, definitely would recommend trying Super Duper even in any other locations they may have. Everything tastes super fresh and I literally love everything here!", "author": "Tiffany H."}

So, I waited patiently in line and perused the menu. I decided on the Super Burger with everything ($7.75 - Two 4 oz. patties, with Super Sauce with cheese +75\u00a2) and an order of French Fries ($2.75) with a water. The staff was super friendly, and you got a buzzer to let you know when your food was ready. I grabbed my water and a seat at the counter bar, which directly faces the kitchen and their handy work. I only had to wait about 10 minutes before my buzzer informed me that my Super Burger was ready! YAY! I grabbed my food and headed over to the condiment area. Now, I firmly believe in not messing with the chef's creation, so, I put a little mustard in a dish and grabbed a couple house made pickles and went back to the counter to enjoy my meal. My first bite was filled with delicious beef, cheese, and all the fixings. Did it melt in my mouth, yes, yes it did! And those fried though, man, crisped to perfection and not too fat, not too skinny! Super Burger filled all my burger dreams and more.

The burgers were dry and flavorless and the garlic fries  cold and soggy. For $11 I would recommend getting 2x In-n-Out's double patty burgers with animal fries. \n\n\"Super duper\" burger: The 8oz double patty burger comes with lettuce and tomatoes between two toasted buns. The \"medium\" cooked burger was overly well done and very dry. The first two bites were like chalk dust and it only got marginally better once I bit into the mildly sauced middle. It didn't help that the burger was lukewarm (do they not make them fresh?) and almost greaseless (I'm not expecting a salad here). This burger falls far from its namesake.\n\nGarlic fries: Cold. Soggy. Kind of like fries you'd left overnight on the counter and then doused with some flavor to cover up the staleness. The garlic flavor was strong which I really liked but the snowy layer of cheese slid off like it didn't belong.", "author": "Carrie X."}

But for my handy dandy Yelp app, I would have thought that I'd reviewed this location. Well, I suppose things can change in three years. Whereas earlier I was smitten by Super Duper, this time around and in the location, I was okayed.\n\nI ordered the same thing as before: 4 oz. with bacon & cheese (no mayo), cheese garlic fries and a beer. This time, there was no spark. Granted, this visit was during the lunch rush and not during the (more) relaxed evening hours. The folks behind the bar poured the wrong beer but, to their credit, they let me keep the erroneous brew and poured me the correct one. 2 for 1 beers is always awesome... except when your doctor buddy is on your a$$ about watching carbs and your expanding waistline. #butilovebeer\n\nThe food was ready a short time later. My burger was more burnt than charbroiled and rather than melty, garlicky fries, these were lukewarm fries topped with shredded cheese and garlic bits. Like, parts of cloves. As in, unpleasant to bite down on in the absence of high heat and some type of sauce. Were things like this on Mission Street? Did I remember wrong? Is this the little girl I carried? As you can tell, I was confused. I am confused. My Gary Cooper, Puttin' On The Ritz razzle dazzle dancing had been replaced by some iteration of contemplative, angry Alanis... and that hasn't been good since the '90s. At the end of the day, it's a burger, fries and a beer. Even when it's bad (unless it's baaad), it's okay. Thing is, I vaguely remember it really really dang good. I want that Super Duper back. Hmm, maybe Mission has the magic?", "author": "Johnny T."}

However, only a few hours on the ground had me convinced that I had to check it out, and check it out I did. Worth it. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nIf you've been to more or less any of the fast casual spots that have sprung up around the country, you'll appreciate the service and atmosphere here at Super Duper Burgers. One noteworthy difference; however, is that you're more than likely to encounter a line here at SDB that well into the double digits. I lucked out and waited only ten or so minutes around 9PM on a Friday, but seating was a whole separate ballgame, and you'll without question be hard-pressed to find seating for more than maybe just a single. With that in mind, service won't take more than ten minutes, which is impressive given that these burgers are made fresh to order. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nFor $6.50 I landed myself a mini burger with cheese, which was about the size of a medium fast food burger. While you'd need more to hold you over for a big meal, this was satisfying, and the full burgers are still priced under $10. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nFoof! There's nothing fancy about them per se, but Super Duper Burger has fresh and flavorful ingredients that will have you coming back for more. The bun? Very good and light, the patty? Flavorful, and the toppings? Freshly cut and did their job of bringing it all together. I didn't get to sample the fries or milkshakes, but it was overly apparently that everyone around me was enjoying just about everything on the menu. Well done indeed. Dual Stars Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nI'm tempted here for sure and for certain, but I can't say with a straight face that Super Duper Burgers is better than say Umami, which I've also given four stars. Having said that, you need to come here, and don't be surprised if in the next few years you see a Super Duper Burgers pop up in your city. No Star Granted.", "author": "Paul V."}

The burgers were super juicy, the cheese wasn't overpowering or too salty, and damn, I even ordered it with the burger bun! Definitely worth the cheat meal because the bun didn't break up and wasn't soggy even through the last bite. Super fresh burgers with amazingly crispy fries (order it well done!). I mean, just look at that rich green lettuce! It's a case of the \"looks exactly like the photos and tastes just as good\" scenario. The photos are not deceiving! Real talk, I'm a SoCal native, and will have to say that this place is a tie with In n Out as my top fast food burger... It's hard to choose because although they both offer a simple menu, they both are unique enough (subject to my cravings) that I refuse to choose. Why not have both? Why not zoidberg?\n\nPrice-wise, you're paying a premium compared to other fast-food places, but the quality is there and the portion is generous, so the pricing isn't too bad considering the location. I appreciate their focus on locally-sourced vegetarian-fed beef and efforts on sustainability. Coupled with friendly service, this is recipe for an excellent experience without the hefty price tag ($$$).\n\nThe interior feels more industrial with high ceilings and dimmer lights.

Boy, were we surprised how good these burgers tasted.  From bite one, it was like a race to finish each.  The quality of the ingredients, the taste, and the price all work out well.  The fresh lettuce has a nice crunch to it, then it gets complemented by the tomato slice and the sauces.  When you finally get that tasty meat taste, in all of that awesome veg crunch, you'll realize this place is worth a stop every time.\n  I liked this place so much, I stopped at their other location within an hour of trying it the first time.

Even with all that seating there wasn't enough seating. Everyone fighting for seats. Anyways you order at the register and they give you a buzzer to tell you when your order is ready so you can pick up. We ate in so we wanted water and they gave us glass cups. Very interesting. This gives you some time to fight for a seat. \n\nAnyways, my son ordered the mini burger with bacon & no cheese which is basically a single pattie. I ordered a super duper with cheese which is a double pattie and garlic fries. They give you lettuce, tomato, onion, with their special sauce. \n\nI thought the meat was tasteless and the topping had not much flavor. A great burger has meat with taste and the topping are what make the burger explode with flavor in your mouth. This burger didn't do it for me. The garlic fries where just their fries with garlic and chives on top. Couldn't even taste the garlic on the fries. This didn't do anything for me. When the fries got cold which was really fast it made the fries taste even worst. Very unimpressed. \n\nOh yea after we ate my son thought the burger was pretty good.

It was surprisingly good and the toppings didn't really overwhelm the flavor of the beef. The garlic fries were ok, nothing too fancy honestly. The regular fries probably tasted better. But the ketchup is another story. Not sure what ketchup they use but it is GOOOOOOD. And the pickles are delicious as well. My only complaint is that the burgers are really, really greasy, so beware if any oil drips down (hopefully not on your clothes). \n\nWould definitely come back :) (soooo so much better than In-N-Out)", "author": "Andrew O."}

I am a HUGE fan of sour tastes and the unlimited homemade pickles and incredible. They have a great tang and compliment their amazing burgers. Although I do not always add it, the portobello mushroom is of an average portion and tastes great. What really blew me away this visit was the garlic fries. They top these fries with a great cheese and the garlic taste is infused all throughout. The fries were also incredibly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Definitely a quick bite place for me whenever I am going to be on the SF area. Caution, many super dupers close at different times so double check before you go.", "author": "Joshua L."}

A lady from Super Duper sent me a $15 gift card because I wrote a Yelp review, so I used it today to get a chicken sandwich. I love the pickles at Super Duper. That's the best part of the Super Duper experience. I also received some cards to get free ice cream cones with burger or sandwich purchase, so I used one and had the chocolate cone for the first time. The chicken sandwich was okay. It was somewhat smoked. It seemed healthy. It's not fried...maybe that would be better lol. It was a good meal.", "author": "Denise C."}

Based on the burger, I just can't do it! \n\nI got the mini-burger with cheese, which is just one patty and supposed to be cooked medium. I added caramelized onions as a free topping. This is identical to what I get at TrueBurger, but it didn't taste identical.\n\nThe meat at Super Duper is VERY well seasoned, and all I could taste was salt. Some people may appreciate this. But I really couldn't taste the beef or the caramelized onions -- just the salty seasoning. The burger also didn't have the juiciness I've come to expect from this type of burger place.\n\nWhat I DID love was the milkshakes. This isn't the only place in the Bay that serves great milkshakes, but it's the only place I've found that offers them spiked! I added a shot of vodka to my Cookies & Cream milkshake -- incredibly good.", "author": "Sheri W."}

I lived in SF my whole life and honestly super duper use to be the spot! When they first opened I fell in love with their burgers. And for about 2 yrs now I've lived in Pinole Ca. And recently on a visit to my folks my sister mentioned she was craving a burger. I said YES let's ordered Super Duper. What i thought was a good idea turn out to be tumbs down!!! First off they forgot one of my garlic fries, then I realized they didn't pack the 3 special sauces. but that was easily fixed since they refund that money. But once I took a bite of my burger it tasted like dirt!! It was oily! Flavorless! Jalape\u00f1o had lack of flavor. Avocado? Uuh, not worth your money. Bacon was under cooked, mostly fat and it had a weird color. Yea definitely don't recommend this place no more! I that case I rather just order from Mc Donald's.", "author": "Silvia C."}

I'll take a little too greasy over too dry.\nThank you. & Yum.\nWhen Super Duper first showed up on Market St., I thought, 'Cool, a new place to try for lunch.' Fast forward a few years, Super Duper is the fast casual burger chain that is taking over SF. \n\nMy usual order is the Mini Burger with Cheese - $5.50, $0.50 to add cheese. Other than cheese, I only add lettuce and tomatoes. The first time I ate at Super Duper, I went with the Mini, because I just wanted to give it a try before committing to their Super Burger. When I received my order and chomped my way through it, I realized that a 4 oz. patty is a very good size for a typical lunch. If I were famished or somehow skipped a meal, I would go for the Super Burger - $7.75.\nThe burgers are all cooked medium. The patty is very juicy and thin with cheese melted over the patty. The sesame bun is perfectly toasted. The lettuce and tomatoes always taste fresh. I find the Super Sauce to be very creamy with a mild flavor that doesn't compete with the flavor of the patty. When it comes to a good burger, this one hits all the criteria I'm looking for...\n1) juicy beef patty\n2) cheese melted over patty\n3) toasted bun\n4) fresh lettuce & tomatoes (no iceberg lettuce)\nCheck, check, check, check. Great!\n\nMost toppings, like pickles & grilled onions, are free if you request them. Others, like avocado and egg, cost an extra $1 - $1.50. So extra toppings can really add up. But I usually just like a simple burger and don't go for too many add-ons, except for an egg.\n\nMr. Joy says Super Duper is just okay, because it is too greasy. I was surprised to hear this from the fried chicken & French fry connoisseur.\nWell, the sauce and the meat juices from the patty give way to gravity, so that explains the grease factor. But what good burger is not greasy? Like I mentioned above, aren't burgers supposed to be greasy? As long as it is not swimming in a pool of oil, I'm happy.\n\n$3.25 Garlic Fries - fresh garlic & 6-mon. aged cheddar:\nvery tasty, thin, & crispy. The shredded cheddar adds great flavor, but it doesn't stick to the fries, so it's a little easier to eat with a fork or spoon to get a bite of fries & cheddar together.\n\n$5.75 Super Shake:\nTheir dairy is made with Straus products. I have only tried a shake once, but it was way too sweet for me. I may go for a cone instead in the future. \n\nAfter my first couple of times eating here, I noticed Super Duper has very long lines at lunch. I usually try to get lunch by 11:30 to avoid lines. After you order and receive your beeper, it takes about another 10 minutes to get your food.\nOverall, Super Duper is pretty great, very tasty & affordable. But, cheese costs extra. I realize that is ubiquitous for most burger places nowadays, but I think burger + cheese go hand in hand, like bread & butter, or pb & j. How can you have one without the other?\nOther than that, I have no complaints.", "author": "Joy W."}

Upon walking in, I immediately thought to myself, \"Is this Shake Shack?\" with their shake options and seemingly similar set up. I will say that Super Duper is probably an extension and higher level version of your normal In-N-Out/Five Guys, and is at par with Shake Shack in terms of ingredient quality.  \n\nFOOD: Late at night, I did not want to eat much so I only got the Mini-burger with cheese and grilled onions. The burger quality was good with a \"secret sauce\" on it, which was quite delicious. The burger was cooked medium (as they advertise on the wall), which is great for me. The ingredients also tasted quite well, but I will say that the meat they use at Super Duper is not as lean as I would have hoped for, but still good nonetheless. A little messy, but what is a good burger without a little bit of the mess?

After he talked to them briefly, he came back and said that they've got the order, but they're just backed up on chicken orders... I look over to the grill, and don't see any chicken breasts on there; just a bunch of beef patties for people who ordered after me since at this point, everyone that ordered ahead of me was long gone.

Lettuce, tomato, red onion, jalape\u00f1o peppers, grilled onions, pickles and \"super sauce\" can all be added for free; cheese, bacon, avocado, roasted portobello, egg, and cambozola can be added with cost.\n\nSuper Duper Burger: A.\nI ordered this with lettuce, tomato, red onion, super sauce, egg. Very nicely done. The patties were delicious - these are branded as \"all natural\" beef and I could definitely taste the difference comparing with those from big chain burger joints. Not only the meat quality, but those medium rare patties were extremely tender and juicy - yes it's super messy to eat but definitely worth it. The Super Sauce actually enhanced the burger taste even more. If you feel hungry, adding an egg would be a brilliant idea. This specific combination of egg and beef in a burger was not something I have experienced before.\n\nFries with 3 dips: A\nThe three dips (chipotle, mayo, super sauce) cost $1.5 and came in three small cups. Nothing special about them though, I won't get those next time. The fries were in thick-cut shape; simply put, it's thick version of In-N-Out fries, slightly more crispy, and the same strong natural potato flavor. Love it!\n\nThere are a lot more locations for Super Duper but this is probably the most convenient. When I want to grab something quick after long hours shopping, this is the place to go!", "author": "Simon C."}

We spent about 13 dollars on a double patty burger with cheese on top, garlic fries, and a drink, which wasn't so bad considering it was enough to feed two. I was pleasantly surprised by the intensity of the flavor and the melted cheese. Often cheese overwhelms the flavor, but this cheese melted into the burger making it even more delicious.\n\nThe garlic fries had some cheese and lots of garlic flavor. Easily the best garlic fries I've had in a burger place. I think the cheese really makes it work. I didn't have a chance to try a shake but I'll undoubtedly be back to a Super Duper Burgers sometime soon.", "author": "Kevin L."}

I've actually been to a few different locations, but I just happened to be at this one most recently.\n\nMy standard order is a mini burger + cheese + mushrooms and garlic fries. The burger is always juicy, messy, and delicious; they tend to be a bit stingy with the garlic on the fries though. The cookies and cream shake is also thick and delicious, but I try not to be too much of a fatty every single time. I've also tried their chicken sandwich, which was actually surprisingly good but only offered at certain locations.\n\nI recently discovered that they serve breakfast too! I tried the egg sandwich + sausage and a mini glazed donut. The egg sandwich hit the spot exactly. The mini donut, though, was a bit oily and tasted too much like fried dough vs a donut. And yes, I know, a donut IS essentially fried dough, but the good ones are fluffy and have a particular taste - sweeter and more similar to a pastry. They also have fresh-squeezed orange juice for breakfast, if you want to try and feel healthier.\n\nI don't come here often, but it's exactly what I'm looking for when I'm craving a quick and dirty burger!", "author": "Tiffany P."}

It's grilled and comes with a giant lettuce leaf and I often use the leaf as my \"bun\" - in essence I eat a naked chicken sandwich. My boyfriend loves the ciabatta bun so he doubles up on his bun game. Chicken portion sizes vary, but the quality is never too dry. \n\nAdd pickles because they're bomb as well. \n\nOnly qualm is the wait for the order - it ranges from anywhere from 5 mins to upwards of 10 mins.

Fresh garlic and six-month aged cheddar? Of course.\n\nI grab a seat. Eating alone is the best thing, by the way. You can stuff your face and not have to worry about carrying a conversation. Also, if people catch you eating like a pig and you're alone... Well, it probably explains why you're eating alone in the first place.\n\nThe first bite was orgasmic. The fries were amazing. Every bite was orgasmic. Whoever came up with the idea of their garlic fries deserves an award. I don't care what award. Those things were off the hook.\n\nI contemplated ordering another burger and fries. After all, I worked out hard, right? It was that amazing. My first meh experience was erased. I walked away happier than a pig rolling around in poop. And I cannot wait to go there again.", "author": "Xerxes N."}

Good thing I protein styled it so I had the opportunity to enjoy the juice (not water) of the beef more. You can significantly tell if it's organic or not and this was truly an organic bite.\n* Garlic Fries | FINALLY my craving was satisfied. The fries were semi thick and crunchy. In addition, the garlic gave it a great kick and the cheese was a great compliment.\n\nCustomer Service: Our orders were served quick. The price of the burgers were on the high end of the $ but understandable since it is organic.\n\nOverall: \n4 stars. The price was reasonable, service was good, the food was delicious, and the feel was comforting.I couldn't give it 5 stars because it lacked a grand famous signature. Thank you Super Duper Burgers for ending my SF trip on a good note.\n\nAdvice:\n* Good place for a quality organic burger.Protein style it if you want to be carb friendly and to prevent that food coma.\n* Ask for everything on it so you can get you pay for.", "author": "Leland S."}

There is plenty of seating inside and a small patio. There's also a 2nd floor! You order at the counter and pick up your food there too.\n\nWe were able to split a super burger between 2 people and we added avocado to spoil ourselves. The patty was juice and flavorful.

I wouldn't have gotten a burger in SF if it weren't for a friend of a friend who took our group here!\n\nMy boyfriend had the super duper burger (2 patties) while I had the mini burger with cheese and added avocado to it; we also had a side of garlic fries to share. Both of us had our burgers cooked medium rare and they came out perfectly! The mini burger ain't mini; it's as hefty as an average sized burger at a restaurant. It definitely filled me up. The burger was juicy, but not to the point where grease was oozing out of the burger. But you do need a ton of napkins though! We asked for extra Super Duper Sauce on the side to dip our fries in; sooooo good!\n\nI could have done without the garlic fries though. They literally just added cheese, garlic, andherbs on top of the fries. I had to rip off bits of cheese just to make sure I could evenly distribute it to all the fries. Their fries were super crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside; I'm a fries fanatic so this screams YES.\n\nTheir homemade pickles were interesting. They were more vinegar-y which isn't my preference but they are pretty good pickles.\n\nThe restaurant has an industrial feel with high ceilings and dim lighting as you move farther into the store. Seating is difficult at this location but they do have an upstairs deck for additional seating that is much quieter than the first floor.\n\nOverall, you're getting fresh and flavorful burgers with huge portions at a great price.

Actually, I would have preferred to feel like I do after having shakes most days, when the thing is heavy, bad for you happiness.  Instead, I finished this shake and mostly went about my day, after of course consuming all of the crumbled cookie scattered throughout the cup.  $6 and change was about right for this serving size and the line moved just as fast as the service to make the shake, so I was in and out (but thankfully not at In and Out, where the shakes are only good, not amazing) in less than 10 minutes at the end of a busy lunch hour serving Dreamforce customers.\n\nWishing this could be added to my rotation in Chicago, but I'll live with it being a really good option for future visits.", "author": "Justin B."}

The burgers were flavorless, not a sign of salt or seasoning, combined with cold french fries.  My 2 patty burger came with one piece of wilted/oily lettuce that was mostly shoved in the bottom of the paper wrap and not on the burger.  'Secret Sauce'?  It's mayo with nothing added to it.  I also love pickles.  I'm not sure what was going on with their brine, but these were just horrible!\nI had taken about 2 bites of my burger and decided to just give it to the homeless outside.  The manager asked what was wrong when I went to the counter for a togo container.  She was kind enough to refund our money and offered to make us 'better burgers' for free.  We said no.  Shouldn't we have gotten 'good burgers' to begin with?  (and honestly what were they gonna do different?)  \nMy GF is a burger fiend.......This is the first time I've EVER heard her say a burger made her 'sad'!

We shared an order of garlic fries ($3), which contains fresh garlic and 6 month aged cheddar. \n- The patty was nicely toasted and the burger had a decent amount of cheese. The vegetables were fresh and adequately soaked up any of the meat juice. \n- Garlic fries are some of the best garlic fries I've tasted.

For one person this can be a meal in itself and is made for sharing with at least 2 people.

I ordered the \"mini\" burger which is really a normal sized burger with one patty instead of two (super duper burger). I added an organic egg and also got a side of garlic fries. The burger was delicious!!!! The buns were perfectly toasted and the patty was juicy and meaty. The burger was pretty greasy and I had egg yolk and sauce dripping down my hands as I ate. The egg was a great addition to the burger. It definitely satisfied my craving for a fat, juicy burger. The garlic fries were also deliciously tasty. They were LOADED with garlic and cheese and possibly had more garlic than actual fries! \n\nA cool thing about this place is that they also serve wine and beer on tap. You can also get your milkshake SPIKED!! I didn't have any alcohol or milkshakes, but I like the fact that they serve them.

Cost wise, it seemed pretty fair. If you love pickles like me, you could totally have them over their condiments counter. Staff was ok. The cashier was friendly but I felt rushed eating since one of the guys would literally ask often if they could take my tray. It was 830 so I guess they were getting ready for close?? \n\nThe Mini Burger was ok, quantity wise, it's perfect to leave you feeling full without being overwhelmed. The sesame bun complemented the meat. The patty was a little dry though, could have marinated the meat more to push its flavor. It was juicy yes, but without the bun and everything else it wouldn't strike as much. The garlic fries were better. So, the fries had aged cheese which I loved, and the fries were just cooked right without being soggy or too crisp. It came off a bit greasy but at least I had beer to wash it down.

The table location was in a bad spot  because it was right next to the growing line of people trying to place their order. \n\nOur food did take awhile to be cooked but we were  not in a hurry and enjoyed the rest from a days worth of walking the city. My meal was the super salad, dressing on the side and a beef patty. It was a fresh tasting salad that reminded me of my parent's garden in Ohio. My husband ordered the a bacon cheese burger with garlic fries. The garlic fries seemed promising but they disappointed both of us. His burger was on point.\n\nI loved this place because everything is pretty much recycled. Also there are free pickles. :)", "author": "Amanda K."}

If you can get past that, you might like it. I ordered the mini burger meal and upgraded to garlic fries and got the trio of dips. Nearly $20 but I was starving and didn't care. You get free refills of soft drinks and they hand you a buzzer so you can collect your food when it's ready. \n\nI'm not going to lie, I didn't rate my burger. I would describe it as pretty bland (something I think seems to be kind of common with US burgers, I also think the same of In n Out and Five Guys. Get some meat with flavour please and slap some burger sauce on there!). It had nice lettuce and tomato on it though, and it was cooked med-rate. It filled the hole I had after standing in line for 3 hours at passport control to get into the US (still crying). \n\nWhat I DID rate was the garlic fries. These are EPIC. I love the little chunks of cheese over them and of course they are super garlicky. Sorry to anyone I see today.

I have been here about a dozen times. This place is fairly popular and at their busier hours, the seating can get scarce. They have seating in the front, at the counter, and upstairs. They have bathrooms way in the back and you have to ask the people behind the counter for the code (R.I.P. free bathrooms) to punch in.\n\nThey have beef, chicken, and vegetarian burgers. They even have sliders (mini burgers). In addition to burgers, they have salads, milkshakes, regular fries, garlic fries, house made lemonade, and ice cream cones. They have a breakfast menu limited to morning hours. I never tried any of their breakfast items so I can't comment on it. Super Duper Burgers are a bit on the pricier side for a burger joint but in almost all of the times I have visited, I have been happy with the quality of the food. \n\nThere are refrigerated bottled drinks, drinks by tap, and a fountain drink machine. Instead of regular napkins, there are paper towel dispensers. There is compost bin in addition to a regular trash bin. They have mustard, ketchup, and I think mayonnaise condiment containers with pumps next to the fountain machine. You can get complimentary house made pickles from the plastic barrel container near by the condiments. The pickles are slightly spicy so you will need some water. They make a nice substitute if you are not interested in a side of fries. \n\nI had their veggie burger twice and enjoyed it. It comes with hummus and cucumbers. Both times, I had it with the everything option. I prefer it without the cucumbers. The patty is flavorful and sturdy (not mushy or fragile to the point where it comes all apart in your hand and pieces are on your lap). I love their fries because they are always hot and perfectly fried (crispy and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside). Quality and quantity has been consistent except for the last visit. This last visit, I somehow ended up with a small portion and the fries were not as hot as I would have liked. \n\nI have only tried their fresh strawberry milkshake to go. It came in a 16 oz container. It was creamy with bits of real strawberry pieces. Next time, I will try their cookies and cream milkshake. Overall this place is pretty good and a solid choice for me to go to if I am in the area with a hungry belly.", "author": "S A."}

The cashier, Yesenia, repeated back to me that the burgers come with lettuce, tomato, and their special sauce, \"What else would you like on it?\" I explained I just wanted everything on it (like the menu listed). Then she asked me the same question again, lecturing that the burgers come with lettuce, tomato, and special sauce. I told her I was confused because I wanted the option on the menu and again she repeated the same refrain to me. She got pretty short and frustrated with me and all I wanted was something listed on the menu.

You can't compare it to the fancy burger you'd get at a great restaurant; and you can't compare it the lousy burger you get at a generic burger place like McDonalds. You can only compare it to other new-and-improved burger places, like Shake Shack or Portland's Burgerville.\n\nAnd in that pantheon, Super Duper does well. Its burgers are solid and delicious, but it doesn't have nearly as many options as you find at Shake Shack or Burgerville, so you I can't give it a five-star rating.

Not to mention the bacon and available premium blue cheese...\n\nThird, because for the quality they're quite affordable. No, this isn't Burger King, thank GOD.

I guess you could argue that if they can't make a good veggie burger they shouldn't, but seriously, that's on the menu as a courtesy to vegetarians.  That's like complaining about a hot dog from a Mexican restaurant.\n\nBut that's beside the point.  Super Duper Burgers is a place I wish I had more time to explore, because the menu is intriguing.  As it stands I only had a chance to test out the Super Burger and fries, but the ice cream, shakes, garlic fries, and pickles sound good and I wish I had a chance to try them.\n\nSDB follows the new tradition of restaurants having a very industrial d\u00e9cor.  There is a great deal of space in the two story food spot that it doesn't feel like seating or space would be much of a problem.  Prices aren't terrible, it's typical for being a step above fast food at around $10-15 per person.\n\nAs I said above, I just got the Super Burger with fries.  I had added cheese and an egg to the burger (must put an egg on it), and it was delicious.  It was fresh tasting and juicy and flavorful.  The only real disappointments were that the egg didn't really add anything and I got the thick part of the lettuce, which isn't always pleasant biting into.\n\nI figured out about the egg, though.  All the pictures I saw seem to show a fried egg, capable of running away with your tongue.  Mine was done over hard, likely because it was a to-go order and you don't want the egg popping and leaking all throughout the box.  I understand why they have to do this...it just reduces the impact of the egg.\n\nFries were good, nice and crispy, not too salty.  Can someone please explain to me how In-N-Out still manages to get away with such crappy fries when so many other places know how to do it right?\n\nI'd love to try out their malts and other menu items, though sadly I likely will not be back any time soon.

It's one of my favorite burger spots, but man, did they let me down.\n\nThis weekend I was out in the city with my girlfriend and her sister and when it was time to grab something to eat I didn't hesitate to suggest going to super duper. My girlfriends sister never had a burger from there before so I made sure she had to try it. I kept raving and hyping it up because my past experiences there were always great.\n\nUnfortunately, this experience was a disappointment. The burger was not as juicy as I remembered. Meat was a sad slab of overcooked. I thought they left out all the veggies and I had to open up the bun just to find measly pieces of lettuce and tomatoes. The pickles, which are my favorites there, were soft and seemed to have been pickled too long. The ones I remember eating were crunchy and complimented the burger very well, but these were bad. \n\nI'm actually pretty embarrassed to have suggested this place to my girlfriend's sister. She even said she would rather have in and out than this burger... And the funny thing is that I couldn't disagree with her. That burger I ate that day was definitely worse than an in and out burger. \n\nI don't know why this particular spot wasn't as good as the others I've been to but damn y'all let me down. \n\nOn top of that, the orders were all mixed up and people before us got their orders first. I had to run up to the cashier and ask about my order.. \n\nWould I be back? After that experience I'm not sure especially when I pay a premium compared to other burger places. Bring back the good, familiar experience I've had before and I'll always come back..", "author": "Michael T."}

From Shake Shack (I am a regular) to In N Out to Five Guys... to the Black Label Burger, I am always stuffing my face with a burger.\nI was curious to try this place. I had been told by a friend that it was rather greasy, but told by another friend that it was fantastic. I decided to give it a shot.\nI ordered the Super Duper Burger and the garlic fries, and waited for about 10 min. They finally called my number and handed me a paper bag that smelled like a wonderful burger and amazing fries. I walked back to my hotel and started devouring my food. \nThe burger was delicious, but I would say that Shake Shack and In N Out have juicier burgers. The garlic fries really do stand out though. The garlic really enhances the flavor of the fries, and goes well with the ketchup.

They are known for that as well but that is not what I ordered today. I ordered the mini burger (1 4oz patty) which came with lettuce, tomato, onion and their special sauce. I also asked for an organic egg added on top (about an extra $1 or so) with a side of garlic fries. As I waited for my food to come, I noticed that there were way too many people to the number of tables and chairs they provided. Strangers were muzzled up against each other and many awkward customers had to shyly ask multiple groups if their chairs were being used. Unfortunately, many stood up to enjoy this deliciousness. But that didn't stop them. \n\nMy number buzzed and I finally got to try this delicious beast. The egg looked freshly cracked with a runny yolk. The thinly sliced tomatoes and lettuce made a great blanket to hold up the patty. The patty was thick (compared to other fast food joints). The burger buns were warm but thick and springy. The sauce was an absolute NEED for this burger. And I must say, the moment I placed my bun on top of the egg and watched the yolk run down like a waterfall was the best moment of this experience. (WARNING: If you are not into messy burgers, foods, hands, hair, shirt, pants, etc. don't bother ordering the egg, this shit was a fucking mess.) The burger was delicious upon first bite, but getting all the sauce swiped across my face was not cutting it for me. I ended up using a fork to eat my burger... so sad.. but still so delicious.\nThe garlic fries were meh. Pretty soggy, pretty garlicy, and somewhat cheesy.\nThey also gave out free samples of donuts!! WHOOT!\n\nI left this place with burger sauce on my shirt, cheese and garlic in my hair, pickle juice on my pants and the regret of not buying a cone. Next time cone...

It was busy and though service was swift, food cake really late. I had to wait 10 minutes after ordering to dine in. \n\nI had the Mini with cheese and bacon, and regular toppings. Nothing to rave about the burger. It's sloppy at best.

Those are bomb. One star extra for that. They have a Mexican mix cheese topping for the fries.

Then like a pro, I ask them to add that free range egg too. I can ball out an extra $1.50 for an aesthetic AND nutritious upgrade for my burger.\n\nStep 2: Make it a combo!\nI get the Garlic Fries but pass on the dipping sauces option. I won't need it. Then I order a Cookies&Cream milkshake and ask them to SPIKE it like a volleyball. As a law-abiding citizen, I also show them my ID so that they know that I am indeed over 21 years of age.\n\nStep 3: Find a Seat!\nI like sitting upstairs because walking up the steps helps to burn off a portion of the 2350972057 calories I am about to intake. But at night, I find that sitting outside is more fun. Laughs and High Fives won't intensely echo if you're outside. \n\nStep 4: Pimp My Burger\nThe reason why I don't need the dipping sauces for the fries is because I'll be stuffing my burger with the Garlic Fries. I make sure to get all those cheese and garlic crumbs straight into my burger too.\n\nStep 5: Social Media\nGiving big props to Super Duper for their interior lighting because it's PERFECT for Instagram. Snap your picture, post it, and enjoy your epic burger as you watch your 'Likes' pour in : )\n(No kidding, i got over 60 likes from a Super Duper post #CareerHigh)\n\nThe only caveat is that Super Duper is a bit pricey for what it is. If you go through my 5 easy steps, your bill can easily run up to 16 or 17 bucks. It's worth it, but it's definitely a jump from Mickey D's.", "author": "Ringo M."}

We were having a hard time choosing an eatery (a problem that usually thrives in big group hangouts). A friend suggested this place, and we ended up choosing here really really last minute. That friend knew what's up because my mind and stomach was blown away by the juicy scrumptious burger and cheesy garlic fries. \n\nBeing a total noob and inability to choose from the menu, I searched on yelp to see what's good. Thanks to the awesome pictures and reviews from fellow yelpers, I knew exactly what to get. \n\nI ordered the mini burger with cheese, bacon, avocado, egg, and jalapeno peppers. Without onions and tomato. Also got the garlic fries to share with a friend. I was worried that the mini burger would not make me full, but boy was I wrong! I've never had an egg on a burger before! But I wasn't too worried since I love egg. My burger was gigantic!! It came with a knife and a fork!! So that's saying something. I was wondering why I was the only one who received that but after comparing the sizes between my friends and mine, I knew why. I didn't even bother using the knife and fork. A burger is something to be eaten with your bare hands and to bite down and let all the juice flow down your hands, to be licked later. And that is exactly what I did. Although I did struggle fitting the first few bites in my mouth, I still managed to devour the entire burger with burger juice dripping down my hands the entire time. It's all a part of the experience and what makes eating burgers more enjoyable, in my opinion. The garlic fries were also amazing as well. An order is big enough to share between 2... 3 is a little bit too much. There will probably be some hand slapping going on if you share between 3 people. \n\nMy friends just got the regular burgers with no additional add-ons. Honestly, I think that is a little boring hahaha. The cashier asked me if I've been here before after hearing my order. I told him it was my first time, and he was surprised because usually the regulars know how to customize their burgers like I did. And I brought up Yelp. \n\nThey also have a jar of pickles that they made/grown/homemade, located by the fountain drink station. Also, there are some peppers for all my spicy lovers, if the jalapeno isn't enough hahaha. \n\nParking is definitely the most horrendous thing ever; obviously it's because this location is literally located in SF downtown and what crazy soul loves driving in that mess of a traffic. Honestly, it is the only thing preventing me from coming here again.

I wasn't blown away by the food (personally, I'd take an In-n-Out burger over it any day), but the design, atmosphere, and service makes for a great experience overall. The high ceiling allows for a second floor seating area, which you can access via the stairs below a giant wood-paneled cow. The feel is very clean, modern, and hip. It's the little things like classic shake glasses (even the water cups are actual glasses) and smiling cashiers that lend Super Duper its inviting presence. My cashier asked if it was my first time eating here and gave me a huge \"Welcome!\" when I affirmed.\n\nAlright. So I lied a little bit earlier. The Garlic Fries ALMOST knocked my ankle socks off. Even if you're like me and tend to avoid cheese whenever we can help it, the fries manage to soak up all its good aromas. Add a little chipotle sauce and - perfect flavor. \n\nNow, you'd expect that the bathrooms might be the one place where a busy fast food joint might start cracking under pressure. Not so - the two unisex bathrooms are large and pretty much empty other than the bright orange paint on the walls. Which lays bare all surfaces for inspection.

It wasn't too crispy or burnt, cooked enough so when you take a bite of the burger the whole bacon doesn't come out with it. The bacon wasn't the cheap thin bacon that you get at other fast food joints either, it was thick and had plenty of pieces so you get a piece in ever bite. The burger was  big, big enough  that I couldn't finish all of it. \n\nNow that I think of it, all of the ingredients were not your cheap ingredients like other fast food joints. From the cheddar to the patty, everything tasted more high end.\n\nThe garlic fries were pretty good, kind of wish they put a little more garlic.

I tried the mini super duper burger (1 patty) with garlic fries and an ice cream swirl. The burger was very flavorful however it was really, really greasy. As I ate towards the bottom of the burger, which was tightly packed, the grease had made that crispy burger bun soggy. More attention to the greasy detail before they plate the food would be nice. However, the garlic fries were so full of fresh garlic, parmesan cheese & parsley that I'm sure the person across the street would be blown away by the post-fries breath. The fries were crispy which held up nicely against the heavy toppings. The ice cream swirl was refreshing and didn't feel like you were eating anything too heavy. Great for a hot day!

They have a really nice set up, and kind of reminds me of a Chipotle Mexican Grill. They have two levels and the whole place is really spacious. They have bar tables right when you walk in and also plenty of tables both first and second floors.\n\nTheir burgers are really nice. You get to choose between mini burgers (1 patty) and super burger (2 patties). Of course, I went with super burger. Go big or go home right? Almost all of their toppings are free except for their bacon, cheese, avocado, mushrooms, and egg. With my order, I asked to have everything on it with bacon, cheese, and egg to top it off. My order is an open faced burger due to all my toppings added and it came out really good. The burger patties were cooked perfectly and the egg made it a lot better in my opinion.\n\nYou also need to try their garlic fries and MUST order the 3 dips with it. The additional charge for those 3 dips is worth it. You'll get super sauce, homemade mayo, and chipotle sauce. The chipotle and super sauce are perfect pair for their garlic fries. Trust me, you'll never regret it.\n\nOne more good thing about this burger join is that they have a station for their condiments. What I like about it is they have this homemade spicy pickles. It's a good thing to munch on every after bite on your burger, that is if you're not one of those people who hates pickles. \n\nI'm only giving this joint 4 stars because of their price. The burgers without additional toppings are priced just right but the price will get sorta out of hand once you start requesting for the other toppings that has additional charges. Regardless of the price being on the expensive side after the extra toppings, it is worth a try.

I have been looking for a place that has this. They use premium ingredients, even in their shakes! Their price reflects their quality.

In general, I'm not a really big burger fan and I know Super Duper is a chain so I wasn't expecting much.  Immediately after entering, I found that there was no line and I was greeted with a smile.  \n\nEverything on the menu is pretty affordable.  I ordered the single patty cheeseburger with garlic fries.  Condiments such as pickles, ketchup, and mustard are offered to the right of the register and they have plenty of seating.  You're able to add avocado, an egg, or bacon to your burger for an additional cost.  \n\nThe burger came and was pretty standard.  The burger was pretty filling without being overwhelmingly huge which I appreciated.  The garlic fries came with cheese on top which added a lot of flavor.  The cheese seemed like it overpowered the garlic to me.  \n\nOverall, Super Duper Burgers is a great option if you're craving a good burger.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-12-13", "description": "Today was a fun day at @SantaCon SF 2015, until our day was ruined by the workers/manager(partner) by their horrible mistreatment of our lost Iphone 6, and negligence in handling the entire situation.\n\nWe ate dinner at Super Duper Burger located at 721 Market St\nSan Francisco, CA 9410. Around 645-715 PM, after finishing our food, we went to, the Starbucks across the street, at around 740 we noticed our cell phone was gone and had left it at Super Duper Burger. After quickly returning to Super Duper Burger, we find the same people who were sitting at the table we were at and asked them about a lost phone. Which they then replied that they returned it to the cashier at the front of the store.\n\nThinking that we would be able to get our phone back, we quickly rush to the front to ask if there had been any lost phones. Which then they replied that no phones had been turned in at all. Which completely contradicts the other customers who specifically told us they turned in the phone.\n\nA few minutes later, one cashier walks in from outside, who was conveniently on break, when our phone was lost. The worker then is asked whether or not he saw a lost phone, which then he says no he hasn't. And then when we brought the witness who said he turned in the phone, the employee then claimed that he accidentally gave the phone to another couple that said they had lost a white iphone. WITHOUT verifying at all whether or not it was actually theirs by passcode, details of the phone, or any proof of ownership. Then claiming that it is their store policy to treat lost phones that way. That if anybody tells them they lost something, they give it to that person no questions asked. Completely negligent and ridiculous business practice. \n\nSo during the 25 minutes that we left to grab a coffee after dinner, our phone was turned, by WITNESSES, in to the cashier, and then he apparently negligently gave it to the first person who asked for a lost iphone, without any verification.\n\nHere's where the story gets worse. At this point an Asian man, starts to get tempered. He claimed that he worked with corporate, and an assistant manager said that he was a partner of some kind. He starts to yell at me and my girlfriend and yells inside the store completely escalating the situation. There is video evidence of this man yelling in the store, berating me and my girlfriend, and yelling at random customers. Then every time somebody told him to calm down, he would get into the face of RANDOM CUSTOMERS. Every person that tried to calm him down got yelled at, berated, and completely disrespected by this man. I do not know what affiliation this man had with the store other than him claiming that he was part of corporate, none of the employees would disclose any information about the \"man who is always here and is a partner with an owner.\" \n\nWhile all of this is happening, the assistant managers and employees on the floor acted in the rudest possible manner not taking ANY RESPONSIBILITY for their actions. They did not ONCE question the worker who took the phone, blaming me and my girlfriend, paying customers, for causing a commotion, while all we wanted was some justice. Instead of trying to solve the issue with the cashier, the instead put the blame on us.\n\nWe won't accuse the cashier who collected the phone of stealing, but we will accuse him of NEGLIGENCE if his story is true, that he gave it to the first person who asked for a lost white iPhone, WITHOUT asking for verification, passcode, or even seeing that the background was a picture of my girlfriend and I. That should not and is not common practice for items turned into any lost and found. And if I was a employee in his place, I would want to make sure the right owner had something that costs so much.\n\nWith that being said, it's suspicious that the phone was turned off, right after the other customers gave it to the cashier, then the cashier went on break, but right before he left he was able to give the phone to another couple \"on accident.\" Not to mention he lied about receiving a lost phone in the first place.\n\nI would like to be contacted by the corporate office of Super Duper Burgers to discuss this situation, because we believe that the employees of Super Duper Burger was negligent in treating a lost phone that was turned into the cashier, and lost with less than 20 minutes of handling time. We believe that because the iPhone 6 was in your employee's possession, he is responsible for the loss of the phone. It was irresponsible to give the phone to another person without any verification of ownership. And if this is common practice, AS YOUR OWN ASSISTANT MANAGERS STATED, you might want to let them know to use some common sense.", "author": "Kenneth L."}

But boy was I wrong. I wasn't satisfied after devouring my greasy burger. The meat quality is on point, very fresh, and cooked to a perfect medium. Burger toppings (lettuce, tomato, etc) were very fresh and crisp, although skimpy. I only had one measly slice of tomato. Also, when I ordered my burger with avocado (additional $1), it seemed like they only gave one-fourth of an avocado -- very little. However, I love love love the free pickles!\n\nThe garlic fries are worth a try, but the portion is small. Both garlic fries and regular fries were EXTREMELY oily that I had to squeeze the excess oil out onto a napkin. I found it rather disgusting and unpleasant. And because the fries were so oily, they weren't as crispy as I hoped. The three sauces for additional $1 is worth a try, but I wouldn't get them again. It's just super super sauce (basically thousand island), chipotle, and mayo. Their shakes are really thick and sweet, but extremely over-priced. Super Duper also offers chicken burgers, veggie burgers, and salads... but really, who goes to Super Duper to order a salad?\n\nService is really fast. Cashiers are quick, though a bit rude.

Gross.\n\nDespite my overdose of salt this week thankfully I had no thoughts of eating anybody's face but I did have thoughts of eating a double cheeseburger at Super Duper.  I ordered the combo:\n\nDouble Cheeseburger:  the burger was good. No complaints.  Cooked to medium unless specified otherwise.  I didn't feel like requesting medium rare like I usually do.  Perfectly acceptable burger for the price.  I believe I spent around $12 for the combo.\n\nGarlic Fries:  these however were too salty for my taste.  Salty like Miley Cyrus ever increasing saltiness towards Justin Bieber. Maybe next time I'll order regular fries.  \n\nA few things I found Super about this spot:\n\nThe homemade pickles.  Hella sour but I love pickles and I appreciate that they offer them.  The staff is friendly and seem to keep the place running smoothly.

One of my personal favorites is the super burger with everything on it, including, caramelized onions and an egg on top. The combination of perfectly melted American or Swiss cheese, combined with a sunny side up egg, creates just a delicious burger, that will definitely get you messy. Highly recommended at least seven or eight napkins for that meal.\n\nAnother perk of eating here is the fact that they give you the option of free crispy juicy pickles and jalapeno peppers to go along with your meal.

This location is on Market Street near the Ferry Building and Union Square.  The restaurant is setup like a fast food joint where you order at the counter and the prices are not too bad--more expensive than other upscale fast food burger spots like The Habit, Five Guys Burgers and Fries and Fatburger but also less expensive than sit-down spots like Umami Burger and The Counter.\n\nBurgers can be built like The Counter where you customize toppings to your liking.  Super Duper Burger touts the quality of their beef and chicken and their sandwiches looked good.  Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to try their burgers, but I did try their organic soft serve from Straus.\n\nTheir soft serve is available in cups and cones.  They have vanilla, chocolate and vanilla chocolate swirl.  You can also get their soft serve dipped in chocolate too.  I opted for their vanilla chocolate swirl and it was good.  The first thing that was really noticeable was just how pronounced the dairy was.  So many soft serve options out there have so much artificial flavoring that the dairy/milk/cream kind of gets lost in it.  You also get a nicely thick, dense and cold soft serve that is similar to Foster's Freeze and not the bright white, light soft serve of Dairy Queen, IKEA and McDonald's.\n\nThe vanilla flavor was good.  While it was not as good as a great vanilla bean ice cream, the vanilla flavor was noticeable and much more satisfying than the simply sweet cream flavors offered by many soft serve places.  The chocolate flavor was okay.  It was mild in flavor and not that rich or chocolatey.  Maybe it would have been better if I had just ordered the chocolate by itself and not in the swirl.\n\nThe cone was good too--light, crisp and fresh.\n\nSuper Duper Burgers' soft serve can also be used in several flavors of milkshakes here including strawberries and cookies and cream (in addition to vanilla and chocolate).\n\nService was excellent here--quick, polite and noticeably friendly.\n\nTheir soft serve prices are not bad.  Their soft serve is more expensive than a fast food joint (understandable though given that the quality is significantly better too).  Their soft serve is also slightly less expensive than the similar Straus soft serve at Gott's Roadside in the Ferry Building.\n\nThis Super Duper Burgers has a modern and industrial look and while there seems to be a fair amount of seating (including some tables outside), it gets really busy here and finding an open table can be difficult.\n\nSuper Duper Burgers' soft serve is a great and reasonably priced frozen treat.  It is one of the best soft serve cones I have had in a while.  Their burgers also look good and given the big crowds here, Super Duper Burgers is probably a good option for lunch in Union Square.\n\nDue to its location near Union Square, there is not much parking around Super Duper Burgers.  There are a few pay parking structures and lots around here and they are pricey.  Metered street parking near the Ferry Building is also available.", "author": "Anthony N."}

There will be a line, and you will have to hunt for a table. I have no idea where to park to come here, but I didn't feel it was worth it. The garlic fries are good, but the extra sauces did not impress, nor did the homemade limp pickles.\n\nI went here on a Tuesday evening after flying in to SF with my wife. The incredible number of positive reviews on Yelp immediately drew us here.  We waited about 5 minutes in line before we placed our order. Since I wanted to do a thorough review, I ordered the Super Duper Burger (which is the same as the mini, but with two patties), bacon, avocado, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, cheese, jalapenos, and sauce. My wife got the mini burger with cheese and most of the sides, as well. We also got the garlic cheese fries with the three sauces and a glass of the old vine Zinfandel on tap. We had to stand around a bit before we pounced on a table that opened up.\n\nSoon, our food was ready and we were diving in. First bite: ok. Maybe I missed some ingredients. Second bite: ok. Let me try this again. Third bite: ok. And that was that. The burgers are fresh and high quality, but they don't taste like much. It was shocking.  The garlic cheese fries are better, but super greasy and very strong flavored. The extra sauces were good, but can hardly justify $1.50. The total bill for everything was around $30, which was a bit on the high side given that it's like a Chipotle for burgers.

I always bring my out of town relatives/friends here and it easily becomes their favorite burger joint. But this morning I came in for breakfast and got a Mini Combo with sandwich (+cheese), mini donut, and small coffee. Price is advertised as $5.50... total comes out to $6.53. So I hand the cashier my card to pay and as I'm signing, I ask the cashier \"are your prices still $5.50?\" At this point I'm just curious since I already paid. \nHer: Are you talking to me?\nMe: Yes...... \nHer: No, we raised them \nMe:But all your signs posted advertise $5.50\n(She picks up the sign to look)\nHer: Ohh you have to remember tax\nMe: tax is only about 10%, so it should be 50 cents at most\nno reply from her... She hands me my receipt and I walk away to wait for my food. I look at my itemized receipt as I wait and come to see that prices are still $5.50 as advertised, but cheese is an extra 50 cents and I also got charged for a bag I didn't ask for. Which is all fine, but i don't get why the cashier couldn't explain it to me.\n\nSuper Duper is still one of my favorite places and customer service is almost always excellent.

Quickly, our resolution changed to \"oh, that's good, we can have a mini burger aka slider here and then grab a salad from somewhere else\". As you may be able to guess, we ended up ordering a full meal with a burger and garlic fries and the homemade lemonade and all I can say is: Who needs salad when you can have burgers and especially garlic fries from Super Duper? Seriously, you need to try the garlic fries. The lemonade is a tad too sweet for my taste and yes, the burgers are greasy (but also tasty!), but nevertheless this is definitely one of the better burger places I've been to.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-27", "description": "Super Duper completely exceeded my expectations for the typical burger-fries-milkshake American meal. The location is so convenient (on Market, smack dab in the middle of Montgomery and Powell Bart), and it's definitely not as pedestrian as the Westfield food court or as touristy as anything right next to Union Square. \n\nThe. Food. Is. Awesome. The patties here are all cooked to medium, and though I usually get medium rare, my medium patty was juicy and savory to the point of perfection. If you're here, you might as well get the whole shebang: garlic fries and a milkshake (please get the chocolate/strawberry swirl!) are a must. The free homemade pickles are crispy, fresh, and tasty. I don't even like pickles, and I enjoyed eating them here. \n\n**TIP** Get the egg. Seriously, if you like eggs and you've never tried it on a burger, I'm making this decision for you. Get the egg. Yes, it gets runny, and you might need about 10 extra napkins, but at the end of the day you'll be very satisfied with your (my) decision. They give you a fork and knife with the egg-burger too (I guess they know how messy it can get), but I'd advise just going for it with your hands. \n\nAs for the service, I had a really great experience with the workers here -- they look happy to work here, and mine actually struck up a minute-long conversation with me! I rarely get that level of friendliness in any restaurant, let alone a burger joint, so I was very pleasantly surprised. \n\nOne of the only negative aspects I can think of is how expensive the burger is. Maybe I just have some residual feelings from a childhood of cheap McDonald's and In-N-Out burgers... The base price for the single-patty mini burger isn't too bad ($5) but add-ons are pretty expensive (cheese is $.50, bacon/avocado/egg/etc are $1 each). I decided to go all out with my burger and added cheese, avocado, and egg -- the result was delicious, but made my wallet (and my arteries) cry. If you're feeling up to it, you can also order the \"super burger\" ($7), which is the same as the mini except with an extra patty.\n\nThe line also gets really long. We arrived around 6pm on a weekday and it wasn't too bad, but around 6:30 the line was almost out the door. Fortunately, the line moves quickly. It'll be difficult to get seating around that peak hours, too, although many people order to go. \n\nOverall, Super Duper is a wonderful place that definitely hits the spot for burger cravings. It's certainly worth a visit, especially if you're in the area!", "author": "Christine L."}

The bacon isn't the best bang for your dollar--it buys you about one chopped up piece of bacon sprinkled in the center of the burger. \n\nThe real star of the show is the garlic fries, for sure. To make it the most cost effective trip, get a mini burger with cheese and use that extra $3 you saved from the super duper burger and bacon to buy EXTRA garlic fries. Seriously. We all know the burger is just there so you can take a break from eating the fries.", "author": "Joseph Y."}

I'll walk you through my experience.\n\nI am walking toward the BART station and I see Super Duper Burgers. First, just the aesthetic was appealing. I love the look of the place and it just looked really clean. Well I realized I hadn't eaten all day so I decided to stop in and have a bite.\n\nFirst thing I notice is that there are a lot of people and it's a bit crowded, but not too bad to the point where it turns me off. There was a very short line so that was nice. Well I look at the prices and while I have to admit the prices were a little bit high, they weren't ridiculous. I was hungry and I was willing to pay $100 for a sandwich.\n\nSo I get to the counter and I can absolutely say that the guy that rung me up was one of the nicest cashiers I've ordered from. I've had a lot of really nice cashiers and he was up there on my list.\n\nWait time took a little bit, it's not McDonalds, but it didn't take forever like other places I've been to. It was about average wait time. Just enough time to make me a little bit hungrier and getting my stomach ready.\n\nMy order is ready and I pick it up and the girl handing me the order was really nice to. I concluded that this food establishment has the best and nicest people working there. Truly lovely people.\n\nWell I leave and eat my sandwich at the BART station. I ordered the Chicken Sandwich with Avocado. I took the first bite, and oh my goodness. The chipotle sauce (I think it was) was spicy but so delicious. I didn't expect such a spiciness, but it was totally worth it. The lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bread and everything in the sandwich looked and tasted so fresh. I was thoroughly surprised. I finished the sandwich so fast out of hunger and I am still in shock of how good it was. The spice is still lingering on my tongue and lips, but ahh I want more!\n\nAmazing place I would go out of my way to go to.

Its location in Union Square was super convenient because we were looking for a cheaper, faster restaurant in the area to eat at. While there is usually a line, it moved fairly quickly. It's a bit tricky finding seating because there were so many people there, but there weren't too many people just standing around the restaurant waiting to sit. \n\nThe guy who took our order was really nice - even asked about our day and what our plans were for the evening. Definitely a plus. My boyfriend ordered the Super Burger with cheese and a fried egg, and I got the Mini Burger with cheese. We also split an order of the garlic fries.\n\nEverything was delicious. The patties were cooked exactly how I like my burger patties to be cooked - slightly pink in the middle. The buns were nice and filling, and the veggies were fresh as well. My boyfriend really liked the Super Sauce as well. Everything tasted flavorful and fresh, no complaints. The garlic fries were possibly the best fries I've ever had. They weren't too greasy and had so much aged cheddar on them, making them rich and delicious. They also weren't salty - something that I'm usually afraid of when I order fries with add-ons. Another plus were the house-made pickles they had in the jars next to the soda fountains. They were crunchy and delicious, and I got to snack on them before getting our order.\n\nDefinitely would come back here.

Also, the two patties combined looked about the same size as my one Mini Burger patty, which is weird because supposedly all the patties are 4 oz.

I like my burgers relatively plain so I can't speak for the sauce, but my sister-in-law seems to really love it.\n\nIf you're a picky eater (like we are) just know that the burgers automatically come with sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapenos, and pickles, so if you want to alter that just let them know. You can also add avocado, mushroom, egg, and bleu cheese for an addition buck or buck and a half.

That way, not only could we smell our own food, but everyone else's as well.  Although the burger wasn't quite perfect, it was pretty damn good.  Even with all the extras I added, you could taste that the patty had some flavor to it, and that it was pretty juicy without being oily.  The burger was good on its own, but the bacon, avocado, cheese, and grilled onions (included) just made it that much better.  And the garlic fries?  Loved them.  While some places can be too light/heavy with the garlic, this one was perfect.  Also, plus points for the service - despite my burger apparently missing the avocado (other than the small slice at the end), one of the workers was nice enough to give me more without making me prove it was missing.\n\nFor me, the only thing that really holds them back is the price.  The burger itself is not all that bad ($6.50 for the Super), but it sure can add up with the extras.  After throwing in the bacon, avocado, and cheese, I hit the $10 mark, which approaches \"gourmet burger\" territory.  Compared to a few of those in the city, Super Duper falls a little short.  Still, $10 isn't terrible for a good burger, and they definitely beat out places like Mel's in that price range.  Plus, gotta give them their due for using 100% compostable or reusable packaging/materials.\n\nAnd by the way, did you know there are multiple locations now in SF?  I sure didn't.  That is, until after I had already circled the one in the Castro a near dozen times, parked (finally), walked in, called my friend, and then realized that she was actually at this location instead.  Whoops!  But even with that mishap, the burger made up for it...and then some.", "author": "Mike L."}

I visited Super Duper my last night in San Francisco with a Co-worker and I am so glad that I did.  At first I was apprehensive because it was super packed but then I had to remind myself that I was not in my hometown and they seemed to have a pretty efficient method of dealing with the crowd.\n\n   While I was waiting in line I notice that most people were walking around with these really big burgers and so when it was my turn to order I asked the cashier if then had a smaller version of what I was seeing.  Lucky for me they had a mini meal for $9.25.  So I order the mini  to go with grilled chicken sandwich and I substituted my fries for garlic fries.  It took about 10 minutes to get my food which was understandable given the crowd size.  \n\n   Walking back to the hotel made me want to try the food even more because The aromas from the food kept emanating from the bag penetrating my nose.  Suffice it to say when I was settled back in my room I dove right into my food.  It was really good. It was dare I say...super duper.  \n\n   I got full half way through my meal caught the itis and went to sleep.  If anyone would have saw me the next morning I would have been really embarrassed.  I woke up from a food coma, in my draws, with food wrappers laying next to me. Luckily I packed great toothpaste and bodywash because smelling like day old garlic fries is not cute.\n\nHere's my advice for anyone contemplating eating at Super Duper:\n\n1.) Don't think about it just live in the moment and buy that fat ass burger.\n2.) Do not eat your meal near a bed because you may catch the itis and wake up from a food coma smelling like garlic fries.\n3.) Have strong, mints, toothpaste whatever on deck for the after affects of your meal\n4.) Stop reading reviews and go experience Super Duper!", "author": "Whitney J."}

(SPLAT!)... nah, it's a bird. ...but a pretty tasty bird or wait, I mean a cow. I'm so confused. Honestly, Super Duper is pitched somewhere between super and duper, but at least it's a marked improvement over its smaller sister operation in the Castro. What you get here are pretty decent-priced burgers - messy, juicy 1/2-lb of meat that adds up when you request anything beyond the basic lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and whatever their super sauce is (...distant cousin of Jack-in-the-Box's long-ago secret sauce perhaps?) - on your burger.\n\nI call it the Joe's Cable Car nickel-and-dime-me-to-death approach, but alas, the practice looks to be more common with these specialty burger joints. Needless to say, I am all about the extras. I went to town and ordered the $6.50 Super Burger with the basics plus bacon, cheese, and an organic fried egg on top - each a dollar extra (see photo). It was a sloppy pile hard to pick up, but I assume I need to take accountability for that decision. It was tasty enough - far better than the flat, mealy patty I had at the Castro location some time back - but a lot of work with a lot of napkins. Not very green friendly, am I?\n\nThe $2 side of fries were an unconditional hit though (see photo). Piping hot and not greasy. The place is surprisingly spacious and crowds up quickly on a Friday evening, even the small loft section on the second floor. Jamie W. was thrilled about the $2 fountain Diet Cokes since the possibilities for refills were endless. We were tempted by the $3.25 soft serve cones but finally showed some discretion once we stuffed our faces. BTW - I hate the cheap aluminum chairs. However, the location is too convenient not to come back here. Super Duper? Not quite but good enough.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...good, messy burger even though the extras add up\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...space to make a mess, for sure\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...they smile a lot here\nTOTAL - 4 stars...worth a stop when you hanker for some higher-end fast food", "author": "Ed U."}

Simple, but has that fresh organic taste to it.\n\nBelieve it or not though, my favorite burger that I got to try is their Fried Portabello.  That was seriously good!

Keep plenty of napkins ready for that one.\n\nAnd you definitely should get a Spiked Cookies N' Cream Shake with your burger.

The garlic fries are good by them selves but add in the Super Duper sauce and it is fricking amazing. To be honest I don't know what the Super Duper sauce is and I can't really describe it.

While they have special donuts and special coffee on the menu, what I really appreciate is the breakfast sandwich. It comes in a toasty English muffin (good start), the egg is cooked and folded like an omelette is supposed to be cooked: on a griddle far away from a microwave, (more points), you have the option of adding cheese and/or bacon (more points), and it costs around $4 (the rest of the points). Most other breakfast sandwiches in this area will cost you $6-$8 and make you feel like a cheesed-out over-ingrediented anvil, rendering you useless for the remainder of the morning. This egg sammy is the perfect size to satisfy your salty breakfast needs and tide you over until lunch without making you crave a nap. \n\nThe burgers are pretty darn good -- juicy, nice ingredients to choose from in order to create your ideal burger. I find the mini size is sufficient enough to fill me up, but you have the option of getting a larger slab of cow with the Super burger if you so please. If you aren't feeling like a slab of beef, I hear their chicken sandwich is quite good as well. Vegetarians can get into it too since their veggie burgers are delicious and come complete with hummus and yummy patties. \n\nSome fringe pros: \n- The fries are great -- not too thick and not too skinny. You have the option of getting garlic fries, too.\n - You get all the darn pickles that you can eat! \n- They have lemon slices and sparkling water to jazz up your \"Just water, please\" drink order. \n\nI'm hungry.", "author": "Chelsea B."}

Who says that in the middle of a perfectly good conversation? You can't blame blackout drunkenness this time. There is no excuse.\n\nNevertheless, you've already put it out there, and you can't take it back, and Super Duper is luckily (?) just across the street, so that is where you and your unfortunate comrades go. You order the garlic fries, and the strawberry shake to dip them in for good measure. \n\nThey arrive. They are perfection. \n\nYou may have sent the evening in completely the wrong direction, but it was a delicious direction.\n\n***\n\nMorning-after revelations:\n\n- The ideal crispiness/mushiness ratio of fries is hotly debated amongst drunk and sober fry-eaters alike, but at least for me, these were just right. A bit crispy on the outside, nice and soft on the inside.\n- The garlic atop the fries really was incredible. Freshly minced, juicy, and astonishingly high in volume. You will probably smell like garlic for the rest of your life, and it will be worth it.\n- Ordering the strawberry shake over the vanilla shake was a rash and ultimately disappointing chocie.

It was chilly outside and they kept the front door propped open, so it was chilly inside too. Luckily they had outdoor heaters that were on so we opted to sit on the patio.\n\nAfter briefly reading the reviews, I ordered the Mini Burger because I didn't want 2 patties, my boyfriend went for the Chicken Sandwich and we shared an order of fries. If I didn't have to head back to work shortly after, I would have liked to have tried the garlic fries but I figured I better spare my coworkers the after breath.\n\nThe food came out reasonably fast and was good, but not wow me good. I actually liked the fries better than I liked my burger. It was on the greasy side which was a little disappointing. I tried my bf's chicken sandwich, I honestly think it was better than the burger. It had a spicy sauce, think bacon and a different bun.\n\nThis area of town has a TON of homeless and we quickly learned why we were the only people sitting out on the patio - we were constantly approached and asked for money. We did help out the first girl who approached us, however she got angry and threw a fit because we only gave her $2. Seriously?? The next 2 guys that approached didn't seem to want to leave us alone either. The manager actually called the police because the homeless were bothering the customers inside as well. Within minutes an officer was on site, at least they have little tolerance for how it may negatively impact business.\n\nI'd possibly eat here again but I wouldn't call it Super Duper, nor would I rate it the best burger in 2013.", "author": "Kayla M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-04-16", "description": "Fresh, simple and delish. \n\nMy husband and I had a rare afternoon to ourselves so we headed out to SF for the day. We started at the Ferry Building and enjoyed the Farmer's Market, but nothing spoke to us for a sit down meal. Thanks to a quick search on Yelp the fabulous reviews led our feet about a mile from the waterfront to Super Duper Burger on Market. \n\nThe interior is really cool and utilitarian - open, simple, clean. The menu was clear and offered a great variety. There is a portabello sandwich option for vegetarians and I have to say, if it wasn't for the siren song of the beef, I would have given it a whirl. They also have a veggie burger, chicken sandwich and salads. As a spectacle-wearer the menu behind the counter was also large and clear for reading. YAY! The service was friendly, fun and helpful. The prices were really reasonable considering it's organic, fresh and in the city. \n\nThe burgers are Neiman Ranch beef. The fries are SUPER tasty as well. Sometimes when we go places it seems that one item is good, but the other is so-so. At Super Duper it's all, well, SUPER DUPER! The burger was cooked to a perfect and juicy medium. I ordered mine (the mini 4oz) with everything - including onion, tomato and lettuce. I also included the sauce (sort of thousand islandy) which was tasty and applied neither too thick or too thin - just right! The red onion was perfecto! I love a the zippy zing that sliced onions provide, but too often find that restaurants slice their onions too thick so it's all you can taste or have to spend a lot of time getting your fingers stinky picking off the right amount. Super Duper slices their red onion SUPER thin so you get that delicate zinginess without dragon breath or BO fingers. :D\n\nOne of the best parts for me was the pickle. I ALWAYS have to have pickle slices on my burgers. I think it's because most burgers are not that juicy/tasty without them and I love the extra crunch. I have to say that the Super Duper burger was so juicy and tasty that I didn't even need to add the pickles, however, I did help myself to many to crunch on because they are house-made and absolutely lip-smacking delish! I wonder if they would consider selling a small jar........? \n\nSince it was a date with my fella, he bought me a chocolate milkshake made with organic Straus creamery ice cream. :o) I was positively stuffed, but it was poifect!! \n\nA note to beer drinkers.... there is beer on tap. When we went Racer 5 (hubby's fave) and Scrimshaw were on tap. A pretty awesome beer selection, if you're so inclined. They are a Coke establishment, so if you're like me and prefer Pepsi, just know that in advance... you can have water, milkshake or a beer....or a milkshake! Wait, I said that already. \n\nHonestly, I have to say this is the best burger and fries I've had at a \"fast food\" place. I look forward to going back very soon!! Their only fault (and my waistline's saving grace) is they are only located in San Francisco and not closer to where I live. \n\nIf you get the opportunity, I highly recommend running, not walking, to Super Duper!", "author": "Andrea R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-20", "description": "I first went to Super Duper Burger with some co-workers while looking for a good burger to eat during lunch in the SoMa district. Being relatively new to the Bay Area my co-workers had ordered here several times while it was my first. Super Duper Burger is located on a relatively busy Market street between 3rd and 4th streets.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've ordered at this establishment three times.\n\nFOOD: Each time I've ordered at Super Duper Burger I've gotten the Vegetarian Burger. Let me start off with that I'm not a vegetarian. I've tried it before for a month and what I took away from that month is trying to eat less meat than I used to. I also found that vegetarian burger alternatives are often very delicious. Black bean burgers are some of the best I've ever had. Super Duper Burgers vegetarian option is also very delicious which is why I've ordered it several times. I do plan on eventually trying on of their normal burgers. You can either order for pick-up or sit down at the restaurant. They offer several add-ons and condiments for your burger. The also offer free pickle wedges to snack on while waiting for you order. I'm a huge pickle fan so I often indulge in several. I don't think Super Duper Burger is the best you'll ever have but I do think its a much better options than fast food burgers.\n\nDRINK: Super Duper Burger offers a variety of fountain drinks and also has a bar with several beers on tap. They also have happy hour which I've heard is a very good deal but I haven't had the chance to stop by for it yet. I don't order drinks while at Super Duper since I just walk back to the office to eat so I can't personally review any of them.\n\nATMOSPHERE: I'd say Super Duper has a pretty standard restaurant atmosphere. Lots of people sitting down and talking while enjoying their food. A line of customers waiting to order. I guess it's a little larger than I normally expect for a burger joint since they offer a good amount of seating but I can't say anything sticks out about the atmosphere worth mentioning. Nothing special, just a normal enjoyable atmosphere.\n\nSTAFF: Even if you sit down to eat you do so after you've ordered your food so there is no waiter at the tables. I've never spoken to the staff more than just ordering my food or picking it up but those experiences have always been pleasant.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nSuper Duper Burger is a great place to stop if you're in the mood for a good burger that's definitely better than any fast food options. I find the price to be very reasonable for the food received. I've ended up here about once every 2-3 weeks and I think this trend will continue. There's also another location in the Financial district a few blocks down if you work in that area.", "author": "Christopher D."}

Best part about the burger is the slightly toasted bun. Seriously, why don't more restaurants toast their buns? Toasted buns are always better. The patty itself is very tender and juicy, but I wish it was cooked medium-rare instead of just straight up medium. I feel like that's really the only thing keeping this burger back from being one of the best of the best.\n\nFries were delicious. They're the kind of fries where you just can't stop eating them, no matter how much you want to stop. Addiction at it's finest and I was hooked from the first bite. The three dips aren't really worth it. $1.50 for three very small cups of dip, and the chipotle dip was the only one worth it. Being honest though, the fries here don't even need any dressings. They're perfect as is. \n\nPretty nice place for a quick bite in the city.

Super Duper is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nTheir patties were bouncy and juicy. All cooked to a perfect medium with a lot of pink inside. Even the so called 'mini' burgers have good thick 4oz patties. Just the basic version with only the free toppings already tasted excellent. Extra like bacon, mushroom and cheese were really just icing on the cake.\n\nThe only thing I still want is probably some crazy good veggie burger like the 'shroom burger from Shake Shack with the legendary cirsp-fried portobello 'patty'.

The price is worth it too: $4.75 for a mini (one patty) and $6.75 for a Super (double patty).

One is at Gott's Roadside near Napa, the other is at The Onion Grill in Lombard, IL (sadly, closed). \n\nThese burgers are so juicy and delicious, they don't even need condiments to be enjoyed, but the fresh lettuce, tomato and onion really balance the beef. \n\nSome uncultured plebeian had the audacity to call these burgers too \"greasy.\" Honestly, Yelp needs to screen people to determine whether they even know what they are talking about before they can post a review. Burgers are not GREASY...Burgers are JUICY...And that's a good quality for burgers to have. To slight a magnificently juicy burger means that you have no idea what you are talking about and should just go back to reviewing salad spots. \n\nThe other amazing thing here:  Milkshakes made with Strauss Family Creamery ice cream and milk. Just thinking about sucking down one of these shakes has me gulping in anticipation. \n\nLastly, the pickle situation. This is the only flaw in an otherwise perfect burger experience. Burgers without pickles should just be called \"ground-beef sandwiches.\" Burgers need pickles to survive. I love the fact that I can grab as many pickles as I please. But, the pickles are roughly cut, and most are too thick to easily fit on top of an already tottering burger. I have to either take the time to root through my pickle stock for thinly cut pickles to add, or I have to balance chunkier pickle pieces on the edge of my burger before taking a bite.

However, now that I've returned a few times, my opinion & waistline have grown. Before I gush out my love for the burgers and awesome garlic fries, there are few things you must know.  \n\nThis is a greasy spoon for sure. Don't even kid yourself about this one. The food is super greasy here, so just go if you're ok with a couple post-meal burps. Secondly, the line can get long especially at lunch hour during the week, so it's best to get it to go or have a dedicated swooper to grab a table if one becomes available.\n\nNow for the good stuff. Super Duper delivers solid burgers quickly at a reasonable price in downtown. This is enough to bring me here occasionally. On top of that, they are great about getting orders right and you can add cheese, avocado, egg, and other things, all of which are fantastic. To top things off, they make great fries, I live getting the garlic fries, which are lightly sprinkled with cheese. They are the bomb! \n\nSuper Duper is really just a solid place to get a good burger at a good price. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but as long as I work in the neighborhood, I'll definitely be dropping by.", "author": "Nicolas H."}

The menu was brief but comprehensive. Due to how concise the selection was, the ordering process went fairly smooth. All the cashier had to do was ask me some short questions of how I wanted my food and all I had to do was say yes or no. Straight to the point is how I like it. \n\nThe burger was superb! It was crispy on the outside and nice and juicy in the middle. I loved the texture of the burger and rich taste. The restaurant has a second story seating area, that, although very small, is fun to sit at in order to overlook the entire place. The soda that I had was extremely carbonated, which, I enjoyed so much! The carbonation in my sprite was much stronger than most other fountain machines. I really enjoyed that part so much.

I don't care if I have to use my gadget legs to get down Market, strong go go gadget legs because my feet are all stuck to the pee.  \n\nThe staff were friendly, but not cloyingly so.

We ordered at the counter and the total was under $15. \n\nHmm...if I had to compare Super Duper to In'n'Out then I'd choose In'n'Out. Super Duper burgers are good and tasty BUT so damn messy and GREASY. My god! My bf unwrapped some of the paper off the bun and I had to pick up some napkins to wipe the grease off the bun. I further unwrapped the paper and saw a pile of grease and juice at the bottom of the wrappings It was so unappetizing. Needless to say, I only had one bite. It was a delicious bite, but I'd rather my burger NOT come with a side of future high cholesterol spike. \n\nThe fries were really great! They weren't too thin or too thick. They were fried perfectly and I LOVED all the garlic bits they added. They weren't kidding when they said these were garlic fries; the garlic is really all up in there! \n\nBottom line: All in all, Super Duper Burgers was ok. It wasn't too expensive and really filled us up before our next meal. We were glad to try it but I don't know if I'll return if I'm back in the city.

While there's been some phenomenal burgers from fancier joints that demand a higher $$, the genius in the Super  Burger here is that it's real simple and sticks to fundamentals. Starts with juicy, fatty ground beef, cooked to a perfect medium, and then double stacked. The condiments are simple: lettuce, tomato, onions, and sauce. The burger is not afraid to be greasy, and the bread shows it.

But I managed to remedy that problem with a salt packet. As for the Garlic fries with cheddar, they were so good! The minced garlic just makes the fries taste so much better and enhances the flavor by many folds. I would come back just to get the fries!

Their garlic fries were also SO good!  They will even cut the burger for you bc they prob know that two people can share one burger.  I like their jar of sliced pickles, too - yummy.

A burger for sure was at the very top of my list and Super Duper was squarely on my list.\n\nFirst the pros.\n\nQuality beef, and they cook it to medium without even having to ask.

I'm not an expert in the science of pickles, but these to me anyway had me doing my happy dance.\n\nBeer and wine served here. The goody two shoes at In n Out shun happy drinks in favor of empty calorie soda drinks and shakes.\n\nNow for the cons.\n\nThe price, sadly for a fast food outlet this place is expensive. Roughly twice the price for a comparable order at In n Out. Super Duper is Super Expensive.\n\nThe special sauce. Eh, it's fine but for me I prefer good old fashioned thousand island.

Once I walked inside I immediately knew I made the right decision. I was impressed by the setup and the menu. \n\nI ordered a fresh strawberries shake, which wasn't too thick and was very delicious. To eat, I ordered a super burger which was about $6, had two patties, and was rather huge. It was a struggle to eat all of it!  I should have ordered the mini burger -- the name is deceiving since it's actually the size of a normal size burger. \n\nThe great thing about their burgers is that you can customize them with various toppings. For example, jalape\u00f1os, grilled onions, an egg, etc.\n\nThis is a really great alternative to other fast food places in the area. The food isn't greasy and since they claim that their food is organic it gives you the illusion of eating semi-healthy. \n\nEven if you are not a big fan of fast food, I recommend that you check it out. The burgers are really good and affordable. (I've had $15 gourmet burgers that weren't as good as the one I had at Super Duper Burgers.) Also, the staff is rather friendly.

I feel it's important to preface with this because I find that, most of the time, when one of my vegetarian friends tells us meat eaters that this one vegetarian burger tastes just like the real thing, we default to smiling nervously and backing away slowly. It's not that we don't believe you, it's just that we have this strong suspicion that you may have forgotten by now what meat is actually supposed to taste like. In fact, if that tofu-veggie patty is anything to judge by, we're sure of it. And while there's nothing at all wrong with that, we're going to have to politely decline your invitation to your weekend vegetarian barbecue.\n\nThat's why, when I say that the veggie burger here is amazeballs, my fellow meat-eaters are not allowed to grimace and tell me they're just going to stick with the grass-fed beef, thanks.\n\nThis veggie burger tastes nothing like real meat. Seriously, not a thing. But it's thick and hearty and made of black beans -- which is about as inoffensive as substitute ingredients get -- and it makes a damn good burger. Like, a DAMN good burger. It's just as tasty and filling as its meaty counterpart, while making no claims of tasting like anything but a black bean patty full of delicious spices.

The place looks nice; it has a bit of a warehouse vibe in a cool way. The menu is simple enough for most people who just want to stop for a burger. However, it does come out a bit expensive; it IS sf after all.\n\nThe food:\nSuper burger ($7) with cheese ($1) and bacon ($1.50)\n-I was debating on whether to get the mini or super. I would stick with the Mini in the future. The super is basically a double double, but it was just too much meat (in a gross and overwhelming way). The burger was juicy and delicious nonetheless.\n\nGarlic fries ($3.25?) + 3 dips ($1.50)\n-I could definitely live without this in the future. It was fine. I would have preferred more garlic, but I always do. I'm also not a big fries fan. The cheese on top was generous though. The three dips were also pretty excessive since the free ketchup is already very delicious. I didn't end up making much of a dent in the dips, but it was a good try. \n\nPickles (FREE)\n-Their pickles are put in jars and it is self-serve. They were awesome.\n\nMy meal came to about $17 with tip. It was decent. Not memorable enough to want to return.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

The line moved very quickly.\n\nThe cashier was very friendly. She quickly took my order. She was also detailed in insuring that the order was correct. I ordered a Super Burger plus bacon and cheese with tomato, lettuce, and their special sauce.\n\nA sign stated that the food was prepared to order and to expect a ten minute wait.\nThis is pretty much the amount of time it took. If anything, it was a little quicker than this.\n\nThe burger was very good. The super is their standard burger. It is made with 8 oz of Niman Ranch beef. It is a double.\n\nYou can select from numerous toppings:\nlettuce\ntomato\nred onions\nsuper sauce\njalapeno peppers\ngrilled onions\npickles.\n\nFor a buck each, you can add any of these:\navocado\none organic egg\ngrilled peppers\nroasted portobello\ncambozola blue\n\nIf I was eating in, I would've paid the greenback and added an egg. But I didn't think it would hold up on the walk home. I will try it next time.\n\nThe burger was cooked medium. The bun was a sesame bun. It is one of those buns that is more like two tops than a top and a bottom. All of the condiments were fresh.  Quality meat + quality condiments + a good bun = pretty darn good burger - If I had a complaint, I think it could have used some additional sauce. \n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/89jab5k\n\nI also ordered fries. These were skinny fries. They were pretty good.\n\nThe ambiance is stream-lined, modern, and functional. There are two levels of seating.\n\nThe food was all neatly packed in a bag with an easy to carry handle.\n\nWithout a drink, the total came to just over $11. So, it is not a cheap burger and fries. But I think it was definitely worth it. While it will not take over the #1 spot for San Francisco's burgers. I think Super Duper makes it into the top 15, maybe even the top 10.", "author": "Mark D."}

When our super duper burgers with egg arrived at our table, I was certain that I was going to experience a hamburgasm.  Instead it was like a half-arse lap dance.  As soon as you take the first bite, the egg leaks and coats the whole burger (and your hands) with yolk.  Usually I dig runny egg yolk but in this case it just made a mess of things.  The beef was just ok.  At most premium burger joints, the quality of the beef really stands out.  It didn't at Super Duper.  We also ordered the garlic fries and they were fine.

As I pondered that, someone who came in after me grabbed the last remaining table.   Lesson learned.\n\nThankfully, by the time my food was ready, another table opened up.

A fresh lemonade completed the meal, which hit the spot.\n\nAltogether I spent about $10 for a meal that would have cost me less than $5 at Burger King or In-N-Out.

At the low end (well, by SF standards of pricing!), Super Duper Burgers is a good contrast to disappointing Little Griddle.\n\nI had thought of ordering the veggie burger but the \"special sauce\" was mayonnaise, which I loathe. Got chicken burger, with cheese and avocado and no mayonnaise (they can call it chipotle aioli or anything else, it's still mayonnaise!) Also shared order of fries with my sister. A pre-check of the menu showed they don't serve tea so I brought my own. Got a shake (the double chocolate) for after.\n\nOften burgers, especially chicken, are dry and rely on mayonnaise to make them less so. I was glad that the chicken burger was moist and had good flavor. Pickles were fabulous, I'm normally not a big pickle fan but I ate two dishes of them! I wish, however, that they had a side salad available. \n\nBTW, young man at counter, stop apologizing! I asked for paper menu as I could not read board, and he apologized. Dude, it's not your fault I'm near-sighted! I asked several questions and he apologized with each answer. I finally told him that I don't know who told him to keep apologizing, so far as I was concerned, he was doing his job answering questions and no need to apologize. And then he apologized again!\n\nShake - not Ben and Jerry's to be sure, better not to know what was in it, not that cream is exactly health food. But how can a double chocolate shake not taste good?\n\nMaybe not super duper but good. Worth coming to for a quick burger meal.

They use good beef and it's got lots of flavor. I ordered it with all the standard toppings and it did not disappoint.\nFries - cooked well, nice crispness on the outside and a fluffy inside.\nPickles - lightly briney, not overly sour and really great spices in their pickling mix.  The flavoring is on the light side compared to the intensity of the vlasic and the more common grocery store brands.\n\nWas it worth it?\nI got the mini combo and it was like 10 bucks, pretty average I'd say.  I think it's worth paying more to try the milkshakes, garlic fries and premium toppings.\n\nCool spot?\nSo I thought it was inside the Metreon but the door is actually outside on Market.  Don't walk the perimeter looking for it like I did :p Once you get inside though it's quite spacious which is a good thing since there are like a million people.

We bolted out of the office around 11:50am and made it to the line at 12:00pm.  It was already at the door when we arrived.  I'm used to lunch lines in New York, but not San Francisco.  Total wait time ended up being about 10-15 minutes.\n\nThe good:  The food.  The menu is pretty intense with the toppings you can add.  which makes it a pretty messy burger.  I went with the 8oz with super sauce, cheese, and a fried egg.  it comes separted, so you have to do the juggling act of putting it together.  \n\nThe burger is some of the best hamburger meat i've ever had.  JUICY!  Really Juicy!  The fried egg, oh yeah, damn good add on.  The bun could be a bit better.  It was the biggest disappointment.  Just seemed bland.  Regardless, the burger was pretty solid.

The friendship sadly ended but the ice-cream remains a testament to SuperDuper's effort.\n\nNowadays, probably because of their quick expansion to the Marina and Downtown, lack of management skills (I have anecdotal evidence of this), and lack of staffing, I'm getting \"warm\" hamburgers and burnt buns, attitude from the employees when I complain, and a place that looks dirtier and dirtier every time I come back.\n\nMy story:\nWith my \"for here\" order, upon being given a compostable plastic cup (a one time disposable), I had to ask to get a glass glass (c'mon, guys, I am not being extra picky here -- this IS 2012 and San Francisco's Castro).

Not only do you have a few more options than a place like In-N-Out but you also have beer and vegetarian options. The staff is always friendly even when there's a line out the door which shows their professionalism and makes me want to come back. \n\nI've been here a few times and every time I've felt full and content with just a regular cheeseburger and some fries. The fries are nothing amazing, pretty standard but good at the same time. The garlic fries are good but mostly just the regular fries piled with garlic. The burgers are made fresh and have always been consistent when I've been. I like how they give you free pickles at the ketchup counter...it just shows they aren't stingy and any time I get something free without asking at a restaurant I give them an extra point in my imaginary book. \n\nThe veggie burgers are just as good as the hamburgers, in a different way of course but juicy and comparable. Some places have dry gross veggie patties but not this place. \n\nIf you feel like getting a fast, cheap, filling meal this place is for you. It beats any McDonald's or Burger King that's for sure.

They have a mini combo which would be the same price (and you would get a drink) but it only includes the normal fries. I don't think that price is ridiculous seeing as it's much better quality than your normal fast food joint. There were no available tables inside so I had to sit outside. It was a beautiful day so I didn't mind but I can see why people would be upset over that. The burger was delicious, I love that you can add grilled onions for no extra charge. I was sadly a little disappointed in the garlic fries. The amount of cheese was almost overwhelming and definitely took away from the garlic taste.

But they'll give you the option to serve you the food first, then you can come back and pick up your soft serve/dipped cone after you've finished eating. Genius! I love their strauss organic soft serve and LOVELOVELOVE that they offer chocolate dipped cones so I am completely sold.

My co-workers and I were lucky enough to make it to Super Duper just before the madness hit. \n\nFood: I ordered a mini burger (which is essentially the same size as a regular burger, only 1 patty) and added on everything except for peppers (cheese was an additional fifty cents) and a chocolate milkshake with fresh strawberries blended into it. The food was decent for the price; it's about $6 for the burger and about $5 for the milkshake. The burger was nothing too special, and I personally think it was a little bit on the dry side. The shake however, was really yummy; I like how they use Straus milk for their shakes, and it was not thick at all--definitely drinkable from a straw. I could really taste the fresh strawberries in the shake, and it wasn't too sweet as most milkshakes are. Nice balance with the burger, and the shake came in a pretty large cup. \n\nOne unique thing that I really enjoyed about this place was the fact that Super Duper makes its own pickles; you can add as many pickles as you like by the beverage fountain. Being the pickle fanatic that I am, I scooped out a good amount, and the pickles complemented my food nicely. \n\nService and ambiance: Service was quick, which I appreciated. By the time I ordered, I only had to wait 7 minutes or so to get my food. It gets pretty loud there since there is a lot of people, and sometimes it can be hard to find a seat. \n\nOverall, it was a nice place to grab lunch with my co-workers during our break, but I don't think I would come here on my own or with friends if I don't have to. I feel like there are definitely other places to try in the Bay Area and Super Duper didn't impress me to the point where I would come back again and again.", "author": "Andrea X."}

Don't be fooled by the long lines people.\n\n2.  The food was not only SUPER good, but it was super affordable.  For a 4 oz burger it was going for about $4.50.  And come on, in downtown SF, who can say they have had a SUPER DUPER yummy burger for less than $15?!  The size was perfect.  It was just enough burger to fill me up.\n\n3.  The offered garlic parmesan fries.  Another all time favorite of mine.\n\n4.  Best for last - whatever that special sauce or spread was, it was yummy!

Imo, it always comes down to the meat being fresh not frozen hockey put..  \n\nNow, what I like about Super is that the meat seems fresh, definitely not a hockey put.  However, its really oily, which I don't mind, hey more fat for building testosterone :)  The toppings are fresh and the sauce does make the burger complete.  The interesting thing is that the sauce is very similar to a Big Mac sauce (aka Thousand Island).   The fries are pretty much identical to In-N-Out, which I'm not a fan of.  From a price point, there meal deal for a Super Duper (two patty burger) burger, small drink, and fries at $10 is really good, especially for being in Union Square.   \n\nOverall, its a decent burger, not great, not bad and really close to work which makes it convenient; also its hands down better than Bistro Burger (for all of you that work in the Financial District).  Now if you want the best burger ever, you got to go to Val's in Hayward.

We ordered the Mini Burger (single beef patty) combo (comes with fries and a drink) with extra bacon, and their Super Burger (double beef patties) with extra cheese (two slices). Atmosphere was good, service was friendly and quick. There were no empty tables when we finished ordering but the turnaround was pretty quick; most people seemed to eat really fast and leave quickly. You can pretty much choose your own drinks after you ordered as they will give you an empty cup and you'll have to fill it up at the drink station (soft drinks, water, ice tea). So burgers were good but not as great as burgers we had in other places such as New York. The Super burger was oily so it was messy to eat. Mini burger was good; the bacon made it good!

Luckily it wasn't that extensive but only up to the right side of CVS/pharmacy. The wait was probably about 15-20 minutes but it was worth it.\n\nThe free burger was about the size of the frozen chicken breast sandwiches at Costco but the comparison is in no way related to the quality of the burger. I was with a friend and when we ordered the burger with the works and cheese, it took about 5 minutes before two wrapped burgers plopped onto the silver tray. At first glance, it seemed like the tray was very lonely, missing fries and a beverages but we opted not to get fries for $2 and soda for $2. From eyeing other tables, the fries look promising. Soda, well...high fructose corn syrup can only get stuff your system (bleh). \n\nThe ambiance of the cafe/dark Jamba Juice-esque interior is spacious but on a peak lunch hour, seating may get competitive.

I went here for dinner last week with a friend, and have gotten my order down to a science:  Mini Burger with bacon, avocado, super sauce, and grilled onions.  I also had a side of fries to go with my burger.  I can't tell you how amazing their food is.  My friend also got a mini burger and got a Cookies & Cream shake and had it spiked.  It was delicious!  The line here wasn't too bad, although it's known to be notoriously bad during lunchtime.  It does get somewhat messy, but nothing like what I've experienced at Five Guys.  There isn't always a place to sit, but we were able to find a spot in the corner.  The one thing that makes this Super Duper different from its other spot on Chestnut is the crowd.  There are a ton of random bums sitting at the tables and chairs outside, and they are there without having ordered anything.  They take up almost the entire area, and are begging for change and food right when you walk out.  It takes away from the overall appearance of the restaurant.

What you get for that is a good greasy burger.  It's ground beef is kinda loosely put together into a patty then fried.  Not sure what kind of meat they use but with that first bit burger juice just gushed out of the bottom requiring 4 paper towels to mop up, just to put it into context. Still, it's a good burger.  Pace yourself though because you'll feel it later.  And while you're there don't forget to order the fries.  Very good skinny fries.

The garlic fries were SO bland!  There was hardly any cheese, and I think the only reason I could taste a hint of garlic is because I knew they were garlic fries.  They weren't good.\n2. The massive double patty dominated the bacon and special sauce.  I think the bacon and special sauce were very good, but I think I would've needed more of both to compete with the double patty.  I just couldn't taste either very much.\n\nNow on to the positives.  For a fast-food burger, I think that was the juiciest and most flavorful beef patty I've had.  It was greasy, no doubt about it, but it was delicious meat.  The bun was also very good--good bread and toasted very well.\n\nWhen I go again, I think I will (1) order the mini burger (maybe 2) to even out the ratio of patty-to-bacon-to-special sauce and (2) not order fries.

Eat, and dip. \n\nWe ordered the garlic fries, and some mini burgers with an extra egg. Mind you their sauces are off the hook, plus you can't say no to their organic beef, and egg! ALL ORGANIC EVERYTHING WHY NOT! \n\nPlus the cheese was really good, it lingers in your mouth for days! Definitely touched up my burger cravings!!

Located on Market Street, this burger joint is huge! SDB pretty much offers only the Super Burger, which includes two patties, and a wide variety of toppings, including the basics. You can also ADD cheese, bacon, and sunny-side egg (for $1.50). The burger was honestly not that tasty in my opinion, but was of good size. On the other hand, the homemade pickles were excellent, as they were super tangy and complimented the burger well with more taste. We also ordered the garlic fries with 6-month aged cheddar cheese. This was excellent, as these garlic fries were quite unique. So overall, was Super Duper Burgers good? It was OK, but if I'm basing everything on one burger, I would still choose In-N-Out, even though SDB offers a more unique experience for an ordinary burger.

They fixed the mistake but when you are a burger place with limited toppings, it shouldn't be too hard to get it right. We ordered the plain fries with the three dip sauces and that was a total waste. The sauces seemed to be chipotle, mayo and what my daughter called 'onions and banana.' I agreed but I had the sauce flavor as 'strawberries and pickles.'

Enter Super Duper. This is what a downtown SF burger joint should be. Extra juicy burger with fixins' galore and solid fries. Sizing is a bit counterintuitive -- I get very full off of a mini (single patty), but the boyfriend sizes up and goes for the regular (double patty).

It was one of the places I've heard of when I first worked in the city. \n\nPretty decent burgers and shakes. They do remind me of In-N-Out and Five Guys in terms of how you order. One patty (Mini) or two (Super), add your condiments, choose your onions, and wait just a minute or two longer than your usual fast food joint. Be prepared to make a mess especially with their medium-well burgers loaded with the super sauce. Their super sauce does remind me of In-N-Out but not as overwhelming. It's pretty subtle in my opinion, but it does bring out the sweet taste of meat rather than an add-on flavor. Their patties are pretty thick, so if you're eating it at a late time and wants to add on an order of fries, maybe stick with the Mini. I do love their garlic fries but I'm just too scared of garlic breath! I usually just stick with the regular fries, a bit too salty for my taste. The texture is pretty good though, not too airy, not too dried up. It's a bit too oily for my fingers, but just right for my taste. Burgers and fries being too healthy/lacking oil just don't work. \n\nIf you're not feeling a burger today, you can still try their shakes. I've tried their spiked chocolate shake. It's very milky and creamy with just a tingle of vodka flavors. Shakes are good, but spiked shakes are even better :)\n\nOverall, their food is a 3.5. 0.5 more just for friendly cashiers.", "author": "Connie C."}

The single patty may be a little small for one person but if you note that it's less than $5, you shouldn't be too surprised. \n\nThe patty was pretty flavorful, on the salty side but I like it that way. It looks like a handmade patty rather than those uniformed frozen ones- tho I don't think it is actually handmade.  The special sauce is ok, nothing special.  I appreciate all the extras that you can add for free (grilled onions, jalapeno etc) and $1.50 for an organic egg.  It's a little expensive but I thought it really enhanced the flavor of the burger. \n\nThe fries are pretty good, crunchy.  The shake was actually very delicious, I tried the cookies and cream one.  Would definitely get that again. \n\nTheir homemade pickles are pretty good and are at the condiments table that is free for all. There is a line during lunch rush but the staff is very efficient and the line moves quickly. I had an annoyingly crazy order with all these special requests and the girl taking my order was super nice and accommodating.  Would come here again.", "author": "Krystal C."}

The service is quick and the food is amazing. The burgers are great and so are the fries. I recommend trying the cookies and creme shake they have there; it doesn't taste like any other cookies and creme shake I've ever had before, it's THAT good. It's almost like they blend cake into it or something, it's delicious. The only problem is that, since it's in such a busy part of town, it's always super busy and there aren't many places to sit. It can seat a lot of people, but I wouldn't count on there being many spots for big groups. There's a second story/balcony like level with more seats, a few tables on the ground floor and a few tables outside as well. This might not be too ideal because it can get pretty cold in SF, but it's still really nice. The seating looks mostly like it's made for 2-4 people. The music is really cute, too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-07", "description": "The burger itself was pretty good- veggies were fresh, meat was seasoned well, and the sauce was delish. \n\nBut the 2 problems that I had were the oiliness of the burger itself and also the dryness of the patties. I got the super burger so it had 2 patties instead of one--they were well done and with two thick patties together like that at that cooked state made everything taste hella dry. It would have been WAY better if they either made the patty thickness much smaller or just made the patties a medium rare-medium. And also if they bothered to pat down the meat and the buns, the whole thing wouldn't be drenched in oil like it was when I got it. \n\nAlso the sauce, the one thing that I think makes this burger actually stand out from other regular burgers, was so hidden; I could barely taste it most of the time, but when I did, the burger tasted super yummy even with the dry patties. Overall if they just tweaked a couple of things with the sauce proportions and the cook on the meat, and even more simple things like removing excess oil, I would have easily given them one more star. However it's just not quite good enough to be better than even an In-n-Out double double given the difference in price and quality.", "author": "Sarah B."}

It's more of a walk in, order, and sit type of restaurant. The burgers comes in two sizes, \"super duper burger 8 oz\" or the \"mimi 4 oz\" burger. Don't let the names fool you because they're both pretty normal sizes. I got the 8 oz super duper burger & it was as big as any burger you would get. My burger was just a regular burger with guacamole and a sunny side egg. The egg is very fragile so when you hold onto the burger, the yolk will come melting out. Don't worry though, the messier the food, the better it is! \n \nThe only thing I didn't really like about the burgers was that it was a bit salty for me. Otherwise, it was really good.

The garlic fries were topped with some aged cheese and they were still not super greasy. For the really really small price of the burger, the quality was just too good. The patty was super super juicy and flavorful. Though very basic (bun, patty, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions & cheese) I would definitely say this is one of the best burgers I have ever had! The only reason I took a star out was for their slippery stairs. Me and my husband, both almost tumbled down. They really need to fix those.", "author": "S A."}

Being a self-respecting slob, I wouldn't be caught dead with the mini, so ordered the super duper w/swiss and bacon for myself, and swiss for the wife.  First oops...no swiss cheese.  Had to go to cheddar.  Ok, no big deal...also ordered garlic fries.\n\nSo my bad for not reading the fine print (which I'm not sure exists)...the mini is NOT a slider kinda burger...rather, it's a four ounce patty...and the super duper is two of them (it's says more than a bit when a \"mini\" now means \"standard size\" in America).  Sooooo, we both ended up with an extra patty that we didn't want.  Luckily, this was in SF, so a person of the street got some extra protein that day.\n\nSecond oops...garlic fries does NOT mean put some garlic salt on fries, guys!  That's just sad.  And wrong.\n\nSo overall, not a bad place (certainly great for sidewalk people watching....always entertaining in SF), but if you're a burger snob, there are likely far better places in the area.

This place is definitely an upgrade from the typical fast food burger, and I personally prefer it to In-n-Out. I'm going to rank the 3 things I ate here in the order of preference:\n\n1: The burger is extremely flavorful and juicy, albeit a bit greasy and messy. I got the Super Duper burger which has the double patty and is extremely filling. The ingredients were fresh, and the bun was really good too. \n\n2. The home-made pickles were my second favorite item served here. They are not briny, but have a nice balance between sweet and tart. The best thing about these are that they are free and AYCE!\n\n3. The garlic fries were my third favorite item, but not because they were bad. They were extremely crispy and had a great garlic flavor. Personally I prefer my garlic fries to be fat and a bit soggy like at AT&T park, but that's just me. The fries also come with cheese which was nice. These get placed third mainly because I could've eaten those pickles all day and the burger was Super Duper filling. \n\nOverall this place is amazing and it has a great location in the city for the next time the burger craving hits me. Next time I might try to get the mini-burger and try to enjoy the fries a bit more. Also, the shakes here look GOOD and I might need to try one.", "author": "Josh Y."}

And when the temperature rises, it seems, things start to happen in the body of a red-blooded American. The sense organs register mistakenly that it's almost summer, triggering the brain to stop craving warm soup and start craving -- you guessed it -- burgers and ice cream. Memories of Fourth of July picnics and Labor Day barbeques surface in the vision centers of the mind, making one salivate in remembrance of burgers past. Ancient evolutionary processes take over and begin to operate the limbs. \n\nThus, I have only vague memories of checking into my hotel and going out to forage for food, and first finding myself blinking under the bright lights of Super Duper.\n\nWhat happened next, though, I remember vividly. I spotted a twistie cone on the menu, and demanded chocolate and vanilla swirl. Both flavors together! It's summer! Let's do this! I also ordered a veggie burger.\n\nWithin minutes, I had my pre-summer bounty and was shuffling back off to my room with my, uh, kill. I finished the delicious, rich soft-serve ice cream on the way, shivering in the late-evening drizzle that was now cooling my body temperature and reminding me that it was still winter in SF, and this summer hallucination was now mostly in my mind. As I ascended to my room, my prefrontal cortex had kicked back in, just in time for me to register that I was now eating THE BEST VEGGIE BURGER OF MY LIFE. The bun was fresh and chewy, the patty just salty and savory enough, the vegetables fresh and crisp, and and the hummus and avocado on top brought it all together. I must have sat there with the empty wrapper in silence at the W for a full minute, just trying to comprehend what had happened to me. \n\nThe next day, it was forty degrees and drizzly, with a whipping rain that soaked into my boots. I didn't care. Super Burger had given me a vision of summer that I will carry with me forever. Or at least until I find a tastier veggie burger and a more delicious organic soft-serve than theirs.

Three visits so far, and always the same. \n\nThree and a half stars, but I'm rounding up to four, because maybe you won't order a shake.", "author": "TJ P."}

The difference with Super Duper is the grease and juices they leave on the burger that makes the burger even that more tasty. \n\nThe location is great and the staff is really friendly. One plus to Super Duper is that they serve alcohol and can even spike your milkshake with vodka which isn't half bad. The fries are always on point and their pickles are homemade. I really dig the natural and organic layout of this Super Duper which directly ties into their mission and message. The crowd is a mix of everybody but mainly shoppers from Westfield Mall and workers from the area. Do not go there during lunch hours on the weekdays because the line gets ridiculously long.

I came here for the Yelp Elite event, and got to sample lots of stuff. I thought all the combinations of sauces and toppings in each burger (chicken sandwich/fried portabello/philly/blue cheese burger) were all spot on and tasty.  I had a slight preference for the blue cheese burger, because they threw in a really fat hunk of cheese right over the meat and it was so so delicious (see my picture).  The fries were crunchy, which is my style of fry, so I was all over those too.\n\nA few things I didn't like: \nthe buns on the burger were OK- and the pickles were just gross. They tasted like really tart vinegar.. I'm not sure. This is a bummer because pickles should be the bomb.  Also, as much as the food was tasty, I found burger portions to be a bit small for $6.50 a pop..\n\nHere's the point though- unless you treck over to In N Out, there really isn't much competition around- so I'll probably come back here or go to the Castro location if I'm craving some tasty American comfort fare.\n\nWhat also sealed the deal: They serve Racer 5 on tap!! Very friendly staff and the decor is awesome. Modern meets industrial but very simple. High ceilings and very spacious. \n\nToo bad I don't work nearby!

I've heard good things about this place, so my expectations are somewhat high. I came in and it was semi busy on a Wednesday afternoon. The service here is actually pretty good, everyone is extremely nice and helpful, especially the people taking your order. They sell beer in a glass, which is a definite plus. I had the super burger with cheese with a side of garlic fries. The reason why this place gets 3 stars is because the food wasn't good at all. I've decided to write my food review based mostly on Gordon Ramsay lines:\n\nThe Burger: It was so oily, America tried to invade it. There was so much grease to it, I couldn't get a good grip on my burger. The beef was so raw, I can still hear it's heartbeat. They say it's cooked medium, but it was definitely medium rare. It was also very warm, like it was heated up by lights and not a grill. I was not impressed.\n\nThe Garlic fries: The last time I saw this much grease, it was a John Travolta movie marathon. I could see the garlic, but I couldn't taste it. From all the rave reviews from fellow yelpers and elites, I didn't understand where it was coming from. \n\nThe only saving grace are the beer and the service. The beer is good, on tap, and served in a glass. Every item that they use are sustainable, compostable, and recyclable. That's a good thing, because I had to use an entire forest's worth of napkins from the grease! Once you're finished with your food, you clear it out on the condiment station.\n\nThere's decent amount of seating inside and upstairs and outside.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-11-30", "description": "This review is for the Mission/One Market location near the Embarcadero. Since this is a chain, I feel that leaving a review for this location is relevant and appropriate. Visited this location last Sunday evening at 6pm and ordered a double cheeseburger and fries. I picked up my food at the counter and brought it back to my table. I noticed that there was no cheese in the burger and immediately brought it back to the counter. The gentlemen in a yellow shirt with an orange colored pattern looked at it and acknowledged the mistake and said he would take care of it. I walked back to my table and started eating the French fries and noticed that they weren't hot (I shouldn't have been too surprised since I noticed a bit earlier that they were sitting on top of a counter near the fryer for longer than they should have. This is all about timing, why have the fries ready before the burger is cooked and prepared?). They were closer to white than golden brown in color. I decided to not say anything about the fries. My burger was brought back to me a short while later and all the worker did was stuff 2 slices of cold cheese inside. How could this be considered OK? Needless to say this pretty much ruined the entire burger. The cheese made the middle of the burger barely lukewarm and to make matters worse, the bun was also cold and barely toasted.\n\n     I knew it was getting close to closing time so I decided to just let it go. Another reason I was hesitant to bring it up was the aforementioned person at the front of the kitchen wasn't exactly apologetic about the whole incident. I really felt like he was being fairly dismissive about the mistake (that being said, I know it wasn't his fault for the initial mistake). Wouldn't normal protocol have been to at least redo the meat patties and cheese vs stuffing 2 slices of cold cheese inside and re wrapping the burger? So essentially, I paid $11.15 for warm fries and a borderline cold burger. I can't recall this happening to me at any other place that I've ordered a burger/fries before. I'll accept some blame for not speaking up initially but this scenario should never have played out the way it did.\n\n    I e-mailed Superduper via their website the following day and never got a response.  I'm preparing myself for whatever excuse is coming for why my message was never replied to.", "author": "Scott F."}

It's that good :-)\nI will admit that I haven't had more than 3 items on their menu, but really that's because I CRAVE those 3 things for weeks before we come here lol. First there is their Super Duper Burger with bacon. The meat is flavorful and perfectly cooked, the bun is soft while still standing up to the juicy meat, plenty of cheese, and the bacon is abundant. As it should be ;-) Second is their garlic fries. Not too thick, not too thin and plenty of garlic. Lastly, their homemade pickles. Not exactly a \"menu\" item because you don't have to order them. You basically just get to help yourself to them. Packed full of flavor and quite zesty, once you get started on them you won't be able to stop!\nSo, if Super Duper is not on your Bay Area \"to do\" list already, add it!!! \n\nP.

For a burger joint I didn't expect the quality of the chicken sandwich to be as good as their burgers. The garlic fries are a good accompaniment with the rest of the food. It might seem like a splurge to get the same sized fries with some cheese and garlic but you won't regret it. I had one of their chocolate strawberry shakes. I found the consistency to be more like chocolate milk although I found the appearance of fresh strawberries a nice touch.\n\nWatching the team behind the counter work their magic is a thing of beauty.

(mmmm) On my way back to work I ordered 4 milkshakes for my staff and 2 garlic fries. I figured it wouldn't take long...I was wrong. \n\nMy shakes came out in 5 minutes but it took another 15 minutes to get my fries. One of the kids working could tell I was getting pretty angry so she made someone make them I guess. When they came out she informed me that I should ask them to get them if it's taking long? Well why didn't they just give me my to-go order at the same time? My buzzer buzzed but they asked me to wait for the fries, so I did. \n\nI have eaten here several times. They got rid of my favorite burger and the staff is always rude and standing behind the counter having conversations. Food is mediocre. Burgers are small and the garlic fries were too small and mushy for the price. Good choco shakes though.\n\nThere's Mel's Diner and Split Bread a hop skip and a jump away.

This is definitely one of the more affordable places to ear in Union Square, especially in the evening and I think the new Metreon location will help minimize the lunch time lines at the Union Square Super Duper (hopefully?? those lines get long at lunch!)\n\nThe Veggie Burger and garlic fries are awesome.  I have also had a dipped cone which was good. Don't pass up the pickles! I  must admit, I used to be scared of them because they look kinda gross sitting out by the napkins but they taste great.\n\nMy only frustration is that the combo specials cost more money if you order them with a veggie patty instead of beef and it is not stated anywhere.

Peer pressuring her to check out, we decided that it was a burger type of night.  At first I thought about taking her to Fish and Farm for the Chez proclaimed best burger, which by the way, it is not, however, we decided to just stay nearby and go to Super Duper.  \n\nI thought Super Duper was going to be one of those gourmet burger joints in similar vein to Umami and Fish and Farm.  Imagine my surprise when I saw that it was more similar to In-an-Out.  Recently, gourmet burger restaurants are popping up left and right in San Francisco, marginalizing the \"fast food\" burger genre.  However, sometimes I am just in a fast food burger type of mood.  I ordered the Super Burger with grilled onions and an organic egg.  KJeh ordered a mini burger.  Super Duper does not have 10 type of burger variations; they have a very simple menu.  Two burgers to be exact - simplicity at its finest.  It was way past dinner time, however, was still packed - a testament to their burgers.  My burger arrived and was very neat in presentation.  Biting into it, I was amazed.  It was delicious.  It did not have the gourmet flavours of a $20 burger that include every condiment under the sun and more.  What Super Duper gave you was a very flavorful meat patty.  The essence of a burger is its patty and everything else is an afterthought.  I gurgled in bliss as the juices of the grilled onions dribbled from the sides of my mouth.  The mix of the onion juice with the egg yolk created the perfect marinade for the patty.  The fries were delicious and reminded me of the extra crispy in-and-out fries.  KJeh was very happy with her product, disclaiming that I had flamed the fuck on in terms of my recent yelp picks.\n\nSuper Duper is your no frills hamburger.  Sometimes you just need to say fuck truffle oil, fuck goat cheese, fuck that kobe cured beef shit!  Strip away law, we are nothing  more than heathens...never forget that.

It is definitely more upscale than In N Out burger, but not much.  It has the same vibe as Taylor's Refresher with clean industrial decor, friendly tattooed staff, and a clear view of the grill to you can see how your food is made.  The price is just right, and they offer a lot more options for your burgers, or chicken sandwiches.  The meat was juicy and full of flavor, and the bun held up to everything too.  The fries were much better than In N Out burgers, cripsy and light, without overwhelming the main event....the burger itself.  \n\nOne of the things that really appealed to me was that while the long was very long, one of the servers came by with samples of the fries and chiptole sauce (which i personally thought was gross) but it was a great way to try something before actually making your order.

So I decided to stick it to them by frequenting an upcoming gourmet burger chain that specialized in serving foods from sustainable sources of agriculture. \n\nGreat move, right?\n\nI've come to think of this place as the Five Guys of Union Square, they give you good portions, let you put whatever you want in it, and you can always count on seeing a few cross-dressers inside.\n\nTaste-wise, this place is a no brainer. The meat is good and it's not overly greasy and filling. They pride themselves in offering \"veggie diet\" beef, which sounds good but makes you wonder, what the hell is \"non veggie diet\" beef? The inside looks kind of like a Chipotle since its got your standard metal chairs and strange homeless-esque artwork everywhere. \n\nI would say that this place is a little on the expensive side, but you can't really hold that against them. It is in the middle of downtown SF and most of the working people who go there won't have a problem dropping $10+ for a quick lunch.

I always passed by but never thought to actually go in (burgers aren't really my thing), so thank God my hunger got the best of me the other day while I was at the Chase bank across the street.\n\nI ordered a Super Burger with cheese, bacon, and jalapeno sans tomato and onion for myself, and a Super Burger with everything plus cheese, bacon, and avocado and Garlic Fries for my manager (oh, the life of an intern). The food was ready in no time, and I couldn't wait to get back to the office to eat! I may have stolen some garlic fries on the way...\n\nThe Super Burger has TWO patties in it, and the burger is the perfect size for an extremely hungry Asian girl who conveniently forgets about her diet from time to time. The beef patties were very juicy and tasted very natural and unprocessed (ahem, McDonald's) - I was completely stoked to be eating such an amazing burger. They didn't put a lot of bacon in there, which would usually disappoint me but I was too focused on the burger itself to really care. The garlic fries were delightfully tangy and weren't overwhelming with flavour. The fries were cut thin and weren't soggy at all, which is most garlic fries' downfall. \n\nEven though I saw the oil on the wrapper after finishing the burger, I surprisingly didn't feel all gross and greasy (during and afterwards). But still, I would say Super Duper Burger is a once-every-3-months kind of deal, for when you're in the area and the person you're with hasn't tried it yet.

(My buddies thought I could find pearls by eating raw oysters, knowing I have always gotten sick eating oysters. I was a bit drunk so I was very easy to cajole.) \n\nI had walked through Yerba Buena park and checked out the annual Filipino Culture celebration. While the food stalls offered good looking food for reasonable prices, my stomach told me to move on. \n\nFinding nothing interesting, I gave up and was walking back towards the Ferry Building along Market street. And then I saw the light. Actually, I smelled the sight. It was super Duper -- a place I had been wanting to try. \n\nI walked in and looked at the menu. Knowing my stomach can handle only non-acidic and non-spicy food, I trained my eye on the Super Burger. I asked the lady if I should triple up on the beef patty, each weight about 4 ounces. She looked at my skinny frame and said you may want to stick to the two patty-Super Burger. OK. I don't want to temp fate. \n\nI saw the fries that were coming out from the kitchen -- they looked ordinary and skinny and the portions seemed small for $2. I wanted a beer but didn't want to walk home drunk and be arrested for DWW -- drunk while walking! \n\nSo, I opted for a coke in a bottle -- which this joint calls Mexican coke; OK, it's like maybe 6 ounces. \n\nAs I sat waiting for my burger, I'm thinking to myself why they call the bottled coke a \"Mexican coke.\" Was it bottled in Tijuana, Mexico. \n\nWait. When I was in TJ, everyone told me not to drink the water. Well, silly me. Since the weather was scorching hot, I got a bottled coke there and (stupid me) I drained it with ice. Well, ice, ice baby didn't go well with my stomach. Enough said.  Ewww! \n\nOK. My Super Burger was ready in 5 minutes. It looked very good; small for a $6.50 cheese burger.  (Anyone recall that line from Pulp Fiction!)  I should have paid an extra $2 for a third patty. Oh well, I wolfed it down. Damn, it was good and juicy. The meat was cooked perfectly and the buns were toasted nicely. \n\nI love chewing on ice. So, I drank my Mexican coke with ice (hopefully, made with SF tap water).  I love Mexico but I hope the ice was not imported from TJ; if so, I hope they used purified water.  I DON'T want to be hugging the toilet again tonight. \n\nI'm coming back here.

After checking Yelp, this place was the first to pop up and only two minutes away from where I was, so we decided to check it out.\n\nWhat caught my eye were the prices!! So reasonable!! I decided to order a mini burger with cheese and everything on it, with regular fries and their \"fresh lemonade with brown sugar\". The total was like $10.50, which is pretty good for SF.\n\nCustomer service was great and friendly. Line wasn't long at all. Got my food within 5-7 minutes, and went to sit upstairs overlooking the restaurant. It's a pretty cool and laid-back place; nothing too special, only serves its purpose to sit customers. Would be awesome if they had TVs and happy hour specials on the beers, but that's just my dream lol.\n\nOn to the food:\n\n--The bun was buttery, slightly toasted, with sesame seeds. I love my buns like this.\n\n--The burger was the perfect size for me (mini burger = quarter pound).\n\n--The toppings - cheese, onions, tomatoes, super sauce, etc. - were right on. Didn't spill out and it was the perfect amount.\n\n--The fries were addicting - zesty with a slight crunch, my fav. My friend had garlic fries which were oh so yum.

Super Duper is worth the wait.\n\nTheir burgers are made with the fattiest cut of ground beef known to man, but that's where all the flavor comes from. I like that they hand out french fry samples while you wait in line - their aioli dipping sauce is yum :) And their combo deals are actually quite affordable - $8 for a mini burger combo. And what they call \"mini\" (a 1/4 lb of meat) is actually a regular sized burger, so unless you want to eat half a cow's ass, a mini burger should do you just fine. Their chicken burgers are good too. Their self-serve pickles from a jar are sweet and sour at the same time.\n\nOooh! And they have dipped cones! When's the last time you had one of those? Too long, that's when! \n\nMy only recommendation is that they hand out those little buzzer thingies so you know when your order is ready - it's hard to hear your name being called over all the noise.", "author": "Mariela D."}

It falls into this really great middle ground between a gourmet burger and a diner/fast food burger. \n\nYou get all sorts of options as far as your toppings go, but then the burger itself is just so straight forward and delicious. A little greasy, very juicy, and not too pricey either. I tend to gravitate more towards diner type burgers and actively dislike some of the more fancy burger places like Father's Office. But I do appreciate having more topping options than In-n-out for example. They have caramelized onions! Probably my fav topping to put on a burger. \n\nThe fries are delicious and you can grab as many pickles as your heart desires (I think I ate like 10 pickles with my burger the first time I came here). What more could you want?\n\nIt can be very crowded but the line moves quickly and the orders don't take too long to come out.

It's an odd arrangement. Oh, and \"Everything On It\" apparently doesn't actually mean everything. Weird, right?\n\nThe fries and dipping sauces were good, not great. I got the garlic fries and had to go back to the counter to request the dipping sauces I had paid for. Deny me peace and quiet but NEVER deny me dipping sauce!\n\nAll in all, it's better than McDonald's, I'm sure. I haven't had a McD burger in years, but I can imagine. My advice, though, is to save up your money from two potential visits to Super Duper and go to Marlowe or nopa for a burger instead. You'll get a better burger, a clean table, and actual service. Best of all, it won't be on Market Street.", "author": "Todd X."}

I satisfied my craving at McDonald's. I'm not a big fan of fast food these days, but there are a few items my appetite still has a soft spot for.\n\nToday I found myself in the same predicament. Only this time, I was further up Market towards San Francisco Shopping Center. I wasn't going to turn back and walk a few blocks in the other direction for McDonald's. But I did eye a sign with a big 'ol soft serve cone on it. Not just any soft serve, but organic Straus Creamery soft serve.\n\nI'm not super sold on the Straus Creamery brand, mind you. I've bought a $5 dollar quart of Straus Creamery organic milk to foam for my home-brewed lattes. The quality was at best marginal over other organic brands. It felt like drinking the emperor's new milk.\n\nSo here we are at Super Duper, and I see a kid walk out with a short dark chocolate soft serve cone. I look up at the menu, Vanilla, Chocolate, or both, $3.50 a pop. I order a twist and the guy behind the counter says they're out of chocolate. Lame. So I get the vanilla. The cone he spins up is at least taller than the kid's outside. That makes me feel a little better.\n\nThe texture is rich, as is the flavor. It reminded me of the creamy flavor you get from Mister Softee trucks in New York, it's not exactly the same taste as ice cream or other soft serve cones, but lighter, with a heavy dose of milk fat. The soft serve was definitely dense and rich. But is it really worth three times the cost of a soft serve cone from McDonald's?\n\nI think not.", "author": "Tony L."}

Not kidding. \n\nSuper Duper at 721 Market is a very open, noisy loft. It's as if someone remodeled a barn with industrial materials and said \"We're open for business!\" I went at the peak of lunch so the line was 20 or so deep. Customers range from college students congregating over milkshakes to businessmen trying to avoid getting sauce on their ties. I ordered the regular 8 oz. hamburger with super sauce and added bleu cheese. My man and I split the garlic fries. I wanted a milkshake or at least an Arnold Palmer but had to refrain. \n\nThe actual burger patty is the star of the show. I know they offer chicken, but please get the cow. Juice literally ran down my hands and forearms because I wasn't well prepared with Super Duper's rustic napkins. With each bite I couldn't believe this burger was real. I wanted to film it! It was hot, moist, \"it-would-fall-apart-if-not-for-the-bun\" tender, and quite simply perfect. The melted bleu cheese added a tangy creaminess and even more juice (which was absorbed by the sweet toasted bun). Oh, and our garlic fries were awesome, but that's really an afterthought.\n\nBut you know what they say about too much of a good thing...I suppose the only \"con\" is that Super Duper does its job so well, it's borderline overdoing it. I was also at fault because I didn't know when to stop for my own good. Those last few guilt-ridden bites were best left on the table. It's apparent I had waited too long for lunch.\n\nI sat at a barstool next to the kitchen's glass wall to spy on *how* they make their burgers so juicy and I have three words: flat top griddle. I'll never put burger meat on another charcoal grill as long as I live. \n\nIf a doctor tells me one day I need a heart stent, I'll know which burger put the nail in my cardiac coffin. :)", "author": "Miranda L."}

At least at Super Duper it is consistently delicious, whether it's the mini burger or super burger.\n\nI really don't understand how anyone could say these burgers have no flavor. If you honestly believe they are \"flavorless\" then you have no tastebuds left and shouldn't be reviewing restaurants. Excellent meat from Niman Ranch, cooked medium, with fresh crunchy veggies, \"secret sauce\" and a soft tasty bun (+cheese and bacon if you have an extra few bucks).. All that equals a TASTY burger. I'd also like to know how many of those \"it's flavorless\" people smoke cigarrettes. Or Meth.\n\nI haven't been to the Castro location, but this one is pretty roomy, as it has plenty of seating (usually) downstairs, and a few more tables upstairs and outside. I enjoy the decor, especially the large cutout of a cow in puzzle-style natural wood pieces, with very different grain patterns and finishes.\n\nChicken sandwich was okay but not fantastic, the chicken I got was slightly tough and dry. The garlic fries are also just okay, as the fries themselves are thin-cut and cooked well done (perfect) but the garlic was too light, and parmesan too heavy.\n\nStrangely I still haven't had the ice cream, as I'm usually in the area for work so I just get meals and skip the dessert.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-08", "description": "Like many recent reviewers, I got in on the Free Burger promotion, and I was quite happy with the result. Their burger is not as massive as some places - which was nice, as I could actually eat it without having to imitate Jaws - but the quality certainly makes up for it. The burger was juicy, flavorful, well-dressed (lettuce, red onion, cheese, tomato), and came on a tasty and slightly-toothy bun, more like a classic Kaiser roll than the standard supermarket or fast-food bun.\n\nThe space has an industrial feel to it, with concrete flooring and aluminum tables and chairs. I appreciated that the soda fountain was self-serve, so presumably refills are included (which at $2 for a soda, they certainly should be). The condiment bar is mostly limited to ketchup and mustard, but they do have complimentary pickle spears, both dill and (slightly) spicy. The burger runs about $7 and fries are +$2, so it won't be a common destination for me, but it's not too bad for the area. Given the quality, when I'm craving a burger, this is likely going to be a go-to place.", "author": "Bill B."}

The line was semi-long but out the door by the time we were done ordering, signaling this was THE place to eat at (and that we have impeccable timing). Their menu setup is very much like most pizza joints... a few \"specials' and the rest being a base burger that you are charged per item for. The list of toppings, though is pretty great and has the best of the best (in my mind). I was easily able to order my signature burger... bleu cheese, bacon, and avocado. Most drinks (except the lemonade sweetened with brown sugar) are self-service and there are jars of truly incredibly house-made pickles to snack on while you wait. Our burger were well-seasoned, perfectly medium to medium rare and served on sturdy, delicious buns. The pricing was fairly reasonable for that neighborhood and we ended up going back again the next day for lunch and the food was even better than the night before.", "author": "Deborah K."}

I get that they're all over the burger version of \"make a better mousetrap\" but that on its own doesn't merit the superiority tax that they heap on top of your order.  $7 for a cheeseburger is simply too high, and being asked, \"would you like fries with that?\" It really deflates the hipster image.\n\nAlso, I'd like to take a moment to strongly advise against ordering their shakes.  Soft serve does not make for a good milkshake, and the difference in taste is completely transparent.  It's $4.75 for plain vanilla/chocolate, and $5.50 for their \"premium\" flavors  If I'm paying ice-cream parlor prices I expect parlor-size and parlor-quality.", "author": "Chris A."}

The layout reminds me of that kind of place, and I think they nailed the quasi-soma Market Street decor. I was really hungry when I came here and we ordered a couple burgers, fries and the triple dip set.\n\nI ordered my burger and they didn't ask me how well I'd like it done (I understand they cook everything medium which is fine by me). I added bacon and cheese to mine and set out to get my grub on.\n\nThe consistency of meat pissed me off. I believe they grind everything daily and I had a few complaints. One, I got a bone shard in my burger which I guess is understandable, but it sucked. Two, the consistency is very coarse in parts of the burger and very fine in others which gave a largely inconsistent eating experience.\n\nAll of the toppings are exceptional, with the notable exception of the spiced pickles. They're really good, but they're not what I want out of a pickle with a burger. My ideal pickle is the monstrosity they provide you at Rosemunde's, which is pretty much the best thing ever. I found these to be a bit sweet. There really wasn't anything wrong with them, I just felt they didn't go well with the burger which was a surprise.\n\nThe fries were delicious, and I liked all the sauces, although some variation in consistency would be nice.\n\nThe staff is extremely helpful which helps make this 3.5* restaurant a 4* experience.\n\nTL;DR: Good but not fantastic.

Your choice of toppings are pretty run of the mill, but are more than adequate in freshness and quantity. Their special sauce, or whatever it's called, isn't groundbreaking in any way, but it tastes pretty good.\n\nThe staff is efficient and while they're not necessarily friendly or even memorable, they're not bad either. I've yet to have an unpleasant experience. In fact, the last time I was there, they called my name and a guy named John who was in line behind me beat me to the counter. Mistaking my name for his, he lifted the bun on my burger to see if it was what he ordered. Before I could finish saying I'm not eating that, the girl behind the counter was already on her way back to get a new one made for me.\n\nThe fries are a disappointment, though. I'd go 4 stars if they were better. They're not horrible, they're average really. But they almost seem like an afterthought. And the portion size is not generous at all.

Inside is narrow but deeep and there is an upstairs seating area in the back, in addition to some tables near the front and outside. I think the setup nicely allows for containment of as much of the long line as possible, before it snakes out into the street, disrupting foot traffic and entangling tourists. But it is a pain to weave through said line to get your food, unlimited pickles, condiments, etc.\n\nPROS:\n-Mini burger is basically a normal burger. It tasted very fresh, MEATY, and filling.\n\n-Fries are skinny and crispy, my favorite style.\n\n-They give you your shakes first, so you can pacify your growling stomach during what feels like an eternity before your foods come out.\n\nCONS:\n-We both got the garlic fries and were disappointed at the lack of garlic. Do they use garlic powder? Or was it parmesan? Regardless, I was hoping for big chunks of garlic because I am Korean and stereotype, and I was disappointed.\n\n-I got the chocolate strawberry shake, but I could not taste the strawberries at ALL. It made me wish I saved the extra $$ and put it towards adding malt to a regular choco shake.\n\n-The ordering system can be a bit confusing for nubs like me. They list the toppings in 2 columns: FREE and add'l charge. There is also underlined in quotes: \"everything on it\", so I asked for my burger with \"everything on it\", thinking it would include everything under the FREE column, like the grilled onions and peppers. Nope. Only referred to the underlined toppings. Tricky tricky! Next time I come, I'm gonna have a mouthful to say.", "author": "Leah C."}

Been here a few times and these guys deserve 3 or 4 Star rating for friendly service and good quality food. The burgers are not as flavorful as expected, so that's what has me leaning towards 3 Stars.\n\nSo, WHY, you're wondering, why why why does this Review only show 2 (two) Stars?\n\nBecause of the BS treatment I received on my visit today:\n\nI ordered a Mini-Burger \"with Cheese\". The menu board for the Mini-Burger CLEARLY states \"CHEESE  $0.50\". I asked what type of cheese I could choose and she listed a few, including \"Blue\". So I chose the Blue Cheese.\n\nAfter finishing my meal and cleaning up my trash, I notice that my receipt lists Cam Blue or something, price ... $1.50.  WTF?  ... WTF?\n\nSo I took the receipt to the same checkout girl and she said that Blue cheese is $1.50... \"where does it say that?\", I asked, ... she couldn't find it on the menu board (and I said ... \"Isn't Blue Cheese a type of Cheese which is clearly stated as costing a $0.50 when added to the Mini-Burger\")?\n\nInstead of apologizing, she takes off in a huff to bring someone over (manager?). This manager points out the special blue cheese option on the menu board as $1.50 (about 3 or 4 menu boards to the LEFT of the Mini-Burger board). I asked if she could see that this was rather confusing, since, well, Cheese is Cheese and Cheese is listed at price $0.50 -- it does NOT say \"Cheese (except Blue) $0.50\".\n\nWithout saying a word of explanation, nor apology, she runs off to a storage room or something, and gets me $1.50 in cash (I left $0.50 as an extra tip for their *trouble*). But still ... no *apology*?\n\nFor a restaurant that obviously stresses and trains their employees in friendly service, their handling of this (minor) situation is confounding. Sure; they didn't fight me *much* on getting me the instant refund, but, what, ya can't say \"Sorry; you're right, actually, we ought to fix that menu to say 'except Blue' -- great idea!\". Nope, didn't go that way.\n\nThis treatment indicates to me that service here isn't *really* friendly and attentive, nope ... it is just BS drone training ... Like those checkers at Safeway that offer to help take your groceries out to the car, yet don't give a sh*t if you're waiting in a checkout line for 30 minutes or if they ring up multiple items on your order wrong with no apology...\n\nBTW: The blue cheese on the mini-burger? Barely noticed it was there. Actually pulled the bun off a couple times to check. Ah... just a hint of flavor and no texture. Certainly not worth $1.50, and certainly not worth the \"BS\" treatment.", "author": "T G."}

However, long lines are often a very positive indicator . . . there IS a reason why.  \n\nToday I waited it out, and was not disappointed.  The grilled chicken sandwich with chipotle aoili + cheese was a winner.  I'll be back to try out the burgers and salads for sure.\n\nAs this place is right on Market Street, I suspect it is always going to be busy during lunch hour.

Me, my brother and nephew stumbled across this place after a night in the city.  \n\nThe decor is very modern and welcoming.  Metallic surfaces and warm lighting.  There's a sitting area in the front as well as an upstairs room.  \n\nOn to the burgers...  juicy and tasty!  I had the Super Combo which comes with a double cheeseburger, fries and drink for around $10.  That's a bit pricier than your average burger stand, but I think it's worth it.  The patties are perfectly seasoned and cooked just right - medium, so they have a nice juiciness.  They toast their buns which are also a step up from your average bun.  The produce is fresh and premium quality - no shredded rabbit-food lettuce here.  Little details like these help Super Duper rise from other burger places.\n\nThe fries are also very good!  They're shoestring cut and cooked to a perfect crisp.  If you've ever been to In-N-Out you know how their fries can sometimes be a bit soggy.  Not here - they're always fresh and crispy.  I recommend upgrading to the garlic fries too.  Mmmm!  \n\nThe whole meal was a good portion and we left feeling nice and stuffed.

Their list of fixins' was great, the only thing missing was bacon, and possibly some blue cheese or garlic.\n\nI think the ambience is great, there's a small upstairs seating area that seems like a loft for an apartment that overlooks most of the restaurant, which I thought was cool. The clientele seems a little hipster which is a negative in my book, but it's San Francisco, so you can't help that. The staff seemed very friendly, so that's always good.\n\nOh yeah, when they take your order, they ask for your name. Since there was another \"Dan,\" I tried to think of a name that would stand out. I could only think of \"Prometheus,\" but the ticket only allows so many letters (and she misspelled it, I blame our school system for not delving deep enough into Greek mythology), so next time, I'll go with a shorter name.", "author": "Dan F."}

I WAS SO MAD!!! but too hungry to go bitch to the cashier about it esp when there was another enormous line forming. \n\nwhat i did have though was pretty good and im excited for my next time back where i will ensure that the order is perfect.  the patty is pretty juicy but the bun really sets it apart.  i dont know what it is but it is soft, buttery, and deliciousness.  was also really impressed by the fries, almost mcdonalds like in its cruchiness.  i got the three dipping sauces and the mayo was just mayo but the chipotle and super sauce really do have a kick.  so glad this opened up in union square so i can get my burger fix on the weekends (provided the cashier gets the order right from now on!)", "author": "Cathy L."}

As a whole, the burger was literally drowning in its own grease.  WAAAY too greasy for me.  I think I used over 6 towels to soak up the dripping oil.  And they forgot the egg on BOTH burgers!

I keep trying to think back to this past Saturday to see what was memorable about the burger to me and there isn't much. The patty was just okay.

Sounds great if they get the order right but I knew something was up. I simply ordered two orders of the super duper burger (2 patties). Trying to avoid confusion, I told them what I wanted in it as opposed to what I didn't want in it. You would think that would be easy but it wasn't.\n\nFirst off, I never asked for cheese for my g/f's order. I have no clue why the heck the girl decided to charge an extra 50 cents when these burgers don't come with cheese unless you ask (trying to upsale). She can eat cheese so whatever. I cannot and my order was beyond jacked up. It had the sauce which I didn't want. Basically everything was screwed up. The menu also didn't specify that the garlic fries had cheese on them. Now i'm a bit of a picky eater; i'll admit that. But you should list what comes in your food b/c some people are allergic to certain foods.\n\nI will give it to the white guy (not sure if he was just a worker or owner) who corrected my order real fast and was polite about it, so I can't be mad at him. They brought out another set of garlic fries minus the cheese. It was way too greasy but I think that's b/c they just wanted to rush the order b/c it was wrong. I can overlook that.\n\nThe burger itself was pretty meaty but nothing special. Sort of reminds me of 5 guys and fries, which isn't a bad thing. Overall, the food itself was pretty decent but all other factors considered, it's not the best place to eat. It's right in a \"touristy\" area and seats are limited. In addition, they don't have enough trash cans and the only two they do have are placed awkwardly by the napkins, which are hard to grab (you'll know what i'm talking about when if and when you go there).\n\nOverall, it's decent food but not really worth the hassle in my opinion.", "author": "James K."}

The guy at the front of the line had been waiting a long time, so the manager came by and told one of his employees to open another register. She came but started chatting to her co-worker at the other register, so the customer left in disgust. I'm not sure how long he was waiting, but it looks like the service was pretty bad.\n\nAlso, one of the girls at the counter was stretching, I'm guessing her back was sore from standing all day. She bent over and touched her hands on the floor several times. Then she noticed that the pecan pie display was disorganized, so she proceeded to re-arrange all the slices of pie with her hands. That had just touched the floor. Several times. Last words of advice: Don't eat the pie.", "author": "Priscilla H."}

I hope you're a manager, and if not you should be. \n\nThat said, the service was... aside from Curtis, in a word, abominable. We ordered three burgers - one mini with cheese, two supers with cheese - one with bacon. It's not like their menu is so complicated that this should have even happened. But it did. They screwed up our order, BIG TIME. When our food was called my dad and I excitedly went up to the counter, he took the fries and I carried the burgers. When I got to the table I noticed that only the mini had cheese, and there was no bacon anywhere. So, I flagged a hostess down and explained the situation - with receipt in hand to prove that I wasn't looking for free cheese. She was very sympathetic and picked up the burgers saying that she would have them cook up some bacon and add cheese. As she walked away I realized what she was intending to do. \n\nI caught up to her at the pass, and asked politely if she would be having fresh burgers cooked off for us for a correct order. Hand on the Bible, I swear to you she said, yes. A few moments later, our burgers were delivered. However, fresh, beautiful, melty cheese laden burger were not what was before us. Greasy, lukewarm (at BEST), reserved burgers again greeted our hungry eyes. \n\nPicking up the tray I brought it back again to the pass. A young man stepped up and greeted me. I explained to him the original dilemma, and then told him about the unbelievable audacity the woman who brought us the burgers had, to reserve not only another wrong order, but cold food. Having worked in the industry I know there are shortcuts - but this was NEVER one of them, and I've worked in some shady places. Even there we had standards. Curtis was gracious and understanding, walking back to my table to retake the order. He invited me to watch the burgers being made, and I took him up on the offer, not to be a snob or to be rude but to make sure that the great things I had said to my parents about SD weren't going to be challenged. I watched the failed order go into the composting bin, and was delighted as a tray of three correctly made burgers came out to me literally moments later. \n\nI don't know what was going on that night, but if it hadn't been for this young man's outstanding patience, and GREAT attitude, I think he would have lost three patrons that night. \n\nBonus points for the desserts on the house for the complications!", "author": "Elizabeth D."}

Just wished it wasn't soggy (See below).\n\n* The patty itself was juicy, fluffy, and very delicious. Something needs to be done during the assembly process though so that the bottom bun isn't so soggy by the time I get to take the first bite.\n\n* Not impressed with their special sauce. I'd rather not have the hint of chipotle flavor in it. Just simpler ketchup and mayo \"secret\" sauce would've be fine with me.\n\n* The fries aren't my favorite. Maybe they decided a greasy fry wouldn't be accepted by the often snobby SF denizen. But if you're going out for a burger in the first place, notions of healthiness shouldn't be part of your deliciousness checklist. (I'm betting it's this same group of people that pressured the City to take away my hookah lounges). While the fries were undeniably crispy, they weren't the tastiest. Just a little bit of grease would've gone a long way here. (See In-N-Out for a french fry that is tasty but still doesn't make you feel so bad for eating).\n\nOverall, I wouldn't hesitate to try this place again or recommend it to my friends.

First impression: Dark, dreary and small. It almost felt like I was in a club minus the strobe lights and d.j. (at least how I remember how clubs were back in the day). I think they had music playing, but I can't remember because I was too focused on the size and layout of the place. There's outdoor seating, and when you enter, there's seating on your right  and so is the line and more seating in the back with bar seating facing the open kitchen. It just seemed weird to me. Condiment station is on the left and bottled drinks in an open refrigerator is on the left too. There's seating upstairs, but from my standpoint, it didn't look like a big space. I don't know, the layout just didn't work for me. So on to the food.\n\nI knew I wanted a burger even though they had some healthier eats. You can order a Super Duper (two patties) or a mini burger. I opted for the mini since I wanted fries. You can have your burger with everything (lettuce, tomato, onions, and sauce) anything else on it is extra ($1) and your burger is grilled medium. The fries are only one size and you can order regular or garlic. I ordered the regular fries ($2). So I put in my order to go and waited about 10 min.(?) which is what the sign at the front of the line indicated it would take for orders to be ready. There was already a number of people waiting. I don't know, the layout of the place really bugged me because people, including me, waiting for our orders were blocking the area where the refrigerated drinks were. \n\nSo anyway, my order was ready and hopped on BART and headed  home. The burger, juicy, but not juicy like a medium grilled burger should. It was very tasty with enough seasoning and sauce. The mini burger is a 4 oz. patty and I was already wishing I got the Super Duper (8 oz. = 2 patties). The fries were...eh. I don't know, but when I think about burger joints, I would their fries would be up there like their burgers. These fries were thin-cut (not shoe-string though) and not super crispy. I like my fries to be medium to thick and fried crispy, like Belgian fries or preferrably, crinkle cut. I don't know, but I wasn't impressed with the fries. Burger was good, but not outstanding.

Ok, when were you going to tell me this?  That wasn't the only problem.  The burger was over cooked, dry and barely had any sauce on it.  I was very disappointed.  All of my experiences here and at the location by the metreon have been awful.  The sign on the menu say the burgers can be messy business.

It's definitely on the expensive side (not exorbitantly, but you're not getting out of here under $15 if you order what I did).  Very oily too, even if a lot of it is from the fat of the beef.  The patties are cooked well (I don't mean well-done, but enough while still leaving a bit of pink), but I found them to be a bit crumbly.  Not sure if this is due to the rending of all the fat or inadequate patty-shaping.  It's season just under well-enough, but I guess getting everything on it (sans cheese) was good enough for me.\n\nThe garlic fries were also oily, like they didn't drain them long enough after coming out of the fryer.  The minced garlic was good, though I'd have preferred it to be mixed throughout rather than dumped in a pile on top.\n\nThe shake was probably the star of the show here, even if it's meant to accompany the burger.

I was drawn by the massive crowd of people and super long line, so I ended up waiting ~15 minutes in line, and ~15 minutes for my order. The place is constantly packed.\n\nWas it worth the wait? Kinda. I had a mini burger (4 oz patty) combo with fries and a fountain drink for 8 dollars. It was a very delicious burger and had fresh ingredients (they don't make it till you order it! so waiting 15 minutes is actually not bad) I wouldn't say it was so good that I would come back everyday and wait 30+ minutes though. I was contently full, though I wish they had a medium 6 oz burger. Fries are average.\n\nService was pretty good; nothing to complain about. The cooks have it pretty rough; you can watch them making your patties and they almost never get a break from all the orders.\n\nWILL I come again: yes, though I still prefer In-n-Out because of the price and the wait\nWHEN will I come again: When I have a longer lunch break\nWHAT will I do differently: Order a milkshake; the cookies and creme one looked good. and I might upgrade to an 8oz burger because the Super Duper combo is only 2 dollars more. And also because I sometimes eat like a man.", "author": "Tiffany Y."}

I love the reusable glasses, composting, and dyson hand dryers, but actually, a big jar of pickles out for the taking is not what I want in that stretch of market. Also, the pickles themselves are way too vinegary. \n\nIt's not a good sign that the aesthetic comes first, both in this review and, seemingly, at the restaurant. It's a fairly stylish place, but the food is merely fine. It's amazing how as soon as your options are 4 or 8 oz, 6 oz seems like it'd be the perfect size. I'm not crazy about two patties instead of one larger one - it is definitely a skinny patty place, and more like fast food. The feeling of really sinking your teeth into the burger is lost, and, I think, the feature of having a cooked, charred on the outside, juicy on the inside patty. I DO love all the toppings, especially all the free ones (always good to have jalepenos as an easy option!). I didn't love that, despite going over my order a few times, I managed to get red onions instead of grilled onions. But I will give them that the fries are quite good - for skinny, fast food fries. They're about as good as a good batch of McDonald's, so take that as you will.", "author": "Lisa K."}

Similar to In-N-Out, the fries are disappointing.  The shakes are kinda meh.  The prices are a bit steep.  \n\nOne big thing it has going for it is that for some unknown reason, it is definitely the best burger within a solid half-mile of its location, which also happens to be only a block from where I work.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-26", "description": "Top three things I can say about Super Duper: \n1) The fries are competitive with some of the best I have ever had. \n2) Do not get a chicken burger in a burger place. You will be sad you made the wrong decision, and kick yourself for how obvious your wrong decision was. \n3) skip the shake, go right for the beer.\n\nI went with two other strapping young men, both of whom got (double) \"Super\" burgers--it delights me to no end that a standard 1 patty is called a \"mini\"--and they were mumbling something about OHMmmmmMMMMm-dis-es-dah-besht-buhgrhr-evahhrr through their stuffed mouthes. I stole a few bites of a burger, it was brilliant.\n\nThe chicken burger with chipotle aoili was just eh. It wasn't awesome, it wasn't horrible. I think I was sad that my chicken patty was so thin when the boys were mocking me with their double-layer meat patties. Maybe I have meat-envy. Mine just didn't stack up.\n\nThe moment of bliss though, was when we realized our fries were done in different batches. One person had slightly more done fries than the other- we kept switching back and forth to see which one won. They both did- just different races.\n\nThe shake, however, little disappointing. I got the chocolate strawberry shake & it tasted... not fake... just forced? Is that a possible description. The taste wasn't right & the strawberries, if they were fresh, were pureed so finely that they were non-existant. There was no tell-tale sign to let me know fresh fruit was once there. The shake was pretty runny as well, not at all what I like my shakes to look/taste/feel like.\n\nI'd absolutely go back & get the burger next time. I'd scrap the shake for a beer & I'd order a few satchels full of fries.", "author": "Tawnee K."}

My friend who was with me ordered the same thing and hers was pink as well. Now I dont like making a big deal but I just didnt want to eat it like that especially if I paid what I did for it. I went back and explained to the man that I ordered it well done he apologized and said he would fix it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-08", "description": "It's sadly amazing to see how new burger joints attract such ecstatic reviews in the official media and elsewhere.  Especially when the most adult of restaurants now often have burgers on the menu (and pizza and mac n cheese), but they do.\n\nFortunately, this is a burger joint that delivers.  This south side of Market location gets light only from the front, but makes little effort to deal with the deficit by using bright colors, or even bright lights---the space gets taller towards the rear, which is where orders are placed and cooked, and where a loft rises over the main floor.  It's very plain, open beam (and fire foam) construction with modernist furnishings and a simple chalkboard menu high on the rear wall.   There is some variety in the offerings, but not the number of different sizes when it comes to the burgers.  Chicken is also available, cheeses for the burgers though are limited, no swiss for example.  Brand name beef.  Pickles are home-style, in canning type jars.\n\nAnd so, I can finally get to the burgers which are really quite some of the best I've had.  Nice burger flavor, no cutsey spice combinations butting in, and a solid sesame bun that more or less held its shape, and the burger, which tended to slide out the opposite side with each bite.   I had the jack and the partner had bleu cheese.  I felt that the bleu cheese here produced something of a petroleum flavor, but the jack more nicely complimented the meat.\n\nI also had the soft serve, I love soft serve ice cream almost everywhere, except for the ice-milk versions at the big hamburger chains.   This soft serve seems to have real cream in it---and real chocolate as the flavors were rich and well developed, not merely a suggestion aided by coloration.   I'd make regular pilgrimages here just for the soft serve.\n\n\nThis place is a winner.   Good tasting, well made burgers;  fantastic soft serve ice cream, and a fresh, comfortable and modernist interior perfectly suitable for its high-urban setting.", "author": "Paul T."}

It even had tasty cookie crumbs at the bottom. Thumbs up for originality. \n\nThe french fries were a delicious start to the snacking-- not too oily, the perfect amount of crisp and the perfect amount of salt. Definitely the best french fries I have tried in the city. For the garlic lovers out there, there are equally if not more delicious garlic fries too! For the vegetarian's out there--the Super Duper fries are cooked in canola oil. \n\nThen I tried the portobello burger. It had great texture, the portobello was juicy on the inside and crispy on the oustide. The toppings were in good proportion and overall the burger was great.

Their small ice cream cones are excellent--it isn't too much ice cream and a perfect proportion of sugar cone to ice cream. But the best part about the ice cream cone was the chocolate shell on top. So delicious!! \n\nAlso the ambiance was good and the live music was a great addition rarely found in burger joints. Not sure if the live music is an everyday thing at Super Duper, but if it is I'll have another reason to keep going! \n\nOverall a great experience--thank you yelp, for the yelp elite event. I highly recommend this place to someone looking for a good burger joint for meat eaters and vegetarians alike.", "author": "Neeharika B."}

I put in in the top 25 percent, In and Out and 5 Guys are just as good in terms of the flavor of the product. I think letting the association with organic and Niman Ranch  influence your ratings are like appreciating a wine based on its label,  it is still about taste.  To me organic beef is a bit of an oxymoron if you really are concerned about what you are putting in your body. As to the wait,I think they take as long as any other make to order burger joint.

I had trust in the employees since the cashier repeated my order back to me 3 times to make sure. I ordered 2 super burgers medium well both with bacon & dressed with everything. I asked for one with roasted portobello & raw onions & the other with grilled onions. I paid extra for the bacon & portobello. I also got regular fries & garlic fries. So I get my number & buzzer. 2 mins later it buzzes. I wasn't even done filling my drink cup. Usually I have to wait at least 5 or 10 mins. I go to the pick up bar & the guy asks for number & hands a bag that was thrown together & over flowing. He then walks away I had to ask another person for a bigger bag.   An hour later, I finally get home after commuting with disgruntled Giants fans. I opened my bags. Garlic fries clumped together, regular fries sunk to the bottom of its bag and soggy. To be expected. Then the burgers, I got 2 identical over cooked bacon burgers with no dressing, no portobello or grilled onions. Not even their own sauce.  Took a bite ,it was so dry that ketchup can't even salvage. So disappointed! I just paid $25 for inedible meal. I was too tired to trek back downtown to complain. .

I went in during the lunch rush too! The only gripe I have (ok maybe two) is that the prices are going up quickly! This is when the number of stars go down....\n\nWithin the last month it went up a quarter! Ok I may sound cheap but compared to what I have gotten a regular mini burger for before, ($3.75), it is now $5 for a mini burger. That's one hell of a hike! Last month during the release of the new iphone, it was still $4.75 without tax for a mini burger. I clearly remember that day because I came in for a burger and commented on the price increase to the server who was pleasant and cordial. This leads to my second pet peeve. What kind of server tells their customer that their customer is wrong and that their price has not gone up for the last month and a half she has worked here. Well apparently the server did that today, who was standing in the middle and super adamant that their price did not go up. So another star lost for the way this server handled my comment today. Even if I end up being wrong (which I'm dam sure I wasn't!), the server could have been more pleasant and cordial like the previous server I encountered. \n\nBecause I love their burgers, I will come back. Probably not as often... hopefully the next time I come back it won't be $6 for a mini burger! But to mend my shattered heart over the treatment I received today, my boyfriend joked that the price hike may be due to all of their compostable packaging.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-22", "description": "A coworker and I had been excited about Super Duper Burger opening since we first heard the news, so when she was finally free for lunch one day we went over. I had already been once before they officially opened, and did a review on the whole restaurant experience which you can read at burgeranddestroy.com. We had to grab our food and go because of a meeting, but even though it was fairly crowded inside the line moved quickly and we got our food fast.\n\nI was feeling hungry, so I ordered the 8 ounce Super Duper Burger for $6.50. I added cheese for 50 cents and bacon for an extra dollar, so $8 total. Also grabbed a vanilla shake for an additional $4.75. Our food was handed to us quickly, and we headed back on our one block walk to the office. Once I dug into my bag, I found that my burger was in a foil wrapper, like it was wearing a space blanket. Their motto is \"Fast food burgers, slow food values\" and it's these touches that play into it. I'd never really think of it as \"fast food\" but it strikes a real good balance between the two.\n\nThe 8oz. Super Duper burger is actually 2 patties. I didn't even realize this at first because my burger suffered some serious patty-creep. But this is a pretty hefty burger, especially with the bacon. The bacon was pretty crispy, but had some chewier parts. I had to do the rip-bacon-and-stuff-it-back-into-the-burger maneuver, but only once. They do add bacon above and below the patties; it is kind of hard to see in this last picture, but bonus points for that. Much more obvious is the cheese that is all kinds of melted deliciousness.\n\nUnfortunately the further I delved into my burger, the soggier my bun got. I've been experiencing this more than I ever have lately, and really am going to try my best to eat right after ordering, not bring it anywhere else. My co-worker didn't have this problem, so I'll see how it goes next time. But the last few bites were impassable, as the bun was beyond saving. With the large amount of bacon, this ended up being a very rich burger and relented to it, leaving a few bites left. The cause of my soggy woes were the juicy patties, which are cooked real nicely, and you can tell the meat is high quality. The consistency is very good, and it is never too tough even on the edges.\n\nI really want to love this burger, but its not an all star for me. It is a very decent burger no-doubt, but it seemed a little off-balance. For the neighborhood though, it is the only way to go. The milkshake was real good, but on the smaller side for just shy of $5. The fries I had previously are also tasty, but I don't know how often I will specifically be craving a burger here. That's probably for the best, as falling in love with a burger a block away from my work could be a dangerous thing.\n\nI will definitely be adding this in to my lunchtime rotation, and if anything changes I will be sure to update. You won't be making any mistakes coming here, but you probably wont be trying to have them name a burger after you either.\n\n-Burger and Destroy", "author": "Mike M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-06-10", "description": "This is sort of a cumulative review.\n\nI really want to like this place. They have awesome veggie burgers that make me believe that the meat eaters are missing something. They have garlic fries with finely chopped garlic and Parmesan on them that (while a bit saltier than what I normally eat) are so good and that I get cravings for. They stay open later than a lot of decent food places in the neighborhood. The place is clean and looks nice enough. It's not ear busting loud like some burger places are.  This would normally be a five star review from me.\n\nHowever, I find myself still not really wanting to go there after the service I got there a while back. I ordered a shake and what I got was thin enough that at first I thought they'd given me a chocolate milk with a couple teaspoons of heavy cream added. It was as if no ice cream had been harmed in the making of that shake. It certainly wasn't worth the price when I could get a chocolate milk that tasted the same at the 7-11 next door for two bucks. I took two sips, found it kind of gross, and did something I normally didn't do: I very politely (and kind of meekly) told this kind of shorter white guy (who I think may have been a manager since he was not dressed the same as the other workers) that the shake tasted a bit much like a chocolate milk. His response was a flat kind of rude, \"What do you want me to do?\" I asked if he could please remake it because it was essentially a chocolate milk. He seemed really mad at me and gave me attitude and told me it would come out the same because that was the recipe. I'd had better shakes here, so either the other cashiers ignored the recipe and made them better than him or he was lying. Either way, I don't think it would've killed him to just say, \"Sure I'll remake it\" and add a little more ice cream. I work food service and that's what I would've done if someone had approached me the I way I approached him about it. Still trying to be polite and not wanting to be pushy but also not wanting to deal with this, I asked him to refund me. He made sure to glare and scoff at me as much as possible while he threw away the shake, loudly blame me for not liking it to another staff (who asked why he was throwing it away), and then glare at me some more while he did the refund.\n\nSince then I haven't really wanted to come here... but the garlic fries are so freaking good that so long as I see that he's not there and the other (super friendly awesome staff are) I'll still get fries. I still come here a lot less than I used to and I'll probably never get a shake here again ever, lest the same thing happen. Since I'm normally the service I expect decent service so that experience kind of ruined this place for me.", "author": "A J."}

Though the portion size was depressing, they did not skimp on flavor. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the fries.

The burgers are juicy, the portion size is hefty (go with the smaller if you aren't that hungry I barely finished the 8oz), and the fact that they are using good meat and have organic soft serve is pretty cool. \n\nThe Bad-\nThe burger wasn't good, shall I continue? I didn't realize that an 8oz meant two 4oz patties. Not the worst thing, the worst thing was that they were cooked differently. One was well done and one was so bloody at one point it said, \"I'm gonna mooooove right through ya, you're gonna be sorry in ten, nine, eight, seven.\" The fries are alright, nothing special and the yogurt is ok but I wasn't in love. \n\nI was tempted to go 2 with this one, but the staff saved 'em a star. They are what makes this place super. Really nice people, smiled the entire time I was there, one went so far as to do up my cone even after she closed her drawer for the night meaning she couldn't take my money. Everyone I interacted with (3 total) was really great. I just wish the food matched. \n\nKnow Before You Go: Being newish they may need time to get from raw to well-done.", "author": "Corey D."}

The burger was so juicy,albeit a tad on the greasy side. I'm on the fence with their 'special' sauce tho. The fries were great too and again I don't know if the ketchup was heinz or was it in house.So the sauces were the ones that put me off. So when I come here next time i would know now NOT to have that special sauce on my burger if that's even possible. For pickle lovers which I am not, they keep homemade  pickles in a jar. As for how good they taste I have no idea. But they are free, so just try them and decide for yourself.Overall one of the juiciest, tender, lean beef I've  had in awhile.

Don't matter if you gettin' chicken or beef, the fried egg is gonna kick it up a notch. Really, everything tastes better with a gooey egg dripping yolk on top. You try it on pizza and tell me I am wrong. But I digress. The 8-oz burger comes with two patties, that's a little weird but probably their way to efficiently move the huge line of hungry customers. Their medium-rare degree of doneness, apparently their default choice, is really medium. If you like to see some pink in the middle, I'd order rare (I tried both and was a happier camper with the rare burger). Oh, and don't let yourself tempted by their 3 dips for fries for an extra dollar, they're not worth it. Aioli isn't even one of the three. It's nice to make an attempt at originality but fighting the pervasiveness of aioli when it comes to french fries is a lost battle.

The french fries are crispy shoe-string-esque and you can get plain fries which are great or garlic fries which are deadly in a good way.

It is also by far the greasiest.  I'm talking about a 1/2 centimeter thick layer of grease covering my fast food sized burger tray.\n\nThe place is located along tourist central on Market Street near Powell BART, and the line around mealtime reaches to the entryway.  The place looks pretty hip and modern, and the line actually moves pretty quickly, thanks to a pretty simple menu.  Burgers are a little expensive, considering the 1/2 pound burger is really just two quarter-pound patties slopped together.  The bun is your standard sesame seed bun.  They offer a decent number of a customized toppings considering the number of people they serve.  Every topping came out of fresh and well-cooked, including the fried egg and avocado extras that I added.  Each ingredient is delicious -- nothing overseasoned or mushy.  The patties are made-for-quantity \"all-natural\" beef patties.  In my experience, most restaurants that cook the \"all-natural\" patties tend to be dry and overcooked.  Super Duper has managed to avoid this problem by drowning the cows in all-natural cooking oil.  It is delicious and awful at the same time, as the mixture of dry but still substantial and meaty ground beef and oil mix together in your mouth orgy.\n\nThe fries are good, slightly better than average, and not as oily as you'd think given the sopping wet burgers.\n\nI will almost definitely go to Super Duper again given the slim pickings in San Francisco, but I will almost definitely feel guilty about it afterwards.", "author": "Jeff Y."}

I would definitely go back if I get a hankering for a tasty burger.", "author": "Benjamin S."}

More like 2.4 stars\n\nFOOD:\nMini burger\n$4.50\nThey lied about having the burger cooked medium. It was well done - just a gray-brown patty of disappointment. The bun was fine - sesame-topped and sufficiently soft. I ordered my burger with lettuce, tomato, and the super sauce. It could have used a little bit more lettuce. The slice of tomato was juicy enough. The sauce was meh, tasting mostly like a mayo with a tangy note. It was spread rather unevenly in my burger, which seems sloppy to me. I also don't like the resulting inconsistent bites.\n\nFrench fries\n$2.00\nThinly cut like McDonald's. Nice and crispy, served warm. Slightly salted. The peel of the potato could still be seen at some of the ends, should you ever question whether or not they use real potatoes.\n\nAMBIANCE: Modern \"raw materials\" look with mostly concrete, wood, and metal for all interior decorating and furniture. Floors were dirty. I spotted many squished French fries, crumbs, and a Starbucks pastry bag littered on the concrete floor.\n\nSERVICE: Could use more cleaning.

Super Duper burger advertises sustainable farmed vegetarian fed cows.  But what's the point when the the burgers are so dry and salty yet bland.  I've gone to the new location on Mission St at the Metreon and same thing.  I don't think In-and-Out burger is much better than say a Wendy's burger so I never understood the positive reputation that In-and-Out burger has in CA, but now I'm starting to understand.  It's because of places like Super Duper (sorry In-and-Out fans).  There is so much potential and expectations when you walk up to the register and order.  And then you take a bite and wonder why you didn't go to McDonald's instead.  Oh yeah, the advertisement but \"green\" cows.  I can't recommend this place at all for burgers.  \n\nI also tried their soft serve, it's what you would expect.  However, it costs $3.25 and up.  Rather pricey when you can pay another dollar and get better tasting frozen dessert at Ghirardelli's'  or Haagen Dazs.  The homemade pickles also are way too sweet.\n\nThe positives:  French Fries.  They also have garlic fries if you're into that.  \n\nI'm definitely willing to give their Chicken sandwich a shot someday.  However, AVOID coming here for burgers.  It's not good.  If only it was a Five Guys. . .we can always dream.", "author": "June P."}

Upon arriving and ordering I double check with the gal taking my order and she said that they didn't have a gluten free bun so I said I called and was told you did have one. She then said yes it's gluten friendly but she usually doesn't say it's gluten free because of cross-contamination that might happen in the kitchen. I ordered it anyways but I was skeptical. While I waited for my food I tried researching online/yelp to see if I could find any info on the bun but had no luck. I got my food had a few bites with the bun but was still worried and removed the bun. The burger was ok nothing amazing and the worry was a total buzz kill.

Then the garlic fries...so many good reviews on it how was I not to try them? Much salty. Many raw. It was garlicky for sure. But in a bad way. It was like it wasn't cooked long enough and it still had its raw spiciness and was covered in unmelted cheese. Gotta say it wasn't my cup of tea. Much rather have gotten regular fries.

It was closer to 15mins, but definitely not over that and for peak lunchtime hours on a weekday, what do you expect?\n\nI thought the staff were fine, not overly friendly, but definitely asked 'how are you?', etc so wasn't the same poor vibe others got. There's plenty of seating, even at busy lunchtime, although sometimes you need to hover over people finishing up if you want a table outside on one of the few 80 degree days like today!\n\nI thought the burger was great! Maybe not as much flavor as In n Outs meat, but still very good. I got the bigger 8oz burger as despite a fairly small size, I can eat quite a bit. This, along with fries, was probably a bit on the heavy side and with the good quality of the toppings, I think I could probably do a mini in the future (it's actually 2 separate burger patties if you get the 8oz). I had mine with bacon (they were very generous and it was thick and good quality), cheese, also generous, jalepenos (thick and fresh) and tomatoes (ripe) and lettuce (crisp and actually green - not that cheap iceburg stuff or limp leaves you get elsewhere). Together it was delish and the bun was good as well, I guess only thing to note is that even by the time I sat down to take my first bite, the paper holding it was wet so it's quite greasy.\n\nThe fries are great, I think I like them better than In n Outs, they have more flavor and are perfectly salted. It's quite the meal though and I don't even want to know how many calories let alone sodium -- I have down about 48 oz of water in about 2.5 hours since lunch and am still thirsty, but I guess that's how it goes!\n\nNot sure this is my top burger spot, but it is really good and I'll definitely be taking my husband here to check it out.

It's cool to train people, but when you get my order wrong and overcharge me, that irks me a little bit, how hard is it to program a combo button into your little machine? So instead of charging me for 2 combo meals, you charge me for 3 combo meals, in my mind, I'm going, umm, this doesnt add up, 10+10 = 20, with substitutions we had, it was 10.75+10.75+1+tax would be roughly $25-26, how in the world did you charge me $34??? There goes my night. \n\nAnd on top of everything, you dont ask how I would like my burger cooked, you dont ask what toppings I would like. The burger comes out greasy like the fonz just combed through it, I felt like I was eating butter and oil the entire time. The garlic fries tasted like it came from the microwave dusted with some cheese. \n\nZERO STARS, disappointed, ruined my night.

EXPECT a juicy, but greasy beeeeeef patties. this beef is the real deal! it'll dribble grease and juiciness all down your hands and arms and maybe even onto your clothes if you're as messy as i am ^_^ but it's definitely worth it. sooooo good. with bacon and cheeeeeeeese. yum yum yum. of course, it's not a good idea if you're looking to lose inches from your waistline, but hey, we all need our indulgences right??\n\n3. if you think you'll have room [rarely happens] forgo the [average] fries and GET A SUPER SHAKE! :D share with a friend if you think you're about to burst. cookies and cream is sooooo delicious, you just might have to drink dessert first.  sure fries are good, but really nothing extraspectacular and you'll find that the creamy coldness of a shake is perfect to wash down that thick coating of cheese, bacon, and grease that's attached itself to the insides of your mouth and throat.\n\nfinal thoughts: :) yum! this is a wonderful, juicy, filling treat every once in a short while. the burgers are irresistible and the shakes are a delightful complement. worth the money, no doubt! if torn between In-N-Out and Super Duper, i think Super Duper is the better choice! also, extra points for being VERY environmentally friendly!", "author": "Jane S."}

That's really great for the environment and other places should do the same thing. Also, their veggie burgers are pretty good and the staff is generally friendly... \n\nBUT...\n\nThey keep screwing things up.\n\nI've been to this location as well as the one in the Castro and at both locations I had problems with not getting what I ordered. One time, I ordered a veggie burger and got a regular (beef) burger instead. Good thing I noticed before I took a bite. They apologized and promptly replaced my burger but put cheese on it which was not what I ordered. Whatevs, this kind of stuff happens sometimes. \n\nThen, a week or so later, I get my burger, sit down on one of those tall chairs. It's missing part of a leg so I almost fall to my death (slight exaggeration). Then I proceed to take a bite and notice that the taste is off. I take the burger apart and, well, there is no veggie patty in there.... Uhm, what? \nI go back to the counter and someone from the kitchen walks toward me with the patty and hands it to me. I must have looked confused because an employee (supervisor?) talking to someone by the register noticed and asked me if something was wrong. I politely said \"The patty's missing.\" She doesn't really react but the kitchen employee silently takes my tray and motions for me to sit down. 10 minutes later I get my burger with a side of \"Sorry about that.\" So yeah...

I give them credit for providing more options than a typical burger place, even an upscale one.  Lots of options for your burger construction.  I would say that Pearl's burger is tastier - but Super Duper is more user-friendly.  The garlic fries are very good, the shakes are good, but nothing to write home about and the salad that we had to go along with the burger was surprisingly good and actually a decent value at just under 6 bucks.  It was enough for 4 people to share as a side dish.  Unless you are really hungry, i suggest you go with the single patty burger.  It's plenty.  The one thing we thought was \"weak\" were the chocolate dipped soft serve ice cream cones.  Nice idea - but poor execution.  The chocolate shell didn't set well and ice cream came dripping through almost immediately.  Not even close to what you can get all day long at a normal Dairy Queen.

There was a huge lunch line but we entertained ourselves by practicing flashcards for a test we are studying for.  (That's not added in to make me sound like a huge nerd but to show that we had enough time in line to be bored enough to suggest we take our flashcards out and quiz each other.)  We each got our own burger and shared some garlic fries and a chocolate strawberry shake.  I added grilled onions and cambozola cheese to mine.  I forget what my friend added but he had a double patty one and I went with the regular.  I like to eat my garlic fries with ranch (I like to eat a lot of things with ranch, you should know that about me).  When my friend asked if they had ranch, the person said they only had \"Super Sauce, Homemade mayo, and Chipotle\" sauce.  When my friend dared to ask if any of those were like ranch, the Super Duper person seemed quite offended.  Really I can understand her reaction because that is pretty outrageous and irritating that my friend would be allowed into this establishment only to insult the restaurant by assuming it might carry a common sauce like RANCH.  It's people like him that force places like this to do invite only eating in the first place. \n\nThe burgers weren't actually that bad but I've had way better burgers before.  The garlic fries were pretty good but really could have used some (dare I say it, yes I do dare say it) RANCH.  I really liked the chocolate strawberry shake..they use real strawberries and the consistency was very nice.  It was light and flavorful.", "author": "Amber L."}

I'm so disappointed to see all the other reviews that say the quality is inconsistent and grease spills out from their burger.\n\nI've already gone twice and both times it was yummy!  I think of it as a meatier In n Out.  The meat is a bit fresher, juicier, and thicker, and the toppings just make it all even more juicier.  Their sauce is unique Chipotle sauce (kinda orangish like InNOut's too). I think I like In n Outs buns better, but all in all, I would come to Super Duper more than In N Out if I was craving a burger.\n\nTheir fries and garlic fries are so so compared to other decent places. Their soft serve is good, but $4 is kinda pricey...\n\nOh, and this SuperDuper was much better than the original one in the Castro near the Lookout Club.  The one in the Castro was so disappointing-- and had those little bits of rubbery pieces in the meat (fat?  ligaments?)\n\nHere's the rundown: My fav burgers in SF:\n\nFish&Farm\nFarmer Browns\nSome Cafe at the corner right in front of the ChinaTown gate (I'll fill this in later)\nSuper Duper Union Square\n\nAnd these aren't worth mentioning:\nSuper Duper at Castro\nThe Bar on King street near the Park\nThe other hamburger place at the Beacon\nMarlowe (although they were voted really well.

After ordering and paying for a burger and fries, I'm standing with the other folks waiting for the food... and continue to not hear my number.  Then I notice that people who arrived after me were receiving their orders; this is about 10 minutes after I had ordered.  So I ask one of the food runners to check and she tells me that they are too busy and somehow misplaced my order, but within 2 or so minutes, I received my food.  I think they should have offered a comp of some sort, because they misplaced my order.  So I'm very unimpressed with the service, and can't think of a reason to return for awhile, until they can get their service act together.\nIncidentally I ordered their \"huge\" burger, which turned out to be 2 of the normal burgers stacked together.  If I knew it was going to be a double burger, I would have been fine; but I was expecting a single large burger and not 2 burgers combined.\nAnd the 3 sauces served with the garlic fries aren't good, nor are the garlic fries anything special, so next time I'd just order fries, because I like fries with burgers.\nTheir pickles are good, but not as great as I'd hoped.

My tab for a burger with everything free on it ( lettuce, tomato, red onion and super sauce) plus a fried egg, garlic fries and a beer was about $14.

When I learned that they had none for sale I threatened to make Super Duper shirts to sell to them. The manager went upstairs and got a shirt for me that is meant for staff.  That was awesome.

The atmosphere is pretty casual with trendy music and the workers are fast and awesome. I have to say that it was one of the best customer service I have ever had. The girl at the register was super duper nice and had a lovely smile. I wish I knew her name. I ordered the Super hamburger with cheese and egg and it was very tasty and fresh made right before being served. I wish they had a larger selection of beverages but it is no big deal since there are plenty of liquor store around.", "author": "Ibrahima Bocar Gabriel M."}

The lady came around and gave out fry samples while people waited which was nice.  It was almost 13 bucks for a medium drink, fries and a burger.  That's pretty steep.  The burger tasted good but there was so much oil that my bottom bun basically disintegrated into a nasty, doughy mush.  The fries were crispy which was good.  I think Flames on 2nd street was equally good if not better.  I don't get the obsession with this place. Something about it screems Chipotle...not sure if it's the artwork or what.  It was good not great. I won't go back probably.", "author": "Sarah B."}

The mini burger is NOT a slider and the larger burger is a double patty, which is not clear on the menu board. The guy who took my order  was a bit snarky, as he twice misunderstood my order and acted as if was my fault. (Then he dropped another customer's tray.)", "author": "Don m."}

The burger was a little on the greasy side. And I wasn't sure what the difference between and a super and mini burger was = two patties vs one. So if you are a light eater get the mini. The fries looked good, but the shake hit the spot. The strawberries were blended really well and I could taste them with every sip. I would go back to this place again.", "author": "Kristina W."}

So hey I decided to give it a try. Well burger was pretty good the fries are over priced, but hey its San Francisco what do you expect. All was good up until I noticed this employee behind the counter and she was wiping her face with her hands, grabbing the trash can and moving it around. I figured she would wash her hands, but to my surprise she didn't she continued to make shakes hand out food. I was so disguised. On top of that she continued to scratch her head I mean come on now. So when I asked to speak to the manager to my disbelief the girl that was doing all these things was the MANAGER! I talked to her and informed her about the situation, but to be honest I felt like it went in one ear out the other.  My fiance and myself will never return to this place. I'll stick to my In-N-Out burger. So long Super Duper Burger.", "author": "Theresa R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-10", "description": "So this review is only for their mini burger with cheese and all the regular toppings - no other extras.\n\nFor a mini its on the larger size.  For me, its just the right size for when you're sorta hungry but not quite enough for a full meal.  The place smells like garlic fries and its actually a pretty good smell as long as the smell doesnt leave with you - and let me tell you, I wish I had ordered some cuz the burger itself was just alright...  \n\nThe cashier who took my order was really nice.  It was my first time here and I got up there and ordered a cheeseburger.  I got asked if i wanted 2 patties and said no, so I guess if you say no you default to a mini (which i was ok with for that particular day but I wish they had a more inbetween size between a gigantor 2 patty thing or a mini...), then she asked if i wanted the regular toppings, i said yes (i liked that they give u a good amount of lettuce, onions, etc) and then she said the meat was done medium-something unless I specified it another way.  i dont do medium- anything for ground meat so I said well done please. so I guess that's the downfall for my dry burger. I'm sure the lean meat is the healthier way to go but I wish I could get a well done burger that isnt quite so... driftwood-like.  The taste of the sauce they used was ok but there wasn't very much in it.  I don't know if I'd go back.  I did appreciate that their menu had organic meat so maybe I will. I dunno.", "author": "S T."}

Don't expect this downtown SF location at 721 Market  to take a phone order- even at times when any other Super Duper location will eagerly answer their phone and apologize for their slacker co-workers at 721 Market.  Today (a Thursday) around 6pm, super-nice 'Charlie' at the Castro location and equally helpful 'Ali' at the Chestnut location both assumed their downtown counterparts 'must be really busy' if they are not answering their phone.   I tried calling 4 times with no success - and so expected to get to 721 Market and see a big long line. Instead there were only 2 people total in line being helped by 2 cashiers-  at 2 out of 3 cash registers. At 6pm this place was not busy like it can be during downtown lunch hour.  I counted 21 empty tables-for-two and all counter stools empty and counted 6 people waiting for to-go orders- which meant the place was basically half empty=  NOT REALLY BUSY.  Waiting for your to-go order really gives you a chance to see how this place employees two classes of workers: those who hustle- and those who don't.  Two of the 20-something hipster staff up front had time to let their Chrome-bag-clad friends wander behind the counter and celebrate a birthday with them.   But none of the guys in the back doing the actual cooking had time to join in the birthday wishes.   My food was ready fast- which was not a surprise since there were so few customers there - and once you get your order in, the cooks in the back really hustle- even while the kids up front are too busy talking to friends to take a telephone order!", "author": "Chris R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-05-22", "description": "Had I written this review when I first went in, it would be a five stars and they have been declining ever since. Today was the last straw. I order the same thing everytime and today they charged me two dollars more than what it should cost and in the end, I only got 1.50 back. The real problem: Inconsistency and it's all about them, not the customer. Sometimes they charge the right price, sometimes not. Sometimes they get your order right and sometimes not. Sometimes their veggie burgers are good and other times burnt to a crisp and don't even get me started on the fries! But don't complain, geez, they just can't be bothered and when you question them, you instantly become the devil. Their fries used to be good and now are stale and could be the worst ever. Maybe the garlic fries are better but I don't know why a burger joint can't make the same fries over and over again. McDonalds does it. Super Duper has such potential, yet they don't care a bit about the customer or providing a good, quality food experience time and time again. Maybe that's why they offer cheap booze to put in their shakes?? I used to see the same people in there, but they aren't going there anymore either.", "author": "Rachel M."}
