He coaxed cocktails and wine from the packed bar quickly, put up with our indecisions and hesitations, made spot-on suggestions, and helped guide us to excellent food.\n\nI also loved the busy, but almost elegant, atmosphere. And, the simple \"grill\" food of quality fish and fries definitely has appeal as a contrast to the ueber complex offerings elsewhere. And, the sauces for the fish were wonderful as were the starters, drinks, and wine.\n\nBut, folks! Two of the four of us were served fish that was cold, solid and raw right under the grilled 1/8 inch top layer. Different fish, but both had to go back as they were way worse than merely underdone. \n\nIn the end the two of us who had the weirdly uncooked meals had to rush through the re-fired and late-delivered course to get to our performances on time.\n\nThe Grill needs some serious training of the line cooks. Nice menu, great service, top quality food... and you serve the salmon absolutely raw? \n\nI like the vibe, even the too-loud noise. Great, simple menu. But, let me eat COOKED food next time.", "author": "Galen W."}

So I guess they have a good amount of return customers.  This place just isn't for me. \n\nI had the Shizuan chicken salad, and it came with noodles. It was just spicy chicken on top of lettuce. I'm glad it came with noodles on the side because that was the best part. This salad option seems so out of place considering the other items available. But that's why I ordered it, hoping it would stand out in flavor. It did not. I should've just ordered one of their fish options because that's what they do best. \n\nThe other good thing about this restaurant is their wine menu. They do have a really good selection of wine.

It was a \" so ready to order?\". \nThe Grill obviously has its following!! Very few customers were under 60. which was reflected in the fact that the food is not spiced and rather bland. We wanted lemon with the fish which isn't provided and had to wait to flag the waiter. We realize that everyone was on the way to the opera performance and there was a rush to get everything out on time. That's fine, completely understand. Nevertheless, keep an eye on your customers. \nSince dinner was unremarkable we passed on desert wanting to get out into the fresh air. \nThe choice of different types of fish is very good. The prices we felt were not a value for presentation nor other menu choices. The salads however; were very good and we had three different types which were on the smaller side and between 10-15 dollars.", "author": "Phil B."}

The oysters were good, nothing particularly memorable about them. Each of us also ordered a salad, except for my honey who went with the lentil soup. I stole a bite and I think he made a good choice, especially for a chilly winter night. For my entree I finally decided on the scallops, served over kale polenta and delicata squash. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish, and while I would order it again, I got a bite of my friend's crab cake and that bite was SO GOOD. Pretty much all crab, with little filler. Upon return, it will be a tough decision between the scallops and crab cakes. We also ordered a side of brussels sprouts to share.

Of course, that's the way their more frequent guests want it I guess.  We've eaten there four times in the last year and are likely to return for the convenience of the location more than the food or drink. The cocktails are well made but not generously poured.  Wines by the glass offered some interesting whites. Food portions are modest in size and may be too small for some and therefore expensive. $16 for a tasty beet salad is pricey especially given four razor thin rounds of red. Ubiquitous French fries were limp on Thursday evening, and I should have sent them back.  A side dish of kale to accompany my perfectly cooked halibut was almost tasteless.  The main dish plate did not look appealing at all: grayish white halibut on a white plate with a tiny tin of beurre blanc on the side.  A special dessert crumble was delicious as was a lemon custard served with fresh blueberries. Service was as always well-informed, professional, and efficient.  Would we recommend HSG to to others? We have with the kind of caveats outlined above.", "author": "Stu H."}

How many restaurants can keep up the quality for that long? Or put you on a list and actually call you when they have soft shell crabs or shad roe in season. I mean, who even KNOWS about shad roe anymore, this side of a Nero Wolfe mystery novel? While Hayes is convenient and mostly caters to pre-theater and pre-symphony goers, it's even better for rest of us more low-brow types. Why? Because the kitchen is less rushed and the service is better. They have the freshest fish (it changes daily) and do very little to it, except to cook it perfectly. I have never had to send anything back to the kitchen ever--and I have been known to be a little princess-y in the worst of times. Did I mention the sauces! Order the peanut sauce, (and save it for their thin bistro-style fries). But the beurre blanc and lemon caper are nothing to sneer at. What to order? Always the sand dabs if they're on the menu, or the grilled calamari if you're feeling minimalist. The hog island sweet water oysters are the stuff of food fantasies, always fresh and briny and are so perfect with champagne by the glass. This place could so easily be snooty given the posh clientele and the location, but they are always accommodating. They'll kill me for saying this, but they will let you change the set-ups--the fish is always paired with such interesting combinations of interesting retro vegetables like succotash or butter beans with unexpected but simple sauces but sometimes you just HAVE to have the fingerling potatoes and trumpet mushrooms with thyme that comes with the petrale sole, when you're having the scallops. They will let you switch. But maybe they won't let me do it anymore, after this review. But they always go that extra mile. Last time I was there, my dining companion couldn't find a parking place, and was 25 minutes late circling the neighborhood looking for a spot. The maitre d' actually moved a sign in front of the restaurant for drop-offs and let him park there. Talking about saving an evening! This place is perfect. My only complaint? They took the baby poussin off the menu. Oh yeah, and the hot fudge sundae is irresistible, and I hate myself for finishing it. Every time.", "author": "jaan u."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-09", "description": "It's hard not to really enjoy Hayes Street Grill if you find yourself there, invited - or urged to go - by others who love it.  However, it's easy to justify going elsewhere to eat high quality, well prepared seafood.  Here's why...\n\nHSG has lineage and credibility. They've been doing simply prepared fish long  before it was chic to do that. Kudos to Patty Unterman and her partner and team. \n\nI've always found several items on the menu to enjoy, varying from clean to rich, crispy to raw... so you'll have choices.\n\nAnother plus can be service, although I've sometimes felt it was a little phoned in (waiters of another era too used to doing it their way, or just walking around on automatic), it's equally likely you'll land someone ultra professional, warm and helpful. So it's a very mixed bag for service given the prices.  Today my father celebrated a very big birthday. HSG is an old favorite so we went.  At the end of our meal, the barman, Rodil, treated Dad like visiting royalty. Wow, that was lovely. To make a very elderly man feel special when he hasn't been a regular for years, and you're not the server getting the tip... that was some classy on-the-fly service. Service was competent today otherwise, but it can lack warmth. It's very personality dependent and I sort of wish that weren't the case. \n\nPrices, portions, value, execution.  Here's where HSG has trouble keeping my business - although it will always be a sentimental favorite.  The prices are very, very high relative to things like portion (modest by American or even European bistro standards). Prices relative to execution, also feel high. While execution is generally good, there are mistakes that shouldn't come out of a kitchen this seasoned (A far too heavily dressed Ceasar salad - and I'm a dressing nut so I practically never fault for heavy dressing; Fish that was sold as being medium rare, purposely underdone in the middle arriving instead well done; Prices - yikes... $28 for a small piece of fish and one side).\n\nPluses, besides usually very well executed fish and often good service...  Location, Wine List, Generous pour of a single glass of wine (at least today it seemed so), and desserts...\n\nOk, stop the presses and open a pastry shop for the woman making the sweets.  To quote my gourmande 11 year old.. \"That is the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten.\"  She's probably right. It was *that* good.\n\nI'd happily give HSG 4 stars if any one of those negatives went away, but I've been often enough in the last 3 years to see a pattern:  Uneven service, varying from chilly and aloof (I don't mean traditionally professional and restrained, I mean chilly and aloof), to warm and fabulous (Rodil: You added so much value to our lunch today, I felt ok about spending $240 for 3 lunches with tip).  The prices are the really weighty issue. It's so, so hard to justify that big a ticket on an entree these days - in my opinion.  If you're going to charge that much per plate, there needs to be more consistency of service and execution.\n\nStill... a sentimental favorite with awesome french fries, killer sweets, occasionally lovely people.  Worth trying again to see if they up their game, or if they're resting on their laurels.  I hope it's not the latter.  Hayes Street Grill has no practical reason to fall down on its reputation for good food, well executed.  Maybe there needs to be more attention paid by ownership?  Are we getting tired, overstretched maybe?  \n\nLet's hope they can pull it out and lift it up.  I'd certainly like to bring that 3 Stars up to a 4 or 5.  Rodil and the chocolate cake alone *almost* justify that... just not quite.\n\nGood luck. :)", "author": "Juliana C."}

We were meeting our Filoli group at the SFJAZZ Center for a concert Thursday night.  Because Alan was facing possible back surgery, we didn't get tickets when the others did and when he was improved enough to cancel the surgery I didn't think to get tickets nor to join our friends at Absinthe.  I scored tickets at the last minute and Absinthe couldn't accommodate us.  Alan reserved us a table at Hayes Street Grill, where we ate \u00e0 deux.\n\nWe walked into a relatively empty restaurant, though the bar in front was pretty full.  We were greeted and seated at a table for two in the middle of the restaurant and given menus.  We requested water and bread, which were brought.  There's a cover charge of $1.50 per person for this, which is fine.  The bread was dense, grainy and lovely.  We decided to share a salad, hearts of romaine w/ buttermilk-blue cheese dressing and watermelon radishes.  Alan was disappointed to find only three choices of fish to choose from, a Washington steelhead salmon, local swordfish and something else we can't remember.  He ordered the swordfish grilled, w/ a lemon caper butter.  I ordered the grilled Niman pork chop, which came w/ mashed potatoes, carrots and apple-cherry chutney.  I noticed on the menu that it was possible to substitute braised greens for the fries that came w/ the fish, so I asked our server if it would be possible to substitute the greens for my mashed potatoes.  It was, so that's what I did.\n\nThe salad arrived unsplit, so we divided it.  It was delicious, the dressing flavorful yet light.  When the mains arrived, Alan's fish and fries were excellent, though he didn't care for the sauce.  He requested catsup for the fries and tartar sauce for the fish, which he preferred.  My pork chop, carrots and chutney arrived on one plate, w/ the greens in a separate dish.  Everything was delicious and I was very pleased to have changed to the greens.  The restaurant filled as we ate and by the time we were ready to leave pretty much every table was filled and there was a line at the door.  The crowd trended toward our age or older, w/ a few 30- or 40-somethings mixed in.  It was a comfortably old school yet upscale place.  The walls are covered w/ autographed photos of celebrities.  It was a nice dinner and then a short walk to the jazz center.", "author": "Toni M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-30", "description": "I am of mixed mind about the Hayes Street Grill. It is caught in a time warp, but it executes its '80s vintage dining experience well.\n\nThe menu is above average (though not modern by any means) with the core offering being a selection of grilled seafood; you get to choose the sauce on the side (ranging from beurre blanc to a tomotillo/chipotle salsa). The salads were unique. My mother and I ordered the grilled scallops. We each received six scallops, which ranged in size from a quarter to half-dollar size. Not overly generous on the portions, but delicious. The gentleman at the table next to us raved that he received \"the best fries in the city.\" The beer and wine list were good. I had a Chimay Blue, which paired well with my butternut squash soup. I wish the sage in the soup had been fried. Raw sage can be somewhat bitter.\n\nThe ambiance is classic San Francisco bistro with photos of opera/symphony stars who have visited over the years. The clientele is on the older side, probably averaging 60-70. Many of the patrons were there in advance of the symphony. The vibe was quite staid. We sat at a table in the middle of the restaurant, which was sufficiently roomy and comfortable.\n\nThere is an undercurrent of a condescending/unhelpful attitude. When I went to hang my mother's coat on a nearby hook, the hostess told me, \"You can't hang that there. It can't be near those other tables.\" She then directed me to some hooks across the room, almost hidden from view. She made me feel like I had made some kind of blunder. Jeez. There were coat hooks EVERYWHERE. It's not really a big deal, but her snootiness spoiled my mood. It would have been much better had she offered to move the coat herself with a \"Do you mind if I move your coat over here so people at those tables have a place for their coats?\"\n\nThe service was adequate, but as the restaurant filled, we saw our waiter less and less. Even though our waiter knew we had a show, we had to sit a good 10-15 minutes after our plates were cleared to be offered desert or the check. The result being we ran out of time to enjoy a nice desert. I had their creme brulee 20 years ago, and it still stands out in my memory as one of the best I've ever had.\n\nThey are still operating on paper checks. Our waiter made a simply math error which I had to correct. In addition, they charge a $3 cover charge, which seems a bit steep for a few slices of bread, butter and water. But they are still filling the place every night with loyal clientele, so I guess they can get away with the additional gouge.\n\nIn summary: well executed, tasty, but dated food; adequate service with a hint of condescension; ossified clientele, outmoded front-of-the-house practices. I'd probably go back one more time to see if the creme brulee is still as good as I remember.", "author": "Peter K."}

Then onto perfectly grilled Alaskan Halibut -  I chose the classic Buerre Blanc sauce and was well rewarded for keeping it simple. The accompanying french fries were a self indulgent treat and perfectly salted. The Italian style broccolini ( we got a side plate to share) with garlic and a bit of hot pepper  was perfectly al dente.  As for the two dessert that  we shared- again the word perfect comes to mind. Classic zabaglione with berries was  flavorful and simultaneously rich and light.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-24", "description": "I admit that I was slightly hesitant about this place before going there last night pre-symphony.  I feared that the location perhaps had more to do with the relatively high ratings than the food or service--after all, who wouldn't love a decent restaurant that's across the street from Davies, and so close still to many other venues?  But with little time to plan ahead, we made reservations for Friday at 6 PM anyway.... and THANK GOD WE TOOK THAT CHANCE!!\n\nFirst, this place has an understated style--outside, it's your typical facade and could be anything, really--and inside, it's smallish, straight-forward and clean--nothing particularly outstanding to catch one's eye upon entering.  \n\nWe were seated promptly by a friendly and efficient host.  Our server arrived right away, and waters and complimentary DELICIOUS fresh bread was quickly on the table.  (Must say--that butter reminded us of the incomparable sweet butter one gets in good European restaurants.  YUM.  So YUM, we asked for more!  lol)  \n\nNot too busy yet at 6 PM, but the tables steadily started filling up throughout our meal, and it seemed pretty obvious these were mostly other symphony goers.\n\nI appreciated the fact that my lame-ish question of \"What are some of the most popular dishes\" was met with, \"The menu changes daily, so it's a bit hard to say.\"   (So what you see on their website menu is not a complete listing--but gives you an idea, for sure.)  And truly, the menu had that day's date printed on it--they're not kidding about using fresh ingredients.\n\nAnyway, I started with the Warm Goat Cheese salad with Toasted Pecans--served with a balsamic viniagrette.  TO DIE FOR.  Seriously.  Like dessert.  The cheese tasted so fresh, and was just slightly warmer than room temperature--perfect for a salad.  While I often feel cheated by a high-priced side salad, this was WELL worth the $10 price, and I would order it again without hesitation.\n\nFor an entree, I chose the Halibut with the lemon and caper sauce (you choose your fish, then your sauce from a list)--about $28, I believe.  When the plate was delivered,  it was looking kind of sparse:  nondescript white plate, piece of fish, a few sprigs of green, and a small dish of the sauce (see photo).  French fries were served in a separate cup on the side.  \n\nI had NO idea what I was in for when I went for my first bite.  But dear GOD.  That halibut was absolutely the most DIVINE halibut I've ever had in my LIFE.  Delicate, succulent, PERFECTLY cooked (to order).... It nearly melts in your mouth!!!!!  The sauce was light but beautifully complimented the fish.  It was the freshest fish you can imagine--and a nice, big piece, as well.  A perfect, perfect entree.  \n\nThe french fries, which many reviewers rave about, were good.  But...they were french fries!  Yes, tasty & fresh.  But still:  French Fries.  lol  Interesting to serve a spectacular entree with this item.  But whatever.  Honestly, they could have served Kleenex as a side with that delectable fish, I wouldn't have cared!!\n\nMy dinner companion started with the Asparagus salad (which had an egg topping and was VERY good) and chose the Swordfish as her entree--and while I'm not a \"huge\" swordfish fan, I admit it was rather light (as far as swordfish goes) and tasty, as well.  AND, yes, VERY fresh.  But we both agreed, my fish was the winner.  \n\nAfter our concert, we actually returned for coffee and dessert.  My companion had the Champagne Ices ($8 I think)--she enjoyed it, but she's really not a big dessert eater typically, so it's hard to comment (I didn't try it).   I opted for the Apple-Huckleberry Crisp with vanilla ice cream ($10).  Good, but not outstanding.   Next time, I'll go for the Creme Brulee everyone raves about!!  \n\nOne final note regarding the service:  I read some less than stellar reviews, but must say that OUR experience was exceptional.  Unobtrusive, gracious, timely, and attentive to the point that I merely had to turn my head in order to catch eyes with a server across the room, who quickly arrived to assist us.\n\nI look forward to returning.", "author": "Gabriella P."}

This is a place for people who appreciate the traditional San Francisco seafood grill-type restaurant equivalent to Sam's or Tadich.  It's a place for people who understand that when all seafood is fresh diners need to arrive relatively early in order to have abundant choices, such as the Rex sole or sand dabs expertly grilled on the bone. It's a place for people who like the outstanding and reasonably-priced wine list appropriate for the entrees.

I spread some of the warm goat cheese and pecans on their fresh whole wheat bread and it was the perfect appetizer. Really well executed. \nThe salmon was cooked to order which, for me, is practically sashimi-raw. But this large filet had a delicate smoky flavor while being \"just\" cooked on the outside. Only four tiny bones, but they are vindicated by the excellent spicy peanut sauce I chose (from among several options) and DELICIOUS wilted greens and fresh rocket. \nThe only reason for 4 stars is that the default side for the salmon is fries with the option to sub greens, which I had requested; I was initially served fries but the waiter made a correction immediately.  \nI don't eat sweets, but their dessert menu was well-balanced with fruity and chocolate options. \nParking is plentiful (but not cheap) nearby and several popular venues are one block away (Davies Symphony Hall, War Memorial Opera House, Nourse Hall, and more).\nCheck out their menu online, as choices all fit on one page with plenty of white space to spare; first be sure it's your cup of tea, and if it is, you won't be disappointed!", "author": "Aimee C."}

He laughed and told us half the people dining there were in a similar predicament (curse you, 101 rush hour traffic!), then assured us we would have our food with plenty of time to spare.  True to his word, he took our order at 6:20, and plates were in front of us by 6:30, giving us a somewhat leisurely 30 minutes to enjoy before walking over to the performance.\n\nDinner for 2, comprised of scallops and sole meuniere, and 2 glasses of wine, was fine, and came to $80+ all in.

The result was extremely disappointing.\n\nI'm not sure they deserve 3 stars. I give 3 stars to nice little neighborhood restaurants with acceptable food, good service, and moderate prices. Hayes was none of the above. Maybe 21/2 stars. \n\nOK, details, I had a 5 PM Saturday reservation. I was seated ... and sat. And sat. I waited more than 15 minutes while everyone who had entered when I did, and people arriving later, were served. It was not busy, I could see servers standing around. I kept staring them in the face and they ignored me. Finally I started to get up from my seat and walk to them. Then someone came to my table. I said they had been studiously avoiding me, and he said not studious, just accidental. Accidental that I was the only solo woman there? You guess.\n\nI ordered a cocktail, the beet/fennel salad, grilled opah with both greens and fries, and asked for bread, and also ordered hot tea to arrive with my entree. Drink good, salad very good, beets, fennel and radish in a tangy dressing. I was feeling a little better. The entree arrived, good portion size, everything LOOKED good ... neither the fish nor the greens were hot. Barely tepid. It was as if they prepared my salad and entree at the same time and then left entree sitting there while I ate my salad. If I had said anything they would probably have nuked it in microwave which would have made things worse. Neither fish nor greens hold heat well; a heated plate would have helped but plate was not heated. I gobbled my food fast in an unsuccessful attempt to finish dinner before it all got totally cold. I don't go out to eat to gobble food; I don't even do that at home. The food was still totally cold before I finished and my stomach paid later for eating so fast. The fries were fairly hot, crisp, not greasy, but fries don't make the meal.\n\nAlso, when the waiter brought my entree he asked if there was anything else. I had to remind him I'd ordered tea. When they started clearing the table they tried to take the bread plate although I had not finished the bread.\n\nFor dessert I got chocolate terrine with whipped cream and cherry compote.

I found myself forcing to finish the fries (I didn't want to leave anything on the plate, not in front of the bosses!)\n\nIf you haven't already guessed, their lunch items can get really pricey. Most of the entrees were in the 25+ range. Fortunately, this poor law student was getting treated out yeee.\n\nHayes Street Grill is a fantastic place which I definitely will have to come back. Hopefully someday, it'll be the case where someone will walk in and whisper in their friend's ear: \"look in the corner, there's Tom P.!\" Haha I know... dream on Tom.", "author": "Tom P."}

We asked the door man if the bar served food and he said no, but he pointed us in the direction of  Hayes Street and it was a good direction.\n\nAfter walking past some snooty looking places, we walked by the Hayes Street grill and read the menu. The bar menu that seemed to be perfectly priced and sounded amazing. Estancia grass fed hamburger with Grafton Cheddar with fries. I don't often eat burgers but when I do, I'll splurge with higher quality meats and cheeses. Basically, if they as you how you want it cooked, it's a good sign already because they're actually confident in the meat they're using. \n\nThe cheese burger with fries were only 14 dollars which was a steal for the juicy goodness paired with great flavor and a cheese that is melted to perfect that compliments the burger. The fries were perfectly crisp yet light and all in all a great meal. Great meals don't come this cheap usually. Although you may say it's just a cheese burger and fries, I was surprised it only cost $14 because it was that good.\n\nClose to the symphony and to Smuggler's Cove.", "author": "Rhoi C."}

Grill for 7:30pm. \n\nWe were seated promptly however; it took a minute for us figure out who was waiting on us. \n\nI ordered Halibut with the seasonal vegetables and my husband ordered the Salmon, also with the seasonal vegetables. We had the goat cheese, beet and pecan salad as well as the calamari dish. \n\nThe best dish that night was definitely the grilled calamari - if that can be turned into an entr\u00e9e' it would rock. \n\nThe halibut arrived completely uncooked! It was basically seared halibut. I told our server and he said, \"oh, our current chef generally cooks it that way\". If that were the case, that he served basically raw halibut, then the server should had mentioned this when we ordered. Instead of getting a fresh piece of fish, like all other fine dinning establishments would do. . . I got the same exact fish just reheated on the grill; meanwhile my sauce (for the fish) is basically cold. \n\nThe server brings back the re-grilled fish, then asks me later \"was the fish to your liking\"? And I responded it was cooked thank you. I know that is kind of short but please, you don't serve raw halibut and then play it off like it's \"in Vogue\" or something. I enjoy Sushi immensely and you never see halibut as a sushi or sashimi. . . and this is not a sushi place.\n\nThe vegetable sides were a joke. Overcooked cauliflower, with random pieces of overcooked carrots. . . I should have asked what the \"seasonal\" vegetable was because the table next to us did and they decided to order spinach instead. \n\nI will likely not re-dine here, it seems the Hayes St. Grill has already had its Hayday.", "author": "Kristina A."}

My girlfriend and I went here before the San Francisco's Symphony NYE's Ball and we had a wonderful experience! So, if you gave this restaurant a two because your pork chop was a little undercooked, then order fish (that it what they're known for you know). Now, let me tell you why I'm giving Hayes St Grill a five.\n\nBeginning:\nWe had a reservation. We were welcomed with a smile and seated very quickly. Our waitress quickly came to our table after we were seated and water came very quickly as well. (I love my glass of water!)\n\nService and Food Options:\nI was very tempted to try out the fish that I heard so much about but instead went with the prix-fixe option for NYE because I was in the mood for a full meal and I couldn't say no to the short ribs. It included: Six Sweet Water Oysters in the half shell, borscht soup, Niman Braised Short Rib, and Lemon Mouse topped with Candied Lemons. My girlfriend had the Grilled Calamari with Arugula salad. It ended up being perfect the meal to satisfy our palettes and our stomachs.\n\nFood:\nThe Oysters were a tad small, and therfore overpriced, so I wouldn't recommend buying them on their own unless you really like oysters. They were delicious nonetheless!\nThe borscht soup was soooo good.I had never tried it before and it was a little on the sweet side but very flavorful.\nThe Niman Braised Short Rib was cooked so perfectly with a perfect consistency of \"chewiness\" and smokey flavor.\nThe Lemon Mouse with candied lemons really took the show though. It made the perfect desert with a cup of coffee and was a wonderful portion for my girlfriend and I after the feast we had.\nMy girlfriend enjoyed her meal as well.\n\nOverall:\nA restaurant with great food and service (and A LOT of filling options).  the atmosphere is not quiet and private as some other restaurants that are around the same price range, but the food is definitely worth it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-02", "description": "There are an unusual number of negative reviews here for a famous eatery. I can dispatch two of them fairly easily: the clientele is too old and it's not as good as it used to be. In a word, who cares, and who cares?\n\nWhy would you need everybody in the restaurant to be a certain age? It's true that there's no music blasting during your meal, but I take that to be a positive. It means you can actually talk to the people you're with. If you don't want to talk to them, why are you with them?\n\nAnd I think the people who are comparing it to some fond memory of the place from 1977 aren't reckoning that 35 years ago, there weren't anything like the number of fine restaurants in SF that there are now. So Hayes Street stood out. It's still one of the 100 best restaurants in The City; that ought to be good enough.\n\nWhat IS valid is that there are some weirdnesses at HSG. One would think that Patricia Unterman, Alice Waters' pal, would feature California cuisine. She doesn't: this is classic Continental cooking, with tons and tons of butter; Julia Child would be right at home in their kitchen. It's not rich in the sense of goopy--you're not going to get artichoke dip here. But it's nothing like the kind of heart-healthy fare that's now springing up all over. \n\nThat's fine, you don't have to eat here every day, but if you want a scrupulously-fresh piece of fish cooked beautifully, it would be hard to do better than this. \n\nThe second weirdness is that the default side dish is a bowl of french fries. Why? If you want fries, go to McDonalds; I have no explanation for this one.\n\nBut I had a Petrale Sole that was truly divine, and came with fingerling potatoes and mushrooms in a dreamy sauce. My date had a delicious Sea Bass with beurre blanc. But this is not your grandmother's beurre blanc; it had vermouth in it and was whipped into a creamy texture. She simply skipped the fries.\n\nHSG offers two Niman Ranch beef entrees, but this is a fish restaurant, so stay on message. And be sure to make a reservation at least a few weeks in advance, especially if it's an opera or symphony night, and you want to go before 7:30. By 5:30 there's a long line, and if you don't have a reservation, there's no hope.\n\nLike most a la carte menus, HSG makes their profit on salads, desserts and the wine list. If you want a nice fish entree, it's less than $30 and you can get out of there for $35 per person. Skip the rest.", "author": "David L."}

The escarole and barley soup wasn't terribly good.  The goat cheese salad, however, was good.\n\nThe flatiron steak was good, and cooked precisely as ordered.  I had the grilled swordfish which was good, but surprisingly thin; the piece itself was normal size, but it was about half as thick as a typical piece of restaurant swordfish.    2 of our 3 orders of French fries were great.  1 was cold and stale.\n\nFor dessert, the kids' sundaes were fine.  The creme brule was served in too deep a dish and was cold everywhere (as opposed to the preferred hot on the top and cool in the middle -- brule, after all, means \"burnt\".)\n\nMy double espresso was only warm, not piping hot, when I got it.\n\nOverall, I gave it 3 stars, not 4, because of the service which was the reason for most of the cold food.  While our waiter was nice enough, the restaurant overall didn't deal well with the pre-theater rush which is, after all, supposed to be their business.\n\nWe arrived at 5:00 PM to have plenty of time to get eat for a 7:00 PM show and we ended up getting stacked behind people who arrived between 5:15 and 5:45 PM.  When they should have moved us along quickly in anticipation of the coming rush, instead they mozied, and then we got lost in the throng.

My friend and I ordered the Crab Cake sandwich and Soft-Shell Crab sandwich and swapped halves so we could taste both. They were both served on warm, toasty and fresh bread from Noe Valley Bakery, piled with fresh greens and heirloom tomatoes (they were so sweet) and a nice dollop of tartar sauce. The crab cake sandwich was yummy, with a very tender cake that had just a bit of crispiness on the outside. It had green onions in it, and was sweet and enjoyable. I liked the soft-shell crab though, because it had a delicious crunch ... which really set it apart from the crab cake one. I think it's so neat that they take the produce from the stalls around them, so you know it's fresh.\n\nAll in all, it was an $18 well spent.

At a high end restaurant, one pays for service, quality, unflappable efficiency and genuine interest in customers -- yes, and food, but anyone can cook.  Few can put it all together like Hayes Street Grill does.   Plating a food doesn't need to be an art form either.  I feel relaxed here, served well, respected, and always pleased when I leave.  I found the complaints here disturbing and, frankly, unbelievable (or at best, exaggerated).  One wonders if the diners mentioned it to anyone at the restaurant to see the reaction.

I'm not usually a huge Pinot Noir fan, but our table of 4 went through 2 bottles and I bet I drank one all by myself.\n\nLoved my salad with shrimp and avocado.  My husband's mushroom soup was good, as was our friends chopped salad. \n\nThe waiter said not to order the yellow tail off the grill menu, so I didn't.  I like honest waiters. They toed the line between informative and overbearing but did not cross it. \n\nMy fish, a mahi mahi  off the grill menu, was OK but not thrilling. The texture was great but the flavor was only fair. I probably did not help matters by getting lemon-caper sauce. I imagine the salsa would have been better but I hate cilantro so didn't want to get it.  My husband's sole, off the main menu, had a better sauce and was very flavorful with a nice texture. French fries were fair-to-middling, served cute in paper-lined glasses.  \n\nDesserts: I had the creme brulee, which  I usually love. The burnt sugar was the bitterest I've ever tasted, not pleasant. My husband's coffee ice cream was tasty but nothing extraordinary--I mean, it's ice cream.  Our friends' chocolate cake had a gummy texture and less chocolate flavor than I would have liked.\n\nOn the starters and mains, I can't complain that the sauces or dressings  overwhelmed the featured ingredients. If you like food where the single featured  ingredient (or ingredients in the case of salad) are of good quality and allowed to stand alone, you will probably like Hayes Street Grill. My personal preference runs to a little more lively melding of flavors and textures. \n\nEven after the 7:30 off-to-the-performance rush, service was lightning-fast. You order, the plates fly to your table. It was faster than some of the weekday lunch places in the Financial District.", "author": "Susie L."}

St. a few weeks ago with an hour and a half for lunch, hubby and I jogged over to the Hayes St. Grill. I had forgotten about this acclaimed eatery because it used to be impossible to get in, and besides I dislike the bland, nothing decor and the lack of connection with the street. But on that day I had the soft-shell crab BLT which was as divine a sandwich as I've ever had. \n\nSo last night when we were on our way to Woodhouse for a casual din, hubby said well you liked Hayes St. so much, why not go back? He called and managed to snag a reserv. with 10 minutes to go, and we got the last table in the house at 6:30ish with an opera-heavy crowd cramming both rooms. \n\nOn the way in I saw the notice on the door that they were going to be closed for 3 days in a row - holiday w/e. So I told hubby, well, the portions are gonna be big - they don't want to leave anything for next Tuesday. What I didn't anticipate is that every mouthwatering entry on the menu would have a dot next to it. All the softshell crab dishes - even appetizers - the petrale sole, the yellow tail, etc. - sold out.\n\nAsked about the other dishes, the waitress described the Ft. Bragg Rex Sole as \"small, like sand dabs.\" My husband didn't hear her (nor did he realize that \"on the bone\" meant that fish-bone picking was required;) he liked the dish - which was nicely pan-fried - but would've ordered something more substantial. It came with a few skimpy sprigs of watercress and the restaurant's famous fries (which really are good, if you like fries.)\n\nI got the Grilled Miso-marinated Bolinas Black Cod which was supposed to come with roasted eggplant - but they were all out of eggplant; so the substitution was a bowl of watery, sugary (like candied yams, my husband observed)  skin-on squash chunks and mushrooms. The theme of the dish was Asian and the other accompaniments were a delicious \"Japanese salad,\" consisting of young spinach leaves and slaw-cut cabbage with a miso-based dressing, and steamed rice sprinkled with black sesame seeds. So the squash, besides its other deficits, was incongruous with the rest of the plate. As to the fish, it was very fresh, nicely charred on the outside, had a yummy marinade, and was too raw for my taste on the inside. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the coupe of sorbets - raspberry and blackberry - which were supposed to come with a pistachio tuile. But since there were no tuiles left and a sort-of zweibach cracker substituted, our waitress comped my dessert. I have to mention that when I was choosing a glass of wine, she actually suggested the least expensive offering. I can't remember a server doing that in my entire life.\n\nMy husband ordered the apricot walnut tarte; I had already had enough walnuts - which were embedded in the creamy goat cheese mound on top of the underdressed mesclun salad that he had shared with me - so I passed on the tarte to my regret. The crust and the streusel topping were heavenly, as was the absolutely fresh-from-the-tree apricot filling. I had to work fast to cadge a couple of forkfuls before he inhaled the dish.\n\nMy decaf was okay; hubby the coffee connoisseur, after his couple of regular cups at Hayes St., had to go to Blue Bottle for his fix; unfortunately it was closed by then.\n\nI have to echo the comments of others re the emptiness of the room and the age of the crowd. I think we (60ish) were the youngest couple in the house. It was filled with elegant oldsters who exited en masse in time for the opera. Afterwards - notwithstanding a prix fixe din for $33 starting at 7:30 - it was a morgue. I have to wonder how our venerable institutions like the opera, symphony and theater - and the secondary businesses like this restaurant that thrive on their patronage - are going to survive when these deep-pocketed culturati go.

I'm afraid the answer is \"not very well.\"  Aside from the decor, which seems unchanged from day one, the food was abysmal.  Shrimp Louis salad brought us gray, pallid shrimp; hardly any lettuce; cubed avocado and sliced beans.  It simply had no taste or appeal and looked like something from a chain restaurant.  Next up, fried sardines.  They were cooked in old oil which left a funky aftertaste (and indigestion) for both of us the rest of the night.  And that's saying something given my strong constitution and tolerance of a wide variety of food.  {In fact, when we arrived home after the performance the first thing I did was make some peppermint tea to settle my stomach.}  Against my better judgment (knew I should have ordered something from the grill), I had the crab cakes.  Fried, flavorless and without any delicacy or sense of crab.  One of my signature dishes are crab cakes made with blue crab from the Chesapeake, but Dungeness can work too.  These were a pale imitation of crab cakes, and again, had the whiff of old oil.  On the other hand, the french fries are still very good and worth checking out.  Trying to cut our losses, we opted to split a dessert.  Panna Cotta with raspberries; hard to mess up right?  Served in a ramekin that resembled a juice glass, which proved to be too tall to provide a balanced taste with each spoonful.  But the clincher for me was when my wife observed that it tasted just like raspberry yogurt.  And she was absolutely right.  For the price, this was a dismal experience and poor value.  In light of the many dining options in the city and in Hayes Valley, I have no plans to ever return to the HSG.  What a shame.  My, how the mighty have fallen...", "author": "Chris B."}

My eyes burnt a little.  When we left we both smelled like a deep fryer - which is really gross and made me self conscious at the opera.  I expect something like that from a greasy spoon but not from a normal restaurant  that services a lot of opera and symphony patrons.

For those who don't know it, HSG is one of the classics for a slightly older generation to dine at before the Opera or the Symphony, so it's actually easier to get a table after 7:30pm than say at six pm. That said, it has that neighborhood feel and walk-ins are definitely welcome and expected.\n\nFor starters, my friend and I went with the Farmers' Market Chopped Salad, which I thought was one of the better versions I've tried. We also tried the Shrimp Salad, which was pretty good as well. Nothing fancy but I think what HSG is about is preparing classic dishes and doing them right. The menu, by the way, changes daily, a sign of their frequent repeat diners.\n\nFor a city so close to the water, most of our official seafood restaurants are terrible. HSG (along with the Pacific Cafe) seem to be the exceptions. We tried two of the standard fish entrees - and both the Alaskan Halibut and Alaskan Salmon were freshly grilled and delicious. You can order sauces for dipping (the Beurre Blanc and Herb Shallot Butter are nice options), but the beauty is that HSG lets the fish stand on its own. Again, nothing fancy, just thoughtful and skilled preparation.\n\nNote:  For the non-seafood lover, there are plenty of alternatives -the House-Made Boudin Blanc Sausages and the Niman Pork Chop both looked like stand-outs from my table observation.\n\nThe wine list is classic too, and there are some nice options by the glass - my recommendation is to make your menu selection and then let the able staff suggest a pairing.\n\nOh, how could I forget, the fish dishes all come with big french fries, nice and golden and crisp.\n\nI noticed two reviews from Sameer S. and Big C. for this place - they're both anonymous - go figure, they sound like chumps!", "author": "Nish N."}

While there are a lot of new, slick, fancy places to go in Hayes Valley, I do like that this place is still here (but I like the new places too).  Whenever I've come in, the host and bartender are friendly and accommodating.  Most recently we popped in just before closing to get some dessert.  My bf had a chocolate sour cream cake with coffee ice cream and I had a berry pudding with whipped cream -- we were both very happy with our desserts!  In prior visits, I've had dinner here, usually selecting from their fresh fish of the day with french fries.  This combo has never disappointed. The wines have always been good -- I remember once they had a gewurztraminer wine and a gewurztraminer juice so I ordered both to compare, which was kind of fun.

I've heard about it forever and always wanted to try it but was hugely disappointed overall. In my opinion, it's way too expensive for what you get and the decor/atmosphere is depressing.\n\n      On the plus side: Our waiter was really nice and personable, not overbearing. The bus boy and receptionist were very nice. The Flatiron steak and the Scallops were incredibly good.\n\n      But other than that, it was not good. The decor is awful. I was really surprised at how dirty and shabby it is considering their high prices. The upholstered seats were all really dirty and obviously old. The walls are drab and institutional looking. The old, dark photo's in cheap frames all in a line looked depressing. The floor leading to the bathroom and in the bathroom were coated in years old grease and I was worried I'd slip and fall (we were going to the ballet and I was in heels). The restroom (by the kitchen) was dirty and funky - like you'd find at an old gas station.\n\n      While the Steak and Scallops were very good, nothing else was. The Caesar salad, at $11, was very ordinary. Did not like the French Fries, they were way too salty and had no flavor. The roasted vegetables (a couple of halved brussel sprouts, overcooked celery and yellow peppers I believe) were extremely blah - I normally love roasted vegetables but these were so flat and boring I had no interest in eating them.\n\n      While the waiter was really nice, he obviously had too many tables because service wasn't good. We waited over 30 min between finishing our salad and getting our entrees. And what was odd was, our waiter brought my companion's entree but not mine. I had to wait about 4 more minutes before getting mine. It was strange. Never had that happen before when there was only two of us.\n\n      We finished our entrees and waited at least 20 min with our dirty dishes in front of us before anyone took them away - then waited a long time before our waiter came by to ask us about dessert. We had had enough of HSG by then and couldn't wait to get out of there, so we said no to dessert and coffee and left.\n\n      After the ballet we went to Max's Opera cafe to have dessert. We loved it! They had a fantastic piano player, lots of cheery Christmas decorations and a very fun, sparkly festive atmosphere. The complete opposite of HSG. Wished we had eaten there, for half the price of HSG and with much better atmosphere.\n\nReviews for Hayes Street Grill\n\n    *", "author": "B. G."}

They were even less impressed with my mom's friend, who came in wearing tight jeans, a shirt of some sort, a very sparkley blue sorta scarf, and a sport coat.  My mom said that the little old lady one table over gave him 'the eye'.\n\nAll that is to say, don't go here for pre-theater food unless you're old, or like to pretend you are.  And to get a pre-theater reservation, you'd apparently have to call three weeks in advance anyway.  \n\nThe service was a bit scattered.  The host was nice enough to help me figure out what name the reservation was under, and seat me before my party arrived.  If we had been a little bit more expeditious in figuring out what we wanted to eat, and the service had been a bit more attentive, we would have had time for desert.

He asked me to try his Yellow Tail because he said he had never tasted a fish like that. He thought it was unique. It was just bad. \nThis is a place I want to like. I want it to be better. It's an old school type place. Man was I disappointed. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE look at what you're doing and try to improve. You have a cool place but you should be aging like your clientele gracefully. If you don't you will just die off. \nAll three pieces of fish were dry and clearly not fresh. The portions were small and the cuts were terrible. All three pieces looked like the last selections out of the cooler at Safeway. the garnish, look, who cares right, but if your going to bother at least use fresh watercress, not some wilting sad remnant. \nThe deserts, well we only ordered one, Cr\u00e8me Brulee, my favorite desert in the world. The crust was so thick it would barely crack and the custard it self tasted like poached egg. The free birthday desert our awesome waiter brought us was much better. \nJames (our waiter) you are awesome my man. A true gent and a professional in every sense.

We made our reservations several weeks in advance and we looked forward to a lovely meal before the symphony performance.  Pro: It was extremely crowded, but we were seated immediately.  Cons: The food was unimpressive and menu over-priced. Our waiter was in a constant rush, barely allowing us time to ask questions and could not give us any recommendations on wine or food.  In addition, after an expensive meal, we noticed a $10 COVER CHARGE had been added to our handwritten check.  This is unacceptable.  After inquiring about the charge, we were informed the money went into a \"health fund\" for minimum wage employees. I'm not against the cause, but it was not indicated on the menu and we were not informed about the charge when we made our reservation.

HSG deserves minus 5 stars for poor customer service.\n\nWhen the waiter came by to take our drink orders, I asked if we could have separate checks. And he said, I kid you not, \"You want NINE separate checks?\" Like I asked him to take off his pants and dance on the table. And I said, \"Yes.\" He mumbled something and left. My workmates were happy that I asked but we were all disappointed with his response. I mean this is a place where the LUNCH entrees are coming in at $25. What ever happened to customer service?\n\nThen the restaurant manager comes to speak to me at my table and proceeds to ask me how I thought that I would pay for lunch. Excuse me? Is this really necessary? Do we have to draw this out any longer with this public shaming of little me who just wanted her own check for her own piece of fish and not have to pay other people's drinks?\n\nSo I tell him that I fully intend to pay for lunch as does everyone else at the table. And then he incredulously asks, \"Do you do this all the time?\" Um YEAH! I've been to group work meals at all types of restaurants where the staff is more than happy to split the check. We don't care if you tack on the 18% gratuity; I just don't want to end up paying for someone else's excessive eating!\n\nThe he says, \"You will have to work something out with cash because we won't do separate checks.\" And then he walked away. \n\nThat left a sour taste in my mouth. \n\nI'm a 20-something making the cheese but not enough to want to eat out at a place like this for lunch and drop upwards of $25 for ONE MEAL.\n\nWith the exception of delivering the bill, our waiter only came by once after the starters were served to ask us how it was and then he never came back. \n\nNo eye contact or thank yous. \n\nThe only decent service came from the water guy, the bread guy, and the guy who cleared the table and gave us dessert menus.

It felt like a restaurant during Frank Sinatra's time. :) Diners were all slightly on the older side.\n\nSo food ordered:\ngrilled sardines (appetizer) - 3 meaty sardines grilled, very nicely seasoned.\nsausages (entree) - 2 sausages with a small side salad, nice flavors in the sauage.\nsalmon (entree) - grilled perfectly.\nbottle of reisling: $40 bottle of german reisling. gotta love german reisling.\nfries: good, but not TO DIE FOR. I thought it'd come perfect as is, but I still asked for ketchup, and wanted a bit more salt on it. I do have to say, the texture was perfect. Crispy outside, but potatoey soft inside.\n\nI don't think I'd be coming back, to be honest. The food was pretty good, but was very expensive for what it was. The service was good - our waiter was friendly and nice. The host guy seating us was cheerful and smiley as well. Bring the prices down a bit, and I'd consider coming back for some seafood and fries.", "author": "Carol L."}

It was a pretty good place to eat and the fish was always well cooked.  I returned last night with my daughter and experienced one of the worst vegetarian meals I have ever had (to be fair, she had fish and it was well cooked).  I get really bummed when the restaurant claims to create a vegetarian option only to throw a bunch of sides on a dish and then charge the price of a well prepared and executed entree.  It was an inedible mash of things overflowing on the plate (including cold cauliflower and cole slaw).  So, go there if you want fish prepared the old fashioned way; skip it if you can't eat meat.", "author": "Wendy K."}

Fast and friendly. \n\nThe next night, table was ready and the service was good. No snootiness to be found. The oysters were perfectly delectable, with the customary champagne mignonette for dipping. Wife's fish was great, simple and fresh as others have confirmed. My NY Steak was ok, I thought it was past medium rare though. Definitely possible that it was done in the oven. I asked the waiter and he said he thought it was indeed medium rare but immediately asked if I wanted to send it back, so well done there (no pun intended). So minus one star for the steak. \n\nFries are insanely perfect -- and have been for years. Wine was well-paired. A little pricey overall, but good value.

We cook so much and are such thrifty folks that a dinner in this cost area is a rare treat- something not to be squandered on the unawesome.  So when we heard of the plans, we Yelped the place, saw bad reviews, and tried to steer our hosts to another nearby joint (Zoya, Absinthe, etc).  \n\nThey were receptive to the idea, but after an interminable bitch of a time parking, being refused at Zoya, and recoiling at the dinner prices at Absinthe, the mood was dropping fast so we thought we'd just say fuggit and try out Hayes Street Grill after all.\n\nAs we entered and saw the not-pleasantly old-school interior, the walls covered in signed photos of marginal stars, I said a silent \"Ut-oh\" to myself.  As I looked over the menu, I found that the prices were nearly identical to Absinthe, but that the offerings were firmly traditional and markedly unvaried (how many ways can one serve grilled fish?).\n\nThe company was great though and we were soon seated (after a sort of uncomfortable wait, staring down wait staff that seemed determined to dodge our eye), so heck, we went with it.\n\nWe all had some form of grilled fish with fries, as none of the hoity-toitier options sounded all that good.  The grandparents each got halibut, the girl got steelhead (trout), and I got the sea bass.\n\nWe were offered no bread (where most other tables were), we were missing utensils and the general tone of the place settings were slapdash and institutional.  Bleh.\n\nWhen the food came, I was surprised to find the fish cooked perfectly, and fries that were tasty and had good texture.  The problem was, the entrees cost just south of $26 each and the supplied sauces left much to be desired.  I can buy two huge tuna steaks, make some wonderful side dishes and condiments and cook the stuff precisely to my whim for about $4 per person, and hell, I can get good fish and chips at a chip shop for $6-8, sans the stuffy, airless atmosphere of HSG.  Why do people pay these prices?\n\nI guess I came here expecting little, and would that the entrees were $10 instead of $26 I would be kinder.  I just felt terrible running up such a tremendous tab for the wonderful G-rents at such a forlorn establishment.  Next time, dinner's on us, guys! (and we'll probably make it ourselves ;)\n\nAnyhow, the place needs a drastic renovation, a staffing refresh, and a revamped menu to come close to its burgeoning neighborhood competition, but honestly, the place was rather full, so perhaps they've found a perennial captive audience in Theatreland. :(  Say it ain't so!", "author": "George C."}

You were opened by my favorite restaurant critic back when I was an impecunious young'un.  Back then I couldn't afford you, but I was sure that you were the pinnacle of wonderfulness.  Sadly, not so.\n\nA friend from the midwest visited recently.  I wanted to take him to a nice San Francisco restaurant, and the logistics pointed to HSG.  He has health issues--a heart valve replacement means he has to steer clear of alcohol, extra fat, and sodium.  We made our reservation for 7:30 so that we could get in as the symphony-goers were leaving.  We succeeded, mostly, but they seated us at a table for two right next to another table for two that was against the wall.  It wasn't until those folks got up to leave that we realized our table had them penned in completely.  Not only did we have to get up, but we had to pick up our belongings and move our chairs and our table.  It was weird.\n\nMy chopped salad was quite good.  My companion ordered the green salad with dressing on the side.  He got a plate of lettuce with a small cup of vinaigrette.  Now, granted, their green salad may be that simple, but somehow it was just odd to be served a plate of lettuce--especially for ten bucks.  It may be a stretch, but I would have liked to have had the waiter either provide some sort of caveat, or offer something else.  It just wasn't very happy, that plate of lettuce.\n\nMy entree was grilled halibut.  It was fine, but small.  The lemon-caper sauce is indeed delicious, but they didn't provide much of it, and the menu states that they charge for extra sauce.  My companion ordered his steak medium well, and they brought it blood rare.  (We were on a bit of a tight schedule, and he chose not to send it back.)  The French fries were fine, but they were French fries and ketchup--nothing special.\n\nI had the Meyer lemon mousse for dessert, and that was quite good.\n\nThe service was generally good, but not spectacular.  Our waiter was fine, but there were a lot of other folks (bus folks?) coming to our table who seemed fairly clueless.\n\nIf the bill had been half what it was ($100 with tax and tip, which included one glass of wine), I would have no complaints.  For that kind of money, however, I expected more.  I don't want to say \"meh,\" but--meh.", "author": "Earline A."}

I came to HSG for a quick bite before a movie at the Opera Plaza and had a delicious meal. First, let me say this place is by no means fine dining. It's one of those restaurants that was pretty popular in the 70's and early 80's (according to my dad) and hasn't changed a single thing since then. Literally. My dad asked, they have the same lady making the creme brulee as when my dad last came here in 1981.\n\nI had the grilled yellow tail with burre blanc, it was perfectly cooked and the sauce was so tasty. They really do their fish simple and right. And the fries... ooh the french fries. So crispy, so salty, and just the right size. The big surprise of the evening was our dessert! As a restaurant known for their fish and french fries, they make a damn good dessert. I had a blackberry satsuma crisp with fresh whipped cream and my dad had the creme brulee (which he fondly remembers as the best he's ever had). Oh man, those were gone in 30 seconds flat.\n\nAnother thing that hasn't changed since the 70's is the wait staff.

I believe the chef was Rhea O'Neal (from the menu).\n\nWe had drinks to start (while we waited) - my companion wasn't impressed with the rum and coke  but I thought the Kir was well made - even with using a very dry Chardonnay. After we sat down and had ordered bread and butter were served with a carafe of water and glasses prior to the first course.  I had a Cesar Salad (one of the best I've enjoyed in years) and he had the Warm Goat Cheese Salad - which looked delicious.   For our entree I had the Sliced Niman Bavette Steak (done medium rare) with Salsa Fresco, Arugula, and French Fries.  The steak was done perfectly and the dressing on the Arugula with the Salsa Fresco was amazing. It provided a wonderful burst of flavor for the dish. The fries came in a separate tall bowl - freshly made.  I did ask for Dijon mustard - which may have been made by the chef.  The fries do not need it I'm just partial to Dijon mustard.  He had the Bodega Bay Petrale Sole with King Trumpet Mushrooms, Thyme and Fingerling Potatoes.  The Sole was covered with panko crumbs, which meant I couldn't try it - but it smelled wonderful.  He thought it was good but slightly bland.  I skipped dessert (trying to finish my fries!) but he had a blackberry shortcake with freshly make whipped cream.  He said it was good.  We skipped the after dinner coffee that was offered as neither of us drink it.  \n\nThe decor is light and airy, and the lighting is comfortably bright - not glaring. With the large windows at the front is makes for a pleasant atmosphere and an intimate feel.   They have photos and mirrors on the wall along with coat-hooks.  The tables seat 2 to 4 patrons and are set somewhat closely together.  I commend the staff for navigating the rooms successfully!  \n\nConsidering the time we got there, and the fact that the symphony crowd was packing the place, the act that we were seated, dined, and done before the performance was great.  \n\nI'd gladly stop in again when I'm in the city - looking forward to trying their lunch menu.", "author": "Kiri L."}

The menu is clear and avoids weird combos and ingredients you've never heard of; always a bonus.  As other people have noted the selection of grilled fish with a selection of sauces is a nice touch.  Also, as it's a daily menu there's no obligatory reeling off of a bunch of specials you have to try and remember while reviewing the printed version.\n\nWe both had calamari to start (very good), then I had their Paella and my dining companion went for the Petrale Sole, which she thoroughly enjoyed.  The Paella was an interesting twist on those I'm used to in Spain - at first I couldn't see the rice, as the dish arrived piled high with shellfish - rather than cooking in with the rice this version seems to be assembled with seafood on a rice base, and it worked very well, all the fish was very tasty and the rice had picked up the flavours without being swamped in them.  The definite zing of the chorizo helped too.\n\nService was good - attentive without being intrusive, and the bottle of Gavi we had was a definite winner and a bargain at $30.", "author": "Jon M."}

It's right down the street from my house, but I've never been able to afford it.

I knew this when I called in two weeks earlier to make the reservations and they told me that they were booked until after 7pm.  In case you didn't already know, old people eat early. Needless to say, we didn't make it in time for the early bird special. For youth, this is considered \"happy hour\". Anyhow, we got there at 7:30 and the place was empty. There were several pictures on the wall that resembled the opera singers from the Opera house close by. We were seated and immediately waited on. \nFor an appetizer, we ordered oysters, and soft shell crab. It was my first time eating both of these delicacies and I enjoyed them very much. Then I shared the farmers market salad with my bf. For the main course, I reveled in the scallops on a bed of squash and sweet corn. \nSince I was a child, I've always hated fish, oysters, and crab.  As we discussed my most embarrassing childhood memories, I remembered how my parents couldn't pay me to eat scallops.  Now that I'm older, more mature, and my parents were actually paying for the meal, I decided to give it a try and It was unforgettable! \n\nAll in all this place was a hit amongst the fam and the bf.

A group of 7 dined there recently- ages  ranging from 20-83, before a show at the Herbst.  I am an avid locavore/gourmet home cook, and foodie who reads many food blogs, food sections of many newspapers, and dines out regularly at a variety of places (including all the latest, hip places in the Mission, incluidng the Folsom Street Food Fair, the Chocolate Salon, etc.)  I found many of the reviews not to reflect our experience. Every single dish that we ate (appetizers, main courses, salads, soups, desserts, etc.) was stellar.\nI believe restaurant-goers in the Bay Area occasionally become a little jaded with hip decor, cutting-edge food (many of those places go out of business in a fraction of the time Hayes St. has been in business), mixologists, etc.  The food and service at Hayes Street Grill was impeccable. In a nutshell, fresh, local, simply prepared delicious, seasonal food. That is what they have been doing for all these years, and it must be one of theh main reasons they are still in business.\nAnd, no, I am not related in any way to anyone connected with the restaurant!", "author": "J Z."}

In a party of six there were no - zero - high points.  Considering that this joint has never been inexpensive and considering that there are so many more options, I see no reason to return.

Doesn't matter how fresh it is, if it only tastes of \"grill\", we might as well have let cavemen cook it. We went for the first time last week. The salads were ok, an uninspired chopped salad and grilled calamari and cranberry beans. The beans were beautifully prepared, but the calamari was wet and mushy. Not exceptionally grilled like Chez Nous and SPQR.\n\nThe tuna and mahi mahi came out. My tuna had been grilled long ago and was lukewarm. My fries were cold/lukewarm. My husband's mahi mahi was cooked rare, although they didn't ok that with him. He ordered the peanut sauce which was really bad and sweet. \n\nI would have rather had a balanced looking plate with fish, perhaps some cooked greens and a hint of a starch, but the restaurant seems bent on living off its \"fresh\" reputation with nothing more. Service, however, was fine, though the waiter didn't seem to notice my husband had barely touched his mahi mahi.\n\nI attended a lunch there with Marion Nestle and was impressed. This dinner made me never want to go back. The kicker was that that evening I attended a talk on Michael Pollen (Omnivore's Dilemna) and   Patricia Unterman was the interviewer.

Again, I was left as though I were unwelcome and felt that way as well.
