I get that it's a club and they're trying to be quick, but I asked one question about the selection of cider before he rudely barked at me then stormed off. Shrugged it off, whatever. Went to the restrooms - was standing in line when myself and other ~women~ noticed there was a strictly men's restroom then one single all gender restroom. Across the all gender restroom is the staff&talent room. Some lady, who I assume works there, stuck her head out and gave us attitude for talking about the bathroom situation like she was pressed about it??  Obviously customers are confused..?

My friend and I waited to use the restroom near the back room and we went in at the same time because we didn't want to lose each other if we waited outside by ourselves.

But my theory holds a lot of weight.\n\nThe rundown is such: \n\nTime- 6 to 9. More like \"happy night\"\nSpecials: $3 beers, $3 wells. Got me feelin' some type-a-way.\n\nMost happy hours in the city are from 5-7, or 4-6 but nope, F8 has taken it a step further and pushed it to 9 with some of the best specials in the city.\nFor good measure, the $3 beers are your standard low ABV% brews: bud light, PBR, Heineken, corona, etc.\nThe beer snob in me brushed those off and went with a Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA for a whopping $4. This, my friends, is usually a $8 beer. My buddy ordered a chimay for $4 as well. Mind. Blown.\n\nAside from the drinks, the food menu (albeit simple) was great bar bites. fries, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, franks red hot wings (with an emphasis on the hot) and mac & cheese. We got a few items,  which I guess was from next door, and was all great. The wings were $6 and the fries were $4... both healthy (not literally) servings.\n\nHappy hour aside, the venue may be grimy and divey  but it gets the job done. Great sound system, super nice bartenders and fun crowd. Last night we were there for the TrapSF Trappy Hour and it was a proper way to end the long work day shaking what my mama gave me. At night it can definitely get a little packed but everyone is on a mission to have a damn good time... mission accomplished.\n\nCome in, save some dough, drink some great beers and shake your tail feather.

Everyone is always dancing and having a good time.

I've only come on Tuesdays to support my friend Amar's night (Underground Nomads) and our belly dance community, but one day I plan on making it out on a Sun for DnB night (love that these nights still exist after my beloved Phuturo was laid to rest).\nF8 is super chill, no cheap pickup lines in store for you (not on Tuesdays at least), they've got a great sound system and it's perfect for those who just want to dance or chill with their comrades with a nice cold drink in hand, and shoot the sh*t. However, my impetus for writing this review is due to one of the bartenders, Demitria. These days I find it hard not to be greeted with a 'too cool for school' attitude from a lot of bartenders; it must be in vogue to act better than the people you're serving...or maybe the reverse has caused bartenders to act in this manner (douchy customers)...whatever it is...it hasn't affected Demitria.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-10-10", "description": "This review pertains to my experience at the bar at F8, which I now...H8. Went there last night to start off the evening before making the rounds at the local soma watering holes. I had never been here and gave it a shot. Was quickly weired out when someone not \"even working\" sitting down at the bar carded me, which was fine but at least she was nice about it. The bartender, though a bit surly in her mannerisms , started off strong, getting my drink quickly and following up with a courteous,  \"how is it?\".\n\n She then leaves the bar all together leaving a disinterested barback to man the station. A queue for drinks forms but maybe we are supposed to help ourselves? At one point a manager (possibly) comes over and asks \"who is working behind the bar?\"; still nobody, apparently. The barteneder has left outside to hang with her friends. When she finally saunters back, she makes the rounds but despite my best efforts to make eye contact and polite gestures to call her over I'm completely ignored. The bar is not crowded and has less than 10 people there. She has now gone over to the corner of the bar and proceeds to talk/flirt to her friend for the next 10 minutes.\n\n After repeated attempts to get her attention, I give up and walk to the barback to get my card. He declines and walks away saying that she has to close out the transaction. I get the protocol, but honestly it seems like nobody is working here. The place is run like a house party with poor taste in music...which of all things was Grime. Grime sounds like two feral cats mattress dancing on a chalkboard and they have razors for claws. The sounds of their mating is then amplified by Daft Punk on cough syrup.  Not good. \n\nI finally have to physically throw my arms up and say loudly \"can I please get my card back?!\" I finally do, and it's ok, because no level of pissed off could ruin my love for the revelery and great bartenders of 80's Night at Cat Club next door...", "author": "Ovidio C."}

I can't stress this enough.\n\nCons:\n- Sound can be too loud, but more importantly NOT tuned properly so that the highs and mids are physically hurting your ears. EAR PLUGS ARE A MUST. This isn't Monarch.\n- Expensive drinks. $10 for a top shelf on ice. I can go down the street to ANY fancy cocktail bar and get a hand-crafted cocktail for $10-$11\n\nThat's it.

The bartender was nice and friendly and made a great drink.  The resident DJ was spinning some fantastic drum & bass so I was happy to stay.  Once it got a bit later into the night the people showed up and the dance floor had a good little crowd going.  I was a fan of this place and will definitely check it out next time I'm in SF.", "author": "Alex F."}

Drinks are strong but it was nice to find a crowded bar on such a random night. Seems like they have a good crowd every day. Two djs - outside and in - different playlist but essentially the same trance/house vibe.", "author": "Josh S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-28", "description": "F8, formerly Icon Ultra Lounge, is a good stop for free or cheap parties, featuring talented local DJs as well as internationally known acts.  I've enjoyed going on Wednesdays for Housepitality or 3rd Fridays for Freeform vs. Dubalicious.  With two separate rooms featuring different styles of music, as well as a bar area, there is usually plenty of room to dance and socialize, though it can be a little uncomfortable when the venue is crowded due to the multi-room layout.", "author": "Heidi M."}

They were playing House music only and wouldn't take requests, which was a little bit of a downer. The guy I was in contact with about reserving the table (Mitch) was extremely helpful and nice through the entire process. The girl that served us at the table once we arrived (can't remember her name) was super nice and friendly! Staff was very attentive to bringing more mixers and cleaning up the table. The venue is pretty small compared to other \"clubs\" but it was cool inside. I would definitely come here again!", "author": "Kristen B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-10", "description": "We stumbled into this place while walking by on our way to meet friends for dinner.  It was early and there was a great neighborhood feel.  People were drinking champagne - the bartender was sweet and attentive and even passed out little cookies to everyone.  A dj was just getting started - a mix of techno and some old school hip hop.  After dinner I went back to my car - flat tire.  A nice man was walking by and trying to give me directions to a gas station - I was in a rush because the GG bridge was closing for the weekend and I needed to get across.  Rob Hardy took one look at me and began going to work on my tire.  He changed my flat and refused to take any money - a real man does not take money from a lady in distress - well I found out Rob works at F8 where we had been earlier!  I will return to this bar for the drinks and music but also because men like Rob renew my faith in mankind.  This bar is for real.", "author": "Christie A."}

The folks from RESONATE always bring out some of the best beatsmiths and DJs from all over California to come up and perform. They have a main dance floor, and a back room. Cover is usually really cheap or free, and parking usually isn't a problem within the area.", "author": "Jay A."}

You can see some top notch acts without a huge crowd of douche bags.   Come to think of it, I get hit on by creeps the least on this night!  Fun times dancing every Sunday I manage to get there.  If you don't like dancing to electronic music, you should probably not go...everyone else DON'T MISS IT!", "author": "Alexana W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-28", "description": "I was in charged of a lot of precious jewels by Nova Scotia Smith (the Canadian version of Indiana Jones) I put them all in my backpack and the absolutely wonderful bar tender Christine kept all the jewel thieves at bay. Even when my sworn nemesis Dastardio D. Mustache came in demanding all the backpacks behind the bar Christine told him to fuck off. He threw his burlap sack with a dollar sign on it on the ground he declared \"Drat, foiled again, this is not the last you have seen Dastardio D. Mustache\" as he went away in his blimp in the shape of his face while twirling his mustache and laughing maniacally. But even in the face of this villainy Christine managed to keep an amazing atmosphere of top notch service and a help contribute to the friendly environment that this bar provided. As a person who has observed the many MANY conflicts of the Middle East during the failed peace talks between the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority one of the few things that Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas could agree on is the top notch service that Christine of 1192 Folsom provided. While in Mosel, Iraq and Ar-Raqqa, Syria and Kano, Nigeria militants in The Islamic State aka Daesh aka ISIS and the Boko Haram have declared their disdain for Christine and her amazing service, therefore to not think that she deserves a raise is to support ISIS and the Boko Haram, for real doh, this bar rocks and I want the people in charge to know that this girl rocks and she has done an amazing job as bar tender!", "author": "Max F."}
