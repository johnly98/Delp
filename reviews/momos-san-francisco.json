I love being surrounded by Giants fans and a fun vibe, so the culture is great. The food is good, but not my favorite part of the experience. Last time I went I had the fish plate - sole with garlic mashed potatoes and spinach. The spinach was well cooked and the sole and potatoes were tasty, but nothing out of this world. I stole some French fries from my dad and best friends plate and was much more satisfied with that potato preparation than my own.

We sat at the bar and Melinda (I hope I got her name right) was the bartender.  She was sooo loud and she was cussing and discussing her flirtations, \"whatever the f*ck she has going on with Charlie\" and various other items and tidbits of her life with the other servers and it just took over the whole bar.\n\nNow I know it was an odd time of the day, they weren't busy yet and maybe she just wasn't in work mode yet, but she just overwhelmed the bar with her personality.  Maybe that's a great thing when it's busy, but the trash mouth (for me) is never appreciated from someone working because it tells me they don't care about the customer.\n\nAnother reason I took a star away is because all we ordered was a chicken salad and a pepperoni pizza and it took a good 40 or so minutes to get that.  I thought my salad was being brought out about 15 minutes in but then the person bringing it must have realized the rest of the order wasn't with it and took it back to the window.  When I went to the bathroom about 30 minutes in it was sitting in the window still and then we asked if that was my salad and where the pizza was... so about 10 minutes later an underdone pizza was brought out with my chicken salad.  \n\nAgain, the food wasn't bad, but how can the Bartender/Server, Chef or Mgr be unaware or uncaring that food is undelivered/there's a salad is sitting in the window for 30 minutes without figuring out what's going on?

During my recent trip to SF, I spotted Momo's as it was near my hotel and the sign for Happy Hour.  I was fortunate enough to catch HH time and wandered inside.  The place was pretty big with patio and inside seating.  I decided for inside seating since it was a little chilly that day.  The hostess actually seated me right by the windows so I was also able to people watch. Since it was not game day, the restaurant was pretty empty (I am assuming that it gets pretty busy during game days since it is right across AT&T Park). \n\nOnce I got seated, I decided to try a few menus off the HH menu.  I decided on the calamari and prosciutto pizza.  I also decided to have a mojito for my drink.  The waitress was super nice, bringing the menu and water promptly.  My drink came out first and yikes, it was very bad.  It was almost like rum with syrup.  I am not a drink connoisseur at all and even I knew it was bad.  After that, the calamari came out.  I was very disappointed in the calamari.  It was SUPER chewy and the calamari did not taste fresh.  I did enjoy the fried veggies that they had and I ended eating most of that.  Once, the calamari came out, I waited and waited and waited for the pizza. I was just going to follow up when the pizza came out.  I have to say that was the highlight of the meal.  The pizza was baked fresh (brick oven style).  The pizza had the right amount of toppings.  Too bad that was the last dish of my meal.  (I actually ended up taking it back to my hotel and had it as a late night snack). \n\nWhat a disappointing experience!  I loved the location, but did not enjoy my meal at all except for the pizza.  (Warning to people to want to have a quick bite before the game, I would make sure to order to pizza ASAP so you don't wait around forever for the pizza to come out).

So is the service.\n\nDetails: MoMo's is across the street from AT&T Park (home of SF Giants) so it's a popular destination if you're catching a game. Despite it's flaws, it's likely the best of the neighborhood restaurants/bars. And it's definitely better than the food in the ballpark (unless you're in club seats).\n\nBrunch is only served on the weekend. If you want to get your drink on, the unlimited Mimosas are $20 - they aren't strong so you'll probably drink more than you expect. The huevos rancheros are pretty good but I'm underwhelmed by the eggs benedict. \n\nThe spiced lamb burger is surprisingly tasty; it's spiced well and flavorful. I can't say the same buffalo chicken sandwich. The burger is just a burger but I've gotten it several times and enjoy it. If you're trying to eat healthy, the go-to salad is MoMo's crab & shrimp louie - it's generously portioned. You could also get a Caesar with salmon or chicken but I find it boring.\n\nThe dinner menu only has a few extra items from the lunch and brunch menu. On a recent visit, a friend enjoyed the grilled Ahi tuna. The same friend swears by the margarita pizza but I've had it several times and think it's uninspiring. \n\nThere's a full bar with a decent selection of both wine and beer. Some of the cocktails are a bit surprising. I once ordered a moscow mule and it came in a highball rather than a copper mug. The jalapeno margarita isn't that spicy. But all of the alcohol is better priced than in the ball park so you might not be picky.\n\nAs you might expect from a place like this, it gets slammed on game day. Many of the servers handle the load well but some get overwhelmed. In general the staff is friendly, even when they are behind.", "author": "Jonathan B."}

It was served with two pieces of the best cheesy garlic bread I have ever eaten. The asparagus was saut\u00e9ed with big chunks of pancetta and covered with an egg which should have been runny, but was still really good. I am so glad I listened to the server and tried something different. I will definitely be back again, not just for happy hour.", "author": "Nelly M."}

Their flatbread pizzas are amazing. There's usually a good amount of space here. The staff isn't always the friendliest, but they're not rude either. \n\nThe only problem I've ever had here is having waited 20 minutes to get a waiter's attention, to get my check. After 20-30 minutes of waiting, I just stood up to find someone to get us our check. They responded kindly and promptly. This has only happened once out of maybe 20 visits so far; not a common experience.\n\nIf there's anything I think could be improved, I'd say it's the dining area interior design. It's not falling apart or anything, but MoMo's could easily be a much more beautiful experience with a general visual refresh. With a fancier look, this place would easily be my go-to date spot. \n\nWatch out for nights when the Giants are playing at AT&T Park. They don't do happy hours then, and if you're caught off-guard, you could end up spending a lot more than you expected. That said, even without the happy hour prices, the food is worth it.", "author": "David S."}

Giants baseball season is about to start!\nAnd that also means that the crowd at Momo's on game days will be insane! I've got some great memories throughout the years of drinking on the patio with friends and making some new ones, too :-) and just soaking in the Giants game day vibe.\n\nRecently, I met up with a friend on a surprisingly warm Spring day. We sat outside and caught up and took advantage of the Happy Hour from 3-7PM Monday-Friday *Cxcept on game days! Here's their insanely cheap Happy Hour:\n\n-$5 Pizzas (from Margherita to Prosciutto Di Parma to Veggie)\n-$5 Sliders (lamb, cheeseburger, and chicken), Fries, and Buffalo Chicken wings\n-$1 Oysters (tend to run out fast, so best to go early and order lots)\n-$5 Drinks (from Moscow Mules to Margaritas)\n\nWe had the prosciutto pizza and was really good. Total bargain for $5!\nAnd we had the fries, and really hard to go wrong with those.\nWith a couple of round of drinks and food, the bill was roughly $30. You cannot beat that at all. You'll be hard pressed to find a better Happy Hour deal in SF!\n\nHit up Momo's on a game day, if you want to deal with the crowds and fun at full price.\nIf not, go enjoy their Happy Hour on non-game days!\n\nCheers!

The wood fire mushroom & sausage pizza has real chunks of garlic on there which elevated the pizza to a whole another level.  And you can't go wrong with the pepperoni pizza.

I think that was extremely negligent and not very considerate of the inconvenience they caused us. The two stars are solely on our waitress she was very attentive and got our order correct.

The service was very friendly overall, though it was a bit difficult to ask for some extra items. Apparently, there are no paper napkins here and it took multiple requests before I was able to convince the servers to provide an extra bowl to share some soup.\n\nThe first word that comes to mind when thinking about the food here is: sodium. The amount of salt in their dishes is through the roof! I got to try both the prosciutto pizza and the french onion soup. The prosciutto pizza had a nice light thin crust that made it feel less heavy than the typical pizza and also had pieces of arugula that added a freshness to the dish. They just need to chill with the salt a bit. The french onion soup would've also been a delightful treat if not for the kilograms of sodium within. It comes with a cheesy crust on top which was done beautifully for a chewy texture with a light outer crisp.\n\nThe third dish we ordered were the raw oysters which came at a high price tag of $3 each. They were by far the smallest pieces of oysters on the half shell I have ever seen, being the size of earbuds. I was quite disappointed looking at them when they came out, but I must say, there is something absurdly special about these oysters.

It came with prosciutto, spicy calabrian chillies, broccolini, smoked gouda, red sauce, and it seemed like there was mozzarella cheese on the pizza as well. I surprisingly ate the entire pizza by myself. It was very large, so it could be split between two people.

But I did get to try his fries which were super good! \n\nMy pizza was well pizza, but a good pizza. I asked for cheese and they brought fresh Parmesan which tasted fantastic on the pizza. Never had that before so I totally recommend it. It was a little greasy but I didn't expect any less from pepperoni pizza. \n\nOverall I liked this place, but I had 2 issues. 1st was my biggest issue and that was the bathroom. I thought it would be cleaner than the stadium but I was completely wrong. No toilet paper, no toilet seat covers and trash all over the floor. I went to the bathroom when I got there and it was the same time as one of the hostesses. I figured she would have someone clean it up.

My sister happened to ask the host to move us since they sat the 3 of us in a very small corner. She refused and our service got worse after that. This was during the 2014 World Series and the Giants were playing the Royals. The place was packed. But the worst part of this experience is that I found hair in the pizza we ordered. Not just a strand but deliberate chunks of hair. We had brought the pizza home to give to kids and that is when I discovered the nasty hair. I am so glad I caught it before I gave it to the kids. My sister called and complained the next day and they removed the charge of the pizza from her bill. I will never ever go to MoMo's again.

My hubby and son ordered much better than I did, so I'm happy to raise them up a star based on their choices.\n\nWhat they do well = bar food. What they don't do well = fancier cuisine.\n\nOur table ordered a bunch of food, and the favorites were absolutely the pub style standards:\n\n- Macaroni & Cheese w/ham: Super creamy, bubbly & smooth. We licked the skillet clean. Nice cheddar flavor.\n\n- Potstickers: Very dense, yet tasty. The wrappers were pretty doughy.\n\n- Beet salad: a TOTAL miss. Basically a plate of greens (not micro mach as I had hoped) with some squared beets around the edges. Major disappointment, the crostini was chewy & didn't integrate with the salad.\n\n- Burger: Fine - but they brought the wrong fries.\n\n- Teriyaki Skirt Steak Skewers: Chewy & bland\n\n- Ahi Tuna Tartar: Yuck. Served 1990s style on individual wontons. The Ahi had lots of veiny stuff that kept it from being individual chunks. I only ate 2 of the 5. Also a whimpy portion, very little ahi for $17.00\n\n- Crab cakes: Very good flavor. Much better value for $17 than the tar tar, however still seems steep.\n\nNobody bothered to ask why we didn't eat the beet salad, the steak skewers or the ahi. If you go stick with the mac & cheese, onion soup (it looked good) and a burger. Fill your tummy for a reasonable price. Stay away from the fancier items.", "author": "Maureen B."}

We made a beeline to this place because of the hype.  Walked up to the restaurant at 4:15pm, and they were already checking ID's just to get into this place.  So apparently it's not family friendly because they have a bar inside and outside. We told the front desk we had a party of 7 and he said, \"We have a table for you now, but we need the table at 5pm.\"  umm OK, so we felt rushed the whole time which was weird because the restaurant wasn't even half full the whole time we were eating! \n \nA few of us got meals but some of us stuck with appetizers because we were gonna drink at the bar before going into the park.  So I tried the mac n cheese appetizer which was alright, nothing special.  We also ordered the calamari which was pretty average, nothing special there either.  I had a slice of my friend's bbq pizza.  Again, mediocre, nothing special.\n\nThe food here is pretty mediocre and nothing special which deserves 3 stars, but had to move it down to 2 because they told us we had to be done by 5pm because the table was reserved.

It was before a giants game so we grabbed a seat at the bar. I ordered at pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries and my friend ordered a cobb salad with a beer; a hefeweizen to be exact.\nThe beer came out promptly followed by two waters. Her words were, \"this beer is incredibly flat and room temperature\". Not wanting to be a bother as they were busy and the bartender was pleasant, she drank it anyway. *insert bitter-beer-face here*\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, her cobb salad came and the bartender follows by saying \"your pulled pork will be right out, the kitchen is backed up\". Game day, understandable. \nThen 20 minutes pass. 30 minutes. Almost an hour... and here my friend is, done with her salad and working on her third beer while I'm patiently drinking my coffee trying to hide my frustration due to hunger. Our bartender emphasized with us, continuously went to the kitchen to check on the status and updated me. Come to find out, \"the sandwich came out a while ago\".... Must have gone to the wrong patron. =( so he comped us a beer.  At that point, we were almost late to the game and I wasn't too hungry anymore.\n\nAnd, low and behold, the sandwich arrives in all its glory. It was small, but the pulled pork itself was remarkable. The sweet potato fries, on the other  hand, were cold but we were so crunched with time it didn't matter.\n\nAll in all, would I pay $15 for a small pulled pork sandwich again? Absolutely not. There is far less expensive, far better food in the area. $50 later, I left and got garlic fries and chicken tenders at the game because I was still hungry.\n\nWhat saved MoMo's for me was the incredible bar staff who was not only personal but also empathetic/understanding of our situation instead of brushing us off because I wasn't drinking.

No reservations, but they didn't have any issue seating us since it was so early. Lots of small company Christmas dinners going on later, though. Here's the rundown:\n\nAtmosphere: Located across from AT&T Park, I knew this as the place to grab a drink before, during, or after a game, but I had never stopped by. Inside, it's pretty upscale. White table clothes and a well-dressed staff. They constantly refill your water glasses and are very professional throughout the meal. \n\nFood: It's definitely on the pricier side, but this is prime real estate. I ordered the crab cakes for $26 and my friend ordered the cioppino. The three crab cakes were pretty good, not too oily, but still had a nice crisp outer shell and a good crab flavor. The remoulade that came with it was also pretty tasty. My friend seemed pretty content with his cioppino.\n\nWould I return? Quite possibly. It's a classy place with a great location. We also noticed they offer a bottomless mimosa brunch. Probably one of the rare places that does in SOMA.", "author": "Leana L."}

The meat was the only thing that stuck out which the key ingredient but I also have to add the size of the burger itself. It was like a hot pocket; small. They served like 10 fries on the plate too, which made me mad for $11. The menu needs to be fixed too, because my burger was suppose to come with a fried egg...instead the waitress said, the menu is \"confusing\" so I had to end up paying for a fried egg.

Since MoMo's is across from ATT Ball Park, and is touted as a sports bar, my expectations for the quality of food weren't high. Yes, it is a sports bar with plenty of big screens, yet on a Sunday evening it was quiet and intimate. Our party of four enjoyed excellent service and a very good meal. The beet salad could have used a few more beets, but it was fresh and big enough to split. The lamb burger with sweet potato fries received a thumbs up from one guest and a \"good but overcooked\" from another. The gumbo and the cioppino were top notch.

Us girls had a Cosmopolitan and the guys had Beers (I believe Laganitas IPA).\nI had a nice buzz on for the game because I'm what one would call a 'light' drinker. lol...\nAnyway 3 stars for the food. 4stars for fast service and friendly server despite the fact there were MILLIONS of people.\n\nI actually would give MoMo's 5 stars for ambience.

We were a party of 8 but we were basically ignored as we waited 30 minutes to get our food ordered plus drinks. We never saw the waiter after again after the food came.  We waited for another 20 minutes just to get our bill with about 20 customers in house.  I snagged another waitress who promptly handle the charge.

The salad was well dressed but it was mostly lettuce and arugula (maybe a couple of walnuts).\n\nMy salmon dish was A-OK. It was served on top of corn, zucchini and beats. It was the only low carb option on the menu, so I went for it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-09", "description": "Yesterday was the big JPMCC, we decided that MoMo's was going to be the after party. This is a great venue and the location couldn't be better.  From the patio to the dining room, you get an excellent view of AT&T Park, the high-rises, the Muni trains and all the people walking around. You feel like you're part of the hustle and bustle of the city when you're there. So I give that part 5 Stars. \n\nFood -- The chicken wings... what I can say about those wings except for MAN O MAN they were DELICIOUS! They were Thai Spice; some sweet, some hot, and a whoooolle lotta of tasty goodness. \nThe Calamari was good and I would definitely  order it again. But if I had one criticism it would be seasoning. The flavor would be elevated with some salt and pepper prior to cooking or in the breading /flour. The Calamari as cooked perfectly and was very tender, I found the tempura veggies they added were a very tasty touch. The added dippers were an enhancement, but the Calamari stood on its own.\n\nGumbo-- Let me preface this critique by saying I am a Gumbo lover, will eat it every chance I get. Especially the homemade seafood Gumbo with crab, sausage, shrimp and chicken wings not CHICKEN BREAST! On to the Report! This gumbo was a disaster. Nothing in the bowl was working and honestly I don't even understand why it was even called Gumbo.  It was missing a lot of key ingredients like the File Powder; the menu said it had Okra that was nowhere to be found.   To me this dish was a bad take on Jambalaya if I ever had it. The chicken had no seasoning at all. It was swimming in what tasted like tomato/pizza sauce and trust me when I say it did nothing to help the dish.  The one good note was the Andouille Sausage was spicy which gave it a kick and the shrimp was cooked. I will on occasion ask the opinion of the servers just to see if they're true foodies or simply sales people.  I have respect for those that are honest. If you've never had it, say so. If it's not that great, say so. And Don't be afraid to make recommendations. So before ordering this I did asked the server how it was, and her reply was \"Oh it's really good\". Now either she has NEVER tasted Gumbo in her life or has the worst palate ever. (Salesperson)  ;-(     At Delancey's (down the street), their Gumbo is nothing but a few grains of rice swimming in watered down chicken stock with just a few pieces of chicken and sausages thrown in. A flat zero on the gumbo chart, but it beats out the Gumbo I had last night by a huge margin. I've read other reviews on the gumbo from here and I can't fathom how anyone would say this was anything better then absolutely TERRIBLE. I'm sorry , but I'm still shaking my head over this one.\nNew York Steak- My friend ordered the New York. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare but that's where the good news ends. Their steaks are not very good nor are they terrible.  It would not be my first choice, second or third. \n\nI would recommend the Pizza all day long. The pizzas are the thin crust with fresh mozzarella. I love the Sausage and Mushroom, the Pepperoni and the Margarita pizza. The pizza is worth a good 4 stars. \n\nOverall I would say MoMo's is a great place for Happy hour, pizza, appetizers and drinks.  Grab a seat on the patio, people watch and take in what the city has to offer.\n\nLocation -- 5 Stars\nChicken Wings -- 5 Stars\nPizza--4 Stars\nCalamari --4 Stars\nNew York -- 1 Stars\nGumbo -- (-5) Stars\nTotals ---- 14 Stars / 6  = 2.334 stars", "author": "AHodgee H."}

This review is solely based on customer service and the current staff. \n\n\nDuring my experience to this venue with my family, we were ignored by the two receptionists purposefully until we made an effort to get their attention. Once we had their attention they mentioned how the venue was ran (one side for the bar and the other for dining.) after walking around the place and assessing the bar area to be completely full my family and I walked over to the EMPTY/unblocked dining area where we decided to sit down and have dinner. Once the waitress noticed our presence, she ran to our table asking if we had been seated my the hostesses with a disapproving facial expression. We relayed the message we received about the dining area then went on to tell her we decided to stay for dinner and needed menus. At this point my family had been very disturbed by the waitresses attitude and began to be a little more assertive about needing table services. Right away the waitress decided she did not want to serve our table and called the manager to serve us (the waitress TOLD the manager she would not serve us because we assertively asked for her to provide us menus!!) the manager then helped us order some drinks and tried to calm the situation but at this point my family and I had already been disgusted by the service and the current employees to stay one more minute. \nAgain this review is not on the food provided from this venue because we did not even get to try it! In all honesty,  my family has been in the restaurant/bar business in San Francisco for the past 45 years and I am not sure how people like that are hired or even want to apply for jobs in this industry if they do not have the skills their job titles require. I know this venue is always going to have a steady line of customers due to its location but let's just say if it were anywhere else, the place wouldn't even be able to get people in the door to try it due to the horrific costumer service!

I was surprised the place wasn't too busy and we found some seats outside in the bar area.  The restaurant is kind of divided into two parts- there is a sit down restaurant side that's much quieter and then a bar and outdoor area.  The place is in a great location right across the street from the Giants stadium.  The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because the lackluster overpriced drinks.  3 doubles were costing us 60$ and it was not high end liquor.  I don't know if they raise their prices when its game day, but at 20$ a drink I couldn't afford to stay there for very long.  Another problem is that most of their beer had run out.  THey have a great bar with lots of draft handles but most of them had cups over them indicating they were out.  I don't know if they just didn't want to switch the keg or if they were really out, but out of maybe 12 taps I would say 5 were open and they were your typical light beers and Budweiser.

Hosts/hostesses are very important to a restaurant because they are the first thing a customer sees. They should be friendly and welcoming, not snooty and putting on airs they have no business putting on. Your restaurant isn't NEARLY fancy enough to warrant a snooty hostess. \n\n     Secondly, while we know that a corkage fee is customary, charging us $20/per bottle corkage seems like highway robbery. \n\n     Thirdly, you guys sneaked on to our bill an 18% service charge... for a group of only four?!?  I've seen many restaurants do this for a group of six or more, but NEVER for a group of only four. And it was sneaked on to the bill. For such an uncustomary tactic, it should have been explained rather that just put onto the bill where I guess you hope that a customer doesn't notice it and double-tips the waitstaff. We tend to tip very generously (20 - 30%) for good service but the service charge was so off-putting, that we left the waitstaff with no additional tip. \n\n     I've been here many times and have enjoyed it immensely over the years, but I think MoMo's prime location across from the ball park has gone to their heads.

We were really excited, having heard only good things about not only the happy hour but also the restaurant/bar in general. It was a nice day, so we decided to sit outside. There was one server for the patio. She seemed friendly. We ordered a ton of food and drink. 4 spicy margaritas, sliders, fries, and 2 pizzas. My friend asked for the veggie pizza without olives. The food came out sporadically and the pizza came with olives. She reacted immediately. They took it back and said they'd make another one. 7 minutes later, the same pizza came out, as if they tried to pick out the olives and pass it off as a new one. Third time is a charm? They made a \"new pizza, with a HUGE pool of grease in the middle of it and way less veggies on top. Though the service was scattered and our food was neither organized nor properly served, we still didn't complain. Server went missing for a while but when she came back to ask about dessert we were really excited because it was my friend's birthday and she wanted the chocolate lava cake. The server didn't even acknowledge the birthday verbally. The cake was not lava and very dry. The server didn't apologize once for the service errors. Nor did she say anything about the birthday (even if you don't do free birthday desserts at least wish her a happy one or put a candle on it!).

Finally I got the opportunity to check it out this past weekend. We made sure there was no Giants game going on because we didn't want to be stuck in any crowds, and went around 1pm on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe weather was nice and we were immediately seated in a nice little table outdoors. It wasn't crowded, but there were a few other parties outdoors so it also wasn't empty.\n\nWe got our water pretty quickly, but it took a while before we were able to get a waitress to take our food orders. After that, it took another 30-45 minutes to actually get our food...so beware, it was fine for us because I was catching up with my brother who was visiting for the day from out of town and we could spend more time talking, but I was also very hungry...so if you want a quick meal, probably don't come here. I thought that maybe the reviews on wait time were just because the restaurant got very crowded during games, but apparently it's ALWAYS slow service.\n\nWhen we did get our food, I was pretty disappointed in mine. I ordered the chicken panini and it was far from a panini. Isn't a panini supposed to be a pressed sandwich? Instead, I received a flavorless, dry, far-too-small-for-the-bread slab of chicken breast between a definitely-not-pressed-and-definitely-hard-and-flavorless sandwich roll. The fries, however, were FABULOUS, which for me made up for it since I don't often get to eat fries. I tried my boyfriend's pizza, which he didn't like, but I thought was pretty yummy (the crust felt almost flaky...yum!). He did enjoy his french onion soup. My brother and his girlfriend also liked the fries, and seemed to be fine with their burger and french dip sandwiches, but didn't seem incredibly impressed.\n\nThe service was polite even though slow. My brother had ordered bacon on his burger (for an extra couple of dollars), but they forgot to add it. When he brought it up just to make sure it wouldn't be on the bill, they apologized and brought bacon free of charge.\n\nOverall, the experience wasn't the best, but also wasn't the worst--a very solid 3-star place.

Food has to be the highlight of my meal. Service and ambiance are only a factor into my experience but if the food falls short then it can ruin a dining experience.\n\nDishes were a little pricey for what it was. Appetizers in the $15-$20 range and entrees in the $25-40 range. We started off with the calamari it was average you can't really mess up calamari it is fried after all. For my entree I ordered the blackened salmon which had a small piece of salmon and a big scoop of jambalaya. My biggest disappointment was the jambalaya it didn't have flavor not even the slightest kick. Was there really pieces of andouille sausage in here? Because it was more reminiscent of a hot dog. Another person in my party ordered the gumbo which I tried, it didn't have that cajun kick to it instead it was more reminiscent of Italian flavoring like a tomato basil thick stew. The shrimp was also really disappointing tiny little things that didn't look fresh. Another person in my group had ordered the cioppino, it was definitely on the bland side and the seafood didn't impress. \n\nFor dessert we used our Cirque Du Soleil tickets to get a free treat the option was a chocolate ice cream sundae or chocolate chip cookies.

That was good. Then for dinner I ordered their burger with blue cheese and bacon. My friend ordered their steak salad.

After the game we had dinner reservations at MoMo's, which is where the crowd seems to go after a Giants game since its right across the street from AT&T Park. I couldn't believe how insanely crowded MoMo's gets after a game. The outdoor bar area was filled with people enjoying a cold beer or alcoholic beverage. \n\nFood:\nThe dish I enjoyed the most that was shared among the group was the Crispy Calamari. Nice and crispy on the outside and the prawns on the inside were quite flavorful and very tender. These were some of the most delicious calamari I've ever had! Both the cocktail and tartar sauce were excellent choices to dip into. This will be an automatic order the next time I visit MoMo's.\n\nWith the rest of my food, that's where the excitement ended. I ordered the French Onion Soup (http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j_22pKNeT6KvvzH1Vbbqow/l) and Smoked Carolina Style Pulled Pork Sliders (http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/poY4okZvPrV6gS8HmJwdTg/l).

This tasted really good and brought back my buzz I had at the game. I highly recommend this drink for those who love vodka like I do. =P\n\nSummary (2.5 Stars): Great spot to hang out after any Giants game to get a few drinks.

Everything is SO expensive, I ended up ordering a salad and an appetizer as my meal, and my bill still exceeded $35. The food was disappointing in terms of portion and flavor. I had crab cakes, which had almost no flavor, and two of my friends ordered skewers which were so overcooked that neither of them could even finish them. Our service was disappointing, too. All of the appetizers and entrees came at the exact same time. The waitress also messed up my friend's order, leaving out an entire (important) ingredient, and basically ignored us throughout the entire meal. (I had ordered a Diet Coke which I finished pretty quickly, which then sat empty on the table while I wished I had something to drink.)\n\nWhen I went to use the bathroom, it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in FOREVER. There were bits of paper everywhere, but no toilet paper in any of the stalls. And I heard another woman saying she had been in the bathroom earlier and mentioned to the hostess that it needed attention, but apparently no one had done anything about it.\n\nFull disclosure: I came to MoMo's immediately following a Giants game.

I ordered blackened salmon and Erica went with a mushroom flatbread pizza.\n\nEveryone's food was just mediocre. We started with a tuna tartare served on crispy won-tons. I like the tuna, could have done without the won-ton. For entrees, I ordered blackened salmon. It was pretty good, well cooked but extremely over \"blackened.\" The corn side was tasty but the rice was not. Erica's gouda and mushroom pizza was quite good, and we notice many people with pizza on the table, so it is likely the best bet. James did not thoroughly enjoy his steak and did not touch his sides. Our wine was also not great, but that could be as much our fault as theirs.\n\nI'm sure MoMo's is a different place when there is no game, but that shouldn't change the food quality.

It seems like a fun place to drink before, during, and after the game; but the dinner side was mostly empty with a few sparse Giants fans coming in after the game for dinner as well. For a place that is decorated like a fancy steakhouse, MoMo's is actually fairly affordable, especially considering its location across the street from AT&T. A quick scan of the dinner menu revealed that they have a $29 three-course meal, which they advertise as the city's juiciest NY steak dinner. \n\nI started off with the daily soup, which was tomato-based with lentils. It was smooth and tasted cream-free and also went great with the complimentary bread. For $29, I really got my money's worth with all the sides that came with the steak. The steak was tender and cooked a perfect medium-rare. They let me substitute one of the potato sides for mac 'n cheese with ham. The portion size of the mac 'n cheese was very generous. The corkscrew pasta and cubed ham was great, but I could taste that the cheese used wasn't too fancy and was probably limited to only cheap cheddar. I ended up not finishing because the cheese started to solidify later and and became quite heavy. The meal was balanced out with a healthy helping of green beans. For dessert, I had a choice of three, but picked the banana brioche bread pudding, which was mushy but didn't lack the familiar banana or cinnamon flavor. For $29, the meal was definitely worth the price. I also tried ahi tuna tartare, which consisted of five or six crispy won ton chips for $12. Not worth the value if you ask me.

I was done with my food but not my beer and some lady (not dressed as a server) came up, put her hand on my glass and then asked me in another language than English whether I was done with my beer. I told her no and she looked at me like I was crazy. As I type this, a busboy picked up my hisbamd's napkin while he visited the restroom. What if he needed it when he came back. My pasta was $22, husband's gumbo was $20. Definitely won't be back.", "author": "Patricia G."}

The new bartender redeemed the situation by quickly getting us a huge portion of fries.

Its the kind of salad where they give you the heart of the lettuce that has no color what so ever. So unappealing, they need to stop that trend. It is uncut, sorry, I don't find uncut lettuce ooolala. It is just lazy. Leaves on a plate some cheese sprinkled. I asked for the dressing on the side, which they did, but its not the best dressing I had. I also asked if they could add chicken. It was obviously chicken that had been processed and bagged somewhere else. It certainly wasn't grilled chicken. And they charged me an extra $3 for this crappy grey chicken. It tasted fine, but so unappealing to the eyes.\n\nMy friend had the burger, which he said had no seasoning what so ever and was pretty bland.\n\nSince my salad was so lack luster we also ordered the toasted bread with tomato, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes. They were kind of sparse on the balsamic vinegar and it was a bit watery. Very little basil.\n\nThe best part was (sarcasm here) was that for two soups, two salads, a burger and some bread and cheese....it was $88! I could have had a better meal going to Safeway two blocks down the street and getting a sandwich for $6-7 and been more satisfied. \n\nIt wouldn't take much to elevate this restaurant into a good eating establishment if they broadened the menu a bit and used a bit higher quality of ingredients. Trust me they are rolling in dough at the bar, so they could afford to make better food it they so desired. \n\nCaution about outdoor seating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-03", "description": "It's possible that I was here on an \"off\" day, or at an awkward time... because I sure felt awkward. \n\nFirst, there was no hostess when we walked in. We stood around like uninvited guests at a party for people that were too cool to acknowledge us -- the bartender clearly saw us standing there, and was well within earshot, but just ignored us. I finally had to walk directly up to the bar to ask if there was a hostess. A minute later, the hostess finally showed up. We asked to be seated outside, and we were seated on the patio to the left of the entrance (from streetview). \n\nOur waiter came out, saw us, and a storm cloud crossed his expression. He looked PISSED that he had yet another table to wait on. He came over, brusquely asked what we wanted to drink, then huffed off to get it. We also observed him talking to the hostess in what appeared to be a mean way, admonishing her for seating us in his section. I think that his shift was about to end, and she'd seated us there anyways. Judging by the extreme shortness of her skirt, and sheerness of her top, she seemed more worried about how much skin she could get away with exposing, rather than paying attention to trivial things like \"work.\" I thought this was a family establishment outside the ballpark? Whatever.\n\nMoving on. Someone other than our waiter brought our drinks out. He appeared to be a manager or something, because he was in something more like a suit. He told us the specials, because our waiter sure hadn't. At that point, my boyfriend and I had settled upon the \"app + steak dinner + dessert\" deal. We both had a wedge salad, which was pretty good. It was served to us by yet another person -- a blonde, female waitress. After that, our steak dinners came, and were served by the manager guy. I'd have to say that the steaks were 1/3 fat, 2/3 meat, so that was kinda disappointing. The meaty parts of the steak were really good, and cooked exactly as I requested -- medium rare! And the sides were awesome -- snap peas and cheese potatoes. \n\nOnce we were done, we had to wait a while for someone to come clear out plates. Then, we had to ask to see the dessert menus. The blonde waitress was back at this point. We ordered the molten chocolate cake and banana bread pudding (I think?). They were both phenomenal. Best parts of the meal! I don't even remember who cleared those plates or brought the check. Drink refills were hard to come by, as well, due to the fact that we had so many people trading off the responsibility of waiting on us.\n\nWe were clearly just a burden on the establishment at that point, and as we watched various waiters starting/ending shifts and flirting with the hostess,and we observed the fact that no one else was seated in our section, it became clear that we probably would have had a much better experience if the hostess had been paying attention and we had been seated in the proper area.\n\nOverall, I think I'd give Momo's another chance because the food really was pretty decent, and the prices were not at all bad. Hopefully, though, we'll just have one server!", "author": "Natahley B."}

It didn't taste like the boxed kind, so +1.  It also had ham interspersed between the spiral pasta.  +1.  However, it had a taste that I couldn't really place.  It wasn't exactly super smoky, and it didn't taste traditional either.  I think I prefer Q's mac 'n cheese, but this wasn't exactly bad.

The waitress had the manager come out and the manager spoke to directly to our family member with the food allergy and confirmed what she could and could not eat.

String beans done perfect.\n\nDessert was a sundae, nothing to rave about but they use real chocolate instead of chocolate syrup which was nice. \n\nI'm going to give MoMo's a 3 star because it just wasn't that impressive, everything was just slightly above par, esp the price.

Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly personnel at the front desk. We had reservations and were seated right away. This is where things really broke down. The restaurant was not crowded and there were obviously ample staff present to deal with the light patronage.  We waited almost 30 minutes before a waitress came to take a drink order. Once she had our order she returned approximately 10 minutes later with our drinks.  She disappeared for approximately 20 more minutes and finally returned to take our food order. The food returned pretty quickly, which I expected because at this point there was only 2 other tables occupied.  The food was excellent! We finished our meals and waited 45 minutes after that before the waitress returned. She never checked on us nor did she ask if we wanted more drinks or dessert.  It took an additional 20 minutes for her to return with our check and when she did, she mentioned the automatic 20% gratuity because we had 7 in our group.  Well let's just say this did not go over very well.  We asked for a manager and were told that the manager was not on site.  We asked for separate checks and tipped meagerly based upon her very poor customer service. Just as we got up to leave, we noticed that the only other occupied table of 6 were voicing similar displeasure at the poor service they were receiving.  All in all I feel that it is very unfortunate that a restaurant with a first class location, great atmosphere and excellent food showed so poorly due to a dismal wait staff.

At this place, they will make you show your driver's license at the entrance.  I go to this place once a year, only when I absolutely have to.  You may think I am talking about your local DMV office, but I am talking about MoMo's.\n\nDue to its location and shameless self promotion, MoMo's has quickly become a San Francisco institution.  Located directly across from AT&T Park, MoMo's has become THE place to grab a pre-game drink or even dinner.  Be prepared for long lines at the bar, and forget about sitting on the patio if the weather is nice.  Don't think you're the only one who figured out that a quick stop at MoMo's might be fun.\n\nThis place is yet another example of commercialization of baseball.  MoMo's patrons, by en large, could really care less about the game.  They are more interested in getting a nice buzz before heading off to their Field Club seats in the bottom of the fourth inning.  There is nothing wrong with this, but it is that kind of a crowd.  It's not baseball fans going to a bar, it's the bar crowd catching a baseball game.\n\nI've been to MoMo's a number of times, and I always left the place thinking: \"MoMo's?  Meh.\"  The food is not exciting, and talk about overpriced!  Yikes.  You are definitely paying for the location and for people watching.  I would add ambiance to this list, but MoMo's lacks any kind of feel, really.  It's just blah.\n\nI came here a couple of weeks ago with a friend from out of town before the Giants/Dodgers game.  We wanted to eat elsewhere, but the place was too crowded.  He wanted to try MoMo's, and, despite my many warnings, we decided to go in.  After a 14-minute wait, we were seated in a spacious back room with mirrors on the walls and tables very far apart from one another.  The restaurant was busy and noisy.  \n\nWe opted for something new: their $29 prix fixe steak dinner menu.  It looked too good to be true: a salad, an entree and a dessert for $29?  Most entrees were in the $22-$25 range.  \n\nOur first course was the iceberg wedge salad with blue cheese.  The dressing wasn't great, but the salad was pretty decent.  The second course was \"the juiciest steak in town.\"  About 12-14 oz of low-grade sirloin was indeed juicy; however, it didn't make up for the fact that it was chewy, stingy and fiber-y.  It was served with slightly undercooked green beans and slightly burned potatoes au gratin.  The dessert, however was great.  The ice cream sunday, served in a tall aluminum martini glass, was mmm mmm good!  A scoop of vanilla ice cream, topped with caramel and walnut, with just a slight hint of dulce de leche.  In a word - scrumptious.  \n\nI will probably come back to MoMo's again, even if it is to take advantage of their $29 prix fixe.  Let's face it, $29 won't buy you a lot at the ballpark.  And why settle for a crappy hotdog or a mediocre hamburger when for the same price, you can have a below average steak brought to you by almost always friendly waiters?", "author": "Yan G."}

You're huge, you're flashy, you're packed, and I'm jealous of how much money you make (at least on game days!). But I have to say, for the type of restaurant you are trying to be, you keep it real, and I can't help but be a fan.\n\nHere's what you do exceptionally well: fried food. The onion rings here are the best onion rings I've had in my life (more shoestring style instead of chunky and the size of my head). I know that's a bold statement, but you know like how when you fall in love, you just know? I tasted them and I just knew, no other onion rings could ever compete. Also, I am not generally a fan of large-cut fries, but damn son, they have them down perfectly. They were so crispy amazing that I was stealing them from the person sitting next to me...without asking. I was ready to fight for those fries.\n\nNow, if you're looking to go the more healthy route, well they've got you covered. The giant chicken/pear salad is delicious and big enough to be your lunch and dinner! Finally, the salmon gravlax (crudo, essentially. But, doesn't that sound like a great name for a dwarf in an RPG!?) was spot on. Sure it's a little overpriced, but they don't skimp on the portion sizes, and for its location, I think it could be a lot worse.\n\nThe service has always been attentive and friendly, although a bit slow. But, the speed is of little concern to me when I go because kicking back on the patio on a sunny day with a cocktail is the perfect way to spend a Friday afternoon (especially if you're trying to avoid work!). If only they had some tanning chairs out there!", "author": "Kelsey E."}

I was able to revisit MoMo's during my lunch hour yesterday and was well pleased with what we ordered. 5 stars for food and service.\n\nCRISPY CALAMARI\nIndeed, it was crispppyyy!! Some places state that they have crispy fried calamari but they usually come out oil drenched and soggy. Not here! The ones here were fried with a batter that had a spice kick to it. It was delicious. This was served with cocktail sauce and tartar sauce -- I preferred the tartar sauce. \n\nCRAB CAKES\nFour round meatball sized crab cakes came out sitting on a bed of roasted red peppers and other spices. There was a little dollop of some chipotle mayo sauce on each crab cake that definitely went well with it. Cut a bit of the crab cake, put some roasted red peppers on it, and a bit of the chipotle sauce and you're good to go. YUM-O!\n\nMAC AND CHEESE W/ HAM\nThe last time I had this was on New Years Eve and I vowed that it was the best last meal of 2008. I still agree. This came out in a mini skillet which was about 6 inches in diameter. Sounds small but there was definitely enough to feed two. You can't eat that much mac and cheese and walk out of a restaurant feeling fine. The corkscrew noodles were still cooked al dente, and the cubes of ham were chopped up in tiny bits so that it wasn't overpowering the cheese flavor. To add to that, the top of the mac and cheese had a crispy layer to it. I don't know what cheeses went in here but I can safely assume its a mix of cheddar and parmesean cheeses.

It was busy with people drinking in the patio but we wanted a table and that part of the restaurant was not too busy. We asked the hostess how long the wait was for 3 people. With attitude she asked if it was for drinks and appetizers or if we were going to have a meal. (was that necessary question?) We replied saying we are going to have all three. Then she said it would be a 30-40 minute wait. We were fine with it because we were already having drinks. Five minutes later a party of four walked in and asked for a table and the same hostess told them it was going to be a 15 minute wait. We were kind of puzzled because the same girl told us 30-40 minutes five minutes prior. No kidding, five minutes later the party of 4 were seated before us. When we confronted the hostess, this time I think it was the manager, she said to give her a few minutes and she will look into it. We were eventually seated 10 minutes later. The original hostess apologized and said they were seated first because the had a bigger party so they got the bigger table. I am thinking so since they had one more person they were seated first? That does not make sense.\n\nNot to through out the race card but the party of 4 were all Caucasians and we are not. I am just saying... that was not cool.\n\nAt the end of the day, their service in the hostess booth needs to be reevaluated. The girls were not friendly and seemed to look down at us.

Peaking in at neighboring establishments, we encountered long waits for tables, or adrenaline pumped fans, still exhibiting stadium-like behavior.  MoMo's seemed to be the one bashful child in the class, so the decision was made.   The host was rather welcoming, and got us a good window seat right away.  Water and bread were on the table quickly as well.  A sliced loaf of sourdough bread, and whipped butter were a promising start, and the menu items looked tasty on paper.  I opted for the mushroom filled ravioli, with artichoke hearts, and asparagus, served in a bath of parmasan broth.  The dish, while attractive, and green, was lacking expertise of pasta preparation.  The individual pasta were almost glued together.  I did, however, enjoy mushroom filling, and the added asparagus, as it was fresh, bright green, and not overcooked.  My dining partner ordered the gumbo.  The smokiness of the sausage in the gumbo was definitely the highlight of that dish.  Though the other elements of the gumbo lacked Louisiana authenticity, it did have a satisfying quality. After tasting that, I had a case of buyer's remorse with my dish.  \n\nThe service was responsive, though we did have one awkward server moment.  When seated, a server quickly obtained our drink orders, and about one to two minutes later, a different server came over, taking out drink order, which were already addressed.  Not a huge deal, but evidence of a slight communication gap on the team.  Otherwise the overall service experience was good.  Be aware that a 4% surcharge is applied to all parties.  I didn't feel that the cuisine was so exclusive, that surcharges were warranted, so just be aware of that, prior to dining.  If seeking calm in the storm, in the AT%T Park vicinity, just after a baseball game concludes, then this is where you'll find refuge.", "author": "Damon Z."}

Me and my friend stopped in for happy hour after work.  We wanted to grab a couple martinis and something to snack on.  It was a beautiful evening and we sat on the large patio under a heat lamp.  There were lots of people out but the place wasn't packed by any means.\n\nWe ordered two martinis and a small pizza.  The pizza came out in 2 minutes.. unfortunately it was taken away 5 minutes later because it was supposed to go to a different table.  We didn't care; it was sort of funny.  But it took at least 15-20 minutes to get our first drink.  Geesh.. it sucks sitting around sober waiting for a happy hour cocktail.  And I don't understand because it appeared most people were just drinking beer and wine.  It wasn't like everyone was ordering pina coladas and frozen margaritas!\n\nOn the plus side, the drinks were super tasty, even though they were a bit on the small side.  The pizza was super tasty too with a great crisp crust.  Even cashing out took 20 minutes to get change.  Hello!  Please make happy hour HAPPY!

And I attacked this beast of burgers with great ferocity, as if life itself depended on the completion of this single feat.\n\nA look of horror came across David's face as I mauled my prey, food all over my face, meat juices dripping down my hands.

It is packed, pre-game with a nice mix of young sports fans and middle aged pre-game partiers.  Every Pre-game, they have two bar carts out on the patio, but if you are able to wrangle a patio table they still have waitresses that get to you every now and then to get you a fresh round of drinks.  The wait can be a bit though.  The prices are not the best, but are a little better than in the ballpark.  They switch from pint glasses to 12 oz. plastic cups on game days, a cup of Sierra Nevada, as I remember is $6.  \n\nThe place is just as crazy after the game as it is before.  But this is a place to be if you want to meet a player.  Not a too cool, I am god's gift to ladies type, but an actual SF giants team member.   Some of the players stop before they head home and  I have met a couple of notable Giants stars here.\n\nTip:  Get to know the Bouncers and Bartenders.  I was lucky enough to have an \"in\" by knowing a bartender outside of MoMo's before my game time frequency but even three years later, by asking folks their names once and remembering them I have gotten numerous comps and even have gotten to stay after closing.  \n\nOverall, this is the place for pre-game drinks unless you have read any of my other reviews.", "author": "Ben A."}

So we felt bad for her and so we decided to give her some customers to host. \n\nWe ate at the bar and we ordered the (1) sliders, (2) pepperoni pizza, & (3) shoestring onions. The sliders were decent, but honestly, I don't think they're worth $13.00. Each of three sliders were tiny (about 3 bites) and they were all lacking in taste. I didn't have the pepperoni pizza, but it looked pretty plain. The shoestring onions were a nice complement to the sliders, but it was just a huge pile of fried onion strings so nothing to really rave about. \n\nOur bill for two came out to a little over $60.00, which I felt was WAY too pricey for bar food and two drinks.

Standard food, higher than standard prices, lower than standard service. I would've given it three stars, but the description for two stars is \"Meh.

I have been here so many times and the majority of those times have been excellent experiences.  \n\nI am not a fan of getting cocktails in a plastic cup, but I do understand that they need to be careful on the patio when loads of drunk Giants fans are frolicking.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't been here in a while... I found Acme to be an easier choice as far as making reservations and the crowd factor recently.  But I have always liked their menu.  I have been to MoMo's for brunch, lunch & dinner and the food quality has always been pretty good with lots of variety.

Margaritas are ok but for $8 they should be better; they use Montezuma Tequila. I guess as I get older I don't want to put up with this obnoxious crap.\n\nWe head to the patio and it too crowded. I ask a busboy/barkeep why the opposite patio, which is entirely empty, isnt opened. He doesnt have an answer for me.\n\nAfter dropping about $200 amongst the group for drinks we get to Midnight when the bouncers decide to close the place down and don't give us a chance to finish, tells us to take them out on the street.\n\nNice job guys!", "author": "Chris J."}

I came here specifically for the Dine About Down event. They had more than enough choices for a first timer. My friends and I were seated at a corner booth and the waiter promptly came to take our order. We placed our order and proceeded to the bar for drinks.\n\nI had no idea what I wanted to order so I asked for the bartender's suggestion. I wanted a drink that's sweet and made with vodka. I had the raspberry cosmo, which was delicious because it was smooth. The bartender didn't skimp on the vodka - he kept pouring. The overall service at the bar was poor - it took forever for our drinks to be rung up. The bar wasn't busy that day and it would have been a quick transaction if he was sober. My friends ordered mojitos and he made it the lazy way (didn't crush the mint leaves).\n\nBy the time we get back to our table, the appetizers had already arrived. The waiter made a stink about ordering drinks through the bar and not through him. Not everybody wanted drinks and we wanted to keep the drinks separate. \n\nI ordered the following:\n\nAppetizer - Steamed mussels with pancetta, olives and sweet vermouth\nEntre - Grilled skirt steak with potato gratin, green beans, braised onions and Portobello mushrooms\nDessert - Chocolate brioche banana bread pudding\n\nI got more mussels than expected (a plate of 10) and the sauce was tasty and great for dipping bread in. The entre was well proportioned: a pile of steak with a sprinkling of mushrooms on top, a stack of crunchy green beans, and a hefty potato cake. The steak was just perfect at medium and I enjoyed every bite. The potato cake was baked and contained a layer of heavy cream in the middle. It was too heavy for my taste but it was ok. The best part of the meal was dessert. The banana bread pudding drizzled in caramel sauce was light.\nI had a chance to sample the duck confit and the volcano cake. The duck was tender and juicy (almost like chicken). The volcano cake was drenched in chocolate sauce and was very rich. \n\nOverall, the dining experience was fair. The lighting was dimmed to create a romantic atmosphere. The setting for dinner was nice - white table cloth and silverware. The service for dinner was quick. I would come back again for the food.", "author": "Candace F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-06-15", "description": "Went there for lunch on a non-Giants game day, so I'd consider this a pretty fair review.  Reason being that Momo's is across from the ballpark and most of the reviews are people whining about getting elbowed by a Dodgers fan, or because a waitress was \"short\" with them while trying to balance orders from a dozen drunken baseball fans.  To these people; Schwartzeneggar says: \"Stop Whining!\"\n\nhttp://www.collegeslackers.com/soundboard/arnold_schwarzenegger\n\nAnd back to the review:\n\nFor the price, the food was sub-par.  Nothing special here.\n\nOur waitress was so pitiful that calling her a \"rookie\" would be letting her off easy.  We were trying to decide between buying a bottle, and just getting a few glasses, and after several back and forths where it was clear that she didn't really grasp the difference (we were thinking about price and volume), we just decided on two glasses each.  First, she thought we were ordering an extra empty glass, because that would clearly make sense (WTF?).  Then, she tried to bring the second glasses out while we were about HALFWAY through our first glasses, assuming she would just plop them down on the table.  Perhaps I shouldn't be so harsh; I'd assume it was her first day on the job, but please, MoMo's: either train your staff, or just hire some common sense.  Customers are clients, not cattle.\n\nAt this point, I wasn't sure if she was going to bring our check, or strap an oat-bag over my head like I was Seabiscuit after a race.", "author": "Nate H."}

I didn't realize you had to order at the bar until I felt completely ignored and thought to myself maybe we order at the bar. I'm fine with that - no big deal. Well then I stood at the bar for several minutes then walked back to my table and tried again to order at the bar, this time both kids hanging on the table top waiting to order. There were several patrons, not busy at all. After 5 minutes standing there the bartender ignored me and the kids and helped 2 people that just arrived and sat down. I was disappointed and kinda pissed. So, note to the bartender lady, quit if your not happy, smile a little more and take a breath. Life could be worse. We heard great things of Momo's.

Food - we came here as a last resort because Paragon ended being closed on Sundays. We just wanted a good burger and some artery hardening fried foods at a decent bar food price so we figured Momo's would offer this - not so much. The restaurant and the bar share the same expensive menu - the $16 basket of calamari (granted they give you a lot, but because there's so much, there's no way 2 people can share 2 apps and still make it to an entree), $24 bbq platter with 2 links, 3 ribs, 2 lil chicken pieces, beans, and coleslaw. That's what my friend and I shared. And those were basically the cheapest items on the menu. \n\nThis place is a lil overpriced and the bartender couldn't even tell us what was good on the menu! We asked him what foods Momo's was known for and he hesitated and then said, \"We're known for being across from the ballpark!\" \n\n2. Drink Scene on Game Days - great place to go for drinks before and after the game. If clausterphobia is your thing, this won't be your place because it gets crowded. They even have a boombox outside providing the \"music\". Don't look to meet the man/woman of your dreams here, just come for a good time and meaningless yet fun conversations with strangers and $6 beers.", "author": "Jessica C."}

The crab cakes themselves had good amounts of crab meat, but they were deep-fried, which isn't nearly as good as pan-fried in my book. Also, they were served on a bed of corn, which was weird, and just drizzled with the sauce. I would have been much happier with a little extra to dip my crab into. \n\nFor dessert, I got some chocolate caramel something-or-another off of the almost-funny-it-is-so-standard dessert menu (sorbet? check! chocolate lava cake? check! carrot cake? check! fried banana thing? check! tiramisu? check!)

I'd only recommend 2 things - the drinks (which I didn't try) and appetitzers.  \nOur group enjoyed their fried calamari ($15 large order) which came with ketchup and tartar sauce, wedges of lemon.  The shoestring onion rings which Yelpers recommended, was OK.  A bit too oily.  I wouldn't order again. Their thin crust Margarite pizzas ($14) were good, but small portions.  \nI steered away from the $29 prix fixe 3 course dinner of NY steak.  Hubby tried it & said the beef was tough, \"been dead a long time\".  The fries which came with it looked like the perfectly formed frozen kind. He liked his dessert, a pineapple sorbet.  I tried the chicken/sausage gumbo.  It was spicy and extremely thick with a tablespoonful of long grain white rice on the bottom.  It was good but I prefer my gumbos with a little more liquid in it.  My Caesar salad was disappointing.   Pieces of romaine lettuce, dressing and ample cheese.  No anchovy!\n\nOur waitress was very nice, but the bus boy was another matter.  We couldn't finish our meal and asked to pack it.  He gave this look of disagreement (hubby only ate 1/2 his steak).  Made you feel as if you were bothering him with extra work.

I came here on a weekend for lunch and the food and service was fantastic. Don't come here before a game because my prediction is that you won't get the full Momo's experience.\n\nThe Blackened Red Snapper, Chicken Pot Pie, and Philly Cheesesteak were all very tasty and delicious. The Angus Steak w/ sauteed onions and portabello mushrooms was just ok. I wouldn't recommend ordering it since there are plenty other dishes that are better. The calamari appetizer has to be the most tender i've ever had and the egg rolls were great as well. Also, before your meal they give you this carrot cake muffin that is sooo good. it tastes more like a savory dessert than anything, but they gave us extra that we took home. yum!\n\nThe servers were nice and friendly. They always refilled our water and asked how our meal was going. An upscale casual place with glasses, tabelcloth settings, and waiters with white button-down shirts, but still casual enough to wear your jeans not feel too stuffy. On a nice sunny day it's nice to eat outside under the umbrella tables. All in all, a great restaurant with great food that hasn't let me down.", "author": "Jen Y."}

I got Murphy Eggs and Corned Beef Hash.\n\nUpon arrival of our dishes, I wished I had ordered what he got (merely basing this on how his dish looked...way heartier than mine).  My Murphy Eggs and Corned Beef Hash was nothing spectacular.  I didn't realize that Murphy Eggs are just eggs sunny side up on toasted rye.  The corned beef hash was of huge cubes of corned beef with potatoes, and heavy on the sauce.  His order was drenched in sauce.  When I tried his dish, all I could taste was the sauce.  There was just too much sauce on everything...even on my corned beef hash =(\n\nWe also got an order of corn muffins.  It was just two muffins topped w/ a lot of butter for $6, but they were the best corn muffins I've ever had in San Francisco.  They were moist and super tasty, with fresh whole kernels of corn...mmmm.  I'd totally go back there again, just to get the corn muffins.  \n\nMoreover, our waiter wasn't very good at refilling our glasses of water.  My date couldn't wait any longer for the water to come to us, so he went over to try to grab a pitcher himself.  He got scolded for doing so and was told to go back to his seat.

I ordered the meatloaf, my wife the roasted chicken and my daughter of course a pepperoni pizza. My meatloaf was very good and tasty as was the chicken, i am not a pizza fan and therefore did not try the pizza, but my daughter seemed to enjoy it. We ended with some coffee and the apple pie which was very good as well. Service was great and the fact that they had valet service out front to help with the always difficult task of finding parking in the city was a very big plus.

Sometimes their herb chicken is very good with it being juicy and fresh, but that's about it. Pesto mashed potatoes? Sour. Steak and meatloaf? Bland. Heirloom and mozzarella salad? Blah.\n\nIt was my father's birthday this past Tuesday and my sister and I made the mistake of coming here because our first choice restaurant was closed. We had the rudest, most negligent, and incompetent waiter. He did not come to our table for at least 10 minutes. When he finally showed, it was to tell us he would be back later. Might I mention that this was an extremely slow night with the restaurant almost 90% empty? \n\nWhen he took our orders, he was blatantly condescending and even attempted to correct the way my husband ordered wine--except that he \"corrected\" him with the wrong pronunciation. He also managed to step on my husband's foot for a good 5 seconds and didn't apologize. I had ordered a side of pesto mashed potatoes. It was untouched, but this idiotic asshole took it away from me without asking if I was finished with it or if I wanted it boxed. Before I could tell the dumbass I wanted it boxed, he threw a plate ONTO my side dish. \"I actually wanted that boxed.\" I told him. \"Okay.\" he replied, as he piled a 2nd plate onto the first. I must've given him a dirty look because only then did he take both plates off my then very squashed side dish.  We were initially planning on dessert, but I was so livid, the only thing I wanted to do was murder our waiter. At the end of the evening, the motherfucking asshole wordlessly placed the check in the middle of the table and left. My sister was nice enough to still tip that incompetent piece of shit. Because I was splitting with her, I ended up tipping by default.

It's warm and not too pretentious or noisey(very wide open with high ceilings & floors are accoustically carpeted).  It's not crazy-exciting or anything but aside from that, what's not to like as it is right across from one of the best ball parks in the country.  The food is very good  and the staff has been adequate if not great.  It's a bit pricey but when you think of the lo-cal, and those wonderfull scallop and fish dishes, it's really not so.  I've been a few times for lunch only and have never been dissapointed with the food.  I'd have to say Momo's is probably better for business lunches or just chillin' with the Mr. or Mrs. than for an exciting prelude to a wild party night unless it's a Giants game.

One of my friends ate no more than a quarter of his steak because it was too tough.\n\nThe service was also terrible.  The food preparation time seemed like it took over an hour.  At one point, the waitress brought us another table's order, which was evidence of how unorganized the restaurant was.\n\nFinally, the birthday girl happened to leave one of her birthday presents at the restaurant.  We were one of the last tables to leave that evening.  When she called first thing the following morning, the restaurant acknowledged that they had the bag, but the gift was missing.  Did someone at the restaurant take the gift?  I'll leave that for you to decide.  I personally think this wouldn't be an issue at any respectable restaurant.

(And not like a fungus...)\nThe bar area is still a little weird, with too many barstools at the uncomfortable bar and not enough comfortable/private areas.  HOWEVER, the restaurant area is beautiful, big, and comfortable.  It is PERFECT for large groups and even good for couples.  The food has drastically improved from last year.  The entrees are all very tasty, particularly the pork chop and filet mignon.  Our favorite appetizers include the brie/apple one and the butter lettuce salad.  This is also one of the few places in the city that makes oysters rockefeller, albeit with bacon, but you can pick it out.\nAlso noteworthy is the very decent wine list.  REALLY good wines at VERY reasonable prices!  We just had a bottle of the Parelle 45 for $32!  Not bad in a S.F. restaurant.  \nOverall, the restaurant is great with excellent, attentive service and tasty food, as long as it is in the off-season of baseball or on off-game days.

I kind of had a feeling it was going to be pricey, but I also figured that maybe the food and service would be at least decent. No such luck. On the plus side, we were seated immediately, and a bread basket with delicious levain bread was delivered soon after. However, once we ordered only appetizers and drinks, it seemed the service declined rapidly. First I asked if we might have some more bread- our waitress muttered something that sounded like an ok. Finally the food arrives (Julie and I splitting a grilled artichoke stuffed with bread crumbs, asiago, and drizzled with a lemon butter sauce with a hint of white wine, and Jen and Christian going for the traditional caesar salad) and I again asked if we could please have some more bread. Again, she grunted some form of yes. We proceed to finish our sub par snack (the salad had browning and rotten romaine leaves, and the artichoke was in no way near cooked- both dishes were way overpriced) and a bus boy comes to fill our water. I ask him if we could please get some bread. He doesn't seem to understand me. So, we basically gave up at that point- and decided to leave as soon as possible, not wanting to deal with the rude and inattentive staff.

The margaritas were soso, certainly not worth the 8 dollar price tag, and service was non-existent (the dirty glasses from the previous party on our table were never cleaned away).  I still give them 2 stars, just for the location: it's a great place to see all the pre-game action and people.", "author": "Marijke D."}

After looking on the web site I was very curious to meet Boom Boom the hostess, but much to my dismay we met with someone else who was probably just as helpful as BB would have been. Service was great but the Garlic Shrimp with Asiago Toast was brilliant! About a dozen shrimps lacquered with melted butter stole the show for me. In between that and the dessert was the hanger steak, which for some reason was offered at a lot of other places for DAT. The steak, rare and wet, was good, however, the bread that they placed it on top totally after getting soggy seeped into the tastes of the onions which just didn't whet my appetite. The onions basically tasted like wet bread, and I like onions even if they give you bad breath when you eat the un-grilled version. Anyway for dessert I tried everyone's the coffee ice cream sundae had hardened chocolate syrup on it, which is how I like it: chewy chocolate syrup. The banana bread pudding was amazing and I don't even like bread pudding. Man, just looking over the menu again brings fond memories back into my taste buds. So delicious. Momo's was a solid DAT find and would not hesitate to recommend it nor revisit. -Matt", "author": "Matthew C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-03-14", "description": "It is honestly too bad that Momo's only gets two stars.  It is a nice place, the decor and atmosphere are well done but the service is god awful.  I have eaten here several times and I have had bad experiences every time.  The first time I was there for lunch and the waiter completely f***ed our order, managing getting half the order there then there was a 20 minute wait until the rest of the food arrived.  The most recent occasion the waiter talked in almost a whisper and I could barely hear him speak.  Our food arrived about an HOUR after we ordered it and the restaurant was about 20% full.  Nothing we ordered (chicken and ravioli ) should take any longer than 30 minutes.  The food was good though, but the main courses  are fairly pricey and most of them come ala carte.  They get on the appetizers with most of them nearing $20.   Yeah $16 for ok calamari is ridiculous.   They need to lower the price on apps and I am sure their check average will increase.    Game days are a different story, the deck is fun with a good crowd.  The beers are decently priced for the location and its always a fun place after weekend game days.  But if you want to drop an easy $100 on dinner for two, then go somewhere else.", "author": "Eli Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-09-29", "description": "I'm writing this review not to critique the so-so food and the slow-slow service, but for the \"SERVICE FEE\" on my bill. \nNot that it cost $100 +++ for a light snack prior to taking in a game, but the \"SERVICE FEE\" that they add on to your bill.  Not the, you don't look like your going to tip \"fee\" that some restaurants secretly add to foreigners checks or to the parties of 8 or more \"tip included\" fee.  This added fee was a bit shocking to me...it was for the new 'sf health care law' that insist all restaurants provide health care to their employees, which I'm a big fan of.  I waited tables for years and had to pay my own.\nSo what MoMo's has done, is make the CUSTOMERS PAY for \"THEIR\" employees health insurance.  So now not only do I have to pay for mine, but if I want to go out and eat dinner at MoMo's, I have to pay for \"THEIR\" insurance as well???  Give me a break!  At least be sneaky about it.  Raise your food items another .50 cents to cover it.  I spoke to Lydia the manager, and she shrugged it off by saying \"oh well\".   Well...oh well is right...now others can read about it.", "author": "John M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-10-06", "description": "somehow this white-tablecloth restaurant, with a (generally) higher-end menu, exists on two ends of the spectrum. judging by the fleet of $50k+ vehicles parked outside, you'd assume they cater specifically to a certain type of demographic. but if it's a game day, this is where many of the \"quality\" bridge and tunnel individuals go to start their unadulterated consumption of alcohol before heading in to the stadium for $9 pints of watered-down beer. they congest the sidewalk, looking confused, arguing, yelling, and increasing nearby property values a few times a week during baseball season. if it happens to be in the three or so months which are not set aside for america's pasttime, this restaurant operates as a business-casual, reservations-recommended, valet-parking sort of dining experience. oddly enough, it sort of works for this place. you can join the mass of people who gather here weeknights for happy hour, (which so happens to be pretty nice on cool evenings when they put the portable heaters on the patio outside), have a fairly quiet nice meal tucked away at one of their tables on the floor, or have a nice workday lunch in the sun on the patio. they have an exposed kitchen which always seems nice to me as i like to see the goings-on of a restaurant anyway - except at tu lan, where i'd rather never see into the kitchen.", "author": "Jeremiah W."}
