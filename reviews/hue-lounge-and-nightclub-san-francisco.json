The DJ was awesome and played nothing but the best jams - the club reminded me of a scene from Vegas or Atlanta. They definitely have a great hip-hop vibe here which is hard to find in SF. As far as the service goes, we had a lady named Rebecca as our bottle girl/waitress. Sometimes in this environment it is hard to come across such great service as I've experienced bad attitudes or non-attentive service from bottle service waiters. They must be doing something right at Hue because Rebecca was on it! Anything I needed she was always checking in on our table. If you want a night dancing to hip-hop music and good vibes, come to Hue Lounge!", "author": "Shen D."}

We had pre purchased VIP dinner and show tickets ($85). The day of the event the Hue called to say they were canceling the dinner portion of our ticket. The offered to compensate us with three free drink and tickets to the second show (Hunkomania). Upon arrival Chris gave us each our drink tickets. \"These are your three drink tickets.\" Nothing else was said.\nWe order our drinks (vodka cran) and present our tickets. Bartender doesn't honor them. \"Tickets don't cover these drinks.\" We have a brief conversation saying we were told we were being compensated due to cancellation of dinner. He refused. We asked for a manager. She gave us an equally bad time too. So we said, \"fine. We'll have a beer instead.\" She still wants to charge us for the vodka drinks, saying \"we can't pour those back!\" We refuse. We say, \"We were told we were being compensated for the cancellation.\"\nShe reluctantly and in a very patronizing tone let's it go for \"this one time, but you better tip the bartender good.\"\nReally??? \nThen the show starts. Advertised as 5 Divas and a King. Well......it was NOTHING as advertised. Apparently the performers didn't show up, so we were sucked into watching understudies. The lip synching was terrible. \nOn to hunkomania. Oh lawd....they pretty much focused on one bride to be, and gave the other bride to be's, and birthday gals a walk by performance. \nSame day cancellation. Not honoring their promise of an \"equal\" compensation. Talking down and patronizing their customers.\nThis place was horrible.", "author": "Monica D."}

We came here on two separate occasions and both times someone from our group had their cell phone stolen either from their back pocket or their purse. First time there was 4 in our group and this last time one person. \n\nThere's a dress code and from the Yelp pictures it seems to be geared as a \"dress to impress\"  club, so NOT! I noticed many people in Vans, jean shorts and  t-shirts. I wonder if they lowered their standard to fill the club? \n\nOur double table VIP area was narrow but cute. It worked for us. The male runner made sure our drinks were full. \n\nThe ugly and scary: There was a shooting outside the club. Two passing vehicles and I believe someone was shot.  \n\nMy thoughts: they need to get new promoters that bring in a respectable crowd. After doing a google search of the shooting I come to realize this isn't something new. Apparently they have a reputation of fights and violent shootings. \n\nI will not be back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-07", "description": "About half of the complaints I see in other reviews are the things that I love. \n\n1. Lighting. Sorry I don't love pitch black clubs where I can't see, I think the lighting level is perfect.\n2. Talent. I saw Maya perform here and it was an awesome venue to watch her totally kill it. Recently went back and didn't like the headliner, but oh well! They get a variety in and I should have looked him up before deciding to go.\n3. Security. These guys are on it. First time I went some girl decided to punch another girl's boyfriend. Saw the whole thing from start to finish, first girl was being totally out of line and she and her friends rightfully got kicked out. Security was there as soon as the blow was struck so we knew they'd been watching the whole time. The other couple didn't get kicked out, which shows that they were paying attention and knew what was up. Most places would have kicked everyone out, but here they only tossed the aggressor.\n\nMet Adam, who I guess used to be GM when this was another club? He was visiting and stressed how hard everyone who works there had worked to make it a good safe place to go dance. And I definitely feel safe dancing here with my friends. Other clubs the security is less present and I'm not a fan of having my ass grabbed by drunk aggressive men when I'm just looking to dance, here that not a problem. And security would handle it if it did happen I'm sure. Mark is head of security and he's extremely nice and takes a lot of pride in his club and making sure everyone has a good time and gets home safely. As other reviewers have said, I've seen security here take care of people who have had just far too much to drink, including peeling them out of the street after they've blacked out. Totally professional, definitely a group of trustworthy people.\n\nDrinks selection is good. And I didn't find the place empty either time I've been. \n\nWould I go back? Yes. This place is my first pick.", "author": "Hilliary L."}

But NOPE, not this one. It was flashy that's for sure but fun.... I didn't have fun.\n\nI came for a friend's birthday and the line was long and moving very sloooooowly. It seemed like forever by the time we got to the door. \n\nPROS:\n-Free entry before 10:30pm. \n\n-Hue backdrop right when you walk in. Great for taking pictures with friends. \n\n-Bouncers are really nice. \n\nCONS:\n-No where to sit. For girls we wanna look good and wear heels, I love clubs with chairs because I need a break every now and then to rest my toes, those poor thing are crammed into the tiny tip of the heel. \n\n-Parking: None. That's always a pain when it comes to the city. \n\n-Music: They played top 40 and I was not enjoying it. Play hip hop, old school hip hop. The DJ should notice if nobody is dancing, it's probably time to whip out a good classic song. \n\nI will say this, my feet were killing me and there was a blocked off VIP room, I asked the bouncer if I could sit down and he was nice enough to let me. There was also a girl that drank a little too much, the bouncer and owners were so kind that they provided her water and a trash can. Usually other clubs kick out people that are throwing up.

We were on the guest list but I believe it's 20 dollars to get in. They have a lot of open space and great lighting effects in the club to display their brand. Drinks are decently priced from 6 -12 dollars a piece. The music is mostly rap and hip hop. \n\nThere was not a lot of people in this club especially when it got to 12am. The DJ was okay and wasn't great he only occasionally played good dance songs. I was also the only white guy in the place. So ladies if you're looking for white guys they are not here.

What my friends and I found annoying about this place is that here (and like every other club in SF) have a guestlist until 11pm but have a tendency to hold up the line even though the inside of the club was not that crowded at all. $20 for cover?? no thanks. We were able to talk to the lady in front about how disappointed we were and that the girls in my group traveled from San Jose to SF to celebrate a friend's birthday, so she was able to accommodate our request to discount our cover.\n\nDrinks didn't seem all that special but I wouldn't mind coming back again for another celebration of some sort, otherwise I don't plan to randomly come here on a Friday or weekend evening.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

Official looking men outside waiting to check IDs and keep things okay.\n\nGot to it a little later than 10:30. Rolling deep in a group of ten we were worried that would have to pay a hella expensive fee. BUT we lucked out. Got in for free.\n\nTalk about bright lights. Loud music. Entered the lower floor with a little lounge area in the corner, a big wall showing Hue for photo shoots, and a bar. \n\nUp the stairs, a big floor for dancing was available plus another bar. The bathrooms were in the back corner. \n\nInterestingly enough there was a nice woman in the bathroom. Just sitting there. She helped turn on the water, give soap, and hand out napkins. It reminded me of the Philippines. \n\nOne of the bathroom stalls had no more door. So if a friend was using it, one of us had to stand guard so no one would go inside and see things.\n\nThe alcohol area was tended to by three young and pretty ladies, and some handsome gentleman. There were other ladies dressed in fish net stockings and body suits, scantily clad, sexy and brought refills on drinks, so forth.\n\nMusic was popping. Like so freaking good. Okay, a few songs were off and others cut off before the good parts were heard. Overall, it was popping and the beat kept making everyone dance.\n\nThe crowd was a bit smaller than expected. There was a bunch of guys standing near the walls or dancing with themselves, and coming upon ladies hella badly.

It was really hard to pick one place to party at.... because there are soooo many choices in the bay area. We ended up deciding on this place and I am so happy we did!

We especially liked that she kept checking on us throughout the night to make sure we were okay. I've done bottle service at other clubs and after they bring out your liquor they don't bother with you again.

They have a small bar as soon as you walk in and then there's a pretty spacious dance floor, only most people weren't dancing when we arrived. \n\nThe music was pretty on point for most of the night. DJ mostly played top 40/hip hop. There was a small crowd, smaller than most nightclubs in the city. (The crowd is really mixed and diverse, which was a nice change.) Most people weren't really dancing but rather getting drinks and lounging around I guess. \n\nI wouldn't say this is a great place to club, they have to pull in a larger crowd and I think people would feel more comfortable in getting down on the dance floor.

She also left an unopened champagne bottle for us to again serve ourselves for the money we were paying her. We had to go FIND someone to get mixers in carafes. Our used glasses piled on the table until we personally took them to the bar ourselves. At this point I should have been tipped out too. Our ice was NEVER replenished and was the same ice our bottle sat in. Just terribly GROSS. We had to go chase another girl down to order another bottle since it was NYE and there was no turning back now with our party of people. Again sitting in our melted ice bucket that we had to serve ice from. It was honestly as though they didn't want to make money at all.

You have to check the calendar with what is going on to make sure it fits your music preference.  Renting the venue for private events is also recommended.", "author": "Karen K."}

It was packed though and the decor is beautiful. I will definitely go here again!!", "author": "Jamie J."}

My friends and I had a great time and our vip lounge had a great view of the pyramid. Music and the staff was thumbs-up!  If you want to have a Vegas like celebration this is the spot to have it.", "author": "Annabelle R."}

First of all, they stamp you but you can't leave...according to the security it is due to liability issues. Fine. Then at 10:30pm I ordered mojito  and I was told they ran out of mint! At 10:30...really?  Then I ordered a Margarita and it was not all that fantastic.  Big place but that's about it.", "author": "Hazel B."}

This was the worst customer service situation you could imagine. If I'm paying a $20 cover this place place better be popping. It wasn't, first room was almost sad with the amount of people. Second room had a fair amount of people but the atmosphere lacked. Don't go here overpriced and underwhelming.", "author": "K A."}

This place is straight up gorgeous- from the Miami-style decor, to the lights, to the dope LED walls. Sound system is bangin'. Tables towards the back have sweeeet city views of the Pyramid- those booths looked to be in high demand for the bottle service crowd. Bartenders are fast and friendly, and drinks are actually fairly cheap for an SF nightclub. I like that they serve drinks in mock glassware and not those cheap disposable cups- gives me something to hold on to on the dance floor. Plus they serve coconut water! Everyone was getting down on the dance floor and just seemed to be out to have a good time- no stupid club drama or posing here. Apparently they just opened- I'm interested to see what kind of talent they will be bringing in here, gonna be popping for sure.", "author": "Jonathan M."}

Worst vibe and staff I have ever seen.     Would never go back.  Which is a bummer because I love the look and design of the club.     but the staff is such a turn off!!!    Don't waste your time.", "author": "Michael D."}
