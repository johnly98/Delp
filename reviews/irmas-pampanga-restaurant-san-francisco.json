The entire space is split by a 3 by 10 foot serving space, one of those glass-hot water-tray contraptions, which you will swear was heaven on earth. \n\nA big burly white guy who hasn't shaved in 15 minutes will quickly usher out the crackies looking for a free lumpia with his less-than-jedi mind trick yelling.

It's very rare when  I don't finish my Filipino food  - it was a sad time.  I really wanted Irma to work out for me since I work a few blocks away-  alas - no go-to Filipino food for me  around the way. \n\nSide-note: while I was ordering - the server accidentally dropped some receipts into the food (adobo) she didn't even blink nor think twice about it- grabbed it with her bare hands and set that sucker on the counter- and went right back to business as if.

I live, breathe and LOVE the cuisine.\n\nThat said, Irma's is one of the few places in San Francisco that proudly wears that seal of authenticity. This is what most restaurants in the Philippines feel like. And No, I'm not talking about the zillions of new restaurants popping up everywhere in the main city of Metro Manila. I'm referring to the dying breed of family owned mom and pops establishments you will find along roadsides on the way to the provinces and country sides. The ones that stay true to Filipino cuisine.\n\nYes. Irma's is as close to home as it gets.\n\nIf you want the authentic Filipino \"carinderia\" experience, check Irma's out. The caveat is that authentic Filipino means greasy and MSG-filled food. If you don't mind that, by all means come here with and open mind and an empty stomach. \n\nIf you are not familiar with the process, it's \"turo-turo\" which is similar to the food court or Panda Express. You grab a tray, tell the guy behind the counter what items you want, and he ladles it onto small bowls along with a mountain of white rice. Most of the dishes are usually saucy so pouring it on the rice is advised. \n\nThe food is good, albeit greasy and salty. But that's the way I like it. If you're not a fan of greasy food, this place might not be for you. This is as close to the flavors of the Philippines as you will get. Go in with this mindset if you are open to new things and you will be fine.\n\nI have met Irma before. She didn't pay much attention to me when I was there. In fact, she was a bit standoffish.

Nervousness.\n\nThose were just a few of the emotions running through me as I walked up to the entrance of Irma's.  You see, I have a Filipino boyfriend.  A PICKY Filipino boyfriend.  He lived in the Philippines and always craves a good, authentic Filipino meal.  So when I was giving him a tour of the Mission and he turned to me and asked, \"Are there any good Filipino joints up in this place?\" I was at a loss.  \n\nI mean, I'm as white as it gets.  When it comes to the Mission, I know Philz, Beretta, Mission Cheese, and any burrito place (see my other reviews regarding my burrito obsession) like the back of my hand... But Filipino?  Can't say I'd gone out of my way to ever find one.  So what does a hopeless white girl do?  Open the Yelp application on her iPhone!\n\nWhich, of course, led me to this place!  I was so petrified he was going to hate it... But his scowl turned into a smile when he walked in and saw all of the delicious foods set out \"turo turo\" style.  (Turo-turo literally translates to \"point-point,\" meaning all of the foods are set out in front of you, and you point at what looks good and hope for the best.)  We ordered quite a few things, including pork lumpia, lechon kawali (fried pork), fried milkfish, and BBQ pork.  Everything cost a total of $12 (yay cheap eats!), was absolutely delicious, and  wasn't overly greasy or garlic-y like other Filipino places he had taken me to before.  In fact, the lumpia was so delicious that if I hadn't just woofed down an entire burrito from El Farolito (once again, I have a burrito problem), I probably could have eaten the entire order of lumpia on my own.\n\nOverall: this place isn't fancy, but the food definitely holds its own, and it gets a seal of approval from both me and my picky Filipino SO!  Go check it out, eat some pork, and enjoy some people watching in this little restaurant on the corner of Van Ness!", "author": "Christy L."}

It doesn't look like much on the inside either. The place is well-lit, the tables are clean, and the television is playing at a respectable volume. The staff is warm and friendly and all-smiles. The food is displayed behind a glass panel, turo-turo style. They didn't label the dishes, but if you grew up with this food, it shouldn't be a problem. You'll be able to identify at least half of it.\n\nAn order of white rice gets you a mountain of the stuff on a large plate. Huge. It could have easily fed three people. But that's how they do it back home -- the land that put \"Extra Rice\" on the menu, so I got a sentimental kick out of that. \n\nThe bistek was juicy and tender, and the sauce was great for pouring over your rice. The sisig had the right amount of heat, although I don't think they used the pig cheek and ears, which is what is traditionally used in this dish. I didn't like the tortang talong because it didn't have the ground meat that I was used to. \n\nIt's hard to judge the food at Irma's with the same scale that I use to judge other cuisines, simply because Filipino food always gives me something extra. It gives me comfort and serves up a host of memories that no other cuisine can give me. I was craving a taste of home and Irma's gave me just that.", "author": "Racquel N."}

This review is mainly on their lumpias because that is what I mostly order. The lumpias are out of this world and my family, coworkers, church members, and classmates adore Irma's lumpias. They are the best and even if I have to drive into the city just to pick up a pan of lumpias, I most certainly will. Their lumpias are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, incredibly tasty. I don't think there are any veggies in the lumpia which I love (don't judge me). They always accommodate my needs even if I call in last minute.\n\nAnother favorite I usually get here is the BBQ Chicken over Garlic Rice.

I've been here a few times and every time I com here, the cashier, perhaps the owner, and sometimes different employees in the front are always yelling, perhaps even lecturing the employee. And their conversation don't sound pleasing and sometimes I can tell they're arguing. No professionalism at all. I'm sure they have lost a lot of customers or didn't retain first timers due to the yelling and unprofessional attitudes displayed to customers. Also, the cashier/owner was cutting her fingernails behind the counter where the food was laid out. Really? Any common sense here???\n\nAdvice: Wait till there's no customer in the restaurant before arguing or yelling at each other. And if your employees are far to where they cannot hear you, walk over and talk to them. No customer wants to hear your non-English conversations, especially when it's yelled out! Also, doesn't every employee have to go through basic food and beverage handling course to get a permit to work at a restaurant? \n\nIf it's not the convenience of the location and the good food, I will totally ditch this place.

They didn't jack up prices.  Yes, you can charge what you want, but to not list prices...everyone assumed it would be affordable.\n\nPlus, as I was waiting in line, one guy who ordered the \"special plate\" reached down to grab a drink.  This big guy with dreadlocks who worked with them asked him if he paid.  He said he got the special (and I assume he figured at that price, it MUST include a drink).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-16", "description": "I have been meaning to come here for a while now, but the first time I walked in, it was sometime between lunch and dinner, around 5pm, so the food wasn't as appetizing then, and there wasn't much of it out. I opted to give it a second chance after helping a friend move just around the corner, and boy was it a great idea.\n\nThere were six of us and we ordered three combos and a side of pancit bihon. The adobo was delicious! The chicken tasted like it had been pan fried before putting it into the sauce (which is the right way to do it), instead of just cooked in the sauce like at most places. Solid chicken adobo with good sauce! Bonus points because the woman behind the counter gave us extra sauce, which won Josh K.'s heart over (he's definitely a sauce kind of guy). \n\nThe sisig was also really good. We had to get two orders because so many of us were interested in it, and it was definitely a good decision. It's very crispy and a bit sour, and served with onions and bell peppers (gotta get your greens somehow!). I normally don't like when sisig has too sour of a flavor, but this was perfect. I could eat this stuff all day.\n\nThe pancit bihon was decent, but not super amazing. If you need a noodle fix, get it, if not, just eat everything with rice. Their rice is moist and sticky and is perfect for pouring sauce over.\n\nThe lumpiang shanghai was good, but there were a few structural integrity problems. It's harder to roll and fry lumpia without making gashes in the side, so I won't take off points for this. The flavor was there though. \n\nChicken barbecue! This was another one we had to get two orders of. Perfect sauce, and generally just delicious. The chicken was not mostly burnt (which I commonly see) and it had just the perfect crisp caramelized sauce. Really a winner.\n\nThe service was great, and we felt very at ease. This place doesn't get any points for ambiance, but it's delicious and that's what matters. The people running the place were very friendly and hospitable, and I felt at home. \n\nDefinitely bonus points for playing TFC and having Sarsi and Calamansi Juice in a can.

And when we come to San Francisco, we eat lots of Filipino food, because we can't get it back home in St. Louis.  And he is really a gourmet Filipino chef.  So, I'm spoiled when it comes to Pinoy cuisine.\n\nThis place is hands down our favorite place for Filipino food in all of San Francisco. Yes,it's not a beautiful place, but the food, oh, the food.  First, there are certain foods in every culture that can tell you about the quality of a place.  For me, it's the lumpia (Shanghai) (I absolutely hate the vegetable one).  And Irma's has THE best lumpia I have ever had (with the notable exception of my husband's lumpia).  Crispy wrapper, moist and exquisite meat filling inside.  You have to have this!  We even got a tray full of this for our wedding reception and there was not one piece leftover.  Very special.\n\nThe other day, when we walked in, I immediately smelled the aroma of ukoy.  And they have tremendous ukoy.  They use a lot of annatto, so it's beautifully orange. :-)  But it's crispy and so very delicious.  Ukoy can be very bad (either too soggy or too hard), this is just right.\n\nAnd every one of their dishes is so very delicious (dinaguan, bistek, adobo, caldereta, gulai, torta, sisig, turon, various silogs) (sorry about the spelling).\n\nWe have gone there so many times and everyone was exceptional.

I really like their food, and they have lots of combinations that I enjoy.  They whip out stuff that I rarely EVER get to eat, like okoy and lechon.  There are quite a few things on the menu that I haven't eaten for a few decades and quite happy to do so here.\n\nThe one I tend to order from (is it Irma herself??) always gives me incredibly generous portions.  She tens to call me \"darrrling\" or \"swit hart\" and only a few people can get away with that...\n\nEvery now and then, I think I confuse her with my order...because I order family-sized meals for one person, and if confronted with a choice, I will take all the choices offered.  lol.  I'm sure that's not the only way I've confused her.  lol.\n\nI am a fan of their Turon (fried bananas)...and at an affordable price!  I've always gotten three or  more.  Sadly, they do not travel well.  They are wrapped in egg-roll wrappers, and friend, and carmelized to boot...so they are crunchy and glazed on the outside, and lovely on the inside.\n\nTheir lumpia shanghai isn't bad either...but I need to remember to eat everything within the same day, lest they lose crispiness.\n\nTheir palabok is not a far cry from one of my aunties...and will definitely do in a pinch (I just wish I had chicarron in a different container to add on, and unfortunately, kalamansi doesn't grow here...)\n\nThe barbecued everything is life-changing for many folks and has come to raise the bar for many.  Rarely have I ever been able to bring some home as take-out, because I finish it (illegally) in BART.\n\nI like their condiments.  They even have datu puti suka with chilis and garlic!

They are sort of like \"two-bite-size\" tasty meat-filled deep-fried spring rolls Filipino style. I often order a tray of 100 pieces of Lumpia Shanghai from Irma's for different parties. A tray costs only $20. What a bargain and it feeds a village! \n\nI also had their two types of Pancits served with shrimp and pork with some chopped vegetables, eggs and some lemons for extra flavor (I don't know the exact dish names but one uses thinner noodles, and the other has thicker noodles). They are both delicious. They do have vegetarian pancit for the non-meat eaters.\n\nIf you like meat, then try their Chicken Adobo and Pork Adobo with garlic rice...and they aren't stingy on the garlic at all...a plus in my book. And their Curry Chicken is pretty good too.\n\nThe only downside of Irma's is that sometimes they close shop earlier than what their sign stated...unannounced, so try NOT to get there after 6:30pm/7pm...even though I think the sign says they close at 8pm.", "author": "Jen L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-07-05", "description": "Okay folks, lezget real, shall we?  This is NOT the place for the uninitiated Euro/American palate to experiment with the exotic complexities of Filipino/Pilipino/Pinoy/Philippine cuisine (again for the uninitiated, any one of those proper noun adjectives describes the nationality).  I think my fellow Pinoys will agree with me when I suggest that the best place to test your toe in the waters of Filipino food is someone's mama's kitchen, where you're sure to be introduced to the more popular, western-palatable dishes such as lumpia (our version of the ubiquitous Asian fried vegie/meat roll), pancit (stir fried vegies/meat with noodles), and adobo (either chicken or pork marinated in soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves whole black pepper then simmered into an aromatic stew).  You probably experienced these at an office pot luck already.  If that's all you know, stick to it when you go to Irma's.  But beware:  like all turo turo joints (point at this chafing dish, that chafing dish, and order) it's best to get the stuff when it's right out of the kitchen... usually before 11 am.  Otherwise, you will be disappointed by food that's been hanging out for at least a couple of hours:  the lumpia is limp, the pancit is barely warm and is greasy, and the adobo could be dried out.  If my non-Pilipino brethren want to try the other dishes, go with someone who can explain to you EXACTLY what is in them and what makes their flavors unique.  Otherwise, y'all just do a disservice to the cuisine to try something and react with solely \"Ew! That was weird...\".  Oh also... there is no atmosphere at Irma's (gawd... what I could do in there with an interior design budget)  ...so don't expect any.  Be ready for a cafeteria a couple steps above being a dive.  Irma's is working class and pretends nothing else nor tries to.\n\nOkay... my FilAm peeps.  Like I said, get there early if you want good home-cooked like your mama or lola made.  For real though, when I get a craving for some down and dirty Flip soul food (helps with the hangovers, doncha know), I make it to Irma's early and grab some dinuguan (pig's blood stew with chitterlings), kare-kare (oxtail, eggplant, long beans in a peanut flavored stew), pinacbet (pork with bitter melon, cassava, and long bean), fried bangus (milk fish), sinangag (garlic fried rice), and grab a six-pack of Modelo Especial from the grocery store next door.  \n\nRemember:  Get there early!  I hate our food when it's not fresh or hot.  I even reheat it on the stove (not the micro) when I get home so it tastes like it just came out of the kitchen.  And, I buy their lumpia unfried (frozen) so I can fry it myself and have fresh crispy lumpia just the way I like it.  Only problem is, they charge you the same for the same amount of lumpia frozen or fried.  Seems rather over frugal... but then you know how we be.", "author": "Ric S."}
