I find that the fried battered dishes are generally a miss for me. Anything fried is heavily, heavily breaded, and the batter is much too thick to be enjoyable (i.e. honey walnut prawns - which at $14 is not cheap at all of a dish). However, if you order something stir fried, Spicy Garden does a pretty good job. The menu can be a bit overwhelming because there are so many items, but a favorite of mine is the scallion lamb - very tender, few tendon in the pieces, and very flavorful. \n\nBe careful around the area of Mission and 6th though! This has been widely regarded as the most dangerous street corner in San Francisco so if you can help it, avoid walking up to Market on 6th after you've received your take out order.\n\nAlso, Spicy Garden does offer free delivery over a certain minimum, so take advantage of that while it lasts!", "author": "Austin W."}

As well, I'd venture to say the food quality is below that of the places in the Metreon cafeteria.  \n\nWhen I went, I ordered dan dan noodles, twice cooked pork, eggplant with garlic sauce, and string beans.  Nothing tasted as it should.  The noodles were not spicy and peppery with the numbing sensation and tasted overly like peanuts.  The twice cooked pork was overcooked and covered in those small black beans, pretty much always a bad sign.  The eggplant in garlic sauce was too sweet and tasted suspiciously like ketchup.

While it certainly wasn't too dry, more moisture would have been appreciated. This was a little bit jerky-like in some parts. Good cumin flavor (especially if it's coming through while my sinuses are clogged!). 3.45/5. \n\nThe pickled mustard noodle soup (yeah I didn't know it came with noodles either-- the thick glass kind) was perfect for someone sick. The fish was a bit mushy on the outside, but I think that's sort of expected when you freeze and unfreeze fish (sole, I think). Definitely felt like home cooking, if my mom was from Szechuan haha. I with the fish / tofu to noodle ratio were a bit better though. It felt really healthy / not oily so that's a definite plus, especially given all the super oily Chinese food around these parts. 3.45/5.\n\nWhile I didn't love the place, I'd definitely be back for more items on a day I'm craving home cooked sort of foods!", "author": "Nicole H."}

We got a Shredded Spicy Pork with Garlic and it came with a side of hot and sour soup. They got the food out to us rather quickly, which is a plus, and the food as a whole was relatively flavorful.\n\nThe drawback is that you're mostly just eating a giant pile of rice, and while the food items were flavorful, they weren't exactly the best quality. The pork was mostly just bamboo shoots and other vegetables, and all of the taste came from the sauce. So in essence I was eating rice with \"sauce\" as that was the only thing you could really taste from the whole meal.\n\nWhile I would be fine eating here again, I just don't find the food itself to be particularly all that good (although it is filling).

It was located just a block from the apartment that I was living in; it was cheap; and delivery was fast! Most days, though, I just stopped by after work and ordered two orders of mapotofu.\n\nThe tofu itself comes in a huge plastic container, with rice in takeout boxes. Most mapotofu dishes (in both American chain restaurants and Chinese restaurants) are made incorrectly; there is a specific Sichuan peppercorn that needs to be used to create the correct balance of spicy yet satisfying. The sauce should not feel meaty or thick like stock; it should be smooth and silky. The tofu should be soft. And when blended with rice, it should not clump together.\n\nSpicy Garden's mapotofu met all the criteria. The best part? It's CHEAP. A huge container of mapotofu was only $7.95 and could last me for 3 meals.\n\nMost of their other dishes are too oily or salty, though, so 1 star off for that. I never get anything but the mapotofu so it doesn't bother me haha. The decor and interior is absolutely horrible too. White walls, white tile, uncomfortable tables.

But here's what I got.\nPork Belly with Garlic and Spice: 0/5. I had expected those lovely tender chunks of pork belly glazed with garlic and spice. YUM. What I got was a soup that was mildly spicy at best with cold, unappetizing thin and chewy pieces. None of the sauce was picked up either - it was very bland.\nKung Pao: 2/5. Whoever wrote this would be so spicy they sweated does not ever do sichuan or Indian. I specifically asked for spicy (two times - once in writing and once by checking \"spicy\") in the request for delivery. It was bland. \nString Beans: 3/5 - Probably the best of the dishes.

It came with rice and soup.  Ordered their Sichuan fish stew, one of my favorite Sichuan dishes.  Delicious!  It's oily but it's how it's supposed to be.  Will definitely come back and try other stuff!", "author": "Lori C."}

We recently moved to San Francisco and have been really disappointed with the dated, Americanised chinese food most places serve here. This place is different and delicious! The szechuan food is great - best ma po tofu in SF and their assorted mushrooms in hot and numbing spicy pot is great. Also recommend their shredded potato with hot chili pepper. The restaurant is basic, but the food and the value are great.", "author": "Ari W."}
