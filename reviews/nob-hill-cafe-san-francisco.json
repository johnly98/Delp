It was a short walk from our hotel on top of Nob Hill. They have some fresh baked breads on the table for a starter and the thick focaccia style bread was sooooooo  good! It was light, herby, and fluffy in the middle and had a crunchy and slightly salty crust....\n\n   The pizza was a style I like but haven't found many places that do it right. It's thin crust but a soggy thin crust you have to eat with a fork. Soggy and pizza are not usually a good thing but when it's done right it can be amazing. In Italy they don't slice pizza's but rather serve them on a plate to eat with a fork. That's what this reminded me of. \n\n   We got the Italian sausage pizza off the menu and added some anchovies. The crust was nice and chewy-gooey swimming in a simple tomato sauce and covered with just the right amount of cheese. The toppings were plentiful and added substance and texture to the soft crust. The anchovies took it to the next level with an awesome salty goodness that you can only get from that topping. All in all it was awesome, I wanted to order a second pie but splitting one plus the extra bread was plenty of food for my wife and I.\n\n    Next time I'm in this area I'm going to come back for a repeat of perfection,  give'em a try!", "author": "Mark F."}

She gave us frequent updates on the status of a table and then suggested we split into two groups so we could get seated faster. While this certainly isn't ideal for a group dinner, we really appreciated her being so attentive to us and ultimately decided to split up since we were starving!\n\nMy table shared the penne with vodka sauce, linguine with clams and the gnocchi with ragu. I thought the gnocchi was exceptional. They were light and airy and the sauce was so rich and flavorful. Definitely the standout. I also really enjoyed the vodka sauce, although it had a little more heat than I was expecting. The linguine itself was delicious and cooked perfectly, but I thought the sauce left something to be desired. Maybe some parsley or lemon, but it just fell a little flat. \n\nI'm looking forward to coming back to Nob Hill Cafe and exploring more of the menu. It's cute and quaint and they definitely know how to make a good bowl of pasta.", "author": "Sophie S."}

This whole time I though this was a normal cafe where you buy sandwiches for lunch and sit there with your laptop to get worked done..... WRONG! It is actually the complete opposite.\n\nMe and my boyfriend came here for a cute intimate Italian dinner date. We had read all the reviews on Yelp and played with he menu hours before. It is definitely true that their is a wait time outside in the cold, but at least they let you order drinks while you wait and there are a few tables outside too. There are two sections of the restaurant that have two different vibes. One is more bright and has a bit more of a casual feel. The other room has dimmed lights, candles everywhere, and feels more date-like.\n\nEverything on the menu sounded great. I had a hard time choosing, but an amazing honest waitress that gave us the rundown on everything!\n\nWr started off with bread and had continued to drink our bottle of wine that we began drinking during our wait. The bread was okay! We also ordered the carpaccio as our \"antipasti\" and it was so yummy. It was my first time trying it, and I was very impressed.\nAfter hearing our waitress's opinion I decided to order the gnocchi bolognese. She told me the recipe for the gnocchi was a homemade restaurant recipe so that it would be unique to my dinner experience versus getting something that is good, but can also be found to be good somewhere else. I was sold, and absolutely in love with the dish. The gnocchi texture was perfect and so good. The pasta sauce was rick, and the sausage/beef was an amazing mix.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered something off of their special menu for the night. He ordered the seafood linguini that was mixed with calamari, muscles, shrimp, and a spicy tomato sauce. It was bomb! (Yes, I tried his dish because it looked way too good to not try it) The linguini was perfectly cooked, the sauce had a perfect spice too it. I don't eat spicy and could definitely handle the kick.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered their special menu snickerdoodle cheesecake, and a kahlua gelato on top of cheesecake and a heath bar on top.

My very first visit happened by chance. Years ago, before becoming a SF resident, my dining companions and myself wanted to have dinner & decided to \"wing it.\" The place we intended to go had an incongruous wait time, so we trudged a few blocks over & stumbled upon Nob Hill Cafe, sat in the dining room to the right, in the cozy window booth. \n\nIt's a small family-owned restaurant with a warm & homey feel, clad with a tasteful amount of white lights adorning the exterior, to twinkle at you while you sit & sip your Chardonnay while you wait on a busy night. There are two dining rooms- one (where the main entrance is) is all tables and shares the room with an open kitchen. The other dining room houses the bar and a couple window booths. I've dined on both sides & have found it to be pleasant, admittedly, I have a partiality for a quaint window seat booth. \n\nRecommendations: \nIf you are a fan of garlic-pink-sauce-perfection, I highly recommend the PENNE BETTOLA, my absolute favorite dish here. It's served piping hot, throw some Parmesan and pepper on that bad boy and enjoy! The Tortellini Romana with Pesto sauce is also a good choice (the Pesto sauce is delish!). You can also request a side for your bread. Pizza is Tuscan style & nice if you're in the mood for that. They have daily specials written on the chalk board that have always proven to be worth checking out. \n\nAs for dessert, but of course, there is the house made Tiramisu. If you are Tiramisu'd out, I really recommend the Gelato desserts (Gelato served as a slice of pie, essentially). The Strawberry White Chocolate & Spumoni  will hit the spot!  \n\nIronically, now I live in the neighborhood and one of the Perks (for my tastebuds, if nothing else) is having this lovely restaurant 3 blocks away. Prices are very reasonable and service is lovely. They get very busy for dinner, so if you are under time constraints, just know that there will be a wait. If you're an introvert seeking delectable pasta, try coming during lunch- it's much more mellow, no wait, and you may just score that cozy window seat. \n\nMangia Bene!", "author": "Amanda A."}

We had an awesome little table looking out the front window and we so enjoyed people (and dog) watching as we gabbed. And then the food came...the food...THE FOOD! OH SO GOOD! My friend had a pizza and I had fettuccini pesto. Scrumptious! It was absolutely delicious and they were both pleasing to the eye as well as the palette! The service was also good! We were seated immediately and our server was fantastic! Not a single complaint about this place. Wonderful experience from beginning to end!", "author": "Nancy M."}

I was torn between the Carbonara and the Tortellini with pesto but my server suggested the Tortellini so I went with that.  I think the Tortellini needed a tad bit of salt and the pasta was just a tiny bit undercooked.

Wait time was about an hour so we put our names on the list and returned. \nTo be honest, I don't know why you wouldn't take reservations. It seems insane and old fashioned to me. We were a party of four, and many parties of three were seated before us. \nAll of that being said, it smelt delicious and the food didn't disappoint. The free bread (and butter) basket was great - particularly the tomato focaccia. \nPersonally I ordered the pea soup (special), the linguine alla vongole and triple chocolate cheesecake (also a special). It was all really good - the linguine perhaps a little bitter - but the cheesecake was the standout. \nOthers in my party ordered the beef carpaccio and caprese appetisers (both great) and the carbonara, a pizza and the penne bettola with chicken. I think if I were to return (I probably wouldn't, due to the wait) I'd opt for the gnocchi bolognese, pesto tortelloni or a pizza. The mains don't come with any veg so I think I'd order a side salad also.", "author": "Poppy C."}

Service was terrific and the waitress was very courteous. I came here primarily for their carbonara so this is what the review will primarily be about.\n\nSpagetti Carbonara - Delicious. Good portion size with the right amount of italian bacon and spaghetti. The only criticism I have is that they had an unequal proportion of sauce to spaghetti resulting in too much sauce that may have been overpowering. Something they can definitely work on. Overall, I would rank this my 3rd best carbonara place I've ever hand, best being Italy (of course) and 2nd being a small joint in Seattle, WA.\n\nMargarita Pizza - DO NOT GET THIS. My fianc\u00e9 got this and the pizza was very plain and my only guess is that it wasn't made with much pizza sauce so it came out very dry and essentially tasted like bread.\n\nMy recommendations, stick to what they know, get their pastas and stay away from their pizzas. 5 stars for carbonara, 2 stars i would say for their pizza. Still would go back for their carbonara though!", "author": "Alan C."}

But we did a few Sundays ago for brunch. We opted to be seated outside since it was pleasant out and it was probably best in the event our infant daughter decides to shriek, cry, wail, yell etc etc. \n\nThey offer the traditional brunch fare including their usual pasta dishes. I opted for the latter while the hubs opted brunch. Food overall was nothing out of the ordinary however if you're hungry, it's certainly above \"good enough\" for me, at least. I kept wondering what the Italian family a couple tables down thought about Americanized Italian food they ordered. They must have thought it was just fine as they all seemed to have liked it and finished it. It's always so interesting to me to see how tourists and visitors to the States view our take on certain cuisines and portions. \n\nI'm glad to have checked off another establishment that I've had bookmarked for what seems like forever. The most exciting culinary adventures might not be had here however come without the expectation and you should be fine.", "author": "Esther A."}

I want to feel like someone's grandma is working in the back, and I want to taste the handmade love. The reality is mine tasted 100% like it was from the frozen section from Costco. Maybe that is why the staff treats the customers with contempt, because they probability don't understand why people want to eat the awful food either.\n\nMy advice. Go home. Light some candles.

Relatively small restaurant with an open kitchen and a line outside the door at 630 on a Friday... I knew this would be special.\n\nAs my friend and I had a 60 minute wait (quoted 30 minutes, just be cautious) we explored the menu and decided to split one of the special pizzas, the Hawaiian with prosciutto and gruyere/fontina, and the Penne with spicy tomato cream sauce (subbed fettuccine which was a good choice). Prices were incredibly  reasonable at pizza for $17 and pasta was $16-17. Bread basket came out with a few varieties including a warm focaccia. We couldn't get enough of it.\n\nThe pizza was the best I've EVER had, including that in Rome. The crust was light, airy and held up the heavy toppings of pineapple and layers of prosciutto! The prosciutto was quality and perfectly salty with Just the right amount of sweetness from the pineapple. Douse it with fontina and gruyere and good to the edge. \n\nThe pasta was fresh and the sauce had just enough zip to not overwhelm the depth of flavor in the sauce. Huge bowl and we still licked it clean and killed the pie.\n\nGood date place, good family restaurant (behaved kids who love pizza and pasta) and intimate for conversation. \n\nThey don't take reservations though, so plan ahead or plan to enjoy some drinks outside !", "author": "Hillary G."}

I really like this place and have eaten there on several occasions when meeting friends in SF.  There is almost always a 15-20 wait for a table as they do not take reservations.  On this particular visit, there was a 30 minute wait for a table and the customary offer of a complimentary glass of house wine while you wait has either ceased or was missed.  We stayed in the immediate area with a group of people who were also waiting.  We waited while one name after another was called.  After hearing a name called that I was positive arrived after we did, I went back inside to find the hostess to ask how much longer the wait would be since it was now over an hour since she had placed our name on the list.  The hostess looked at the list and said \"I already called your name.\"  I was dumbfounded.  \"No, you didn't we have been waiting the entire time.\"  She insisted that she had and that we had not responded.  I let her know that we had not gone anywhere and had been waiting the entire time and that she did not call our name.  She agreed to seat us next.  She then comes out about five minutes later and now looking right at me calls another name.  No one comes forward.  She looks at me again and I respond with the correct name so now we have an idea of what went wrong.  She insists she did not make that mistake earlier.\n\nSuggestion - get a better system for tracking customers waiting.  A good hostess would have noticed we were still out there as the crowd was \ndwindling and confirmed where we were on the list.\n\nReal problem - you made a mistake, it happens but own up to it, apologize and do what you can to make it right.  It's not the mistake that will keep me from returning, it's the attitude and complete lack of customer service experienced after the mistake had been made.", "author": "Amy P."}

The cozy ambiance is almost comparable to a cute dining room in northern Italy.\n\nMy only issue with this restaurant is that we waited 45 minutes to be seated (as most places in San Francisco) and when we finished our meals, were asked to leave while we were still drinking our wine! As we had only been seated at a table for an hour and fifteen minutes, the wait time should have out weighed the amount of time we were sitting there. \n\nI understand they are doing their best to get as many people in and out throughout the evening, but the customer service has to improve overall. If they could alert people prior to being seated about each time slot and high volume of customers, I would be more empathetic- I hope that this system improves in the future.", "author": "Kelly B."}

We waited about 20 minutes because we had a party of five. It's a small place. We were seated next to the door (which was great because we got some sun), but our fifth person sat next to the door and was constantly having to close the door when people walked in. \n\nFood: \nWe ordered from the brunch menu. I ordered the French Toast (with a side of potatoes and a cup of coffee. I also tried some of their prawn and avocado omelette (comes with a side of potatoes and cornbread). The French Toast was mediocre at best. There was no powdered sugar and it did not live up to my expectations. The omelette tasted great and I wish I ordered that. The potatoes tasted slightly bland. I really enjoyed the coffee. If I come again, I would go for an omelette (many choices) or try something on the lunch menu. \n\nService: \nService was the best thing about this place. Most places aren't open for brunch on New Years' Day so this was in a great location (we celebrated and stayed near Union Square). The wait was significantly shorter than we expected. The waitress was amazing. She greeted us warmly at the door and invited us in. She got us excited about the food and checked up on us without feeling overbearing. She made the experience.\n\nOther Notes:\n1. None of us ordered the lunch dishes, but the aroma of Italian food made us really hungry.\n2. Our party of five was a bit big. Four people max.", "author": "David Y."}

That may be because whenever I eat Italian I'll generally choose pizza over pasta, but for the life of me, I can't remember the last time I was so happy ordering pasta.  The last couple of times I had pasta I regret it and I usually wish I had ordered pizza, but not here!  \n\nI've been here twice and I got try the pesto linguini, the spaghetti carbonara and the lasagne by stealing bites from an unsuspecting boyfriend.  I want to go back to try different pasta options, but I know it's going to be hard because with all the options I've already tried, I just really want to eat them again.  \n\nThe place is really quaint, I like the small, family-owned atmosphere I get from it, but you wouldn't be able to realize the potential greatness of this place from the outside.  I think the deceptive nature of the name also contribute that confusion since I think many of us contribute \"cafe\" to coffee shops versus the amazing pasta shop this place really is.  So, it is a little easy to just walk past Nob Hill Cafe and not realize what you're missing out on, but really it's such a great dining experience, go in!  \n\n*Edit, I gave it four stars in the beginning because I said it was a tad too expensive.  But it's so worth it, I love the pasta here.  So! I made the effort the edit this review to give this place five stars.  Go, go, go!", "author": "Cristina C."}

Perfectly dressed, fresh, crisp, & lemony.  \n\nThe fedelini (long pasta that is thinner than spaghetti) in a simple tomato garlic sauce is great, as is the pesto tortellini (tortellini romana).  But my favorite is the penne bettola, penne in a spicy red vodka cream sauce.  One of the best pasta dishes here.\n\nThe margherita pizza does not disappoint if you want to go the pizza route.  Perfectly crisp crust, tasty sauce, fresh aromatic basil.  Dreamy.\n\nWhatever you do, you don't want to skip dessert.  NHC does dessert as well as they do pasta.  The tiramisu is outstanding.  Unfortunately, the zabaione is not on the menu anymore, but if they can do it for you, it's a must order.  \n\nIt's a small venue.  You can see the chef in the window doing his thing.  It does get completely packed, so if you don't want to do the small space & a bit cramped thing, you need to go really early, & on an early/mid weekday.  No reservations, so at peak times, it is a long wait.\n\nIt's a family restaurant.

She reluctantly sat us at a table of 5 (3 of us were there) and just had an unpleasant demeanor the entire time. Our 2 people didn't end up showing up and she just couldn't help herself but to say \"this is why we don't seat people until the whole party is here.\" OKAY, WE GOT IT. It was just unnecessary. I was a server for many years and while I understand where she is coming from, it was not a big deal. It wasn't busy. Large parties were not beating down the door to come in.

Standard European way of cooking it with capers and white wine. The pasta that came with it was quite bad, though. \n\nOverall, I think the food is fine, nothing special. It feels like the American taste of Europe in the 80s, where people liked the creamy sauces and buttery dishes. I think this place is going to stay popular and I'm happy to see that happen.

I'm a big fan of pasta and I saw this on Yelp and it was close to the hotel I was staying at, so I decided to give it a try. \n\nThe restaurant is smaller than I expected, but this place was actually really cute and quiet. I got here at 6:30 and there wasn't a wait at all. We were seated to a small table for two. It was pretty dim inside, but they had a lil candle on the table for a bit of light. It's a bit fancy. They give you some bread with butter while you wait for your meal. I'm not sure what kind of bread it was but one of them tasted it. It seems like a muffin like bread. \n\nI ordered a Spaghetti Alla Carbonara. It was really delicious. It cost $12.75, but then I think it was worth it. It was really good. The pasta wasn't hard which I prefer soft speghetti and the sauce was good with the little bits of bacon I believe or some kind of meat. My boyfriend got Trancia Di Calamari. It's a calamari steak and it cost $17.95, which we think wasn't reallt worth it. He didn't really like the steak because the sauce they had for it was really sour which made it taste a bit weird. Other than the sauce being sour, the calamari wasn't that bad. It also came with some pasta and pea. When they serve you the meal. they ask if you want cheese or pepper. \n\nThe service here is really great. They would come around giving us water and asking if everything is okay. The server was very friendly and attentive. \n\nI would definitely come back here when I come visit San Francisco.", "author": "Winnie H."}

We had the lasagne, calzone, and pasta with the Romano cream sauce. \n\nUnfortunately the host who we checked in was rather curt and not helpful. When we put our names he told us an hour, maybe a little less. We had little ones with us, so we left for a bit to a playground right around the corner. We came back though within 30 min to make sure we were well within the time he had given us. He said he called our names 5 min earlier and that we would have to wait again. We ended up waiting closer to an hour and a half. When I asked to at least look at a menu I had to ask more than once. He seemed more interested in helping everyone else. \n\nWhen I complained he told me seating is not an exact science. I do understand that but there's a big difference between 25 min and 1 hour.

I had found this restaurant via Yelp, and I was excited: a little Italian restaurant with homemade pasta that's around the corner from the venue! Crazy! Alas, yes, it's a little restaurant, but everything else in my experience just did not square with the positive reviews.\n\nWe were seated by the only path to the bathroom/kitchen. I realized that we'd have constant foot traffic over us as staff moved back and forth from the kitchen, so my husband asked that we be moved. This was met with some attitude, as if we should have known not to be seated there from the beginning. Come on! You stuffed the tables in that corner out of pure greed in the first place. Nobody wants to sit there; everyone is enduring those two tables. Since I am about to spend a bunch of cash at your restaurant, perhaps I should have a small chance to actually enjoy being there?\n\nWe weren't given the focaccia bread everyone describes. We were given cold stale white bread. The caprese salad clearly had store-bought mozzarella and rather terrible tomatoes as the base. To hide the presentation, wilted greens were thrown over the top, and the whole thing was soaked in balsamic vinegar. Unpitted olives dotted the plate, as well as red onion. What's Italian about this? I also had the salad with roasted eggplant, and it was mainly comprised of wilted greens soaked in balsamic. I had more balsamic in my antipasti at this restaurant than I consume over the course of a full year. \n\nMy gnocchi was the worst gnocchi I think I have ever had. Some pieces were just straight up lumps of potato, and a couple were just weird runny messes with lumps of potato inside. The bolognese sauce tasted like some beef was thrown into some tomato sauce at the last minute. There was no richness to the sauce. \n\nMy husband's lasagna was terrible as well: the thing looked like a collapsed haphazard combination of ingredients that were never actually combined properly or cooked long enough.\n\nTiramisu is my favorite dessert. By the time we were offered the dessert menu, based on the gnocchi and the lasagna, I didn't want to find out what a screwed-up tiramisu tastes like.\n\nThis dinner was a waste of my money and time.", "author": "Sasha H."}

I ordered the tortellini romana and my friend ordered the chicken parmesan, lasagne, and potato goulash. I tasted them all and everything was great. I was just satisfied that I got a taste of the other dishes so that I know what to order the next time I come back.\n\nOverall, the food was delicious.

Many people ordered drinks while they waited and didn't seem to have a problem.

It didn't even feel very loud with everyone so close together. \n\nThe menu has a ton of variety with different pizzas and pastas. I opted for the Fettuccine Pesto  with grilled chicken.

The restaurant is small, so there is not a lot of waiting room, and there are tables at the entrance, making it difficult to provide some shelter. \n\nThe hostess seemed very nice, and we were projected to be seated in 30-45 minutes. Luckily, didn't have to wait that long because if you're WHOLE party is not there, they move on. Two of us - makes it easy.\n\nWe started off with the Crostini di Polenta. Unfortunately, there was much more to be desired. Though sounds fancy, the sauce didn't taste much more than marinara... from a can. The polenta was nicely cooked, and there was melted parmigiano cheese on top, definitely a nice addition. The cheese easily feel off, so it was difficult to get some with each bite. \n\nPasta! Now this is where they shine, and why I think it deserves 4 stars. We had the Spaghetti alla Carbonara and Tortellini Romana with pesto.\n\nCarbonara - probably the best in the city I've had thus far. Very creamy and obtains that thick, smoky eggy taste that carbonara should have. Definitely not runny like a lot places. Not quite Italy level, but probably need to go there for that!\n\nPesto tortellini - excellent. On point. Was a bit salty at some points, but added to the overall flavor and richness of a pesto dish. \n\nWe finished with the tiramisu. We would not get it again.\n\nWhy 4 stars? Well, I'll be honest.

The food was excellent, the prices extremely reasonable and the portions, happily were generous. I chose this spot after realizing that it was our best alternative for dinner before seeing Jeff Beck athe the Masonic. I hadn't been there in 20 years but it was as good it was back in the 90s.

I haven't been to this restaurant for awhile but I have fond memories of coming for years - I used to work a block away and always had nothing but memorable experiences, even at times for special occasions, like several of my birthdays!\n\nMy sister arrived before me - the \"hostess\" - if you can even call her that - asked how many in our party, my sister said 2.  Never once did she mention that we had to sign our names on a list.  Ok, so I show up.  My sister again goes back to speak to her to see how long the wait will now be as there are several people waiting outside and it's beginning to get very crowded.  The hostess then says to my sister - did you put your name on the list?  Ah no, because you asked us how many, she said 2 and assumed you had some sort of system going.  She then says it's 45 minutes to an hour wait, keep in mind by this time we were already waiting a good 20 minutes or so.  \n\nShe doesn't apologize, she doesn't even have the decency to address people with a proper - \"Please sign your name on our wait list, and it will be such and such time before there is an open table\".  Just a BLANK STARE.  \n\nSo we give this person our name, see her write it on the list and decide to wait anyway, even though at this point I am extremely pissed.  It gets better.  So keeping tabs on who was waiting before us, who came after, etc etc - she proceeds to seat SEVERAL parties before the people that were waiting longer.  One gentleman catches wind of this and goes inside to ask her what the *** is going on.  She plays dumb.  He is very upset as well.  But - he and his party are all drinking wine outside and I guess decide to stay a little bit longer for a table. \n\nWe finally get seated by this moron.  \n\nOur server, who is at least friendly and smiling comes to greet us and ask if we'd like to start with some wine.  We say yes, she gives us our menus, etc.  \n\nShe then seats 3 OTHER tables and proceeds to take their orders ahead of US!  We had to continually ask the person that brings bread for things that we needed, and more wine.  We finally get our food and try to at least salvage what's left of this really lame evening.  All the while people are standing inches away from us waiting for a table (there is literally nowhere to wait in the restaurant save two small chairs directly in the flow of traffic - so people were leaning up against walls just watching and waiting for a table. I'm not a person that drags out their meal because I am sensitive to others that are waiting, however this was very uncomfortable.\n\nThe owner/s really need to take heed of the people they are hiring and need to put some effort into training.  This is still a customer service oriented environment, or should be.  There is NO SYSTEM!!\n\nI was hoping to get seated in another area where the long time server works.  She at least is competent, friendly and nice to be around.\n\nAfter giving this restaurant a lot of my business and referring it to many hotel guests/friends/family etc. I am hard pressed to ever come here again.  NOT OK.", "author": "Danielle K."}

There is no food service outside, but you can have drinks.  Once we got our table I ordered the Fettuccine al pesto, I have been dreaming about it.  I also told my husband that he wanted the gnocchi bolognese, hint, hint.  That was my other choice so I wanted to taste it.  Both dishes were amazing, the pesto was creamy and garlicky but delicious and the gnocchi were like little fluffy delicious pillows with a scrumptious bolognese sauce.  We ended the night with a shared tiramisu.  This place is worth the trip. I ended up going two nights in a row.

My only complaints was the extremely long wait (which I knew about ahead of time) and the service was only ok. I came alone on a Thursday night and it was packed. There was a 25 minute wait and the only place wait is outside. The hostess was doing her best to accommodate everyone and there were some pretty finicky people waiting. When I sat down it took about another 10 minutes for my waitress to come over and ask for my drink order, I had the menu this entire time so I already knew what I wanted, I decided to skip the drink and just order because I wasn't sure when she was going to come back. To be fair I think there was only 2 servers in the whole restaurant, one on each side, probably 6 to 8 tables each. I wasn't upset or anything, I wasn't in any rush (which you probably shouldn't be if you come here). I ordered the chicken fettuccine with pesto sauce and pine nuts. Before the entree comes out they serve bread which was absolutely delicious. The main course was to die for. I would definitely recommend it. Overall, Food: 5 stars Service: 3 stars Cost: 4 stars.

We were confused and talked to the hostess who told us that she had already called our name. This was a lie, seeing that we had been right in front of the entrance for over an hour. That was frustrating because we waited about 30 minutes more. This was not for nothing. When we were seated, we received amazing treatment.

Ordered the chicken parm. First, the lighting situation is terrible. The restaurant has two halves, one that is brighter and more lively, and the other that is dimmer and more formal. This is perfectly fine. But, in the dimmer one, where we sat, some tables were sitting in almost complete darkness where you couldn't even see the food, let alone read the menu. Folks started taking iPhone flashlights out to read the menu (because they had to), blinding the rest of folks in the room. Second, the bread came, which was cold and hard. It was served with individually wrapped to-go butter. Never seen that in a restaurant serving $20 plates. Third, the chicken parm cheese was low quality and burnt. The chicken was completely dried out and stringy. The sauce was mediocre at best.\n\nThis place makes the Olive Garden look like ultra gourmet, and that's not even being fair to Olive Garden, which has pretty decent food.

This was hands down the best and most reasonably priced meal of my entire stay in San Francisco.\n\nThe restaurant is cozy, and you enter right by the kitchen, where you can see the chefs at work, and smell the wonderful aroma of the food they are preparing. Great way to start. \n\nWe were seated at a nice table where we could look out at the street for entertainment. Being seriously hungry, we were having a difficult time settling on what to order. The waitress described several items that we had questions about, but her description of the veal Piccata (Vitello Piccata) along with her indication that it was one of their most popular dishes, helped us decide on it. We also ordered the Insalata Mista (mixed greens with lemon herb dressing) which she indicated was large enough for both of us to share.\n\nThe salad was light and flavorful and perfectly proportioned. The Veal Piccata arrived, and I can't fully describe its lovely savory aroma of garlic, wine and herbs. The flavor did not disappoint. The lemon and capers provided a pleasant contrast to the butter and wine in the dish. I thoroughly enjoyed each bite. The portion was almost too much for me, but I didn't leave a single bit on the plate. \n\nIt was served with perfectly prepared snap peas that were neither over or under cooked, and a perfect complement to the veal. The side of penne romana was nicely cooked and tasty, but I'm not a big pasta person. With so much food in front of me, I focused on the veal and the snap peas since I couldn't possibly clean my plate.\n\nService was great, and our bill for the meal was extremely reasonable, and the least expensive of our entire visit to San Francisco.

We mentioned this to our waiter who took the plate away without saying much. They brought out a new dish which was laughable, but also insulting.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-29", "description": "I had high expectations for Nob Hill Cafe. I love Italian food and the reviews were positive overall. Alas, disappointment was on the menu for this evening. \nThe food was not the issue here; it wasn't spectacular in any way, but it was above average in most cases. We started with a daily special antipasti; prosciutto wrapped asparagus with mozzarella and marinara. It fell a little flat, as the asparagus was a little undercooked and the prosciutto seemed like a weak link that barely registered under a lot of marinara. For main courses, we each had pasta, but they couldn't have been more different. I chose the gnocchi Bolognese, which was very good, at times. The problems here were twofold. One, the plating was poor; by serving the dish on a flat plate, the temperature upon service was uneven, so as I worked from one side of the plate to the other it went from tepid to hot to cold. Two, the gnocchi were very unevenly made, so though the smaller pieces were perfect pillowy goodness, larger pieces were a bit gummy. On the positive side, the sauce was rich and meaty. My wife had the fedelini alla Cecca, which was quite good. Though the pasta itself was unremarkable, the sauce was fresh and light (and HOT!) For dessert we shared a slice of what they call gelato try-it. This is a layer of gelato on top of a thin layer of cheesecake with a layer of flavored cream on top. Ours had pumpkin gelato and Grand Marnier cream. It was probably the highlight of the meal.\nNow for the real problems with our dinner. First, the table we were seated at has no business being in the restaurant. It is a nightmare location crammed into a nook next to the entry to the service area. There is a constant cavalcade of staff bustling by and the small half-wall that separated my wife's chair from the dishwashing area was constantly being bumped, disturbing her seat. Now, if you are going to seat people in a location that every member of the wait staff passes twenty times per hour, PAY ATTENTION TO THEM. Having empty drinks for long stretches and waiting ten minutes to get bread brought to the table (without olive oil) while being ignored by everyone constantly passing by is infuriating. I also need to comment on the noise level in the restaurant. It is quite noisy, as you would expect a small popular place to be, but the most noise here comes from them bussing the tables like they hate all of the plates and flatware. Numerous times we watched in shock as plates and glasses were literally tossed onto tables and place settings were slapped down like dominos in a southern grudge match. And it wasn't just one employee; everyone who turned a table got into the act. It was a little disconcerting and very annoying.", "author": "Jason E."}

A family friend told us that we should definitely check out Nob Hill.  I had actually had my eye on a place called Scala's Bistro, since it was just .1 mile from the hotel, however the recommendation of Nob Hill was to hard for Suzie to pass up and just .3 miles further, she pleaded with me with her big blue eyes batting... pweeze..Ah jeez.. okay.   I consulted the google mappy thing on the Yelp app and chartered our course for Nob Hill.  Notice the word Hill.  We set out for dinner wanting to get there before the wait started.  Off we go down Stockton and then make a right on Taylor and start up a slight incline for a block.  Followed by the next block which is noticeable steeper.  By the next block, I noticed that there were Sherpa's available at base camp 2 for the final leg to the summit.  We had already passed one gentlemen who was grasping his chest and leaning against a wall.  Oh wait, that was actually me, it's all bit hazy since the air is quite thin up here.  Finally, we hit a plateau, with a cathedral soaring up the heavens.  Very appropriate, since it would be a good place to bury me at this point.  Chafed, winded, and at this point completely knackered, we spied the sign Nob Hill Cafe.  Victory is ours!!\n\nNob HIll is tiny, quaint and smells amazing.  The hostess welcomed us and we were sat at a little 2 top, next to the kitchen and the dish washing area.  Loud clashing of pots and pans, bustling wait-staff and bus folks and the ever engaging aroma of loveliness.  Our waitress was really great and let us know the specials and asked if I was okay.  Apparently, I looked as bad as I felt.  Nothing a couple glasses of Prosecco wouldn't cure and my spirits lifted immediately.  We ordered the Calamari Salad, Gnocchi and Carbonara.  \n\nCalamari was fresh and served with white beans, lemon and capers.  Great portion for two to split.  Refreshing and well prepared.  My Carbonara came out with Romana creme sauce, pancetta bites, garlic and egg.  It was again a healthy portion, full of flavor and extremely filling.  Top Drawer.  Suzie's Gnocchi Bolognese was the bomb.  The fennel sausage in the meat sauce was exceptional.  Fennel should be used more often in a dish like this.  I will definitely remember this the next time I make a bolognese.  This had to be their signature dish, since almost everywhere I looked this is what folks were ordering.\n\nThe menu has many offerings including pizza, anti-pasta's, salads and mains.  Service was excellent and pleasant.  She was extremely well informed, able to have knowledge of the wine menu as well as entree's selection.  I overheard her mention to tables as well as ours, \"if you don't know what to get, let me know what you are stuck between and I will help you make a decision\".  Elena was really on her game.  A nice surprise was the price point.  Quite affordable for a meal of this quality.  Get there early so you don't get stuck in line.. however, they will provide you with a glass of wine while you wait.", "author": "Jens B."}

Just came back from a fabulous vacation in Italy and is in the hunt for a good carbonara place in the Bay Area.  Came here because it was highly rated for their carbonara....sigh, my hunt continues.\n\nMy husband and I attended a matinee show in SF and were hungry for an early dinner before heading back home.  Since Nob Hill Cafe doesn't take reservation, we arrived by 6 pm to beat the crowd.  We didn't wait too long before getting seated.  The hostess had a wee bit of an air about her when I merely asked if there were any available tables in the adjacent room for 2.  She just said, \"no.\" O-kaayyy.....\n\nOur waitress promptly greeted us and opened our wine for us.  Corkage here is $20. Not too bad for S.F. I was eying the antipasto starter, but it's a typical 2x portion.  My husband doesn't eat meat so I asked if there was a possibility of getting a 1/2 portion.  I was told that was not possible, but she politely explained the antipasto comes with grilled veggies.  So I decided to order it and will take left overs home if we can't finish.  We also ordered the ribolita soup, the crab ravioli special, and the pasta carbonara.\n\nWhen the antipasto came, I was not impressed.  The plate came with \"generous\" amount of grilled veggies and artichokes, but 1 thin slice of prosciutto and 2 pieces of pancetta about 1\" square and 1/4\" thick.  THAT'S IT??? I paid $14 for 3 small pieces of meat? My husband loved it, but I was left disappointed.  His ribolita soup was light and flavorful. So far it's great for him as I munch on bread and grilled veggies.\n\nThen our main courses came.  The carbonara is very clumpy.  I think the chef may have let it sat too long.  I tried tossing the pasta to loosen them, but they were just kind of stuck to each other; could used a little olive oil to loosen them a bit.  My husband's crab ravioli sauce was very salty.  It was hard for him to eat it.  At one point, he had to tell our waitress about the salt.  The waitress acknowledged that she had heard the same from other folks...BUT didn't offer to replace it with somethign else! No, she was just very sympathetic. Uh...OK.  So we just didn't finish our meal.  I took 1/2 of my pasta home.  I reheated for lunch the next day and toss it with a little EVOO and it was very good.\n\nOverall, not worth going back for.....my hunt continues.", "author": "G K."}

Before walking in, I was reminded of the classic (1968) movie Bullit since Steve McQueen's character (Frank Bullit) lived across the street and purchased a stack of TV dinners at the grocery store next door.\n\nAnyway - this was the closest place walking distance from the Mark Hopkins that didn't involve hills.  We were seated promptly and the staff was friendly.  I tried the Beef Carpaccio and the Mushroom Risotto.  I would order the Beef Carpaccio again.  It was a well portioned plate and tasted great.  However - I was not a fan of the Mushroom Risotto since it was dry/fluffy and not creamy.\n\nThat being said, I will try this spot again very soon.  Although, my current rating is 3 stars only, I'm hoping to try more good food to raise my rating.  I hear the gnocchi bolognese is a hit.  Looking forward to it!", "author": "Alvin J."}

What a hidden little gem, although not so hidden considering the mobs of people waiting to be sat at this place on a Friday night. Well, we waited and it was worth it. Came here on a very last minute triple date with 2 other couples after one of them heard about how yummy this place is. Super cozy, small space with unbelievably delicious food. I find it super hard to find old school, great, and reasonably priced Italian food in SF, but this place has it. We all shared a few bottles of house red and white wine, and split the Ziti with spicy vodka sauce and the tortellini with pesto and pine nuts. Plates embarrassingly clean by the end of it. Oh and did I mention the to die for free bread? I'll be coming back here on the regular. \n\nOne star off for the service, not very friendly or personable, but not so bad that it became annoying or anything.", "author": "Alexis T."}

Pasta used to be my favorite cuisine but after I discovered ramen and sushi, it fell back to #3.  Nevertheless, I still love it!  There's a bit of a wait since it's kind of small, but the patio is comfy to wait in.\n\nWe ordered the garlic bread, insalata caprese, linguine alla vongole, and the gnocchi bolognese.  Since I went with a gf and her bf hates cheese, we piled on the garlic and mozzarella.  Garlic bread was a little tough for my liking that it kind of hurt for me to eat.  I'm not fond of super crunchy bread.  The salad has balls of mozzarella, but it wasn't too heavy/cheesy to the point of ruining our meal.  My linguine had plenty of clams and the lemon zest was definitely noticeable but I still liked it.  My friend swears on the gnocchi but she was a bit disappointed since it didn't come out piping hot, which probably would've made it taste much better.  Neither of us finished our dishes though since they are huge portions.  I was very happy to have leftovers for the next day.\n\nLike I said, the place is soooo cute, great for date night!", "author": "Jane N."}

At 11.30am there were about three other tables being served aside from ours, so it's obviously a popular place. Very cute place. \n\n|| Service\nAttentive, very friendly waitress, extremely speedy. \n\n|| Ordered\nInsalata Caprese ($8.25)\nProsciutto E Melone ($8.50)\nplus a Peroni (~$5) and glass of Prosecco (~$10). \nThe prices were reasonable. \n\n|| Food\nThe prosciutto dish size was really substantial. The melon was juicy and cold, but the prosciutto seemed dry around the edges, as if it was old. \n\nThe Caprese was disappointing. The beauty of a Caprese is its fresh flavours and simplicity. Unfortunately, it was too heavy on the balsamic vinegar and came with onions and olives - all of which are unnecessary on a Caprese (in my opinion). The olives were a little wrinkly and the dish didn't taste fresh. \n\n|| Verdict\nThe antipasti dishes we chose didn't seem fresh. I'd return again to try some of their heartier dishes.", "author": "Emma R."}

This one was very convenient.  \n\nThe theme was Italian, the clientele was San Franciscan.  We were at the top of Nob Hill, and we could tell.  So what do the rich people eat?  \n\nMy Lady had a frittatta putanesca, which looked great.  The potatoes were mixed into the frittatta, which surprised her, and while she had expected a corn muffin, we wound up ordering one for her.  The corn muffin was more muffin than corn, with glaze on the outside and sweetness on the inside.  \n\nI ordered a pizzetta di salsicia, because the ingredients looked so unusual.  Besides Aidell's chicken sausage, it was topped with \"baked egg.\"  What, I wanted to know, was baked egg?  It seems that they open an egg on top of thin-crust pizza, over the tomato paste and sausage.  It added a flavor and texture I would never expect in a pizza.  Well played, Nob Hill Cafe!  \n\nThe wine was worth it, too.  2 glasses of Marche Verdicchio, a mild medium white table wine, and a glass of Prosecco accompanied our lunch.  \n\nThat's a whole lunch for $55.46 + tip.

You're good at what you do, but, Lord, I just can't stand you and your prejudices.\n\nFirst of all, this place is special to me. So like so many other failed relationships, I still want very much to love it like that first magical time. It was recommended to us by the concierge at the Fairmont and was therefore the first restaurant where my boyfriend and I tried when we moved to San Francisco years ago. So it means something. I'm, if anything, predisposed to liking it. But, there's really only so many chances I can give, because nobody likes an enabler.\n\nWe always order at least the carpaccio, which can be a bit lemon heavy, and the carbonara. I've had the tortellini, veal and gnocchi, all of which I enjoy. We like the lasagna, too. The caprese and polenta apps are good, too. \n\nSince the food was good, naturally we try to return as often as possible. So, we've managed to make it back on birthdays, anniversaries, and many random nights out. Our experience tended to be very up-and-down. For a while we couldn't put our finger on why. The food was pretty consistent (sometimes a little lemony). Then we realized that it was the service. Every time that our server was the blonde lady, we had a fantastic and special evening. Pretty much every time our server was the guy with the accent, we had a miserable time and lousy, brusque service. \n\nBefore looking at the other reviews, I could not figure out what it was. Then thinking back on it, the only time we had good service from the male server was with a mixed crowd of white people (the bf and I are Asian). Coincidence? I certainly, certainly hope so. \n\nSuffice it to say, I will, very regretfully, not be returning to the restaurant anytime soon. Maybe once more on our next anniversary with the hopes that we merely caught a string of randomly occurring very bad days.

It's solid, inexpensive, CONSISTENT, honest Italian-fare, that benefits from great service and attention to quality.\n\nIt has become our go-to spot when we don't feel like cooking, or simply feel like going somewhere that's almost as cozy as home.", "author": "Will S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-09-19", "description": "**Sept. 17 - Dinner**\n\nIf I could give this place a negative rating - I would gladly do so. \n\nMy sis, Mom and I all walked in and the place was packed for a Saturday night. It was a given and we knew that. \n\nHowever, their was a party of four Caucasian group seating outside and the lady said out loud: \"they're going into this restaurant dressed like that?\"\n\nWHAT?! I just didn't hear that - did I? Oh hell no!? \n\nTo all you real SF folks, my sibling and I were wearing our puffy jackets (Patagonia and Marmot if you need to know the brands) and my mom in a black sherpa like hoody all with jeans and flats. We weren't wearing anything scandalous! \n\nMy sis checked inside and came out...and I told them what happened. \nMy mom stared at the lady while we stood outside and my sis said out loud: \"Please, it's not like it's Gary Danko. For crying out loud, we ate the Boulevard dressed like this...\" Mind you, my mom was still staring at this point. Lady didn't say crap!\n\nThe hostess called us in and told us to wait inside since my Mom was diabetic and she needed to eat bread and drink juice. \n\nBy then all of us were fuming. \n\nWe got seated... in what my mom would say: the grungy side of the restaurant (near the kitchen) and the \"nicely dressed folks\" were seated by the bar. \n\nTheir were two servers: one blonde and one douche bag... oh my bad, one \"Italian\" server that looked and acted like he hated everybody that walked in the restaurant and by no means did he hide it. \n\nHe took our order... no hello or what not. Douche bag server forced me to order for my sis who's out with the nanny taking care of the nephew. Apparently, my sis had already talked to the hostess telling her our situation: 2 people will switch to be with the baby and so the food needs to come when the other two is done so the food won't be cold.\n\nHowever, douche bag server could care less. I went up to him and the conversation went like this... he was standing with the other blondie server and the hostess near the bar:\n\nMe: (tap tap on the shoulder - gently) \"excuse me sir, can you please hold the Linguine Aglio Olio pasta for my sister?\"\n\nDouche bag: \"NO! I can't hold it. Kitchen is closing!\" (this is where he wanted to stab me with his killer looks)\n\nSo I return to our table and told my family what happened. My mom told me to take a chill pill and let it go. \n\nHowever, my dad pointed out a good fact: if the kitchen was closing, then why where there five or more \"WHITE\" parties coming into the restaurant? Why aren't the kitchen closed for them but for our party, it was?\n\nWTF?\n\nBy then, we were on fire. It was fueled more by our douche bag server literally dumping all our pasta in our table. It was a small table and their dishes aren't really the smallest so there we were, all trying to fit all those damn pasta in that table and being rushed by him. He didn't even bother taking away our appetizer plates and didn't give my mom a steak knife for her veal!\n\nLesson learned: \n1. Don't go here if your party is full Asian. You need to add a token white person to blend in the crowd.\n\n2. Don't you dare dress up. The most expensive dish is the veal and it was $18 - please. My mom said it was so hard.\n\n3. If you see two servers and one is the blonde, ask for the blonde not the Italian douche - it'll ruin whatever experience you're thinking you'll have in this place.\n\nTo the owner/management of this place: my family and I have been to a lot of restaurants in the city and around the continental US and even internationally -- more expensive and more luxurious than your restaurant... BUT we've never been racially profiled until your place!\n\nPlease teach your token male server that was working there on Saturday, Sept. 17 around 9 pm some manners. If he hates serving \"colored\" people like my family then he's in the wrong business and wrong city. Tell him to try Alabama! \n\nLast: to all you reading this review... I rarely bring the racial card but this restaurant made it quite evident that they were being racist to us. Therefore, if you're Asian and want to experience first hand what my family and I went through... go on weekends at night and seat where that douche serves. If you're really craving Italian... FIRENZE... doesn't even compare to this junk.", "author": "Cath M."}

After the small awkward blip however the rest of the meal was amazing! We got three plates with the intent of sharing. One gnocchi - this was delicious and had an amazing cream sauce; 2 was the ravioli with one of the best pesto sauces I've had; and 3 was the spicy pasta rigatoni also quite tasty! It was a really nice day so we enjoyed the food outdoors. Service was actually impressively quick and with great presentation and taste.

The bread didn't soak up enough of the custard and it was dry. \n\nFor dinner, I had the gnocchi. It was way overcooked; the texture wasn't light or fluffy, but rather mushy.

Also keep in mind that this is not the best place for big parties, if there are 4 or more people in your group, your wait could be even longer.  The staff try their best to get people seated as soon as possible, and while you're waiting outside they are more than happy to bring you glasses of wine to make your wait a little more tolerable.  \n\nMy advice is try to go earlier in the evening, around 6:00-7:00 to cut your wait time down, otherwise dress very warm because that San Francisco breeze will have you shivering if you're not prepared.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-03-14", "description": "I was honestly really excited about this restaurant after reading all of the reviews.  Two friends and I were planning to go to a nearby Italian restaurant, but when we arrived and learned the wait would be an hour, we called over to Nob Hill Cafe and were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes.  Hungry, we walked over, put our name in, and sat down at a table to wait outside.  \n\n20 minutes passed, and we kept waiting,  Then 40 minutes.  We began to notice that parties our same size who arrived after us were being seated.  The hostess came out and assured us that our table was \"getting up to leave\" so we would be seated shortly. Five minutes later, she came out, not making eye contact with us, and called another party our same size that had arrived a half hour AFTER we did. (What was going on here? Rich regulars?) \n\nWe waited some more (and did I mention it was COLD outside)?  Finally, an hour after we put our name in, the hostess came outside to collect us.  A total of 4-5 other parties who had arrived after us were seated before us.  \n\nI politely asked if there was a reservation system we had missed, as other parties were seated before us.  I was told that this was \"how the system worked,\" as she had our name under this table, and the people who had this table \"took forever to leave.\"  My group is pretty easy to please--to be honest, a complimentary cappuccino to warm us up would have smoothed everything over.   But she did not apologize or offer any kind of deduction.  \n\nThe server brought bread (not served warm) to the table, with pats of butter wrapped in foil.  We were seated right inside the front door, with two open windows that blew in cold air, so I was pretty uncomfortable during the meal--I never took my jacket off...and never thawed out from that hour wait outside.\n\nThe food: \n\nWe ordered the calamari salad, which was decent, though the beans were undercooked.  The bruchetta was good.\n\nI ordered the spaghetti carbonara, which was tasty, though very rich (think a pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl). It was served hot, though, which was great--the bowl doubled as a hand warmer to help with the cold air blowing in through the windows.  One friend ordered the pesto, which was not bad, and the other ordered the veal piccata, which was much too lemony.  We all agreed the carbonara was the best entree of the three.\n\nOne of my friends is Italian, and she said overall, the food was okay, worthy of 3 stars.  Given the situation with our wait time, I gave them 1 star on service, and averaged the two for the rating.\n\nWe should have stayed at the first Italian restaurant with the hour wait.  If you're an average yelper and not a wealthy regular of this place, I might suggest looking elsewhere...", "author": "Rachael S."}

Nob Hill Cafe is this adorable cafe that felt very local in a nice location (if you walk though, be ready for a work out) . When we first arrived there was a small line outside for people waiting to get in, this is always a good sign. My sister and I put our name on the list to be seated and waiting about 10-15 minutes, during that 10-15 minutes though the hostess gave us menus and asked us if we would like a drink while we waited. She was very sweet and made sure that we were taken care of. Once seated we were given bread and given our drinks quickly. I had a glass of the house red which was nice and warmed me up just enough for the walk back to the hotel. I ordered the chicken with mozzarella and parmigan melted on top  and it was probably one of the best meals I have eaten in San Francisco. The cheese was fresh and balanced the chicken and tomato sauce out wonderfully. My sister enjoyed her meal and said that it was delicious. All of the the meals being served looked divine.

The Gnocchi is perfect, as is the pesto. I am a creature of habit and always order the same thing, but my husband has had numerous items off the menu and been pleased each time. The pizza is his easy go-to. Service is always friendly, never rushed. There are two downsides, though. One: There is always a wait of around 30 minutes. Two: The restaurant isn't large, so their tables are very close to one another.

Fino Restaurant was an hour wait, and we couldn't wait that long. We were finally able to go there the week after (see my review). However, it was a good thing since we got to experience Nob Hill Cafe.My girl and I walked from Post St. to Nob Hill Cafe. That is not that easy of a trek, but the small journey was worth it.\n\nWe get there and I liked the ambiance of the place from the get go. The host was real friendly. Got our names on the list and told us the wait. We are finally seated and I swear this place can be one of those restaurants that can be featured in one of those shows on Food Network.\n\nMost of the entrees are less than $15. Keep in mind though, there aren't much choices. I was skeptical at first because of this. Also if you see the menu, most do not come with meat. You pay a bit more if you want to add chicken to any pasty entree. But it will still be less than $20.I order a rigatoni pasta with sausage dish that was on the special menu that night. My girl ordered the Linguine alla Vongole (baby clams, white wine lemon sauce).As we wait for our food the complimentary bread was delicious. There was one bread in the bunch in particular. It was of a really good muffin consistency. We were eager to ask for more, but we have learned from our many years of eating out to have self control to save room to really enjoy the main course.\n\nSo we get our food and I will admit I was surprised at the portions. Our dishes were only about $13 each, and I was expecting pretty small portions. However my fat ass was able to get stuffed. If I wasn't so fat I would have been \"satisfied\" with some left over. But, I just continued to eat until I put it all away, then helped my GF finish hers. Everything tasted fresh and clean. When I say \"clean\", it just didn't taste processed or premade like low rated restaurants. The rigatoni dish I ordered is not on the regular menu, but I will recommend it if you see it. My GF's dish I must caution that when they say white wine LEMON sauce, they mean it. The distinct taste of the lemon is there. It may be overwhelming to some, but it was something new and I welcomed it. The baby clams offset some of the sour for a perfect combination.\n\nIn the end, we had a surprisingly great experience here and would definitely come again. Staff was all friendly and right on top of everything even though it was a full house and what seemed like limited staff. Value was extremely good with great tasting food.So if your first choice is not available, this is a very good alternative and you'll find it perhaps your first choice in the future like we did.", "author": "Eugene N."}

My fiance and I were seated at a table for 2 around 8pm.  We ordered an antipasti plate, pizza and the veal osso bucco special.  We also brought our own wine and were charged a $20 corkage fee which was completely expected and is standard fare for San Francisco so no big deal.  Including tip, our bill was around $100 and we were mostly done with our entrees not long after 9pm.  \n\nAt this point, we noticed the busboys starting to aggressively remove items from our table which is usually to be interpreted as the restaurant wanting you to leave so that they can re-seat your table.  Since we were still in the process of finishing our wine, we remained seated and the manager came over to ask if we enjoyed everything.  We indicated that we had and that everything was very good.  She then said, \"... OK, that's great, well, we really need the table.\"  In other words, \"We don't care that you've only been here about 75 minutes (maximum) and spent $100, we want you to get up because we care more about making money than providing a pleasant, relaxed ambiance in which you can finish your meal at your own pace.\"\n\nI've never been told to leave by a restaurant in my life, and I cannot excuse this.  It would have been more understandable had we simply sat down for coffee and dessert, but we had purchased an entire meal and were only occupying a 2-top.

No problem, I had read all the online reviews so knew about no reservations, the rustic bread, prices, and popularity. We made the short walk to the corner to the lovely park. Nice and mellow with kids, people, dogs, and Nob Hill. Back at the restaurant we got a window table, I'd expected we might end up with the hallway table but nope, we got lucky. Our food came out hot (if you want to a quick meal, keep this in mind - took a while for the Pollo Alla Parmigiana to cool down ). Only snafu was minor- (efficient) waiter asked if we wanted pepper on our soup and then forgot. No worries. The caf\u00e9 is small, busy, and fast. I figured if we asked for anything unusual or different it might be a problem. We reminded him about the pepper and it came some time later - soup was excellent either way.

Depending on which room you are seated in (both are tiny and tables are close together, but really who cares) it can be a bit loud depending on the amount of wine your fellow diners are enjoying.

It remains one of my favorite intimate spots in the city. The food consistently falls in the good to outstanding range. I find their offerings to be fresh and seasonally appropriate.  The wine selection is average for a cafe of this type. Some of the deserts are just amazing.\n\nIf you are in the Nob Hill area, I suggest that you will be extremely pleased if you dine at Nob Hill Cafe. Parking can be challenging, the wait can be long, and the weather can be brisk (bring a jacket for your outdoor wait).

She suggested two places to meet for dinner, and I chose Nob Hill Caf\u00e9 due to the proximity to my hotel and the awesome-looking Italian fare on their menu. \n\nThe Yelp app provided great directions, and the photos helped me recognize it when the cab got close. The staff was absolutely fantastic -- I arrived before she did and they don't seat incomplete parties, but they hooked me up with a fabulous Sonoma Coast red wine and a chair while I waited. Even the server who helped me was also from North Carolina! \n\nNob Hill Caf\u00e9 is small and has tables which seat only 2 or 4 people, so timing is of the essence if you want to eat here during peak times. It was nearly empty when I arrived around 5:30 p.m. and started to fill up quickly. When my friend arrived later, we were able to get a table by the front door. We talked and talked forever before ever looking at the menu, but our server was very friendly and patient with us. At last we decided on the Fedelini alla Cecca, an awesome angel hair dish with tomatoes, basil and garlic. \n\nThe service, food, wine, and atmosphere were all impeccable.

My wife had dropped my mother, grandmother and I off at the corner while she parked the car. We go into the restaurant and there were 5 tables open and we sat down at one. A server of some sort gave us menus and I informed we had one more person coming. My wife was parking the car. The server informed the manager or head server that our party was all here. The manger snatched the menus from us and said we can't seat you until all members of your party are here. She was very rude with her tone and manner in which she did this. I said this is stupid. I was very very upset because now we had to get up and my grandmother is 80 years old and doesn't move around very well and wait for my wife. If my wife hadn't been walking up as we were at the door we would have left. We sat back at the original table and told the original server that we were all here. They gave us a different server. As we were sitting and ordered our food. They sat a group of two women and we noticed that they were waiting another person. Interestingly enough they didn't get the same rude treatment.

It has a quaint and cozy atmosphere that carries on over into their great service.  \n\nThe green salad was very simple.  Some various lettuces and greens with a light vinagrette. Their main dishes are pretty good, but a little on the heavy side - with lots of cheese on their main dishes (margherita pizza and lasagna.)  \n\nMy main complaint is that although the pizza was good, I prefer my margharita pizzas to be a lighter thin crust affair.  Their margherita was just another pizza, but with basil and some chopped up tomatoes on it.  Oh yeah, and tons of mozzarella was all over.  \n\nBoth the lasagna and the pizza warranted a blotting technique to get some excess oil from the baked cheese all over the top.  Once sopped up, the food was very good.\n\nWhy did I give this a 4 star, when a similarly greasy breakfast joint (Nob Hill Grille) (I wonder if all the Nob Hill named restaurants are greasy...) got a 2 star?

My fiance and I went here about two weeks ago, it was actually our first night out after having our baby girl,,, so we were kind of excited to get out! :)  Anywho,,,, you can't make reservations but we had a really short wait of only 10 minutes and the hostess was great!  We were seated at our table and that's when things started going downhill.  Our waitress barley acknowledged us and we had to wait a fairly long time for her to come to our table.  It's a very small restaurant and she seemed super friendly to the table next to us, telling them what she liked best on the menu and being super friendly and going on and on.  She did this to all the tables she was working then when she came to us, she was very rude and short with us,, it was the most bizarre thing ever. :(  We are pretty easily pleased so for us to complain takes a lot.  The food was great and we love that the restaurant is in our neighborhood but the service we received was horrible. Didn't quite catch her name but she had long blonde hair.  Even at the end of our dinner, she didn't even ask us if we wanted dessert or how the food was or even thank us for coming in.  We tried for this experience to not spoil our night but it definitely put a damper on things.", "author": "Tina T."}

They drench their pastas in oil/butter and the food is really bland. I had the bacon-laden pasta once (let it get a bit cold because we were preparing to go out after) and it was just pieces of grease everywhere.\n\nSecond, price is not very reasonable. $20 for a tiny entree that's tastes just like Safeway pesto & $1 pasta?

It was walking distance from our hotel.  We got there at about 9 on Friday night and the wait wasn't bad at all, about 20 minutes.  Weather was great so sitting outside so waiting was not an issue at all.  \n\nWe were seated in one of the cute little tables in the very front small bay windows.  Very private and romantical... I loved it because I hadn't seen my boyfriend in a month (don't get me started on how much LDRs suck) and this was the first night of our weekend together.  The table made it very easy to talk and flirt and enjoy each other :)\n\nAnyway, we had a bottle of Montepulciano, and I ordered the mixed greens salad, BF had the artichoke soup that was on special to start with.  Both were delicious although the portions were HUGE for starters.  For main course I had the penne in cream sauce, he had the tortellini in pesto.  Neither were anything fancy or groundbreaking, but solid, and good good good.  Huge portions again.  Could have easily just eaten half and taken the rest but I was a giant pig and ate almost the whole thing, so did the BF.  And no, nothing we ate (aside from maybe my starter salad) was remotely healthy here. \n\nWe skipped dessert since we were such giant pigs from the rest of dinner.  It was getting late and the restaurant was emptying out pretty quickly, but we never once felt rushed to leave.  Oh, our server was great, it was an Irish guy who is from Dublin originally.  I only found out the Dublin part because I had had lots of wine and was pretty chatty towards the end of dinner :)\n\nI did not find the prices to be too high at all, especially compared to what I found at other restaurants in this neighborhood when researching where to go, I think our bill, with the wine, was around $75.\n\nOverall a great spot and I will definitely come again whenever I find myself in the neighborhood again.", "author": "Julie C."}

If we're feeling extra naughty, for dessert we'll order the granache (unreal...it's like an orgasm in your mouth...the good kind). THEN...the next morning, after being unable to stop thinking about that amazing meal, I'll have my leftovers for bfast and let me tell you...there are seldom happier mornings in my life than when I eagerly dive into my vongole leftovers with my favorite chopsticks and happiness in my heart.

Their pesto is hands down one of the best I've ever had, and with the fresh pasta topped with some pine nuts. Mmmmmm!\n\nMost of their pastas are simple, and not over the top. Like their clams and white wine pasta. Fresh tender clams, with a hint of lemon and a sprinkle of Parmesan on top.\n\nTheir specials are almost always amazing. If you love mushrooms, and they happen to have their triple mushroom raviolis GET THEME!\n\nTheir specialty pizzas are very good most of the time. They do a pear, porchetta and Gorgonzola pizza on occasion that's delectable.\n\nIf you are there on a Sunday morning, and want something for a brunch. Try their breakfast pizza. With scrambled eegs, applewood sausage, cheese and a light tomato sauce.\n\nTheir dessert gelato is unlike any I've had.  It's served as a cake slice on a light crust that varies with the flavor. Well worth trying if you are up for a dessert.\n\nIf you don't like crowded small tables, and want more of an upscale dinning experience, then go do the street to their other restaurant.

First, let me say that we tried to go there a few nights ago and when they were full and on a wait they kindly suggested a place down the street (Venticello Ristorante).  This place was pretty expensive and their portions were rather small (although still delicious).  So tonight we returned to Nob Hill Cafe for two reasons: portion size and price.  For $13 each we got nice big bowls of flavor packed pasta.  It wasn't overly fancy with exotic vegetables and cheeses and waiters in bowties, but was extremely flavorful and delicious.  We also got lots of fresh parm on top.\n\nSo it depends what you want.  Some really good pasta at a great price in a nice atmosphere, or something that's built up to be a lot fancier and classier and is much more expensive.  Both places we're delicious, just a matter of what you're in the mood for.  I'd go to NHC 10 more times before retrying the other place, but that's just me.", "author": "Vince P."}

Luckily, she also has good taste and Nob Hill turned out to be a great choice.\n\nThe restaurant is small and there was a wait despite the fact that it was already 8PM on a Monday night. We settled down in one of the empty outdoor tables with a bottle of Sangiovese as we waited, and soon enough we were seated. Nothing like passing time with wine!\n \nFor my entr\u00e9e I had...\nGNOCCHI BOLOGNESE (with fennel seed sausage, ground beef, and pomodoro) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNMCITEPGh6cgqd6VDfQOg?select=7yPc_HQx2jEQeRAzFUBH6w Nob Hill's homemade gnocchi is so plump and fluffy and the ratio of meat to gnocchi was perfect. If you like gnocchi, I highly recommend this dish.\n\nMy friends had..\nSPAGHETTI ALLA CARBONARA (with roman cream sauce, pancetta, egg, and garlic) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNMCITEPGh6cgqd6VDfQOg?select=llujorLfLno6828zkr2MHQ This was my second favorite dish of the night, after the gnocchi. The pancetta gave the whole dish a lovely smokiness.\nLINGUINE ALLA VONGOLE (with baby clams, white wine, lemon and garlic) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNMCITEPGh6cgqd6VDfQOg?select=C9fkSwfvm8modH7Ef4KMfg I originally wanted to order this because linguine alla vongole is my favorite pasta dish but my friend warned me against it saying that it's really sour and she's sent it back before. But since another friend ended up ordering it, I got to try it anyway. I can see why I was warned against this dish. The lemon flavor in the dish is really overpowering and I've never had linguine alla vongole like it. If you're normally a fan of linguine alla vongole, don't get it at Nob Hill Cafe. It won't be what you're expecting.\nTORTELLINI ROMANA (with creamy pesto and toasted pine nuts) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNMCITEPGh6cgqd6VDfQOg?select=sytMvRhWXrMkCbFNUC_NHQ Another solid dish, though not as memorable as the gnocchi and carbonara. \n\nFor dessert we shared the PUMPKIN & GRAND MARNIER GELATO http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNMCITEPGh6cgqd6VDfQOg?select=H0grzrWq3LW9il6zMukUHw and CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE CHIP GELATO http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNMCITEPGh6cgqd6VDfQOg?select=9P6ZaIKN_pLWsxB1e5og2w. Nob Hill's gelato comes in the form of ice cream cake with a thin layer of cheesecake at the bottom. Genius. Both were really good, though I liked the chocolate better because I tend to prefer chocolate desserts. Nob Hill has a wide variety of gelato flavors and I dare say that as long as you pick a flavor you like, you will definitely like what you get.\n\nService was really friendly and prompt and dinner was surprising inexpensive; the pasta entr\u00e9es were no more than $15 each. Though I probably wouldn't drive an hour just to dine here again, I definitely would go again if I happened to already be in the area.

We both commented what a cozy and relaxing atmosphere they had.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nI had the Insulata Caprese for appetizer, and it very easily exceeded my expectations.  It was absolutely delicious, with the perfect amount of balsamic and olive oil over the fresh tomato, mozzarella, and basil.  For main dish, I ordered Tortellini Ricotta with Romano sauce.  Both the pasta and sauce were light with the perfect amount of flavor and portion.  Once again, they hit a homerun with my order!\n\nFor my husband's meal, he went with the Beef Carpaccio for an appetizer.  He had only tried it once previously, and this was very out of the box for his normally conservative tastes.  He loved it and left nothing behind with this delicious appetizer.  For main dish, he ordered the Gnocchi with Bolognese.  We had read this was a popular dish, and it certainly did not disappoint.  Gnocchi can sometimes be very heavy but this was light - similar to pasta and not potato, and was a delicious success.\n\nIn summary, with each of us ordering two glasses of wine, our own appetizer and main dish, we had no problem paying $100 (tip included) for a wonderful meal and romantic dinner experience.

I rang in advance to book a table for 7 people in the nob hill cafe. I was told they do not take bookings. I asked would it busy, is there point in walking from union square (where I live) up to the restaurant as we really wanted to try this place out. The lady on the phone said they would not be busy and that they would be able to seat my group but there may be a little bit of a wait. Taking her word for it, we walked up and put our names down on the waiting list with the hostess. We were told there would be a wait of 45minutes so we asked would it be ok to have a drink in a hotel nearby as it was a cold day and sitting outside would be uncomfortable we were reassured that would be fine to wander off as there would be at least a 40 minute wait before they sat anyone. 30 minutes later and starving, my group of 7 and I arrived back at the restaurant to be told we would not be seated and that we had missed our place in line??!!! I then saw that the RUDE hostess had seated almost 8/9 people after telling my group there would be nothing available for at least 45mintues and wrongfully telling us that we could have a drink and wait? The hostess had a very rotten attitude. We were then stranded with a group of 7 and no reservation. By this time it was almost 9.30 pm! I would highly advise people not go here. If a restaurant doesn't care about how they treat potential customers, I feel it is a place worth forgetting.....my parents and my group were very disappointed and this hiccup ruined what could have been a perfect reunion dinner!!!", "author": "Lynne B."}

There is always a line of patrons waiting for a table (no reservations-yikes). Since the BF and I were staying at the Huntington Hotel, we walked over to the Nob Hill Caf\u00e9 around 7pm for dinner. The wait was about 15 mins which went by fast since the hostess offers you a drink while you wait. Awesome. Inside there are 2 dining rooms but still a small area. We were seated at a super small table. We shared the brushetta and a salad. Both were so-so. Not the best and not the worst. I chose to have the Linguine Vongole while the BF had the pistavchio encrusted mahi mahi special. My lingine was a bit too \"lemon-y\". They must have overdid it with the lemon juice or something because that was all I tasted. The BF's dish was a lot better. Tasted more healthy and fresh. The mahi mahi came with a side of rice with asparagus tossed in. I should have gotten that instead because it was yummy. The service is a bit strange here. Not that he didn't pay attention to us but it seemed like there was only 1 waiter for the entire joint. I also felt like we were rushed. Everything was given super quickly. But I guess with that line outside, they need to get you in and out. \n\nNot sure if the wait was worth it but maybe I'll have to try it again to really tell whether I like it or not.", "author": "Katie Anne N."}

She sat us outside to wait, got us some drinks, and was super friendly and personable. After about 20 minutes, we had a small table in a comically tiny nook near the kitchen. Good thing I love sitting really close to the table. \n\nI ordered the chicken parmesan, which was good, really. BUT, my boyfriend ordered the special: farfalle with shrimp, salmon, and calamari in a lobster bisque sauce. After tasting his dish, I spent the rest of my meal looking disappointedly at my plate while stealing as much off his plate as possible. After that, I was so stuffed that I couldn't possibly eat another bite, except half of an awesome tiramisu. \n\nMy only complaint? Our waiter was off-puttingly brusque. I waited tables for many years, and there's an art to being busy but not making your tables feel like they're bothering you. He didn't have it down, and we barely saw him. However, the service was still good as the bussers kept our table clear and our waters filled, and the kitchen did everything right. You should go here.", "author": "Kristin D."}

The cafe is really small and quaint, which is okay, but I can't imagine this would be much fun during the busy hours. \n\nOne side of the cafe was completely packed and the other side had two people in it. I was seated immediately. \n\nThe waiter/host that seated me was polite but very curt. I have a feeling that it may have something to do with my appearance (I ride a scooter and tend to layer up, so I can look kinda like a hobo sometimes). Despite my smile and friendly demeanor, I received the least amount of hospitality deemed necessary without being outright rude. \n\nI ordered the Angus Beef Carpaccio and a soy latte. The prices are reasonable, and the food presentation was favorably executed. The latte was one of the better ones that I have had in recent memory. \n\nThe decor was pleasant, although I felt cramped. I felt that they were trying to capitalize by cramming as many tables into their tiny little space as legally acceptable (yet I still would NOT want to be in there if a fire should break out). \n\nThe food at this place was very good, my only issue was with the service. Not once did anyone ask how the food was or see if I needed anything. There were so many staff members walking past that I only had but to reach out and ask one if I needed anything, but I kind of feel that someone should at LEAST check on a patron ONCE during the course of the meal, even if it's just a little meal and not a HUGE ticket. \n\nBy the time I got my ticket, I don't think the waiter was even capable of smiling, even when I smiled and said thank you. I wouldn't mind eating here again, just to try something different on their scaled-down menu, but I don't think I'll be going out of my way to go here any time soon.", "author": "Eyva Kid C."}

We arrived at 7:30 and were told the wait was 30 minutes which we thought was no problem (we knew the place didn't take reservations).  We ended up waiting outside for 1 hr 15 mins to sit at 8:45.  We sit and immediately order, explaining that our friends need to leave by 9:20.  They said, no problem, they could easily get our food to us with time for them to leave by then.  At 9:20 our food hadn't come yet, so we had to get theirs to go... and they didn't even apologize -- they said, \"Oh, you guys got stuck behind a to-go order.\"  \n\nFunny thing was we saw the people ordering to-go, and it came in AFTER we sat down and ordered -- it was totally their fault for putting the order ahead of us, ESPECIALLY when we explained we were in a hurry because of THEIR poor estimation of the wait for us to be seated.  The whole problem would have been solved if they just told us in advance that the wait was going to be over an hour, then we could have gone elsewhere.

I had the veal piccata and it was a huge piece of not tender veal -- not pounded thin, and a little tough.  Hmmm.  The service was excellent though, and the waitress took all of our orders by memory -- good trick.  The noise level was great though and it was difficult to hear across the table with the din.

I would say that if you live close by or happen to be in the neighborhood, it's worth a trip. Definitely no need to go out of your way. I am just happy that they are open on Monday nights. I don't understand why all the decent restaurants in North Beach close on Mondays.\n\nI love how it's a small, cute neighborhood restaurant. We had great service the whole night (lots of water refills and a friendly waitress). We started our meal with the bruschetta appetizer. Honestly, nothing to write home about. While there were plenty of fresh tomato pieces, I just happen to like my bruschetta more when the topping has been marinating in olive oil, salt, and garlic. Instead the bread was toasted with olive oil and garlic and then it was lots of fresh tomatoes cubed with some basil. I am not an Italian expert and maybe this is more authentic bruschetta... I just know my own preferences. Also, I was sad that there were only 2 slices for $5.50. \n\nI had the gnocchi with meat sauce and I enjoyed it but just found it heavy. The sauce was a tomato based sauce and flavorwise, everything worked. But you have heavy potato pasta with heavy meat sauce... and it's a lot. Portions were decent and not itty bitty. Also, I would have liked it if the gnocchi was a bit smaller (like half the size that they were). It was just a lot to put in your mouth (insert that's what she said joke... cause I know that's what plenty of you are thinking).\n\nPizzas are small and customizable but I like that they don't skimp on the toppings (lots of cheese) and the pizza is nice and crispy.

We ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table. It was definitely a long wait, but they they served you wine and drinks while you were waiting which was a plus and there were some tables to wait and sit at while you were waiting. I'd say it was worth it! (they were people waiting all night till closing) Once we got seated. We were served fresh bread and butter- delicious! I could not decided what I wanted pizza sounded good but I was really craving clam pizza with white sauce. I decided to ask the waitress if they could make it for me and they did! I was extremely happy about that. And to top it off. It was AMAZING. One of the best clam pizzas I've ever had. It was the perfect balance of creamy to salty. Yummm! My boyfriend got the sausage gnocchi and enjoyed it too. He was able to finish his and sneak a couple pieces of my pizza too. Service was great! Food was great!

It's located off the beaten path in a nice neighborhood in Nob Hill. Parking was a bit of a challenge, and we had to walk a bit, but nothing major.\n\nUpon entering, you'll find a cute little place that is appealing but small. We felt a little cramped at the table we were at, and as it was the main entrance, the cascade of people coming in kept walking past our table. Our waitress was very nice, explained the menu very well, and was attentive all of the time we were there.\n\nThe garlic bread was a small portion and did not stand out. It was slightly over done, but not really burnt.\n\nFor dinner, my kids had the chicken parmigiana, and I had a specialty pizza off the daily menu. My kids love this menu item and normally get this at Italian joints. They were OK with it, but felt that the taste was different and although ate it, were slightly disappointed. They described the flavor as a bit too sweet for their liking - assuming the sauce was a special one used by the restaurant.\n\nMy pizza though was very good. Very light crust (tiny bit burnt - but OK for me), nice toppings, and very flavorful.\n\nOverall, I say it's average. If you are in the area and want a nice Italian place, go! I think you'll come out satisfied. I am not sure I would seek it out again if I were on vacation in SF though.", "author": "Arthur H."}

And that is the two blocks that lead you to the nice part of town and not our usual two blocks to the TL.\n\nAs said before this place is about a block from Grace Cathedral at the proverbial top of nob hill, so the atmosphere is great. What is probably not so great is that it is the size of a postage stamp (and not those ginormous stamps you get from the nature conservancy, as if they worried about the forest!!) and they do not accept reservations. So pack a coat and get ready to wait. \n\nOnce inside the service was fine for me and my wife. I ordered the pesto tortelini, while wifey got the angel hair pasta. My dish was just about perfect for a pesto, not too oily, not too salty. My wife's 'angel hair' was really spaghetti but little did they know that this is actually what she wanted. Spaghetti or angel hair aside, the tomato/garlic/olive-oil combo sauce had all of the flavor that my wife could want.

There was a 30 minute wait, but they had seating outside for everyone. While I was waiting, the hostess gave me a wine menu and took a drink order. Mmm, a nice sauvignon blanc to help pass the time! Before I could finish, a table was ready and she carried the glass for me to my table.\n\nI was greeted by a blonde server with an Irish accent who was very friendly. I ordered the Gnocchi Bolognese. I asked my server a good wine to go with the gnocchi (I had heard a lot about it), and she told me both the typical red wine pairing and her recommendation, the Valpolicella, a good alternative red wine that also happened to be her favorite. She poured me a swig so I could sample it, and I chose the Valpolicella. A server brought some bread that was freshly baked and helped tide me over until the main course arrived.\n\nI must say, when you take that first bite of the gnocchi, you will know you made the right decision. It just melts in your mouth, and the pomodoro sauce with Italian fennel seed sausage and ground beef is extremely delicious! The gnocchi goes well with the Valpolicella wine. There is a lot on the plate, but take your time, as you will enjoy the last bite as much as the first (and even use the bread to get the remaining sauce off the plate).\n\nI was so impressed with the flavor and texture of the gnocchi that I even asked my server if she could ask the chef exactly how it is made. She came back a few minutes later and told me that it takes a long time to perfect the technique (that just means I will have a good challenge when I try to learn how to make it). I appreciated that she took the time to ask. When it came time to paying the bill, I did not feel rushed at all.\n\nMy advice on this restaurant: \n- Make sure someone orders the Gnocchi Bolognese (and make sure they share it!)\n- Come here if you like to take your time to enjoy your food. Do not come here if you are on a time crunch.\n- Be prepared to wait for a table, as the place fills up fast and they do not take reservations.\n\nTo sum up my visit: I was very impressed with my experience, from the friendly service to the lively atmosphere to the delicious food.

Two of us ordered the Gnocchi Bolognese and the other ordered the seafood pasta, which was a special that night.  We also got a Sangiovese, which was actually a blend.  It's something that should have been noted on the menu.\n\nThe food came quickly - too quickly.  The gnocchi was too soft, and the sauce was just okay.  The tiny chunks of sausage in the sauce had no flavor.  It was obvious that the sauce and gnocchi was pre-cooked and had been heated up.\n\nThe seafood pasta consisted of a cream sauce with shrimp and calamari, but it was mostly pasta and little seafood.  The menu said there was lobster in it, but there was none.  The shrimp was fresh and sweet, but the sauce was pretty bland.  It wasn't worth $19.  The only positive thing about this dish was the fact that it was cooked to order.  Maybe that's why it was a 'special'.\n\nThe waitress was in a hurry to get rid of us despite our whole meal lasting no more than 1 hour.  If you've ever worked at a restaurant, this is what you call a \"turn 'em and burn 'em\" establishment.  First in, first out - eat your food, pay, now get out.\n\nDon't believe the hype.

The service was really good on a busy night, and their bread basket is actually really good (I love bread, so the bread basket at a restauraunt is actually really important).\n\nWe had the beef carpaccio, the gnocchi with fennel sausage ragu, and the petrale sole, a glass of wine and tiramisu, which ran us about $60, which isn't too bad.\n\nNow onto the food.\n\nThe carpaccio was ok, not great, but not horrible either. It needed a little more red onion, some salt, some more shaved parmesean, and none of that weird sauce they drizzle over the top. I'm a purist, so olive oil is better for me on carpaccio as opposed to something that looks like a caesar dressing with saraccha hot sauce mixed in.\n\nThe gnocchi was pretty good, a little too soft for my taste as I prefer my gnocchi with a little more bite to it, as otherwise it's just mush meets mushy ragu-sauce. The fennel sausage didn't really come out as much as I had hoped, but it was still pretty solid.\n\nThe sole. Ahhh...memories of that dish still linger in my thoughts today. Way better, in my humble opinon than that at another place called Beretta, it was perfectly cooked, not too dry, with an amazing lemon butter caper sauce, some perfectly cooked penne pasta, and some snap peas. What prevents me from giving this place a full 5 stars, is the fact that I found some little fish bones in a small part of the filet, which is not so fun when you're otherwise enjoying a perfect dish.\n\nDessert was tiramisu, which is a good old fashioned standby in italian places, it was good here, but not great.\n\nPros: Great food, decent prices, Good bread.\n\nCons: Spacing is really tight, and bones in a filet of fish is never a good sign.", "author": "David H."}

We got there right a 5:00 because we had a 7:00 show to catch. There was no wait but the place was filling up quick. To be honest, this little romantic dinner is what made our trip. Very romantic.

Cute little whole in the wall restaurant.  Walking in with a group of six I was immediately a little apprehensive not sure how we were all going to fit at a table, it was that small.  The staff immediately told us that we could not sit until our whole party was here (we were missing 2 people who were minutes behind us, didn't matter).  Normally I'd take away a star for this first negative encounter, but luckily once we sat down (all of us there of course!) the waitress was actually pretty friendly and did a good job.  Food was amazing!  Luckily my family is pretty generous and we all pick off each others plates and I got to try many of their dishes.  Top recommendations: the polenta appetizer, the gnocchi, and the calamari steak.  Food was all pretty reasonably priced, add a few bottles of prosecco you are looking at little heftier of a tab, but worth it for a great experience.  There's a lot of good places to eat in the city so I don't know if I'll rush back here, but if I'm ever in the area I'll definitely pay this place a visit.", "author": "Hanna C."}

It's no wonder this place is frequented by the famous San Francisco twins every Friday night.  The rest of us peons wait at least 45 minutes for our table while the twins walk in to a restaurant packed with patrons who part like the Red Sea when these two enter and hold court.  This just adds to the charm of the Nob Hill Cafe.  \n\nFilet of sole in white wine sauce and the evening's special lobster ravioli in a buttery cream sauce were perfect with our glass of sparkling prosecco.  The table next to us though, well-intended as they are, got up to leave, looked over at us and said, \"We have this leftover Chianti.  Want it?  It's really good!\"  Apparently, this man took Pru's \"Ummmmm....\"  to mean \"Yes!  Absolutely!  We are vagrants down to our last few dollars and have only enough for our meal so, yes, please--pretty please--grace us with your leftover booze.\"  Without so much as waiting for a response, he placed his 1/4 filled bottle of wine in the center of our table and walked out.  Odd and slightly uncouth for these parts, but it didn't take away from our evening and experience at the Nob Hill Cafe.\n\nIt was, however, worthy of a mention here on Yelp.

Just look at everything from the tables when you sit down to the floors, light switch plates (filthy black) and watching how they handled the bread baskets etc. On to the food- the salad was fine (hard to mess up that) but the bruschetta was terrible. The toasted bread was burnt (BLACK char) which they knew about and placed that side down. Topped with flavorless tomatoes and way too large pieces of basil thrown on, it really was poorly put together and nearly inedible. The lasagne tasted fine. The fennel meat was okay but the sauce could really use some help. Same sauce of course on the eggplant Parmesan. I am really dismayed at the penne they served with the eggplant. The pasta they use is not- the pasta bought at Safeway cooked at home tasted fresher than this pasta. Add lukewarm service (a little attitude from one server) and this place is a disaster. I really don't know where the 4 star review average comes from. What a bust.", "author": "Piper W."}

Most of the time, my meal selection borders on orgasmically divine. Last night - went with the pizza with pepperoni, onion, spinach and garlic (i know, not a great Valentine's date meal idea for breath purposes, but my girl loves me, so THERE!). Pizza, as always, was amazing - thin crust pizza, the crust so fluffy, perfect for dipping in my girl's sauce (not like that, dirty person, i mean in her gnocchi sauce...and no, \"gnocchi\" is not some slang word for lady parts, sheesh!!!). My fiancee/valentine's date had the gnocchi bettola (on the menu as gnocchi bolognese, but ask for the bettola sauce instead). Instead of describing what she thought of her food, I'll just tell u this - we hopped in a cab and were halfway (or $6 in on the meter) home before we realized we forgot her leftovers at the restaurant. she promptly had the cabbie turn around and return to the restaurant even though we had shut down the restaurant - she was willing to pay the extra cab fare out of her own pocket on the off chance that they did not toss our food, just so she could eat her leftovers the next day for lunch! \n\nPrices - very reasonable. Had two entrees and a bottle of sangiovese for just under $60 pre-tip. Moreover, the portions are big, so oftentimes, you're left with leftovers in the form of another small meal the next day.\n\nAmbiance - VERY small restaurant, you basically feel like you are in someone's home while they cook italian food and serve you dinner. Because the space is so small yet always crowded, it always feels so warm and cozy inside. I'm not italian, but my guess is, if I was, I would think to myself that going to Nob Hill Cafe takes me back to my childhood when nona would be in the kitchen cooking my favorite dish, telling me stories about our homeland...while she poured me some wine (I was a budding alcoholic as a kid, what can i say).", "author": "Julian M."}

I love Italian food, but don't go very often because I work at a restaurant where we make all our pasta from scratch; it's hard to top that. But Nob Hill Cafe did.\n\nAmbiance: Cute, neighborhood feel. We could tell there were a lot of regulars, but for a newcomer, expect that it is cozy -- ie: small, and you're close to your neighbor, but we thought it was intimate.\n\nService: Though it took a little while for our server to get around to us, I realized she was waiting on the entire room and so cut her a little slack (as you should, because most places have 4 table sections rather than 7). But once she visited us, we were taken care of all night in a timely manner. She was incredibly informative, patient, and obliging, as I had some questions. She wasn't afraid to offer suggestions which I appreciate in a server. Especially after reading some of the other reviews, if we go back, I will be asking for the blonde server. \n\nFood:The wine list is small for SF but there seemed to be some good Italians and some standard Californias. We tried the Valpolicella and it was excellent, incredibly smooth and rich.\nThe rosemary bread to start was incredible. We ordered the special Waldorf pizza (gorgonzola, spinach, pear, and chicken -- yes please!) as our appetizer, ate about half and took the rest home. It ended up being the perfect amount for lunch. \nHe had the Carbonara and it was PERFECT. \nI ordered the Gnocchi Bolognese, partially because I heard the server tell another table that it was homemade. It was the best gnocchi I have ever had in my life. They literally melted in my mouth. Next time I'm thinking I will try them with another sauce, which our server said is very easy to do. I suppose that's the benefit of coming to a place where everything is made to order.\nFor dessert I tried the tiramisu, which the only thing I would say was pretty standard. You can certainly taste the alcohol, and it is a little on the fluffier side, though I prefer that. It was good, just not outstanding like everything else. \nNow, as far as outstanding desserts, you have to the try gelato/cheescake combo. They layer gelato on top of cheesecake and top it with homemade whip. We tried the pumpkin Grand Mariner and it was phenomonal. They offer it in multiple flavors though and so we will certainly be back, even if solely for the dessert... and gnocchi.", "author": "Bridgette M."}

A little heavy on the cilantro but we were happy with our choice. \n\nEntrees- Lack luster at best. We had the eggplan parm adn the lasagna, nothing special and we could certianly make something as good at home. \n\nThe entertainment factor was key however, we got to listen to the hostess all night. She was quite stressed out, understandable as managing a waitlist for 14 tables can be quite a challenge..... She inadequately handled several situations during our dinner and she consistently offered a \"20 minute wait\" to all those entering to be put on the list. \n\nI wish their entrees were as exacting as the special we ordered.

We ordered the carpaccio ($10) to start-- REALLY delicious. I ordered the pasta with pancetta and cream sauce which was really delish. Mine was a pretty hefty portion and I was only able to eat about half of it. Great if you want leftovers, or maybe go family style and share the dishes you order.

We were tired, hungry and unsure where to go.  Yelp steered us in the direction of Nob Hill which was not too far from where we were staying.  \n\nThere will be a wait.  Other reviewers mentioned it, so we expected it.  They gave us an estimation of 45minutes, and they were just about right on.  They offered beer or wine, which we didn't take them up on at first.  They were very busy, and the hostess was running all over the place, but she managed it very well and was quite pleasant.\n\nUpon being seated in the little cafe, our waiter came over to chat and check on us, take beverage orders, etc.  We asked for a wine recommendation (wife is not a huge wine fan, but likes certain types).  We asked what he thought and he recommended a Saugv Blanc that ended up being *perfect*.  Great help on the wine selection.  We ordered a bottle and moved on.  \n\nThe bread on the table was quite good, and helped to quench our hunger while we waiting on entrees.\n\nThe basic pizza was fantastic - great tasting sauce, simple yet tasty crust.  Just exactly what we were looking for.  They also recommended a penne dish that was equally fantastic.   Again, the waiter's recommendations were spot on from start to finish.  \n\nWe sat and enjoyed the meal, enjoyed our wine and just sat and talked.  By the time we were done and ready to leave, there was hardly anyone left in the restaurant.  Not once did we feel rushed out or anything.  Even after paying the bill, the server came and offered anything else we could want, refills on water, etc.  Service was, from start to finish, excellent.\n\nCan't wait to return to SF, if only for Nob Hill Cafe!", "author": "Chris B."}

I arrive before the rest of my party and sat out front at one of the nice little tables. Blonde children came with their blonde parents. Not-quite-natural middle aged blonde women in semi-fancy but oh-so-casual expensive clothes feigned excitement at seeing each other and almost touched while faux kissing each other. The regular occupying a primo table in the window nursed his pizza like a broke sailor salting his beer. His solo dining experienced lasted more than an hour while crowds gathered in expectation of being shown to a table before nightfall.\n\nThe host called my name while there were just 2 of the 3 of us present, so we had to wait. This would have been fine if we had been put at a table for four, but we were squeezed into a table for 2. Not sure why 2 of us couldn't have hunkered there just as well.\n\nThe bruchetta was well prepared on crispy bread with copious garlic and basil but the tomatoes were tasteless. I can't blame them for that though: don't order uncooked tomatoes in early spring. Those suckers aren't ready yet.\n\nOne guests eggplant was \"bitter\". The other guest very much enjoyed the waldorf salad pizza , one of the chalkboard specials. My linguine with olive oil and garlic was good and not overpriced at $9. Service was attentive but the waitress politely demured when asked for suggestions.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-04-14", "description": "Last night, my lady and I were looking for a place to get a good meal that wasn't too far from the house or expensive and having passed NHC on several occasions we decided to give them a call.  The wait was only about 15-25 minutes so we grabbed a bottle of Frank Family Cab and walked on over.  \n\nI stepped the door and put our name in and the hostess immediately asked if she could open our bottle and bring us some wine glasses outside to the tables while we waited, and this was, unfortunately, where the good service ended.  Drinking our cab outside, we noticed a pair of old twin ladies dressed in identical red cowgirl outfits sitting in the window.  The hostess informed us that this creepy pair liked to dine their twice a week and warned us not to get too close lest we get trapped in a 45 minute conversation about nothing.\n\nThe wait wasn't too bad.  The inside was a little cramped but charming in its own sort of neighborhoody kind of way.  I don't really mind places that don't take reservations, it can actually be a good change of pace.  We sat down and they brought us bread.  The Foccacio was really good.  I started with the carpaccio drizzled in a mustard sauce, capers and lemon.  My girlfriend had the roasted roma tomato and eggplant salad which also featured mounds of slightly cooked feta.  The carpaccio was good and even better when paired with the bread and some of the salad.  The melanzane salad was one of the better parts of the meal and I like carpaccio (the quality of the beef was pretty good) with some greens to lighten it up a little bit.\n\nWhich brings us to dinner.  Because I would literally say that the span between the time they picked up our appetizers and put down our bowls of pasta couldn't have been more than about 30-45 seconds.  This and the fact that the waiter probably hadn't said more than about six words to us up to that point is ultimately what hurt NHC most.  \n\nThe food, though, was pretty good.  My girlfriend got a penne with spicy pomodoro sauce that was actually very flavorful.  I had the spaghetti alla carbonara.  It was an excellent pasta dish.  The romano and butter that coated the spaghetti was rich and delicious and the pancetta added a delicious salty component.  It was finished with some parsley to add some herb influence.  I highly recommend this as long as you feel like indulging yourself.  \n\nTo sum up the rating, the prices and $15 corking fee were very reasonable.  The apps and the spaghetti were all great but not incredible by any stretch.  Ultimately, it was probably the service that kept them from going any higher, but I would recommend giving it a shot.

Since the car was already parked in a garage and I didn't have a pocketful of change to re-park in another, undoubtedly metered, area, I decided to take a walk around the area (or at least the small area that I could walk without having to endure an 85 degree incline) and see what it had to offer. \n\nI passed the Nob Hill Cafe a couple of times, but not being in the mood for Italian, kept walking. Since I didn't find much else, I decided to check yelp mobile and see how this Nob Hill Cafe rated. 4 stars? Okay, I shouldn't be disappointed at least, so I decided to give it a try. \n\nAfter being seated, I glance up at the specials board and see one of the offerings is Seafood Lasagna. Prawns, calamari and scallops in a lobster bisque sauce, topped with mozzarella. Sounds different, sounds good, let's go for it. \n\nUpon first taste, i wasn't overly impressed. Good, but definitely not great. As i went deeper into the dish, I must admit that it got better. I found some surprise lump crab meat which wasn't mentioned in the description, but was a nice surprise as far as I'm concerned. Had I not liked crab, that may have been a problem, but thankfully I do. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice and the service was quick, but the waitress was kind of surly. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say it was a bad day. \n\nOverall, it wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about either.

Suffice it to say, I was feeling a little fragile.\n\nAnd the day was beautiful.  Nearby Huntington Park was crisp and humming with local artists' displays and children under the clear blue sky you rarely find in San Francisco except on a postcard.  And I was ready for some breakfast lovin'.  As I stood on the emotional precipice of this potentially dark moment, I was ready for the one thing in the world that would make me feel like a human being, the redemption from a night of lascivious extravagance and the impending doldrum of another grinding workweek.\n\nI wanted breakfast.  I wanted it piping hot.  I wanted it quickly.  I wanted a quiet place with the soft tinkling of serving ware and the classy notes of a rich wood gramophone or musicbox.  I wanted a newspaper.  I wanted coffee so hot and black as to blister my tongue and burn away to coldness of my soul.  I wanted a beautiful face across the table (Christ, at least I had that) and a newspaper and not to think about one sorry dirty dish.\n\nAnd we unwittingly arrived at NHC a few minutes before it \"opens\", even though the chairs and tables were out and both sets of doors (I'll come back to this, but what kind of fractured, irreligious monster expects a new patron to figure that one out?) open and those inviting breakfast smells almost visibly creeping out into the street like a Warner Bros. cartoon.\n\nAnd there he was, my nemesis, the all-hating anti-semitic Irish god of destruction that turned us poor supplicants back, without offering even the meager succor of a friendly mien or apologetic explanation of the burdens of opening a fine cafe.\n\nNothing (while my simple mind wrestled with the two doorways, each with a top/bottom half door set-up, the bottom of which I clumsily discovered was locked) but, \n\n\"We are not open.\" (Read: If you try that locked bottom door again you churl I just might kill you.)\n\n\"But, Sir, you appear to be open.\" (Read: Dear God I just want some coffee.)\n\n\"We open at 11.\" (Read: If I wasn't so hopelessly obese I would reach for my grandfather's scimitar I keep behind the breakfast bar to eviscerate you and with your entrails add a bit of \"Jewish\" cuisine to my menu .)\n\n\"What time is it now?\" (Read: I don't think I can make it to 11.)\n\n\"10:53.\" (Read: You will never be welcome.)\n\nAmanda F. and I conferred.  Against my better judgment, we waited in the park and returned at 11:10 to be certain.\n\nQuasimodo sat us down at the window overlooking Taylor St., which was a blessing because it meant my back was to him, sharpening his knives, and the skin-crawling forest green walls of the interior.  Too dark for breakfast, says Amanda F.?  Too dark for anyone who still can't shave all their body hair and run naked through a children's cancer ward screaming, \"We're all gonna die!\"\n\nNo soymilk for my latte (Look, I told you I was feeling fragile).  Only 2%.  Amanda F. hinted I might find the bathroom amusing.  If by amusing she meant an obvious health violation with the close proximity of human defecation to food service hardly separated by a a vinyl draw, not to mention that only Gary Cooper would find it spacious.\n\n I was ready to leave.  Why did I not? The calming tones of Amanda F. telling me to stop being a jackass.\n\nOk.  So we ate.  The food was impeccable.  Omelet, hot and steamy with fresh white cheese and ingredients all high-quality.  I disagree with Amanda F. on the coffee which I found unremarkable but fine.  For its location and quality it was not overpriced and we were served our food promptly.\n\nWho the hell cares?  I didn't go there for the food or the cost.  I went there because there was something missing inside of me that I desperately needed to find in the embrace of a warm meal delivered with care.  With care, as in, \"I care that you are not feeling well\" or \"Let me take care of you when you are feeling like you just had a visectomy.\"\n\nThat bastard stole something from me and I can never have that morning back.\n\nThink about that next time \"Snob Hill Cafe\" sends out an inviting vibe.  Think about your insides ripped out and twisted and squeezed and charbroiled in front of you and then fed to starving baby birds.\n\nThen ask yourself if a goddamn good omelet is worth it.", "author": "Donny S."}

This equates to some very chilly, windy nights when you have to wait for a table. And since they don't take reservations, you can plan on doing a lot of waiting.  My advice?  Bring someone who is sure to provide witty banter. Or if you can't find anyone to keep your mind off the wait and potentially the chilly air, pack a crossword puzzle.  That way you'll have a side of good old fashioned fun to go along wtih your penne.", "author": "Whitney H."}

This is mainly an Italian type place, and it definitely has good food.  It isn't too expensive, especially considering you're in San Francisco, where I'm convinced the word \"cheap\" doesn't exist.  I had the gnocchi pasta which was very good.  Not wonderful, but very good.  My wife had another pasta dish which she liked.  There are only a couple things I didn't like about this place.  First, the place is very small and is very busy.  There is no place to stand inside and wait for your table.  Secondly, you are forced to sit outside at these patio type tables while waiting for your table.  This would not be a big deal, except for the fact that in San Francisco in the evening it gets quite chilly.  My wife and I waited for a good 20 minutes and were freezing our butts off by the time we got inside.  Overall, this place is good, but the waiting outside in the cold gives it 4 stars from me.", "author": "Derek H."}

It's only a block from where I live, and there's no better place in the city to go for an amazing breakfast.  They don't open until 11, but it's worth the wait.  Their french toast is to die for, covered in powdered sugar, fresh strawberries and raspberries.  I always end up eating half of someone else's if they order it.  Their shrimp and avocado omelet is also good if you don't like a sweet breakfast.  With perfect outdoor seating, great hot chocolate and delicious mimosas, the Nob Hill Cafe is breakfast heaven.\n\nWhen my friend recently broke up with her boyfriend, I suggested the Nob Hill Cafe for dinner.  The wait was about a half hour, but since I'm only a block away we went back to my place an had some wine while waiting.  Since their wait time isn't always what they say it is, I called while at my place and they told me exactly when to come in.  We sat at a cute little table inside and had a fresh Caprice salad, good Chianti and she had a sausage pizza while I tried the lasagna- they all were all perfect.  My friend's mind was off her split and we had a great time chowing down.\n\nBottom line: try this place if you're in the middle of the city and want something quieter.

I wouldn't imagine coming here with more than 3-4 people, you would take up the whole place!\n\nSince we heard through the grapevine that you should try a pizza and pasta we did just that. We both were impressed by the fresh bread that came first...  I am however always a sucker for a good slice (or two). Next, we got the house Margarita pizza. It was very cheesy and simple. A great staple dish to start off the first half of our meal. Next was the gnocchi, which the waitress explained was homemade. It was so different than other gnocchi I have had. Probably because it was just made. It has a meat sauce and I cleared my plate. \n\nThe atmosphere was cozy and warm.

I don't know whether it was a change in management or what, but they began playing music loudly throughout the week nights - sometimes until 2am.  I asked nicely if they would please turn the volume down a touch after 10pm.  I was met with resistance, the owner denying that it was them, despite their speakers being mounted on their ceiling, which is my bedroom floor.  This issue became so bad that I was unable to sleep some nights and was awakened by the cleaning crew at odd hours, including 4-6am on a Tuesday.  \n\nThe building owners repeatedly spoke to the Cafe owner, whose name I'm debating mentioning, and she kept claiming that it wasn't the cafe breaking the noise ordinance.  \n\nHere I am, 22 months later, same situation, no change.  The last 2 times I called to beg them to just turn down the volume so I can sleep, I was met with attitude by the hostess, who argued with me and had the gaul to tell me they are allowed to play the music as loud as they want until the last customer leaves.  \n\nI've lived above other places of business in SF before now, and have never been met with such disrespect and attitude.

The sausage and eggs were a nice addition.  This is a large portion, and I ended up eating about 1/3 and giving the rest to a homeless gentleman outside.  For the $12 or so this cost, the size of this pizza made this a very good value.\n\nThe interior is Italian-cafe like, with mismatched decorations and small cafe tables.

For the main dish, I ordered the Tortellini Romana with the romana cream sauce ($11.50) and my boyfriend chose the Gnocchi Bologonese ($13.75). Both dishes were fantastic, my Tortellini was well prepared with rich, creamy sauce. My boyfriend's was just as good, the savory potato dumplings perfectly complementing the meat sauce.\n\nThe atmosphere presented by Nob Hill Cafe was just as refreshing as the food. Filled with couples, families, and friends of the owner- the cafe has a vibe of friendship and community.

The flavors are great and mostly authenic- I think it is one of the better deals in the area, with all entrees between $10-20.

We started with bruschetta which was very nice - garlicky country bread and fresh tomatoes and basil.  One this is that I like my food a bit more on the salty side and needed to add salt.\n\nFor our main course, I had the pizzeta salsicia (their brunch pizza) which has fontina cheese, eggs, and chicken apple sausage.  It was very good.  My husband ordered our typical comfort food - spaghetti carbonara.  Its one of the best carbonaras I have had.  The pasta was al dente and the sauce was amazing.

Jeez, that was a year and a half ago!\n\nAnyway, I came here on a first date, per my date's suggestion [after I suggested meeting in San Francisco, as it was in between both our locations]. Luckily, I left early, because it took me 25 minutes to drive around in circles to find parking before I settled on the Cathedral parking lot. And, hey! I made it there with 5 minutes to spare.\n\nSaid date was waiting graciously outside, sipping on a glass of red wine, which we shared. As the waitstaff had been warned I was due any moment, a table was ready the moment I arrived. We dove in, a bottle of wine, appetizers, and fairly sizeable portions - he the pesto [I think], and me the capellini pomodoro. Again, I think that is what I had. I remember eating red, and he commenting on how he had a nasty habit of spilling red food on his white shirts, which lead me to question his choice in alcohol... We then went on to share tiramisu [I only managed one bite].\n\nAfter that first date, we kept attempting to go back, only venturing there once more together. But, it was just as yummy and just as tightly packed. One exceptionally wonderful thing I would love to point out is that he took some of his friends there once and ordered me dinner to go. A couple hours later, I was handed a box full of veggie lasagne. I ate half of it that night, and the rest the next day. Their leftover veggie lasagne is to die!!\n\nMy little issue I have is the location/parking. Yes, it is San Francisco, and parking is a b*tch. But, if you are driving there, don't. Get BART to Powell, and walk. Who doesn't love a great workout to feel justified in eating yummy food? Or you can just park your car in the cathedral lot [which closes at 11, maybe 12 on weeknights, which lead to some crazy split-second, blood boiling planning on first date night, as we opted to take a drive over the golden gate in his car after dinner].\n\nAnother thing: the bathroom. It's a joke. It's cramped. Too close to the dining area/bar. The \"door\" isn't really a door, just an accordion-style pull thing that latches. Yes, they are pressed for space, but why not build a bathroom out back? At least it's away from the dining area.", "author": "Ellie M."}

The food here is hugely mediocre and I don't understand how its gotten such high ratings on Yelp (are they all tourists??)  Went here on a Sunday night (no reservation, no line) at 7pm and...\n\nPros:\n+ It's on a cute, tree-lined street near some parks, hotels and with scenic views from the top of Nob Hill\n+ the service staff is SUPER nice.  Hostess and waitress were very sweet, busboys were friendly.\n+ It has a homey, friendly but upscale feel to it\n+ Its not super expensive.  Most expensive entree was $20.\n\nCons\n- Food is very mediocre at best.  Went here for dinner and while the Polenta crostini appetizer was delicious and the Tiramisu was tasty, the two entrees we ordered were absolutely TERRIBLE.  We had the chicken parmesan and a mushroom pizza.  Pretty easy to get right, you'd think.  Not here.  The chicken came in a baking pan (like the polenta) but was smothered in cheese.  It was very bland and lacking in flavour and the chef had clearly tried to mask it by throwing a giant blob of parmesan on top (except it tasted like a much cheaper cheese).  If you dig beneath the cheese you get to some really boring chicken and penne.  And the pizza... cmon!  Again, smothered with cheese. Crust was not crispy, not properly cooked either.  Very little flavour, no interesting mushrooms (just a few boring button mushrooms thrown on top), no fresh herbs or anything! And the tomato sauce tasted like it came out of a can of tomatoes.  Yuck.  We could barely eat one slice.\n \n- Another thing to note (I don't know whether you consider this a good or a bad) is that this place is incredibly touristy.  I think all the people riding the Powell St trolley end up here.  They probably think they're escaping the tourist traps of Union Sq.  There's also a LOT of kids (like an average of one at every table).

BUT I did look at every other dish that the other 4 people got and they didn't look to lavish either. My dear friend Ryan did grab the special of the night and it was a weird special for being in an Italian restaurant, Seafood Risotto Jambalaya! BAM! Yea I was going to get it but I was skerred. So he got it and I snuck some off his plate. It was very good. So with that said, I would deff recommend getting the specials, and also would recommend this place to mix it up a bit. There Italian style stuff just seemed to \"Olive Garden\" to me. Sorry Sarah, I know your gunna hate me for that, but the twins will forgive me. (inside joke) Moving on... Bruchetta was good, but I mean ca mon, rinse the tomatoes with balsamic and EVOO before you top that sourdough, love the fresh basil though. \n\n\nOkay it was also last minute on a weekend night for a table for 5, the wait was not long, but after that we were CRAMMED into a small table that usually I think would seat 2 but no worries. It was pretty busy in there and our waiter did wait so much on us. When in doubt just reach over and do things for yourself like we did. \n\nMenu lacked, wine list was OK, service was no bueno, but I had to give it 3 stars because the special for the night was very innovative, edgy and delicious! If there's a line, move on, if there isn't, sit down, cram up and order the special.", "author": "Ryan P."}

The gnocchi seems to be the only fresh pasta they offer. The taste was excellent but I had to send it back because it wasn't hot enough. I also wish it was not sprinkled with whole peppercorns. The atmosphere was cozy and the server was pleasant. One minor issue was the oldies music that was a bit loud for my taste and seemed an odd choice for an Italian restaurant.

The food was goddarn awful.  \n\nMy wife and I wanted to try this place for the longest time because we live in the neighborhood.  So one night, we decided to finally try it.  \n\nFirst and foremost, what's with the sarcasm from the waitress.  We had to flag her down, and she wasn't even all that nice.  Plus, we didn't get her jokes.  I'm a smart mouth and a sarcastic personality, even I didn't get her .  It was extremely obvious that she didn't want to be there.  She did offer exceptional service to the people seated behind us.......\n\nWe ordered a Linguine alla Vologne and the Gnocchi.  The food was disgusting.  The gnocchi was not soft, but had a mushy texture and it was obvious that the sauce was prepared earlier and kept in a warmer.  The linguine itself was ok.  The clams were obviously from a can and tasted like so.  We tried the flan for dessert and it was hard.  I understood the gingery taste of the caramel sauce, but it didn't work with the hard consistency of the flan.  The flan looked like something you get at Safeway.  \n\nGood atmosphere and good wine selection.  Plus, they do not serve dinner outside... only lunch.  What?!!", "author": "Stan V."}

The salad while being my favorite soft mixed greens, the dressing was bland and no vinagrete or balsamic at an italian place? that's weird. It was only ok. \nThe lasagna was good, extra extra saucy. The bread, just ok. \nThe servings sizes were pretty small so we'll remember that for next time. \nI'm sure eating in would give it an extra star as the ambiance seems nice.

I tell the guys next to me, only two guys, sitting at a table of 4, if it was okay to switch with them when my friend arrived.. and they said no problem. When my friend came, the blonde Irish waitress makes a HUGE SCENE, tells my friend frantically \"Excuse me, stay outside! You just entered in the middle of an ARGUMENT!\" She gets really red and angry and tells me that I didn't follow the \"rules of the restaurant\", gives me the card voluntarily of the manager and tells me that I should leave because \"[I] won't be happy here.\"  People around me were looking and thinking, \"what the hell is wrong with this waitress...?!\" I was so shaken by her attitude and her voice that my hands were trembling and me and my friend left the restaurant.

My g/f ordered the Fedellini alla Cecca- a 3 out of 5, nothing special. I ordered the Spaghetti alla Carbonara- a 5 out of 5. WOW this dish was amazing. My g/f ate more off my plate than her own.

This place does not take reservations so expect to wait outside sometimes for as much as forty five minutes, but it is well worth the wait and the hostess will gladly let you indulge on a glass of wine (or a few ) as you do so. I recommend coming here for lunch on a sunny day when the crowd is less bustling so you can soak up some rays while feasting on this venues' fabulous food. \n\nMy meal attack plan~\n     Appetizer: Fresh Bruschetta on the lighter days or on the \"I'm so hungry I could eat a horse\" days the mouth watering grilled polenta with home made marinara and fresh basil, MMMMmmm! I don't usually like polenta but this one is on a whole other scale of fabulousness!\n     Main Course: For a luncheon I usually order one of their thin crust New York style  pizza's (which you can order with any variety of toppings to suit your fancy, but the simplicity of the pizza Margherita is superb) or their calzone which could feed two. Order a side of their marinara so you can dip your pizza or calzone in it, so good! For dinner you HAVE, I repeat HAVE!!! to order the Gnocchi Bolognese! I thought their regular marinara sauce was mouth watering until I tried their home made Bolognese sauce and nearly licked my plate clean! The Gnocchi is freshly made the day of and is tender, not chewy like most pre-packaged gnocchi's in restaurants now days. I always accompany every meal with either a glass of their Riff Pinot Grigio or an ice cold Peroni, so refreshing.\n     Dessert: If I have left an ounce of room for dessert I usually order the Tiramisu and a shot of espresso. The Tirimisu is again, made fresh daily and they use an exceptional quality of ricotta. They serve Illy coffee which finishes off any meal exceptionally!\n\nPricing is moderate depending on what you order. The wait staff is very friendly and informative, although can be a tad slow to get your order in due to the mass amount of patrons that visit this venue.

Had lasagna last Sunday which had potential but was overly salty and not hot all the way through. Sent it back and it returned bubbly hot. Last time my girlfriend has a penne pasta with lamb sausage that was to die for, one of the best Italian dishes I've ever tasted. The hostess is cool and not very welcoming. The server was friendly but disappeared for long stretches. Wine list is ok but limited - you can bring your own and have them uncork it for $15 but they only have those little Italian wine glasses, not big goblets that let a fine wine open up.\n\nOverall this is a classic SF place: small, cozy with occasionally great food, but frustrating in the end because it doesn't consistently live up to its potential. And the lukewarm hostess makes you feel like they're doing you a favor rather than appreciating that you're patronizing their restaurant. But if remains popular because there are few options in the neighborhood for casual dining with good food.", "author": "Michael S."}

It comes across much more as a neighborhood restaurant, and the prices are not excessive. \n\nWe've been there 2-3 times, and the food is good, solid food.  It's also one of the few places we've been able to score whole roasted garlic cloves.  Drizzled with olive oil, this stuff is milder than you would think, but you will still smell like garlic for days, because it'll be coming out of your pores.\n\nA couple glasses of wine at a small table near the window, and you have the perfect getaway.  It was rumored that the famous San Francisco Twins-- elderly twin ladies who always dressed in exactly the same outfits in public-- were regulars here.\n\nI'd give it 5 stars, but what with so many other great restaurants in SF, it if were *that* good, we would've been back already.", "author": "Dave N."}

It's located in the rather quiet Taylor st with a cozy feel inside. The dim light, the small space, the cute decoration, it almost makes you feel you have just wander into some hidden restaurant in the streets of Italy. It's just what you need for a peaceful weekday night. The gnocchi is great, their gnocchi is well made with the right chewy and firm texture, and the classic combination with tomato sauce makes it heavenly. I returned last week on a not so busy night for carbonara. That was just ok, and it certainly didn't stand out at all from other Italian places.  We also had eggplant parm which was below mediocre. Regarding the staff, first time when we were there, super friendly, but last time was with a grumpy big man who seemed unsatisfied with his job and managed to show it all on his face, and he was simply clumsy as a waiter with a lot of bumping onto you or the table. With the last remark, I am gonna give it an overall of 3 star but otherwise 4 star for its gnocchi and ambiance.", "author": "Fung S. O."}

Now I'm sitting near the oven, and I watch about 2 dozen pizzas come out.  NONE comes to our table.  We asked the manager and he keeps saying, \"just a few minutes.\"  After about 25 minutes, my pizza comes out.  I asked him why he didn't put my order in front of all the others and he says, \"Oh, they had their orders in already.\"  \"Yeah, but I ordered first!\"  So he says, \"Uh-huh.\"  Like, call someone who gives a shit.\n\nNow I've been in situations like this before, and I just expected them to take the lousy 10 bucks off of the menu.

The sliders (egg, sausage, cheese) are yummy but try to share them if you can b/c having 3 might be too greasy for you. Their eggs benedict w/salmon was pretty good, the egg cooked just as I had asked for it (soft).\n\nHad dinner here recently for the first time & had mixed reviews. Service was a little slow but I think there was only one cook & one waiter for the whole place! Had the beet salad w/tomatoes, greens, & goat cheese croquettes which was very good. Split the vegetarian cannoli & the crepes were so thin they were barely existent, so don't order it if you are expecting pasta -- it was good filling but practically eating all filling & crepe. Also split the stuffed burger (portobello & brie) which was okay but a little dry. The sweet potato fries were very good.\n\nGood customer service though -- when we commented that the canneloni wasn't what we expected, our waiter took off one of salads from the bill. Very responsive.\n\nWill definitely eat here again (& again). It's a neighborhood joint & apparently they change menus seasonally so should have new options coming soon", "author": "D L."}

We sat at a table right by the open kitchen and watched the chefs work.  It was the quietest kitchen, with everyone working in sync.  We started with the caprese salad, and it was large enough for us to split.  The tomatoes and mozzarella were very fresh.  I had the special of the evening, farfalle pasta with lobster sauce and calimari, prawns, and smoked salmon.  The sauce was a little rich for my taste, but still very good.  My husband had linguine with a garlic olive oil sauce.  He ate every bite!  We really enjoyed our dinner here.  The service was very good and our waitress was attentive without being overbearing.  She also get our water glasses full, which is a big deal for my husband!  Overall, we would definitely eat here again for the homestyle Italian food and friendly atmosphere.", "author": "Lauren H."}

Nob Hill Cafe truly is an incredible restaurant, in fact  I almost don't want you to go there because then I'll have to wait longer for a table next time I go.

It's been a few years since I've been and tonight I thought I'd try it again, and was I glad I did.\nIt's small and cozy and there is almost always a wait, but the best places do have waits, it's a fact of life, even in the recession.\nOnce you get a table the service isn't spectacular, but it's sufficient. The food though, can be outstanding, even to the very picky.\nWe started with the beet salad. The wife loved it, and I thought it was pretty good. On to the main course, which was served at the same time for both of us, a nice touch. I had the filet of sole and she had a pizza. My soul has never known better sole, really. It was exploding in lemony, capery, creamy, hot bliss. Utterly fantastic. The sides of green beans and pasta were equally delish. The wife absolutely loved her pie, which is not an easy rating to obtain outside of NYC for her, so I am slightly over the moon about this fact. I only hope it lasts. \nI'll be coming back soon. It's two blocks from my abode so there is no excuse. Good times, great food and you can even see the lipstick twins in there (I swear they were in there every time I went in there years ago and sure enough they were in there again tonight - do they eat every meal there or what?).

It looks charming/adorable, has a fabulous location and lovely-sounding menu. I had not been in many years (cannot remember why but probably because the food never was memorable). I decided to take two women friends here who had never been.  They don't take reservations but we arrived early (6:00 p.m.) and many tables were open.  The waitress was courteous and the menu sounded good. We ordered. The waitress wrote down the order of both of my friends wrong which resulted in a delay (after she had already brought my meal), to correct and bring their food. OK. We overlooked it nicely and did not make any deal of it.  We buy a bottle of wine, three nice dinners and my friend ordered a cappucino after dinner. No sooner had she barely finished the cappucino when the hostess literally came to our table and asked if we could hurry up and leave as suddenly a crowd was brewing outside and it was an hour wait for them (is that our fault???).  We were shocked actually.  None of us have ever been asked to leave before we were ready.  I truly felt she asked us as we are three middle-aged women--perhaps she felt we would \"empathize\" with her dilemma of the growing crowd outside (who, had arrived at peak dinner hour, unlike us). We noticed she did not ask the couple (with a man) at the table across from us to hurry up and they had been there before us. Really left us all with a bad taste. Additionally, we kept smelling a bad toxic smell of burning plastic in the kitchen. Then we smelled what smelled like propane--which was nauseating.  I was glad to leave but truly annoyed at the service. I will not come back. Food was mediocre which I was willing to overlook (petrale  basically just soaked in butter and cream but not much flavor), had the service been great as I do love the look of the place but now I remember why I only return about once every decade to that place--takes me that long to forget why I did not go back again!!!!", "author": "Christine J."}

For our entrees, I had the special which was crab and artichoke ravioli with a lobster bisque cream sauce. Holy crap, was that ever good. The girl had lasagna which she really enjoyed.

Not enough olive oil or balsamic vinegar and the mozarella tasted like mozarella and not fine, tender and sweet like what buffalo mozarella is supposed to be. When we asked the waiter he sort of brushed it off without any concern that we were concerned.\nThen we ordered the calamari entree described as sauteed with garlic and wine....well, I tell you all I tasted was biting lemon flavor.\nI expected calamari pieces but instead was served 'chopped up and formed into a rectangular shape'....it also was tastless inside and kinda rubbery. It had some extreme lemony batter on the outside devoid of any hints of garlic or wine. \nWe also ordered pizza with artichoke hearts but it tasted like a glob of cheese with hardly any tomato sauce. \nNeedless to say I won't be going back for a long time and probably won't tell any friends to go.

They also have a good wine list that won't break the bank.  When I went to NHC for the first time, I was exposed to the famous SF twins sitting in one of the window seats.  This time around, my husband and I were seated in that very window seat and just as I was worrying that the twins might show up and find us sitting in their seats, my fears were actualized!!  They came, all dressed up and ready to sit in their seats, but found us, some shabbily dressed commoners sitting in their special spot!  I could tell they were less than thrilled as they sipped their wine right next to us and seemed ready to hook and lasso us right out of those seats.  But, they were kind enough to let us eat and run.  Anyhow, my creamy pesto tortellini was awesome and the salad was fresh as could be.  My husband was not too keen on the carpaccio, stating that it was too wet and the mustard that came on top was not spicy dijon, but just a mild mustard.  Other than that, I always enjoy the comfy, cozy, delicious, affordable, Nob Hill Cafe!

With limited options, we decided to try the Nob Hill Cafe. When we put our name in, the wait was about 35 minutes. It seemed like a lot of patrons were waiting outside for the limited seating inside. The wait was quite a bit longer than we were told, and the wine we ordered while we waited wasn't the best, but it was worth it. When I finally sat down, I looked up and saw, to my absolute surprise, the famous San Francisco twins!! Unfortunately for my Yelp review, this happened to be the highlight of my NH Cafe experience. They were seated at the table directly in front of me, so I had a hard time staying focused on my food and conversation. (For good reason: they were wearing matching leopard print cowboy hats and jackets and drinking more hard alcohol than any pair of 93 year old women should.)

We had heard good things and I know lots of good Yelp reviews don't lie, so we eagerly cabbed it over.  It's a tiny little place that doesn't accept reservations and it's in BFNH so when we saw the wait, we really didn't have a choice but to do just that.  We sat outside and froze our arses off because they didn't have any heaters!  The hostess tried to keep our minds off the chill with bringing us glasses of wine, but that really didn't help bc I had to take my arms out of my mummy-like pose to drink it.  Once we got inside, however, the close quarters and the heat from the kitchen warmed me right up.  We started off with a eggplant, tomato & mozzarella salad with the good intentions of eating healthy.  The menu looked good but the specials looked better, so I had the porcini gnocchi (of course) and the bf had the something-italian-and-unpronounceable-but-sounded-great.  My dish was too-die-for... I literally thought I'd close an artery the sauce was so rich, but soooooo good and the gnocchi just melted in my mouth!  The bf's dish was a bit on the lighter side, jam packed with prawns & calamari in a pink cream sauce.

Their food is delicious and I loved how fast they were for pick-up.  The only bad part was the price; $20 for pasta seems a little steep sometimes.", "author": "Melissa S."}

I decided to stop by with my wife for an afternoon drink, possibly snack. We waited for at least 30 minutes, during which time we were not even offered a glass of water. The waiters seemed totally unconcerned and uncaring that we had been waiting for so long. I reached out to a waiter for a menu and to request placing an order twice. I was totally ignored. We left in disgust.!! The place was not even busy ! No matter how a good a reputation a place has for food or whatever, nohing can replace just decent service and a professional attitude towards customers. This place sucks ! I will not recommend this place to anyone. Bad attitude and bad service !!  Frankly giving them one star is being generous.", "author": "Michael B."}

Salad was okay, bruschetta was tasty, and tiramisu was just okay.  Nothing stood out!  It's a place I would go if I was in the neighborhood but not go out of my way to visit.

Cons.... Irish waiter who acts like he would rather be at the dentist then be waiting on you. Hostess who acts like she'd rather be at the gyno then seat you. Tables so close together that you can barely move your arms some time's. And the last one which caused me to write this review in the first place. I go there on a Wednesday night with my bf and a girlfriend of mine. We are waiting for my friends bf to get there. I understand the whole concept of not seating incomplete parties but if you ask for a table for 4 when there are only 3 of you there and they make you wait, that I don't get. Do they make tables for 3????? So we wait..... her boyfriend finally gets there and they tell us it's now an hour wait because we didn't have our complete party there and now there are guest in front of us. As the hostess said \" well if your whole party would have came together this wouldn't have happened\" . I wanted to punch her!!! So I ask to speak to the manager and the Irish waiter says \"she's not here \" and walks away from me. So I ask someone else. He says \" we don't have one\". Are these people kidding!!!! Needless to say we left and went somewhere else!!!!!!!!! These people are rude and act like they are doing you a favor. So many other choices in SF... Bye bye Nob Hill Cafe!!!", "author": "lisa v."}

Came here on a random Tuesday evening at around 7:30, but still had to wait for about 45 min.  However, the wait was not too bad.  The hostess offered to take our drink orders while we had to wait.  She was very attentive and apologetic that we had to wait so long for our table.  When we were finally seated our orders were taken promptly.  The food was a variety of warm Italian comfort food.  At the end of our delicious meal when we were about to order dessert they brought out an order tiramisu and strawberry gelato as an apology for our long wait.  So unexpected but very appreciated by all of us.  Definitely go back for the good food and great service.", "author": "Doris K."}

The food is excellent (you have to try the gnocchi-- literally the best I have ever had) and affordable.  The waiters are very friendly, too.

The Irish hostess was charming, our waitress a little less so.  Two out of three of us started with the huge bowl of ribollita, which was really a thick minestrone-type soup sans the bread that the original recipe requires.  I added my own from the overflowing bread basket and was perfectly content, especially when it was all topped by a generous sprinkling of parmesan cheese and EVOO (well, let's just pretend it was, shall we?) My other table-mate had an interesting interpretation of an Insalata Caprese, which despite that fact that it was not what he expected and was dressed overgenerously with oil and balsamic, he seemed to enjoy.  Two of us had pizza:  one margherita and one gorgonzola and something, which were both good.  Our third ordered the calamari, which turned out to be a huge rubbery and tasteless calamari steak served bad Italian restaurant-style with a side of fettucine is some sort of alfredo like sauce and with a green vegetable.  Let's just say our companion pouted, eventually the dish was sent back and I shared by generous pizza with him.  I might go back if I could get up the hill, either on foot, bus or cablecar, because it was quaint and it was nice to walk past the cathedral after dinner and hear the cable car cables rumble below our feet, and the big white bowls of pasta I saw go by our table looked appetizing.", "author": "Mia C."}

Cozy setting with the restaurant being split into two rooms - the kitchen side, and the bar side.  Definitely try to sit on the bar side because its quieter and has better lighting.  There is an outside patio to grab a glass of wine and wait.  Because there's no parking and its located on top of Russian Hill, you can get seated within a reasonable amount of time.  I go with the linguini and clams which is fantastic.  And the pizza is good too.", "author": "Eric G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-16", "description": "This place deserves 4.5 stars for being a nice Italian Cafe. I'm giving 5 stars, because the overall average with this place is just over 4 stars.  Since I started coming here last October, I have enjoyed their pizza, calzones, petrale sole, lasagna, oso bucco,  and tortellini bolognese.  Their pizza is better than any pizza from the local pizza joint.  If you get a pizza with onion, sausage, and mushroom, you actually taste the onion, sausage, and mushroom.  The atmosphere is nice and the price is lower than right, which translates to a very good value.  The only slight drawback to this place is that they do not take reservations and if you show up at 7:30, you will probably have to wait a while...  Still, the place is highly recommended.", "author": "Darren V."}

I tried to go in the wrong way, as did at least 5 other people after me.  Once inside the correct door and seated next to the wrong door (with a perfect view of others' failed attempts to enter), we were greeted with \"hello, would you like bottled or tap?\"--hmmm....not the most elegant way to get the meal started.  That being said, the rest of the evening was great.  As the meal progressed, I realized the waitress was not being rude, just very casual/informal and friendly.  The caesar salad was average and was missing the croutons, but the tortellini romano and the sole were both delicious--the chef definitely knows how to use butter (yum!).  At the suggestion of the waitress we got the chocolate ganache and the strawberry gelato white chocolate cheesecake--omg--super-yummy!  If you can sit by the window, this place also offers some great people-watching opportunities....would go again just for that.", "author": "colette m."}

I called Nob Hill Cafe and they do not take reservations but estimated a 20 minute wait which we were okay with.  We arrived at 7PM and put in our name.  It was raining outside and there is no inside area to wait for a table, so we parked under the awning outside at their second entrance, about 6 feet from the front door.  After 25 minutes we checked in with the host and were told we were next up behind a party of 5.  Another 20 minutes later we checked in again.  We were told they had called our names and we did not respond so they gave our table away.  We told them we had been waiting about 6 feet from the front door under their own awning (with other people)!  We asked if they had another table for us and we were told no- no apology, nothing.  I am 7 months pregnant and by the time we sat down we had been waiting a very uncomfortable 1 hour and 15 minutes standing in the rain.  Talk about poor host service!  Fortunately, once we were seated the food was great and the server we had did a great job.  All in all I would not go back because of the poor service we received being seated for a table.  There are way too many other San Francisco restaurants nearby that will provide stellar hospitality.", "author": "Karen W."}

The other night the special was Fruita de Mare (mixed seafood) in a lobster bisque sauce over linguini... OMG! fabulous!  The white clam sauce is light and very flavorful, the eggplant parm is out of this world good and the calamari steak sauteed in a piccata sauce (white wine, butter, lemon and capers) is the best!  The bruschetta is great, and just a plain green dinner salad is special with a light lemony house dressing. The service has been consistantly great and the bread is reason enough to go there - foccatia and regular Italian bread, served warm.  The prices are very reasonable, and the portions not too large, and definitely not too small.  I'm going back there again tonight!  What a find!!!", "author": "Mariellen B."}
