It was time for lunch on Labor Day. I'm not feeling well, haven't been to work for the past week, but I'm the driver. Talked to my doctor last week. What he suggested isn't really working. Getting worse. Going to call him again tomorrow. \nLet's go to Sotto Mare for lunch. Should have called. They're closed. Hmm. Let's just get pizza from Tony's. Look! There's a parking space right across the street! They open in 10 minutes. Everyone got out. I sat int he van and rested. The doors open, I get out, pay the meter, cross the street. \nWe're seated at the table against the front window. I can see the take-out area next door. Was there a door there before? I don't remember. I hope I can sit through this meal. Menus presented. Water and drinks served. We'll order three pizzas. All Medium. We like getting different flavors.\nWe were there only long enough to chow down on our pies, but where the heck are the crowds? The lines out the door? The people buying slices. Oh well. We've never been here at opening on a holiday before.\nMargherita - 4 - this is the one that won for Tony in Naples. Since when did he start putting cold sliced tomatoes on this pie? Well, he did used to do it at Pyzano's in Castro Valley ever so long ago. Crust is okay though not as thin or crackery. It works.\nGarlic Chicken - 4 - not something that I would usually order but it's quite flavorful. Same issues with the crust but not a deal breaker.\nCoit Tower - 4 - Chosen by the youngster from Canada. He wants his meat pie.\nAll three were decent. We didn't finish any of them but there wasn't quite enough slices left to make a whole pie. I told the kid that it'd be a great late night snack in his hotel room. His mother and grandmother weren't so sure but they can't argue with their host. \nI hobbled back to the van, my wife put the pizza in the back and we continued on with our tour of San Francisco. At the end of the day, when I handed the kid the box, I was wondering why it had North Beach Pizza on the lid. \nOMG! I told you that I wasn't feeling well. And no one corrected me. We were four blocks from Tony's and at the wrong restaurant. Thank goodness the pizza and service were decent. Sorry Tony. We'll get you next time.", "author": "Dexter D."}

Yelping really is a habit, \"Get like me!\" Although it doesn't seem like I care at times \"Yelpdom\" I really do. All work and no \"North Beach\" has made \"Mr Gold Chain\" a very unhappy guy. The things we put ourselves through sometimes just to make a \"Buck\" willing and unwillingly sometimes. But, I must say on this day I had to make my return to SF and go to my surrogate home and reclaim some crowns more or less. I also wanted to try something new..it's easy to just only go to places you like \"Dip, Golden Boy, Busters ect\" for a quick bite but..North Beach Pizza I hadn't been too yet. I wanted to knock this off my bookmarks, my review starts now..\n\nTuesday June 13, 2017\nLocation: North Beach Pizza SF, Ca\nPeople: 1 Adult\n\nStory:\nNorth Beach had a bone to pick with me, and I was there to face the music. It felt great to be in \"The City\" I love being out there, a place where any day you go feels like a Saturday or Sunday. I had been away for what seemed like an eternity, but I was finally able to make my re-debut. As I'm trying to have more things to \"Yelp\" about. \"North Beach Pizza\" isn't far from my usual hangouts. With Pizza joints being all around North Beach, I decided to give yet another one a try..\n\nService/Hospitality:\nPretty standard service, I got greeted when I came in....Yea..Very quick interaction here and I was pretty much on my way from there.\n\nFood/Cleanliness:\nNorth Beach Pizza is more than just a pizza joint, they serve standard Italian Food here (Pasta, Whole Pizza, Sandwinches ect) On this visit for me though, I just went simple and had 2 slices of Pepperoni and Sausage $4.00 (Plus Tax on Single Slices Only) It was decent pizza for the price. The server took the slices I had and ran them through the pizza oven to re-warm them up a bit. I took the slices back to \"Grant and Green\" to enjoy with a beer. It was tasty, maybe better had it been a super fresh slice. It had a nice topping to cheese ratio for me, the end crust did get a bit chewy I guess from the re-heating but otherwise decent. I took time to examine the place a bit before I left. The place was tidy, a few tables needed to be cleared from what I could see on the restaurant side, but the togo slice area was clean for the most part.\n\nOverall:\nNorth Beach Pizza is another \"North Beach\" pizza joint I can cross off my list. I think once I finally try \"Tony's Pizza\" I will have to do a ranking of my favorite pizza spots in \"Little Italy\" I liked this place and would recommend it forsure for a quick slice, but for the uniqueness....I would still choose \"Golden Boy Pizza\" over this place. So on that note I leave you with this....\n\nSo now\u00a0\"Yelpdom\", with an open heart and an empty stomach, I say unto you in the words of my uncle: \"Allez Cuisine!\"", "author": "Tre S."}

Half of us decided to order from here for convenience sake (hungry, no line, pizza looked good) and the other half (me) decided to continue the search for Golden Boy.\n\nWe found Golden Boy and behold, the line was around the block. After 3 rounds of rock paper scissors, we decided to skip the line and go to North Beach Pizza. There weren't many pizza options but the cook in the back seemed pretty busy in creating a variety of pizzas. At the time, they had Hawaiian, pepperoni, cheese, mushroom pesto, sausage pesto. I ordered the mushroom pesto because my friend gave me a hard time about how pigs are as smart as dogs- how dare you order the sausage. I'm okay with that, I do love mushrooms. \n\nThe pizza was pretty good. The crust- soft, warm, thick---- not the thick as in \"this is too chewy I'm going to choke\", it was a good thick. I'm not the biggest pesto fan so I was glad it wasn't smothered in pesto sauce- just enough for the kick. What was noticeable was the cheese! A very cheesy pizza- not hating, I LOVE cheese. And perfectly saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. My drunken stomach was more than pleased with this pizza. \n\nIs it at good as Golden Boy... debatable. But when it's 1230am and the Golden Boy line is obnoxious- this place is a great alternative. Because we all just want pizza when we had a few drinks right?!", "author": "Marcie A."}

I'm fairly particular about pizza, having worked in a good place across the country many, many years ago.\n\nToday, everything seemed to be in sync.  Actually, we had virtually passed the place while heading from Coit Tower to Ghiardelli Square and returned.  I swear that I could live every day in San Fran and I still would be lost every day.  Yeesh!\n\nIn any case, coming around from the park, it was fairly easy to see this on the corner.  The interior seems both antique and trendy.  The staff was friendly.  Further from the corner, they have a section for those who want slices.  They made sure up front that we knew this.\n\nThe waiter arrived with a two glasses of water and took our order for a 12 inch North Beach Combo pizza.  It's your basic deluxe/supreme/whatever you call it.  My buddy remembered after a bit to get a Dr. Pepper and an iced tea.\n\nI'm not sure how long it took for the pizza but after all of the walking, we were okay just to sit.\n\nWhen the pizza arrived, the woman put it on the table with a pedestal and two spatulas.  It looked quite colorful.  As we took a slice, the cheese was very stringy, and we had to catch ingredients.\n\nTaking a bite, the crust seemed manufactured.  Good, but the texture suggested that a machine had prepared it.  I suppose this is a thing nowadays.  We had also been to a place called Red Robin Pizza in Livermore with similar methods.\n\nThe pizza was quite good, and the price was reasonable at $18.50.  That's less than Mountain Mike's and quite a lot less than Round Table, but of course, you're not getting lingui\u00e7a and a few other items.  It was more enjoyable than their pizzas.\n\nReturning would matter on being in the neighborhood.

While they have a decent amount and variety of veggies on the plate, it's the same old crappy restaurant service salad dressing that many places serve.  My tip to the owner --- Make a total kick-ass salad dressing from scratch and when someone orders a salad you can say 'do you want the ass kicking dressing we make or the industrial crap'.

Guess I was wrong.\n\nI called in my order at 7:44 on a Wednesday night, and was told I would receive my order within 45-60 minutes. For those keeping track, that would have 8:45 on the long side. My order arrived at 9:10, which is almost 1 1/2 hours. But I didn't complain, and I still tipped the delivery guy, because hey, it's not his fault, right? Well, it turns out that the pizza must have left the store some time before it's arrival to my door, because it was cold, and so were the hot wings.\n\nI proceeded to eat the pizza, only to find that the crust was not cooked all the way through, and was still gloppy and raw in the middle. I had to peel back the cheese and toppings, and then remove the uncooked parts of dough, so I could finish my slice. So after that fiasco, I proceeded to dig into the hot wings... only to find that they were barely cooked also! I couldn't believe it. You know how raw chicken skin is pale, white, flabby and chewy? That's what every single wing was like. I just couldn't believe it. But I had been traveling all day to return home to SF, and I was starving, so I made the best of a bit more pizza and put the rest, along with the wings, in the fridge and cooked them all the next day. \n\nSo for the privilege of having the ingredients delivered to me so that I could properly cook everything myself, I paid $42.36.\n\nOh, and to top it all off... I tipped the driver $4.00, but my credit card statement says I was charged $4.82 -- so even after all of that, the driver padded his tip fraudulently!!! \nI was disappointed that the food was terrible, but I am so furious that someone would take the liberty of changing their tip (no matter how small) - especially considering what an awful experience it was. \n\nI am done with this place.", "author": "Jean O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-03", "description": "One of my good friends introduced me to North Beach Pizza as we were walking to his apartment from downtown to Telegraph Hill.  It's a regular stop on his foot commute to work, so he's gotten to know this place and its staff well.  It turns out North Beach Pizza has two locations in San Francisco and one down in San Mateo.  This location, at the corner of Union and Grant, is the original.\n\nThe pizzas are made with whole milk mozzarella cheese and the dough is hand-spun.  There are about a dozen house special pizzas, many named with a local flair.  For example, there's the Coit Tower Special (mushrooms, sausage, salami, pepperoni) and the Golden Gate Special (chicken, pesto, mushrooms, garlic, and onions).  Pizzas come in three sizes (12\", 14\", 16\") and start at about $10 for a small with no toppings.  House specials range from about $12-27 depending on size and toppings.  Pizza by the slice is also available and costs $4 per slice.\n\nWhile pizza is the specialty, North Beach Pizza also serves other Italian cuisine such as pasta (spaghetti, fettuccine, tortellini, ravioli, lasagna), entrees like parmigiana, Italian sandwiches (e.g. meatball), and soups and salads.  Pasta and entrees are typically around $12 and sandwiches are $7-8.\n\nI recommend the following pizzas:\n\nNorth Beach Special - pepperoni, green bell pepper, sausage, mushroom, onion, black olives\nCable Car Special - garlic sauce, chicken, bacon, green onion, tomatoes\n\nWhether it's by the slice or ordered whole, the pizzas are delicious.  We're talking borderline five stars here.  The by-the-slice pizzas are premade and sitting behind glass display cases next to the ordering counter.  They're available for immediate consumption.  Thus, this place is ideal if you're on-the-go.  Sit-down is fine too.\n\nYou can tell the toppings are fresh.  I like the North Beach Special because of its large and savory pepperoni slices and hints of garlic.  I like the Cable Car Special because garlic sauce is used instead of tomato sauce.  The garlic sauce is creamy and full of flavor.  No matter which pizza you order, the crust is amazing.  Crispy on the outside, soft and delightfully chewy on the inside.  I want to say the dough also has some extra flavor added in.  Garlic, perhaps?\n\nService is excellent.\n\nSimply put, North Beach Pizza makes some very tasty pizzas.", "author": "Daniel B."}

We settled on garlic bread for an appetizer, he had the tortellini carbonara, and I settled on the eggplant parm. \n\nThe garlic bread was ok, nothing to rave about. My bf was disappointed with his entree because there was literally no ham to be found on his plate and the description clearly said \"cream sauce with ham.\" Big fail! My eggplant parm wasn't extraordinary either. I've had better delivery from the Taraval location.\n\nOur waitress was by herself at the time, but that shouldn't excuse her lack of customer service. There were only 3 other tables besides ours and she failed to refill our water and it took her forever to give us our check. The bill came out to around $30 and we still had the decency to tip. \n\nDefinitely go somewhere else if you're looking for better service and food. I have nothing bad to say about their pizza because I've had it several times and I like it, just skip the pasta if you want to dine here.", "author": "Fallon P."}

Its a garlicky white pie with chicken, pesto, mushrooms, garlic & onions. I love garlic and pesto so I'm predisposed to like this pie. \n\nI think it's less about the ingredients.

Find another place that is consistent.  \n\nYears ago this place used to be great.  They used a lot of toppings, ample cheese, high quality ingredients, etc.  The pizzas arrived on time and were cooked well.  Fast forward from about 6 + years ago to today and things have changed.  They use half the cheese they used to.  The toppings are also about half the amount and the quality is a little less than I remember in general.  The cooking is inconsistent.  Sometimes the dough is not done and/or the thing is all soggy, especially in the middle.  Gross!  Prices have gone up and they stopped giving out coupons with delivery.  They now charge a \"delivery fee.\" Delivery times are VERY inconsistent.  Sometimes they are there in 30 min while others, such as last night, they took an hour 20.  They price gouge on toppings when designing your own pizza from their topping menu.  A medium pizza is $30+ at three sparse toppings!!!!!  Crazy! \n\nWhen I am ordering a delivery pizza I'm usually in a place mentally where I do not want to be hassled and jacked with.  With N. Beach Pizza it's like rolling the dice.  I may get a decent (but expensive!) pizza in 30 min or less.......or I may (more likely it seems) get a soggy, cold, limp, expensive salty blob of sparse, low grade toppings in a box an hour and a half later.....after having to call to see if they lost my order.  \n\nWho needs the potential hassle?!  I don't.  I just want to know I am going to get a decent quality properly cooked pizza in around 30 min. or so.  \n\nIf I am willing to roll the dice there better at least be the prospect of getting an over the top mind blowing quality pizza.

Over the years I now find myself buying take out pizzas from COSTCO, and baking them at home for a fraction of the price.

They had a outside window where the girl worked feverishly to get the people there slices.. I picked up a slice of cheese and a combination slice.. Both were very tasty and nice and hot.. Overall the price is what is expected (about $3.00) and the taste was good.. Not great but good.. I know a Sicilian slice will have more dough than a traditional Napolitano, but San Fran has a very doughy consistency that has thrown me off, as I am used to East Coast (NY) pizza.  Good spot though especially after a few pops.", "author": "Billy F."}

My slice of cheese came out burned, the crust was black, and so were parts of the underside. I asked for another slice and the guy who was behind the counter acted offended and told me the pizza isn't burned. He just kept repeating it... dude, I don't care if you don't think it's burned, it's black, and to me that's burned food, just give me another slice and don't make a big deal... sheesh. He did replace the slice but without saying a word to me and glaring at me like I'm a pest. No thanks. The pizza itself was too doughy, with not enough sauce.... nothing special and I would have gone the route of no review again, but the service sucked.", "author": "J D."}

And there began the waiting again! Another hour is passed and I called again (4th call now) to tell the manager that it has been 2 and half hours since I first ordered the pizza and an hour since I last called. And she says \"Oh No, I never promised a time\". I am laughing in my mind thinking \"Yeh, since you know you can never keep the promise\". Then wondering about their customer service I asked why she offered to send another pizza if they can't deliver. Her response \"Because we wanted to show the burnt pizza to the kitchen\". And to my utmost annoyance by then (not to mention my hunger) I told her \"No more pizza! Since the driver is on his way, he can take the burnt pizza back and I'll make sure not to visit or order from them again\". To add to my surprise, when the driver comes after few minutes, I give him the pizza, he opens the box and says with an attitude \"there are only few burnt slices??\" Hmmmm, I have no more words.\n\nSIGH!

Finally he acknowledged me and not with an apology, but with a nod. Talk about rude. I had a plain cheese slice. Not fresh, which was really surprising, cheese was so so, crust was worse than that. I thought ok maybe a bad night for the place so I came back the following evening. Though the service was a bit better, the pizza did indeed suck. What an incredible disappointment.\n\nIt used to be owned and operated by a Brazilian family. Now it looks like a chinese family owns it. I do not recognize a sole. My guess is the new owners paid a pretty penny for the place and decided to cut corners with low quality product. Guess what that will only last for so long, There are a number of good pizza joints that have moved in. Tonys, one street away is really great, as is Nizarios, though it is about 5 blocks away.", "author": "david b."}

I protested, and was told by a large and very rude male employee that they are actually allowed to do that, and no it's not actually illegal.\n\nWell, it is. I would have accepted a \"sorry, but it's store policy, \"it's not up to me\" or something other than that bemused dude telling me they're somehow the exception to the law. \n\nThe law, in fact, states: \"According to the merchants' MasterCard and Visa contracts, stores CANNOT require a minimum purchase. If they do, it violates their agreement with their bank issuer or credit card company.\n\nThat means consumers are entitled to use their Visa or MasterCards to pay for an item, no matter how low the price. If the merchant refuses to accept a credit card for small purchases, consumers should send a letter of complaint to the bank that issued their card. If that doesn't resolve things, they can contact the Better Business Bureau.\n\nNeither American Express nor Discover prohibit minimum charges per se. However, both companies prohibit merchants from charging higher minimums for their cards than others they accept. Thus, if a merchant accepts Visa or MasterCard, they cannot require minimum purchases for Discover or American Express.\"\n\nAnyway, I didn't eat their pizza, but my friends were not impressed with theirs. It's really annoying to find establishments that illegally charge a credit card minimum, and even more irritating to be met with such arrogance from an employee who obviously has no idea what he's talking about and just felt like being a jerk. Also, isn't it just a stupid way of doing business? They could have made seven bucks off me, but chose not to make any money off me because they'd rather rip people off?\n\nNeedless to say, it was my first and last visit.", "author": "Caroline S."}

This is also the only phone number for them listed on their website.  I have only gotten busy signals.  I figure there must be some other form of communication.\n\nSure enough, there's also a fax number.  So I found a website faxzero.com where you can send one for free with a message explaining my situation.\n\nSurprisingly, this worked, and I got a call about a minute ago (since I started writing this).  Here's the conversation between myself and North Beach Pizza Girl (NBPG) - \n\nNBPG: Hi is this Joseph?\nme: Yes, this is\nNBPG: Hi, sorry, I meant to leave a message when I called earlier, but something came up.  We've actually been closed for about an hour.\nme: So, there's no pizza coming?\nNBPG: No...\nme: Thanks?\n\nIt's barely past midnight, your website says open til late, and your online ordering system ALLOWED ME TO PLACE THE FUCKING ORDER.  I'm glad I didn't use a credit card, or else this would be even worse.\n\nI have had North Beach Pizza before, it's nothing special but would have sufficed tonight.  I suppose now I can call some other shitty mediocre pizza place.  Maybe they'll answer the phone?  That would seem like good customer service at this point.\n\nFuck off, North Beach Pizza", "author": "Joseph N."}

Boy are we glad we did! I was starving so started off with a side of meatballs. Yum Yum Yum! They were delicious big meatballs in a very pure tomato sauce. Being from the Northeast and traveling to NYC often during my childhood, I know how to spot genuine Italian Food and tomato sauce. The pizza was divine. It had that scrumptious cheese that you get off the streets in NYC...I can't even describe it, but not every pizza has that particular flavor. Maybe it's the particular distributor they get the cheese from...we designed our own thin crust pizza with a regular cheese pizza base...half with artichokes, fresh basil and feta cheese, half with pesto. We ate way too much but it was worth it. We found out they would deliver to our place and ended up trying it for delivery last week. I loved the online ordering feature they have on their yelp listing. I didn't even have to pick up the phone. They were right though - the waitress had warned us it would take an hour and it sure did. It was still hot though and just as good as the first time we had it. We forgot to ask for thin crust, but still thoroughly enjoyed the thicker crust version.", "author": "Kelsey K."}

The girl who finally greeted us was the hostess I think.\n*They only have cans of soda at $1.75 each, no refills.\n*My food came out at least 10 min before anyone elses meals so I was sitting there waiting while my food got cold. And minus the bread that comes with, so I had to ask for it.\n*My mom's meal didn't come until we were almost done eating (30 min after I got mine) and we had to ask a few times where it was\n*My dad's anchovie pizza was not very good. Anyone who likes this pizza knows that you have to bake the pizza with the toppings on it instead of putting them on after it comes out (and isn't this common sense?). It really looked like they forgot to put them on and did a last min add on, my dad was not impressed. \n\nI have a lot more tolerance for bad restaurant service then I think most people do because I worked in restaurants for a long time and I realize that stuff happens. This was just a bad experience from start to finish and I will definitely never be returning. The only reason this even qualifies for 1 star is because they did end up taking the lasagna off the bill. Very unimpressed with every aspect of this experiences and extrememly dissapointed that I chose this restaurant to take my parents to while they were in town visiting me. \n\nI've heard great things about Tony's down the street, so next time I want italian I plan to try out Tony's instead.", "author": "Kate C."}

Granted, I really haven't gone a huge amount of time for the long time I've lived in the area, but I'm confident giving them top rating, even with the formidable competition in the area.  Which may be why they are raising their game.  Though from the looks, business is not good.  But don't pooh pooh this classic establishment because it's not as hip as the new entrants; if you're in the mood for old fashioned non-fancy pizza, this is solid and fast as ever if you do pickup.

As it turns out, I must have been having glorious memories of their pizza back in the day.\n \nAfter several disappointing pies, the last slice that broke my heart was on the night of the North Beach Festival. The place was crawling with people who had been drinking all day and it was a fight to even get to the counter. When I gave them my name it turned out somehow they didn't put in my phone order. They were super nice about the situation and the manager even came out to tell me she would only charge me half price. This made having to wait a half hour while it baked not such a bad deal. I got home feeling alright about it until I realized half of my pizza wasn't all that cooked. I know, what do you expect for being so freakishly busy, right?\n\nI think I'm just over the super doughy, heavily cheesed pizza that they offer. OK, I admit sometimes a slice of thick, grease laden pizza and beer really do hit the spot. (Like when you're drunk at the North Beach Fair!) And for that I'm willing to take a couple cheesy pieces off their hands. \n\nAuthentic or gourmet, it's not. But good, greasy hangover food? Not too bad.", "author": "Kira R."}

The restaurant was across the street from the current location and the booths were cushioned. Almost a decade later, I felt the need to be satiated again by the famous NBP in no other place than North Beach.\n\nAt around 1 p.m. on a fine summer Friday, several friends and I were indecisive about which of the many tables in the dining room to choose so we just took one in the corner in front of the salad bar (it's not an actual salad bar, but where the salads are prepared by waiters/waitresses for serving). Our server was very courteous. I was able to find a coupon for $3 off a large pizza online so we decided to go ahead with a large Cable Car Special with a side order of 10 pc. buffalo wings. \n\nThe buffalo wings took a little longer than we expected but it was good. I'm not a fan of anything with bones except maybe fish. The pizza was even better. I added the spices, red chili peppers, and black pepper to my slices for personalization and it was zesty! Also, try adding the buffalo wings sauce on top for added flavor. I needed over 2 cups of water to clear my mouth.

I weigh the go-buy-ingredients with just-order-something. Ordering wins. The something - a 14\" thin crust pizza with Italian sausage, mushrooms and black olives - turns out to be my best food choice of the week. Really. \n\nThe facts:  Delivery wasn't fast. The first estimate- 55 minutes - was revised to two hours about 10 minutes after I placed the order though grubhub.com. Err,  OK, not so bad. It's afternoon of my day off. I can do this. Dinner time on a weeknight? Or late night? Would be a different story. Be warned.  \n\nThen the hardest working delivery man in San Francisco shows up with a thin-crust-ample-portions-of-my-favorite -toppings pizza. And it's... soggy. Oh no.

Now, keep in mind that I've ordered from the Excelsior location dozens upon dozens of times, and never had anything but good experiences with both the food and the service. So I was expecting the same from this location. Boy howdy was I mistaken. We ordered around 8:30, and were told the food would arrive in about an hour (It seemed a little long since delivery from just about anywhere else in the area is 45 minutes, tops, but I gave them a little lenience since it was Saturday night). An hour and 15 minutes went by, and the food hadn't arrived, so my mom called to check up on it. She got a good amount of attitude from the person she talked to, who said the pizza would be another 10 minutes or so. 20 minutes went by and finally it came, only for me to discover that the pizza had been burned beyond the point of being edible. The crust was black and cardboard like, and the veggies on it were complete mush. My mom called them back to complain, not being one to take things lying down, and once again got nothing but attitude, She was put on the phone with somebody who I'm assuming was the manager, explained the situation, wanting a new (and edible!) pizza to be sent in it's place. She had to argue for a good 10 minutes with the woman on the phone, who was yelling at her and fighting her every step of the way, insisting that it was impossible for them to replace it, and trying to turn it around to make the situation my mom's fault. She finally got them to comply, and we received the new pizza about an hour later which thankfully was cooked correctly.\n\nI've never had this much of a problem with customer service at a restaurant before. Any time I've had an issue with the quality of the food at a restaurant, they've gladly replaced it or offered to comp the meal, no questions asked. So the fact that North Beach was so stubborn about this is absolutely asinine to me.

The options for delivery pizza in NB are truly awful. Someone PLEASE give me a good pizza place that delivers in NB.  I'm really not that picky, I just want a decent pizza.\n\nSo I ordered from NB again.  Was disappointed again.  Slow, sloppy and overpriced.  Ordered a North Beach Special, which is usually not bad.  When it arrived, most of the cheese was on one side of the pizza, in a cold congealed mass, while the other side was contained most of the other toppings.  \n\nI will say, that one out of three times I order here, I get a decent pizza.  Which is why I thought two stars was fair.  But you have to eat two bad, overpriced pizzas to get that one decent pizza.  Your choice.  Problem is there is not that many options here in NB. \n\nSeriously, anyone have a good recommendation for pizza delivery in North Beach?", "author": "John H."}

So last night while walking by their new restaurant/take-out place on Grant, I saw the pizzas resting on the counter and thought they did look good. I ordered a Cable Car special, with creamy garlic sauce, chicken, bacon, and mushrooms.

The lady who works there is so kind. I like how they offer pizza slices since they moved to their new space.  I had one slice of the cable car pizza and it was a two star experience.  It should have been 5 stars with bacon, chicken, onions, and a cream sauce.  Anything with bacon should be at least 4 stars,  I think it was because the pizza had been sitting out awhile and the cheese stiff and cold.  It may have been better fresh out of the oven. It's sorta like McDonald fries.  Those are the best when they are fresh out of the fryer, but not good at all a few hours later.", "author": "Dbear T."}

The pizza is excellent, so I hope NB can match their customer service with the quality of their pizza. Second, I was hoping to see a fountain soda machine in the new building.

He promises that the order will get out and that it's on the store.

The only good thing about my pizza experience was that I didn't have to leave my apartment to get it and it was delivered to me promptly.

We refuse delivery as no one likes a fully loaded soggy pie with aoked up salad.

My kid likes this place so whenever we are in the area and she wants pizza, we come here.  But last Sunday will be the last.  We ordered a large pepperoni and sausage thin crust, the spaghetti and clams with olive oil and garlic (we were offered red and white sauce too), and the minestrone soup.  Let me start with the better items:  the soup was good and not too salty.  The pizza crust was burnt at the edges and the middle was soggy like a wet sponge.  I can understand if the pizza crust gets soggy in a cardboard box after taking 20 minutes to be delivered but this was the first slice after the pie arrived at our table...gross!  The worse part was the spaghetti and clams.  It came in a heavy alfredo sauce and not oil and garlic.  When we informed the waitress, she went to the kitchen and did not come back until 20 minutes latter.  She kept insisting it was oil and garlic with a little cream...WTF!!!  She said sorry but made no effort to adjust the bill.  I guess NB no longer cares about repeat business.", "author": "Edmund W."}

Ordered delivery with some friends and it took them way over the promised delivery time to deliver (sorry for being redundant). I think we finally got our pizza 45 minutes after the promised time. We called to find out where the heck it was and they said just a few minutes. I don't know about you, but I define a few as 3-5 minutes not 45. When the pizza came it was all soggy but I was so hungry and sucked it up and devoured 3 pieces. 14 hours later I am still paying for it. My stomach currently feels like it has rocks in it and I feel like I am going to throw up. I'll never eat here again. There are much better pizza places in the area.", "author": "Sierra d."}

I won't vouch for the pizza, since i had pasta, but the pasta was awful. It was like they added sugar to the marinara sauce to make it sweet, and awful. There isn't too much more that I can say about this place, other than, meh, i've experienced better!", "author": "Sarah I."}

Our take out experience was horrible, we live 1 block away, ordered there and came home with a cold pizza. The management was unreceptive that our pizza could have possibly been cold and was not willing to resolve our issue when we called. We took the cold pizza back and demanded our money back. Do not go to North Beach Pizza -- they live on their name. Save your money and go to Za's. No excuse for poor management this evening and a $22.00 pizza that was inedible. They may have opened a new location and look like the real deal...in this economy, take your business somewhere else! We are!", "author": "Myrna B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-04-08", "description": "They lie about their prices.  I just ordered a pizza tonight online and checked out, thought everything was fine.  Then I got the confirmation call and they said the pizza was about $2 more because they \"hadn't gotten around to updating their prices on the website\".  Seriously?  I asked to speak to a manager and the girl said \"there is no manager - no one is in charge\".  I called back on another number and talked with the manager Janine, who told me she'd give me the pizza for the price the website quoted.  Gee, thanks.  Then, an hour later the pizza shows up with the higher price bill.  Call again, talk to Janine, and she basically says tough, do you want the pizza or not.  OK, I know, $2, it's not much.  But it's messed up to make up a new price when you've published another.  I'll be doing a chargeback for the difference and they've lost a customer for life.   Too bad, because I average about 2 or 3 orders a month.  Suck it North Beach.", "author": "Gregorio S."}

I went there last week surprized to find that the old location was closed, but seeing that it had opened across the street. Since I'm trying to lower the carbs and fat, pizza is a rare treat, and this was a very dissapointing  Xmas treat to myself. I don't live in the city any more, but came in for some Xmas shopping, and dragged my husband here for nostaligia's sake.  Boy was I dissapointed. Maybe memories grow more fabulous with age, but I remembered a pizza that was dripping with different flavored cheeses that made a great taste sensation, and just the right amount of sauce. Instead, whlle the crust was nice and chewy, the pizza was overall more bread than pizza, and the tomato sauce must have been painted on with a brush to give it all the color and so little flavor. The cheese was plentiful but seemed to be all mozarella instead of that wonderful mixture I had tasted once before. And the place was freezing- I did not take my coat or hat off, and I finally complained. The waitress then gave me some explanation that it was too hot in the kitchen so they were leaving the back door OPEN.  Well, it was like outdoor seating inside. I have cross this place off my nostaliga list, and would prefer Village Pizza on Van Ness. Maybe less \"north beach\" atmosphere, but better pizza!", "author": "Robin B."}

Last time I called in an order, they kept putting me on hold and transferring me to other employees who made me start my ordering process over again.  Then, when my BBQ chicken special arrived, it was actually a plain cheese pizza.  When I called and said the order had been messed up, the manager (who I demanded I speak to), told me the correct pizza would be on the way, and I could \"do whatever I wanted\" with the cheese pizza.  Not the case because when the driver arrived with my BBQ chicken pizza, he demanded that I trade my cheese pizza (partially eaten -- i was getting hungry!) for the BBQ chicken!!  When I asked \"why?  you can't sell it or anything!\" he looked me in the eye and said \"I HAD TO PAY FOR IT.\"  Ridiculous!  He messed up the order, and he basically stole my pizza!  Furious, I called the manager back and told him the story.  He apologized and offered me a free pizza next time I called.  Well, I called today, dealt with the usual hassle of being transferred on the phone several times, and I have yet to see if my pizza will arrive as I ordered it.  Even without the hassle, the pizza is generally sub-par.   Do yourself a favor and go to any of the trendier pizza joints in town for a better bang for you buck -- pauline's, little star, za, orgasmica, etc.  Oh if I could only give 0 stars!", "author": "Matthew A."}
