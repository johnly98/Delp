Service was very friendly the entire time and very attentive (to a point where they gave us water on the table but they came and refilled ours cups anyway). \n\nFor our meal my friend and I got the following:\n1) Ceviche trio which comes with shrimp ceviche w/ rocoto pepper sauce, shrimp octopus ceviche in aji amarillo sauce, and leche de tigre w/ halibut ceviche. My favorite ceviche has always been the classic leche de tigre and this was a solid version of it. Halibut wasn't overmarinated and \"overcooked\" by the acid. The sauce wasn't spicy and had a thicker consistency which would make it a great sauce to dip extra chicken into. My second favorite was the rocoto pepper though I liked the aji amarillo almost the same amount. Neither was spicy but the peppers definitely mellow out the tart sauce more which is why I prefer the leche de tigre (plus I prefer shrimp over fish though the shrimp was cut very well and fairly tender). Nice trio dish with good portions. The creaminess and sweetness of the non-roasted choclo was nice though my friend preferred the roasted ones. (4/5)\n\n2) Dark chicken w/ tacu tacu and sweet potato fries w/ aji amarillo sauce: Friend's main entree. The chicken was good and the seasoning on the skin was great but overall not much better than a Costco rotisserie chicken. The sides on the other hand made this dish. The tacu tacu is salty but so delicious. So much flavor and not too heavy on the beans but enough to give the whole thing a slightly starchier and moist texture. The sweet potato fries are average but gawd I love aji amarillo sauce and I haven't had it in so long. It's an addiction (no joke I smuggled a bag full of sauce packets last time I went to Peru). I will smother it on everything. The one here is delicious though a bit salty. That won't stop me from drinking it like water though. (3.75/5)\n\nOverall, my friend and I enjoyed our meal here. Everything was solid. The chicken dish isn't pricy but not necessarily something good enough to warrant a trip here. Would definitely come back for the tacu tacu and aji amarillo sauce though.", "author": "Vivian C."}

BUT, aside from the service, the food was good.\n\nI came here for dinner on a Friday evening. Reservation was already made which is great because this place gets so crowded on the weekend, that it seems almost impossible to get a seat without reservation. Reservation was at 7:15pm. I came at 7:20pm. I remember at around 7:22pm, the hostess came over and asked us if we are giving up our seats. I was a little perplexed. Who said anything about giving up our seats? Then she proceeded to say if we don't sit down then we will lose our seat. Usually, restaurants has a 10-15 mins buffer period of how long they'll hold the reservation for. I honestly like we we were being rushed and almost booted. That was a pretty rude. My friend was there on time and I was only 7 minutes late. \n\nOnce we got seated, we were placed in a very crowded area. Other people kept bumping into this. While, we were enjoying our drinks and eating our appetizer, the waiter came over and asked if we could move. Come on...Seriously? Is this how this place treat their customers? The waiter was very nice though. He explained it's because there is a large party and if we would be kind enough to move then they could combine those two tables. Yes, I was very annoyed but we were nice people so we decided to move for them.\n\nNot only that, the food came out very sporadically. First, they forgot to give us our sauce for the yuca fries then we forgot to give us our sauces for our chicken. We had to ask several of times for them to give us what we needed.\n\nI understand the restaurant can get very crowded. And, the waiter was doing his best in such busy traffic hours. But the constant lack of service did leave a bad taste that supersedes the quality of the food. The food was good but the service was very lacking that evening. I will give this restaurant another try and hopefully, the next time I come back, I will have a better experience.", "author": "Ngoc P."}

In fact, it has been around for years and I'm glad they're still busy, busy, busy! Their famous free range whole rotisserie chicken is a steal at $29 and it comes with two sides (get the green beans and sweet potato fries)\n\nEven though I wanted to keep dinner to be reasonably doable (which is very possible at Limon), it was girl's night out so half the bill was alcohol! Patron tequila shots at $13 each, a pitcher of sangria at $35 (a creeper according to my gfs!) and a few other cocktails. If you stick with classics like a margarita, then you're safer than their cocktail menu offerings. \n\nSince we were fatties, we ordered twice the amount empanadas than we should've! 2 orders of the carne, queso and pollo empanadas. Keep in mind that an order already comes with TWO deep fried stuffed pastries, so be careful. You would be remiss not to order the ceviche mixto, a generous sampling of any of the ceviches on the menu at $18. (take that La Mar!) I also loved the arroz con mariscos, even though the presentation could've been better if it was served in a paella pan.\n\nWe LOVED Maya as she was such a sweetie and catered to our every request. Yes, GNO mean multiple photo requests that have to be re-taken at least 3x! WTH, I said to my friends. Isn't that what filters are for? * rolls eyes *\n\nStart your Saturday night out at Limon, you'll be guaranteed reasonably priced food, free flowing sangrias and such a great time, you might not even make it to the other bars you planned for the night.", "author": "Janice C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-03-21", "description": "Yikes. Limon was not what I expected at all. This restaurant came highly recommended & sorry to say, but it disappointed! First off, make reservations or else you will be waiting upwards of about 1-2 hours. The crowd cleared after 9ish well duh cause who has dinner that late? It is VERY, VERY loud in the restaurant. Felt like I was at a concert where I had to yell at my GF in order for us to have a conversation. They need to think about the spacing of the furniture and give people room to breathe. Our waiter was okay. He was friendly enough and was quick to apologize when something we ordered was not available.  \n\nAPPS: Ceviche Mixto [$17.95] The app was probably the best part of the meal... The mixto consisted of the \"catch of the day,\" calamari, shrimp & octopus. Great combo of flavors, but was a tad spicy for me. Would've enjoyed it more with chips, but sadly they ran out.\n\nENTREES: LENGUA [$13.95] came with 3 small pieces along with mashed potatoes. I've had plenty of lengua before & this dish was the worst I've had. They overcooked the tongue to where it straight up tasted like an Argentinian steak. Tongue is suppose to be softer & more tender than steak & this was not. The tongue was dipped in aji panca sauce (orange Peruvian pepper) which I disliked. Best thing about the plate was the mashed potatoes. I wanted rice for a side, but our waiter suggested TACU TACU [$4.95] which is rice & beans--I liked it! But not enough to raise the rating. It was was exactly what you think rice and beans would taste like mixed together. LOMO SALTADO [$20.95]  Had better. Meat was tough, but the sauce was good. Tasted like Beef Steak (Bistek for all you Filipinos out there) sauce.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend Limon for Peruvian eats. I'm sure there's better restaurants out there. With the crowd, the noise and the odd tasting dishes, it's just missed every mark it was suppose to hit. Don't do it.", "author": "Rana R."}

I recently experienced Limon at the Van Ness location and this place immediately became one of my SF favorites!\n\nThe go-to and absolute must is their signature chicken. The boyfriend and I shared the Half Chicken ($18.95) with Chifa Green Beans and Papas Fritas, Pollo Empanadas ($8.95), and Truffle Mac and Cheese ($10.95). The half portion of chicken is perfect for two with two pieces each. The green beans should definitely be the #1 pick for the side here too. I love how flavorful and crispy the green beans are along with the chicken. There's such good and saucy flavor in the seasoning of their ingredients. Of course, don't forget to dip literally everything in the aji amorillo huacatay sauce --so damn yummy! \n\nI was pretty excited to try the mac and cheese this time, but found it a-okay. The flavor was good, but it definitely could've been cheesier. The sauce was rather watery, which made the dish seem soupy. Even though that was disappointing, I was surprised with the empanadas. As someone who isn't a huge fan of them, the ones here was stuffed with delicious meats in a crispy and light pastry --loved it! I was a bit intimidated by the ingredients in the carne one with things like raisins, boiled egg, and olives, but was rather surprised that it was boldly meaty of beef inside instead.\n\nLastly, our party of 6 went through three pitchers of sangria ($35 each). It turned out pretty pricey in the end, but great for sharing and groups. The pitcher served a good 8 glasses, so it was worth it. Overall, yummy and tasty Peruvian food with amazing rotisserie chicken. A bit pricey, but worth the splurge every once in awhile.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

The reviews for both location aren't outstanding, but we went purely from word of mouth. Parking was none existent at the old location, as we circled the building ten times and gave up and came to this location. Again, parking was a B and it took some time. About twenty minutes later, we decided to go to the parking garage and just walk. As we turned the corner we found a parking space. $10 later, we were finally on our way....\nIt smelt so bad on the streets, as the streets were filled with a bunch of homeless people and human feces... We passed a bunch of furniture shops as well as other latin joints that were filled for the Saturday lunch hour. We had arrived to the pinpointed location on yelp, but no limon in sight. I had to ask the lady who was outside hosting for another restaurant. She pointed two doors down and said that was limon. We had passed it up acouple times because of the construction that was happening from what appears to be apartments/condos above the building. There was no signs outside the door to indicate that this was indeed Limon. Enough with that, we were greeted by the host who was quick to get us seats. There was only one other couple at the restaurant so I was a bit skeptical at this point. As my bf got up to go to the bathroom, I kindly asked the waitress if they did anything for birthdays. She said yes and asked which dessert I wanted and said they'd write happy birthday on it. \nSoon after, what appeared to be our server came out to take our order. He started with our drinks in which I got the coffee liquor special, not sure of the name. Bf went with a guava lime mule. The bf got half chicken with two sides. We decided on soy sauce green beans and sweet potato fries. I went with the traditional Lomo Saltado. Mac n cheese for sharing to complete our order. \n\nEverything came out as planned. My bf's mule was excellent. My coffee was good, but the liquor infused whipped cream threw the drink off. \n\nMy lomo saltado was overly salted and the jasmin rice was over cooked. There is always something wrong with my plate! The meat itself was cooked in soy sauce. It was basic and topped off with red onions to make the dish appear like I got a good portion. For $20something, I would pass on this the next time I am here.\n\n$30 Half chicken was so soft that the ones fell right out. The green beans had a great crunch to them and the sweet potato fries were cooked just right.\n\nMac n cheese was just so cheesy. (my fav). It was worth the $10! \n\nDuring the entire time, our server was stuck behind the bar. We finished our food and just sat and waited. I didn't want to make a scene that we were waiting for the birthday surprise. They finally brought it out. No happy birthday on it. (I hate when people tell me they'll do things, but they don't) The brownie was soft and not overly sweet. It was served with a side of ice cream. \n\nAs the bill came out, I was not expecting to pay for the little brownie. When I ask if the restaurant does anything for birthdays, it's typically complimentary. Anyway, not a big deal, but would have been nice if that was mentioned. It took a while for the server to come back to pick up the check. The food was good, but the service was a bit lacking, espically because the restaurant wasn't busy.", "author": "Emily L."}

I'm definitely biased because of so many great memories at this restaurant with great new friends in a new city. SF  is such an amazing foodie place, and this should be on every tourist list for hidden neighborhood local gems, if it's not already. Prepare yourself for some mouthwatering dishes with insanely good flavors.\n\nI've had just about everything on the menu, and you really can't go wrong. The place is served family style, typically, so everyone can try each dish (highly encouraged). \n\nNomz: Start with the Ceviche de Pulpo y Camarones ($17.95) - actually, all the ceviches are amazing - so take your pick. Definitely order a few empanadas ($8.95), and some Yucca Fries ($4.95). We usually split either a half or full chicken depending on party size ($18/$29). So tender and juicy, it's one of the best chickens I've ever had. Hands down. The Paella is on point so definitely add that in the mix. Poke Loko ($14.95) is a tasty cold dish to get, and don't forget the chimichuri sauce on the side - it seriously goes good with every dish so get a few for the table. \n\nNote: the plates aren't too large, so make sure to order double if you start going through the dishes. Your waiter will most likely recco that if you had a certain amount of people.\n\nDrink fave: They have their signature red Sangria ($7/glass, $35/pitcher) but definitely try at least one Pisco Sour ($13). Their signature Peruvian drink, and they have 3 flavor options. \n\nTip: You can bring your own wine if you want, corkage few $15/bottle.\n\nThis place is also great for lunch, too. Totally different scene when the sun is out (or Carl, for that matter) and it's more relaxing.

Let's take things in that order?\n\nPeruvian food was all the hotness a few years back, and I'm glad that it was given more attention. Some of the nuanced, regional dishes are still harder to find, and who even knows if you can get chifa (but then again, I'll take straight-up Chinese over the Peruvian stuff any day) but you're probably still going to find the staples--the pollo a la brasa, lomo saltado, anticuchos--at a lot of the new crop of Peruvian places.\n\nWe ordered some of that pollo, because it seems a crime not to. Rotisserie chicken did me right. So juicy, so flavorful, and I love the salty outside and sweet, tender inside. I as puzzled at the truffle mac n' cheese. Is this a Peruvian thing? I dunno, but I heard it was good so we ordered it. Confirmed.\n\nHere's the real rub, though. Maybe I was a little tired from travels, but I was eager to leave when my meal was done. It's SO LOUD in there, and they pack in the tables really close together. Where I was catching up with a friend, it was just the wrong choice.

I'd like to think I can still hang with the hip crowd; I've spent many a night in loud establishments hanging with homies.

There was the right amount of cheese and it was realllll gouda (idk if they used gouda cheese, just saying it for the pun, sorry). The truffle taste really accentuated the fish and ugh the texture.

The sauce offered a slight sour and acidic taste that went well with the ceviche. It wasn't quite my cup of tea, so I don't think I would order it again, but if you like ceviche, then this would be a good pick!\n\nLomo Saltado (4/5): the sauce on this was so good, it made me even eat the cooked onions and tomatoes (which i normally don't do, whoops). The beef tenderloin was also amazing and not dry at all, a good amount of chewy and melt going on with it. Oh and the fries, I mean, I can't hate on the fries, they were such a twist, but in a great way. The only downfall of this dish was the rice, it was slightly mushy and took away from the flavors of the dish, and just didn't taste quite fresh unfortunately. \n\nService was nice, but we did have to wait awhile for our truffle mac and cheese and I had to ask, after we had almost finished our first two dishes, on whether or not we were getting it (i'm very glad that we got it, because oh my was that the highlight of that meal).

For food we got the mushrooms and the half chicken with tacu tacu and green beans. Mushrooms are the perfect appetizer dish! The creamy sauce is so tasty, we made sure to save it to dip our chicken in. Chicken is cooked perfectly and a half is the perfect size for 2 people.

Having also recently traveled to Peru, I've decided Limon is pretentious and overpriced for Peruvian food.\n\nUsually order:\n-whole chicken: these are the teeny tiniest chickens you'll ever see, and kind of dry\n-green beans and tacu tacu: salty AF\n-sangria: watered down\n-ceviche trio: this is actually quite fresh and delicious, request more chips when you run out \n-paella: mushy, I preferred the hard crusty-bottom and this variation without was mediocre at best\n-poke: good! A rare larger serving size\n\nThe worst part of my recent experience at Limon was the unexpected cake cutting fee! I had bought and brought a cake for my friend's birthday dinner at Limon. And when we asked for a knife to cut it, they told us about the cutting fee. 2 dollars per slice! It seemed outrageous and unwarranted. \n\nAlso!! They charge $3 for taro chips.

The Leche de Tigre ceviche was so bomb but so SPICY... it's a bummer that their chip to ceviche ratio was a little low. They only gave 2 chips, what the heck?! And then you're charged extra when you ask for more. Please serve more chips with your ceviche!!!!\n\nI do agree with some of the yelpers - it's really loud in there.

When the chicken came out, we questioned whether it was a whole chicken because it looked much smaller this time around and it wasn't as juicy as I remembered either. The sides were okay; i suggest the rice and beans and the fries out of everything. The sangria here is also way too sweet, so just stick with a wine if that's what you're feeling. \n\nI consider the chicken to be the best main course on the menu and it really disappointed me.

However, the chicken that comes with two sides lived up to the hype along with the sweet potato fries and green beans.

Our group ordered the half chicken with rice and green beans, chicharron with beans and rice, grilled octopus on top of a bed of mash, paella, 2 carne empanadas with their house yellow sauce and bread pudding.\n\nEverything was made to perfection. The chicken was full of flavor and very moist. The chicharron had a terrific crunch with a tender inside. The octopus was grilled enough where it was crisp and not chewy. The paella melts in your mouth like butter.  The empanadas had a flakey dough with a wonderful filling.  The yellow dipping sauce was out of this world.  The bread pudding... well let's just say I didn't share it!!!\n\n5/5: Service was quick.

My co-worker had recently been telling me about this amazing Peruvian place that makes delicious lomo saltado (for $17.95) and it happened to be the very place I had on my bookmark list for months. \n\nSince my lunch is only an hour we decided on take out. When I first opened up my to-go box, it really didn't look very spectacular and the portion was on the smaller side. However, my first bite was addictingly magical.  The rice was cooked perfectly and absorbed the delicious meat and sauce juices. The sirloin steak was juicy, the bell peppers, tomatoes, French fries, and sauces married so well!  This dish was delicious. Like one of the best lomo saltado dishes I have had. The only minor detail was that it was on the salty side for me, but thankfully the jasmine rice was a nice neutral carb to soften the saltiness. Overall, great dish that I would love to come back for. Next time I would love to sit in the restaurant as it has great ambiance with an open kitchen and bar so that you can really immerse yourself and soak up the scene.", "author": "Melissa N."}

Warning - they put most large groups upstairs and due to the building's structure, it gets very very noisy. However, it's great this restaurant is able to accommodate such large groups. We did a walk in with 12 of us (yes, a bold move) and they were still able to seat us within an 1.5hr on a Saturday night. \n\nAs for the food, they definitely have some decent options. The cerviche is pretty up to par, and the fries are pretty tasty, as well as the empanadas. Of course, the rotisserie chicken is also pretty yum if you're interested in that. However, we ordered a set meal (as we were such a big group). I thought most items were good but the value could have been better. Although we had quite a few drinks, I thought what the bill tab was pretty expensive for what we got. \n\nOverall, a pretty good, but not amazing choice for dinner. If you have large group, go for it. You'll get a good dinner and a restaurant that will accommodate for the madness. However, IF you are looking for something low key for a small to mid sized group, I would suggest maybe searching for something else.", "author": "Grace A."}

Each piece of lengua is so tender and delicate (Three long pieces of lengua). A must for lengua lovers like myself.\n\nCamote Fries - Basically sweet potato fries. It was pretty good but nothing spectacular.\n\nYuka Fries - Now these are worth getting. Long, fried, crispy cassava fries that will keep you wanting to reach in for the next one right after the first. Wondering if blue cheese dressing sauce would go well with this.\n\nTried someone else's chicken and wow, it was totally tender and juicy. A must try for next time and yes I know its their staple. \n\nDessert - \n\nCo-worker said the bread pudding was a must and it certainly was. One of the better bread puddings I've had and definitely takes care of craving for one. It was baked with care and skill as it was still very most inside and had a surprisingly terrific crunch on the outer layer. It also comes with refreshing vanilla gelato on top.

She even offered to make the lomo saltado with gluten free soy sauce and without French fries that could cross contaminate. We had the ceviche trio sampler which was perfectly spicy and fresh. The meat in the lomo saltado had the char you taste in Peru. The pollo a la brasa was flavorful and moist. Piaco spurs were delicious and not skimpy.

After many years, have finally decided to write a review.\n\nI always come here with a group of 5 or more, so we order everything from the menu. If you are thinking of sharing food, you'll need to order 2 of everything, the portion and price ratio are mismatched, so Yelp should update to three dollar signs.\n\nThe ambiance is weird, they'll play hip-hop/top 40 music which is unwanted and unexpected for a Peruvian restaurant. They have 1.5 floors, a bit dim, tables are small and when they bring your order, they force everything onto the table leaving no room at all.\nOther restaurant kitchens are smarter, will think about this, and only serve what can fit on the table. Then make the rest so it's freshly made.\n\nVery casual place, decent for kids, but can get incredibly loud; so, not very good for a first date or private conversations.\n\nThings are decent from the menu, but stay away from...\n- Lomo Saltado. It's always overbearingly smoky and w/ a strong \"vinegary\" flavor, tastes nothing like the real thing.\n- Ceviche is hit or miss many times, never consistent (avoid the Mixto and get the pescado/fish).\n- Arroz con Mariscos, flavor is there, but many times encountered raw/hard rice.\n- Empanadas, nothing to write home about, but it is missing filling.\n- Yuca Fries, they used to give sauce with this, not anymore, expect to pay $2 per condiment/sauces or bring your own.\n- Pollo a la Brasa, it's alright, a bit dry at times. If you want rotisserie chicken try it from Morning Due Cafe, it's delicious.\n\nIf you really want to try Limon, go to the one on S. Van Ness (a bit better). But don't expect true Peruvian flavors.\nReason I keep coming here is because it is close to where I live.\n\nNote: I'm Peruvian/Chinese.", "author": "Aaron C."}

My mama's cooking(and that of my tias) is on point all day erryday. In the last two decades, as americanos discovered our cuisine, I've held my breath that our food wouldn't be rendered bland or deconstructed beyond recognition in an effort to appeal to the masses.  Limon has kept our flavors intact while providing an upscale experience.  \nOne of my closest friends recently wanted to treat me to a celebration dinner.  When I suggested the Mission location, she made a reservation via Open Table so mini-me and I headed into the City for a girls' night out.  Though we couldn't be seated until our party was complete(my friend's work meeting ran late) and the little wasn't comfortable sitting at the bar, we had a dinner to remember.  We began with drinks including the evening's special, a strong Pina Colada.  The little one had chicha morada. I ordered chicken empanadas as our appetizer. Usually my daughter dislikes the meat pies; she says they are large and heavy.  These were small, light, and airy. The chicken was tender and well-seasoned and the aji amarillo was mild but tasty.  Needless to say, my daughter has become an empanada fan.  \nThen dinner arrived. My daughter had the truffle mac and cheese but once she tried my arroz de mariscos, she was happy to share.  Our server checked in often to make sure our cocktail was adequately strong, made our waters were full, and even took my friend's fries back as they had been slightly cool.  \nThe crowd is a mixture of hipsters on dates, families, and large parties celebrating birthdays or chilling after work.  Still, there is a distinctly down to earth vibe.  Definitely reppin Peruvian cuisine for the SF foodie scene in a way that this Peruvian-American digs.", "author": "Julie C."}

Came for a friend's birthday and shared three dishes, family style. We ordered a whole chicken (with yuca fries and veggies for our sides), truffle mac n cheese, and lomo saltado. Also ordered a pitcher of sangria. Everything was good. The chicken was tasty and came with a sauce that I loved. The truffle mac n cheese was also good, although I do wish it was more cheesy as opposed to a wet creamy texture. The beef in the lomo saltado was excellent. I liked how it was cooked medium rare and so chewy. Very saucey too. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the mango panna cotta and that was the perfect thing to end our meal.

While I did not have their rotisserie chicken, I did have their Chicharr\u00f3n de Pollo and Polli - Pappas. \n\nThe food rating of this restaurant is a 3.5. The chicken was fried well and not greasy. The accompanying sauce for the Chicharr\u00f3n de Pollo was a lim\u00f3n soy sauce, which was a little sour and salty, and went well with it. The Polli - Papas was the same fried chicken, but tossed with french fries, cheese, and a muddled spicy peruvian aioli mustard. The french fries were a little soggy, and the sauce a little heavy. I have no complaints about the chicken however, there was a decent amount and it was good quality. It seems like good bar food, to accompany a beer or something similar. Don't go here expecting a full meal, it is more of a casual \"peruvian\" after-work spot to grab drinks and some munchies. \n\nThe value rating of this restaurant is a 3. The dish sizes were not worth the prices, as they are expected to be ordered \"family style\" to offer a variety to a party of multiple people. \n\nI find this location of Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie to be a little cramped and loud, I was barely able to hear my girlfriend from across the table.\n\nOverall, don't come here looking for a meal, think more a casual gathering with drinks and snacks. I would come back considering their chicken, but recommend their other location on Van Ness Avenue, SF instead.", "author": "Ryan D."}

Double date at Lim\u00f3n on a Friday night? And just maybe a trip to Tartine for dessert after? My husband and I were totally game! \n\nWe had the foresight to reserve a table on Yelp and I'm glad we did! The place quickly filled up around 6:30 and you'd be waiting for a while if you did not have a reservation. I'm also glad we chose the Lim\u00f3n on Valencia, as it is bigger and brighter than the one on South Van Ness. We were relegated to the basement when we ate at SVN location and that to me was not ideal. \n\nFor drinks, I ordered a Pisco Sour, my friend the Lychee Sour and her husband one of the Peruvian beers. The Sours were quite good and boozy to my surprise. My friend and I really enjoyed our cocktails.\n\nFor food, we ordered a few things and ate them family-style. I loved the Tartara de Tuna last time, so that and the Mushroom Empanada were our starters. Unfortunately, we felt the Tartara de Tuna was a bit deficient in flavor. Very muted flavor, so I didn't love it this time. The Mushroom Empanada, on the other hand, was wonderful! It is fried, not baked, but it was good. It was crunchy and lots of mushrooms inside. Our friends loved this. It came with one of their sauces, so dip it in the sauce by all means. So good! \n\nWe ordered half of the Pollo a la Brasa and the Lomo Saltado for our mains. My friends loved both. They didn't think that rotisserie chicken can be that interesting, but they felt that Limon's version is definitely something special, especially with the sauces it came with. So glad we ordered the Tacu Tacu and vegetables for our sides with the chicken this time around. The veggies were very tasty and the Tacu Tacu was great. We all loved the Lomo Saltado too. Chunks of nicely seasoned beef on top of fries and drenched with a gravy--what's not to like? \n\nIt was a great double date at Lim\u00f3n! We skipped dessert as Tartine was calling me.

I am confident they cooked the rice separately from the rice and assembled it at the end, so there is no valid excuse. \n\n\nLE-VERDICT:\n\nIn the end, I picked my take out box clean. \n\nAnytime a restaurant crafts seafood that is not overcooked and is well assembled for takeout, I am impressed. The reason it is not 5 star is for the 2 cons. I am very opinionated about Paella.

I ask a quick question about the short ribs and Sole. He recommends the Sole, and I order it. Then the short ribs show up. I explain I didn't order them.  Then the waiter comes over and tries to force the short ribs on me. I reminded him of our conversation and his Sole recommendation and my order. He then remembers, oh yeah you did order the Sole...wtf that was a waste of 10 minutes.

So my friend and I followed her and pleasantly enjoyed our meal and sangria. Limon is a great mix of classy and casual so I guess you can call it classual. \n\nTo start, the chicken at Limon is a MUST - and also the best for big groups. Depending on how big your group is, you can get half a chicken to a full chicken and 2 sides (4 if you have a bigger group). The chicken is seasoned well and can be a little salty for some peoples palate but it goes very well with their sauces! Also highly suggest the yuca fries and veggies to cut down the heaviness of everything. \n\nBesides their chicken, the ceviche is just okay and the arroz con mariscos (basically their paella) is a very great portion but it can sometimes have a weird consistency. Again, I highly suggest washing down everything with some sangria or one of their beverages, but Limon is a great date night or group dinner kind of place.

I have to say that I left Lim\u00f3n feeling happy, warm, and satisfied with my new food baby. I really can't give this place a terrible rating because all the other workers were incredibly friendly, and the food was just SO FRICKIN GOOD. Don't leave Lim\u00f3n without ordering the famous Pollo a la Brasa. It's tender, flavorful, and juicy. YUM! We ordered a half chicken and it was enough for everyone to sample a good amount of meat. \n\nWe also ordered the following:  \n- Pitcher of Sangria: awesome. The drink service was TOO good -- they kept refilling our glasses to the brim, but some of our party wanted to drink less than others so we had to re-adjust the amounts afterwards. \n- Chicharron de Pollo (crispy pieces of chicken): a bit dry, but the sauce was flavorful and complemented the chicken. \n- Empanadas: Pollo and Queso -- warm, rich, and crunchy/creamy in all the right places. \n- Ceviche Mixto (fish, calamari, and tiger shrimp): fresh and flavorful! \n- Lomito Saltado (stir-fry sirloin strips with fries and onions): good flavor, but chewy and a bit salty -- probably from the soy sauce. Make sure to eat this one fast because the fries get soggy from all the juice! \n- Polli-Papas (crispy pieces of chicken with fries and cheese): greasy and cheesy -- reminded me more of bar food, but delicious in its own right. \n\nFor the sides, we got yuca fries and Tacu-Tacu. Both. Are. Delicious. \n\nThey also forgot about our half chicken order and we had to remind them 45 minutes after we started eating before they finally brought it out. When they did, the server profusely apologized and took the charge off our order, which I highly appreciate. \n\nAn hour-long wait for a reservation is very, very unimpressive, but since the food was so good, I'll probably be back again soon -- although maybe I'll check out the other location on South Van Ness.", "author": "Christine L."}

We weren't ready yet (we'd been in the restaurant for about 5 mins at this point) and she stomped off frustrated without saying a word. At this point we all figured she must have has a hard night, and left it at that.\n\n50 minutes later (so, 55 minutes into our reservation) our bill came, which we signed immediately. The total was $230 which is expensive, but expected for a party of 6. Less than 5 minutes later another waiter came by and told us that, \"they had many other reservations and would appreciate it if we would hurry up.\" They were kicking us out, and we hadn't even finished our drinks yet, let alone been there for an hour!\n\nIn all of my years of living in SF and LA, I'd never been as embarrassed as I was in that moment. It put a serious damper on the night, and even after talking to the manager he was unapologetic and frankly didn't care that we had just been booted from the restaurant before we were done with our meal.\n\nEveryone please be aware of this restaurant, especially during busy periods. There are many places with great food, but experience is everything.", "author": "John M."}

I've had it countless times and I was expecting this restaurant to be mediocre because of it's trendiness and atmosphere, but it pleasantly surprised me. \n\nWe ordered a chicken and a half for four of us with rice and beans, salad, sweet potato fries, and yucca. The sides (all except sweet potato fries) were really small, so we kinda had to ration it for all of us to enjoy. \n\nI did really like the chicken, although I have had much better in other Peruvian restaurants. This was my first time trying Peruvian in SF. The chicken was tender and salted nicely with enough flavor that still manages to beat out all other rotisserie chicken.

I went into the Van Ness location for a valentine's day lunch with my boyfriend. Due to a \"technical difficulty\" at the location, the hostess sent us over to the Valencia location and assured us we'd be seated. I was so hungry, but had set my heart on the menu at Lim\u00f3n. Took us about 15 minutes to walk over. We were seated within 10 minutes on a busy afternoon.\n\nFood: We started with the Ceviche Mixto and Empanadas de Pollo. My boyfriend wasn't in the food for seafood, so I killed it by myself. Really fresh and delicious. Great presentation and attention to detail, but even more attention to the robust flavors. The seafood medley was extremely fresh & juicy. However, it ironically lacked, \"limon.\" I asked for extra lime. I really liked the nuts, it gave the dish greater texture. The empanadas were good, but I wish they had more pollo. I ordered the Arroz con Mariscos, which is like a Peruvian style paella, but so much better than paella. The rice for one is a lot more buttery, without being super oily. It's not sticky or mushy, just perfectly cooked. It comes with shrimp, mussels and some veggies. Extremely savory & full of flavor. I highly recommend this dish if you're a seafood aficionado. My boyfriend ordered the seco de costillas, boneless beef short ribs with potatoes & carrots.. it was essentially a beef stew. This was probably the only dish we didn't like. We couldn't really figure out what the broth was supposed to taste like, because it was overly salty. I had to douce this dish was lime in order to create some balance. The meat was tender and juicy, but a bit fattier than we'd like. I'd pass on this one next time. \n\nService: The food was great, but service was not. They were very busy, however, I had to ask three different people for water three different times. 20 minutes later, my water came, because my boyfriend got up and asked for it. I guess standing up is key. My server never brought me half of what I asked her for, we had to have the busboys get it for us (after 2-3 times of asking). I understand that it was v-day and it was busy, but we felt extremely neglected the majority of the time we dined. \n\nPrice: Great food, but portions are not the greatest. I did order multiple seafood dishes, but my main entree could have came with more seafood for the price I paid. Larger portions, please.\n\nAmbiance: Larger than the Van Ness location. Clean, modern, simple & lively environment overall.\n\nOverall: Lim\u00f3n has a wide menu with tons of apps, small plates & main entrees... and if you want to drink, the entire backside of the menu is just for drinks. Although prices are steep, the food is absolutely delicious & authentic. Aside from the terrible customer service experience, I'd come back for the food & hope that I'm acknowledged more by my server.", "author": "Astrid Z."}

Very happy with the bartender's recommendation. \n\nPer the menu, the La Bomba del Amor consists of vodka, orange liqueur, lemon juice, prickly pear and passion fruit. It's deliciously smooth and fruity, with a sourness level approaching that of a Jolly Rancher watermelon hard candy, but with tropical notes from the passion fruit.\n\nHard to describe but I would say it's somewhat similar to Original Joe's untraditional interpretation of a Hurricane cocktail, albeit much more natural-tasting (Limon likely uses better and fresher ingredients) and is thus less treacly/sugary/artificially syrupy (but yeah, it's undeniably on the sweet side). In a nutshell, liquified boozy candy, in the best possible way. So good!\n\nMy one and only criticism would be with *how* it was served. La Bomba del Amor really ought to be served chilled, without ice, in a martini glass (or at least more elegant glassware and not something that I associate with Lipton Tea (see photo)). \n\nRegardless, I'll definitely be ordering the La Bomba again during return visits (and there will be many!) and maybe the bartenders will be willing to oblige if I ask for it served chilled with no ice in a different vessel :D. \n\nWe also had a pitcher of the house sangria; delicious as always and reasonably priced.

I've eaten there before and always enjoyed the food. However, the atmosphere is a bit off-putting. We were sat in the middle of a section where the tables were so close that it was difficult to get through and you were forced to hear your neighbors. There were plenty of other seats available so, we requested a change because it was difficult to hold a conversation. The hostess stated that they could not move us because the seats were reserved. I have worked as a hostess and I understand that sometimes you can't seat people where they want but in an empty restaurant, making zero effort to accommodate started off the meal on a unpleasant note. Our server was very nice and the food came quickly. However, our meal was completely spoiled by a drunk couple groping eachother and making out loudly in a table close by. My partner couldn't look at me without seeing them behind us and we both lost our appetites. Usually the behavior of other customers would not impact my feelings about a place but the hostess refused to move us or say anything to the couple even after multiple tables asked.", "author": "Mimi G."}

I felt like Colin Kapernick calling plays in Seattle with the 12th man.  I know that a lot of the hipptity-doo-da restaurants are all like this now but I don't know how or why this decimal level is appropriate for dining. \n\nThat being said I came with a group of 7.  Limon has the main floor and also a second loft floor so there is plenty of tables and seating for large groups.  We were provided with menus and our drinks orders were taken very soon after.  As far as food we ordered:\n\nChichirron de Pollo:  this little deep fried pieces of chicken were tasty.  Some were a bit dry so a dipping sauce would help.  But a great starter dish.\n\nTruffle Mac n Cheese:  my wife and the rest of our group liked this dish.  I'm a tough judge when it comes to mac n cheese,  I'll just say it's ok.\n\nLomo Saltado:  Everybody's go-to dish at a peruvian restaurant.   Limon's version is decent but comes in a small portion for $13.95.\n\nCeviche: as Popeye would say \"I am what I am.\"  The ceviche is what is it is..\n\nThe service was lacking at different times during our ordering and meal.  But one aspect that left a sour taste in my mouth besides the ceviche was that the guy busing the table was clearing out the table while we are all sitting down eating.  He proceeded to spill some of the liquid on one of our entrees all over my wife's dress.  When I said something to him he acted like he could care less.  \n\nThe food at Limon was decent tasting.  I found the dishes to be overpriced for what we got and quality-wise.  The volume of the restaurant for me was uncomfortable and as mentioned earlier the service was poor.  Overall I can pass on coming to Limon again.  There's too many good restaurants in the area to give them my business again.", "author": "Michael L."}

The host said that we would need to let our table go in an hour and fifteen, so we sat at the bar because my friend and I had not seen each other in a while and did not want to be rushed. Jokes on us. Somehow the bartender/server came up to use rudely about 5 times in 5 minutes to pressure us to order. This is after we order sangria/ceviche immediately after sitting down.

Reservation accommodations went from a party of 3 to a party of 6 & a baby, so we had to change up our restaurant last minute. On a Monday night around 4pm, I was able to call Lim\u00f3n and make a reservation for our party at 6pm.\n\nI had never before experience Peruvian (tapas) before so I didn't really know what to expect. But literally all the dishes we ordered were DELICIOUS, we couldn't stop talking about how everything was amazing. \n\nThe birthday celebrant, BF, and I started with a glass of white sangria each [$6/glass] - wish it was stronger, but I'll try the red one next time. For the food, we started the ceviche mixto as an appetizer - mix of fish, calamari and shrimp - with the most tasty lemon and juice mixture [$14.95] - amazing, fresh, and delicious. \n\nWe then went ahead and order the white half chicken (4 pieces) with 2 choices of sides and the \"aji\" sauces [$16]. For the sides we went for the yuca fries and tacu-tacu (sauteed rice & beans). The chicken was surprisingly moist and tender and went well with the sides, for the sauce, my favorite was the green one (chimichurri). \n\nTo pair with the chicken, we ordered the Arroz con Mariscos - Peruvian style paella made w/ safffron rice, mixture of seafood, aji amarillo pimento sauce [$17.95] - one of the best paella's I've had in life, we ordered it twice. The rice was cooked thoroughly so it wasn't hard, but not overcooked where the rice was mushy. The seafood was plentiful in the dish and fresh.\nWe then turned to the small hot plates, and asked our server how many each plate feeds - he mentioned 3 or 4 depending on serving sizes. So we went ahead and ordered 3 different plates: \n1) \"Lomito\" Saltado - dish with stir-fried sirloin strips, onions, tomato, soy sauce, & french fries [$13.95] \n\n2) Jalea - mixture of crispy seafood, yucca, salsa criolla served with huacatay tartar sauce [$13.95] - this was basically peruvian style calamari, delicious! \n\n3) Chicharron de Pollo - crispy pieces of chicken marinated in soy sauce, Garlic, Aji Amarillo, served with salsa criolla [$11.95] - slightly salty, but tasty nonetheless (you definitely need floss after this one)\n\nLastly, we went with the empanadas based on the yelp reviews, and went with the veggie empanadas (mushroom, spinach, choclo and mascarpone cheese) [2 pieces for $8.95]. Glad we got the veggies since everything else we ordered had some type of protein in it. These were crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside. \n\nTo end our delicious meal, we went ahead and ordered dessert - the bandido which was basically chocolate cake and ice cream [$9.95] and the mango panna cotta [$9.95] which was like a flan with mango puree, just not as sweet (which I loved). \n\nFor all of this, and a few dishes we ordered a 2nd time, our check came out to about $250 w/ gratuity included. \n\nAll in all, our dining experience at Lim\u00f3n was delicious. Though I wished our server, Angel, interacted with us more, especially since we were a larger party, the food made up for the service.", "author": "Kathleene E."}

The lengua a la parrilla is outstanding, the beef tongue is both crispy and tender and a very unique mix of tastes. The chicharron de pollo is very well nuanced and a great entree as well.

Given her South American heritage I was thrilled when she strongly vouched for Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie - a Peruvian gastronomic experience.\n \nDue to the haphazard and uncertain nature of our planning, we decided to roll the dice with this place, make reservations first (we got 9PM unfortunately) and show up early to see if we could score a seat at the bar or swipe that of a no-show. The latter of which was a laughable thought, as folks in SF don't miss out on their resos at Lim\u00f3n I learned, so we arrived and were fortunate enough to grab a seat at the bar.\n\nIt's a hive of activity to put it mildly, even on a Sunday evening the tables are packed, and the line up of folks trying to get a seat is lengthy. Aesthetically the place is uber modern and aside from the Latin American influences behind the bar and on the menu, you'd be hard pressed to distinguish this spot from any other \u00fcber modern restaurant spot. All the same, it's definitely a \"hot spot\" and very contemporary.\n\nEnough story, now what about the food and drink. Well I let me dc lead the way and order us a round of Pisco Sours to start ($10 each). Now I must say that heavy citrus-based alcohol beverages do wreak havoc on my acid indigestion, so if you're like me, I'd steer clear. Despite being a delicious palate pleaser; by the end of my first drink I was feeling the burn (literally). My next drink choice, and the one that got me through the rest of my meal, was a glass of their sangria ($6), which I found to be made with a great easy drinking red wine and was chalk full of ice and fruits, always a fave of mine.\n\nLim\u00f3n has a wide array of tapas style sharable plates so we decided to share 3 dishes and see how we felt after. We started with the Lomito saltado ($12.95), and while I remember it being delicious, sadly I cannot remember for the life of me what was in it. Following that we had the Ceviche mixto ($12.95) which I can clearly recall all the wonderful raw fish elements in it but specifically liked the scallops covered wonderfully in traditional Ceviche lime juices and herbs. Then came the third tapas which was a plate of Truffle Mac & cheese ($6.75). What more can I say about this dish... Mac & Cheese done with truffle oils and thick, delicious cheese sauce. Damn. Definitely NOT a Peruvian dish by far BUT hearty and delicious in a stick to your ribs kinda way - YUM-O!\n\nBy the time this final plate was done, we were stuffed. I think 3 plates is the perfect number for 2 guests and I would recommend upping your plate total from there accordingly for every guest in your party.\n\nEatcrest Out!", "author": "Kris U."}

We also got pitchers of the white sangria for $30. A good price when split between 4 people. \n\nI am giving this place a lower rating because of my experience. a large party was sat by us, overall they were fine but the leader of the group definitely altered our experience. He was riding a Segway type thing around the restaurant and calling the hostess sugar tits. When we asked the hostess about him and voiced our concerns, she said that everything at their table had been paid for and that he was brought in for promotional reasons.\n\nI understand that a restaurant wants to bring attention and publicity to their restaurant, but allowing a guest to affect other patrons' experiences is unacceptable. I also understand that sometimes restaurants can't control who comes in, and for that reason I wouldn't have let this guests behavior affect the rating had he just been another guest. However, since he was there for promotional reasons and the restaurant chose for him to be there, this is another story.\n\nI hope that Limon keeps this in mind for the future.

The empanadas were the star of the meal - super well-cooked and a really yummy sauce. I wish there were more empanadas instead of just two in an order! The beef was okay. I'm not a great judge of beef, but it was very tender and not too salty. The mushrooms were just okay. I thought they could have been seasoned better. \n\nThe seafood paella was a little too sauce-y for my taste. And since it was seafood paella, the fishy taste pervaded the whole entree.

Their most ordered dish is their slow roasted chicken, which we got a half order of to share with yuca fries and vegetales saltado for our sides. The chicken size you order also affects the size of the two complementary sides you get. The dark meat of the chicken was delicious, but the white meat could've been executed better. It was a bit dry, but definitely still delicious thanks to the sauces they bring for the chicken. This was the very first time I've had Yuca fries and they were SO good!! Lightly fried, crunch yet soft in the middle - this is my ideal fry. The vegetales (veggies) were fine. Nothing special. \n\nWe also ordered truffle Mac and cheese, which was really good as well and would recommend as a small plate to have next to the chicken. My one disappointment with this dish was that it got more watery as I kept eating it, think the sauce got diluted on the bottom... but minor detail. \n\nLastly - drinks. Probably the most disappointing part of my meal. We got a red and white wine sangria respectively and it was very watered down. My hypothesis is that a lot of ice melted already prior to serving...

Definitely one of those places where you have to shout across the table to speak. People must really like their drinks or the lounge-y vibe because this place is thriving and it's not because of the lackluster food.   \nThe food looked tasty on the plate but it was just really uninspired and lacked flavor. Maybe we should have ordered the pollo a la brasa because none of the dishes we ordered really stood out. We got \"the usual:\" lomo saltado, leche de tigre, emapanadas and a seafood paella. The paella tasted pretty gross btw. The rice was hard (undercooked) and it didn't seem like the flavors had sunk in yet. I would not recommend this dish to people who like rice and paella dishes.    \nI was a bit surprised and disappointed that they didn't have aji de gallina on the menu... It's my favorite Peruvian dish and I have seen it at every Peruvian restaurant I have been to: both chain Peruvian places and mom and pop places. \nService was atrocious. Our server (girl with dyed blonde hair who was in charge of the upstairs area on Saturday night) took our orders, but pretty much disappeared until it was time to bring the check... Other people brought out our food and we had to ask for water refills twice. (Their water cups are super tiny). I wanted to order a second lychee pisco because the first one was so good, but we couldn't find a server and the bussers who bring your food come and go so quickly you don't have time to say \"otro Pisco por favor.\"", "author": "Lani G."}

Really flavorful, tender, and moist. A half chicken was enough to share as an entree between two. One of the sides we got was rice and beans, a bit on the bland side, wouldn't order again. The mac n' cheese was also tasty. We got one of the ceviches, it had some type of nuts or grains in it, wasn't a huge fan. I got the lychee pisco sour, didn't like it at all and ended up not finishing it. My friend got the regular pisco sour, and it was much better. Had a glass of the Malbec that was very nice, and very reasonably priced at $10.\n\nWhile the food was overall enjoyable, the service was pretty terrible. We were sitting at the bar for dinner. Had to ask the bartender several times to get a glass of water. At one point he was on the opposite side of the bar talking to another staff member for several minutes and couldn't get his attention. Asked a passing waitress for the drink menu, and she replied that we would have to get it from the bartender since we were seated at the bar. After telling her  the bartender was being unresponsive, she reiterated we would have to wait for him. Ended up having to get up and walk over to the bartender to get his attention. Definitely a lower level of customer service than I would expect for a restaurant like this.\n\nThe ambiance is trendy and had a lot of energy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-23", "description": "Limon Rotisserie is incredibly popular and LOUD.  There are three locations in San Francisco.  I believe this one, in the Mission, is the original.  This is a modern Peruvian restaurant.\n\nAfter over 1,200 Yelp reviews, I've never used the term \"trendy hot spot\" to describe any business... until now.  I think Limon fits the bill, even though it's not a new restaurant.  Many of the customers look like they're ready for a big night on the town.\n\nThis is a casual sit-down restaurant with a bar, open kitchen, and contemporary design.  The furniture, art, and decor is bright, colorful, and Peruvian-themed.  There are two floors.  I recommend sitting on the second floor because it can provide a nice view of all the activity below (bar, kitchen, etc.).\n\nIf you couldn't guess from the name, Limon specializes in rotisserie chicken (\"pollo a la brasa\").  Expect to spend about $20 for a whole chicken, $12 for a half, and $10 for a quarter (white or dark meat).  The rest of Limon's menu consists of small, shareable plates, like tapas.  These plates typically range from $7 to $10 each.  It's affordable, which is one reason why so many people like coming here.\n\nI've tried the following items, all of which are generally pretty good:\n\nTartara de Tuna - ahi tuna tartare, roasted peppers, pinenuts, rocoto, sesame seed oil\nCeviche de Pescado - fresh red snapper\nJalea - mixture of crispy seafood, yucca, salsa criolla, huacatay tartar sauce\nChicharron de Pollo - crispy pieces of chicken marinated in soy sauce, garlic and aji amarillo, served with salsa criolla\n\"Lomito\" Saltado - Peruvian dish of stir-fried top sirloin strips, onions, tomato, soy sauce, fries\n\nThe tuna tartare is soft and succulent.  This dish is prepared with rocoto, which is a type of pepper from Central and South America.  The tartare patty is garnished on top and lays atop a few slices of cucumber.  A side of potato chips is served with this dish to provide a starch and crispy texture.\n\nMany consider the ceviche a must-order.  It is very good and prepared Peruvian style.  This means the seafood is accompanied with sliced onions, corn, and sweet potato.  I had the red snapper version and the fish was fresh.  Well-marinated, tangy, and refreshing.\n\nJalea is a Peruvian dish made of fried seafood.  In this case, fish and squid (similar to fried calamari).  It's lightly breaded.  It comes with salsa criolla, which is South American salsa composed of sliced onions, cilantro, and peppers, yucca root, and huacatay tartar sauce.  Huacatay is a type of herb which is turned into a paste and used in Peruvian cuisine.  Bits of crispy, roasted corn also accompany this dish.\n\nThe chicken chicharron is delicious and highly recommended.  These are like chicken nuggets or chicken tenders, but way better.  The breading isn't as heavy and is a darker golden brown in color.  Each piece of chicken is flavorful and tender.  A light, tasty dipping sauce comes with.\n\nThe \"lomito\" saltado dish is a cross between the lomito sandwich and the lomo saltado Peruvian sirloin dish.  This dish is a mish-mash of marinated sirloin strips, French fries, and sliced onions.  It's one of the heartier dishes on the menu with good chew and flavor.  The fries are soft/soggy because they've soaked up many of the plate's juices and sauce.\n\nThe presentation of the dishes is simple, stylish, and visually appealing.  A common theme among several of the dishes is the use of the aforementioned South American salsa criolla.  In fact, I think they may overuse it.\n\nService is fine.  Reservations are highly recommended.  Because of the popularity of this restaurant, you may not get seated immediately at your reservation time, but you do have priority over walk-ins, of which there are many.\n\nStreet parking can be a nightmare in this part of town, so consider parking at the garage at 42 Hoff Street, between 16th and 17th Streets.", "author": "Daniel B."}

The food here is AWFUL!!!\n\nI will semi-apologize ahead of time for not ordering the rotisserie chicken which everyone raves about.  But if that's the only thing a Peruvian restaurant can get right, they should just rename the restaurant to \"Only Rotisserie.\"\n\nI started out with the carne empanadas which are two pieces of about 3\" long and cost $7.95.  Pretty hefty for the dinky little things.  I'll admit the accompanying garlic aioli is good and you can save it for your other dishes if they don't snatch it off your table.  These were quite tasty but all I tasted was meat and no hard boiled eggs or raisins.\n\nNext was the Chicharron de Pollo ($11.95) which was overcooked and incredibly salty.  It comes with a tart dipping sauce which might be vinegar based which enhances the saltiness even more.  This was really bad.\n\nAfter this, we got a very standard Peruvian dish: Lomito Saltado ($11.95).  We asked if the french fries could be replaced with yuca fries but the server told us this wasn't possible because the yuca fries would disintegrate.  I've had yuca fries before and they aren't this weak... so I think he just didn't want to make the change for us.  We asked for the sirloin pieces to be cooked medium and it was cooked medium well and came out chewy.  This dish was also a bit on the salty side.\n\nBecause of all the salt, I was in desperate need of a salad so I ordered the Ensalada Mixta as an afterthought.  There were only two to choose from but this one sounded lighter. The description says you get roasted red beets which, on paper, is the highlight of this salad but you literally get TWO thin slices.  I thought that was a joke.  Other than that, this is your regular side salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, and two slices of avocado.  And yes, it's $7.95!\n\nOur waiter did his job well but he was very matter of fact and not a personality I'm dying to experience again.  Ambiance is nice with high ceilings and there's a long table in the middle that would be great for a birthday dinner but do you want your guests to celebrate your birthday with bad food?

The restaurant is also very loud making conversations as difficult as in a club. This is probably due to the design of the place, and there is not much that can be done about it now. In any case this is a very common issue with restaurants in the City. The only important thing for me to judge a restaurant by is the food and I have not had a bad meal here yet. \nThis stretch of Valencia is a lot different than when Limon first arrived in 2004, but still a favorite choice for when I want to sit-down  dining experience in the Mission as opposed to the many casual takeout places in this neighborhood.", "author": "Kevin S."}

Portion sizes can be a little small so it's best to order a couple of dishes to share. My group got a full chicken (dry and salty), which came with two sides. We choose Yuca fries (pretty good) and the Tacu-Tacu (saut\u00e9ed rice and beans), which was beyond salty. t also came with a couple of sauces for dipping - the chimichurri stood out to me as the best sauce. We also ordered the Tartara de Tuna (fresh, light, and delicious), \"Lomito\" Saltado (probably the best dish that we ordered - it was like a poutine with steak). Overall, the food just didn't live up to all of the hype. \n\nAlso, parking is very difficult to come by in the neighborhood - you're better off just parking at the 21st Street garage or uber or lyfting to the restaurant.", "author": "Jojo P."}

Some were waiting at the door for an open table, but because my friend had made a reservation, we were quickly seated and catered to. The staff members are all incredibly friendly and helpful; I have never been that happy with customer service in a while.  \n\nWe ordered some appetizers and a half chicken, which I was expecting to taste like Safeway's rotisserie chicken because honestly, I have low standards for food so I won't be disappointed. The chicken was amazing. Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie took it to a whole different level, especially with the three special sauces that came along with the dish. I was very content and will definitely be referring others to come here. \n\nThe only issue I had was the noise level, but it's something you can't control. It wasn't ideal for a first date, especially since I felt like I was screaming over the voices of others to be heard by my friend. Poor guy hahah. However, with an ambiance as great as Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie's, I'm not surprised people come here to socialize.

Weird thing is this restaurant opens at 12 on weekdays!  More start-ups are opening in Mission so I find it a little odd that they don't open at least at 11:30.  Anywhoo, my co-worker and I were waiting for him at our table since he was running late.  One of the waiters approached us after another waiter did and said something like, \"The restaurant gets really busy, are you sure that you don't want to put any order in now?\"  There were only about two other occupied tables, that was a little odd.\n\nI decided on getting the 1/4 dark meat with my two accompanying sides being the sauteed veggies and the papas fritas.  My dining companions got the 1/4 white meat with yucca fries and rice.  They accidentally brought me white meat, but because I feared that it would be a little dry, I told them of this and they switched it out  accordingly.  My chicken was moist and the side portions were plentiful at least mine was.  The guys' yucca fries looked a little stingy.  We all liked the dipping sauces as well.  My coworker told me that his white meat wasn't that dry, so I'm assuming it could have been juicer though.  Not a bad option for lunch in the Mission for around $10ish.  But with so many options in the Mission, I wouldn't make a special trip out for it and not sure if I'd come back.", "author": "Cat C."}

Weekday lunch is completely different story though - relaxed and chill. \n\nI've tried quite a bit on the menu so let's just highlight the stars:\n1. Chicharron de Pollo. You MUST order this small plate. Crispy fried chicken served with a dipping sauce made of a super concentrated reduction of chicken jous and limes. So delicious and satisfying. \n\n2. Ceviche Mixto. I like the ceviche here because it has a nice balance of acidity while keeping the seafood fresh with the right texture. It's always a light and refreshing way to start a meal here. \n\n3. Mac and Cheese. I know it's weird to highlight a side dish but it does hold it's own. Pasta is nice and al dente while it's luxuriously coated in a truffled cheese sauce. \n \n4. Snapper - think this is no longer on the menu but there was this really delicious pan fried snapper dish served during lunch accompanied by some saut\u00e9ed greens and sauce. \n\nOther than the ones mentioned above, I've had the lengua, beef heart, short ribs, and Ensalada Rusa here.

This time I only enjoyed the food, but not enough to come back again. \n\nIt started with the bartender, who gave my friend attitude when she asked for a higher quality of gin in her cocktail. She was willing to pay for it and explained that well gin gives her headaches, but higher quality gins don't. He interrupted her and said \"no, it's the sugar\" and she politely said, no, that's not it, I'd prefer a better quality gin, thank you. He scoffed and walked away, then came back with a awful drink that none of us liked. We gave up. \n\nWe were seated and sat for a while until the waitress came by and asked what she could get us. \n\nWe had to ask for menus. \n\nI asked for a glass of white wine, a Godello from the part of Spain where my family lives. The waitress actually tried to correct my pronunciation of the wine (which she got wrong, but who cares? I was just trying to order wine!  En serio, no jodas, nena) She then came back and said that they were out of the Godello and asked what else I might like. I said \"Galician whites\" and she paused like she had no idea what I was talking about, then when I mentioned the Albari\u00f1o, she tried to describe it to me like she had no idea what I had just asked for.  \n\nThe food was amazing. If you don't mind the service, get the ceviches, the chicken, and the yucca fries. I asked for chimichurri sauce with the chicken, but she forgot to bring that out. \n\nThe waitress then brought the check without asking if we wanted dessert. We were celebrating a dear friends' birthday and wanted her to have something sweet. We tried waiting for the waitress, but she was nowhere to be found. So one of us got up and asked someone for a dessert menu. \n\nThe tres leches cake was amazing.  But not enough to go back. I hope things get better for this place.", "author": "Michelle P."}

I wish the portion was a little bigger though, especially for the price. \n\nHalf Chicken ($14.95) - A mix of white and dark meat. Seriously, this was some of the best chicken I've ever had - I don't usually fuck with white meat (giggity) but since my friend prefers thigh and wings, I had the chicken breast with skin on and it was tender, juicy and flavorful. Comes with two sides - we chose salad (skip next time) and saut\u00e9ed vegetables (definitely get this). \n\nLomito Saltado ($13.95) - I don't know how they can describe this as a \"small hot plate\" because the portions were super generous. The sirloin was perfectly cooked and I couldn't get enough of the accompanying vegetables. \n\nIn the interest of being a supportive friend we skipped on dessert but for the next time I have my eye on the Panna Cotta de Mango (panna cotta topped with mango jelly and served with fresh fruit). \n\nThe portions look small but don't be deceived; we were definitely satisfied.

Yes, in a shrewd business decision that recognizes our country's overall economic malaise, the owners have decided to abandon the restaurant's original upscale Peruvian culinary concept in favor of repeating their likely more profitable rotisserie chicken concept. And why not? They still serve ceviche and some small hot tapas, but the centerpiece is the chicken and a fine roast chicken it is. It's the Pollo a la Brasa, and for $10.95, Jamie W. and I were able to get a half-roaster cut in four pieces (see photo).\n\nDeliciously succulent as only a slow, long rotation on a spit can produce over a open flame. For our two automatic sides, we first went for the basic Ensalada, which was a nice size with shredded carrots and slices of radish and cucumber canvasing the deep greens underneath and doused with a light vinaigrette (see photo). The second was the Vegetales Salteados, marinated vegetables dominated by green and yellow wax beans with a lot of snap still (see photo). As an additional side, I wanted to try the Ensalada Rusa, a house specialty that looks and tastes like a picnic potato salad but with a little more versatility with beets, turnips, choclo (hominy), peas and green beans all slathered with a creamy mustard dressing (see photo).\n\nAnd somehow a chicken dinner doesn't feel complete until you add Papas Fritas, or as we call it in the corn belt, French fries, complete with a trio of aji sauces that suited both the fries and the chicken (see photo). Quite a feast all things considered. The place was bustling as it always has been every time I walked by on that busy block of Valencia. We both felt the service was on the clipped side, but we weren't bothered that much by it since the chicken was providing enough warmth for the both of us. In fact, we plan to come back for our poultry fix since the only other slow-roasted chicken that made us swoon recently was served at Il Pollaio up in North Beach.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...first-rate, slow-roasted chicken is the main event now, and that's OK by me\nAMBIANCE -3.5 stars...pretty crowded most of the time but nor unbearable\nSERVICE - 3 stars...efficient but a bit too curt even for insensitive types like myself\nTOTAL - 4 stars...cluck-cluck", "author": "Ed U."}

The chicken is always so juicy and flavorful. The 3 sauces that it comes with only enhances the flavors even more. A whole chicken was a good size for my party of 4. The truffle mac and cheese is so heavenly. I always wish I don't have to share the side with anyone else whenever we order this. Also, don't forget to get a pitcher of their sangria to share. \n\nI would pass on of the Tartara de Tuna; it's not good. The chicken empanadas we got had really dry shredded chicken; definitely another pass. The food at this location is just as good as the on Van Ness. However, the wait staff is much left attentive and the restaurant itself feels cramped. Nevertheless, the food at Limon is delicious.", "author": "Melanie H."}

Situated down the street from the 16th and Mission BART station, Limon Rotisserie is a nice spot for a casual dinner on Valencia. Like most places on Valencia, there is usually a long wait for those who do not have a reservation so I highly recommend reserving a table on OpenTable. \n\nFirst impressions when walking in: Very lively atmosphere, but also super loud. It also seemed to be a popular family dinner spot since there were many families with little children seated around us. For the amount of people in the restaurant, it definitely seemed like there was not enough waiters since we waited nearly a half hour before someone came over to take our order. \n\nOf course because of the previous reviews, we had to try out the rotisserie chicken along with sangria and some appetizers. When we got our order, I was severely underwhelmed by the chicken. While it's certainly not supermarket rotisserie chicken, I wasn't particularly blown away like some of the other previous reviewers. The chicken was cooked well, but I just didn't find it to be particularly flavorful (tasted very much like lean chicken). \n\nOverall I really have to say I wasn't particularly impressed by my visit to Limon Rotisserie. The service was meh and the food was meh as well. If I had to provide some feedback to management, I would say that they should really consider scaling back the amount of seating in the restaurant. The seating was pretty cramped and it was fairly evident that the servers were having trouble keeping track of all of the customers in the restaurant.", "author": "Derek L."}

The order filled up 2 people and we were even able to take a few pieces of chicken back home because we were pretty stuffed. Yuca fries were definitely a treat and really fun to snack on. \n\nI definitely wouldn't mind coming back for more rotisserie chicken :)", "author": "Harriet W."}

Luckily, we found a parking spot nearby, but there are street parking stalls nearby (obey the times!) and a pay lot as well if you decide to drive.\n\nFood: We had the whole chicken (which they are famous for). It was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend it. It was fully of juicy flavors, and there is both dark and white meat. We also had some of the sides, their yuca fries were not the best but when you're hungry (which we were) anything tastes great. \n\nService: The service was only okay. When we arrived we had a table for 5 people, and despite 3 of us being there they wouldn't seat us until all 5 of us arrived. Luckily there was some space at the bar so we ordered a drink while we waited. The bar has an assortment of wines and liquor. The waiter was really nice when he was around, but he didn't come around too often so we had to wave him down a couple of times which was a little annoying.\n\nExpert Tip: Make reservations because its gets crowded!

Fresh and delicious with the characteristic heat of the leche de tigre marinade.\n\n1/2 Pollo a la Brasa  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=fWOW6is1E4YNtRhgK-U-ZA) very moist and flavorful throughout. Excellent on it's own or with any of the 3 sauces provided with the chicken (aji amarillo, huacatay, rocoto). I was hoping for crispy skin, but still one of my favorite dishes of the night.\n\nAll the Pollo a la Brasa options (whole, half, 1/4) come with two sides and we chose Tacu-Tacu & Yucca Fries. Tacu-tacu is a rice and bean mixture http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=FiAyhjuvnPq9j-qxKpVsiw) topped with salsa criolla (pickled onions & peppers) which I really liked, but they were overshadowed by the yuca fries which had a crisp hard outer shell filled with creamy yuca flesh inside. \n\nThe \"Lomito\" Saltado (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=4ifpdTOw3qHG1kTip_hLSg) was very tender and medium-rare as requested. A bit salty and the way the meat and fries were mixed really soggified the fries.\n\nChicharron de Pollo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=IJrhz_H0mX36SWa32ArMPQ) was deliciously seasoned with aji amarillo and garlic. Crispy outer layer and mostly moist inside. Some thinner sections were overcooked and dry.\n\nTruffle Mac & Cheese was good, though I do prefer a thicker cheese sauce and some browning on top.

They are pretty stingy with their portions and this was clearly a decision on the management's part. This is more of a tapas-style place, with each small (emphasis on small) plate costing close to $10 and all not all worth the cost.\n\nYelpers got it right (at the time of this writing). 3.5 stars.\n\n4 for the food\n3 for the very loud, hard-edged ambiance\n2 for the value.\n4 for the service.\n\nSuccesses:\n\n--The 1/2 Pollo a la Brasa was very moist and tender--even the white meat was juicy. Simple but very good. Their chickens are not particularly large so 1/2 chicken will give party of 4 a sampling. Served with two sides: (we got the Tacu Tacu a wonderful scoop of seasoned mashed canary beans mixed with rice and exactly 4 perfectly crispy fried chunky sticks of Yucca) and three Aji sauces: \n\n--Ceviche de Pescado & Camaron: their red snapper and shrimp was the hit of the evening. Fresh, perfectly seasoned and so delicious with a perfect little spice kick. If you like ceviche, you will really love this version as we did.\n\n-- Chicharron de Pollo: a small portion simply deep-fried, un-breaded, chunks of chicken with a clear sauce that really was needed to pep-up these crunchy-moist-tender chunks.\n\n--Seco de Costillas: a small portion of braised boneless beef short ribs in a thin stew with carrots and potatoes. A real disappointment. While tender, the beef was overcooked and dry making it not worth the cost.\n\nDesert too was unimpressive. Their deserts are all over-priced at $7-8 each, even the sorbet. Their Chocolate Bandido was an attempt to be a chocolate melting cake but did not succeed and had very little of the rich chocolate flavor that it deserved.\n\nThe hard-edged lines of this place also made for a very loud experience as more people arrived. But service was really attentive, friendly and prompt.\n\nSo if you know what to order and what to expect, this could be a good place with lots of delicious sounding options--we were certainly full when we left but not completely pleased with everything served. The cost for the above with tip for two with no drinks was $35.", "author": "Glenn H."}

First, my boyfriend scheduled a reservation using the Yelp App for an 8pm dinner. When we checked in the lady said \"I don't see your name\". My boyfriend showed her the text reservation we received confirming our reservation that day and the front lady said \"We don't make SAME day reservation.\" I got a little ticked off, I mean what restaurants don't take same day reservations? Plus, why didn't the lady honor our reservation since we had proof on our phone. She decided not to honor our reservation we booked online and proceeded to tell us it would be an hour and a half wait. I kind of wanted to tell my boyfriend to just go to P\u00edcaros for dinner, but since we were there specifically to have dinner we went ahead and waited an hour and a half.  My chicken was quite pleasant and reasonably priced at $18 for half a chicken, my only complaint is if the restaurants offers french fries and sweet potato fries then why doesn't this place offer ketchup or mustard to go with it? In Peru, all chicken rotisseries offer ketchup and mustard. I feel like this is Limon's  way of forcing you to pay an additional al $3 for sauces. We also ordered ceviche, but the portion was extremely small. It had 3 shrimps, 3 octopus, a few cuts of fish. Our lomo saltado was pretty tasty too.

The food is delicious, yet the portions\nare so tiny for the price you're paying. I love love love the 'lomo saltado' and I always end up wanting to order another plate. Note: I have a relatively small appetite. So are the portions worth the price? Probably not.\n\nAs far as customer service, I'm going to say it's just OK. The servers are always alternating between tables, so it's hard to develop that server/customer relationship which makes great customer service. All \nthe servers are nice enough, yet many times they'll seem occupied to the point where you're wondering when they're going to come to your table. \n\nNow, regarding the ambiance...this is where people have different opinions. Well here's mine: IT'S SO LOUD IN HERE, I LITERALLY HAVE TO SHOUT ACROSS THE TABLE. Yes, I know it's a small location and it's always pretty packed, so it makes sense for the restaurant to incredibly loud.

It's a little too Americanized--the flavors are blander, less spicy, tart and all around exciting than what you'd experience in the actual country. That said, it's still delicious.\n\nCeviche Mixto: A must for novices and aficionados, as the way to see if a Peruvian restaurant passes muster is to judge it by its national dish. I almost always get the Mixto wherever I go so as to try as many different kinds of seafood as possible. LR's was tasty but not milky enough, in my opinion. While it had the right accompaniments, the onion/pepper/garlic flavors appeared to have been lost. However, the cuts of fish were quite generous. 4/5\n\nTruffle Mac 'n' Cheese: Not Peruvian by a long shot, and not very good either. The cheese was too thick and completely flavorless. Forget truffle salt, I don't think they even put regular salt in the dish! 1/5\n\nHalf Chicken: I love chicken done Peruvian-style. Tender, juicy, rotisserie-style with a crush of exotic herbs and spices. LR did this right. 5/5\n\nSweet Potato Fries: I don't like sweet potato, so I was meh about this, but my friends all seemed to love it. 3/5\n\nLomo Saltado: One of my favorite Peruvian dishes of all time and a must-order wherever I go. Limon Rotisserie's version was very tasty, but I don't think they did it quite right. You're supposed to taste a subtle, yet noticeable layer of soy sauce in each bite, as Lomo Saltado is one of Peru's \"chifa\" dishes (Asian-influenced dishes; Chinese speakers: Yes, \"chifa\" is a transliteration of \"eat rice\" in Mandarin). I couldn't really taste the soy sauce here. 3/5\n\nTacu Tacu: Rather bland and forgettable. 2/5\n\nMy friends and I also ordered several cocktails and of the ones we tried, the Sneaky Pisco was definitely the favorite. All in all, I'm glad I chose Limon Rotisserie as my first meetup dinner with my friend who was visiting from Boston. He had never had Peruvian food before and loved everything we got.

He certainly didn't appear disabled as he hopped into the restaurant to open up and greet the staff.  Really a shame when people game the system to take advantage.

Although the small plates don't look like much, a lot of the plates are really rich and heavy. I have taken multiple people here who are not adventurous eaters and are really picky (i.e. my grandparents), but everyone I've brought here always loves it. The most recent time I was here was in a group of four. We split a pitcher of sangria, half a roasted chicken, the lomo saltado, empanadas, the macaroni and cheese, yuca fries, and rice. It came out to be $20 (without tip) each. I definitely recommend everything I just listed. The food is SO good. From flavors to texture, everything is cooked perfectly and delicious. I didn't get dessert this time, but in the past I've gotten the mango panna cotta and it was GREAT. \n\nLimon is has a really nice atmosphere too. The full bar (woohoo!) and art are beautiful and it makes the restaurant feel more like fine dining, but it's actually very casual and loud. I also think it is some of the best service you will ever get. The staff is extremely attentive and accommodating.

The pollo a la brasa is available in full, half, and quarter portion. We opted for the white meat quarter option so we could try other dishes. Lomito saltado is just as savory.

Seriously, if you take reservations you can start seating people earlier.\n:end rant:\n\nOtherwise, this is a solid Peruvian place. We all got the $30 prix fixe menu due to the huge party size, but it was really nice for me since I got to try a variety of foods. We started with the ceviche, tuna tartare, salad and potatoes. Everything was really good -- the ceviche was tart, tuna tartare was fresh, the salad was really well dressed, and the potatoes creamy.\n\nThen we got chicharron, saltado and empanadas. The chicharron is always a guilty pleasure, but the saltado was delicious as well!\n\nOf course, how can we go without the famous rotisserie chicken.

The pisco sours were ok but there wasn't much depth to them, and the pisco cocktails were sickening sweet. Sweet than cosmo sort of sweet.

Served with 3 'aji' sauces that I am now realizing you can choose - when I visited the waiter did not present this option, so I think the standard trio aji was brought out to us. pretty good sauces none the less- the 2 cream sauces that come in the trio just reminded me of flavored ranch. the highlight was the chimichurri. I would definitely recommend choosing your own options instead. \n(+) tacu-tacu.\nordered this as a side to the 1/2 chicken. SO AMAZINGLY good. They describe tacu-tacu on the menu as saut\u00e9ed rice and beans, but it is so much more than that. Don't think rice and beans like rice and beans you get as a side with your burrito. Think of it as a rice, with the beans smothered into it so the consistency is almost like that of a sticky rice.

You are constantly checked on (sometimes the waiters just walk by an look to make sure everything looks alright on the table) and dishes are cleared quickly. Sauces go on everything, including the table, and the waiters are quick to wipe things up if it gets messy.\n\nSuper props to the waiter who seems to be the manager or something who was attentive working at the door, at the table, and even tried to help out with the ladies room bathroom line situation. You can see him running around like crazing tending the tables, so I am super impressed that he has time to stop and do some quick chatting with his customers and is able to make everyone feel like he is really there for them!

Took a long time to get our check. Thankfully the busser came by again and he made sure our server eventually brought our check (took two tries). I wouldn't come back on my own but if if I did, 6PM on a weekday is a good time. Any later, and it'll be harder to get a table.", "author": "Carolina P."}

Our last meal here (last week) was kind of terrible!\nWe sat at the bar and the bartender's service was very good, but our dinner was a disaster. The sides we had ordered to go with our entree came first, and about 30mins later our appetizers arrived with the main meal. The people sitting next to us on either side seemed to receive their dinner in the proper order so it could have just been our bad luck.\nBut when our entree came (after a really long wait) the yucca fries were still frozen solid?! We couldn't even bite into them.\nTo Limon's credit, the rest of the food did taste very good.\nWhat really helped end the dinner on a bad note was the dessert we had: the Chocolate Bandido. When we used to come here, it was like a molten chocolate lava cake with an amazing crunchy cookie thing and ice cream. What it is now is a flavorless microwaved dry chocolate muffin kind of thing - worse than your store bought Two-Bite-Brownie (no exaggeration). It's also much smaller than before, and the transparent light-brown color belies its lack of quality chocolate content. For $10, it's simply a rip-off and you'd be better to get dessert somewhere else after your dinner.\nSo, overall the food is still good here, but we were pretty disappointed this time.", "author": "Dire S."}

It was super lemon-y tasting but... it also had chopped up cilantro in it. :( I think I liked the shrimp the best out of the three different types of seafood. Corn was the highlight for me though.\n\nOur chicken and sides came next. I was kind of disappointed because the arroz was just plain white rice. I was expecting The chicken skin was lemony and had lots of flavor.. it was kind of salty though. However, the actual meat wasn't as flavorful. Good thing we had the sauces to dip them in (Chimichurri was a bit too oily but I liked the other two sauces). Or if you eat a little bit of the skin with the chicken it has about the right flavor/salt level. \n\nThe \"Lomito\" Saltado says that it comes with fries but the fries are actually soaked in the sauce.

I'll eat meat only if its something I've never had before so beef heart it was. \n\nCeviche Limon - This was the last to come and we were completely stuffed already. This dish is fucking huge. We probably only got through half of it but it was all very tasty. It comes with a shot glass of what I assume is the marinade and you pour it all over the seafood. \n\nCeviche Trio - The waiter just chose the ones for the trio for us since he said the first three on the menu were basically the same or something. The ahi tuna one was the best out of the three. I think it was the Ceviche de Pescado. Omnomnomnom. The sweet potato in all the dishes was really good too but I also just really fucking love me some sweet potato. \n\nAnticuchos de Res - Beef heart! It was extremely tough and chewy. I'm not sure if it was worth breaking my fairly strict pescetarian diet but my date was surely satisfied he got me to eat meat (that sounded way dirtier than intended). \n\nVeggie Empanadas - My date said it was the best thing he ate out of everything served. The sauce was amazing but I thought there was too much dough and not enough filling. \n\nCocktails - I already forgot what we got but I hate their limited variety. The Pisco Sour was terrible but thats purely just because I hate tequila and it tasted a lot like tequila.

The chicken, was nicely cooked, tender and flavorful. The yuca fries were alright, I'm sure they're probably cooked right, but it wasn't my thing. The rice mashed with beans was interesting, it had a nice subtle taste to go with the stronger flavor of the chicken. My friend ordered the skirt beef with saut\u00e9ed mushroom/onions and mashed potatoes. Beef was cooked exactly medium rare as we wanted and the whole dish was packed with flavor. The portions were smaller compared to the price but that's how it is with an upscale restaurant like this. If I could take the food to go then I wouldn't have had to deal with the service. I get that it was packed at 9pm on a Saturday and we were a couple compare to the bigger tables, but most of the 1.5 hr we were there we only saw our waiter three times: at beginning for water/ordering, an early water refill at start then at end after we had to flag him down for the check. He was absent for so much of the time I forgot what he looked like. I might have even flagged down the wrong person for the check at the end. This isn't an economical place where you can expect to be ignored, but rather a lot of the money for the price is the cost of good service. I feel ripped even paying 15% tip but I never go below. Saturday upstairs, 2030-2200. I recommend the food for sure.", "author": "Sithu K."}

We learned that the full party must be accounted for before you can be seated. In the meantime, you are able to chill at the bar and order drinks while you wait for your guests to arrive. There is an upstairs and downstairs seating area. During the daytime, the upstairs may provide more of an intimate setting, while the downstairs area may provide more lighting and activity.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were greeted by a friendly waiter and received menus and waters very promptly. We ordered an assortment of dishes (including mac and cheese, which was very flavorful and the tuna tartare, also very fresh and juicy), but my favorites were the chicken (their specialty!) and the lomito saltado! The chicken was very tender, juicy, and full of flavor, while the lomito saltado (has french fries on it!) was cooked to perfection and had a perfect balance of textures (fries vs. meat). The fries were not soggy, which is my main thing. We had our waters filled promptly and were able to catch the attention of the wait staff quickly, despite the business of the place.

Conveniently located a block away from 16th street Bart station, this little gem boasts bold flavors of authentic Peruvian cuisine. The restaurant isn't very spacious but it's big enough to exude that warm cozy feel. We came with a fairly large party of 15 people and they seated us right next to the window. With parties of 10 or more, they have a prefixed menu. Fortunately we had an amazing server who proposed an even better plan.. A special menu highlighting all of Limon's signature dishes for just under $25 a person! We had probably 10 courses of food if not more. Of course ceviche and sangria are a must but don't forget to try out their paella and beef dishes as well.  Can't go wrong with a pisco sour either. Everything was flavored to perfection and the meat was succulent and juicy.  I don't think I had anything I disliked.

No smile or care, just a task oriented person is all you will get.I would imagine that you will receive better service when business is slow, (so I'll give them that much). Beware when you go on Saturdays because it will be busier than normal. This is when the servers will begin to fumble and lose integrity. I asked for water 5 (five) times to 2 different people, and never received it from either one. \n\n I was about to ask my server if it was ok to bring water from the \"outside\" because I was ready to leave the restaurant to buy water from a nearby liquor store since no one brought us water. I was literally getting dehydrated. There was another gal who approached us twice, asking if everything thing was good, and those times I asked for water, but never received it.\n\nTo make a long story short, their service does not the match the culinary level they are trying to portray.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-17", "description": "Limon is full of deceptions. First, the dining room is larger than it seems.  Second, though the restaurant enjoys a constant stream of patrons nightly, waiting for a table is only a marginal nuisance thanks in large part to a friendly and efficient host staff.  And, finally, though Limon's food extracts much from Peru's rich chaotic blend of Ameridian, African, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, and Arab cultures, its decor is simple, clean, and rather mundane with dark installations and hardwood floors splashed with accents of lime-colored knickknacks.  \n\nUnfortunately, these contradictions appear to be the only interesting elements of Limon's dining experience as the restaurant is dulled by sub-par food and wait service.\n\nLimon's seafood paella comprises of an authentic flavor profile with mussels, shrimp, peas, and lightly drizzled sofrito -- notably, sans fish.  Though the taste was well executed, both the rice and shrimp were overcooked as they gave off unpleasant rubbery textures.  \n\nThe chicken chicharron, one of Limon's so-called signature dish, is equally unimpressive.  Our bare portions were excessively dry and surprisingly overdone, resembling some sort of chicken jerky left overnight in a food dehydrator for a carnival food stand.  The accompanying limon-flavored sauce, though delicious, had the impossible task of making the dish edible.  Unless a line cook slipped this by the chef, I felt insulted being served something obviously misfired.  \n\nJust to clarify, there are several variations of chicken chicharron in Peru -- fried skin (similar to pork rinds), batter-soaked and deep fried (similar to American fried chicken), and well-seared marinated chicken (carmelized outside with white moist inside).  Limon follows the latter incompetently.\n\nOne bright spot is the ceviche mixto, a beautifully plated mix of calamari, fish, and tiger shrimp garnished with voluptuous Peruvian corn kernels, herbs, and sliced onions.  Though the shrimp, again, was overdone, the dish worked well with a bit of salinity, sweetness, and acidity from the components.\n\nThe service here, though mostly courteous, is difficult to acquire regardless of the density level of the restaurant.  The members of the wait staff were noticeably absent during my recent two dinner visits: none of the waiters checked up on our food; only the runners tended to our table to settle the dishes.\n\nI expected much more from a restaurant carrying so much hype.  With proper management, I suspect that Limon can fulfill the promise behind its hype or, at the very least, go much further than where it stands now.  And, where it stands now is deep mediocrity.", "author": "AC N."}

In both cases, my issue was not with the food (which was good), but with the customer service. They really need to spend more time on employee training.\n\nFirst one: I celebrated my birthday at Limon with a party of 20 guests. The restaurant was great at accomodating us on the second floor. So I thought.. They started rushing us after about an hour and a half into the dinner.. The waiters kept coming back and asking when we will leave. This was the first time I was asked at a restaurant when to leave. Ok I understand you want to make more $$, but this is definitely not the right way to do so. Of those 20 guests who dined that night, not a single one was happy with the treatment they got. That is a big number of people to disappoint in one night...Bad business.\n\nSecond one: Recently I called them to make a reservation \"reluctantly\" after my first bad experience... and the person answering the phone was very unprofessional. As soon as I told him that I would like to make a reservation, he told me that they were very busy at the moment. After a moment of silence, I told him \"ok..\" still expecting him to put down my details for the reservation. But instead he told me to call back in 15 minutes. I politely told him no thanks. One thing this restaurant has to understand is that we are also very busy, and we just can't keep calling back. Obviously I moved on to our second option.", "author": "Jan K."}

Delicious.\n\nCarne a la Parilla- My favorite! The smoky flavor meat acquires from an open flame is one of my culinary turn-ons. This plate has it! That flavor is accentuated by the beans and the sauce. Excellent.\n\nCarne Empanadas- flaky but not dry. The meat filling is flavorful and moist. Really good.\n\nI'm not a drinker but I really enjoyed the couple of sips from my partner in dine's Pa Bravo Yo. I look forward to ordering my own next time around. It was sweet but not overly so and not too strong.\n\nWe have tried other things on the menu but they are only \"ok\" to me. They weren't bad, I just was expecting a little more:\n\n\"Lomito\" Saltado- The meat for this plate is sauteed, it's missing that \"umph\" that grilling would bring to it. The meat was tender but it's not infused with flavor, a little bland by comparison. I know I would have liked it more if it was grilled. I think the one at La Costanera is grilled. \n\nChicharron the pollo- being from Guatemala I had a different expectation when I read \"chicharron\". I expected something crunchy, what we got was tender slightly crispy morsel of chicken. It was slightly redundant to order this and the Pollo a la Brasa.\n\nTruffle Mac & Cheese- The truffles were buttery. I wasn't wowed by the cheese they used. A little \"thin\", I thought it would be richer.\n\nCeviche Mixto- It was pretty good, but didn't stand out from other ceviches I've tasted. I'm not a big fan of fish. The seafood tasted fresh and was served with a tangy marinade. \n\nThe Sangria was one of the stronger ones I've tried. I would have liked it better if it had been sweeter.\n\nService has always been attentive. I like the set up at this location better. Seating at the Van Ness location is a bit claustrophobic. \n\nParking can be tough. I'm tempted to try out the location on Third St. where I anticipate parking to be easier.", "author": "Jose U."}

Ceviche de pescado and Lomo Saltado. Flavors were delicious the meats were cooked to perfection the ceviche was fresh and tasty. No complaints. Servers were always checking in to make sure we were doing ok throughout the meal. I just felt everything was rushed...like they wanted us out of there fast!

For a Sunday I was expecting it to be packed, but it wasn't too bad.\nOur group tried a little bit of errythang:\n\nSangria was the best! It wasn't too heavy with the wine taste, it was light and refreshing.. it didn't taste like any sangria I've ever had..\n\nRotisserie chicken was so good... especially when you dipped it in the red and yellow sauce (I have no idea the names.. but the red one had a kick to it!) The chicken was perfectly seasoned - not too salty, and moist. ;)\nIt's served with 2 sides, we chose yuca fries  - bigger than I thought they would be.. they were more like wedges and I think there were only 4-5 pieces, and the sweet potato fries were hella good! Crispy, light and not oily..\n\nWe tried both kinds of ceviche:\nThe cold one with tiger shrimp and fish was so good. You could taste it's freshness and the lemon/lime juice it was prepared with was perfect. One of my favorite dishes!\nCrispy ceviche was fried sole that wasn't overly battered that you could still taste the freshness of the fish... it was definitely top 5. \n\nTruffle mac n cheese  was a sleeper hit. It was creamy but not too cheesy.. And the taste was on point.\n\nLomito Salteado with the french fries and onions? BOMB. Make sure when you take a bite, it's with the onion, french fry and beef.. the mix of flavors and texture is perrrfect.\n\nChicharron was really good too. Crispy, not oily and mixed with those dipping sauces made it even better!\n\nEmpenada was probably my least favorite... don't get me wrong, it was good.. I've just had better.\n\nI had a great experience here and I'd definitely be back.\nOur server even gave me some birthday candle glasses - lol. A lady even stopped at our table to let us know her husband had turned 80 something and he didn't even get a pair! lol\n\nBonus point for the server for turning on the niners game for us!", "author": "Gizelle P."}

Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. Between the two of us, we split a half-chicken with Yuca fries and beans and rice, as well as an order of Paella. The chicken was decent, although definitely nothing special. The sides did complement it very well. The paella was decent, but definitely not as hearty as I was expecting. We were still hungry afterwards, and split two desserts, something we usually never have room for. The desserts (chocolate cake and bread pudding) were much more delectable than the main courses.

So the second time we decided to make reservations and come for an early dinner at 5:30pm with Hubby and his parents. The place was empty except for another couple and it didn't start getting busy until around 6:30.  \n\nWe got seated promptly upon arrival and our server was super friendly and great at recommending some dishes for us and answering all our questions about the food. I'm glad to say we were not disappointed! The food was delicious and reasonably priced. We also got a pitcher of sangria and it was very yummy!  \n\nHubby got the half chicken, which was delicious! Including the sauces it came with.  The inlaws got the chicken as well and the Lomito which was also delicious. The fried yuca was perfect.  I got the ceviche which was good but not impressive. I recommend the chicken and the Lomito instead and along with the  fried yuca and the grilled veggies as sides. We also had dessert and those were not actually Peruvian so that was disappointing but they were good. We got little cream puffs and this other mango custard thing. It was really sweet but we all shared it so it wasn't bad. I don't think I could eat that by myself. \n\nI will definitely come back here for the chicken and the Lomito.

We couldn't get a 6 p.m. reservation so we took a 5:30 p.m. reservation.\nThe restaurant was bustling when we arrived but not full.  We were given a table at the back near the stairs.\nOur waiter arrived promptly and gave us water plus a pitcher of water.  He returned a few minutes later and took our order.\nI wasn't very hungry so I just had a mixed green salad and chicken empanadas. My friend had fried calamari and chicharros as appetizers and paella.\nOur meal arrived promptly and looked delicious.  I quickly discovered that the greens had not been shredded and when I tried to cut the salad with a knife and folk, the salad bowl tipped over.  So I used my bread dish for my salad.\nThe empanadas were crispy and hot, but the chicken filling was bland.  That surprised me because Limon specializes in rotisserie chicken.\nBut my friends like their appetizers and paella very much.  They also split a pitcher of sangria which was a lot for two people so they were pretty buzzed when we left.  I had a small sip and thought there was too much alcohol in the sangria.\nSo, two out of three of us really enjoyed their meal.  Next time, I will order something different.", "author": "Philip C."}

Ordered the whole chicken, which comes with two sides (truffle mac & cheese, and yucca fries), an order of ceviche mixto, a beef empanada and tacu tacu.  We also opted for an additional set of sauces.  We also ordered purple corn antioxidant juice, the name of which escapes me.\n\nI do not know what they do to make this chicken sooo delicious, but I'm half-seriously wondering if it would survive being FedEx'd to the East Coast.  The chicken is remarkably tender- just tender enough that it's almost falling off the bone, but not so much as to be messy. (Not that we cared. There WAS licking of fingers at our table.)  \n\nOur waiter was Harry;  he was very polite and attentive. The food came quickly, and Harry followed up to make sure we had everything we needed.  \n\nThere were two small items that made this dinner less than perfect. One was the noise level. Harry was being very kind to explain the various sauces, etc. as we hadn't been here before, but the noise level made it really hard to hear him.  That's a bummer, because he really seems to know and care about the food, and that's an important part of the dining experience.\n\nThe other was the young guy (possibly a host who had just come on duty?) who kept coming to the table asking to take our dishes while they still had food in them.  There were other tables open, so I'm not sure why he was so interested in us finishing up, but NO, you cannot have that last yucca fry, Host Guy! Get your own!\n\nGoing back.

We had no trouble getting a reservation 1 week in advance for a Sunday night. Unfortunately, traffic was a little backed up due to the Folsom Street Festival so we were running late. I called the restaurant to let them know and the hostess made a big stink about it so we were really surprised when we showed up and it was not even close to full. Then, they refused to seat my mom and grandmother until we had all arrived (we dropped them off in front and went to park the car). I understand this policy for very busy times, but the restaurant was less than 50% full so that seemed a little ridiculous... And finally, they sat us upstairs even though there were plenty of tables downstairs. Since we had an elderly person, they definitely should have seated us on the main level without us having to say something. \n\nNow you're probably thinking: that sounds like a horrible experience! Why would you give it 3 stars? And the answer is simple, ceviche. The minute we took our first bite, all was forgiven.\n\nThe fish ceviche was phenomenal, the tuna ceviche was excellent - it was like happy limes dancing around in my mouth.\n\nPaella was good, salads were good, sangria was great. But mostly it comes down to the ceviche.\n\nNote: portions are small. For a party of 4 we ordered the ceviche trio, 2 salads, and the paella.

I am normally a big fan of Limon, but they certainly deserve 2 stars for this experience.  Here is what they did wrong.\n\nNot allowing us to order from the regular menu\n-For people that never tried Limon, you are limiting your potential for them to come back in the future.  The fixed price menu does not have the variety that you can choose from on the regular menu.\n\nActing like you are doing us a favor\n-At the end of dinner, some waiter came up to us and told us, you made a reservation for 15 people and I am only charging you for 13.  There is no reason for him to even mention that.  \n\nServing Fries and Lomo Saltado\n-Not allowing us to order from the regular menu is absurd enough.  Serving lomo saltado and fries does not make sense.  Lomo Saltado already has french fries.  Why not serve Yuca Fries or Sweet Potato Fries?  Variety is good.

I like cerviche in general and all the seafood in this one tasted fresh & the citrus wasn't overpowering. \n\n-Tartara tuna: I LOVE tuna tartar and when it's prepared properly/fish is fresh I'm easily pleased, and this one was yummy! \n\n-Cuasa de Pollo: Now this was something that was different & intriguing (to me anyways), and was DELICIOUS! The whole look of the dish certainly grabs your attention and the combination of flavors (chicken salad, potato, & avocado) went well together. \n\n-Costillas Nekkei: Beef on a bone is always delicious, and these ribs didn't disappoint. The sauce was tangy, but not overpowering. \n\n-Chicarron de Pollo: Probably my favorite dish we tried. I LOVE fried chicken, especially when it's really crispy, which was the case here! \n\n-Jalea: Fried food w/tartar sauce = yum. \n\n-Empanadas: This was the one dish I was a little disappointed with. I like empanadas, but I thought these ones were a little overcooked & the meat was kind of dry (we had beef). \n\nWe ordered two portions of each of these to split amongst 7 people (we may have ordered one other dish that I'm forgetting), and I was pretty stuffed by the time we were finished (another reason I usually don't like tapas is because when I'm done I still feel hungry, but that wasn't the case here). In addition to the food we split a few pitchers of sangria. It was definitely delicious, but it was a little sweet. This is usually how sangria is at restaurants though, so I understand. \n\nThe service & prices at Limon are great/reasonable as well. I would definitely consider coming back here with a large group when hanging out in the Mission. Oh...I should also note we did make a reservation here (the day of) and if it weren't for this we probably would have had to wait a long time, so if you're coming here I would do the same.", "author": "George A."}

Yummy sides--the tacu tacu (mashed beans and rice) was memorable, as was the mixed veggies.\nDidn't try their small plates but I would come back and give it a go.\n\nI was quite intrigued by their cocktail menu. I had the Divina (sp?) Passion, which was a semi-sweet blend of Huamani (Peruvian Brandy) with mint and lemon. Didn't try the Pisco sour so I can't speak about it but go ahead and give it a try--a Peruvian restaurant SHOULD make a decent Pisco sour, but I guess you don't know until you try...\n\nPretty cool hipster-y ambiance (it's the Mission, come on) and of course, park on the street if you can snag a spot.

I got Lime and Limon confused when I saw the daily email come in so by a stroke of inconvenience turned luck, my boyfriend and I found ourselves at a pretty classy brunch place. The decor reminds me of trendier restaurants in the Bucktown area of Chicago and holds its own in the hipster ridden epic center of the Mission. \n\nWe had a 2 o' clock reservation but found ourselves in the neighborhood earlier than anticipated and they accommodated us graciously anyhow. Sneaking a peak at their Open Table online reservation screen though, I could see that we were the only reservations that shift. The place was packed nevertheless so this must be a go to spot for the locals. There were double dates, business lunches and groups of friends everywhere with sangria and beautiful small plates that were tempting to the eye.\n\nI guess I'd have to agree with some of the other reviewers when they say the service was a little scattered and mismanaged. Our server didn't know how to handle a Groupon from an iPhone app and even went so far as to suggest that it get printed from an internet cafe somehow instead of just taking the number down like he was suppose to. I imagined his managers didn't explain how Groupon worked so I couldn't really hold it against him this time. \n\nWe ordered a mango lemonade and capirinha to start with sweet potato and truffled mac and cheese appetizers sides to go with the Ceviche Limon and the Pescado Limon. The mango lemonade tasted more like a watered down mango juice with no hint of lemon at all but still tasted wonderful anyhow. I can't comment on the capirinha 'cause it's not my drink of choice but it did look good. I will point out there was a hair on top of my glass which was a bit odd and I knew it wasn't my short black hair either...ewww. \n\nI will say the shining accomplishment of this place has got to be the ceviche though. It would be truly sad if a Peruvian place couldn't get their act together on ceviche and I wasn't disappointed at all. The cuts of fish were just the right size to not get drowned in lime juice but at the same time, soak up enough juice to get cured. I really shouldn't have ordered mac n cheese with cold fish but I couldn't help myself and I'll probably find myself doing that again next time. The mac and cheese is very very heavy so I'd advise everyone to eat the ceviche first.\n\nI had just a taste of the snapper which flaked off in my mouth and was seasoned quite well. My only wish was that the portions were a little smaller like tapas that way I could order more plates and try out more ceviche dishes in the future.", "author": "Jessica K."}

We both remember enjoying the food, but obviously with a first date situation, you're focused on other things.  So we wanted to give it another try, just to make sure our initial memories of the place were correct.\n\nWe went again last night with a friend, and we agreed that almost everything we ordered was amazing!  We started with the Chicharron de Pollo, red snapper ceviche, Lomo Saltado, sweet potato fries, veggie empanadas, and a pitcher of sangria.  The food came out SO quickly, it was almost alarming...but it was all perfectly seasoned, and perfectly cooked.  So their kitchen definitely knows what it's doing.  And our sangria was delicious!\n\nMy favorites were the Lomo Saltado and Chicharron de Pollo.  The Lomo Saltado had a soy-based sauce with french fries and onions, served with rice.  It was so good, I think I could have eaten the whole plate!  The only complaint was that I think there were only like 4 pieces of perfectly-cooked, medium, juicy steak in the whole dish....I thought it could have come with more, especially for $17.  But the dish was so good that I didn't mind.  The sweet potato fries were perfectly crispy but soft in the middle, and served with two delicious dipping sauces, and I spent awhile trying to decide which I liked better...they were both really good!\n\nAnyway, after eating all of those things, we were a little bit hungry still, so we ordered the seafood stew.  Unfortunately, it was not our best dish of the night...which was too bad, because everything else before it was so fantastic!  Minus 0.5 stars for that.  It was mostly calamari, a couple of mussels and shrimp, and then just a salty broth.  I wasn't too impressed.\n\nThe busser was a little bit over-zealous...I had to tell the guy twice that we weren't finished eating a dish before he would have quickly swept away the last bites of my delicious Lomo Saltado!  Yikes.  After those two times though, he would make sure to look at me and ask before taking something away, so that was good, though slightly awkward.\n\nI would say the service was just fine, but not anything special or over-the-top.  Our guy seemed friendly enough, but maybe could have come back a couple more times.  We didn't mind too much though, because we were so happily munching away on sweet potato fries.\n\nThis was the first time I sat upstairs, and it's a nice ambiance.  The ceilings in the loft section are a bit low, and the lighting was flickering a bit (I'm pretty sure that was on purpose), but it was trendy and all the groups seemed to be having a great time.  Good atmosphere, for sure.\n\nWe skipped dessert after looking at the menu, because nothing jumped out at us.  Also, Bi-Rite is only a few blocks away....so we went there instead. :)\n\nI definitely don't understand the 3-dollar signs price on here.  Most small places were ~$7-13, and entrees were $17-25.  With 3 people and all that food + a pitcher of Sangria, we only paid ~$35 each including tip.\n\nI would definitely come back here for the Lomo Saltado and the Chicharron de Pollo.  And the sangria.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-15", "description": "On a spontaneous double date night, my group of four marched down Valencia for dinner at this \"positively Yelp-reviewed\" establishment. From the outside, the place looked bustling with patrons. Since we hadn't made reservations, we had to put our name on the wait-list and they let us know it would take about 25 minutes, which isn't too long considering it was a Friday night and we hadn't reserved a table. \n\nValencia has all sorts of unique stores an avid window-shopper like myself can easily lose herself in so the 25 minutes of waiting went by rather quickly. Back at Limon, our seats were not yet ready, but there was room at the bar so we ordered drinks: sangria and Peruvian beer. \n\nThe sangria was perfect: chunks of sangria-marinated apples and oranges floating in a swirl of burgundy bitter and sweet goodness. The Cristal Peruvian beer was refreshing, but as a fan of darker beers, it didn't hit the spot. It did pair very nicely with the fresh ceviche. \n\nWhen we were seated, the four of us went through the menu with a quickness (there were certain dishes that stood out with promises of palatability) and the server was attentive to our needs. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nThe Half Chicken with the Vegetables Salteados and the Tacu Tacu\nCeviche De Pescado Y Camaron\nChicharron De Pollo with the Yuca fries \n\nThe white meat chicken was tender and juicy, full of flavor. The three aji sauces that come with the chicken were delicious to dip anything into. My favorite was the spicy, chipotle-esque sauce, but the biting cilantro and creaminess of the other two sauces were delicious to combine and dip strips of savory chicken into. The sauteed vegetables, mostly green beans, were delectable. I found myself picking off the tomatoes and red onions and swirling them in the aji sauces for a salsa in the my mouth. The Tacu Tacu was not especially unique to me, but perhaps mashed beans and rice don't compare too well with the spice and flavor of the chicken and the sauces. \n\nThe ceviche was a favorite. Hours later, I can still recall the bite of that lime-infused  heaven. The shrimp was fresh and came in neat little slices that allow one to indulge in the flavor and quickly stick a fork in the dish for more. I ended up finishing off the ceviche, but I swear I was so tempted to hold the dish and pour the juice into my mouth for a refreshing spiced limeade. I would have done it, but table manners were recalled. \n\nAs great as the ceviche was and as much as I had fallen in love with it, the Chicharron De Pollo brought me to palate paradise. Our boisterous, heavy laughter was immediately silenced by this miracle of heaven. Growing up with the Filipino cuisine, I was always tantalized by fried pork rinds, and I dared Ljmon's offering of chicken chicharron to bring me back to the crunch and flavor of my youth. It exceeded my expectations: the outside had the perfectly roasted texture and flavor but the inside was white meat tenderness.  Top that off with the Yuca fries, which my partner described as \"fried mashed potatoes\" (the Yuca root gives it that softened, mashed potato texture and when deep-fried, these fries are the gourmet version of potato fries). \n\nSince my group shared everything family style, we had enough room for dessert. My partner and I are big fans of panna cotta and I asked for the dessert menu, praying that they would have a form of panna cotta. \n\nEt voila! Panna Cotta De Mango. This light, creamy, gelatinous dessert was topped off with a mango jelly and displayed with ultra-thin slices of apple (which I believe were green apples because I tasted a little tart in there somewhere). \n\nThe bill came out to $52 (yeah, we couldn't really believe it, it felt like we had dined royally!), and split that among four people and you've got a very affordable, extremely scrumptious meal!\n\nThe restaurant itself was crowded and a little too loud for quiet conversation, but you get your meal quickly (we got ours in less than five minutes) and I can't complain about the service. \n\nThe four of us left the restaurant completely satisfied, but not bloated, and already making plans to try the \"Lomito\" Saltado with more Yuca fries and ceviche. \n\nAfter checking the Yelp reviews at the other locations (the Van Ness one seems to have higher ratings), it's shocking to think that it gets better because it was all awesome. Maybe I'll have to go to that location to compare, but I'll definitely be back for more!", "author": "Erika P."}

And after another 15 minute wait, I went and asked the hostess about how much longer and she told me there were still three groups before me. And then 5 minutes later she comes out to us and asks if we were the ones waiting for a party and when we said no, she asked for my name and then gave us a table immediately. There was a table of six that was empty the whole time when I was there. I thought maybe it was reserved, but in the end, they actually seated a party of four and then a party of two there. \n\nThere was a soccer game the night we picked to go there, so it was actually extremely loud and very hard to have a conversation.

This was simply the best seafood that has gone past my lips in memory. Just give me a big bowl of this and I would be a happy camper.\n\nMain:\nLomo Saltado, tender sirloin with onion, tomato and shoestring fries. Perfect and filling. Tomatoes were barley cooked and held it's texture without falling into mush. Chef knows what he's doing, flavors were balanced.\n\nDessert:\nProfiteroles, OMG moment. These little puffs of heaven filled with a smooth creamy filling with a light caramel sauce.\n\nBaros 20 year tawny was smooth with a nutty finish, a really nice pairing with the pastry. I was lucky to be the first pour from the bottle. Bartender poured another glass in which the staff took  small samples from. They smiled and nodded with approval.

The star here though is the dipping sauce making this a notch better.  I'd definitely pass on the out-of-place Truffle Mac and Cheese. It piqued my interest since who doesn't love a good truffle mac and cheese. But the key word is \"good.\" And what business does this have on a Peruvian menu anyway?

One of them said that one of their friends raved about this place and that she always wanted to come here, so in we went.\n\nInterior was on the darker side with neutral brown and green decor. A fresh ice display of oysters and crabs/lobster greet you next to the bar. \nAfter we got seated, trying to decide what to eat proved difficult because everything sounded delicious AND healthy. I noticed that a lot of their menu items had seafood in it, which proves to be a problem because I don't like seafood, but in the end decided to go for their butterleaf salad with shrimp. We even got a truffle macaroni and cheese to share amongst the three of us.\n\nLet me tell you: if you don't know what to order there, GET the truffle macaroni and cheese. Elbow noodles were perfectly al dente. Perfect amount of truffle oil without being overpowering, with the perfect married amount of white cheese. Every morsel had a kick of flavor without being obnoxious. It was everything I had hoped truffle mac and cheese would be.\n\nThe butterleaf salad was great; came with little crispy pieces of potato(?) that stayed crunchy, despite being drenched in a delicious avocado ranch dressing. And the shrimp, though I really don't care for them, were clean and fresh. The girl who suggested this place got their ceviche which was incredibly fresh. She even made a comment of saying how she felt like we were at a restaurant off a warm beach eating the local catch; that's how fresh and clean it tasted. My other friend ordered the empanadas which ended up being a kind of disappointment; more of a tapas-sized brunch plate than an actual lunch.\n\nAnyway, this place is a solid four.

The empanadas were okay and the seco de costillas I was not a fan of as they tasted like crockpot stew to me (blegh - if I wanted that, I'd make it at home.) Others did like that, though. Sweet potato fries and rice & beans were good - wasn't a big fan of the yuca fries.\nThe chicken they are so famed for was pretty good, mostly juicy with some flavor to it. I really didn't think it lived up to the hype. I tried it with sauces to try to impart some more flavor to it but I didn't really think the sauces paired well with it. I was hoping for a more flavorful chimichurri sauce than what was served as well.\nFor 6 people, the food here went a long way, as the bill (including tip) was about 160. They add 15% gratuity here for parties of 6 or more, so we did not tip on top of that. I really hate when places add tip for you as I find it insulting. I always tip very well, but if you are going to add tip automatically, that's all you're getting. It is hard for me to believe that large parties come in an don't tip often enough to make it worth the 15% added tip policy. But apparently it does, as I know it is a very common practice (I just find it tacky.)\nOur waiter was really nice and helpful, but after we were done eating, we started to get the \"hint\" that it was time for us to go. This, coupled with the hostesses, is what really soured me on this place. They came back, took our check. Five minutes later, came back, picked up the napkins off our table. Five minutes later, came back and grabbed water glasses off our table. I don't care how busy you are, that is just plain rude and bad service.\nI will look for other Peruvian places.", "author": "Rachel B."}

So much so that I insisted our annual extended family dinner be here this year.\n\nJose, the event manager, hooked us up with the prix fixe family style menu which includes most of the highlights on the regular a la carte menu.   Some of our party's favorites were the tuna tartare (we kept gobbling this up and asking for more!), chicharron de pollo, and pollo a la brasa with all the amazing sauces.  Don't forget to order a glass (or a pitcher) of the yummy sangria to wash everything down!\n\nDesserts are not included in the prix fixe menu, but that didn't stop us from ordering multiples of the profiteroles, panna cotta de mango and chocolate bandido.  All were fabulous, but my favorite by far were the profiteroles.  Light and fresh, they were like little pillows of heaven!\n\nService was sort of spotty.  We didn't get a designated server even though our party was about 25 people.  I had to ask for my drink a few times before I was informed they didn't have the ingredients to make it.  However, the timing of the food was good.\n\nGreat place for some good eats and a nice place to have a shindig, especially around the holidays.

Let me start by saying - dudes, your food is fabulous. The tartare is always yummy. The short ribs with potatoes are to die for. The ceviche hits the spot too!!! Great great food. Great location. Great lighting. \nNow this is where things get ugly. I live on Valencia, a block away from limon. So when I'm feeling lazy and don't wanna wait for my scrumptious food - I do what any normal human being would do - get takeout. Now, the food - just as good. They package everything neatly. Everything has it's own little box and compartment. Nothing spills, etc. you get the point. \nTheir service however.... Oh man. As my tip said - their service is terrible. Twice I've gone in (I kept my receipts and will add the photos for proof) and had to wait 30-45 minutes over their estimated wait time. Here's how it goes:\n1. Call limon and place an order for your take out. Takes 2-3 tries since it's always very loud. Make sure to get the tartare and short ribs. \n2. Hear the person say - okay, see you in 30! Now, for all you naysayers, I've tried this at 6 pm and 9 pm, so don't blame it on the number of people there. \n3. Head there in 45 mins because you know it won't be 30. See them look for my ticket, find it hanging somewhere, send it in and hear them say - \"almost ready sir. Can I get you a drink while you wait?\"  \nOne time they couldn't even find the ticket (they eventually found it 15 mins later). No sir, I don't want house sangria. No sir, you've already given me 2 glasses of water. No sir I will not move out of the way while I wait for my food. 30-45 mins later - get your food. \n\nWhat's worse is, they charge you BEFORE bringing you the food. So even if you want to walk out, you lose your money. Good trick!! I end up tipping every time and regret it 45 minutes later. \n\nSo, in conclusion, limon, your food is so friggin great. But now your service... Remember, a take out customer is a paying customer and is less work than an eat in customer.

Even though it was bustling, you were still able to have a conversation without talking loudly.\n\nThe wine, beer and especially, the cocktail menu was interesting. Many of the cocktails were cool sour mixes.\n\nSadly, the food was sub par. The main adjective I have is salty. We ordered a variety of small plates and the consensus was that  the food was unnecessarily salty. The only bright exception was the Red Snapper which was accompanied by hominy-like side.\n\nI'd recommend Limon for a place to have a drink, but would forego as a dinner destination.", "author": "Karen R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-29", "description": "Okay, I had no idea there was a Limon and a Limon Rotisserie. So when we walked out of Taqueria La Cumbre and saw \"LIMON\" across the street, I just assumed it was the Limon Rotisserie we had planned on going to next (we were in the midst of a food crawl). There was even a catering van with the words \"Limon Rotisserie\" parked in front! But hey, it's my fault for being lazy and not double checking the address. And the two restaurants are related, so I can't exactly accuse them of false advertising.\n\nAnyhow, we actually got lucky because even though we didn't make a reservation, they had a table available as long as we were out within an hour and a half; no problem! \n\nUpon being seated, we were given a menu and we all looked for the dish we came to eat. After I went through it twice, I asked the server where the rotisserie chicken was.\n\n\"We don't have rotisserie chicken. That would be at Limon Rotisserie, which is a few blocks away.\"\n\nOH. Good one Ken. You moron. (I was in charge of this food crawl.)\n\nSo now comes the dilemma: do we walk out of this nice restaurant, looking like fools, or do we just stay and try out this restaurant? We opted for the latter.\n\nSince we had been on an eating binge, we just ordered two appetizers and a main dish among the three of us. I wasn't fond of the Anticuchos de Pollo; while the chicken itself was tender, the marinade was rather boring. And I've had much better sweet potato fries. The Costillas Nikkei (spare ribs), on the other hand, were the highlight of the meal IMO. \"Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside\" isn't exactly how I usually describe ribs, but that's what these were. The meat just slid off the bone with that sweet rocotto-soy sauce. Delicious. My friends kindly let me have a second rib (4 ribs for 3 people).\n\nFinally, the Lomo Saltado was quite good. I've had better fries in Lomo Saltados, but there was no questioning the quality of the meat they used here. Medium-rare, juicy and tender. Enough said.\n\nNot a bad place to check out, as long as your intention is to go to Limon (which is trendier) and not Limon Rotisserie.", "author": "Ken K."}

I can't even begin to describe the flavors...I had a beet salad of some sort, rotisserie chicken, sangria and some other things - all out of this world good and it came out in record time after ordering.  Prices very reasonable to boot. \nNow the bad - parking was a nightmare at peak dining time, but then again it is in San Fran.  They clearly make their money by turning tables quickly and so while you don't feel rushed by the wait staff, you do get the feeling that they don't want you lingering too long unless you're still ordering food and drinks.  They won't seat you until your entire party is there...so if you get dropped off while someone else finds parking, you'll have to wait until they get back which is annoying.  \nDespite the few minor annoyances, the food completely makes up for it.

They did not serve 3 of the magnificent dishes that are well advertised on other Yelp reviews (e.g., red snapper, pork chop, and grilled octopus).  This was even on a Saturday night, when a customer expects to see the full gamut on the menu!!!  Really a bummer, because the pics of all those dishes looked magnificent.\n\n2.  The dishes were very small (albeit the presentation was a work of art), so it didn't feel like a bang for your buck.  Granted, most folks head to Limon for tapas style dining.  Still, if you are planning to go with a small group of friends, you better plan on order two of each plate to satiate your hunger.", "author": "Rick A."}

Seems to be a little bit of a scene. \n\nMy only complaint was that they wouldn't substitute the 2 sides on the 1/4 chicken dish for a different side that wasn't part of that plate.

The oil wasn't too over powering like some truffle mac and cheeses I've tried before. The cheese was really light too. It wasn't super heavy. \n\nCiviche Mixto: The fish was really fresh. The lemony flavor was really light. I really enjoyed it. \n\nSwet Potato Fries and Regular Fries: They're just regular fries. Nothing special. \n\nVegetales Salteados: Grilled veggies with a hint of salt. They really compliment the dishes well. They were slightly crunchy, not because they were burnt, but because they were only slightly grilled. I wish I had more. \n\nTacu Tacu: Its like a rice and bean paste. Not memorable. \n\nAnticuchos De Res: Beef heart was surprisingly not bad. It doesn't have that gamey flavor I was expecting. I wouldn't eat too much though because its really high in cholesterol. \n\nCostillas Nikkei: I didn't get a chance to eat any. They were gone as soon as I considered trying it. Maybe that's a sign that they were delicious?\n\nCarne Empanadas: Honestly my favorite part of the meal. They were really tasty. The sauce was so flavorful but not overpowering that you couldn't taste the flaky crust. They only come 2 per order so I suggest ordering multiple plates...or several...\n\nOverall, the food here is good. The atmosphere is what you would expect a trendy place in the Mission to look like.

If it was just a little cheaper I'd probably come a bit more often. As it is, I would generally opt to spend a little more and spring for La Mar downtown. It was tasty but very straightforward Peruvian food - no surprises here. Tasty, great food, yes, but not an interesting twist like you get at La Mar.\n\nI got the Beef short ribs as well as Cabiche Classico, both were very nice. Maracuya Sour was an exciting prospect, but could have been more Maracuya-heavy. They didn't have any Chicha Morada when we were there, but I bet it's good and would be nice to try another time.", "author": "Mike J."}

We were seated pretty quickly once most of our group had arrived.  We ordered a bunch of dishes to share family-style -- roasted chicken (obviously), lomito saltado, chicharron de pollo, ceviche, truffle mac & cheese, veggie empanadas, and a couple of other things.  Basically the only thing we didn't finish easily was the truffle mac & cheese -- delicious but on the heavy side and not so Peruvian-seeming.  The food and drink were excellent, and the service was friendly (like, jokey-flirty friendly, maybe because we had an all-ladies' table). \n\nSeveral in our party ordered the sangria -- very tasty.  We ordered a couple mango lemonades (good) and strawberry lemonade (not so good).  Panna cotta mango dessert -- wonderful.\n\nGiven the amount of food and drink we ordered, we were all pleasantly surprised by the bill (which came out to $23 pp).\n\nThe only issue about bringing a group here is that groups are seated in the lower level (basement) of the restaurant, and on a Monday night, it got super loud!

We ordered several dishes to share - a number of the ceviches and crudos and a couple of orders of the empanadas before tucking into our mains.\n\nThe upshot - definitely stick with the ceviches (delicious, fresh fish, tender calamari - leche de tigre is a dazzling, perfect marinade ) - perhaps eschew the Tres Tiempos that boasted 3 fishes with 3 sauces but these turned out lacking in flavor.  The empanadas had a fantastic crust, and were filled with savoury cubes (rather than ground) of beef, served with a nice creamy dipping sauce. \n\nBlandness unfortunately returned with the mains - though the Whole Fried Fish was striking in presentation - the filleted carcass artfully used as a decorative serving vessel, in which nestled chunked fried fish flesh --  the dish, and its sauce -- lacked salt. The Chuleton Don Carlos pork chop was  thick, with a nicely frenched bone  - the server forgot to give me a steak knife and I had to ask for one, but even their version of a steak knife (practically unserrated) was not the best tool to cut through the chop, measuring just shy of an inch around... it seemed juicy but a bit tough and overcooked, and I missed the beautiful savoury meaty flavours from a Nopa or Blue Plate chop.  There was definitely something lacking in its pallid taste.  The dish could have also used a bit more of the cabbage and bacon accompaniment.\n\nI did have a nice drink - a Soju Sour -refreshingly light, almost like a perfectly-balanced lemonade, not overly sour, not overly sweet.  If we were to return, we may just opt for a drink and focus on the ceviches and other smaller plates, skipping the mains.", "author": "Claudine C."}

If the red blood in my food wasn't enough my second plate was burned to a crisp.I ended up telling the waiter to take my food back because I was so disappointed that I told him to forget it and that I didn't want anything. He brings me the check and tries to charge me for food I did not even eat!

Very open and nicely lit space, with plenty of kitchen candy for those craving a great Peruvian taste.  I know, I know most of you love and swoon over La Mar, but to me thats all faux and not the real fur!  Limon comes the closest in my opinion to good peruvian food outside the home.  The drinks are stiffly made and always appealing on the eye.  Even the beer is poured sexy over here.  \n\nOnce your ready to bite down don't skimp, go crazy and order all the delish treats.  The Ceviche De Pescado is fresh raw fish marinated lightly in garlic, lime, and purple onion.  Taste very fresh, and you will enjoy every bite as if your where down in Mira Flores Peru on vacay.  You definitely wanna go with some Chicharron de Pollo, which is Chicken fried to perfection so it has that perfect crunch in every bite.  If you like spicy be sure to ask the waiter for \"fresh Rocoto sauce\", this stuff is so tasty you'll be addicted and searching where to get the ingredients to make it.  Don't mistake it for the 3 sauces they bring out for you in the beginning, those are Aji Amariilo, Chimichurri, and Rocoto Cream.  The Ahi Tuna is also tasty but its not some Peruvian staple so you can afford to pass.  The Jalea is also tasty and has a variety of seafood deep fried in a tasty lightly salted batter with purple onions over it.

We did not make reservations but were seated pretty quickly.  I must say I was sort of surprised at the attire at this place - we were in jeans and felt somewhat out of place (seriously? in SF?) and the hostess was acting a bit snooty... The place was pretty crowded and I think I got knocked by passing waiters about 12x while we sat there.  The drinks were good, but pretty weak, especially for the guys I was with and they were slow to come by and ask if we wanted another round.  \n\nOf the food, we got several different things to share with varied success.  The short ribs and empanadas were actually VERY good. I would've probably gotten 2 orders of the short ribs had I known they were going to be so tender and delicious.  The quinotte de vegetables was alright... sort of dry for a risotto, but whatever... \n\nThe loma saltado was also pretty good but not necessarily a \"large plate\" to share. I think it was nearly empty after only two of us had served ourselves. It also wasn't really mindblowing - it was good, but it's sort of a miracle that I even remember tasting it now that I think about it. \n\nOverall this place is pretty overrated and the menu doesn't seem to make too much sense.

We ordered a variety of dished to share -- empanadas, paella, crab salad, beet salad, truffle mac and cheese, tuna tartare, stuffed chicken breat and tuna ceviche.  I love that the menu is designed to eat family style so you get to try lots of different things.  Our server was attentive and kept our water glasses full, even though it was a busy night.\nOne thing kept me from giving them 5 stars, and that was their process of \"confirming\" my reservation.  At 5:45, an hour before my reservation, I received a call saying that they were confirming my reservation.  He was a bit rude, asking if everyone in the party was coming (my reservation was for 6), and said that they were very busy and would give the table away if we were more than 15 minutes late.  I understand all of these things (I've worked in restaurants), but reservation confirmations should be done well before the time of seating.  The whole situation came off as an excuse to threaten to give our table away.  It put a damper on my celebratory mood, but we shook it off and got in the car.  \nUnbelievably, I got another call on my water to the restaurant, this time just 30 minutes before my reservation.  The gentleman launched into his spiel of confirming my reservation because they were busy... and then asked me to hold -- putting me on hold just 10 seconds after getting me on the line.  He came back on and I told him that I had spoken with someone just 30 minutes earlier confirming my reservation.  He said, \"Oh okay, we just want to make sure.\"  I was dumbfounded.  I feel like it's same to assume that another large party had walked in and they wanted to give our table away.  To be fair, I don't know that for sure, but I see no other explanation for 2 phone calls \"confirming\" our reservation so close to our seating time.\nIt was the night before the playoff game, so I understand that they were busy and the staff was stressed, but I really don't see any excuse for what happened.

That's when we went.  There are less expensive options in the Mission but the setting was clean and modern, and the service was good.  Our seating was available 20 minutes after our reservation though..  \n\nAll of the food we ordered was very good and a great introduction to Peruvian dishes: lomo saltado, chicken chicarron, seafood paella, yuca fries, and the mojitos.  Although the rice in the paella could be less salty.  Try the yuca fries - that was pretty unique and tasty.  I want to find some yuca roots at the supermarket now.\n\nTIP:  The place was pretty loud, so raise your voice if you want to hear one another.

The hostess offered us to sit at the bar or else wait to see if any of the number of reservations they had turned out to be no shows. \n\nWe opted to sit at the bar and wait for a table. It turned out we didn't even get time to order a drink and she was ready to seat us.\n\nThe service was very polite and attentive, however, I did feel that it may have been almost too efficient that it gave the impression of feeling rushed.\n\nFor a place that is at the price point it is, I would expect not to feel too much like they just want to turn the table. It wasn't enough to truly bug me, but I thought I'd note it for fairness, because I'm about to RAVE about some of their food.\n\nWe ordered some mojitos to start which came quickly and tasted great. No too citrusy or too syrupy. A nice balance.\n\nIf you order anything at this place you MUST get the following:\n\nCarne Empanadas - We order a second serve they were so good. The filling was so full of flavor and unique. YUM!!\n\nYucca Fries - Pica Pica down the road serves something similar, but these blow it out of the water. I'm a big fan of my fried foods and the texture of these things is just perfection - the dipping sauces are divine too.\n\nTruffle Mac and Cheese - I'm a whore for truffle anything and mac and cheese is probably one of the worlds most perfect comfort foods. This dish is perfectly truffled and perfectly cheesy. Again, we ended up ordering another helping of this side - we are dubbing it \"Crack and Cheese\".\n\nThe other stuff we ordered was the fried chicken tenders and the calamares rellenos. The chicken tenders were OK, but I felt the chicken was sort of these straggly bits of chicken thigh that seemed a bit overdone (almost jerky like in some of the parts).\n\nThe calamares rellenos was really not my cup of tea. The dish wasn't \"bad\" -- it looked beautiful, but the flavor was very fishy and I guess it just wasn't me.\n\nI felt the service could have been a little warmer and relaxed, but all in all I would definitely go back here.\n\n4 stars!", "author": "Lachlan M."}

I made reservations for my birthday dinner. A party of 30 is hard to accommodate in the city.  I accidentally made reservations for both Limon restaurant and Limon Rotisserie, my mistake I understand.\n\nHere is my problem with the restaurant.  We had checked in 15 mins prior to our reservation.   Over an hour later and we were still not seated.  It took 30 mins of complaining to the hostess to finally get the manager to come talk to us.  She then spent the next 30 mins walking from front of the restaurant to the back with the excuse of checking in on the table and towards the end to talk to the owner.   Final result was that they would try to seat us at the main level of the restaurant instead of the second level.  Problem was that we would have to wait for some tables to open up first.  \n\nI understand there was some miscommunication with reservation; however they still had us down for the time slot we requested earlier when we checked in.  If the restaurant couldn't accommodate our party, they should have been honest with us in the beginning instead of stringing us along for over an hour.

Pretty empty in there, but nice ambiance. Definitely feels very nice and is a little Oasis from the psychosis of 16th street. \n\nI had one Cristal and one Cusquena ($4 each). Love Peruvian beer. Both were delish. My fam were ordering some pink prickly pear drinks that they said were amazing. We got two orders of the empanadas, some kind of fried seafood combination thing, and the chicharron de pollo for about $8-9 each. \n\nThe empanadas were really good. They were about average size, good amount of really flavorful beef inside of them. They came with a pretty good dipping sauce, but it did not blow me away. The seafood combination was not very good in my opinion. Just a bunch of pieces of fried calamari, shrimp, cod, and, of course, yucca. The yucca was out of place, the cod was not really seasoned. I didn't try the shrimp, but overall I could have done better at home. \n\nThe chicharron de pollo stood out as clearly the best dish. It was a good sized portion, the flavor was amazing, and it came with a great dipping sauce. The chicken pieces were pretty crispy on the outside, but were still tender with an amazing glaze. I really liked this dish and thought it was worth the money. \n\nOverall, I would probably come back if they had a happy hour, but the prices were pretty steep for what you get.

We have reservations at 7:30 so we decided to get some booze at Blondies next door (already one star for being walking distance to a cool bar).  We were sat promptly and we had to order from the prefix menu due to the large table. Everyone ordered everything off the prefix menu so I got to try a little something off everyone's plate:\n\n1. Ceviche with fish, shrimp and squid:  without a doubt' the highlight of the meal. The lemon sauce was delicious and the fish did not have that \"fishy\" taste. I don't even eat seafood and I didn't even order it but I was able to jack a couple of pieces from around the table. \n2. Beef empanadas: not bad. Just got one and though it looked pretty sad, I ate the he'll out of it!  Beef was cooked right; the crust was crispy and light \n3. Sirloin and rice: so friggin good I almost wet my pants!  The steak was delicious and cooked just right but for some reason, the rice was like I was back at home with my moms cooking!  So good I had to ask for more rice and prayed to the gods that they would bring some soy sauce (maggi) \n\nThe best part of the night wasn't even the food; it was the excellent staff and their ultimate friendliness toward our loud ass group.  Granted we had a large group and there were tons of loud ass people at the table, there was this old person come up to the table to tell us to shut up. Literally, he went to two tables and asked us to shut up because we were too loud at a mission restaurant. He even asked the wait staff to call the police on us.  Again, Mission Restaurant, Saturday night, loud tables everywhere, and you're asking us to shut it up?  I'm so happy the wait staffs told them to STFU and if you don't like it, go to another restaurant because this restaurant is only for fun people!

It tastes so good, I don't understand why anyone would cook it any other way (with the only excuse being not having a rotisserie) or not order it when eating here.  As good as the chicken is, the sauces that accompany it are equally amazing.  One in particular is orange in color with herbs and is so addictive.  I'd use it as a dipping sauce for everything given the chance.  We also ordered their seafood paella and empanadas.  The paella was delicious and light and the empanadas had a good good dough with savory filling.  With each round of food we ordered various cocktails and wine.

Clearly they have a policy to move people through the place as quickly as possible to maximize profits for the night. From the moment we sat down the waitress was on us every minute for us to order. This continued throughout the meal, along with the cheque, which appeared without asking as soon as the desert plates were taken away.\nThe starters came in literally 3 minutes and once any plates were even remotely finished they were whipped away in an instant. Waiter and table staff hovered continuously ready to snap up any empty dish or glass. At the end of the main course all the dishes were collected and the staff then tried to take my friends plate even though he was clearly not finished.\nThis reached a breaking point when one staff member, before anyone could even blinked an eye, grabbed several cocktails that were not even empty and carried them away. When we complained about this to the manager he seemed barely interested, and denied that we were being rushed. \nI have never been made to feel so unwelcome in a restaurant in all my life, and the level of stress that the constant pressure to order/eat/order/eat/pay/leave spoiled the evening. Added to this the Warriors basketball game was on the TV's above the bar (is it a sports bar or a restaurant?) which is tremendously distracting, and the roars and cheers made the already noisy room way too loud at times to hold a conversation.\nI was surprised to get a table at Limon at short notice on a Friday night, although it was crowded when we got there, but I cannot imagine how a restaurant can survive by basically treating their customers like cattle to rush through like on a conveyor belt. I felt very sorry for the staff, who are obviously under great pressure to enforce this ridiculous policy, and are the ones who have to bear the brunt of their customers ire.\nAn incredible, almost surreal experience that I will never subject myself or my friends to ever again - there re too many other excellent choices to eat at in the Mission.", "author": "Stuart L."}

I was crushed to find out that the ill planning led to the demise of a most savory idea she floated of celebrating at Lime.  Even though it was an all girl's affair except me, much to B-Bop's displeasure, I was looking forward to downing bottomless mimosas and hanging with the band of merrymakers that make up the Castro.  Giggling at this prospect two days in advance and focusing my joy into dingling Clitter's clitoris, I immediately stopped strumming when I found  that last minute change predicated that this shindig would now be held at Limon.  While I knew nothing of this place, I knew it a) wasn't Lime and b) didn't have bottomless mimosas.\n\nArriving for brunch, Limon was aesthetically pleasing.  Our hostess smiled warmly and sat us, while a team of serveurs swarmed us with service.  Handed drink menus, I ordered the pineapple martini which turned out most thirst-quenching.  Waiting for the birthday girl and her troops, we partook in a B.Wong roast and exchanged her top 10 most shameful episodes.  I did not know any so I made up stories.  (jkjk...this did not happen).  When she arrived, the girl obligatories were done.  Hugs were given and the \"you look so good\", \"you look so skinny\" exchanges were done in a robotic, sluttish fashion well-versed due to repetition.  Because I was the lone guy, I blankly watched this spectacle sipping my martini, bemused and strangely felt left out.  We each ordered our own plates, but freely shared with each other.  I ordered the choros limon, steamed PEI mussels with bacon, spicy pimento sauce, onions and chimichurri french fries.  Limon is very prompt with their service and there was hardly any wait time.  My mussels were presented artfully.  I would hardly quantify my dish as a meal.  It was literally 12 mussels and a handful of fries.  I devoured this in about 5 minutes.  First off, my dish was extremely salty.  The bacon added to that.  As a result, I left this meal extremely thirsty and unsatisfied.  My french fries were made using extra small russell potatoes no doubt and were soaked by the broth for the mussels.  The should not have been paired and instead, should have been separated by a man made barrier or another dish perhaps.  Other dishes I tried:\n\n1.  mac and cheese: Huckleberry Finn ordered this along.  All the girls were oo-ing and ahh-ing over this dish, however, to me, it sucked ass.  The cheese was good however the pasta used had a very hard consistency.  \n\n2.  sweet potato fries:  Huck Finn also ordered this.  It was okay.  The fries here are cut super thin.  A forcep of your index and thumb will lift half the fries outta the dish.  I couldn't to avoid looking greedy.  Limon is very scant with their portions.\n\n3.  The best dish was the Lomo Salado which was basically fajitas with 2 sunnyside eggs on top.  It was the most normal dishes and most hearty.  I wish I ordered this.  \n\n4.  I don't know what my gf got but it basically looked like a mound of yack, shaped nicely.  It did not taste good at all. \n-edit- she got the quinotto de vegetales (still tasted like ass)\n\nLimon is a classy joint that screams \"come in me\"  (hehe) when you walk by with an arm linked with yours.  If you are with the guys, you will mostly skip this place and head to Frijtz at the corner.  The food here is mediocre and over the top salty.  You might as well pour Mortons salt out of the carton down my throat.  The portions only give you enough fuel to last for a half-hour before you are beside yourself with hunger.  Damn this place.", "author": "Brian V."}

From the nice hostess who encouraged us to pick whatever table we wanted, to our skilled, friendly server, to the bussers who were constantly wiping down our table - everyone at Limon made us feel right at home.  When we left, about 4 of Limon's employees thanked us for stopping in. \n\nDELICIOUS FOOD:  The sangria was good but the food was even better!  We started off with the Ceviche de Pescado (halibut marinated in lime juice, with yam and Peruvian corn).  It was one of the best ceviches I've ever had and it was a good sized portion.\n\nI ordered the Pargo Rojo which was beautifully and creatively presented.

The citrusy tartness of the ceviche was mellowed nicely by the smooth and understated sweetness of some of the best sangria that I've ever tasted Seriously the stuff was so good, if the folks at Limon filled a bath tub with sangria, and said the only way I could enjoy it was drinking from a thimble, I'd still go to town. I highly suggest forgoing the glass and opting for the carafe, a perfect size for sharing with that special someone.\n\nNext up we had the Quinotto de Vegetales, a delightful risotto style mixture of quinoa, carrots, zucchini, and mushroom. Quinoa may be a pseudo cereal, but the taste sure is real. Real good. The feast was rounded out by the Lomo Saltado, a tender and juicy wok-tossed sirloin that hit all the right notes.\n\nWhat impressed me as much as the tasty food that evening, was the impeccable service. Seating was prompt, and super easy having booked through the Opentable link directly on the Yelp page. Water was always topped off, and place settings were changed at least twice during the meal. The staff was so on point it was almost creepy. There was an instance during the date when I walked 10 feet to the bar area to get a paper napkin, and by the time I had turned around and walked back to the table, my napkin had been refolded and placed on the table.

I have to say I was impressed.\n\nI wasn't too hungry so I just grabbed a couple appetizers. Oh yeah, I had to get a mojito made special there.\n\nFirst app was the red snapped ceviche. The portion size was a lot more than I expected and every bite held its own. The fish was very fresh and wasn't out done by the marinade. \n\nNext app was the fried chicken. I can't remember what the sauce on the side was but it had a slight ginger taste to it. The dish reminded me of jerk chicken but better than I've ever had.\n\nFeeling good I sipped on a local beer, anchorstein. Doesn't dissapoint.\n\nThank you Nina for the recommendation.

I sweet-talked some friends into coming with me to make a brunch out of it, and frankly, I'm embarrassed that I raved about it so much.  There goes my food cred! \n\nWhy was it so bad?  Oh let me count the ways:\n\n1.  The service was terrible.  They didn't honour reservations and the wait with reservations was close to an hour.  The attitude for the delay was something along the lines of \"This is what it is.  Deal with it.\"\n2.  The entire time there was this massive lineup, you could see the top floor of the restaurant open and unused.\n3.  Once we did sit down no one came to our table for a good 10 mins.\n4.  When we tried to order, a request for a substitution was shot down so fast my friend sat there speechless for a few moments before she found a voice to say she was still going to order the same dish\n5.  When we asked for sauce on the side, we were charged extra (but not told upfront)\n6. Our order took forever to come... meanwhile we enviously eyed people who came in after us order, receive, and eat their dishes\n7. When the order actually came I did a double-take.  The Chicharron dish portion was so small it only filled 1/4 of the plate.  To add insult to the injury, they put this tiny portion on the top right quadrant of the plate, leaving the rest of the stark white plate...empty.  This is a meal, not an art piece.  Couldn't you stick a few pieces of lettuce on the plate to make it look like you're getting more? Or at least try to trick us with a smaller plate?\n8.

The veggie people made the most of it - but it would have been nice to have a few more options.  \n\nFor apps we had a ceviche trio, we selected 3 diff ceviches, we got: Limon (signature octopus dish), Nikkei (tuna), and Pescado y Camaran (snapper and shrimp) - my fav was tuna.  The octopus mixture was a bit too tangy for my taste.  The snapper and shrimp frankly was not too memorable - but I am not a big fan of cold shrimp.  \n\nWe ordered the arroz con mariscos - the Peruvian paella - which unfortunately never came - thankfully because we had ordered way too much food.  I would have liked to try this because saw a few adjacent tables order it and looked very good.  \n\nWhat we did get includes: \nLomo Saltado - the Peruvian style rice and sirloin strips - I did not eat it (dont eat beef) but those that did enjoyed it with one caveat its very salty - but apparently thats supposed to be that way.  The garnish and presentation was pretty good.  \n\nTrigo & Veg con Pesto - this was the big hit on the table with everyone.  It was tasty, different and very refreshing tasting. Highly recommend it.  The veggie empanadas were ok not quite anything to write home about though.  Taratar de Tuna - was also a big hit - very refreshing, lemony but I enjoyed it.  We also ordered the sweet potato fries and mac-n-cheese - both were just ok, nothing to write home about.  The sweet potato fries - are made as huge wedges - and just did not cook all the way through (as a result of the size) while the mac-n-cheese was better, they use white cheese and truffle oil - it was definitely worth trying and different way of preparation for mac & cheese.  \n\nFor post-dinner sweets - we had choc bandido and profiteroles - both were awesome.  The choc bandido is just unbelievable and definitely worth the extra 20minutes (ok, probably extra 30mins) on the treadmill!  Its served warm choc cake with dulce de luche (caramel) and it is really really good.  I would order 1 less entree and wait to order this dessert.  The profiteroles - were ok - I am not a big fan plus frankly the choc cake overtook the attention.  \n\nOverall the place is loud, very difficult to hear and talk - if you go with a large group and are trying to get substantive conversations (be aware).  It was loud enough that the server didnt hear a couple of items that we ordered.  I would go back again - but not first on my list.", "author": "Bhavin M."}

The cocktails are delicious, and clearly made with love. My favorite is the one that features Pisco and Green Chartreuse (can't find the name on any of these online menus). \n\nWe got the seafood ceviche- amazing. It came with a shot glass full of some sort of Peruvian concoction. We both took a small sip to sample it before pouring it all over the dish- yum. That was probably my favorite dish, as I am a huge seafood lover. The concoction definitely added a slightly spicy and acidic bite that completed the dish.  We also got the Costillas Nikkei (St. Louis pork ribs)-- which were incredibly tender and flavorful. \n\nWe also got the signature chicken, which was the biggest disappointment of the meal- maybe about 3/3.5 star dish. I think that their mistake is making it their \"signature dish\"--- it raises expectations and sets you up for disappointment. I think that if it weren't advertised as the signature dish, it would probably fare better in these reviews. Even so, I can't take away a star. Everything else was just too stellar.

This place is so great! I have not anything here that wasn't good.\n\nGreat great things:\n- Pollo a la brasa: I love that there are options for this. You can get a quarter, half, or a whole chicken, which makes it the perfect dish for either yourself or for sharing purposes. It is tender m juicy, and so flavorful! I do wish that the number of sides went up when you got a bigger order of chicken, but that's a minor detail.\n- Yuca fries: Thick, fried, starchy goodness. The three dipping sauces that come with the chicken are perfect to add flavor to the fries.\n- Ceviche mixta: This is so visually appealing, it's almost sad to eat until you realize that you're in for a symphony of flavors the minute you take a bite. It's unlike any fishy ceviche I've had before; acidic, fresh and so delicious. I absolutely love the corn kennel and the sweet potato pieces.\n- Seco de costillas: The braised shortribs; the sauce on this is amazing. The portion is a bit small, so it really is a \"small plate.\" Still, excellent flavors!\n\nMost plates cost between $10-15 (except the larger portions of chicken), so it's totally reasonable for the quality of food you're getting.

I can understand \"oh about 15 minutes, we're prepping your table\" or \"we're just a few minutes behind\" but 45 minutes?  C'mon guys.  What made it worse was the server's \"so what?\" attitude.  At a least a \"sorry\" or \"man, we're just really busy!\" but there was no emotional response whatsoever.  It was almost the opposite, like \"f-off, who cares?\"  We went across the street to Urbun Burger where the woman behind the counter was all smiles, we got our food quickly and were stuffed, long before the 45 minute wait we would have endured at Limon.\n\nSunday, 11:30am\n\nThis was a much different scene.  For \"brunch\", Limon was empty.  There were only 2 other parties, one of whom was finishing up.  There was a hostess and 4 servers, which means for a good portion of our stay, there was a 1:1 server:table ratio.\n\nWe were seated immediately, and it took 15 minutes before we were were acknowledged.  Remember, at this point there are more servers than patrons.  What.  The.  What?  Finally we were acknowledged and we ordered everything in at once.\n\nP.s. This was the last time we saw our waiter.  Honest to God.  Not even there for the bill.  Probably for the best, because the tip was 10% and that was only because we used the Groupon.  If we didn't it would have been almost nothing.\n\nWe ordered a couple of appetizers (Limon Ceviche and Oyster Shooters) along with two drinks (Incan Bloody Mary, Strawberry Mojito).  This was the best part of our meal.  The ceviche was good (if not slightly on the small side) and the oyster shooters were very good.  The bloody mary was spicy as hell, which is also fine.  Unfortunately, this was probably the worst mojito I've ever been served.  First, the only thing \"strawberry\" about it was the color.  Second, the club soda was completely flat.  Third, there was way too much rum.  Guys, it's 11:30 in the morning.  I'd like to be able to walk out of here and not take a taxi home.  Holy crap.  I mean I'm not 19 anymore - I actually want my drink to taste good :) Fourth, there was barely any mint or sweetness too it.  It was like drinking a glass of rum with crushed mint.  Yuck.\n\nNext was \"The Long Wait\".  We waited 1h 15m from the time we arrived at Limon for our mains to appear.  That means we waited about 1 hour from the time we ordered.\n\nWhat's worse was that we saw 3 Lomo Saltados go to 2 other tables that sat down long after we ordered.  I'm pretty sure the person delivering the food (not our waiter) messed up, because after we asked where are food was, the server went over to the waiter who looked confused, walked around looking at nearby tables then back to the kitchen.  Our food came out 5 minutes later.\n\nThe mains aren't even worth writing about.  The Lomo was good, meat cooked perfectly although they charged us for a teeny tiny cup of chimmichurri(sp?) on the side.  Chicken was dry and a woefully small portion (NOTE: this is not the same chicken as the bistro, which is excellent), as well as my wife's seafood soup.\n\nThere is no way on Earth we're going back here, and neither should any of you.\n\nYou spent $20 for that Groupon.

They really need to serve better dipping sauces with them.  Where is the garlic aioli that these bad boys were made for??\n\nThe waiter was also incredibly inattentive.  I think he came to our table a total of 2 times during our meal.\n\nI think this will probably be my last time having dinner at Limon.  I think for the price, you are MUCH better off going to the rotisserie, surly service and all (see past review).  The rotisserie has better menu offerings... I have NO idea why the restaurant doesn't serve the delicious chicken that Limon is known for!", "author": "Julie S."}

When applied in right proportions, the citrus and seafood combo is literally mouth watering!!  Add to that some other S American flavors centered around the main attraction of Ceviche coupled with rotisserie style meats or fantastic cuts of beef, and you can really have wonderful meals.  With all that said, Limon is just ok - I recall it being above average when it opened, however, this time around it fell a bit flat - ceviches didn't pop, main entrees were a bit lack luster and overall just didn't stand up to Passion.  Would have liked to see more vibrant flavors (chefs - cardinal sin is to NOT flavor food!!!!).  Still not bad, just not great.", "author": "Richard D."}

We have a decade-long ritual of treating each other to lunch/dinner at a new place each year. So I looked into Limon, and found out they were starting a brand new happy hour beginning Monday, August 30, which coincidentally was the day I was taking her to dinner...It was a sign! We are both happy hour junkies, so we were excited to be among the first to try their happy hour. We also dined from their dinner menu.\n\n- Ceviche Nikkei de Atun ($12): One of my favorites because it's like a cross between carpaccio and tuna sashimi. It's actually ahi tuna, but it's prepared like carpaccio. It's served with thinly sliced green onions on top, and a small side of garbanzo beans and sweet potato wedge. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=bGTZGvC3msSXAJwFACz8UQ)\n- Calamares/calamari ($6, happy hour): Compared to other dishes, this one was generously portioned. Calamari was cooked perfctly and the outside was crisp and warm. Loved the sauce. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=2sRtBMF2em5iYKc-okWFow)\n- Ensalada Verde/Green Salad ($8):  I was a bit disappointed with the small portion. It was basically just greens with cucumber and red onion. Nothing to rave about. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=xo4c1h12MKyIAdCCyxd0NQ)\n- Perihuela ($10) - very similar to cioppino, which I love! This dish consisted of a large crab leg, scallops and prawns, served in a cioppino broth. I only wish the portion were larger, but every bite was delectably delicious and flavorful. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=DxW1IKV4II6qJgEuePxcMg)\n- Cream puffs ($7.50): Comes with four golf ball-sized cream puffs sprinkled with confectioner's sugar. The cream in the middle was fluffy and had the perfect amount of sweetness. I would definitely get this again. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=ik-MQY7boJZ2WbmHxrnH1g)\n- Chocolate brownie w/ strawberries: Was served warm with a strawberry compote and whipped cream. The chocolate was really rich and sweet - I am not a huge chocolate lover so it wasn't my personal favorite. But if you love chocolate, you'll become a fan. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=2zKwd4uqWwIg2bq8ZoDjYg)\n- Mojito ($5, happy hour) - strong and crisp. Perfect! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=FHze1DbNsc25VpXxavCJ3w)\n- Sangria ($3, happy hour) - deep and red, served with diced fruit. At $3 a pop during happy hour, I could drink these all night.\n\nAdditional things to note:\n- Happy hour: Monday - Thursday from 4-6pm. $3 sangrias and beers, $5 house cocktails, and a variety of appetizers ranging from $1 oysters to $6 calamari. See their happy hour menu here: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=q2414VU0yWIIfqZVGdw4vg)\n- The menu: The menu that Limon posts on ther website is not the same one we saw when we went to dinner. here is a picture of their menu: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chWLsfWUJ5k8-73t9FOM9A?select=oHJtS7XHOby3YaJVQq4LGg)\n- Service: Extremely attentive. Our server was easily able to answer all our questions about the menu. He \"hovered\" a bit too much, but I think he was just trying to make sure my cuz and I were happy. \n\nBottom line: Limon serves gourmet Peruvian fare with a modern twist in an elegant, colorful ambiance. And their new happy hour makes them even more irresistible.", "author": "Mariela D."}

The last time I went to Limon was probably about 3-4 months ago.  2010 was a year of Limon, though.  I went there a lot with my ex and we had many a fabulous meal there.  However, we went back this time during my trip and we were really startled by how different it was.  It seems like the quality of the food has gone downhill. \n\nFirstly, the ceviche.  I loved the ceviche here.  I loved it better than the ceviche at La Mar, and at Fresca.  I used to drink the citrousy juice it came in.  And those gigantic corn cornels?  Yum.  Well this time it was different.  Firstly, the dish (ceviche limon specifically) was bigger with way more fish than shell fish (hmmm).  But then I tasted it...they had put what tasted like a cheap powered spice on it that just tasted terrible and which burnt my mouth so much I had to request milk.  I told my friend to eat the rest of the meal, since I could not finish it.  He asked the bartender about the change since he was also startled by the difference.  The bartender made seem like it was good that they had added more fish, they had 'increased the portions', but my friend could tell that the bartender also was enthused about the change. \n\nThe other dishes we had that night, the spare ribs and the octopus were pretty boring.  The octopus, something I always like to order at Limon, was a little more interesting.  It came over what seemed like mashed potatoes and you could eat it in one full bite.  It was good, but nothing to write home about. \n\nAs usual, the wine was very good.  They have some very juicy blackberry full bodied wines here that I really like. I'd still get a drink here, and I will pray that they put the ceviche back together again.", "author": "Alexandra M."}

That said, the food was TASTY!!! We ordered the Ceviche Mandarin and the paelle and some glasses of wine :D\n\nThe ceviche was probably the star of the dinner, though the sauce on the paelle was delicious....the seafood on both plates was cooked wonderfully and tasted fresh and amazing. If you go to Limon I highly suggest the Ceviche Mandarin. Those two dished combined with two glasses of wine each was enough to fill us, but it's easy to rack up the monies when it comes to these \"small-plate\"/\"large plate\" restaurants. \n\nFor someone like myself who either makes dinner every night or eats out at more casual places, this was a nice change of scenery. I would definitely come back and try the other ceviches.\n\n**fun tidbit: there's a price descrapency for the 10 yr and 20 yr old Brawny wines.

The open kitchen is right below us and our party keeps getting the wafts of delicious smell.  Good and bad since we kept ordering more and more .. \n\nThis is probably hearsay but the birthday girl had the most difficult time getting reservations and getting seated here when she arrived.  Reservations for our party was at 5:30 p.m. because there wasn't any other available times for big parties.  We had the entire upstairs seating area for almost an hour to ourselves!  The birthday girl also said that when she arrived, the hostess tried to make her get prix fix for every single person in the party even though that was not the arrangement they have made.  My friend finally got her way but it just did not start off her birthday evening well and that's seriously not what a restaurant should be doing anyway!\n\nThe servers were attentive and accommodating.  However, the first small hot plate I got was not what I ordered.  And, the server wanted to argue with me!  He said that when I ordered, I pointed at the wrong dish on the menu.  Regardless of what happened, shouldn't the server have followed up with the dish I actually wanted?  I would have gladly paid for both dishes because they were both delicious!  The server's attitude was a little poor .. \n\nThe place got its stars because of its incredible food!  I got the Seco de Costillas (boneless short ribs) and the Quinotto de Vegetales (risotto) and both were fabulous!  I think our table got 5 or 6 orders of the short ribs because they were insanely well seasoned and the meat was just falling apart on its own.  The risotto was the error dish but I didn't mind at all.  It was very creamy couscous-like dish with vegetables chopped and mixed in it.  My only complaint is that its portion is too freaking tiny ... I had three bites and painfully shared the fourth. \n\nOur table also got the following, all of which I would recommend:\n- Arroz con Mariscos (paella) - just a little greasy for me\n- Lomito Saltado (sirloin strips) - but I prefer the short ribs\n- Pescado Limon - MUST GET THIS\n\nI would definitely return to try other dishes but definitely with only one or two other friends and a super well-communicated reservation.", "author": "Kimberly C."}

My husband and I had a pleasant experience at their Rotisserie and was looking forward to trying out the valencia location. On Sun of the labor day long weekend, we walked in to Limon on time for our reservation and was seated promptedly.  However, after that it all went downhill.  First, it took 15mins before our server stopped by to acknowledge us.  Few other waiters walked by in the meantime but nobody seems to want to make eye contact with us. It was strange because the restaurant was half empty.\n\nThe service continuds to be disappointing. Our food ended up taking an hour before hitting the table. What's worst was the guy who sat next table to me (which was empty when we arrived) had already started eating the same dish my friend and I ordered while our waiter was no where to be found.  We had to flag down other servers to check on our food.  It was a very frustrating.  Although our food was served  not long after we made a compliant, there was no explanation and no action taken to remedy the situation.\n\nMy husband ordered Chicharron de Pollo for $9.  The potion was clearly an appetizer size yet our waiter never bother to tell us at the time of order.  My Lomo Saltado con huevo was not bad but I guess after an hour and a half wait at a restaurant, anything eatible will suffice.  \n\nAnyway, our waiter never came back to our desk so we had to flag down another wait staff to get our bill and check out.  If we did not use groupon, I will put down a negative amount for the tips box.  \n\nI am not sure if the service \"downgrade\" was an side effect of their recent Groupon promotion.  But if the intent was to attract traffic to the restaurant in hope to lead to repeat purchase, Limon has failed miserably.   My 2nd groupon is going to the toilet.", "author": "Katy Y."}

I have no such complaints.\n\nOur server was really friendly and she checked on us several times.  The only thing that slightly ruined the experience was that we had to wait until after all of our food was out to get the sangria.  Our server forgot about it.  She actually checked on us once without noticing that it was not yet at the table, but I just thought that it may be taking some time as the bartender is busy.  Then she checked on us again a few minutes after all the food has arrived, but still didn't say anything about the drinks.  After that point, I baciscally said \"looky here, where my alcohol at!??!? (well, not quite in those words), she looked perplexed, then said, oh yes, you still don't have it, I am so sorry about it, then went to the bar and promptly brought it back to the table and apologized again.

Everything we ate wasssssssss Buenaso, which means sooooo delicious!!!! \n\nAlso the service was great for a party of eight. \n\n \nDrinks to try: \n\nInca Kola: Peruvian Cola...it's yellow but it tastes like heaven\n\nChicha Morada: It's made from special purple Peruvian Corn. It's sweet and delightful. \n\nDrinks with Alcohol: \n\nPisco: Peruvian's are known for their Pisco, which is a type of alcohol. Try a Pisco Sour, which is a traditional Peruvian cocktail or anything that has a little Pisco in it. \n\nPeruvian Beers are light but refreshing.

And with food and beverage outlets competing for their sunshine in San Francisco, any local will nod their head when it comes to Limon. \nThe Valencia branch is located in the middle, right across from Therapy. The hostess stand is on your left. Be escorted to a table, amidst a lively crowd. Plenty of drinking and laughs along the way. There for a girlfriend's birthday, We were seated in a back area, in a booth. The wooden tables, probably tired from another cover. We ordered the Jalea first to start. The crispy seafood was spot on and I enjoyed the hucatay tartar sauce. The pollo empanadas were good, but may I dare say I was disappointed? Maybe more meat? A little more flavor? But for a Peruvian place, I shouldn't have want to wish that. I should have been there. The ceviche was good, but again, may I dare say I've had better? No crisps to counter the taste. Maybe we didn't order the right things this time? Still good. \nThe chocolate cake though is amazing! Warm chocolate cake with a warm chocolate sauce with whip cream and a side of strawberries. Just the right amount. Now, that one was perfect. Will definitely order that again.", "author": "Jacqueline L."}

Ribs in a tangy soy-based sweet sauce with sesame seeds served with cole slaw.  The ribs could have been more tender, but that's my only criticism.  The sauce was incredible and beautifully plated.  The cole slaw should not be understated - it had a very nice mix, marinated in a vinegar dressing, which was a perfect counter to the sweet ribs.  \n\nI also had Carne Empanadas.  The meat filling was well composed, no odd bits of meat you sometimes find in empanadas.  The crust was baked perfectly and the yellow dipping sauce was mellow, but a great compliment.  I ate them mostly with the lime that came with it, which provided a great counter to the empanada itself.\n\nLastly, I had the Chocolate Bandido.  I've had my share of places that attempt a chocolate and ice cream dessert, but this was extremely well done.  I found the cookie (chocolate in crisps of leche quemada - I think) a little hard to eat because they were so hard, but the rest of the dessert was worth visiting this place alone.\n\nI also can't say enough about the staff.  The two servers that helped me, made me feel at home with recommendations and an extremely warm demeanor.  The woman waiter was extremely sweet and made my evening alone wonderfully memorable.  For those of you that care, the hostess and the woman waiter were both extremely easy on the eyes.  :)\n\nI can't wait to return and experience everything again.", "author": "Richard N."}

The sangria was also really good...shoot now I have 3 favorite sangrias in town (Papito #1, Esperento #2 and Limon #3).

The chicken was very flavorful and juicy, and it tasted great with the sauces on the side. I loved the rice here; it's sweet. Reminds me of a sticky rice dessert. The yuca fries were alright, in my opinion. I usually like skinny, crispy fries but the yuca fries were the complete opposite so I wasn't too fond of that.

It was also listed on my 7x7 100 of the \"must\" eats in the Bay Area.\n\nI was very excited as I heard great reviews of the ceviche and the rotisserie chicken.  At first glance, this restaurant is very modern and chic.  Nestled in the more \"upscale\" area of the mission district, this place is surrounded by bars and pubs, and local hang outs.\n\nEntree's ordered:  Oyster Shooters, Ceviche Limon, Pollo Latino, Seco De Cordero, another entree I have forgotten, a bottle of Riesling C&C 07, and Sangria\n\nFor this review, I am not going to even talk about the entree's.  The oyster shooters was served in a very lemony type of base.  The same base was used for the Ceviche.  Both I would say, are VERY good, since I love lemons! Thumbs up!\n\nBut here comes the part that really disappointed me.  For a place like this, I would not expect to find an insect in my glass of water.  It was a fruit fly or some small type of winged insect.  I picked up the glass and noticed it right away, fighting for its life.  The waitress saw me staring at the glass and immediately took it, apologized, and returned with a new glass.  Fine, It happens.....\n\nAfter enjoying the oyster shots, and while the waiter was putting down the ceviche, a cockroach literally runs across the table and up the wall, and stops where the wall met up with the trim.  It stood there as if to admire the incoming ceviche dish, which I had no intentions of sharing with it!  The waiter noticed the roach right after my friend gave out a shreek.  He proceeded calmly reached out with his table cloth and scooped up the roach, apologized,  and put down the ceviche plate.\n\nNow,  expecting to enjoy my main dish.... I really could not.  After the fly and the roach incident, I found it kind of hard to even swallow down my food (Reason for not even trying to rate the food here).  As for my friends, they could not either.  Over all experience, was just bad.  A fly? OK... but then a roach?.... Ok WTF?!  Something is wrong here!  I expected at least some kind of formal apology by the MOD, or some type of discount for the unpleasant experience.  Though we played it off like it wasn't a big deal at the time, it really WAS!\n\nI will not be coming back to Limon.

I'd been to strip malls in L.A. that had Lomo Saltado for $6-7 bucks, so I'm thinking \"this better be some damn fine saltado.\" For a second, I contemplated going to the store to buy the necessary igredients to make my own, but my stomach gave me a growl that said \"oh, no you don't, bucko\" (my stomach sounds like Richie Cunningham, doesn't it?)\n\nSo I ordered the saltado, and, since I was already knee deep in pursuit of this craving, I ordered a cocktail (limon mojito, for those curious) to kill the 5-10 minutes I figured I'd be waiting. The mojito was solid, but a medium pour (i.e., also a little pricey). While sitting there, I saw a couple dishes pass by. The crispy snapper looked really intriguing, as the fish, which look deep fried with the bones in tact, made for a dramatic plating.\n\nThe food came quicker than expected, as I had only nursed about half my cocktail. I chugged the last half, signed my check, left my tip, and headed out with the aroma of steak, onions, soy and other spices wafting up at me from the containers.\n\nIt didn't take me long to get home, and I had the rice and the saltado on a plate within minutes after entering through my front door. The moment of truth had arrived. First bite?..\n\nNice. Not too salty, but it was maybe a little too light on the flavor. I was sort of hoping for that little kick from the vinegar, but I wasn't quite getting it. I actually had to pull out a little of my own malt vinegar to pump it up just a tad. The meat was excellent, though. Very tender and juicy and nicely marinated. The meat, in fact, was what made the dish. The fries were ok (I like wedge cuts over fry cuts, and I like it when they have a little crisp to them), and the onions/tomatoes were fine but, as noted before, lacking the rich flavor that some saltados have.\n\nWhen I was done with the dish, I was happy. My hankering had been quelled, albeit not cheaply. I think I might check out Limon again sometime for some of the other dishes, although there are other spots that are awaiting my attention first. For Lomo Saltado, I'll probably stick to spots like Mi Lindo Peru.", "author": "Yato Y."}

I looked at my menu for awhile to pick out the meals I wanted to eat there and what I wanted to take out because eating forty dollars of food would have been a challenge or so I thought. \n\nI started with a Limon shooter and it was different. Then it was a tiny meals of seafood soup of some kind. I received it but the couple that sat down next to me ate the same thing and their dish looked larger. Hmm. And they were given utensils like a spoon. I'd already finished my meal so it was too late to ask for utensils. I just thought scooping up the soup with half of a oyster shell was the way to eat it. Silly me. \n\nI took out two meals, one of chicken and the other an egg dish with chewy sirloin tips. I eventually got the check but when it was presented to me, they called me mademoiselle. Really? I thought it was Peruvian food. I thought I misheard until it was done again. French? Why? \n\nWhen I got the food home, without the presentation, the food just looked sad. Forty dollars worth of food? Not really. I ended up owning sixbucks.The dishes are small and the service was slow. I don't think I'll be going back but if you have time on your hands and not all that hungry, it is a nice little place. It is on the pricey side.

Good for quickness, but skepticism-inducing for the critical eater. Since this is more of the flagship restaurant, relative to Limon Rotisserie, I was expecting the dishes to at least parallel, if not exceed the taste standards of Limon Rotisserie. \n\nUnfortunately, my favorite dish, the ceviche mixto, did not taste as fresh as the one I ALWAYS get at Rotisserie and which is ALWAYS top notch. There was a quinoa dish that was a tad slimy too. \n\nRedemption: The yucca fries I had tonight were better than the Rotesserie location. Perfect balance of thin-crispy shell with hot pillowy/flaky internals. And of course the classic Limon sauces. \n\nRedemption 2: the server gave us all a serving of a Peruvian drink which tasted like half cider half sangria (apologies for mangling the name/description of this drink), and explained to us that they were thankful that we could come in a little earlier than 10.

I was like yea i think we can eat in hour we were hungry so seated \nthe waiter never brought us water or anything!! he just came to the table to ask if we were ready so i said can we start with an order of Anticuchos? so he responded that we should order eveything together because they had a big party coming so i said fine no big deal so ordered 4 plates since the plates are so small we eat them in less than 20 min We were hungry!! so I asked the waiter if can order more because we weren't full and he said im sorry but You CAN'T order more Because when you guys were seated you agree to stay only an hour! I was in shock i said what you mean?? I CAN'T order???? you dont want me to spend more $$ in ur Restaurant??? i know they said an Hour but we are here only less than 35 minutes?? so refused to let us order more so i try to talk someone else and they said let me send the manager over.

First, we had a reservation for 7 and because parking was so scant, our party arrived in two groups. Though we were STARVING, the hostess refused to seat us on time until our whole party arrived. I understand that it was a Friday night, etc, but is it likely that another party of 7 will arrive and swoop our table? NO. So instead we had to huddle by the doorway all awkwardly for a good 15 minutes.\n\nOrdered some sweet potato fries at the bar to stave off our hunger. Of course they would arrive seconds before we were led to our table. They were amazing SPF though. Really good.\n\nWe also had an order of the truffle infused mac n cheese, which was also good but now that I think about it, these appetizers really do not agree with the rest of the menu. \n\nWe bought two bottles of wine ($15 corkage fee) which the servers happily uncorked and poured for us throughout our meal. \n\nOur waiter seemed a bit huffy with us after we dismissed his suggestion that we weren't going to be satisfied with one order of ceviche. SORRY we want a variety of tastes and enjoy sharing our food! Seriously we got attitude for the duration of our meal.\n\nAs for the food, well twas fantastic. We got the Ceviche Nikkei de Atun, which had a very Asian flavor. \n\nWe also got an octopus appetizer that was great but I can't find it on the menu online so I don't know what it is called. I think it comes with 3 and you probably won't want to share once you have had one bite, so keep that in consideration.\n\nThe Pargo Rojo was probably my favorite of the night : crispy red snapper fillet, coconut fried rice & rocoto-curry sauce. We were all obsessed with the coconut fried rice (super flavorful) and we picked the fish carcass completely clean like the Asians we are. Delicious!\n\nThe Aroz con Mariscos (Peruvian-style paella) was decent, though I think I prefer Spanish paella and I found the dish a bit small for the price. There was so little rice! The seafood was good and I do think that it works well for a single-serving dish. \n\nFor dessert we ordered a Bandido (warm chocolate cake with light strawberry compote vanilla ice cream, caramel tuile & chocolate sauce). Absolutely delicious. Imagine seven silver spoons digging into this hot mess and having the dish be wiped clean within a minute of its arrival. Before I had the O2 at Alexander's, this would have topped my all-time favorite chocolate dessert list.

We wanted to catch up, but I realized this wasn't really the place for that (too loud; granted we went around 7pm dinnertime). We shared three dishes - Seco de Costillas (braised boneless beef), Tartara de Tuna and Chicharron de Pollo. The quality of the food was generally pretty great. However, the Seco de Costillas was a way too salty for my tastes. They actually forgot our order for Chicharron de Pollo, but when we got it finally, it was really tasty. I would order that again for sure! \n\nDessert was fantastic, however. I would go there for a drink and dessert definitely.

I am NOT a Peruvian food fan, mainly because their star ingredient always seems to be . . .  the dreaded c-word. But Limon was SUCH a treat. I went here for my friend's birthday and had an excellent meal.\n\nFirst off, they immediately told me that they could make any appetizer, salad, and entree with or without cilantro - music to my ears (and to my boyfriend's ears sine he loves that green poison!).  \nWe had a few of the ceviches which were simply delicious - clean, fresh, and fantastic (especially the namesake one).  We also had oyster shooters which had the perfect amount of spice.\n\nThe salads were simple but refreshing, and my FAVORITE dish of the evening was the red snapper.  WHOA.  If you eat that with all the fixings that they give you on the plate (coconut rice, spinach, special sauce), it's like a ratatouille-inspired fireworks display in your brain.\n\nI didn't have a dessert but hopefully those were ok.  The drinks were good, but I think they should get a hard-liquor license.  And the service was friendly - no lasting bonds made, but no matter.  I also got to see right into the kitchen which I truly enjoyed.\n\nSO, for all you cilantro-haters (or even those of you who aren't sure yet), if you want to try Peruvian food, don't mind spending a few extra buckies, LIMON is right up your alley.  \n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Annie F."}

I think it shows a depth of skill and an understanding of the restaurant.  But I DON'T like when all of a sudden, ALL of my favorite dishes are gone!  Such was my recent experience at Limon: most of the standard Peruvian comfort foods are either spruced up in cool-kid gear (rendering them overly complicated) or relegated to side-line dish wall-flowers, where you have to really know what you're looking for in order to find them. \n\nFortunately, my very favorite sauce is still available, though now presented last on the list of side dishes: oh yeah, you know I'm talking about  the chicken breast in Adreso-Picante sauce.  Let me just tell you a little something about this sauce:\n\nThis is a sauce for which one orders extra bread for sopping up every last drop.  \nThis is the sauce over which one makes a disgusting pig of oneself.  \nThis is licking-the-bottom-of-the-bowl gooooood sauce!\nThis. Is. The. Sauce.\n\nSo, they still have the crack sauce.  That's good.  They've done away with my favorite dessert involving chocolate cake and cayenne pepper.  That's bad.  Although their new chocolate dessert does pose a strong runner up: molten chocolate cake with passion fruit mousse - delicious and decadent, good for sharing.\n\nThe wine list is great, and they boast some impressive ceviche options, but for some reason, I actually had trouble finding an entree that sounded good to me.  I ended up ordering two appetizers as a meal instead.\n\nThere are some amazing highs to be had at this restaurant, if you navigate the menu properly.  However, for the averageness of the rest of the fare, and the semi-high prices, and the hard to come by reservations,  I find I now have to give this restaurant a mid-range rating.", "author": "Ravena F."}

I have never ordered panna cotta in a restaurant before; I only made it at home.

I did enjoy the Strawberry Sorbet that accompanied it, which sorbets are usually my dessert of choice.

Apparently, my definition is wrong wrong wrong.\n\nWe had reservations for 7pm for a group of 7. At 7pm, we had all arrived and were sitting in the \"lounge\" area, chatting away and giving well-wishes to the birthday girl. We realize we've been waiting a while, and look at the clock. It's 7:36. We are still in the lounge. And there are people walking right in and being seated. If they all had reservations, the restaurant must have been backed up since 1pm with the number of people they sat in front of us. We had finally, after over 30 minutes, been offered drinks. Great. Lovely. Please, bring us drinks and then forget the birthday girl's drink. You will? Oh thank you. Just what she wanted.\n\nAt 7:50, we ask if we could just eat in the lounge. They allow us this small convenience, and we push together a few of the tiny tables and all hunker down to look at the menus. We are offered water. We say yes please to the water. Many minutes later, the waitress comes back and tells us that they're \"working on our water.\" Excuse me? What does that even mean? Where in the universe is this water coming from that it has to be worked on and we still don't receive it for another few minutes after that clever announcement? Is there only one person that can pour water? A few minutes after we receive water, we receive BREAD! Yes! We have now been at the restaurant for over an hour and we have gotten in 1 drink order, bread, and water. \n\nShortly before we receive our food almost 2 hours after our slated reservation, we are offered to sit at a table. Considering this is a staff that has to work on things such as water, we did not want to confuse them as we were hungry and close to having this birthday party Donner party style. So, we suffered at the cramped tables. I have back problems. Thank you, Limon, for adding on to my chiropractic bills.\n\nThe sangria was delicious. The chicken was tasty, but chicken all the same. And, the truffle-infused macaroni and cheese was divine. Not technically divine.

I had really high hopes for it, but I guess I'm just a spoiled bitchy birthday princess who thinks reservations count for something. I'm just silly like that.\n\nGot a reservation for 7 people at 7 p.m. on a Sunday. Sure, 7 is a weird number for a party, likely to require a specific seating arrangement that may require 2 tables near each other to vacate simultaneously so we could accommodate everyone. WHICH IS WHY WE MADE A RESERVATION. I feel like we did our part to make this arrangement work.\n\nWe arrived a bit early and waited in the lounge for the rest of the party. Now, when I arrive early, I have NO PROBLEM waiting for my reservation time. When the rest of my party isn't there yet, I have NO PROBLEM waiting for the rest of them before we sit down. I also have NO PROBLEM being offered a drink while I wait. Guess which of those things didn't happen? And if it had been, say, 10 minutes until we got a table, it wouldn't have been a big deal. But after 45 minutes elapsed and we hadn't even been offered beverages, it seemed like something was wrong.\n\nA party of 3 was sharing the lounge with us. They also had a 7:00 res that was being ignored. At least they got drinks. \n\nMultiple times during this wait, my friend asked the hostess and the manager on the floor when our table was going to be available. \"Soon! Someone's leaving right about now!\" Which means \"if we tell you something, you'll eventually shut up.\" \n\nFINALLY the extremely green server came by (no apology for ignoring us) to get our drink orders. We were finally offered drinks as we waited. After being there for 45 minutes. On my goddamn birthday. And the server FORGOT MY DRINK. ON MY GODDAMN BIRTHDAY.\n\nIt's 8:00 by now. We pulled the manager over and he gave some windy excuse about \"well, there were *people* who showed up without, you know, reservations *on the actual books* and they *had to be* accommodated.\" So because we are the mere hoi polloi with one of those lowly \"on the books\" reservations, we don't get a table. OK then, we're eating in the lounge. They obliged: brought us dinner menus in the lounge, shoved all the little tables together, and we ate there.\n\nWe got water at 8:10 p.m. *fucking tap water* took 70 minutes to get to us. Perhaps they were waiting for the iceberg to melt.\n\nWe got our entrees at 8:50. I balanced by plate on my lap. On my - that's right - goddamn birthday.\n\nHow was the food? Completely delicious. Ceviche, octopus, porkchop - all great though a bit too salty. Which wouldn't have been a problem if my water glass had been refilled. My dining companions loved their snapper, chicken and mac & cheese. So yeah, the food's tasty.\n\nThe manager brought us two tiny desserts in a lame attempt to make amends. Wow, asshole, thanks for the cakes that I can't even eat. Thanks for 2 fucking desserts for 7 pissed-off people. Can I shove those up your tight ass? No? Then I'm sending your pitiful gesture back.\n\nWe had to ask for our bill 3 times. During this time, we thought quite seriously about a dine & dash. They don't want to take our orders, and it doesn't appear like they want us to pay, either. It was $300 for 7 people. They forgot to put a couple of our drinks on our bill, but that was an oversight and not a comp. Thanks, fuckers.\n\nThis is the only time in my life I haven't tipped waitstaff.

Although, Groupons such as mine were expiring in a day, so that could have accounted for the ridiculously huge brunch crowd. \n\nAnyhow, I had a reservation for 2, but my friend was going to be late and likely not going to eat. So I told the two girls at the front that it was just me. I got the usual \"Please tell us when your whole party is here and we can seat you.\" Well, it might just be me and even if my friend shows up, I'm the only one eating. \"We cannot seat you until your whole party is here.\" Well, what if I change the reservation to one person?\n\nWow, it was like a deer caught in headlights. The hostesses seemed absolutely dumbfounded. Party of one? Does that exist? There was a long period of silence. Finally, one of them came out of her stupor and said she could seat me. \n\nSo after that, everything went smoothly. I've eaten here before, but for dinner. I've never ordered the hot plates like Lomo Saltado. Soggy french fries with a beef stir fry is just not my thing. I didn't even eat it when I was actually in Peru. No, I'm all about the ceviche. But I knew it wouldn't be very filling, so I ordered the causa and veggie empanada as well. \n\nThe ceviche mixto was a fresh mix of fish, calamari, and shrimp. The causa was filled with a chicken salad that was a bit chewy. I prefer the traditional causa filled with tuna or crab. The empanada was filled with butternut squash, zucchini, corn and carrots. The rocoto dipping sauce was tasty, the empanada itself was a bit salty.\n\nMy friend eventually showed up, so the couple seated next to me finally stopped staring at me. Yes, I am enjoying a meal by myself!! Is there something wrong with that?\n\nSo 3 stars: they don't have a full liquor license so no pisco sours. How can you have Peruvian without  a Pisco?

Twenty people is a lot of people to seat at a single table.\n\nI feel Limon has more to offer in their ceviches and apps than they do their entrees. I had their Limon shooter which was awesome. A lot of fresh seafood and you can taste every component of it.

The stuffed calamari I passed on to let the other guests at my table get full on while I did damage to the parihuela.\n\nFor entrees, sitting at a table of 8 you would think there would be a mix of selections but it turns out I had the only different dish from the others. I ordered the lomo saltado and everyone else had the grilled ribeye. The ribeye was cooked perfectly but it is what it is. A grilled ribeye. The lomo saltado was amazing.

That is, this place would get negative stars for the service and management, but the food was excellent and that brings it up to one star.\n\nOur birthday party/evening was seriously affected by the wait staff management here.  Our 7pm reservation for 7 people was ignored, apparently the hostess just kept seating people in front of us and \"forgot\"?  At 7:45 I asked what the situation looked like and she said that she was waiting for tables to turn over.  I asked her, \"multiple tables\"?  Apparently she hadn't even started the process of allocating two tables to be put together, but was still giving priority to other folks.\n\nAt 8pm, they offered to serve us in the waiting area. At 8:50pm our food finally arrived, in the waiting area.  By this point, the rest of the restaurant had largely emptied out, so you would expect that the service would get a little better.  As our dinner was being served, and the restaurant was largely empty, they offered to move us to a regular table.  At this point, given the delays in service, lost drink orders, lack of refills on things as simple as water, we respectfully declined, because we didn't want anything more to confuse them.\n\nOur group ordered the whole fish, which was very good - 8/10.\nThe pork dish was very good - 8/10. The chicken dish--the chicken was unimpressive, the peppers were great. The mac and cheese that was served with the chicken dish was a 12 out of 10.  Absolutely fantastic and to die for.\n\nYou would think that with the reservation screw up they would pay attention to making the rest of the experience good, but follow on service was absent, food was slow to arrive, drink service was nearly absent.\n\nI have no idea how so many incompetent service experiences could happen at the same time.  Mistakes happen in the business, and how someone reacts to those mistakes is the kind of thing that builds customer loyalty.  In this case, the management's response was slow, poor, and did absolutely nothing to repair our faith in this establishment.\n\nAt the end, the manager offered us *two* cake based deserts for the seven people in our party -- which was amusing in itself, since two of our party, including the birthday girl, specifically asked which items on the menu were gluten free.\n\nI have never been so disappointed with the service and callous inattention at a restaurant.  The kitchen is excellent, but the management of this restaurant should be terminated with extreme prejudice.  We will not return despite the heavenly mac and cheese.\n\nReading other yelp reviews, clearly this restaurant has a history of ignoring or screwing up reservations.

I had it last time at a different Limon (on valencia) and the sauce was really tart, but it was good this time.\nthe chicken: Moist tender juicy chicken cut 8 ways to split with my three friends and I. It's great for sharing as a first or a main course, and it doesn't hurt that it comes with two sides already.\nTacutacu: I personally like their rice dish mixed with vegetables, but some people may think it's kind of soggy or mushy. In my opinion it has great flavors that complement the chicken (but what do I know i'm a chinese guy in a peruvian restaurant)\nSweet potato fries: nothing to write home about, they're pretty standard fare. Only regret is they don't really offer ketchup for this, but the chicken does come with three sauces on the side (again- see remark above)\nWe also had this disk with steak and fries, and it kind of reminded me of a poutine. It was really saucy, given that it was steak on a bed of fries and bell peppers and onions. Although I was at first wary, it turned out to be a great dish, and was my favorite that day.\nWe also splurged and had the dessert- the panna cotta and the chocolate lava cake.

While I enjoyed the food we had, as well as the wine we selected, I'm not sure that the Mission needs two Limon Rotisseries, since the original is still on S. Van Ness.  I do miss the finer dining attributes that the original Limon offered.  But I guess the down economy has forced many places to reformat to survive.\n\nMy only gripe with the experience this past week was that there were 3 items that were offered on the menu that were not actually available.  I wouldn't normally comment on this, but when it comes to 3, including a dish that the server had talked up, then it does tend to dampen the experience.  Two were actually wines: we had ordered one of the malbecs only for the server to come back and tell us they were out of that one.  Back down to the cellar he went for our second malbec choosing, and when he returned we noted (not him, but us) that it was not the same vintage as listed on the menu.  Generally not a good thing for wine since each year brings a very different experience.  As it turned out, the one we had was pretty good.  And lastly, the server talked up a dish, so we ordered it; he came back to tell us they had sold out.  This last one is probably the most frustrating as the kitchen and the floor staff should communicate better on such things.  We survived, but it's just not a great experience and that's what going out to eat is all about - the experience.\n\nI'd definitely go back, although the original Limon Rotisserie is closer to me so I'll likely go to that one.  \n\nI'm giving them the benefit of the doubt on my stars.

I arrive with my friend 5 minutes after 7 and we are the last to arrive in our party. Our party is seated in the lounge area and we are waiting and chatting and really having a good time of it.I was not keeping track at the time though it seemed like 30 or 40 minutes after we arrived that they ask if we would like drinks. I order the soju sour -- it is tasty. \n\nThis is when I start noticing the time. About an hour after our reservations, the manager comes out and says that some folks had to be seated. We ask to be served food and they let us sit at the kiddie table to order food. We order food and plead for water. About 5 minutes later, a woman comes and explains that they are \"working on water\" for us. Five minutes after that we get water. The place is packed and I can understand being strained on staff. 70 minutes between arrival and water is absurd. We see the waitress one more time before our food arrives so she can take another drink order which I decline though others get wine and sangria.\n\nAt 8:50, 50 full minutes after ordering our food, it finally arrives. At this point, the place is mostly empty so you would think the help staff would be more attentive. No, the manager is in the back talking to what appears to be one of the cooks as they chat near the entrance to the kitchen.\n\nEveryone dives into their food. All conversation stopped for at least 10 minutes as the hungriest people in that venue begin to gorge. I had the chicken and peppers with mac & cheese while my friend had the snapper. We shared. The snapper was ok though the dipping sauce was excellent. The pepper/mushroom mix with the chicken was very good. The chicken was tasty though nothing special. It tasted like chicken. The mac and cheese was excellent.\n\nWe start enjoying ourselves at this point since our minds have been taken off of the hunger pangs. We are all laughing and having a good time.

Seriously, we just stood their and traded barbed stares with her before she relented and seated us.  \n\nWhy such forgiveness? Because two dishes were out of this world.\n\nOne, the truffle mac and cheese. Just phenomenal. I have had lots of mac and cheese but this was incredible. You really could lightly taste the truffle oil, and the mix of flavors perfectly balanced and just absolutely incredible. It was the most perfect bowl of mac and cheese I have ever had. Just perfectly amazing. If you don't like this, then you don't like food. \n\nThe next dish? Limito saltado. My.....dear......god. This was probably one of the best brunch dishes I have ever had. It just makes me skirm a little thinking about it and I just want more. It is two over easy eggs over steak, French fries, onions, and covered in some soy sauce. I know that sounds good, but it really doesn't do it justice about how good it is. The steak is perfectly seasoned and cooked for this dish and the flavor of it and the sauce is just phenomenally delicious. And then mix in the egg with a the onions and GAH! Just mouthwatering! The flavor of all theses just mix in such an overpowering delicious way that I really didn't want each bite to end, never mind the actual meal. It was just amazing. Simply outstanding and phenomenal.

Total 180 degrees.\n\nI have to give kudos to Limon SF's Twitter team (handled by Laurina) who reached out to me on Twitter after I gave them a less than stellar review on Yelp. She wanted me to give Limon a second chance, and offered me a gift certificate to do so. There's not very many restuaurants that take the time to try and win over a dissatisfied customer, but Limon SF did.\n\nOn our second visit, we had a different waiter, and I decided to order different dishes in order to give the restaurant a fresh chance. \n\nThis time when I asked to start off with the sweet potato fries, they arrived before our main dishes as I had asked. I ordered the Limon Shooter (which was basically a sampler of the ceviche) along with a side of coconut fried rice, and the Pollo Merengue.\n\nWOW. Incredible. The ceviche was especially delicious, probably the best ceviche I've had in the city (and I've had a lot of ceviche). My boyfriend ordered the Quinotto de Vegetales (basically a Vegetable Quinot), which was pretty darn perfect I must admit.\n\nNow, what did we order the first time around? I ordered the Lomo Saltado and he ordered the Veggie omelette. I was disappointed with their Lomo, but was told upon our second visit that they had heard me loud and clear: the lomo wasn't juicy enough and they had made it juicier. I'm impressed they even cared to be honest. His veggie omelette, while good, wasn't great.\n\nSo, my suggestion: stick to the cevhiche (incredible), and their other dishes. Give their lomo saltado a shot (apparently, they're improved it), but don't go for the omelette dishes.\n\nUltimately, though, my second visit to the restaurant was the total opposite of my first visit. I recommend the restaurant...just don't go with the omelettes. It doesn't accurately reflect the kind of delicious dishes the reastaurant is capable of.", "author": "Cristian G."}

The service was efficient, friendly, and the food was authentic Peruvian cuisine.\n\nThis past November, I decided to take my husband there for his birthday. We had a group of about 12, and I made a reservation weeks in advance. I was assured a few times on the phone that I would get an upstairs table, with enough room to sit 12 guests comfortably. \n\nWe got there, and some of our party was waiting at the bar already.\nI was told by the underage hostess that it would be about 20 minutes. I was annoyed but could deal with that and stall. Another 20 minutes pass and I track down the restaurant manager, who looks like Chef Gordon Ramsey from \"Hell's Kitchen\". He confesses they screwed up our reservation and double-booked. Now I'm beyond upset, and trying to remain calm in front of guests. Apparently they forgot they were dealing with a New Yorker, not some hipster from the Mission.\n\nAnd what did I get for getting screwed over? A round of free sangrias.\nThanks management -- for the cheap \"shut up\" mocktails. \n\nWe were eventually seated, ended up getting an efficient waitress, so at least that wasn't another slap in the face.

We shared the Truffle Mac 'N Cheese and ceviche for our appetizer--I don't know much about ceviche so it's hard to judge, but I do know it tasted fresh.  The Mac 'N Cheese was incredible- white cheese is better than orange cheese.  The Lomo Saltado was delicious--I asked for the meat medium well, but it was still very tender.  My friends were very pleased with their dishes as well (rib eye, paella, fish).  For dessert, we had the Mango Pana Cotta; we didn't leave anything left over\n\nThe service: Our sangria and water were always full.  Our full party was 20 minutes late and they had our table waiting and saved for us (which was super nice).  They wiped down our table & always brought us new silverware for each course.  One friend had leftovers and they boxed it for her and brought it at the end of the meal (so that it didn't get in the way).  Extremely nice and attentive service.\n\nThe ambiance: Very clean, great decor, and a cute upstairs seating as well.  Even the bathroom was pretty and smelled good!\n\nLocation: Close to BART & Muni & parking isn't too bad, either.\n\nFor everything we ordered (and we ordered quite a bit), it was less than $50 for four of us.

This thing hit a grand slam in my book and was a large reason why I wavered between a 4.5 and 5 stars. If foods could be juiced, I'd get the feds to check if they are sneaking a fast one by us. The chicken actually compares well to Zuni's roast chicken. The Mac N Cheese was probably the best I've had in my life. The slight stinkiness of the cheese complements the buttery cheese over soft tender macaroni.\n\nSo the juiced chicken and mac n cheese hit a home run, why not 5 stars? Let's start with the sangria. The Sangria tasted heavily watered down and was served with ice. Not sure what the rationale is, but it's poor form to serve wine or cocktails with ice and the same is true of sangria. The ice watered the drink down substantially.\n\nThe ahi tuna appetizer was very uninspired and too salty. Generally, the ahi tuna tartare trend is a good one or two years beyond it's prime. In consulting this is called a cash cow.\n\nThe Ceviche de Martini was excellent. It was a well balanced ceviche that innovates by adding a creamy yellowish sauce to counterbalance the sharp sour of a ceviche. \n\nOther good dishes include their interpretation of a paella (risotto with prawns) and a fried fish with curry.\n\nGreat place to celebrate something special, and certainly a place worth celebrating.", "author": "Andrew H."}

What I like about this place is that everything was pretty simple and they didn't seem like they were trying to over do anything.  Also had a couple cocktails which were also pretty good.

A dear friend brought me to this restaurant after I started complaining of hunger pangs while simultaneously verbalizing my NEED for a pisco sour.  I was more than pleased. I'm in town visiting, and come from a place where Peruvian fare is not easily available, so I jumped at the chance to come here.\n\nHere's a list of all the things we ordered- there were 6 of us and we finished every.single.plate...I may have even scooped up some sauce with my fingers...maybe:\n\nDrinks:  \n2 Mojito Limons\n2 Strawberry Sours (I swear, a frothy little bit of love)\n1 Mango Mojito (a friend asked for it to be made not too sweet, which    was great because it seemed as if all the natural flavors were enhanced rather than just being overpowered with juice)\n1 Stella\n\nApps/Entrees:\n\nWe decided to share a whole bunch of appetizers and 2 entrees.\n\nCeviche Limon- mixed seafood, and so, so fresh!\n\nTiradito de Atun-ahi tuna ceviche\n\n\nEmpanadas de Carne-  delicious, with the perfect flaky crust to meat ratio\n\nMac and Cheese- oh dear God- amazing...but only if you like truffle sauce\n\nPulpo- octopus with mashed potatoes- sounds strange, but delicious and chewy- they give you whole octopus (mini ones), so it's not for the faint of heart.\n\nPaella- unfortunately, I didn't have this, but I was assured that it was spicy, saucy, piping hot with lots of succulent seafood.  This is also one of the restaurant's more popular dishes\n\nPollo Latino-  I feel like you can't come to a Peruvian restaurant without having peruvian chicken- it was delicious.  The chicken was juicy with a crispy, papery skin.  It came with mushroom mashed potatoes, broccoli, some spicy sauce, and some red wine sauce.  ah.\n\nThe service was fine- nothing really special there.  Our dishes came out on time, our waiter was fine- maybe a little harried, but nothing out of the ordinary.  It's also not as expensive as I thought it would be.  All together, the bill came out to about $170- which wasn't bad considering we ordered the entire menu.  \n\nIt's well worth a trip back here.", "author": "Danielle S."}

After reading reviews about the crowds, I called ahead to make sure there would be no wait. We arrived at the restaurant and as promised by the hostess on the phone, we were promptly seated. The service was great, recommendations were given, change of plates and utensils after the ceviche, never empty water glasses, and a waitress who always walked by to make sure everything was okay! \n\nAmongst us we shared: \n\nCeviche Limon: Nom. Nom. Nom. I could eat this all day. Each individual flavor of the fish, the shrimp, and the calamari really shined through with the help of the acid. Definitely an appetite opener, it made me want more and more. \n\nLomo Saltado: I'm a little torn about the Lomo Saltado here. It was good, but just not as flavorful as the one I had before at Fresca. \n\nPescado Limon: Served on a bed of potatoes and spinach, the red snapper was outstanding. It was flakey and delicious. Is it wrong that I liked the spinach a little more than the snapper though? \n\nChicharron de Pollo: This crispy chicken could have been really bad without the sauce on the side, as it was a bit dry. But the tangy sauce saved the dish and had me going back for more. \n\nTruffle Infused Mac and Cheese: I don't think there could ever be anything wrong with mac and cheese. This one was creamy and delicious. Nothing too overpowering, it was just the right flavor and texture. \n\nOverall, it was a delicious and fun lunch with my girls. And not hard on the wallet either.

I don't know if it's the sangria-hangover talking, but I am in love with her.  We ordered the Causa de Pollo, Mariscos, Pollo Latino, Pargo Rojo, a side of Truffled Mac'n Cheese, and a carafe of sangria.\n\nLet's do business right and start off w/ the sangria, which was one of the best I've had.  My friends will tell you that I'm a big sangria girl, and I loved that even after we polished off our carafe, the bartender came around and refilled our glasses.  (Did I mention that I love her?)\n\nThe food was all pretty good, but I think we were both more taken by the sauces in every dish than the actual food itself.  The chicken was incredibly salty though (even to my bf, whose diet consists of about 90% sodium and 10% fat), and we had to send it back.  That was the first time I ever sent back a dish (peasant girl becomes a member of bourgeois?), since I was raised by strictly traditional Asian parents to never complain about food or waste it.  That might explain why I was such a chubster as a child.\n\nFinished the dinner w/ the Bandido, a molten chocolate cake w/ vanilla ice cream, which I can't objectively critique since by then I was in a very happy place from the sangria.

It was my first experience at a Peruvian restaurant so instead of ordering a single entree, I went for a combination of a couple appetizers and side dishes (that's my excuse for ordering in excess, and I'm sticking to it)....\n\nSangria is delicious, half a carafe gives you about 1.5 glasses for 2 people.\n\nLimon cebiche; very fresh, simple, delicious taste.  I'm going to go ahead and assume many of the other cebiche dishes are equally fresh and tasty.\n\nCrispy yucca & chimi churri: I admittedly didn't know what yucca even was before this (a root?) and oh my goodness...I need to learn how to prepare this at home!\n\nPollo al Meringue (braised sliced chicken breast in adreso-picante sauce): Simple preparation of chicken, the sauce is what makes it great.\n\nTruffled mac n cheese: A grown up twist on a childhood favorite. Yum.\n\nSweet potato fries: I honestly don't know why more restaurants don't serve this version of fries...they make typical french fries seem so boring and flavorless! Sweet potato fries at Limon give ketchup the finger...no condiments needed.\n\nThe best part of the meal is when I *thought* I was flagging down a waiter to ask for more bread and it turned out to be Emmanuel Piquera, one of the head chefs!  He was insanely kind and friendly, bringing out a complimentary dish of lobster cebiche that wasn't on the menu for us to sample.

Both were amazing.  Everything in the ceviche tasted amazingly fresh, and the marinade gave it an amazing flavor.  Ditto for the empanadas.  The beef was flavorful and tender, and the pastry had the perfect texture.\n\nInitially, we'd chosen a bottle of muscat to go pair with our ceviche, but the waiter returned with a sample of a different wine (not one I'd hear of before, but sounded Spanish and started with an A) that he thought might complement the ceviche better.  We tasted it and were impressed enough to order a bottle; it went with the ceviche perfectly.\n\nFor dinner, I got the Lomo Saltado (wok-tossed sirloin fingers with onion, tomato, soy sauce, and topped with French fries).  The texture of the beef was perfect and went really well with the onions & tomatos (I discarded the French fries, because they seemed pretty ordinarily & probably just garnish).  A bit salty because of the soy sauce, but then again, soy sauce.  Still really tasty.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Pollo Latino (baked chicken breast, stuffed red peppers, and truffle infused mac & cheese).  We both agreed that the chicken was perfectly cooked and amazingly flavorful.  His only complaint was that the truffle flavor in the mac & cheese was a little too subtle.\n\nFor dessert, we had a delicious sweet cheese dessert topped with chocolate.  (Unfortunately I don't remember anything else about the specifics, and it isn't listed on the online menu.)  Quite tasty.\n\nAlso, let me say that the service was absolutely flawless.  As in, some of the best service I've encountered anywhere I've ever been.  Our waiter was composed, friendly, knowledgeable, and seemed to have a sixth sense about when we were ready to order or needed something.  Our wine and water glasses were never empty, and our table was bussed and silverware replaced after every course (and typically within 10-20 seconds of finishing it).  Service definitely gets 5 stars.\n\nMy only real complaint about the food was the variation in available fish.  Nearly all the fish dishes (including most of the ceviche) was partly or all red snapper, which we forwent for environmental / sustainability reasons.  (I have a sneaking suspicion that the \"fish\" in the Limon ceviche that we ended up ordering was red snapper, but we reasoned that at least there was less of it than if we'd ordered one of the others.)\n\nBravo, Limon!

There was a good vibe going, and the staff was pretty nice.  But then I found out they screwed up the reservation.  Wrong time, wrong amount of people.  Not a huge deal, b/c they just fixed it.  By fixing it, it's just crossing out the time and number, which looking back isn't fixing anything.  Reservations don't seem to mean anything here.  There were 3 groups including ours that had to wait over an hour after the reservation time.  \n\nAnyways, on to the food.  The ceviche and empanadas are money.  Must haves.  They are absolutely incredible.  A little expensive for what you get, but not outrageously so.  For entrees, we had pork chops, chicken, and a red snapper dish.  All of them were very well done and well presented.  However, the pork chops and chicken were dishes I could have easily done at home.  When I go out, it's nice to have things that I can't throw together in my own kitchen.  \n\nFor Limon, that's the ceviche and empanada, and that's about it.", "author": "Dietrich H."}

They are so generous with the ceviche and you actually get mini filets of fish.  Most places I've been to give you tiny chunks.  Not only did we get a little mound of it, it was very tasty.  Even my friend who typically doesn't like ceviche loved it for its refreshing and light flavors.  Would definitely go back for this!  And at $12, it's a steal.\n\nEmpanadas de Carne. Very tasty.  They only give you two but it is completely filled with deliciousness.  I'm not too sure what was in there except beef and some raisins but it was wonderfully seasoned and spiced.  Yum...a little more on the expensive side for just two empanadas but worth trying.\n\nYucca fries - Who doesn't love yucca fries?? Perfectly crispy topped with chimi churri. P.S.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-03-07", "description": "I have never tried Peruvian food, so upon trying Limon, I didn't really know what to expect. Although I didn't really have any expectations, I knew that Latin cuisine never fails, so somewhere in the back of my mind, I just knew Limon wouldn't fail. \n\nWe started the night with drinks. I had the mango mojito and he had the regular mojito. Although the mojitos were sweet, we quickly caught on to the lack of alcohol. We were looking for something to hit us strong, but that mojito was definitely lacking. But we brushed it off because we knew there were plenty of bars around the area that we could hit up after dinner and probably would serve harder drinks for cheaper.\n\nFor starters, we shared the Limon-cebiche which had fish, calamari and shrimp. Now that cebiche was probably the best cebiche I've ever had. (ceviche? cebiche? I don't know? I always thought it was ceviche, until I read their menu.) I don't really know much about cebiche, but I'm glad we agreed on sharing one because I thought one cebiche plate would suffice as a whole meal for me. God, no. It's probably equivalent to a salad starter or something of that sort. \n\nI also love restaurants that serve free appetizers, like bread and butter. Limon is one of those restaurants (hell yes!) They serve bread along with two different sauces. Even if this wasn't exactly a big portion of the meal, it was strangely one of my faves. I automatically fell in love with the dipping sauce that accompanied the bread. I'm not exactly sure what was in it (crack perhaps?), but we had to ask our server for seconds. Sometimes I ponder if one could just go into a restaurant and eat these free appetizers and leave? Because if that were the case, I wouldn't mind dropping by Limon just to get some of that saucy goodness.\n\nAnyway, for the main entrees, he had the Pollo Latino while I had the Quinotto de Hongos (Quinoa & Wild Mushroom Risotto, Grilled  Vegetables, Truffle Infusion). I'm the type of person who eats with their eyes first, so when my plate arrived, I couldn't help but think of dessert already because my meal looked tiny. However, when I took the first bite to my meal, I felt like I was in heaven. Although the presentation itself looked small and simple, everything about my dish was amazing! The flavors were just right and surprisingly, despite how my eyes had fooled me, I was more than satisfied and full by the end of my meal. I couldn't even make room for dessert :( But it's okay, that's what next time's for.\n\nI like almost everything about Limon, but sometimes it's hard to have a great time during dinner when you have to yell over each other amidst all the noise. It's so noisy inside Limon that we were practically yelling to each other instead of having a normal conversation. At one point we even thought about texting each other from across the table. But nonetheless, if you're looking for amazing food, Limon definitely can provide you with that.", "author": "Ally C."}

We arrived at 9:00 and the restaurant was very busy with good energy, smells, and sounds coming from throughout.  The decor is quite hip and modern, and it's extremely loud - our group of 6 had to practically yell to hear each other, and it was clear that our waiter had difficulty hearing us to take our orders.\n\nThe Trio de Ceviche was quite tasty and fresh, with really interesting sauce and fish variations.  The Pargo Rojo (red snapper) had beautiful presentation and was tasty, but felt overbattered and heavy.  The Lomo Saltado (Wok-tossed sirloin) was also really yummy, but overburdened with butter and salt.\n\nThe wine list was pretty limited, especially if you're looking for something other than Malbec.  We did find a Tempranillo/Grenache that was quite lovely.  The waiter treated the opening and tasting as an unnecessary waste of time, which I sort of agree with but I've never had a waiter do that in any restaurant.  \n\nOverall with a round of drinks, bottle of wine, appetizers and main courses, the bill came to about $50 per person, which is not bad for a hip and trendy place, but felt overpriced (especially to those at the table who had just returned from Peru where authentic Lomo Saltado was $3 per serving).

They are dangerously delicious as you don't taste any alcohol whatsoever which means you may either 1.) be drunk as a lush later in the evening 2.) broke from ordering so many! \n\nI had the lomo saltado which is a popular Peruvian dish. However, I wished that I had ordered the Curry Red Snapper with Coconut Rice as that tasted spectacular!!!!! My dish was good but small and sorta on the salty side. I was hungry even after having many samples of the appetizers which by the way were incredibly delicious as well! My personal favorites were the ceviche and the chicharon's. \n\nFor dessert, the profiteroles are the way to go. After having a rich in flavor food, the profiteroles were a refreshing treat. So light and creamy! I wished that I had more of them to eat! \n\nThis place is a great place to hang out amongst friends. It's small, so make sure you make a reservation.", "author": "stacy k."}

He replied that there was only one place, Limon.  A few weeks ago I saw a Groupon for lunch at Limon, with Paco's blessing and the great deal being offered, I couldn't turn this down.\n\nMy girlfriend and I shared the Ceviche Nikkei de Atun (ahi tuna with mushrooms and sesame seeds in soy sauce-infused leche de tigre).  We then each ordered an entree.  She ordered the Pescado Limon (snapper fillet, potatoes and spinach) and I ordered the Lomo Saltado (sirloin stir-fried with onions, tomatoes, fries and soy sauce) and some wok tossed veggies in soy sauce as a side.  For drinks we ordered the inca cola and a chicha morada (a drink made from purple corn).\n\nEverything was delicious, including the drinks.  The inca cola tasted like cream soda and the chicha morada tasted like apple crumble.  I'm sure that the veggies taste good too but we never got them.  However this was probably a good thing as we were stuffed.  The ceviche itself was pretty filling.  \n\nThe reason for 4/5 stars is down to the service.  Our waiter was nice enough but we had to remind him that we had ordered two drinks, he forgot the side (again, it wasn't a problem) and he also gave us claw crackers when there was nothing to crack.  He would have been forgiven if the place was slammed but it was lunch and there were probably only about 15 patrons in there.\n\nI will definitely be going back for dinner and can't wait to try Limon Rotisserie.", "author": "Prav P."}

We were all sadly unimpressed though.\n\nwe got the chimichurri fries, sweet potato fries, yuca frita as appetizers. they were very...simple. and small. the yuca was fried too much. it's normally pan fried so it is a little dry and cripsy so you can eat it balanced with the sauce, but it was moist and mooshie! yuck!\n\nAs for entrees we ordered the Churrsaco, paella de mariscos, chuleta de puerco, chicharron de pollo. They were actually pretty good for entrees. the paella de mariscos was very plain and was not spicy at all. rather bland. everything else was pretty mediocre. the chuleta was too salty with the dressing but the pork was dry so it kinda balanced a lil.\n\nFor refrescos we got inca kola, chicha morrada, sangria, and a mango mojito. the chicha was a lil diluted, sangria was good, but the mango mojito... it was more just plain rum filled with a lot of mint! i didn't taste any mango even tho the waitress said it had \"real mango\" in it. way too strong.\n\nOver all we were disappointed.

Small Cold Plates?  I didn't come here to read! Nevertheless, we Bros recited the menu to each other, in turn, the volume lifting where we found preference - with the proper timing, we could have had ourselves a canon, and with any talent, a fugue. When that was over, we spoke at length about our gastric capacity for chicken in a sitting. As this place specializes in roast chicken, the discussion wasn't entirely impertinent. Our gracious waiter confirmed that we should order the chicken, and recommended the Ceviche Mixto, and the Anticuchos de Res (cow hearts). Hey waiter, quick question: is this your first time suggesting items? Keep up the great work! We chose two sides with the chicken: tuca-tuca (Siri told us all about what that meant) and the yucca fries. We threaded the meal with pisco sours and negra modelos. On a weeknight! \n\nThe roast chicken, couldn't have been more roast chicken. Dis free-range? It came with an aji sauce trio that (spoiler alert) DID make it more roast chicken. The hearts were like jerky, if jerky were tender, chewy, charred and robust. The ceviche mixto, like maybe all of their ceviches, is less about the protein and mostly about that juice that accumulates at the bottom of the bowl. Heck, next time I may just order a bowl of ceviche juice. One spoon. \n\nYou should be eating here.

Limon left me with something to be desired - namely, a reservation at La Mar.   As foreshadowing to our meal at Limon, we were welcomed by a street lined by rugged construction and an unsightly trench which stretched almost the entirety of the block (not their fault, but still not worth navigating around to get to the actual food.).  Upon entering, we were \"greeted\"  by two female hostesses, both of whom get an \"F\" in friendliness and one of whom gets an \"A\" in having sleeve tattoos and orange hair whilst trying to be pretentious at a restaurant that is...well, continue reading. \n\nThe food was not memorable.  I had the \"Pollo Latino,\" which ended up being the twin sister of a Safeway rotisserie chicken that had been sitting under the lights for a little bit too long.   The peppers were interesting, the macaroni and cheese side was a little bland and served luke warm.  Perhaps the best part of the evening were the sangrias and the dipping sauce that came with the bread - pretty good.  The steak dish was over seasoned.   In a city with culinary feats on and around each block, Limon just doesn't pass muster.   If you want to navigate the traffic and construction in the Mission to get to this place, stick to the Sangrias and bread, then grab a cab and go to a real meal at La Mar or Fresca.", "author": "Nicole S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-05", "description": "For my birthday I decided to gather some friends for an epic dinner up in San Francisco.  I'd been wanting to try Lim\u00f3n for quite some time--I'd never had Peruvian food before, and was eager to check it out, plus a friend of mine had rave reviews of Lim\u00f3n's rotisserie. \n\nWe arrived for dinner (with reservations, of course, on a Saturday night) at 6:30, and we were seated promptly. The restaurant was packed, and they took our party up to the upper level. We had a nice table in the corner by the upstairs bar. The restaurant was hopping, with lots of action around the bar and tables coming and going. And as my friend Michelle noted--and then insisted I include in my review--\"the restaurant smelled wonderful.\" By the smell alone, I was salivating.\n\nWe started off with drinks. Some of my friends tried some of their specialty cocktails, giving them the thumbs up. I decided to try the Peruvian Inca style cola, chicha morada. It was an interesting drink--it's made with purple corn as the base, with a mix of sweet fruit, acidic citrus and hints of spice and cinnamon. One sip in and I was intrigued and didn't know what to think of it, but by the end, I was ready to order a second one!\n\nAfter a long day in the city, we were starving and everything on the menu looked good. We started out with four appetizers--the ceviche Lim\u00f3n, the causa de pollo, an order of veggie empanadas and the chicharrones de pollo. The ceviche was absolutely delicious--and that's saying a lot coming from me, since I'm not usually a fan of ceviches. The fish, shrimp and squid had a nice, smooth citrus flavor, with just the right amount of kick. The chicharrones were nice and crispy outside, and juicy tender inside. Oh man, I'm having inappropriate thoughts about those chicharrones right now! What I'd for an order of them right now! *sigh* The veggie empanadas were definitely one of our favorites--we liked them so much we got a second order. The outside was nice and flaky, the inside filled with spicy veggies. And I loved the accompanying salsa. The only appetizer that didn't wow us was the causa de pollo--with a cold chicken salad over the potato, it was a little bland in comparison to everything else. (But still tasty on its own.)\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the duck--a seared duck breast with spiced Brussels sprouts, crispy tacu-tacu (which I took for some sort of bean cake) and sauteed greens, topped with two fried plantain chips. When the dish arrived, it was a sight to behold--a true work of art with the plantain chips on top. The duck was cooked a little rare for my tastes, but had a nice texture. Flavor wise, I wish it had had a little more kick to it. Honestly, I think I was more impressed with the side dishes--they easily outshined the duck breast. I guess this was the risk I took ordering duck in a Peruvian restaurant--it's not exactly a Peruvian specialty.\n\nMy friends all raved about their respective dishes, which included a wok-seared hanger steak, two orders of paella and two orders of the whole roasted fish. The beef was nice and tender, or so I heard, as I didn't sample any. The paella was a nice savory mix of seafood. The whole roasted fish won the award for most entertaining--it was quite amusing as my friends worked their way through the fish, bones and all. All of the entrees got a thumbs-up. \n\nSadly, dessert was a bit of a letdown. We were pretty stuffed, so we just ordered two desserts for the table. The bandido chocolate cake got the thumbs up, with the right blend of sugar and spice. The profiteroles, however, weren't so tasty--the dough was a little dry and the filling pretty plain. The syrup--made from the Peruvian lucuma fruit--was nice. Again, I think the problem here is that profiteroles are a French, not Peruvian, dessert. It was my own fault for ordering them anyway, but I wanted to try the lucuma fruit.\n\nI have to say, I thought our service here was great. We were a big table, with six of us there for dinner. Sometimes dining in a large group can throw the waitstaff off their game, but not here. Our glasses were promptly refilled, food arrived quickly, dirty plates were cleared right away, our servers checked up on us several times throughout our meal. I have to say, sometimes I don't get service this good in restaurants when dining with just a table of two in an empty restaurant!\n\nWe had a great time at Lim\u00f3n and I'd definitely come back here next time I'm looking for dinner up in the city. Sure, parking in the Mission can be a pain in the evening, but it was well worth it for our dinner here. I'd definitely recommend coming here for dinner--special or otherwise.", "author": "Raul N."}

We were told that the manager was the only one who had a key to the windows and he/she was not there, so the windows stayed closed.

To put this review in perspective, I'm a die hard fan of local, hip, ethnic food and I'm a pretty detailed reviewer. \n\nLimon had several other large parties in addition to our party of 20 last night. The restaurant was bustling and I was a little concerned that it was too busy for them to cater to our party. I was wrong. Our waiter Donald and the manager, Enrique were fantastic. I met with Enrique a week prior to the party and he let me taste the sangria to make sure it was sweet, the way I like it. He also walked me through their restaurant, letting me select where we would sit.\n\nOur party arrived on time and then I ordered some of their sides and appetizers for the group. We also ordered several carafe's of sangria :)\n\nHere are some of my favorite dishes:\n\n-sweet potato fries (crispy and sweet but not oily or heavy)\n- side of vegetables in soy  (our group loved this. Cooked al dente in a  zesty soy glaze)\n- Ceviche (we thoroughly enjoyed the sour, sweet and slightly spicy ahi tuna, red snapper and mixed seafood ceviches. Some were authentic some were nouveau but all were amazing)\n- Red snapper with tiger prawns (awesome - great pink sauce, not too spicy)\n- Fried whole red snapper (lightly fried, awesome seasoning and the rice on the side was super tasty)\n\nOver all their menu was diverse, fresh and fulfilling. Their service was top notch and the ambiance was young, contemporary and welcoming.\n\nI highly recommend coming here if you like new takes on traditional items and do request Donald as your waiter!", "author": "vinney a."}

The sangria was excellent, perfectly matched for any food you get.

While we were waiting, they brought out bread with 2 very delicious dipping sauces. The bartender also served us up some complimentary oyster shooters which was very unique-- citrusy and full of flavor.\n\nNext they brought out our entree, which was chicken breast served with stuffed peppers and mac&cheese. The portions were surprisingly large, and the 2 of us couldn't finish the whole meal. The chicken breast was tender, but with a tasty crispy skin. The flavor was amazing and somewhat reminiscent of crispy duck. We also had a side of the Yucca fries, which I would highly recommend. They were awesome in the side sauces (that had come out w/ the bread).\n\nAfter our meal, the waitstaff made us feel like we were welcome to hang out as long as we wanted, although we saw the people waiting at the door and made sure to get on our way.

We noticed how a guy on the table next to us had to latterly get up from his table and grab a napkin from the bar because there was no server checking on them. Our server was very inattentive and kept messing up our order. I thought that maybe the food would be good enough to make up for the horrible service. Well think again! Bc the food was just as bad!! I'm not going to say this food did not taste good bc it didn't have a bad taste but there was obsoletely nothing I had that night that tasted like Peruvian food. The \"tacu tacu\" was a true disgrace to the Peruvian tacu tacu, it tasted like plain rice and beans which is not the concept of the dish. Everything else tasted just as plain, to be honest with you the only thing that was good was the canned \"Inca Cola\" soda. The server did not check on us once and I can honestly say I will never be coming back again. It's truly sad as a Peruvian young woman raised in the US to see that our food is being presented so wrongfully.

Zesty, tangy, sweet, salty, savory-- pop, pop, pop! It makes me excited just thinking about them.  \n\nNow admittedly, before my visit to Limon, I was a complete virgin to Peruvian cuisine.  In fact, my knowledge of South American cuisine as a whole stemmed from a single evening I spent at the Brazilian restaurant Churrascaria Plataforma in New York gorging myself on meat years ago.  That, and the stories Brooke G. recounted from her days in Ecuador about carbo-loading on popcorn-centric meals and the one night she arrived at the dinner table only to find that the family's pet \"cuy\" (guinea pigs) had been de-fluffed and were being roasted on a spit.\n\nTo my delight, everything I sampled from Limon's menu was deliciously intriguing and far exceeded my expectations. Each morsel of the two ceviches we ordered to start the meal (the Limon and de Camarones, in case you were wondering) was mouthwatering -- from the Peruvian corn kernels to the chewy octopus tentacle, from the sweet yam to the meaty prawn. For my main course, I ordered the Pollo Latino (yes, I pronounced it \"poll-o\" instead of \"poy-o.\" American moron in the house!) which was incredible, especially accompanied by the truffle-infused macaroni and goat cheese side dish.  Pure deliciousness.\n\nThe highlight of my Limon experience was definitely the food, though the service and atmosphere are not to be shortchanged either.

While the food was pretty tasty, I felt that the service needed to be more attentive and thoughtful, especially given the high prices for the food. Our plates came from the kitchen really (no... REALLY) quickly, but there was no consideration as to the order they were served so we ate this really spicy dish first and then followed it up with a mild tuna tartare, which really did the tuna a disservice as our spiced-up taste buds could barely detect the delicate flavor. We also wanted to stick around for awhile (like, longer than 10 minutes), enjoy our drinks and people watch-- but we felt that the staff was pushing us out so that they could turn tables more quickly.\n\nMy search for delicious ceviche continues!", "author": "Kayt D."}

I had no idea that Peruvian fare could get this rich - saffron rice with springy fresh scallops, prawn, halibut, squid, mussels and the rest.

The entrees were beautifully plated and flavorful if a bit heavy in the salt department. I had the double cut pork chop which was perfectly cooked and served on a mushroom ragout to die for. The churrasco was tasty as well as were the top sirloin pieces. The fish dish was artistically mounted.

For our entrees, 2 of us had the deep fried red snapper, which was a spectacular presentation, and tasted good.

There are only a handful of places that I'd give five stars, and Limon has been one of them since the first time I ate there.  So good and given the family story behind it, I just love sending business their way.\n\nIn case you didn't know, three brothers opened the place serving mostly mom's recipes after learning how to give good service and working their asses off in some of the nicest places in the city.  Martin received a rising star chef's award that year from Michael Bauer, an incredible accomplishment for a family restaurant!  They truly deserve their success.\n\nOn to the food.  Limon has the best ceviche I've ever had - ceviche de pescado is my favorite (just halibut) but ceviche limon is also fantastic.  Though it's not traditional Peruvian food they have a great tartare (even if it's a pretty obvious rip off from Mina's).  Lomo saltado is awesome as are the empanadas and anything with addresso sauce.  I generally  share a bunch of appetizers and the lomo saltado and the check is pretty reasonable.  Sangria is a great addition to the overall experience.  Also be sure to try the lucuma ice cream (a Peruvian fruit) - it's a real treat!\n\nIt gets loud in there, to be sure - but other than that it doesn't get much better.", "author": "Jenny S."}

We had:\n\nAppetizers-\nVieres con Foie Gras - Pan seared scallops and foie gras... - the scallops were cooked perfectly and the flavors just melted together.\nTatara de Atun - Diced sushi grade Ahi Tuna... - the tuna was very fresh and plentiful and was formed in to a patty with the rest of the ingredients with the vinaigrette and sesame oil around the edge for precision dipping.  In all it was very tasty.\n\nMain Courses-\nLomo Saltodo - Traditional Peruvian dish of Top Sirloin slices... - this was a rich and very full-flavored dish.  The beef was cooked perfectly and the mixture of onion, tomatoes and fries made for some very tasty bites.  This was my selection and I was sure it was going to be the better of the two entrees...until I tasted\nPargo Rojo - Crispy whole red snapper basket... - wow, what a great dish.  Everything about it was stimulating from the presentation to the incredible range of flavors.  Individually the fish, curry sauce or coconut rice probably would have been the highlight of whatever they were with but together they were delectable.\n\nDessert-\nThree scoops of ice cream - Lucuma, Chiramoya and Red Beet - all very interesting flavors.\n\nAll in all the dining experience was excellent.  The place was fun and alive but not too noisy and the service was very good (I was glad to not see the bitch blonde hostess - an encounter with her while trying to walk in one night is what kept me away from the new place for so long).

I really hoped that we would be seated on the second level, but I was brought to probably the worst table in the house.  It was the table right at the foot of the steps, which is also right outside of the bathrooms, and closest to the serving station.  There was way too much commotion in that area for one to thoroughly enjoy their meal.  After much contemplation (I hate causing trouble), I asked the server if we could be seated somewhere else, and they obliged without any questions.  And as I had hoped, we were moved to a nice table on the second level balcony area (woohoo, never hurts to ask)!\n\nWe ordered the Ceviche Limon, Empanada Don Walter, Calamares Fritos, Lomo Saltado, and a side of truffle-infused mac & cheese.  We thought all of the appetizers were great, but Limon's ceviche is truly above and beyond any I'd ever had.  It had the perfect amount of acidity, not too sour, not too bland.  And the seafood was extremely fresh.  After taking one bite, I wished I had ordered the ceviche trio so that I could try as many as I could.  The Lomo Saltado was tasty, but I thought the mac & cheese side was even better.  We finished the meal off with their tres leches dessert, which I highly recommend, not only because the cake is good, but the tiny bite-sized macaroons that come with the dessert are AMAZING!!

In the entree world, the Lomo Saltodo (Top Sirloin steak with onions and fried potatoes) takes top honors, with several mentions of the Pargo Rojo (crispy whole Red Snapper), and the Pollo Latino.\n\nIn the beverage category, Sangria is raved about over and over (and over), but the wine list also gets high marks, with good selections from Chile, Argentina, and Spain, both by the glass and by the bottle.

From the moment I walked in and one of their friendly staff who was off his shift and on his way home gave us a warm and friendly \"hello, enjoy your dinner\", I was impressed.  The impression continued throughout our meal from the decor inside to dessert.\n\nOur waiter was more than competent.  He actually took the time to explain the different appetizers and entrees and made his suggestions without being pushy.  They were really attentive with coming over to refill your water and taking the empty plates away.\n\nWe ended up getting a ceviche and the ribs for the appetizer, then got the red snapper for the entree and the warm flourless chocolate cake for dessert.

What I must complain about was the service. The hostess was a complete b*tch...we told her that we were waiting for 2 of our party of 6 and asked if we could sit down (we had a reservation). She sat us down. Then she came by and demanded very rudely: \"where is your party?  You can't sit here without your whole party.\"  We were like, we told you, they will be here in 2 minutes.  She walked away but glared at us until our friends came.  \n\nThen the waiters...we ordered a lot of appetizers and main dishes to share tapas-style.  I was eating off my small plate, literally I had the fork on the food on the plate and the waiter moved it so that he could put down a dish!  That really pissed me off. I have never had that happen at a restaurant.  \n\nThen later another waiter decided it was time to clean the table and began removing dishes, even though there was food on them and several people were obviously still eating!  He picked up a plate of shrimp ceviche that had shrimp left, I had to grab it out of his hand.  We felt like they were trying to rush us out.", "author": "Rebecca B."}

We had 7 people in our group and ordered 4 ceviches, which was just about the right amount as far as appetizers go.  For dinner, I had the pork chop, which was delicious. It was well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Definitely a highlight.  We did try the mac and cheese, which had been recommended by several people.  It, like the ceviche wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it either.  \n\nService: 2 stars\n\nWe had a group of 7 coming in for an 8:00 reservation, which I had made on Monday.  We arrived at 8:00, but didn't get seated until 9:30.  Look, I understand that you won't always be seated right at your reservation time, but 90 minutes is a joke. To make matters worse, Limon has very limited bar space, so there isn't a lot of \"overflow\" room for those parties who are waiting for a table.  We basically stood by the hostess' desk the entire time.  I felt bad for the hostess, who was polite, because there wasn't much she could do (other than offer us wine or an appetizer for our patience, which she didn't do). \n\nOnce we were seated, service was fine.  No complaints.  The long wait left a bad taste in my mouth, though.  I would definitely NOT recommend Limon for a group, unless you're coming early in the evening or at off times.

My favorite was the ceviche limon, although there was no clear loser among the limon and the other two (ceviche de pescado and choros a la chalaca.)  I ordered the Parihuela ( Peruvian Bouillabaise), a pot of fresh seafood but no starch, hence the boillabaise comparison  I also tasted some of the Seco de Costilla; it was a much heavier dish, but also quite quite a good one.

The waiters were very attentive.  We got lucky because without reservations on a Thursday night at prime dinner time 730ish we were seated immediately- i had been prepared to go somewhere else since there is usually a wait, but this was a pleasant surprise.  We were put at the table closest to the open kitchen area- which at first I was worried about, but turned out not to be a problem at all.  \n\nIt didn't seem that loud which surprised me being so close to the kitchen and to a large party and the table next to ours.  I was able to hear and didn't have to talk above a normal level to be heard.  This is def different from several other places i've been as of late in the mission.  Also the ambiance is very nice- soft lighting, warm dark wood interior- very pleasant.\n\nWe decided not to get any starters since neither of us were especially starving.  They did have a pretty extensive wine list to get through, but i settled on a glass of sauv blanc which was just what i was looking for.  They brought us nice bread and then a little shot of sweet potato cheese soup which was very yummy. \n\nI got the pollo latino that came with some of the truffle mac and cheese as well as some broccoli.  Now I am absolutely not a expert on Peruvian food- i've never been to Peru and this is probably the only restaurant that claims to be peruvian that i've been to, but it was good.   My chicken was extremely moist , flavorful and in a very well sized portion.  The mac and cheese was delicious.  The presentation was well done as well.  \n\nI will have to come back to try out the ceviche and desserts.  Overall a very pleasant dining experience.", "author": "Maria F."}

From the ceviches (all very tasty and not too acidic - tuna was VERY GOOD), to the apps (chicken skewers were ok, but the ribs, empanadas and tuna were the favorites), and finally the entrees (too many to list but I had the pescado picante - fish was just right with a nice rich sauce, but the rice terrine although good was a little on the dry side).

With the promise that I'm just a normal person like you, I feel compelled to say that Limon was genuinely one of the worst dining experiences of my life.  The story goes something like this.\n\nI had a lunch date with a girlfriend.  We wanted to drink.  Groupon was selling a Limon deal for half off a $40 lunch or brunch.  Why not?  Groupons are perfect for getting your actual money's worth at overpriced Mission psuedo-ethnic yuppie restaurants.  I bought the Groupon (this was the only redeeming quality of the whole experience), made a reservation as per its request (but seriously, have you ever made a reservation for a weekday lunch in your entire life?), and trotted off to 16th and Valencia.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, there was a line maybe 6 people long, about half of whom had also made reservations, a hostile hostess, and a packed dining room.  Are you kidding me?  Is this the power Groupon has in this town?  The hostess told us we could wait in line or at the bar.  She made no effort to distinguish between the patrons who had made reservations and those who hadn't.  We watched a six-top sit empty for thirty minutes before anyone thought to separate the tables and actually seat people.  Finally, after waiting forty minutes (WITH A RESERVATION), she seated us.  No apology, no consolation prizes, nothing.\n\nMaking the best of it, we ordered some Bloody Marys and food.  I believe the order of items we were given went like this: ceviche (hers), Bloody Marys (both of us), truffle mac-and-cheese (hers), chicharron de pollo (mine), chimichurri fries (mine), all separated by about ten minutes between dishes.  After being informed that the restaurant didn't have ketchup (seriously?), the server failed to even bring me the salt or any form of dipping sauce that I'd politely requested.  \n\nI feel bad punishing the servers in this review, because as a former service industry professional, I know that management does shit like selling a Groupon without telling the staff all the time, but the service was pathetic.  If the food had been great, I might have reconsidered this review, but it was mediocre at best--the chicken was dry, the supposed chimichurri fries were just soggy, lukewarm fries with Italian seasoning dumped on them.  The Bloody Marys were good, at least, but the food portions were so small that I was wasted one one drink by the time we left.  \n\nThe only good part of the meal was getting the bill for four dollars at the end--thanks, Groupon (and also, fuck you).  I will never go back to Limon.", "author": "Laura G."}

I will not receive a free ceviche punch card for writing this, although perhaps I should call them and check if I might. Hold on one second. I'll call them. Hold on. \n\nWell. Absolutamente nada gratis. Pero gracias, pana, por el review. \n\nI eat at Limon once a week. I am from Ecuador, and since there's no Ecuadorian restaurants in San Francisco, Peruvian food is the closest to home food, although my mother never cooked us ceviche at home, so perhaps I mean home as in Guayaquil. \n\nThe drinking rituals of my all-male Catholic high school always culminated with ceviche the next morning. It was supposed to soak up the alcohol, and since I was not one to say no to rituals, for four years I sampled all types of ceviches, in all types of establishments, reputable and not so much.\n\nIt occurs to me as I write this that perhaps I am not the most reliable reviewer. I was, after all, always hangover when I had ceviches back in Ecuador. I guess my reliability depends on whether you believe booze impairs the palate.\n\nIn any case. You know how the facile narrative structure of this review ends. \n\nSomething like: \"even though I have tried all types of etc. etc., the ceviche Limon is among the best.\" \n\nTry the ceviche sampler, the empanadas, the picante the mariscos, los choros a la chalaca, and ask them to reinstate the Causa de Mariscos.\n \nAnd unlike Fresca, that center of seafood scrimp, their portions are not tiny.", "author": "Mauro C."}

Some baby carrot sticks, not good... it was cooked, but crunchy in an uncooked sort of way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-08-04", "description": "My best friend and I have been to Limon numerous times, and every time, it's been delicious food and good service.\n\nOur last visit, however, at around 6:30 p.m. on a Tuesday, completely wiped that slate clean. We will NEVER go back.\n\nWhen we walked in, the place was empty, save for a few tables with some people having after-work drinks. The hostess was at the back of the restaurant, talking with other staff. Eventually, she came over, didn't even say \"hello,\" and just waited us for to say something. We were then seated.\n\nWe already knew what we wanted, which was the vegetarian ceviche. When we looked on the menu, however, it wasn't there, so we asked the same hostess, who seemed to also be our server, whether they still served it. Immediately, she said, \"No.\" No explanation (we were clearly there to eat dinner and were starving). She pointed to this beet salad on the menu, said, \"There's this.\" Since the vegetarian ceviche doesn't really call for any rare ingredients, we asked if she could find out if the kitchen could still make it. \"Fine, I'll find out.\" [For the record, the vegetarian ceviche is why we came here.] \n\nShe comes back, and tells us they can make it. She then walks away. We were wondering where the bread and dips they usually serve before their meals were, so after five or so minutes, I asked her. She said they don't have bread anymore. Then walked away.\n\nWithin two minutes, our \"ceviche\" was ready. Somehow, the server manages to put one plate down on our table, while spilling the leche de tigre from the other plate all over the floor AND MY FRIEND'S SHOES. The server looks down, puts the now half-empty plate down in front of me, AND WALKS AWAY.\n\nNo apology, no nothing. A busboy comes to wipe the mess off the floor and the server hands my friend a napkin. We were seriously in shock. THEN, the server has the nerve to say, in the most degrading tone, \"I'll buy you new shoes if you want,\" and walks away. I don't know where she keeps walking off to, but, remember, there's hardly anyone else in the restaurant!\n\nTo top it all off, we look down at our food, and it is horrible. They put three large chunks of tomatoes, a few pieces of corn, and one stalk of broccoli on the plate. What their ceviche used to be was these finely sliced vegetables, layer upon layer. I don't know what this shit was, and I don't even want to know how much they were going to charge us for these \"off-menu\" plates.\n\nWe got up to leave, and the server, who still hasn't even uttered the word sorry for ruining my friend's suede shoes, says \"It was an honest mistake.\" Bullshit. If you can't manage to carry two plates without spilling them on your customers, maybe you're not cut out to be a waitress. And if you don't even have the decency to apologize when that does happen, whether it was a mistake or not, maybe you're not cut out to interact with other human beings.\n\nSadly, we're not the only ones who have had such a bad experience with the service recently. When I was reading Cyndy L.'s review of 7/30/2010, I was nodding my head in agreement the whole way through.", "author": "unnati g."}

We ordered the Ceviche Limon with mixed seafood which was good, but I could have done without the octopus and the corn that accompanied.  The roasted corn was slightly gritty, and the steamed corn was pretty tasteless.  We also ordered the tuna tartar, which I really enjoyed because it was spicy and the quality of the tuna was good.  They could work on the presentation, however because it came out looking very similar to a raw hamburger patty.  Finally, we finished off our meal with the Arroz con Mariscos, which was similar to paella and very tasty.  \n\nHowever, one thing I didn't really like was the sangria.

My buddy Eric called me up 25 minutes prior to my stop at the lovely 16th & Mission BART (or \"the\" BART) station and said, \"hey - the Michelin Guide wrote this rave review about Limon, and we must go.  Be there @ 8\".\n\nI show up on time as usual, and wait 15 minutes for the kid to show up.  Knowing he'd be late I took the opportunity to stroll around the block and when I returned the line is what most people would consider intimidating at the least.  We walk in, put our names in, hear that it will be 1 hour and 1/2 before we get a table so we decide to hover over the people comfortably seated at the bar.  I nudge my elbow in through the patrons (most of them with entrees in front of them) and manage to order a pitcher of Sangria.  I pour 2 glasses, we toast (to SF- what else) and then look around at the crowd.  I give Eric a nod, he responds with an understanding raised eyebrow and disappears over to the hostess booth.  He comes back (5 minutes later) with a big grin on his face, and about 8 minutes later the hostess comes over to us with menus ready to show us to our seats at the loft.  \n\nI save my questions until we are seated.  \"Alright\", I say.  \"How did you pull that off\"?  He looks at me, takes a drink of Sangria, crosses his leg, opens the menu and says, \"I think I'll start with the Calamari\" and closes the menu.  I throw my hands up (shoulder high, open palm) and he said, \"look Ben.  I just went up to the counter and smiled and asked, 'why do you hate me'?\"  I laugh, he laughs, we look at the people across from us and they laugh (I'm so glad laughter is viral and contagious) and we order our plates.\n\nBecause I was on (the) BART, and because I'm a germ-a-phobe I excuse myself to wash my hands (throwing my napkin from my lap onto the table).  I come back, sit down and notice my napkin is folder rather nicely atop the table.   Apparently, one of the servers noticed that it was wrinkled and didn't meet the standard they'd like portrayed and came over to fold the thing while I was gone!

Gotta go back again and try their ceviche, plus there were some other dishes on the menu that looked really good.\n\n1/18/07 update - went to Limon again last Sunday.  Even though it was so cold out I just had to try the sangria.  I'm glad I did, it was so good, with lots of fruity bits!  Tried the Ceviche Limon this time and it was really good, and dessert was wonderful - I think it was called Tres Leches or something like that.  Our waiter was funny and friendly.  Bring a sweater if you're sitting in the man room because it can be drafty -- or maybe that was just because of the cold night.", "author": "DD B."}

The room is tastefully decorated and the eye candy is top notch. Beside being gorgeous, I think these are some of the best waiters in town.\r\n\r\nStarted it off with a bang- a pitcher of exquisite Sangria. It is not especially fruity, medium-bodied with a lovely hint of cinnamon. Next, some ceviche. Limon offers 7 types of ceviche, so we decided to go with the house-named Ceviche Limon. It was really light in lime juice with large pieces of halibut and shrimp. Scrumptious. Followed the ceviche with empanadas. The empanadas were on the larger side, but only come with two. So, if you have a large group this would not be a recommended appetizer. However, they were delicious- filled with sauteed ground meat and perfectly cooked without too much grease/oil. I would have thought they were baked if I didn't know better. \r\n\r\nWe each ordered different entrees to get a good sample of the menu. I had the arroz con mariscos- basically a Peruvian paella. It was excellent with the perfect balance of flavors and no shortage of seafood. \r\n\r\nAnd finally, dessert.  We were treated to an assortment of desserts on the house and they were to die for. Tres Leches cake was the most perfect version I have ever tasted. It was extremely light and fluffy but had the perfect creamy flavor. Then we had three helados (ice cream) with berries. My goodness it was to die for. My fav was the coconut. YUM. \r\n\r\nI will most definitely be back to Limon. It is now my favorite restaurant to hit in the Mission.", "author": "Anna S."}

It had the nice decor with high ceiling and spacious seating.  Since my friend needed to attend a dinner and we got there pretty late (3 p.m.), I ordered Ceviche Limon and some octopus cold appetizer.  Both of them were pretty good, if lacking the extra tastiness that would make me appreciate the food more fondly.  That was the first time I had ceviche, but from my understanding it's the combination of fishes and milder salsa sauce.  As we wanted to eat something more, sauteed sirloin slices.  That was also good, but again missed the extra something.  \n\nWhen I talked about this to my former co-worker that lives in SF, she told me that she liked Fresca in Fillmore St. more.

Well, the 2 hostesses were incredibly rude and I would not come back here no matter how much I liked the food. I arrived early and told the hostess I was still waiting for a friend. She didn't tell me that there was a wait or that I could put my name down until I asked. No big deal. \n\nI came back 10 minutes later and another hostess was working. She didn't say anything to me even though I was the only person waiting in the front. After my friend came, they asked us three times if we had reservations - we didn't, we didn't, we didn't. We asked for a table for 2 and the hostesses talked amongst themselves for an uncomfortable amount of time - as if we were rudely imposing on them. They ended up putting us in a dark corner upstairs. . \n\nWhen we left, they made no eye contact with us, but cheerfully said good night to the older couple right behind us. \n\nI didn't know whether I was discriminated against because of my age or race but I don't appreciate it.

There were five of us and we ordered drinks and then food.  Two meals arrived immediately (the chicken) and then the drinks (Pisco Sours so it would have been nice to have them before dinner).  The two meals sat there while the other three  were being prepared.  We ate and were sitting talking while we waited to pay--and tipped generously--and talked a very short while after paying.  There was no one waiting for the table or at all, but the server came and asked us to leave because there were reservations coming in.  This was a little after 8 at night.  In fairness, two of us got lost and went to the wrong restaurant so our 6:30 companions sat for half an hour waiting for our arrival, which may have meant that our waiter was not getting as much traffic at his table. The latter is the only explanation I can have for his rudeness.  I cannot, however, ever remember being asked to leave when no comment was made upon arrival that the table needed to be turned over and there was no one waiting in the restaurant for a table. We would have immediately left had the latter been the case.  We were a very quiet group (one Pisco sour a piece) and three of us middle aged, I hasten to add.

The quality of the food was wonderful, and there were some interesting dishes on the menu.  I had the crispy red snapper, which was done just right and presented in a way that I've never seen before.  The fish meat was carved off and the skeleton with head and tail intact was fried into a curve.  The rest of the meat was cut up and fried in a light batter coating, and then piled into the curve of the fish skeleton.  The dish came with stir-fried coconut rice, some greens, and a sauce that tasted very South-Indian.  It was an excellent dish.  The empanadas were excellent.  The ceviche was good, but it was served in too many pieces -- all the elements didn't fuse together into a greater whole.  The truffled mac'n'cheese was one of the most interesting dishes I've had.  The cheese was subtle enough to let the truffle come through strongly.\n\nOnce the service started, it was amazingly attentive.  It did take some time for someone to take our order, but that may have been our fault for being in conversation.  Note that you will only be seated when your entire party is present.\n\nThe tres leches with ice cream was a tasty dessert, though I didn't have much of it after my large meal -- we ordered two appetizers and three entrees for three people.\n\nThe decor, noise-level, and layout were all welcoming and pleasant.

I've been dying to try their infamous Pargo Rojo (crispy whole red snapper basket, served with stir - fried coconut rice and rocoto curry sauce  27.95). The plating was beautiful, fun, and the red snapper was delicious. However, the red curry was a bit bland for my taste and the coconut rice had too much coconut I felt. But overall I was satisfied with what I had and didn't regret my choice. My bf ordered the Lomo Saltado (traditional peruvian dish of top sirloin slices sauteed with onions, tomatoes and fries, served with a side of rice 18.95). From the description we assumed the fries were going to be on the side, but it was mixed and cooked in with the whole dish! Awesome. Even better.\n\nI noticed that everyone working here that night was male, latino/hispanic (i think), friendly, and very professional. Everyone had smiles on their faces and when the maitre d' brought us to our table he pulled out my chair AND my bf's chair! As well as laid down the napkins on our lap! We felt so undeserving. I can't count the number of times our glasses were refilled and our crums cleaned from the table. When tables were cleared for the next diners to arrive, the waiters would set down the table settings so precise and gentle, almost like he was about to be graded on his work. Watching the staff move around I noticed that everyone was pulling their weight evenly. No slackers. Everyone was on the same page. Just a group of hard workers. I admire that. I'm assuming that's one of the main reasons why Limon is so successful. \n\nUpon leaving we got the best thank you/come again/goodbye ever. Our waiter thanked us and said bye. Our bus boy thanked us and said goodbye. Two maitre d's thanked us a said goodbye. And the chef/owner thanked us and said goodbye too. I love how they make each person feel like they're the only diners in the restaurant. At least, that's how we felt. We had to leave 30% tip.

The ceviche at Limon is actually quite good if you stick to the traditional ones, either just with fish or with fish and seafood, but the sampler plate doesn't bring anything new and can be avoided.\n\nNo, the problem I have with Limon is that it feels like it's all about surfing the hype and squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspicious gringo. From that matter, they do bear their name well: step in there and you are guaranteed to feel their unique \"Limon squeeze\".\n\nI went once already about 2 years ago. I found the check out of touch with the food they serve and I did not go back until the other day even though I live just around the block. This time around, all the prices had been jacked up to the point they're almost a joke.\n\nThe food itself, with the exception of a very correct ceviche, wasn't even that good. I ordered the scallops with foie-gras. Hey, I'm French, I wasn't going to miss out on that! I'll enjoy every bit of foie-gras before they make it illegal in California. Or so I thought... Small square plate, 2 scallops in opposite corners, 1 little coin-sized piece of foie-gras on top of each, a Jenna Jameson bush of greens in the middle... What the heck?! For 14 bucks, you could not have given me a decent serving?\n\nNow about the taste... The cook slapped in it the delicacy of a Vegas surf-and-turf.  Instead of using a raw, pink, subtle, melting foie-gras, he took the gamey kind and overcooked it. Of course, it was a complete clash! So I ate the foie-gras with the fig sauce first, then the scallops totally on their own 'cause they wouldn't speak to the figs either.\n\nWell well well. What's next? The cheapest dinner plate on the menu, the 22 bucks Picante de Mariscos. Not much to say on that one: mushy rice, heavy cream sauce, same taste across the entire dish. Is it a calamari I just put in my mouth or a piece of shrimp? A diced potato maybe? You get the picture.\n\nThe Parihuela and the red snapper were of the same vein: heavy-heavy and no love at all.\n\nFinally, a little word about the drinks. Sometimes chefs who feel they can't live up to the hype have the wisdom to put one or two cheap drinks on the list, just to keep the patrons a bit loopy, focusing a bit more on the glass and a bit less on the plate. Not here. As for the rest, they don't care. They don't have to, the hype continues to draw the crowds. The cheapest glass of wine is at $10 and the rest... forget about it. They don't even offer a decent bottle at $30.\n\nSo what's left to say? When you're standing by the door, about to leave, the head waiter will bow obsequiously, exhibiting a large smile: \"Thank you, sir, thank you!\"... Well, I might have been screwed but at least it was with a smile. De nada, amigo. I'm glad you enjoyed it because it will be the last time.", "author": "Pierre S."}

The staff never effed anything up but were the horrid combo of curt and pushy to the point of distracting from the excellent food. The worst part is that our server was being shadowed by a trainee who will carry this shitty attempt at service to your future.\n\nWe were constantly pushed to finish wine so as to be sold another carafe, nearly had a half finished plate of excellent ceviche taken from us by a busser who didn't understand our objections despite the fact that there was a ton of fish still on the plate and our forks were obviously still active. I understand the desire to move courses along but expect communication and intelligence to win out over bs orders to move customers along. I also understand the desire to sell, but a place such as Limon should have servers talented enough to sell suggestively or to recognize a table where 'selling' is inappropriate.\nYour staff failed so miserably in these aspects that despite no adverse service eff-ups my party felt crowded and rudely treated. Unacceptable.\n\nPS -- also caught your floor mgr on cell phone blocking access to bathroom hallway, hostess on cell phone at front host stand. The perfect compliment to uninformed/poorly executed table service.\n\nAlso, I am a lifelong restaurant worker/business owner/manager. Not a novice. I never send complaints like this, however, tonight's experience sits so poorly in my memory when compared with the excellent food quality that I felt it was worth mentioning.", "author": "Giants C."}

It is a fun atmosphere for groups and dates alike and the food is consistently fantastic.\n\nWithout a doubt, start with one of Limon's many many ceviche options. I prefer the creamy shrimp vegetable sauce with shrimp (shrimp on shrimp). The shrimpies are huge and the taste is delightful. \n\nThe menu provides various Peruvian options, but don't shy away because you aren't sure what Peruvian food really is. The food is not overly ethnic, there are seafood dishes very similar to paella (Arroz con Mariscos) and a grilled sirloin with french fries dish  (Lomo Saltodo) you can't find elsewhere. Also, if you dare, they serve a crispy snapper with the head smiling up at you from your plate. The coconut cake dessert with sorbet is a perfect finishing touch. \n\nThe best thing about Limon is the decor (colorful) and the atmosphere (lively). Some complain about the noise level but on a weekend night before I hit the town, I appreciate that energy. One last thing you can't miss-- Limon's sangria. A perfect blend.

Perhaps it was the late reservation of 9pm that helped pave the way.  Whatever the case, once we had our place, the service was prompt and professional.  Drinks and appetizers were ordered and off they went. All the more better because we were starving.  \n\nPlated in an eye pleasing manner, I had no trouble diving right in and destroying the presentation.   Among the appetizers - baby octopus, crispy calamari, marinated chicken - I thought their ahi tuna was the best, fresh with a spicy kick.  \n\nThe sangria was overly sweet, and after awhile started to taste like fruit punch.  Not the best I've ever had, but by the third or fourth pitcher, it begins to grow on you.  I would have settled for a nice bottle of wine instead given the food pairing.\n\nFor my main entree, I had what I believed to be the pork loin.  It was cooked to perfection, the white meat tender without a hint of dryness. \n\nThe portions in relation to the price is reasonable.

He said it's probably the best peruvian food he's ever had. Which is pretty bold considering he's been to peru a few times.\n\nI absolutely agree. I will rate everything I ordered:\n-Cau cau de mariscos: A delicious soup like mix of clams, mushrooms, fish, and other stuff...  What i love about this plate is the lack of that fishy taste or smell.  I abhor anything fishy.  So I was impressed with this dish.\n-Chicharron de Pollo: normally chicharron is a style of pork thats been deep fried in such a way that it's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Like biting into a creme puff (sorta).  But traditionally they do this with pork... how Limon managed to do this with chicken really boggle my mind.  So good. Salty and crispy on the outside... tangy and soft as you chew.  it burst in your mouth with flavor.\n-Empanadas:  Pretty popular in south america. the dough was flavorful and the stuffin out of this world.  I dipped it in the sauce that accompanies the dish.  Good with or without. \n-Churrasco a la parrilla:  A grilled ribeye, the kind you eat on a sunday with friends accompanied by mexican beer!  very tasty. The seasoning really gave it a zesty kick of flavor as i bit into it.  i loved it.\n-Lomo saltado: this by far was my favorite dish here.  And pretty much the best lomo saltado I've had anywhere.  ANYWHERE.  The meat was well done but still tender.  The tomatoes and fries. with rice... wow.  So many different taste and textures.  Amazing.\n-Sangria:  I've had  enough sangrias in my day to judge a good sangria from bad and let me tell you: the sangria here is probably among the top 3 sangria i've ever had.  It was silky.  with a sweet flavor.  You can tell they used a decent bottle of wine: maybe cuz frisco is so close to napa. I dunno. but we were really impressed. The fruits in it were fresh. They didn't have the old lazy pruney look that i've seen in some sangrias.  I even tasted ginger!  very good stuff indeed.\n\nAs far as decor, its very modern, the seats were a bit uncomfortable. The bar looked nice. The staff was extremely courteous and attentive. My water glass was never half less than half full.  And when we ordered our sangria pitcher they were always there to top us off.\n\nOverall I was impressed and very pleased with my experience at Limon.

Certainly pricey, but also exquisite food and fantastic service.  \n\nAnd vegetarians, don't be deterred by the fact that there is only one vegetarian entree.  I had the veggie plate and it was superb - a rice dish with vegetables (and possibly some kind of cheese).  I'm making it sound plain, but it was as far from plain as you can imagine.  They are clearly big on presentation here.  My friend ordered one of the seafood dishes (they have mostly seafood dishes) and loved it.  We split a salad which was also lovely and tasty.  \n\nLimon is certainly buzzing on its own hype but they do offer great service, stylish presentation, and some unique and mouth-watering flavor combinations.  \n\nMy one critique is that the place is rather loud and crowded.  They have packed the tables in too close together: it isn't physically uncomfortable but you will have a hard time hearing a person even a foot away from you.  If it were a little less loud, it would be a much better setting for a romantic dinner.", "author": "Ann S."}

The Peruvian corn reminded me of my trip to Peru where I decided I needed to be adventurous and sample the local fare.  So, I ordered cuy, which turned out to be a flattened, fried guinea pig accompanied by potatoes and corn.  Imagine a guinea pig, with its little rodent face with big teeth and little tiny legs with sharp claws all dead atop a pile of potatoes and big corn kernels.  Yes, it tasted like chicken.\n\nBut I digress.  My pork chop was absolutely delicious - possibly the best I've had in the city.  I really enjoyed the mushroom, bacon, potato complement.  Probably because it included bacon.\n\nMy dining companion ordered the roasted chicken breast, enticed by the promise of truffle-infused mac & cheese.  He enjoyed the chicken.

I was especially surprised by the tenderness of the squid, I had never had it like this before and I can say it's now my favorite. The drinks were strong - a little pricey but super good. \n\nThe food here comes family style but not in the way that I traditionally think of family style. I think family style like Italian food where there's a giant platter and everyone can dig in. In fact the food is perfectly paired for two people to share, great for a date but not as a family otherwise you have to order a lot more dishes. For instance we ordered the empenadas and the plate came with two. Not great for a family but for a date it worked out perfectly because we didn't have to fight over anything.\n\nThe quality and taste of the food was terrific. I've only ever had empenadas homemade from a Latina woman at the farmers market so I'm spoiled, but this gave her a run for her money! We had the pollo ones with capers and hard boiled eggs. We also had the beef (rib meat I think) and as I tried to pick it up and put it on my plate, the meat literally fell apart. It was THAT tender! So we just ate it off the serving plate. It was like a potroast with the usual veggies but the spices were different. \n\nOh we also had the sweet potato fries - didn't really \"go\" with the other two dishes but they sounded too good to pass up and they were definitely worth fighting over.\n\nI would happily go again for a date.

Yes the meat was quite tasty yet there was something missing, like a \"ummph\" in a dish. I couldn't tase the raisin that was said to be included in the empanada and I wish there were more ingredients in it other than the beef.

The padded banquettes and the over-sized pitchers of tasty sangria made the landing as smooth as it possibly could be. \r\n\r\nThe ceviche, a specialty of the house and a dining highlight, came in an assortment of flavors and it was certainly raw, very much like me sitting there taking the news while trying to maintain an even keel. I'd love to review the main courses, which certainly looked great and I'm sure that they were all \"Peruvian\" and whatnot, but my taste buds failed to register them as the bites passed through my mouth on the way to my stomach.  I'm certain that it was no fault of the chef's, it's just that my palette had left the building like Elvis on X-lax.\r\n\r\nLimon is the best Peruvian food I've ever had, but that's not saying very much for the place!", "author": "Brian S."}

From the first bite to the last very juicy. Now for the business part the french fries were standard frozen type thin fries. We also ordered the Lomito Saltaldo they brought the food out in one of those futuristic oval dishes the looked a tad on the small side. The beef sirloin strips had hardly any flavor other than a hint of smoke from the broiler,the tomatoes onions and french fries were all over cooked and were drowning in heavy soy sauce. Also what happened to the rice? We asked and they don't serve it with rice here. There is a Peruvian restaurant near Santana Row that makes this dish perfectly. If it weren't for the chicken I would have given two stars.

No.  I am not from Peru and I've only spent a few weeks traveling from the sea to the Andes but from all the restaurants I visited in the small towns, big cities, and rural villages of Peru, I never once saw truffled mac & cheese or fried calamari on the menu. They got it right with a couple of the seafood & beef dishes. Definitely got it right with some of the ceviche appetizers. The sweet potato, chiles and corn in the Ceviche Limon reminded me of some of my finer moments traveling through this beautiful country. But for a country sometimes referred to as the \"land of the purple potato\", there were more rice dishes than potato dishes on the menu. \n\nWhy does a restaurant call itself \"Peruvian\" when it's not. It's fusion. It offers the standard sophisticated fare you see across San Francisco from the Mission to Pacific Heights to the Ferry Building. San Francisco is a tough town. We are spoiled here with many amazing restaurants and cuisines to choose from. I realize to stay in business a chef usually has to keep fried calamari and desserts like creme brulee on the menu no matter what ethnic cuisine they are claiming to prepare and serve. \n\nYou'll enjoy the scene, the cocktails and your dinner but there is nothing unique about Limon. To stay on top of the competition and stay in business - you have to serve to the masses.", "author": "Muir P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-12-04", "description": "\"Limon, Spanish for yummers!\"\n\nOk, so this is my first review here on yelp, come to think of it, this is my first review ever! So here it goes.\n\nA friend of mine from LA told me to go and check Limon out, so like the good push over that I am I did not hesitate to go as soon as the opportunity presented it self.  But first I had to check it out on the internet, you know, to see what the fuzz is all about. The first thing to caught my eye was that it was a Peruvian cuisine restaurant (what?! I mean, I've never heard about Peruvian food being trendy and none the less tasty, I mean I had the impression that Peru was famous for its Llamas, coca leaf eating Incas, Machu Pichu, meteorological phenomenon \"el Nino\" and of course who can forget Disney's adorable but sarcastic character emperor Kusco from the Emperor's New Groove).\n\nI went with a very beautiful person to that place (I know that doesn't have any thing to do with the whole write a review thingy, but I just had to let you know, ji!).\n\nWe had a reservation at 8pm but got almost 20 minutes early, we thought we would had to wait at the bar, but 40 seconds later we were being seated on our proper table.  The waitress was very amicable, and even though she wasn't Peruvian or South American as a matter of fact, she had ample knowledge about the Latin wine list and menu.\n\nI let my companion choose the wine, she is the expert and I know my weaknesses. For what I saw they had an abundant selection of South American wines and some from California, but like she said, you don't come to a place like this and order California wine and I agreed (proving once more the push over that I am).\n\nWe ordered the ceviche de camaron, which where very tasty, it was like if I had prepped them my self on my favorite \"restaurante de mariscos\" back in Mexico, with the lime and the taste of different types of bottled salsas you find in the Hispanic isle of your local supermarket, perfectly balanced and distributed on the plate. I am guessing they don't use those salsas I am talking about, but if they do, they have the gift of balance. I had to fight several waiters with a fork because they where very eager on taking the plate even though a couple of prawns where still bathing on that tasty tasty pool sauce.\n\nFor the main course we ordered the lomo saltodo which was also very good, it comes with fries and onions that are soaked with the beef buttery sauce, I recommend this dish. Also had the pollo latino which was a pan roasted chicken breast that came with macaroni and cheese that left my thinking those people in Kraft, they don't even know... That last dish is one of the restaurants most traditional plates or so the waitress said. I belive, I belive.\n\nMy whole dining experience here was great; I have to say Viva Peru! You have changed my whole point of view of what I thought about you in general. Peru has obviously gathered the best of their surrounding countries like, Brazil, Argentina and Chile, but also allowing some American influence to develop these perfect latino-american dishes.\n\nJust one little tic tac of a detail, as I finished my dinner I went to the bathroom and on my way there, I heard a waiter speaking spanish to a bus boy,  they where talking about the Mexican \"clasico\", Guadalajara vs America, me being Mexican and a FUTBOL fan, approached the waiter and asked him in spanish about the game and the score, on what he responded to me in Spanish, \"um, I don't\" , he was Argentinean, I could tell by his accent, that's why I didn't get upset, it just confirms my theory that Argentineans don't know any thing about FUTBOL. (I am only kidding, boludo te quiero!)\n\nSo in conclusion this is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very, good place to come to eat, there 400 words, thank you very much.\n\n                                                      THE END", "author": "Hector S."}

The price for the meal was not printed on the menu, and we felt kind of weird asking since we made a reservation and we weren't going to just get up and leave. It was $90 for 5 courses.

He had been there with a friend when he was in the City a couple months back and had raved about it. We took BART down to the 16th and Mission station and walked about three or four blocks to a street that was lined with pretty much every big international cuisine (Indian, Thai, Mexican etc). Limon is Peruvian. \n   We got there on a Saturday not long after they opened. They sat us at a table for two and offered us their menus. We ordered the mango lemonade upon suggestion from our waiter (a great choice) who also let us sample the strawberry lemonade for comparison. The menu features primarily small plates with three or four large plates. But you really should share.\n   We got the yuca fries which are crazy addictive (came with two spicy sauces, one green and one orange) which are like logs of crispy tender yumminess. We also got the chicarrone chicken which had the right amount of spiciness with a crispy exterior and managed to keep a bit of moistness on the inside. The clear vinegary sauce didn't work as well for me as using the sauce from the beef empanadas which was herbally and soft which was a better match for the salty chicken. We also got the lomo saltado which was so mouthwateringly savory that I didn't know how to stop eating it. It's like a Peruvian steak frites. The fries were bathed in the same sauce as the beef and red onions so you had a forkful of yumminess each time. It comes with a side of rice that you end up sopping up the sauce in to clean the plate.\n    It was a full meal. We were quite full for a few hours after we left the restaurant.

But my experience at Limon Saturday March 6th, was one of the worst SF dining experiences I've ever had.  Just to get it out of the way: the food was very good, albeit a bit salty (my Peruvian friend who ordered for us concurred), and the service ONCE SEATED was fairly good, if a bit disorganized.\n\nThe short version: reservations for 6 at 8:00 on a Saturday night.  We arrive on time, and are told there is a slight delay.  No problem - we wander across the street to Casanova for a few drinks.  And we proceed to check in every 10 minutes for AN HOUR AND A HALF.  Hostesses' response: \"your table will be ready in 10 - 15.\"  We only put up with it because our friend was dead-set on going to Limon, and just as we're walking around the corner for a burrito Limon calls and we're seated at 9:30.  We enjoy our meal, make a passing comment to our waitress (not her fault!), watch our waitress argue with the manager, and receive our bill, which we pay in full.\n\nI approach the manager, Enrique (sp?), introduce myself, and describe our experience.  His response: \"This is the way we've done business for 7 years, and it seems to have worked out fine for us.\"  He gives a cursory apology in a completely uncaring tone, and repeats himself after I suggest that they not take reservations that they can't honor.  The Manager COULD NOT HAVE CARED less.  I later find out that a waitress there is quiting that night because of the management.\n\nBottom line: good food, but I REFUSE to give business to management who doesn't care about their staff or their customers.  I might have even been satisfied with a meaningful apology or explanation, but Enrique's attitude was unbelievable.

However, what you really do need to get for an appetitizer is the Vieres con Foie Gras.  My lord is this a decadent dish: scallops and foie gras served over a creamy yucca puree w/ fig sauce.  The sauce is divine with the richness of the mixture of the scallops and liver.   \n\nI always have meaty things in mind when I think Peruvian.  The Churrasco a la Parilla was a thick juicy delicious steak.  I did wish that that provided more of the mustard sauce.  The fries also  felt like they were missing some seasoning.  However, the Lomo Saltada is even better, just amazingly tender. Each slice of steak of the Saltada is an burst of flavor in the mouth.  Top all of it with a Sangria, and it's all a very delicious endeavor.\n\nThe decor does need some what of a makeover.  It does seem a bit too drabbly dark due to the dark green interior.

We booked an upstairs table for my cousin's 30th birthday, and because of the size of the party (about 18 people) were required to order the prix fixe menu at $30 per person. After waiting nearly an hour past when we were seated, we got tiny bowl after tiny bowl of salad, not even nearly enough appetizers for the entire table, and to add insult to injury, they brought about 12 pieces of chicken to feed the entire table. When we pointed out to the waiter that there were a number of us who hadn't even had an entree, he argued with us about the menu before finally bringing one more plate - enough to just give everyone one piece (fine by me, although not having eaten since breakfast I went home still hungry, but some of the husbands were looking a little wan after just a few bites of salad and a bit of chicken). The chicken was delightful, I'll give them that, and the ceviche was very tasty, but frankly this was a rip-off, and I would not come again. There are plenty of places in the Mission where I could have a full, wonderful meal for a fraction of the price - and don't even get me started on the cocktail prices. Not to mention, the upstairs is sonically awful - if anyone in your party wants to talk to each other, prepare for them to have to scream. Ugh.", "author": "Sarah L."}

I managed to correct that and we were seated shortly thereafter.  I had the Seco de Costilla (shortrib served over herb mashed potatoes with peas and carrots, spicy cilantro-huacatay sauce) as a main which was equally great.\n\nThey reminded us twice that \"everything might take a while because they prepare everything from scratch\" which may be true but after hearing it more than once, it comes off somewhat gimmicky.\n\nOverall, a fabulous evening.

To my car, which seemed like it was parked in the Marina because that was the closest spot I could find. I normally like the rain, but I wasn't dressed for it and had no coat and no umbrella. As the downpour became unbearable, I stepped off the street and into Limon, where I discovered a beautiful haven.\n\nI wrung out my sweatshirt to the best of my ability and sat down at the bar, where I found delightful service. This began my Limon odyssey, and I've been back several time.\n\nThe food is quite simply delicious. I once woke up in the middle of the night craving their ceviche. The yellow one with the bright taste. It's my favorite. If you go, you should definitely order the ceviche platter, or whatever it is called. You get to choose four types, and they are all incredible. I could easily order a meal from their appetizers, which are all great - especially the empanadas. The calamari is also crisp and fresh-tasting. For entrees, I would recommend the lomo saltado as a typical Peruvian dish and the whole fried fish for something fun to look at.\n\nIf I go with just one other person, I usually ask to sit in their lounge area upstairs that overlooks the kitchen. You get to watch all the action going on, and it is fun.\n\nThis whole restaurant is fun though. The servers and waiters are always smiling and joking around. And really, the bill comes out surprisingly inexpensive. My only complaint would be that it can get really noisy.

The red snapper was fresh and delicious, great portion but the fish didn't seem to be marinated long enough in the lime juice.

Regardless, there was nothing left on the plate when I was done.\nLomo Saltado -- Whoa. The meat was incredibly flavorful. I usually prefer red meat (the more raw, the better) and this one was cooked medium-well. It's wok-tossed sirloin with grilled onions, tomatoes and AMAZING french fries on top as a side dish/garnish. The french fries are lightly cooked in truffle oil, giving them a completely different twist on regular fries.\nTruffle-infused Mac & Cheese -- I have no words.

I finally found something I could eat in the form of ceviche (which I've never bad before and was way yummy), spicy chicken skewers, some steamed veggies (which did not retain their heat) ,and some white rice.  The food I was able to eat was on the 'appetizer' menu.  My friend ordered off the main course menu.  They brought out my food way early, and brought their's out only when we said something.  This, in my opinion, was poor customer service.  I felt I had to wait until my friend got their food, while mine got cold.  The waiter knew about my food allergy, and so he knew the food I was ordering was for my main meal.  As a waiter, you *gotta* ask, or put two and two together.  It's just common sense as a wait person.  The food was *good*, but nothing to really write home about.\n\nI understand liquor licenses are hard to come by and are a pain in the rump to maintain, but Soju is utterly gross to me, and I won't drink it.  I *refuse* to drink it (it tastes so gross to me).   I don't drink wine, and I can't drink beer, so they lost money on me in the drink department.  A bottled cider on the menu would have made an additional $5 off me.  I stuck with water.  \n\nWe were in a hurry, but still managed to get our food and get out of there in time to get to our destination.  I'm not really fond of the whole 'metro-restaurant-feel'  (Sorry, I don't know what else to call it;  the decor of places like this, T-Rex, Sea Salt, etc), so I can easily skip this place, but if you're into that sort of atmosphere, try it, but don't expect a real 'taste of Peru'.", "author": "Missy W."}

Came here last night with a group of 8 people celebrating a birthday.  We had changed the reservation number the day of, and they accommodated it no problem.  We were seated upstairs on the mezzanine, which is great because you have a birds eye view of all the food coming out of the kitchen.   There was that usual uncomfortable silence at the table when nobody knows what to order or if it's going to be family style.  A couple of us took the lead and ordered a feast for all:  three cebiches (mixed seafood, mango&shrimp, and the tres tiempos).  The classic mixed seafood was the best.  They were out of the char grilled octopus (damn!), but we ordered the beef empanadas and the chicken skewers.  Also a couple orders of the Lomo Saltado, which was cooked perfectly medium rare.  I think this is the true test of any good peruvian place...if they can do the \"everyman's local dish\" well...then your home (just like a great italian restaurant better blow your socks off with spaghetti and meatballs...or I'm outta there!).  We also had the stuffed chicken dish, which again was cooked perfectly moist.  The truffle mac was awesome...maybe could have been a little more baked crunchy....but still great.  Finished up with four chocolate cakes for the birthday girl (with candles).  Our waitress was very personable and attentive.  High marks here all around.", "author": "Michael G."}

I was excited due to the reviews on yelp, but when I left, I was pretty dissapointed.  The atmosphere is great for going out, elegant, yet still casual and moderately loud.  The staff is very accomodating and welcoming, but we were charged a 18% gratuity for a party of 5... shouldnt it be 6+ at least? \n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\nAppetizers\n1. Ceviche Creme - a little on the spicy side, it definately has a kick to it. We tried it because none of us had ever tried a creme-based ceviche, and it was okay. Wouldnt order it again.\n\n2. Ceviche Limon - the acidity is exactly what we were expecting for a classic ceviche, but didnt dazzle us much. It was ordinary, good, and the seafood was good, yet tasted a little canned.\n\n3. Mac & Cheese - Good, solid mac & cheese. The pasta is well done, and the cheese is great; but honestly, I can make better mac & cheese at home with fresh cheese. \n\nEntres \n\n1. Pork Chop - I had the pork chop, and maybe because I had the best pork chops at RNM when they used to serve it, that I may be a little bias. They were dry (I got it medium), not enough sauce, yet still a little too spicy from the pepper and salt. The surrounding bits of bacon and potatos were also too salty/peppery, and I couldnt finish it all. I wouldnt recommend you ordering it.\n\n2. Beef with peppers and onions - this reminded me of a chinese stir-fry that you could easily get for $5, bigger portions. The beef, yet, was deifnately delicious, but for the portion, it was mostly veggies, rice, and small amount of beef. Honestly, Id rather go to a good chinese restaurnt for this dish, due to the price, but hey, it was pretty good. \n\nAll in all, it was a good place to try, but not a place you would keep going back.

After our meal, I still was not even slighlty buzzed, or flushed, and I'm Asian!!  Though it tasted good, the cost of the pitcher seemed a little too pricey.\n\nFoodwise, to start things off, we got the Trio de Ceviches and tried the first three ceviches on the menu (Ceviche Limon, Ceviche de Corvina, and the Camaron).  The flavor was good, but the pieces of fish did not seem to be the freshest . . a little too chewy to be considered a truly excellent ceviche.  My friend and I joked that had our Taiwanese folks come out, they would be calling the fish \"Cue Cue\" . . . I'll leave the translation for other Yelpers to decipher.  Personally, I think there are better ceviches elsewhere - Mochica is one place to check out for sure if you like ceviches. \n\nFor the main course, my friend had Lomo Saltado while I had the Picante de Mariscos.  She had been to Peru recently and wanted to compare the autheticity and taste of the dish which she said was similar to a Chinese beef stir-fry dish.  Her take on it after a few bites was \"my jaw is already sore\", and after she had all that she could, she contended that though flavorful, the white rice on the side might have been the best part!!  On the other hand, my Picante dish left me with little to complain about except for the meager portions of actual seafood.\n\nService was on par with other restaurants of the same caliber.  Overall, I would have to say I was disappointed at Limon considering all the hype.  We had gotten an early dinner reservation so though I might have been willing to give the benefit of the doubt at the end of a night as to my food not tasting as good, I really cannot justify why the food did not seem as fresh.

We have been going to Limon for years now and after this saturday will not go back after the way we were treated. We first walk in and get a table for two after a few minutes we order are drinks and food. Then we notice 3 serprate groups ranging from 2 people up to 5 people get seated rite around us. So we are conversing and enjoying are drinks and realizing it is taking a while to get our appetizers and food. So us realizing they are busy think nothing of it until we saw all the people who sat down after we ordered our food getting there appetizers and food. So we think the kitchen just did the orders in the wrong order and think nothing else of it. Another 15 minutes go by no waiter check in nothing so we get up to ask whats going with our food and by chance get the manager who is an arrogent piece of sh!t and basically explain that three other parties have been seated after us and have already gotten there food and finished before we even got our appetizers. The manager at this time does not apologize and does say anything and just ask us if we want our check. After this experience i will never go back to that palce ive been going there for years and I was very understanding about having to wait almost an hour for no food and see people who were seated after me finishing there meals while me and my girl hadnt even got our appetizers yet. And to get attitude from the manager about complaining about this was just the last straw. Limon the food was good while i was going there but your service is sh!t and we will never go back after even though we have been going since you guys opened!!!!!!", "author": "Patrick K."}

Immediately recognizable from the street by its stark, bright exterior, Limon is sleek, dim, and fairly loud inside. There is a bar along one side and an upstairs seating area for overflow. It is a shining exemplification of the gentrification that is taking place in the Mission. The menu is heavy on cocktails, appetizers, and small plates, and fairly light on entrees. We shared the Ceviche Limon to start - a raw assortment of shrimp, calimari, and white fish \"cooked\" in lime juice and \"leche de tigre\" along with sliced onions, hominy, and corn nuts. Refreshingly delicious. For my main course I had the Lomo Saltado - amazing. Sliced beef tossed with onions, french fries, and a rich, salty soy sauce. The main chicken course was also good but my mom was unimpressed with her chichen empanadas. For dessert there are profiteroles, cappuccino gelato, and a molten raspberry chocolate cake. \n\nDelicious diversion for Mission yuppies.", "author": "Alexander M."}

I start by saying that, because this is not somewhere that I would usually go because its a little expensive for my liking.

Two of the dishes we got were at least an 8 out of 10, and the other was about a 6, not bad in my book.  If you go, definitely get the Pargo Rojo.  The sangria was also very very good.  The only bad thing about the food is that they only have one vegetarian option, and it is \"chef's choice\", which always sounds a little menacing.\n\nOther than the food, the wait staff was extremely friendly/helpful, and the ambiance was pleasant, but maybe a little austere.

Having not seen him for awhile we were looking forward to a relaxing dinner. We did not know that it is Limon's practice to get people in and out of there as fast as possible.  We had drinks, our meal, dessert and coffee all in a little over an hour.  We managed to carry on our conversation despite constant interruptions.  The staff were very aggressive in trying to get our plates off the table - it was almost as if they were watching the small plates and if no one took a spoonful of something for 3 minutes they would come and try to whisk it away.  I am not exaggerating.  They kept trying to take our friend's drink glass, which still had a little bit in it that he wanted to savor, and ultimately they were successful in grabbing it before he was done with it.  They also repeatedly came over to ask if we were going to order something else, even as we were just starting our meal.  I assume they were rushing us  because it was Friday night and they wanted to turn over the tables as fast as possible.  One other consequence of this is that they bring the small plates as they become available, even when it makes no sense from a culinary standpoint.  We had only fries, yucca fries and rice to eat for the first 5-10 minutes - at least they could have brought the rice when the rest of the food was ready.  \n\nAs for the food - it was good but not great.

Unless if you want to get an early dinner like around 5-ish, there might be a possibility for you to get a table right away. \n\nThe calamari is always good for a starter but the reason you come to Limn is for the ceviche! They are to die for! Ceviche Limon and Ceviche de Camarones are my favorites. \n\nI would definitely plan my visit soon!", "author": "Perry S."}

Perhaps it is because this place is supposed to have a \"fusion\" element to it - that explains the cooking liberty.  For instance, there is a foie gras with scallops appetizer.  \n\nPretty neat looking in there.  It's very modern and the lime-colored walls add a nice glow.  It's perfect for its location - the Mission - which is allegedly up and coming.   Perhaps I should call it yuppified Peruvian food.   Kind of like going to PF Chang's for Chinese food. Service is a plus here - the waiter was helpful, polite and attentive.  Of course, we did have a 4:30 PM dinner and there were only two groups (including us) in our section - but he seemed to work well with the other group.\n\nWe had the lomo saltado (sirloin slices, onions, tomatoes and fries) and the arroz con mariscos (various seafood with rice and in spicy sauce).  Both meals were good.  I would probably go back just not for a couple of months.", "author": "Jimmy F."}

The rice tasted like it had saffron or garlic or something that made it taste amazing! \n\nThe ceviche (which is cold fish) was really good, it had a really tingy flavor (lemon and something spicy that I couldn't figure out). The sangria was OK, not as good as in Spain and had a little kick to it.\n\nThe food was amazing at Limon, but I have to say otherwise on the atmosphere. It was probably one of the loudest restaurants I have been to, you could barely hear people sitting two seats away! Also we had to wait a long time for our food, but we did have a big party, so I can't complain too much about that!

Limon ruined my birthday night! \n\nI reserved a table for 14 at 8:30pm at least a month ago for my birthday. And I had specifically asked Antonio, who apparently is the manager of Limon, if it was mandatory to have a prefixed menu for the size of my group because I know that is the general rule for a big group at this type of restaurant. But he kept saying, \"No it is only an option\". So then I decided to book the reservation under the impression that each person would not have to pay 39.95 for a prefixed meal. \n\nSo it is finally my birthday night, and I am so excited. Then I get a call at 4pm from the hostess, confirming my reservation. And that is when she tells me that there is a prefixed menu for a group of 10 or more. I am obviously frustrated and ask her if there is anything that can be done because I was told specifically that it was only an option! And there is no way that I can find another last minute restaurant for a group of 14 on a Saturday night!! So she says she will talk to the manager. I get a call back from her, saying she can waive the fee per person but that my reservation would be pushed back to 9pm. And I tell her that it is fine. Should be OK. \n\nSo when we get there. We wait and wait...9:15, 9:30, 9:45 etc We don't get seated til 10:15 to 10:30 pm! How does a reservation made a month ago turn from 8:30pm to 10:30pm?? And the whole time when I would ask when we would be seated, the hostess kept saying, \"All these people have made reservations too...the group here has already waited an hour and a half!\". Well you know what, lady, what is the point of a reservation if you have to wait 1 to 2 hours to be seated!! That is BS, I tell ya!!! \n\nThe food was the only redeeming factor, but waiting 1:30 to 2 hrs is not worth it.

At the time, they only canceled lunch service and reopened for dinner, albeit only on the ground floor. But now, it looks like there's more damage than originally anticipated (see the interior) and the place is officially shuttered for \"the next few weeks, until further notice.\" And yes, the latter part of that phrase is always an ominous sign.\n FireWire: Blaze Hits Limon; Lunch Off, Dinner On [~ESF~]\n\nhttp://sf.eater.com/archives/2008/06/02/firewire_limon_forced_to_shutt.php", "author": "Matt L."}

The food was incredible but the service was terrible. I couldn't believe it. With all the great waiters in San Francisco that are out of work, why would the management keep these guys? Answer: maybe they don't know any better..\n\nWe waited forever for our meal, although several tables who came in after we did were served with alacrity. Then, my husband discovered two clear, square pieces of PLASTIC in his fried calamarii. They were practically invisible, but could have been lethal. Since our waiter never checked in with us after serving, we pointed the plastic out to the busperson. We watched him take the plate to the owner (or manager) who carried it back to the kitchen. He came out and spoke to our waiter, who never said another word to us until he placed the check on the table. No one ever apologized and we were charged full price for the dish. \n\nIs this any way to keep a customer?", "author": "Sharon E."}

It's good for a date night or a larger group, so it seems to fit the bill when you want some modern Peruvian/American food.\n\nThe Ceviche Limon is standard ceviche fair.  Nothing spectacular, but nevertheless, quite good.\n\nThe Red Snapper is presented beautifully.  Very popular dish, as many tables around us also had the snapper.  It's filleted and cut into chunks and deep fried, and presented on the remainder of the fish, which is also deep fried. \n\nThe Pork Chop on cabbage was cooked perfectly:  Slightly pink in the middle and crispy on the outer edge.  It's topped with more pork bits (don't recall if it was pancetta or sausage)... Is there such a thing as too much pork?  Maybe.  But not in this case!\n\nWe asked our server to bring out the dishes in courses, and he was very happy to oblige.

We LOVE Peruvian food!  We're originally from Maryland where our favorite Peruvian restaurants are cheap, the food is served on styrofoam plates, sides are piled high, soda's in a can, and there's a TV in the corner playing a soccer match.  Limon is the complete opposite, and that's okay.  The food was delicious (excellent taste and presentation), the service was good, and the interior design of the place was cool.   Now, here comes my two minor complaints: 1) I understand they serve small plate/tapas style, but I didn't expect the serving size of their sides to be so stingy. We ordered yuca fries and got back about four yuca fries...artfully lined up...on a tiny plate.  Really?!  They're probably one of the cheapest menu item for the restaurant to make.  2.)

I took two out-of-towners here and was really let down by the service.\n\nFirstly, our drink order disappeared -- after having given the waiter our order we spent a good 15 minutes waiting. I mean you would have thought they'd have come to take our food order in that time, at which point we could have reminded them about the drinks. In the end we had to fetch another waiter to take our order and go look for our drinks.\n\nBut it gets stranger. The lights in our section started going on and off for about a minute. No idea why. No explanation given. The whole experience was getting weird -- and we began to feel an ominous sense there was more to come.\n\nWhich there was.\n\nWe got the sampler of 3 types of ceviche. Not bad. The only issue with this period of the meal was when a busboy came and topped up my sparkling water with his jug of tap (I had already narrowly avoided this, stopping someone previously just in time). When we explained what he'd done he just looked blankly at us and walked off. No offer of more sparkling or any other recompense.\n\nThe entrees arrived and my friend's fried snapper was promptly dumped in her lap when the busboy went to place her plate in front of her. Holy crap! If you weren't there it would be hard to believe. To their credit they were able to bring her another in a few minutes. And the food was delicious, it must be said.\n\nThe thing is, up until this point they hadn't once come over and properly apologized for anything, offered any free dishes or any other measure you'd expect a good restaurant to take when this sort of thing happens (which even in the best restaurant, it sometimes does). When the waiter came to take our desert order and my friend told him she was too scared to order anything else he looked confused as said \"uhhh, because things took a bit long tonight? sorry we were real busy\". We had to explain what had happened! (although he'd seen it all, surely). At which point we got free coffees and a desert.\n\nAccidents and issues with service are a great opportunity for a restaurant to show its true class. It's easy to be slick when everything is going along smoothly. It's how you handle the bumps that puts you a cut above in my mind. In this department I felt Limon failed.", "author": "Anson P."}

Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed when I saw the menu.  There was hardly anything peruvian aside from the ceviche.  Everything seemed to be more \"asian\" than peruvian.  The restaurant is definitely out of place in the mission... it's very clean, modern and contemporary compared to the taquerias around the corner.\n\nAs for the food...I liked their spreads that came with the bread - a garlic aioli type and some kind of spinach aioli or something of that sort.  The garlic (yellow) one was the favorite at the table.  Although the menu wasn't very impressive, the dishes didn't disappoint too much.  My friends got the chicken with mushroom stuffed pepper and truffle infused mac n cheese.  The chicken was very flavorful and according to my friend, the stuffed pepper was really delicious!  The mac n cheese was good, but nothing too impressive.  I got the ribeye with potatoes and green beans.  The steak was good, had some flavor, but didn't seem any different than any other steak... so, how was it peruvian fusion??  Another friend got the popular sirloin with rice and potatoes... This was a very asian dish.  Very tasty, but I still don't see how it was peruvian other than the fries (yucca roots).  Another friend got the fried snapper with curry sauce.  By description on the menu, it sounded mouth watering...  but by taste, it was not impressive.  The presentation was very eye catching though! See the pictures for more visuals.  The curry sauce didn't really go well with it... it was a bright orange curry sauce and i couldn't really pinpoint a good taste... it tasted... interesting.  Overall, the fish was something I wish I had skipped.\n\nSomething not to skip is the ceviche.  We got the red snapper ceviche, which was really good.  My friend who hates sushi and anything raw even liked it!  My only complaint about this is that it was hard to eat/share because it was in long thin strips instead of chunks.\n\nOverall, my picks for you if you go would be:\n- chicken with pepper and mac n cheese\n- red snapper ceviche\n- steak if you want steak... \n\nI only wish it was more peruvian.

My handsome took me here on a Friday night and boy, was it busy...there was not an empty table in sight with several parties still waiting for their table. Recession? Apparently not!\nThe decor was subtle, modern and simple. The hint of lime green and orange colors throughout the restaurant as well as in the food was a nice \"red thread\" touch.\nThe service overall was pleasant as well, although I have to say...sitting next to two tables who knew the chef and the waiter kind of made me feel unimportant. However, it didn't prevent them from paying their other patrons attention...But I'm just sayin'...\nThe menu was not extensive, but balanced and full of flavors. We started off with the Limon Cebiche. It had perfect portions of shrimp, calamari and tuna (at least I think that's what it was...). However, the squid was a bit chewy...bleh. I wish I tried the Cebiche shooters...they looked delish! The Empanadas de Carne was also good. A bit on the salty side, but it had a crispy pastry crust that made my mouth water.\nFinally, our entrees came. I had the Pargo Rojo (Fried Whole Red Snapper) but I made the mistake of trying his Lomo Saltado first. Medium rare steak, fries and onions...Wow, a salty punch, but delicious! Therefore causing my snapper to taste pretty bland. I also didn't like how my fish was staring right at me, cheezin' his teeth at me. My handsome had to discard his head for me...he gave me the heebeegeebees. I was expecting the snapper to be a bit more salty, since everything else seemed to be drenched in it! Oh well...\nAlas, Limon's saving grace: Dessert!  The Mango Pie, light, fluffy and whipped was quite tasty. So pretty. So precious. We also ordered the Cream Puffs, which were my personal favorite. Not too sweet, but oh so yummy!  \nOverall...I can do without...but glad to have had the experience.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

I went with a large group, so we had reservations and we did the Prix Fixe Menu.  It is a very busy, loud and lively place.  For such a large group, our customer service was excellent.  Although we had more than one server at any given time, they were all timely in refilling sangria and water glasses.  They evenly distributed the food throughout the table and were very attentive.  Now the food...We had the beet salad, tuna tartare, mixed green salad and the mixed ceviche for the first course.  I am not a tuna tartare fan, but this one won me over.  It was rich and smooth and \"meaty\" tasting.  The second course we had empanadas, the lomito saltado and the chiccaron de pollo.  They were all delicious, but the empanada shells reminded me of a hot buttermilk biscuit!  They won me over for this course!  For the last course we had fries, rice, and the whole reason why you go to Limon Rotisserie, the chicken!  Folks, this is not the supermarket rotisserie chicken, OK?!  It is hands down the best chicken ever!  The sauces were good, but I felt the chicken didn't need anything extra.  I am normally a dark meat chick and I decided to go for a breast piece and it was so moist and flavorful! For dessert, we had the chocolate cake, the profiteroles and the panna cotta.  I only tried the cake.  I was so full!  I unfortunately did not get to try to the truffle mac and cheese because it is not apart of the Prix Fixe Menu option our group chose.  This will be my excuse to go back!  I had a wonderful dining experience, even with a large group! The portions are great and the prices are affordable.

Sad, because I really love the taste of ceviche!\n\nThe food here is good and the only reason why Limon gets any stars; however, it's a tad overpriced.  We tried the Oyster Shooter ($3), the Ceviche Limon with fish, octopus, shrimp, and calamari ($12), the Quinoa and Wild Mushroom Risotto ($17) and the Lasana Amazonica for dessert ($8).  All of these dishes were pretty good, but generally the portion sizes were skimpy.   Plus, I found the \"leche de tigre\" sauce in the shooter and the ceviche overwhelming and felt like there was way too much lime.  For a better deal, head to Limon Rotisserie, which offers more delicious and abundant ceviche and other Peruvian food in a less stuffy atmosphere. \n\nKnocked down 2.5 stars for the service.  First, our server took FOREVER to even take our drink orders.  I saw a party who was seated after us happily sipping their mango soju cocktails and this was upsetting.  Then, our server gave me a strange look when I asked to keep a menu after we ordered.  Sorry, but I like to have the option of ordering more, especially if it's my first time at a restaurant.  I don't know why you'd complain if that means more money for you, mister!  Then, our server forgot our dessert until my boyfriend reminded him, after our server presented the check without the dessert.  To top it off, he tacked onto the bill two extra items on the menu that I most certainly did not order, and when I pointed this out to him, he said \"oh yah....I meant to take that off.\"  What if I hadn't noticed?  His behavior all night left an unsavory flavor in my mouth, so I won't be returning any time soon.  The Rotisserie definitely reigns supreme above this over-hyped joint.", "author": "Kira K."}

The service was great - not just our waiter, but everyone; they really worked together to the benefit of the guest (with the exception of when we first arrived --- no one even acknowledged us for a few minutes, which was strange, not even eye contact or a \"hi.\").   Bit of a bummer that we sat right by the front door because brrr.  Luckily there was eating and drinking to distract me from the arctic blasts.\nIt was loud, but people were having fun; I wouldn't recommend it for a first date, which is what I was doing, but with friends it'd be great.  We chatted a little with the guys sitting next to us (who were seriously having mouthgasms over the Lomo Saltado).  The sangria was great, but all those pesky ice cubes made it difficult to gulp, which is how I tend to drink sangria.  I only had an entree, so I didn't think it was too expensive.  I did think the ceviche looked like it was a pretty small portion for the price, and I definitely see how it would quickly add up with a few starters and THEN the entrees.  I had the Pollo Latino, and let me tell you kids, this is not your ordinary chicken dish.  It comes with this excellent, spicy au jus that I could've licked off the plate.  The broccolini was perfection, and I don't know that I have ever had anything as wonderful as the truffled mac n' cheese.  AND the best damn sweet potato chips ever --- I tend to find them just sweet, but these were salty and excellent.  My date was teasing me because I was seriously taking a bite of every item in order since the flavors went so well together.  I wasn't in the mood for dessert, so that may be why I wasn't so over the moon about it, but I thought the chocolate Tres Leches with ice cream was only okay.  No matter, I was still on cloud nine from my dinner.\nNow I see what I've been missing.", "author": "Jennifer D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-02-03", "description": "I was a bit disappointed by Limon. I came here for lunch and was really looking forward to something delicious with great service. \nThe seating staff were excellent and quite nice. We were practically alone as we got there about 20 minutes after they opened. \nThe waiter came over and pressed us for drinks when we were clearly not ready. He got huffy when we only wanted water, but didn't leave a drink menu in case we wanted to order later. I actually had to ask for one. \nBecause we weren't all that hungry, we each ordered just a main dish. I had the traditional stewed sirloin french fries and rice. Because their menu is limited, I  felt rather boxed in, and wanted to substitute the rice for sauteed spinach (something already on the menu). There was more huffiness from the waiter about substitutions, especially when I told him I simply didn't want to rice on the plate. It seemed like way to many carbs and no veggies at all. This was a privilege for which I was, I felt, overcharged. Quite frankly any restaurant that wants points for service needs to be accommodating. period.\nI eventually decided I felt like something sweet to drink, so I had a Riesling. Yes, it's not what should go with beef, but that's what I wanted.\nOur entrees came out with the wine, but the spinach was very late.  At that point I could have waited (and by the time it came it would have been pretty cold), or been left with sauteed spinach solo. I'm a bit puzzled as to why they didn't simply put the spinach with the beef as was the specified preparation on the menu. Sigh.\nMy food overall was pretty good, but there was hardly any meat, which made the balance off with too much onion and tomatoes. The french fries were interesting and different, but I really would have liked to try to the whole thing with the spinach. I'm very glad I didn't order rice, as it would have been one huge carb with just a tiny bit of meat. \nOverall 3 stars, it was good, but not great, though the waiter had the attitude that this was some amazing restaurant. To me it's not worth putting up with the prices and attitude if the food doesn't live up to it's reputation. Again, however, it was merely the waiter, and not the other staff which has clouded the impression, but I would not eat here again with all the wonderful food in the mission.", "author": "Kat C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-04-06", "description": "I'd have to say I have mixed reviews for this.  It is definitely on the pricey end and the place is really nice.  the lighting was dim with the walls having somewhat of an artsy mix of colors.  \n\nwhen we arrived, the host Antonio was really cool.  I had spoken with him on arranging a party of 17 people which would require a pre fix menu.  I'm guessing this makes it easier for them but then I would have rather had more choices.   However, since its eveyrone's first time there, it woulda been nice to just have a 3 course meal to make the night.  We'll come back to Antonio later.\n\nIF you're planning to get full and bloated after eating here, that is totally not what to expect.  I mean the portions are good, but it ain't no buffet!   Most of us had the cerviche mixto which was like lemon juice and some spices with raw seafood, somewhat simlar to sashimi but with lemon juice.  some of the stuff in here were calamari, shrimp, and some fish.  all really good along with a random piece of YAM.  yes, iono why it was in there, but don't mind if i do!\n\nNext course was a mushroomy filled with cream fried potsticker looking thing.  But it was good.  it came with some pink cream sauce that made it a good in between snack.  I wouldn't have minded to have another piece tho (it came with only 2)\n\nANd main dish, I had the snapper which looked like a filet o fish without the bun, but it was actually pretty good.  it looked simple, but it was cooked well and moist.  my friend had some stir fry looking steak and onion and fries.  that was pretty good too.  \n\nand for the dessert, we had the balladina or somethin with a choco souflet and ice cream.  THAT was hellllla good.  I think i've just gotten to liking dessert more.  note to self: save room for dessert.  \n\nok so back to Antonio, i'm guessing the restaurant owner/manager, had charged us 17 people for the table but with only 15 people showing up.  His reasoning was that he had lost money by having us stay ther for so long and that we had the pre fixed menu.  At the time, I was sympathetic with him for yes taking up so much space, but I did really enjoy the time there.  And I guess I did tell him beforehand we had 25 and then I changed it to 17, but now that I think about it, and my friend had actually mentioned it, that this is somewhat on the restaurant's fault and shouldn't really have the customers carry the burden and end up paying more than they should.  I'm not exactly sure how to justify the right and wrong, but prior to that, I did have a great time and definitely enjoyed the food.  This sorta makes me give Limon a 3 star, but it would probably be a 4-5 if I didn't run into that trouble at the end.", "author": "Vincent K."}

Arrived at 1:30pm and easily got a table. \n\nService: the host was friendly and the guy staff kept coming to clean our table with a very warm smile(5 stars for him).\n\nLunch menu:\nLimon Ceviche: 2 shrimps, octopus and fish. I wasn't too impressed with the dish especially the fish. Besides the acid taste, the fish was pretty bland and without much texture. If I was blindfolded, I probably couldn't guess it was fish(given I am a sushi lover). \n\nLomo Saltado: top sirloin stir-fried with onions & tomatoes, with fries, rice & two sunny side-up eggs(turned out to be eggs over easy). Yes, it was flavorful but I wouldn't say it had an authentic Peruvian taste. Actually,the dish reminded me of the Chinese soy sauce stir fried steak I had a week ago. Very similar in presentation(minus the fries) and taste.\n\nSnapper fillet: the best dish so far. Fish was very tender and tasty. For $12, it's worth it.\n\nPicante de Mariscos: the base was a spicy cream sauce which was very delicious with a kick. However, the whole dish only had 2 small-medium size shrimps, 2 mussels, and a couple small rings of octopus. I wasn't looking for a supersize dish. But I absolutely couldn't understand these average ingredients in a tiny portion. \n\nYucca Fries: very crispy with 2 somewhat tasteless dipping sauces.\n\nAftermath: I felt super thirsty the rest of the day. Either they used too much salt or MSG(or similar stuffs). \n\nI started to wonder if the restaurant paid those public figures to dine there.

Reservations are highly recommended for this place - make sure everyone shows up on time, otherwise you won't be seated.\n\nFood:  4 stars.   I heart Peruvian food.  I went with 4 other people, so I got to try a little bit of everything that we ordered:  tatara de atun, chicarron de pollo, ceviche limon, lomo saltado, pollo latino, pargo rojo (snapper), churrasco a la parilla, and amaretto tres leches for dessert.  The standouts were the chicarron de pollo (fried chicken nuggets), lomo saltado, pollo latino (with truffle-infused mac and cheese!), and the churrasco a la parilla (ribeye steak).  The fried chicken nuggets and ribeye were so good, I was getting food orgasms - thank god the restaurant was so noisy, because no one could hear me.  The tuna tartare had good flavors as well and was better than the ceviche.  I was a little disappointed with the snapper because a lot of people rave about it (yes, Michael Bauer, I'm talking about you), but other than the presentation, it's just not that good.  The amaretto tres leches cake was not moist enough (yet another M. Bauer recommendation).  We still ate every bite.\n\nService:  2 stars.   Limon upgraded everything during the move, but forgot to upgrade the hostess.  We had reservations for 5 people at 8pm and had to wait 30 minutes for our table in the tiny area between the bar and the front door.  The server was friendly and got most things right, but was not attentive enough to notice that our glasses of wine were empty for way too long.  The saving grace was the friendly bartender, which is good when you're waiting forever for your table to be ready.  \n\nAtmosphere:  3 stars.  \"What???

I would definitely come back to this place.\n\nLet me start with their drinks. I had a sip of their strawberry mojito and may have been one of the best I've had. It was the perfect blend of lemon juice and mints with the strawberries. Their sangrias was also very good. I did also notice that when you order it, they ask you how many glasses you want. They come back with that many glasses half full, plus a filled pitcher as well.\n\nThe food was definitely a plus. Even their bread (served with two different types of sauces) was very surprisingly good. I would come back just for that! Their ceviche was very satisfying. It's a must order if you come here. All the appetizers that our party ordered was good. As for the main entrees, they were also very pleasing. I got to try the pork chops, which was juicy and not dry at all. I ordered the fish and shrimp. That dish was very unique and flavorful. To some people, it may be too much flavor, but I thought it balanced itself out pretty well.\n\nThe service was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-04-02", "description": "I miss the days when Limon was just a tiny intimate restaurant that introduced us all to how great peruvian food can be. I remembered the pork chop to be extremely tender and flavorful. However upon return to the new location, larger dining room version of Limon, it was dry and bland. And then my last visit was ruined by having to sit at a table upstairs, which seems to magnify all the noise in the restaurant. And this restaurant is noisy! Secondly, our waiter was rude to us and unprofessional. We had ordered a sort of mashed potato dish that had crab in it. But instead we got a dish that had 4 peices of bland potatos, that seemed to have just been boiled and dolloped with an aioli. We weren't sure if the crab was hiding somewhere in the bland peices of potato, so we started eating it. When we realized it was the wrong dish we notified our waiter, who then accused us of eating all of it already. I was very offended that he would even suggest that. On top of that, the dinner came out to be $65 dollars a person, but when we got our credit card bill we both were charged $69. \r\n\r\nOverall, I still think Limon is worth a visit to try their great ceviches, but a return visit for me is doubtful.

They said that the earliest they could seat us was 8:30 p.m. on the Thursday that we went. All's good.\n\nWe got there exactly at 8:30 with our full party and they said we had to wait because the people at our table got the bill and paid, but were still mingling. They politely asked us to sit in the window area for drinks...except the entire 15-20 minutes we waited, we never got any drinks and never got served or asked if we wanted any drinks. Kind of lame and a bummer.\n\nDo they not serve good bread here was was it just bad luck for us? The bread came out in warm plates, but the bread was completely cold and was something you could get at a crap chain restaurant. At least the sauces were interesting and tasty.\n\nAside from the wait and the bread, everything else was pretty delicious and great! My boyfriend and I shared the tabule appetizer with quinoa and other veggies. It was cold and I liked it; my boyfriend thought it was ok; he was expecting more veggies than quinoa. We shared our two entrees, the red snapper and the ribeye (cooked medium). The red snapper was very crispy and delicious with the curry sauce; the coconut fried rice was also very good with a perfect texture of rice. However, there were only about 6 chunks of meat...sadface. Good thing the entire fish was deep fried; I obliterated the rest of the carcass by eating all the crispy bones and fins, while my friend ate the head and eyeballs. We saw another table get the same dish and they actually didn't even TOUCH the fish carcass/bones. WTF? THAT'S LIKE PRACTICALLY THE BEST PART IF IT'S DEEP FRIED!!!! God, I wanted to slap those people.\n\nAnyhow, the ribeye was tasty; I mean, how can you go wrong with ribeye right? I got it medium because I was told that when you ask for medium rare, it's a little too bloody. Honestly, it was cooked perfect, but I could have had mine just a tad bit more alive. The sauce with it was good and the purple potatoes had a slight crisp.\n\nMunching on others' foods, the lomo saltado (sirloin) had really good flavor; fried sweet potatoes were good; yuko was FANTASTIC (pretty much like a giant french fry and a little bit more fibrous); pork chop was a teeny bit dry but very good with the ragout (my sister ordered this and gave me the leftovers; which I ate the next day for breakfast with rice. DELICIOUS). Everybody seemed very satisfied with their food; I heard the cebiches were awesome too.\n\nAs for drinks, the sangrias were quite tasty.\n\nFor our entire party, our bill came out to be about $480. My boyfriend and I paid $90 altogether (two glasses of sangria, one appetizer, red snapper, and ribeye).\n\nFor the saltiness, the food didn't taste very salty as we ate it, but I realized I had about 6 glasses of water during dinner and when I got home, I was really really thirsty.\n\nAll in all, great place to try and definitely on the pricey side. We don't usually spend this much on dinner (actually, we've never spent this much on dinner). It has fancy decor inside; service is ok (except for the wait and the not-serving-us-drinks-while-we-waited thing); food is quite, quite good. I'll definitely come back; maybe in half a year when I have the money to splurge.", "author": "Angela H."}

We were seated upstairs in the back which quickly became packed with people.  The Sangria was excellent.  Started off with the tuna and chicken appetizers which were also excellent.  I thought we were off to a great start but then I received my entree.  I got a dish that is considered, according to the restaurant, a signature peruvian dish.  It was ok.  It was beef mixed with tomatoes, onions and fries - thought that was a little odd, and some rice on the side.  Kinda disappointed and wished I would have ordered more appetizers instead.  Dessert wasn't that great either.  And then it became so loud in this place I could hardly hear the conversation at my own table.  Overall it was a fine experience - just nothing to write home about.", "author": "Kerry M."}

As for the entree, the waiter had said that they were out of the red snapper, even though the people next to us, who sat down after we did, got the red snapper. Hmmm.  ANy way, after the ceviche, I was in the mood for land animal, and so the duck was perfect. IT was displayed around some starch and spinach. I git it medium rare, and it was tender as hell.

All the food was very good.  One warning: the \"Sashimi\" section of the menu is decidedly Ceviche.  I wouldn't call it sashimi but I love ceviche as well so I wasn't disappointed.  Mom got roasted chicken with truffle mac n cheese.  I don't think any culture in the world handles chicken better than Peru, and Limon is no exception.  The skin was crispy and the meat hot and tasty.  Back to the service: the waiter did not remove any dishes from the table until we were DONE eating.  So rare to see proper restaurant etiquette, and as a slow eater, I appreciate not being ostracized as the only one with a plate.  Water glases were kept perfectly full with no ceremony.  So rare, it seems.  We finished our meal with leisurely glasses of port as he dinner rush started to come in, and the waiter still did not bring the check until we had finished them.  It felt like eating in a laid-back European fashion where the food takes center stage.  2 glasses of $7 wine, a $14 ceviche and an $18 entree and 2 glasses of $9 port and the bill came out to $86 with tip.  I will be back to try the $3 oyster shooters and enjoy the great wine list at the bar.\n\nPS. The bathroom is small but beautiful and nice.", "author": "Lauren J."}

I tend to escape my traditional chicken chow mien to delve into Cebiche and Lomo Saltado. What I found in Limon was americanized Peruvian food.

Normally, I have a high tolerance for a busy waitress or a loud atmosphere, as these don't bother me too much. \n\nLimon, however, tried to kick my party out after 1.5 hours. We were finishing our tea and coffee and the waitress came by and told us that she had a lot of people waiting and asked if we could pay. We gave her a credit card, slightly annoyed but figured we'd stick around for a few more minutes. We got the card back and signed, and then were just chatting over the last of the drinks. At that point, THE MANAGER came over and told us that he had a lot of people waiting and asked us to get up.\n\nAt this point, I was a bit surprised, so I looked at my watch. It had been an hour and a half, so I asked him how long the average table stayed. To our surprised, he said 2 hours. I think he offered to buy us drinks at the bar, but it was hard to hear over the din. Plus, the bar was so crowded that it didn't look too fun to hang out and stand up packed in, so we left. \n\nOverall, the manager was very rude and it ruined an otherwise decent place.

It was a platter of mixed seafood including, halibut, mussels, calamari, and i think maybe some other thing with suctions on it that I was too afraid to eat. I loved them all because instead of just lime juice and seasonings, this ceviche had some kick to it! I can't handle spicy foods, but it just the right amount of spice to it. And the mussels were the best part of the assortment! \n-Mac&Cheese w/ White Truffles: I'm a sucker for mac and cheese, so when I saw this on the menu, I had to give it a try. It was delicious! I could have eaten a platter of this for dinner! I've had it other restaurants, but this was by far my favorite. It was creamy, but not too heavy and filling. \n-Lomo Saltodo: sirloin with onions, tomatoes, peppers, and fries served with rice. YUM! \n-Picante de Mariscos: sort of like a seafood stew i want to say. The sauce was reallly good- I wanted to soak it all up with bread, but sadly I was way to full.\n\nThe ceviche was impressive, the sangria was sweet and delicious, but the entrees did not stand out.

Ceviche we got tasted like I was eating a lemon the whole time, no seafood taste.  The pork chop I got was not cooked nearly as good as the one at other places, both lacking flavor and tenderness.

I am honestly having a hard time recalling what we even ate, the food was that unmemorable. Ah yes, tuna tartare which boasted pear, red peppers and pine nuts on the menu and yet there was little to no evidence of any ingredient in the dish besides tuna and sesame oil (you want rad tartare, hit up Mezze in Oakland.) Okay, what else? Fennel orange salad, where I tasted no fennel. Un ceviche de corvina that left us saying \"Yep, that sure is snapper marinated in lime.\" There was no hint of chile or onion or any other thing in the dish. My feeling was that it could have been left to marinate another four hours or so, give that fish time to become tender. As it was it was rubbery and sinewy as all get out.  We had a steak and fries dish that was exactly that. There was very little seasoning, very little wow factor in any of the dishes. The food was edible, but not memorable. Too bad because you so rarely see Peruvian food on the West Coast. And as far as I'm concerned with Limn, you still don't. I can still remember the first Peruvian meal I ate ten years ago in New York: it was a quarter of a chicken rubbed in 27 different spices, roasted and served with mashed Yucca. I can remember a bite of a friend's Peruvian seafood stew I had in Brooklyn five years ago the sauce tomato-y and slightly creamy, and the ceviche I ate that night. \n\nThe food at Limn is totally edible, but bland. Also, WTF? We're in San Francisco and the \"house baked\" bread they serve is glorified Wonder Bread instead of Sourdough? Given that nothing else seems to be muy authentico at this \"Latin Fusion\" restaurant, why'd you bitches have to go and give us lame bread? Raw deal.  The clientele were mostly business men and tourists, and their elderly mothers. The table next to us were three loud gay youngsters and their raucous gal pals, who were all texting and talking on their cell phones throughout the meal. Limn struck me as the sort of place a person goes when they want to go for \"Ethnic Food\" minus the  whole Ethnic part. It's like how you'd make Peruvian food for a picky five year old. I think they get away with this mostly because there's no other competition around/basis for comparison.  I gotta go check out Mi Lindo Peru next, see what's up. \n\nService was okay. Our server was nice, but not particularly concerned one way or another whether we were enjoying our meal. Definitely had a turn and burn kind of feel to it, like we were taking up valuable real estate. Save your hard earned ducats and go elsewhere friends.", "author": "Sara L."}

So that was disappointing.\n\nDuring out over 45 minute wait for the table (let me state again reservations were made well in advance) they did not even offer a complimentary glass of wine or water.  \n\nI overheard the manager (or someone in charge) say to another party that there was problems with reservations showing up but not being on the book....ummm, those are called walk-ins last I heard and tables with reservations should not be used for them.  Perhaps they can wait 45 minutes.\n\nWe finally got a seat, but a b-day party with reservation had to eat at the lounge area because of Limon's inability to understand reservations and \"restauranting\"\n\nThe new staff is new and needs someone to get in there and show them how to run the show!\n\nOverall I would go back, but be prepared to wait....\n_________________________________\nYum, yum, yummy, yum yum!\n\nWent here for dinner on a weeknight (so thankfully not too crowded) and the food was awesome.

I've tried a variety of their ceviche and they've all been so fresh and light. The ceviche mixto is a good blend of fish, calamari, and shrimp. This one is a must have each time we visit Limon.  Each bite is so full of flavor, a mix of citrus, onion, and their \"milk of the tiger\" marinade.  I also like the pieces of corn that come with the ceviche.  I have also tried the tuna tartare and shrimp and mango ceviche.  Again, so delicious, you can easily get 2-3 different ones to share.  On to the hot plates, I love the empanadas. We tried the beef and onion one.  The outside is light and crispy and the inside is a warm blend of meats, onions, and eggs.  It did not feel heavy at all.  For our entrees, we had the mixed seafood paella and the lomo saltado.  Both were delicious and very classic dishes.  I preferred the paella more because I loved the seafood medley.  The food here is always good, but personally, I felt it was better before they shut down due to the fire.  I think they've gone down slightly since the reopening, which is why I am giving them 4 stars, rather than 5.  Also, it does get kinda noisy inside, especially if you sit upstairs.

The hostess greets you with a smile and seats you promptly. This place is usually happening, and even the bar is full of patrons, as walk-ins are very common. Because of its prime location on 16th and Valencia (right in the mix of all the cool bars and restaurants), it's very conducive to getting walk-ins, as people peer through the windows and they see the delicious plates of food tempting them to come inside.\n\nOur server was very knowledgeable and friendly. I really like it when I can talk to my server and feel very comfortable with him and be able to ask him questions about the menu and know that he's going to give me an honest answer. Because I've been to Limn several times before, I have a certain level of expectation, which they always seem to meet or exceed every time I go. \n\nThe food is really the main thing that keeps bringing me back. We started with an order of the calameres fritos, which came out perfectly golden and delicious. The chipotle aiolo sauce that was drizzled on was just the right amount of heat and complemented the dish very well. It was a good portion, and we even had leftovers to take back with us (very uncommon at a nice restaurant). \n\nNext, my main course arrived. I ordered the deep-fried red snapper, which is presented in the most creative way you could ever imagine. They remove the meat from the bone in small cubes and fry them separately. Then they take the whole bone and fry it. They replace the cubes back on the bone, which is in this \"U\" shape that holds the fish meat in place. This is so great, because you don't have to work at getting the meat out like you usually do when you order a whole fish on the bone. The fish was so flavorful, and it came with two sauces that were the perfect complement to those golden delicious nuggets. One was a rocoto (a hot bell pepper from South America) curry sauce, and the other was this light and sweet sauce that was drizzled next to the fish. It also came with a side of coconut fried rice with almonds that was to die for! It was stir-fried and it perfectly complemented the fish with all the right flavors blending together in your mouth. There was also a little side of baby spinach for some color and a veggie to complete the dish. I have to say that this is probably one of my favorite dishes EVER!

Ok. The food started to come out (before the drinks). Tuna ceviche. The tuna was really mealy. It had a very tough and chewy texture which didn't make a great impression. The flavor was fine, but it paled in comparison to, say, La Mar. The veggie empanadas were fine. Nothing special, but fried to an appropriate crispiness and tasty. Finally, we had the seafood boullaibase, which looked great but had an odd stench and flavor, almost as if it were a bit past-date.

Certainly below par.\nFood was acceptable, though nothing we will be back for (too many good restaurants in the city to enjoy).\nAmbiance gets a solid D. We unfortunately had the misfortune of being seated in the upper section. The HVAC kinks (maybe this why there originally was a fire?) leaves it far too hot and stuffy. With a low ceiling on the second level, if it is even half full the noise level will be absolutely brutal (they haven't put anything in to help dampen the sound, and as a result the setup really ruins an otherwise mediocre dining experience). \nSit on the main level, or don't bother.

Halibut ceviche was quite tasty and not overpoweringly citrusy, but the scallops with seared fois gras and fig reduction, wow! I think I finally met my match in the richness department. Ok, well, I ate the whole thing myself, but didn't need an entree afterwards. Better shared, but a decadent meal for one if you can handle it. \nI've heard a lot of reviews of bad service at Limon, but I've always been well attended to there. The tables are too small, which leads servers and bus-people to constantly be re-arranging plates, glasses, candles, flatware and the like, but I find it almost comical. They need bigger tables.\n\n*********************************************************************\nSlid into Limon at 1050pm Saturday night with no reservations. I love going late to places to avoid the crowds and need to make reservations, but it only works well if restaurants give quality service toward the end of the night. There were no problems with service at Limon, the fleet of people pouring us water, bringing our food, taking our order, etc were all nice. It was refreshing to see the people in the open kitchen smiling as they worked too. \nIt was a hot night and we weren't initially attracted to anything on the menu except for the ceviches.\nEnded up getting the shrimp starter which was tasty with a decent portion, a ceviche, a raw tuna starter (a little redundant after the ceviche), and the pechuga de pato (duck breast). The duck confit potato gratin was super tasty and the duck was also really good. The ceviche was made of top quality sea food, the squid and octopus were actually tender. I'm interested in trying some of the creamier ceviches, b/c I've never had anything like that, but yeah, the duck, made me want to return.", "author": "Candice L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-08", "description": "We get seated on the 2nd level, overseeing the restaurant and all its inhabitants. We quickly order a pitcher of Sangria, the ice cold fruity wine drink popular in its native country of Spain and all other Spanish restaurants... another curious item on the menu of this Peruvian restaurant. In my brief research on chowhound and other assorted websites I repeatedly see the suggestion to order the combination ceviche. The CC is a choice of 4 ceviche's out of the restaurants 8. The ceviche on the menu is split into normal \"limon\" ceviche and cream based ceviche. Since I am one for equality and fairness in all aspects of my life, I ordered two of each.\n\nBeing the fatties we are, my friend Ryan and I ordered the fried chicken appetizer (Chicarron de Pollo) to go along with the meal. He (not I) figured that the platter of ceviche would not be able to satisfy our hunger, especially when its shared among a party of 9. Now you know I love fried chicken, but I'd consider this more as pan fried chicken with absolutely no batter. But the chicken was extremely soft and tender and very meaty. Imagine crispy chicken at your local Tapioca Express but with no batter. Of course the best part of this dish had really nothing to do with the chicken, it was the dipping sauce they provided. If you've been to El Pollo Loco and you've had their house salsa, this is what its richer more endowed older sibling would taste like. Since I love El Pollo Loco as much as I love Chick Fil -a (RIP) I found this sauce amazing. No one else seemed to share this enthusiastic joy with me, but when did I care about other people's opinions (just kidding).\n\n(by the way, i love sliced red onions, i love them so so so very much. Especially if they are a little sour with marinade? Man oh man)\n\nathy's choice was inspired by what I had ordered at the Peruvian restaurant a few months ago, essentially steak and fries, Lomo Saltodo. This version of the dish is significantly less oily than the one we ate previously. The beef is also of finer quality (since the dish is nearly 3x the price) , it might actually be steak opposed to just some sort of beef chunk. But I'm not sure why I liked the other version so much more. I think the oiliness and the grease really brings out of the flavors! I also think they didn't cook the tomatoes long enough at Limon because I was expecting a hint of tomato behind every bite.. which didn't happen (/tear!).\nI took pictures of the other items that were ordered but i didn't really have an opportunity to try them. So i'll give you the people's impressions.\nChurrasco a la Parilla, Very simple steak, nothing to write home about. Like a majority of restaurants when a medium rare is requested.. it comes as medium. But from my own personal view, they did a very good job with the grill marks! Look at how defined and pretty it is? This steak should be a professional steak model. \"What's for dinner? Beef.. *cue steak from limon with its pretty grill marks*\".\n\nVegetable Risotto. I had an opportunity to take a bite of this. Nice crisp vegetables in the risotto. Good creamy texture for the rice, but it seemed a bit too sticky. I like mine creamy yet not so clumped together. The green sauce was a vegetable puree which added a lighter flavor to the risotto. I've had better.. or i will have better (hint of what's to come!).\n\nWould i go here again? Probably not... considering i have a hankering for cheap Peruvian food. There are so many other restaurants to explore in San Francisco, so not coming back here will definitely not be a loss. But i am kind of surprised at the amount of people that suggested this restaurant to me. My food was good, but the overall experience or the QPR (quality price ratio) just wasn't there.", "author": "Charlie F."}

While I definitely think the food is great, I just don' t think it's that much better than other peruvian joints where you don't have to wait as long or spend as much. Plus their menu is pretty small. Last time we went the waiter told us to order apps because the food would take 40 minutes. Since it was a Sunday and not terribly crowded I asked why that was. His response was that it's always like that, regardless of the crowd. To me, that means they are creating a situation where we are forced to order apps or go hungry. Even though they can easily do something about that. Bad, bad Limon!!", "author": "Riz N."}

(almost 3 times if i got there on time because of critical mass!) both times have been really really good.\n\ni just recently came back from a trip to peru and this place is like gourmet peruvian food. i had peruvian cravings for such a long time and this is the place i went! SOOO happy to go.\n\ni totally recommend the empanada, lomo saltado, and any ceviche. i felt like i was back in peru, if only for like an hour and half. their chicha morada (purple corn sweet drink) comes out in the same cup their cocktails are in. i was so happy to get a drink since you can't get this anywhere in the bay area (well i haven't really looked).\n\npeople say peruvian food is one of the best south american cuisines because of the influx of different cultures into the country. everywhere i went there was japanese and chinese food (chifas), so it seems like their food has an infusion of so many tastes. another reason is their accessibility of different types of food. potatoes originated from peru (check it out on wikipedia, it's totally true). it's near the ocean and the andes, so you have your meats and seafood. i'm a big peruvian food fan now.\n\nthe only problem i have about this place is that's it's nearly impossible to get reservations or find parking in the mission. it's like you're stuck with a 5pm or a 9pm reservation and once you do have reservations, you need to really get to the mission district at least an hour early. it'll take that long to find street parking if you're not willing to pay 20 bucks for a parking spot 6 blocks away. i suggest BART it or cab it. it's not worth your sanity to drive around for 45 minutes (which i did the second time i went to limon).\n\ni suggest book on opentable, it's great and easy and get there early! i took my friend to dinner here but she was running late. they won't seat you unless EVERYBODY from your party shows up. it there are 8 seats, they want 8 people to show up.", "author": "Ivy C."}

However, for those of us who love salty, spicy, or sweet fatty concoctions adorning our meats, it isn't a problem.  I will say that some things should have been tested before being sent out.  The yucca pure was so salty that I think it gave me premature heart disease.  Padma would have definitely sent that stuff back.  The ahi tuna poke on the other hand was beyond my expectations.  The service could have used some help given that nothing came out in the order they said it would, and on several occasions they tried to bring us dishes that were meant to go to other tables.

Our family of 4 enjoy eating out and trying different food .... it was our first time to try Peruvian food.... food was delicious and flavorful but not sure if this is what the authentic Peruvian food taste like as it seems to be more of a modern flair.  We had an annoying experience with the hostess (pretty, chubby with curly long hair).  We got there around 5:15p for an early dinner.  We were asked if we had reservations and we did not.  We were asked if the 4th person joining was just parking.  We told her he's on his way.  She responded that we had to wait.  The restaurant was practically empty at that time with only 3-4 tables occupied.  So that was annoying but that was not the worse part.  She finally decided to seat us but she seated us on the far end right beside the bathrooms.  I asked nicely if we could have one of the tables that were empty.  She answered abruptly that this was the best she can do for us and that she might need those empty tables to be combined for big groups later and walked away.  It took a good ten minutes before the waiter came.  By then, i was already annoyed and decided to leave.  One of the managers asked if everything was okay and i told him no and explained the seating problem.  The gentleman was kind enough and told us we can sit anywhere we want and we did.  Guess who the hostess seated on the table by the bathroom?.... a group of Chinese ladies.  Hopefully, it was just a coincidence.  In addition, by the time we left 2 hours later, the 2 other tables i had wanted to sit were never occupied.  I explained to my teenage kids that as a paying customer, it is our right and privilege to speak up.  And that if the place was super busy and that was the only table available and you really want to eat there, then we have the choice to take it or leave.

Our very friendly and helpful waiter rushed our order in before the kitchen closed.  We ordered various cold and hot small plates.  Maybe because of the rush, or because I had in my mind Limon's inventive combinations of earlier days and I didn't choose carefully, I was very disappointed in the food.  Everything was fresh, but all the hot dishes were fried and dry, with boring dipping sauces and goopy shredding cabbage and/or some grated carrots as the only vegetables.  Ceviche was fresh, but not a vegetable in sight - just rather large slices of fish.  The Peruvian salad was swimming in a goopy creamy sauce, and not at all refreshing as I had hoped.  I'm so disappointed, as the place has such great energy, full of people having a good time, but not so loud that you can't have a conversation.

I've been to Peru over a dozen times (mom was born there), so I'm pretty familiar with the delicious cuisine the country has to offer.  Limon did a real good job of replicating the cuisine.  Started off with the ceviche platter and had arroz con mariscos as my entree.  Both were outstanding, the arroz con mariscos in particular.  I just wish the portions were a little bigger.  It did takes us a long time to get our entrees.  The bar area is really small, so it's an ideal place to wait unless you can snag a chair.  Also, the place does not serve hard liquor so you can't experience the national cocktail, the pisco sour.  Good selection of peruvian beers though, which are really underrated.  Cusquena & Pilsen...mmmm.  Try one!", "author": "Mike I."}

Van Ness because it is consistent and friendly.\nWe were seated upstairs and waited at least 15 minutes before a waiter approached us. Obviously, they don't have enough staff to provide service. Our food was brought to us approximately 10 minutes after the table that arrived  after us was served.  We ordered seviche, grilled octopus the quinoa salad and the steak. The best dish was the seviche. All the others were incredibly over salted and unremarkable. The octopus was 4 small pieces of  huge tentacles and was tender but not of the highest quality. Try the grilled Octopus at Kokkari if you want \nto enjoy top notch grilled octopus. I have to add that we love octopus and have grown up eating. \nGiven that service was practically non existent we decided to skip dessert. \nAll in all this was a very stressful experience for us. \nMy suggestion to the owners is that they work on their over salting and \ntheir staff problem.

He just smiled and simply asked us if we were ready for the check because they needed the table, I will never go back there again and I will tell my experience to all my friends...  As a courtesy of all of you my Yelp fellow friends, Don't let this kind of  improvised restaurants surprise you...

Great vibe.  Waiters were very polite and attentive.  \n\nWaiter recommended the ceviche platter, which consisted of 4 different types of ceviche, which we enjoyed greatly.  Especially the halibut ceviche limon, which was top notch.\n\nNext, we had the sauteed scallops were topped with foie gras.  Scallops were cooked perfectly and the foie gras added a nice deep, rich, buttery flavor that did not  overwhelming the flavor of the scallops.  \n\nWe then split a pan roasted chicken breast with a side of truffled macaroni and cheese.  The chicken was flavorful, moist, and seasoned very nicely, but ultimately forgettable.  However, what really made the dish memorable was the truffled mac and cheese which was absolutely fantastic.  The flavor of the truffles added a richness and depth that I have never experienced in a mac and cheese;  we devoured it completely, then used the side of bread to mop up the sauce afterwards.\n\nLimon is a great restaurant, that I would definitely go to again, if I were in a mood for ceviche or a nice sangria.

While their food was good, something was lacking that I can't put my finger on.\n\nNoise: Loud. We sat upstairs, because they said it was quieter, butit was still loud, so I don't want to imagine what it was like downstairs. The tables, while modern, cool, and made of wood, are too deep, so my friends and I were leaning uncomfortable over it to try and hear each other talk.\n\nService: Good, but not super fast. Our dinner lasted 2.5 hours. Now don't get me wrong, I love long dinners, but I feel a place like Limon shouldn't take that long.\n\nFood: Fairly good. Nothing amazing (that I would go back for). For an appetizer we shared the calamari. It's OK... it smelled too much like sea food, and they over-used a spice making it overpowering. For a main course I got the Lomo Saltodo... Top Sirloin. It's good and the sauce is great, but there's not enough steak. It's mixed w/ fries, onions and tomatoes and served with a huge side of rice (which I think was unnecessary b/c of the fries). My friends got Picante de Mariscos and the Parihuela, both were a seafood melody, both very good. Sauces were great. For dessert we got the flourless chocolate cake and tres leches. Both great, although the tres leches isn't super traditional b/c the cake is a little more dense than usual.", "author": "Sarah K."}

I went with 3 others and was seated next to a walk way between our table and the bar.   We had a hard time enjoying our table conversation because we were literally sitting down in a heard of people getting beverages at the bar and waiting for tables.  Not a bad view really when I had a chance to turn around now that I think about it.  Perhaps they could use a little more control / authority at the door to keep the main floor open?\n\n The big shock  came when the waiter wouldn't accept our order unless we ordered everything at once.  My GF was very disappointed as we were really looking forward to eating at here.  Waiter (bouncer ?) guy informed us that Limon did not allow patrons to order in courses or a few dishes at a time.  We pushed back on this rule quite hard; however, he was adamant that Limon's policy was that we'd have to order (tapas!) all at once.   Of course, in informing the table about the policy the waiter was unapologetic, caustic, and snooty.  WTF.  Why not just tell us how quickly we need to wolf down our grub before you're going to take our plates?  Why even bring food to the table when you can charge by the song like a strip club?  Anyway, after this terse exchange it didn't really matter much what came out of the kitchen because apparently we weren't having a meal.

They could place a door at the sidewalk to make an airlock, which they said they plan to do, but since they've been there several years what's stopping them from getting on with it?\n\nNow the really bad news.  We watched several people come in, order, and eat while we  were waiting for our lunch.  Some even eating the same things we ordered.  The host noticed this, as did the waiter.  Both said that they'd take care of the problem.  Minutes, promised by the host, turned into another 20-30 minutes. \n\nI can understand that if you eat out regularly that your order is going to get lost.  What I can't understand is why they can't take care of it in the bill.  Their response was to give us deserts we said we didn't want, which included ice cream which they knew my wife couldn't eat.\n\nThe food was good but not worth waiting, in the cold, for close to an hour.

Seafood is a good tester when trying out a new restaurant, and they passed with flying colors. The Calamares were tender & light without being greasy. The Ceviche is one of the most unique I've ever had, making my taste buds zing with fresh halibut, mixed seafood marinated in lime juice, and served with yam, Peruvian corn and mussels in a salsa criolla. The vegetable Risotto special of the day was my favorite of all. It was topped with a Sage cream that tied all of the flavors together. If this wasn't enough, we shared a Tres Leches for dessert.

Well I was there on saturday 4th, the place was packed! Servers and managers dutifully running left and right, up and down, trying to accommodate demanding customers (my friends and I included).\nThe day was warm enough so we started with cocktails and ceviche (sorry, Peruvian beer doesn't do much for us) and we were impressed with the quality and boldness of the flavors. The Tuna Nikkei and Shrimp ceviches are the bomb!\nOne of my friends at the party (Peruvian born) often criticizes its native cuisine but even him was trying to lick the plate up. We move to the Choros Limon and the Chicharron de pollo. The smokiness and spiciness of the mussels married beautifully; it was a better marriage than the one the Clintons have, hehe just kidding. But seriously, we could not get enough of the flavors and the crispness of the chicharron di pollo. \nThere were four of us sitting close to the main door, you could see people waiting and we figure, they must know how popular this place is if they are willing to wait. \nMore cocktails and then we had empanadas (both veggie and beef) and decided to share some entrees.\nThe lomo saltado with the egg on top reminded me of the american steak and fries with a certain asian twist. We also had the quinnotto which was good, I certainly enjoyed it and I think it is a good vegetarian option.\nOur server was busy but she was trying to make us feel good so, points for her good attitude!\nTheir chimichurri fries are awesome, how do they do that?\nI have been to this restaurant with my girlfriend before and they keep having a balance, consistent menu.

Thank god Jonathan convinced me to look one more time.  I had my first taste of ceviche in this place and I must say they had instantly made ceviche a favorite dish. I got the platter with 4 types of ceviche, 2 with the creamy sauce and I don't know what else was on the rest but they were all delicious. I agree that you must have sangria, it makes it all an experience.  Also had the calamares fritos and that was good too. Ultimately, I give them the 5 stars for the great service. We came on a busy night (must not have been that busy because there were no lines as everybody described but it was still a full house), and we were seated immediately and on the second floor too. We had a view of the kitchen, which at first I thought would completely gross me out since I don't really like watching people prepare my food (I have illusions of them coming from the food fairy) but it just got me hungrier and more excited for my food. Although it's in Mission it attracts quite the hipster crowd which I am not really into but I'd totally come back for more ceviche. Umm... now I want some =)", "author": "Chriselle R."}

Made early reservations on a weekday for a friend's birthday and it took over an hour for the food to arrive, this included an hour for the ceviche to arrive and another hour for our dishes to arrive. The ceviche was good, but the lomo saltado dish was over salted. How salty was it? I kept looking for the tomatoes in my dish to relieve the saltiness and I asked for water twice. I remember going to limon when it was a little hole-in-the-wall mission spot. The food back then was memorable, now that the restaurant has expanded it has sadly lost it's magic for me. My friend, a true tres leches aficionado ordered that as her dessert, and was also unimpressed. She claims that the tres leches cake was nowhere near as good as the one she tried from Dianda's bakery(they have a tres leches with fresh strawberries). So limon gets two stars from me: one for the ceviche, the other for it's excellent dessert wines, the wine list in general. Service needs improvement, and food needs to be cooked with some love. I don't mind waiting an hour for great food, but an hour for a mediocre experience? I think in the future I willl check out the other peruvian restaurants in the city.", "author": "X marks the spot .."}

I've been at Limon twice in the last month and I love it.  I finally tried it and I was not disappointed.  I've tried the Ceviche Limon (in Peru, it's called ceviche mixto).  Really good, you can actually taste the lime. And don't forget the drink the lime juice once you're done.  It's called Leche de Tigre (Tiger's mik) because it's spicy, lime-ny and strong so what they do in Peru, is the pour that in a shot glass and you shoot it in.  Once all is in, it'll make you feel like a tiger, will cure your hangover and hey, they say it's a good aphrodisiac!\nThe anticuchos de pollo were fantastic.  The chicken was moist and savory.  It comes with fried sweet potatoes (sooo good!!).  The lomo saltado was good too - just wished the pieces of meat were a bit smaller.  And the Pargo Rojo (fish), oh wow!! What a dish! Delicious. Try it!! The fish is cooked to perfection.  The sauce is is great and the coconut rice is one of the best ones I have had.  If you have space in your stomach, order the Mac&Cheese - yum! For dessert, go with Panna Cotta de Mango.  The profiteroles were good but wish the lucuma flavor was stronger.  Lucuma is a fruit that grows only in Peru and we make dessert of it. \nNext time, I'm trying the Arroz con Mariscos, Tiradito de pescado, empanada vegetariana y Limon Flambee.  Yes! I like it so much I already know what I'm getting next time! \nEnjoy!!!", "author": "Monica C."}

It looked really cool and I decided I would come back and try it out. I decided to bring my parents with me, and we came on a Sunday night. The place was very crowded and loud. Luckily we had reservations. We were seated on the upstairs balcony, away from the crowds. The lighting is quite dim, and candles glow from the tables. My dad ordered a roasted corn soup. It was to die for and I kid you not. This soup was so deliciously sweet it could have passed for a dessert. My mom had some ceviche which was apparently good, but as I don't eat fish, I cannot comment. For dinner I had the roasted chicken with truffled macaroni and cheese. Now as to how puruvian this is, I cannot say, but what I can say is that this was probably one of the tastiest dinners I have ever had at a restaurant aside from Rivoli in Berkeley. The chicken was crispy and flavorful with a delightful sauce. And the truffled macaroni, mmmmmmm heaven. My dad had a dish with french fries and strips of beef. It was really good as well, but I personally would go with the chicken and macaroni. If I go back again, and I most definitely will, I would be hard pressed to order anything except this amazing bird and macaroni. It was just that good.", "author": "Kate A."}

I first went to Limon way back in the day when it was a small operation on 17th and have been hooked since. I went there again last night with three close friends and had an amazing time! For appetizers, we ordered the scallops with foie Gras and the beef empanadas. Both were extremely delicious and just filling enough to leave ample room for the main dishes. I had a nibble of the red snapper and rib eye steak from my friends but can really only give a fair review for my dish - the Seco de Costilla, or the slow braised shortrib served over herb mashed potatoes. Pure Heaven! The meat was so soft it practically fell off the bone and just had incredible flavor. All I know is if I were on death row and asked for my last meal, I would ask for Seco de Costilla. The mashed potato was extremely flavorful and provided the perfect combination with the short rib. Before I finish, I have to also recommend the Malbec on the wine \"by the glass\" list - fruity and went very well with the short rib. Overall, an amazing experience!", "author": "Amyn S."}

The setup of the restaurant is adorable, with two levels and lots of seating. It is slightly upscale and pricey especially for the neighborhood, but we had SUCH a good time, and it is well worth the price. The manager or owner (I'm not sure which)  sat us at our table immediately although we were over 15 minutes late for our reservations. We ordered shortly after and got a half carafe of sangria. Although our appetizers came quickly, the entrees took well over 25 minutes or so to come out. In the meantime we had ordered 2 more glasses of wine, and the manager very kindly comped them and 2 additional glasses once our entrees came. We both ordered the chicken and mashed potatoes, and it was DELICIOUS! The chicken was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were salty and very flavorful. The only thing undercooked was the few pieces of broccoli accompanying the meal. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our experience and will be returning soon!", "author": "Rachel G."}

Looooooonnnnnnngggg story short - we had a reservation at 8:30 for a party of 7 this past Saturday night (8/31) .  Most of us were there early, 3 were about 10 min late, but they didn't seat us until 9. We were forced to stand in the teeny space between the bar and the tables, being bumped into, jostled, etc, and unable to even speak to each other due to the cacophony of restaurant noise. Don't they know if they hung some curtains from the ceiling it would help? Please, Limon management, consult an interior designer and do something about the noise - it's awful.  We got our appetizer at 10, and our food at 10:30. Though since most of our party didn't order an appetizer, they were forced to sit hungry the whole time. No one even bothered to check on us. We sent emissaries up to the hostess several times and it didn't help much.  It was so loud we couldn't even enjoy conversation as we had to shout at each other. It was so cramped, hot, and loud, that when I finally \"escaped\" I felt so relieved - I didn't realize how much tension had built up in my body and my spirit from being forced to stay in that horrible place for 3 frigging hours. Oh yeah, the food was good, and they gave us some free stuff for the wait - it didn't make it worth the LITERAL torture i was put through.  I will never go back again.", "author": "Shelly H."}

It sounded interesting and since I've never had Peruvian/Latin American food, I thought I'd give it a try. I asked my mom to bring me there for my birthday dinner and I've been going there every birthday since. The atmosphere is nice, dim lighting and modern pieces, but it gets really loud and crowded especially at the bar on the weekends. Now onto the important stuff, the food. We ordered three different ceviches, all prepared differently. One word, WONDERFUL. Tangy, acidic, moist and fresh. Be warned, too much of the stuff will leave your tongue feeling fuzzy. I ordered the snapper and it is everything they said on the tv show. First of all, it is impressive to look at, the fish is suspended in air, captured in movement. Not only is it cool to look at, it tastes great! The pieces of fish are cut out for you, so no bones to worry about and it is soft and flaky. The rice that comes with it is made with some coconut milk and some kind of nut but its is super! It has a comfy home feeling and the coconut taste is not overwhelming but just a hint. As for drinks, I'd recommend their sangria and their mojitos are fantastic.

I must have had good karma working for me on my latest visit as I arrived around prime time and didn't have reservations but got seated immediately! The dining room was packed but they had a nice table for 2 upstairs overlooking the main dining floor and kitchen.  The Peruvian fare (steaks and seafood with a latin flair) is well prepared and very tasty.  I'm a big fan of the Lomo Saltado (top sirloin pan fried with tomatoes, onions, and fries) and it appears that everyone else is a fan too, given the number of Lomo Saldados the kitchen was cranking out over the course of the night as I got a bird's eye view of the talented chefs work 10 pans at once.  The empanadas are a definite must for an appetizer (what you eat before you eat, to make your more hungry).  The Arroz con Mariscos (paella) is flavorful and loaded with fresh shrimp, calamari, clams, and mussels, but could probably use a little more rice.  The sangria is good and not diluted, so drink up!  For dessert, I recommend the Budin con manzanas y coco, which is like an apple bread pudding with mango and coconut ice cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-09-03", "description": "I had my birthday dinner at Limon based on all the glowing reviews. I don't know if they were having an off night, but I did not have a  good dining experience. There were 5 of us dining at 8 PM on a Sunday. \n\nWhen we sat down, we ordered a pitcher of sangria ($30). When the  waiter returned 15 minutes later (without our sangria), we ordered the ceviche platter ($24) and tuna tartar (I think around $13) to start. I ordered the chicken with truffle mac and cheese ($20) and my friend ordered a seafood dish with  Peruvian sauce ($22). Three people ordered soup and salad, which they specified very clearly three times that they wanted served as an entree, since they had been eating appetizers at the bar prior to our arrival. The waiter stated that that would be fine. \n\nThe soup came out first. Unbelievable, considering how many times it was  stated that they wanted it as an entree. They told the waiter that, and he said, \"Oh, sorry. Can you eat it now?\" So, they just ate it then, even though that meant that two of us would be eating alone later in the meal. Next came out the salad (again, unbelievable, since we had shown our displeasure with the soup coming out early). When we said something about it, the waiter argued back, saying that these were appetizer dishes, so they had to come out first (huh? they can't be brought out later?). Both the soup and salad were mediocre, certainly not worth their price. At this point, we asked where our sangria was, and it was brought out. \n\nThe ceviche came out next (which we had wanted first). This was the highlight of the meal. Very tasty. Made me want to experiment with making ceviche. However, again the service ruined our experience, as the platter was literally whisked off the table by the busboy with my friend's fork poised above the corn, about to take a bite. Completely blatant. So, next my chicken appears, along with the tuna tartar!!! I was incredulous. I said to the waiter, \"Excuse me, but I am not really into eating tuna tartar alongside my hot chicken. I also would like  to eat my entree along with my friend's entree (the seafood dish)\", since the others now would not have soup and salad while I ate as planned. He very begrudgingly took my chicken back  to be  kept warm. He definitely made us feel we were high maintenance and a bother, which became the focus/tension, rather than my birthday. We aren't really the kind to make waves, and we were uncomfortable with the situation. We did feel, however, if you are at a fairly expensive restaurant, that the meal should be served as specified, and this  was exceedingly bad service. The tuna tartar was not my favorite. Doesn't hold a candle to the tuna tartar at Yabbies (YUM). But it was fairly good. \n\nFinally, my friend's seafood dish was brought. I had to remind them that my chicken was  still being kept warm, and that was brought. At this point, the manager stopped by our table to ask how things were going. We explained the situation, and to his credit, he  sent us a half pitcher of sangria on the house. \n\nSo, two of us ate entrees while the others sat idly by. The busboy had cleared their plates, and it was a bit awkward. The chicken was mediocre, in my opinion. Very dry (this may have been from keeping it warm, though). The truffle mac and cheese was divine, though! If you go there, order it as a side and skip the chicken. But the topper of the service fiasco is that my friend's dish was not what she ordered! She told the waiter and he acknowledged he had made a mistake, but he literally said, \"Oh my God, after everything. They are going to kill me. (yes, he said that). Can you eat it, please? It's very good. I think it's better than what you ordered.\" He begged her, and she actually consented and ate what was put in front of her, the seafood and rice dish, which she said was definitely not worth $22. \n\nThe manager, knowing how sorely disappointed we were in this disastrous- and expensive- meal, sent me out a dessert (some sort of cake with caramel sauce) with a candle on the house. That was tasty. When we left, he was apologizing profusely (as well he should). But I wouldn't go back or recommend Limon to people, because the poor service will overshadow any gastronomic enjoyment, and I found the dishes to be hit or miss, and overpriced for what they offered.", "author": "M E."}

We had a big group of ten of us, so I know that can be tough, but it's big enough that it should have been accommodating.  We had a reservation, showed up on time with our full party together, and still weren't seated for 30 minutes.  After finally being seated, we drank some wine and ordered food.  We waited literally for over an hour before we received something other than bread.  With empty stomachs, most of the table was pretty much done drinking by the time we were served.

We thought parking would be a pain, but luckily, we got rock star parking and hardly had to look at all.  No wait, but we had reservations.  My only big qualm about the place was the table we were at.  It was near the front by the windows.  This little corner kind of table that looked like it should be a table for one, but they just stuck a chair on the corner of it to make it a table for two.  The fella kept getting his chair bumped into by people coming and going from the neighboring table.  The service was pretty quick and they were friendly - a definite plus.  I loved the atmosphere.  It was very lively and PACKED for a Thursday night.  We started off with glasses of sangria.  We contemplated getting a pitcher, but didn't think we'd be able to finish it.  Skipped appetizers and went straight to the main course.  I had the Churrasco a la Parilla (grilled 12oz. ribeye steak with roasted red potatoes, grilled vegetables, and chimichurri mustard sauce).  My steak was sooo good!  Very filling though.  I couldn't finish it.  The fella had the Arroz con Mariscos (clams, scallops, mussels, shrimp and calamari cooked with saffron rice in a pepper shrimp sauce).  I tried a little bit of his and it was really good too.  Of course, afterward, he was wishing he had the snapper - it looked yum!  We saved a little bit of room and split dessert.  I can't for the life of me remember what it was (and it's not on their website!) but I'd definitely order it again.", "author": "Kris L."}

The restaurant didn't disappoint.  For starters, we had the calamari, fried chicken, and ahi tartar.  Calamari was crisp and the sauce was slightly spicy, but we should have asked for the sauce on the side because they drizzled it all over the plate.  The chicken was off the hook, but avoid the dipping sauce, it was too tangy for my taste.  The tartar was perfect except that 3 chips aren't enough.  We shared 2 Main dishes- the top sirlon steak (medium) and the seafood platter with saffron rice.  I can't say any bad about either of them.  Both were well balanced and not too much of anything.  For dessert, we dove into the coffee creme brulee and chocolate dulce de leche.  Not too sweet and not too bland.  Overall, the prices were fair and I didn't feel cheated.  The sangria is one of the better ones in SF, although don't get carried away at $25 a pitcher.

So you won't find the small plates that are served at the Timo's or Cha (3x) of the Mission District.  Instead, the new location of Limon still boasts some of the tastiest Latin American dishes.  For starters, step up to the bar and get your fill on sangria.  One of the sweetest ones I've tasted.  Then begin your food quest with an appetizer. perhaps the Camarones (shrimp) or even a slight twist on a common classic, Fried Calamari.  The sauce has a little, but pleasant kick to it. Order another sangria at this point. Then for entrees. My favorite is the Lomo Saltamo (yikes! can be off on the spelling here).  Top Sirloin mixed in with potatoes and onions.  Dump parts of your bowl of rice and enjoy every little morsel of this hearty plate.  The sole (pan-seared) is quite a treat as well.  Ask for another sangria to wash down the meal.  Finally, ask to see if they have the profiteroles that come with the lucama ice cream. what's lucama you ask?  A peruvian fruit found only in Peru and very sweet.  It's a bit noisy, so don't be afraid to speak up (to be heard).  Polish off your last sangria, and look forward to your next visit.", "author": "Dale K."}

After circling forever for a space, a few of us found yellow 30 minute meters.   The restaurant was pretty empty except for our large party so I thought we'd get quick service and be out in an hour and a half.   Man, was I wrong.  We were there for close to 3 hours...that's 6 trips to the meter.    The food was so-so.  Someone in our group said that the top sirloin was their signature dish, so half of the group ordered it, including my husband.   Sadly, the best part of the dish was not the meat but the white rice infused with saffron.   The top sirloin was not top grade so it was a bit on the chewy side...pretty pathetic if that's their signature dish.  Luckily, I ordered the fish but my 5 year old ate half of it leaving me with the potatoes and spinach to fill up on.   It was pretty tasty though and the 5 year old is a really picky eater so if he liked it, it must be pretty darn good.   The service was so incredibly slow but I can't put it all on the wait staff.  They made sure our water glasses were full and brought anything else (other than the food) we needed quickly to the table.   The kitchen was extremely slow which is worrisome since we were the only people in the restaurant except for another table of 4.   This probably isn't the best place for large groups unless you have time for a long, leisurely meal and parked at a regular meter.", "author": "Christina L."}

I don't know if it's b/c I hyped Limon so much in my head that it bombed, or it really is just mediocre. Hubby and I brought the baby here. We weren't the only people to bring kids, although there's a definite, \"what the hell are kids?\" vibe to the place. If you're young, with a cute purse, expensive shoes, out with girlfriends/friends, and drinking expensive drinks will not bankrupt you, or you have no mortgage, this could possibly be a good place to blow a percentage of your paycheck. Because the atmosphere is urban, bustling, and so so cool. However, if you're born and raised in SF, like my hubby, you could possibly get a sick feeling in your stomache knowing that this same trendiness is gentrifying and overrunning the city with the ever multiplying non native species of  \"urbanians.\" Also, if you have no sense of style, shop at Lane Bryant or JCPenney, like I do, you will feel aesthetically out of place. I am not hatin', I'm just sayin'. I got the coconut rice and fried fish in the basket. The coconut rice was on hit, however, the fried fish tasted similar to how my mom makes hers. You could also go to Pacific Super on Alemany in the Excelsior and pick your own fish and get it fried for much cheaper and get the same food experience. It's not hip and trendy, but its fried fish. w/o the hecka good coconut rice. But after paying close to $100 for dinner, I think I can make my own rice.

We had a group of 12 which can always be tricky, but they made it so easy by giving us a pre fix menu. For $55 we started out with a seafood ceviche that came with roasted corn nuts, followed by the hit of the night which was the most delicious beef empanadas. I think Mark ate everyones left over empanadas. I had the chicken which was like no other chicken I have ever tasted. It was so tender and flavor full and the macaroni and cheese to accompany the dish was orgasmic. Yes you heard me. It was THAT good. Mark had the flank steak which he seemed to devour so I think he liked it. They ended the night with a type of mango flan, fresh mango's and a mango gelato. It was so nice to have something beside your typical dessert on a pri fix menu. It was light and refreshing after a somewhat heavy meal. All in all we loved it. However after speaking with the group, there were more than a few that were popping tums like they were candy. So beware, although the meal is great, your stomach may not agree so much after the fact.", "author": "Melissa P."}

BUT the highlight of the dinner was my friend's dish ... he got the steak ... and the sauce/gravy was amazing. read mark c.'s review (see below) to get his take on it and how his friends dipped anything and everything in it! so good! in wrap up, despite my slight drunkeness, this place kicked ass. i will definately be back and try some other things on the menu. it's also conveniently located to a lot of my favourite mission bars so you can get tanked after your dinner.", "author": "James J."}

Our waiter was a guy who named Mike. He was unprofessional. He should not be working at that nice restaurant. Only one bad person can make restaurant look bad. He was not that friendly. He was just waiting to get his tips. First he added drinks on the bill which we did not have then we asked politely if he could fix it... He didn`t even say sorry. All he said was I will call the manager. Manager fixed the bill. Then when we pay Mike came back with another bill. He could not even explain what is he doing. We were tired, so just wanna get out. We gave him our cards. And he came back with over charged bill... he charged from one of our card over 30 bucks. He didn`t apologize or anything. He took the card back... bla bla bla.  6 people, we all think he is not the kind of guy who can work with customers. We were so patient... ONLY ONE ASS HOLE CAN MAKE THE PLACE LOOK BAD ... we liked the restaurant but definitely not coming back or never gonna recommend to anyone.", "author": "Sassy S."}

No one brought it, they gave us dessert menus, still no Sangria.We opted out of dessert, still no Sangria. Enrique gave us the bill and I was charged for the Sangria which I never received. He asked us to leave.He said he'd take it off the bill and I said no, if someone had brought the Sangria when I ordered it, 15 minutes earlier, we'd be long gone.Someone finally brought it. As it was, we had the table only about an hour and a half.The waiter was apologetic but Enrique's behaviour was unforgivable and he acted like he could care less if we came back! Well guess what, we won't, ever!", "author": "Shelly E."}

We had a reservation, and were immediately seated downstairs.  The wait staff was very attentive without hovering.  For each course, the waiter was always ready to take our orders, and the food arrived quickly, except for a little longer wait before dessert arrived, which was fine.  We all agreed that the portions were plenty. The noise level was low enough for us to very easily carry on a conversation.  One of us ordered the red snapper.  The other three each ordered the chicken with macaroni and cheese.  He raved about the red snapper.  We all raved about the chicken (though a little too much salt) and the macaroni and cheese.  A variety of appetizers were excellent.  The desserts were excellent.  We also had a large carafe of sangria, which was very good (though not the best I've ever had).  We all agreed that it was a wonderful evening, and we would certainly dine at Limon  again, as well as recommend it to others.", "author": "Eddie W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-04-16", "description": "Yum!  Good food and a fun atmosphere with very attentive and super hot waiters (if you like Latin men).  We had a reservation for 7:30 but were not seated until 8pm as everyone has to be present to be seating and parking in that area is super tough.  The lime and orange walls make it seem cozy but it is very loud and could use some fabric or something on the walls to absorb the noise.  There were 4 of us and we shared 3 appetizers of calamari, ok but not too unique or memorable, empanada, very good flaky crust not at all bready we each were able to taste a half since it came with 2 medium sized empanadas they were very tasty & the tuna tartate very good and a big portion but the sesame oil made it pretty rich and I think it would be too salty and richto eat a whole plate by yourself.  For dinner my mom and I had the snapper fish basket.  It was excellent with a unique presentation and the fish and coconut rice were very tasty.  My brother had the lomo not a very big portion but the meat was tender and marniated in delicious spices.  My dad had the mixed seafood with a sauce and he liked it.  The wine list is pretty pricey (the chepaest bottle with $40) considering the cost of entrees but we brought our own wine & paid the $15 corkage.", "author": "Melanie -."}
