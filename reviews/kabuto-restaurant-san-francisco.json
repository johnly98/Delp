When my girlfriend proposed this place for dinner I was hesitant as its so far away from the city, but I need to keep an open mind - after all Wako is somewhere nearby too. \nSo we arrived here on Sunday night, at 7pm with no reservations - got seated at the bar.\nThere is omakase menu for $90 per person- 2 people minimum. Argh! I can't come back to dine alone, which I love! \nThe special a la carts menu, the daily special menu. \nI got the wagyu tartar with the quail egg, and the wagyu dumpling with foie gras, bonito sashimi, Hotate sashimi, and ceviche. \nMama Mia! So good! \nI can't wait to go back to San Francisco to eat here again. Reminded me a lot of dining in Tokyo with all the decadent rich dishes. \nThe interior is unassuming, a bit crowded, service felt a bit rushed. \nBut if you can close your eyes on that, and just come with a curiosity for the food - you will be delighted.

Scale 1 to 10, I give theit 7.5 to 8 (10 is for Jiro only), if consider about the price, then maybe 7 to 7.5.\nAs a sushi lover who have been experienced several Michelin star sushi restaurants in both United States and Japan, I would say they got pretty great fish and solid skills, but a little bit overpriced. I say there are at least 2 more restaurants in sf I recommend more at this $100 per person price. (Please forget the crazy dragon roll or rainbow roll when we talk about serious sushi.) The old sushi chef is as cold(cool?) as most of these great sushi chef, as what he should be. \nThe only thing I doubt is, why there is no hot towel before the meal?

The Geta is right there. Why not use it for it's purpose? \n\nFood was pretty good but our order of nama kaki(raw oysters) that we ordered 15 minutes before the rest of our food, came out towards the middle of our meal. The oysters were not on the shell but 3 tiny oysters with 1 shiso leaf and a little daikon. I wasn't impressed for the price or taste\n.\nSushi quality was good, very fresh without too much rice. They know how to do sushi well. \n\nService was decent and friendly. Water was never offered even after having much sake.

My 2 pieces of king salmon (i'm guessing about 3 oz total) were $20.\nI also ordered the grilled sea bass about 10 min into our meal. About 30 min later I assumed they forgot about it and we were ready to go, so I asked for the check. Then, 2 min later the sea bass comes out. It was clearly a frozen fish.

Rice is a bit too mushy though he seemed to like it just fine (to be expected given that he's some miscellaneous white guy from the midwest, who has not, presumably, developed the discriminatory taste for that perfect white rice as I have). I did not order enough nigiri to make an educated assessment but the neighbors seemed to be doing the Omakase thing, so I was able to do a visual inspection by proximity. I was impressed enough to want to give it another try when it is not this late. \n\nHe said that he'd often walk by here and found it to be too crowded to come in. So there we were, two hungry people, Friday night, eating, at this seemingly popular spot, finally. \n\nFor an Asian (mostly Chinese, some Korean and a little bit of Japanese), the only things I know how to make are American or northern European food, with the occasional Indian curry (British style) thrown in. Have not figured out how to cook East Asian food, which consists of predominantly Chinese, Korean or Japanese. So much for my heritage food.\n\nTherefore, my enthusiasm for Inner Richmond's Japanese abundance runs high. I liked it. He loved it. It's in his hood.

It's not fancy but does great food need to be?

We were actually very excited to try this place out because of all the good reviews on yelp. We walked in and told the server party of 3. She asked if we had reservation, we said yes but we were late to the reservation. The server directed us to one of the 4 empty tables ( this place is not a big restaurant, when I said 4 empty tables I meant there were only 3 occupied tablets with some scattered guest at the bar). Then an older server form the back stepped in and stopped the server who was sitting out party and spoke in Japanese about the fact that we were late and etc. We explained that we understand and asked if we can be seated as walk-in instead. Again, the older server kept saying we were late and they won't seat us. I mean, come on, less than half of the restaurant was full and they won't seat us? They said those tables were reserved but those guests just haven't showed up yet. So they told us to wait 20-30 minutes by the door and see if those guests will show up. (What? If those tables were reserved, the server won't direct us to seat there). Anyhow we got seated after waiting for about 10 min, we got seated at the table we were originally assigned. After we sat down and for the next 30 min, those tables were still empty!!! Did they want to discipline us for being late even if they have tables available and still not seat is? The first impression to this restaurant was bad! \n\nThe server told us the Omakase set dinner was most popular($80/person). We didn't want to think which one to order individually so we just went with it. \n\nI am not going to comment each dish individually. But I have the say two dishes were worth mentioning 1) the seafood soup is plain miso soup with frozen seafood 2) oysters were not fresh!!! After I ate the oyster, I start to have some cramping, and after cramping for 15 minutes I had to run to the bathroom... (sorry)... bad diarrhea! 30 minutes after I had explosion, the rest of my friends each had to rush to the bathroom for the same reason. \n\nThey kept rushing us to leave even if we still want to order more food ( that set dinner is not fulfilling at all). And once we finished the extra food we ordered, they rush to clean the table when we were still working on the dessert. Come on! It is not like we were just sitting there with empty plates or not eating. Can't they see there are still lots of dessert and we were very busy eating them?! \n\nThe bill.... automatic gratuity 18%... for party of 3....  that was not mentioned on the menu nor anywhere else. We understand for large party, it is automatic... but for party of 3? I felt ripped off. The total bill came to almost $380 for 3 of us. We walked out and told ourselves we will not come back ever again! The food and service do not equal to its price. Food were not fresh and not tasty as it should be, not to mention its service. BONUS: everyone had diarrhea and cramping. \n\nOmakase on townsand street was a pleasant experience and worth for what I paid for.", "author": "Rebegi G."}

The name of this restaurant brought up several times in an eater group, and someone even mentioned this is \"the most memorable place in SF if she moved out of the city\". After hearing a such high review, I decided to give it a try. \nWe arrived on Sunday evening at 7pm. As we walked into the restaurant, all tables were full except the sushi bar. BUT, all customers were white. Not trying to be racist, but if you walk into an Asian restaurant and saw only non-Asian customers, it's not a good sign.\nWe sat down by the sushi bar, at this moment our eyes are at the same level as the glass fish storage thinging (not sure what to call that). The glass was foggy and dirty, which makes the fish look really unappetizing. Waitress then put down the menus, and the menus...were so old and wrinkled which almost tear apart. Omakase is $80/ppl and ONLY serve for 2+ people. My husband refused to order Omakase because the restaurant's appearance, so we made 3 individual sushi orders to try it out, and 2 seafood udon. \nAfter we tasted the 3 sushi we ordered, two were randomly picked from the Omakase menu, and one was Kobe beef slides. They were extremely heavy on the sauce, so heavy that I couldn't even taste the fish or the beef. The most Disappointment was the presentation, the plate was dirty, and you can even see finger prints around the plate, it was horrible and disgusting. Out of all of the sushi restaurants I've been tasted across the world, this presentation was the most disappointed one, especially under such high cost. Udon was salty, I couldn't finish mine.\nThe overall experience was so disappointed, I even wonder if this is the same restaurant that received such high review, or if we being serve the same food?", "author": "Huilin D."}

A bit pricey at $10/piece though\n\n- live scallop. I actually like the scallop concoction inside the spoons better than scallop sashimi (there was a small sand particle in the sashimi, and scallop sushi just taste better than sashimi when the scallop is that tender, in my opinion)\n\nHighly recommend:\nHamachi kama (yellowtail collar, grilled): very tender,  big portion\n\nAll of the sushi were really solid (saroyi, kanpachi, butterfish). Satoyi (a white fish with beautiful grey skin) was quite unusual - would recommend trying.\n\nCeviche: not what you think of ceviche.  More of an innovative halibut roll with a twist. Quite good.\n\nCucumber somonomo: refreshing. pretty good. More of an interlude between the important dishes\n\nso-so (I would avoid)\nChawamushi: I hate carrots in chawamushi.

I passed by this place hundreds of times without noticing it at all, usually on my way to some other sushi spot. \n\nThe place is clean, friendly service staff and great food. \nThe sushi is always super fresh. Kabuto's sushi is traditional for the most part. The chef is very creative however, with tradition it is possible to stray from the common offerings and create something new inline with the tradition. \n\nThat's one of the reasons I like this place so much, I find new and very pleasing items. The freshness of the fish is never compromised. I am a huge fan of the Okra Nigiri. The atmosphere is simple and personal, it's also family friendly.", "author": "Ben M."}

Having been here many times and experienced good service when ordering their dishes, we were surprised at the poor service. Service staff said that another big table came in but many other tables for two or four were being served just fine despite the fact they came in much later.  All we ordered were two simple rolls, two hand rolls and two sashimi dishes. Over one hour and then they were served over twenty minutes apart from each other while many other tables that came after we did were served promptly. Only explanation seemed that the expensive and more lucrative dishes were being served first because we saw all the tables around us being served those dishes in reasonable time.  However, the simple dishes we ordered were put on the back burner. Sad that this restaurant has chosen to put a hierarchy on its clients and does not treat all patrons equally regardless of what you order. We all deserve to be treated equally and not ignored or served last simply because we're not ordering the most expensive items on the menu.", "author": "Nadejda S."}

Food was just dropped to you before you finish so you're forced to shove it in your mouth since there was no space. Food was ok...most memorable flavored dish is the nigiri itself and possibly the lobster sushi. Other than that, I can't remember much of the other menu.

Actually, it might even be my most favorite joints overall.   I came here with my friend around 6 p.m. last night and they have us two menus. One was for dinner, which had the grilled items and entrees, the other was the special sushi menu.  Being like the dorks that we are, we based our order upon the pictures that were posted on YELP.  Oh yelp,, how you complete us! Here's what we ordered\n\n16-20 Kiss -. A sushi with shrimp, avocado and radish with a yogurt sauce. We ordered this, because it sounded interested, of course they worded it better then me.  It had a very soury lemon taste to it. We concluded that it tasted like a Vietnamese Spring roll.  \n\n1949 Oyster-  It had a raw quail egg with tobiko, uni, salmon roe, oyster, and last by not least gold flakes.  You will have to slurp it up to eat this.  Who cares about being a lady or a gentleman.  When it comes to this dish you just need to devour it with all manners set aside. It was the perfect combo that went well with the fresh oysters. \n\nAnkimo sushi- Since the foie gras bans, anytime of pate is good.  The monkfish is as close is i can get to the foie gras. And this dish does justice, it just magically dissolves in your mouth. This will have to be one of my favorite dishes.   \n\nCeviche- This was recommended by the waitress. She said \" did you see the pictures on yelp of our ceviche?\"  She sure knows how to get to the minds of her customers.  This dish wasn't bad if you are into the citrus taste.  \n\nHamachi Pear- This was so delicous! The pear was sliced perfectly, not too thin not too thick, and it went well with the hamachi.  It provided a sweet juicy taste to each bite!\n\nShrimp and crab tartar sushi- This was not bad, it had a good amount of shrimp and crab mixed in.   It was pretty sweet and you can still taste the fresh sea flavors\n\nHamachi Kama- This was grilled well because it melts in your mouth.  The lemon juice more it more moist.  Watch out for bones\n\nUni- although i had a small bite of this. i can tell it was fresh. My friend loved it!! \n\nSave the best for last\nLive Scallop-  If I'm ever stuck on a deserted island i will love to be stuck on it with the chef who made this dish!  words will not do justice, nor will the pictures! This is a MUST have dish!  The prepare it in two ways, The sushi scallops were so fresh.  But my favorite part of this dish was the portion that was served in a spoon.  You eat it like you will take a shot. There was surely a wild party in my mouth after that shot! Next time i am not going to share this dish! \n\nDesserts!\nMacha Creme Brulee- This tasted a lot like the green tea cream puffs from bread papa.  It had a good amount of macha. \n\nMacha Cheesecake- Even if you are not a cheesecake lover, you will love this dish. It wasn't too sweet and they topped it off when red bean paste!  It was so good, i only wished the slice was bigger.  \n\nOverall my taste buds and tummy had a great experience and the serve was really good.  I will highly recommend this place and I will recommend if you have a big party to make reservations.", "author": "Belinda C."}

You can taste the yummy foie gras but it's also sushi.

Scallops served on a clam shell.\nFire salmon roll - this roll comes with more than 2 pieces and the chef sets is ablaze.\n\nComing to Kabuto made me realize sushi, to me, is supposed to a snack not an entree. You order multiple sushi dishes but served in a couple of pieces, that way you can try different kinds of sushi and experience different flavors. Kabuto has fufilled my revelation wonderfully. The presentation of the sushi here is gorgeous as well. It's a hybrid between Gary Danko presentation and Japanese sushi.\n\nDining area is small and cramped and gets busy quickly!

I've uploaded a picture of every single dish we had because well, so I can look at the pictures again and reminisce the best sushi I've ever had lol. \n\nDishes we had in order:\n\n1. Foie Gras Roll - [http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DjDyplmXctMI9gShywcvAg/l.jpg] goose liver. Never had it, thought \"goose liver\" was gross, but omg this was amazing. With the balsamic raspberry sauce and berry on top, it felt like I've never tasted authentic sushi until this. A must get.  It's popular on yelp, it was my favorite dish out of the 10 we got, so trust.\n\n2. Hamachi Pear - [http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AnaB8i-q_C30prEcV4btAw/l.jpg] this was also freakishly delicious, although it was difficult to pick up and eat. Again, the combination they choose to put in this tiny piece of roll, hamachi, pear, and a fruity mustard sauce, all went perfect together to kick in those taste buds and tell them, \"wow, what have I been missing out of my whole life?!\"\n\n3. Live Scallop - [http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WD47kUUawSf0u2J_jHIluw/l.jpg] [http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uDCgT-zr9_bo0qTh5XDqCQ/l.jpg] take it as a shot, or dip the roll in the sauce.  You won't believe how delicious this tastes!\n\n4. Baby Main Lobster - [http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AY6y3IpDCT3vD0edrgbP7A/l.jpg] they seared the lobster and made it a little burnt, but it still was good with the creamy sauce poured on top. Almost all the rolls were displayed beautifully, and this one especially with the lobster tail. \n\n5. Katsunagi - [http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ujlEj_PraST3JmL2xwyl6Q/l.jpg] unagi, avocado, and deep fried katsu.  This sauce was interesting, raspberry miso sauce. Not as sweet as the first in balsamic raspberry, but went well with this fried roll.\n\n6. Sunrise - [http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tCkMDvR6wslY15EfbciNGg/l.jpg] fish eggs and yolk.  You may want to add some soy sauce if you want if you want to add more flavor, but it was still good by itself. \n\n7. Five Salmon Roll - [http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bqkliqSGFqfcmzSAEkgA7A/l.jpg] Bigger roll compared to everything else, and even tasted like the typical sushi rolls you would find in other japanese restaurants.  It was spicy with tiny jalapenos top of the salmon and a sprinkle of cavier.  An OK roll if you want to add a spicy roll.\n\n8. 1849 oysters - [http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-TZGgiLsl5dEELz8l1BK2Q/l.jpg] There's a party in my mouth!! There is so much going on with this oyster piece, egg yolk, edible gold, oyster, fish eggs, and cavier, all in one spoonful. Yum!\n\n9.  Toro Tartar - [http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5PZORXH688o1rkxcU0V8SQ/l.jpg] toro is \"fat belly of tuna\" (yes I looked it up haha) mixed with rakyo onion, avocado, and kabuto tartar sauce and a japanese mint (deep fried shiso).  Delicious as well.\n\n10. Deep fried green tea ice cream - [http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z1hobXIooqzNX8gmypQbig/l.jpg] so interesting!! It's pretty big so you can share. I've heard about this in many other places but never had it and can't compare, but it put the icing in the cake for our meal.  \n\nI kid you not, this was one nice & fancy dinner my date took me to.  It was really amazing and a whole new experience of sushi.  Makes a girl feel special (hint hint for you men out there ;) \n\nThe only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 was with the service and appearance of the menu.  The waitresses weren't patient and friendly at all.  If it's a fancy place, you have to have some hospitality and give people some time to look at the menu, eat, and talk! I also had to ask for a refill for my hot tea rather than them checking up on me to refill, not something I would expect at a nice restaurant like this.  Also, the menu was old, cheap, and dirty with some food stains on it.  Umm.. for the amount that you are charging for each sushi piece, I think you can afford nicer menus #imjustsayin. \n\nOverall, a must-go-to-sushi place when you're in SF. Prices are crazy, $10-14 bucks for 2 pieces of sushi, but I guess you get what you pay for.  Highly recommend Foie Gras, Hamachi Pear, and Live Scallop!

The parking was also as horrible as we remembered.\nWe enjoyed many of our old favorites, and tried a couple of new dishes. One of them was a live scallop special. Although it was nicely plated, the flavors were quite bland. There was a scallop served nigiri style and scallop that was chopped up and served in a creamy sauce. DH didn't think it was worth it for $19.\nOne special item recommended by our server was really good. DH remarked, \"this was the favorite part of my meal.\" This was the sanma, an oily fish served nigiri style. The flavor was unique and it had a shiny skin much like mackerel, but without the super fishy flavor. This particular fish was $4.50 a piece.\nWe got an order of hot soba noodles with tempura. It's a good filler for nine dollars. Tempura was fresh and crispy, the noodles were fine, but nothing to write home about.\nWe also tried the saikyo sushi, which is a bite of grilled black cod in a yuzu kosho gravy, served in a soup spoon. The cod with nicely cooked with a light smoky flavor, however, we did not notice the distinct spicy & citrusy yuzu kosho flavor. Although this was also very nicely presented, it was not one of our favorites at $10 for two pieces.\nWe noticed that they now grate fresh wasbi at your table. This is only two dollars and well worth it!\nThe live prawn was also really good. It was sweet and the texture was crisp. The heads are served fried, much like amebi (sweet shrimp). Not a bad deal at six dollars a piece. And that is the update!", "author": "Kari C."}

I never really had a problem with the process of making Foie Gras.  Actually veal, shark fin or any other food for my consumption.  My best friend is a (ahem) \"animal reseacher\" in fact.  And no, I don't own any pets.  Oh wait, I did have a Nemo (RIP).  But don't get me wrong, I love animals...\n\nSo coming to Kabuto, I was looking at the sushi options and they make Foie Gras sushi.  I thought to myself that I had to try it, who knows, maybe in six months this won't be available.  The menu definitely has unique sushi, here's what I ended up ordering:\n\nFoie Gras sushi: Seared marinated goose liver served with balsamic raspberry sauce.  It's was delicious, too bad Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the ban of this item.  \n\nSonoma Duck sushi:  Duck served with Japanese Spicy Mustard.  This one was ok, don't think I'd order it again.\n\nFor nigiri I ordered Uni, Kanpachi-Yellow Jack , and Hon Maguro-Blue Fin Tuna.  These came in thick slices and very fresh.

I have raved about their sushi. I have recommended them to a lot of people. Unfortunately all good things must come to an end. It really pains me to say but restaurant is already passed its prime. \n\nWhile their menu and decor remained pretty much the same (probably shouldn't), the sushi is merely a shadow of their former glory. For one, the sushi rice served during early dinner time was already slightly dried out. That was quite noticeable even with all the sauce and garnish. Not excusable. \n\nThe lamb on the lamb apple was tough. Sonoma Duck was underwhelming for reasons I can't comprehend. Sammy Roll, CeViChe, Shrimp and Crab Tartare and Ono Grape are still quite good. Valentine was interesting but could really use less sauce. Oh yes, the sashimi on the $20 chirashi really weren't that great in terms of both selection and quality. i would recommend just ordering from their special sushi roll menu.

Hmm, sounds like a girl named Bubbles that I know. This is why I love ordering omakaze in Japanese restaurants. When I came to Kabuto I was determined to not be enabled by the sushi chefs and to choose from the extensive menu myself (well, my friend helped too.) \n\nIt was a challenge; there were a lot of novel dishes and presentations, and two menus: one for dinner and one for 'special sushi.' Everything sounded delicious, and if you don't mind me tooting my own trumpet, I made some excellent choices. Look mom, no omakaze!\n\nAmongst my favorites were the hirame yuzu topped with pickled shiso, and the stunning piri-kara nasu, which is fried and grilled eggplant with spicy miso. I chose to 'forget' that I'm slightly allergic to eggplant, and I am glad that I did so; that dish is amazing. The hamachi pear was unique but I'm not sure if I would order it again; it was a bit too sweet with the fruity mustard sauce on top. Fresh caught abalone should have been cleaned better, and it didn't taste too fresh. Dessert was a generously sized macha creme brulee-not bad. One choice that I enjoyed making was the tea; there are four to choose from and love a great cup of genmaicha with dinner. \n\nKabuto is Japanese for helmet, in particular those wild helmets that samurais wore.  This makes sense when you experience the service; it is curt, rushed, and borderline antagonistic. I didn't mind though because it let me concentrate more on the task in front of me: enjoying innovative and gratifying Japanese food. \n\nThanks, Yelp, for the deal!

Kabuto has it all. We came in here on a Sunday night, just half an hour before their closing time. \n\nOverall, it was a pretty good experience with the sushi we ordered. They don't have much crazy fancy roll, so don't come in if you're looking for that. I usually like my sushi pretty straight and less gimmicky, so Kabuto is the place for me. Service is rather different. They will take your order, but they won't ask you what you'd like to drink. Some of us are very used to getting a cup of tea / water immediately after you sat down, but not here. So then after your food come, then you realized you don't have something to drink. So, remember to tell them what you'd like to drink. \n\nPrice wise is a little above the standard, because remember, you are paying for quality. They also charge their nigiri per piece, so if you're dining yourself, it's perfect. You don't get stuck ordering an order of 2pc nigiri. Then quickly getting full with no chance of trying other fish. At the end of the meal, whether you order dessert or not, they will present a small bite of sweet treat for you.

We made a reservation and our time in the restaurant was appropriate with having ordered two rounds of sushi. It was so delicious that we forwent the dessert to order more nigiri. Lol.

My friend had scallop and even ordered a second round. We definitely splurged on our meal but we didn't really care because it was so delicious.

The food is amazing, and the sushi chefs are really nice (possibly more so than the wait staff - see below).  \n\nWe had a 7:15 reservation, and we were seated shortly after (not a big deal; we had to wait a few minutes as a couple patrons ahead of us were finishing up at the sushi bar).  Although, I was curious why we couldn't be seated at one table that was open and was not being used (which eventually WAS open to another couple).  \n\nThe bad:  After we had been seated, ordered, and settled in, we were asked to get up and move to another part of the bar to accommodate a larger party.  Actually, it sort of felt like we were being told to move instead of being asked politely.  The waitress was not the friendliest (we were waited on by 2 waitresses, this particular waitress was the older one).  When we moved and sat down, I think the sushi chef had noticed what happened... or maybe overheard me griping about it.\n\nThe good:  The food/sushi is amazing.  We had the Omakase menu ($75/person).  It's a little more expensive than the regular casual sushi dinner, but it is WELL WORTH IT.  Don't really want to get into all the details of the individual plates, but each one was delicious (including the desserts).  One of the items was an 8-piece nigiri plate... the fish was so fresh!  Some of the best that I've had.  \n\nThe great:  Back to the sushi chef... he was checking in on us throughout our meal, asking if we were okay and how the food tasted.  When we thought we were about to receive our dessert, the chef stopped the waitress and told him that we had 1 more plate coming out.  My gf and I ran through the Omakase menu and were confused because we had already tried everything on the menu.  The same waitress had brought out the last item which was on the house and the waitress had explained it was due to us having to move to the new seating area.    \n\nI would have given a 4-star review, but the attentiveness from the sushi chef and the staff to go the extra mile puts them over the top.  We were very pleased with the food and that level of service.  We will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Matthew C."}

This is quite a busy route and we must have paused at every bus stop along Geary Blvd. It took a good 40 minutes to get across town. \n\nOur party of 5 had a 7:00 pm reservation. My friends, who drove, arrived 10 minutes before 7:00 pm and were seated within minutes. I was last to arrive at 7:05 pm, just as we were served our first pot of tea. We sat for another 10 minutes with just the tea. We had no menus or wet towels. \n\nEveryone at our table was getting upset as the tables to either side of us were getting service. The servers were literally walking around our table. They were ignoring us like we were all wearing Harry Potter's cloak of invisibility or Frodo's Ring. TIP to servers, please make eye contact with your customers. A simple acknowledgement will go a long way to calming customers upset at the long wait.\n\nAt 7:15 pm, we had enough. A friend and I accosted a server as she finished taking still another party's order. As she started to walk away, we closed in on her from 2 sides. Trapped between the 2 of us, with the sushi bar on 3rd side and the table she just left on the 4th side, she couldn't escape. We asked for the menus she was holding and said we were ready to order. The first time food touched our lips wasn't until 45 minutes after we were seated. \n\nFrom the Special Sushi Menu:\nlamb apple: grilled lamb topped with sliced apple & cherry balsamic sauce\nhamachi pear: yellowtail sushi topped with pear & kabuto fruity mustard sauce\nSonoma duck: barbequed duck served with Japanese spicy mustard\n\nFrom the Regular Sushi Menu:\naji: Spanish mackerel\nasparagus roll\neggplant roll\n\nFrom the Dinner Menu:\nnasu dengaku: fried and grilled eggplant served with miso\nedamame: Steamed and seasoned Japanese soy beans\nchicken karaage: Japanese fried chicken nuggets\n\nFrom the Dessert Menu:\nohagi: rice cake roll covered with sweet red bean paste\n\nFish was extremely fresh and pristine. However, a couple of pieces still had silver skin and a blood line. Their rice was cooked but it was also a bit firmer and drier than I like.\n\nI tend to favor traditional sushi but I really enjoyed Kabuto's fusion cuisine. While the pairings didn't always work, I was pleasantly surprised at the kitchen staff's restraint. They showcased the fish rather than hiding it behind too many sauces and garnishes.\n\nI also appreciated that we could order food by the piece. One of my friends was a sushi newbie and another is allergic to seafood. We were able to customize our meal and everybody got exactly what they wanted. \n\nThe cooked plates were just as deftly cooked as the raw items. I loved the eggplant. Cooked in its skin until the flesh was mush, it was like a savory custard. The miso gave it a hint of salty sweetness. The lamb, chicken and duck were moist and juicy.\n\nWe were stuffed but we couldn't pass up dessert. Asian desserts are an acquired taste but Kabuto's version of ohagi is very approachable to the Western palate. Rice cake is usually heavy but this dessert was light, airy and delicate. Kudos to the pastry cook. \n\nI'm glad we persisted and didn't just walk out. The quality of the food went a long way to mitigating the service missteps. The food was worth 4.5 stars despite the long bus ride from downtown. \n\nThe bill was also a lot more reasonable than I expected. Even with drinks, the bill was well under $100 each, tip included. However, because of the service glitches, I don't know if Kabuto will be a regular stop for us.\n\nConclusion: 4.5 stars for the food; however, I deducted 1 stars for the lackluster service.

So I tend to be extremely picky when it comes to my fish.  I usually just eat sashimi, so my perception of the fish is unencumbered by the rice, or what's in the maki.\n\nKabuto is currently my hands down favorite sushi place in San Francisco.  It is not cheap.  The restaurant is small, and often crowded.  But the fish is phenomenal, both in quality and selection.  The basic fish choices (maguro, sake, hotate, etc) are fresh and delicious.  But where Kabuto really shines is their special selections, like the Tasmanian salmon.  And they often have even more special fish which isn't on the board; though these tend to be extremely expensive, they are always worth the cost.\n\nThere is also a special menu with more haute-cuisine sushi interpretations, like the Hot Apple (hotate nigiri with a slice of apple, served warm).  These are also very expensive, but again very much worth the cost.  I usually get a couple of these, some special sashimi, rounded out with some standard fish.

We proceeded to get the sashimi and sushi sets.  The slices of fish were thicker than they should be and not in a good way.  I'm not one who would ever get sick of sushi but halfway through I felt less and less eager to finish the next piece.  Maybe dinner is when they actually serve their better cuts?  With all the other stellar sushi joints in the area, I most likely won't find out.", "author": "Michele L."}

Although the price is on the high side but you get what you pay for! This place used to be packed on every night but I guess due to the economy not everyone is willing to pay for high quality Japanese food anymore. We came here on a friday night right after they open, by the time we left about 70 minutes later there are still tables left. We ordered the following dishes:\n\nKai Miso: miso soup with clams and they were very good! tho simple to make at home but Kabuto's Kai Miso is one of the best I have tasted so far.\n\nHijiki: AKA simmered black seaweed. Tastes good just like the ones we get at the Nijiya market in Japan town, I think they came from the same supplier so skip this and buy it at J town much cheaper and you get a lot more\n\nSanshu Moriawase: Sashimi combo, came with 2 thick slices of hamachi, 3 pieces of Tuna and 2 pieces of Sea bream. all are very fresh but again you can easily get these at 1/3 of the price at Nijiya market in J town\n\nOden: Japanese hotpot with fish cake, a bit too sweet and salty but totally reminded me of Japan.\n\nTamago Zousui: Egg and rice cooked in soup, kind like chinese porridge and it was great, big enough to share with 2\n\nFor sushi we ordered:\n\nUni, Ceviche, Tamago and Toro Tartar Sushi. THE BEST SUSHI ever! I love Tamago and Kabuto has the best Tamago in Bay Area! \n\nGrilled Lamb Ribs were also good\n\nWe ended our dinner with Chawan Mushi, Japanese style steamed egg with mushrooms shrimp and fish cake. It was not the best ever but pretty good.\n\nTotal for 2 of us (we were pretty hungry thats why so much food) were $88 dollars before tips. Overall a great time dinning here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-11-17", "description": "Over the years, I've driven by Kabuto countless times.  On some of those trips, I was even on my way to eat at other Japanese restaurants.  Places that can't even compare to Kabuto.  And to think, I wasted all that time and gas driving when really, I could have just pulled over, went inside, and eaten some of the best Japanese food I've found in SF.  Dummy!\n\nSo what did fellow Yelp buddy Jenny K. and I order?  Well, quite a bit.  Yet, amazingly, it still felt like it wasn't enough because I wanted to try so much more!\n\n- Toro Tartare - with avocado, pickled radish (?) and a crisp shiso leaf.  I loved the creamy texture, and the flavors were spot on.  Toro is always good, but it wasn't the sole reason why I liked the tartare.  One of my faves of the night.\n- Salmon Tartare - the toro was slightly better, but this one is still good.  If you love salmon, don't like toro, or just want to try both, get it.  For variety's sake though, no need to double up - get the Toro Tartare and enjoy!\n- Ceviche - it's actually a piece of nigiri with a ceviche twist rather than just ceviche.  I liked how it had that tart/acidic flavor, but was mild enough to not be harsh.\n- Sunrise - raw quail egg on a bed of tobiko over a disk of rice, wrapped with salmon.  Delicious, but be careful - it can break apart in your chopsticks, and you'll lose all the good stuff on the way to your mouth!\n- Ankimo (monkfish liver) - good, but standard.  Not really a \"must order\" like some of the other dishes since you can find comparable quality at other places in SF.  Still, ankimo is always good.\n- 1849 Oyster - \"1849\" because of the gold flakes on top (gold rush era), the oyster is topped with uni, quail egg, ikura, and tobiko.  Just look at the picture though...it's gorgeous!  Really good, but it's a splurge at $7 a pop.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7iiWJyo_N5rGz4agqe9EbA?select=u1oRuBEOvOVrsqZ30wrxuA\n\n- Chawan Mushi (egg custard) - loaded with goodies, but it needed more of the sauce/broth.  Pretty solid but next time, I might spend the money on something else and get the chawan mushi at Tanuki instead.\n- Live Scallop - came with two spoons of a scallop chowder, along with four pieces of scallop nigiri.  The bite of chowder was so flavorful, I wish they had given us a bowl of it instead.  I liked the nigiri, but the chowder was the star.\n- Grilled Sea Bass - the only cooked dish we had, and it was terrific.  Perfectly cooked with that buttery flavor...it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  I liked the \"roll\" of spinach on the dish too.\n- Ono (Wahoo) Nigiri - I wanted to try it because I had never heard of Wahoo before.  It was nice - fresh with a subtle flavor.  Can't compare to a good cut of hamachi though.\n\nAs far as service goes, it was just as awesome as the food.  I really appreciated how the waitress took the time to explain the Live Scallop dish too.  The food can get pricey (we ended up paying about $50 each), but you certainly get what you pay for.  Now that I know what to get though, at least I can be a bit more efficient with what I order!  I just regret not getting on that Yelp deal they had a while ago.  Oh well...not like that is going to stop me from coming back again...soon.", "author": "Mike L."}

The sashimi platter was delicious, served with fresh slices of hamachi, salmon, tuna, white tuna, and octopus.\n\nThe live scallop was okay.  It was fresh and sweet.  They cook the outsides and serve it on two spoons with some cream sauce though, which I didn't really like much.  The gyoza wasn't  bad ...with thin wrappers.  The sushi crepe was a little strange to me; it's basically what the name says it is... nothing spectacular though.  The tuna which was drizzled with what I believe was truffle oil was ok also! It was on the specials sign, but I didn't find it super special.  Also tried the soba noodles, which had a pretty good broth.  The salad they serve you with your meal is tiny.\n\nThe desert was good! Green tea tempura ice cream and matcha creme brulee!\n\nOverall,  great experience.  They add a creative fusion touch to their dishes! Not very authentic though, but very fresh ingredients.

That is saying something, when you consider that I lived in Japan for 15 years.  I lived in an area of Japan known for its fresh fish.  I've been eating sushi for a long time--way before it became popular in the U.S.  \n\nWe had an assortment of nigiri--yellowtail, several different kinds of tuna, salmon, toro, and a list of others.  It caught us by surprise.  We read the reviews on yelp and they were very good, but not \"off-the-chart-good\".  I was speechless for most of the meal, except for pleasurable groaning in between.\n\nThat said, the tempura udon my daughter ordered was not good.  The broth was way off, and the tempura was OK, nothing to talk about.\n\nThe miso soup was just OK, I've had better, and I make it at home better.\n\nThe service started out pretty bad.  We had reservations and they weren't ready for us.  We got stuck at a table where you could barely move.  But once I started eating the sushi, everything changed.  The waitress could have seated us on the sidewalk outside and I wouldn't have complained, as long as I was eating that sushi.\n\nI can't speak for anything else on the menu except for the nigiri-style sushi.  If fresh sushi is your target, then you won't find better than this.  \nMy wife and I were talking about the sushi all the way home in the car, and then even when we got home, my wife was asking when are we going back.  Yeah, that's how good.", "author": "Darien R."}

I made a last minute reservation for 4 at 7pm and when the reservation was confirmed, I was surprised to be able to get a last minute reservation. I called the restaurant and told them I made a reservation on Yelp and wanted to confirm. The guy who picked up the phone said the Yelp reservation isn't working but he would take my reservation over the phone. Is this Yelp's fault? I don't know.\n\nWe got there at 7 and saw an open table. The waitress sat us down but after 5 minutes she told us she sat us at the wrong table. It was actually reserved for a table of 5 and asked us to stay put and then move when the other table of 4 opened up. No problem. While we were all waiting (the table of 5 party was hovering over me and even rested his hands on our table and leaned on me). Weirdo. Anyway we moved over to the other table of 4 but they didn't change the paper that was covering the table linen. The couple that just sat there didn't leave a mess so I didn't say anything.\n\nI was overwhelmed by the menu. I'm used to going to places and just throwing orders at the chef or leaving it to the chef. I remember when I came here years ago, they didn't have too many options. The four of us ordered Omakase and a bottle of sake. Everything was good and it was a good value. I didn't leave hungry or overly stuffed.\n\nI won't go into details about the food since there are already so many reviews about it. \n\nI love that they have real wasabi. It's hard to find a place that serves real wasabi in SF and yes I totally judge a place by their wasabi and ginger.

The combinations of their sweet and savory sushi is a great compliment for each other. At first I was thinking, hamachi pear ... really?

The edamame was a bit old, not a nice green, but a darker almost browning green. They are served totally plain, no salt, nothing. \n\nNext was yellowtail with jalape\u00f1o and a small piece of apple. This was pretty good. \n\nAfter that was a series of sushi (nigiri): salmon, seared salmon belly, blue fin tuna, toro, yellowtail, and amberjack. I have never seen such strange cuts of fish for nigiri. They looked like they were pulled off the fish by hand and not cut skillfully and delicately with a knife like I'm sure you've seen at every other sushi joint. The cuts were much thicker than usual, which normally would be nice since you're getting more fish, but it was a strange balance and texture paired with the amount of rice. \n\nThe actual quality of the fish was decent, not awful but certainly not top shelf. \n\nThe waitresses were nice and the service was quick, but in a city like SF with hundreds of options for sushi, I won't be back.", "author": "Scott S."}

We were lucky enough to secure a reservation for 10, and pretty much took up half the restaurant. You can imagine, then, how small the establishment is. \n\nThe menu is hard to follow, but here is exactly what you need to order:\n+ Toro Tartare - delicious, interesting twist to a regular tuna tartare\n+ CeViche - absolutely wonderful! \n+ Foie gras sushi - buttery with a sweet finish from the raspberry \n+ Unagi nigiri - you get a huge piece of unagi that melts in your mouth\n+ Hamachi pear - just get it! Words can't describe!\n\nThings I thought were pretty good:\n- Sunset roll: must be eaten in one bite\n- Crepe albacore: interesting tempura of albacore \n- Spicy scallop roll: ok\n- 1848 oyster: I didn't have it but at $7.50 a pop, I didn't really want to. \n\nOverall, an EXTREMELY expensive sushi restaurant with creative and delicious morsels of food. Each plate only comes with 2 pieces but sometimes they'll do odd numbers for you if you come in a party of 3 or something. The bill can definitely rack up. We spent about $45-70 per person that night. Service is efficient and the waitresses are friendly.

The atmosphere was nice and not overly trendy like many other sushi places in the City.    I ordered sushi from the Specials menu, Fresh Nigiri sheet, and from the chalk board behind the bar.   I thought every was just ok.   I can see why a lot of people like this place.  The fish all tasted fresh.    The simple nigiri was great.   They are very creative and hits you with a lot of flavor profiles that usually aren't associated with sushi.   Oh, and lots of very friendly customers.   \n    \nThe reason I was not a huge fan is probably because I'm more of a purist when it comes to sushi.    Everything at Kabuto was covered in thick sauces which smothered all the great quality fish.    With the majority of rolls that we had, you could not taste what each type of fish was.   If you drown the fish, what is the point of using high quality cuts of the fish?    Really, they could have substituted the great halibut, New Zealand King Salmon, albacore tuna, or any other fish for a piece of cheap talapia and the roll would have tasted the same.   There is a ceviche nigiri that was wonderful.  Nice piece of fish with a light salsa on it and that was delicious.   It did not drown out the fish.  If they could tone down their aggressive sauces, I would have enjoyed it much more.    I'm much more of a fan of a place like Sushi Sam's in San Mateo that can take high quality fish and honor the fish without overpowering it.", "author": "Duy N."}

The place is small and sits about 26 in a slightly cramped area. \n\nI started with the Osuimono soup and K had the Miso Soup. My clear soup with clam and mushroom was a welcome hot starter in that cold blustery night. I was told that the Miso soup was delicious!\n\nI started with the Sanshu Moriawase sashimi (a sample of three slices of kihada maguro, two slices of hamachi, and two slices of hirame sashimi) garnished with bright orange fish roe that was fresh and burst in your mouth with a slight acidic flavour.\n\nI have no idea why, but K started with the mozzarella sushi which was essentially a melted mozzarella and rice concoction; it was ok --- as good as rice topped with melted cheese can ever aspire to be!

Again it was a slight interpretation as the salmon on top was seared with a blow torch and garnished with some creamy sauce that went very very well with the fish.

It was so good we had to order seconds!\n\nI missed out on the Hamachi Jalapeno which looked really really good and I must have that the next time I come here --- as should you, dear reader! \n\nEvery dish we had were presented beautifully, the fish as fresh as fresh can be, and the refreshing interpretation as well as traditional dishes never failing to serenade our taste buds to the last morsel.\n\nI am no sushi connoisseur, but Kabuto blew my expectations away!\n\nTotal damage: $93 (incl tax and tips)", "author": "Umesh T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-24", "description": "I definitely had a mix feeling about this place.In terms of sushi quality it is a 5 star. In a scale of increasing tenderness and sweet lip: shima aji (amber jack), tai (red snapper), kanpachi (greater amberjack, and a personal all time favorite). Sophisticated sushi eaters deviate from Tuna eating seeking for the perfect texture. Note: albanoe was available on special menu\n\nDiners are allowed to buy one piece of sashimi at a time - very affordable in this expensive restaurant. That makes Tai - red snapper $3 for a tasting / brief satisfaction.\n\nAnd I got to try something very adventurous: Eihire nitsuke -  slowly boiled, simmered stingray 'arm'. Wow, what an experience. The cooking is extremely well executed: thick savory soup to mask the naturally fishy taste, slow cook allow the meat to soften, and the 'bone' was crunchy and edible. But yes, the natural fishy taste will keep me away for a while\n\nThat being said Kabuto has other more tangible creative dishes: specialty sushis that you can't find anywhere else. Everyone talks about Cerviche, it was perfectly executed, the halibut was extremely tender and soft, with perfect light flavor of lime and salt\n\nI thought about ranking it 3 stars, because the restaurant is rather shabby looking. There is no ambiance for the $$$ you are paying.  The space is small and crammed, the wall bare except for a couple of odd decors. The waitresses are busy and less friendly, unlikely to engage in a passionate sushi discussion with us, because... maybe, and I strongly suggest so, it is the intensity trickling down from the sushi counter chefs. \n\nThe hierarchy in the restaurant space is apparent. Sushi chefs are tense and serious, lack of smile or communication even to those sitting at the counter. That is zero words, zero interaction. That really killed one of the best part of the dining experience. If you come here alone, you will be alone forever.And if you come here with a group, the restaurant can barely accommodate. \n\nVery mixed feelings...", "author": "Dilys S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-27", "description": "Decent enough, quite fresh sushi - hilariously bad service. The first time, the lady came too soon, and we needed more time. Fine. She came back, and said something like \"OK, you should be ready now, right?\" We were, but that's not something you say to a customer... Well it gets better. \n\nThey had a special sushi of the day menu where they gave a list of fish and a price. Now, I knew this price was the price PER PIECE, this was NOT labeled and I had to infer it. Many other reviews here mention getting trapped by that ambiguity, expecting two pieces per order. Moral of the story: If it looks too good to be true ($3 for 2 pieces of nigiri), it probably is.\n\nThe worst thing about this ambiguity is that I think they expect you to get hooked by it. My goal was to sample 1 piece of everything new and interesting that I had never had before (and FYI, the listed selection of fish at this place is amazing. If you are trying to learn about many different kinds of sushi, this is the place for you.) So I ordered \"one piece of aji\". \"One /order/?\" says the lady, going in for the kill.  \"No, one piece,\" I replied, and I guess that took her off guard. As I run through the specials menu ordering pieces here and there, some fish were not available (please tell me up front!), some fish could only be ordered in pairs (another hint that the ambiguity is intentional and you are never meant to order singles of anything.) The whole ordering experience was extremely curt and unpleasant.\n\nMy first order shows up - Aji, spanish mackerel, on its own plate (keep in mind that I had 3 other individual pieces in flight.) This took the service level from unpleasant to just strange. Why not deliver the aji with the three other pieces?\n\nMy girlfriend's first order shows up - \"live scallop\", which unbeknownst to us contains 4 pieces of scallop and two spoonfuls of some creamy-white wine-cooked version of the non-sushi bits of the scallop. Again, taken for a ride by the specials board, which merely listed the fish available, not the preparation or the cost of the dish.\n\nAfter that everything was pretty smooth food wise, but then we saw one of the waitresses break a glass on the floor, and another one wiped out on a wet spot near the kitchen and nearly broke another glass she was carrying - bless her, it wasn't her fault, but these events took the service level from strange to hilarious.\n\nWe asked for the check and of course the price was not updated to reflect the Yelp Deals coupon we came in with, so we had to send it back. The waitress we asked had to ask her superior to do it, who after a while came by and just swiped the check up without a word. Took the service level from hilarious all the way back to unpleasant.\n\nFood: We ordered Goma-ae, 2 nigiri combos (salmon, tuna, tobiko, hokkigai, ebi, mackerel, halibut, albacore, tekka maki), Chirashi-zushi, Aji, Shima-Aji, Amaebi, Kanpachi, Ankimo x2, Tai x2 and a small hot sake. All fish were very fresh but the shari was a little tough and tightly packed for my taste. Nothing in particular really stood out to me - you can have something equally good, if not better, for the same price at Okina Sushi just 10 blocks due back east from this place. And the service will be much better as well.\n\nIf I'm honest, the service was so crazy at this place that it was sort of hard to pay attention to the food. :(\n\nBottom line: The food rates a solid 3.5, and great service would have made it a 4 star overall. The dismal service we experienced brings the package down to 2 stars for me, especially considering the strong alternatives nearby.", "author": "Josh K."}

Kabuto not only provides a large selection of fresh fish, but it delivers it in a way that is unique and palate-satisfying.\n\nA late weekday dinner with no wait, my mom, the Big F and I sat at the sushi bar.  This is what we tried:  \n\n* CeViChe (Halibut and salsa wrapped with deep fried seaweed and served with lime and sea salt, eaten with no sauce.) $5 - My mom raved about this, and so we got it.  The deep-fried seaweed does indeed provide a different taste to it, along with the salsa mixture on top.\n\n* Hamachi pear (Yellowtail sushi topped with sliced pear and kabuto fruity mustard sauce.) $6 - Very refreshing with the Asian pear slice on top and mustard sauce.\n\n* Toro Tartar (Chopped Negi Toro and Avocado mixed with Kabuto Tartar sauce served with marinated Rakyo onion, deep fried shiso and seasoned seaweed.) $5 - This was my favorite of the bunch, definitely because of the seasoned seaweed and toro concoction.\n\n* Sushi-Sashi Teishoku (Slices of assorted fish, assorted sushi and a roll of tekka maki.  Four slices of tuna, three slices of albacore, three slices of halibut, two slices of red snapper sashimi, tuna, ebi, salmon, hokkigai sushi, and tekka maki.) $23 This dinner entr\u00e9e came with a house salad, miso soup, and a bowl of rice.  In retrospect, we should have skipped this and focused more on the unique sushi that Kabuto offers.\n\n* Hamachi Kama (Yellowtail collar served with grated radish and ponzu sauce.) $8 - My mom devoured this, and usually the Big F really likes this too.  But I think he was preoccupied with the other good stuff we got.\n\n* Dragon Roll (Unagi & Avocado on the outside, Tempura Shrimp on the inside) $10 - They did this roll well, very tight but quite typical.  Again, skip the regular stuff and order the unique things!\n\n* Chawan Mushi (Steamed Japanese egg custard) $6 - A steamed egg dish that had shrimp, okra, and enoki mushrooms inside.  I didn't think it was that special.\n\n* Salmon with Tobiko and a quail egg - This showcased the quality of the sake, the nice crunch of the tobiko and the egg mixing in with everything in your mouth.\n\n * 1849 oysters - The amount of time and effort that goes into doing this oyster explains its price.  A little bit of uni, ikura, tobiko, black caviar, chives, ponzu sauce and some gold flecks complete this lovely piece of artwork.\n\nWhen it comes down to sushi and unusual accompaniments, Kabuto takes the cake.  The regular sashimi is okay, and the fish is fresh.  But the real winners are beyond the average sushi menu.\n\nOur sushi chef, one of the few women working behind the sushi bars in SF, was amazing to watch as well.  Her precision and careful attention to detail showed how she really takes care of each piece of fish coming out from her end of the sushi bar.\n\nThe wait staff could use some improvement.  I had to ask for my water to be refilled each and every time, which is a pet peeve of mine.  \n\nOverall, a solid 4.  (A true 4.5 for their really great stuff, but 3.5 for the average stuff.)  Next time I go, I'm going to focus on their special stuff only!\n\n(Photos posted from our dinner!)", "author": "Teri C."}

With the exception of the outstanding omakase at Zushi Puzzle, this is the best sushi restaurant I've tried so far in SF (given, I've tried quite a few that are noticeably sub-par).\n\nIf you are thinking of going, make reservations more than 3 hours in advance. We went at 8:30pm on a Tuesday (with reservations) and were really glad we had them, because there were about 10 people waiting outside to be seated (it's a small place with a few seats around the bar, and then only a few tables).\n\nBetween two of us, we ordered:\n- Edamame ($4)\n- Tuna Tartar ($5 for 2)\n- CeViChe ($6 for 2)\n- Sammy Roll ($10 for 6 pieces)\n- Soft Shell Crab in a roll, covered by Tuna ($10 for 6 pieces)\n- Hamachi Pear ($6 for 2 pieces)\n- Foie Gras ($10 for 2 pieces)\n- Vanilla Tempura Ice Cream ($5)\n- Green Tea Creme Brulee ($6)\n\nThe SS Crab and the Sammy Roll were supposed to be fillers (so we could try all the special sushi dishes, but wouldn't leave hungry), but the Sammy Roll (Salmon-covered California Roll in a Curry Sauce) was surprisingly good. Strange / interesting to add Curry, but it worked.\n\nIf I were to come here again, I would pass on the Tuna Tartar and the CeViChe - while they weren't bad, they didn't live up to the reviews.\n\nThe Hamachi Pear was wonderful! The pear / mustard / yellowtail combination was scrumptious - I will order two of these next time! But the icing on the cake was the Foie Gras. I usually avoid Foie Gras, but the reviews were too compelling - and this dish blew every other one out of the water. The balsamic raspberry sauce and the fresh raspberry on top complimented the foie gras so well! Would highly recommend this.\n\nA note on the service. It was perfect. Couldn't have been better.\n\nCan't wait to return to Kabuto!\n\n\n***\n\nReturned to Kabuto on 6.15.2012. \n\nIn addition to the above, we tried the sonoma duck, the ono grape, the saikyo sushi, and the baby lobster tail. We also-retried the hamachi pear and the foie gras. The hamachi pear remains my favorite (the fish is so fresh). The ono grape was also extremely fresh. I would definitely skip the sonoma duck next time (it had a whallop of a kick to it, but I'd prefer to have fish), and I'd skip the saikyo sushi as well. It had a slightly sour taste to it.\n\nAgain - highly recommend Kabuto. The omakase menu is actually a fantastic deal!", "author": "Helen D."}

If you are looking for traditional nigiri, you found it too.  If you are looking for aesthetically prepared sushi, you found it too.  \n\nI have been living in the bay area for about 3 years now and I could not find a good sushi joint for the life of me.  Thank you to Kabuto for being around.  Sure, some of their rolls and sushi isn't exactly your authentic sushi but it's still to die for.  I personally don't like fancy rolls or fusion sushi of any sort but Kabuto has changed my mind.  \n\nSince it was my first time here, I ordered the omakase, which is more or less what the chef wants to serve you.  In this order we were served:\n\n\"Hamachi Jalapeno\"  (Fish was melt in your mouth fresh, but why would a sushi restaurant serve you something spicy to start with bewilders me.  Kills your taste buds a bit right off the bat)\n\n\"1849 Oysters\" (consisted of your oyster, quail egg, ikura, uni, tobiko, and gold flakes...this was by far one of my favorites of the night.  It was an explosion of flavor.)\n\n\"Ceviche\" (The roasted nori gave it a toasty taste and of course, the fish was fresh)\n\n\"Hamachi Pear\"  (This was my least favorite dish.  I'm surprised that everyone raves about this nigiri.  The hamachi was super fresh, but the mustard sauce that was placed on top of the sushi tasted like sauce you would have on a burger and that to me ruined what could have been great)\n\n\"Baby Maine Lobster\" (This was good but it doesn't really stand out in my mind)\n\n\"Live Scallop\"  ( I liked the presentation on this dish.  And the scallop was sweet!)\n\n\"Foie Gras\" (So rich! So creamy! Sooo good!)\n\n\"Toro Tartar\"  (I liked the citrus taste in this one...and it again went well with the toasted nori)\n\n\"Abalone\"  (No words needed...delicious)\n\n\"Aburi Toro\" (My favorite of the night.  Citrusy, peppery, buttery, melt in your mouth fatty tuna.)\n\n\"Uni\" (creamy...not fishy at all, melt in your mouth yummy goodness)\n\nAnd that concludes my meal.  I can't say that the service was great but they were busy.  I did like that the waitresses tell you if you need soy sauce or not with each sushi.  Reminds me of Sushi Sasabune in Hawaii which is still the best sushi ever.  But Kabuto comes close.

Clearly I beg to differ but its good to know that nobu k. feels the same.\n\nWhen I arrived it was barely past 5:00 PM so they had just opened and there were no customers inside. I was greeted and seated promptly. Up til this point I felt like things were going well, it's a very small restaurant, I've heard of the massive lines outside so I considered myself lucky. The waitress brought out menus but the bf and friend had to use the restroom / make a call, respectively, so I was the only one sitting at the table.\n\nI think this means we're not ready to order. But this did not deter our waitress from coming back 3 times within 5 minutes to ask if we were ready to order. Ok, so I look over the menu and finally decide on a few dishes. To my surprise this place was actually quite pricey and I don't know that I quite like the fact that all of their nigiri or sushi come out very non-traditional with lots of fixings, sauce, and other compliments you would not normally see at a sushi place. Although it was good, it wasn't what I would call an authentic sushi experience. They should really make this place fusion instead. \n\nThey also give you very little food. So quantity wise you won't be full and it's not the greatest meal so some may walk away grumbling a bit. The thing that really nailed this as a 3-star restaurant for me was that the waitress constantly came by and reached over us, under us, around us, and awkwardly in front of us to grab the plates AS SOON as we were done with it. Some were soooo ridiculous where she grabbed the plate right after my chopsticks picked up the nigiri but BEFORE it had entered my mouth!\n\nWhy?\n\nStrange.

Creative special dishes with nice presentation.  enthusiastic servers.\nOn the ok side. Hit and miss presentation.

They take reservations so if you are a walk in you can wait a very long time with several of their 8 tables sitting empty.  The first time we came we actually left after half and hour waiting with 3 tables sitting empty the whole time.\nOn the not so good side. the menu is near impossible to read for my old eyes.  The descriptions of the dishes are in light blue grey against white and no larger than a 6 font.  It was a hot evening so I did not have my jacket which held my reading glasses. Thankfully after attempting to use my iphone to read the menu, one of the waitress lent me a pair or reading glasses. I also felt rushed to order.  The atmosphere is very hectic and loud.

I've recently visited the area again and confirmed it was still posted and said Michelin recommended in 2013 and 2012, not 2014. And I've just realized why they didn't get it for 2014.\n===== \n\nThis is my first experience Michelin star didn't meet my expectations.\n\nFirstly, the chefs are not Japanese, but Korean. From the name of the restaurant, 'Kabuto' which seems to be a word chosen by Japanese, 4 star reviews in yelp and one star of Michelin, I was totally deceived it's an authentic Japanese place. I should have searched through reviews carefully since many people had already pointed out this. But it's not the reason I give only two stars. Even if it's not authentic Japanese, the food could be much better for the price.\n\nI tried Sushi-Sashimi Teishoku. 'Teishoku' normally means a set of various dishes in Japanese. Again, it's deceiving. It's just a plate of Sushi and Sashimi. Even rice bowl doesn't come with it. Miso soup came with it, but it's just tasteless. I don't think it's using enough broth nor traditional Japanese cooking skills. To be fair, it came with a small green salad which was good, but not super impressive.\n \nThe most important point is that the freshness of the fish doesn't definitely meet the expectation from the michelin star and at this price point.\n\nI didn't try non-sushi menu, it might be very good, but judging from the freshness of sushi ingredients and the tasteless miso soup, I guess chances are not great.\n\nAs a typical sushi place run by non-Japanese, the portion is large with not-so-good quality of ingredients. Normally those type of restaurant priced very reasonably, but this place is not the case.\n\nSo, if you expect to get an authentic Japanese dishes and/or very fresh sushi/sashimi, this is not the place to go, sorry.\n\nThe service was quick and an average, I give two stars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-04", "description": "Wow - this place is pretty amazing, and those who follow my reviews know I don't say that often about sushi.\n\nThe style here is modern - sauces and complex prepared dishes rule the day.  Their foie gras sushi ( get in before the ban if you can ) is actually well-conceived and delicious.  Especially a combination of foie and toro served as nigiri.\n\nIt being our first time here, we sat at the sushi bar ( you can reserve! ) and ordered their Omakase menu, which is actually mostly set.  It provided a good overview of what they offer and dishes were often shared between two diners.  Strangely, there did not seem to be a particular ordering to the meal, with dishes from the middle of the menu coming out first, and sometimes overlapping each other.  This was a little inconvenient in that it caused us to let the tempura course sit for a while as we finished something else, but generally everything worked well.  More strangely, sitting at the sushi bar, it seemed that we were still to order everything from the servers.\n\nPlatings were really beautiful - obviously they take time and care in the presentations.  And tastes - often problematically muddy in this modern style - were actually bright, clear and clean.  The omakase did include some traiditional nigiri - maybe just to prove that they can do normal things - and it was excellent in balance, flavor and texture.\n\nWe added a couple courses to our tasting, including the aforementioned foie/toro combination and an absolutely delicious live scallop preparation that we saw another patron enjoying - both so absolutely fresh and delicious that we were left wanting even more.\n\nThe sake list is both extensive and interesting, with a large number of things both familiar and new available by the glass.  Pours were a little variable in quantity, but mostly reasonable for the cost.  Admittedly, I skipped over a couple varieties I felt were excessively overpriced, and instead found some tasty things I had not tried before.\n\nPrices may seem high to some, but are really reasonable given the quality - looking at the sushi case, it was obvious that we only scraped the surface of their fish selection, and we got out of there for somewhat less than we might have paid for similar quality and creativity elsewhere.  We will definitely be back.", "author": "Albert H."}

Don't get me wrong, it's still good and has some really interesting sushi combos, but it wasn't knock my socks off fantastic. things to note are: the oyster with uni, ikura, quail egg and a gold leaf on top, the ceviche roll was pretty good, the foie gras roll was good (get it while you can californians) and the tuna tartar one was pretty good also. \n\nStill haven't found a favorite japanese restaurant in the city for sushi, and it doesn't help that i've experienced sugarfish in LA because that is where i'm setting the bar for my sushi now. oh, and the prices at Kabuto are a bit pricey for what it really is seeing as I've had better quality sushi that costed less than what Kabuto charges.\n\nc'mon san francisco, give me some amazing sushi already (suggestions are very welcome my fellow yelpers), that or Sugarfish open a location up here please!!", "author": "Kimberly F."}

That said, they are very nice and friendly.  And I wonder if the lean staffing keeps the prices at a fairly reasonable level.\n\nAs to the food, I've enjoyed nearly everything that I've had.  Kabuto's special sushi tends to be interesting (and delicious).  In particular, the U.F.T. (ume fried tai) is one of my favorite dishes in my lifetime.

This is in between traditional and modern. They have the quality and service of the traditional sushi bars but provides a fun twist in their dishes, like their Hamachi Pear or Foie Gras Sushi. \n\nIt is definitely on the expensive side, even for sushi. However, the quality of fish is the best I've had in the SF area and the flavors are unique and fun. \n\nI've tried:\n1. Hamachi Pear - BEST DISH EVER- MUST TRY\n2. Daily special Hamachi Jalapeno (i love hamachi) - ALSO MUST TRY\n3. Spicy Tuna and Scallops (raw scallops) rolls, which were more ordinary but still really good\n4. The salmon kama came in a huge portion (enough for 3-4 ppl) and was really crunchy and juicy. However, I would definitely skip this next time and order more raw fish\n5. Deep Fried Ice Cream - very lightly breaded green tea ice cream; so crispy and refreshing. \n6. Macha Brulee- who doesn't love Macha Brulee?? My two favorite things combined. \n\nNext time I come back, I want to try the Foie Gras Sushi and the 1849 Oysters. \n\nI would recommend Kabuto to anyone who wants a unique sushi experience with high quality fish, interesting flavors, and playful presentation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-03", "description": "Whenever I visit a Japanese restaurant, it's hard to not keep an eye on what I was eating and another on Kabuto due to an abundance of raving reviews about their culinary supremacy. The mystique has been seductively elusive to my wondering eyes and unabashed appetite for the most exquisite nigiri. Finally, I was able to stop by on New Year's eve and was pleasantly surprised to find immediate seating at the sushi bar. This was both a challenge and an opportunity to get up close and personal with what was supposed to be the best fish in the City, at least according to the reviews I've read. It was the perfect evening as the wind was calm in the Richmond District and the small interior was glowing with good lighting, great looking couples, and a clean, parsimonious d\u00e9cor. It was easy for me to keep my eyes on the prize as their sashimi display was the most colorful and sensitizing items in the house. There were three sushi chefs on duty while the kitchen appeared to be equally busy with servers rushing in and out to make sure the dishes were being delivered promptly to each table. My anticipation was running wild like never before.\n\nI thought miso and the fresh green salad was quite a nice opener. Somehow the appetizer, lamb apple nigiri ($7) was served last, and came with redundant fresh greens with four dry pulpy pieces of lamb served with grilled apple, sushi rice, and cherry balsamic sauce. The concept was outstanding as the sweet tangy sauce and the apple nicely complemented the lamb, but the execution was off given the poor texture. With the size of the nigiri being so small, I spent more time enjoying the salad than the two nigiri bummers. It was definitely not worth the hype.\n\nThe Nigiri Ichinin-Mae ($19) arrived with tuna, albacore, shrimp, mackerel, halibut, salmon, hokkigai, smelt roe and tekka maki. I thought the taste was above average good with mackerel, hokkigai, and smelt roe really stood out. The fish was not mind-blowing super fresh like the ones at Sasabune and value-wise the fish selection was not as good as Ariake which included uni and ikura in a dish called \"Love\", which was only a dollar more.\n\nMy Scott handroll ($6) was a major highlight of the night with huge handroll with robust spicy tuna, smelt roe, and a quail egg yolk beautifully placed at the top. The taste was very delicious and memorable with good texture. This is one of the better spicy tuna I've had. Good portion and very nicely done.\n\nThey could easily have received a higher rating since this is one of the few sushi places that have an impressive list of desserts. However, the server brought the bill just right when I was getting ready for dessert, prompting an abrupt ending to the meal. Overall the server and the sushi chef were helpful, responsive, but distanced. The ending was not ideal and unsettling as I walked away with mixed feelings about the overall experience. Here's how they are rated:\n\n1.) Quality and freshness: 4 stars\n2.) Creativity and presentation: 5 stars \n3.) Quantity and substance: 3.5 stars\n4.) Accessibility and affordability: 3 stars\n5.) Service and ambiance: 3.5 stars\n\nRounding it up to a weak 4 stars rating with unanswered skepticism. This place might be over-hyped and somehow the experience led me to want to give Ariake another try.", "author": "Daniel L."}

The best thing I've ever had. I always order 4 pieces ($9 for 2 pieces): 3 for me, only 1 for the fiance. When it comes out warm topped with raspberry and chive drizzled with balsamic raspberry sauce, one word says it all: orgasmic. My eyes will roll back and I will make a moaning sound. If you're the person sitting at the table next me: I'm sorry you had to hear that. \n\nI usually come about once a month and the waitress recognizes me and knows that I will order multiple orders of my favorites. My fiance's favorite is toro tartar. Absolutely amazing as well. The crunchy leaflet of seaweed between the rice and toro tartar tops it off. \n\nOther favorites: \n- Ceviche ($5, 2 pieces): I love it because it's a soft hamachi fish topped with lime juice and sea salt. No sauce needed! It has enough flavor all by itself. Because I like sour flavors such as lime, lemon, and vinegar, I really love the flavor of this sushi.\n- Baby Main Lobster ($12, 2 pieces): they use a torch to heat it up and make the \"spicy\" sauce, which is not spicy at all, SOOOO yummy! If you end up liking the sauce and you want more than just two pieces of lobster, you can opt for the \"Fire Salmon Roll,\" (~$10) which is shrimp tempura rolled topped with salmon, torched with the yummy sauce and topped with small bits of jalapeno and tobiko.\n- For fresh fish: uni, bonito, and ankimo are all really good! \n- Also, my oyster-loving friend LOVES their 1849 oysters which is topped with uni, tobiko, ikura, and gold flakes. If you love oysters, try this.\n\nFor dessert, their green-tea creme brulee was a favorite during my creme brulee obsession days.\n\nCome for the special nigiri sushi and fresh fish. I've tried many other items on the menu and they're good but I come for the special sushi. Some may think the combinations sound weird and some may think, \"this is NOT real sushi\" but I don't care at this point. As long as it continues to create a party in my mouth! BUT there's a warning: this place may create a hole in your back pocket cause it's $$$. We usually order just from the special sushi menu and some fresh fish, no sake, and it's about $40-50 per person. \n\nFYI's:\n- This is a cute, but casual place for dates. They always have a fresh flower in their vases. \n- Parking may suck, though. It IS in the Richmond district. \n- Come after 6:30pm on Friday or Saturday and you may have to wait for a seat. \n- Closed on Mondays.\n- Take-out for special sushi not allowed because it has to be fresh when consumed.", "author": "Tina T."}

Not me...\n\nLast Tuesday was my most recent visit, and my gf and I ordered the following:\n\n*Foie Gras Sushi (MUST ORDER): The BEST tasting bite EVER! The foie gras is perfectly seared and served Nigiri style. As soon as you sink your teeth into the foie gras, it melts into your mouth like butter. MmMmm, the accompanying balsamic raspberry sauce adds a great tanginess to the foie gras to balance out the richness. \n\n*Sunrise (MUST ORDER): Two thick slices of Sake wrapped around a quail egg. The sake itself is already buttery, but the quail egg adds an additional layer of creamy goodness. *drool*\n\n*1849 Oysters (MUST ORDER): 2 Oysters on a half shell topped w/ quail egg, uni, salmon roe, ponzu sauce, and gold paper. Oh My!!!! All the ingredients were super FRESH. It's one of those things that you have to try for yourself because it's too hard to put into words how MIND BLOWING it is. Rich, creamy, buttery, salty, sweet, tangy...\n\n*Hamachi Pear Nigiri: A generous slice of hamachi (very fresh) topped with sliced pear and a fruity mustard sauce. Very interesting flavor combos, but it all works in harmony giving you a tangy, savory, and sweet flavor.\n\n*Ceviche: Chopped halibut and salsa on top of fried seaweed. The halibut was fresh and the fried seaweed was very crispy and held up well to the ceviche. The saltiness from the seaweed gave the halibut enough flavor that there was no need for any soy sauce. \n\n*Dragon Roll: This was more of a filler than anything. There was nothing special about it. Do note that Kabuto's rolls are half the size of other restaurant's rolls although they charge the price of a whole roll. So, I would veer away from ordering rolls here. \n\n*Spicy Hamachi: Another filler...the spiciness came from the roll topped with Sriracha. I would have rather had it blended into the fish. \n\n*Tempura Ice Cream: Crispy, warm, rich, sweet but not too sweet; everything that a dessert should be. The vanilla ice cream was tempura battered and came out warm. The tempura was light and crispy, but the ice cream was still very hard. Despite this, it was a great ending to a good meal.\n\n*Anmitsu: Gelatin with fruit cocktail, green tea ice cream and sweet red bean paste. I could have passed on this. There were too many things going on and the ingredients didn't work well together. The fruit cocktail syrup + green tea ice cream + red bean paste made for sugar overload.\n\n*Ginjo-shu sake: Filtered and slightly sweet. After 5 shots = BUZZED!\n\nSERVICE: The only reason why Kabuto is not deserving of 5 stars is their service. The times I've been there, the waitresses were not attentive and you always have to wave your arms in their air to get their attention. Despite that it's always packed, the food does come in decent timing; about 15 minutes for the first dish, and then another 5 min for accompanying orders.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: Simple; wooden table and chairs. It's a SMALL restaurant; with max seating at around 30. So, if you're coming on the weekends, make sure to make reservations; otherwise, expect a wait. \n\nOverall, Kabuto is a great place to try creative and flavorful sushi combinations. Stick with the menu specials and the special sushi and AVOID their rolls b/c they're blah and not worth the price. Despite their inattentive service, I expect to come here time and time again b/c their sushi is that good!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I remember reading about it years ago in Zagat, but being all the way out in the Richmond I had not yet eaten there. \n\nThen my friend who lives nearby suggested we go there for dinner. He said it was usually crowded. Here's the thing, though, it was blistering cold that day and while that might not have stopped a New Yorker it kept a San Franciscan in doors. This worked out to my advantage. \n\nWith a sushi bar and some plain tables and chairs lined up against the wall, Kabuto is not one of those hyper spa relax my dear but I'll fuck you in the ass when the bill comes kind of places. It's unpretentious and cozy. (Not to say that you won't feel fucked in the ass when the bill comes, but at least you can see the fresh fish from the bar easily. You know what you're paying for. They're not tricking you.) And when I mean cozy, I think that this is one of it's best qualities, on top of how good the food is. Having recently gone on a sushi kick which I don't think will be ending anytime soon, I found this place to be the most cozy and romantic. No metal walls with heinous black berry rings pulsating around the room, and the chitter chatter of people who had too much sake. You'd take your parents here. And your date. \n\nWe sat at the bar, and started out with a sashimi plate that most definitely had my favorite, hamachi. Incredible, buttery, life affirming, fresh. We kept ordering more. Live scallop, the lobster roll, a salmon skin roll. It was fresh and full of flavor. I didn't want to de-virginize it with my heavy soy wasabi mixture. It was good plain. Everything was delicious, but if I had had it my way, I would have eaten sashimi throughout the night. Kabuto's cuts are very superior to many other places I've been, and you just can't go wrong with tasting the real thing unaltered by rice and all that fancy jazz.\n\nSpeaking of fancy jazz though, there is one other thing I want to order next time I'm there. The foie gras. So though I am a sashimi girl, Kabuto has all these crazy sushi dishes in ADDITION to a classic menu. I would like to try some of these dishes next time, including the foie gras of course. There is also a Hamachi Pear roll on the menu now which is Hamachi with sliced pear covered with fruity mustard sauce.  Um, yum! Lord do I look forward to my next visit.", "author": "Alexandra M."}

There are so many sub-par sushi places in this town who don't even try to give you something great, this is not one of them.   I have been here many times and have never had a bad experience, I have a favorite waitress there who has never done me wrong when I ask for her recommendation.  She also tells you how the item should be eaten (with or without soy sauce, etc ... ) which is very helpful.  The food and fish is always very fresh, and is visually as pleasing as it is to eat.  My two favorite non-sushi/sashimi/roll items there are the Chawan Mushi and the Hamachi Kama, also like the miso soup with Manila clams as a starter to warm my belly.   \n\nIt gets busy quickly and is small so I always try to go early to avoid the crowds and wait. It is also not the cheapest  sushi (see my reference to sub par places above) but I feel it is priced appropriately for the quality.

She mentioned that it was a pricey place and I'm like really?  From the outside it looks like another diner on Geary st and even when you go inside you may be thinking is this place going to be any good.  When we walked in there was no one besides two sushi chefs (both Japanese) and a waitress.  We sat down and the waitress came back quickly and said are you ready to order.  We had to ask her to come back a couple of times because we weren't sure what to get.  We ordered an assortment of food from something that you don't usually get such as foie gras sushi, toro tartare, live scallop, butterfish to something more ordinary such as sake chazuke (salmon, rice with green tea), omakase sushi set and age dashi tofu.\n\nLet's start off with the negatives.  Age dashi tofu, salmon rice with green tea and the 7 piece nigiri omakase were a disappointment.  Tofu was bland, not enough sauce and portion was small.  Salmon rice, over priced.  Nigiri omakase set; it's as if the sushi chef thought this was not good enough dish for him to present it nicely that he just sliced the fish nonchalantly and put it over the rice.  That was a combined $30 that I could have had another foie or toro tartare.\n\nNow onto the good stuff.  Foie gras sushi.  $5 a piece, not a bad price considering the amount of work they put into it.  Rice, foie, sauce and a piece of raspberry to balance out the flavor.; excellent.  Butterfish and hamachi belly were both very fatty and delicious.  The toro tartare at $2.50 per piece is a good deal.  Very well put together, it is rice at the bottom with a slice of nori and on top of that toro tartare and a piece of shiso.  There was also the oyster shots that had oyster, uni, ikura, caviar, golf flake all in an oyster shell eaten as an oyster shot.  \n\nService was cold in the beginning but once we ordered food and ordered an abundant of food, the waitress quickly became friendly.  The tea for whatever reason wasn't warm enough but other than that it was a good experience.\n\nWhy am I giving this four stars and not 3.5 or 3?  Kabuto isn't a place you go in for teriyaki beef or tekka maki.  It's a place where you try various different fishes and nigiris where you can't get at your regular Japanese restaurant.  Yes it is pricier and yes their hot food and regular lunch special isn't that great but that's not what they're about.  They excel in the spots where you can't find in other restaurants and that is why I am giving it four stars and why I'll be coming back.", "author": "Pierre L."}

Sure there are the a variety of sushi places with additional specialties, take for instance, Kitaro.  Kitaro doesn't thrive off of creative sushi rolls or glorious fresh fish, it's more known for the bento boxes and chicken teriyaki.  \n\nAnd for true fresh sashimi and perhaps one with a thrill for exploring different kinds of fishes, theres Zushi Puzzle.  And if you like your down to earth salmon and hamachi, trust in the hard to enter, Tekka.  \n\nBut where creative meats freshness and where different kinds of flavors meld in ways you probably wouldn't imagine, there's Kabuto.  Almost similar in the grade of Sushi Ran (although Sushi Ran, I must admit has the exotic fish like Zushi Puzzle, yet finds itself developing new flavors in the curing process to bring out natural flavors over others), Kabuto delivers just the tiny thrill of new flavors with a few of your recognizable ingredients.\n\nBefore selecting the what to order, the three of us acted like ADD children in a toy shop not being able to focus on a selective few items, but going all over the place.  Luckily, some of our choices overlapped and found itself sitting smiling at us on the Omakase.  Thus, the easy choice was right there.  And to accompany the fine meal, we had a dry chalo sake, which was a bit dry but perfectly sweetened to go with the sushi pieces that came.  \n\nDinner was delicious.  Although a little bit on the pricey end, it was fairly justified in the satisfaction of the meal and taking in some of the unique selections and flavors of the sushi.  We had the following:\n\n-Tempura - average, probably not the smartest thing to get here as its just like the ones anywhere else\n-Tasmania salmon - A personal favorite, it definitely didn't dissapoint\n-Foie gras Sushi - In the last moments of this dying breed, I'd take it and enjoy every moment I could.\n-Hamachi Pear - While simple, it was a merry mix of sweetness on the plump texture of the hamachi.\n-1849 shot - The shot not nearly heard around the world, but definitely heard amongst SF resides in this pretty roe and quail egg mixture\n-Waloo - another one of my newly found sashimi of chioce.  It's also known as butterfish.\n-Hamachi Toro - when you have toro from that of a well flavored and tender fish as hamachi, need I say more?\n\nWill I come back?

Always awesome sushi, and I had moved here from Manhattan where the sushi isn't so shabby either. \n\nSo I went back a bit ago to take a family friend there.  They had moved, but--wow!--the menu had gotten a lot more varied and, I guess, exotic. Very creative takes on sushi and sashimi without losing the essence of the main attraction: The fish.  \n\n(The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that, because I now live in Marin, my main go-to sushi place is Sushi Ran in Sausalito, which, to me, is the gold standard.)", "author": "David W."}

The flavor combination of their creative nigiris are just amazing! I've probably tried everything on their Special Menu and my favorites so far areTuna Tartar, Sonoma Duck, Foir Gras, and Crunchy... I mean, where else in San Francisco can you find a  nigiri topped with duck liver?! (and still taste good)... Their appetizers and side dishes are great too... my favorite is their 1849 Oysters... it's a fresh shot of oyster topped with uni, tobiko, caviar, and quail egg... can't get any better!!! I wouldn't come here for super fresh sashimi and traditional Japanese food, but their unique sushis are definitely worth a try... For dessert, I really liked their Green Tea Cream Brulee. The green tea flavor is very intense and rich. Every time I come here, I leave the place STUFFED (and broke)!!!\n\nThere's usually a line during peak hours, so reservation recommended!", "author": "tiannaaah J."}

The nine of us decided that we're done with Prospect, after doing a supposed Happy Hour that stretched into three.  \n\nThe breakdown of the group was as follows:\n1) Half of us have been starving since 6\n2) The other half were slightly tipsy\n3) Luckily one of us had the foresight and made the executive decision to call Kabuto for a 9.15PM reservation (SUCCESS - they were wiling to accommodate our big and rowdy party)\n\nSo we trawled across town on the long-ass stretch that is Geary, past gazillion traffic lights and 25 mph speed limit, and after what felt like an eternity, we arrived at the restaurant. \n\nAs I was in between the first and second sub-group, I initially took an interest in trying to order.  But their extensive menu (http://www.kabutosushi.com/special_sushi.html) was almost too much for my dumbed-down brain.  So my usually control-freakish self decided to defer to one of my friends' judgment and eat basically whatever's put on the table. \n\nI hardly ever was that hungry such that I would pop something in my mouth and try to find out what it was after the fact, so thankfully everything was nothing short of amazing.  Pretty-looking and delicious tasting sushi came right out, one after another, with no noticeable wait in between (I guess being one of the last parties to be seated did help).  I barely noticed the hardworking server feverishly attempting to tell everybody to not eat certain sushi with soy sauce.\n\nAll the sushi pieces were gone as soon as they hit the table.  My favorite was the egg-celent fat slimy fresh oyster topped with uni and four kinds of eggs: ikura, tobiko, caviar and quail eggs.  Following close behind were the seared foie gras sushi with raspberry sauce and crunchy sushi (tempura halibut with curry sauce).\n\nAnd since we always had room for dessert, we shared a couple of servings of green tea cheesecake and green tea cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which hit the spot.  \n\nThe whole thing did come with a sticker shock (especially given how modest and assuming the place was) - the bill came out to be $65 per person.  All I can tell you, though, is that it was worth every penny.", "author": "Ange L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-22", "description": "I've dined often at Kabuto, but tonight I had what was -- quite possibly -- one of the most exquisitely simple and unfussy sushi meals I can recall.\n\nOur party of four was rather disappointed that they had already sold out of the live scallops (we always get their \"two-ways\" scallops) and the ivory king salmon, but after a slow start of merely average Manilla clams and a slightly-smaller-than-usual 1849 oyster, we moved straight into the nigiri.\n\nThe escolar, one of my favorites, was first and should have been an obvious sign that this was going to be more than an average night of seafood. Bright, with just enough bite to the flesh, and a beautifully subtle taste like a fresh sea breeze: it was a stunning piece of fish. Our ikura and uni were also excellent, though the uni seemed a little bigger and had more depth than ones I've had in the past. One of our diners has a bigger appetite than the rest of us so he decided to tack on a fiery salmon roll and a dragon roll. I'm not usually one for rolls, but the quality of fish in these was so excellent and the sauces weren't what you normally expect when you think of typical sushi rolls. Rather than a gooey, overly sweet/salty drizzling that is better suited to patching tires than seasoning seafood, the sauces were light and complemented the rolls perfectly.\n\nThe $$$ price rating is pretty accurate, but Kabuto is a great place to just let loose and try a million different things. The size of their nigiri is just right (Goldilocks would very rightly agree that they're not too big, not too small), the rice is very well seasoned, and they know well enough to not slap an over-sized blob of wasabi between the two.\n\nBut the king of the night was the toro. I've had toro at Kabuto before and though many will tell you to get the tartare, all you really need is toro as nigiri or even sashimi if you like. The cut was perfect and -- moreso than any piece that I've ever had -- the fish was perfectly marbled. In the mouth it had a deceptively meaty bite before the intermingling layers of muscle and fat completely yielded to my tongue and spread all over my mouth. We made the mistake of ordering a few more pieces of nigiri afterwards. I say mistake only because if I had known better beforehand, I would have absolutely wanted that perfectly fatty piece of toro as my last bite of the meal.\n\nOh well. Guess that just means I'll have to go back again. What a shame.", "author": "Marcus L."}

They sell delicacies such as needle fish and live uni and scallop. The live scallop from here has been hands-down the best I've had in the bay. (Maybe it was a good day?) I will say that they have a lot of unique specialty dishes that really won't leave a true sushi snob impressed, such as the Hamachi pear. My boyfriend disliked the omakase for this reason.

The restaurant is very small and petite.  I could have drove past this place hundreds of time and still don't see it.  \n\nWe sat at the sushi bar and start ordering what was recommended on yelp:\n\n1. Ceviche - Good -  a splash of citrus taste with mustard, the fish melt in my mouth \n\n2. Sunrise - Normal - Salmon wrap around rice with topiko & quail egg on top.  The ingredients are very fresh, no doubt, but is a little too big for the mouth to consume. \n\n3. Foie Gra nigri - Good-  Perfectly cook foie gra with vinaigrette sauce \n\n4. tuna tar tar - Normal- had the same plate in many sushi places, and this place have done it like every one of them\n\n5. Spicy tuna hand roll with quail egg on top - Normal - the quantity of tuna they put in the roll is a lot \n\n6. Saba Nigri - Normal - nothing to say, the fish is not too fresh.  I assumed not too many customer order this type of fish \n\n7. Salmon Nigri- Normal - not too fresh\n\n8. 1987 or 89 Oyster - not sure what the exact name is: This plate is half shell oyster with salmon roe, yellow topiko, orange topiko, small slice of uni, and top it off with quail egg and gold leaf - (NORMAL) I have so much expectation on this plate, it was a bit disappointed.  The taste of all the other ingredients overpower the natural taste of the oyster, and each of those side ingredient doesn't match with each other... in another word, \"too much\"\n\n\nWe have couple other plates, and not too much surprises.\n\nI don't think i will go back again, is a little too pricey for the the quality and taste.

Sushi grade is choice, the size is small so of course you're going to have to wait at times, the staff are pretty much all Japanese and speak it as well and the sake selection is fairly extensive (which can add the bill nonetheless). \n\nWe got seated with a reservation and good thing we had the Yelp deal a while back.

For my overpriced 50 dollar meal (no sake or drinks and still not full) i would have preferred a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and the tiniest bit of respect.\n\nThe food was average or slightly better but they are a complete rip off!\n\nI had a couple different things including their smoked black cod which comes cooked on top of a bit of rice on a spoon.  The menu says \"$5 (1 piece)\".  I told the waitress that i wanted to try the black cod.  Amongst the other things in front of me i didn't realize that when it arrived there were two of these spoons on the plate meaning 2 pieces.\n\nWhen i got my bill after my OK but not particularly good meal i saw that i was charged for 2 orders or 2 pieces of the black cod.  Nowhere on the menu (i asked after looking) does it say that there is a minimum 2 piece order.  I was never told this either.\n\nSo i complained and said that i had only wanted one and wouldn't have tried it if i had known that i must order 2 or more.  My waitress wouldn't accept this of course.  After about a minute or two a manager was nearby and overheard our conversation.  He gave me the same run around saying it was my fault basically.  He said \"i understand, you got 2 pieces and only want to pay for one\" and things like that which i felt was EXTREMELY rude.  The only thing either of them said that made any sense was that i should have been told before i ordered that there was a 2 piece minimum.\n\nFinally they took it off when they realized i wasn't going to budge.  After they left i gave a not very loud snort of disgust to myself.  At that point the sushi chef in front of me locked eyes with me in very rude manner when i looked up at him.  \n\nI was tempted to give them 2 stars because when i left in my frustration i accidentally left my card behind.  My waitress caught me outside the door and gave it to me.  As she handed it to me and started to walk away i said \"hey wait\" because i wanted to up my tip from the crappy 10% i had given.  She pretended (i'm pretty sure) to not hear me and kept on walking.  \n\nAfter a bit of thought though they get only 1 star.

The 10$ roll that I got (tuna outside softshell crab inside) came apart as i tried to pick it up. I am very experienced at eating asian food that requires chopsticks/ hashi.  so my skills are up to date. The roll however fell apart. Very unimpressive presentation. Very plain. After spending 50$ there, I walked out scratching my head wondering what I had paid for. Crappy maki rolls but they pay lots of attention to their fancy rolls. I didn't have any of their fancy rolls, just their regular 10 and 12$ rolls. If Zagat has  rated this place, you would think they would step their game up on their non fancy rolls. \nService was good except for the complimentary red bean pastry they give you seems like a nice treat, but all it really gives you and your pretty girlfriend, are some of the worst rotten egg farts. So if you want to get sexy with you significant other later on, don't eat the red bean pastry. ( could of been the undercooked shrimp too)\n\nI forgot to mention, they barely give u any wasabi. The wasabi wasn't even hot. I like my wasabi spicy, this stuff was bland and no spice, whats the point then.", "author": "Max m."}

I came here again with a couple of friends and the sushi was just as delicious as I remembered it during my first time -- which means that its quality, even after a good few months, has not gone down and that it's still consistently good.\n\nWe ordered my favorites again: Toro Tartare special sushi, Foie gras special sushi, and the Ceviche special sushi. All just as good as I remember -- the foie gras is my personal favorite. We also ordered some new ones, including: (1) Monkfish liver special sushi (SO DAMN GOOD -- I've never had monkfish liver before and it's definitely up there with the best of the best), (2) Hamachi belly sushi (very tender and tasty), (3) Salmon with quail egg and tomiko (very good as well), and (4) Unagi nigiri (prob the best eel I've had in years). \n\nOf all the Japanese restaurants I've had in my life, Kabuto ranks up there with having some of the most unique and fresh sushi creations I've ever experienced.

After much yelping Kabuto seem to have the best review for \"fresh fish\" which is my bf's favorite type of sushi, unfortunately. With much anxiety, me being a raw fish hater, we sat down. It was 7pm on a rainy friday night, the place seemed rather slow. We got seats right away and started to order. \nWe got \n6 - salmon\n3-  hamachi\n3- wild hamachi\n2 - live oysters\n2 - uni\n1 - dragon roll\n1 - sf tsunami\n2 - tamago\n1 - halibut with salmon and quail egg roll\n2 - foie gras sushi\n\nthat's about it, i think? My favorite is of course the only completely cooked sushi \"dragon roll\".  but i must say, their fish is as fresh as it can be. I usually HATE raw fish, but Kabuto makes it heck of a better experience. Everything was extremely fresh and tasty. The SF tsunami was OKAY, nothing special. One warning to all, I felt super guilty eating foie gras sushi after finding out what it was. That in some farm, they force feed the geese in order to make their livers fatter. Hopefully, Kabuto uses organic geese, but there's no guarantee. So beware of eating foie gras sushi! \n\nThe wild hamachi is a lot more fatty and buttery than the regular hamachi. You can really taste the difference. The live oyster is a MUST TRY, it came with a very creamy oyster sauce. (although they look very much like scallops)very delicious. The tamago here aren't as great. they were very cold and i could barely taste all the flavors in the tamago. \n\nOverall, the place is pretty neat! Their sushi is creative, fresh, and tasty. But good sushi comes with a very expensive price. The sushi are mostly sold by pieces, and the regular \"fish sushi\" avg about 2-3 dollars a piece. The special sushi, which comes in 2, avg around 6-8 dollars. Our total bill came out to be 108 dollars (excluding tip), and that's only TWO PEOPLE. Well, we did order a lot. . . This place really need more attention for their awesome sushi! I would definitely go back in the far future when i can afford it. haha.", "author": "Winne L."}

This place is already ridiculously popular for dinner (I saw people wait more than an hour for a table), so all these new complaints about supposedly bad service.. blah blah, I think is way harsh.  It's definitely not easy to suddenly have a higher inflow of customers, so cut the waitresses some slack.  If you're one of those people who go to a restaurant in large groups and takes freaking forever to order and eat your food and then stay another 30 something minutes to chat, then you remember that you're adding to the \"bad service\" by making it impossible for the waitresses to turnover tables.  Just sayin'\n\nMy experience at Kabuto was wonderful!  All the waitresses came by to ask how our food was and to refill our tea throughout our meal.  Whenever a waitress saw that we had finished a dish, they would come by to clear our plates even though they weren't assigned to our table.  \n\nEverything I tried was delicious except I didn't like the hotapple, which was apple + scallop.  The combo was strange to me.  \n\nDefinitely try the potato croquettes.  Best I've ever had for sure.  I think they put carrots and zucchini inside for textural contrast, and the crust on the outside was so good.  \n\nFoie Gras sushi is honestly amazing.  If you like the buttery taste of Uni, then you can imagine how freaking buttery Foie must be with rice.  I will definitely order that again.\n\nIn terms of fish, I think their salmon was really really good, so you can't go wrong with that.  Same with Toro. \n\nThis place is too crowded and on a Friday night, it's overfilling with yuppie couples going on double dates.  But it's cool.

The sweetness of the pear and the fruity spice of the mustard blended well with the yellowtail.\n\nToro Tartar: I basically am a toro whore, so anything toro will make me happy.  This roll was also kinda big, but the tartar mix of the toro and avocado, onions, shiso was awesome. I love the seasoned seawed for that bit of extra flavor that you savor at the top of your tongue.  \n\nFoie Gras Sushi: I've only eaten foie gras twice in my lifetime, so this third should complete the trilogy. I love the balsamic raspberry sauce over the foie gras. The sweet sauce and the richness of the liver flavor just melted together so well.  \n\nKatsunagi:   I love this roll...I'd have this over again and again. The unagi, Avocado, and deep fried Shiso sauced with their housemade Raspberry Miso was DA BOMB!!! The fried cripsy flavors and the unagi flavor just socks you in the face and makes you drool bite after bite. I wish there were more than 2 on my plate, but I made it worth my time...Savor it people...it was yummers.\n\nDragon Roll: The tempura ebi was light and crispy...it was excellent, the unagi was fresh and the avocado was perfect. The teriyaki sauce covered the roll just enough to make me sublimely happy. \n\nFinally I ended my Kabuto affair with a macha creme brulee.

I drove, I found parking (miraculously after only 25 minutes of searching) and met our out of town friends. \n\nWe had made a reservation, because it's Saturday night and you do that. \nDidn't seem to matter, though. A table of our size, with a reservation AFTER ours, was seated promptly. Yet we stood, and stood and stood and waited and waited and waited. For 50 minutes we waited, standing at the door, TOUCHING the back of the chairs of the poor people seated nearest the door. This place is a tight squeeze. \n\nONE HOUR after our reservation we were seated and finally got drinks. We tried and tried to order a bottle of sake, but we couldn't. The waitress had no idea what was actually in stock, until we would decide on that bottle, only for her to disappear into the back and return with 'we don't have that'. We couldn't figure out what they actually did have in stock, and whatever was, wasn't actually on the menu.\n\nThe service was, and I don't say this lightly, the most LAUGHABLY BAD SERVICE I've had in years, maybe ever. It was terrible. \n\nThe food? Well, it looked like there was a bunch of creative, beautiful stuff coming out from behind the sushi bar, but no server ever explained to us what any of it was, so we just defaulted to sort of standard fare. We did order a few things from the 'special' menu, only to be told there's a MINIMUM ORDER for some of them. Luckily we met that need, but come ON. You must order two. Is the price listed for two? No, that's for one. WHAT? ARE YOU PEOPLE TAKING CRAZY PILLS??\n\nBack to the food. The fish was good, and beautifully plated. The creative dishes we had were okay. Good, even. Worth the wait? Nope. I was furious, and still am. The servers made no effort to make us feel better about our wait. \n\nTHE shining glory in our Kabuto experience was when the chef came out to our table with a bottle of the sake we did not buy (because it was $60) and filled glasses for us. Thanked us for waiting, apologized for the wait. THANK YOU, sushi chef. YOU were the bright spot in an otherwise cramped, rude, late evening.\n\nKabuto is a place where they play the Opposite Game- we have menus, but why bother with them? We take reservations, but don't actually respect them! We have servers, but why would they know what we have or anything about sushi? NO place is good enough to have crap service like that. Kabuto, pull it together.\n\nPeople we met at the bar across the street recommended we go to Sakura, on 26th/Clement. Maybe we should have taken that advice?", "author": "Amani Ellen L."}

Therefore, I cringe at the taste of cream cheese in my rolls, get disappointed when the servers or sushi chefs do not speak any Japanese, and sigh a little under my breath when people douse their sushi with wasabi and soy sauce. \n\nNow that I got that off my chest, Kabuto didn't really meet any of the requirements in my book to be considered a good sushi restaurant. \n\nThere are tons of specialty rolls which is a cool 'American' concept and if executed well, could be very good. However, Kabuto's rolls didn't really wow me. I tried their hamachi jalapeno, sunrise roll, foie gras nigiri, sashimi plate, and tuna tar tar nigiri. None of them really made me want to order another plate. I do give them props for originality and presentation. I can see why it would be considered people's go to sushi place in the area. \n\nAfter five dishes and a small bottle of organic sake, the bill came out to be around $95.00 without tip.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-04", "description": "So, yesterday was my first time dining at Kabuto.  When it comes to sushi in San Francisco, I'm often quite conflicted.  I've not really had my best sushi experiences here in SF.  The ones that I have enjoyed have cost an arm AND a leg (or promise of my firstborn child...go ask my mom, those restaurants shouldn't be holding their breath for repayment on that one...). \n\nSo, what did I think of Kabuto?\n\nVery good, solid, high quality sushi.  I appreciated the CLEANLINESS of the flavors.  This is NOT a place that will WAOW you with modern ambiance or crazy inventive rolls.  Yet, it is also NOT overly stuffy or overly traditional.  There are some innovative and interesting rolls to try here, so those that feel the need to experiment have room to play.\n\nI categorize this as = MODERATELY priced (although, I did not pay the bill that night), solid sushi.  I read here that it is sushi for the gai-jin...well...as long as it is fresh and tasty, why not? ;-)\n\nI find the service ABRUPT BORDERING ON BRUSQUE.  (I would give the service only 3 stars), BUT, with that typed, this was my first visit and I've seen a LOT worse at other restaurants.  Perhaps the FLURRY of the servers has more to do with LIMITED SEATING?  At times, I felt that the service was RUSHED.  Just my opinion.\n\nThe experience started off with the traditional warm hand-towels for prep, which I LOVE.\n\nFor a table of FOUR, we ordered quite a bit.  I cannot recall EVERYTHING in detail  (and as I said, I did not pay, so I do not have the receipt), yet, I will try to describe some of the more memorable dishes:\n\nHamachi Pear  ( hamachi nigiri topped with a slice of pair and dijon mustard). Very petite, bite sized portion with very fresh fish.  Not quite my favorite, but the fish was very fresh.  I'm not so sure if I really cared for the pear and dijon mixed with this choice of fish.\n\n\nCeViChe  Very interesting presentation with halibut and salsa wrapped with deep fried seaweed and served with lime\nand sea salt.  There is NOT your traditional presentation of Ceviche.  I liked the flavor of the ceviche itself, but the oily seaweed detracted from the experience.\n\nFoie Gras Sushi   This seared, marinated goose liver served\nwith balsamic raspberry and sauce was actually one of my favorite.  It was an interesting combination that played  well with TEXTURE, FLAVOR and CONCEPT for sushi.\n\nGomae  how can you go wrong with SPINACH and sesame soy dressing *LOL*...\n\nI think that we got the hirame...something... *LOL*...It was really good.\n\nThe seaweed salad VERY disappointing.  More of salad than traditional wakame salad...\n\nHmmm...we also got 2 orders of chirashi sushi (mixture of several different sashimi)...very fresh and good.\n\nOh...and dessert...the green tea mochi ice-cream was eh...  the green tea cheesecake = very good.\n\nAll in all -- food = good experience...service= fair\n\nparking= hard to find (had to walk quite a ways)", "author": "Hiromi N."}

It was super fresh, sweet, and literally melts in your mouth. Kanpachi aka yellow jack was also my favorite, it was succulent and firmer than hamachi.  \nEven though the green tea cheesecake was not impressive, but the tempura ice cream was amazing.

You roll it like a \"taco\" and eat it without soy sauce. We ended up ordering four orders of it. It was truly to die for.\n\nThat said, there wasn't one thing we ordered that we didn't like.

The staff were great, they apologize for the long wait and they took our order right away.  \n\nWe ordered (4 pieces of each) Bachi Maguro,, Hamachi, Kotako, Mahi Mahi, Miso TORO Asparagus, Sake, Toro-Fatty Tuna & Yosenabe. \n\nFor drinks Mr had Asahi & I had a glass of Kubota Hekiju ($24 for a glass) $110 for a bottle. But, LOVE that SAKE, it was little sweeth stong and smooth.\n\nSince we ordered so much sushi, we didn't had a chance to finish our Yosenabe.

It's a tiny place in inner richmond with minimal decor but I care more about the food than then place. The specialty sushi that they have are unique and flavorful. The chef really knows what he is doing by mixing those flavors together. I tried most of the specialty menu and my favorites are the foie gras sushi and the ceveche. The raw oyster is also one of my favorites too. They add quail egg, fish roe, uni, and edible gold shred on top. Every bite is like a party in your mouth. \n\nThe food is simple, yet refined, That's what Japanese food is about. Folks, it doesn't get any fresher or better than this.", "author": "Jack S."}

Each time $50-60 easily for 1 person. Once took my sister's family and spent $300 for 1 dinner. My sister wasn't even impressed about the food. Today, I gently asked if I may order 1/2 bottle of small sake, since I can never finish 1 bottle by myself. Was told NO without any reason. Walked out and happily fed in the neighbor restaurant Ariake. Yes, they are ok with my peculiar request of 1/2 bottle of sake. Thumbs up to Ariake!! I may not even try the 1/2 bottle next time since it left me some desire for more. Dear Kabuto, sorry you are not the only J-restaurant in town. Are you out of your mind to let go a perfectly good business over 1/2 bottle of small sake on a chilly night when most of your tables were unseated?", "author": "SpaDoll H."}

Luckily this restaurant left me with a good enough impression to recall all of the wonderful sushi that I had.  I love that there are a lot of items on the menu to choose from.\n\nThe most memorable sushi that I had here was the Scott Handtroo.  I really like spicy tuna hand rolls.  But when you throw in a quail egg...forget about it.  I loved this hand roll a lot.\n\nThe Foie Gras Sushi was also unique and tasty.  I love foie gras a lot.  So when you incorporate it into sushi and add raspberry sauce, it just leaves a memorable taste in your mouth.\n\nI also had other sushi, such as Uni Nigiri, Sayori (Pencil Fish), Akamutsu (Black Throat), and the Chirashi-Zushi dinner.  All were good, but I remember not being too impressed with the Akamutsu and the Sayori.  I love ordering Chirashi when I go to a Japanese restaurant.  The Chirashi here was very tasty.  It is one of my favorite Japanese meals.\n\nThe reason that I didn't give it five stars was because of a few things...\n\nOne, our waitress was not all that nice.  She wasn't totally rude, but it seemed like she could care less whether we were happy or not.  It didn't matter to me so much because I was really into the food.\n\nTwo, as good as Kabuto was, I recently had a meal at Sushi Ran and I love that place!  To me, Sushi Ran is the best Japanese Restaurant in the Bay Area, and Kabuto comes in second.  When I compare the two, everything about Sushi Ran is just a little better than Kabuto.  So how could I possibly give Kabuto the same exact score as Sushi Ran.\n\nEither way, if you end up at Kabuto, you won't be disappointed at all.  I can't wait to get a chance to go back to Kabuto and retry the dishes that I have fond memories of.  Hopefully I get to do that soon.", "author": "Jesus R."}

I was really pleased with everything we ordered, except for the spicy tuna roll (which I have to order EVERYWHERE!) because they placed mint (?) in the roll.

They also had a tuna sampler of different kinds of tuna sashimi on their menu that I was thinking about ordering instead, maybe next time. I didn't try any of their specialty rolls, it would have been too much food. But I'll definitely try the ceviche roll when I return. \n\nI was pleased with the food and quick service, but the restaurant itself is tiny and cramped.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-09-23", "description": "We had some guests coming into town and wanted to show them an outstanding sushi experience, and since we had heard amazing things about Kabuto, we made that our destination. \n\nWith 4 weeks' advance notice of our friends' visit to San Francisco, we decided that it would be prudent to book a reservation. I called Kabuto and did so, and they took down our name and number. When we became aware of a slight change of schedule a few weeks later, I called back to adjust our reservation by 15 minutes and add one person. No problem, they said, and made the adjustment.\n\nFast forward to the Friday evening of our reservation. We arrived at 8:15 to find a completely full restaurant (always a good sign!), but the restaurant staff appeared confused when we told them of our reservation. In response to our queries, they bustled around and seemed to be trying to expedite other dining guests' dinners to accommodate us, but none of the staff actually communicated to us that they knew that we had a reservation and were doing something to get us seated quickly. We started growing a bit agitated by 8:45, at which point I asked them point-blank what was going on. One server told me that \"our restaurant doesn't accept reservations\", which was clearly inaccurate and was also clearly the wrong answer for a large group that had been waiting more than 1/2 hour past its reservation time. A more senior staffer intervened and told me that they were working to clear a table for us quickly. Hot sake arrived, gratis, and this smoothed things over a bit, but our visiting guests were clearly hungry. 15 minutes later, we were finally seated.\n\nJust as we were seated, a young Japanese/Caucasian couple that had also been waiting the same amount of time that we were finally lost their patience and left the restaurant abruptly, slamming the door behind them and inadvertently shattering the glass. This created some unwelcome drama for everyone and clearly added to the evening's stress (and cost) for the restaurant owners. \n\nAfter that point, the evening improved dramatically. Service was impeccable, and the food was equally amazing. Honestly, this is some of the best sushi that my partner and I have had in either San Francisco or Los Angeles, and our guests concurred. It was extremely fresh, elegantly prepared and simply delicious. Wow!\n\nIf we had experienced only the food and not the unprepared staff, we would give Kabuto a \"5\" with no reservations. When they seemed to forget our reservation, then told us that they don't accept reservations, and then seated us finally a full 45 minutes late (9pm), that merited an extremely poor customer service score... perhaps a \"2\". We'll net out both scoring dimensions and give them a \"3\" overall. \n\nWe will definitely try Kabuto again, as their amazing food quality overcomes our concerns about the shoddy service experience repeating itself. Hopefully the staff took note of the disastrous way that they handled us (and the couple who left), and will work to improve their reservation handing experience and wait times. If they can get the service dimension right, we'll gladly give them the \"5\" that their food deserves.", "author": "Lao Z."}

I adore sushi, and this place serves some of the best fish and flavor combinations I've had.  It would get 5 stars for the sushi, but we made the mistake of ordering a couple non-sushi items that were subpar, so for that I must sadly dock a star.  \n\nSo to get the bad out of the way...the agedashi tofu was really not good.  And for dessert the green tea creme brulee was fine, but the flavor was a little off.  This place is clearly a sushi restaurant.  \n\nBut now for the good...we got a ngiri sampler.  Pretty standard options, but boy was the fish fresh and melt-in-your-mouth.  Very nice. We also went for the roll filled with soft shell crab but wrapped in tuna.  Again, very nice, but I think I wouldn't order it if I came back.  Great to try, but not one of the standouts.  I also got a spicy hamachi roll (I usually only see tuna or scallops with a spicy option, so this was kind of fun) and the flavor was really nice, and yes it left my mouth burning a little.  It was great. \n\nAnd now for the truly phenomenal...the special rolls.  We only got the ceviche and the toro tartar, but next time I will want to order as many of these specialties as possible.  The flavors and textures were amazing.  The only downside is that at only two items per order, if you've got a big appetite like me, you can wrack up quite a bill, so I suppose I would suggest also ordering some of the non-special rolls that include several pieces of sushi instead of just two.  \n\nThis place makes impressive sushi.

I would stand on the corner of the street and ask for money while wearing beaten up tattered used clothes. Hey, most of the panhandlers use the money for things that are not food and shelter, why can't I use it for sushi?\n\nWhen people that help run yelp, like Jessica T. write about how out of this world a place to eat is, I suggest, run don't walk to them. Her taste is impeccable. \n\nI have had Kabuto saved in my bookmarks to try for over a year, but since the economy dropped and we've now all been working like dirty whores for a dollar, sushi has now turned into an extravagance, instead of a four times a week dinner.\n\nKabuto on Geary, in my hood actually, is innovative, fresh, amazing.....their food surpasses my dream of sushi. And get this, they have a female sushi chef as well who works to the side of the owner, which is amazing. In Japan, women aren't usually sushi chefs as \"their hands are warmer\" which isn't ideal for serving fresh cooled fish. She is amazing, with a slight smile she serves us sushi we only dream of when outside of NYC or Vegas. The rolls aren't rolls, they're utter perfection that happen to contain fish and rice. \n\nPear and hamachi? Toro and spicy cilantro with fried shiso? You HAVE to be kidding me! Japanese pumpkin delicately fried and placed on amazing rice with perfect seaweed. Their gyoza are homemade, lightly pan fried and are light, flavorful and to DIE FOR!\n\nI almost didn't want to write this because when I go back I don't want some huge wait in this tiny place because everyone in SF now knows about it. See how selfless I am? Im giving up my secret...that's how much I love you...\n\nRUN and don't walk to this place, I don't care if you don't have the money, steal it if you have to.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-13", "description": "It's shocking that the 2 best sushi places in the city are within a block of each other (Ariake being the other). I waited to yelp Kabuto until I had a chance to go back a few times, because I was in a slight state of shock at just how good it is. \n\nFirst of all, the fish. I dare you, challenge you, look at pity upon, anyone who says they can find better tasting fish. The quality, and absurd freshness of the fish is something to try this place for alone. I could happily just eat Nigiri/Sashimi here until my stomach exploded. But if you did that you would be missing out on some of the most creative sushi \"dishes\" that you will find. \n\nAnd no I'm not talking about traditional \"wild rolls\" (I'm really over rolls in general at this point). But just insanely creative dishes. The ceviche \"roll\" comes as 2 pieces of halibut topped with \"salsa\" on rice, sitting on a large piece of seaweed (which you use as a \"wrapper\" to eat the dish), and is fantastic. Really amazing flavors. Most of their \"rolls\" on the special sushi menu come prepared in a similar fashion, 2 pieces that are just fantastic. Try the Hot Apple, Toro Tartare & Hamachi Pear. \n\nSit at the Sushi Bar and watch a true master at work. Initially put off by my first visit to the Sushi Bar, because of the annoyed looks we got when asking \"what is that (with an Ooh, and Aaahh)\", on subsequent trips I realized that it is like disturbing a master painter who is mid stroke and asking \"so what is that going to be\". Just sit back and enjoy watching them work. \n\nThough you can get out of here without breaking the bank, it is very easy to do so as well. Be forewarned, for just o'girl and I, I have paid upwards of $200 for a meal. As the sake flows, and your taste buds drown out the part of your mind adding up the cost, it is easy to get carried away. If you walk in knowing that, you won't walk out pissed. \n\nI cannot recommend a place higher. Simple as that.", "author": "Andrew M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-18", "description": "What can i say about this place except that its so good I've become a frequent flyer at Kabuto. I come here so often the waitress knows my basic order (foie gras, 1849 oysters) by heart. I'm always greeted by an enthusiastic, \"hi! how are you!\" With that said, service is always awesome. \n\nAs for the food: Kabuto is like no other place in the city. Where else would you have oysters topped with salmon roe, tobiko, uni, and edible gold? I kid you not. When I have the 1849 oysters, it takes me to a happy place and my dining companions know not to disturb me. I could write an essay on the 1849 oysters but I'll make it simple, the sweetness of the uni compliaments the oyster so that the oyster is sweet. The popping of the tobiko and salmon roe in your mouth makes the consumption experience full of surprises and fun. And the edible gold just makes things look pretty. All my senses are challenged at every corner with this dish. The foie gras sushi is simply fantastic when augmented by the lovely raspberry sauce. \n\nOther honorable mentions: toro tartare, ceviche (listen to the waitress and DONT put soy sauce on this-or it will defeat the purpose of it being called 'the ceviche'), the valentine (foie gras + unagi), baby maine lobster roll, sunrise (tobiko wrapped with fresh salmon topped with a quail egg), bonito tuna and anything on the nigiri specials board is great. The fish are fresh.  There are some things like the uni or ankimo where I've had better but it is still superb here. Plus I'm a bit of a uni snob so I've got insane expectations for my uni.\n\nI don't recommend that you order the plain 'ol rolls or else you'd just be wasting the experience and your yelp complaining about lame things like how bad the parking is that don't pertain to the dining experience.  I also don't reccomend the sonoma duck sushi unless you're in love with wasabi. Wasabi's awesome but damn that one really suprised me with the insensity of the wasabi. I think it may have opened up new sinuses that anatomically do not exist. Also, yes it is pricy but fair (typically a piece of foie gras cost bank at any other restaurant for something much smaller than what they offer at kabuto). So it is reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food. One more thing, notice that there's 1,2,3 dollar signs so you were fore-warned.\n\nIn conclusion: give this place a try if you like innovation and want something more than the over-saturated with mayo rolls at the typical sushi place. It has, has to say the least, become my friends and I's monthly (sometimes bi-weekly) guilty pleasure.", "author": "Wendy L."}

Unfortunately, they are closed on Tuesdays, so I figure I'd try Kabuto a few doors down.  I always see a lot of people, and I have heard good things about it.  So I thought, why not?\n\nThe decor is a bit nicer inside than I thought it would be, which I suppose is a plus.  I looked through the menu and really didn't find that much to be excited about.  I hadn't read the Yelp reviews before going, so I didn't know what they were known for.  Now that I have read other reviews, I'm feel a little cheated since many of those items seemed to be available yesterday.  Maybe I'll go back one day, but here is why it probably it won't happen:\n\n1) We ordered a sushi dinner, the sea bass, the chicken karaage and a seaweed salad for two moderately hungry women.  I asked if that sounded like an appropriate amount for us, and she gave me a condescending look.  Unappreciated...\n2) The fish was okay, but really not that fresh at all.  It looked like something I could have gotten at some third-rate sushi place...  It was fresh enough that I wouldn't get sick, but that's about it.\n3) Prices are really unreasonable given the freshness.  I may have order the sushi dinner, so it won't be as fresh as a la carte orders, but I still paid $19 for what should have been a $13 set dinner.  I didn't think anyone else's fish looking that much fresher anyway.\n4) Seaweed salad was Asian fusion in a bad way.  Mixed greens, with same seaweed that they use in the miso soup, with little to no vinaigrette.  Not my idea of a tasty Japanese treat.\n\nWe had enough to eat, and the bill came out to about $45-$50 for two people.  Totally not worth it.  I like fusion as much as the next person, but I expect top quality fish for the price.", "author": "Fontane L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-16", "description": "Kabuto received a 14/20 from Gayot, and I was in the mood for a top-of-the-line sushi bar that I had not already visited, so I tried it out for lunch today.  The interior is simple and welcoming with its yellow walls.  A chorus of \"irrashaimase!\" greeted us, which is always encouraging.\n\nThe waitress was very pleasant, and while the two itamae were friendly 'enough,' they weren't nearly as charming or gregarious as Tommy, Suzuki, or Isa over at Ebisu.  Guess I'm just spoiled by the best and the brightest.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the first impressions of the place was the tiring and inauthentic practice of involving a waitress to take the order when I am sitting only three feet from the itamae.  This trend is horrible and must be killed!\n\nI told the waitress that I wanted the chef to serve sashimi omakase style, but that I did not want the plate to include bluefin tuna.  \"It's a fixed plate,\" she said.  I told her that I still didn't want any bluefin tuna on the plate, so she suggested that I choose from the a la carte side of the menu, which is practically the opposite of omakase.\n\nFinally, the sushi chef intervened, and from that moment on, my experience improved dramatically (why couldn't we have just started this way?!?).  He asked me questions, I and my boyfriend asked him questions, and we were off to the fresh-fish races!\n\nAbout the menu.  There were all kinds of fish I had never heard of, which is pretty exciting for a sushi lover.  Items like akamutsu (black throat seaperch) and bachi maguro (big-eye tuna).  Eric, the younger of the two itamae, served us plates with sashimi cuts of shiro maguro, sunazuri, hirame, something called Tasmanian salmon, which was a soft, succulent variation on ordinary sake, and shima aji (confusing, since the menu says it's amberjack, right next to kampachi, which is the traditional name for...amberjack).\n\nAbout the fish.  The coolers were stocked with lots of fish, which is a good sign, as it suggests that they have a high-volume business and fish won' t sit around for very long at all.  Everything except the big-eye and escolar popped with freshness, and all slices were served at the proper temperature -- not too cold.  Particularly excellent was the hamachi belly, the Tasmanian salmon, and the shima aji.  I've had better shiro maguro, but Kabuto's was good.  Unfortunately, they were out of ono (which I've never had) and kohada.\n\nAbout the service.  Service was excellent.  I drink tons of water during a meal -- the waitress was all over it.  I didn't care to receive a Western lettuce salad, lukewarm miso, and rice *before* my first bite of fish, so I ignored them.  While waiting for my sashimi, I poured a bit of soy sauce into its little bowl.  Within seconds, the waitress snatched the bowl away and replaced it with another, filled with an identical liquid. \"Sashimi soy sauce,\" she said, and marched away.  I learned later that sashimi soy sauce has more salt and more of a soy flavoring.  I did notice that it was saltier, but I wonder why this is desirable, whether it's traditional, and why I had never encountered this odd sauce anywhere else?\n\nI give it only 3 stars because I need to go back for another meal before I can consider upping that score to 4 or 5.  I think it's a tribute to the promise of Kabuto that I am very interested in eating there again.", "author": "Andrew L."}

Unfortunately, I stopped visiting San Francisco and had a long hiatus.  I returned a couple of weeks ago, not remembering the name but sort of remember the location.  We drove up Geary looking for it on the right hand side of the road -- I was sure I would recognize it.  Ultimately, while continuous searching Yelp for local Japanese restaurants I remembered the name (omoidashimashita) but the restaurant was on the other side of the street.  My confusion, I thought, but soon learned that they moved about eight years ago.\n\nWell, I wasn't disappointed.  The sashimi was as good as I remembered.  Interesting cuts of fish and definitely fresh.  I even had a discussion with the the itamae about the quality of uni (my favorite), having thought that uni from San Diego was the best (I'm from San Diego).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-17", "description": "Was looking for a decent place to have dinner last week, and thanks to one of Nobu K's hilarious but insightful reviews, gave Kabuto a shot. After a life-changing trip to Japan a year ago, I've been longing for food even half as good as their domestic restaurants, with little success.\n\nPrompt seating for dinner (although they sat a party of two at the bar despite plenty of vacant tables; would have preferred a small table to help with conversation), and a good ratio of servers to customers kept wait times short. The place isn't particularly well decorated to evoke ideals of Japanese cuisine--maybe more like a 60s diner than anything--but I'm no interior designer; I go to eat, not gawk at the walls.\n\nI had a prime seat in front of the senior chef; it was a pleasure to watch his skill and attention to detail. As a proud obsessive-compulsive person, I totally loved watching the chef plate the food, arranging the fish, rolls, or sprigs of greens and then slightly tweaking them to be \"just right\". Of course the same seat also bolstered my embarrassment whenever my clumsy paws wouldn't pick up or hold onto something quite right. It's no formal place, but I like to respect the chef's artistry just the same. \n\nAll of that is well and good, what really counts is the food. Luckily, Kabuto pleasantly surprised. So many places serve tiny sushi and charge top dollar for it. Not here. The nigiri were full-sized with a plump bit of fresh fish on top; much like I remember overseas. Hamachi wa oishikatta desu; melting in my mouth. A couple of the rolls were fancier (and more slender) than necessary, but delicious just the same. Finishing things off with some inari and tamago was perfect; both good sized and not too sweet (too much syrup and sweetness is common). Didn't scrutinse the bill, but I'm pretty sure the large cups of tea were complimentary. A full meal for two including tax and tip for under 60 bucks; well worth it for the quality.\n\nService was polite and thorough; everyone including the chefs greet customers as they walk in (irasshaimase!) and thank them when leaving.\n\nBottom line: A quaint little shop that serves some of the most authentic sushi I've ever had in the states. Healthy portions that might seem a bit higher than average price but worth it for both quantity and quality; attentive service... I will definitely come back for dinner, or even try to check out their lunch offerings.", "author": "Aaron H."}

Once we walked in, there were 2 open tables, 1 all the way in the back and 1 directly in front of the door on a cold windy night.  Guess which table the waitress told us that's available?  She told us to sit down on the one directly in front of the door.  Really?  Luckily, the other waitress then told us to sit at the other table in the back.  Ok...I'll let that one slide.  After we sat down, they dropped 7 menus on our table: 3 of the regular menu, 2 of the special sushi menu, and 2 of the alcohol menu, so we had a bit of an issue getting the right menus to look at.  10 minutes went by and you would think they would first give you tea, but had to ask for tea.  Another 10 minutes went by and still no tea.  We ordered the fois gras sushi, fire salmon roll, dragon roll, tuna with soft shell crab, and spicy hamachi.  The first dish was the fois gras sushi and it was ok...tried it and wouldn't order it again, because it didn't have the \"Wow factor\" for me to say \"Wow!  I gotta come back and order this next time\".  The 2nd dish was the fire salmon roll and this was probably the best salmon roll I've ever had, but had to use my chopsticks to split the rolls into the separate pieces, because the seaweed was still attached between the pieces.  Then came the dragon roll and it was ok and again had to use my chopsticks to fully separate the seaweed between pieces.  The tuna with soft shell crab was not good.  The soft shell crab tasted old and soggy as if it was cooked in the morning and guess what???...had to separate the pieces again.  The spicy hamachi was pretty good and guess what???  No, didn't have to separate the pieces on this one, because these were standing vertically where they had to separate the seaweed.\n\nConclusion...overall was ok, but the service was terrible and what sushi place doesn't fully separate their rolls???  Even the worst sushi restaurants out there would ensure all the sushi pieces are separated, but for Kabuto to have the seaweed still attached to pretty much all our rolls is a big disappointment and shameful to all sushi owners.

It comes with tuna, albacore, shrimp, mackerel, halibut, salmon, hokkigai, smelt roe & tekka maki.  There was even a giant clam nigiri, the first I've seen.  All of it was delicious.  This sushi entree comes with miso soup and house salad.\n\nMy husband orders various items.  He starts with the Kai Miso, a miso soup with asari clams.  Neat idea - this is highly recommended!  Next comes a saba nigiri and a dragon roll.  The mackerel is delicious and always garners respect from the sushi chef/waitstaff anywhere we go.  Just an observation.  The dragon roll was pretty good, as the unagi and avocado were delicious, but there was a bit too much rice and the tempura shrimp seemed small.\n\nBut the highlight for us was off the special sushi menu -- the Katsunagi.  This is unagi, avocado and shiso deep fried as katsu (coated with bread crumbs & fried) and served with kabuto raspberry miso sauce.  The sauce looked like \"country gravy\" which seemed odd at first.  But combined with the katsu it became a nice flavorful dish.  Awesome!\n\nWe tried our luck at dessert, but ended up underwhelmed.  We each had the tempura green tea ice cream and the macha creme brulee.  Both could have been sweeter in taste.  They are probably trying out new ideas for execution and presentation of desserts.  But for next time, we will skip it.\n\nKabuto is some of the best sushi I have had in a long time.", "author": "Janet H."}

Pretty much had an all sushi dinner there.  It was good sushi with great fresh ingredients.\n\nParticular sushi I choose when evaluating a sushi place are one of the tuna, ikura (salmon eggs), and saba (mackeral).\n\nToro = firm fish with even taste.  Not old, mealy, oily, or disguised with heavy wasabi to mask age.  The toro was good, not the best I have had, but in the top and would order again.\n\nIkura = Th eggs were firm, bright orange, with good flavor.  The eggs were not over salted, discolored, slimy, or with poor turgor.  I have had ikura with more flavor, but this was one of the better quality ikura I have in awhile.\n\nSaba = The saba was excellent.  The fish was firm, tasty, and did not overpower with vinegar.  The saba was served with a piece of some type of wakame on it, presumably to cut the vinegar taste.  It worked well the vinegar was just a hint but not too strong like some saba.  The flesh was still firm, unlike some places where it is starting to fall apart.  This was one of the best sabas I have had in a long time.\n\nThe sushi-su is also an integral part of the sushi.  With bad su a meal can be ruined.  With good su the rice is tasty and provides a great palette to highlight the fish and other ingredients.  The su at Kabuto was tasty and light, it provided an underscore to the fish without distracting from the fish as it created a good firm bed for the nigiri.\n\nI would eat here multiple times.

It met their expectations.  I heard \"OH...mmmmmm!!!!\"  They were pretty excited - as excited as a person can get from eating sushi.\n\nWe were about 10 people on my first visit to that small mom 'n pop restaurant.  The food came a bit slow but all the dishes/sushi were excellent quality.  On the second visit I noticed the food still coming slow despite it was only the two of us.

We arrived at 8 for our reservation, but were TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY IGNORED for 20 minutes while we just stood there in the doorway. The two waitresses WOULDN'T EVEN MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH US. It was ridiculous. When I finally lost patience and was able to corner the younger of the two waitresses to inform her that we had a reservation, she acted like I may as well have been from Mars, and bustled off to do something else. When I then asked the old waitress if we could have a seat at one of the MANY AVAILABLE TABLES, she said that they were \"for another reservation\". When a couple of seats then opened up at the sushi bar, the old waitress then sat some other people that were behind us. And all of this without so much as a \"sorry\" or \"it will just be a moment\" or ANYTHING!!!!\nAt this point, I would have been a total and complete idiot to stay here and give them my money. So my wife and I went down the street and spent a couple hundred dollars at a place that welcomed us when we opened the door, and seemed happy that we were there. \nI will tell anyone who asks and probably lots of folks that don't to NEVER EVER COME TO KABUTO. Horrendous customer service does not compensate for fresh fish!", "author": "Doctor S."}

Further you end up regretting all of the attempts you had at trying to find a replacement.  Maybe as the years went by you found semblances of replaceable parts, but when you got a taste of that once pure goodness, the fallacy that was your post separation/rebound replacement crumbled like a wall in Germany.\n\nKabuto, you are that lost love. I am sorry for dulling my memory of you and for forcing myself to try to forget you.  Last night we reconnected after 4 years and I must say, you were better than ever.  Gone were the things that annoyed me (big crowds, cramped spaces, long lines, people holding the door open on cold nights because as they suffer through \"the-wait,\" we eaters must feel their coldness too).  Gone for the night was the excuse that I live in Berkeley, which broke up the romance in the first place.  \n\nLast night was a perfect flashback.  Absolutely perfect nigiri (Ono, Dungeness crab, Bonito in a sauce to die for, Unagi to end all unagis, an Aji (with its bones fried on the side) that makes you want to be a predatory fish, etc. etc.).  Then came the fun stuff, a live scallop nigiri that on the side had spoonfuls of the \"guts\" from the scallop in a cream and wine sauce that was devilishly scrumptious.  Next up was the hammachi with a slice of crisp pear and a topping of fruity mustard.  So simple, so clean, yet shockingly good.  Ah, I forgot you had this move Kabuto, no one else has ever done it like you.\n\nWhen I was feeling the love come back, you dropped the haymaker on me with the Valentine - That smoky sweet mix of unagi, seared liver, squash cubes under a blanket of balsamic-coco sauce that all foodies must have to have once before dying.  If fish could be had for desert, this would be my order.  \n\nEven in its simplicity, Kabuto you know how to wow me.  Your spicy tuna roll should be a simple offering.  Yet yours has a hint of shiso (which usually I hate, but was the perfect note), and is under sauce that is both spicy but deeply flavorful.  A basic roll, but no one does it like you.  Once again you've ruined me.\n\nKabuto, I apreciate your special little details.  The little cranberries that are on most plates that cleanse the palate and are just damn yummy to munch.  The near candy like fresh roasted Japanese Pumpkin nigiri that are a MUST HAVE even if your not a vegetarian.  I got a double order.  The aforementioned Aji bones that should be bagged and sold in supermarkets, which you happily serve up with an order of nigiri.\n\nFinally, your ankimo.  Ah ankimo, that silky smooth pate of the sea that still blows my mind as to what sushi can elevate is self into.  Other places put on a nice showing, but Kabuto, your ankimo appetizer was divine.  Softer, smoother, better tasting than all the rest.  Oh, how you know you're the best.\n\nKabuto, I know distance separates us, but our love is so strong I refuse to let mileage be an excuse to keep us apart.  You gave me a perfect tasting of that old sweet loving and I'm hooked on you once again.", "author": "Aaron M."}

This place is wayyy out of the box I would even go so far as to call it Japanese fusion. They make some really interesting dishes and the owners ARE Japanese, so don't you start complaining that they are destroying tradition! They can and do serve what they want! I've never had a dish here i didn't enjoy. Some of them are orgasmically tasty.\n\nThe fish selection is really good, exotic at times, and everything is super fresh. I've taken dates here, friends from out of town, I'm a repeat customer.\n\nYes I will admit the service is a bit slow sometimes (the place gets very busy and its fairly small, I hope they expand to a larger building eventually). It's worth it to call ahead and get a reservation. I like the fact that the servers are Japanese and have accents. How could reviewers complain about authentic servers?? It adds to the appeal for me. And they will tell you \"don't put soy sauce on this, it's already served with a sauce, you silly american!\" I think that's righteous. Tell me how to eat the dish you prepared for me. Would you put ketchup on a Fillet Mignon?\n\nIt isn't really that expensive. It's up there, but if you want a REALLY nice sushi dinner for two, you could walk out of there for less than $100, and you could likely get some drinks too for that price.\n\nIf you are a sushi nazi and only like traditional sushi, skip this one you will be offended.. If you are into Japanese \"fusion\" and you have a refined pallete for super fresh fish, this place knocks it out of the park. I like that they aren't cheesy like some of the other Westernized sushi places, they don't dump spicy mayo on everything, and they don't deep fry that many of their rolls.

They offer some unique sushi, blending new and old flavors culminating a taste that will leave an impression. The Scott's handroll is tasty (basically a spicy tuna handroll topped with a quail's egg) as well as their raw oyster (1849?) topped with a myriad of additional flavors such as quail's egg, tobiko, cavier and foie gras if I'm not mistaken. Either way, it was a delectable delight however not cheap... 2 pieces for $16. We also order one of their sashimi platter dinners and the fish was fresh but the quality of fish is not top tier given the prices I'm paying. Along with this, we also ordered Uni nigiri which was a HUGE disappointment. It was not particularly very fresh. I do understand that Uni is not something that stay fresh for an extended period even stored properly, but with a restaurant that is so highly touted, I expect more and that they should know when their Uni is not fresh as to avoid serving it. Lastly I had their Amaebi which is good, but not as sweet as other premium Japanese sushi restaurants I've been to.\n\nThis place has a loyal following and we all have our personal tastes. I just don't feel the place really deserves anything higher than 3.5 stars based on their higher prices, overall average sashimi and somewhat rushed service. The servers looked stressed out and didn't smile very often, we even sat at the counter and the sushi chef barely responded to conversations we were trying to have with him about the food unless we asked \"what is this called?\" \n\nIf you're looking for a place that has some nice fusion sushi and you're willing to spend some money, then be sure to make reservations in advance. However for those who are more discerning sushi lovers, you can skip this place without regrets... trust me, your money is better spent elsewhere.", "author": "Andrew L."}

Sushi is tasty. Interesting inventions. Pricey for what you get... or don't get. The service is pretty good unless it's really crowded, which is 80% of the time, at which point orders can be forgotten.\n\nWorst seat in the house is the \"butt-crack\" seat or \"windy-way.\" It's the seat closest to the door. When crowds start to hang at the door waiting for their table, they're practically sitting ON your table. When the door opens, especially on a gusty day, you'll think you were sitting on a chairlift at Kirkwood or Sugarbowl. \n\nBut every time I go weird things happen. One night a guy tried to bring his mountain bike into the joint. The space is smaller than a Taco Bell which is totally unsuitable for a bike.

I hope your date puts out.\" Nice.\n\nTrivia: Kabuto is the former location of a place called Rancho Mr. Hot Dog. \n\nSit at the bar to experience Kabuto at it's best. \n________________________________________________________________\n\nSmall place. Everybody's happy. Mostly hoodies who live around Geary B. coming back from their jobs fresh of the dreary thirty-eight. Better to get there a little later to miss the crowds. Order some hot sake or an Asahi Dry. Then browse the menu. Maybe pick two or three of the interesting rolls (Dragon Roll or Spicey Tuna), and 3-4 Nigiri, it's all fresh.

I can honestly say that this is it right here. \n\nAfter viewing the Yelp pictures, I decided to take a plunge with the gf. \n\nI was a little fearful that the place would be super packed on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving even with reservations since the place was claimed to be small. A 7:30 reservation proved not to be a problem since the restaurant was only halfway full. Though the place got increasingly packed and when we did leave, there were actually two people that were waiting. \n\nThe 1849 oysters are to die for with the lovely combination of quail egg, uni, tobiko, and yes fish eggs. yummm.\n\nSunrise was good on presentation, two pieces of salmon wrapped around a ball of rice, with a quail egg to top off.\n\nThere was one roll (forget what its called) but it had smoked salmon and it was soooo good, mainy cuz smoked salmon is good in and of itself.\n\nCeviche roll is a must try, do it without the soy sauce. It's already got a sour tang to it. \n\nToro Tartare was uber good (would have preferred without the black pepper but it was still all good!)\n\nYou may want to order 4-5 plates a person if you actually want to get full. Almost everything comes in pairs. \n\nIt's all very pricey when you're rollin out $3 a piece as opposed to say $1.50, but it's definitely worth a try at least occasionally as chances are you won't see anything else like it in 95% of the other sushi places. It's alll very worth it and it's not even like it's a pretentious place with fancy decor or anything. Just a modern setup with one of a kind sushi. \n\nFunny thing is, during the end of our meal, the couple sitting next to us was talking about Yelp and I only caught snippets of the conversation.

Then we offered to pay for another couple's meal with the remaining $80 which was shot down as well.  The owner said, \"you just can't pay for someone else's meal like that,\" whatever that's supposed to mean.  I guess he doesn't know the meaning of altruism.\n\nI finally asked the owner \"how can we use the remaining $80,\" and he had no answer - which meant to leave it as tip.  Seriously dude, WTF.

We got there on a Saturday night and it took about 15 minutes to get seated for two, but it would be hard to get a large party seated here.\n\nI can't remember exactly what I had but I recommend the Tazmanian salmon whole heartedly, if salmon had a toro equivalent, this would be it. It was fresh and buttery and tasted just right. We also had the halibut ceviche which was different but tasty. I thought it might be too sour to complement the sushi rice and nori but it was perfect. The butter fish (escolar)  was also amazing and super fresh as all the fish was. Lastly we had the toro tartar which was served with a mint leaf of some sort, it was also highly recommended. I'm not sure what was in it, but all I saw was the words \"toro\" and I was sold. I really do appreciate the fact that they put their entire menu online so you can salivate and plan before you get there.\n\nThey also remind you when not to eat something with soy sauce which I find amusing, and they have a female sushi chef  with cute hair, you know the important things. The presentation here is pretty awesome and it wasn't too hard on the wallet. I thought we'd spend at least $50 a person, but when the tab came out it was about $35 before tip. Not too shabby. I would give it 4.5 because I thought the croquette, and sweet shrimp were just average, along with the cramped quarters, but it gets five for creativity and presentation. Plus it's right down the block from where I usually stay. Oh also, love that they have a tea selection.", "author": "Crystal T."}

The odd hours, random spontaneous appetites can work in your favor. Witness today, New Year's Day 2009. We rolled out of bed well after noon, and ended up in the Outer Richmond around 4:30 when our first hunger pangs kicked in. Kabuto opened at 5. Perfect.\n\nWe got in and scored a seat at the bar, which was quite open. 1.5 hours later, when we left, the place was packed and a fierce mob had gathered outside, waiting to get in.\n\nService was polite and efficient. Atmosphere is, well, it's probably the only element you can really knock the place for. It's not bad, it's just not a factor, really.\n\nBut the food is outstanding. We ordered the Hamachi Pear and Katsunagi off the special rolls menu. Hamachi Pear was what it sounds like, topped with a dollop of Kabuto's special mustard sauce. We tried this without soy sauce. It provided an odd delight to the taste buds. Good stuff. The Katsunagi, well, we can't remember what was in it. Unagi, presumably. There was some tempura-ing going on, and it was all rolled up hand-roll style. Delicious.\n\nWe also got a Dragon Roll, which I can only say was solid and so, so good, and a spicy tuna roll, which was average.\n\nNigiri was ordered a little late, after the restaurant got packed, so it took a little too long, but that's understood.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this place up there with Shimo as best sushi in the Richmond.", "author": "Jeff H."}

My favorite was the Toro Tartar, which is two pieces of chopped raw tuna mixed with avocado, deep fried seaweed, and onion. Another favorite was the Ceviche, which consists of halibut and salsa wrapped with deep fried seaweed and served with lime and sea salt.

Their specialty Nigiri, if you could call it that, ranges from Duck to Ceviche, both of which are on my top 5 list of favorite foods.  \n\nThe wine list is decent, with a solid range of various sakes, but no sushi meal is complete without the large Sapporo.   The service is very friendly and the sushi chefs speak more than one langauge. (The younger guy spoke to me in Spanish. It confused the hell out of me)  The one thing you might complain about is the price, but it is worth every cent (especially when our fish stocks are being depleted so quickly that there won't be any sushi left by 2050).  \n\nPerfect for a date, an anniversary, or a small group outing (no more than four).", "author": "Charley B."}

The omakase is heavy on hamachi... Hamachi is not only for novice sushi eaters but it was your B-quality hamachi (mmm... maybe C).  Most of the fish served have no flavor.  Kabuto has also attempted to fancy up their sashimi dishes ala Nobu-style. Sadly, it falls flat.  Just b/c you place a jalape\u00f1o and a small slice of Asian pear with yuzu sauce will not make it good unless you use high-grade hamachi.  A few diners next to us kept raving about the food.  That and the the people waiting for a table belie the fact how average sushi can still be a good business model in the Richmond...  Sad but understandable.  Not all dishes fell flat.  Out of the 10 dishes that came out, two had interesting flavor profiles yet low quality fish tempered what could have been.  The only highlight was the wait staff.  Eager, hardworking young Korean girls despite their confusion and mixing up the orders.  I would not be so disappointed if the final tab was 1/2 of higher quality Japanese restaurants.  Alas, it was about the same.  Sorry to be so hard on this place but this place would fail in Japan.  No experienced sushi eater should come here.

(It was Details ok...but the GQ wannabe Details, not the frat version of Details.  Oh the shame!)  That meal was awesome.  Then the place closed down.  My buddy told me that the chef owner had decided to hang up the skates and call it a career.  Then about 4 months ago, I noticed that Kabuto seemed to be open again.\n\nThe girlfriend and I were going to a movie at the Bridge, so we decided to grab something relatively close.  I suggested that we try the new Kabuto.  We got there around 5:15 and the place was empty.  We timed it well, because about 10 minutes after we sat down, the place filled up like Bonds' head after a session with Greg Anderson.  We were jammed in between two other couples in the small doubles table.  I hate that.  Whenever I get sardined that way, I feel a need to lower my voice to an almost inaudible level because I am afraid of disturbing my neighbors.  \n\nThere were two menus, one of \"special\" items and the other of more traditional fare.  We quickly tossed the special menu because I remembered that the special items were small and weird...like the mozzerella sushi.  We went for the Dragon Roll, toro roll, spicy tuna, and hamachi.  They had aji nigiri on their special menu, but the very nice waitress informed us they were out.  Damn it all to Hell!\n\nI really enjoyed the spicy tuna.  They made it spicy by plopping some kind of hot sauce on top.  I think that is cheating, but I iked it anyway.  The Dragon Roll stood out among the sushi that we ordered.  I enjoyed.  The girfriend did not.  We started the meal with some seaweed salad.  Kabuto does not serve what I am used to when I order wakame salad.  Kabuto's was a regular green salad with much bigger seaweed.  The dressing was excellent, but I was not too keen on the seaweed.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, the new Kabuto did not measure up to the old Kabuto.  Good, but not great.

The toro tartar was mouthwatering served perfectly on little bits of sushi rice topped with delicious caviar.

Fresh sea scallops were one of the highlights from the evening served two ways- sashimi and a scallop amuse bouche. 1894 oysters were outrageous they were topped with buttery uni, a silky quail egg, black and red caviar and then topped with flecks of gold to impress. Hamachi with jalapenos is something I have had at many places but Kabuto's was delightful with large, thick slices of hamachi.

Looks like I will have to face the fact that the cats out of the bag and it has been for a while. Its obviously no secret anymore as the tiny restaurant is packed to the gills on a Wednesday night. Well...they do say denial is not just a river in Egypt. \n\nWe started with the seaweed salad which is a different take on the usual mound of bright green seaweed with a few sesame seeds sprinkled on top. It was fresh seaweed atop a mound of greens and garnished with sliced grapes and cherry tomatoes. Yum! \n\nAll of the fish is exceptionally fresh and artfully presented. We enjoyed the hamachi pear, kastunagi, salmon, escolar, amberjack, yellowjack, and unagi. The abalone and king mackerel were fresh but I didn't enjoy the firmness of the mackerel or the crunchy cartilaginous texture of the abalone. It was like a giant clam but crunchy. Ick. \n\nThe sake list is long and the sapporo is flowing. Its a great place to enjoy better than average sushi.", "author": "Stacy T."}

The waitress apologized, and said a 'better' table will come up shortly.  I think sitting at a table instead of waiting like 20 more minutes is better right?\n\nSecond, it took us over 2 hours to complete our meal.  The food takes forever to come out and it comes out at the most random waves.  At one point, we had to wait an hour to get three orders.  I mean we didn't even eat that much and it took 2 hours.  In fact, after waiting, we built up an appetite, and ate somewhere alse right after leaving this place.\n\nThe staff actually seems like they don't care at all.  I can't believe they can stay in business this way.  The staff just hangs out and talks to each other instead of serving people and making food.  I would understand the poor service and the wait time if the place was really busy, but it was about the close and was only half full.\n\nNot once were they perceptive enough to see that i needed more water and more ginger.  I had to ask them each time.\n\nThe prices were a bit on the expensive side as well.  I wouldn't really mind spending this much money on food, if the service was good.  It's like it didn't matter to them we were spending our hard earned cash on it.  \n\nFood wise, it was decent.  The bluefin tuna was discolored an unattractive and an unappetizing brown.  \n\nAnyway, I give it a 1 star, because of the incredibly bad service.  This place's staff is incompetant and indifferent to the customer's needs.  I really want to stress that.\n\nWe went there for the good zagat reviews, but i think the new ownership doesn't understand how to run a sushi restaurant.\nI'm willing to bet it doesn't get high marks from Zagat in 2007.", "author": "Jung L."}

Was not disappointing - our culinary trip went everwhere from toro to Tasmanian salmon. Awesome, melt-in-your mouth fish. Spectacular presentation - one of the sushi chefs used a blowtorch on a special salmon roll to partially cook it right in front of everyone.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-10-02", "description": "From the mouthwatering food to the endearing old Japanese chef/owner behind the sushi bar, this cozy little restaurant in the Richmond district has solidified itself as my favorite Japanese restaurant in San Francisco. \n\nIn a world filled with hip sushi restaurants focused on complicated, over sauced rolls and fancy sake cocktails, the simplicity of Kabuto makes for a refreshing and much welcomed sushi dining experience. Despite having a menu filled with fresh & traditional Japanese sushi/dishes, the 2 things I could never live without here would be the Toro Tartar special sushi and the Ceviche special sushi. \n\nThe Toro Tartar is a melt-in-your-mouth masterpiece of negi-toro and avocado on a bed of rice and crispy seaweed, topped off with a perfectly fried shiso leaf. It's important to remember to eat this sushi as is. The use of soy sauce or wasabi is highly discouraged by the waitresses and the chefs... but for good reason!\n\nWhen you're done savoring every last bite of the Toro Tartar, clear your palate for the refreshing delicateness of the Ceviche. Served up in 2 piece orders, you'll find yourself ordering in bulk for these light and citrusy halibut sushi pieces. They come to your table looking like little mounds of chopped sashimi goodness on top of a single piece of seaweed, and end up tasting like pure heaven with a dash of lime to keep things unique.\n\nAll in all, Kabuto is an amazing restaurant with fresh ingredients, cozy decor and brilliant sushi.

It was across the street in the old location, Sachio still owned it and would for another seventeen years or so.   If you didn't eat at the bar they had table service on tatami mats and would bring everything out on huge boards and with sake flowing it was all very festive.\n\nFor years my wife and I would go there or I would pick up a to go order on the way out to the Sunset; the waitresses were helpful and delightful and Sachio was always there with a big hello and a loud thank you very much on the way out the door.  The fish was, and still is, as fresh as it can get; three kinds of Maguro regularly, and if you asked what was freshest you'd get the straight read, also drop some freebees on the board when crowded.\n\nThe new place is entirely different but the fish is just as good.  Lots of new menu items, things your kids will eat if they can't get behind raw fish.  The atmosphere is not close to being the same without Sachio, but they did have a female sushi chef a while back so that was good to see.  The line is out the door but its worth the wait.

They're completely different in decor and class, but what they have in common is great sushi.  Kabuto is very tiny with only about 6 or 7 tables total.  There is a small sushi bar which seats maybe 6 or 8 additional people.\n\nThe fish is the draw here which is very fresh, possibly the freshest in the city.  The selection is extensive with all the standards: tuna, salmon, yellow tail, mackerel, eel, etc.  Plus they have daily specials offering more exotic and unusual fish.   The menu also includes traditional and more \"nouveau\" raw seafood creations.  For those that don't get into raw seafood, Kabuto also offers standard cooked Japanese items - tempura, katsu, donburis, gyozas, etc.  \n\nThe decor is very basic.. sort of a whole in the wall Japanese.  So, if you're looking for a hip, trendy place, go to Ozumo.  \n\nIt's very hard to get into this little gem and parking is difficult in C. Richmond.

(See my review of Sushi-Gen in Little Tokyo,LA)  That experience changed my view of sushi completely as I will never eat sushi in the same light again.  By this I mean I don't even want to order fancy type rolls anymore as the closest I will come to that is spicy tuna or something simple like that.  I now like my sushi simple which is just the taste of the fish and rice.  \n\nWith that said, this was the first time I ordered an all nigiri meal.  I would only do this at renowned places and after reading the reviews here I decided this would be the place to do it.  I sat at the bar and looked at the quality of the fish and it seemed to agree.  So off I went on my sushi journey.  BTW, they have very interesting special rolls which I will definitely try next time.  I just want to judge a place solely on the quality of their fish w/o having it masked by tons of sauces and what not.\n\nI had toro, kampachi, hamachi, hon maguro, akamutsu, and sunazuri.  All were delectable and very tasty.  One thing that I did like is that I could order by piece so that enabled me to try a lot of different fish.  That was awesome.  Usually most places make you order two pieces of nigiri.\n\nAs far as service goes, it was good.  It was weird not being able to order through the sushi chef even though I was sitting at the bar.  But whatever, just give me good fish.  And speaking of sushi chef.  I totally fell in love with the female sushi chef.  I've never seen a female one before and she was very, very, cute so that made for a much better experience.  Unfortunately she wasn't the one making my sushi.  I'll definitely be back again for the fish and the sushi chef.", "author": "Ben M."}

CLEAN, from the plates to the cups to the clean table and counters. Hey, I've been to some really janky places.\n\n* Service - Our plates were taken away as soon as we were done with each dish.  Because we were sitting at the sushi bar with limited space, that was greatly appreciated by us.  In addition to being efficient, our servers were very polite and friendly as well.  Always a big plus in Asian restaurants.\n\n* Food - aaaahhh...the best part of the meal, of course.  We had the foie gras sushi and holy crap it was amazing.  The sushi chefs managed to combine two of my favorite things in the world, Foie Gras and Sushi.  Like they sat around, brainstorming on what people like me fantasize about and BAM - they came up with Foie Gras sushi!  Another one of our favorites tonight was the Ceviche.  It was sushi with some kind of fish (it was so yummy, I forgot what kind), to be eaten WITHOUT soy sauce.  I didn't think I could do it at first, but once it hit my tongue, I was in heaven.

I've been searching the city for good fresh sushi that won't break my bank and I've finally found it! \n\nTheir menu is CREATIVE and has tons of choices from traditional to fusion-ey!\n\nTheir food is YUMMMEEE! Here's what to get--\n\nSunrise roll: Fresh salmon wrapped around sushi rice and topped with a raw egg yolk and tobiko. Beautiful and deeelicious!\n\nCeviche: This is not your ordinary ceviche but its so good! It's actually sushi rice, halibut, and a little bit of their \"salsa\", and you wrap a seasoned piece of nori (seaweed) around it. If you order one thing, order this!\n\nSonoma Duck- thin slices of tender duck (cooked), served nigiri style (slice ontop of sushi rice). It was good, but not the best. Watch out for the spicy miso hiding under the sushi...it will definitely clear up your sinuses!\n\nToro Tartar- Doesn't taste like toro to me but it was still very good-- kind of like a normal tuna tartar, but it was REALLY good here. Some places mess up their tartars with fruit and too many flavors, this one was seasoned just enough to let the fish shine through.\n\nClams in broth- Not your usual MSG soup, very mild. In my opinion could use a little more salt, but still good. \n\nPRICES- Pretty darn good price for what you get- 3 people, one bottle of sake ($7), $105. \n\nDownsides- small restaurant (about 7 tables and a sushi bar) and super cramped! Plus we made a reservation but still had to wait 25 mins and got sushi bar seats, not a table. And you feel rushed when you're eating b/c people are waiting outside in the cold for your table!\n\nAltogether-Go here for goood, fresh, creative sushi.

After the first time visit, it's not disappointed at all.  Food wise, this place deserves a 5 stars actually.  I ordered the omakase, and most of the food on the list are impressive.  Some highlights are 1849 Oyster, Ceviche and Hamachi Pear, which are pretty inline with what others recommended in their reviews.  Here is why the one star was dropped off.  First, the menu is a bit dirty.  It's just a piece of paper, why can't they print a new one...Second, the service is a bit rush.  It's not like they have bad attitude, but all the dishes just came out so fast, so we couldn't really pace our dinner and felt kind of rush to finish off the food before the table ran out of space.  I think it's due to that they are kind of in rush to serve the next round since people are waiting outside, which can be understood, but it will be better if they can just slow down a little bit.  Overall, I will still highly recommend this restaurant since I have already started to miss the sushi there the day after.", "author": "Bryan W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-05-21", "description": "Let me preface this review by saying that I am in no way a \"foodie,\" sushi snob or one that likes to complain.\n\nI've been to Kabuto a couple times before, but I probably won't go back again, even though it's only three blocks from my house.  \n\nPart One:\n\nI met my bf there around 9pm on Friday night.  I had put my name on the wait-list and we chilled for a while.  Literally.  It was windy and cold outside and we ended up waiting at least 45 min. for a table.  As I walked inside to check on the wait, another couple waltzed right in and took the next open table.  After asking one of the waitresses why they got a table right away, she explained that they had made a reservation and because of a late flight they couldn't make it on time.  No apology or \"sorry for the long wait.\"\n\nFirst of all, I don't understand why such a small restaurant has both a reservation system and a wait-list.  It's unfair to those who wait if someone comes an hour late for their reservation and can take a table that someone had waited almost an hour for.\n\nPart Two:\n\nAfter FINALLY getting a table (the people that were seated there before us had finished eating about 30 min. prior to leaving), my bf ordered some miso soup and tea for himself and I ordered a large Sapporo for us to split.  (Our waitresses wrote it all down and specifically said she would bring two glasses for the beer.) The waitress came back with two bowls of miso soup and nothing else.  We told her that we had only ordered one order of soup.  She asked us about three times if we were sure and then told us she had to go \"check in the back\" and took both bowls back with her.  She came back with one bowl and then we had to remind her about the rest of our order.  She came back with the Sapporo and ONE glass.  Not off to a good start.\n\nNext, we got a bowl of wasabi and ginger with a hair in it.  Had to wait about five minutes to even catch the attention of our waitress.\n\nHere's the sushi we ordered:\n\n- Albacore and salmon nigiri: rice was dense and mushy\n- Pear habachi: pretty tasty and loved the mustard sauce\n- California roll: didn't look or taste fresh\n- Spicy tuna roll: would have been fine except for the odd chili sauce on top\n- Unagi and avocado roll: Unagi is normally my absolute favorite sushi roll, but this was way too chewy and flavorless.\n\nWe paid our bill, left a 10% tip (which was generous) and didn't get any kind of thank you, have a nice night or even a smile.\n\nWe looked at our watches: 11pm.  TWO hours to eat a meal that should have taken half an hour.  Good thing we didn't make plans for after dinner.\n\nIn short: \n\nHaving only two waitresses for the entire restaurant (no bussers) slowed everything down.  They also need to work on faster turnover and politely getting people to leave faster (no lingering dinner parties chillin' at the table for an extra 30 min. to chat).\n\nAside from a couple pretty good rolls, the sushi was not good.  The menu is unique, but they really need to work on their service!", "author": "Emily H."}

Good portion, well grilled. \n\nSunrise- Salmon sashimi wrapped around some rice with an egg yolk in the middle. The egg further elaborates the freshness.Another winner of the table!

The fine attention to detail, and meticulous crafty work these sushi chefs prepare are amazing.  The fish is consistently super fresh.  Quite possibly one of the best sushi experiences I've had since the memorable meal at Sushi Roku in Hollywood.  The saba is carefully prepared and always a delight to eat.  I'm not sure where they get their toro, but man, its the best in the city so far.  Some of the specialty pieces weren't memorable, and didn't do much for me.  I usually stick with the traditional menu.  The head sushi chef moves with a zen-like attitude; calm, precise, and authoritative.\n\nThe tamago was most enjoyable.  I was trained with the understanding that a tamago is the last skill the sushi chef is taught and first to be judged upon his skill set.  The tamago takes skill to make, and every sushi chef has their style.  In this case, I love the style of the tamago here, with the traces of green seaweed embedded in the egg mixture. A delight of a morsel that must be had.\n\nOrdering straight to the sushi chef is what I usually do, and getting info on the specials and products, but these guys don't really take orders directly from the customer.  They seem really concentrated on the work, and not wanting to be bothered. Orders given to them are usually relayed to the waitress and punched into the tickets.  I guess its their way of keeping sanity.  The guy in the middle seems to move like he's on speed. His slices come out uneven, which irks me. Maybe he doesn't want to be buried by the tickets.  The anti-social wall defeats the purpose of having a good time at the bar, but hey, not every great sushi chef does the mingling.  \n\nStill, the plates are beautiful, the portions are generous and the quality of the food hits the yummy mark.  Stick with the traditional pieces, as a few of the specials mask the flavor of the fish.  The hamachi pear was most memorable of the specials i've tried, and the rest I don't even remember.

This is the place for some of the most amazing special sushi I have  had.  We always end up ordering more and repeats, and they have some classics such as ceviche, Toro tartar, hamachi pear, \"fire salmon\" etc.  I also love their grilled yakimono and ippnryouri.  We have tried their nigiri and sashimi and are good, but always stick to the specials. \n\nThe fish is  very fresh and the presentation beautiful. Servers and the chefs are very nice. If you are looking for an affordable nigiri, there are other restaurants. If you want an amazing experience, and fantastic tastes with special sushis and hot dishes, this is the place...

Although not mentioned in many of the reviews the tuna belly hand roll is another really good choice. The place alternates between being completely packed and somewhat empty over the course of the eight or nine times I have been here so making a reservation can't hurt if your group is bigger than two.

I went there with my friend, and we ordered, 2 nigiri, Hamachi kama, kinpira, and 2 special roles. The total came out to be around $70 and with tips, it'll be $40 to $45 dollars per person. I was pretty full by the time I left so most people wont spend that much at Kabuto.\n\nPrice and Volume:\nCharges avg price for sushi but some smaller home made dishes are too expensive for its volume.\n\nService:\nSlow, slow, slow!! 1 waitress was always standing at the back doing nothing while the restaurant was filled with customers.\n\nAmbiance:\nVery small and you might find it uncomfortable since you will be surrounded by other customers. Table near the door should be removed as well because it's annoying.\n\nNotes:\nOverall, you will be satisfied for your dine at Kabuto. But since you have to wait a bit to get your food, you have to be patient. Avoid early hours and come by after 8pm or so. It'll be less busier and you will be served much faster.", "author": "Shumi S."}

Other highlights were ankimo sushi, saba, hamachi pear, toro, hamachi belly, uni, ceviche suchi, 1849 oysters, spicy mussels and anago.  We had to order another anago because it was so good, the fish was crunchy on top and it was lightly sauced and there were no bones.

My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time the other night and we enjoyed everything we ordered. We had the sashimi plate (I'm a huge fan of sashimi so I'm being biased here) and with a touch of sweet soy sauce it tasted great and fresh. A must try is the Ceviche--it's not your run-of-the-mill ceviche folks--this is halibut w/ a dollop of salsa and lime sitting on fried seaweed. We loved this one so much we ordered a second one. We were told by a patron sitting next to us to let the ceviche sit for a few minutes so that the lime juice can run down and infuse the halibut and rice. I would go back just to have this and the sashimi again.\n\nThe menu is by far the most unique I've ever seen in a sushi bar but I warn you, when it comes to sushi I'm a neophyte. I was never a fan of sushi before I came to live in SF. I was really impressed with the presentation and service. It's a great date place or for a special occasion w/ 2-4 friends.\n\nI docked a star b/c I was surprised at the portions (small compared to other sushi places I've frequented) and the prices.  I would not recommend going after 7 PM or if you're going with a party of more than 4. The place is super small (typical of outer Richmond restaurants).

For instance I had their himachi pear happened to have a drop of the most disgusting spicy mustard I've ever put in my mouth.  I was enjoying my dragon roll but after I took one bite for the first time ever I thought I was going to yak inside the restaurant.  The worst part about my experience was the worst service in my life.  I think because I used this coupon they decided to completely not wait on me I waited 10 minutes then finially put my jacket on, then I waited 5 more minutes for a check and eventually got up and chased the server down (only like 3 other tables were full). In addition I never once got asked if I would like to order more or have my water refilled.  Also for the first time in my life I tipped under 10 % which is very hard for me to do.

Okay, so there's a caveat: when in Japan, we could not afford the good expensive sushi restaurants, so we only ate at the kaitan (conveyor belt) sushi bars.  But seriously, the sushi here at Kabuto was phenomenal.  I don't normally like tuna, but the blue fin tuna here was mild (not fishy) and so melt-in-your-mouth good.  We also tried the butter fish; a seared toro (fatty tuna seared by a blow torch); a ceviche that comes on small seaweed paper; escolar (super white tuna); a salmon from Tasmania (normally salmon is my favorite but this was too bland IMO--a disappointment); sea urchin (which melted like saltwater on our tongues); yellowtail dressed with pear and hot mustard (the pear and mustard combo was really palatable but I thought it overwhelmed the yellowtail so was not a good complement); foie gras sushi (a slab of foie gras atop sushi rice with a little raspberry on top--this was so creative and delicious); and bits of eel that came dressed in chocolate and bits of pear and foie gras all in a mini martini glass (also very creative and delicious--the chocolate made for a good substitute for the normally sweet eel sauce that comes on unagi--but the presentation seemed a bit forced when inside a martini glass).  All in all, this was a good mix of the classically delicious with the interestingly creative sushi.  Loved every bite.  The three of us ate all of the above and shared a large Sapporo, and the bill came out to be $180, making each sushi somewhere between $4 and $8.  Not what I'd normally pay, but we were on vacation, and anything goes.  So worth it for a splurge, especially if it was the best sushi I'd ever had.", "author": "Christine H."}

I have also tried many regular sushi menu items yesterday and all of them were really fresh, especially Escolar.  Overall Im fully satisfied with their food.  \nHere are a few downside about this place.  This place is usually really crowded.  Full house at 8:30pm on a Tues night, but with only 2 waitresses.  The food were really slow.  Also this place can be very pricey.   We had 3 people, ordered a few bottles of beer and sushis on the special and the regular menu and the total was about $350 including tips.  Although it is totally worth the price, but it is not a place where I can come regularly to satisfy my constant hunger for sushi.  The last con about this place is this place is really hard to find parking on Geary.\n\nBut overall, this place is highly recommend and I am a fan.

In general veggie sushi consists of boiled vegetables coupled with cucumber and/or avocado. \n\nBut Kabuto. Mmm, Kabuto.  They have a variety of nigiri veggie sushi that really floats my boat. The japanese pumpkin is lightly roasted. The enoki mushrooms are slightly crunchy. Lots of choices and so well done. All the pieces I've tried have been wonderful. And the price for the veggie nigiri is super reasonable ($1.25 - $2.50/ piece)\n\nTheir dengaku (broiled eggplant with miso sauce) comes out hot, with the smooth texture and sweetness of the miso matching so well with the eggplant. Man. delicious. \n\nGo here even if you don't eat fish!", "author": "C M."}

But boy was I disappointed .. looks can be deceiving !! The taste didn't match up to the looks ! I came here just yesterday with three friends . We ordered the baby main lobster , toro tartar , sushi mozzarella , and the crepe sushi . The baby main lobster seemed to lack flavor , the toro tartar was too salty & overpowered with flavor . I don't remember regarding the sushi mozzarella and crepe sushi but they obviously weren't that good either because the taste didn't leave an impression on me . The 1849 oysters were okay but too salty and overpowered with flavor . At first I thought the gold stuff was not edible so I picked it out but later on , my friend told me it was edible ): . The grilled spicy mussel SUCKED . It was a total miss ! The sauce that it was made in didn't even taste good !! It was not creamy one bit ! The jalapeno yellowtail was pretty good . I like the sauce on the plate that it came with . My favorite was this one dish with four pieces sashimi ( I forgot what it was but it's white ) and it's dipped in some kind of green sauce . It was very tasty !! We ordered a lot of different kinds of  sashimi which tasted okay . The green tea creme brulee was okay but too sweet . I really want to give this place 4 stars .. 3 for the so-so food and 1 extra one for the creativity and presentation of the food because it takes a lot of effort & time to make each dish pretty but I can't . Why ? Because :\n\n1) The glass cups had a dish cleaner taste to it when I was drinking their beer\n2) The special sushi was expensive .. $ 5 - 8 for only two pieces that didn't even taste all that great ! So what if it looks pretty ! Looks aren't everything !!\n3) After ordering and eating ALL that crap above , I was still not even close to being fulll ! Note that only me & one of my other friends was eating .\nI guess this is a nice alternative to dessert and nice if you haven't seen their special rolls before but I would not recommend coming here for dinner if you're hungry or have cravings for sushi .", "author": "Eileen L."}

It's pair with the usual sweet citrus glaze. However, the second time I ordered this they skimped on the size of the foie gras, but it was still delicious. $9 for two bites. Your call if it's worth it to you.\nTORO TARTARE: Not as flavorful as the hamachi tartare, but almost as good and is more mellow in flavor.\nHAMACHI PEAR MUSTARD: It was like a wonderful light pear mustard salad. A little tang from the mustard, a little sweetness from the hamachi, a little texture from the pear.\nSASHIMI COMBO PLATE: very affordable ~$23, very fresh fish. What more can you ask for.

The food was not spectacular, very normal and not bad, but not as good as worth the price they were charging. For that price, I could have thought of at least four or five sushi places I rather be eating at.  Not that much selection in terms of raw fish.. a lot on their \"special\" board was already gone.. (but we went at like 6:30pm)... so go figures!\n\nThen, there's all the fancy named combo plates you can get... I got the \"Valentine\" for $8. It was unagi and liver with some chocolate sauce.  It was not that good... especially for tiny bits of food in two martini glasses. It looked nice and good presentation, but where's the food?? I thought I came to eat and not just look!!\n\nSo, then there was the Hamachi kama (jawline of the fish) that we ordered that really pissed me off... I have had many, many Hamachi kamas and the one we got was the most burnt kama I have ever seen in my entire life time.  The black burnt parts of the kama could have given me an acute case of cancer.  Naturally, I told the waitress about it, and that waitress ignored my comment and then just went to tell this other older waitress about my comment.  The older waitress came over and said that's how it is. That a kama has to be burnt to be cooked thoroughly. And she insisted in her demanding and not-very-polite tone, \"try it, try it\"... I thought to myself, I guess you're not going to change our dish.  I proceeded to take out all the burnt parts of the kama and not much was left. I don't cook kama, but having ate kama at so many restaurants where it is cooked the exact same way, you would think there's no argument that the kama I had was pretty burnt. \n\nSo instead of trying the kama and risking cancer as the waitress suggested, I skipped the kama. The owner has the nerve to come by and ask about our dish. I told him what happened, and all he could say was that he'll give us something for free (which turned out to be a small bottle of sake) and said that they had a limited supply of kama. \n\nThat was my service that night. We ordered a lot of food that night, and the bill came out to $120 for three person.. but I can't say there was anything I really enjoyed. \n\nTwo stars for the bad service and LACK of good food.", "author": "Lilian T."}

But I can't, especially since I like to eat about $50+ dollars worth of sushi each time here.  You can't help it, the menu brings tears to my eyes.  I love this place so much my husband and I came here for our two year anniversary.\n\nWhy do I love this place so friggin' much?\n1) FRESH: you can't get better quality fish than here.  Good test is the uni, I had not-so-fresh-uni once at Ritz Carlton in Hong Kong and I sent it back.  At Kabuto, I order four nigiri pieces each time FOR MYSELF. I'm not sharing =)\n2) Fish variety: not just run of the mill maguro and sake here, they have fish you don't find at the average sushi restaurant (e.g. escolar, kanpachi, abalone). \n3) Creativity: they don't just have normal nigiris and rolls, they have very creative ones that don't just involve fish.  My favorite non-fish is the foie-gras nigiri. Seared foie gras on top of sushi rice with a balsamic raspberry sauce top with half a raspberry.  Heavenly ... I order four pieces for myself, and I close my eyes to fully savor each and every piece.  People need to make sure they look at the separate special sushi menu.\n4)  Menu: large, and diverse.  There hot food is just as good.  Chawan Mushi is wonderful, udons and other soups are great on a cold day.  They also have a decent amount for vegetarians.  My vegetarian friend can order to her heart's delight here, you can't say that about very many sushi places.  I have had a few vegetable nigiris myself (Japanese pumpkin, enoki) Just as delightful.\n\nPlace is small so good chance you'll have to wait for a table.  To avoid that just go earlier or later in the evening.  But it's worth the wait.  If you want to go with a larger group make a reservation.  If it will just be two people, you can probably squeeze in at the sushi bar.", "author": "Helen C."}

When my first sushi experience ended rather poorly with my dinner, and a handle of Tequila, ending up all over my ex-bf's apartment during my 19th birthday celebration, I vowed I would never eat sushi again.  Then I moved to San Francisco.\n\nWhat started as a slow ease back into the land of raw fish has now resulted in an almost constant craving for the stuff - particularly, Kabuto.  This place manages to combine that intimate, almost hole-in-the-wall atmosphere with a truly delicious and creative menu.  The presentation flirts with a trip to the MOMA; from the plates of traditional rolls to the specials, it's almost painful to ruin the immaculate work of art before you. However, upon tearing it apart with your chopsticks you taste buds are rewarded with an often unique combination of flavors (enter CeViChe: halibut and salsa wrapped with deep fried seaweed and served with lime and sea salt; and my own personal favorite, Baby Maine Lobster).  The specials are amazing, and the traditional rolls never fail.  You'll pay a bit more for the specials, though it's well worth it.

We had the cruncy sushi (tempura halibut with a curry sauce) and another concoction - avocado, and unagi with raspberry sauce.  The latter wasn't really working for me.  Don't get me wrong - this sushi is artfully presented - almost too pretty too eat.  I understand the price point, but for two pieces of sushi per order, it just doesn't strike me as good value.  We tried a couple rolls from the regular menu as well, and they were just okay.  Our favorite dish was actually the cold soba noodles served with fresh greens and a nice tangy dressing.  We ordered it as an after thought when we realized that two of the special rolls we'd ordered amounted to four  small pieces. \n\nI think I'm a sushi purist - maybe that's the problem.  I probably won't go rushing back, unless I'm with friends and they say something like, \"I'm in the mood for sushi - but not the normal stuff, I want reinvented sushi - sushi with raspberry sauce, sushi with grapefruit!\"  Then...I'd have just the place.", "author": "Steve J."}

Up until the last time I went 1 year ago, I've had the most amazing meals and anyone I took was truly impressed.\nMy return trip last night not only confirmed that that Kabuto has gone down hill, but shocked and actually disgusted with how far it has fallen. I knew things had gone horribly wrong after we ordered and our waitress brought out the plates and a bowl of wasabi and ginger for our sushi. The wasabi and ginger were all crusted and brown like they had been sitting out for a day and dried a bit. I've never seen this before, even at the dirtiest and cheapest sushi restaurants. The actual meal was more of the same. I think the menu and recipes are the same but the quality of the ingredients has vastly diminished. The fish was not only lower quality but also not fresh. Some pieces also showed some drying from being exposed to air for some time. There were a couple things we ordered that were closer to what I remember of Kabuto but still fell short. The one highlight was a roll one of my diner companions invented, an uni and tako roll, really good.\nThe other not fun part was a truly rude, loud and annoying table of people beside us. But I understand these things happen and I don't reflect it on the restaurant.\nOverall, I don't think I will be returning. Thanks for some good memories.

I took my boss from Osaka, who is a huge foodie and connoiseur of Japanese food. We were promptly seated at the counter (that should've been a big red flag right there as with the previous owners the place was so packed you had to start lining up outside at 5PM when it opened!). We ordered edamame, a couple small plates, 2 sakes and the toro tartar salad to start. The tartar came out from the sushi bar side in minutes, before we had even gotten our drinks. It was a strange, gooey combination of minced, seared fatty tuna (toro) over some kind of slimey grayish green sauce which we were told was avocado. It was $15 and in my opinion a total waste of the toro. The flavors did not meld together well, and the luxurious taste and texture of the toro were lost. Next the burdock root dish came out, which was mediocre at best. We still had not gotten our drinks (about 15 minutes had passed). I reminded the scatter-brained waitress that we still needed our drinks and edamame (normally always first to come out ) and she replied with a curt semi-nod. No apologies, nothing. I should probably let you know that I'm half Japanese and was speaking to her in Japanese, and it's part of Japanese culture to apologize profusely when one has messed up or forgotten something, especially an \"okyaku-san\" (customer). Finally our drinks came out (still no edamame), so we were stuck with sake, but no \"tsumami\" (something to munch on while drinking), another big no-no in Japan. Finally we got so sick of flagging her down and complaining that we just asked for the check (at this point we had only gotten 2 of the 5 or 6 things ordered and our drinks). We were charged for everything we ordered (even what never came out) and 4 glasses of sake! We had to send the bill back TWICE for corrections and finally left disgusted and headed straight to Oyaji on 32nd and Clement where we had wonderful sashimi, sushi and sake. We'll never return to Kabuto again.", "author": "lani P."}

I swear to God, next time I'm going to Kabuto alone! The chef works at an almost manic pace, and he has an incredible sense of detail which is evidenced not only in the quality and innovation of his dishes but also in their presentation. The chef artfully uses real gold leaf, orchids, yellow dandelions and quail eggs to add to the beauty and the taste of his dishes. SOme of his dishes he finishes with a giant blowtorch - very godzilla-esque! I would pay money just to watch the Kabuto Iron Chef prepare his dishes for plating.

I've had much more expensive sushi, not that this place is a bargin, but for the money this place rocks.  Of course you got to be into not only really fresh traditional sushi, but their fusion stuff is to die for.                                      On my last visit I tried the Butterfish, Tasmanian salmon, adn Blue fin tuna for exotic fish.  Excellent, buttery, smooth, fresh fish taste, and great mouth feel ( for any cantonese) hau gum.  As I observed the hamachi pear sushi is the most popular, and rightly so, fresh hamachi with a thin slice of asian pear, and a dab of a homemade mustard chutney, its really a savory experience.  The toro tartare is to me the value dish, toro tuna with avacado and slightly peppery hint on a sheet of nori on rice, again really good, and only $5 for two pieces.  For the adventurous a lamb sushi that has roasted fuji apple, a rasberry balsamic sauce and nori/rice, great combination of flavors, and comes with a small side of spring salad infused with light balsamic dressing.                                                                                            I would recomend ordering your traditional sushi first before you dive into the exotic fusion offerings.  I usually finish with the fire salmon roll, like it's name has spicy sauce on it so eat it last to finish your meal wih a bang.  Definitely will be a place for me to hang out for awhile, as long as my piggy bank holds up, about 50-60 per person with a few beers, 40 if u go non-alcohlic.

I had also gotten the croquettes, and they were really cute... rolled into balls... I don't really like don katsu sauce usually and they had drizzled it over the croquette, but their katsu sauce wasn't that bad.  The meal was really good.  I don't think the chirashi was that much (usual price for chirashi is about 15-20 and it was in that price range)  but the specialty roll was like 11 bucks and it was the size of a nigiri.

One sushi place, however, does come close.   Before I go on, let me address my lovely San Franciscan friends: most of you get a little defensive when I make the LA-has-the-best-sushi claim. But hear these things: 1) The food overall is better in SF - better restaurants all around. 2) But LA is King of sushi. 3) My friend, Melissa, who has also had the pleasure of living in both cities, agrees with me. Mel, feel free to jump in here and get my back.   However, before being spoiled by LA sushi, Kabuto Sushi was my favorite. It's also considered SF's top sushi restaurant. I used to love watching Master Chef, Sachio, move in his odd mechanical way as he chopped fish, molded rice and slapped it gently together. And the sushi was to-die for. As my sushi chef friends down south have taught me, it's all about the balance between the rice, fish and sometimes seaweed. Sachio clearly hasn't lost the odd way in which he moves, but in my humble opionion he's now a little unbalanced.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-04-06", "description": "I have always meant to write a raving review about this restaurant.  It has always been one of our favorite in the city.  \n\nI've always meant to give it 5 stars.  For the type of clientele and market that they cater to, this is an amazing restaurant.  It's fresh, innovative, and absolutely clean and consistent.\n\nUntil now.\n\n(Background)\nWe eat here about twice a month (once every other week), sometimes more if we have guests and want to bring them in for a great sushi experience.  In fact, we're here so much, not only does the entire staff know us, but we've got the menu pretty much memorized; we always order our favorite:  Foie Grois sushi -- the only one I've found of its kind.  Mostly because of the sauce that goes on it.  Keep in mind, we've been going here for over 2 years consistently.\n\nTonight was a disaster.  We ordered \"to go\" for the first time, and had my husband pick it up.  Granted, I know sushi ordered \"to go\" will never be as good because the heat of the sushi rice will eventually heat up the fish (even a little bit).  But the technique and art that comes with their usual sushi was definitely lost tonight.\n\n1.  Foie Grois Sushi-  sauce was still awesome, but the foie grois was definitely burnt.  I understand that they're busy, but at $9.00/order, and it being one of their signature dish, someone better pay attention to their quality.\n\n2.  O-Toro Nigiri (fatty tuna)-  another favorite.  As soon as I opened the box, I knew something didn't look right.  If you've ordered this before, you know it'll look like a very soft smooth fish DRAPED over the rice.  This one came like it was a block chopped from a machine.  Edges were cut very straight, and the slice was VERY thick.  Chefs cut on a bias because there is an even distribution of fat layering you always go for in fishes, especially fatty tunas, which make the fish tender.  The grain on my fish tonight was vertical.  I'm not being a princess about this, but think about it:  As a business owner with very expensive and limited fish, you'd want to make sure that it's being prepared with the best attention.  As a patron, when you pay $10 each piece, then you expect quality.  and if you eat a BLOCK of raw fish, it definitely has a different \"taste\" than a slice of fish.  The slice of the fish has everything to do with the taste...which is why Sushi chefs take lessons or years to learn how to do it right.\n\nThere are usually three sushi chefs behind the bar, and each of them are amazing at what they do.  This leads me to believe that someone else behind the kitchen did the preparation.  \n\nAs my husband said, we've eaten there so many times that a bad night is bound to happen.  If this was an off-night in quality or staff courtesy, I would buy it.  The quality is still great, but as with all sushi, the preparation of the dish really makes or breaks it (this is why when we try to make sushi at home, it never \"tastes\" like they do in the restaurant).\n\nBut I'm bringing my review down to 3 stars because it was very irresponsible (as a business) to have someone else (without full training) handle the expensive fishes being served.\n\nWould I recommend it to the next person?\nABSOLUTELY!  Like I said, quality is always great, and we've never had a bad experience when we eat IN the restaurant.\nAnd like I said, the reason I'm knocking stars off my review is because of how they handled a busy night (by giving certain tasks to untrained staff).\n\nIf, however, the sushi was prepared by someone behind the bar, then please listen to my review and work on your consistency.", "author": "ny n."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-07-28", "description": "I don't know what the hype about this place it. It's over priced, the servings are small, even if you do make a reservation it seems like they think it's ok to call you a half an hour before it to tell you it's been postponed an hour AND it's in the Richmond. Now, I haven't had sushi in SF in quite sometime, cuz if I want sushi I go to TGI in Campbell, but apparently they don't give you free miso or salad. When I mentioned this the people I was with said most places in SF don't unless you're in Japantown, which is where I used to go with my gramma when I was a kid. This place isn't worth the effort you have to make to even find parking in the Richmond.", "author": "Brandi T."}

The hamachi pear, ceviche, toro tartar, ono grape, and jerry are simply amazing.  in addition to the perfectly-matched flavors, the presentation is top-notch.  buy the chefs a beer; they earn it.\n\nthis is easily my favorite restaurant in sf right now.  what's really funny is my girlfriend and i recommend it to people all the time, but no one will try it because its on 15th and geary.  there can't be good sushi outside soma or the marina, can there?\n\nthanks to yelp for helping us find this place.", "author": "alan e."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-06-25", "description": "I went here about 3 years ago when they were in the previous location.  I'll be the first to say that the sushi here is REALLY good.  There's not much atmosphere in the new location--quite small, kinda loud, but comfortable.  The only thing I take issue with is their prices.  I went there with a friend, really excited because I remember how great their fish was.  The prices on their menu seemed reasonable--$3-5 for nigiri and anywhere from $5-12 for their rolls.  They have some specialty apps that are also fabulous.  My friend and I ordered a pretty average size meal, maybe 3 orders of nigiri, a couple of rolls, and beer.  The bill came to a whopping $65.  When we asked why it was so high, they told us that the nigiri prices are priced \"per piece.\"  Who does that?  Logically then, if we placed \"an order\" of nigiri, they should bring us one piece; instead they automatically brought us two, without saying a word.  We didn't argue.  We just paid the bill (with a minimal tip) and decided never to go back.  I don't think they did it maliciously, but they should be crystal clear up front that their pricing is twice as much as most other sushi places in the city.  The fish is good, but not good enough to pay double the average.", "author": "Melinda G."}
