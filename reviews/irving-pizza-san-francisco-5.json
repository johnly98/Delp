For a one person order it took way longer then expected was good that I got to see it being made from the outside.\n\nHowever on the menu on the wall it was $9.00 the owner flat out charges me 9.75 now if he told me it was tax that would be fine but he flat out told me \"that is with the fries \" which was incorrect on the menu it literally said with fries for the Philly cheese steak is $9.00 again if he told me the 75 cents was tax that is a different story. I decided to let him charge me the extra 75 and I even let him keep the extra 25 cents since he was persistent on keeping my business and not going down the street to a cheaper place. \n\nThe Philly cheese steak and the pizza were really damn good my friend and his dad I asked them personally how they would rate the pizza and they both gave me the same rating, they both rate it a 4/5 and I agree with them wholeheartedly. However the quantity when it comes to the fries is freaking embarrassing man I cannot give this place a 5 because of it, the quantity was very small for the order as well as the fact that he charged me an extra 75 cents and I let him keep an additional 25 cents but yet they kind of short me on the fries and he dishonestly charges me extra when on the wall it says 9$ with fries? \n\nThat is why I am only giving a 4 star out of 5 still a damn good rating the fact that I got deliberately charged extra when on the menu it was showing 9$ again if it was for tax that is a different story but he didn't say that the 75 cents extra was for tax he said it was for the fries. So that irks me quite a bit.\n\nUnfortunately I won't be coming back just for that simple mistake unless they bother to attempt to do the same thing earn my business and all I'll give them that opportunity. On the flip side I did enjoy the pizza and Philly cheese steak and my friends enjoyed it as well.", "author": "R I."}

You're an idiot if you just get one slice that's been sitting out, and are fishing for quality in no mans land. Slices are for on the go, when you're expecting the lesser amount of quality. Although, I'm sure the slices are decent, don't go for the slices, trust me. This isn't your Golden Boy, that's a whole other pizza concept (disclaimed: I love Golden Boy). Order a whole pie and share it with friends. This pizza is my most favorite pizza in San Francisco. SimpIe, and made to order is always key. I don't know if it's just the impeccable accountability, but the reliability of the fact that this pizza is always fresh, perfectly rationed with pepperonis, and exposes the perfect amount of grease and love. It's damn good, and until you order one for yourself and eat it, take your negativity elsewhere. That crust to cheese and sauce ratio is fire, yo. Please stay open forever", "author": "Elizabeth K."}

I realize that they're related to the other Irving Pizza that is actually on Irving, but they seem rather attached to the name. This one is smaller than the Irving location. Between this location & the Irving location, Irving Pizza's delivery range covers about half the entire city, so that's commendable.\n\nWith just a couple of tables, it is more of a takeout counter. Get a slice or a whole pie if you want a snack, a meal, or need to satisfy a late night craving. \nThey also serve burgers, subs, and the obligatory salads. Surprisingly, they also have deep-fried Oreos. \n\nSlices are pretty large and start at $3. Whole pies are also pretty affordable. \nIf you can find inexpensive and filling food, it is a good reason not to cook. You were already trying to think of a reason not to cook on your way home from work anyway. \nPizza + wings = not cooking tonight.\n\nMr. Joy had grown up eating Irving Pizza, so he has ordered from here several times. To me, the pizza is okay, but it is a little chewy & flimsy. I mentioned that we hadn't been getting enough vegetables, so his solution was to order the Green Special with pesto, artichoke hearts, feta cheese, basil, & garlic. It probably didn't help our nutrition intake, but at least the artichoke hearts provide some roughage, and basil is good for something, but I can't remember what. \n\nAs for their wings, something is off. I have nothing against eating greasy fried foods. In fact, I enjoy them more often than I should, but these wings are no bueno. Maybe it's the heavy batter or dried out meat, but for lack of a better description, it nauseates me. You're probably reading this thinking, 'You're weird.' Yes I am.", "author": "Joy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-04-16", "description": "We tried this place out last night (well, early this morning) as one of the few late night options available within walking distance -- ordered to go through eat24.  Although their hours are listed as open until 4am, the person I spoke with (either the manager or the owner) told me they actually close at 3am and that attempts to have this updated in their yelp profile have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nI had the double bacon cheeseburger, my girlfriend had the Philly cheesesteak.  Both with fries.\n\nThe fries were pretty good, those big steak fries you used to get at places like Denny's or Lyon's before they started serving those shitty shoestring fries.\n\nMy burger: huge.  Two giant patties.  Unfortunately they were undercooked, more of something between rare and medium rare despite the fact I ordered it medium well.  Perhaps because the patties were so undercooked, the burger as a whole really didn't have that great burger flavor -- in fact, it was quite bland.  A couple bites in, and it tasted more like flavorless raw meat than a burger that had actually been cooked.  The bacon was also very hard.  The burger was a disappointment, but it certainly was large.\n\nHer cheesesteak was also a disappointment; the flavors were OK but the portion of actual cheesesteak goodness was very small, and the bun was burnt, hard, and crunchy.  The sandwich would've probably been tasty had the bun not been burnt, but unfortunately the flavors of the burnt-to-a-crisp bun heavily overpowered the otherwise tasty (albeit sparse) cheesesteak.\n\nOverall I'd say give this place a try if you're looking for a huge burger (but make sure they cook the meat properly), but definitely pass if you're looking for a good cheesesteak.", "author": "Michael G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-07-04", "description": "Pizza is good. Rating largely reflects experience ordering through Eat24. \n\nOrder submitted at 12:11am. \n\nReceipt shows server Mandez entered the order into Irving Pizza system at 12:51am. \n\nOrder delivery arrived at 1:40am. \n\nThis was my first experience ordering from Irving Pizza. An hour and a half from order to delivery is far beyond expectation set by other pizza places in the area. Reviewing the timestamp on the receipt it appears this may be related to not checking incoming orders in a timely manner. It's possible they were slammed at the time I ordered or they were understaffed tonight. A courtesy note to phone, email, or through Eat24 to confirm the delayed timing could have set expectation.\n\nReasonably timely delivery is critical with as many pizza options are available in the area. This was the high score in terms of how long I've ever waited for a pizza in the Sunset. I will be returning to other options that consistently turn around an order in under an hour.\n\nEdit: Lowered my review from two-stars to one-star. On reading other reviews for Irving Pizza there are MANY stories of extremely late delivery on pizza. This confirms my experience wasn't a one time incident, it's systematic. \n\nAvoid is the recommendation I would give to a friend.", "author": "David G."}

Tonight was my last straw. Let me preface my experience with the fact that the regular guy that mans the register is a total rude a**hole. But ok, whatever, he works in the TL and deals with some stupid bull that I personally have seen transpire previously. Somewhat excusable. This time, however, I arrived 15 mins after my grubhub order stated it would be available. (It's often later than expected) Upon arrival, a different than usual guy (seemed like he could be an owner?) told me he didn't have my order. Hmm well that's interesting being that I have the confirmation email and notifications from the app. He proceeds to question why I used grubhub (my card is already attached. But also why are you asking this? Your company signed up with grubhub). At this point I had walked down to get my pizza but did not bring my card or cash, because I had already paid through grubhub. Didn't think I'd need it. He asks if I have the card #. My partner texts the card # to me. I wait 20 mins for him to make said pizza. Doesn't work. I just waited for a pizza I should have already received. 45 mins after my order was stated to be ready, I left, disgruntled, with no pizza in hand and I will never return to this wretched place ever again.

I did not select the ASAP order, as they were quoting 45-60 minutes and I did not want the pizza arriving to early and it being cold for when he got home. \n\nThe order went through and was confirmed.

At 7:59, EAT24 responded and said they were pulling up the order.  At 8:05 the EAT24 rep was trying to \"get through the line\" (I guess calling the restaurant). At 8:09 he informs me that \"the rain has backed them up, and they will give me $5 off my order\" (now 40 minutes late). I then inform them I would like to just cancel my order.  At 8:10pm the rep says \"your driver will be arriving very soon, are you sure? I am just verifying for the restaurant\". I said, no please cancel.

Just before I leave, I check google maps and it says it would only be a 13 minute drive from the restaurant (with traffic), so I know there is not traffic in the city tonight.\n\nWe drive cross town, pick up dinner, head home, and as we are pulling into the garage, a call comes through at 8:47pm.  We pick it up, thinking it might be the restaurant calling to apologize. But no, it is the delivery driver saying he is outside our building with our pizza.

There was a young gentleman running the joint, and he was just on top of it, in the zone.

Friendly service on the phone, the Hawaiian I ordered came even more quickly than the 40 min. they'd estimated, and they don't charge extra for delivery.\n\nPizza itself was excellent, with noticeably fresh ingredients. My only quibble was that after the first few bites, something seemed to be missing. I peeled back the ham, bacon, pineapple & cheese on my first slice without seeing a speck of red sauce. I called, and the phone guy, sounding truly horrified at the idea of such pizza malfeasance, insisted there must be sauce. Sure enough, on further investigation, he was right, the rest of the pizza did have a little. Way too little, but it was there, and what there was of it was delicious.\n\nMore sauce in the future, please, and all will be well with the world. I'll be ordering from Irving again, and predict they'll deserve the full 5 stars.", "author": "MJ M."}

It took 75 min for french fried, one slice of pizza, deep fried Oreos and a can of soda. The only warm thing was the garlic fries, which were not evenly fried and the \"garlic\" was just a small scoop (maybe like a teaspoons worth) of not very fresh pre diced garlic that was just sitting on the corner of the box. SO disappointing. I paid an extra $2 for a teaspoon of unfresh garlic. Plus the pizza was cold, with essentially VERY little cheese under the toppings (which were minimal). And the fried Oreos were even colder, some over fried and some under. It's just a bummer because when I lived in the sunset I used to order from the Irving location almost weekly, and the food always arrived hot, on time or early, the pizza toppings were always hooked up and they had great customer service. I will never order from this location again, no matter how bad I'm craving deep fried Oreos lol. 0/10 would not recommend.", "author": "Evelyn M."}

Let me note that Eat24 is usually terrible but when I needed them in an emergency last time, they weren't too bad. Today, I ordered French fries, chicken strips, and the deep fried Oreos. I was very suprised about how warm the food was since I live by 1st street. Let me tell you, this was the best eat24 order but it was also the farthest place Ive ever ordered from. I've ordered from places very close only to have (literally) rotten, inedible food delivered to me. The chicken strips could be a lot better, to be honest. I never saw them cooked this way so I wonder if it's intentional or if they just don't know how to cook chicken strips. The rest of the food was pretty good. The fries are excellent and big. I wish they would've added the melted cheese I asked for but they're definitely worth getting. The Oreos are even better than I expected. It's a good thing they just give you 4! They are pretty oily so I recommend blotting them with a paper towel. I rate this place a 4 here but as far as Eat24 is concerned I rate them a 5. Eat24 is obnoxiously terrible but if you're in a pinch and have credit from prior orders, go with this place. The disappointment will be minimal.", "author": "Jackie K."}

Those of you who are coming here and expecting like, gourmet and high-end food are frankly just being whiny and spoiled. This is a place that's open until 2am, hot and almost always fresh. You can't complain about that! \n\nPizza is excellent, very customizable. I'm in love with the crust. It's obviously house made and cooked proper (at high temps) so that it comes out really rustic, rather than plastic-y tasting and so uniformly shaped that it's obviously frozen, like it can at other places. A+. \n\nNot feelin' pizza? Go for a philly cheese steak sandwich. They're soooo bomb. Meat is super tasty, and toppings are everything you'd expect them to be. I don't like their fries at all, too fluffy and not crispy enough for me, but fries are one of the things I get picky about in life. No worries, though, 'cause I can just get a side salad instead. \n\nFinally, the ranch dressing is worth noting. I'm from the South, where we tend to put ranch on everything, so I always get some on the side to dip my pizza in. Ranch is another thing I can get picky about, but I could eat theirs everyday. It's that good. Not sure if it's house made or not, but it's delicious. \n\nAll in all, Irving Pizza holds a special place in my heart.

Something forgivable in general but, upon delivery, the driver informed me that he'd given my order of fries to another customer by mistake. Frustrating, but he was genial and offered to take the fries off my order or come back and redeliver them. I asked him to bring the order of fries and proceeded to go about my lunch.\n\nI had ordered two salads, one greek with a side of italian, adding mushrooms, and the other a chef salad with a side of ranch and no olives. The greek salad was fine, but the chef salad was backwards as all get out. Olives everywhere, no mozzarella cheese when that's explicitly listed as a topping, mushrooms that aren't supposed to be there or listed as a chef salad topping, and italian dressing instead of ranch.\n\nRavenous, I dejectedly picked at the salad for a bit, then closed it back up. I called Irving Pizza and, after an excruciatingly long explanation of how they got the order wrong (and how I could prove it since it was written down), they offered me the correct salad or a credit. I was firm in asking for a refund and needed them to call Grubhub (I was at work, remember?). He said they might need to talk to me (not sure why, other restaurants make adjustments that charge me all the time, do they think I'd be angry at charges taken off my bill?) and that was that.\n\nA few minutes later, the delivery driver arrived with the fries I had ordered. I didn't tell him about the salad screw up, I figured it wasn't his fault and he had given effort to fix his mistake. I probably should have let him know though, as in the middle of eating the french fries I get a call from Grubhub asking me why I didn't return the salad. I told them I threw it away because the restaurant never asked for it back (truth, and I'm not sure what they would want with it anyway) and was adamant about getting a refund. They relented and I could finally go about my day.\n\nIn short, this Irving Pizza completely botched my order and, in concert with Grubhub, made very poor efforts to ameliorate their errors. I'm very disappointed in both businesses and surprised I had to be so forceful to get them to treat me like a valuable customer.", "author": "Josh S."}

So, worthy that my bf who's been on \"diet mode\" for the past week to save his tummy for Thanksgiving Day pig out next week agreed to have a slice last night. But, let me tell you why I'm giving your Geary Blvd. location 2 stars. \n\nWe were there last night around 7 PM to grab a quick bite to eat. While waiting in line, there was an uncut cheese pizza sitting on the counter that was clearly fresh out the oven. After your employee gave a customer back his change, he used his BARE HANDS to hold the crust (no, he did NOT wash them) and began to slice the cheese pizza. After proceeding to the next customer and giving him his change, he repeated the process and continued to slice the pizza with his bare hands again. This made my stomach churn as I'm sure he did that with the other pizzas. \n\nAlthough I was thoroughly disgusted, I have to say my bf loves your pizza so much that he ate his entire cheese pizza slice including the crust (yes, from the one that was being cut). So, I guess your pizza is that good... \n\nManagement--I know we're all trying to cut cost these days, but can you PLEASE: \n\n1) Buy (or re-buy) gloves for your employees \n2) Train (or re-train) your employees on how to use them \n\nThank you!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

They tend to add dimension to yelp reviews, but can be difficult and sometimes useless in gauging the quality of business.\n\nIrving Pizza on Geary is not THE FRACKING BEST PIZZA YOU'VE EVER HAD. Irving Pizza on Geary is also not THE WORST  PIZZA WITH THE WORST SERVICE IN THE WORLD F*CK THESE FOOLS I'M NEVER GOING BACK.\n\nIrving Pizza IS an reliable, well-priced, tasty little spot in the heart of the tenderloin. They advertise their NYC influences, yet embrace a definitive west coast approach. No deep-dish specialties unless requested, no beer, limited seating and fast service, especially if you take the time to say \"hello\" and \"thank you\" to those serving you. \n\nBaked by the pie, slices will be rebaked if ordered off the street. Standard for most joints, but fresh pies come out often, so asking when a hot one's coming up and waiting could be your best bet.\n\nIrving's niche seems to be servicing late-night stumblers and delivery lovers. I've fallen into both categories many, many times and have never been let down. Prompt arrival every delivery time. Effective yumminess on every stumble.\n\nOn their Pizza: hot, fresh, cheesy, greasy, saucy glory. Sweet doughy crust that sags with toppings and puffs up on the outer ring. Excellent foldover slices with TONS of customizable options and dedicated specials. Drool-inducing warm sexual foodage dripping with juice and grease and hot love as only SF can deliver. \n\nI also recommend the wings. They're fried in a spiced batter, not just nuked and covered in cold sauce as many other places tend to try and pass as a buffalo wings. My favorite local wings by far.\n\nA word on freshness: I've burnt the hell out of myself many times digging too eagerly into a delivery slice.

As usual, an e-mail confirmation, and two text messages were sent to keep me in track of the ETA. 7:40PM - 7:50PM, it said. Silly to take that long for a burger and fries. But as with my (pleasanter) experiences with Grubhub orders, especially if it's a smaller order, and the restaurant closer to my apartment, more often than not, the wait is shorter. Sillier too, perhaps for me, that I didn't just pick up the order, since they're only a couple of blocks away. But it's cold out, and I'm exhausted, and all I really want to do is pig out on some grease slop. So much so I felt warped in fevered delirium, and thinking generously, that when my order comes, I've got a big fat tip to whoever brings my food. 7:40PM came and went. I'm growing more impatient. And then 7:50PM: by now I'm chain-smoking in hopes of alleviating the hunger, and the simmering temper that arises from a combination of hunger, work exhaustion, tardiness of others, and incompetence.\n\nRoommie and I work very early hours, scholarly in temperament, and have a quiet understanding between us that after a certain time in the evening, after our long hours at work (and then some more work at home!), that we are going to keep the apartment (at least on the weekdays), as quiet as a tomb. I've gotten so accustomed to these weekdays that the cellphone ring, the chirp of a text message, the neighbors' television, and mooks out on the street will drive me willy-nilly to distraction. Especially that damned, thunderous doorbell of ours! And so, needless to say, I requested that the delivery person skip that and call my phone instead. But no call. When I washed my hands in the bathroom, could I have missed that call? Nope. Not on my phone. When I had a smoke? Oh yeah, I brought my phone with me. Nope. No calls. \n\nI called. Initially to see if they were even open. Maybe Grubhub was mistaken of their hours, and mistook taking my order. Nope. Open. I inquired of my order. Yes, they know all about it. The employee even sounded off accusingly that I had not been picking up the phone when they tried! NOPE. \"I'd like to cancel that order,\" I sternly said. \"Well, we called and called...\" he blubbered, and carried on confirming my address, and then phone number. Nope. No calls. \"I'd like to cancel that order, please,\" I gravely repeated. They've been dialing the wrong number, he explained repentantly, to which a vehement \"Your mistake\" was my reply. \"I'd like to cancel that order please.\" I suppose he was nice enough to offer to bring the food back-- gratis. Nope. MY APPETITE HAS BEEN RUINED! And... What dumb business practice is that? Do they randomly give food away as consolation for a measly complaint and cancellation?

Nice counter guys too, seems like they've seen all manner of drunkard and shady character in there, so we were relatively tame.\n\nThey have another location on Irving and 19th, hence the name, so they must be doing something right. Will definitely try them soon again, perhaps for delivery this time. Really, more like 3.5 stars, you dig?", "author": "Nish N."}

The crust is thick and chewy and will meet your FDA carbohydrate requirements for the next 36 hours. \n\nThe boys in the kitchen are generous with the mozzarella, which I find particularly gratifying. They layer on the cheese with pornographic immodesty. When properly heated, an Irving pepperoni slice will secrete a discreet amount of orange-ish grease - just right. If you're lucky, the thin pepperoni slices will be curled up like petals on an orchid and blackened, quite exquisitely, at their edges.\n\nKindly note that I lavish my praise strictly on the pepperoni slices. Irving's sausage resembles rabbit poop in size and complexion. At least it tastes all right, if lackluster. Now c'mon boys. The best pizza sausage will resemble a misshapen testicle, let an embarrassment of grease when sizzled on the griddle, and extrude a bounty of caraway seeds. \n\nQuite alarmingly, I thought I spied a rabbit hopping around the kitchen late one night, the same night, in fact, on which I had encountered a fairy wearing boots outside the Hi Tide.

An hour and 20 minutes later we checked in to find out where on earth our food was, and were told they \"lost our order\" and food would arrive within 30-35 minutes. 45 minutes after that, we checked back in (again!) to find out where on earth our food was, and we were told it would be there in 5-7 minutes. 15 minutes later, we checked back in for a third time (pretty hungry by this point) to find out where our food was, and ask for a refund, at which point we were told to \"hang on\" while the guy checked on something, and we were hung up on. Called back 5-7 minutes after THAT and were told that WE had requested to cancel our order. WE had NOT. Really...truly, unbelievable. Our card has already been charged. When we inquired about our refund, we were told that the bank may take 5-7 business days to complete our refund. Still Hungry. Still no food. We will never be using Irving Pizza again.", "author": "Cole S."}

I usually grab a slice of veggie and a meat slice, but this place took that a step up from the usual. The veggie pizza comes with an AMAZING pesto sauce that just enhances all the flavor of all the veggies, and the Irving Special or whatever comes with pepperoni, salami, sausage, bell peppers, and mushrooms. So good! And at $2.95 a slice, it's a pretty good deal. Looks like they have good lunch specials too. Definitely need to go back then!", "author": "Brett B."}

I used to come here for pizza because it's pretty decent and cheap but then I noticed that they had a bunch of other menu items. My friend got the chicken Cesar and I got the wings. The wings are a bit pricey and I even told the pizza dude so. It's like $6.46 for half dozen. Makes KFC look like a bargain, but (holy cock, batman!) the best little fried chicken wings this side of Polk EVER! And the Cesar was good, too. Deep friend chicken on a salad with creamy dressing? Yum-O. It's like Rachel Ray on crack.", "author": "TaDao V."}

When the kitchen is closed in the restaurant you work in and you've been working all night and haven't eaten, this is the place to go... or have them deliver. I've never actually been there.

Like one time I took a plain slice and made it into a chicken, mushroom and onion slice- for the same price! Plus, their garlic fries with ranch dressing are pretty tasty too. The pizza isn't  what you're used to if you've sampled  Chicago or New York pies but at bar time, it's pretty delicious.", "author": "Jessica M."}

Slices for under $3, and they aren't greasy, with a crispy crust.\n\nI always grab a slice on my way home from work, whenever I feel a tad bit hungry. And not many places I know have a slice card, where when you buy 6 slices you get 1 free. Usually its buy 10 get 1 free, so they get an extra star for that added value!!\n\nI eat at this place at all times of the day (lunch, dinner, after drinking). Great place, and polite staff.", "author": "S. S."}

They don't have a lot of fancy choices, but they are consistently tastey.  They use pesto on the veggie slices and the crust is better than most.  Basically, this place is not gormet, but it's still pretty good, and I enjoy eating there at least once a week.  If anyone knows of a better place to go near Geary and Larkin, let me know.  For now, I'd say it's the best pizza in the Tenderloin.", "author": "Margaret S."}

Low and behold I was drunk as hell at 1 am in the morning and I got off the bus (the 19) and it stopped right in front of this little pizza joint. Needless to say it is the best slice of pizza I have had in a LONG time. One slice about feels you up. So the next day I went back to this little pizza joint to feed my hunger and I noticed they had other things besides pizza. I ordered a philly cheese steak and my god that thing was fantastic. Never thought that a place that had pizza would have cheese burgers and other food that tastes amazingly fantastic. I gave it a 4 star only cuz crazy bums and hookers can be found close by lol. If you are in the TL and are looking for a CHEAP and FANTASTIC place to eat this is it. Oh did I mention that phiily cheese steak was only 7 bucks and came with a crap ton of fries! Overall this place is a real good value and has good food!", "author": "Travis C."}
