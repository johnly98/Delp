This dark, two story bar is really more a dual floor club where the music is always in the 90s and the girl to guy ratio is incredibly askew (too many dicks on the dance floor). Yet, somehow with the right amount of libations, the music playing strongly, and dancing, YES DANCING, still alive and well Raven Bar doesn't just become some cool place in the city that has great 90s music. It becomes a great place in the city that has great 90s music for you and your friends. \n\nWhen it's not crowded it feels strange like most clubs. Luckily the bar areas really feel like a bar so it's not too bad. But you don't pay for cover and that's why you go early when it is that empty. But when the night comes in and takes over the place can get hot and packed real fast. \n\nDancing comes in different languages. You have the dance of trying to get closer to a pretty face and vice versa, the dance of escape from a creeper. You have the dance of hand motions and winks to try and capture the bartender's attention. The dance of potty as you wait in line for 2 bathrooms in this multi-story club. And the dance of satisfaction as you and your friends sing out loud to Backstreet Boys' \"I Want It That Way\". \n\nSo like a true 90s book you can choose your own adventure every night you come out here and even with some many constants you'll probably end up with a great night out with your friends.

David Huu and the rest of the planning committee were so helpful and accommodating. They answered all my neurotic questions before the event, and also made sure everything was in place before we arrived. \n\nI had about 40 people in the back area with a private bar. Free entry for everyone on my guests list. If you want extra people, they have to pay $10 after 10:30pm. Cocktails ranged from $10-12, but you can also request for bottle service or take shotssss haha. My only complaint would be that we only had one bartener working for most of the night which was difficult to serve all of our drunk guests. Oh, they also offer free coat check upstairs! \n\nRaven provided us with cupcake tower and birthday banner, and even allowed us to put up our own decorations and balloons. They also gave me a bday tiara and free tickets for next time I come to Raven which was really sweet. The music playing was 90s/2000-2010 hip hop and R&B bopsss so it was litttt!! Definitely would recommend coming here for a party or just clubbing with friends since there's 2 dance floors. Thanks Raven staff!!", "author": "Kendall C."}

I highly recommend this bar if your going out with a big group of friends (4 or more) because you can reserve a VIP booth for FREE!!!! That way your group has a guaranteed place to sit and relax in between dancing. \nParking is not very easy, luckily we found  parking in an alley across the street and it didn't look so sketch. \nOn a Friday night, we added our names to the guest list a few hours before and got in for free around 10 pm, no one checked our names off so I'm not sure if it mattered that we did a guest list. \nWe didn't reserve a booth this time but I asked the bartender and that's how I found out it's free, I would rather do that because a few times I really wanted to sit down and the majority of the seating is down stairs.. next time for sure though. \nWe were going crazy with that lavender mojito drink, I felt so bad for the bartender, we were all ordering those, so we'd have to order 5 at a time! In the end I switched to a AMF and that's the drink that got me dancing.\nThe music was really nice, throwback 90s hip hop so it was easy to dance too, the light effects and smoke machine really bring an amazing ambience on the top floor, leaving the bottom floor boring... the top stairs bar is super loud and hard to order so we went downstairs and it was the worst mistake, there was a line to come up stairs and in order to go up we had to get a ticket, so we had more drink and just left.. it was fun while it lasted.

The only thing that was rough was that there was only one bathroom downstairs. Other than that the servers were very accomodating, even when our alcohol ran out they were still nice enough to refill the mixers and let us continue on with our ratchetness.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-03", "description": "\"TIME CRISIS: The story of a club lost in time\"\n\nRaven bar is the \"90s hip hop club\" you always hear about. The concept is pretty dope. Let's play 90s music, throw it on a projector, and oh yeah let's throw some fog in there... and LIGHTS, can't forget the LIGHTS!\n\nThe main issue is that this place is too popular for its own good. There really just isn't much space. So unless you get there early, it'll be really hard to make it upstairs where the main dance floor is.\n\nThe entry isn't too expensive. The main bouncer at the front is nice. Drinks are average. Crowd is a bit off (this is the only place in the city you'll still see man buns in 2017).\n\nNow the execution of the music is where its really lacking. I swear the DJ seriously just googled '90s music' and put together a playlist. He'll play some weird stuff that wasn't even popular in the 90s. He'll usually get the artist right, but play the wrong track. Seriously. This dude is literally DJ AltaVista. [EDITOR'S NOTE: For those that don't know, AltaVista is an old 90s search engine that no ones ever heard of and got shut down. Probably because it returned \"This Girlie Had a Mustache\" instead of \"Summertime\" or \"I think I Can Beat  Mike Tyson\" when you searched for DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith]\n\nOverall this isn't a bad place. But there are better options out there if you want to dance.\n\nProtip: To get to the next level (upstairs) you'll need to make it past the bouncer with the fauxhawk (!) [EDITOR'S NOTE: Again, this review was written in 2017]. He'll try to tell you that the line against the wall to get upstairs is not in fact a line and you'll need to move away. Listen to him and you'll be stuck on level one forever. Play confused and the bouncer in the stairway will eventually let people up.", "author": "Joel L."}

Well, you should still tip. The drinks aren't bad. The 90s hip hop music was legit, bringing us all back to our childhoods. Best of all, the spot where we were standing had air conditioning!! There was not a sweaty moment of the night, which was absolutely glorious.

Everything about you is great..from the 90s classics you play, the cool vibes and people you bring together, those delicious lychee drinks you make and for supporting small businesses, like that dirty dog cart outside your venue.\n\nSorry for always being a menace and thank you to the manager whose patience is undying and always says hi back to my drunken slurs, thank you to the bartender who gave me a free much needed tequila shot that one night, and thank you to the very kind\n lady at coatcheck.", "author": "Emily F."}

My first issue is with the rude doormen/bouncers that work at the front, their attitudes were unfriendly and arrogant.  Relax dude, just because you wear a suit doesn't mean that you're the secret service.  This is mainly aimed at the tall, chunky Asian man and the tall African-American guy with a lot of piercings.\n\nMy second issue is with the cover charge here.. I'm not sure why it exists to be honest.  I've been to the nicest clubs in Las Vegas, Manhattan and LA and I've never had to pay a cover.  That being said, to charge anyone (whether male or female) to enter this mediocre bar is absurd.\n\nThe music was good, mostly 90s but I wouldn't return here for that.. there are plenty of other places in SF that play great music and have a better staff than the one that is employed at the Raven.", "author": "Sarah N."}

I added him and I to the guest list (the day before) to obtain free admission. So on my birthday, we were visiting different places in SF and lost track of time. In addition to that, the Airbnb we were staying out was a mile away, so we hiked it there in dress shoes and heels. We arrived approximately 10-15 minutes passed 11 pm (the cut off time for no cover charge, which is $10 per person). Surprisingly, the ticket holder and the bouncer were very nice and humorous, so they let us through. When the ticket holder saw my ID, she handed me a free drink card, which I immediately redeemed. It was quite busy upon arrival and the bartender was swamped, but eventually, she helped us out and was very informative when we asked questions pertaining to the drinks they had. After getting some alcohol on me, I felt buzzed and wanted to dance. The music was hit after hit, yet not many people were on the dance floor, which was mildly disappointing to me. Interior-wise, the lighting was perfect, but the dance floor is more on the small scale on the lower floor. Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to check out the top floor because my boyfriend was more buzzed than I was and we left the establishment. Overall, I loved the atmosphere and the people. No one was pushy, rowdy, or an asshole compared to most traditional club environments.", "author": "Tina H."}

I contacted Raven a few days before the event and they set us up with a reasonably priced bottle service table in the downstairs area. I had originally wanted to get a table upstairs, but we were actually very happy with all the space we had to dance! They treated us very well, were easy to communicate with, and even decorated the space in honor of our bride-to-be. They tell you to get there at 10pm, but as long as you let them know your real ETA beforehand, it's okay to be a little late.

Actually that isn't the venue's fault.  I'll bump it up to 5 stars.\n\nGet on the guest list on their website for free entry before 11.  I did this and got in easy peezy.  The girl working the list was observant enough to notice that it was only a week after my birthday (the reason I was going out on that particular night) and gave me a free drink ticket.  Kudos and a big thanks to her.\n\nThe guys at the front door were cool and I appreciate that as well.\n\nThere is a downstairs and upstairs, bars on both levels, dancing and music on both levels.  Music from the 90s and 2000s that matched the music videos that were being played on tv screens.  It was fun to dance to some old school classics and watch the videos that went along with them.\n\nDrinks seemed a little on the pricey side and also seemed a little weak, but maybe I don't go out much and that is just how much they are these days.\n\nI heard cover is $10 after 11, but you might want to check for yourself.\n\nStreet parking was easy to find at 10:30.  \n\nSecurity seemed on top of things all night and it didn't seem like a place where anything bad would go down.\n\nThere was a nice mix of guys and girls.\n\nIt was not too hot which was nice.\n\nI know this is a boring review, but I'm just trying to be informative on this one.\n\nA few key things that I really appreciated...\n\n1.  The music was not super loud!!!!  I was actually able to talk and hear and be heard and my ears were not ringing at the end of the night.  5 stars for that!!!!  It made everything so much more enjoyable.\n\n2. They were not trying to do too much with the dress code.  I was able to wear jeans sneakers!!  They were all black (gammas) Jordan XIs, but still, just being able to wear comfortable shoes is a huge plus.\n\nThis is definitely a cool spot if you want to get out and dance to some old school music for a bit.  I will be back.\n\nAlso for those who smoke, there is an area downstairs that is outside for you to smoke, but do yourself a favor and stop smoking!  :)\n\nActually seeing how parking and entry was free and the vibe was cool, the drinks were not that expensive.", "author": "Ty C."}

It's free cover charge if you're on the guest list & get here before 10 or 11, but check the website to make sure of the time. We parked on the street about 2 blocks away. There was a very short line & the bar itself was pretty small. There are two floors & each floor has a bar; the first floor actually has two bars - 1 is in the front & one in the back.. There are TVs Galore & music videos from the 90s & early 2000s playing. There is no DJ. There are bathrooms on both floors as well but be prepared to wait in line because again it is very small.The first floor doesn't really have a dance floor - it's more like an open floor area that you could dance in, if there's no room upstairs. The real dance floor is upstairs but again it is very small & you will barely have room to dance or move your elbows. Be warned, once the upstairs gets too crowded, the bouncers or security guards will start giving out tickets & forcing people to wait in line before they can go upstairs. This is a terrible rule - even if you come from the upstairs, they will still not let you back up for any reason. Truthfully, upstairs is overrated anyways so it's not worth even waiting in line for. The bouncer did a terrible job - he didn't explain this DMV ticket procedure & did not warn any of the people coming from the upstairs to the downstairs about this change. I am not returning to this place & I definitely do not recommend it to anyone at all. If you want to have a good time & party, go somewhere else. There are plenty of other places to go to - w/ more space, class, better music, etc. The last thing you need on your night out is to get stuck inside some cramp, tiny, rude establishment with bad service, bathroom odor galore, cheap music, & no dance space. Terrible all around!", "author": "Hu L."}

They were playing 90s music that night and charging $14 a drink. Raven has two floors playing 90s music on both floors. Things were okay initially until it got later into the night where we were told that we weren't allowed upstairs despite the fact we had VIP. \n\nI would not recommend paying for a table because you will be treated no differently from someone who pays general admission. For example if you and your friends have a table upstairs, you may not be allowed to go up there despite the fact of whether or not you have a VIP wrist band. My friends found that to be bullshit so we left and asked the guy outside (Asian dude in suit with spiky hair who the security guards claimed to be the manager) what difference does it make for a party who paid for bottle service (VIP wrist band) vs someone who randomly walks in. The employee stated the benefits of having a VIP band is you can go upstairs whenever you'd like. Consequently, I told him what happened and then he says oh you're orange so your only allowed downstairs and if you have a blue wristband you're only allowed upstairs. I'll let you guys interpret that yourself but going forward, if I go back, I'm definitely not getting bottle service. \n\nI recommend signing up for guest list because this place is not worth paying cover for or bottle service.

Any place that plays 90s/hiphop/r&b and its music videos(!!) warrants an automatic approval from me. That coupled that with a relaxed dress code and a dance floor definitely make this my kind of place. BUT as always, there are downsides. Drinks are expensive (what's new?), $10 cover after a certain time, there's only two single stall bathrooms for women in this ENTIRE PLACE, and the top floor is typically jam packed, making it hard to dance. These downsides are fairly common across the board for all bars/clubs so I guess these could be overlooked if I'm a) drunk or b) having a really good time.  \n\nHowever, bottle service is a different story. I came here recently to celebrate a friend's birthday and we ordered bottle service. What I liked was that we could specify our group size beforehand and have them all added to the guest list. Not sure if we could add more, but we were able to add 20 people to our guest list. Mind you, that's 20 people who could come and skip paying cover. Thought it was nice that they set up birthday signs around our table, gave the birthday girl a little birthday tiara and both birthday celebrants a couple vouchers for no cover. Those were pretty much the only things I 'liked' about bottle service. \n\nThe bottle service itself was pretty mediocre, and that's me being polite. Our juice and soda carafes were empty fairly quick and were probably only refilled maybe twice the entire time we were there. It took forever to flag down someone to refill our drinks and even longer for them to come back with it. We killed our 2 bottles very early on in the night and decided to bite the bullet and purchase a 3rd, but even that took a long time also. At one point, I even forked over $3 at the bar to buy soda because our runner was taking too long. Having 20+ people standing around waiting for the bottle, cups and juice/soda is just unacceptable, especially when you're paying money for it. The redeeming factor in all this though, is that these issues were brought up to management by the birthday celebrants and they were able to come up with a compromise.\n\nOverall,  just the music alone makes this a pretty good place. Just skip the bottle service unless you wanna spend your entire night waiting.", "author": "Gabrielle S."}

Dreading the cramped dance floor, crazy drunkards, and impending hangover that will certainly hit the next morning. \n\nLike many bar-clubs in SF, the bar is on the bottom floor, and if you want to dance, you'll go upstairs. It gets incredibly crowded later on in the night, and sometimes they don't let you back up for a while if there are too many people... My only gripe. \n\nYou can reserve the back section of the bottom floor, which is awesome for parties of any sort.

After an unsuccessful night at Mighty, which just wasn't our scene, we randomly picked Raven after seeing it on a couple top 10 lists. Since we had a pretty big group, we just decided to do bottle service since it would get us in with no cover and it just seemed more convenient. Maybe we're just used to Chicago's absurd prices, but the going rate for these bottles actually seemed reasonable. They gave us a table on the first floor. \n\nAs for the atmosphere, the DJ was throwin down 90s jams all night and the crowd was lovin it. There was some great energy on the dance floor upstairs and everyone was just having a good time. The only con was that it was super crowded everywhere you went. It was especially annoying since there was barely any private space in our area and people kept bumping into our table as they were passing by.\n\nOverall, it's pretty tough to pick places to go out at night based on Yelp reviews, but if you're looking for some Top 40 type dance music and don't mind crowds, this is a pretty good spot to check out.", "author": "Mike M."}

We got there to meet a group celebrating a birthday.   They were late so we just chilled at the main bar for an hour while we waited for them.   It's a younger crowd there for sure, like late 20's.   But the people were all low key and having a good time.   Once the rest of our party got there, we hung out in the back bar area.   There were two bartenders there, one was teaching the other.   The experienced guy poured great drinks all night long.   The newer bartender was learning, but was making rookie mistakes.   That's ok, everyone has to learn.

I've been coming here since it was Dragon SF. So I have definitely seen it at its best and its worst.\n\nThe pros: The music is great and the drinks aren't too expensive. I also really like the manager (not sure if he's the owner too), but he is super nice and friendly. Every time I go there he always comes up to me and tells me \"Thank you for waiting. It shouldn't be too much longer.\" Honestly, to me thats really nice of someone to do. Most place don't care if you are waiting. Also, the bottle service area is great, especially the one upstairs. Love it!\n\nThe cons: The space is pretty small and narrow so be careful. There is a 2nd floor, but sometimes there are so many people that you have to wait in line just to get upstairs. Also I think the DJ is a little power hungry. I guess they installed a new AC system in the place and if the DJ sees anyone near it he'll get the bouncers to kick them out. I understand he's doing his job and the AC is probably expensive, but if it was that precious then maybe you should put a sign warning people. Look at that! Problem solved and no more angry drunk patrons.\n\nLastly, make sure to get on the guest list so you don't have to pay, but make sure you get there before it closes at 11 pm. Be careful though, if you get there too late, they'll just make you wait there to give the illusion that a ton of people want to be in there and that it is packed.", "author": "Theo T."}

But I am so glad we weren't able to get any! (We went to BK beforehand to get food, and desperately took some BK crowns for plan b...) When we entered, they had the exact party favors we wanted. 2015 tiaras and eyeglasses! You should've seen the looks on our faces.. priceless. \n\nEven though we had a big group, we decided against getting a table. Online it said we only needed to get one bottle, but when my friend was contacted, she was told 2. No thanks, we don't need that much to have fun anyways. \n\nFor drinks, most of us got their Lychee Bliss, Ciroc peach vodka, Chambord, Cointreau, lychee, orange. I was really surprised they used real lychee rather than syrup! It was really good, and it was topped off with a lychee piece, a plus! My other friend got their Herbal Remedy, Zubrowka bison grass vodka, St. Germain, lime, apple, agave & muddled basil. I took a sip and it was light and refreshing! \n\nFor the dance area, we went to the second floor. It was the perfect amount of people, not too crowded but not too empty. It was packed by midnight though. And wow, their type of music was totally in our zone. Literally, throwback Thursday. From 90's to today's hit, every song was on point! \n\nA few downsides. They expected us to carry the champagne drink ticket till midnight. I wish they had a better way of issuing that, because my friend misplaced hers early in the night and we couldn't do anything about it.

Raven Bar's high standards for cocktails, modern and classy interior and great service stuck with me, so when it came time to plan my high school reunion, I had it in the back of my mind to throw the event here. Unfortunately for me and the rest of the reunion committee, we had basically no venue budget since our high school didn't assist with reunions. Luckily, Raven Bar came to the rescue. I submitted an event inquiry on their website and they got back to me right away. I explained to David our situation and he was able to reserve us the upper lounge for free, with DJ, as long as we could bring in $500 towards bar purchases. Communicating with David and his team was super easy via email, and something I truly appreciated since I had to plan the event remote from Las Vegas. They provided us with a separate entrance for our event, privacy for 3 hours (although we could have opted for 4 hours), signage for our event outside, and a personalized table-top cocktail menu with drinks that paid homage to our high school. DJ Mark was great at providing music video mixing during the event and playing a ton of songs from the late 90s and early 2000s. He also made sure the slideshow we provided was playing on 3 of their TV screens (while music videos played in the rest). Luckily, hitting the $500 bar tab was super easy since their bartenders make tasty drinks. I was really impressed at everyone's professionalism and would throw another event here in a heartbeat. If I lived in the Bay Area still, I would definitely break my rule of staying at home whenever possible, and come out here for their chill vibe, great music and thoughtful cocktails.

CAW!\" at the top of my lungs.  Fortunately for me, my friends, and everyone within shouting distance, I restrained myself, for fear of overly embarrassing the birthday girl.  (Side note: And no, not as some sort of mating call to attract the ladies, as my friend suggested.  Plus, if it did work, I would have some serious questions about those girls...).\n\nOver the last year or so, Raven has, for better or worse, become quite a popular spot in SoMa.  The only reason why I say \"worse\" is that, despite having two floors, the place isn't all that spacious.  In fact, it gets really cramped really fast, so arriving earlier is better.  While we were able to walk right upstairs (with no cover), our friends arrived 45 minutes later and had to wait in line downstairs.  Thus, once you make it upstairs, stay there. \n\nSince we spent pretty much the entire night on the upper level, I can't speak to what the lower level is like.   Upstairs though, there's a good amount going on - more of a club-ish vibe, with a decently sized bar, a handful of tables, bathrooms, and a modest sized dance floor.  The highlight though might have been the music (and the lax dress code), which was mostly top-40 and hip-hop ranging from 90's hits to today.\n\nIf it weren't for how uncomfortably crowded the upper level got, and if my friends and I were still into the scene, I'm sure I'd be an advocate for returning to Raven.  It certainly doesn't hurt that there's a Mission Dog Cart right outside either.  In this case though, Raven Bar was just fine for a quick hit-and-run for a birthday party, and far more appealing than some of the clubs and venues we used to go to.\n\nTHREE AND A HALF rounded down.\n\nCAW!", "author": "Mike L."}

Don't ladies usually always get in for free? \n\nAlso, the floors are STICKY as hell. It gets so crowded that people bump into each other and it becomes a wet and wild contest with all the spilled drinks sloshing in the air and splashing on the floor. \n\nThey play some old school nostalgic hip hop which was actually pretty nice. Everyone was reciting the lyrics to the songs they used to dance to in middle school. They played songs like \"Ghetto superstar\", \"Dilemma\", \"Everybody in the club getting tipsy\", etc. Basically everything I haven't heard in ages.\n\nThe crowd was friendly and the drinks were strong. \nOverall I had a good night.  \n\n3/5 stars", "author": "Tim C."}

We finalized the details of the reservation and he answered all my questions through e-mail. It was very quick and easy. AND on the day of my party David came up to my booth and personally greeted me. I even got a birthday tiara and a card with 2 VIP passes. \n\nMy party was the Saturday after Thanksgiving so it was pretty packed. Me and a small group from my party arrived around 9-930. It wasn't crowded that early in the night but definitely filled up later on, but I had a pretty big group with me so we held down our space haha. There was a little bit of a wait for the line to go upstairs to the main dance floor but a friend of mine was able to talk to \"a guy\" who spoke to the bouncer guarding the stairs and he got a group of us to skip the line.

I got a response the following day (7/28/15) from David stating that there was only one booth left. I obviously swooped on that real quick and he was very quick to reply and confirm everything! He said I would receive a separate email the Monday before the event where I can add up to 20 people (including myself) on a private all-night guest list. Once Mon, 8/10/15 rolled by, lo' and behold there was my email and private guestlist link! \n\n$10 cover starts at 10pm. I know some Yelpers said they had issues with the private guestlist and still had to pay $10, but all my friends who came in after 10pm had no problems at all - happy friends = happy birthday girl. \n\nKudos for actually having a \"Happy Birthday\" banner and a sign that said \"Tina's Birthday Party\" on the wall and table - I definitely wasn't expecting anything to be honest so I appreciated the gestures! The booth itself seemed pretty small to fit 20 people, but who sits down the whole time anyway? \n\nLoved the music! It was a good mix of top 40s, your favorite hits from the 2000s, and some 90s hiphop. It wasn't superrr crowded but it was still a full house from what I can remember. If anyone's wondering, crowd itself consisted of mainly whites and Asians. There was no rowdiness or aggressive groping (ladies, I know you feel me on this one) - so that was a plus. But what I do remember is LISA THE BARTENDER - super cute Asian girl with the sweetest personality. She took care of me and my friends at the bar and even named a drink after me.

I mean a glass of beer was $6 and their signature drinks are their mojitos (around $10?). I have to say those mojitos... are too sweet to my liking.

I've been here on two different nights:\n\n-Saturday: Packed. Make sure you sign up for their guest list early so you can get in for free. Otherwise, you have to arrive before a certain time to avoid cover or pay a discounted cover. Once it hits 11 the line starts getting crazy long though, so coming early is your best bet. They also restrict entry to the second floor when it starts getting too packed, and it gets difficult to find parking.\n-Thursday: They play some good old school jams, but it wasn't very crowded at 10pm (the upstairs was dead). However, there is no cover and plenty of parking.\n\nI've heard Raven is also packed on Friday nights, so this is the place to go on the weekends if you're looking to dance to good hip hop music.", "author": "Amy D."}

The place is definitely not an upscale/Vegas type club with all the bells and whistles. As a matter of fact, its the exact opposite. The dress code is very casual and almost everyone gets in free with guest list if you show up around 10. It's not a very big place but it is two levels, which is nice if you want a change of scenery. \n\nEvery Thursday they have 1990s VS Y2K, playing 90s music upstairs and popular music from the 2000's downstairs. I managed to make it out one Thursday (July 4th weekend, so no work Friday) and it was pretty fun. It brought me back to my college days with the 90s music. Also, it's free all night long on Thursdays.\n\nI love the music they play at Raven. Most clubs nowadays play EDM and there are so few that play hip hop, let alone old school hip hop. I like many just can't really dance to EDM unless I'm completely plastered, so it's nice that Raven sticks to hip hop. \n\nAnother great thing about this place is the tables are free as long as you request them in advance. But they do fill up quickly, so plan ahead! Bottle service is optional, but a pretty decent price. \n\nThe crowd here is fairly mixed in terms of ethnicity and age. I don't think there is one target audience, so that's pretty nice. \n\nThe drinks are decently priced, about $8-10 for a cocktail. They have a wide array of specialty drinks too, but I have yet to try them. \n\nSo if you are looking for a nice casual place to have a few drinks with your friends, dance it off to some hip hop with a mixed crowd, this is the place for you. Don't come here if you are looking for an upscale Vegas like club where all the girls are wearing skin tight dresses and heels. You'd have better luck at The Grand or Origin.", "author": "Milton F."}

We arrived at around 1130pm with a long line in front. We asked the door guy about bottle service who then brought a gentleman out who told us to wait. Ten minutes pass by and we were still waiting, till Mika came and saved us. We decided we were going to get a bottle but not sure which one yet so she still got us in for free. \nWhen we entered it was so small, she brought us to our table, which was the first one you see as soon as you walk onto the tiny dance floor. We sat while the dance floor was packed and decided on a bottle of kettle one. It took awhile for the whole process of ordering and bringing out the bottle and chasers, be patient Mika appears to be the only one working the tables.\nWe encountered a problem, many people came up and asked if we were part of another persons bday party, which we stated no. We didn't understand why three different groups of people kept coming and asking us, it got annoying. Then about an hour into drinking, a whole group of people rushed our table and sat down and crowded us. One guy saying we took their table and we need to leave, it was getting intense. One GF had gone to get management when the guy showed up he explained to the other group that they had abandoned their table for 30 minutes so they assumed that the party was done or had left and gave the table to us. Then finally everyone from the group apologized for getting in our faces. The manager im assuming knew we were upset and came back with 5 more shots for us, on top of the bottle we had. \nSo why did I choose to give this place 4 stars instead of something lower? Besides our incident, they provided exceptional service, especially Mika. She would check up on us and take care of us as best she could. Even though the incident could've been prevented it was not their fault for giving an empty table away. And security/doormen, when present were not douche bags. Compared to LA/OC that's always a plus. \nThe music is hip hop and late 90s pop (think boy bands). And the bathroom is disgusting. Have fun!", "author": "Cathy P."}

We ubered all the way from Berkeley to check this place out because of the 90s music. So we decided to check it out for my sisters birthday. The music was great but the crowd is made up of people from there early to mid 20s. Not the scene I was hoping for considering they were playing 90s music. So me and my sister step out for some air. Security mentions nothing when we step out and when we try to get back in at 12:56 he says we can't enter. I point to the sign on the door that says no entry after 1:15 and told him we had been in earlier and showed him the stamps we each paid 10$ for. He said no entry after 1. I told him it wasn't even 1 yet. He said no we weren't allowed in. That basically ruined out night. We tried to come out and have a good time since this place plans 90s music but they don't play by the rules. So we were literally inside for a hour before we ubered our way back home.

At first, I was a little surprised by how much my friend emphasized signing up for the guestlist, getting there by ten so you don't have to pay cover, etc., because by 10:00, the place was still pretty light so I thought \"how popular could this be?\". However, by the time the clock struck midnight, I knew why she was so paranoid. The line was out the door till at least the end of the block and they weren't letting anybody in because they were filled till capacity. In the end, my other friends who came late and were waiting in said line decided to just go next door.\n\nThe Pros:\n\n- Killer house cocktails (a big plus for me)\n- old school/throwback music (sometimes, you are in that mood!)\n- Nice-looking but casually-dressed crowd\n\nThe Cons:\n\n- Lounge areas (while nice) are small and limited unless you have a reservation for the back area\n- Dance Floors are small, both of them (I like to dance and for a place that identifies as a \"dance club\", Raven Bar was really cramped)\n- the long lines (it sucked that my friends couldn't get in)\n- Cover (I just hate cover, period.)\n\nThe cons are enough to knock off a star for me. I realize that some things like the long lines are out of Raven's control but as for the cramped dance floors: if you are going to charge cover, I better enjoy myself and not have to worry about bumping into people and/or feeling trapped when I am dancing. Don't get me wrong, I will probably come back, because I don't know many places in sf that will play throwback songs, but I will definitely need to make sure that 1) I get there early and 2) I will spend most of my night there, two things that I generally do not enjoy.", "author": "Kunal N."}

But I always end up having a good time! \n\nUnless you're on guest list, there's usually a $10 cover.  Free coat check so you ladies don't have to be freezing cold waiting to get inside. Drinks are reasonably priced. So now you're wondering why I rated this 3 instead of 4 or 5. Here's why:\n\n- They only ONE bathroom per gender. Girls will know that this is horrible lol. For some reason we take 10x longer than guys. IDK WHY. Also, their bathrooms are GRIMES. Not that I expect the holy grail when I go to the bathtoom, but everytime I go, there's toilet paper all over the floors (or no TP), it's wet, and you can see remnants of yak. Hence the problem with only one bathroom. \n\n- It gets stupid packed. I'm all for big, fun crowds, but this place turns into a sauna. They also HOLD the line to go upstairs...since that's the best part. So if you get here around 10 or later on a Fri/Sat, you'll be waiting to go up. Meh. \n\n- The dance floor upstairs is fun. Really good music, 90's songs for all the 90s babies, but the FOG IS WAY TOO INTENSE.  My group went to the corner to get some breathing room and to dance...and then all of a sudden their fog machines exploded and I couldn't even see the person next to me. No joke. It got SO bad that I felt extremely claustrophobic and had to go back to the bar. Haha, CALM DOWN the fog machines. \n\n- Okay, last complaint about the bathroom. It's right by the bar.  Expect pushing and shoving. It's going to happen.\n\nOverall, it's become the place to go because it IS fun and the more alcohol you consume, the less you notice these things.  It's one of the few places that plays good music and has reasonable drinks. AND they have dirty dogs outside :D  But it's small, crowded, and hot. But try it!", "author": "Steph S."}

My girlfriends and I had to wait about an hour before we got to go in, so expect a wait! x___x  They play a lot of 90s music and the crowd appears to be mid 20s to early 30s.  Everyone was pretty friendly and I was surprised at how willing the dudes here were with buying girls drinks.

If you get on the guest list early, there's no cover! They had also set up a nice reserved booth/table, and we all had an awesome night. There were at least 6 other birthdays going on at the same time, but everyone coexisted peacefully and weren't overlapping. Between the bar area, smoking alley, downstairs lounge and upstairs dance floor, there is plenty of space to have a great time. I hate going to bars that feel like a sweaty mosh pit. \n\nNo dress code was pretty awesome - jeans, flats, and a nice shirt/top seemed to be the go-to outfit, and no one looked trashy. I LOVED that there was a full bar staff (three bartenders), which meant we got drinks pronto and there was no elbow-throwing at the bar. We ordered a couple drinks off the menu (Lychee Bliss & Castaway) and even got a show from our super-awesome bartender. I loved that they didn't seem stressed out and hurried. Drinks were strong, too!\n\nMusic was a little weird - all 1990's hits. After a few hours of N*SYNC and Backstreet Boys, even the excessive amounts of fruity vodka weren't enough of a distraction. If the night moved into more of a top-40, that would be spectacular. Doesn't stop me from coming back here, though. There are far worse things than BSB. \n\nUnexpectedly great bar.

The Raven has arguably one of the best bartenders in town. Watching David mix drinks is like watching Magic Johnson in the 1980's thread a pass; he's precise and does it with a smile. I witnessed this guy take five cocktail orders at one time, carefully make them, all while keeping the other patrons at the bar happy by chatting with them. The guy could probably be a pilot.\n\nIf you want to see perfection in the art of mixology, then watch David prepare one of his signature Vampire Slayers or a more traditional Old Fashioned. He's fast but never sloppy, and meticulous with peeling the twist and prepping the rim. \n\nNot only is David good at what he does, but he's incredibly friendly and strives to make sure his patrons are happy; whether it's a simple gesture of greeting people, asking how your cocktail is, or if you're okay with the channel the TV is on. If you own a bar or are thinking of owning a bar, I'd go and observe this guy. More important than his knowledge of spirits is how he treats his customers.\n\nI went on a Thursday for their happy hour. The prices were very reasonable; $8 for specialty cocktails, $4 draft beers, and $4 well drinks. They also have a menu for food from Triptych which they'll bring over from next door. Upstairs at around 9:00, a Video DJ spins and projects music from the 90's, not to be confused with a VeeJay (i.e. Bill Bellamy, Daisy Fuentes, Kennedy, Idalis, etc.)  He mixes music and the accompanying videos. Pretty awesome. I've never seen anything like it.\n\nThe bar fills up pretty quickly, which is to be expected with their drink specials and their service. The crowd was also pretty diverse, from tech people to Burning Man attendees who were doing fund raising. Seems like the type of place where you would feel comfortable enough to strike up a conversation with just about anyone.\n\nMy one complaint would be the server who didn't ask if we needed change for the food from Triptych.

Upstairs has a fairly large dance floor for those that want to show off their moves.  Another bar up there as well.  \n\nMusic was good playing mostly old school hip hop earlier in the night but then shifted to more modern jams later.\n\nNormal exorbitant drink prices of SF at around $10+.  And alcohol volume depends on bartender so be selective and tip well.\n\nSounds great right but why the one star?  Well here it is....\n\nIt is not a huge space so gets packed by 1030-11 on Saturdays.  You will be bumped where ever you are and have to fight your way through the small dance floor on the ground level to get to the stairs or exit.  I did have an incident with a rather rude employee as I was trying to make my way through. He was clearing space for a wait staff carrying a tray of alcohol.  I stopped and tried to make myself small to let them by but apparently it wasn't enough.  He told me to move and then put his hand on me.  I had no where to move (people and table behind me) so he thought he would shove me.  That caused me to bump into a couple of people behind me at their table.  I had a few choice words for him and he decided he had enough of his power trip for the night and moved on.

And she happened to have friends in town so we decided to make a night out of it. I would also say Raven isn't a club; it's more like a bar with a dance floor. The main dance floor is upstairs but people were dancing downstairs too. We went on a Saturday night. My friend got us on the guest list so if you go in before 11, it's free. They play 90s to current music from boy bands to rap to hip hop and r&b. Basically all the classics and music most 30 year olds know. And they have free coat check too. So no need to freeze from the car the bar. It was one my more positive clubbing experiences. We started low key-ly, on the ground floor. The bar in the back has this awesome (and cute) bartender making specially drinks, with hardly any line/wait (at least early in the evening). I tried the red raven and the sailor's sour. Both were super tasty. I think I preferred the red raven though. Couldn't tell you what was in them though. Prices were average for SF, about $12. Then a shot of tequila and up we went to the second floor for some dancing. The dance floor is not very big at all - my only minor complaint of the night. But we squeezed our way in and found space. I think we danced for a couple hours straight till they kicked us out. There were only a few songs I didn't know. But the DJ was pretty legit and great. It's the best when you know all the words to the song, can sing along and dance your heart out at the same time. I loved the music videos projected on the giant wall. It's something else to look at while dancing. Also if you go to that wall/corner with the music vids, they have AC units blasting cold air on you. Which is super welcome as it can get pretty crowded and hot in there, especially while dancing. Most guys were also super respectful and didn't try to get up all on you without permission. Though there were a lot of large circles formed where one person went in the middle and showed off their dance moves. Not a huge fan of those but some can be fun to watch. Last call was a little before 2. We picked up our coats, and then headed out. Don't forget to pick up the $5 bacon wrapped hot dogs from the street vendor out in front.", "author": "Alison W."}

On the night itself, I arrived 40 mins early and was impressed at how organized they were - on hand were staff preparing the bar and an audio-visual pro (Mark), ready to setup the projector and mic.\n\nThe upstairs room has a separate entrance from Raven Bar, so the staff prepared a sign for my meetup outside and attendees had no problems finding us. The venue itself has a great AV setup (including DJ booth behind the bar). Being separate from the downstairs area means that you have a bar exclusively for your group - it's a very private space. Everyone at our meetup appreciated the personal service, not to mention, the very attentive staff. They even made sure there was good, upbeat music playing all evening - and at a good noise level, too.\n\nAfterwards, one of our attendees mentioned that he'd be booking his birthday party at Raven Bar - for groups of up to 60 people, I'd say it's a fantastic space.\n\nOverall, I can really recommend Raven Bar for customer events and meetups - they have the model well rehearsed and really made our evening a really memorable one.

There's also a bouncer to let people up and down from the dance floor depends on its capacity. Safety first right? \n\nI LOVE how they play 90s music! The dance floor upstair was small but it was super cool that there's a large screen with music video playing in the background. It's like I'm totally catching up on my music as well as music videos I'd never seen before. The bar staffs were nice, and got drinks pretty quick!", "author": "Mandy C."}

I wasn't sure how many people to expect (from 20-30) and wanted to scout a location that would be flexible with the number of guests without sacrificing space or experience--and Raven Bar delivered! I got in touch a few weeks in advance and made a (free) reservation for a sizable booth space. David Liu was in frequent contact up to the event and responded to my questions promptly and thoroughly. \n\nOn the night of, my 30 guests had plenty of space to socialize, drink (with access to three bars), and dance to awesome 90s music on the upstairs dancefloor or downstairs by the booth. Raven provided someone to help clean up empty glasses and be available in the case that I wanted to get bottle service (which I opted out of ultimately because my friends all like different drinks). This was probably one of the cleanest bars I've been to in SOMA!\n\nI do recommend utilizing the free coat check because after about 11, the club got more crowded. The only negative aspect of the experience was that the 90s music provided by the DJ gave way to just beats by 1 AM, so I decided to call it a night once I couldn't belt out the words to Backstreet Boys any longer. \n\nOverall, it was a very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend this venue for birthday parties, alumni reunion events, or just a great night out!", "author": "Veronica P."}

We sat at the bar and now know the bartenders enough to just say, \"Please give me a drink!\" and they know what we like to make the perfect drink.  For example, the apple pie shots Dave made for us were sweet enough to drink without grimacing but strong enough to have us stumbling in 5 minutes.  Mimosas were an amazing ratio of 10:1 champagne to OJ and Lychee Mojitos weren't overpowering with mint, which I loved since I could taste the lychees more.  They also have a drink called Anchor Whet(?) that is a delicious mix of whiskey and Anchor Steam.  We've also thrown our NYE party and watched the Superbowl here (don't say anything about bad JuJu please) and had an amazing time both times (until the end of the game of course).      \n\nPoint of the review...get to know the bartender and every bar will be your favorite!", "author": "Jane N."}

Why do I know this? Don't ask. I guess something about this building just attracts a lot of Asians. Not complaining, just pointing out the obvious.\n\nSOMA is hands down my favorite neighborhood. We are all guilty of throwing someone into a box in this city. Ie: mission hipster, marina bro, pac heights snob, not-really-in-sf sunset, etc.\n\nI would consider myself a SOMAian; yes, I just made that up.... And I own it.\n\nRaven is up there as a favorite. Notably, its happy hour brings in a mixed crowd of professionals and have a nice drink menu and beer selections. Happy hour is usually limited to the front bar downstairs while occasionally the back bar will be opened, but usually for private parties. Come 9pm, a line forms, a cover is implemented and the crowd gets a tad younger. Downstairs is typically mix up while upstairs is 90s hip hop and pop (see, Brittany Spears, NSYNC, etc.). I didn't like that music when I was in middle school, much less that I'm nearing 30. The crowd isn't very diverse yet more diverse than origin (if you know, then you know) but everyone is friendly enough. Most come and stay in their little cliques and dance in circles while singing along to the video. Also, as others mentioned, it gets pretty steamy upstairs due to the crowd and lack of ventilation. Thank god Asians aren't hairy and musty (kidding?)\n\nThe upstairs could use more bartenders at peak hours. At one point, I waited nearly 20 minutes for a drink so I found myself doubling up to avoid coming back for a wait. That said, everyone from bartenders, door guys and management are always super nice and personable. I've chatted with a handful of them over the past few years and have no complaints.\n\n\nAll in all, a solid/fun spot in SOMA (for fellow SOMAians) to come in and reminisce the simpler times when your only worry in the world is feeding your Tamagotchi in time so it doesn't die. It'd be hard pressed for this to be a final destination for me, but it's definitely worth a visit if you're next door at bloodhound or SOMA beer store.", "author": "Ryan L."}

A wide selection from Top 40 hits now and from 1999.  It was a random mix but I had fun nonetheless.  The scene is fun and being in my mid-twenties, it was fun dancing and signing to to songs from when I was in middle school.  Songs from BSB, Britney Spears, Jagged Edge. It puts a smile to my face now as I am typing this because these songs are so old but once you hear the first note, you start singing along as if you heard it the day before.  Drinks are average, the bartenders are pretty quick and attentive.  Didn't have to wait too long to get a bartender's attention. Restrooms can get crowded.  Doesn't matter if you try the ones upstairs or downstairs, you will still probably have to wait.\n\nThere are A/C units around the dancefloor.  Try to find where the air is being blasted.  Nothing better than a little refreshing cool air to keep you for burning up (literally). You are probably burning up the dancefloor, which you should do.

I tried signing up for guestlist for free entrance before 11pm on Saturday but when I tried on a Tuesday or Wednesday, guest list was already closed. So my advice is that if you know you are gonna go to Raven, you should guestlist asap haha. That night I had to pay $10 regardless so we strolled on by at 11:15pm and there was a huge line out the door. After 11pm, they really do hold up the line and at first I thought it was to make the place look poppin but there is a capacity limit since the place is pretty small. It is a bar/lounge/dance club with a small dance floor on top so you cant fit as many people as the Grand. I guess that is what gives it its charm and why I like this place so much. I finally got in around midnight and was ready to dance the night away.\n\nMUSIC\nThere was actually a line to go upstairs to the dance floor and it was quite annoying to stand in two lines to get to dance but it was totallyyy worth it. The floor was packed but I made my way and omgosh the MUSIC!!! They had Nsync, Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Beyonce, Kesha and ALLL THE GOODIES. I WAS IN MUSIC DANCING HEAVEENN. They have the music video playing in the background as well. This is seriously the best music I have ever heard because it has the good late 90's and early '00s music, some of the older dancable music, and some modern hip stuff. I dont think I have ever given a dance club, especially one in SF, 5 stars but it totally deserves it. I will definitely be celebrating my birthday here! I went to request my two fave dance songs and numba one is Return of the Mack but I should have known that this DJ already played it. I was disappointed but I realized this guy is good. The DJ plays every weekend it seems like so I am feeling that. My second song is Too Close by Next and thank goodness he didnt play it yet. Usually you have to wait a bit for the DJ to play your requested song but he played it two songs later and I totally gave him a high five.I complimented a guy in a suit behind the bar and asked if he was the manager. He was and at first he thought I was complaining but I just wanted to show my appreciation. I complimented the place and he gave me 4 passes for free entrance and skip the line privileges. Score one for me! I hope you are reading this, but thank you!\n\nATTIRE\nThe attire here is pretty chill and you def do not have to go all out with the Grand status clothes. I saw girls in jeans and guys looking casual but some people dressing up as well. I would feel inappropriate wearing like a tight dress and heels so if anything, I would wear a shirt and skirt with flats. The whole point is to feel comfortable and dance the night away :)\n\nCROWD\nYes, it is true that this place is mostly Asians in their mid late twenties and early thirties. It is a good looking crowd compared to other hip hop, top 40, pop dance clubs. I got there after midnight so I noticed all the guys had already prowled on the crowd so I guess if you are there to meet people, get in on guestlist and before 11pm so you can venture and not have to wait in that long line. I like that the guys here are not creeps as well and do not just stand at the dance floor staring at the girls dancing. \n\nPARKING\nParking is quite difficult so good luck finding! I cant really give you advice here.\n\nI have never been so satisfied with a club ever. Music and people cant get better than this!

I enjoyed the music (old school 90's/hip-hop) and we all had a great time. I decided to celebrate my birthday here as well, did my research, checked out their website, etc. I got intouch with the General Manager David, who explained the details of hosting an event here. Since this was my first experience having a table at Raven's Bar, I assumed in order to reserve a table you would need to purchase a bottle which you didn't, unlike most places! I ended up purchasing a bottle anyways, since I thought it would be well worth it. I love how they didn't try to rob you for your money when throwing a party here. They offer free coat check all night which is amazing! \n\nOk, now that you know Raven does not try to rob you for your money, I want to share my overall experience last Friday night for my birthday. A group of my friends and I arrive a little before 10pm, no lines no list yet, which was quick and easy. (I suggest getting there early to hold your table). I get to my table and they had a \"Happy Birthday\" sign in my area and signs saying \"reserved for Gracielle's party\" (totally VIP) we got our wrist bands to get upstairs. The bartenders were super nice and I must say the whole staff was too!!! Ok, not only did they make my party VIP exclusive, and special. David also gave me extra VIP cards for next time and a Happy Birthday card/Thank you note for celebrating with them! Wait, there's more, David also gave me a \"Birthday Girl\" tiara! Which I thought was so sweet and super cute! \n\nI honestly, have never been in such an epic bar/lounge like this one! This place is awesome! The only thing I could possibly wish for is more restrooms and for them to renovate to a bigger bar. Because it can get really hot and extremely crowded inside. Other than that, the service is great, ambience is great, music is great, and of course the alcohol is great! ;)", "author": "Maria Gracielle Y."}

SF winds don't play.\nNumber 2: It was raining this past weekend and they were nice enough to have people line up in the alley where there were canopies so that people won't get wet.\nNumber 3: If you were single during Valentine's Day weekend, you got a pink bracelet to let others know that you are ready to mingle! (Why don't more bars do this? It would greatly reduce the amount of guys getting shot down with \"Sorry, I have a boyfriend.\")\n\nAlright onto the...VENUE\nRaven is two floors, both have a dance area. I like the downstairs area better because it has two bars, instead of one, so it's much faster to get a drink. Also, I love that they play all my favorite jamz from the 80s and 90s. I also can guarantee that you will hear a BSB and/or NYSNC song at least one throughout the night (I heard both and sang my heart out.) Like most places with a dance area, it gets sweaty, but they do try to pump up the AC every now and then (again, they're so considerate!)\n\nDRINKS\nThey have a specialty cocktail menu, with drinks starting around ~$10. I tried \"The Raven\", which was ok, but I also went to Local Edition the night before and their drinks were much tastier. They also have some fresh beers on tap, which they serve in mason jars. Nice touch.\n\nATTIRE\nDressy casual. Raven is great if you feel like dressing up, or not. They don't have a super strict dress code. I like that.\n\nOverall, would come back.", "author": "Vicki C."}

It's all thanks to the pretentious prick who calls himself a \"bartender.\" I came here last Friday (1/17) to grab some drinks and catch up with friends. We were in the back bar area on the first floor, when I came up to the \"bartender\" to order a round of drinks for my group. He immediately made eye contact and nodded his acknowledgement of me. I courteously waited my turn, and when he was ready, I made my request. I got my drinks right away and showed my appreciation with a 25% tip.\n\nWhen I found out that I had ordered the wrong drink for a friend, I came back to the bar.  The \"bartender\" acknowledged me, and I requested the correct drink. I was ready to pay for my own mistake, as I was standing around, holding my credit card. I saw him making 2 drinks, took a drink request from the group of girls that arrived AFTER me, saw him making drinks for them, and another drink or two for someone else. I tried to make eye contact, but he avoided me like the plague. My bf checked up on me to see why I was still waiting so long at the bar. Finally, I politely informed the \"bartender\" that I've been waiting for my drinks for quite a while. His reaction took me by surprise because I was being polite the entire time.\n\nHe hissed at me that he's in the services industry, and people in the services industry tend to forget. On top of that, he told me to find another bartender to make me my drinks!\n\nWell, if you're in the services industry, and you see a customer lingering around trying to make eye contact with you, shouldn't you follow up with your customer to ensure that he/she's been taken care of? That's what I would do, as I was in the services industry myself. Nor would you ever stoop so low as to react in such an immature and unprofessional fashion, especially to a customer who was generous to you.\n\nBeing a bartender means servicing each and every customer with consistency and with the highest level of professionalism, not making fancy drinks to whomever you please and being a snot while you're at it.

Another thing that I didn't particularly like about the venue is that drinks were getting spilled everywhere and the floor was wet and often gross and I didn't spot too many staff around cleaning things up and keeping things from just getting SLOPPY. \n\nThe crowd (2/5) : You see a lot of younger faces here - everybody looked like they had a newly minted fake or just crossed the line of 21. This isn't the financial district or marina crowd. There are a lot of RUDE people dancing like they don't care throwing arms everywhere, people who wouldn't let you through the crowd and a bunch of awkward asians taking selfies. \n\nThe music (4.5/5) : The DJ's do a good job of hitting a lot of hip hop/pop jams... but at the same time i'm in my mid 20's and i could barely recognize some of the oldies they played. Still good to whippin my hair back and forth though.  If you're looking for an EDM type vibe, it wasn't there. They had music videos playing on the walls on the second floor. \n\nBartenders (5/5) : One guy I swear looks like Ryan Gosling. They deserve an extra star for this.  The bartenders themselves are great. They make drinks quickly, don't ignore you, aren't snotty and serve the pretty people first. Only downside --- they bartenders pour just a little too much over the rim and most drinks just end up spilled everywhere. Well drinks and shots $7, pretty standard. \n\nVerdict: The overall vibe at this place is one that could be summed up as: Divey, chic-ratchet, dancing on the line of  trashy and classy, yet a SOLIDLY fun night. Good bartenders, 2 dance floors, poppin' music will ensure you a fun night. Just remember to not accidentally fall on your butt, laugh at the awkward kids taking selfies, and whip your hair back n forth!", "author": "Christine B."}

There was a short line when we got there around 10pm, but luckily we were on the guestlist so we didn't have to wait long at all. \n\nThe music was definitely on point - top 40s and 90s! We danced for awhile upstairs, but it eventually got too crowded and stuffy up there, so we made our way downstairs. We ended up hanging out in the corner of the downstairs bar near the front door. This is where the real fun began!\n\nOur bartenders were the best! They were super attentive and made amazing shots. They definitely gave VIP treatment to our bride-to-be!

Two friends of mine, including myself, reserved a large section for our birthday this week. It was a great time for most of the time. We had nearly 50 friends join us, and every single person bought several drinks from the bar. When the final set of our friends arrived, we venture upstairs to dance the night away. Several songs in, a friend of mine, who was visiting from France, pulled up a song on her phone, and showed it to the DJ (Mark Andrus). People had been requesting songs all night long, so we figured, no problem, he will definitely play this top 10 dance track. He grabbed her phone and swung over to his laptop, we thought it was in. He motioned for my friend to join him at the side door where the DJ enters and exits the booth. \n\nWe followed her over, and he said, word for word.. \"I will never play this F***ing song, if you want to hear a song by someone who has a F****ing voice, then come talk to me, but I will never play this..\"\n\nIt caught us all by surprise.. We were annoyed, but we figured, what ever, we'll just continue dancing to his flop dance tracks that he mixed in with every top dance song from the early 2000's.. No problem, we'll continue having our party...\n\nAbout 1 min later, we watched him motion for security, and he told security my friend needed to leave. There was no reason for him to do this. I asked security why she had to leave and he said \"I don't know man, the DJ just said she needed to go, I'm just security..\" -- A pretty lame answer. So we all left, every last person from my party walked out of the bar, and I watched the bar empty out quickly. \n\nOnce outside, I asked to speak to the manager.. I wanted to speak to him on the situation, and also because the VIP bar still had my credit card and a lot of our belongings in our reserved section. After a lot of begging and pleading, they called the manager out, and he spoke with me and let me retrieve all of our belongings. He basically said \"Oh well\" about the DJ situation, which is the main reason I am so annoyed. There are hundreds of better DJ's in the Bay Area that would gladly take the job of this a-hole, and would perform which a much high finesse and sense of professionalism. \n\nI won't be returning here, nor will any of my friends, and I will be sure to let anyone thinking about coming to this bar know about this very unprofessional experience.", "author": "Nic A."}

I've been coming here casually for many years for the awesome late 90s early 2000s hip hop, friendly bartenders, servers and management. I can't say the same for the front door this particular night.  As someone referred to this security guy as the \"bull dog\", he treated my guest list(happy birthday list) like crap. We had bottle service and the list of names was to ensure they get in smoothly. Not the case. Friend approaches the front and tells security he is with our table but is still told he has to wait in the long line. I come out and tell the bouncer he is with our bottle service guest list.  He tells me he has to wait in line. It wasn't until I get the manager that the guy eases up, even then he was still rude. \"Well then go get him..\"-security. As I come back with my friend he condescending says \"have a nice day\".   What's the point of your establishment paying for bottle service and having the guests wait in line? The \"bull dog\" needs to find a solution to help guests not be an impediment to an establishment's good will clients.  Management is always great but bouncers need work. I would suggest the bouncer needs more training.", "author": "Andrew J."}

It's really a great atmosphere to just have fun with your friends, drink, dance, chat. \n\nThe cons... the inability to move at a reasonable speed between the upper and lower levels. Traffic jams were so bad it took us 10 minutes, including the line at the stairs, just to move between the levels. They need to find a better strategy to get people moving. Also, there were so many people upstairs that in some sections I thought I was going to have a panic attack from feeling claustrophobic! \n\nI am not sure why the lower level is so unpopular...

The ingredients include light rum, tea, fig, and lime, and all I can say is that the drink could've been saved if they had used a more earthy and creamier spirit, perhaps bourbon, in place of the light rum, and if they had been a little less heavy-handed with the lime juice.  Instead it seemed like the flavors were fighting instead of harmonizing with each other.  Moreover, my drink was pretty weak.  $9 for a bad tasting, not even strong cocktail from a place that prides itself on being a cocktail bar?

I tried reasoning with him, telling him we've been up there all night, our friends are there, we had a tab open upstairs, and our coats were up there too-- I even showed him the coat check slip. His answer: \"No wristband, no dancing.\" I don't even know what wristbands he was referring too, since no one else was wearing one and we were up there for hours and never offered one. Throughout the whole conversation, he was incredibly rude and completely unreasonable. He told me I should have planned better and stayed upstairs \"cause there's no way you're getting back up.\" \n\nAt that point, my bf and I decided we wanted to leave, so I told the bouncer that we needed to go up to get our coats. He wasn't even going to let us up for that. First, he said that he would get them so that I don't go upstairs. I said no to that--I didn't want him touching my things.

I would start every morning and end every night with a fruity concoction; I would hook up an IV of St. Germain to my veins 24/7 and I would hire mixologists for every party I threw if it weren't so expensive and unhealthy and likely to kill me. I believe you can find nirvana at the bottom of a martini glass, so for me, a cocktail bar is church.\n\nRaven Bar is an above-average church with a charismatic pastor. And by that I mean the bartender we had was fast, attentive, generous, talented and extremely friendly. The drinks are ambitious but not quite in that Tier 1 of Cocktails I have for mindblowingly original, unique creations.\n\nBetween the two of us, my friend and I tried the Melissa's Peachy Lychee, Max's Herbal Remedy and The Raven. Max's was definitely my favorite. It featured fresh basil (sprigs of the herb were literally right in front of me) mixed with sour and sweetness for a heavenly aroma that fills your senses. It was so good, my friend ordered it again. The Peachy Lychee was very fruity and very sweet, but missing that extra kick. I think it might have been because the lychees came from a can and anyone who's eaten lots of fresh lychees can taste the difference The namesake cocktail had a really interesting combination of ingredients, but unfortunately, most of it was lost to the overwhelming flavor of the rum (particularly the cinnamon zest).\n\nI agree with other reviewers' complaints about the space. Raven Bar has a long, narrow layout so it feels suffocating no matter where you are. Personally, I'd recommend sitting at the bar unless you really need privacy. That said, the interior is quite dark and romantic, with strategically-placed lighting creating a delicious medley of shadows into which you can disappear if you should so choose. I'd definitely recommend it as a post-dinner destination, particularly if you're on a date.", "author": "Josephine L."}

They started with 90s hip hop and R&B, which was perfect because that's what we grew up listening to. Once the music changed, we went back to our seats. But that's when the party really started. Want to know? This lady is keeping hush hush. \n\nAll the bartenders were REALLY attentive. Probably also because it was a bachelorette party, there were 10 of us, and we were all wearing extremely short skirts with really high heels.

Instead of playing the typical top 40s, they would play a bunch of music from the 90s and 2000s with a few more recent hits in there. Also the fact that they had the music videos for all the songs playing on a bunch of tvs and even projected on the wall of one of the sides of the upstairs dance floor.\n\nThey also had a small area setup on the first floor where my friend was able to do the whole birthday cake and song thing. Only downfall is that it's right in the middle of the 1st floor where everyone needs to walk past if they wanna go beyond the 1st bar, so I felt like we were in the way of so many people. \n\nThey also have a large smoking patio which was cool as I was able to sit outside and catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in years but because it was so large I wasn't surrounding in 2nd hand smoke with was great for me as a nonsmoker. One thing that did suck though was the fact that the upstairs only had 1 bathroom so there was a line for the men's and woman's. I saw a few people watching all the music videos while waiting and getting distracted so they didn't notice the previous person walk out so a few times people would just swoop and cut in there before they noticed.\n\nOverall I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again if my friends wanna go out in the city.

Since it was a fairly small bar, most of my friends occupied the whole bottom floor. \n\nBartenders here are extremely good looking :)", "author": "Phuong V."}

We got there early maybe 9:35 on a Saturday, so we missed the line and missed the $10 cover.  \n\nThe bartenders were very nice, i asked if they could make a mojito, since it was still super chill at the lower bar.  Then around 10:30 it started to get really busy, we moved upstairs and it was like packed sardines, barely able to move. But super fun with the 90's music! I did like the music, its a nice change from EDM music.  \n\nDrinks aren't too expensive, and there always seemed to be a path to the bar (upstairs).  I think their popular bartender (looks like Ryan Gosseling from the side) was downstairs, it was way too hard to get a drink downstairs.  \n\nSuper fun! Glad we decided to come to this bar.", "author": "Kristin I."}

Fit for someone from the 90s~ Ample space over two floors.\nTurnaround: Good-Excellent. No line!\nService: N/A. Unless you count the security greeting us.\n\nI usually try to get on the guest list so that I do not need to pay cover, but this was a spur of the moment thing so I came unannounced, but for $10, no biggie. The place is two stories with a bar on both levels and tables places throughout with actual rooms in the back. Not high-class, but not the dive-bar kind of feel either. The front is actually made to feel a little classier in my opinion. They were playing 90s music the Friday night I went so the nostalgia I felt probably made me like this place even more. Not to mention, given the space spread over two floors, I had ample room to dance without bumping into people or others spilling their drinks on me. Unfortunately, the area around the bar is narrow and always crowded so moving THROUGH the club poses a problem. When we came, there was no line and we were admitted in practically no time at all. Drinks were also made quickly with no delay so overall I definitely had a fun time here.", "author": "Jenny W."}

Things that sold me about this place:\n         -Easy street parking\n         -Free cover before 11p\n         -Hip-hop Friday nights\n         -DANCING\n         -3 Bars for drinking\n         -2 Floors for dancing\n         -Not your everyday, EDM, obnoxiously over crowded club\n\nWent here on a Friday night. Online you can sign up on their guest list and there's no cover if you get in before 11pm. \n\nThe night started out when I touched down at SFO around 10pm. Clay picked me up from the airport and we took the 15min drive over to Raven's Bar. The area isn't filled with a bunch of clubs and is very low key, which was nice - it made parking extremely easy and we only had to walk 2 short blocks to the bar. The outside isn't much, small and quaint. Inside is small and tight at first but it opens up as you walk further in. I believe I counted a total of 3 bars. One when you first walk in, one in the back and one upstairs. This place is like a dive-lounge, it's an interesting feel. There looked like there was a small dance space downstairs, but we wanted to check out upstairs more. There's a long bar and then a small dance floor to the side covered by large tv's. They were playing music video's that matched up with the rad Hip-Hop that was bumpin' all night (totally fun & cool). The DJ was great! Good mix of old school and new school Hip-Hop, great dancin' music!\n\nBartenders were great! I was always able to grab a drink. All cocktails were about $10-11 a piece. All my drinks were strong and doing everything they were supposed to. The dance floor became really crowded, but it was an awesome crowd. I danced the whole night away with my man! And loved every minute of it! They had great music, lights and smoke at our feet. Which if you're going to fog the room, I like it at your feet vs.up in your air. \n\nThis may be my new favorite dancing spot in the city. It's fun, but low key at the same time. It makes it easy to disappear and go out dancing for the night without it becoming too big a deal. I would definitely recommend the Raven to anyone looking for a fun night out.", "author": "Jordan G."}

We were so thick back there that others attempting to use the bar really had to work for it.\n\nThe whole place was packed. The dance floors upstairs and down were really jumping; but they are a bit on the small side (which is why my awkward white butt stayed off it...

The prices were really reasonable and the tab at the end was much better than expected; so that just made the night even better.\n\nThe music was a pretty decent mix (which should tell you nothing because I can't dance, so what the hell do I know, right?) with a range of house and 80's on up. And, this will seem really weird, but it seemed as though the music got better and better as we drank more and more; I think the drinks might be magic...\n\n... come to think of it, everyone got better and better looking at the same rate - OMG, the drinks ARE magic! ...\n\nI recommend - Go check 'em out.", "author": "Christopher J."}

My girls and I got to dance freely without any contact from creepers (aside from a pair of sweaty drunk boys that I didn't realize were not gay).. but a lot of the guys on the dance floor got some action going on. You don't need details regarding that, but it was liberating to have our own space! \n\nLove the layout of the bar, downstairs is lounge with two bar areas and some dance floor space, while upstairs is another dance floor with it's own bar. The music downstairs is a combo of top 40 + 90's (perfect!). The upstairs is more house music, but it's a lot more spacious for dancing. I spent most of my time upstairs until it got extremely hot  and the condensation fogged up the windows-- then I went downstairs and requested a song.. and the DJ played it 3x IN A ROW (prob to kill me). Gangnam style danced for 10+ minutes. \n\nTRY THESE DRINKS: Fruity drink lovers, get the Liquid Marijuana (don't think it's on menu but seriously delish), the Apple poe (stronger on the alc), or Lychee Bliss.\n\nNote: Not a fan of the Herbal Remedy drink.. it's taste is of Chinese herbal teas + basil.

Lounge in the middle, and dance floor upstairs. Fun mix of music from 80s-now with music videos to match.\n\nDownsides are the few bathrooms this place has... One M & one F bathroom downstairs, and 2 unisex bathrooms upstairs. The last time I came here we were hanging out upstairs, saw a long line for the bathrooms, so decided to try downstairs. When we got to the bottom of the stairs there was a line to go back upstairs. Had they told us at the top that if we go down we would have to wait in line to come up again, that would have been ok. But there was no notification. Thus we were stuck downstairs for the rest of the night.\n\nBy 10:30 on a Sat night the place is already pretty crowded with birthday groups.

From time to time filthy transients made their way in to requests water or something while scratching as if they had pockets full of ants and we were all on alert to watch our personal belongings. The bartenders were only moderately friendly. In fact, they could not wait to go home, evidenced by the fact that at exactly 1:59 am they ordered us to put our drinks on the table and they stopped the music mid-song.  The DJ was pathetic. He refused requests and played the same house music beat over and over. At one point I offered the bartender our IPod so we could hear a decent song and he actually acquiesced! \n\nIf t weren't for the relatively nice appearance, you would think this was a dive bar.

We were initially supposed to hang out at Bloodhound, but the lounge was pretty full and way too loud. We would have to scream at each other over drinks in order to communicate. I was totally not diggin that...lol\n\nSo we decided to check out Raven's Bar instead and the ambience was pretty cool. It has a narrow layout with more floor space towards the back of the bar. At first, it seemed like the place was slightly crowded, but it was not overbearing. We ordered our drinks, which the bartender served right away. It's always a plus when bartenders serve drinks immediatley with minimal wait! And the pinot gris on the wine menu was definitely refreshing, just like our bartender recommended! Now that i look back on that night, i think he was the only bartender working. I'm pretty impressed the wait was not long to get a drink! \n\nThe music was pretty cool too. It was upbeat songs that were up to date, yet not to trashy or trancy or hippity hoppity (i think i just made up some words there...) To keep it simple, they were a mixture of songs you can hear on K-Fog, Alice and 94.9 strategically blended together with a smooth transition so each song doesn't clash and interrupt my intimate conversation with my friend! \n\nOverall, it was a great night.

Had been to Raven once before and really enjoyed myself, so I reached out through their website to host a party. Was contacted by management same day, and they set my group up with a fantastic table and an ample sized guest list. Everything went extremely smoothly day of, and we'll definitely be back.\n\nMy only complaint would be how hot it gets on the upstairs dance floor on both occasions I've been there. The place is always packed, which is surely one cause, but if they could open up some of the windows that would be a huge improvement. Still a great place to spend your night!", "author": "Tamiz A."}

The downstairs music was all those great 90's pop hits you know and love and upstairs was current alternative dance music (like Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Goldfrapp, etc.).  It was the best of both worlds!\n\nThere were 3 bars (2 smaller bars downstairs and 1 larger bar upstairs that opens later when the top floor opens for dancing) and quite a few places to sit if you wanted to take a break from the dancing.  I arrived a little after 9 and missed happy hour (dang), but there was no cover (yay).  They had quite a few cocktails on the menu that were Raven specialties, but I didn't have any and can't comment on them except price (average was around $8, which is pretty standard for a club).  I can say that the bartender was really sweet and I got a club soda for free (nice touch). \n\nI definitely want to come back and try out happy hour sometime since the bar is located near several restaurants that I like (Citizen's Band, Radius, Basil, and Triptych) and then return later if it's a Friday when Club Vogue is there again! \n\nOh, I should also comment that the remodel is beautiful.  I was here once before when it was another bar/club and it wasn't anything special, but it's so much nicer now.  Very clean and modern look.", "author": "Kimberly B."}

The bartenders were competent and quick and don't deserve this rating.  The rest of the staff I should get ZERO stars.  The bouncers pulled out weapons on me for no reason!\n  \nI was at Raven for a birthday party on a Friday night.  It was a 90's night and the music was so-so for the 90's.  We had two of the big booths reserved for our party which totaled around 20 or so.  Other than the people that were with us the bar was pretty dead.  At one point there were maybe 10-15 people also there not from our party.  Overall pretty lame night.\n\nOne of my friends arrived late and had too much to drink before arrival.  He was not aggressive just a little sleepy.  A bouncer asked him to leave, which I have no problem with as he was in no shape to be hanging out any more.  I went to check on him on the street and he explained that a bouncer called him a racial slur.  Now I don't know if this is true as my friend was drunk but I have not known him to lie like this in the past.  None the less I waited outside with him till the rest of our party could leave.  While standing on the sidewalk near the edge of their building I was startled by one of the bouncers at the door who had his STUN GUN out and was pointing it in our direction and had it turned on. There were no other people around, we were not yelling or making aggressive behavior, and I was babysitting my friend.  \n\nTHERE IS NO REASON TO PULL OUT A WEAPON!!  \n\n20 min later asked us to move down the road and I explained that I had called a Cab and we were leaving as soon as it arrived.  The bouncer with the stun gun was still very aggressive and pissed at us, for almost no reason at all.  I would think that being a bouncer you would have some sort of professionalism in your job instead of waving weapons around.\n\n At the same time as this was going on outside another bouncer approached my wife and two friends who were having a conversation and told them they needed to leave as you could not sleep in the bar.  None of them were sleeping!  They basically harassed the only customers they had on a Friday night.  \n\nAvoid this bar at all costs!", "author": "Matt M."}

There was no line, and we paid a $10 entrance fee to get in.  As soon as I walked in, I heard Backstreet Boys and i knew this was the spot.  There was a good amount of people downstairs but towards the back there was a stairway that lead upstairs to a main dance floor.  We waited a couple minutes as security in front said upstairs was at maximum capacity.  After a short wait we went up and HOLY CRAP it was paaaacked.  But, it was a great little dance floor.   (Also there is FREE coat-check upstairs.  Whaaaaat?)  They played all the old hip-hop/r&b/pop jams and had a good mix of new popular songs too.  I also liked that they played the music videos.

We were promised seating to buy a bottle. When we arrived he was nowhere to be found, even though we were told we \"had\" to check in with him for seating. When we asked various staff where he could be found we were scoffed at and told to wait. When David was finally located (in the apparent vast enormity of Raven Bar), we were told there was no seating available. We got 2 drink tickets for a group of 4 which just seemed like an embarrassingly charitable pat on the back. \nAt one point David came back and told us a table had just cleared up and that we would finally be able to buy a bottle (seriously? all I want is to GIVE you my money, can it really be this hard?). But surprise! By the time David had made his rounds and spoken to every single one of his friends on our way to \"our\" table it had already been taken. What's more? You cannot purchase a bottle when you do not have a table. \n\nI'm never going back. This place is a joke.", "author": "Marie-Claude R."}

They played mostly your late 90's and early 2000's hip-hop music and this place gets crowded. I would suggest for you to show up around 10PM so, you wouldn't have to wait in line just to go to the upper level which was craccccckinnnnn'. This place is small as other reviewers had mentioned, but it isn't tiny. You have enough room to chit chat with your groups of friends while you shake your bootay. I'm glad I gave this place a try.

Everything about the ambiance made it appealing to me -- I'm not a big fan of the club scene at all, and especially not for hosting my own birthday at one. That's why I love Raven because it's more of a bar feel than anything, with the upstairs almost like a little lounge. \nAnyways, so I made reservations to host my birthday in November and the manager, Vince, was more than helpful. He booked me the upstairs private seated area two months in advance and not to mention everything was free. No charge for the table, no charges for bottle service, no mandatory spending amount -- nothing! It's not common you find a lounge with perks like this. Oh and I got there and there were two huge \"happy birthday\" banners in our section as well.. so sweet. Anyways, all in all, after my party last night I can honestly say it was one of the best nights out I have had. \n\nOnly reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars was because of the music. When we first got there it was around 10:45 and they had been playing 80's club music for a good hour. Later I found out this was the DJ's specialty. I actually went up to the booth to ask him if he had more of a selection for the rest of the night. Around 11:30 the vibe changed to mostly top 40's and some random 90's songs (TLC- Waterfalls, lol).

There's like two diff scenes here, if you like bar-bars.. stay downstairs, but if you like more of a club scene but not a full-on club.. go upstairs. \n\nThe staff here is cool. They might not notice who got to the bar first to order, but that's typical. Depending on the bartender they may make you a custom drink (I asked what mixed-vodka drink they recommend and Tammy made a good mix for me). The shots are also big here, unless my cousin's friend was ordering double shots. So I had to ask for a chaser (I never use chasers, might've been my lack of party-mode), anyways I wanted a juice chaser since soda makes me tear (haha! yea I'm odd). So the cute dancing bartender upstairs hooked it up with a chaser that goes with my shot. I learned that pineapple \"masks the taste\" of vodka. OH! Also when they were shooing us off when they were closing.. I ran to the bar to ask if I can still get a glass of water. The guy teased me saying he can't since they stop serving after 2. But he gave me a glass of water anyways.. complete with a slice of lemon! Dang.. ahaha. \n\nThen by the end of the night I noticed I didn't have my card. So I emailed them and the manager responded even though he was on vacation. And they had my card all safe and sound! Yeayuh!\n\nAlso, when you call them.. they might startle you by greeting you by name. At least I got startled/baffled when they did it to me.

If you're not sure what to order, the bartender will gladly guide you to something delicious.\n\nThe second time I went in, I brought a friend (a habit I've developed) for happy hour.  We got through a few cocktails and were offered a free round.  What a nice gesture!  This is how it usually works at legit places: you are polite, you tip appropriately (AT LEAST $2 for every single drink - don't order three drinks and tip $2), and sometimes you get a free drink or two.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely do not tip with the expectation of getting one on the house, but I've noticed it happens.  Again, a very nice gesture, and a smart one, because you tell your friends you found a kick ass spot, bring them in and benefit the business.  Regardless, the staff is amazing and they deserve to be tipped very well (no, I don't work here - I swear).\n\nI don't know what else to say.  I love '90s night on Thursdays.  You can get some great eats from Triptych.  It's a popular, yet personable establishment, which is what makes Raven rare.  I know the names of most bartenders.  I've patronized every night of the week and the crowd (if there even is one) has always been completely chill.  This is not Holy Cow.  Cheers!", "author": "D M."}

If you are looking for a place to eat beforehand, because you know you will need the food to absorb things, I recommend Basil Thai Restaurant, which is like a 30 sec walk from Raven. \n\nSince my party was 10+ people i emailed the bar a week before so that i could reserve a booth. The reservation process was super simple! I just emailed the bar and the next day i got a reply from the general manager, who was super nice and chill. Since Raven doesn't require a fee for reservations, minimum bar tab, or bottle service, it is very nice on your wallet. You can save the extra money for the yummy cocktails they offer. However, if you wanted bottle service you can always get it at the place too. The bottle service girl was super friendly, helpful, and showed some of the girls in my party a thing or two on how to have some fun on the dance floor. \n\nThe music was so-so. We went on a Saturday and the music selection was old school and top 40's. I am not a fan of the EDM or House music so I opted for the stuff i hear on the radio (instead of grooving in the car i can now dance it out in a club). We got to Raven at 10 pm and the old school music was a little too old school for us. Which was okay because then we could just focus on what drinks to get. Fortunately , around 12 am until closing the music became a little less old school and more of the recent stuff we all know and love from the radio. They also have a bigger dance floor upstairs, so you can strut more of your stuff. \n\nSince it was my birthday celebration, i blacked out probably 3 hours after i got to Raven, so i don't remember much after i hit the dance floor. Surprise Surprise. However, the next morning all my guest told me how happy they were at the club and how cute and friendly all the staff at Raven was to all of us. \n\nBottom line: If you are looking for a club to go to, Raven should be one to check out! Great drinks for a very decent price and plenty of dancing room for all. Plus the staff was really great! Definitely coming back here again, but sober for the most part!", "author": "Danna L."}

I had just heard about the place on Thrillest, so with dining close by, it seemed like the obvious choice. In the pictures it looked like a cool lookin' lounge, but once inside, it seemed much different. It was loud and clubby (Soma style), and filled with young kids. Not really our scene. We decided to at least stay for a round, so our friend bought us 3 cinnamon whiskey shots. After a medium sized mouthful, I couldn't drink anymore....I'm sure it helped make my cab ride home blurry-- what was in those shots? Anyways, our friend also started chatting it up with someone who claimed \"it was his spot\", and bought us some free drinks, which he also claimed \"he usually doesn't do.\" Right dude, we really believe you. \nEven though we weren't sure about the place, I glanced around and it seemed like it would be a somewhat cool place to go during happy hour or when it's been on the block longer than however long it has been open.", "author": "Sonya D."}

There was just the right amount of Bon Jovi being played, and I went home with a soar throat from singing in a circle amongst 30 of my friend's closest friends. \nWe celebrated a birthday massacre here. It was fun, a little messy, and we still aren't sure about a few odd details that we're deciphering from photo evidence. But that's okay, we were celebrating. \nThe drinks aren't cheap, the location is a little further from BART than I usually like to be, and I thought the description was a bit off. If Edgar Allen Poe and Humphrey Bogart were to meet for a drink, they'd probably go to Rick House, Local Edition, or even Vesuvio. But this place? Likely not. \nIt's an okay spot- it's trendy, and had a good bartender in the back who must have injected a RedBull into his forearm before coming in for his shift. The pours were consistent (wouldn't call them generous) and the place got a little crowded toward the 11:00 hour.

I worked with David on my reservation. He was so nice and always replied to my emails right away. You don't have to do bottle service and can just reserve a booth, which I think is wonderful. Besides the fact this bar is so fun, that was another huge reason why I reserved a booth. I ended up doing bottle service, which was a wonderful idea. When I got to the bar I didn't know who to speak to about my reservation so I asked a bartender and he responds saying \"The bottle service girl. She is walking around, you'll find her.\" Not going to lie I was like seriously? How is that helpful for anyone? They had my name on the booth and even did birthday decorations, which I thought was so nice. We were there for about 15 min and still no one came up to welcome us or anything, so I went to the back bar and was able to find the person  I needed to speak with. After that the night was a blast.

Sitting down at the bar - a very over-lit one at that - I ordered one of their special drinks, The Raven, and dove into conversation and calm.  Glancing up, I couldn't help noticing the television screen, with a baseball game on, above the bar. Yikes.  Then came,..well,... .yes,... Brittany Spears on the sound system,...and the Back Street Boys,... and on and on it went.  \nMy friend and I quickly drank our drinks and bolted, making quick calls to our other friends, telling them to instead meet us at the Stud, where darkness and killer music are pretty much the standard.  \nI hope that the management does something to get the bar's identity a tad more defined.

And the music was also on point: 80's and 90's hip hop and R&B played through most of the night, and it was only after midnight that music got kind of funky and too EDM-y (for the record, that is a made up genre and it is stupid).

The lighting is beautiful, the bartenders are friendly, and the cocktails inventive and delicious.  The new Raven has a number of new takes on classic cocktails and a couple of totally original inventions.  They've put heavy emphasis on fresh ingredients in the cocktails and the beer pours are very generous.  Can't recommend this place enough for a chill weeknight or a rockin' weekend.", "author": "Steve D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-21", "description": "I would have given Raven 3 stars had the staff not been total pricks. \n\nThis place is fun because it's truly a group of misfits. Lots of birthday party groups and bachelorette parties. Everyone has a good time because they are out with their friends and it's not really a \"scene\" of any sort. The music is old school, which I think is a hit because half of the crowd seemed to be made up of people who were probably saying to each other, \"Oh my god! I haven't been to a club in 10 years!\" They let in just about anyone. All ages, ethnicities, sizes, types, etc. \n\nThe venue is pretty low budg. Kind of like a diner that turns into a club at night. The tables are something you would see in an airplane or on a boat. Very narrow to try and make more room in the middle area dance floor thing. In most clubs this would just be the entry way into another room, but it was the dance floor here. \n\nI had a fun time with my friends because our crowd was similar to the one I described in my first paragraph. We could have been anywhere and had fun. My friends ordered bottle service, of which the items barely fit on our table. \n\nYou are probably asking, why only 1 star then??? That seems a little harsh. Well, because the bouncers and bus boy were horrendous. Considering my friends dropped a lot of cash at the place, we got less than par service. The one guy who was cleaning our table kept going over the couches where our purses and jackets were. He kept clearing glasses and drink before they were empty. This is a huge pet peeve of mine!!! We had 3 bottles of Vueve, a bottle of vodka, and whisky. DON'T TAKE OUR DRINKS WHEN THEY ARE HALF FULL. Period. It is so basic. This guy took so much of our alcohol, it was insulting. Then in his mission to clear our table every few minutes, drops a glass under the table (because of course he was on the couch/seat side), it shatters and we all feel glass hit our ankles, and wetness because .... yep, you guessed it, the glass wasn't empty because he was clearing a half full cocktail. He then proceeded to look up and say, \"don't worry, I got it.\" Uh...YA! I hope so. I'm not trying to be a pretentious bitch, but come on. No apology and then implying that he's doing us a favor by cleaning up the glass shards from the drink he dropped. \n\nThe last straw was that we were leaving and I told this same little shit that we would be heading out and could he get the caps to the bottles. He literally flips out on me, and starts screaming like he is ready to fight me. Super rude and sarcastically he said, \"Are you serious?! Are you serious?! ARE YOU REALLY FUCKING SERIOUS?! I dont' think so! You really think I'm that dumb. If I see you take this bottles out of here, I will get your ass.\" .... uhhhhhhhhhhh......ME = STUNNED. WTF just happened?? Oh my god. Not sure if he was on meth or what, but he freaked out. Ok, I just learned it's against the law to do that. I didn't realize that because other places must have turned a blind eye. \n\nThe next thing we know he has another bouncer and the manager. The bouncer comes over putting a flash light in our eyes. He was more calm, but still SUPER CONFRONTATIONAL. He stood about 3 inches from me and my friend asking us what our problem was, etc. To be honest it was quite embarrassing. Unfortunately, my drunken friend had already left with a bottle and was outside the bar. So, thinking that we were plotting against all of them, which we were not, and just wanted to be compliant, the little crazy one went outside and started yelling again and running up to her like he was going to attack my friend (honestly, I hope this is just a weird night) and the other flashlight guy came out too. In their toughest, scariest voices told my friend to stop, and then searched her body and purse and got the bottle. She had no idea what had gone on in the club, so was like a deer in headlights. After they got the bottle, the little guy continued to scream and yell at us as we were leaving. He was jumping up and pointing at us with his finger saying stuff like, \"That's right. You thought you were going to get away with this. I'm 24 and I'm smarter than you!\" (He actually said the thing about being 24 and smarter than us). \nI hope that this was a one-time unfortunate fluke. However, it was one of the most aggressive, unnecessarily confrontational events. It was weird and left a nasty taste in my mouth.\nOh, the main a$$hole guy I was taking about is about 5'7\" or 5'8\", half white, half African American, he's a bar back or bus boy type person, almost shaved head (very short hair). If you see him, run for the hills!", "author": "Shirin A."}

We were there early one night so we could unwind after work.  I liked how it was not over-crowded and loud at first, so we could actually have a conversation with friends.  The atmosphere was fun since the bartender got us to try a few new speciality drinks that matched our personalities well.  \n\nAs we stayed a little longer, and got more tipsy, the crowds came in and and it becamse a good party atmosphere, with a good mix of people.  Loved the hip music and trendy crowd.", "author": "Chris X."}

Bloodhound is pretty popular these days, so it's sometimes difficult to find a seat or have a conversation without yelling. The owners of Raven are super friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-11", "description": "Great first impression, decent ambience and good drinks. This place is cool, it looks like a bit divey in the front, loungey in the back, and hints of a small nightclub upstairs. Plenty of space with comfortable booths if you can get your hands on one. The place allows reservations on sections of the bar so don't be surprised if you are blocked off by a party or two. There is a total of three bars, two downstairs and one upstairs so make sure to get your drink on. Music varies with the nights. The lighting is a little tacky and if there's a party, the Happy Birthday decorations and balloons just makes it worse. As far as the drinks go, they have a huge selection across all three bars but only the front one makes their specialty drinks. Herbal Remedy and Hazel Eyes were good but not outstanding. Also, there's a 50% off all drinks on Scoutmob and Foursquare, so make sure you download those handy money-saving apps!", "author": "Ryan L."}

I made reservations two weeks in advance for two 10-person booths, and they held them with no charge and no minimum. For comparison, I shopped around at a few other comparable bars... Many had at least $1000 drink minimum / reserved charges for a group of 20, or charged a flat fee for the space.\n\nOn the day of the event, the other birthday boy and I showed up to find welcoming bartenders who had even decorated our booths with balloons and a happy birthday sign.\n\nI tried at least a sip of most cocktails on the menu, and honestly think they have a fun / creative mix that still all makes sense with their overall theme. And each of the main bartenders has their own signature drink, all of which we loved.\n\nKudos to you guys and gals @ Raven for making a great cocktail hour at the beginning of our birthday festivities. You rock.", "author": "Will C."}

I've been here twice now for Happy Hour and and just for drinks later on in the evening and I must say that I really like the place. I mean I liked it before when it was just Dragon but it's nice and a good spot to go to. It gets a little crowded at night but other than it's a chill but still fun atmosphere. They have TV's playing club music so it's not too boring. Prices are good too!", "author": "Heidi K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-17", "description": "I've only been here Friday and Saturdays and it's the same DJ both days playing pretty much the same set so it gets kind of repetitive, but he plays songs from the late 90's and early 2000's which is a nice change from all the current hip hop and edm going on. I wish he played more of a variety though. Definitely get there before 10:30 or else you have to pay a cover charge or $10, which is ridiculous but yet again I think any cover charge is ridiculous. The drinks are inexpensive so you won't be breaking and arm and a leg just trying to buy one drink! I would have given another star but there is a really douchey bouncer who thinks he is above everyone and totally just ticked me off. His attitude was completely unnecessary, too bad I didn't get his name. The wait time to go upstairs can be freaking ridiculous depending on who's the bouncer so if you wanna go upstairs, get there early. It's a small spot but a lot of fun with the right people.", "author": "Tori C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-08-08", "description": "For those of you who are looking for a bar that will provide you with a decent drink and good music, this is NOT the place. We went in to this bar after dinner at around 10:00pm and the bar was empty. We ordered quite a few drinks and every single one of them was weak. I can assure you my gin tonics were around 99.9% tonics with little to none gin. Some reviewers say their drinks were good. Well, a margarita can taste good too if it tastes like a lemonade but that's not what you are paying for. The bartenders are somewhat friendly but nothing to rave about. The music is great if you like the same music with a lot of repetitions. The DJ was unwilling to take our songs' requests which was kind of unusual. How could you be a DJ and refuse to take songs request? It's like a Chef refuses to cook. Understanding the bar was empty so it wasn't like he had his hands full. Given this bar is located in San Francisco and people have great choices to choose from I can't see why people would spend their good earned money there when they don't even have the very few basic things that a bar should have.", "author": "Viv M."}
