The whole dinner took about 2.5 hours long. \n\nFood:\nMy favorite nigiri were the blue shrimp, scallop, snapper with uni on top, snow crab, chu toro, uni, wagyu. \n\nTheir fish selection is fairly on the leaner side and the flavor is on the refreshing side for at least the first 8 nigiri. The last few pieces were the more heavy/ buttery fish including toro, uni and wagyu (for free). \n\nOne thing I liked about the sushi is that the rice portion is very small.\n\nPaired this meal with Dassai. It's a very refreshing and slightly sweet sake. $35/180ml bottle \n\nAmbience and service: \nI sat at the bar and our sushi chef created a very fun experience for us. He kept giving me extra pieces of toro on the side to be funny and also added an extra nigiri with no charge. \n\nThey can also switch out any fish that you don't like and substitute it with something else.", "author": "Teresa Z."}

The space is cozy and intimate; call ahead to make reservations, especially if you're coveting a seat at the bar (which you def should if you're doing omakase). \n\nFor omakase, there are three tiers, with the highest one being 12 pcs, which we both opted for. Tsubasa also offers some of the most reasonably priced deals I've seen for the level of quality and cuts served. Every single piece was fresh and loved the variety of more unique types of fish.

The unagi was nicely grilled and added a great flavor as well.\n-Oshizushi (pressed sushi with chopped blue fin tuna with scallions and sesame seeds): This was served as 7 pieces of sushi with freshly chopped wasabi and some chopped daikon. The flavors were amazing and this was definitely one of our favorites of the night.

They served big pieces of seafood over a small bite of rice, which reminded me of the portions we had in Japan. \n\nDessert\nBlack Sesame Panna Cotta: The panna cotta was smooth. It was served with anko (red bean paste) and some matcha powder. I loved the taste and flavor of the black sesame seed.

I was excited to try the 12 piece Omakase, but for $80 I don't think the flavors warranted the price tag. \n\nWagyu, Scallop, and Toro were my favorite. Note that the wagyu was ordered separately and didn't come with the 12 piece Omakase. It was super high quality meat that melted in your mouth. \n\nLeast favorite were all the pieces of sushi with shiso leaves. They was a bitter flavor to the leaves that completely overpowered the fish. Furthermore, the leaves added a dryness to the bite of the sushi that made it unappealing. I don't think I would of minded it that much, but it wasn't just 1 piece of sushi that had shiso but multiple pieces maybe 3. I also don't think the quality of the fish was at high as other Omakase places I've been to, especially the halibut which I love, but unfortunately it tasted a bit salty. \n\nI've also been to Omakase places, where each bite was very thoughtful and seemed to build flavors on top of the next bite.

The more extravagant rolls--like the holy crab roll aren't cheap but definitely worth trying. I actually preferred the simpler roll, the holy crab felt like a bit too much was going on and the crab kinda drowned out the eel, plus the sauce was more sweet than spicy while I was hoping for the opposite.

They take care to understand what your food preferences are, and if you are inclined to give them creative control - do it. Japanese food in the traditional way it would be served - how could we say no? \n\nThe previous time my friend and I dined there, we had just embarked on a keto journey (or at least I had), and she soon followed suit as Chef Chris proceeded to make us an entirely KETO OMAKASE dinner!!!! I couldn't believe my eyes. It left me so satisfied, and I didn't miss the sushi rice one bit. To be honest, I was almost ready to throw in the towel and forgo my keto commitment that day, but I didn't have to. The chefs delivered. That in and of itself is an example of how they will go above and beyond to make sure your time at Tsubasa is something that you will never forget. \n\nDo NOT leave there without asking trying their tiered tuna nigiri plate, in order from lean to fatty meat. Each piece is delightful, and has you appreciate each part of the fish.\n\nThey recently added Black Sesame Panna Cotta on their menu, and it's the best dessert I've had all year. My friend preferred the Green Tea, but I recommend ordering both and having your fill. You won't regret it. \n\nThanks guys. I'm officially addicted, and unfortunately disappointed in most other sushi places across the city. \n\nPS: and if you find out you have a surprise allergic reaction to shrimp after having eaten it for 28 years of your life, don't worry.

The second I walked in, I was kind of regretting because there was no AC in the restaurant... it doesn't really matter but on a 103 degree day in SF- everything matters. Since I already came here, I do want to give this place a try. I went ahead and made the reservation for 5:30 and was seated right when they open. The place was nearly half empty even though it reached 6:30. I think they limited the online reservations because they want to be available to walk-ins also. \n\nFor appetizer, we opted in to order their agedashi tofu and tofu salad as the server told us that it was their first day of serving it 9/1/17! The agedashi tofu $8 was just average/OK nothing special about it but the tofu salad $10 was pretty refreshing. My party and I ordered their omakase of 12 pcs nigiri $75/person. To begin the omakase, we got the crab meat over cucumber salad then the 12 pcs of nigiri with a fried eggplant to snack. We ended the meal with a soup we ordered as to what they called the special soup: red snapper collar soup $7/each bowl.

Before nigiri, which was fast food sushi developed during the industrialization phase of Japan, pressed sushi was it - it's flavorful, generally consists of some sort of seasoning in the rice, and it's condensed and pressed so that the flavor is packed with the fish on top. A typical pressed sushi is mackerel sushi, but this evening on their dinner special they also had a toro pressed sushi.\n\nTheir omakase sashimi is very fresh and incredibly well priced for the neighborhood.

The daily special marinated fish was pretty to eat. \n\nI quite liked the house made tamago, slightly different than the ones you get from the ones that were from pre-made tamago. \n\nWhat I loved about this place is presentation. Everything on the dish is pretty to look at. And the quality of the fish is better than most. \n\nI think about the many sushi places I've been, most of them are just mediocre. The rice to fish ratio is not always good. The quality of fish and the variety of it also not great. This place has your everyday affair sushi and it has also a great selection of daily specials which makes you feel so very special.\n\nHayes Valley's food scene is very competitive, and I've been eating around here sine the late 90s to see some changes. I understand this place has been around for an year and half. I rarely eat at the same place twice, but this place will see quite a bit of me, as long as I can stay put for a while (which fingers crossed will be the case in October!)", "author": "Victoria E."}

Sat at the sushi bar and was greeted by the friendly sushi chefs Peter and John. We all opted for the 12 piece omakase and Chef Peter made sure to get all our allergies, likes, and dislikes before serving. \n\nOmakase Options includes: \n4pc for $20..... 8pc for $44...... 12pc for $68\n\nSTARTERS:\n- Crab over cucumber\n- Octopus over cucumber (for me cause i'm allergic to crab)\n- Octopus with ponzo, tobiko, and lemon\n\nOMAKASE:\n- (forgot) something with Plum\n- Madai Konbujime (red snapper)\n- Tako Ashi (raw japanese Octopus)\n- Kanpachi (amberjack)\n- Muki Hotate (fresh scallop)\n- Hirame (flounder) yumm, love the shiso leaf underneath! thanks Chef Peter\n- Chu-Toro (bluefin tuna) \n- Ika (squid)\n- Another kind of Hotate?\n- Toro Kama (so fatty, melted in your mouth and topped with these three gold flaked balls)\n- Uni and Ikura  (best for last. Uni was sweet and ikura was a burst of flavors)\n\nOTHER DISHES:\n- Nasu Agedashi (Fried eggplant in bonito broth)\n- Fried squid with matcha powder and salt? \n- This fried fish\n- Unagi Tempura from Chef John!! so delicious \n\nHonestly, I've been on a prowl for an affordable AND great quality sushi joint for a while and this place is IT! Lots of other good sushi restaurants in SF offers omakase's for $100+ and for less items, Tsubasa is one place that offers 12 pieces for a whopping $68!! woo hoo! From the fresh and delicious nigiri's to the great attentive service and friendly funny chefs, Tsubasa has really exceeded my expectations in terms of service and food and for such an affordable price. Both chefs are really knowledgeable and talented and they really strive to give customers a memorable dinging experience. Throughout our meal, we were well taken care of. The chefs explained every nigiri they gave us and we even had a few in-between complimentary dishes to help cleanse our palette (ex: eggplant in sweet broth) Everything was simply amazing!

The fish to rice ratio was great, which is to me a big portion of fish and a much smaller portion of seasoned rice. All of the nigiri pieces I had were interesting and tasty and the staff always asked how you liked the fish after so they could adjust the amount of wasabi or anything if you wanted, so nice! \n\nAlso they know the way to my heart, lots of mini courses/palette cleansers in between aka \"free stuff\" so that always makes me happier. \n\nDefinitely give this place a try!", "author": "Crystal C."}

Again, I made reservation here prior to the Opera, expecting the good food and service wife and I came to expect.  However, there was something very different this time. We arrived here at about ten minutes before 5:30 PM, their opening time, and there was actually a line of about ten people waiting for it to open.  When it opened and we were seated, the restaurant was almost full, and people kept coming in.  Much busier than ever before.  We ordered the monk fish with ponzu sauce as appetizer, and as usual, wife ordered the deluxe sashimi ($80) and I ordered the Omakase Sushi 12 pieces ($80) that are served in four separate servings.   The Sashimi and my first 4 pieces of sushi came promptly, but then it took  more than 40 minutes for my second plate of sushi to arrive, which left very little time before the Opera.  I complained and asked all the remaining dishes be served immediately - it took at least another 15 minutes for the two additional dishes to arrive, by which time I lost much appetite.  Wife did enjoy her sashimi, but I felt my sushi was at best mediocre, unlike the absolutely delicious fresh sushi I used to enjoy here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-10", "description": "Came here with a friend to try out their omakase meal. It was my first time ordering omakase as it is quite an expense, and I must say, it was most certainly an amazing experience all throughout!\n\nTsubasa Sushi has a nice modern and clean look to it and very friendly service. They did an excellent job with the pacing of the meal and with explaining what each course included. With that said, let me go through what went down with the omakase meal.\n\nPrologue: The Cubular Joy\n\nThe meal began with a humble cube of tofu, but with a slight twist. It was seasoned with some black sesame for a bit of sweetness to this cold dish. Loved it. 5/5\n\nChapter 1: The Snaptastic 4\n\nSo here we have the first four pieces of nigiri: flounder, char, snapper, and amberjack. The amberjack surprised me with it's surprising burst of flavor despite its light color. The char was also a highlight of these four as it had the skin in tact with some lovely fish oil. Good stuff. 5/5\n\nChapter 2: Chu Chu Chutoro\n\nThe meal moves on with another four piece of nigiri: scallop, chuutoro, flying fish, and mackeral. The scallop came in a nice chunky size and was the best scallop sashimi I've had on this side of the Pacific. The chuutoro was the easy winner here. The fatty tuna deliciousness that it is simply melts in the mouth for a timeless experience...... or so I thought because what came later proved me wrong. Aww yeah. 5/5\n\nBonus Chapter 1: NANI?!?!?! ... ... ... AAAAAAA~~~ SUGOI DESU NE!!!!!!\n\nSo we're pretty much halfway through the meal. If this were a novel, this is that part in the middle where they insert the pictures. Here, it is in color with 4K definition physical pages. The server comes and gives each of us a complimentary small bite of eggplant. It comes in a small bowl with a bit of broth beneath and a few sesame seeds sprinkled on top. At a first glance, it kinda comes off as being soggy and mushy like it has been soaking in a bath of something for too long despite it standing up as a solid entity. Looks are quite deceiving as this piece of eggplant was stupidly good. I legitimately was raving about it after the meal. Something about the flavor of the broth intertwined with the flavor of the tubular vegetable was just so right. Wowsers! 5/5\n\nChapter 3: The True Toro\n\nAnd so the last set of nigiris arrive: wild cherry salmon, barracuda w/ uni, and toro. The wild cherry salmon was quite simply salmon on a whole 'nother level. The toro was quite simply fatty tuna on a whole 'nother level with its crazy melts in the mouth goodness unlike any other. The barracuda w/ uni was quite simply.... actually, I have no idea what a barracuda is or normally tastes like, but this was also super good with the buttery uni going in harmony with the savory fish. Best of the best! 5/5\n\nBonus Chapter 2: Chawhattawhattawhat?\n\nWhen we ordered the omakase meal, we also decided to get an unagi chawanmushi appetizer. It's basically a cup of steamed egg with small pieces of eel mixed it. It was certainly good though difficult to share. The egg came out with a nice smooth and silky texture to make for a delicious cup of goodness though it all really paled in comparison to the omakase meal. Pretty good. 5/5\n\nChapter 4: Explosive Fireworks of Flavors\n\nTo end the meal before the dessert, a bowl filled with uni, ikura, and some greens were placed in front of each of us. Each bit of ikura would burst in the mouth with wonderful fish oil. Each sliver of uni was a buttery indulgence. The greens helped to tame the explosive flavors and went well between each bite. Yeahyuzz! 5/5\n\nEpilogue: Sweet Sweet Plump Plump\n\nThe entire meal ended with a candied tomato per person. It comes in a bowl sitting on top of some sweet liquid. The skin has been pealed off, leaving but a clump of tomato meat. It's a nice bright red to look at and they add a little green thing on top as a decorative piece. It is sweet and sour like a typical tomato but with a higher emphasis on the sweet which really does make it taste like a candy but with an interesting texture. Nice! 5/5", "author": "Joshua M."}

Iwana (artic char)\n3. Madai (red snapper)\n4. Kanpachi (amberjack)\n5. Ma Saba (fresh Mackerel) - standout\n6. Shirauo (wild ice fish) - this one was pretty unique since it was steamed \n7.

There were a few standouts and a few we were 'meh' about (like the houbou which we thought was chewy). We also ordered akamutso (wild blue fish) a la carte at the end which was fuego. \n\nThey have a very extensive selection of fish here, highly recommend if you want to try stuff you can't find at average sushi restaurants!

I just saw that their SF restaurant inspection is low (81) and they were dinged on 6/1/18 for (1) High risk food holding temperature, (2) Foods not protected from contamination, (3) Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities, (4) Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer, (5) Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceiling. That explains why I got sick. Not acceptable, and even less acceptable for a Japanese restaurant serving raw fish where hygiene & quality control should be a top priority (good sushi restaurants usually have a score near 100). Other reviews mention a Chinese owner or sushi chefs. Sub-bar quality compared to Japanese sushi chefs who are meticulous about the fish & process. Too bad because we loved it the first time - but not worth getting sick. Old review: Fantastic sushi and excellent service. I'm extremely picky about sushi and only eat it if it's prepared by a Japanese chef (you know why if you have the same standards). We ordered nigiri from the special chef-recommended list that tells you where it comes from and all were great. Fresh. Great texture & flavor. Perfect seasoning (subtle and didn't need any soy sauce). The highlights: Baby Hamachi was OUTSTANDING. Loved the special miso soup with fish, which had rich flavor with ginger. Spicy tuna roll was good too. The service was great and everyone there so warm. We didn't have any wait to order or for food to arri. Perfect all around.", "author": "Ruth C."}

The pieces there were so bland and really had no flavor IMO. Things included was yellow jack, red snapper,... overall nothing fancy. I didn't enjoy it and felt like I wasted both money and stomach space.\n\nEverything else was tasty. Will describe in order of my preference.\n\nUni: I'm trying to get into uni and this uni didn't have that much \"pungency\". Overall not that large and didn't really stand out IMO.\n\nThe hotate (scallops) was quite interesting. We got the sashimi version and there were 4 pieces. What I noticed were they were a bit firmer than some of my favorite ones. When I bit into it, it felt like there was no give. Maybe I just like mine a tiny bit chewier (those seem more fresh to me).\n\nThe saba aburi was mackereel with some finely grained radish on it. It seem like it was marinated in some sauce and maybe smoked a bit. The combination made for a really good bite.\n\nOburi toro: This was a hamatchi fish and it was interesting to see the fatty version of it. IMO, if you want a fatty fish, just get the fatty tuna. It was tasty no doubt, but when I know what the bar is for the fatty tuna, it just couldn't quite hit that one.\n\nAO Ebi: The deep fried head was really good. I didn't think it was deep fried so much that all you get is crunch, and you can really taste the meat in the head (which I enjoyed). At the same time, the whiskers??? were crunchy so there was a nice balance. The actual shrimp itself I thought could've been a little bit more raw. They cook it a bit I think (3 seconds). I'm used to and prefer when it's more slippery and raw. \n\nTop 2\n\nKing salmon: Just great salmon. It wasn't a fatty cut, but it really did taste a little fatty. It was so soft to bite/chew. Wish I got more of these.\n\nOshizushi Negitoro: wow this was good. It was a layer of fatty tuna (seared at the top, raw at the bottom) on top of a layer of rice. Really enjoyed the combination of seared + raw as well as the radish that's provided for it. Knew the tuna was superrrr fatty and the rice helped to make it easier to go down since it helped balance the fatty part.\n\nAlong the way they gave some free snacks: some crab samples + marinated eggplant + sweeted tomato.\n\nStick to the \"main\" things and not the generic items and you'll be happy here.", "author": "Victor D."}

I love sitting at the bar and watching the chefs work their magic. \n\nWe always have great conversation and learn so much about the various kinds of fish from Wilson. He makes our experience worth 5 stars and the reason why we continue referring our friends and family here.", "author": "Claire W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-10", "description": "This was a little biased rating. I came here with really good company so I feel like I naturally had a good memory associated with this place. \n\nFirst of all, service is SPECTACULAR. I scored a last minute reservation online and when I arrived 15 minutes early, they sat me at the bar (as I had requested) where two seats have been reserved for me and my friend. That was nice that they honored the reservation and didn't make me wait around. Please make reservations... I saw so many people with party of 2 being told they need to wait for over an hour. Service continued to be super great throughout the night. Kept my glass of plum wine full and tea also.\n\nOnto the food. We both got the 12 piece omakase nigiri for $75 each. Hm. I think first off, the sushi rice was very well done. Great flavor, perfectly cooked grains, not too cold or warm, cohesive under the fish and didn't fall apart when I picked it up. The fish are all super fresh, and all of them are given to you with seasoning already, so no need to mix your own soy sauce concoction. However, I think most of the fish was overpowered by ponzu or citrus. A few pieces were dressed with ponzu, so my tongue is hit with lemon aggressively when I first put the fish in my mouth. One was dressed with lime zest, so that was very strong also. I would've rather tasted more of the fish itself. My favorites were the scallop and charred baraccuda with uni on top. Ugh so good! The scallop flesh was firm and definitely not previously frozen or soaked in salt water. They end the meal with a dish that combines uni with marinaded ikura. That was like the masterpiece of the ocean. The marinaded ikura were a tad salty since they didn't have rice to support it, but it was so good. Other fish were not very memorable but still good. I remember my fatty Toro broke into a few pieces when the chef served it to me, that was kind of... Yeah. I also felt like they could've ended the meal with the tamago, but instead they served this skinless plum tomato stewed in syrup. Very interesting... \n\nWe also got the pressed fatty tuna sushi - that was good but I don't think it's worth $19 for 7 pieces. But then again, this place is pretty pricey, so that's actually not very expensive in comparison to other things on the menu. \n\nAt the end of the meal, we were still hungry. Yep.... This is why I docked off a star. If I come in and choose omakase, I expect to be at least not hungry but the end of the meal. They couldve supplemented the meal with something like miso soup or salad in the beginning, or maybe even just more of that eggplant that they served one piece of in the middle of the meal. \n\nWe paid $115 per person including a drink each (including tips). Not bad but ... We had to go to McDonald's afterwards to eat more. But overall, we had a great experience. The sushi chefs explained each piece and I felt very taken care of here.", "author": "Susanna C."}

But felt totally ignored. From the beginning, it took them forever to just get our initial order. When we asked for water, it didn't come until we asked again... We asked for a box and the woman said yes... Only to ask another waiter and he said, \"no take out\". It would've been great if the waiter just told us in the beginning. We were literally confused and irritated the whole time. I wasn't sure if it was a language barrier, but this waiter could have at least talked to someone who did understand to talk to us?? There were about 5 people to working and about 5 tables to serve. We really did not understand the slowness and lack of customer service there at all. How does this place have great reviews??\n\nThe food was decent... I guess. I got the negi toro donburi and a salmon handroll.  The toro was mashed and served over rice with the negi sprinkled on top. It also has the wasabi on the side. My friend ordered the chirashi bowl. She really liked the quality of her fish.

Boyfriend and I got the 12 piece nigiri omakase ($80 each) for ourselves and the ika geso (tempura fried squid legs) to share. All the nigiri pieces were SO good and the variety was very well balanced. The last piece was uni with salmon roe on top of a bed of microgreens and a shiso leaf and h o l y m o l y it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. It was so good, my boyfriend ordered another one for us. The uni was definitely the best way to finish off a great meal...\n\nBut WAIT, there's more! We got the following on the house: 2 pieces of A5 wagyu beef nigiri, 1 uni (they charged for my boyfriend, but not me), 2 oysters on a half shell, extra pieces of toro placed next to the toro nigiri that were part of the omakase, a taster glass of sparkling sake, refreshing candied tomato dessert, AND a medley of black sesame custard, green tea custard, house-made mochi, and red bean paste. I could've sworn the chef who served the toro nigiri put more gold flakes on my piece LOL.\n\nEven without the birthday perks, Tsubasa Sushi effortlessly earned itself a spot on my list of favorite places in SF.

The fish was incredibly fresh, service was on point, and the price was incredibly reasonable. \n\nMy bf and I had a great conversation with Chef Wilson, the owner of Tsubasa, which started funny enough from us not eating something he had sent out. He sent his recommendation - ankimo aka monkfish liver - and both of us had had that before and neither of us had liked it. We decided to give it a bite but sadly it still wasn't working its magic. The server brought it back in and Chef Wilson saw and asked if we didn't enjoy it and actually sent out another item for us to try, which we liked significantly better - I believe it was their homemade seaweed dish, which we loved. It was super refreshing. \n\nMy bf and I also enjoyed the uni and salmon roe dish. It was a perfect medley of textures, flavors and a good play on uni that we hadn't seen at other omakases. We ordered a couple extra sushi rolls, which were delicious too. We will definitely be back to enjoy omakase and see Chef Wilson.

By that time, it was already past 10pm (on a Sunday night) so we politely asked to see if we could cancel the rest of the orders if possible. At this point, I was just slightly disappointed by the slow service, but that was apparently the tip of the iceberg. Once the waiter went back to inform one of the chefs, the chef erupted in anger, yelling in a mix of Japanese & English and slamming a few plates. Naturally, I was startled, so I turned around (my back had been against the sushi bar) to see what the commotion was about - that was when I noticed the chef staring us down while continuing to mutter (unclear what he was saying though). At this point in the night, all of the guests had already left the bar, which means the death glare went on for about 2-3 minutes before the waiter came back with the check while apologizing for what was happening.

(My real rating is probably 4.5/5, but rounded up!)\n\nTsubasa specializes in more traditional sushi; we stuck primarily to sashimi and nigiri, but has some unique takes on their traditional options. If you're looking for super creative, fancy rolls or nigiri options, I would probably go elsewhere like Elephant Sushi or Umami. It's also not the place you bring a big group and do sake bombs. But I would highly recommend Tsubasa for a centrally located traditional sushi dinner that isn't outrageously expensive; other favorites in the same range include Saru Sushi, Eiji, and Kabuto Sushi.\n\nYou can skip the appetizers in the future -- we tried: a maguro (tuna) sunomono salad which is a marinated cucumber salad with seaweed, and a trio which consisted of shirataki (yam) noodles, a combo of tororo (mountain yam paste), tuna, and wasabi, and house cured ikura (salmon roe). Everything was fine, but didn't particularly wow except for that ikura. So ridiculously good! Not sure if they cured it in sake or something else, but the roe was slightly sweet and not briny at all, and burst in our mouths like mini firecrackers. \n\nThe 10-piece sashimi omakase served with its own house-made soy sauce was a great deal. The omakase was served all at once on a plate to our table and  actually ended up being 15 pieces as they provided 3 of each kind of fish instead 2. Everything was fresh, well-cut, and they were thoughtful in the progression from the light-tasting maguro (tuna) and ending with the more pungent aji (mackerel). And I typically am not a huge aji fan, but their version was perfectly cured and not fishy at all. The aji and the iwana (arctic char) were my favorite sashimi items, although all were great.\n\nTheir nigiri was also solid. The vinegar in the rice was slightly stronger than I typically prefer but the grains were just the right amount of stickiness, and each piece of nigiri was perfectly sauced and balanced. Their specialties like the zuwai-gani (snow crab) served with kani miso (crab guts), hotate (scallop), seared ibodai (butterfish), and uni (sea urchin) with ikura. All were incredible. Hotate perhaps was the least creative or interesting of the ones we tried, but still delicious. The seared ibodai nigiri came a dab of their house cured beet root on top, which was the perfect acidic and texture balance to the soft, buttery texture of the fish. And the uni nigiri when consumed with the same amazing ikura from the starter was a party in my mouth.\n\nThroughout the night, service was attentive (but not too much so), and they even provided complimentary appetizer (a green tea tofu if I remember correctly), palate cleanser, and a little dessert (sweet potato). Tsubasa definitely won my heart that night, I would place it high on the sushi considerations for the city.\n\nRead more about the meal on my blog: http://www.vcinthekitchen.com/tsubasa-sushi-sf/", "author": "Vic C."}

I was super excited to try the very reasonably priced omakase ($60) but, after reviewing the menu I decided to piece together my adventure. \n\nI started with some pieces of nigiri: \n\nAji - lightly glazed with soy and a firm fatty fish. Not for beginner sushi eaters. \n\nIkura - might be my favorite nigiri on the planet. I'm a sucker for any kind of fish egg and their house cured salmon roe is stupendous. Also not for beginners. \n\nI'm normally not the kind of person who orders a bunch of rolls but, they looked so appealing that night so I got a couple. The spicy tuna/asparagus roll topped with albacore was super light and naturally had a nice crunch. The highlight of the \"rolls\" was the pressed box nigiri. It's kind of like a roll without any nori (see picture). It was topped with toro and had fresh wasabi you could add to each piece...none of that fake green stuff :) \n\nI'll let the pictures speak for themselves as the fish is really good here and at the perfect price point for San Francisco.

Perhaps they focused on the bar patrons more rather than the tables but for a half filled restaurant that late at night I was a bit baffled why our meal took over 2 hours. We would get two nigiris then had to wait another 30 minutes for the next two nigiris. We remained hungry throughout the meal and couldn't even truly enjoy the food (which was quite tasty). I really didn't understand why they made two nigiris at a time... just make my whole order if it's going to take forever.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-09", "description": "Sitting across the alley from Monsieur Benjamin and taking over for the clubby, decidedly mediocre sushi spot that preceded it (The One), this modestly decorated sushi restaurant was actually working from a deficit position when it opened. I wasn't even thinking about trying it until we noticed that there would be a wait at Little Gem. Impatient locals that we are, Jamie W. and I bee-lined over here thinking we would grab a bit of sushi. Sure enough, there was plenty of space in here for lunch, so we parked our arses at one of the high-top tables near the window.\n\nJamie decided on the $11 California Roll Bento Box, which was simply six pieces of maki, a little tempura, a little salad, and an unnecessary scoop of rice given the aforementioned California Roll (photo: http://bit.ly/1tlXPu4). It was pretty good actually, but mine reflected more of the chef's touch, a $16 Chirashi Donburi Bowl with an eclectic collection of sliced fresh fish, roe, grated daikon, and watermelon radishes over rice that was quite delicious (photo: http://bit.ly/1UGttut). Along with a hearty bowl of miso soup, it made for the ideal lunch. We were impressed enough to come back for dinner about six weeks later. The rest of the neighborhood finally showed up since it was buzzing. Word-of-mouth must have spread.\n\nWhile waiting for Jamie to arrive, I went ahead and ordered the $10 Ankimo because I am a sucker for fresh monkfish liver in ponzu sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1OfO75H). It had such a lush flavor and was very fresh-tasting. Jamie arrived too late to enjoy the ankimo, bu we ordered the $13 Rainbow Roll straight away, and it was hearty with a fresh crab avocado filling and covered with all the requisite fish in a mosaic fashion (photo: http://bit.ly/1UFVsHW). The $7 Mixed Tempura plate came next with a nice blend of shrimp, asparagus and eggplant slices lightly battered accompanied by a light dipping sauce and sea salt (photo: http://bit.ly/1YhmAms).\n\nA couple of more creative rolls followed. First was the familiar and well-executed $10 Spider Roll with deep-fried soft-shell crab, cucumber, and avocado (photo: http://bit.ly/25ONx6C). The second was the idiosyncratic $13 Holy Crab Roll with freshwater eel combined with avocado, topped with crab and drizzled with a spicy & sweet sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1tfKzq8). Delicious with a saucy decadence. We could see how Tsubasa could become our go-to sushi spot, especially since Jamie has turned Japanese since our last trip to Tokyo. It's true. Pretty soon he'll start bowing when we meet up and maybe wear slip-on shoes before he goes through TSA at the airport.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...the sushi really rocks here, not top echelon but good for a quick bite\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...minimal and spacious\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...very attentive like we were important or something\nTOTAL - 4 stars...sushi satisfaction in the heart of Hayes Valley", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-15", "description": "I was super stoked for Tsubasa tonight. It was a special weekend, and I was meeting up with a high school friend for the first time in SF, so we were planning to do some sort of omakase somewhere. My friend organized, and apparently a bunch of those omakase places were pretty fully booked, but she was able to get reservations at Tsubasa, which also offered omakase, and at a more affordable price than some other places I came across when looking up restaurants. We knew we wanted to try some nigiri, but we were super indecisive, and asked the server to recommend some stuff, but of course we had no idea what our preferences were either so he recommended we get the Chef's Omakase. Good recommendation XD We also ordered a couple of appetizers as well.\n\n- Chef's Omakase: we originally got the 8 piece, but upgraded to 12 piece at the end of dinner since we still had room to spare hehe. I've never had omakase before, and my family usually orders the same like 3 things at Japanese places (salmon maki, dynamite roll, and salmon sashimi lol), so I welcome any opportunity to try new things. And boy was the nigiri such a treat! I actually wrote down the names of all the nigiri haha. I really loved how each combination was served with such care with each of the flavours, and how the server directing us to eat in a certain direction kind of made sense. No soy sauce was needed either, since the nigiri was already marinated with special sauce. My friend made the soy sauce mistake, and the server told her soy sauce wasn't eneded haha. My favourite nigiri combination was the following:\n    - Amberjack: citrus notes\n    - Golden eye snapper: kind of the bridge\n    - Butterfish: some hot sauce\n    - It was cool how there was that contrast in the combination. I also liked how there were a few \"bonus\" kind of small dishes that came with the omakase, including an eggplant marinated in a light sauce, not too sweet or strong in any sense, and the eggplant absorbed a lot of the sauce, giving it more flavour.\n    - Our last 4 pieces of omakase came in 2 rounds, with the fatty toro and gold leaf, and barracuda with a little piece of uni on top getting A+ on presentation\n    - The real uni was a great way to end of the omakase, definitely a real treat. I've never actually had uni before! It was very smooth and had a rich but not overbearing flavour. \n    - I also enjoyed the few pieces of nigiri that were slightly torched on top. \n\n- Appetizer trio (I forgot the name): also recommended by our server. It came with 3 items (apologies for the non-official names, I don't remember what they were called haha)\n    - Ankimo: monkfish liver. 5 years ago, I wouldn't touch any kind of liver, dead or alive, with a 10ft stick. But I guess tastes change, and I'm glad I'm more adventurous now. This was an interesting experience and it wasn't bad!\n    - Tuna + white suff: well, the white stuff was super sticky and apparently it's made of yam! It reminded me of spit or something (ok maybe too graphic for dinner time talk XD), and I didn't quite enjoy this, maybe because of the consistency but also it tasted a bit funky. The server recommended to mix some soy sauce with it to lessen the stickiness, but I just avoided the yam and enjoyed the tuna by itself instead haha.\n    - Ikura: I've actually had the big fish roe before! I've had plenty of the little fish eggs that come on sushi, but never ikura or that kind. It was very rich in flavour, and I loved the pop when it exploded in my mouth. Reminded me of the exploding boba hehe.\n\n- Unagi Chawanmushi: I love chawanmushi, and it's not a super common thing at normal Japanese restaurants, so whenever this is offered I jump at the opportunity. The chawanmushi was probably the least stand out of the dishes tonight, as it may have been lacking that bit of something, but it was still good, and a nice piping hot bowl to (almost) end of the night.\n\n- Dessert: green tea ice cream and mochi for the special occasion ;) I'm a sucker for green tea ice cream, and it was great. The mochi was ok, but I'm still glad we got to try it. Definitely a nice way to end such a delicious dinner. \n\nI can't believe all this beautifully presented and delicious nigiri in omakase is what I've been missing in my life! I wouldn't have my first omakase any other way, and I'd definitely recommend Tsubasa, especially for a more affordable omakase meal :)", "author": "Joanna C."}

If you want to good stuff, you have to put out. Well, your wallet does.\n\nI've been to The One Sushi & Lounge once and never again. It was the typical stereotypical Chinesey sushi place - bad fish and even worse service. Last month, The One Sushi & Lounge reincarnated into Tsusaba Sushi, supposedly with new owners. I read that they offer omakase and the pictures looked enticing enough to stop by for lunch. \n\nUpon walking in, I noticed some of the same staff as The One Sushi & Lounge but they now have a Japanese sushi chef. Unfortunately, omakase is not offered during lunch (different lunch and dinner menu). Disappointingly, there's only 4 nigiri options for lunch (sake, hamachi, binnaga maguro, and unagi) but there's lots of maki roll options, if that's your thing - traditional and fusion rolls. They also have bento boxes for about $13. Fish is sourced locally and from Japan. \n\nThe nigiri was the highlight of my lunch. \n\n*Sake (2 pc - $6): http://bit.ly/1RBkjRW\n*Hamachi (2 pc - $7): http://bit.ly/1RBki0o\n*Otoro (2 pc - $13): http://bit.ly/1pK33hj\n\nFor Hayes Valley, the nigiri was solid and a huge improvement over its predecessor. The neta was l-o-n-g and beautifully cut. The sake and hamachi were uber fresh, silky, and buttery. I was having a bad day and felt like splurging so I asked the sushi chef if he had otoro available and he did. Maybe it was the cut but the otoro was firm and didn't have that melt-in-your-mouth quality it should have. This is more of a preference but the shari could have been used more vinegar, salt, and sugar since all nigiri comes seasoned sans wasabi (no need for soy sauce). \n\nAs a filler, I also ordered the Mixed Tempura: Shrimp w/ rice cracker, eryngi mushroom, zucchini, asparagus ($7): http://bit.ly/1RzDEwK. Unless you like hard, greasy batter, I would skip this. The shrimp was definitely frozen as it was wet in the center. \n\nI made the mistake of ordering a maki roll from their fusion section instead of the traditional section (there's another sushi chef in charge of making the rolls). I appreciated that they were light on the rice for the Juicy Scallop Roll ($13): http://bit.ly/1o8TNkY but the roll was no bueno. The scallops had a slight slimy texture and the sour miso sauce looked like man chowdah. The sweet and sourness of the sauce was overwhelming and was a funky pairing for raw seafood. \n\nThe female server was really polite and attentive. I was one of two diners during a late lunch so I enjoyed the peacefulness. \n\nI know having their entire omakase selection available for lunch is impossible but I would love to see more nigiri options during lunch. Granted, an all nigiri lunch will be $$$$ so it's a good thing I have an office stash of $1 Nongshim ramen bowls from Walgreens!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-08", "description": "Came here on a Sunday night and decided to order the omakase, because WHY NOT? It was around 8pm and  quiet - you probably don't need to make reservations later in the evening, though we did. \n\nThere are several different omakase options - we went for the more expensive, 15-piece ($75) nigiri omakase and it was SO worth it. We also ordered the appetizer sampler trio, which was unnecessary in the end because we were way too full. We sat at the bar for a more intimate experience (you can watch the chef lovingly make eace piece, which sometimes involves paintbrushes, blowtorches, and gold leaf!).\n\nSome favorites from the night:\n- Wagyu nigiri. OH MY GOD. This is the A5 stuff, aka the best wagyu beef out there - google it and it looks like lace from the marbling. Melted in our mouths. If nothing else, this makes it worth it to get the 15-piece omakase because I'm not sure it is included in the 12-piece one.\n- Mugi hotate (scallop) nigiri with yuzu-infused flying fish roe. Tsubasa's head chef, Peter, has designed this absurdly delicious citrusy yuzu sauce that made an appearance in several pieces. It is unlike any flavor I've had with nigiri, and really brings out the brightness of clean, fresh fish.\n- Chu-toro (fatty tuna belly) nigiri. While not as melt-in-your-mouth rich as toro, the chi-toro was flavorful, fresh, and almost creamy in texture. And let's be honest, the gold leaf makes you feel #fancy.\n- The additions (not included in the 15 pieces): Oysters, miso soup with fish filets, dash-soaked eggplant (looks odd but is a flavor-bomb of dash goodness), and candied tomatoes for dessert. All filling, hearty, and yummy!\n\nFood: 5/5 - Absurdly good food, decadent flavors, and so much variety. Plus the attention to detail was unparalleled - the delicate yes sauces, the house-made soy sauce blends - every detail was on point, the way you'd expect in a much more expensive restaurant.\n\nDrinks: 4/5 - We had the (FILL IN) sake, which was delicious, but pricey. Pro tip - offer some sake to your sushi chef! It is traditional, and always appreciated :)\n\nService: 5/5 - our server John was friendly, knowledgeable, and fun without seeming like he was trying to hard. The banter between the chefs was hilarious - you can tell these guys are friends in addition to coworkers. The chefs and hosts are really authentic and approachable while still being professional. John gave detailed descriptions of all the food that we had, and answered all of our questions in detail. As major food nerds, this made for an incredible experience. Food came out quickly but not in a way that made us feel rushed.\n\nValue: 4/5 - at $75 for 15 incredible pieces (some of which - like the wagyu - ran over $10/piece a la carte), this was an incredible deal. Throw various small bites on top of that, and you have yourself an incredibly filling, decadent meal at an unheard of price - especially in SF! Of course, with tip the bill still came to ~275 for two people, so this isn't exactly a cheap place. Would recommend for a fancy date night\n\nAmbience: 3/5 - I wouldn't say the ambience was particularly memorable. The food is the focus here.", "author": "L H."}

It was a bit a rice but the rice was seasoned and had sesame seeds - it was just delicious! I could eat just the rice alone!\n\nGreen tea ice cream with homemade mochi - can't leave without dessert. Words cannot describe! You could definitely tell it's green tea ice cream and their homemade mochi was so soft and chewy. A bit bland but that's how mochi is. Mix it with eh green tea ice cream and it's a great combo!\n\nThey gave us candied tomatoes at the very end of the meal. It was interesting but I probably wouldn't eat it again haha. It was not bad nor good but it is something you should try once in your life.\n\nI will definitely came back here. I love the food and service.

At sushi restaurants, I tend to gravitate toward the omakase while the wife prefers a couple of rolls with a side of uni if available & the diverse options by Tsubasa suited our preferences well. I had a wonderful 8 piece nigiri omakasa which included mackerel, flounder, fatty tuna, perch, a huge piece of scallop, and arctic char. The S.T.A.S.H. roll was very impressive with large pieces of seared yellowtail and seared just enough without overdoing it. Inside the S.T.A.S.H. roll were asparagus and spicy tuna which made a really interesting mix of flavors in this roll.  I think I would come back and just order like two or three S.T.A.S.H. rolls. The Futomaki roll was good but just a step below the S.T.A.S.H. roll and had more of a vegetarian flair with the egg, mushroom, pickled radish, asparagus, and wrapped in Japanese kelp. Eel was also in the roll as well.  The uni was a solid 8 out of 10.\n\nThroughout the meal, waiters brought out other complimentary items including a pumpkin tofu,  fried eggplant in a sweet broth, and yam cake for dessert. The yam cake came soaked in a sweet syrup and was just amazing. The pumpkin tofu was very creative, likely a seasonal item, and very light in flavor in that you couldn't really taste the pumpkin that much but it was a great way to start off the dinner. Our server indicated before the holidays started, they had offered an edamame tofu. Tsubasa Sushi just took honors for our favorite sushi restaurant in the Bay Area and we'll certainly find ourselves coming back here again hopefully in the near future. You can't seem to go wrong if you get only the omakase or a bunch of rolls accompanied with cold/hot appetizers.", "author": "Albie F."}

I wouldn't travel across the city for it but if you're looking for a nigiri evening without four dollar signs this is a good option. Our order:\n\nToro Nigiri -\u00a0I felt that this was actually a chu toro cut. It was reasonably-ish priced, but for $7 a piece I want otoro, not chu toro. It was good enough, not best ever.\n\nMiso Soup - Kind of watery, will skip next time.\n\nJuicy Scallop Roll - This was the best sushi entree and I wish we ordered two. It's really balanced and fresh. I think it can be difficult to take a minimalist approach to a sushi roll and make it sing and they have done that here.\n\nMixed Tempura -\u00a0delicious. It was basically all asparagus, porcini mushroom, and 1 shrimp rolled in Japanese crackers.\n\nKing Salmon Nigiri - I thought this was kind of fishy. I feel like maybe they cured or smoked or \nboth (or otherwise dehydrated) the fish because the texture was lox-y but it wasn't blowing my mind. A friend we ate with thought it was incredible but next time I'd pass.\n\nS.T.A.S.H. Roll - Would pass on this. Each element was good but not together. The roll is covered with torched yellowtail and they overdid the searing to the point that it was overcooked. The spicy tuna roll underneath with asparagus felt out of place and I'm not sure the asparagus did the spicy tuna any favors. All in all a very lackluster preparation to which I would definitely say PASS.\n\nOshizushi (boxed sushi) -\u00a0I thought this was pretty good and would gladly order again. Bluefin tuna on quality rice lightly torched, what can go wrong?\n\n--\n\nOur total for dinner for a party of 3 (including drinks) came to $125 pre-tip, which was super reasonable for what it was. Don't know if anyone on Yelp gives a shit but none of the waiters I experienced spoke Japanese, however I'm sure it's Japanese owned with a name like Tsubasa.", "author": "Ryan J."}

However, I thought this was far too much fish for my taste and made the whole meal seem monotonous.\n\nThe sushi portion of the omakase came with four pieces of sushi at once instead of the traditional piece by piece style.

From the hostess, to the servers, to the sushi chefs at the bar they are all very engaging and pleasant. \n\nTo the comments from others who will not come back because they have seen the chefs not wash their hands, I would ask them so what happens to the restaurants they go to and their kitchen is not visible? Or the other comment about their sushi chef not being interactive, did you ever ask yourself that maybe it was you who wasn't asking engaging questions, being personable were it would allow the sushi chef to open up in conversation.", "author": "Danielle L."}

My other favorites are Saru Sushi (comparable prices but lengthier waits), and I've had good nigiri at Pink Zebra and Maruya, but at much steeper prices.\n\nIf you come here, make sure you order the nigiri. We ordered the 12 piece sampler of nigiri ($54) and the scallop roll, and it was enough food. The nigiri was all omakase, so chef's choice, and there were so many different types of textures, varieties of fish that I hadn't had before - not just your typical salmon, tuna, and hamachi), and prepared perfectly. The proportion of rice to fish was excellent (small pieces of rice with a large cut of fish), and different fish had different sauces brushed on them. Similar to how they prepare nigiri in Japan, some of the fish were charred or lightly seared, some had a particular sauce or topping that balanced each variety of fish perfectly, and none were eaten with wasabi or soy sauce. This is the way nigiri should be.\n\nThe scallop roll was also really good, with a miso sauce on top, but the standouts for me were the nigiri. We came late on a Friday night, so there was no wait, and I'm looking forward to making this my regular sushi place in San Francisco any time I want good nigiri. They seem to rotate the fish on a daily basis, depending on what's fresh. At around $40-50 per person, this is a pretty reasonable price for quality sushi, nigiri and sashimi.", "author": "Christina L."}

We were forced to change plans when we found that Brenda's only serves breakfast for dinner on Sundays.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Chardonnay, the mixed tempura, miso soups, seaweed salad, a S.T.A.S.H. roll, a T.A.P.S. roll and Tekka Maki. The mixed tempura was very unique, serving up corn, asparagus, and shrimp, rather than your standard green bean, onion ring, and potato. The seaweed salad was your standard prepackaged salad that every sushi restaurant serves (love it). The miso was pretty average, but all of the rolls were well rolled using high quality ingredients. The seared yellowtail on the S.T.A.S.H. roll paired well with the spicy tuna and the tempura gave a delightful crunch to the T.A.P.S. roll.\n\nI generally order the same thing at every sushi restaurant (bento/dinner combination with tempura, sashimi, and sushi) and Tsubasa's small menu made me dance outside of this zone, but it's always a great sign when a restaurant limits its menu to things it does well.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and smelled of the ocean.

Taste experts will be able to differentiate slight imperfections in the fish served. Their 8-piece omakase was priced at $50 even - expensive from an outsider's perspective but understandable and maybe even reasonable within the SF fine dining spectrum. Some notable pieces were the semi-raw sweet shrimp, which had a slight lemon dressing, and the summer flounder which was topped well. Both had perfect texture and tasted superb. The Canada salmon reminded me very much of smoked salmon with a hint of more \"sushi salmon\" flavor embedded. It was a refreshing touch to be eaten with rice. The uni, supposedly from Japan, was very mediocre - nothing special, and the aftertaste was not like other sea urchin I have eaten from Hokkaido (where most Japanese uni is received from in the United States). I was disappointed in their uni. On the contrary, the ikura (salmon eggs) was marinated very well and had no fishy aftertaste. The bluefin (maguro) chutoro was not cut well and showed Tsubasa's lackluster attention to detail when estimating taste from appearance. Tasted good, but not impressive. Service at this restauarant was excellent, although it took about 30 minutes to receive my second half of omakase (4 pieces) from the time I received the first half.

Good enough that I feel conflicted about writing a review on yelp, fearing that i will never be able to get a seat myself anymore.  \n\nSimply put, the fish is top quality, the rice is perfectly cooked, and the seasonings are on point.  And for the $60, 12-piece omakase, they served uni and giant clam (!), 2 of my favorites that usually never come as part of the prefix.  That is very, very generous.\n\nAs I foresee this place taking off like Saru and the likes in SF, I will treasure my time to be able to still drop in without a reservation, for as long as I can.", "author": "Jiajia C."}

They definitely still have some kinks to work out in the kitchen and with the service. I had the 8 piece nigiri omakase. It comes out 4 at a time, unlike the piece by piece omakase at all the high end omakase spots in San Francisco. The quality of the fish was great, but the fish was sliced too thinly, making the placement awkward on the rice. I also tried the futomaki, which uses a soy wrapper instead of the traditional seaweed wrapper. I thought the flavors were great, and I loved the addition of the unagi in there. I wasn't entirely opposed to the dining experience and would definitely give Tsubasa another chance in the future, once they've worked out some of their issues.", "author": "Ashley T."}

I was a bit disappointed by the quality of their fish and just overall taste and experience of the meal :( my boyfriend and I ordered the chef's choice sashimi for $40 with a side of sushi rice, battera roll, hamachi nigiri, one of their special chefs choice appetizer (shoyu ikura, Maguro, and monkfish liver), and spicy albacore hand roll. The chefs choice sashimi was the most disappointing.. Because the sashimi didn't taste as buttery (a bit chewy) and did not have any taste to it (very bland and no dimension- would have tasted better if it was brushed with ponzu). The sushi rice on the side was dry. The battera roll which included Saba and pickled kelp was very very salty, Though I liked the concept of pickling kelp..the mackerel also had some bones left in it. The chefs appetizer was placed so beautifully..However, lacked taste. Because we did not feel satisfied from the meal, we decided to order a hamachi nigiri which took them 25 more minutes to serve to us. The only thing I absolutely enjoyed was the spicy albacore hand roll- probably one of the best I've ever tried. They season the spicy albacore mix with grilled onion which gives it the tangy, savory taste. Other positive notes were the edamame tofu they give you on the house before the meal, and the house sweet potato dessert they give you at the end. \n\nAll in all, I think this restaurant is very ambitious, knows how to set up a great ambiance, and aims to serve beautiful looking food- but the food tastes lack luster :( I left the restaurant not feeling full or satisfied, and like I had wasted my money. I would come back and give this restaurant a second chance- I'd probably try the nigiri mix and the spicy albacore roll :)", "author": "Tracey K."}

He started off with nice, clean, and light flavor white fishes then progress to more creamy and fattier flavor fishes. In between we were offered a very refreshing pallet cleanser of a cold and crisp Daishi broth eggplant. Nicely done. After a few more pieces of Nigiris, the chawanmushi came out. Which was a very nice intermission. We ended the omakase with a miso soup to wash it all down. Following with light dessert of a Japanese yam. Green tea ice cream with crunchy rice poppers and Mochi came last. Over all the staff was extremely nice. We had a great time chatting with Wilson. Every piece of nigiri was the right temperature and Texture with nicely added touches of sauce, garnishes or torching by the chef.

We had spent a long day sightseeing and stopped in here based on glowing reviews and proximity to our hotel. We had been craving sushi for much of the trip and, despite noting that the nigiri menu was plentiful and included many unusual selections, we opted for rolls anyway to satisfy our persistent cravings. They were fine - nothing I would travel any particular distance for, but disappointing after much anticipation. The service also wasn't particularly attentive - we sat for 10 minutes before anyone even came to our table. Not a good look on a restaurant with 10 tables total. All in all, pricing was very reasonable and the meal was good. I'd like to re-visit and try some of the chef's recommendations, but given I was travelling it's unlikely I'll get the chance to come back. Look to other reviews on here for suggestions on what's great here - they've got to be doing something right with all those great reviews!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

This was easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.\n\nI met a friend for sushi, we both live in Hayes Valley and since this place had 4.5 stars we wanted to check it out.  \n\nI am now guessing the 4.5 stars and 24 reviews = 24 reviews from friends/family\n\nThe service was horrendous:\n\nPart 1: Drinks\nI ordered a glass of Merlot, my friend ordered sake.  The waiter came back and told me the Merlot was out of stock, but that he had something very similar that was a cab/merlot blend.  I said that was fine.  He comes back and gives me and very light pinot noir, which is nothing like a cabernet/merlot, other than the fact that both are red wines.  Not the end of the world, but annoying when you were expecting something much darker.  My friend had to ask for her sake 2x before they actually brought it to our table.  When she wanted a refill, they charged her for 3 orders, instead of the 2 she actually ordered/received. \n\nPart 2: Food Order\nWe ordered miso soup, seaweed salad and some sashimi to start.  The waiter brought out our salad to share, but no plates.  When we asked for some plates, he said they would come out later.  We were very confused, and decide to just pick at the salad, sans plates.  We also never received the miso soup, and when we asked, the waiter said they would be coming out later.  Isn't miso soup meant to come out first???  While we were waiting for our sashimi, we ordered a roll as well.  \n\nThe sashimi was good, and the ONLY highlight of the meal, it was fresh and came out as ordered.  After we finished the sashimi, we sat there for another 20 minutes, until the waiter finally came over.  Instead of arriving with the roll we had ordered, he asked if he could start taking away plates.  We reminded him that we were waiting for our roll and STILL waiting for our miso soup.  He said \"oh, yeah, okay, I forgot about the roll\" and walked off to put in the order.  He quickly returned to our table, and said \"I completely forgot what you ordered, can you tell me what you wanted again?\" \n\nWhen I looked around at other tables, it was obvious that everyone was having a similar experience - incorrect orders, forgotten drinks, lack of plates/utensils.  \n\nI will be surprised if this place lasts, I hope a better place takes over this spot.  They should consider hiring a competent wait staff to start.  I will not be back.  Incredibly disappointing and a complete waste of money.", "author": "Sichia B."}

Chef Wilson Chang, who worked his way up from busboy in various restaurants, and trained with a Japanese Kaiseki master, eschews the lamentable trend in froo-froo rolls, concentrating on exquisite presentations of ultra-fresh, rare and unusual fish: multiple varieties of toro, baby squid, baby eel, baby hamachi, even barracuda. Each is presented with its own unique matched marinade, subtly bringing out the unique flavors of each fish. Soy sauce and wasabi are \"verboten\", and utterly unnecessary. \n\nTry the gorgeous Goldeneye Salmon, or the King Salmon, delicately blowtorched for just a few seconds for a hint of that grilled taste, layered on top of the intense salmon flavors. Finish the meal with macha or black sesame ice cream with house-made mochi dough (fresh daily) and crisp rice sprinkles. Sit at the sushi bar and go on a weekday, not Friday or Saturday: Chef Chang likes to take his time and not rush. Oh - and if you have a friend who likes froo-froo maki, they are available.

Apparently their food was decent but the service also sucked.  We ask for a recommendation and go to another place down the street which was packed but had fantastic service.\nThis joint reminds me of the pretentious clubs that while empty on the inside like to create a huge line outside so everyone would think how exclusive they are.\nHere is a clue on hospitality.  If you have open tables - sit your guests, it would make them comfortable, instead of standing in high heels.  Give them menus, this will take their minds off waiting and help save the server time when he gets there to take their order.

The staff is also very attentive and friendly.  Oh, and they actually make their own tamago which is absolutely out of this world.  If that alone is representative of their kitchen, it truly is outstanding.  One of the best and highly recommended.", "author": "LMarie G."}

Excuse where is the food. 5 tiny pieces of flavorless nigiri I was told came pre flavored with no need for soy or wasabi arrived for $18.00. Give me a break. What I dislike is the presumptive idea that tiny plates are always worth it. Sometimes it is but not here. I had to go get some food after eating here. Something with flavor. Don't waste your money. I know never again for me.", "author": "Hackey S."}

But we just went in the other day and it looks the same, which is nice, clean and open. The staff seems the same, very nice especially the young lady with the ponytail who is always there, so very friendly. BUT the lunch options have changed...they don't offer as many options  for lunch now. They don't have any lunch appetizers and when I checked the dinner menu, no Tempura appetizer offered. The miso no longer has tofu. My bento box seemed smaller and they don't carry the saba with ponzu sauce anymore and my co-workers teriyaki salmon came with the teriyaki sauce on the side instead of cooked on the fish.... My co-workers and I were very disappointed because it seemed that the place looked the same and the staff was the same...but they trimmed down the food costs to make more money....sad because it was a great lunch option.", "author": "Jessica M."}
