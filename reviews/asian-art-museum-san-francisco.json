Jenn Silagi in the Groups Department was very responsive and accommodating. We had 33 people and rented a room to host our celebration and two docent-led tours. Everybody at the museum was beyond professional and welcoming. The one thing I'd note is that we were in the Education Room that is usually used for arts activities and classes. The tables were pretty marked with old paint and ink. Because we were serving food, I had to run out and buy some tablecloths to mask the marks. Just something to keep in mind if you're planning a gathering with food. It'd be totally perfect for an arts-based activity. \n\nAlso, we had catering from Sunday in the Museum. Janet Lee and her team were awesome. They were able to accommodate last minute adds to our order and were all around helpful and supportive. We had a mixed platter of pastries from Craftsman and Wolves and assorted teas. \n\nWe had a great time and will definitely be back!", "author": "Peggy L."}

My girlfriend and I were members since last year, and we're only cancelling it since we're going to be moving soon.\n\nThere are two floors of permanent exhibitions, with art and sculptures from several Asian and Middle Eastern countries, such as China, Japan, Korea, Myanmar, Iran, Iraq, and many more. As an Iranian American, I really appreciate the room of Iranian art and artifacts. They also have special exhibitions that rotate every few months, which do an excellent job of relating ancient art to modern culture. \n\nThe member benefits are totally worth it! You get free admission for you and a guest, and access to a ton of free social events and tours. It's sometimes hard to keep track of everything that's going on, and you have to reserve in advance, but the events we got to go to were extremely high quality. The tour guides are extremely knowledgeable, and often they design the tours themselves. \n\nThe Cafe is also awesome! A little pricey, but it's great food, and the only place to get Boba Guys without waiting in line. \n\nOverall this museum is great!

When we took the escalator to the third floor I took a good 10 minutes admiring the sculpture and wishing they had a smaller version of it at the museum shop. \nWhen you get a chance, check out the gift shop.  They have cute little kitschy things.

For instance, there were different colors of balloons (red for anger, yellow for happiness, etc), and within each color, there were subcategories that go within the main broader emotion, which you write the word on the balloon. Then you get a white piece of paper and write what triggers that emotion, and on the back, a way to deal with that.

There aren't many museums in the US dedicated to solely the arts of Asia, so it's great to know that a city as multicultural and diverse as San Francisco has a museum dedicated to this part of the world. Coming to the Asian Art Museum gives me a great sense of pride and understanding of my Asian roots.\n\nLocated in the Civic Center area of SF, the Asian Art Museum is easy to get to via public transit (eg Bart and Muni). Long ago, the Asian Art Museum used to be located in Golden Gate Park but moved to its current location in 2003. The Asian Art Museum houses relics from all across Asia-from China, Korea, Japan, all the way south to Indonesia, and all the way west to Iran, Pakistan and India. Asia is very large and diverse, and the collection of art here reflects that diversity. \n\nOf note, the Asian Art Museum has recently expanded its collection of arts from the Philippines. There has been past remarks brought to the attention of the museum about why the Filipino art section was so small/limited. So it's great to see that the museum listened to its patrons, and expanded its Filipino art collection. I was able to see the growing Filipino arts section at the museum during my recent visit a few weeks ago -- it included various textiles and woven wear, which were pretty neat!\n\nThe museum entrance fee is $20 for adults. However, admission is free on the first Sunday of every month (except for special exhibits which there is a small surcharge, if you want.

I have visited on a few occasions on those first free Sundays of each month. Then a friend of mine who is a member of this museum has invited me as a guest to visit. I even bookmarked the museum to prepare a review when they had the terracotta warriors exhibition. It was never done. \n\nThus, I am here at this museum for the Flower Power exhibition, which is currently occurring until October 1, 2017. My review is long overdue, in that one should have been written about seven years ago when I started writing reviews on yelp. Okay, it's better late than never to finally say what I think about this museum and what it has on display.\n\nThere were 33 of us from Mastick Senior Center. We were divided into three groups for the docent tour of the special exhibit. Each of us was given an audio head set to listen to the docent. The docent leading my group did a superb job in the narration of the Flower Power exhibit and answering our questions. She was informative and I appreciated her presentation. I found myself taking notes of what was being said; thus, allowing me to do a somewhat detailed review. \n\nThe Flower Power exhibition is in celebration of the flower power movement of 1967. Wow...that is 50 years ago. The movement had its start in Berkeley. Definitely it was the Summer of Love. Make love, not war. Where was I at that time? (Graduated from jr. high school and waiting to start high school as a sophomore.) In my mind, the late Scott MacKenzie is singing San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair), a song that was very popular at that time. RIP Scott. \n\nMoving forward to this special exhibit, which I enjoyed immensely, has left me with the a deeper appreciation and understanding of what the flowers symbolize, especially in the Asian cultures (Buddhism, Hinduism, Persian, Indian). \n\nThe six flowers mentioned by the docent were lotus (pure love), cherry blossom, chrysanthemum (longevity), roses in the Persian and Indian cultures symbolize beauty, elegance, refinement, perfection; plum blossom along with bamboo and pine symbolize integrity, persistency, perseverance under adversity; and tulips. Also, in Hinduism, the Shiva and the pair of elephants on lotus thrones symbolize fertility, creation, wealth and prosperity.\n\nOne of the gold colored panels on displays had other flowers illustrated - hibiscus (fragile beauty), blue hydrangea (wanderer), lotus, chrysanthemum, red hollyhocks (peace) and lily (purity).\n\nThe twelve monthly flowers that were displayed are as follows: plum blossom, peach blossom, magnolia, peony, pink lily, lotus, opium poppy, hibiscus, canna, yellow hibiscus, chrysanthemum; wax plum, nandina and luchan pine.\n\nAccording to the docent, some of the artifacts were contributed by the late Avery Brundage of IOC fame. These artifacts are located on the second and third levels of the museum.\n\nFinally, when visiting the museum, I recommend stopping in at their gift shop and the cafe. The gift shop has a large variety of books, scarves, greeting cards, post cards, gourmet food items, etc. The cafe has the usual pastries and baked goods, beverages, salad and entree of Asian influence. \n\nThe annual basic membership is $89. Membership has its benefits - unlimited visits to the museum, one guest is allowed, 10% discount in the gift shop.", "author": "Carol C."}

It's always a nice time to slowly take your time and see what's new with each visit; however, the Asian Art Museum definitely gives a different experience than I would get at something like the MoMA.\n\nIn my experience, many museums do have their own permanent collection and rotating borrowed collections; however, the bulk of the Asian Art Museum is their permanent collection of Eastern and some South/Southeast Asian art that is rarely altered. Many times, the special exhibitions are where the real party is at, so it's much more worth it to go the extra mile and pay for that.\n\nI love the Asian Art Museum for what they have to offer on free days, family weekends, and events through the year. The activities they have to offer are intriguing, build a better knowledge for the community about Asian arts, and inviting to convince goers to come back and see more on the next visit.\n\nIf there's one thing they need to change as a museum, it would have to be the very stark contrast of Eastern arts in collection versus South and Southeast Asian arts in collection. The Eastern Asian arts seem like they're dominantly in display and always at the center, while the South and Southeast Asian arts seem like they're not being actively sought after as much as, let's say, Korea, China, and Japan.

The collection of Chinese, Japanese, and Indian art is comprehensive and well-presented, without being unnecessarily cluttered with innumerable artifacts, as is often the case at other museums that seem to be intent on showing off everything they have as opposed presenting the cultural heritage of a people.\n\nThere are two primary reasons why I'm not giving this place 5 stars.  First, while there is an impressive array of ancient art, there is hardly any contemporary art.  Asian art is more than just 400 year old ceramics and silk paintings, more than 1000 year old carvings of Buddhist deities.  There were a handful of modern Japanese ceramics that were a beautiful blend of traditional styles and 21st century influences; more displays such as this would be welcomed.\n\nSecond, whereas there are certain cultures that are well-represented here, there are that are sadly underrepresented.  There is currently a special exhibit of Filipino art, but this amounts to just two small rooms of a handful of textiles and other small objects.  To their credit, the curators of the museum acknowledge that their Filipino collection is embarrassingly small, especially given the very large Filipino population in the Bay Area, and they have been working to rectify that.  Along the same lines, the Persian art is housed in a single small room; it would be great if this important culture were better represented in this otherwise fantastic museum.", "author": "Lee L."}

Also, I'm huge into Asian history, so it made no sense for me to not visit. \n\nThe good news is that with student ID, so you get a few dollars off the entrance fee, which helps a lot. The size of this place is decent. It's three floors and they all offer something very unique. It's pretty easy to know where you are going and staff is everywhere to help you out. It was quite fascinating to see pieces from Japan, China, Korea, India, etc that were sometimes over a 100 years old. \n\nWhile having many pieces that are quite old, this place feels very modern, but it is SF. They are not going slouch. Overall, it was a great experience and hope to come again in the future.", "author": "Benny H."}

For example, in the South Bay/Silicon Valley area, you have places like the Tech museum and the Pace Gallery. Heck, even Intel has its own little space for the public. In the East Bay, you have places such as the Oakland Museum of California. \n\nAnd in San Francisco, you have more museums than you can count on your fingers. Asian Art Museum is definitely one that I recommend you all check out. \n\nRecently, my girlfriend and I had this ambitious plan (well technically I dragged her along with me, but you know) of visiting 3 different museums around the Bay in one day. The second on our list was the Asian Art Museum. The really cool thing (that makes the Bay Area EVEN BETTER) about this museum and several others around is that it's free during certain days of the year. For example, it's ALWAYS free every first Sunday of the month. That's like 52 days of annually! Even if you don't come during a free day, it's only $15 for general admission (similar to other museums like de Young and Legion of Honor). \n\nContrary to what you might think, the Asian Art Museum is located on Larkin Street near the Civic Center (I always thought it'd be in the city's Asian neighborhoods such as the Sunset or Chinatown). This location is SUPER accessible for city dwellers, specifically people who take public transit, because the museum is right next to Civic Station Bart + other bus stations. Driving may be a bit of a pain since parking can be limited. However, on weekends after 6pm it should be free! I would just be careful and make sure you lock your car and take all your belongings with you...\n\nFrom the outside, it may seem like the Asian Art Museum is pretty small (and maybe not worth your time), but the interesting thing that we noticed right away when we walked in was that this place really knows how to pack a whole bunch of stuff in a tight space; there's at least 3-4 different floors within the museum, and each one has a TON of exhibits to explore. During our time here, we saw things from Buddha statues to incredible art on the walls. My personal favorite, and one that really capped off an amazing day, was the station towards the entrance that had FREE flowers. Basically, there was a special exhibit going around called \"Flower Power,\" basically a way to show the public the magic of nature. Next to the exhibit was a bed of flowers people could just take and give to strangers to brighten up the day. My girlfriend and I both took one, and we had THOUHT that they werent really but THEY WERE. It was such a nice thing that the museum was doing that really made me appreciate this place further. They really have a lot of cool opportunities for visitors to engage with the community. \n\nOverall, I'm glad we took the chance to explore the Asian Art Museum. If we actually came on a day where we'd have to pay, we'd definitely still go. The only real downside about this museum is that given the space (and even though they pack a lot), you can definitely get through the entire place in around an hour. Still, I think the Asian Art Museum of SF is worthy of an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this.\"\n\nHave fun and prosper!", "author": "Bryan W."}

This museum goes a long way to blow up the irrelevance and leads you through the many strands of what we westerners call \"Asian\" but what really makes up a vast number of cultures and regions.  They start you off making sure you understand that there is so much diversity, I was so intent on getting each branch that time flew by so fast and I had to leave before I even finished one floor, frustrating but wonderful!

My company holds Asian diversity events yearly and they always provide flyers and promotions for AAM - they have special exhibits that change and is a short walk from Civic Center BART.  So really no excuses not to go at least once!\n\nOVERALL\nVery nice museum!  Small enough (3 floors) so you can see most of the exhibit from one visit.  Clean restrooms on every floor, excellent cafe (I'll review separately), nifty museum store, free WiFi, and free rental of their virtual museum audio guides (which we did not use, arg!).  All that and the museum was super clean and modern.  Definitely pay extra for the special exhibit ($25/pp for Saturday).\n\nSPECIAL EXHIBIT\nUntil mid September 2016, the special exhibit are some artifacts dating back to the last few emperors of China (Qing, Ming, Yuan, Song).  Four exhibit rooms showing cool pottery, paintings, and bios of the various emperors and what they did to develop the art movement in China back in the day.  Many of the exhibits were from the National Museum of Taiwan.  The most famous was in the last room dedicated to Empress Dowager Cixi - the pork belly rock!  Note photography isn't allowed for the special exhibit - they have fine print on all the entrance areas.\n\nPERMANENT COLLECTIONS\nThe second and third floors house their permanent collections and photography is allowed.

An empty and mostly boring place to wander around looking at \"the stuff\".  I could \"do\" the whole place in about 30 minutes.\n\nFast-forward 30 years - Holy Cow!  You can spend 4 hours and not adequately see all of the treasures - and it is not at all boring!\n\nWe wanted to see the National Palace Museum pieces from Taiwan.  I went to Taiwan to see their stuff  in the 80's.  It was impressive!  The Nationalist Chinese grabbed all the good stuff in China before they left the place to Mao and his buddies.  Back in Taiwan, they dug a big cave into a mountain and stored all the loot there - and then would regularly truck out a bunch of stuff to display at the National Palace Museum.  It made the stuff displayed in the De Young exhibit look like bric-a-brac from Chinatown... so I never wanted to see the Asian Art Museum again... until the recent exhibit of the National Palace Museum stuff came into town.  I was not disappointed!   The portraits of the emperors, the emperors seal and that rock fashioned into an incredibly delicious looking piece of roast pork - it was all terrific.  If you have the opportunity to see this exhibit, don't miss it.\n\nThe rest of of the stuff?  Two more levels of objects from \"Asia\" an the second and third floors - includes India, Japan, Korea and other places in the general area.  It was nice to see Asian people bringing their children to view the treasures of their heritage.  \"See?

Group discount as well. \n\nWe really enjoyed the Flower Power exhibit. The Docent was lovely and very knowledgeable- it's a free tour. Do it! It was mostly our group and it felt very personal. \n\nSpecial Thanks to Darlene, manager of the Cafe Asia.  She was very accommodating with arranging a special area for us to sit.  Darlene was SO patient and calm and we were all happy with our experience. Our food came out really quickly- and Not to mention it was delicious. I ordered the Vietnamese silver noodle dish: yummy! Clear noodles with ground pork, cucumbers and lime with some kind of lettuce to wrap it in. The tea was good and served in a cute little teapot. Overall great choices to choose from if you're looking for some Asian flavors and nice ambience and great customer service. \n\nI came with a large group of about 20. - Not many places these days will go out of their way for customer service- this place is no exception. \n\n-a must see Museum to see if you're in the City.", "author": "MK C."}

Through the years, its collection has outgrown its space. Eventually in 1994, the City of San Francisco approved a measure to renovate the former Main Library to make it the new home of the Asian Art Museum.\n\nDesigned by the World famous architect Gae Aulenti - best known for her award-winning project of  the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris - the museum has a Roman Empire kind of grandness as well as an old, traditional kind of Asian opulence.  There are plenty of open spaces that enable people to enjoy the exhibits and not feeling crowded.  There are also many places for one to sit and stare at the art, and to ponder and wonder.\n\nAs the museum states in one of the signs, there really isn't anything known as Asian culture, as inhabitants in different regions have little in common with each other (culturally).  Therefore, the museum's collection is divided into 7 distinct groupings:\n\n* South Asia\n* The Persian World and West Asia\n* Southeast Asia\n* The Himalayas and The Tibetan World\n* China\n* Korea\n* Japan\n\nThe museum is made up mostly of adjoining rooms with each room hosting a specific grouping distinctly.  The focus of each room is clear.  As you move from room to room, you'll get a feeling like you are traveling from one country to another, from one dynasty to another, from one century to another.\n\nFrom one World to another.\n\nThis has to be one of the largest (if not the largest) collection of Asian art in the Western World.  It contains exhibits ranging from over 6,000 years ago to near modern times.  The collection is huge and impressive.  However, I did find that they had an overwhelming amount of deity in their collection.  While I understand that deity is a great part of Asian culture in many regions, I am hoping that in the future they can balance it out a little.\n\nWhat it cost to get to San Francisco:  An arm and a leg.\n\nAdmission: $15.\n\nExperience:  Timeless and priceless.", "author": "Rob L."}

I especially liked the \"Enter the Mandala\" exhibit.  First you must cross the circle of fire......\n\nFrom their website:\n\n Mandalas are maps of Buddhist visionary worlds.\nMinutely detailed and saturated with philosophical meaning, these works (most often paintings or sculptures) are a feast for the eyes and the mind--nested squares and circles are arrayed to represent the center of the cosmos and the four cardinal directions. For Buddhist practitioners, however, mandalas are not just images to view, but worlds to enter--after recreating the image in their mind's eye, meditators imaginatively enter its realm.\n\nBut is it possible to have this experience without years of meditative discipline?   \n\nEnter the Mandala says yes. In this exhibition, 14th-century paintings align a gallery with the cardinal directions, transforming open space into an architectural mandala--a chance to experience the images in three dimensions, to dwell in the midst of the cosmic symbols and be transported to another world.

Used for centuries, this ritualistic practice is still utilized today. At the museum, you can see various types of intricately drawn Mandalas, carefully preserved from all over Asia. Another interesting thing I discovered is that during this meditative practice, depending upon the specific design of the Mandala, a particular mantra is recited along with it. \n\n*Stares off into the distance with peaceful eyes*\n\nOmmmmmmmmmm\n\nOh I'm so enlightened, I can't stand it. \n\nAnd when you further explore the museum, you travel through different Asian country exhibits ranging from Thailand, Japan, Korea, India, China, Indonesia, and many more. \n\nSome of the interesting things I saw, which are showcased all year long, were the Japanese Samurai Masks, the Sandstone Indian Deities which were remarkably detailed in carving that have stood the test of time, Southeast Asian puppets, Korean pottery and decorative urns, and variation upon variation of Buddhas sculpted and treasured through the eyes of each culture. \n\nPhew! What an experience. \n\nI was able to get a little taste of the different traditions, the values, the honor, the religions, the turmoil, the statuses, the victories and defeats, riches and possessions, the spirituality and humanity of Asian history.\n\nIt was a very extraordinary visit. I was also excited to see MOMA's collection coupled with The Asian Art Museum in the collaborative Gorgeous exhibit. Here is where beauty and expression is explored. How often are we challenged in our thought process when it comes to perception? This exhibit was very playful and fun and definitely gets you thinking about whether true beauty is an actual feeling and experience or is it just a visual sensory effect. \n\nAh who knowsssss dahling?! *bats lashes*\n\nThis monster size of a museum is directly across from City Hall and is right next to the SF Main Public Library. Huge in size, no corner is left untouched. Immaculately detailed and architecturally stunning, inside and out.\n\nAdmission depends on the day and time, but it's very fair in price. \n\nAdults $15\nYouth (13-17) $10\nChildren (12 and under) FREE\n\nThis to me is a whole helluva lot cheaper than a trip to Asia if one does not have the means to travel at the present moment. \n\nOh and who doesn't like a cheapie freebie? \n\nUhhhh Herro!\n\nFun place to check out on your day off. Pay a little extra for a guided tour. Totally worth it. \n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Ann S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-06", "description": "This review is for the Asian Art Museum as a Wedding Venue, not as a Museum.\n\nThe Asian Art Museum met all the requirements we wanted as a wedding venue. It had to be beautiful enough were we did not have to spend loads of $$ to make it pretty off decorations. It had to look grand. It had to be in the City of San Francisco. It had to be NOT your typical restaurant or hotel ballroom. It had to be classy yet contemporary.  It had to fit our budget. It had to have a space where it did not make you feel like you were in a museum.. all the time...\n\nOther museums had met our requirements, except for the budget. Others were charging about $5000 more than the AA museum, at just the STARTING rate. Insane! So after determining the date, we booked with the AA Museum. \n\nThey offer different packages according to how much space you need. We wanted our ceremony to be different than others, so we decided to have it on the steps up to the Loggia Hall. (cue clip from Family Guy about Robert Loggia). Our reception space  was in the Samsung Hall. We did not rent out the North nor South Light Court. I've seen other weddings hold their ceremony there, but I didn't like how the Museum Store showed up in their photos. They also provided the Peterson Room for the bride, WHICH WAS BEAUTIFUL, and one of the classrooms for the groom, which was spacious. \n\nWorking with the AA staff was magnificent. I basically planned the wedding myself with help from my parents, sister and my husband, who was deployed on the other side of the world. He was the one who actually suggested the AA Museum. I had been emailing Minda of the Rental Events department and set up a walk through with another person from the Rental Events dept., Joanna. It was hard at first to image a wedding in the space, but the space was so grand itself, I was sold. \n\nBefore you can sign, they require you to contact the SF Rec and Park Dept and SFMTA to see if there are any street closures or other City events in Civic Center that might affect your night. You also need insurance and a deposit. Since the place is a museum, it will not be open for the wedding party until 5:15 pm and 6:15 pm for guests, so if you want a day time ceremony, you're going to have to go somewhere else. \n\nMost of my conversations were through email. When I needed a walk through with other vendors at the Museum, I just emailed Minda and she would leave free passes at the Counter for us. As the day came closer, we had a final walk through with Minda and my day of coordinator to make sure everything fit and there was enough amp for all the equipment. She is very organized and professional yet humorous, just what a bride-to-be needed a couple weeks before THE DAY. We had some difficulty getting the Rental Insurance wording correct, but Minda was thorough and patient enough with us to work it out with our insurance provider. \n\nEverything went smoothly on THE DAY, except for the weather. It looked nice, but the wind was blowing at about 50 mph. Because of museum rules, guests were not allowed in until 6:15 PM, and we had guests already arriving at 5:30 pm. Minda was kind enough to open the doors to save them from being blown away.\n\nWe took photos in the gallery and in the halls. I was reluctant at first since the exhibit was PHANTOMS OF ASIA, but there were no scary ghosts floating around. All guests gathered in the Loggia Hall and the ceremony took place in the Grand Staircase. Cocktail hour in the Loggia while family members took photos in the garden behind the Peterson Room. Reception was spacious enough for all the tables, dance floor, dj equipment, cake and 153 guests. Security guards stood out of the way but kept things in check. It was all wonderful. \n\nBecause the Black and White Ball was the same night as our wedding, there were taxis and town cars all over to whisk guests away... and Cyndi Lauper rocking out in the distance in the beautifully lit Civic Center. Couldn't have had a better location.", "author": "Lauren Y."}

The permanent collection is cool, but the exhibitions are what draws the crowd.  The current exhibit is called \"Seduction: Japan's Floating World\" which showcases the courtesans of Edo-period Japan.  I went to the opening party, and the Asian Art Museum knows how to throw a party!  The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence graced us with their presence, and there were sake tastings and dirty haikus.  It was awesome.\n\nI've eaten at the cafe, and I have to say it's not worth it.  There are really great Asian restaurants nearby.  Yes, you'd be walking in the Tenderloin, but I think the food is better outside the museum.  Plus, since the cafe is inside, you'd be paying much more than what's available in the Tenderloin.\n\nThe Asian Art Museum is a great place to roam and look at wonderful pieces of art.

The first floor was the special exhibit on the Larry Ellison collection, which included many folding screens and scrolls. I loved that we could walk around at our leisure and read about each masterpiece. The second floor included art from China, Japan, and Korea as well as the special exhibit on the Cyrus Cylinder. Unfortunately, the wait for that particular exhibit was extremely long. About 45 minutes to an hour. We decided to skip that exhibit and view the rest of the museum. The third floor was mostly sculptures of Buddha. \n\nWhat I loved was that each display in the museum included a little card that tells the story behind each artwork. Every scroll tells a story and shows a style of art. Each folding screen can tell the story of four different seasons or the story of a war. I loved that I can learn the story that was involved in the artwork which made viewing everything so much more fun and interesting.\n\nI definitely recommend coming here to view the exhibits. It's relatively cheap on regular day, about $12 for an adult. They also open up the museum on Thursday nights for $5. But if you're not sure if art is your thing, try going on the first Sunday of the month. Entry is free and you can see if this holds your interest. The only downside of going on the free Sunday is that there's a lot of people.", "author": "Andrea G."}

Came here with my friend on another first Sunday, so it was free, yay! On the first floor, they had an arts and crafts place for visitors - making badges and re-usable bags. So cool... I felt like a little kid again! :)\n\nThis is a three story museum filled with beautiful Asian art (paintings, sculptures, pottery, and more). On the day that we went, they had a food presentation about Filipino-American infused food. They were also handing out pork belly samples - yum! It was really cool learning about how much salt is in different foods. It definitely made me more aware of what I should and shouldn't be eating!

Most of the galleries are fairly lackluster, and even though there are three floors, each one leaves much to be desired. After going through NY and seeing some fabulous museums, like the Met or the Museum of Natural History, the Asian Art Museum cannot stand up to those at all. The recent bing ma yung (aka Terracotta Warriors), however, are freaking awesome. There were only 7 of them and 2 horses, alongside several other small trinkets, but I love my history, and these guys were impressive. They could have done much better with the translation. Only the titles were in English and Chinese, while the description paragraphs were straight-up English. That's a disservice to all the Chinese people in the area who cannot speak or read the language. Come on, it's SF.\n\nOh, and don't be fooled into parking in the underground lot. Waste of money, especially because meters on Sunday are 25 cents for an hour, and there are plenty of 2 hour/unlimited spots very close by.", "author": "Danny C."}

The exhibit on the Japanese tea ceremony was super cool and informative. I learned about the legend of Moon Rabbit from that exhibit and can't believe I didn't know about Moon Rabbit before! The only odd thing to me was that Mongolia seemed to be hardly represented. The museum shop is fantastic but I had a slightly underwhelming experience in the cafe. I had tea, veggie spring rolls, and a lunch special of veggie maki. The rolls were flavorful, but very sloppily put together and service was erratic. I think in the future I will just opt for tea.

When I visited the Louvre in Paris, my friend had to pack Gu for me so that I could energy up and walk the full 5 miles I did IN the museum.  \n\nThe Asian Art Museum on the other hand, isn't overwhelming in that sense - despite the scope and history of what is \"Asian\".  I thought the instructional write ups and descriptions that accompanied each piece was interesting and narrative.  I stepped away from the experience wanting to read more about the deities of Indian culture, the skills and process involved in shaping jade and get a refresher course on the motifs found throughout Chinese culture that represent blessings, wealth and longevity etc.\n\nGiven my own Chinese heritage and countless visits to museums and historic sites throughout China - I was still intrigued and delighted to discover art and traditions that I've never seen or heard of.

I mean completely ripped apart. Wedge portion separated from upper. Totally unsalvageable. Making matters more difficult is that I had my 5 year old in her stroller aaaaaaand I was now lopsided, in filthy Civic Center with barely anything between my right foot and someone's urine. I wanted to cry. \nI took a deep breath, walked into the museum and presented my membership card. I sheepishly asked if they sold any shoes at the gift shop, the front desk person heard my story, didn't know but clearly felt bad for me. I went into the gift shop and, of course, they don't have any shoes, but they did have several amazing employees. They took my shoe pieces down to their shipping department (because they had packing tape and glue) and, in less than 15 minutes, fixed my shoe with packing tape enough so that I could make it 2 blocks to the closest Walgreen's, buy a pair of furry loafer slippers (rubber soled so my feet were shielded from street filth), and return to the museum to resume our day. I know my messy braid was even messier from the wind, my eyes were probably crazy with desperation and the shoe had seen better days (though not enough to warrant falling apart like that lol). I am so grateful to those women for their kindness. So grateful that my daughter could see such kindness. So sorry that, in my haste, I didn't get their names. I almost left and got right back on BART but their offer to fix my shoe literally fixed my day.

The symbolic power of the bronze vessels and bells (they were made in sets of up to 70 bells) give us some sense of the sophistication of those war lords and their artisans which helped them dominate a large area of central China for centuries.\n\nPhoto of a team of horses from the Warriors exhibit is on the Museum's photo page in Yelp.", "author": "William L."}

But now I appreciate and enjoy it more.  \n\nSince the Geisha -  Beyond the Painted Smile exhibit in 2004, I've had a membership with the Asian.  Some of the exhibits that followed have been great (Lords of the Samurai, Bali, Maharaja, Shanghai) while others have not been to my taste (Phantoms of Asia).  But there's always something in the main collection that draws my attention.  The jade room is gorgeous. I love looking at the Korean textiles, the Japanese ukiyo-e (especially one that depicted one of the lanterns at Sensoji that is not currently on view).\n\nAnd some of their events are fantastic.  Love the Bell Ringing Ceremony just before New Year and the Mochi Pounding right after.  Matcha nights are always fun.  The nieces enjoy this museum because the kids' activities are very well thought out.\n\nThe girls also enjoy the Asian because of the Cafe.

We got married at the Asian Art Museum in Summer 2015.  \n\nNot only is the museum breathtakingly beautiful but it is a historical building and non profit. Our rental fee was not considered a donation--and therefore not tax deductible, but we felt very good that our money would be going to a place that benefits the public. Also it is a place that we can easily take our future kids to see.\n\nWe got married in the loggia on the landing of the grand staircase. Our cocktail hour was in the loggia, and we opened up the 2nd floor galleries to our guests. The dinner and reception were held in Samsung Hall (which used to be the card catalog room when it was the library). \n\nAt first we were a little hesitant about having the ceremony on the stairs as it isn't as traditional. However, after speaking with Lorraine and my now husband, we decided it would be best to maximize the beauty of the space and take advantage of the architecture. Also, it would be cheaper as we wouldn't have to rent out the Hall for the entire day to accommodate set up. \n\n== Staff: 5 stars ==\nWe worked with Lorraine and Minda. Most of our communication was via email, and they allowed us to visit the museum as much as we needed to in order to help us plan. Both were a joy to work with, knowledgable, organized, laid-back and responsive. \n\nLorraine was our first point of contact. She was so helpful and not pushy. When we met her, we were immediately put at ease. She answered all of our questions promptly and had a lot of useful advice about how best to utilize the space. \n\nMinda worked with us as our wedding got closer and was on site during our wedding and at our rehearsal at the museum. She was there the entire evening to ensure everything went smoothly. \n\n== Venue: 5 stars == \n- The museum is GORGEOUS. There are so many great places to take photos and as far as decor, we had to do very little as the Beaux Arts architecture is stunning in photos and in person. \n- There is so much history within the building and in Civic Center Plaza. It was once the SF public library until about the mid-1980s, which my husband and I both love. \n- The ceremony can be held in a variety of places in the museum (grand staircase, side halls, Samsung Hall). There is a lot of flexibility with the space.\n- The bathrooms are clean and there are multiple stalls. A little weird to be calling this out, but when having a larger wedding, it does make a difference for guests. \n\n== Rental Details ==\n- There is a list of preferred caterers and all of the best caterers in the city are already on that list, so I wouldn't worry too much. We also viewed this as a plus as we wanted to work with vendors familiar with the space to make the day of as easy as possible.\n- Weddings start a little later (6:30pm) and the standard latest end time is 12:00am. This worked out perfectly for us as we had a shorter wedding ceremony on site. \n- One thing that was a little surprising (to us at least) is that they are a little stricter on flowers to help protect the artwork. There are guidelines as well as some preferred vendors, so it isn't too much of an issue.  \n- Fee includes security staff, use of the Peterson Room, a small garden and a few other rooms that can be used for vendors. Often times, one of the bonus rooms is used for kids, which is immensely helpful.  \n\nIf you're looking for an indoor venue that is classic, elegant and can accommodate 120-180 guests, we highly recommend the Asian Art Museum. The venue is beautiful and the staff is very experienced--helping to make a memorable and stress free wedding.", "author": "K K."}

Coupled with my lucky public parking adjacent to the museum and a free admission Sunday, it really could not have been more perfect.\n\nSo why am I giving them only 3 stars?\n\nMy FOUR well-behaved children were complimented by several other patrons as well as the tour guide. They were never an issue. My issue was a particular museum security personnel that stalked me to say, verbatim, \"This is a classy place. Do not carry your child on your back. Carry him in front instead.\"\n\nI had my child in a Kinderpack child carrier.\n\nFirst, I was not told that I could not carry my child upon entrance.\nSecond, I fail to see how carrying my child in front would make it any more classy.\nThird, I was sure that he lacked the tact and training to approach me in a more friendly, professional manner that one would expect from such a \"classy\" place.\n\nAfter having been twice harassed by the same man, I paged a supervisor on my way out, reported the incidents, and he clarified that it was indeed a museum policy for both the child's and the art's sake that children, bags, and backpacks are carried only in front to avoid accidental bumping into the art. Now that is a language I can agree with!\n\nSo lesson learned: Only go sans kids. Forget the stroller. It too can bump into the priceless art, senseless parents! (I jest...) Forget the carrier.

I'd never seen a contortionist before and it was amazing...like seeing a gymnast do a magic show!\n\nMy only complaint is the food. The restaurant was pretty overpriced and they didn't seem to have any idea what was in their food since it all came from other places. I tried eating some of their bean curd filled pastries since it was the only thing that was labeled and still ended up getting sick from it. Blegh. Stupid food allergy.\n\n*Wheelchair accessible!

Previously we went for the Terra Cotta Warriors and before that it was the Samurai Swords, Armor and Apparel exhibits.  Never have we been disappointed.  The individual items' descriptions bring the exhibit together with continuity and clarity. For the last exhibit we downloaded the AAM and although we didn't use it for the entire visit, when we did use it it was convenient and provided more information that was available on the information placards.  I'm also impressed by the art that was available in the app.  Perhaps I should write a review for the app in the Android store.....hmmm....anyway...\n\nWe didn't have time to examine the rest of the museum on our most recent trip but on earlier trips we toured most of the building and were impressed by the range of artifacts.  The museum staff / security (?) are very lenient and patient in enforcing policy.  This is the first time I've actually fallen asleep writing a review so I apologize if I've inspired fatigue in you as well, dear reader.  I suppose that if I have a point it's that this place should be visited soon.  Before the artifacts come to life as in the recent series of films with Ben Stiller.  In time everything will be viewable through VR goggles so you can experience it from the comfort of your couch....but I think there's more value in seeing these things on your feet with your own eyes.  Okay that's more than one point but digression is something I'm struggling with. Something with which I'm struggling.  Anyway we had fun.  Go and you'll have fun too.", "author": "E G."}

And it's super cool to see these things in person. Each warrior is really different - you notice one has higher cheekbones and another has eyes more wide apart. Try to take the docent tour, it's pretty interesting! \n\nThe museum itself has a very big and extensive collection of asian things - mostly pottery type things and like religious statues made of stone. It's cool to see the first time but after that you realize there are a lot of pottery type things (pots, vessels) and a lot of statues of Buddha, so it gets slightly repetitive. i thought that the jade room on the third floor was really cool and the gallery on the second floor with the chinese paintings is really nice. the section with korean art and artifacts is small. \n\nAll in all, the museum is a nice way to spend the afternoon!", "author": "Sylvia K."}

I needed to come here for my Art History class on Non-Western art. Admission can be pricey, but you can get a discount with a student ID. It's also free admission on the first Sunday of every month. For general adult admission it was $15. And I believe for the special exhibits would have been another extra $5. The special exhibit today was about how \"Japan influenced western artists like Van Gogh.\" I was considering if I should have went to this exhibit but decided not to since my art history class was focusing on non-western arts. I thought it would have been a very fascinating exhibit though. \n \nThe museum itself was wonderful, the galleries were amazing and I was just in awe of the cultures embodied into these art pieces. \n\nThis museum also has a little gift shop as well as a restaurant/cafe on the first floor. \n\nMy only bad experience was that I was wearing a thick jacket and a backpack so I gave only my jacket to coat check. The girl working at the coat check area gave me a little black circle with a number and she clearly saw that I had a backpack on. As I was taking photos for my assignment on the 2nd floor, the security guard stops me and tells me that backpacks aren't allowed and that I needed to give it to coatcheck. I was a bit angry because no one said I couldn't bring my backpack with me, especially not the girl working at coat check who clearly saw me with my backpack. So I go back downstairs and give my backpack to her to put with my jacket, and she can't find it. Apparently the number she gave me was not the official locker number but a coat hanger number, and she was fumbling around confused at where she put my jacket. I was at a loss for words because my jacket was misplaced and the number she gave me wasn't even the official locker tag. Sigh. In the end I got my jacket and backpack back and I left. I think the people here need to make it clear that backpacks aren't allowed because not EVERYONE knows that. Also coat check department needs to step up their organizing skills.", "author": "Lisa L."}

The Tenderloin area is little intimidating and considered the \"ghetto\" of the area according to a few locals I talked to. But this museum is adjacent to city hall probably the public library and other major city offices. Kinda surprising it borders a shady area. They have pretty much all the major historical pieces of South and Southeast Asia and there's a lot to take in. I got here at about 4:30 and they do have a late hour discount of $7. I zipped through most of the standing exhibits. There are a few special exhibits on the ground floor which are an additional expense. This is a rather large museum in a rather large building.

Well, I made my anticipated return to the Asian Art Museum to view the exhibit:  Maharajah:  The Splendor of India's Royal Court ongoing now through April 8, 2012. Viewing the artwork and the Cartier jewellery were the factors that inspired my return visit to the Asian Art Museum.  I saw a feature on the exhibition in one of the local news programs and was taken by the sight of a royal silver carriage, a gold throne, and a Cartier necklace commissioned by the Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala in 1928 (and reconstructed/restored in 2002 with some substitute stones according to a postcard I bought). That is the Cartier necklace I really, really want. (Wink, wink.)\n\nHere is a link to the introduction about Maharajah: The Splendor of India's Royal Court:\nhttp://www.asianart.org/maharaja/about.htm\n\nThe exhibit showcases India's royal history from the 1700s to the 1940s examines the real and perceived worlds of the maharaja from the early eighteenth century to 1947, when the Indian princes ceded their territories into the modern states of India and Pakistan in conjunction with England's Victoria and Albert Museum. One of the descriptions from the website promoting the V&A catologue:  \"Paintings, photographs, textiles and dress, jewelry, jeweled objects, metalwork, and furniture--Indian objects as well as pieces imported to India from the West--are considered within a broader historical context, exploring royal status and identity, court culture and patronage.\"  \n\nIndia was a British colony (and considered the jewel of the British crown) until 1947.  Becoming a maharaja or maharani (king or queen, respectively) and high status. Under British rule, the Indian people were encouraged (or forced) to adopt the Western customs of the British. Some of the Indian people willing adopted and adapted to the British ways of living. \n\nI got admission through the Discover and Go pass.  When I headed to the wing housing the exhibit, I caught sight of the royal silver carriage made for the Maharaja of Bhavnagar by the First Coach Factory in 1915.  Trimmed with the heads of a bulldogs, swans, and other types of animal heads instead of the usual lions, tigers and bears. Oh, it has been sometime that my breath was taken away by the sight of a silver coach, cor!  The exhibit is divided into three galleries.  Here is a link to an online gallery showing highlights from the three galleries and outside the galleries in the wing:  http://www.asianart.org/maharajagallery/maharajagallery.html \n\nThe first gallery covers the early history of India's maharajas.  There is an example of a the throne room of an Indian court with a depiction and a description of what was in the throne room in that era.  I have an affinity for a beautiful white jade teapot and cover decorated with rubies and gold along with turban jewellery made of gold, rubies, emeralds, diamonds, and pearls  from the 1650s to 1700s. \n\nThe second gallery covers India during the British rule and Western European era.  There was a howdah, an elephant throne, which caught my eye when I entered the gallery.  There is a short video showing how a howdah is placed on the elephant and the attendant getting dressed for the procession.  There was also a long scroll depicting a royal procession, which was really interesting to view and see.\n\nThe third gallery focuses on the European/Western influence on India.  This one contained the lusted-after Cartier necklace:  \"Necklace. Cartier Paris, special order, 1928. Reconstructed with some substitute stones in 2002. Platinum, diamonds, yellow zirconia, white zirconias, topazes, synthetic rubies, smoky quartz, citrine. Created for Sir Bhupindra Singh, Maharaja of Patiala.\"  And there was a probable wedding costume:  \"Poshak (costume for a woman). About 1900. Silk brocade with gold thread, base metal and sequins. Private Collection.\"  It was a heavy costume to wear; fortunately, the wearer was able to sit down as desired and to alleviate the bearing of the heavy weight while wearing it.\n\nThere was a pleasant surprise, a Bernard Boutet de Monel oil on canvas portrait of the Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar II  of Indore in a tuxedo, white tie, white vest, and (probably) tails wearing a black cape lined in white silk (c.1929).  There were also photographs of Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar II with his wife, Sita Devi taken by Cecil Beaton; that was a real treat for me to see Beaton portraits in this exhibition.  There was also some western furniture on display that belonged to this maharaja, one that stood out in my mind was an art deco style red leather chaise lounge with a built-in ash tray.  \n\nOutside was the aforementioned silver carriage.  Unfortunately, the owner requested that no photographs of any kind be taken. No problem--a postcard is available in the gift shop.\n\nI do hope I can make another visit to this exhibition before it closes on April 8. I think it is definitely worth a revisit.", "author": "Chiara A."}

I enjoyed the lighting play on one of his Japanese screens that dramatically changes its appearance with the lighting rotation. Very interesting! quiet...very interesting...\n\nBe careful walking into this display when it is dark or dim.  There are low lying wooden benches in front of the display and not much room to maneuver around the people standing to watch the light play.\n\nOn my next and future visits I plan to stop and purchase the headphones and self  guided tour and/or join one of the tours listed with starting times at the information table set up across from the museum store.  \n\nI would recommend using the Hastings law school garage located on Larkin just north of the museum.  Very secure, friendly staff, clean and lighted.  We left our car here and walked the distance into Hayes Valley to explore and have a bite there.", "author": "Rebecca B."}

I just walked around wishing there was more than statues... maybe bring in modern art? ::shrug:: \n\nNot exactly my cup of tea. (Pun intended.)\n\nI was there for the Filipino American Heritage Month event, representing the American Heart Association at a sodium information booth & cooking demo. So, this review will be in regards to that. \n\nThe woman who organized the whole event did such a great job with all the logistics and scheduling. Everything ran swimmingly, especially the food events at Samsung Hall.\n\nThe audio visual team did a fantastic job with keeping all the sights and sounds going. Seriously, flawless victory. This was probably the smoothest flow of demonstrator/speaker transitions I'd ever experienced. No reverb, no mics too close to the speaker, no static, no nothing. It was amazing! \n\nI was originally supposed to do an intimate cooking demo with around 20 people or so, but the turnout was a lot bigger than they expected. I found myself at the mercy of ~150ish hungry Filipino folks, eager to sample the goods. Imagine their daggered glares when I spent the first 10 minutes of my presentation essentially bashing Filipino food culture in all its high-sodium, high-calorie, saturated fat laden glory. \n\n::shudder::\n\nAt least there was an awesome woman in the combat boots who helped me with my Madonna headset mic (for the demo that suddenly had a giant audience) and made sure I didn't sound like a goober (at least decibel-wise).

You take an escalator to the top of the museum, and then move through and down several rooms/stories, each collection of rooms themed around an Asian region (Persia, Japan, Korea, multiple Chinese periods, India, Southeast, etc).  \n\nThe general collection really functions just as much as a historical museum than an art museum, although many of the rooms did contain contemporary pieces from artists of that region.  Absolutely fascinating collection, ranging from Buddha statues to contemporary Korean paintings to jade miniatures to snuff bottles to illuminated Koran copies.  \n\nI really gravitated the most toward the Japanese aesthetic, and in particular some of the contemporary pieces in the contemplation alcove.\n\nA world class, unique, and beautiful museum.

Yeah, I got beat up a lot in Dallas.\n\nSo I have a fondness for this place since it's the museum of my peeps....and my peeps' ancestors. Yeah, they were hella Asian...much more than me.

Yep, Target is wisely sponsoring the free days since they know their biggest customers are cheap Asians like me.\n\nI came here with Jamie W. and waited in a line full of...you guessed it ...cheap Asians. OK, maybe they're not cheap, just culturally astute. But what the hell ...they're cheap, too. I got to meet and shake hands with the curator and have my photo taken with Bullseye the Target dog (see my avatar). Guess which one gave me the bigger thrill.\n\nAs a lot of you know already, there are three floors of Asian art and antiquities...pieces I've been lucky to see in their original locales like Angkor Wat in Cambodia or the Kama Sutra temples in Khajuraho, India.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-11-13", "description": "People walking into this museum and expecting Western styles of art will be disappointed. I suspect that's where a lot of the negative reviews come from. \n\nThe Asian Art Museum is not the place to go to find bizarre abstract sculptures, ornate religious mosaics or paintings of identifiable Western eras. If you want \"exciting\", go to the de Young. If you want \"crazy\", go to SFMOMA. If you want a warm, welcoming community of Asians passionate about their history, heritage and culture, go to the Asian Art Museum.\n\nSo many nationalities are represented here, though there's a bit more emphasis on the major East Asian cultures. I'd recommend checking out the \"basket\" section of Japanese art (beautiful designs), the rod puppets and the dagger collection. The current exhibit of Chinese calligraphy is also gorgeous to behold, even if you can't read a Chinese character to save your life. I personally think the book section of the gift shop is fantastic, containing relatively rare cookbooks and textbooks that you definitely won't find on Amazon. If you're looking to learn about the tea culture of Kashmir or the mythology behind famous Chinese dishes, this is your resource.\n\nTIP: In my opinion, the best part of the Asian Art Museum isn't its art. It's the events, which are run by a wonderful community of friendly volunteers who are passionate about Asian cultures. Take a look at the calendar of events on the website. If you like what you see, seriously consider buying an Active-level membership. It's good for 1 year from the date of purchase and costs $75--for 2 people. Yes, that's only $37.50 per person. Most AAM events are free with general admission ($12 for adults). That means you only need to visit the museum 3-4 times in the next year to make your membership worth it. You can also bring in one guest for free on regular days and an unlimited number of guests on special \"member\" days. So if you like what you see on the calendar, grab a friend, significant other or family member, and buy an Active membership pass. It'll be worth it. I just used mine recently to attend a Chinese gongfu tea ceremony with my friend. Not only was everything free for the both of us, but the ceremony took place in a gorgeously decorated room, there were Chinese sweets to accompany the delicious white oolong tea they brewed for us, the entire event was run by the nicest old Chinese ladies, and we each received a beautiful brocaded pouch at the end containing a glossy porcelain Chinese teacup. \n\nNot bad for the price of...FREE. :)", "author": "Josephine L."}

I was sad to find out that all the exhibits on the first floor were closed.  The focus on the exhibits was mostly China, Korea & Japan.  There are some others (Indonesia, Pakistan, etc.) but not nearly as extensive.\n\nIf you're a college student (or a graduated one like myself), bring your ID card and it's only $7!  There's also a restaurant, Cafe Asia, on the first floor but it looks expensive and there aren't any Asians inside.\n\nMetered parking is available outside but with a maximum time limit of one hour.

Shanghai is such a classy city, and probaby the most classy one in China, way ahead of its time by Chinese standards. \n\nThe exhibit is set up in 4 sections: Beginnings, High Times, Revolution, and Shanghai Today.  \n\n\"Beginnings\" is a great exhibit depicting the art of Shanghai's rise to becoming an international port city of Asia with the many influences of European traders and governments.  From the Beginnings and into the \"High Times\" exhibit, comes the classic Shanghai ideal that many of us know Shanghai to be.  \n\nWhat I loved about the \"High Times\" exhibit is its display of how Shanghainese women were the front-runners of fashion on China.  There is a wonderful display of 4 traditional gowns.\n\nIt was here in Shanghai that the traditional Chinese gowns (Qi Pao in Mandarin and Cheong Sam in Cantonese) first were established among the upper class Shanghainese woman.  These traditional dresses eventually became the norm for all Chinese women throughout the country.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s3kwbvB8qAzZUtV0rSlypg?select=4dpRlABQTcVSVPrZ29iLLw\n\nMost of the Art in the \"Revolution\" exhibit were propaganda related from WWII to the Cultural revolution, which included many posters rather than art paintings, but it was interesting to see just how full of artistry the propaganda posters were in trying to portray their messages of the time.  \n\n\"Shanghai Today\" displayed much of the art pieces of Shanghai rising to reclaiming its role as an international trade player.  \n\nOf the various exhibits, High Times was my favorite as it was during these times that the Classical Shanghainese culture really started to shine--from clothing, architecture, music etc.  \n\nMy only suggestion for this Shanghai Exhibit would be to play some traditional Chinese--Shanghainese music throughout to really add to the overall feel of putting folks into the scene of how Shanghai life was.  I love museums, but I don't like pitch silence.  \n\nShanghai is probably one of my favorite Cities in China, as it is such a beautiful metropolis yet still it maintains its traditional roots. \n\nDefinitely visit.", "author": "Cass J."}

The venue is very well maintained, beautiful, and clean, as a museum should be, but as far as exhibits go, it's just not that interesting. Maybe I'm just being picky, after being to museum in China and Japan, the exhibits here just doesn't appear as impressive, kind of a seen-this-done-that feel. The modern Buddhism exhibit was the most interesting to me because it merges Buddhism imagery with modern art, not typical of traditional Asian art. \n\nFor an Asian museum in the US, it does have a wealth of artifacts (kind of makes you wonder why all these things are not in their country of origin...), and for those who are interested in Asian culture but haven't the chance to visit the actual countries, this place would be a good preview.", "author": "Claudia Z."}

The Lords of Samurai exhibit was an apt introduction to the samurai way of life which I know nothing about, except from what I've seen on Tom Cruise's movie, The Last Samurai.  Although Hollywood tried its best to portray Japanese history at that time, it barely scratched the surface.  With this exhibit,  I was reminded of virtues that make a true samurai: honesty, self-control, self-sacrifice and loyalty to name a few.  It mainly focuses on the Hosokawa family's impact on Japan's history with their family lineage that dates back 700 years.  I wasn't able to take photos in the exhibit but I was able to see ornately designed samurai attire, intricate drawings on silk screens, beautiful tapestry and priceless ceramics.  There was also an education center where you can experience living as a \"daimyo\" for a day, practicing tea ceremony, trying on a warrior helmet and they also played Japanese short films.\n\nAn interesting fact I learned was the subtlety of courtship.  Japanese courtiers would make games out of guessing fragrances and write poems with references to a lover's incense scented kimono. \n\nAhh....the thrill of the chase. \n\nWhat happened?  now, it's \"I'm horny.  my place or yours?\"\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAsian Art museum succeeds at being an institution which not only showcases Asian art, but preserves its history as well. \n\nCome and visit.

We got through the Samurai exhibit in about 50 minutes...leaving 10 minutes to check out the rest of the museum.  I didn't do my research, so I had no idea there were 3 floors!  We only got through a portion of the 2nd floor before we got booted onto the street.  \n\nI actually really liked this museum!  They had a lot of interesting items on display.  I liked seeing all the different suits of armor that the Samurais wore...very colorful and detailed.  They didn't allow photography in the main exhibit, but I was able to snap a few shots upstairs.\n\nGeneral admission is $12, and if you want to see the Lords of the Samurai exhibit, its an extra $5.

I like how they separated the sections and showed the differences among all the Asian cultures. (See guys, we're NOT all alike!) One thing that gets me a little irked is the fact that the Korean exhibit was definitely lacking.  The fact of the matter is, what I recognize is Korean art was in the Japanese section.  This is not me being racist or hating b/c of the korea/japan thing, i wasn't even born so I don't even care, but I wish that they could have categorized correctly or have a section of the fusion of cultures because of the occupation of korea by japan.  It would make sense because a lot of japanese art is influenced by the countries they occupied. \n\nStill, without that part, the Korean exhibit is really small and disappointing. The other exhibits are good and I just enjoyed seeing everything and learning a bit more about other cultures.", "author": "Meena N."}

Nope we were wrong, the line moved pretty fast and some of the employees were outside making sure those who were seeing the exhibit was prepared to pay the $5. \n\nWe get inside and it was crowded. Ugh. And we knew it was going to be a little rough being able to fully enjoy the exhibit, yet it was. We went inside the first room, and boy, it was hard to determine where to start first and what to read/look without someone butting in and ruining the atmosphere. After the first room we were a little confused as to where to go next but we wanted to get an information pamphlet. Thinking we were going to get our hands on one, they were completely out. Sigh. Oh well. So we move onto the next room and I really didn't like how some people were sneaking in photos and not being truly appreciative of the showcase. I understand you want to captivate the wonders of exhibition but museums aren't meant to be exposed like that. It's only better if you actually see it yourself, this is why museums are actually built. \n\nBut any case i liked the storyline of Musashi and the artwork presented.

The final showing is tomorrow Sunday, September 20th.\n\nThis exhibit at the Asian Art Museum, is definitely a great informational and culturally rich experience.\n\nI learned many aspects of Samurai life.   From philosophy and strategy to a glimpse of the day in the life in feudal Japan.   Armor, swords, tea pots, kimonos oh my.    \n\nI was definitely impressed about the knowledge that the tour guides had, and fascinated about facts like how a Samurai sword is made.   Did you know an authentic Samurai sword has 15,000 layers of metal.  They do this by folding metal (doubling each the layer after each fold), which gives the strength and sharpness to the sword (combining iron and steel into one blade).   The sword is actually made up of a several pieces.  The blade has both an inner core of iron which has very little carbon which gives it strength and prevents shattering, and outer layer of steel with high carbon gives it potential for sharpness.  That's why authentic swords are not only strong but has superior sharpness. \n   \nI was slightly disappointed that there wasn't a larger selection of swords and armor on display at this exhibit, but I did appreciate the art and history of the overall theme.\n\nAnother very intriguing aspect is that a Samurai will die defending their lord also known as a Daimyo, but a samurai who loses their lord, then becomes Ronin.  Many know about Samurai and Ronin through the many of the mainstream movies.   What few people know is that one of the most famous Ronin, Miyamoto Musashi, wrote a book \"The Book of 5 Rings\" which shared many of his teachings which is comparable to Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\".   Not as war like as you might think, but more about philosophy and ways to think about situations.    \n\nThis exhibit has inspired me to read more about Musashi and \"The Book of 5 Rings\". \n\nOverall the Asian Art Museum, provides a large selection of Asian art with significant historical and cultural importance.    And their special exhibits are done well.    I'd definitely would make another visit and I recommend you do too!", "author": "Richard L."}

You hardly can do better for $10.\n\nOne complaint about Matcha is that they should really take care of the cash bar situation. I was all about spending $6 on a beer or $10 on a fancy cocktail but 1. they stopped serving the specialty cocktail at 7 (I guess they were out of the cocktail mix) 2. the line is ridiculous.

We decided to just go at a faster pace and interpret things for ourselves.  \n\nI remember seeing an incredible array of various Buddha statues made from all different types of material.  This is probably one of the most extensive Buddha collections I've ever seen.

I really enjoyed seeing this room, and was familiar with the art as I've seen many Asian jewelry and art shops with this type of Jade.  \n\nThere was plenty more art and even architecture of the interior to amaze about such as Samsung Hall or the center hall with the massive columns.

They all told me- i would lose inspiration to paint or for visual art application in SF due to the complete joke of an art scene. \nI hate to be so judgmental but stereotypically we are a bit more critical & outspoken from that coast and it pains me to say- but they were right. This is 20 years later and although SF has other gems- their formal art scene, gallery scene, and museums are pathetic for a supposedly cosmopolitan city.\n\nI really wanted to give the museum scene another try as SF is developing and I would hope their sophistication would grow to keep up with the international flurry of new residents.\nSadly i really can't say they have.\nThis exhibit lacked any cohesion conceptually and in pieces displayed. There were historically phenomenal pieces such as Buddha and the Q'aran,  were mixed in with Jeffrey Koons, (Koons DID fit conceptually into exhibit's mission statement- as he is purposefully working with attraction and repulsion and many witness him this way)  Sallie Man's 80's controversial photography of overr-sexualizing her children, Picasso, the Hindu deity Durga, Mondrian, Rothko and a painting of Queen Latifah with elephant dung. There was a beautiful photo of a Senegalese girl in a pink dress and enjoyed the male re-make inspired by the famous  Odalisque.\nBut i could not understand conceptually how this could all be put together. No challenge to viewer, just unsophisticated conceptual execution & curation of a show of pieces spanning decades, movements and cultures that had no relation to each other or cohesive thread. It was a puzzle whose pieces could never fit. Maybe just a desperate attempt for finances to attract viewers with the title \"Gorgeous\" ?? I don't know- i am guessing..\nIt screamed of racism, & disrespect to display great religious traditions to many of these pieces in an exhibit that was supposed to challenge what the viewer saw as \"gorgeous\"  Advertised as \"A fine line between attraction and repulsion\".. in an attempt to shift focus from historical to cultural contexts\"   \n\nREALLY? MAJOR FAIL. not unique but discombobulated and juvenile.\nThe blurb under captions of pieces were juvenile as well- such as-  the photo of the Senegalese girl- \"does she know the photographer\" etc. umm really??\n\nIt is just horribly inappropriate to exhibit thangka paintings or the Q'aran which are just astounding in their significance, historical and cultural context, exquisite  craftsmanship, & geometric design in this exhibit supposedly challenging your concepts of \"attraction and repulsion.\"  \nI am exhausted with ubiquitous clich\u00e9  of three+ decades  inundating every advertisement of pushing some kind of stupid envelope.. The nauseating clich\u00e9d envelope did not get pushed nor did it have a sound basis in this exhibit. \nThe reminder that San Francisco lacks an advanced education in visual arts surfaces. Felt like an overly ambitious, failing to hit the conceptual mark & lack of education of a college freshman studying art.\ni love the concept of Thursday night performances with cocktails and socializing but I will omit any critique of what i witnessed..", "author": "shanti z."}

I tried to enjoy the rest of the museum and IT WAS FREEZING.  I couldn't stand still without shivering and getting a runny nose, and I swear 85% of the other guests had NO museum etiquette.  I know there needs to be climate control, but how about guest control?  I pretty much hustled through a fourth of the museum, barely stopping to enjoy anything, before giving up and sitting.  The two films I saw, one of them had tons of technical difficulties, the second dragged ON and ON in a freezing room.\n\nI understand, a lot of these complaints aren't entirely the museum's fault.

The high ceilings are gorgeous but the layout can be a bit confusing if you take one wrong turn  (such as going up the main stairwell to the second floor instead of the side escalator).\n\nTheir main collection is quite interesting, but I'll be honest when I say there's only so long I can look at the same essential statues of the same Hindu gods and goddesses. There's only so long I can look at the same basic pottery and the same looking wall hangings. All in all, it all starts to look exactly the same after a while.\n\nThe Shanghai exhibit was quite interesting, but we were not informed of the layout and I ended up viewing the exhibit backwards.

You try to walk and be mindful only to have people shoving you.  My 11 yr old was like jeez I'm just standing there looking and I get shoved around.  The exhibit viewing wasn't designed well.  Like they had a great timeline projecting on a wall, well people are looking at it naturally but it caused the viewers to block an entry way into an exhibit room.  But that was kind like all the wall depictions which were great information but then it caused blockages of people viewing the walls against those viewing the artifacts.  Just wasn't as well planned like an exhibit at the deYoung when they did the Impressionists.  Go early to the cafeteria if you want to eat there.

This is the only museum I've ever had a membership to, and tonight I'm going to renew my membership. Never before have I really been able to enjoy going to the same museum repeatedly until I discovered the AAM, and I'm so happy that I did!\n\nAs a history geek, I simply love the collection here. If you ever catch wind that I'm coming here, just ask a docent where the samurai sword is at in the Japanese collection, and chances are you're going to find me sitting there in awe of this amazing 600 year old razor-sharp weapon that looks like it was made yesterday. And the ancient Chinese pottery? Fahgetaboutit, love it - amazing! \n\nWhat really brings this place to life for me are the Matcha events, which are a brilliant combination of social mixers and live performance events  mixed with cultural education. Where else can you go to a beautiful, classic Beaux Arts building like this, feel like you're at a casual cocktail party, take in a live performance, and leave feeling like you had a brilliant time AND learned something educational? (Did you know the AAM was designed by the same architect that designed the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris?) \n\nThe museum also has a great program of visiting exhibitions from across Asia. Past exhibits have been on the Samurai, Shanghai, Bali and more. The variety is simply fantastic. If you don't like one exhibit, just wait a bit and another will take its place soon enough.\n\nIt's great that they also engage kids (and big kids like me!) with hands-on crafts (at least during Matcha events) to keep the kids occupied and discretely educate them about different cultures at the same time. Nothing here is in your face, and you can participate to whatever level you want. The staff has also been consistently awesome - polite, professional, courteous, and just downright happy. It says a lot about a place when the staff is happy.\n\nIf you get hungry or need some caffeine, stop by by cafe on the first floor. And if you're looking for swag, the gift shop has a good selection of stuff that you may (or may not) want to put into your home or gift to friends. It's pricey, but hey, it's a museum, that's usually the way it goes. \n\nI can't speak highly enough about this place.

Statues, paintings, relics and artifacts gave us insight into cultures that have influenced much of our modern societies. It is a great museum overall with a wide array of objects. It is not too large or too small, just the right size to spend an afternoon with friends or family discovering your heritage or learning more about a culture different than yours.\n\nI did notice that they had a cafe that looked quite good though we did not have time to try it.

Some of the most incredible art being made today is coming from Asia. I would LOVE to see some of this modern art, but you can't see it at the AAM.  For example, one of the best photographic artists in the world today is Hiroshi Sugimoto. In 2008, a traveling exhibition, designed by Sugimoto and covering all of his major works,  came to San Francisco. Where was it shown? The De Young.  I could probably list 50 living Asian artists today being shown widely at the world's top museums doing very exciting, influential work. Why can't AAM support these artists?\n\nOur Asian Art Museum is probably the most important museum for Asian art in the US.

San Francisco is good about that afterall.\n\nAAM is a classy museum as a venue, as an edifice, with a somewhat sinewy/hard to navigate set of galleries, but it's certainly the best museum I've ever seen dedicated to a particular ethnic cause rather than a historical art period or artist. I just feel that it felt more like a history museum because it was hard to pinpoint any particular spotlighting of \"Art movements\" in Asia (if there were any); but that rather the making of aesthetically pleasing utilizable forms (pans/kitchen stuffs for baking, Buddhas/Hindu Gods for worshipping, etc) was about the point of it. By this, I mean that I felt I was trying to find evidence that the broad, only geographically definable area called \"Asia\" really created art the way Europeans did: with complete abandon, sophistication, and most importantly, without reason. To me, art for the sake of art is the most exalted form it can be created in because you get a great deal of personal touch.\n\nThe AAM featured an exhibit called \"The Maharajahs\", displaying the splendor and majesty of the Indian subcontinent lords who created a community of kingship (akin to Europe's kings before the day sof the EU) among themselves, and considerable visibility and foklore about themselves among their populace. AAM showcased the flamboyant artifacts of the Maharajahs; a red chair to be saddled onto an elephant during pageants, an impressive shiny silver carriage (a real one, just outside the 3 exhibits), art depicting factual events and other miscellani (like an umbrella). While these artifacts were a treat to the eyes, the historical text writing and follow-along (they lend you walkman style adgets that give you audio tours) was poor. I didn't really get a fundamental sense of what was going on with these Maharajahs; the writing was rather \"glowy\"; kind of like in the way North Koreans might attempt to portray King Jong Il if you were on a tour of Pyongyang---euphemisms flying about. Much of the actual painting art was 2-dimensional and portrayed actual non-fictional events, usually centered around a Maharajahs love interest and how everything around them was just hunky dory. Call me a cynic, or blood thirsty, sometimes I just want to know: \"Was this possible because people in power were abusing underlies?\". I'm sorry, I just gotta know!\n\nThe rest of what AAM offers is quite exquisite. They break up the Asian demographics into rooms, showing SouthEast Asia, Western (as far west as the Persian empire) and Far East; the Koreas and Japan. Apart from the very meager Persian empire display, the rest of the museum was mostly dedicated to Oriental Asia and the museum did disclaim somewhere that the continent \"Asia\" is a European term; in fact, the peoples of Asia in their respective countries may very well have very little to do with each other lingually, culturally and politically.\n\nLots of ceramics. Some of them were so well restored, it looked like my dad created them in a ceramics workroom, except these, especially ones featured in the Japan and China exhibits, were dated from as far back as 6000BC! And then there were tons of Buddha statues of all forms, from Tibet to Thailand, Korea to Japan. They dominate the museum, probably accounting for about at least 50% of the works by count. Paintings, lastly, were rare, and often 2 dimensional, which, if taken for what it was, were beautiful renditions of historical events, but lacked artistic signature (artists were often unknown) and any articulatable art movements. I ask again: does/did Asia have art movements like in Europe? Is art important enough in Asia to warrant not only historical significance, but cultural significance? \n\nI ask all this because I want to know; does the AAM have a daunting task on their hands trying to bring Asian art to a public that often does not associate that continent with art at the level of sophistication and innovation found in Europe or elsewhere? I find it hard to believe that *not* to be the case; I think it more a problem with identifying how record-keeping was done---do that and perhaps there is more to find.\n\nJust as a side note, Russia is part of Asia too (at least Eurasia), right? I did not see anything coming from Russia either. Maybe a proper name for this museum is OAAM (Oriental Asian Art Museum).", "author": "Davey R."}

It comes with a  free audio tour, so make sure you get your audio pack at the Info desk.\n3) The museum store is so awesome. Everything from picture books to origami, to wooden furniture, to posters, to postcards. To whatever your brain can think of that might be in a museum gift shop, they have it and more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-02", "description": "I love museums.  Obsessed, even.  Blame my parents for bringing me to museums almost every weekend when I was a kid.  Or blame it on the fact that growing up in the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Area, free museums are the norm, and it's \"the THING to do\" when people come to visit (and people always come to visit). So we would take advantage of it and go to the Smithsonian Mall to patronize the museums (note: my favorite is currently the Hirshorn).\n\nSo when I first moved to San Francisco and discovered (gasp!) that we had to PAY to go to a museum?  Whaaaaaat?  NO WAY.  However, I quickly learned from my classmates that this is the norm in most of the rest of the world who grew up outside of the Bubble that is Washington, DC.  \n\nAnyway, that is why although I live almost across the street from the Asian Art Museum, I have been there TWICE since I moved to San Francisco.  Hey, I'm a poor, broke student.  (Note:  even if you ARE poor and broke like me, it really is no excuse not to go to the Asian Art Museum-- they're free ever first Sunday of the month.  In other words, I just suck at going to museums out here.  Oh, if you do decide to go on a first Sunday, go early because the line WILL wrap around the block, and you WILL have to wait.)\n\nThe exhibit currently up (which I am reviewing now) is Shanghai.  I went to the Thursday Night special event last night, which is a $10 entrance fee ($11.50 online) to go after hours, drink some wine (pay at the bar).  We got to see a performance by Coco Zhao, a Shanghainese Jazz singer.  I absolutely ADORE jazz, so I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Not only that, but in my spare time, I love creating art-- painting, drawing, etc.  This night was definitely perfect for me.  I got to dress up, look pretty, look at beautiful artwork, and hang out with friends.  There is definitely some amazing artwork on display.  We didn't get to finish seeing everything on the upper floors (I am debating going this coming Sunday for the first Sunday free entry!), but the Shanghai exhibit was definitely intriguing.  \n\nThe artwork from the 1920s showed Asian women dressed in Western garb.  Strange.  If you've watched Stephen Chow's movie, Kung Fu Hustle, you'll know what era I'm talking about.  First, the style of the artwork is clearly extremely Western-influenced (not just in terms of the subjects-- there is less calligraphy or sumi-e brush on rice paper, instead there is more oil on canvas, watercolor on paper, etc.), the subjects themselves are dressed in corsets and dresses rather than qipao or more traditional Chinese robes, and even the buildings look very boxy and Western, with balconies and pillars.  Very interesting.\n\nThe performance by Coco was excellent as well.  I can listen to old jazz forever and a day, and it was very strange (but cool!) to hear Chinese coming out of his mouth to melodic tones and patterns that are normally associated with Western cultures.  :D\n\nI think, however, the highlight of my night was getting the chance to make prints (similar to woodblock printing, except we used Styrofoam).  I got to draw to my heart's content.  We drew out a picture/design and carved it into the Styrofoam and then roll on the ink and print it onto one or multiple sheets of paper.  LOVED it.  I felt like a kid again.\n\nMaybe it's time to quit my day job and become an artist.", "author": "Jeanne Y."}

My friends held their wedding reception in the atrium just past the entrance; even though there were a few hundred of people at the wedding, it was an intimate space that enabled people to feel as though they were very close to the couple.  The reception was held upstairs in a room with really high ceilings - a beautiful, wood-paneled room that was, again, large but felt intimate.\n\nI know that the museum requires wedding parties to choose from a list of vendors and usually that translates into unappetizing food.  But I was quite impressed with the food...but not sure who the vendor was.

I finally went today, with my 4-month-old in tow, but never got past the security guy. \n\nSee, I use a baby carrier rather than a huge-ass stroller, and a backpack rather than one of those $100 diaper bags that hang on one shoulder and hurt your back because they're so stuffed with toys, wipes, blankets and other gewgaws. But when I got to the doors of the AAM, I was told I was going to have to check my backpack. \n\n\"You can borrow one of our strollers for free,\" the man said. \"Then you can take your bag inside.\"\n\nI asked why my pack would be OK if I borrowed one of their strollers. He pointed at a sign that said it was policy not to allow backpacks. That didn't make any sense at all, but I went with it. \n\n\"But it's a diaper bag,\" I said.\n\n\"It's our policy,\" he said. I think something was getting lost in the translation. \n\nHere's the problem: my baby has never been in a stroller, and putting her in one would almost ensure that she'd start screaming. To soothe her, I'd have to feed her. And for that I'd need my bag, and I couldn't tell whether I was going to have that with me or whether I'd need to stash it in coat check. \n\nIn other words, because of my choices, which would have ensured a happy, quiet baby in the museum, I was being asked to do a number of things almost guaranteed to disturb the other patrons -- all because they're presumably worried that I'm going to stuff some artifact in my backpack while nobody's looking. \n\nI accept that I chose not to take them up on their stroller offer. But I don't think a total blackout on backpacks is in any way patron-friendly, especially if it's because they're assuming everyone with a pack is a potential thief.

Definitely enjoyable, although you don't have much time to admire the exhibits if traveling with a docent. \n\nWe saw both performances of Brenda Wong Aoki and composer Mark Izu. While both the girl and I were familiar with the folklore Brenda told, I've never experienced anything like the fusion of music and her animated, hypnotizing style of storytelling. There were some slightly adult references mixed in, but nothing you couldn't bring a child to (which several parents did).\n\nIn-between Brenda and Mark's sets we went back to the Japanese wing.

I came here on Mother's Day (since it was free) to catch the last day of the Bhutan exhibit. Tons of gorgeous artwork from Bhutan and the two monks were really wonderful.

The sand pictures were gorgeous. \n\nThen on Father's Day, I came back to see the Lords of the Samurai Exhibit.

There's not a huge amount of armor and swords (which disappointed my friend) but the sheer amount of history of some of the pieces is amazing. \n\nThe other two levels exhibit more of the regular collection.

One piece of the Japanese god of passion impressed me, as he looked extremely angry. Well portrayed, because anger is one of the most common and one of the easiest to invoke. Sometimes it was amazing to see contrasting works in adjacent rooms, because the arts of Asia were so varied. The building itself was a work of art, as it was part of the Beaux-Arts Civic Center complex, the former main branch of the SF Public Library. \n\nOne day was not enough to enjoy all that the Museum had to offer. \n\nAFGHAN HIDDEN TREASURES \n\nWe went to see the Afghanistan Hidden Treasures, from the National Museum at Kabul. $12 each got us in the door, and another $3 each got us audio tour wands. Unlike the DeYoung, the Asian Art Museum did not have a special admission surcharge for the visiting exhibit. \n\nFour archaeological sites were represented in three rooms. We saw lots of detailed work in ivory, some amazingly sophisticated glass work, and some gold and silver work from various sites. There were interesting pieces done in alabaster, schist, porphyry, turquoise, and many other materials. A silver plate inlaid with gold was one of the first impressions, illustrating a mix of cultures from across the world and a skill of which a modern smith would be proud. Evidence of the influence of India, Babylon, Persia, and Greece were clearly pointed out in the interpretive signs and the audio tour. There was more, much more to be seen than the tours indicated, though. With open eyes we discovered much of the fascinating complexity and beauty of the Silk Road civilizations that were in the territory we now call Afghanistan. \n\nThis exhibit is worth a trip just for itself. I would recommend seeing this on a weekday, while the majority of the population is busy at work. The exhibit was overwhelmed by the audience on Saturday. Thursdays, the museum is open until 9 pm. That would give one more chance to see the Afghanistan Hidden Treasures in the evening, as the exhibit ends on January 25, 2009. \n\nHere's a preview: http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/06/afghan-treasures/barnes-photography\nAnd, of course, the expected one:  http://www.asianart.org/afghanistan.htm", "author": "David D."}

It was a rainy day, but I felt the weather gave the right kind of cozy atmosphere for venturing through a museum.\n\nThe Bhutan exhibit was intriguing to look at, although I did expect to find a lot more than there actually was. There were monks there as well, partaking in some of the live exhibits. I highly recommend visiting the Bhutan exhibit before it ends in May.\n\nAs for the rest of the museum: well, I had seen the exhibits before, but it was still refreshing and calming to walk through the exhibits and see history unfold from the top floor downward. It takes at least 2 hours to get through the whole exhibit, but that time spent is well worth it.\n\nI wouldn't recommend eating at the cafe inside since most of the food is heavily overpriced (then again, most museum food is overpriced).

The dancers were lovely and on point. However, with all of China present at the museum, it was loud and echoey throughout the small room. It's like the art world, became strollerville.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-02-05", "description": "I should warn you that this review will get a little 'curatorial'. I did museum studies stuff at grad school. For me, what impresses at museums and galleries is not normal. Visitor flow patterns, spotlight angles, the wording of labels... these are the things that excite me. \n \nThe basics: a great building. Airy and bright. The three story escalator ride is fun. The path through the galleries is direct, so there are none of those 'oh damn, did we miss a room?' sinking feelings. \n \nWhat I especially liked about the galleries in the AAM is that they are arranged to follow the spread of Buddhism through different geographic regions (South Asia, Southeast Asia, China, Korea, Japan). So often, museums are set up only to demonstrate \"this is everything we've got\". There's no concept beyond just showin' off some stuff. The overarching theme at the AAM brings meaning to the ordering of the galleries and to the display as a whole. (Yeah, admittedly, the theme crumbles a bit when we get to non-Buddhist Persia.) \n\nAn earlier Yelper commented that the South Asian display seemed a little drab and dusty next to the shiny, sparkly stuff from China. I understand the sentiment but I thought the South Asian statues were fascinating and more relateable to me than, say, vases and laquerware. My date's impression of the South Asian sculptures: \"Boobies! Boooobies!\"\n\nIn general, the way the objects are displayed has been well thought out. It's possible to stand quite close to the cabinets to admire tiny artifacts without blocking your own light. The wall of jade pieces in the China area was very effective - you can see both sides of the pieces and the dramatic lighting emphasizes the carved relief.\n\nOne thing that bugged me was that one modest-looking Chinese bronze box was described in its label as being the most significant piece in the museum because of a particular inscription carved on the back. The box was displayed in a way that hid this all-important inscription. Hey - if something is interesting enough to mention on the label, let it be visible to the visitor! Interpretation should guide the eye and the mind.\n\nI noticed that even after going through the whole building, I was not brought down by what I like to call 'museum drowse'. You know how it is: your eyes go hazy and your knees begin to buckle and you just can't look at another bronze Bodhisattva without collapsing into tears.... This did not happen to me at the AAM.

My hunch was not to visit yesterday but the Lords of the Samurai seemed right down my alley of interest. Unfortunately the museum turned out to be a classy version of K-Mart in terms of their inflexibility, rudeness and un-empowered workstaff.\n\nWe dropped in at 4p to catch the museum and discovered about 45 minutes later that the staff were annoyingly and frequently directing us to begin to exit for closure at 5p. The Lords of the Samurai exhibit is impressive -- if small -- but $34 for an hour is not time nor value for us to take it in well nor to see anything else in the museum -- which we had maybe an extra 10 minutes that we stole in spite of the rude staff.\n\nUnlike other quality museums we have visited, including San Fran's own deYoung that have the courteous policy to warn customers when one tries to buy a late-day ticket of the closure hours, or to offer discounted rates late in the day, according to the supervisor to whom we complained they have no policy to warn people of closure till after 4, and no discounts till 4:30. (We purchased at 3:55 and received no warning nor discount). There are no operating hours posted on the board at the desk where you buy tickets. They expected us to catch that on a single sign posted out on the steps at the front of the museum or to have come already informed. Perhaps a fair expectation, but unnecessarily unfriendly and inflexible.\n\nIn addition to the numerous rude watchstaff we found the staff at customer service desk unsympathetic and unempowered to address our complaint. \"Please fill out a comment card,\" was as much service as we received until I kept insisting on getting a partial refund. Eventually a supervisor came on the scene who was also unwilling to sympathise with and address our complaint, offering no apologies and just reiterating the policy the customer service person already gave. The best offer I eventually got was they were willing to apply our tickets toward the cost of purchasing an annual membership which, of course, had little value considering we're visiting from out of town.\n\nUnlike other museums that keep the gift store open for a little while longer if the normal exhibit hours are short, be advised that the whole lovely Asian Art Museum closes down promptly at 5 (except for Thursdays). And don't try to enjoy five or ten minutes longer.\n\nIt's always great to Yelp about a business whose policies, product and service exceed all expectations. In this regard the Asian Art Museum has policies that operate to remind me that I should expect no more than my own shortcoming to not notice the single operating hours sign standing on the steps out front.", "author": "Bryan J."}

You need the better part of a day to fully appreciate all that's here, and a return visit or two definitely is warranted. The interior is so warm and welcoming, the displays so beautifully arranged, that you'll want to pull up a bench and absorb the atmosphere rather than rush through.

Seriously, I would wager there's no larger, more navel baring collection of Buddha bellies anywhere in the Americas. Walking from level to level, you really get a sense that you're walking through time, walking through Asia and following the spread of Buddhism across Asia.\n\nI must mention that I found the informative plaques well written, easily digestible, and very educational. One gripe though: many of the Buddha statues are described as \"Buddha in a sitting position,\" or \"Buddha in a standing position.\" On one, a supplemental description even said something like, \"Buddha found in one of the five common positions.\" My god people, maybe I give humans too much credit, but if you expect me to be able to read, I expect am able to realize if a statue is standing or sitting...! And as for common positions, yes, I would expect there are very few statues in poses such as:\n\n-Buddha bowling\n-Buddha doing a keg stand\n-Avalokiteshvara, Buddha of Compassion, spread eagle\n-Kwannon doing laundry\n\nAnd even if there were such awesome statues, I don't think I would need the written description to figure them out. I can appreciate statuary on their knees at face value.\n\nMind you, it's not just Buddhas. There are Hindu boobies. There are Polynesian boobies. There are wooden ones, golden ones, even formerly golden ones --- worn down by the hands of ancient pilgrims waxing on, waxing off, I'm sure.\n\nThe new location is not as cool as the former. Parking is difficult, and the space seems smaller than the old space in the park. They fight this by trying to keep the space as open and airy as possible. Brightly colored walls, lots of glass and open rooms. It just feels too modern, when I'm looking at thousand year old boobies. I'm sure the curators would benefit from experience of other businesses where bevies of boobies are similarly displayed: dim the lights overall, to not distract from the main focus on the boobies, and add more spot lighting on each stellar pair. Oh, and maybe also a tip rail. Can I get change for a twenty? Singles, please.\n\nP.S. You can thank Andrea W. for reminding me about the boobies. ;)\n\nTIP!!

I've always preferred Asian art to the western stuff (not to mention Asian architecture and furniture), but of course they don't teach you jack about it in school, so what do I really know about it?  Basically, nothing.\n\nThe AAM definitely fills that void, with extensive and informative galleries of South Asian, Southeast Asian, Tibetan, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese art.  Bear in mind that much of it (particularly the South Asian gallery) is almost more of an archaeological museum than an art museum, with lots of 1000+ year-old statues and useful maps showing spreads of different religions and such.\n\nThe museum is \"paced\" pretty well--I was able to make it through the whole museum in 3 hours without it getting tedious.  But I could have easily spent more time in the section on Chinese ink-on-silk scroll art, particularly the landscape works inspired by the scenery of Huangshan Mountain.  That stuff is just WOW.  Also, I love how they have a room called \"Japanese Tea-Related Arts\".\n\nThere are also a couple of temporary exhibits on the first floor.  The exhibit on Tezuka Osamu is a must for anime fans.

To say I was blown away by what I saw would be an understatement. This exhibit turned me on to how artistic perfection can be applied to bamboo basket weaving near impossible to describe. How could anyone describe an incredibly tight-woven basket that looked like a wave? Or another that looked like a conch shell?

I know, I know, you are supposed to stare at the walls, not the floor.  But this one is special -  it's the one that's wood in very elongated small rectangles and polished to a warm dark shine.  I think it is the prettiest floor I have ever seen.  I must have that floor!\n\nThe building is wonderful too.  The exterior and structural details are Beaux-Arts style, while the interior is modern - designed by Gae Aulenti, the architect who did the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.  I love the idea of an Italian architect taking an existing American space and giving it an internal face-lift, then filling it with art from all over Asia.  You can either enjoy the large space and high ceilings of the main public areas, or spend some time up close with some beautiful art.  The Samsung Hall is particularly nice.\n\nI have seen some wonderful special exhibits here, including the Geisha exhibit, Tezuka:  the Marvel of Manga, and tonight, Stylized Sculpture: Contemporary Japanese Fashion from the Kyoto Costume Institute.  \n\nOn the first Thursday of each month, the museum hosts an event called MATCHA, and for $5.00 admission, you can enjoy the museum in the evening hours from 5-9.  Usually they have some kind of interactive event on the main floor, as well as a DJ in the Samsung Hall with videos and a bar.  Depending on the theme, it can be either very crowded or more sedate.\n\nWhat I usually come away with is not a huge impact of any one collection, but a quiet moment spent with a special piece.  Tonight that happened for me with one of the fossil displays in the Hiroshi Sugimoto:  History of History exhibit.  When art, or a found object, or a person's vision speaks to you...that is the essence of why we have culture.", "author": "Liz S."}

Climb the marble staircase up to the Loggia; walk around reading the wise quotes carved high above the columns and windows.\n3.  Check out the South Asian galleries on the third floor, where you'll learn about the origins of Buddhism and see some giant statues.  Some of the giant statues have large boobies.  This may/may not make you laugh depending on your maturity level.\n4. Go to the second floor for Japanese Paintings & Screens, Tea-Related Arts, and this itty bitty little carriage that noble people used to have servants carry them around in.

I studied art history in school and I have a deep affection for the arts. That said, I believe that the Asian Art Museum is less about art and more about anthropology. It's a fine line between art and anthropology but honestly, how many jade pieces can you view without becoming completely bored? \n\nThe top three floors are dedicated to the Museum's permanent collection, much of which came from Albert Bender. It's a large collection of Asian antiquities, some are incredibly old and are worth it to see the handiwork. The collection of Hindi and Buddhist art is amazing. However with a majority of the Museum devoted to the permanent collection, it doesn't bode well for repeat viewers. Once you've seen the upstairs galleries, there really isn't too much of a need to go back. Trust me. I've been to the Museum four times for each of the four Asian art history classes I've taken and I can give the tour in my sleep. \n\nThe best part of the Museum is when there is a show on a contemporary Asian artist. There is some amazing artwork coming out of Asia right now and yet the Museum doesn't seem to notice. Where is Shazia Sikander? Xu Bing? The first floor galleries are hardly big enough to sustain a large show of contemporary Asian art and that's incredibly unfortunate. There aren't as many traveling or temporary exhibits here to warrant many return visits. \n\nIf you have a deep affection for older Asian arts, by all means come to the Asian Art Museum. If you're a fan of contemporary Asian art, you're better off going to the SFMOMA.", "author": "Jackie I."}

From the overall architecture of the building to the exhibit spaces, you will find a visit to this place both educational and engrossing.\r\n\r\nIt's not surprising that this building was, formerly, the San Francisco Public Library.  From one beneficial place to another, it transformed into a holding space for the majority of Avery Brundage's Asian art collection.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I highly recommend this place for both enrichment and research purposes.  I wrote a paper and the professor required photos to serve as a reference.  Since many museums do not allow picture taking, the Asian Art Museum's Registration Department was extremely helpful in providing high quality prints (there is a fee, of course).  However, the clarity, detail and care that goes into the prints is phenomenal.  \r\n\r\nThe museum store also includes reference material as well as beautiful gifts for the Asian Art lover in your life or just buy for yourself.

It's one of the only places where I can go and see artifacts from and learn about my culture's rich history in person. The other day I stopped by with some friends since we wanted to catch the Lords of the Samurai exhibit before it ended, and I'm glad we did, because I'd almost forgotten how awesome this place is.\n\nThe layout of the museum is constructed in a way that you kind of work your way chronically and regionally, starting from the third (top) floor in southern Asia and India and moving down through early and medieval China, Korea, and Japan before you arrive back on the first floor where the special exhibits are. It's a layout that works extremely well, and it kind of builds anticipation if you're looking forward to some of the latter stuff - my friends and I are all Chinese, so we were looking forward to seeing those particular galleries.\n\nI was a bit disappointed with the Lords of the Samurai exhibit actually. Considering it was an extra $5 it wasn't all that different from some of the things on display in the Japanese wing on the second floor, and there were far fewer artifacts than I actually imagined. It was nice to catch, but they really overhyped it with all the advertising. Since it's a special exhibition though I won't knock off stars.\n\nHaven't tried the cafe before (museum cafes usually seem overpriced anyway), but I can say that the gift shop is fairly nice. There's a large selection of books on a wide variety of Asian topics, many of which you can't find at a store like Borders or Barnes & Noble (though I'm sure Kinokuniya would have them). They do sell other interesting items, but naturally they're all fairly expensive. Don't know why anyone would expect differently.\n\nIf you've never been here before, it's well worth spending the entire day to go through the entire museum at your own pace. My friends and I had to hurry since the place was closing in two hours and we were paying for nearby parking which was moderately expensive ($3/hour), so we didn't have time to go about reading all the descriptions and historical information. It's a great place for any Asian to go and learn more about their culture.", "author": "Will C."}

Unfortunately the Museum staff made it a miserable experience. In room 1, I had my 2 year old toddler standing on my feet as I looked at exhibits and I was told my the security guy that I HAVE to hold my child's hand to be in the exhibit. Ok, I thought so I held his hand. Further along in the exhibit I was told again, please hold my son's hand as I was fumbling with my two hands to play their cassette that requires two hands to operate. He wasn't running around or anything just standing by my side. So I decided to head to my car and get the stroller. Enter room 2 where I was told that strollers had to stay outside. O.k. so I put it outside and just quickly carried my toddler (not screaming or crying or even misbehaving) through the exhibit. I didn;t even hear the cassette for fear of another person telling me to hold the child's hand. Enter room there where the security guard told me NO STROLLERS are allowed in the museum. What? This time I was starting to get irritated. I asked them to show me in writing where it says strollers are not allowed. Five minutes later the security guy says that my purse has to be on one shoulder, I can't wear it backpack style. I'm carrying a toddler, two cassette thingies, two headsets, a program and carrying the unwanted stroller int he other hand. If I had a china plate to spin on my head, I could be an exhibit too.

There are 3 levels, starting at the top it goes from Indian to South East Asian (Thailand, Burma, Vietnam, etc) then into Tiebet, Laos, and on the second floor it is Chinese, Japanese and Korean. On the ground floor is where the special exhibits are (they change so this time is was a special on Japanese folding screens) and the gift shop and cafe. You can spend many hours here taking in the amazing sculptures, paintings, garments and ceramics. Some countries sections are small like the Filippines and Korea but I believe it's do to the fact that the museum hasn't been able to really start a real collection of those cultures artwork not because of any negative reasons. I'm an art history major so I know when artifacts go up for sale or auction, many museums (and private collectors) all over the world fight to purchase and display them...specially if it's a rare item. I def. recommended this museum!!\n\nStudents get discount with Student ID and there's probably AAA discounts too! :-)\n\nAlso, for those that were complaining that the pieces were too small, SERIOUSLY imagine being back in those times trying to carve such an intricate battle scene with warriors, animals, plants and celestial beings onto a 5\" piece of ivory.

Fortunately, as fate would have it, I BART-ed it up to the city a few Thursdays ago to pick up something, and decided to not waste the trip. Here's how it all went down...\n\nI noticed a few banners featuring the Asian Art Museum throughout the city, and on a whim, decided to look up the address and directions on my iPhone.  It was only a 20 minute walk from where I was (somewhere along Market St.), so I decided to carpe the diem.\n\nOnce I reached my destination, a sense of excitement came over me. I felt like a kid on a field trip, minus the darn worksheets you have to fill out so the teacher knows you are \"learning\" something. Which by the way, in my opinion is not the most effective means of exploring and appreciating a museum. \n\nThe museum has 3 floors and the visitors guide map leads you throughout the museum, starting on the 3rd floor and working your way downward. If you follow the route suggested, the museum tells a beautiful story of some of the oldest cultures in the world and how each of the individual culture featured in someway influenced one another and how those integrated cultures were an influence around the world.\n\nThe museum features art from India, China, Thailand, Japan, the PI, and Korea, to name the few countries. Though I won't go into detail about the exhibits, what I will say is this...There is so much to experience, read and enjoy in this museum. I could literally spend the entire day there and still feel like I did not fully take in all this museum has to offer. I didn't get a chance to really appreciate the Bhutan exhibit because I did not realize that there were multiple rooms dedicated to the art of Bhutan. What I did enjoy was the \"live art\" exhibit of the monks focusing on various form of art, be it music or mandalas.\n\nSince this is a museum, I was expecting a variety of people to visit. I was not disappointed. There were college students, sketching notable piece, older folk enjoying a leisurely stroll amongst antiques from their native countries, museum members enjoy the new editions to the museum, and oh yes, i mustn't forget the field trip kids. \n\nWow, I don't ever remember being that rowdy in a museum before, when I was a kid. \n\nI have to say, the kids kind of ruined my day of solitary artistic enjoyment with their loud and sometimes \"off-colored\" comments and questions, trying to fill out their worksheets and leave as quickly as possible. I was saddened by this sight. The kids were so focused on trying to find \"the answer to question 5a\" instead of actually looking at the exhibits and really trying to learn a thing or two about different cultures.\n\nAll in all it was totally worth the $12, and I can't wait to experience the Samurai exhibit coming in June.", "author": "A.

However, the pieces were all in it's original Japanese context with no English translation to help auteurs understand what they're seeing. I enjoy seeing the Astroboy statue, it reminded me of the giant Col. Sanders statue that greets people in front of KFC back in Tokyo.  A definite camera catch moment.\n\nThere are tons to see and I really like the layout of the artwork in accordance to each country. Don't miss the traditional ocha tatami room. If only everyone could step inside to get a feel for Japan.

Parking may be difficult as there is no parking structure nearby, but I've never had an issue finding a spot.\nThe museum is located right across from City Hall and from the outside is just a gorgeous building. The cost of admission is pretty cheap considering how expansive it is on the inside.\nThe art aside, the building on the inside is just breathtaking. \nThe exhibits displayed are expansive and very impressive. Their traveling exhibits are always gorgeous. Having just returned from a trip to Bhutan earlier this year, I can say the pieces exhibited currently are truly indicative of the gorgeous culture from the country.\nThe permanent exhibits are displayed in a breathtaking and organized manner. When you walk through you don't realize how far you've gone because the art just leads you around. Luckily there are quite a few couches so when your feet do start to ache you can sit and relax and admire the ancient works of the far East.\nThe cafe is a little expensive but I really enjoy it. Especially the green papaya salad. yum!\nIt's always a thrill to visit. I highly recommend it.", "author": "prachi v."}

I enjoy seeing it occasionally, but I really don't appreciate it the way a studious art lover views art.  In fact, had I not had free admission through my employer which donates money to the place, I might not have gone.  But having visited finally, I must say I was impressed.  There's a lot of interesting and varying items at this museum, including a ton of Buddhas both skinny and fat.  My favorite is the one with 11 heads.  The pieces are arranged very nicely and the lighting almost everywhere is excellent, allowing you to see from many different angles in great detail.  The glass casings were immaculate.  Many times, it was so clear that I thought there was no glass, so they must use some fingerprint resistant stuff.  I appreciated that every single item was labeled clearly with probably 90% having long detailed analysis of how it was made and what significance it had to the culture or how it was used.  Too much to see in one day.  We saw the first two floors in detail and then blew through the 3rd, which actually is the main collection.  The buiding is cool.  Security seemed more serious that at MOMA but were very nice.  Open late Thurs.", "author": "Marc S."}

I became surrounded by splashes of color of unique material and achievements of Asian art and culture. Along with the broad range of various paintings other key elements caught my eye as well such as sculptures, textiles, ceramics, and even precious jade molded into many different objects. Within the museum there was so much diversity from Asia colliding together to celebrate the artistic achievements of the Asian community. The one painting that captured my attention was called the sparrow bamboo done with ink and color mounted on paper by the accomplished artist Chao- Shao-ang (1905-1998). When I first saw the painting the colors of the lonely bird was the first thing that caught my attention. I believe that he is trying to convey a natural feeling of deep sorrow and grief towards his audience. His careful brush strokes are also dark on one hand, while the bird is sadly looking away into the midst of the air from the branch he is sitting on. However, the one unique exhibit that I was blown away was the creative work by artist Zhan Wang ultimately created to mount the city of San Francisco out of steel silverware! I couldn't believe it because at first my friend and I were uncertain of why there was a pile of stainless steel pots and pans, silverware, and mirrored surfaces lying on the ground. But until the security guard explained to us about the unique idea Zhan Wang came up with, we started to see the resemblance of the Golden Gate Bridge, twin peaks, embarcadero and other well known monuments that drastically came alive. In conclusion, I enjoyed going to the Asian Art museum because it helped open my eyes and gain a new perspective towards different structures of art", "author": "leanna w."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-05-28", "description": "It is a toss up for me between this one and the Legion of Honor as far as SF art museums go but I appreciate this one a bit more for a few reasons.\n\nFirst off, the pieces found here are not nearly as widely available for viewing as the more popular European art pieces. Many of the specific collections are the largest outside of their respective regions, meaning you can't find a more extensive collection without visiting the country itself or region to which it belongs. More importantly, my first visit to this museum really inspired me to seek out other and all varieties of museums and cultural centers whenever I travel and even when back home in LA. And on a personal note, this particular collection provides a great lesson and opportunity to learn more about my culture and ancestry while marveling at some of the most unique and aesthetic works of art in the world. Calligraphy, manuscripts, Buddahs of all shapes, sizes and colors, samurai swords, ceramic stonewares, elaborate metallic work, intricate textiles, Chinese jade, and snuff bottles are just some examples peculiar to the Asian Art museum that distinguish this museum from so many others. There is plenty more to discern than just paintings and sketches. Their collection even includes some contemporary art. A MUST SEE for those who appreciate Asian history, or fine art in general.", "author": "Cat L."}

Everybody said, \"That ol' thang?\" Call me crazy, but there was something about the Golden Gate Park location, the musty scent of the earthquake endangered structure,  it's intimate and local feel, it's ........AND THEN I WOKE UP! Well the little ol' museum in the park went and grew itself up, to become a world class city museum, located at the center of  SF government and next to the new Main Library. Hooray!\r\n\r\nSaving parts of the Old Main Library was probably the smartest thing the architects did, next to creating a structure that retains an intimate open feel, allowing for lots of natural light. It is an elegant and grand structure without being imposing. Word!\r\n\r\nThe Asian does it's fair share of community outreach: story telling, a teachers program, a number of family programs, not to mention ..Monsoon and Art After Hours (though that may have been done away with). The Cafe is great  place to meet that \"never on time friend\" before touring the collection. The art itself is amazing. The Avery Brundage Collection is always a treat: I mean this guy had taste ... or hired people who had taste to make sure everyone knew he had taste. They've got an incredible Jade Collection; Thai paintings; Chinese Scroll works & porcelain; Korean paintings, ceramics and traditional \"Hanboks\"; South Asian sculpture; Japanese ....(taking a breath here)  everything...Ok suffering from \"kid in the candy store\" syndrome. All of Asia seems to be well represented, but that's an amateur's perspective. It's all incredible! One personal mystery: there was a wonderful ivory piece called the Basket Seller that was part of the Brundage collection, which illustrated the affects of the Meiji period social reforms upon the former warrior class. It was cool! I know...y'all think J-Boy's gone all \"Kill Bill\" on yer asses!  This place is worth the price of admission.  The temptations of the museum store rival that of MOMA's.  4 duckets for an incredible place to view the best in Asian Art.", "author": "Johnny C."}

Was hoping to see more items from Southeast Asia (Thailand/Burma/Philippines/Indonesia/Malaysia, etc.), but hopefully the collection will grow in time. The information kiosks come in handy and help explain a lot. The bookstore has a pretty cool array of gift items and yeah..books. It's the perfect and ideal place to lose yourself on a weekend afternoon.", "author": "Chris C."}

The lighting, background fabric and the little glass display case where you can see both sides of some of the pieces is a really nice touch.\nThe architectural details that were retained from the old main library.\nThe floors!  Oh my!  The stone ground granite floors in the lobby, the little chunks of dark wood in the show areas.  I wish I can afford to put that in my home.  They're gorgeous.\nSamsung Hall - the space.  It's just a great gathering space with the old corinthian columns, etc.\nThe Japanese tea house.  I have yet to join in with one of the tea ceremonies, but plan to soon.\nThe contemplation space with the reflective pool of water, a bench, and not much else.\nOn the rare occasions that I was able to visit - the Peterson Room.  The furnishing in there are elegant, simple but comfortable.  The little garden area outside is a true urban oasis.\nThe cafeteria actually serves pretty good food.  They're not cheap, but quite yummy.\n\nDislike:\nSamsung Hall - the name.  Ok.  I know they're a corporate sponsor and donated a lot of money to make this museum happen ... but it's just a little too ... commercial.\nThe little glass addition with the escalators.  It's supposed to give the museum a lot of natural light.  It does that, but with a little glass chunk hanging out from the outside, it just doesn't fit into the rest of the building.

They're a very interesting fusion of far east and Mediterranean styles.  \n\nI only saw portions of the rest of the exhbits, and sort of whizzed through them due to lack of time, but there were many beautiful pieces.

For example, I was in Tokyo recently, and in a similar type of museum there (in Ueno Park) which specialized in Japanese art and artifacts, there were probably four or five rooms devoted just to samurai artifacts.  At the Asian Art Museum, samurai artifacts covered maybe a quarter of a room.

Nevertheless, the quality of the collections is great, and they also have very interesting temporary exhibits: I remember really enjoying an exhibit about a year ago on Chinese painting and calligraphy, called \"The elegant gathering\" after the Chinese name for the gathering at scholar at which a lot of the works exposed were created.

The AASF is a beautiful museum, with a solid exhibit base. But what a disappointment when we visited the Ming Dynasty exhibit a couple of weeks ago! We had planned for a month to visit it. We showed up in anticipation on a Thursday night, paid our $5 (which we were very happy about), ate dinner in the cafe (they were out of the first 2 entrees I wanted), and stepped to the customer service counter. \"Hello, we would like to rent the handsets to view the Ming Dynasty exhibit\". \"Oh, no\", she replied, \"we don't have handsets for that exhibit\". \"Excuse me?\". \"No, we can't afford them, since it's just a temporary exhibit. We only have them for our permanent exhibit\".  !!!!  A premier exhibit in a notable museum, and you can't afford handsets for a self-guided tour?!! Can we say, Get it done?!! We viewed the exhibits, with plenty of other attendees. Yes, they had docent tours, and if I was willing to be standing 4 people deep trying to hear what the docent was saying as she/he pointed to the item which I could not see, that may have worked. But it didn't. So we read the little plaques on the glass cases and muddled through. We were done in 45 minutes. \nI have always been so grateful for the handsets and headsets rentable or provided in other museums, from the Treasures of the Vatican exhiibit in New Orleans in the 1980s, to the Friday to the Frida Kahlo exhibit at MOMA recently, and it makes a HUGE difference for me. I'm art-challenged, and the equipment gives me the perspective I need to appreciate what I'm seeing. So, the Ming Dynasty exhibit was okay, to me. Old stuff. Pretty.\nI tried to send a comment to the Museum the next day, on their website. Maybe I'm blind, but I couldn't find anyplace to send a comment, or write to the Curator, or any email contact for feedback.

Over the years, many exhibits have graced the halls of  the AAM in GG Park. The remodeled site where the old Main Library used to reside, has served the new AAM well for the past 5 years. From the entryway, it still feels like the old library where going down the stairs leads to the newspaper room Those stairs are no longer there, even the wide staircase leading up to the library has vanished.  The interior was completely gutted and is replaced by a modern and well-lit museum.  We came specifically for the Ming exhibit which didn't disappoint.  Afterwards, we roamed the new museum and I recognized many old friends from my childhood.  I especially appreciate the new display for the ancient nephrite pieces from the Warring States.  Many pieces in the Jade Room are mounted in a clear case as if suspended from air where you can see both sides of the pieces and a legend with brief info on each piece.  What a great place to spend the day!  The gift sholp is small and has a limited book selection. What I did learn was that an older book on the collection of Avery Brundage was discarded and discounted, and a new publication came out last year in hardbound.  Evidently, a few pieces from the AB collection was determined to be unauthentic and replicas.  We've seen the Asian Arts collection at the British Museum which is significantly larger and should not be missed if you are ever in London.", "author": "Ry T."}

Of the 4, I am probably more impressed by the Asian Art Museum.  In addition to what I consider a very wide and diverse collection, I am glad that almost each piece of art has a detailed explanatory plaque.  The Egyptian Museum has this and I find such plaques to be indispensible to the learning process.  For the Asian Art Museum, the plaques regarding various interpretations of statues of Buddha, for example, to be wonderfully informative as the specifics of a Buddha statue from, say, Japan in 1100 a.d. differs quite a bit from a Cambodian statue of Buddha from 1300 a.d.  Paintings and art pieces at the De Young and Legion of Honor often have almost no accompanying materials unless the pieces art part of a special exhibition.  In the Asian Art Museum, my favorite permanent piece is the bookshelf wall of dozens of jars from many various countires over the course of centuries.  It's a fabulous piece of condensed history. ...The special Exhibition on display I saw was Drama and Desire, primarily Japanese pen on silk drawings from 1600-1750 regarding the theater and prostitution districts.  Very detailed plaques about the astonishing differences and meaning in hairstyles, types of brushes, sashes etc.  Yes, there were also many erotic drawings.  Interesting that we here in the West apparently could not even show these in a Museum until now.  Overall, our three hours here were wonderful and we plan to go back soon, and I have recommended this museum to many others.", "author": "Richard W."}

I've only been to small  museums before so I thought 2 hrs would be plenty of time to see everything!  Wrong I was.  There's 3 stories!  You can spend an entire day at this museum.  I basically ran through the museum at the end since I was pressed for time.  I learned a lot while I was there and completly amazed.  My friend that I brought with me was very disappointed in the Korean section, she was expecting more.", "author": "Gita W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-27", "description": "This museum has great Asian Art Collections. I have been collecting Asian Antiques for about 10 years. I thought I have known a lot about Asian Antiques, but I was surprised that I still have a lot of Asian Art I do not know. I know it is not appropriate to write here, but I recently found a great shop on Grant Ave. called Asia Galleries. I saw a lot of similar pieces that  this museum has at their store.", "author": "Antique C."}
