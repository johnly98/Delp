As soon as our 1st party arrives, before our reservation time of 8:15pm, the Mgr. approached twice to rush the only party of our group to put in our order and says the kitchen closes at 8:15pm. Open Table had reservations available up to 9pm. If I know I would be eating in a rush, I would not have come here. I've been a long time customer of Crustacean and I've seen it gone down. The restaurant was barely 15% full. No host was at the front desk. I had to walk into the dining room to look for my party. All their staff just looks at me but no one offered to help me while I searched for my party. Eventually I found them but took at least a few minutes of walking throughout their restaurant. \n\nOur servers were attentive and helped to make sure our party's needs were met.\n\nAlthough the Mgr. thanked us to dine at Crustacean, but the rush was not something I had expected. The garlic noodles were meh.  Looks like it wasn't prepared like how it used to be done.  Plus, there was a whole 1/3 bowl of butter soaking the noodles. I think that's excessive in comparison to how it was normally prepared in the past. Crab was alright. The Seabass was a tad fishy.\n\nThanh Long still kept their cooking consistently. I was at that location 2 months ago to celebrate my birthday and hands down, it as worth going to the outer sunset location for better tasting food than Crustacean. Thanh Long was a packed house on a weekday.", "author": "Betty L."}

I think for what you get the price is expensive. I ordered the roasted crab with garlic which was pretty exquisite but for how big the crab is there was very little meat and a lot of effort. If you are not about cracking your own crabs you can ask them to do it for you. The crab Price was not listed on the menu and for us it turned out to be $70. I highly recommend that you get the crab as well as the garlic noodles. The garlic noodles were a great balance to the crab instead of just getting plain rice. I probably will not come back to this restaurant for a long time because it is pricey but for a special occasion I think it might be worth it. The food came out in a timely manner as well.\n\nSERVICE.\nAs soon as we were seated around 7:30 PM on a Tuesday the server proceeded to tell us that we had less than 15 minutes to figure out what we wanted to order because the kitchen was closing at 8:30 PM. I was a former server so I understand that the owner may want to close on the restaurant if there are not that many customers that night but the way that the server message this was inappropriate and caused my guess to have anxiety around what they wanted to order. Throughout the entire dinner everyone was nervously eating because we didn't want to make the restaurant wait for us as we were enjoying our food. I would not have tipped the server as much as that I did but gratuity was already included with our bill. That being said it it was just one server that we did not feel did his job well everyone else including the kitchen were very accommodating and polite. The review would have had four stars if the service was better.", "author": "Eunice Y."}

The service and food was really good. We started out with a bunch of appetizers... the mussels, coconut shrimp, lobster roll, papaya salad, and Asian soup. The appetizers were fine but the coconut shrimp was very very good. The lobster rolls were a bit of a disappointment since they were more like spring rolls. \n\nIn terms of mains, we got the roasted crab, garlic noodle, and garlic rice. The crab and noodle does not taste as decadent as ppq... but the crab was sweet and tender (tends to be more dry at ppq but also more flavorful.) I like that the crab had garlic and freshly cracked pepper on it. The garlic noodles were very delicate. However, I actually really really liked the garlic rice. \n\nFor dessert we got the sorbet and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Both were excellent. While I still like ppq better, this place is definitely more high end and the food is very comparable. It is slightly more expensive than ppq as well but it is also more respectable to bring out of town guest.", "author": "Jocelyn K."}

My excitement got me a tour with a personal guide around the restaurant. There's a full bar. BUT SERIOUSLY, WHY THE HELL DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG TO COME HERE ?!\n\nThe price is insane. For 2 of us, we ordered 2 appetizers (mussels and calamari), 1 roasted crab, 1 garlic noodles and 3 orders of coke, the bill $150. Their coke is from the tap, as in it is not from a can/bottle that we have. Hence, their soda is very watered down + there is a ton of ice. So, to me, everything on the bill was totally WORTH IT except for the cokes. \n\nGET THE NEW ENGLAND MUSSELS! Just trust me and get it. It is sooooo soooo wonderful. The crab itself is HUGE, really good to share with 1 or 2 other people. Ask for gloves if you don't want to get down and dirty. They provide the customers with really good quality gloves, like the ones doctors/dentists use. Not the clear plastic flimsy ones at crawfish places.

The host let us choose where we wanted to sit which was nice. We got to sit in the booth which is my favorite type of table. \n\nFood: \nI didn't realize this place was a Vietnamese/American fusion restaurant until I opened the menu and saw \"Traditional Vietnamese Salad\" lol. So of course I had to get the salad. \n\nSalad - 3 out of 5. It can be better given that it was mostly just the papaya shreds and didn't have the other veggies that other Vietnamese restaurant has. Nuoc mam was on point though. \n\nRoyal Tiger Prawn - 4 out of 5. The noodles were their house garlic noodle (An's garlic noodles) which were sooo good. It could've used a little less butter but still good. The prawns were nicely cooked/grilled but prawns are prawns (I can't really tell the difference between good and bad ones). I just liked that they were well cooked. \n\nRoasted crab - 4 out of 5. My boyfriend really liked the flavor of it. It was seasoned nicely and the sauce went very well with the crab. We normally eat crabs with lemon and pepper to get rid of the \"fishy\" taste but they were able to mask that with just garlic and butter. \n\nLychee Martini - 4 out of 5. This drink was STRONG. There is a slight lychee taste but it was mostly alchie (which I'm not complaining because more bang for my buck). \n\nOverall: \nI give this place a 3 out of 5 because the service was slow even though they weren't busy. It is also pricey for the simplicity of the food and you can definitely find a better seafood/garlic noodle place in the city. But it's worth a try if you are around the area.", "author": "Annie V."}

Here's why...\n\nIf something terrible happens to you, like a severe allergic reaction in the middle of dinner, the managers DGAF. I emailed once and called back 3x over the course of 2 months. Ken, the main manager I initially spoke with, does not return messages. Only Daniel was sort of able to help. At first, I wanted to see what they could do for me (maybe at least comp the appetizer that gave me an allergic reaction). At this point, it's super upsetting and I want the entire meal comped just because Ken is unprofessional and lacks service. It's about principles now.\n\nSo you're probably wondering -WTF why would a person with a shrimp allergy would eat at a seafood restaurant. Because I am 30 years old, absolutely love seafood and have lived with this specific allergy a majority of my life. After eating at countless seafood restaurants, this is the ONLY ONE I have experienced an unexpected allergic reaction. I know my body and what I can eat. I even eat shrimp sometimes because I like to live life on the edge. Cross contamination with shrimp is totally fine. Ingesting shrimp meat is what gives me hives all over my face and body. \n\nSo imagine we have 4 cocktails, 2 appetizers, garlic noodles and a whole crab. This dinner was not cheap nor was it too expensive. We are more than willing to pay. Even if both the Lobster Rolls and Vietnamese Carpaccio sucked, we won't ask to take it off the bill because we took that chance. Of course the crab is amazing. I will absolutely give credit where it's due. It is roasted in mounds of butter, garlic, sugar, pepper and chicken bouillon. But that is besides my point!\n\nApparently, the so called Lobster Rolls appetizer is not all lobster so if you have a shrimp allergy, beware! Even if you don't have a shrimp allergy, just don't order it. It is underwhelming and bland. It looks and tastes like ground imitation crab with fillers ... rolled in a won-ton wrapper and fried. But it's a secret family recipe so they can't tell you what's in it! They just kept denying no shrimp was in it... OKAYYYYY sure.", "author": "Sydney H."}

But it might easily change if the food is prepared or served a different way...or if it's just better quality.  I totally learned my lesson as I tore through that crab.

We were told it was big enough to share with another person but if you're really hungry, I would not recommend sharing. We were recommended to get the fried rice with shrimp but it wasn't anything special, tasted bland, and I regret not trying the garlic noodles many yelpers mentioned on their reviews. Our server was not very attentive and provided very very slow service. I did not like how our server said we could not split up our checks separately between 5 people and instead we had to calculate exactly how much to charge on each card. For it being an expensive place to eat at, that was ridiculous to even make us do that. On top of that, no one came to get our payments and exact amounts for about 25 minutes. Customer service is definitely lacking and being from out of town, it was a bad experience.", "author": "Rebecca L."}

Now they did allow me to call and change the timing of my reservations which was nice of them. So we got there had some time to kill ordered some drinks at the bar which were fairly priced but the bartender didn't seem like he was interested in serving us maybe because he had judged us? I'm not quite sure. The waitress was very friendly. We had a table of 9 and everyone ordered an appetizer to split per 2 and their entree. We had a drink or two each with dinner as well. I split the chicken and beef skewers which were both AMAZING. Perfectly cooked meat which had such a distinct flavor. Highly recommend this appetizer. My entree I got th jumbo garlic prawns with garlic noodles. The entree was the most popular throughout our table as 5 people got it. It was amazing, the garlic noodles were delicious. Overall the food was absolutely amazing. Now I have been to many restaurants before, for the portions of these plates and what kind of food we ordered they deff jack up their prices due to the celebrities/popularity of the garlic noodles which is why it is getting 3 Stars.

Reservations were plentiful and the dining room was empty.\n\nThe lunch wait staff here was weird. A man and a woman, in particular, were strange. They spoke to us in a strange cadence, kept trying to clear our table, and moreso, impeded on our dining experience. In addition, our dining patrons to the next table over were disgusting - they belched loudly, left food on the floor, and made a ruckus - which of course, is something the restaurant doesn't have control over, but still, gross.\n\nThe Crustacean shrimp toast was good but definitely not the $12 dollar price tag. You get three freaking tiny pieces of toast. What the heck?! It was good, but not memorable and definitely not worth $12 bucks.\n\nWe ordered the the roast crab ($55) + garlic noodles ($12). It was super, super oily. Everything was enveloped in oil. The crab was marinated in oil + garlic. There was little to be desired.

The trick is to order one crab for your party of two, and then when you're almost done with the first one, order the next crab so it's piping hot when you're ready.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-28", "description": "All Seafood Lovers, aboard the Crustacean train!!!\n\nInitially, I am very impressed that there's a fancy Vietnamese fusion restaurant #wevecomealongway Because most Viet shops are casual with notoriously infamous service. Crustacean, pretty good foods, great variety...but minus the expected attentive excellent service. The terrible service impressed more upon me than the food itself, which albeit was mediocre.\n\n[[BACKGROUND]]\nMy friend had a surprise birthday dinner here and there were 11 of us. Our party made previous reservation and hopped up to the third floor of a dilapidated building. Inside, the restaurant layout was confusing. It seemed to be a weird loop with random stairs and levels and walls around. Luckily, I went to the back of the restaurant and saw my party. \n\n[[SERVICE]]\nForewarned, if you have a large group, 18% gratuity tip is automatically added to your bill. This is normal and expected, but failing service is not. Our server seemed frenzied, unorganized, aloof, and just entirely not there. The other employees were friendly but also seemed overwhelmed at the same time. A few instances, we requested lemon that never came and I requested a regular water cup 3x and that never came either...Seems to be a trend that requests go unanswered. I had to steal my friend's water cup and once in a while, the servers would come around to refill towards the end of our experience.\n\nThey also were missing a crab order and we had to flag them down to bring out another Roasted Crab. When my friend asked for the check, the server told her to just wait cause she had other things to do. I just don't get why doesn't she say \"Ok\" and be on her merry way. What other things do you have to do? Serve?...Apparently not tonight. It was my first time and my friends' first time experiencing such nonchalant, apathetic service at Crustacean and that's an awful shame. \n\n[[FOODS]]\nFood? We ordered the following: Fried Calamari, Papaya Salad with Shrimp, Vietnamese Carpaccio, Seafood Cakes, Roasted Crab, Tamarind Crab, Garlic Noodles, Butterfly Prawns, and a ton of desserts. Notably, the calamari was AMAZING! If you love squid as much as I do,  order it. The seasoning was flavorful with a peppery kick! The breading was also light and crisp, however it came out lukewarm. I suspect they made it a while ago but the server did not bring it out until way later. \n\nThe crabs themselves were okay, mediocre at best. The crab meats were not juicy, moist, or flavorful. It's like they boiled it too long and some of the ends shriveled and browned. Roasted is more savory and umami, and oddly, Tamarind was sweeter and lightly flavored. In my previous experience, tamarind crab is supposed to be salty and savory so I was perplexed by this course. However, the An Garlic Noodles are THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Yasss queen! It was so garlicy, soft, and supple. I could've eaten a whole plate by myself haha. Honestly, the crab was an accompaniment to the great garlic noodles entree for my dinner. \n\nOverall, a sad 3 stars I have to give for the terrible service, mediocre food/preparation, and odd ambiance/location. I'm sure they've had better days but today was just not it.", "author": "Donna T."}

Not in the mood for crab? Look elsewhere to satisfy your seafood cravings.\n\nI made reservations for two for a Friday night via Yelp reservations. Everything worked out perfectly. We really didn't need reservations though. We went around 9pm and there was plenty of tables available. Ambiance was a little old school, classy. I felt like I had stepped back to the 90s. Service was okay, nothing amazing. My friend ordered extra sauce with her crab, and they never brought it despite asking the wait staff twice. I had to flag a waiter down for more water. I tried the halibut, and let me just say that I am not picky with my fish, but it was not good. The flavor of the sauce just didn't pair well with the fish, and the fish itself was overcooked and dry, which is the worst thing you can do to fish. My friend really enjoyed her roasted garlic crab. Of course we had to try their famous garlic noodles. Those were really tasty and flavorful. They were probably the highlight of the meal for me. Dinner was pricey at just over $120 for two people.

Vietnamese food has always been challenging for me, as I have always needed the help of friends for a high quality Vietnamese meal.  As a true Marylander I have always wanted to visit one of Helene An's California Crustacean institutions.  I am hoping that they return to Las Vegas one day.  I loved meeting my wonderful CAL friends OD alums of CAL Berkeley and Houston.  NYC is not a town where people love crabs like my beloved state of Maryland.  We had the classic dishes last night: roasted Dungeness crab, garlic noodles, and Shaken Beef.  The Dungeness crab rivals R&G's legendary salt n pepper Dungeness crab.  The garlic taste to the crab gives it a divine flavor, but certainly messy for your hands--you cannot have a great crab meal without bibs and some real work. I loved the simple garlic noodles, and the flavorful shaken beer also.   Very few places exceed my expectations today.  However, Crustacean serves up a powerful meal, in a simplistic, family-style.  It certainly is not cheap, but then again this is San Francisco where many of my favorite restaurants reside.  If you come to Crustacean and you are a true crab lover you will have quite an experience.  So if you are an Asian crab lover you must make a visit here.  If you have a group of friends who just want to spend some quality time ripping apart some Dungeness crabs--It does not get any better than this.  Crabs Baby!!!", "author": "Thomas W."}

Any time they are here, we always go out for something they can't easily get back at home. Remembering we had dungeness crab last time, I suggested we do the same thing. Since I'd never been to Crustacean, I figured I could also check a place off my list. I called a couple days before and made a reservation for 4 for Tuesday, March 8th at 7:30pm.\n\n*Crispy Rice Paper Roll: filled with chicken, mushrooms, carrots, mint and vermicelli, served with daikon cole-slaw ($8.95)\n*Grilled Calamari: marinated in a savory peanut-mustard sauce ($11.75)\n*The Roast Crab: an entire dungeness crab roasted with garlic and spices ($53.95) \u00d72\n*An's Garlic Noodles: egg noodles infused with An's famous garlic sauce ($11.50) \u00d72\n\nThe appetizers were okay. The only reason we ordered them was because I figured we should try some dishes other than just crab and garlic noodles. The imperial rolls were hot and crunchy, although it was kind of a small serving. I actually really liked the slaw that came with it. The grilled calamari were just eh. For some reason, I thought it was going to be fried even though the description clearly says grilled. I'm such an airhead sometimes. I didn't really care for the sauce as I'm not a big fan of peanuts, but the calamari was tender.\n\nThe stars of the night were the crab and garlic noodles. I had a disappointing experience with Thanh Long's crab last time. This totally made up for it! The meat was sweet and tender. The sauce, nice and garlicky with a slight peppery kick. And the garlic noodles? Al dente with delicious garlicky flavor. I was in heaven! I was keeping it chill, so I just had one glass of Honig Sauvignon Blanc, Napa Valley, 2013 ($9.50). It paired well with the dishes we got.\n\nGreat place for crab and garlic noodles! Crustacean totally redeemed the lackluster House of An experience I had from Thanh Long.", "author": "Elena N."}

They said that the crab and garlic noodles were really delicious and so we came for those items in particular. I went with a group of five people so we got to try a lot of different things. My overall impression of this place is that its like a P.F. Chang's of crab and garlic noodles. By that, I mean the food is decent quality, but not decent enough quality to justify the prices. Also, there are other places where you can get similar things for much cheaper - I list them at the end of this review. This might be a good date place to take a date if you don't mind garlic breath from the noodles, wearing a bib, and getting crab juice all over your pants. I actually saw a decent amount of people who looked like they were on dates here.\n\nWe ordered the following items:\n- Lots of the garlic noodles\n- Prawns with garlic noodles (~$39.99)\n- Drunken crab (each crab was about ~$50)\n- Roasted crab\n- Seafood salad\n- Shaking beef\n- A vegetable and tofu dish\n\nThe garlic noodles were good, but at $10.95 per order, I was expecting something phenomenal. As far as the crab, I'd recommend the drunken crab over the roasted crab. The drunken crab was more flavorful. The crab was good, but I was also expecting phenomenal here. For a steamed crab, it was decent though. \n\nI would recommend the seafood salad, though for the price, I felt like they could have loaded up on the seafood a little more. The vegetable to seafood ratio wasn't great. The shaking beef was very good, I'd definitely recommend that dish - the beef was really tender and flavorful. And finally, the vegetable and tofu dish we got (I can't remember what it was called) was also good, but the price on this dish was also a little steep for what it was. This place must have an insane profit margin. \n\nIf you want good garlic noodles at a much cheaper price, check out Ben Tre in the Bay Area. You get a huge portion (with protein) for a much better price - I'm talking less than $20. Also, for better crab (but unhealthier cause it's deep fried), go to R&G lounge.

Crustacean, its more refined and polished big brother comes complete with slick interior, central location, and even a valet parking option. What this means is you can get more or less the same food you could order from Thanh Long but in a more upscale environment. \n\nNow that we've gotten these simple facts out of the way, there is something that bothers me as an individual who has frequented Thanh Long for many many years. I'm only speculating here but it distinctly feels like they've subtly altered their recipes for their garlic noodles and Roast crab in particular. More oily, less of the secret concoction of spices? All of the above? Maybe, either way, it feels diluted and less pure.\n\nIs Crustacean a nice change of pace dining option if all you've been familiar with is filet mignon and chicken cooked up 50 ways? Of course it is. However that magical exotic feeling I used to get coming to this family owned franchise feels as hollow as how I now feel about their core recipes.", "author": "Dennis W."}

Myself and 11 others decided on Crustaceans's for her special dinner. In all fairness the communication prior to our visit went smooth! The response time was minimal. The manager recommended that since there were so many we do a prix fix menu. It would include an appetizer and their famous garlic noodles and a crab for every person. I informed him that everyone would not be eating crab (including myself) and one of our party is vegetarian. In that case he stated those individuals could order off the menu. We arrived 30 minutes early. Elevator broken.... exterior in need of cleaning at minimum the windows. No problem. Waited at bar and had delicious cocktail!! Seated, and requested wine that we brought. Orders taken, appetizers brought out timely. Not many vegetarian choices so loud friend ordered rice and a bowl of veggies. Due to breakdown in communication waiter assumed the other half of the table all wanted crab. That was not the case . But ok. No big deal. Then came dinner. NOT AT ALL AS I REMEMBER! I ordered garlic shrimp. The noodles were dry and lacked flavor. They actually tasted sweet. The shrimp ...ehh. Nothing special. So dinner okay. Maybe I should have ordered the crab. The 9 that did were happy with it. Fast forward ..... Dinner finished..... server way to chatty. Jumped in our conversation a few times. Ok.. but didn't ask for his opinion. \nBill arrives!! $1100.00. Yikes!!!! So why?? I expected the crab to be 89.50 per person. But the shrimp, and \"vegetarian meal\" (steamed rice and veggies) the same price?? I was told because we agreed to prix fix menu. No way Jose!!!   The killer was that there was no manager on duty. They had to keep going in the back getting him on the phone supposedly. 30 minutes later they reduced the bill by 90.00. Okay.... lets just go.  We paid and left. \nReally what I'm trying to say is..... for $90.00 pp you can eat really good in a lot of places with impeccable service and desert. The experience was disappointing as was the food and service ..... most important my granddaughter was happy. \nDon't think I'll visit or recommend again.

Let me describe what $175 buy two people at Crusty Asian:\n\nSetting: The crowd mostly consisted of bigger parties who seemed to be out to celebrate. Happy Birthday was sung a few times, which gives you an idea of the classiness of the place. Call me a snob if you must, but for a place that claims to enforce a dress code \"in order to ensure a sophisticated experience\" this place attracts a decidedly NOT-upscale crowd. I'll leave it at that. Our table was in a heavily trafficked, very drafty location.\n\nAppetizers: The shrimp toast was tasty, but not as good as what you can get at any hole-in-the-wall dim sum place in Chinatown. The Vietnamese beef carpaccio was pretty flavorless. May I suggest the chef makes a quick trip to Yummy Yummy on Irving Street for an education. The secret is in the temperature of the meat and the amount of lemon juice.\n\nWine: For around $50 a nice Alsace Sylvaner. No complaints there except it arrived after our appetizers and was too warm. So I guess I do have complaints.\n\nEntree: The house specialties, the roast crab and garlic noodles. Both were fine and obviously the reason the place is relatively popular. Still, for $40 you get a pretty spectacular crab at most places and this was just good but not spectacular.\n\nDesserts: Bread pudding was great, the baked Alaska was served far too cold, but overall the dessert experience was passable for a bill worth half the amount.\n\nService: I already mentioned the poor timing of the wine service (which was repeated for the espresso) and overall the server was inattentive. And I mean that. He needed repetition of our order and it was only two of us. The only time he wasn't slow was when bringing the check - which arrived in the middle of dessert!\n\nOverall: Passable food, but way overpriced, service and atmosphere worthy of The Olive Garden.

Absolutely no meat at all underneath the shell. Also pretty much ruins date night because 1) there is no graceful way to suck crab legs and 2) the garlic sauce, although delicious, gives you major garlic breath. Plus, trying to break through the shell was hard work and messy. I don't remember the last time I had to work so hard while eating at a restaurant. The noodles were good but expensive.

The crab is huge, and we really enjoyed the long process of eating it. Don't be afraid to sit there with a bib sucking away at the claw- no shame. The roasted crab was by far more flavorful than the drunken crab. This crab is drenched in garlic, butter, and a ton of pepper. The flavor is infused into the crab and is just so good.\n\nDrunken Crab\nThe alternative to the roasted crab. This one is in a wine sauce with veggies. The broth is more delicate, so it just doesn't infuse into the crab the same way. I would recommend this one if you don't like strong flavors or prefer just the clean, fresh taste of crab on its own.\n\nGarlic Noodles\nWay overpriced at $10.95. The noodles don't have much presentation. It is literally a plate of noodles and all just one color. You could just get the garlic noodles at Yamo.

It's my cousins birthday and we decided that that's where we wanna eat. We arrive to the restaurant, get out to valet our car and right away we hear a man yelling from the top of the stairs telling us we can not park there and to hurry up or they won't service us. The whole time I'm looking at my cousin like wtf is going on and let the man know we we're there for dinner, and I need him to Valet my car and right away he gets in my car and starts moving my vehicle like it was a bumper car. I'm like nah you're not about to drive my car like that, you're gonna scrape my rims, those are 7k rims. He then tells me \"then you can go park it across the street,\" like wait, what?? Mind you it's a team of us looking to drop a check at this place and we're being told to hurry or we won't be served and to valet our own cars?? come to find out this is the owner who's handling us this way. He chose to right away act out soon as we pulled up. I don't understand where the hostility came from but I had to leave, for the sake of the two of us. This was racial profiling. We didn't do anything to receive such a hostile welcome; we we're looking to drop a dime and eat with my family & friends. Fuck this place, you don't treat people like that and then continue to antagonize them, that's you asking for shit to escalate.

They were a bit hard to eat as the wonton skin was very fragile. We got the calamari fried and it comes with onions and bell peppers. Some of the calamari had a bit too much pepper on it but overall it was delicious, especially with the sauce.\n\nTheir popular item is the Roast Crab which is an entire dinginess crab with garlic and spices. It has a nice flavor and the meat was juicy and tender. The butter on the plate flavors the crab well and isn't too overpowering. The crabs we got were a good size. The waiter told us many people order An's Garlic Noodles with the crab. The noodles were alright in comparison to the crab. It was just good as a side, not a meal even though it costs about $10.\n\nWe also ordered the Steamed Seabass. The sauce that surrounds the fish is delightful. I believe the sauce it comes with on the side that looks like butter is actually like a citrus sauce which gives it an interesting flavor. I prefer to eat it with the sauce that's surrounding the fish. They steam it well as the fish just falls apart nicely and the meat isn't chewy at all.\n\nWe got lucky and were seated when we came in. The atmosphere is nice. It looks pretty fancy but people here are dressed casually. The wait staff is fantastic and very attentive. There is about a 1.5 hour time limit but definitely enough time for a good meal.", "author": "Arianne C."}

I usually attend for Thanksgiving each year and this year was nothing different. We get the roast crab or two, the garlic noodles, and the snap peas for some crunch and color. All are excellent. I've been to PPQ but there is just something about Crustacean that feels higher quality and the service is definitely better, so I suggest this especially for special occasions. \nThis year we also had one of our favorite waiters, Philip. He is exceptional, with a great sense of humor and lots of knowledge about the food and drinks they have to offer.

We had a reservation at 7PM and when we arrived around 7:05PM (city traffic in union), we were told we needed to wait. (perhaps hiring another host would help speed up the process?) We were in no hurry so we didn't mind too much. \nWhen we were seated around 7:15 it took a while for us to get our host's attention. I had to make it clear at one point we were ready for some water and for our wine to be open. As the night progressed, so did our experience. The big parties made it difficult for our waiter which we can understand being in hospitality. As the night trickled on, he turned out to be amazing and attentive and we shared a taste of our wine with him.\nThe food was amazing per usual - garlic noodles and crab is a MUST. It is what we get every time. We had an order of crab wontons - those are a must as well. \n\nDefinitely a fun experience! If you're not too hungry, share a crab and a side of garlic noodles.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-04-25", "description": "I've been a San Francisco resident for over 25 years, and I've always wanted to try Crustacean. Well tonight, I had that opportunity and was looking forward to it. Unfortunately my excitement was met with a very disappointing culinary experience. This sentiment was shared by everyone in our party of six. I am going to be brief because the \"meh\" experience doesn't warrant a more expansive dissertation. Honestly, I wanted to give this a one star, but I don't want to be taken as a hater as I was genuinely looking forward to dining at Crustacean.\n\nAmbience--nice decor, but a bit tired\n\nFood--subpar and didn't hold a candle to many of the much more reasonably priced local Vietnamese restaurants throughout SF. We ordered their House Specialties which included the following:\n\n--Royal Tiger Prawns with Garlic--Four Prawns were anorexic and chewy (overcooked) not to mention a bit cold. They were filleted on a bed of unexpectedly bland garlic noodles. The noodles reminded me of a plate of spaghetti I could make at home mixed with butter and a pinch of garlic salt. \n\n--Roasted Crab--My table mates were hard-pressed to extract any meat from this house specialty. You'd do better at the numerous other crab joints in SF. The measly portion (lots of messy work for very little crab meat) was served on a plate of butter and the only redeeming aspect of this dish was that everything tastes good with butter.\n\n--Crab cakes--Served two crab cakes with a small salad garnishment. The crab cakes were flavorful, but the portions were on the small side especially given the price. \n\n--Calamari--like the crab cakes, this was the only other redeeming, somewhat satisfying dish we ordered. We order calamari whenever it's an appetizer on a menu as our kids love it. Crustacean's calamari was four out of five stars. It was cooked well and had just the right breading and texture (not overly soft and not too crispy). The thinly sliced red peppers and onions were a nice compliment to the calamari. The dipping sauce was tasty as well.\n\nService--Service was okay. Nothing to write home about, just okay. One noteworthy item is that they will bring out hot towels if you ask for them which is nice touch. However, the towels were scalding hot and were too hot to pick up. If this is typical, the servers should warn customers in advance as someone could easily burn themselves. We had our 93 year old great aunt with us and she grabbed towel to warm her cold hands and literally threw it back as she recoiled from the heat. \n\nPrice--$$$$$ way over-priced for what you get and the quality. I can enjoy a garlic noodles dish at our local Vietnamese restaurant that is immensely more flavorful and satisfying for less than half Crustacean's \"price upon request\" of $40. C'mon, $40 for a plate of butter spaghetti with four anorexic, cold prawns. Similarly, the Roasted Crab was $55. Crab of superior quality and quantity can be had for 50% to 60% of that price at many fine restaurants around town. The Crab Cakes were again twice the price for what you're getting...$27 for two small portion crab cakes. My oldest who loves crab cakes asked if we could go to In 'n Out afterwards.\n\nAll in all, I honestly don't know how this place stays in business as it was a very disappointing experience. Hopefully, Crustacean will take this review to heart and make improvements. It was a $300 bill for six people with no drinks except one beer, one coke and a cup of tea, and food that was for the most part, barring the calamari and crab cakes, very unsatisfying and left a lot to be desired. As a \"dining\" fisherman with expectations for a good \"catch\" today, this is one crustacean I'd throw back.", "author": "Lawson C."}

There's only 1 bathroom and 1 stall for the whole restaurant.  Are you serious!!!  Of course the women's bathroom is always a line. Stupid concept! \n\nLast note.  Put some money into fixing the crab sign outside the building. We wouldn't be able to tell that it's a restaurant. No sign beside a one claw crab light up sign.  \n\nSo experience was a failed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-19", "description": "Crustacean was one of the restaurants recommended to me for my 2015-April trip to San Francisco by friends who used to live in San Francisco. I'm always up for interesting eats, so the mystique of their having a \"Secret Kitchen\" where family recipes are prepared away from the prying eyes of \"outsider\" staff intrigued me. That, plus people raving about their garlic noodles. And Crustacean sounded like such an old family restaurant that I didn't think it merely a marketing gimmick. Certainly the one staff person I chanced to run into on my way up the stairs confirmed the Secret Kitchen protocol did in fact exist.\n\nFirst impressions of the place were good. The ma\u00eetre d' gave polished, professional service and was patient with noob questions. The restaurant is elevated over the street, giving you views of the city. The dining area is also tiered, so even if you are not sitting at a window, there's still the possibility of good views. The dim room of dark colours offered a nice retreat from the bright sun outside if you are dining early in the evening.\n\nMy reservation was for 5:30 PM and one of the first ones in the restaurant that Sunday evening. They are apparently supremely busy come sundown (the timing of which is therefore influenced by Daylight Savings Time adjustments). That, and if there is a convention in town.\n\nThe basic Roast Crab is one of the restaurant's original (and now Secret Kitchen) recipes; the Tamarind Crab and Drunken Crabs were added later. The \"extra time\" required for the crustacean recipes from the Secret Kitchen was estimated by the server to be just about 15 minutes more, though one should expect it to be even longer once the restaurant gets busy later in the evening starting around 7 PM.\n\nAs is my wont, I arrived early. The restaurant was basically empty. The protocol apparently was that I could wait seated at the bar, or I could wait in the lobby; either way, they would seat me once 2-3 persons had arrived. (Why?) Anyway, I complied, though eventually they did seat me alone. Of course during this time I did not idle, but perused the menu.\n\nOnce at the table, I started with a drink. They had non-alcoholic ginger beer. It was disaster (how can a restaurant mess up a bottled drink?). Once my friends arrived and our first appetizer orders showed up, they still hadn't redeemed themselves from this FAIL:\n\nGinger Beer ($6)\n- Tasted weak. The reason is probably because at least 2/3rds of my glass was ice cubes. I paid $4 for ice and $2 for maybe a 1/3rd of a glass of ginger beer that didn't taste anywhere as good as the four-pack I bought from Trader Joe's that cost less than $6.\n- Crustacean is a \"fancy restaurant\" and a popular one. I get that. I've eaten at even more posh or pretentious restaurants in Vancouver. But this much ice is disgusting for a $6 drink.\n\nMore detailed reviews of the 10 things we tried can't fit in the 5000 character limit here, but I've blogged it at http://lower-mainland-bc.blogspot.ca/2015/04/hit-and-miss-at-crustacean-restaurant.html  For the moment I'll just mention the Roast Crab:\n\nRoast Crab (\"quoted price\", for us it was $48.95)\n- Looked like a baked crab sitting in a pool of oil sprinkled liberally with pepper.\nI thought maybe the flavour here was in the oil (roasted with the crab?). I mixed some of the garlic noodles in that oil. Nope. Now my garlic noodles just tasted oily.\nAfter cracking open the leathery shell, the crab meat tasted like crab.\n- I even licked the shell for any flavour that might be crusted on (e.g., in the matter you would definitely lollipop the shell of a Singapore Style Chili Crab https://youtu.be/jrUpFdS74LI?t=8m16s ). Nope, no flavour to be savoured here.\n- Total waste of time (and money). Just get a crab from the market and steam it yourself and use whatever condiments you like.\n\nDespite a really lousy start with the $6 for ice with a splash of ginger beer plus a couple of dish duds, Crustacean would still get a passing score because:\n-Prices for many items are actually good. A great way to get a filling meal at a reasonable price is to share fried rice ($8) or garlic noodles ($10.95) and a main with a friend -- i.e., treat Crustacean like any other family style / for sharing Chinese restaurant and go with several people.\n- Items are hit and miss, but there are good items on the menu. Do not just go with the hype and order Secret Kitchen stuff.\n\nHowever, BEFORE the end of the meal -- BEFORE we had even finished dessert -- I got the bill. WTH? Sorry, points off for that. Including the debacle with the Ginger Beer, I am tempted to just give them 1 star.", "author": "Simon S."}

However I realize now that I'm an amateur. What self respecting foodie would admit that they'd never heard of Crustaceans!!!  Well folks that would be me!!\n\nMy wife and I went to San Francisco this past weekend with our son. I've always wanted to experience San Francisco food scene. Typical tourist traps like Fishermans Wharf was on my list of places to go to get some of that bay area seafood. A friend recommended that we bypass the \"Groto\" and instead go to Crustaceans. So we decided that this place would be our first stop. As it turned out the restaurant was on the opposite block of the hotel that we stayed in Nob Hill. \n\nWe arrived just after they opened for dinner so we didn't need a reservation. We were seated quickly and immediately were impressed by the atmosphere and ambiance. Although this is definitely an upscale restaurant it had a cozy relaxed feel to it. My wife and I were wearing jeans and my son had on shorts and a sweatshirt (typical SoCal teen attire).  Our waiter was a French gentleman who recommended some great appetizers and an awesome Chimay (I had a few of those).  \n\nWe ordered a crusted Ahi Tuna appetizer with a spicy sauce and garnish. Perfectly seasoned and seared!! It paired really well with the Chimay and the drink my wife ordered. \n\nFor my main course I ordered the staple of this restaurant,  Garlic Pepper Roasted Crab and their famous Garlic Noodles. My wife order the Tamarind Crab. My son ordered the stuffed calamari and rice. The food was prepared relatively quick and was brought out steaming hot. My mouth immediately began to water. Just the smell and presentations alone hand me spinning. \n\nLet me say this EMPHATICALLY....that Garlic Pepper roast crab was THE BEST CRAB I'VE EVER TASTED!  I'm from the south \"y'all\" so for me to make such a bold declaration isn't made lightly. I seriously spent the last few days scouring through my taste bud memory bank and I honestly can't remember EVER eating a crab and wanting to chew the shell also!!\nI tried my wife's crab and it was also delicious but no where close to that garlic-pepper-roasted-master crustacean-beauty!!\n\nI will be trying the restaurant in Beverly Hills real soon for comparison but honestly I don't think I can top this. If you are traveling to San Francisco you MUST go to Crustaceans in Nob Hill. You will not regret it. \n\nEat, Drink, and Be Safe!!", "author": "Roosevelt S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-12", "description": "Don't bother coming here.  The place is old and dirty, and generally the food lacks flavor.\n\nThat being said, the Roast Crab (market price--$48.95 tonight) is very well cooked--consistent through the entire thing, from the wider to the skinny parts.  The spice used for the Roast Crab consisted of garlic, butter, salt and pepper--nothing very tasty, but again, the crab is well-cooked.  Shaken Beef ($27) is also good, however it probably is not for everyone--it is cubed in the stir-fry of green beans and onions, and on the sweet side, similar to (but not as good as) Asian beef jerky--I like sweet, so I thought it was decent.  The Shaken Beef dish also came with 3 raw cherry tomatoes for color...odd plating since they could have easily put a few slices of orange or red bell pepper in the stir-fry instead.  The food also comes out very quickly, which was nice.\n\nPASS on the garlic noodles ($10.95).  I have no idea why people rave about this Crustacean version to this day--the noodles were mushy and in serious need of any kind of flavor.  I'm a carb/noodle lover, but these hyped up noodles fell far below expectations.  They needed more garlic.  They were very oily (not even buttery, which would have probably made them taste better).  You're better off having garlic noodles at literally any other place in SF--all other places we've tried have been on an entire other level compared to this one (Chubby Noodle, Perilla, or even make your own easily using some fresh noodles from any market in Chinatown).  These must have been good once upon a time, but believe me--they are not anymore.\n\nTip: If you still decide to get the garlic noodles, and similarly find them to be lacking, you can do as I did, and request fish sauce and chili paste--that will make the noodles more edible and definitely more flavorful.\n\nThe place is filthy by the way--the entire experience from the elevator ride up to the lobby area, to the tables, to the utensils and plates.  I'm fine with dirty at a cheap and tasty asian restaurant--but at this price point, that's just unacceptable.  They used to have water features throughout, which have since been turned off (permanently?), and only add to the old/dingy vibe with hard water stains and even visible ceiling leak stains in the lobby.  Others have mentioned that the carpet is gross/smelly--which is also true.\n\nService was solid by the waiters and busboys.  Managers, however, were loudly telling others what to do and moved tables in and out 3 times while we were there, to weirdly try to accommodate parties.  Odd for a place that has a \"dressy\" attire.\n\nAs for attire....not sure why some Yelpers stated that a collar is required--the dress code is casual, with jeans, sweaters, and tennis shoes all around.\n\nIt's easy to get a reservation even calling at 7pm on a Saturday night.  It's no wonder why.", "author": "Vanessa O."}

I'd only come back if a group of friends chose this restaurant. I would not be the first to say, let's go to Crustacean.\n\nDuring this dinner date, we actually had a poor experience. The server / manager did apologize and remove the dish off the check but it left a bad taste in our mouth - literally. I ordered the lobster and my date ordered the dungeness crab. 5 minutes later the waiter came back to me and said they just sold out of lobster. Boo. So I changed mine up to the shrimp. Food came out REALLY fast. I mean in like 5-10 minutes. That was crazy. As I'm enjoying the jumbo shrimp with the garlic noodles, my date was questioning his. He asked me try it as he said it tastes like he's eating ammonia. I took a bite and it smelled like my nail polish remover. I know I did not just do my nails. I then took another bite and didn't taste it. I told him if he's iffy about it - to just tell them. He looked around and felt bad. Saying everyone is eating this dish and that it's going to make him look crazy. So he's just not going to eat it. Well I ended up getting the waiter's attention and we secretly asked him in whispers as to not disturb other guests. He said it happens to crabs. One out of 1000 will change and taste like that. And he can take it off the check. Weird reasoning but we said okay. Then we asked if anyone else has complained tonight. He said no. He then came back and said actually I spoke to the manager and 3 other people have complained tonight. Aha so we aren't crazy. It still was a bad rep to have. Don't think we'd be coming back.

We had the Roast Crab, Tamarind Crab, and Drunken Crab, and all of them were OK, but overcooked. Unfortunately, the drunken crab tasted a bit fishy, which can imply that the crab wasn't all that fresh. (Because crabs go bad pretty much immediately, it's important to cook them live)\n\nOf the three crabs, the Roast Crab was the tastiest, and it's their signature dish. The roast crab is super buttery, so you might want to try the other crabs if you're not into tons of butter. The Drunken Crab was steamed in some sort of wine sauce, but it tasted slightly off, perhaps it wasn't too lively when it was steamed. The Tamarind Crab was prepared in some sort of sweet and sour sauce.\n\nWe also ordered a side of garlic noodles, which were very tasty and kind of buttery, and sauteed snap peas. If you like crab butter (aka the yellow guts), you can try mopping the body shell clean with the noodles. Yum!\n\nMy dinner companions were also crab enthusiasts, and they seemed to like the crabs, except that they also noted that one of the crabs was fishy. I like my crab barely cooked, while Crustacean cooks them too well done for my tastes.\n\nThe crabs were pretty good size -- a bit over 2 1/2 lbs. I'm not sure where they get such large crabs this time of year, but at least they were big. \n\nIn my opinion, the black bean crab and the ginger crab at Yuet Lee is the best crab in the city, besides the crabs I steam at home.", "author": "Allen T."}

This place has a similar menu compared to thanh long but has a more variety of options. We ordered the salmon carpaccio , roasted crab, and the lobster w/ angel hair pasta. The salmon carpaccio came out and id like to say that is the best appetizer I have ever had... It tasted like heaven, the famous roasted crab was great as usual tasted exactly like thanh long , but the lobster w/ angel hair pasta was bomb! I like how the lobster was peeled from its shell already and the presentation was nice. The service was amazing I would definetly recommend people to try out this place if they're craving seafood.", "author": "Johnny L."}

Our party of 9 were seated in the bar areas, outside the kitchen (what was the point of reservations for a group event?). The food was tasteless. The few times our server, James, made it to the table he would insult us. He began asking if anyone wanted appetizers. Everyone said no with exception of 1 member of our party.  James took it upon himself to tell our table...'appetizers are orders for the whole table'. WTH!!!! His insults continued when a member of my party stated she wanted to order later.  James told her if she didn't order now that he had other tables and that he wouldn't be taking her order until he completed orders from the other tables. AND that would be whenever.  During the order taking process, James says, \"really...this is how this evening is going to be.\"...just one of his many unprovoked comments.  A guest in our party asked for her mojito to be well muddled.  When he finally brought the drink to the table, James sarcastically says \"here Ms. Muddle.\" The glorified garlic noodles are spaghetti noodles which are textured and flavored like ramen noodles.  I'm pretty sure the food was prepared and cooked in a dish washer.  Other than the cliched name...THERE IS NO REASON TO EAT HERE!!!  \n\nPaying the bill was a fiasco. The bill came, but take go orders were not delivered. James says the 3 items were comped because we did not receive them. When it was pointed out the items were on the bill. James (virtually instantaneously) stood on the inside of the kitchen door and then placed the orders on our table.  How long was that food cooked? Why was it still in the kitchen?  The bill was paid in cash.  James took the cash and bill to the bar to count. He counted at least twice, then had 4 other servers count the money.  Unbelievable, so the money is laying across the bar; James brings money to our table saying we overpaid (mind you he left the cash laying across the bar). He returns to the bar and recounts 2 more times. He talks to another server then comes to our table and says the money is ten dollars short. We hand him the $10.  He counts. At this point, the whole evening is intolerable. Management is contacted.  Two members from our party updated the management on the disaster of the night. During that time, James, comes to table again saying the bill is $8 short.  \n\nThe management had absolutely no concern. We asked for information to get in contact with the owners.  Of course, the information a miscarriage convoluted information.  \n\nThe common complaint of yelpers regarding this restaurant is the poor service...absolutely and the food sucks!!! I reviewed this restaurant before my visit, but thought the negative feedbacks might could be unjust. HELL!! I was wrong. \n\nCrustacean can take lessons from the P.F. Changs restaurant chain on providing customers...good times, excellent food, and awesome service. \n\nOnly highlights were the valet service and staff busing tables were considerate and properly timed.  \n\nNo one should lose their job for a bad day at work, but this is the exception. James was unprofessional. Obviously, his standard of service is acceptable for Crustacean's because the service complaints are bountiful.", "author": "Yava B."}

There were 4 of us, all haven't been to Crustaceans before. Ordered two roasted crab at $60 a piece, they charged an extra $5 for cracking the shell for you, which I thought was weird. We also ordered the sea bass and garlic noodles. The food tasted great.  The place was very small and felt tight.  The group seated next to us kept bumping our chairs that they eventually requested to move tables. The service was sub par. Our server had minimal pleasantries, almost to the point that it offended my guests.   We got better service and smile from the guy who bussed our table. I would have given a 3.5 stars but Yelp didn't provider .5 star options. So 4 stars, it is.  The round up was mainly for the food, the busser and the fact that we were seated right away, even though we arrived 15 minutes early from our reservation time.  Disappointed with the service.

A big whole crab cooked in garlicky butter with salt and pepper. Very simple and fresh and oh soooo mouth watering. I kept dipping the crab in the sauce in the bottom of the plate and drizzling it over the garlic pasta. Oh and that garlicky pasta was amazing! This place is definitely on my favorite list.

The hostess was very helpful on the phone when I had to change my reservation from 4 to 5. Valet parking is convenient if you can't find street parked, such as in our case. We ordered our usual roast crab, tiger prawns, and garlic noodles, which were all delicious as expected. Our server Danny was awesome - attentive and friendly - and we even tried other menu items that he suggested. The salt and pepper calamari and the shaken beef were delicious!\n\nSo what I really appreciated about Crustacean was the pace of our meal and when the food was brought out. Normally eating at Thanh Long, we have become accustomed to their very fast pace, almost \"get you in and out\" feeling, yet still satisfying that craving for the roast crab and garlic noodles. Crustacean was definitely slower paced and not rushed - perfect for catching up over dinner with our cousins from out of town. It was their first time at an An Family restaurant and they were excited to try the famous crab and noodles that they heard about from friends.

That seemed reasonable and I had no issues with paying that. We arrive and the valet attendants just stand there like statues. They did not open the door for us or even greet us. I had to approach them in order for them to actually move. Once they got into the car all they did was park it across the street so I highly suggest you save yourself some money and park across the street for free.\n\nService: The only friendly person in the restaurant was the host. He was very polite and respectful asking if my grandpa was able to climb up a few steps to the table and if not he would find us a table where he wouldn't have to climb any stairs. Our waitress and other staff were extremely rude and unfriendly. \n\nFood:\n     Roasted crab- 1 star. I've heard that this is their specialty so I've been wanting to try it out. I thought it lacked a lot of flavor. The sauce for the crab was very light and it seemed like they didn't put much seasoning on it at all. For being something that they are known for, I was very disappointed. \n\n     Garlic noodles: 3 stars. Something that actually had flavor. A mouthful of rich garlic noodles in every bite was delicious. I love garlic so I enjoyed this dish. \n\n According to my mom and sister, the ladies restroom was very messy with trash all over the floor and the stalls had toilet paper all over it.

Let me start off by saying this used to be me & my wife's favorite place. We used to fly to San Francisco just to eat here....that's how great this place used to be...8 years ago    that was. And this was our 1st visit since 8 years ago and it has really gone down hill....way down hill...like falling off the cliff bad. The stench of fish when we entered the restaurant was the first sign and then to see flies in the lobby was the second. Here's a bit of important info: If crabs smell like ammonia when you're eating them...they're bad....Our crabs smelled like ammonia but we weren't sure why at the time..( I think we were in denial). I Googled it after I got home and found out that I ate bad crabs. I surprised I didn't get sick. \n\nThe decor and lack of cleanliness of this place is despicable. It should get one star just based on that.  The service left a lot to be desired. I waitress really tried but she was just overwhelmed and was struggling to keep up with her tables. Needless to say, we will never go  back there nor would we recommend it to any of our enemies either.

This restaurant used to be a special place for my boyfriend and I because we have been coming here since one of our first dates 5 years ago. We used to bring all our friends here every time we visited the city. The food is amazing, but this review is one star because just last night we came here before my boyfriend's daughter left on a plane the next day and I left my wallet at the restaurant. My boyfriend had asked me if I had any extra dollars in my wallet to give our server a better tip because we had such great service and great food, so I grabbed my wallet out of my purse and got some money out for him. We went straight to our hotel from there, and when we got to the hotel my wallet was gone. I had realized I left it on the table, called back the restaurant twice and they said they never saw it. This means somebody from that restaurant STOLE my wallet and I really want it back. Even if whoever from this restaurant took every cent out of my wallet I just really want the actual wallet back because it is really special to me. I would love to be contacted from anyone that works here with information as to who took it. If that person gets a guilty conscious please send it to me on my address listed on my license that you now have!

It had great flavor and it was cooked just right. Yes, you have to crack the crab to get the meat out, but that is part of the fun. Of course, In addition we got the Garlic Noodles, and they also live up to the extreme hype. Our waiter was great and knowledgeable about not only the menu items but also about the other locations of restaurants that are related. Also important to the experience, we weren't rushed out by the waiter and he always made sure our drinks were full and the bowl for the crab shells was never full. He came by a lot. The dining experience in the restaurant is 5-Star. The restaurant is very clean and has an upscale atmosphere. \n\nThe reason I am taking off a star is because of the location and the neighborhood around it. It is kind of far from Bart which makes it harder for people like me who were college students to get there - Really you need to take a cab or Uber if coming from Bart - the cab ride was about $11 each way. The walk is long quite long and up and down big hills. The other reason is because of the buildings around it. They don't have much eye appeal. Crustacean is like a super nice upscale restaurant and it seemed a little out of place given the surroundings. Yes, I know it has been in this location for a long long time, so I can't knock it much for that. \n\nSo this is a 4-Star review - But how does it compare to my other reviews? Well I gave Flemings and Roys of Newport Beach 5-Stars, because everything about my most recent meals there were absolutely perfect. This was not quite that, but it was a great meal still. This 4-Star is a higher 4-Star than the others I have given, if I had the option it would have been a 4.5-Star review. \n\nBottom line: Of course I would be excited to go back any time I am in San Francisco or even the East Bay (if ever) and I want a special meal. The dining experience is worth the slight travel inconvenience in getting there. \n\nI can't wait to try the one in Beverly Hills!", "author": "Ryan M."}

That ended up being a good thing, since the food here is on the pricey side. I was able to make reservations easily over the phone, but I did call almost two weeks in advance for a dinner on a weekday night. Our table was ready when we arrived, but we were a little squished in a booth for 7 people, and that was with 3 extra chairs. We ended up ordering a bunch of dishes to share:\n\n-New Zealand Green Lip Mussels (Broiled w/Asian Pesto & Served w/Garlic Crostini, $12, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A): Pretty good, but not amazing. I liked the flavor of the Asian pesto, but the garlic crostini were overbaked and too crunchy for my liking.\n-Crab Puffs (Dungeness Crab Meat Wrapped in Wonton Shell, w/Peanut Mustard, Greens, $10, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#JZtSK84vaRuWQwtMb1SRXA): Good, but there was too much wonton shell. Skip.\n-Sashimi (Thinly Sliced Salmon w/a Daikon Radish, Citrus Soy Ponzu Dressing, $16, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#k5wbcONnW9uGshWbd8ejvg): Yum! The sashimi was really fresh, and I liked the ponzu dressing. It was pricey for the portion size, but worth it if you're expensing the dinner.\n-Shaken Beef (Filet Mignon Cubed, Flamb\u00e9ed in Burgundy Wine, Served w/Red Potatoes & Roma Tomatoes, $30, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#0LrAzTcD_PaiF2HQl59gwg): Ok, but again expensive for the portion size.

The raviolis were really good, and you'll like this if you like creamy sauces.

I wished that the short rib was still on the bone, instead of this boneless kind which I don't think is as flavorful. Skip!\n-Herb Roasted Halibut (Saut\u00e9ed Sweet Onions, Asparagus, Portobello Mushrooms, $39, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#bHKg3qmo8brm4rXsEn1l-g): Eh, so-so. The fish was a little overcooked, and I wouldn't get this again.\n-Charbroiled Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns (Served w/An's Famous Garlic Noodles, $42, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#F1q_xSdEGrb9BVaf3K0J5Q): Just ok. The prawns were a little overcooked so it was difficult to peel off the shells. They only give you 4 prawns, so I wouldn't get this again.\n-An's Famous Roasted Crab (w/An's Garlic Sauce & Secret Spices), Tamarind Crab, Drunken Crab ($50/each, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#4e9nAVNS_m0RHhEwD5HAZg): Our favorite version was the famous roasted crab, but it came sitting in a pool of melted butter which solidfies towards the end of your meal, so make sure you eat this quickly! The drunken version and tamarind were good/ok, but not as good as the roasted in my opinion.\n-An's Famous Garlic Noodles ($12, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#79W6s7DQ9SlIxlzISP2gGQ): Good, although it wasn't as garlicky as I was expecting.

First off, you're immediately transported back into the late 60s (with a touch of modern flair) with the classic decor and polished waitstaff. I love the layout of the place with the split level style allowing for a ton of tables! We knew exactly what we wanted based on previous reviews...garlic noodles and whole crab! We split a garlic noodle and got the roast and drunken crab for 2. The noodles are out of this world!! It is so simple but bursting with flavor! The roast crab definitely had a better flavor profile compared to the drunken crab, which was more traditional with strong notes of pepper and celery. Overall, the crab meat was very juicy and it was steamed well, but it wasn't perfect. I did love hearing that the crabs were in the water that morning, and on my plate hours later! Definite 5 stars was the service. The waiters are impeccable with replacing the shell bowl and clearing napkins as you eat. You never feel messy! This is a place to go if you're wanting some warm, comforting food on a cold night. Everything about this place is inviting and welcoming!", "author": "Nazia H."}

We arrived a little beyond our 15 min grace period because of an accident ( I called to notify them) on the way. When we arrived the host attitude was terrible. It was Valentine's Day so I could understand some frustration if there was a huge crowd of some sort but there was NOT. No one in the waiting area and when we were seated there were at least 4 tables in our area that were vacant. When we sat down we heard the host say to make sure we were gone by 8:30 which I feel is horrible and unprofessional to hear as a customer. Throughout our dining experience Paul was EXCELLENT. Very attentive and didn't rush us at all. When it was nearing 8:30 the host began to come to our area often. Shortly after we received our bill the host approached Paul backed him into the corner and began giving him a hard time about us leaving. We had eaten pass 8:30 however there are multiple factors as to why we were still dining past that time most importantly the kitchen staff getting the food out quickly enough along with an entire restaurant to cater to. I thought it was totally uncalled for, disrespectful, and horrible customer service to over hear some things the host said to Paul and for an employee to talk to another in such a way .

It's expensive but wtf do you expect for high quality seafood restaurant in SF...? \n\nI read some reviewers complain about having to walk upstairs to get to the restaurant...um....what? If walking up three flights of stairs ruins your evening you must have health issues, or seriously need more exercise. Also read complaints that the \"body of the crab was used for decoration and there wasn't much meat inside.\" Again , WHATY The SHELL of the crab is used as decoration as most people don't consume all the innards inside the shell. I assure you, if you like the brains/organs/fishy bits they will bring them to you. (A server promptly removed my fathers shell which he set aside and my father commented he was going to eat it, the waiter brought my Dad two fresh ones) You can do the traditional Portuguese thing of pouring your wine in there and slurping up the sludgy fishiness. Most people don't like that. There isn't \"meat\" in there. If you think there is you are ignorant. They do serve the meaty body of the crab, the claws and legs. That's where the meat is. Nuff said.\n\nAll of their crab is yummy, roasted most simple hence more crab flavor, drunken has more flavor from the wine and tamarind obviously is sweet and yummy but can't taste the actual crab as much. Garlic noodles are tasty but not as fantastic as some people thing, imo. But, I'm not really into noodles. sea Bass, Stuffed calamari are tasty. Seafood salad.

Even though we had a reservation at 6:30 we got there 30 minutes earlier and asked if we could be seated earlier and the host said we would be seated in a couple minutes. The ambiance of the restaurant is very romantic with dim lighting. We got seated and ordered a Riesling wine to start. We ordered the two special appetizers, a lobster salad and the salt and pepper calamari. The lobster in the salad was delicious and the dressing that went on top went perfectly with the mango in the salad and added a nice light touch that tied in all the ingredients of the salad. The calamari wasn't greasy and was nice and crispy with the perfect amount of breading so that the taste of the seafood wasn't overwhelmed. There was also a nice dipping sauce on the side. We ordered the famous roast crab, the drunken crab, garlic noodles, garlic rice, tiger prawns and the tamarind crab to share amongst us. The roast crab was DELICIOUS and I can see why it is their famous one. The tamarind crab was recommended by our waiter and it did not disappoint. The drunken crab was the least flavorful in comparison to the other two and I would probably recommend the crabs in the order of: roast, tamarind then drunken. However, the crab meat in all of them was cooked to PERFECTION. The meat was tender and delicious and easy to crack open. The garlic noodles were phenomenal as was the rice and the prawns. The prawns also came with garlic noodles underneath them which was nice. We finished with a dessert to complete our meal. In addition to our food being delicious, our waiter, Paul was also awesome!

It was a special of the day and I don't see it in the menu.. **I don't think the appetizers are very worth it for what they give you.\n\nBaked Alaska (~$10): Side of Caramel & Banana, Chocolate Ice Cream, Chocolate Cake (?) and topped with a Meringue...

When you pull up to the restaurant the area does not look very nice and the restaurant is pretty small. However, if you are familiar with the SF area you know not to judge a book by its cover. Some of the most upscale spots are located in not so pretty areas. Once you get inside you are greeted with an elegant atmosphere. Lots of Vietnamese art and dim romantic lighting. I think they made great use of the space they have.\n\nFOOD: No questions asked you must get the roasted crab and garlic noodles. I have yet to taste a crab that can measure up to AN'S FAMOUS ROASTED CRAB. The flavors in this crab are mouth watering. My fiance and I love love love the garlic pepper sauce on the crab. That stuff is the bomb, it makes you just want to dip your fingers in it (we have a few times. haha). We ALWAYS pair our crab with the GARLIC NOODLES. As simple as they look I have again yet to find a place that can even compare to the rich flavors these noodles have. We typically dip our noodles in the garlic sauce from the crab. LOL. Sometimes when I am craving something different I get the CHARBROILED COLOSSAL ROYAL TIGER PRAWNS. They too are packed with rich flavor. I think the prawns are a great dish because they come with garlic noodles, you do not need to order them separately. Lately we have been ordering the beef skewers as our appetizer. Really amazing with a grand amount of flavor as well. \n\nSERVICE: Very great service. You can tell that the entire Crustacean's (House of An) team is dedicated to providing superior service to all of their customers. I am really impressed by how well Crustacean's (House of An) takes care of their clients. I have no complaints. \n\nNothing can compare to this place. It is by far one of the best places to eat in San Francisco. I will most certainly be back!", "author": "Staja J."}

What a treat.\n\nThere's nothing bad to say here.  The crab is absolutely huge, swimming in garlic and spices and the noodles are a great companion dish.  Ask anyone that knows this place and the first thing they mention is the noodles.  They are very good but I still think the crab is the star.\n\nEating this monster is time consuming in order to pick it clean but it is well worth the effort.

That's something they're known for!  You don't butcher up what you're famous for ... that's like saying In-n-Out isn't good at making burgers.  Simply put, Crustacean's ... you disappointed.  They're located on the 2nd or 3rd floor of a plaza-like area so you'll definitely have to climb up some stairs.  We still waited a solid 30 minutes even though I had made reservations two days prior.  \n\nWe ordered the Miso Ginger Glazed Beef, Shrimp Toast, Papaya Salad and the famous Garlic Noodles they're supposedly known for.  In terms of taste and quality, everything fell below the norm: over-buttered, too much time spent in the fryer, not enough zest, not enough marinade, etc.  The Garlic Noodles were a gloppy, over-buttered mess.  No time was spent on the plating or presentation.  I thought to myself: they must be REALLY good if they don't spend any time caring about that sort of thing.  Then when I dug in, it tasted like I was putting pure butter in my mouth.  The garlic essence was barely existent and the noodles themselves were boiled a tad too long.  \n\nThe bill rang us up somewhere around $80 for two people (no alcoholic drinks, but includes tax & tip).  At least our server was really nice though.  \n\nPS - don't order the coffee.  I was in need of a caffeine kick so I ordered it; I won't be doing that again.", "author": "Crystine W."}

I was drooling all over my iPad from staring at the food.  So, I booked reservations to eat here with another GF that I typically eat crab with.\n\nThere's a bit of snootiness when you book your reservations.  It almost feel like they are doing you a favor for allowing you to eat there, the dude on the phone said, \"We only hold taaaables for 15 minutes after your reservaaations\".  I was like, okay sure whatever.  Even after the snootie-ness, I still want to eat there and was actually appreciative that I got reservations.\n\nAfter being seated, we both rolled our eyes to the sky because the restaurant was practically empty.  How dare they make me feel like I was the luckiest girl alive to get reservations!  There was plenty of open tables.  Sheesh.\n\nSo, we ordered the roasted crab, buttered prawns with garlic noodles and a pot of hot green tea.  The food came out quickly.  We were crackalacketing, slurping, wiping,  and shoving food bits into our big mouths...simultaneously trying not to look barbaric. Which is impossible to do.  I don't know what they do to those crabs but the favors were deeply infused into the meat.  The prawns were butter.  The noodles licikity smacking garlic and butter.  We washed everything down with the green tea.  Lemme tell ya, Im a big green tea drinker and this tea was flavorful and bold.  They don't serve the cheap stuff here, no sir-e-o-bob.  Oh yummy.\n\nThen the big shocker came...the bill.  We knew the crab was pricey already but the prawns with noodles... OMG.  So, expensive.  There was only 4 prawns on top of the noodles and the price was close to the crab price.  Sooooooo expensive and we are sooooooooo not ordering prawns anymore.  We both don't think it's worth it for that price.  \n\nIf your in the mood for crab and letting all your cash go from your Chanel wallet, come here for a bite.  It's delicious and worthy of eating at least 1x per year.", "author": "Jenny T."}

Upon arriving 2 minutes before my reservation, I was unexpectedly informed that there was no reservation listed under my name.  As this is my first time here, starting this off on the wrong foot does not do good for the business as I'm already getting a bad first impression.  \n\nThe guy told us he can seat us anyway and that we were more than welcomed to stay by the bar as they prep our table.  We went to the bar and got some drinks and eventually transferred our tab back to the table.  We got seated in a corner, next to a loud birthday party of 8.  I could barely keep a conversation with my friend unless I practically shout at him across the small table.  \n\nThe service for our food was good.  The waiters came by to check on us a couple times.  We ordered 2 roasted crab and the noodle.  The noodle is good to dip into the sauce of the crab, but be careful not to flood it.  The waiter was constantly changing our bowl of crab shells even if we didn't even fill up the bowl, sometimes barely even had one scrap in there.  This could be a good or bad thing, but I personally thought it was annoying because they were constantly interrupting my conversation.  \n\nOur bill came out to be $125.43 and I gave a $19.57 tips (which would ultimately add up to $145 EVEN).  I don't care if you're expecting a normal 25% tip in SF, I will give you the tip you deserve.  The waitress came back and told me I did the math wrong, that it should have been $150 instead.  Seriously?  If you're looking for more tips, you can ask me if the service provided was less than expected, but don't come back telling me I did my math wrong.  \n\nOverall, food was good but the service just spoiled it for me.

Until now we've always had a great dining experience and the staff has always been prompt and courteous. We came to enjoy another birthday celebration with our family but were sorely let down by our server and support staff. They were basically inattentive or MIA. For example, they did not bus or reset the table as expected at a restaurant of this caliber, we should never have to ask for simple things such as water refills, new bowls for shells, or to bus empty plates and glasses between courses, that should automatically be part of the service, effortless, seamless. Service was slow too, which was odd since there were empty tables all around. Lastly a word to the support staff...\"HEY MAN\" is NOT an appropriate way to address your patrons.\n\nUnfortunately with the standard practice of automatically charging gratuity for tables of +6, I believe has caused a negative complacent behavior.

I agree with most of the other reviews, the roast crab and garlic noodles are the way to go! The crab and noodles were a perfect meal to split.

All three dishes were good but not really memorable. The crab was certainly well cooked, moist and sauce was good but in my opinion not worth the $55+ price tag.

Crab, garlic noodles, calamari, beef carpaccio and veggies... everything was a WOW!  Second, the staff are wonderful.  We were catching up with friends we had not seen in 16 years and celebrating a birthday.  I have a small service dog and another group of 6 at the opposite end of the seating area started yelling and screaming about the dog and saying they were going to call the health department.  The staff were incredibly patient, asked them to calm down or leave, and adamant that they were not going to eject us because of my hearing dog.  (Who was not even visible to the other party except when we walked by them to our seat).  It was a bit jarring for a few minutes, and hard to believe, but thanks to the wonderfully professional and kind management and servers at Crustacean, we did not dwell on the incident, and had a wonderful eveing with our friends.  I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a memorable meal that is special in every way thanks to staff that are inclusive and welcoming.", "author": "Deborah D."}

We went with a group of friends for dinner and we loved it so much that we went back for lunch the next day.  When we called about lunch they told us no t-shirt and jeans so my BFF and I headed over to nihon machi and bought yukatas to eat lunch.  \n\n8 years later I found myself in SF for the weekend.

The mixed salad was even yummy and special with a unique dressing and toped with asian pear.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-02-17", "description": "Save your money. There are way too many restaurants in SF to waste your time on this one. Our large group made reservations and we had to wait an additional hour. There was no acknowledgement from the hostess. When we asked her, she just simply said \"we can't control how long people stay at the tables.\" Hellllloooo! A simple apology would have been sufficient at least. \n\nWe finally got seated and here is my assessment of their dishes.\n\n- Roasted Garlic Crab...they charge an additional $6 to crack the crab for you on top of the hefty $42. I'm lazy so I was the only one in the group who paid for it. But when the crabs came, the waiter didn't even identify or asked who ordered the cracked crab and gave it to my friend. We didn't figure that out until later. Of course they didn't remove the $6 off the bill, they just made my friend pay for it. \n\n- Stir fry vegetables were pretty much soggy veggies tossed in oyster sauce for $18.\n\n- Salmon Carpaccio was not fresh and not worth the $14 for 4-5 pieces of salmon masked in sauce (the salmon was a brown tint). It was probably to hide the fishy taste since it was not fresh.\n\n- Corn bisque with crab was really my dessert. Who serves soup all the way towards the end of a meal? They served this to me towards the very end. And I couldn't help myself and I said out loud that this tasted like school cafeteria food. It was awful and there was no crab at all, just some white flakes floating on the top. This was the most disgusting item on their menu.\n\nOverall experience was very poor. The waiter had to have known we were dissatisfied with the wait and the food but chose to be ignorant to it. The manager never checked up with our group once to see how we were doing. You would think that's their job. They might have been good in the past but that has certainly change. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone!", "author": "Wendy L."}

No... I didn't take off my shirt to reveal a glistening 6-pack like in the movie. Reality is harsher. Luckily for my fat sorry ass I was wearing a crisp white shirt under said offensive hoodie. \n\nI really have no qualms with dress codes at restaurants. I just ask that if you believe yourself to be that type of establishment, then have the balls to strictly enforce it. We would have easily turned away and gone somewhere else instead of being made to feel awkward despite dropping hundreds of dollars on dinner. \n\nWe stumbled in to celebrate 2 birthdays (obviously not knowing there was a dress code ... hey I didn't even Yelp it before hand) and while I was made to take my hoodie off, others were told to keep their jackets on becuase they were wearing t-shirts underneath. It's very arbitrary and if you look around the neighborhood, very misplaced. Crustacean is still stuck in a distorted, 80's view of fine dining. \n\nAlright, dress code rant aside, Crustacean's did surprise me. The decor was nice and the service, attentive. Special props go out to our server who was really cordial and balanced out the occasional look of disdain from the ma\u00eetre d'. \n\nWe started out with several small plates - lobster salad (special for the day), crab puffs, grilled calamari, and the \"famous\" garlic noodles. The crab puffs were the star of the apps. Light and fluffy, we devoured them in an instant. The rest of the apps were decent - fresh seafood and flavorful dipping sauces but nothing you can't find anywhere else. \n\nI had the catch of the day for my entree which was a pan-seared Vietnamese Basa over rice vermicelli (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BahDyzswTsdaSa8jnOaK-A?select=xgUxBL08bNgv__mXrcenpg). I was honestly surprised by how flavorful and well balanced the dish was. Other entrees on the table included roast chicken, crab cakes, shaken beef, and the \"signature dish\" - roasted crab. Folks seemed to like the food. \n\nThey did bring out an ice cream dessert for the birthday boy, and then a second (somewhat begrudged) when they realized there were 2 birthday boys. \n\nIn summary, the food at Crustaceans is good, but not one-of-a-kind great. Is it worth to get \"dressed up\" for dinner here? My answer is no. Then again, their rules are so flexible a polo tee might suffice since its got a collar. With that said, there are just so many better places to go spend your money on a great dinner so why bother.", "author": "Jon L."}

At first I was scared of getting the crab, but my friends reassured me the body was just for shove. The body was empty, just placed on top of the legs.

It was really good, my tactic was take out all the meat, then feast. Also got the garlic noodles, about $10.

Wait...maybe it took me eating crab at several other places including my own preparation of it to kick start this review and tell the world that it doesn't get better than Crustaceans. The An family does it right. Heck yes it's pricy for Vietnamese food. But heck yes it's worth every penny. So let me start by saying you need to be prepared to spend $55 to $64 per person. You don't do it all the time and you're crazy or mad rich if you do so enjoy it.\n\nI will tell you that everything on the menu is great and everything should be tried once. But if you are going here for the first time you must have the roast crab and an order of garlic noodles. It's the supreme pairing here. Garlic on garlic on garlic. The garlic is actually kneaded into the noodle dough so you get garlic with each bite. The crab also soaks up the garlic butter/lard concoction that they rub all over the crab body. It truly is finger licking and don't be pretentious, enjoy your plate and get gritty.\n\nSo I see some bad knocks on the reviews here. I don't know where these bad reviews come from. My wife and I have been coming here, and their sister restaurant thanh long for many years now and we have never been disappointed. The two restaurants pretty much have identical menus. You are not saving much with thanh long so my preference is to just eat at Crustaceans. I like it better inside and it's just finer dining to me. If I'm spending over $50 anyway, my logic is another $10 shouldn't kill me.\n\nI would recommend trying all their crab preps. The drunken and tamarind are also very tasty. The baked Alaska for dessert is the business and \"drip\" all over your face yummy. They have an awesome wine and bubbly menu and some cocktails too. One anniversary the wife and I shelled out $700 here. Yes, we sure did. It only takes a couple good bottles to get there. When we go, we normally order a crab a piece and garlic noodles each. We also share one other entree as our appetizer. Then we share the baked Alaska. It's a lot of food and the bill normally comes to about $180 or so with a drink or two. Crab is always market price but hovers around $35 - $48 each. \n\nTo me this has become a part of SF and is definitely a spot to go and check out at least once. C'mon would I lead you astray? I think not. I know my one positive vibe can't over power some of the negatives here but seriously I think the negative knocks were not in it for the right things. If you want the tastiest garlic crab and garlic noodles in the world you need to come here. The end!!! Mamba out!", "author": "Ryan C."}

To proceed we then went to our seats. The waiter was very kind and had helped us out as we needed, when we needed. The garlic noodles was good, the shaken beef was very tender and the garlic rice was  amazing too and the carpaccio was astonishing.  As for the crab, the tamarind sauce was good, but seemed to be a little salty on some areas of the sides of the crab and same for the shaken beef as well. Once we cracked the crab, the inside didn't taste as expected. The texture tasted as if it was old/dead crab or not fresh.  Usually the crab does not have that texture nor have certain spots that were very salty on it,  that's why I was very shocked for the first time ever. Very powdery/dry inside. At the very end of it all the service was good and food was okay. One thing we did not get as we seen everyone else get was a hot wet towel at the end. This experience yesterday night was okay, but in the morning today, my boyfriend and I had very upset stomachs and felt a little sick/nauseated...not good.", "author": "Alazae P."}

No matter how great the food, when bad management is involved that leads to an unpleasant experience, it will inevitably bring the business down!!!\n.\nSean is the WORST manager I have ever encountered in any business. Sean is unprofessional, unpleasant, and simply RUDE.  I have dined here quite a few times and have loved the food every time.  I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, this rudeness just crossed that line!\n\nAfter the 49er's victory yesterday, we arrived 8-10 min earlier than their opening hr.  Trying to make the experience short, I asked if  we can simply sit and enjoy the view at a table and have some private conversation, not asking for service or anything else,  whenever the kitchen is open, we will look at the menu.  Sean rudely responded with a snip in his voice \"NO, We're not open, you can wait outside\"  OKAY.\n\nSEAN, YOU ARE NOT DOING ANYONE ANY FAVORS BY US DINING THERE.  YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER PROFESSION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE PEOPLE SKILLS, WHICH YOU CERTAINLY LACK!  \n\nWE WILL NOT RETURN OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AS LONG AS SEAN IS THERE!  \n\nHe said \" I'm the manager and my name is Sean that's spelled S.E.A.N.\"  At least  you can spell your own name!

Classy joint for a place where you dig in with your hands - we liked it!  \n\nWe got An's Garlic Noodles egg noodles infused with An's famous garlic sauce 9.50.  The noodles were lacking a garlic taste as in their description.  On the bland side with perhaps more of an oily taste than anything flavorful.  \n\nThe Tamarind Crab in a sweet and sour sauce with of tomatoes, fresh dill, Vietnamese chili, and fresh herbs not be a great combination for some, but it was perfect for me.  I particularly enjoyed this dish because when I usually dine on crab, it is with simple seasonings, either steamed alone or dipped with salt/pepper and lemon.  This interesting twist with tamarind sauce gave it variety and went well with the crab.  \n \nWe ended the night with a Baked Alaskan.  It does not compare at all to Boston's Steakhouse Grill 23's baked Alaskian (a standard in which I now compare all of the Baked Alaskians in the world to).  It was barely even a baked Alaskan and I strongly urge them to renaming the dish to avoid misunderstandings by the patrons.  I was expecting a baked Alaskan but found myself eating something more along the lines of a slice of cake with ice cream on the side. \n\nAll in all a good place for their seafood - a bit on the pricey side, but it makes up for it in ambiance.  You could probably get more money's worth at Boiling Crab or places like that, but here you can get your hands messy on a pristine white linen tablecloth :)", "author": "Theresa V."}

Oh my.\n\nAnywho, it was raining and since we're in San Francisco: it was freezing too. We stepped in and I felt instantly confused because our friends said this place was like a crab shack but it was the complete opposite ! I felt like I was going to an opera, the place was so dark and grim, I could barely see the host that was in front of us. We were instantly seated down, there were groups in front of us: this place is definitely a place to go with a big group. \n\nWe were seated down and got our menu. I was still confused how our friends said this was ANYTHING like Joe's Crab Shack, nothing on the menu was as cheap as a regular crab restaurant. I told my boyfriend to contact one of our friends who went and they told us \"Craw Station\", I was a bit upset because I was hoping we could get down and dirty with our shrimp, but in this restaurant: I think you'd get kicked out for that. Haha. We decided to just stay because we paid $15 for parking (which was up the street from the restaurant) and we were starving so here we are with my review.\n\nOur waitress was nice, I'm glad she didn't judge us by our attire because I certainly felt under-dressed while everyone walking around were wearing suits and dresses. We ordered the roasted crab (I don't remember seeing a price for it, I think it just said \"marker price\") and a \"large\" bowl of their garlic rice, which was $8. \n\nThe place is for sure slapped \"fancy\" labeled. Some guy came to our table and put our bibs on us ! I started laughing because I think people should just put it on, not have a designated person put on bibs. Very fancy, rich touch but very unnecessary. He also gave us 3 bowls for our shells, the crab cracker and a itty bitty tiny fork. I laughed at the fork too because I've never eaten crab before (the actual crab, not the meat taken out already like in sushi and soups) but I have seen people just pull the meat out with their fingers. I asked my boyfriend what the fork was for and he told me it was to get the meat out of the crab. \n\nOur crab arrived and our \"large\" bowl of their garlic rice (which was as big as 2 egg holders put together). The crab smelled delicious though and it tasted delicious too. A bit too salty for me but it was fun to finally break my own crab and pick out the meat myself. The garlic rice didn't taste bad either. Maybe the crab got to me but everything later on started to taste WAY too salty. I had to keep drinking water, our waitress lagged on our water a couple times which got my a bit frustrated because I couldn't continue eating my food unless my tongue revived back to life with their water. When I got closer to finishing our crab, I gave up on the fork and just pulled the meat out myself. I also asked for a small cup of butter, I wish I asked earlier because it tasted delicious with their hot butter :)\n\nSo our meal was done and I'm pretty sure we were the messiest people there but I could care less. The bib guy came back and removed our bibs, oh my. Haha. Our bill came and WOW our crab was $39 itself. I mean, it was GOOD but NOT THAT GOOD for $39. Oh well! It was a good experience but I wouldn't come back. I felt like our food could have been stolen off our table without us knowing because it was so dark.

I felt a bit overdressed for this place.  \n\nI've been a long time fan of Thanh Long and when I heard about Crustacean's I knew I had to book mark it and save this restaurant for \"special occasions.\" Today my boyfriend and I headed out to the city.  I wanted to surprise him with a romantic dinner since their ratings say that it has \"classy\" for the attire and the \"ambiance\" was romantic.  \n\nFirst, the parking.  This place is located in a complex that hides Crustacean's from the street view.  It's either you go valet or drive around 'till you find a spot.  It's similar to TL, but TL is located in a less busy street.  Also, one big difference is the constant begging on change by the homeless around the complex, which makes it a bit uncomfortable when treasure hunting for the roasted crab.  \n\nSecond, arrival.  Walking from the main floor up three flights of stairs was no problem for me.  We walked by an abandon supermarket on the first floor that had rotting vegetation and soggy cardboard boxes in the mid section, the stench was intolerable. It nearly reeked of homeless piss and garbage.  \n\nThird, the meal.  We were seated relatively fast since it was just the two of us.  Sadly, the dining room was laid out pretty confusing.  The food, however, was just as I remembered it from TL.  My boyfriend was impressed as well.  The service was up to par. \n\nFourth, the bathrooms.  There's only one toilet in the woman's latrine.  You're essentially screwed if there's a ton of woman that needs to piss in groups.  \n\nThe facility was lacking.  It's an old, over ran complex that definitely needs an upgrade.

It's located in a pretty unique center in downtown SF. The BF's dad dropped us off in the street to head up first while he found street parking. We didn't realized there was an elevator and took the stairs up to the third floor. It wasn't a bad walk up and I was pretty mesmerized with the jujitsu going on the second floor.\n\nDon't judge the restaurant by the appearance of the plaza outside. It might look a little shabby but the inside looked pretty upscale. I didn't think there would be as much seating from the outside but it's pretty specious with tables inside. Some tables are located in tight corners and you have to move chairs to get to your seat however. The lighting was a little dim but not to the point where you couldn't see.\n\nI was reassured by the BF's dad to choose whatever I wanted. We basically family styled and picked a whole bunch of dishes. I didn't get a chance to snap any photos since we were eating with his family. We had two calarmari appetizers, lobster and pasta, crab cakes, shaken beef and noodles, and three of the garlic crabs. We didn't realize that most of the entrees would come with the garlic noodies. His mom had put in an extra side order for one beforehand. So if you order the entrees they come with their own side so make sure you read before you put in any extra orders. The crab under the special menu doesn't come with any sides however.\n\nThe calamari was amazing and lobster pasta. I didn't care too much for the crab cakes since I've had better. The crab inside to me didn't taste too fresh. The garlic noodles was pretty delicious but the shaken beef was tender and juicy. Our waitress beforehand had told us she'd save the crabs for last since we'd have to use our hands to eat it. The sad part was by the time the crabs came out I was so stuffed from our entrees. I couldn't enjoy the crab as much as I had wanted. I ate one section of the crabs leg but that was the duration it took everyone else to attack the three crabs. My boyfriend couldn't help but laugh when I told him I had eaten this single section while he had already tackled three sections. \n\nOh, I forgot to mention they really prep you before you eat the crabs. You're provided with plastic bibs, cute tiny forks and claw crackers. Someone is always there to remove dishes you've cleared out and replacing your small plates with new ones. You're left with tons of bowls to put your crab shells as you eat. By the end of the meal you're given a super hotly steamed towel to clean off your hands. \nI can't say it's the best crab I've had since I'm from the south but for California it was pretty darn good. \n\nWe settled for some dessert to share (vanilla bean creme brulee, vanilla mango cheesecake, and flour less chocolate cake with ice cream) which was all delicious besides the cheesecake.  Everyone came out pretty clean besides poor bf's dad. He was stuck doing claw duty for the mom and sister and was splatter with crab meat and juice. His family loved the food and we had lots of fun and laughter the whole time. The host struck conversation with us at the door and asked us how the meal was. My bf's dad had been to Vegas the night before admitted his winnings covered our meal for that evening. As we left the host recommended we come back after his next Vegas trip with winnings.", "author": "Lina T."}

I was not impressed with their sides, but it was a good compliment to the crab.", "author": "Tam J."}

After watching people be served garlic noodles and crab exactly what we ordered we felt disgusted by the service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-30", "description": "I came here for one main reason - Garlic noodles. I checked out the menu ahead of time and saw that most items on the menu are super expensive. I figure I could keep some control on the cost by sticking with the noodles. It's also rated as very expensive on Yelp, but it's actually located in a sort of dingy place downtown next to the Holiday Inn (great hotel, btw).\n\nThe first impression from entering the restaurant from the elevator was set by the maitre d in an expensive suit with a weird stuffy snobby accent. It was very noticeable in his manner of speaking and I noticed other suited staff had similar mannerisms. \n\nOur waitress was quite enthusiastic about the menu but like I said we wanted to keep our dinner light and quick. My friend noticed her enthusiasm wane immediately when we said that. \n\nThe garlic noodles are interesting -i'm told they're very unique. They were good but not mindblowing. I think thats just my taste. I have seen them on other menus so if you're interested in trying those, I'd venture to say that there are other options. We did have some other things. The lobster roll was lacking in lobster meat, the Saigon Beef very good - especially the marinated peppers. The grilled calamari had a weird taste to it, I fear that it wasn't the freshest that day. \n\nOn the way out I saw most people were eating crab. The crab looked HUGE on other people's tables - and by the sounds of it, the other reviews are quite positive about the food - so I'd say average on the food, but -1 on the unnecessary snobbinesse", "author": "Lawrence L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-05-14", "description": "Food:\nLet me start with the good. The roast crab is a must have! If you aren't planning on having it, make sure there is someone on your table who won't mind you stealing a claw or two. The crab is easily a 5/5. Sadly, the good ends there (at least for my most recent experience).\nI was at Crustacean for my post-birthday lunch in April, and almost nothing that came to our table was hot. We didn't order any cold dishes. I usually look forward to the shrimp toast and calamari at Crustacean, but that day, the center of the shrimp toast was cold, almost like it had been in the refrigerator, and the calamari was warm at best. Even the garlic noodles came out half cold, half warm. Every single dish except for the crab had to be sent back to be heated.\n\nAmbiance:\nLunch at Crustacean feels a bit weird. The restaurant is almost empty and the dark surroundings make it almost eerie. For dinner, the ambiance is much more natural, as the dark interior doesn't clash with the outside like it does during the day.\n\nService:\nThe service we received was very good, and has been consistently good every time I go. Our server did seem a bit flustered after taking dish after dish back to the kitchen--I would have been too, considering how servers seem to get blamed for things they don't have control over.\n\nOverall:\nMy last experience at Crustacean was simply embarrassing. I was looking forward to having a great crab lunch with my family, with piping hot shrimp toast, calamari, and garlic noodles. Instead we got a lot of disappointment. This isn't a case of one messed up dish. It is a case of an entire meal ruined because the kitchen couldn't heat our food properly. I hate to say it, because I used to love Crustacean, but the next time I'm in San Francisco, I might have to avoid Crustacean and find another crab place.", "author": "Stanley H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-01-02", "description": "Unfortunately, Crustaceans did not live up to my expectations at all. After my husband and I decided to have dinner here one night, while I was pet sitting in the area, we felt the service was very poor as was the attitude of the people who worked here.\n\nThis is supposed to be an upscale establishment, revered for it's awards and well known for it's quality and service. The food isn't cheap and so I would expect that the atmosphere reflect the price tag. Although, we did not have reservations, it was a slower weekday night and we managed to get seated at a table for two, unfortunately, along side another couple who seemed to have forgotten they were not dining at McDonalds but at an upscale eatery.\n\nFrom the moment we were seated, the other young couple behind us was not only on their cellphone the entire time but had it on SPEAKER phone, set on the table while carrying on a conversation that was both loud, vulgar and disrupting to everyone else. I had notified the waiter of the situation and at first they assured me that they knew and the manager was going to take care of it. We decided to be patient at this point and ordred our food while the conversations persisted. After about 15min of waiting for the establishment to tell these people to turn off their speaker phone or carry on the conversation elsewhere, my patience became to tire quickly as I was trying to enjoy a romantic dinner with my husband and we could not even hear ourselves over the swearing and laughing going on behind between that couple and whoever was on the other end of the speaker phone. I decided to get up and seek out other staff regarding the situation and asked to speak to the manager when they had notified me he was not available at this time and most seemed unaware about the situation. Our waiter had assured us originally that the manager was aware and was going to do something about it as well as reassuring me that their policy did not allow for cell phone conversations to be carried out in their dining room. Considering, this was not just someone answering their phone to say a few quick words but rather an immature couple of kids, carrying out an on going conversation on via speaker phone, you would think that the staff and manager would have been on it within minutes. Clearly, that was not the case and we were given the run around for a good 20min before we even heard the option of being seated elsewhere, which I felt was rather rude and unprofessional. I feel they should have asked the loud couple behind us sitting there to turn off their speaker phone since they were the ones bothering us and I'm sure other diners as well.\n\nOnce we were moved, it was more quiet, however, after placing our ordered we felt rather ignored. I can't even begin to talk about how disappointing the food and service was compared to Thanh Long's (the sister restaurant.) In fact, the garlic noodles were extremely mushy and overcooked and the shaking beef entry we got for nearly $30 was an extremely tiny portions, with 2/3 of the plates filled with green beans and a few cubes of tough and chewy beef in the middle. After the waiter finally came by, we declined any dessert and asked for our bill. They did absolutely nothing to compensate us for the miserable first half of the evening by giving us a discount on the bill or offering free dessert. We were rather, quite shocked..that the tea we ordered was $7 for us to share a small pot with a single tea bad and absolutely no refill of water. I've paid less to drink loose leaf tea. I just felt so underwhelmed by both the food and service that my husband and I vowed not to come back and are glad we booked Thanh Long for our anniversary instead. The person who owns both establishments should be aware of how differently customers are being treated at both restaurants and should do something to change that quickly, if they want customers to ever return.\n\nSo folks, if you want roast garlic crab and garlic noodles, head over to PPQ's Dungenous Island or Thanh Long instead, otherwise, you and your date will not have a memorable experience.", "author": "Petra S."}

Not a single person got even half full and none of the food, honestly, was even \"good.\" You usually say quality or quantity at most places, this place had neither one. As I ate, I wondered why so many people were eating here. The crab was nothing but hot water, salt, and pepper. The fried race could have been prepared at home better, they forgot an order of food, and speaking of which, customer service was terrible. Considering we had to raise and wave our hands multiple times. Everyone was disappointed and got mad about the waste of time and money and it ruined everyone's night by eating here. Seafood from anywhere is served better, with more flavor, and larger portions, with better customer service. Garlic  Noodles were not worth it compared to claw shack or kickin crab and again, overpriced anyways.

When he first came to get our drink/wine order, he smelled of alcohol.  If you aren't working in a bar, you shouldn't be smelling of booze, especially when customers are there celebrating valentine's day.  When he came by to bring our appetizers, he then smelled of booze AND cigarettes.  \n\nAPPETIZER:  I had the corriander crusted ahi tuna salad.  It came with arugula.  I was not impressed.  I tried to give them the excuse that they prepped everything EARLY for the vday rush, but I could tell my tuna wasn't prepared fresh.  It seems like it was crusted the night before, frozen & then left to defrost the day of.  My arugula wasn't crisp and fresh; it was wilty like it had been sitting out for hours.\n\nENTRE:  Of course I got the roasted crab with garlic noodles.  This had made up for our stinky waiter and crappy appetizer.\n\nDESSERT:  I had the baked alaska.  It's a layered dessert with choc cookie on the bottom, ice cream, choc mousse, and meringue w/their immitation of a banana foster on the side.  I love ALL desserts, but there was nothing special or fancy about it.  And their banana foster was just sliced bananas with carmel drizzled on top.\n\nValentine's day was a prix fixe menu at $80.  With our wine it came to $320 by the end of dinner.  If you are a decent cook, surely you can make their roasted crab and garlic noodles at home.

I guess the thing to do is get the roast crab and garlic noodles - crab was moist and perfectly peppery flavored, noodles were overgarlicky, overbuttered, overcooked filler but very tasty. I feel like I ingested an entire stick of butter with dinner, and my hands are still slippery 2 days later. My capirinha was mediocre at best. My bf and his dad ordered a mai tai and they couldn't make it. huh? Would have thought that's a standard.\n\nI would say this is more of a special occasion place. Old school steakhouse meets Vietnamese seafood fusion. With British/foreign wait staff? Very odd combo. Very rude hosts.  Very dark. Very expensive. When the 5 of us were seated (ok, 20 mins late) we were told we MUST vacate the table by 9:15 for another reservation. Literally never been told that before. Don't come here as a walk-in; I heard them saying 60-90 min wait. \n\n4 stars for the food and cool experience of ripping apart a crab with my bare hands while wearing a plastic bib, but 2 for service so we'll just make it an even 3.

We take BART into the city and then jump on the trolley that takes us up the hill to our destination, that way we don't have to worry about parking in the city.

The outside flags are falling apart and the inside restaurant is in much need of renovation, but don't let that turn you away! \nThe crab and garlic noodles are out of this world! It gets messy with all the butter, so dont wear something that you care a lot about. They do give you the nice plastic bib to wear to protect yourself.

My wife recently took me for my birthday, and it was no exception - excellent.\n\nI have read many of the mixed reviews for this restaurant and I do see some of the points raised about various dishes not standing out, the service being poor on the weekends, and the cost. I will now weigh-in.\n\nThis is basically a roast crab and garlic noodle restaurant, and that's it. But that's what they are known for and that's all you need when you go there. Just order only those two items and nothing more and you will be rewarded with unbelievably tasty food that has stood the test of time for me over 15 years, always consistently excellent.  Actually, we also had some saut\u00e9ed snap peas this last visit and that was great too but I would never sit here writing a review recommending anything but crab and garlic noodles at the Crustacean.\n\nAbout the service. Just don't go on the weekend and you are fine. This restaurant is likely in guide books and a lot of tourists are sent here.  Go during the week when it is still busy but not crazy and it's fine.\n\nLastly, the cost. Crab is expensive, cost us $46 per crab. Sounds nuts right? However, guess what, PPQ charges THE SAME $46 and so does Thanh Long! It's like all the Vietnamese restaurants price fix the crab or something. The point is, PPQ may seem cheaper because they offer that dinner for two for $65 but they only give you ONE CRAB !!! So, Crustacean is not any more expensive.\n\nThe atmosphere of Crustacean is relaxed. The decor is certainly a bit dated but I feel relaxed when I go there and always, yes always come away satisfied because I know what to expect and they always deliver.", "author": "Doug C."}

I yelped it and there was mixed review which made me even more skeptical. We made reservations for dinner at 5pm and when we got there, it only took a few minutes before we got seated. We ordered the New Zealand Green Lip Mussels for appetizers and I must it was delicious. This appetizer consists of 5 crostini and 5 mussels in a delicious garlic and parsley butter. The mussels were perfectly cleaned too. For our main course we got the Roasted Crab and the Garlic Noodles. The two paired nicely together. The crab was cooked to perfection. The crab was rubbed with garlic and a spice blend that made the crab meat so flavorful but kept it light. As if the crab was not delicious enough you have the garlic and spice blend butter you can dip your crab in. I mean everythings better with butter right? The garlic noodles is one of the best I've had. It had a great amount of garlic but it didn't overwhelmed the dish. Now onto customer service. As i mentioned before there was no wait time when we got there. However I think a reservation would be best. We were seated quick and once we ordered, the food came out fast as well. Our waitress was wonderful! She came and checked up on us several time to fill our drinks but not so often that it was a bother. At the end of our meal she brought us hot towels to clean our hands.

Overall the food is good, her concern has to do with the fact that this, and other restaurants in S.F., are not giving us what we pay for... For example, we ordered a whole Dungeness crab, however, when the crab was served we notice that half of each cluster was missing.  The cluster is the upper (body) part of the crab where the legs attach, the choicest portions.\n\nIt appears that most of the restaurants specializing in crab, or at least the two we visited this weekend, make it a practice of taking these choice portions even though we pay for the entire crab.  It seems to me that this is dishonest and certainly unethical, especially considering that the crab cost nearly $50!\n\nI have one question for this, and all the other restaurants practicing or participating in this dishonest practice---is it worth it?  Are you willing to lose your customer base for the sake of a few extra dollars.  I assume that taking part of the crab provides them with the meat needed for their crab cakes and other crab based dishes... But why steal from your customers?", "author": "R. L."}

However, no matter how short the trip or where in the Bay Area I may be traveling to, I head to Crustacean for an order of the Tiger Shrimp which comes with MY MOST FAVORITE garlic noodles. If I only have the time for takeout then it's an order of the garlic noodles to go. \n\nSunday 4/13/14 I flew into SFO and headed out to Sausalito for a couple of days with the plan to head into the city at least once to indulge in a meal. I didn't make a few hours before I decided to cab in solo. I've read some of the more recent reviews and admit I had a few trepidations and yes, when I arrived the aging of the venue is very apparent. In terms of the interior d\u00e9cor-*shrugs* sure, it is dated and reminds me of many Asian restaurants in the city as well as in Seattle or London that look the same. I was greeted right away and while the restaurant was full as you would expect on a Sunday evening, I was able to get a seat in a smaller section. Eschewing anything else I ordered the tiger shrimp with garlic noodles and waited. It was perfect and once again the garlic noodles are addicting and literally what draws me back each and every time. My server was attentive without being intrusive, as they sometimes can be when someone is dining alone, and my water glass was never empty. \n\nI can't speak for others that dine there but I was pleasantly surprised that the food, which is what I was there for, was still as delicious as I recall.

The waiting sofa is nasty and stained. I mean why would you not put some of the money into making the restaurant looking nice?\n\nWe asked for bibs. They didn't give us one. However all the other tables got them. We ordered two crabs but apparently that's not enough crabs to afford us those cheap bibs. Even boiling crab gives us bibs for to-go orders. The customer shouldn't even have to ask for it. Service people, it's a lost art at these overpriced joints.\n\nThe \"live crab\" prices got us crab that is either dead or half dead as it tasted off. The waiter forgot about us for the second half of our dinner. Then get this, he gave us a bill with a charge for an extra bottle of wine. He tacked on an 18% charge for table of 6 or more then proceeded to give us a bill that stated that gratuity is not ncluded. After we complained about the overcharge he gave us a corrected bill with the same tip plus the same gratuity not included bill. How do you go from overcharge to corrected bill and yet the gratuity stays the same? Once we complained to the manager, they gave us a corrected bill that shows gratuity is included and the tip scaled with the prices. Obviously, the waiter added the gratuity as a line item rather than charge it as an automatic gratuity.\n\nThey obviously don't pay their waitstaff enough for them to resort to outright lying and cheating the customer.

We were not seated until all of our party arrived. The bar was small and really was trying to sell their hard liquor considering the choices. \n\nLooking at Dine about Town Menu, there was really only Prawns with Stir-fry noodles as a seafood choice in a seafood restaurant. Just something wrong with that. So I still ordered it while others spent the $37 for a crab. \n\nThe rice paper shrimp roll was a single spring roll made with salad shrimp chopped into 5 pieces. While the Skewed Chicken was 6 good pieces of chicken on 3 skewers. \n\nThe Shaken beef was stir-fried beef with teriyaki sauce, place in a plate surrounded by green beans and a few tomatoes. It came with a bowl of jasmine rice that I mistaken for mash potato, considering it was overcooked. \n\nThe Prawns with Stir-fry, look like shrimp chow mein. The whole plate had only 6 small prawns. \n\nThe last course was the fried banana with ice cream. The taste of the banana batter, one could tell that they have changed the oil in the fryer for awhile now. \n\nI had also ordered the Garlic Bread and it was just a few slices of a baguette covered in oil and butter, not a single taste of garlic for $2.50.\nA friend ordered the Garlic noodles. It was good, just not $9.95 good. \n\nOverall experience, I would not return to this place. Paying $37 for a cooked frozen crab is ridiculous.

Haven't been back for a while since we moved, but the place has gone REALLY downhill.  It started with a broken elevator, then wood paneling in the waiting area which still looks like it is being renovated.  The host never really greeted us, and after the meal never asked how everything was.  The waiter  was awful - never smiled, never came back to ask if we needed anything and was always out of the restaurant on smoke breaks.  We literally had to pull other waiters aside to ask for the basics like plates, more water, our check.  This is really disappointing because service there used to be excellent.\nThe food also seems to have changed.  It was decent, but the level of attention to detail was gone.  The mussels used to be more flavorful.  The vietnamese salad was too sweet.  The crab was so so with less meat (I give them a pass on that one since it has to be shipped from Oregon right now). We tried the shaken beef as well and it was terrible - the meat was overcooked and hard and the sauce was not tasty.\nVery disappointed that this restaurant has dropped in quality so much.  We were really looking forward to it after a few years, but it was not nearly as good as it used to be.

I hadn't visited in many years, and it was the first visit for my wife and our friend who joined us.  The first thing I can say about Crustacean is that you shouldn't judge this book by it's cover- it is located in a very old-school retail structure on the corner of Polk & California, and its appearance is a bit 'seedy'.  The structure conceals the restaurant hidden at the top, and perhaps even discourages the walk-up crowd- but don't let it scare you off.  My friend was pleasantly shocked by the inside of the restaurant after we entered from the elevator...\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is laid out in a sprawling and bizarre manner.  It's probably in need of a face-lift internally as well, but it's not too shabby.  Somewhere in the 'retro-chic' Asian fusion category, circa late 90s decor.  I'm not sure I even know what that means, but if you walked in, you would have a tough time categorizing it too.  Not romantic, not casual, just overall pleasant.\n\nAnyways, let's get to the food.  The menu is 'crustacean-heavy', the place is named Crustacean, so you're a damn fool if you go and order steak and say it sucks.   Go and order the Roasted Crab, get a side of garlic noodles, and you will be in absolute heaven.  This is what my wife and I did, and we couldn't have been happier.  \n\nThe whole dungeness was $40ea- pricey for sure, and there may be other restaurants (PPQ?) which can rival this in price, etc.  But the sauce it was bathed in was a true flavorful bliss- garlicky/salty/peppery seasoned paradise.  There are several varieties of whole crab on the menu- but it would be hard for me to try them as this one was such a winner.  As I cracked each crabby chunk from the shell, dunked and bathed it in the sauce, and stuffed my face- I couldn't remember an occasion that I had enjoyed a dungeness crab feast more than this.  Rewinding a bit- we ordered a lobster salad special, a corn chowder with crab meat, and an order of garlic bread- and while all were good (but not great)- they really were a waste of space which should have been exclusively dedicated to this delicious crab.  Our friend ordered a tiger prawn dish with garlic noodles- and while he enjoyed it - I know we were the big winners with our crab.\n\nDid I mention the crab was amazing?  :-) \nOne full crab was adequate for me for a feast- I finished it but was slowing down towards the end.  My wife couldn't finish it- she left a leg or two and was pushing herself.  The garlic noodles are 'required'- they are fabulous and a great compliment.  I can really see this restaurant being a 'one trick pony' for me in the future- where I go with the crab in mind, and don't/won't screw around with anything else.  No salads, apps etc.  Bring me the bib, bring my crab, and turn me loose.\n\nAnyways, I'm very happy to have revived my interest in Crustacean.  This would have been a 5-star experience if the crab was a bit cheaper and if the other appetizer/supporting dishes were a bit more exciting.  Needless to say, I will be back for sure.", "author": "Andy S."}

As usual, we took a few wrong turns and already knew we were running behind schedule. Our reservation was at 9pm, it was already 9:15pm and they close at 9:30pm. I had one of the girls call in to let them know we're on our way and we know we're late but we were coming from SJ, and to our surprise...the person on the phone said it was not a problem and that they will be waiting for us. Nice.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were greeted by the host who immediately knew it was us that called in. He smiled and took us to our table. There were still a few tables still dining and taking orders so we were left not feeling rushed at all upon deciding on what to order. I wanted to try so many things from the menu but between four girls, we ordered: salmon carpaccio, new zealand green lip mussels, seared ahi tuna, shaking beef, two roast crabs, and garlic noodles.

We had made reservations three days in advance for a party of three. At the time of making reservations there were multiple times open. Upon arriving at the restaurant one of our party members returned to the car due to feeling under the weather and still might have showed up later. Instead of seating us at a table big enough to accommodate 3 after letting them know of our situation they sat myself and the other member of our party at a small table for two. We explained the situation again to the hostess who refused to help, she was rude and had an attitude, not a friendly person like a hostess should be. She left us in mid sentence to grab her manager who told us the same thing. He offered to parade us through the restaurant to a bigger table in mid meal if our third member returned while we were eating. He was also very unaccommodating and quite rude. He also stated that they were over booked and could do nothing for us even though they should have had a table big enough for our requests considering our reservation. Like I said earlier there were many times open for reservation only days before and multiple vacant tables around us at 7:00pm, which causes me to doubt his sincerity and the ethics of the restaurant it's self. This service was awful and very disrespectful to a customer who would have spent over $100.00 a person. If I could give them a zero I would. I will make sure to advise any person I meet to stay away. Although the food is good (having been there before, with bad service then too) it is not worth the trouble or the insult to deal with the unaccommodating staff that work there.", "author": "Sean O."}

Over the years I've been only back three times because I would go to their sister restaurant Thanh long off Judah street, which is the same owner and same food. \n\nFor appetizers I've tried Tempura Style Coconut Prawns with a tangy orange-mustard sauce, & Crab Puffs minced dungeness crab meat marinated with a creamy cheese sauce wrapped in a wonton shell, served with a peanut-mustard sauce. \n\nDishes: Shaken Beef flamb\u00e9ed in Chardonnay, saut\u00e9ed green beans, cherry tomatoes and red onions. \n\nSteamed Seabass with scallions, asparagus, shitake mushroom and a ginger-citrus infusion \n\nThe Roast Crab an entire dungeness crab roasted to perfection with garlic and spices \n\nAn's Garlic Noodles egg noodles infused with An's famous garlic sauce \n\nI've had friends that went recently and told me it's not the same as when we first went. Has that ever happen to you where the food does not taste the same as before? I suggest if your craving for crab and garlic noodles go to PPQ in the Sunset district in SF.", "author": "Kathy V."}

Great tasting crabs (i got the roasted garlic crab) and the FAMOUS garlic noodles...both were very good but the downfall was the service......geez, our waiter (shoulda got his name) was so BLAH and at some points came off as rude, especially when he was heavily sighing when setting up our table when the food came. His service sounded FORCED and just ruined it for us. I dont know what happpened to him before he came into work (as we were one of the first tables seated), but it was obviously bad....or terrible. It reflected in his service and made our dining experience below what I was expecting from a fine dining restaurant like Crustacean. His helpers were friendly and nice.....he on the otherhand, total opposite. He really needed an attitude adjustment that day. He just really seemed like we were bothering him by coming in there to eat. UGH. If his service was better, i would have given 2 extra stars, but his service or lack of really brought my review down.", "author": "Aline D."}

We started off with drinks - I had a Mai Tai and it was perfectly made.  My friends drinks all looked great too, but I have a soft spot for Mai Tais.  Our appetizers included salt and pepper calamari (excellent, not always on the menu there but if you go I would ask them to make it), spring rolls, fried spring rolls, and papaya salad.  We had a few other things too, but I can't remember - they were all excellent though!  \nFor entrees we all shared:\n-An's Garlic Noodles - these were amazing! I was a little concerned that they would be overly garlicy, but not the case at all. The noodle quality was excellent and they were perfectly seasoned.  Like everyone else says, this is a 'must try!'\n-Helene's Ravioli - filled with shrimp in a creamy sauce, also excellent\n-Shaken Beef - very tasty, tender beef and great vegetables\n-Short ribs (daily special) - excellent as well, but I think the Shaken Beef was better... served with bok choi and rice\n-Steamed Seabass - great as well\nEverything was super tasty and like I said before, I can't wait to get back there - I will probably visit the Beverly Hills location next since I live in LA, but I just hope it's as good!

We went straight to the bar and had a drink while they got our table ready.  My girlfriend was thinking about getting the Drunken crab and the Roasted crab to half each one.  I told her that we should both get the Roasted crab.  The waiter explained that the Roasted crab was by far the most popular dish and that the Drunken crab wasn't that special.  I wish she would've explain more about the menu.  I like when the waiter goes into further detail of the menu and have to wipe the drool off my mouth when they are about finished.

This was an important deal I wanted our team to close, and we wanted to impress the customer.  House of Prime Rib?  Harris? Scoma?  Crustacean?  Luckily our customers suggested Crustacean before we gave them the choices.  It sure would not have been my choice.\n\nLotta glitz, lotta wow factor, lotta hype.  Too bad notta delivery.  Crustacean is the same restaurant as Than Long, just with higher caliber clientele and much steeper prices.  Their signature dish of Roasted Crab didn't thrill me; I was expecting the flavors to permeate through, but unless you sucked the shell, all you got was in essence steamed crab.  I wish they cracked the crab before they cooked it so the spices would have a chance to marry up with the crab.  Their other signature dish, garlic noodles, was overcooked and in time turned gummy.  A light toss in oil or wine would have kept the noodles from bunching up into a massive glob of wheat.  Saigon beef is pretty good but pricey at over $21 for an appetizer of about 8 pieces.\n\nWet napkins after our meal would have been a nice touch.

I opted for the shaken beef simply because the crab would have been too messy and too much work to eat for a wedding dinner.\n\nI'd have to say, that was probably the most flavorful beef dish I've had. The garlic noodle was good, though probably a bit too greasy for me, drenched in the garlic (and oily) sauce. I had a bite of the halibut, but was not a fan of it at all.  And I thought the mashed potatoes did not pair well with the halibut.  I'd be curious to try the drunken crab on another trip here, as it looked really indulgent. But it's going to be on a night where I'm ready to get my hands, and possibly, my clothes dirty.\n\nI looked at the prices for the beef and halibut dish...it is a little pricey for dishes you can get elsewhere that probably tastes the same, if not better. I would say, if you come here, try the crab and garlic noodles.  Forgo the halibut, as it wasn't worth $28.\n\nThe staff was nice, as they tried their best to squeeze by everyone in the tight space.

The location is perfect for downtown dwellers like myself, though the location is completely random and nestled on the third floor of what looks to be like an abandoned plaza.\n\nWe made reservations for our group of 7. They have all the essentials like the other restaurants: dungeness crab and garlic noodles.\n\nWe were strategic in buying one crab each:  tamarind, roasted garlic, drunken. We tasted each to determine which to order. It was unanimous at the tamarind crab had the most flavor in the sauce, some ordered two more of those. The crabs each had a lot of meat. Dip into sauce. Delicious. The garlic noodles were also great: we ordered at least 3 since the plate it came on was kind of small.\n\nI can say that our server was kind of a grouch when we first met him and didn't smile or want to serve us at all, but as the night went on he warmed up a little bit. I wish they didn't include 18% for mediocre service, but whatever. I still think thanh long and PPQ are better in terms of quality (and decor). But be prepared to spend at least $50 each easy (without alcohol included). Each person can probably eat their own crab, which runs at $43 a pop. \n\nI'll stick to PPQ in terms of price.

So me and my guests order the same ... Crab cracked and pulled. So, the waiter comes\nback about 10 minutes later setting up crab cracking utensils. We asked him directly why he was setting those on our table ??? Since we orders ours cracked and pulled. ?.? He says to us ,it's cause they make him do it ?? So we didn't think much. Then our crab comes out.....  Crab cracked ? NO! Crab pulled NO! as pleas hold butter on side...NO AGAIN!! . So in a nice manner I ask the waiter why is this ALL wrong ? Not even one part of our order is right . He does not say one word goes and grabs a manager who come to our table and says to me and my guest (with the worst possible attitude) \"well you want these cracked and pulled its going to be 45 minutes to a hour!\" At that point I felt totally mistreated!! 1 hour to pull 2 crabs ?! Being that the restaurant was only 20% capacity or less this might even made it seem more insulting. So let's say they took our crab back and cracked and pulled it ,as well...

Since I didn't have reservations, the host seated us in the \"loud\" people section. And because there were only two of us, we were seated in the aisle (a half table) against the wall next to the waiter's water pitcher refill station. \n\nEnvironment: The other customers were super loud and made a lot of ruckas. Because we were in the aisle, the waiters swiftly walked by our table like some 20 times. At one point, my fork fell on the ground and I was hesitant to reach down for it for fear of being stepped on by a waiter. \n\nFood: Ordered the specialty crab and garlic noodles. Crab seemed not fresh. Like it was cooked earlier and then after I put in the order, it was cooked in the garlic butter. Typically, Asian restaurants cook their crustacean fresh (i.e. like out of the tank fresh). When a crab is cooked fresh, crab meat texture quality is much more fine. This one tasted like rubber. I was really disappointed. I had hoped for better. The noodles were a great disappointment too--they were too soft and dry. We asked for additional garlic or sauce, and the host said that the sauce was not possible because the noodle was reboiled in the sauce and then removed. We thought.. weird..but explains why the noodles are overcooked. \n\nWaitress/Waiters: Our waitress was ok. Not that attentive. Our drinks ran out and so we try to order more. Our waitress didn't come by that often and all the other waiters kept passing by (like a foot from our table) and deliberately ignored us (even when we waived at them). We finally got a waiter to stop for split second--in which we said we'd like more drinks. That waiter went and told our waiter. Then, our waiter made her way back to us and repeated to us what we had told the other waiter. The funny thing was that she kept asking if we wanted anything else because all we ordered were crab and noodles. What I wanted to tell her but held back was, \"this table you have me seated in only fits two plates--if I had more room, I might consider ordering--but I'm too disappointed to continue eating here.\" Overall...

I also couldn't finish it so I made him eat the rest (our waiter said that each crab was 2 - 2.5 lbs). He had no complaints.\n\nMake sure to spend a good 2 hours here for a complete meal. The crab takes a while to prepare and takes even longer to eat.\n\nSince it was his birthday, they gave him a fried banana with a candle for free. I didn't want to feel left out so I got the baked Alaska. Both were good and even though my fiance shared his with me, I didn't share mine.\n\nOur waiter was really sweet and attentive too. He kept refilling our waters even when they were only like half full.  \n\nCrab that night was $42/each and with the appetizer, sides, dessert and my fiance's martini, the bill came out to $160. Not bad since I was planning on spending more fo the old fart's special day.

However, we decided to go with only 1 DAT order, and two crabs.  Lucky for us that we did!  The DAT menu was just not worth it in any way!  The three of us being Vietnamese, we were appalled at the menu \"Vietnamese fusion.\"  Reasons being:\n\n- They featured spring rolls and chicken skewers as appetizers when you can get them better for $2 at any hole in the wall.  \n- The main course was  listed as \"stir fry shrimp on An's famous garlic noodles.\"  Pfffftt!  It would have been more appropriately named \"Garlic noodles with 5 shrimp\" (see uploaded picture).  \n- An order of their \"famous\" garlic noodles are $9 for a tiny bowl of chow mein noodles cooked in butter and garlic!  \n- The crab was fresh and soft, but still done wrong!  The tamarind crab wasn't quite right (too many spices clashed with the tamarind sauce), and their specialty roasted crab was too salty and dripping in oil... and not the good way (see uploaded pictures).\n- At least you can't really mess up fried bananas... right?\n\nWe tried giving Vietnamese fusion yet another chance at Crustacean, and all three of us agreed it was not worth the $120 bill.  They only get an extra star because we asked for our crab heads \"dirty\" (with all the guts in it), and the waiter saw how much we enjoyed it and brought us two more heads!  :)  \n\nNote: They have a dress code, and they will make you borrow a shirt from them or take off whatever offending items you are wearing, so come at least a little dressed up.", "author": "Carol L."}

Started it off nice, I love Thanh long, the swamp, ppq dungeness, the crab house etc.., so I though why not celebrate in the heart of my city?!? We were seated promptly, and it took a few minutes to get noticed by our waiter. He came over was very pleasant, took down our order, and even made a few suggestions. Brought out our champagne & had some trouble with opening the bottle... Then brought out two salads (1 we had ordered the other we were confused by) and hurried off... Then about 20 minutes later we caught his attention and he looked puzzled. We informed him we had ordered two more appetizers and he looked embarrassed. Hurries off and had no idea the food had been \"sitting at the pickup window THE WHOLE TIME.\" He quickly tried to clean up the mix up by saying he has them making a new order at no charge. Great! By then it had been an hour since we had been seated and we still had nothing but the salads and champagne. Now I'm hungry and agitated! Where is my crab?!? Ok now I see my crab!! Yippee!! But wait it gets better.. The server questions who has this crab and I politely nod that I do!!! Then he hands me the plate filled with hot garlic butter oils and crab while it was HOT WITH NO WARNING OR HEADS UP. I panicked when I realized it was hot and didn't see a good place to set it down at and the plate tipped and hot oil spilled all over my legs  they tried explaining that the waiter was having stomach issues or what not but it just was a terrible experience.

The exterior of the restaurant was somewhat dingy, but the inside gives the impression that you'll be in for a fine dining experience, that is, until you see patrons with greasy faces donning plastic bibs and getting their hands dirty.  But that could only mean one thing - the food must be damn good. \n\nOur party of five ordered a crab each plus one and shared a couple orders of garlic noodles, a lobster roll, Vietnamese carpaccio, papaya salad with calamari, and some other appetizer I can't seem to remember.  The starters were pretty good but nothing extraordinary.  BF also had the overpriced $20.95 shaken beef which was comparable in taste and quality to what casual Vietnamese restaurants put out for less than half the price.  The crab, however, was excellent.  Everyone opted for the roast crab while I broke away from the norm and ordered a tamarind crab - both were delish, but the former takes the cake.  And I will note that the crab here was lighter in flavor and more amenable to repeat meals than the heavier, deep-fried crab I had from PPQ a few weeks earlier.

I had the drunken crab, which is simmered in a blend of 3 wines (hence the name), and my girlfriend had the tamarind style, which was tasty, but very rich and messy. Both dishes were outstanding in there own ways. The crabs themselves were enormous, and it was very easy to get to the big chunks of meat. The dungeness is priced daily, and quite expensive, but well worth it if you're a fan.\n\nWe also had salmon carpaccio and seared ahi tuna for appetizers. Both were intensely flavorful and satisfying. The tuna is served with arugula and a blend of two Vietnamese sauces, while the salmon is also served with arugula and capers. They have a good wine list and some special cocktails as well.\n\nThey missed out on the fifth star because it was obvious to our party that several other tables had been served their food before us, despite having ordered after us.

The dress code is business casual or dressy if you prefer to dress up to eat dinner.  The restaurant is very clean and the service was superb.

I really appreciated her professionalism and friendly attitude. \n\nShe recommended the salt and pepper calamari that is featured every so often on their menu. It was so good! The calamari was very tender and had just enough crunch to it. The calamari was accompanied by a delicious sauce that made the calamari taste even more flavorful. \n\nThe boyfriend and I both ordered their roasted crab and garlic noodles and let me say the crab definitely fulfilled my craving. The crab was so succulent and savory. I was in heaven! I loved the flavors and how fresh the crab tasted. The crab was definitely the star tonight.

Just a tad bit on the oily side, but very tasty and left me wanting a little bit more.  \n\nGarlic Noodles - Awesome as well!  \n\nThese two items are a must.  Some people have written reviews on how this was a lot to finish, but I went with 4 other people, and 3 of us ordered this meal..it was just fine.  It's not too much at all.

Laid back with dim lighting. The booths were super comfy. Staff was quick and friendly. I started with the seared Ahi tuna which frankly was the best part of my meal. I also ordered one of their infused cosmos which was way to sweet and had to return it back to the bar and just opted for the house chardonnay. \n\nWe then got our main course which was the full crab. I've never had crab in my life. No one told me how messy it was! I tried my best to look cute while getting my fingers all dirty and saucy from the garlic butter sauce and cracking the legs and what not. The meat was great- a little rich near the end I couldn't make it to the finishing the whole thing. It came with these garlic noodles which I could only have about 5 bites full of. It tasted exactly like garlic bread but in pasta. It was amazing. \n\nWhat bothered me was there was only one effing bathroom. Although we came rather early for dinner (6:45-7ish) there was a line of 6 people in front of me. What the hell is that?! When walking into this place is seems like a very nice establishment- I would think there would be more than one stall. \n\nI glanced at the bill - a hefty price for a dinner that honestly didn't WOW me.

I had no idea this place was going to look as nice as it did, almost seemed out of place for Polks st! Our bartender Fisel (Hope I spelled it correctly?) greeted us and offered to make whatever our hearts desired. In our case it was two \"Hangar One\" vodka martinis dry with lemon twists. I asked him about the infamous dishes and he explained the garlic noodles were the best and also the roasted crab. We decided to get one of each and split it. The crab was roasted whole and brought out on a large dish with a couple bowls for the shells. Another assistant helped us with our bibs because apparently eating this crab was going to be a bit messy!? \n\nI wanted to wash my hands before eating and Fisel read our minds, he brought out two very hot/wet towels so no need to leave our seats. Our large roasted crab and generous serving of garlic noodles were brought out with plenty of napkins and two crab crackers to help break the shells, bon appetit! The crab was meaty, cooked perfectly and moist and worked well with the garlic noodles.\n\nAfter this delicious meal Fisel brought out two bowls of hot water, a couple of cloth napkins so we could clean up; nice touch.\n\nWould  I go back?

My entire family loves seafood but I tend to refrain from those entrees during dinner.  My colleague persuaded me that crab was a must @ a restaurant acclaimed for their special recipe.  And with that, the waiter came over to tie a plastic bib around my neck.\n\nWhen my plate arrived, the crab was already 'cracked' so that I wouldn't have to fight w/the shell too much and my first bite was AMAZING.  The succulent meat was wonderfully seasoned with the garlic & butter....My mouth is watering now, as I think about that delicious meal...we also ordered a side of garlic noodles which were thick and seemed really heavy compared to the crab but were just as tasty.  I didn't finish my entire crab and decided to get it wrapped so I could give it to homeless person downtown.

This place is not romantic in the slightest way.  \nOur server was fine, although when I asked him what came with the crab and he said nothing but the crab for $40 and I changed my mind, he became a little distant like I was low class because I didn't want to pay $40 for just a crab. \nI ordered the miso ginger beef cubes.  They were hard and dry and so saltly I needed a glass of water with each bite.  The green stuff in the middle of plate was crusty and old and stuck together too much to eat.  The only good thing on the plate was the bok choy and I don't even like leafy vegtables, but it was the only thing not soaked in salt or too dry to eat.\nThey charge for refils on sodas and the glasses are so small.  \nMy boyfriend ordered the royal tiger prawns and he said there used to be 6 and now there are only 4 on the plate and they weren't even good.  I may be use to Red Lobster where they just give you butter with every dish, but this place you have to ask for butter. \nWe were so displeased that we didn't even want to look at the desert menu.

I might order a vegetable side dish, just to say I ordered something healthy... but I have to have the Crab (hopefully with a LOT of garlic butter, pepper, etc). I order The Crustacean Fried Rice just to dump into the Crab Shell to sop up their special sauce after I've consumed the Crab meat. That's the only purpose of the Fried Rice or just plain Rice! I might have a couple of beers along with the Crab, but I really don't care what I'm drinking when I'm consuming this Crab! DON'T BOTHER ME ONCE I GET STARTED ON THE DUNGENESS CRAB!\n\nI am a total embarrassment to myself and others with me when I eat at The Crustacean!  One table napkin is NOT enough. Once you get started consuming this Crab, you're going to need a pile of napkins to clean up your mess! You're aware of the warm water and lemon concoction used to clean yourself up after a meal? It doesn't work! No matter how many bowls you ask for.\n\nI've tried other Vietnamese restaurants in San Francisco, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, etc. NO other Vietnamese restaurant can make Dungeness Roast Crab like The Crustacean! IMO, any other Vietnamese Dungeness Crab dish is a faint facsimile of the Crab at the Crustacean! I LOVE THIS PLACE!\n\nI especially like the tiered seating (in the back) where, no matter where you are seated, any table can have a view out onto Polk Street. The view is especially nice at night! But, who's looking at anything but their Crab!\n\nThe run down neighborhood around Polk, where The Crustacean is located belies the trendy mod Euro Asian atmospheric theme after you enter.

Sometimes it's just good to sit for a long meal and get ridiculously stuffed. Everyone on the table ordered a whole crab. You could pick which sauce the crab seeped in. I chose the garlic butter and David chose the one with a wine based broth.  \r\n\r\nI give it five stars because it was finger licking good. Of course we didn't pick up the tab and if we did I might be way more critical, so keep that in mind as you continue to read on.   The calamari was nicely fried and not too much coating. The spring rolls and coconut shrimp were good, but the papaya salad with octopus is the best appetizer of the four we ate.\r\n\r\nThe crab in butter gets cold if you don't eat fast but it was tasty since the salt, pepper and garlic is added on top so you don't have to be dipping anything. Oh and you have to get all of your hands involved in this one, two fingers ain't going to cut it.  The one in the wine broth was okay.\r\n\r\nThe garlic noodles are really really tasty that even after a whole crab you can still eat the noodles. . .it's that tasty.\r\n\r\nThe desserts weren't anything out of this world, but nicely prepared and decent.\r\n\r\nOverall the wait staff was very attentive.

A friend put it well when she said, \"they want you to get all dressed up and then give you ridiculous plastic bibs?\"\n\nThe table next to us... an older group of folks were given royal treatment for some reason... the manager even came out to greet them. \n\nOur server, when taking our picture, made a slightly rude comment (I hope he didn't mean it, but I'll leave that for you all to judge), \"Okay, now open your eyes guys!\"..... seriously? \n\nGreat food.

However, either my taste has grown more refined or the quality here has broken down. I suspect the latter, as I've been out of the loop for a while. \n\nWe had a bunch of small plates along with the famous garlic noodles and the drunken crab. Yes, I am aware The Roast is what they are famous for. However, my date chose otherwise, despite the waiter's repeated prodding, so I backed her up. Later on, my date scolded me joking that I was supposed to step in and choose the \"right\" one. Because you ladies never know what you want, right? *duck* Just kidding!\n\nHere were my thoughts:\n\nRice Paper Shrimp Roll - I saw \"green mango\" and I could not resist. I've had green mango in my Fantasia drinks, but never with real food, so I was intrigued. Big mistake, this tasted exactly like a spring roll you find at any vietnamese sandwich shop. No green mango taste whatsoever.\n\nSeafood Cakes - did not realize it was just a triangular fishball/fishcake. Nothing special here.\n\nLobster Roll - could not taste the lobster, the rich cream/cheese overpowered everything.\n\nVietnamese Carpaccio - I liked this a lot because any raw beef is good beef =) however, my date casually commented that she'd make me this in 10 min at home and it would be just as good, if not better.\n\nGarlic noodles - the garlic taste was unique, but the noodles were mushy and stuck together. There really isn't anything special about this dish in my opinion. \n\nDrunken Crab - crab is delicious plain, so it's pretty hard to mess this up. It wasn't overcooked, the sauce was ok, overall pretty tasty.\n\n\nI don't mean this to be a scathing review, but I just don't think this place is up to par with what you'd expect from a $$$ establishment. I do think they were better from what I remembered the first time I visited. However, their service is good, which is something you should never take for granted.", "author": "alan w."}

I always look at it and wonder what it is like inside. Of course I have heard from others who have gone here how yummy it is and thought what is the draw? It is an odd looking place from the outside in a weird building. A funny little place if you ask me. \n\nFirst you arrive and there are two valets outside near the elevator. You walk up the little path and enter the waiting area. It is decked out in clay pots, bamboo and a waterfall with soothing music. A nice atmosphere while you wait for your chariot to the shrine above. \n\nEnter the glass elevator and turn around for a view of ...Polk Street....not exactly an oasis. The elevator cracks me up. It belongs on the side of a hi-rise building but I will say it works and does add to the experience. Chariot doors open and you are in another tropical oasis as you make your way around and greeted immediately by your host. \n\nWhat happy host. He made you know you were welcome there and with the utmost sincerity. He brought us around to the first room, where he was going to seat us but there was not a soul in the room. I think that room was for larger parties. Very nicely appointed but it was so remote. Bring me to the bar I say! \n\nOff we go to the next room with the bar and stairs going up to another level and a back room that was very lively and inviting. We chose tables across from the bar which was perfect. \n\nOur waiter was just lovely. He was so nice and quick and unobtrusive but attentive. He recommended the special calamari that was lightly battered and deep fried with pepper and salt crust and sauteed peppers and onions with a yummy spice aioli sauce. it was amazing! We got a bunch of small plates: coconut prawn, Vietnamese salad, crab puffs and tuna. All were yummy but the tuna was just too much. It was spicy, the arugula was spicy the sauces were spicy it was not a good experience. \n\nWe can't end on that note so let us have some Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e . Ah redemption. It was amazing. I judge a Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e by the texture of the sugar crust and if there are little vanilla beans in the bottom of the dish.

I loved every morsel, from beginning to end. \n\nWhat is better than sex?\n\nTwo weeks of Dine About Town!http://www.onlyinsanfrancisco.com/taste/dineabouttown/\n\n\nAs a big foodie, we were counting down the days to this major event. Our first restaurant on our list is: Crustacean!!!\nSince the 3 course meal is $34.95, their menu is very limited. I was a tad disappointed when I called to ask for their Dine About Town menu. Everyone and their mom told me to get the Roast Crab and Garlic Noodles, but that wasn't on the menu. Instead, your choices are:\nFor Starters:\n~Fresh Rice Shrimp Roll with Peanut Sauce\n~Skewered Chicken\n~Vietnamese Salad\nFor the Entree:\n~Shaken Beef with Jasmine Rice\n~Prawns with Garlic Noodles\nLast but not least, dessert:\n~Fried bananas a la mode\n~Orange Sherbert\n\nFor appetizers, we got the Fresh Shrimp on a rice paper roll and the Skewered Chicken. The peanut sauce that came with it had the perfect taste for a dipping sauce-not too peanut-y nor salty. Just right.\nThe skewered chicken was marinated and the meat was tender, you know, those fall off the bones type of thing. It definitely got my approval!\nFor our entree, we both got the Prawns with Garlic Noodles. I don't want to be redundant and I'm sure you all know that they are known for the garlic noodles, but let me tell you...(AGAIN) You HAVE to order their Garlic Noodles! It was amazing! Whatever they're doing in the kitchen, they are definitely doing it right!\nFor dessert, we both got the fried bananas a la mode. I've had numerous fried bananas and this one definitely was one of the best. The bananas were gooey and piping hot, the outside was crispy, and the vanilla ice cream cooled off my mouth from the hot, gooey bananas. \nEverything was perfect from beginning to the end. The service was stellar-We had a 7:30 reservation, but got there around 7:00 and they seated us right away. Our dishes came so quickly and methodically-our server Joel was always there and never abandoned us.As soon as we were finished with our entree, he didn't leave time for our stomach to growl for our next course-the food came out right away and our water was always re-filled.\nWhen we got our check, the General Manager introduced himself and asked if the service met our expectations, and it sure did. \nI can't wait to celebrate another anniversary here,maybe my birthday in July, a promotion, or anything for that matter! Next time, I'm definitely ordering The Roast Crab! The poor guy next to me ordered one and I couldn't help staring at his dish. My poor date definitely didn't get my full attention that night! LOL\n\nPS, I want to give a shout out to the retro looking elevator with a giant bright crab that goes up and down....and up and down...and up and down...", "author": "Jojo N."}

This place is as Don King would say, Splendivarous! Yes the dress code is a bit annoying but who cares. Why don't you grow up and look like an adult for once and leave the jersey and rocker tees at home??? The hosts are a bit stuffy but the servers have for the most part been very cheery and responsive. I have visited this location maybe 10-12 times in the past 2+ years and maybe only one time was the service sub par. \n\nLets just talk about the food here.  If you have something against buttery oily goodness please stop reading now and tend to your rice cakes. The rumors and raves are true, the garlic noodles here is like food from heaven. I haven't tasted better, period. The roasted crab is fantastic! Maybe slightly too salty for some but its not overboard and I'm not someone who loves salty foods. And God-forbid you have to do some work to crack your own food. Have we gotten that lazy as a people? Maybe you'd like someone to chew it for you also? Cracking the crab is part of the whole experience! That leads me to another point. This does get a bit messy so it might not be a good place for a 1st date. \n\nOther dishes that a fantastic are the Royal Tiger Prawns (which includes a side of garlic noodles). I can't comment on further main courses b/c there is ZERO reason to order anything else. Roast Crab, Tiger Prawns, Garlic Noodles. Eat and repeat. End of story.\n\nIf you'd like to explore the starters, the appetizers are great too though a bit on the small side. My favs are the salt and pepper calamari (the waiter will tell you its a special, but its been on \"special\" since '07), crab puffs, jumbo prawn wontons and salmon shrimp crisps. \n\nMake reservations if you are attempting to go on Friday or the weekend w/ a party of 3 or more it does get packed. Better call a week in advance just to guarantee your spot. Side note: they won't seat you unless all your party is there and will only hold reservations for 15 mins past your scheduled time.

Atmosphere is upscale, but what turns it into a regular visit instead of a fancy shcmancy one  is when people do not act accordingly and bring down the atmosphere and integrity of the place. Honestly I'd rather go to Thanh Long just cause the atmosphere is very different. You can never go wrong with garlic especially on noodles and crab! Drinks are really good, but it depends on which bartendar makes your drink. The service can also be hit or miss here. One day the service will be up to par and enjoyable, especially when the server has personality. Then other times the service sucks, you just have someone that's serving you who hates life, rarely checks up on the table, and have to wave down because they are hiding to text on their phone. Pretty much you see the bussers more than the server.

After looking around, I saw that Crustaceans was located at the top of this building which had a lot clothing shops. Once we got inside, the place was really quiet and dim. It was dinner time and not that many people were there. The staff was really nice and attentive. The funny thing was that the interior was decorated nicely, but there were huge windows that gave view to the unattractive buildings across the street. There's nothing romantic about that and it's a shame because this place is definitely a date restaurant. \n \nSo about the menu...  I had the Dine About Town menu. Started off with chicken skewers. It was tender, juicy, and the lemongrass was flavorful. Next up was the Stir Fried Prawns on a bed of garlic noodles. The prawns were okay. Nothing different from any other prawns I've had at a mom and pop Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant. The garlic noodles reminded me of chow mein noodles that you'd get at a fast food joint. My friend got the Shaken Beef and that was really good. Dessert was delcious! We had fried banana al la mode and orange sorbet. The sorbet was incredibly satisfying and refreshing. The sorbet was frozen in a peeled orange. So clever!  Overall, this place was okay. I don't think any of the food was special or unique for the price you'd have to pay.  I have yet to try the infamous crab, so I'll come back one more time just to try that out. \n\np.s. I don't know why they require a dress code! No t-shirts for guys. Really???

We were seated promptly, but near the waiters hang out spot (didn't really need to know the details of his late date.) They accommodate families, so feel free to bring your kids here. If you don't like kids, be specific in your request in your reservation.\nYes, the crab is messy. You do have to crack it yourself.

She's a huge crab lover, so we knew this would be a nice treat. The Chef sent out two complimentary appetizers: One was the Tempura Shrimp Coconut Prawns with a tangy/sweet orange sauce and the other was their perfectly fried Calamari. My mom also filled up with the Lobster Salad which was also quite good. For the main event, we had 2 Roasted Crabs and 2 bowls of their famous Garlic Noodles to share. The only noise at our table was the sound of shell cracking and me saying \"mmm....mmm.....mmmmm\". \n\nTowards the end of our meal, my mom was dipping her finger in the plate of garlic oil which our Roasted Crab was sitting in. All of a sudden she says \"Aha, I know the secret!...I figured out how they make their crab so good!\" She said they remove the crab fat, which is the orange paste-like fat inside the crab shell and cook it together with garlic and oil. I didn't doubt it for one second. My mom's a true detective for this sort of stuff. No wonder they served the crab without the crab fat inside. \n\nThat said, you MUST leave your cholesterol concerns at home and go in here with an \"I only live once\" type attitude.

We actually arrived maybe 20-30min ahead of our reservation, but they still sat us after waiting about 5 min!\n\nThe dining area was pretty packed and we got seated at a booth with an additional chair set at the edge (we had a party of 5). Frankly, I don't know why they didn't just seat us at a round table which was only a few feet away that seated 6 people. Our table felt cramped enough AND I was literally back to back with the person at the next table. \n\nOn to the food! We ordered a couple of appetizers.. the calamari special (just pepper and salt) and  mushroom spring roll. Both were alright, my mom liked the calamari a lot. As for entrees, i checked yelp (yay!) for recommendations. The waiter and yelpers both exclaimed about the roast crab & garlic noodles so I HAD to try! Mom got the crab cakes, Dad got the sea bass, one of my sisters got the halibut and my other sister got the garden veggie plate. I agree with everyone that the garlic noodles are so good! It's definitely coated with garlic flavor that I'm sure made my breath smell awesome. As for the crab, kinda disappointed it it. I mean it was HUGE so portion wise was good for the amount it cost but taste wise, it could have been better. We ordered three desserts to share: creme brulee, chocolate bread pudding and fried bananas. Desserts were alright, nothing spectacular. \n\nOverall, experience was alright. My parents appreciated the meal and we were all extremely full. The waiter was pretty attentive although the way he presented him self was a little off (maybe he was nervous or just started working there??)

(Little did I know this was going to be the theme for the evening!) Then we had the seared Ahi. It was dry, no sheen or glisten on the \"raw\" center. Strange and tasteless. We followed that with the Crab Puffs. Didn't even taste crab in them...just a cream cheesy goop. We wanted to finish off the meal with our favorite (well used to be) roasted crab and tiger prawns. The crab was seriously DRENCHED in butter...so much so that my husband looked like he should have been hosed off after digging through for the small morsels of crab. The towels, yes very hot, but there was no way they could absorb the amount of butter coming off that crab. My husband was all shiny (greasy) afterwards. Needed to head to the bathroom for a wash down...oh wait more on THAT later. The tiger prawns were so over cooked I could not get them out of the shells..the prawns ripped and tore apart, but no pieces to eat. The garlic noodles did NOT taste like garlic...and I don't know if it was oil, butter, or both, but they were greasy and tasteless. \n\nOkay, so now to the restroom situation. The restrooms were \"OUT OF ORDER\". Seriously! Both the men and women's. We were required to use the \"basement\" (their word not mine) restrooms. I can not even describe how disgusting the restroom was. So, through the rain, escorted to a dirty, filthy restroom was the way we ended our time at Crustacean. Overall, one of THE worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I will never go back!", "author": "Brenda B."}

With it being my birthday, the anh family restaurants came up when he asked me where I wanted to go. We narrowed it down to the two, but when Grandma said she would babysit the baby, Crustaceans became the obvious choice. \n\nThe location is nice, very dimly lit and romantic for the occasion so its perfect for any date night for you and yours, but the food didn't blow me out of the water. The food was tasty, we ordered: fried calamari, shaken beef, garlic noodles & garlic crab. Each was good in it's own right, but I don't feel like it lived up to the hype. Typically these days having a newborn at home, the fact that we get to go out at all, the restaurant becomes an instant hit, but we've gotten a few date nights in since having our son, and this one though among the fancier restaurants we've been to isn't at the top. I would say that Crustaceans is one of those restaurants you should go to to say you've been, but isn't somewhere you'll be begging to come back to. Honestly I think the expectations were set so high for this restaurant, and with the restaurants reviews being so good that even after we both agreed it was just okay, I feel like maybe we'll have to give it another chance.

The SF location is slightly difficult to reach (it's on a hill), but at least they have valet parking.  You have to take an elevator to get to the restaurant, and they have an indoor and outdoor (covered) seating area.\n\nI like the food at the SF Crustacean slightly more than the food at the Beverly Hills Crustacean.  However, the decor of the Beverly Hills location is much more beautiful.  (They have a dimly lit front dining area with draped booths, a glass walkway/fish tank, another dining area in the middle which is much more crowded, and an upstairs dining area which is quieter and more suited for couples).  From my experience, I think the SF location is quieter overall.  But I guess it really depends on when you go.\n\nGreat food, great service, what more can you ask for?  Make reservations, there's a dress code, and it's pricey.  But, it's kind of worth it once in a while.  The only downside of this place is they can be a little snobby to you if you aren't old and middle aged.\n\nEdit: 6/26/08 - I'm giving the San Francisco location an extra star for the superb service I received the last time I was here.  I took \"the guy I'm like dating or whatever\" here for his birthday, and they were absolutely wonderful.  He loved it :)  We ordered the shrimp toast (I think the ones at the Beverly Hills location were better), the lobster rolls (mmm drool!), the roasted crab & the garlic noodles (delish as usual), and the creme brulee (light and creamy, a perfect way to end the meal).  It was a truly wonderful dining experience.  \n\nThe Beverly Hills location still receives 4 stars for being snooty to my friends and I.\n\nDon't forget to make reservations!", "author": "Grace C."}

The acoustics are ridiculous because I could hear every detail of the restaurant staff, while it was next to impossible to listen to my own dining party.  The staff was discussing some type of disciplinary action for a work transgression.

No one can replicate that oh so delicious garlic noodles\n\nRecommendations:\n- Tamarind Crab if you want something sweet and tangy. Beware - it's super saucy but super good!\n- Garlic Crab is always a simple favorite\n- Garlic noodles (your breath will still feel garlicy the next day - don't try eating this before a job interview or something)\n- I think their food menu is EXACTLY the same as Thanh Long.  I'd rather go to Crustacean because the location and atmosphere is better", "author": "Kathy D."}

Our waiter was super nice, but he seems preoccupied with the other tables and we were only trying to get more drinks.  In my head, more drinks = higher tab = bigger tip?  Sad to read that some of the waiters here say you should get one crab/garlic noodle order per person.  Since I've been to Thanh Long, I know that's not the smart move.  You can easily share one crab and garlic noodle order and be super satisfied.  I do give credit to the lobster salad we ordered, that dish was on point!  The bar/server messed up on one of my drinks, but I drank it anyways because bottom line, it's alcohol.  When I told the server, there was no apology, he just went on his happy way to get me another one and charge it.  Fail.  When it came around to ordering desserts, my boyfriend and I opted for the Baked Alaska because not many places make this AND this is my fave dessert hands down.  The dessert came out and I was expecting the hot meringue to be a yummy contrast against the vanilla ice cream inside!  The meringue was cold.  Wait, what?  Total disappointment.  Their desserts seem to come fresh from the....FREEZER. \n\nCrustacean, I'm giving you one star for the crab and another for the garlic noodles.

After sitting there a half hour, having ordered my food, I was ready to leave.  Call it instinct, but I knew after perusing the place a bit that nobody really seemed to be enjoying their meals.\n\nAnyway, it was my first time there, so I figured I'd go for something cheap and usually delicious at other restaurants...crusted tuna.  Pretty hard to get that wrong right?  Besides, nothing else on the menu sounded appetizing and most items were unnecessarily smothered with butter in their description.  \n\nWell, the tuna arrived and was very disappointing.  4 thin slices, about half the thickness of carved Sashimi for twice the price.  I decided to forget the pricing aspect of it, and had a taste.  Nothing special.  I don't know what they breaded the crusted portion of the tuna with, but it didn't add anything but texture, and in fact tasted a bit like cardboard.\n\nWe were there with a bunch of midwesterners who perhaps didn't know GOOD seafood, so they were all way too content.

Normally we go to Thanh Long in the outer Sunset, but now that we live in Nob Hill Crustacean seemed more practical. Unfortunately, it's just not the same. \n\nCriticisms:\n-The crab was cold! While cold crab is easier to eat (meat separates from shell easier), it tasted weird. If you roast something recently, it shouldn't be cold. So my guess is that our crab was cooked before and pan fried with the butter stuff when we ordered it. \n-Fried rice was worse than Thanh Long. The chicken had no seasoning, so it took on a gross gamey taste.   \n-Shaken Beef had an off texture, almost like a moister version of beef jerky.\n\nThe good news is that the garlic noodles (my fav) tasted the same as usual.

I am a very picky person, especially when it comes to food, service, ambiance and prices. Although a bit pricey, it is well WORTH it. It is a little difficult to find the place, since it's up above on a second floor building. it's definitely out of no where. The great thing about it, is that they offer valet parking (since San Francisco is soooo difficult on finding parking). \n\nNow on to the menu...My favorite is the tamarind crab and garlic noodles. Usually the garlic noodle is enough to share between two people, but i always order my own because the garlic noodles are so delicious and full of flavor! i once had my friend to-go me 2 orders of garlic noodles and bring it back to San Jose for  me. hah! The Pepper calamari was also very tasteful. Some might think that it's a bit salty, but i love salty fried foods! more flavor! \n\nThe only negative side about this place is that there is a mandatory dress code. collar shirts for men (no sports attire), and no open toe shoes for the ladies. On the flip side, they also own another location but it is called \"thanh long.\" (also in sf). Thanh long is more casual with no dress code, but with the same exact menu.

Of course, we ordered the crabs and the garlic noodles. I like the garlic crab better than the drunken one, just my preference. Our waiter was an old guy and he made no conversation whatsoever. He took our order, dropped by for refills and replaced the bowls for your shells. Good enough service, but I was expecting more for such a fancy looking place. \nI think this is a nice place to treat someone for a special occasion. It's fancy enough for a date, if you don't mind getting down and dirty with the crabs. But if you are just in the mood for crabs, I suggest PPQ. The sister company Thanh Long is also good, but I would choose to eat here rather than Thanh Long. It's more spacious here and the location is a little better than the middle of a residential neighborhood.\nWARNING: the soda comes in a small little glass and there is NO FREE REFILL on the soda. The waiter kept asking my husband for another glass and we thought it was free so he said okay. Turns out, they are about $2+ per glass. We ended up paying $9+ for 3 small glasses of soda. \nThe attire to this place is business/casual. But i saw a lot more casual the night we came. \nEnjoy!", "author": "Faith P."}

Further, I have heard multitudes about the garlic crab and how awesome it is.  Last night I took the plunge - finally.\n\nTo start, the crab puffs were delicious - not going to help you watch your weight though.\nThe mixed green salad with apple, pear and tomato was suprisingly good.  The dressing was unlike any I have ever had - it had ginger, but also toasted sesame yummmy.\n\nSince there were two of us, we got both the garlic crab and the drunken crab.  Both were delicious.  The garlic crab was a little heavier - likely more butter and the drunken was a little sweeter - likely the wine broth.  I think the better of the two is the garlic crab.  It had a deep sensual feel and flavor - much like something your mom might make for you on a cold winter night when you were a child - definitely comfort food!  And we also had the garlic noodles which are delish!\n\nFor dessert we shared the baked alaska - which is not really baked alaska - it is more of an ice cream thing with merangue on top that they torch but it was yummy anyway.\n\nAll in all it is a great spot and the raves about the crab are on the money.", "author": "Andy B."}

After I was done eating and just continued on my conversation at the table, I noticed there was this opaque layer of something covering most of the plates, silverware and leftover food. There was sooooo much fat in the food that it was now solidifying right there on the table! =O Did I really just eat that??\n\nOther than my reminder of how much butter was in my food, the food itself was pretty tasty. Though I really could taste all the butter along with the actual flavors of the food. Me and my boy went all out while we were here and dived into the roast crab and tamarind crab. Both crabs were pretty good. Just a little messy and a little on the heavy side. Definitely not good for those on diets. We also had the Saigon Beef, which was kind of like cubed steak. It was pretty good but nothing that spectacular either. And, of course, we had to try their garlic noodles. The garlic noodles were definitely a let down. You can get them better somewhere else in Chinatown. \n\nThis place is good to go once to, but not enough to go again. You just have to at least get a taste of the An Family secret.

After everyone arrived and we started eating, Crustacean made a better second impression.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.  The wine list was actually decent (we had a couple bottles of an Oregon pinot that was just to die for).  Most importantly - the food was good.  Not fantastic, not mind blowing, but good.  My chicken was tasty.  The grilled oysters quite delicious.  The steak was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the stuffed squid was quite edible.  The desserts were yummy too.   Again - not spectacular, but yummy.\n\nBest of all, nobody asked us to pipe down as we all, ever more loudly, laughed our asses off while uttering some of the most culturally offensive semi-drunken blah blah blah that I've ever had the privilege to blah blah blah.

You have NO choice when it comes to these things.\n\nBut I guess you pay for the ambiance, which is a dimly-lit upscale version of Thanh Long. When I went to Crustaceans for my 7 year wedding anniversary, I had just gotten my lasik surgery that day and didn't realize until we had arrived at the restaurant, that there was a big fat sign describing the dress code (I could barely see- my new eyes covered by those dorky optomestrist glasses, I had no time to google or yelp before going). Luckily, my husband was dressed in a nice sweater vest/khaki's, while I stood behind him hiding in my black sleeveless shirt, black velour pants, and black sneakers. Anyone in their right mind could've seen I was underdressed, but it was dark and I dont think they really checked me (obviously). I got lucky, I definitely would not try that ever again. \n\nAnyhow.. although it's the same recipe as Thanh Long, it tastes 2nd rate to me. On the regular, I definitely choose Thanh Long in terms of quality, location, and I prefer their kick-back ambiance. I would only go to Crustacean's if I were on a date, for that super-snotty dimly-lit \"fine dining\" ambiance that you want to impress your date with. But even then, would you really look forward to a 2nd date if you came out of your 1st date smellling like garlic and covered in crab shells?\n\nDon't worry, I still love you Crustaceans... but overall, I dont love you as much as I love your sister restaurant Thanh Long.", "author": "Joraine C."}

I'm a man of principles and I don't believe I should work that hard for my food at a restaurant.  For crissake, I'm paying for this and I want someone else to do the work for me!  Is that too much to ask?!\n\nOkay, enough ranting.  Back to the food.\n\nMy dining companions who do not share my avoidance of work at a fancy restaurant exclaimed jubilantly about the quality of their crab.  I  personally continued my love affair with eating squid by ordering the stuffed calamari dinner.  Simply put: delicious.  tasty.  awesome.  The whole experience was like some kind of ambrosiac sea sausage, delivered on a bed of lettuce.\n\nI kinda wanted to keep the awful shirt they loaned me... but alas it was not meant to be.\n\nProvided you know what you're getting into, Crustacean serves up a wonderful dining experience.", "author": "Christopher K."}

It's not that good, but I guess people haven't been to a real Vietnamese restaurant for comparison.\n\nTheir famous crab is a three pound monster that tastes pretty good for being frozen, but is not worth the $36 -- the menu says seasonal prices, and being crab season, it should have cost half that.\n\nThe recipe is painfully simple: boil, then roast the crab. Scoop out the guts, because Americans don't like that stuff. Then before serving, smother in garlic butter and season with salt and pepper. (For their $10 specialty noodles, just buy cheap chow mein noodles, and then soak them in garlic salt and butter.)\n\nEating the crab is a total mess, as the shell is too soft in comparison to how it's prepared in authentic Vietnamese or Chinese restaurants, where the shell is crunchy enough that you could get by without using a shell cracker. On a crab this big, the meat is abundant, but bland. A smaller crab would be more flavorful. Also, by the time you get to the second half of the crab, the butter has already started congealing on your plate... not very appealing.\n\nEating in the restaurant, it's noticeably cold. For a place where dinner and drinks can easily run $60-$80 a person, one would think the An family could afford carpeting and a heater.\n\nThe biggest gripe: after eating a sloppy crab meal and your hands are covered in crab guts and butter, they hand you a small wet towel and expect that it is enough. So you go to the bathroom to wash your hands, only to find that they have no hot water! Even McDonalds with their $2 Filet-O-Fish can afford hot water, but apparently Crustaceans cannot. Maybe they should charge $40 a crab and hire a plumber to put in a hot water faucet.\n\nThe food is decent, but not worth it at the price. If you're still bent on eating here, stick with the Roast Crab, the Tamarind Crab is surprisingly bland and the messiest dish to eat in the house. You're better off eating at a \"divey but authentic\" Vietnamese or Chinese restaurant. They might not have smarmy waiters in faux Asian outfits or valet parking, but they'll have better food and hot water.", "author": "Perci N."}

I could fill a book about the stories I have from my three year tenure there. I will tell you that i love the \"roasted\" (roast in a microwave) garlic noodles and I could eat them until I had a massive coronary. The only restaurant in San Fran that utilizes more garlic is The Stinking Rose.\n\nSecret kitchen....hmmmm...that was some real marketing hogwash. I applaud the Ahn family for making it in America from Viet Nam, and I genuinely enjoyed working there but I loathe the past mandate of deception to the dining public. We were told about young Helene Ahn, who was the youngest daughter of the last \"Count\" of Da Nang. She worked in her fathers'  aristocratic kitchen as the \"irrelevant' Child under French, Chinese, and Vietnamese chefs. She recorded the ancient and refined \"Euro-Asian\" recipes and brought them to these shores.\nCould be true...I was not there. However, the timer bell of the microwave was a constant sound of the \"secret kitchen\" during my tenure there in the late 90's.\n\nLiquid margarine and loads of MSG laced frozen Dungeness crab nuked in the Amana are not some secret French Indochina secret recipe. Quite simply, that is \"Hanoi Hannah\" propaganda. Raytheon created the microwave, not Ho Chi Minh.\n\nDo not be ashamed of utilizing MSG......Ahn Clan....don't cow to the junk science notion that MSG is bad for you.

So bring your out of town business associates here and they will love it. \n\nIf it is on your personal tab and you like crab, you can do much better and a lot cheaper in chinatown.

So we rode an elevator that had a giant neon crab on it to the third floor where the restaurant was located. This must have been a good idea......in the early 90's. Our reservations were for 8:00 and we didn't get seated until about 8:45. That was no problem since we sat at the bar and had a couple cocktails. The bartenders were quite nice but the drinks were incredibly overpriced but that was kind of expected. \n\nWe were seated at an OK table by the window that had a great view of Polk St and all the madness that goes on down there. This was definitely a 9 on the unintentional comedy scale. Just watching the weird things that go on down there can keep someone entertained for hours. \n\nOK well I'm gonna pull a Seinfeld and kinda yadda yadda the rest of the meal. We had a couple appetizers, crab , garlic noodles, yadda yadda yadda and dessert. The food was good but not great and the prices were a little out of control. Right about the end of the meal that was probably on it's way to a 3 star rating everything changed. However the experience didn't come to a screeching halt as much as it crashed into a wall and exploded on impact. \n\nThere was some issue with another table near by and the managers came over to find out what was wrong. I never was quite clear on it but almost instantly this stuffy guy in a suit completely berated the server in the middle of the dining room in front of all the customers. It was so embarrassing for all parties involved. I felt bad for the server who obviously had to deal with some ass hole on a power trip. At that point it was so uncomfortable sitting there I just wanted to get the hell out of there.

Being Vietnamese, I was even mooore excited because it was a Vietnamese restaurant. Unfortunately, my excitement was quickly dispelled.\n\nFirst of all, they have a dress code. Me and my group didn't know this and one of the girls had a zip up hoodie on. They were unnecessarily rude about their dress code, but they still let us in as long as the hoodie came off. Interesting though, their dress code said that they would provide a white collared shirt to any customers if necessary. I wonder if that ever happens...\n\nThe ambience of the place is ok, despite them trying to make the place super posh. Nothing that blew me away. It's def nicer than your average Vietnamese place, but I don't think as nice as some other Vietnamese fusion restaurants. The service was pretty attentive. \n\nNow, on to the food. The Dine About Town menu really wasn't all that great. It had spring rolls and chicken skewers as the appetizer...which honestly can be done a lot better AND a lot cheaper at your typical hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese place. Their main course options (again, for Dine About Town) were shrimp on garlic noodles and shaking beef (I think that's what it's called in English -- bo luc lac). We went for the shrimp with garlic noodles. Mm...the garlic noodles were tasty, as were the shrimp, but there were just a handful of shrimp, which was kind of disappointing. And as an entree...ehhh it got old pretty fast. Good thing we also got some of their famous crab too (instead of all of us doing Dine About Town)! We got the tamarind crab and the roast crab. The tamarind crab was pretty good but...there was just something off about the sauce. If you've never had tamarind flavored seafood before at other Vietnamese restaurants, you probably wouldn't notice...but us as three Vietnamese kids, it just wasn't quite right. The roast crab was super salty and super oily. I was really excited though because I LOVE the inside of the crab head. I love it so much that the waiter even brought us two more complimentary heads! Wheee!! To compliment the crab, we also got a bowl of fried rice. This fried rice is like your typical asian fried rice with some peas and carrots in it....the kind where you can get a whole tray for not much more $ than how much the little bowl they gave us costed :P Fiiiinally, we got fried bananas for dessert. Pretty standard, pretty good, but again...I could've gotten 5 times as many bananas for half the price elsewhere...\n\nOverall, if you come, come for the crab and be prepared to spend more than you should.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-11", "description": "I'm very excited to be blogging about the next restaurant I want to share: Crustacean, in San Francisco. The story of Crustacean is a very unique and heartwarming one, and can be found on their website. It's a win-win situation: my heart is happy to support a restaurant that has such a rich history and happy story of determined women succeeding against all odds, and my tummy is happy to support their food - again, and again, and again!\n\nOn the dollar scale, from fast food to once-in-a-lifetime, I would say Crustacean rates \"special occasion\" - However, since discovering it last year, I've been there three times already and would not hesitate to go again tomorrow. To start, we ordered several appetizers, called \"Small Plates\" and costing around $10.00.\n\nFirst we had the Papaya Salad with Calamari, \"lightly marinated calamari tossed in spicy Vietnamese vinaigrette with green papaya, rau ram and fresh Asian basil.\" I'm not even sure what a natural papaya looks like - such an uncultured foodie - however, I do know that it was amazing, and am now a permanent papaya salad fan and will order it wherever else I see it, just so I can compare them and see who makes it the best!\n\nNext we had the Vietnamese Carpaccio, \"thinly sliced raw beef with a spicy lemon vinaigrette, Asian basil, sliced red onions and roasted peppers.\" My last trip to Crustacean, and the Salmon Carpaccio small plate that I ordered, had made me a carpaccio fan, but something about this dish just wasn't as stunning as the last one I tried. I would definitely re-order the salmon carpaccio next time, or try one of their many other small plates.\n\nCrustacean Shrimp Toast. This was actually really delicious! I was wary about the idea of minced shrimp on bread, but it was executed wonderfully. It was lightly broiled so that it was a tiny bit crunchy and toasty on the outside, but soft on the inside. They only serve three pieces, though, so if you go with a party of six like we did, you must be prepared to share. I would probably try something else next time.\n\nMain Course Time! We ordered everything that Crustacean is famous for: first, the Roasted Dungeoness Crab. This is widely, widely recommended on blogs and review sites everywhere, and for a reason. The crab is perfectly roasted, and so savory that you have to try very hard to refrain from licking the shell! It's easy to crack (and it snaps crisply, not soggy and bendy like cheap crab does), and each bite of the tender meat inside reminds you why Crustacean is one of San Francisco's best seafood restaurants.\n\nSecond, and absolutely crucial for every visit, is the famous An's Garlic Noodles. I knew about these garlic noodles way, way before I ever set foot in Crustacean itself. The first time I had it, I was hooked. Second time I had it, I was still hooked. Third time....yep, still hooked. :) I can't emphasize how much I recommend these garlic noodles. TIP: If you're not feeling spendy enough for a restaurant that's \"special occasion\" priced, though, you can get a very good alternative garlic noodle dish at Unicorn that I heartily recommend. It's lighter, and still very delicious.\n\nDessert! Most of us were tempted into the fried banana and ice cream, which is delicious and a must-have if you've never tried it. However, if you have had it, Crustacean's take on it is not particularly special - but it's not bad at all. But, the best of the night was definitely the Baked Alaska. Now, I am not a big fan of bananas. However, the sauce on the banana slices was divine - sweet without overpowering. I seriously respect any restaurant that can prepare a food I don't particularly like into a dish that I could die for, and this was definitely it!\n\nWith the dessert still on my mind hours later, I looked up Baked Alaska on the interwebs, and I can't say that the description of the dessert sounded like what we ate - so I'll have to order it at the next restaurant that offers it, for the sake of comparison.\n\nYeah...obviously, I am a huge fan of this restaurant and it has not failed to impress me even upon my return trips. I am always recommending this restaurant to friends and/or taking them there personally so I can get another meal in!\n\nFull review with photos here:\nhttp://lorelai.vox.com/library/post/never-disappointed-crustacean-san-francisco.html", "author": "Wei-Ling W."}

Crabs were fine but no great culinary feat.  We ordered  a halibut that was horrendous and also came with an overly sweet sauce.  The shaking beef was overcooked and certainly not shaking.

In addition, the garlic noodles are off the hook.  Ive been wanting to get a takeout order of just the noodles for lunch, they were so good.\n\nThe reason Crustacean is getting 3 stars from me because of their ludicrous dress code.  Dont get me wrong, we appreciate dress codes and follow them by all means whenever we're headed to a very fancy restaurant or upscale lounge.  The thing that ticked me off about Crustacean's dress code was: 1.  It was not well advertised, and 2.

You cant go to Crustacean's and not order the crab. Most people have the garlic noodles with it, but Ill pass on the noodles, the chicken fried rice is always on point. \n\nThe service is always great, and the restaurant is always clean which makes for a pleasant experience each and every time I go. The prices on the crabs vary, but are always upward of $30. They don't have fountain drinks which mean no refills, so get your drink with the meal or just drink water. \n\nI am not a big dessert but they have great deserts, the fried banana's with vanilla ice cream is divine. Also they have an assortment of sherbet that are extremely good.\n\nThey have valet which I highly recommend because parking is horrible.

It was okay, good hints of garlic but nothing that I would make famous.\nShaken Beef flambeed in Chardonnay, sauteed green beans, cherry tomatoes, and red onions - Egh, I've definitely had better!

Nob Hill neighborhood, historic and picturesque.\n\nAmbience - Nice decor, table by the window was very nice as well.\n\nParking - We used valet parking ($12 plus tip). The others parked down the street which was very inconvenient. My suggestion is to use the valet parking. \n\nFood - OK, most of us ordered the famous \"roasted crab\" and \"garlic noodles\" - while this tasted OK, it was not good or even great, just OK. The crab was tasty but seemed to be overcooked. We wore bibs to keep the butter and grease from getting on our clothes. While this was an interesting part of the experience I really don't expect to wear a bib while enjoying a fine meal. Also, why do they require a jacket at this place, if you have to wear a bib! Jeans and a T-shirt would be perfect for cracking crab, and spraying butter all over the place. \n\nThe garlic noodles were very soft and I didn't really taste much garlic (I've had Ramen Noodles that tasted better). \n\nOne person in our ordered the shimp and noodles and he stated that it was very good.\n\nCalamari - Very good and well prepared. I particularly liked the cut up vegetables that were part of this dish.\n\nService - The service was good. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly. She made very good suggestions for both our meal and drinks. One person in our party decided to pay extra to have the crab extracted from the shell by the restaurant (afraid that the butter or crab would ruin her dress). We had to pay extra for this service and it took a very long time to complete.\n\nPrice - very over priced.", "author": "Garry B."}

It was buttery and flavorful. The calamari was good too, but a little too greasy. Nothing special. \nI ordered the garlic noodles and crab of course. Oooh, disappointment upon my first bite. What's so special about the noodles again? It didn't taste like something from a \"secret kitchen.\" I enjoyed it, but I thought it was more greasy than it was buttery. The crab had too much fried onions in it. Again, more greasy than it was buttery.

The crab was also sort of good but for the price it's kind of a bad deal.\n\nOh we also had the paper shrimp appetizers which were excellent.\n\nAnyway, I gotta say this place is pretty over rated if you factor in price. divide price by 3 and I may give it another star.\n\nThe service we found to be pretty sketchy. We had to wait 15 minutes for our reservation which we would understand if the restaurant were busy and they sort of forgot about us. They seated another party of 2 ahead of us which was kind of irritating.\n\nFinally, a mystery about this restaurant to ponder... why is everyone so unhappy? This is not a happy place.

We got a table right away, however, they told us about their dress code. He was wearing a white v-neck tee and black cardigan. Luckily, they DO offer dry cleaned collared shirts for customers to borrow while dining. Nice shirts too, we were tempted to leave with it. haha (don't worry we returned it). However, half way through our dining experience, a table was seated behind us, the guy was wearing: A WHITE T-SHIRT AND GREY CARDIGAN. Where the hell was his collared shirt.. HMMMM??? If you're going to make one patron change his shirt.. sorry you gotta hold it true for EVERYONE. \n\nAnyway. We ordered:\nSalt & Pepper Calamari: Decent. Fresh calamari, came with some stir fried onions & bell peppers. Good, but had better.\nTiger Prawns w/ the famous Garlic Noodles: eh. I was really looking forward to the FAMOUS GARLIC NOODLES. I've been hearing about it on TV and from friends. First, it wasn't fresh.. it was actually kinda soggy, and it was obvious it was made from a large batch and then portioned out. Honestly, I've had way better noodles. Prawns were delicious though.\nRoasted Crab: The main reason we came here. It was good. Not OMG good, but good. You really can't go wrong roasting crab in garlic. I should've tried their tamarind crab, maybe if i ever go again. I'd rather  save the $40 for the crab, buy fresh and make it at home. \nCreme Brulee: Good, lots of vanilla. \nLemon Cheesecake with mango & strawberries, and a mango sauce: Mangoes were WAY to sour (still green) to pair well with this tart cake. Kind of dry too. \n\nAll in all.. \nFood was OK\nService was good, although it took our water a little while to realize my BF was completely out of water. Highpoint: The food came out pretty damn fast. I was very surprised about that. \nI probably won't go out of my way to come back though.", "author": "Chi N."}

We called to make reservation and were told that we must dress up, no jeans, no tennis shoes, man needs a jacket....It made our expectation high for Crustacean BUT here're the facts....\n\nWhen we arrived, we needed to wait for almost 30 minutes because there's no table for us and we must have everybody there before we would be seated.  OK, it's not something that a restaurant can control.  Then, we saw some people walked in with their shorts, sandals and sundresses and the front desk said nothing about it.  If a restaurant would like to implement some rules, it must be universal.  I made me feel like that I're fooled; why couldn't I wear my favorite T-shirt and jeans while someone sat near to be wearing shorts and sandals?\n\nOK, after we settled down in a table of 6, we \"studied\" the menu and tried to decide what to go for.  The waitresses and waiters were so enthusastic to sell their expensive wine to us.  One of my friends like to try different wines and my hubby knows quite a bit of wines.  He knew that the ones they tried to sell to us not worth that much.  We totally understood that restaurant needs to make a profit but the charge was really a ripoff.\n\nThen, talk about the food.  The garlic noodle were quite good but not rated as high as so many yelpers mentioned here.  I tried the lobster linguine which was quite fresh but definitely overpriced.  My friend shared a crab with his wife who wanted to try something different, sweet and sour crab.  They were disappointed, the taste was just not right and they regreted that they should just go for the normal crab.  My hubby went for the steak which was OK but not outstanding, again it's overpriced.  Another friend and his girlfriend tried the tiger prawns and they really liked it.\n\nFinally, the desserts were just so and so, not impressed.\n\nWith the coupon plus the tip, we spent around $100 per head.  Thanks for our silly friend to order that kind of expensive but yackky wine.  We all consider Crustacean just being overrated and overpriced.  My hubby said that he would rather go to Thanh Long which should be better in quality.\n\nOne more thing, parking is hard.  Also, it's so windy at night and ladies who wear dresses made of light fabrics should pay attention.  My friend just played Marilyn Morroe when she walked on the staircases.

I've been to Crustacean's 10 years ago. Yes, you read that right, 10 years ago. And it's just as delicious as I remembered it. I think it says something if a restaurant has made it so long in a town like SF. Who can forget the garlic noodles (buttery, with good chew, and of course, garlicky - so not a first date food, wink wink) and the roasted crab. They do have 2 other types - tamarind and drunken but when I asked our waiter, which crab he said without hesitation, \"It's been 10 years? Yeah, roasted bec/ you'll wish it was if you order something else\". He was right. Was fantastic - finger lickin' good! I mean, I'm dabbing my fingers to catch some more bits of garlic, salt and pepper off the plate. Not good for the blood pressure. Anyway, we also had the following:\n\n- I had the Pear Martini (tasty, not in a big glass so I had to have another beverage)... and the Bellini Martini (also tasty)...\n- my friend had the Lychee martini (very good) and the caipirinha (true to form and I've had them in Rio and it was close)!\n- seafood cakes (comes with 5 and it's like golden fried fish cake)  with pickled beverages\n- grilled calamari with mustard sauce (several small squid grilled with nice char on the outside and nice and tender center) - very good. \n\nToo full for dessert... wish they had mango and sticky rice - my friend said they had it at their sister restaurant Thanh Long. \n\nOverall we were very satisfied and will surely go again someday (and I won't wait so long)! I was reminded bec/ I watch \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" and the chef was featured for the crab and the noodles. \n\n(Oh, the street parking is a bit tough) We got lucky but it could be challenging if we hadn't.   :(", "author": "Kuishingal F."}

The ambiance is lovely and upscale; the service is impeccable, and the food is really incredible.  If you want a cheap hole-in-the-wall, this is definitely not the place for you, but I don't like cockroaches, and most of the other Vietnamese and Wharf places I've been to have them.  UGH.\n\nI've never found any flaws in the food.  The crab is tender and succulent, and the butter/garlic/pepper sauce Crustacean serves it in is perfect for dipping.  The garlic noodles are done al dente, with butter and a lot of garlic, and they're a must for any dinner, no matter what else you order.  If you don't want crab, Helene's Ravioli, delicate rice noodle packets stuffed with shrimp and garlic in a fantastic beurre-blanc sauce, is a great choice.  (I always have the crab puffs, which are creamy and crunchy, in a delicious honey-mustard dip, as an appetizer.)\n\nDrinks can be wonderfully inventive.  If you give the bartender a list of ingredients or just generally describe what you want, he can make it for you.  The chocolate raspberry martini is my favorite, and I've had it with Bailey's, ice cream, Schmidt powdered chocolate, and many other ingredients, depending on my mood.\n\nFor dessert, I usually choose the bread pudding with a glass of Bonny Doon's Vin de Glaciere.\n\nI always ask the wait staff to keep me supplied with hot wet towels and lemon water during the meal and they do.  Shell bowls for the crab are removed and replaced quickly and often.  Our waiter checks frequently to make sure everything is all right and we're OK with drinks and water.\n\nCrustacean is a great place to bring guests to, and the people my husband and I have taken have all enjoyed it immensely.

They have a true understanding of Vietnamese flavors and how to arrange them in ways that tantalize the American palate by making the dishes familiar yet exotic at the same time. \n\nThe giant neon crab outside is sort of off putting but the inside is tasteful with a decor that harkens back to French colonial Vietnam.

The restaurant itself was pretty empty for a 6:30pm Sunday dinner and by around 8:30pm was about half full.  \n\nService was good and our servers/waitresses were pretty attentive with menu questions/refilling waters/exchanging bowls filled with crab shells/etc.  For anyone who goes to Crustacean or Thanh Long, the only thing they should really order are probably 1 of the 3 varieties of crab and garlic noodles.  Although the other items on the menu are decent, it's probably not worth the $20-$30 they charge per entree.  The garlic noodle is still one of the best (comparable to TL).  However, the roast crabs and drunken crabs we ordered were pretty much under-seasoned and my drunken crab was also rubbery and didn't taste fresh.  At $40 each, the quality of the crabs at Crustacean is no where close to what you can get for the same price at TL.  One person in our group ordered a Prawn entree which turned out to be 4 prawns and some garlic noodle for $40 also.  Lastly, the restaurant does not seem to provide free refill for soda as 2 refills of skinny tall glass (8-10oz?) with more than 60% ice came to around $9.  \n\nIt is unfortunate the quality of the food did not live up to the price they charged for our meal.  Although Crustacean appears to be a more convenient location (compared to TL) to get your crab fix, I'd recommend driving the extra miles to Thanh Long and get much better crabs if you're going to pay $40-$50 for your crab.

Yesterday, my girlfriends and I visited the San Francisco branch and I was NOT impressed. \n\nIt was like stepping into restaurant not even affiliated with the Beverly Hills restaurant. I hate to say it, but the San Francisco branch is ghetto (and they have the nerve to have a dress code). My friends and I were seated outside on the top floor. The decor was terribly dated, the table clothes were not as clean as they could be, the windows were down right filthy, and I saw a waiter stuff a bunch of napkins under the leg of a table in order to keep it balanced. Mind you, this place is supposed to be fine dinning.\n\nThe food seemed a bit mediocre as well. It was good, but not as good as I remembered it. The garlic noodles are nothing more than chow mein noodles with a TON of butter and bits of garlic dispersed through out. Good, but not worth $9.50 for a side bowl. The tiger prawns were still tasty but I could of sworn that they were larger the last time I ate them. \n\nThis restaurant's only redeeming quality was the service. My party was almost 20 minutes late, but we were still seated in about 10 minutes. Our waiter was great. He was very attentive and our glasses stayed full. We never once had to call him over.\n\nAll in all this place has okay food and excellent service, but it's not worth the price.

I have been looking forward to going to Crustacean since I moved back to the bay area from Los Angeles because the one in Beverly Hills is divine.  \n\nUnfortunately, I was rather disappointed with the food, especially given the price tag.  The restaurant was in a run down area of downtown SF, and the interior wasn't remotely as nice as the one in Beverly Hills - it's rather dingy and dark.  We ordered the seafood dumpling, roasted grab, tamarine crab, and garlic noodles.  The seafood dumpling had hardly any seafood.  It was mostly dough and wasn't worth the price for five small pieces.  The garlic noodles were good, but not really different from the garlic noodles at my neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant (Sunflower) or as good as the dish at the Beverly Hills restaurant.  Finally, the roasted crab was very flavorful, but again, didn't compare to the dish in BH, which cracks the shell so that the crab meat seems to just peel off without much effort.  (I didn't finish my crab because I just got tired of cracking the shell).  My partner ordered the Tamarine crab, and he said it was not good at all.  He was hoping for sometime spicy, but got a tomato-based sauce.  \n\nThe price was about $150 (including tip).   Too bad it doesn't live up to the sister restaurant in Los Angeles.

With places like PPQ, Ana Mandara, Le Cheval, Slanted Door, The House, and Straits Cafe offering similar dishes at lower prices, Crustacean is now just one of many. With all that having been said, I loved the food and thought the service was good. The wine was good and not too overpriced. Our appetizers were just okay: the fried starters were very ordinary, but the vietnamese seafood salad was really good. For entrees we had a crab, shaking beef and sea bass. All were delicious, fresh, and worth checking out.\nWhile the giant neon crab outside is anything but classy and interesting, the food is good albeit somewhat expensive.", "author": "Damian S."}

I would pay to discover their secret ingredient and recipes.  \n\nI always tell myself that the next time I come here, each person orders their own bowl of noodle and own crab.  I think this is the best place to go if you're not planning on ordering anything else.  On my most recent trip, I brought the entire family plus one to enjoy a meal here.  We sprung for appetizers and side dishes.  We ordered the calamari, beef carpaccio, and chicken skewers.  I have not been a fan of calamari for the longest time but the one here was really good.  We also got a tamarind crab.  In retrospect, I would have stuck with all roasted crabs but I wanted my family to try a different flavor so they would have something to compare it to.  They loved it all!\n\nThe service is great every time we go. It is a little bit pricier considering you can never get full off of seafood but oh so worth it to me.  Yum!", "author": "Jess C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-10", "description": "3 3/4 stars.\n\nWe went here for the first time to celebrate my father's birthday.  We started out with the Salmon Carpaccio and the Crab Puffs.  Not bad.  The Salmon Carpaccio was drizzled with a olive oil/balsamic vinegar mixture with thin-sliced onions, capers, and greens and was served with pieces of sliced garlic-butter baguette.  The Crab Puffs okay, sort of reminded me of Crab Rangoon and was served with a peanut/mustard sauce which I'm not quite sure complemented the puffs properly.\n\nThe roasted crab and garlic noodles were pretty good, although I wasn't completely blown away.  Maybe it's because I'm Vietnamese and the crab is a pretty standard recipe that most viet families know how to make, with slight variations among different families.  And like the crab, the garlic noodles were good, but this isn't the first time I've had asian-style garlic noodles.  \n\nI had the flourless chocolate cake with amaretto whipped cream which was absolutely delicious!  The cake was warm and soft and along with the amaretto whipped cream made for a sublime flavor experience.  I also tried the creme brulee.  This may sound strange, but it tasted like old houses.  Let me explain.  You know that musty scent when you walk into an antique shop or old house that hasn't been inhabited for years?  That's what the creme brulee tastes like if that smell had a taste.  It's really weird.  My mom and dad appeared to enjoy the fried banana which the restaurant served on the house when they found out it was his birthday, which was a nice touch.\n\nThe decor was nice and the waitstaff was amicable and diligent.  The view wasn't that great...overlooking a couple of thrift stores.  However I did appreciate the option of valet parking since I'm not a huge fan of wasting 30 minutes worth of gas to find parking in SF.\n\nI'd say that one experience here is enough for me since I can, more or less, get this kind of fare at home.  Crustacean would be a pretty fun place to take friends who aren't familiar with this kind of cuisine since the atmosphere and presentation would be a little more impressive than my kitchen.", "author": "Nana K."}

We also tried the catch of the day, which is cooked in turmeric but didn't taste like anything, and was accompanied by these noodles that literally looked like they were boiled in water and thrown on a plate and had zero taste.\n\nFinally, we tried the ever so famous roasted crab - what a disappointment. It just tasted like normal crab, with some garlic flavor added. Nothing special. And the whole rest of the evening and the next day I just sort of felt sick from the garliciness of it. Certainly not worth $37. And the overall dinner was most definitely not worth the $175ish that we paid for 2 people. I expect much better food for that price.\n\nAlso, the service was pretty crappy. And the chairs are unbelievably uncomfortable.

Yeah whatever. \n\nSo friends and I are like okay no problem we are ready we know what we want we just came from your sister Restaurant due to an altercation that took place. Her response \" oh, what would you like to order?\" Orders are placed.

Nothing but minced crabmeat on wonton wrappers then fried or at least it looks like it. The seared ahi tuna was ok too, a little too cold but ok. The salmon carpaccio was quite tasty as well but what did they use to slice it? Razor blades? Man those were super thin. So thin the slices that my wife joked about it that it looked like the plate was garnished with some sauce but where's the salmon! But it's good. \nMy mom-inlaw and I had the lobsters, the wife, daughter and the dad-inlaw all each had the roasted crabs and the son had the crabs with the tamarind and wine thingy on it.\nI guess I got used to having lobsters back in the east coast that my expectation here was a bit maliced. The meat was really soft, again maybe it's just me, otherwise it was quite tasty. Everyone else seemed to like the crabs they ordered. The garlic noodle was way over hyped! It's just pasta, lots a garlic and boat load of butter. We all know that you can drop a couple of dozens of butter sticks to anything and that would be divine. Nuff said.\nFor desserts, we ordered 4 fried banana ala mode, it was nothing new but still pleasant to have.

If you read my review of Thanh Long below, that restaurant is in a neighborhood that suffers from periodic Asian gang violence and shootings (not covered by your favorite media of course). \n\nAs far as the more upscale Crustacean restaurant goes, within mere moments you can have easy access to Skank Francisco, aka tenderloin, dirty streets, homeless pestering you for anything, and then some. If you forego valet parking, you might have to drive further down to some really nasty ass places for street metered parking. Hopefully you don't have to pay the homeless guy to \"watch your car for you\" while you eat. \n\nWhen Crustacean first opened, family insisted on coming here instead over Thanh Long numerous times due to more comfortable surroundings, at the time newer settings, and if I remember correctly valet parking which was something you'd never see in Outer Sunset.\nBut all that trouble for paying more, forcing men to put on a collared shirt with pants (no jeans) and in the beginning not clearly stating whether a tie was needed? Doh. I've seen respectable older mofo's come in here with a Hawaiian shirt and shorts, and they are wisked right in without problems, while I flabberghastedly screamed silently upon witnessing this, garbed smart and casually, but not metrosexually. Maybe the dude's a regular? Who knows.\n\nMy last visit here was 7 years ago, and that meal was quite good and definitely better than Thanh Long. The tiger prawn with garlic noodle dish here however was not that stellar, but still decent. The best item however was their rather overpriced but really strong and well done Vietnamese espresso with condensed milk on ice (aka cafe sua na), served in a fancy frou frou like hard liquor glass. And the best part? They gave me those two tiny black stirrers that also functioned as straws. Not quite Jimmy Bond Vodka Martini, shaken not stirred (wait isn't that bubble/tapioca milk tea??), but it made me feel like a high roller. I'm glad that I can get the same very well done coffee at Vung Tau in the South or East Bay, for less attitude and money, but if you happen to be here, at least that won't disappoint. The beef or was it salmon carpaccio appetizer was decent, but nothing really mindblowing.\n\n7 years ago this was still a good place to impress a date as I have done in the past.

We were seated quickly after calling and asking at the hostess desk to add one additional seat to the table. Our head server had our table and one other table that seated 4 people. Once she took our drink and food order that was the last we saw of her. We had to continue to wave the bus staff down to ask for beverage refills. The head waiter returned 20 minutes after taking our order to let us know that something was not available, however did not offer a menu for alternative options. The bus staff spilled water all over one of the tables and attempted to drop a napkin in an effort to soak up the water. We asked for a new table cloth and in the process an entire pitcher of water was spilled behind us on two people. Still no sign of the head waitress. When the food arrived, half of it was ice cold. At this point, we wanted to get the management involved. \"Sean\" comes over and says \"someone asked to speak to me\" with a major attitude.

We all ate garlic noodles.  We all at a bit of lobster roll.  I was the only one who ate mussels.  What caused the sickness?  Don't know.   But this is the first time I've been sitting at a restaurant and 2-hours into a leisurely meal had to run to the bathroom so as not to vomit on the table.  That night, I had a fever and chills.  The following day I was still nauseuos, and my dining partners started to feel ill.  I am still  not 100% better almost 72 hours later.\n\nFood poisoning?  Maybe.  But I suspect the amounts of MSG in their food.   It is what makes the noodles so addictive to everybody.  There are many types of reactions to MSG, ranging from those that seem like food poisoning, to severe heartburn, to migraines and muscle/joint pain.  It is the only explanation that explains all of our symptoms, as most food poisoning comes with abdominal pain and cramping, vomiting, etc - but the heart burn and acid reflux are particular to MSG reactions, and that was one of the symptoms we shared.\n\nShame on Crustacean for saying they don't use MSG on their menu, and yet putting it in their signature dishes.\n\nI will not be dining here again.

Sure, the crab is tasty and so is the garlic noodles, but then again, almost all the upper end Chinese restaurants serve delicious crab at a fraction of what Crustacean charges you (close to $40 each when we were there -- maybe more now). Everyone in our party ordered a crab and the other two, fish. I am a slow eater when it comes to crab so half way through my crab, the butter on my plate had congealed. I waved the server over and suggested that perhaps they could serve this dish with tea candles under the plate to keep it from congealing. The congealed butter completely put me off the crab which is why I give this 3 stars. Compared to crabs around the Bay Area, this is definitely among the top 10 in flavor, but the price does not justify what you get. Take into consideration the location, the valet parking and now, the celebrity hype and there you have the reasons why your crab comes to 40% more than other restaurants.", "author": "Anita L."}

I've eaten at Le Cheval for a banquet once with the Huong Viet folks. We all vowed never to eat there again. Other than some of the staff, we were the only Vietnamese people in there. The service was bad, bad, bad. Waiter was a white guy who spoke no Vietnamese and got our order wrong several times and we ordered in ENGLISH! (why they would give us a white waiter when there were several other VN ones is beyond me). Basically we had to send the VN busboy to go fix our order. They gave us a scoop of mango ice cream as free service since he messed up our order so much when we should have gotten the courses themselves free. The food was binh thuong. Not very special. It reminded me of fast food generic Asian/Chinese food rather than being VN; Cam Huong the VN deli on Webster is better by comparison. The vegetables weren't very gio`n, and everything was drowning in corn starchy sauce (oyster or soy). ;oP Le petit Cheval is better and cheaper too (more Asian clientele since it's right by UC Berkeley campus), but it's still very fast food like.\n\nCrustacean's is another bourgie colonialist \"Eurasian\" restaurant in SF and Beverly Hills. Don't have anything to say about the one in SF, never having been there, but the one in Beverly Hills is a trip. My bro used to wait at the one in BH, which was very trendy for Mr. & Mrs. Melanie Griffith, FranDrescher and the hollywoodites to dine. It has very beautiful decorated. French colonial style fans, mosquito nets, bamboo/wicker. The biggest draw was the glass covered koi pond that ran through the entire restaurant. It is admittedly very beautiful, but most definitely not Vietnamese style or authentic Vietnamese food. The snooty An family who run the restaurants claim to be the glorified hereditary chefs to the emperor. Or as my mom says, that just means they were lowly servants to an insufferable, petty, in-bred monarchy. She can't figure out why people love to claim connections to the Nguyen dynasty since they sold out Viet Nam to the French colonizers in the first place. Anyways, so they have a \"secret kitchen\" where the An's prepare their special secret family recipes. But their head chef down in BH isn't even a member of the family; he's a very nice Vietnamese guy who got hired after he immigrated from VN and they keep him locked in this little kitchen. And they use frozen seafood, because they know their white clientele can't Taste the difference when the food is fresh or not... and they treat the Latino & Asian staff like crap.", "author": "miriam b."}

The interior is narrow and winding but the lighting is comfortable.

Even the tamarind sauce with crab are good but I am so partial to the roast crab I think I could possibly finish the whole thing all by myself.... just give me ample time!

Its on the third floor of a shopping center and very nice on the inside. It is perfectly lit and decorated in a contemporary-asian kinda way. The service is awesome. The wait staff is very knowledgeable and on top of their stuff. The Valet, which I used to park my car cost 10 bucks and well worth the headache of trying to find a downtown parking spot in the rain at night. Remember, if your looking to dress up and eat good food in a cool setting- Crustacean, if your looking for the same thing but not in the mood for Downtown and dressin up, Thanh Long. \n\nI ordered the Calamari appetizer, which was fryed with onions and bell peppers and seasoned with what may have been lemon pepper. The Calamari itself was a little chewy, but still damn good, Then, of course we ordered the roasted crab and garlic noodles. And of course, they were excellent. As the four star rating goes, \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" I wish I could come here more often, if it were cheaper I would. But its not so I cant. Just a heads up for all you that have never been to either restaurant, if you take a date and both of you both order the crab and garlic noodles your looking at a 100 dollar dinner.

Actually, my fish was cooked really well, and it was in a sesame sauce that was awesome with the spuds. Why did I rate this place three stars? I don't think the menu is unique, and the appetizers we had we could have eaten from a Chinese take away and would not have known the difference. Also, the ambiance was less than desirable. The internets tricked me!!!  I previewed online and it looked all nice and romantic, but inside it just felt faux. It's crowded an unromantic.  I wouldn't really recommend this place if you're looking for an upscale  dining experience or trying to impress a date. But if you're cravin' some crab and you don't mind shelling out the money for a big 'un, then check it out and let me know how it goes.", "author": "Lisa F."}

I wonder when the last time was that the Ang family actually visited their restaurant. They should be embarrassed by how dirty the waiting area couch is. I would not sit on it, and a friend of mine made the comment that  Bart train seats was cleaner.  Once at the table, a friend had a fork which clearly had last nights meal still on the tine. The wall behind our table had old food stuck to it. This restaurant needs a revamping, and a good cleaning.  Now on to the food. Nothing special. We ordered 4 appetizers that were just so-so. For lunch we decided to eat family style and ordered a total of 5 plates. The crab was market cost, not sure what it was, but I do know that I have had just as good garlic crab at my sister-in-law's. The jumbo prawns were also market cost and there was only four on the plate. The garlic noodles were good, and to be honest the only item on the menu worth eating there. I guess dropping their dress code was a good idea, as it is not warranted for a place like this. Maybe back in the day this was the place to be, but not any longer. By the way lunch for 5 of us, with tip and tax came out to $272.00", "author": "Diane S."}

It was 5:45pm, so the restaurant was maybe a quarter full.  Which meant attentive service, since the waitress and servers didn't have to split their time with other diners.\n\nWe started with the Mixed Greens, basically the \"fancy\" variety of salad-in-a-bag (or Kula Greens, as we call it on Maui), with candied walnuts, a few slices of orange, with an orange-ginger vinaigrette.  At $9.25, it seems overpriced to me (but everything in this restaurant does).\n\nMy wife ordered the roasted crab and I ordered the roasted salmon.  The roasted crab was as advertised, roasted to perfection in a garlic sauce.  As much as she tried, my wife couldn't finish it, even giving me a few bites of crab throughout the evening.  The roasted salmon was in a soy ginger sauce with sauteed corn and spinach.  The salmon was very delicious and cooked the way I like it, a little crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The soy ginger sauce complimented it well but there wasn't anything special about the accompanying corn and spinach.  We also both ordered a bowl of the garlic noodles.  I almost managed to eat my entire bowl but the garlic finally got to me and I couldn't eat another bite.  Very delicious but we should have just shared a single bowl.\n\nWe were too full for dessert so we called it a night.  We had received a gift certificate as a gift, so the meal was almost free for us.  As much as the meal was delicious, I don't think we would have dined there without the gift certificate, as it would be out of our usual price range.\n\nAs others have said, the building complex the restaurant is in, isn't very attractive but the inside of the restaurant makes you forget what's outside.  There's also an elevator that brings you into the restaurant if you don't want to walk up the stairs.", "author": "David H."}

I have been coming to Crustacean's for special occasion's  for  several years now & this past Saturday we went for my cousins birthday. While we were seating very quickly , the service deteriorated after that. We were a large party 14 people , so the tip is automatically placed at 16% on our bill. We saw our waitress very infrequently, we had to ask the bus boy to refill our drinks, when our food did finally arrive several meals were ice cold &  the garlic noodles were disgusting . We had water poured on our table, as well as a pitcher poured on the backs of 2 people in our party. We were still trying to have a good celebration at this point. We asked to speak to a manager to inform him of all of the issues that we were having , to let him know that he should improve his customer service. The manager that arrive came over with a VERY condescending tone, not asking how may I help you, BUT what do you want. We were thrown off by his approach & tried to inform him off all of the things that we had gone through so far & his approach was what do you want me to do about it.  He stated he would go find out what was going on, and never came back ( he did remove 1 of the 3 shrimp fried rice's that were cold , BUT not any of the other food, nor did he bother to even ask what else was cold). After that no one really wanted to finish the food that they had & we were just ready to go , asking for the bill ( from the busboy) . While waiting the busboy brought over towels to clean our hands etc , & about 15 minutes later the waitress arrived with the same towels, she really was not paying attention to our table. When the bill finally arrived I stated to the busboy that he should receive the tip ($100.00 plus) since he was the one that serviced  our table. I would not recommend going here at all !!!!! We could have spent our $700.00 else wheres & will do so in the future !!!", "author": "Sham P."}

Getting inside things improve, albeit remotely, as you are escorted to your table by a doting staff. Skip to the food 'cause I think that I painted the picture for you...\nWhen you go to crustacean, you have to have the garlic broiled crab and garlic noodles. You get swaddled in bib&gloves as you are served a whole dungeness crab that is cooked to perfection. You will eat it all... The garlic noodles are another dish, like KC Masterpiece potato chips on Super Bowl Sunday (sorry, I'm not a Neck-car fan) , you will not be able to stop eating.\nThis restaurant is indeed an experience. The food is pretty good, not the place to impress someone with your gastronomic IQ, more like a place to go with friends who are not food snobs, but just want to have a good time. \nWhen you're done, walk it off to the downtown and have a great 'tail someplace snobby, like.....you know", "author": "George M."}

The salmon carpaccio was good but oily and served with buttered toast.\nThe entrees- Crab, of course, and prawns w/ garlic noodles were good sized and tasty, but over salted, peppered and no citrus at all.  The service was too stiff at times, unknowledgeable about wine changes and sold out items.  The waitress was good, just too corporate...yes sir...no sir.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-19", "description": "I went to Crustacean last night for the first time in many years (several). I remember I was a huge fan before, and while last night's meal was savory, I'm glad my palate has become more educated because it's not nearly the best food in the City, in my opinion. Here's why.\nTo begin with, the place is getting really run down. I find it tacky that they insist on their dress code when the place is old by anyone's standards, and their patio room is like a tent with its canopy roof. I also think putting tables in the hallway where people are walking through all night is also not very elegant. I was pretty shocked when I arrived to see a nearly totally empty restaurant. We were actually told to wait a few minutes or (conveniently enough) go to the bar area to wait, where we could and did buy a drink while waited for them to um...uh...prepare one of the hundred empty tables I guess. Anyway, we were promptly seated once they saw that we bought a drink. The only other diners in the room above the bar happened to be a table of a dozen LOUD Asian guys revelling in their crab...not ideal but I did ask to be seated in the restaurant and not the tent.\nFor dinner we started with the Salt and Pepper Calamari, per the recommendation of our friendly waiter. Nicely done. Not greasy and pretty tasty. For the main course we shared a roasted crab and the king prawn garlic noodles, seemingly what everyone goes here for. The crab was definitely good, but totally messy. I guess that can be expected when you are cracking and eating your own crab, but with all the butter it is soaked in it became quite a mess. I ended up eating the prawns from the other dish with my hands too since they were already covered with buttery slime, so in a medieval kind of way I was satisfied because it was very sublime tasting. Crab was buttery and good. Prawns were nicely grilled and buttery also. Garlic noodles, as other Yelpers have said, were not overly garlicky and were downright delicious. \nBecause I just spent a weekend in Vegas staying at Wynn's Encore and dining in nice places I'm a little biased, so I think I'm being generous in giving Crustacean 4 stars. I would give 3 for the reasons above (mainly the place is run down and they shouldn't expect you to treat it like a nice steak house accordingly with steak house prices), but because the food is good and the waiter was friendly I'm giving it 4 stars...barely.", "author": "Matt H."}

Crustacean was much much better.  The crab I had @ Crustacean tonight was a lot bigger and much more flavorful.  I also liked the way Crustacean served the crab -- nicely laid out with its shell on a platter rather than Alioto's cracked legs in a bowl.  \n\nI had the whole crab by myself and ordered Crustacean's famous garlic noodles.  From what I can remember, Thanh Long's garlic noodles seemed to have tasted better -- a bit thicker and less oily.  But the combination of the roasted crab and garlic noodles was very palatable!  My overall experience @ Crustacean was more enjoyable than @ Alioto's but not as great compared to Thanh Long.  With  dinner, I also had some garden vegetables -- carrots, cauliflower, water chestnuts, red peppers, soy beans and squash, tofu and shitake prepared with a sweet/lemony sauce.  Dinner for two was about $140 and that was without drinks.", "author": "Mika S."}

We were sorely disappointed.  The first red flag was how quickly the food came out.  All of the dishes we ordered (including the roasted crab that was noted on the menu that it \"may take longer to prepare\") were on our table in five minutes after placing the order.  Literally.  My husband ordered, went to the bathroom (to do a number one), and came back to find food on the table (!!!).  We were all surprised, but decided to give the food a try.  Here's a rundown:\n\n1. The crispy fried rice paper rolls were pretty good.  The outside crispy part had a nice texture and made the overall roll unique compared to the typical imperial spring roll you order at Vietnamese pho restaurants.  \n2. The roast crab was fine, but didn't taste like it was cooked-to-order.  \n3. The calamari special was good, but the order was small and there weren't nearly enough tentacles (tentacles are so much more tasty and interesting to eat).  \n4. Our final dish was the \"catch of the day\", which I think should have been called the \"release of the day\".  The fish was bland, nondescript looking and overcooked, and the hyped, \"secret recipe\" garlic noodles were much more buttery than garlicky (\"greasy\" was how other Yelpers have described them).  The presentation of the dish was also sloppy.\n5. My husband's drink didn't arrive until quite a bit later.  They said that the bar was backed up, which was fine, as the area was crowded.  The martini drinks were expensive and small.  \n\nThe quality, presentation and speed that the food arrived gave us the distinct impression that we were eating at a cafeteria.  The overall service was passable, but felt forced, artificial and aloof.  Finally, the cost is very high for the meal and experience.  We didn't even stay for dessert because we were so disappointed.  Come if you want to try it out for the first time and/or love crab, but you would do yourself much justice by visiting Thanh Long (in the outer Sunset) instead or another fine restaurant in SF, rather than this tourist trap.", "author": "Supak C."}

I have always heard good things about this place, but upon entering the restaurant I was not impressed..The elevator to the front was very outdated and just in need of a renovation..We were seated and the tables seems very cramped up off the bat...I couldnt even stretch comfortably..We had a table that sat 4 so it was a tight place..We started out with the calamari appetizer and that was good, just a little on the salty side...next we ordered from the dine about town menu...we all ordered different things so that we could share and try everything....Our service was acceptable in the beginning of the night but then it slowly went downhill as the night progressed. It started when one of my friends ordered a cocktail and it never came till we just forgot about it. Our waitress started to give us attitude when we accidently spilled water on the table and the table cloth had to be changed, but maybe if the tabled wer'nt so cramped up we would have more room to sit at ease.....we were seated at 8pm, did not get our dine about town food until 945ish...it was almost ten and we just started to eat?!? My appetite was slowly diminishing...we asked for small plates and ordered more drinks and we all felt this attitude from our waitress escalating. She had this look she would give us when we asked for things. The Garlic noodles that everyone raves about was completely oily. To the point where I would move the noodles and in the middle of the plate was orange oil that would drench the noodles. We also had some beef and that was tough  to taste and unappealing. Sometimes service can eithier make or break your dinner experience, I have been to places where the food was not that good but the customer service of the place would make the difference for the food unless something out of the ordinary went bad with your food selections. To top off the night was receiving our desserts, 2 of my friends ordered the fried banana and the vanilla bean ice cream, another friend of mine and myself ordered the orange sorbet. The banana dessert was up to par, but my orange sorbet was like right out of the freezer or something, it was rock solid, could not even break my spoon into it to try it. We asked the waitress for hot water and we poured the water under the orange sorbet cup to soften it. it was awful...At this point I was so upset and just wanted to get out of there considering it was almost 12 midnite!! We were eating dessert at 1130pm...thats crazy! Another ill moment was when the waitress came with the hot towels to wash our hands. The towels were out of control SCORCHING HOT. It was so hot that I could not hold it and dropped it on the table, when I would hold the towel on the ends, steam was rising out the towel like there was no tomorrow.....If we were to wipe our hands with them off the bat they would probably give us a 1st degree burn ....The bill came out to 200 plus..we were not at all happy with the service we tipped less than what was average.This place is overrated.over-priced and because of other peoples experience years ago to this place could of been better, but as of today in 2010, I would not recommend it...

So we finally decided on sharing a crab and their fantastic garlic noodles... we put that order in and were about to decide on a bottle of wine when she magically disappeared again, so finally she came back and was annoyed with how long it was taking us to pick a wine... on top of that she kept trying to remove the full plate of our appetizer and asking if we were done... she definetly was either rushing to get home or rushing to get more tables... she made our experience very unwelcomed!!!! as she did the table next to us...

I was impressed as I thought we were really going to Crustacean's sister restaurant Thanh Longs. Hm...anyways, to the review.\n\nService was fast, fun, and friendly...well not really fun...just thought I'd throw that in :). Lets just say I wasn't disappointed with the service. Food was delicious. We had started with three small plates and later we had 3 crabs, and 4 garlic noodles to share amongst 6 people and a bowl of rice. I will start with the appetizer's. We had ordered the Fried Calamari, Skewered Chicken and the Vietnamese Carpaccio. I enjoyed all three, but the only one that didn't WOW me was the Skewered Chicken. I like those more at Thai or Malaysian Cuisines. As for the Crab, We had 2 roasted crabs and 1 Tamarind crab. Both crabs were DELICIOUS but I loved the roasted one more as I like my crab seasoned in a simple way. Aside from the crab, the next best thing were the garlic noodles. I think I've died and gone to garlic noodle heaven. I mean wow, I can't describe it. All I can say is you should go there, and just get the garlic noodles just to try it out. \n\nOverall, they get a 4.5/5 from me. Service was great, food was great and experience was great.

The An family restaurant legacy lives up to expectations both at the Crustacean and Thanh Long establishments - truly home to the famous garlic noodles. This is where families can get your crab bibs on. I can't decide which was better, the drunken or cracked whole roasted crab, but just thinking about it makes me miss those good ol' days of splurging on southeast asian style shell fish. It's been nearly a decade but I've never forgotten the amazing dishes there. From time to time, I'll read about the An family in food magazines. I even interviewed there for a PT hostess job once upon a time. I'm glad to see they're still around and looking forward to revisiting their concept restaurants.", "author": "Maly L."}

So I told her I craved garlic crab, so she suggested Thanh Long or somewhere in Fishermen's Wharf. I've been to ThanhLong & didn't want to drive to the Wharf. So we decided here. The atmosphere is very nice, upscale & has an Eastern flair to it. Both host & waiter were polite. Now, the price can be on the steep side. They consider their garlic noodle of $8 to be \"side order\". That's not a \"side order\" price man! Don't' get me wrong - the noodle was good. I got a soup - it was small, but full of flavor and good amount of seafood too. You gotta order the garlic crab! So I did & it was a good size, with finger-licking aromatic garlic oil & seasoning all around it. I definitely liked the coating of my crab. The downside is that I enjoy licking the crab shell more than savoring the crab meat. Why? The seasoning is all on the coating; it didn't get cooked into the crab meat. The crab meat tasted plain - like how I would steam it at home. This place is definitely worth the visit, I just don't know when I'll come back again - moving on, next.", "author": "Yum Y U M."}

If there was a choice, this will be the first restaurant in my 40yrs of life giving a zero star rating, but such is life, one star will do.\n\nGarlic Noodle with special sauce from the \"secret kitchen\" was nothing special. I only had half. I would have stopped after the first couple of mouthful but kept shovelling the noodles in because I'm half a pig and the allure of the special sauce that was playing in my head.\nHad to stop as I was gagging..no kidding.\n\nBroiled fish was also nothing special, in fact there was a little too much spices that completely took the subtle taste of the fish away. I do better at home by lightly seasoning the fish with turmeric and some salt, lightly pan fry or broiled.\n\nThe salt and pepper squid was tasteless. Really the food was no big deal. \n\nCrabs was so so too. Crabs are so easy to cook. I can cook better with a simple recipe of Chilli crab available online. I only took 25mins all up.\n\nThe place is overpriced, severely. It's full of make up and not much essence...one word..Hollywood. Just put up the plywood and veneer facade, not much underneath. It appeals to peoples vanity, especially stupid guys wanting to impress their GFs for a good night. You're better off twittering business like koji bbq truck and take her out to a club later. Save your money for something better, not the Crustacean. \n\nHave you also seen what the place looks like? It's kinda grotty and dingy. Do you really want to take your special GF here? Really? What about parking and the yucky area. It's not really Nob Hill. If you think it is, then you're a knob.\n\nWhat about the pretentious waiters? All trying hard to part you and your cash with expensive wine suggestions. I tried a 12.50 glass and you guessed it......no big deal.\n\nI grew up eating asian food and quite good at Vietnamese, Thai, Malay, Singaporean and Indian food, so I know good food. This place is as it describe: serving Fusion food...ie: a compromise. They change the great asian/vietnamese tastes for the local palette. So, some people with little or not  much food experience may be wowed by this place. However, I think they are wowed by how much their boyfriends spent and the pretentiousness of the place but not the food.\n\nSo, before you go, please check out other reviews. Ponder and think for a moment. The secret sauce may be secret but certainly not special. In fact is quite the opposite. Ask your BFs to take you out elsewhere...get a recommendation by word of mouth/friends/family/talk to people.\n\nGood Luck", "author": "Joe C."}

Not that I would, the place is loud, very loud. And of course, the only reason to come here is the crab and or garlic noodles, both of which you can get cheaper and better at plenty of other places. I went for Dine About Town, since Crustacean usually costs $49 a meal. First course is a choice of shrimp and green mango rolls, skewered chicken with asian pickled vegetables, or mixed greens with candied walnuts and orange vinaigrette. After looking at the normal menu, I noticed that the mixed greens were more expensive than the shrimp rolls and the skewered chicken, at $9.50! Rather odd, since when does cheap iceberg lettuce cost more than meat (and chicken at that), much less seafood, in this case, shrimp? So I had the mixed greens, which consisted of iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, red lettuce, and one piece of frisee, as well as the candied walnuts, a few pieces of orange, and orange vinaigrette. It was a sizeable amount, and gave me more bites than my friend's shrimp rolls. It was quite decent, not bad at all really. Second course was a choice of shaken beef (aka bo luc lac aka look luck beef) with jasmine steamed rice or prawn stir fry with An's garlic noodles. I suppose the garlic noodles are what Crustacean is famous for, but i think you get like 5 prawns (not much, even when they're jumbo). And one of my favorite Viet dishes that I always order is bo luc lac (along with ca kho tho and the sour [because of the pineapple chunks] catfish soup), so I got the shaken beef. It came with cherry tomatoes, like 2 or 3, not the generous amounts of tomato slices you get at other Viet restaurants. Also, the onions were sliced thin and were too few in number. You get a bowl of rice, which was just enough, and better than say a tiny cup of rice that some places offer. The beef was alright, but anybody who knows anything about bo luc lac knows that you serve it with a small saucer of salt, pepper, and lime juice on the side to dip the beef in. I asked for that, and was brought it, which made the entree so much better. Dessert was fried banana a la mode (vanilla ice cream) or orange cream sorbet. I had the fried banana, which was good. I liked the vanilla ice cream, it had a very good flavor. The decor has improved after an extensive remodeling. Service was fine. But I won't be coming back unless it's at a discount such as Dine About Town. Places like Crustacean annoy me because they proffer unauthentic food and whitewash themselves. The dumbasses will come if you call fish sauce a vinaigrette...The emperor has no clothes, and in this case, Helene An doesn't have an ao dai...", "author": "Hao L."}

(See my Long Thang review).  After a ridiculous experience at Long Thang, my Valentine's Day date (bf at the time) and I came here.  They have valet parking and I love that.  That's deserving of a few stars.  We arrived without reservations and were seated within probably 15 minutes.  Amazing!  We waited at the bar where the bartenders were very friendly and whipped up some delicious drinks for us.  We were told by the bartender that Jerry Rice was in the house and I thought that was pretty cool.  So then we finally got seated and who do we sit next to, Jerry Rice.  I'm not going to lie, but I didn't actually know what he looked like.  Yes, he was pointed out to me.  Anyway, besides that little celebrity sighting, we had a great little romantic spot in the restaurant.  We ordered crab, garlic noodles, and green beans.  I've never worn a bib in public, ok, that IS a lie, but at least not in a restaurant like that.  It was quite funny, but I'm glad I did because those crabs are messy.  And HUGE!  I only ate like half my crab and some of it went to my date.  I felt that the portions were pretty big.  I loved the food as it was a delicious treat.  As far as pricing goes, I'm not really sure about that, but life is too short to think about what you are spending money on.  It's just money and memories last forever.  Overall, I think my great experience here was based on the friendly service and tasty food.  I'd definitely go back.", "author": "Vanessa Z."}

As recommended by most diners we ordered the dungeness crab which came cooked heavily in oil (very greasy), and the garlic noodles.  Each crab costs $40.  While service is impeccable overall this place is way overpriced.  You can eat dungeness crab done better, less greasy at an authentic chinese restaurant in Chinatown for half the price.  And frankly the noodle is nothing to brag about.   The dress code requirement is also funny, especially since the location of this restaurant does not merit such a dress code....go figure out yourself if you want.", "author": "Harry L."}

We ordered the baked crab, an order of baked salmon, a side order of garlic noodles and 2 martinees. We ended up paying $102. I wouldn't cry to much about it if I at least got a baked potato, a soup or side salad or a piece of bread with the crab, or a 6 to 8 inch piece of salmon, but I got two 3 x 1 x  1 pieces and about 4 ounces of spinach.   Any bread,  salad,  potato come with the meal? I asked the waiter about it, although very nice, looked at me like I hadn't had my psychotropic meds for the day and said quite dryly, \"no\". I spent $102 and all I got was a crab on my plate with nothing to go with it, 2 small pieces of salmon that would have had my 4 year old daughter still starving and a bowl of noodles. In Chicago, for that amount of money, I could sit down with 2 20 ouch steaks, a side salad, twice baked potato, 2 drinks a piece ,still have enough to tip the waiter the 17 percent and put a little gas in the tank.

Okay, first of all, the location of this place is NOTHING like the ones in Beverly Hills and Vegas.  You had to take an elevator to the third floor and the elevator was old and rotten.  Once you stepped inside you were greeted by the usual Crustacean's decor.  However, the view leaves much to be admired.  I swore that in any moment I'd see a drug transaction go down or a transsexual hooker would approach one of her/his clients.  I kept looking out the window expecting to see a police chase or something while my boyfriend kept singing \"The Freaks Come Out At Night.\"  Well, gotta give it to them for the street entertainment.

Mind you, the Giants were a 13-point underdog, and being a real fan, I offered the bet straight up. Winner picks the restaurant, loser pays. Karma rewarded my faith, and we hit Crustacean (www.anfamily.com). Crustacean is a family-run Vietnamese seafood house. Their signature dish is their whole dungeness crab prepared 3 different ways- the Roasted Crab (garlic), the Drunken Crab (wine, scallions and black pepper), and the Tamarind Crab (red Vietnamese sweet and spicy sauce). This night, I went with the Drunken Crab, but I have had all three and probably lean toward the Roast Crab. But seriously, it's not like you can make a bed selection. We started with numerous appetizers- the salt and pepper calamari were excellent. But the absolute must here is getting the An's Garlic Noodles as a side dish to whatever you get. There is a secret kitchen in each Crustacean location, protecting the family recipes, and my guess is that the Garlic Noodles is the dish they are most concerned with protecting.", "author": "Steakhead .."}

The restaurant seems to always have a steady flow of customers on the weekend, and they always seem packed whenever I go. They take reservations and are a bit on the \"fancy\" side in that they don't allow athletic wear; however, they have shirts on hand for anyone who isn't appropriately dressed. I think this is a bit over the top and unnecessary, but I guess it works for them. The ambiance is cozy and dimly lit, and in my opinion the best tables are the booths that overlook California Street. I always order the garlic noodles - they are lovely and oily and drenched in garlic. Probably the best noodles I've ever had. Their crab is also fantastic - this is what most people seem to go there for. I've also had a few of their seafood appetizers as well as the salmon entree - always perfectly cooked and delicious. They don't accept phone orders for takeout; however, if you go over  there, you can place an order in person and then wait and/or come back to pick up your order. They have a 'sister' restaurant over in the sunset called Thanh Long which is just as good and is a bit more on the casual side.

The staff is very nice and pleasant the ambiance is beautiful they are opening another location in Palo Alto and I can't wait ! If you dine here the Garlic noodles and Butter Garlic Crab is a must! This is by far my favorite restaurant.", "author": "Lexi T."}

The maitre d' looked like he's working for a mortuary.  High price, bad food, unlow average service.  I won't go back even if they pay me.", "author": "win win w."}

Both places have the best garlic noodle and crabs, they probably put a ton of butter in it but who cares, it's SO good.  Minus one star for being in a shady ghetto area and prices are a bit higher compared to other places like PPQ (garlic noodle and crabs are just as good).  I guess we're paying more $$$ for the ambiance.", "author": "Kate L."}

I have certainly heard rave reviews about The Slanted Door which lives up to its reputation of excellent and innovative Vietnamese food.\nSo I was quite curious to try this Crustacean's restaurant. Maybe it will be another good place to go for decent Vietnamese food.  \nWe arrived at the restaurant on time and were told to wait because one of us was not there. The missing person was actually trying to park the car in a busy neighborhood.  We told the maitre d', to no avail,   that we would be ordering immediately and did not need to wait for the missing person.  When the latter joined us, we were told courtly that since we did not make it to our reservation within 15 minutes, we'd have to wait for  the next available table, 1 hour and 45 minutes later. The staff at Crustacean need to be taught that no reputable restaurant will condone such poor demeaner and total disregard for their customer.  While we were waiting, I also witnessed them \"toy\" with other customers by making them go and change their clothes as if we, their customer, must oblige by their rules to be deserving of their food and service. Who would pay for overpriced food and subject themselves to their humiliating scrutiny and lack of manners?", "author": "Tracy D."}

I too had the garlic noodles which was the best I have ever had. However, it wasn;t an inviting restaurant. It is true if you have money, you like to splurge or have a special ocassion then it is a okay place to go. I can find other restaurants with the same quality of food and pricing of food and recieve good service and a welcoming atmosphere. This place lacks the welcoming atmosphere. As my husband and I walked in we were not greeted but was told that my husband had to have a dress shirt on before he can step into the restaurant. They had some dress shirts to borrow. A restaurant that makes you dress a certain way is not a place for me, because you can't be yourself in a restaurant. Our waiter didn't come and visit our table often. I have counted only once to check up on us. We thought maybe we didn;t order the more expensive stuff. We didn;t get a friendly welcome and we felt that we weren't treated equally as well. So I will never come back.", "author": "L C."}

It  was made perfect.  Great wine list.  The bartenders were awesome.  Made some great drinks.  I'm not sure why other people are complaining about this place, must have been in a bad mood.  This was my second time there and this time we sat across from Jerry Rice, he was such a gentleman, said he's been coming here for over 10 years.  The server was efficient but I was paying attention to my date.  Of course I'll be back......", "author": "Jeffrey H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-02-06", "description": "Compared to the parent restaurant where this originated from they solely need a revamp themselves on how Thanh Long does their food. We ordered the lobster rolls and got a crunchy but hot wet  Lobster(?) filling. l Could not identify what it was but it did not taste like lobster at all. The accompaning sauce was too sweet and obtrussive to anything delicated as lobster. The waiter recommeded the seafood salad and roasted crab. The seafood salad was a mix of thick jullienne chops of red and green pepper with a creamy sauce that was dilluted by the wetness of the vegetables that it made it look like tasteless coleslaw with seafood on top. The crab was weired also, it was hot one side but cold on the other. The oil they cooked and drenched it with tasted burned and we could see burned pieces of onion underneath the crab. So for $75 dollars, I am sure I would have gotten better food somewhere else.", "author": "T S."}
