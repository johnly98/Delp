I first stopped in here during SF Beer Week and it was probably my favorite spot on the pub crawl. The music playing in this lovely bar was the best mix of 70's and 80's hits and made our time spent here even more fun! We managed to order quite a few of your standard bar drinks : vodka sodas, whiskey gingers, etc., and all of them were well made and on-point. No watered down drinks here! A couple of added bonuses that make this place extra amazing are their popcorn offerings, pool table, and dog friendly attitude. I am all about a laid-back, friendly, fun, welcoming space and Northstar really does have it all! Kudos to the bartenders for their quick service and attentiveness. The only teensie, tiny (no pun intended) detail that I might mention wasn't so up-to-par was their miniature restrooms. Somehow they managed to squeeze a washroom into the tiniest of spaces and somehow, people have figured out a way to utilize it when in dire straits! I, myself had to squeeze into the restroom to relieve myself and let me tell you...it was no easy feat! While the restroom is the least of my concerns when visiting an establishment, I do appreciate a regular sized one that doesn't make me feel like a circus freak, or incredibly claustrophobic. That being said, I still give this place 5 stars for winning in every other category!", "author": "Jennifer C."}

During the week, pool is free. They also serve free popcorn if you ask.

It tends to get suuuuuper busy on the weekends, so be prepared if you don't like crowded areas. I tend to just come on Sundays or during the week.\n\nTheir bathroom is tiny, one stall of guys and one for girls, but honestly, I've never had to wait long to use the restroom, and it's kept relatively clean considering how crowded it can get. \n\nEven though I no longer live in the city, I try to drop by whenever I'm back. \n\nOverall, if you want a chill dive bar to hang out at with some awesome, down to earth bartenders, come here!", "author": "Jessica Y."}

It was his suggestion, and after reviewing Yelp I was prepared for the worst. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised and had a really great time.\n\nFor starters, the place was not packed. I suppose this was because it was Sunday afternoon and the local sports teams had been eliminated from competition, so that reduced the number of folks inside. In turn, we had a really great table against the wall, offering a great view of the TVs, with easy access to the bar. Score.\n\nThe location of this place is also a plus, as it is close to numerous pizza joints. This meant I was able to run out, grab a pie for my friends, and enjoy it at the bar. Nobody working there said anything, which is also nice. Pizza and beer at a bar with big screen TVs. Win.\n\nDrinks were reasonable, but I don't like the $20 minimum credit charge.

A pig-skin and booze loving gem of a tavern thoughtfully situated on the corner of Powell and Green.  WAIT!  It's also an LSU football hub for alumni and fans on Saturdays?!?  Correction, I found a little piece of Tiger heaven that was cosmically placed in a consecrated spot in North Beach.\n\nA divey atmosphere with spectacular service and a friendly crowd to boot.  The most popular tip I've read about this place was that it has free pool (one pool table) and free popcorn (you'll know when it's time for that).  This review will only recognize the Saturday festivities during football season when this establishment gets turned into a purple and gold affair.  Here's the magical part that will make even the biggest non-LSU and non-football fan a believer in Saturday as the new Funday: $3 domestics, $4 Blue Moon draft; $3 Tiger Claw (a shot consisting of vodka, cranberry & razz-ma-tazz), $4 Abita Amber, $4 Abita Purple Haze.  My boyfriend and I drank for the entire LSU/Kent St. game for a whopping $40!  That's 3 hours of back-to-back brewskies into the empty abyss known as our guts.  An added loveliness, perhaps highlight to some, of Saturdays at Northstar is the appearance of Family Meal, a splendidly appetizing pop-up that does only bar food.  On Saturdays they bring out the southern hospitality as well as the culinary crafts of home town cooking to make you want to wrestle alligators while slurping down a dozen oysters.  These reminiscent dishes range from traditional red beans and rice, shrimp and okra gumbo, New Orleans style BBQ shrimp, bread pudding and more.  They update their twitter with locations and menu items for your perusing.  \n\nAs much as I'm boasting about Northstar as my alma mater's stomping grounds, they also cater and welcome other teams and schools.  This is SF, so all your Cali teams are represented appropriately.  But, bear your purple and gold pride and you'll open your Saturdays to a life of worthwhile camaraderie.  #AllNewFriends.  Come experience some great football, great food and great service.  Don't be a Debbie Downer.\n\nSide Note: Slowly solidifying Ryan L.'s (a Texan, born and bred - important if you know about the ongoing Texas/Louisiana battle of the football beasts) love for me and the Tigers, thanks to Northstar's sensationally spectacular Saturdays.

There were various college football games on TV saturday night including Cal, but UW was on one of the other TVs. The bartender was very happy to change one of the TVs in order to get the game on a TV where we could sit and watch the game.\n\nThe bar was pretty cool. Not too nice, but not too bad either. There was the main bar, then some tall tables and chairs with another room that had a few booths and a pool table in the middle with about 6 flat screens. \n\nGreat experience! I had someone yell \"Washington! Boo!\", but that's part of the fun of a sports bar. The bartender even introduced himself to me later and said that anytime I come in, he'll have the game on. Too bad I don't live in SF, or I'd be here for every Husky game. He even came by later when we made a good play and gave me the fist.

It's true, there are no yuppies or popped collars here, but that's what makes this place go great; its come as you are and you will always be treated like a king/queen. \n\nI first heard about this place from a friend when I began my fundraising for Team in Training. I was so overwhelmed and didn't really know what to do or how to raise the $2100 I had promised to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Prior to calling Northstar I had just had a Happy Hour at a newly opened cupcake shop. At the cupcake shop fundraiser we packed in about 50 people and everyone was drinking, eating, and ordering up a storm. I was guessing by the sheer numbers (even the owner said that they hadn't had that many people in the shop since they had opened, which was months ago). that I would get a hefty donation. Not so much. They gave me $50 and called it a day. Super disappointing! So, I gave Northstar a call and set up a Happy Hour. In four hours I raised a couple hundred dollars. It was AMAZING, especially since I only really had about 10 of my guests show up. I couldn't be happier with Northstar and will always give them my business and refer them to anyone looking for a great spot to hang out and have a beer (esp fundraisers!!!)", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-11-03", "description": "I like this place during the day on Saturday or Sunday. It's a great place to lounge, nurse a hang over, bring your own food (and dog if you like), and just watch sports. Total dive bar, and I can't quite understand how this place gets so packed at night, but it does. I would give it five if this place didn't resemble a solid brick of frat boys on Saturday night.", "author": "Tim Y."}

Saturday nights get pretty rowdy and there are always more guys than girls. Go on off nights and they are usually the best nights. Its a good place to watch sports. I watched the bball playoffs here last year and it was grrrreaaaat! Warriors beating the MAVS!! Good times. Alot of interesting and diverse people comin in and out of this place. Just Saturday nights get a little Fratty.", "author": "Ash D."}

I love Ed and Seb makes an awesome Bloody Mary.  A great drinking bar, guaranteed that you will get hammered when you come here.  The drinks are strong and the bartenders will buy you one if you are there for a while - that's the way it should be!  Better to come during the week than on the weekend when the Marina crowd invades.  A great place to watch sports, especially on a Sunday afternoon.  One of the best bars in the City!  Unfortunately I am not the only one who thinks so however.", "author": "Kristina M."}

Happy hour is looooooong (1-8, M-F) and a stellar deal ($3 wells and drafts).  On the weekends during the day the place is a total pickle jar, it's like someone ripped the needle off the record the way all the heads turn when a girl walks in (I like sports too).  On the weekend nights it's a busy spot, and full of North Beach restaurant industry types.  The bartenders are friendly and pour a fair shot.  I have met some good people and some bad hangovers as a result of this spot, which bills itself as the home of \"drinking consultants since 1883\".  Try their bloody mary, it's top drawer.  The \"cafe\" part of their name is a misnomer, unless you count the free popcorn.  The Northstar overall is a great little neighborhood booze mill.", "author": "Amanda B."}
