They have an excellent selection of baked goods, including, vegan, dairy-free, gluten-free options form donuts to date rolls to many other coffee accouterments.\n\nThis is a pour-over coffee paradise. Be prepared for the owner to recommend the right coffee (he tunes into you), by specifying if you are light, dark or medium roast person. I picked dark, and he recommended an excellent crop from Brazil. My friend picked medium, and he recommended Ethiopia. She knows her coffee, and as a SF native, she felt this was right at the top.\n\nThey also have almond, half and half and many types of milk choices, as well as the less adventurous lattes, mochas, teas, espressos. \n\nThe owner said their secret sauce is customer service - and we experienced the warmth and genuine passion of a master barista, who hand picks the shop's blends.", "author": "Sam K."}

And the coffee was the best I've had in San Francisco- so much better than Blue Bottle and Philz and what it. And the coffee was CHEAP too- around $3 for a double shot of espresso and a little more for a large freshly ground coffee- everything is brewed to order. The owners apparently handmade all of the pastries and breads and cookies and things.\n\nI wish I had gotten the name of the barista because she was awesome. Super welcoming, provided excellent recommendations, and pulled fantastic shots of espresso and brewed great coffee. I was going to get one of their food items and she said it was on the house due to it being my first visit. They have several different roasts of coffee and espresso. They use Ubuntu beans which I loved and as a bonus, it was all fair trade and organic. \n\nI truly loved everything about this spot. It is tiny and there are just 3 tables outside, though they do have wifi and if you're there on a nice day, it would be good to enjoy your coffee outside. Fantastic coffee, excellent prices, amazing service- I'd give this place more stars if I could. My only wish is that it wasn't on the other side of town of me.

I think I've had better iced coffee from Starbucks. \n\nThat particular batch must've been made terribly, because it was not at all what cold brew should taste like.

On a rare free weekday morning, I decided to alleviate my piqued state and take a long ride on the 14 to that neighborhood south of Cesar Chavez where you find that urban enclave of taquerias and hipster hangouts like Emmy's Spaghetti Shack and Baby Blues BBQ. I think I walked by CoffeeShop at least twice before realizing it was the bright green space with the glass door (photo:  ). At first, I was delighted there was only one customer ahead of me, but that situation changed quickly as regulars started trickling in at an alarming pace.\n\nLuckily I had the wherewithal to get my order in quickly and decided on the $4.75 Mocha which the barista made lightning quick in preparation of the incoming crowd. It was a satisfying concoction with a swirl of chocolate syrup on a billowy spritz of whipped cream (photo: http://bit.ly/1V3WYrE). But then after reading Ruggy's review, I realize now that I should have given the $5 Sherpa Coffee a try with such unusual ingredients as Kerrygold butter and coconut oil blended into the coffee. Maybe next time. In the meantime, I also ordered a $4 Latke with raisin-freckled applesauce and whipped cream just to nibble on as I sat outside at one of the two cafe tables.\n\nThis is when the barista was working like a highly organized madman accommodating multiple orders, so much so that I thought for sure my order fell into an abyss. I was about to give up and leave, but I gave it the old college try by swimming upstream through the waiting crowd and reminding him of my latke order. Since more than twenty minutes elapsed, he felt terrible about his oversight and gave me a complementary peanut butter cookie for my patience. Oh and the latke, too (photo: http://bit.ly/1WiNIyn), which ended up being on the lukewarm side for all his trouble.

I love coffee and I've been meaning to check out CoffeeShop for a while to try their unique iced lattes that actually have microfoam and coffee ice cubes and to try the cold brew coffee that is also served with coffee ice cubes.  I love that the coffee won't be diluted as the ice melts.  Their coffee has a smooth, nutty flavor to it (not overly acidic like a lot of other coffee shops around).  So, I checked out on Yelp and it said they were open until 6 PM, so we hopped over around 5:40 PM hoping to get in before they closed.\n\nI ordered an iced latte and an iced coffee and was disappointed when the barista put regular ice cubes rather than the coffee ice cubes I had been reading about in my drink!  When I later asked about it, he said that they had completely run out because of the hot weather and they had sold 768 iced coffees during the day and that they were actually \"closed\".  The last statement was rather confusing to me because their hours are clearly listed until 6 PM and the door was wide open, which indicated to me that they were still open for business.  Now, I completely understand that they would have run out of coffee ice cubes because it's impossible to be able to predict how many they would sell in a day and it's clear that their freezer/fridge can only hold so many ice cube trays!  However, I wish that he would have warned me when I ordered the drink that they were out of coffee ice cubes and would have to substitute with regular...that would have definitely changed my order.  To offer a non-perfect cup without warning me, or offering maybe a discount,  seemed inconsistent in product delivery.\n\nAnyway, the coffee was definitely delicious and I was super impressed with the cold microfoam in the latte.

So.... not sure what that was about.\n\nThe other employee won't make eye contact or in any way acknowledge the next customer until he is finished with the previous customer.

I didn't mention it because I'm not into making things awkward, or wasting food. \n\nThe few points I would like to make before I go:\n\nAll customers should be treated THE EXACT SAME WAY when they walk in. \n\nAn employee should NEVER show more attention to a regular-or any person you know-than you do to a stranger. It is rude. \n\nAn employee should be able to do math. Everybody should. An employee should be able to count a customer's change back to them. Your drawer will NEVER be off. Plus, people will KNOW you know what you are doing.  \n\n(ie: if I pay $4.20 to you by way of a $20, you should say: .80 makes 5, $5 makes 10, $10 makes 20, and you should give me $$15.80 back.  Don't just hand me $15.80 and say here's $15.80, because it might not be. But if you count it back, you will know it is.", "author": "D M."}

Being that I'm usually on work travel when visiting SF, I can't easily store things in a hotel refrigerator (butter, specifically). That means I have to rely on a savvy coffee shop that's bought into the benefits of adding butter + coconut oil to the morning cup of Joe for an extreme jolt of mental clarity. That coffee shop is, well, CoffeeShop.\n\nHere they call it Sherpa Coffee. For the uninitiated, the creator of Bulletproof Coffee (Dave Asprey) experienced a tea version using yak butter when trekking through Tibet with a group of sherpas. They drink yak butter tea to give them the mental fortitude and energy levels to mount a giant edifice in extreme weather conditions. If it works for these Nepalese adventurers, surely it can create an edge in your day to day tasks, right? It's starting to take off, and places like CoffeeShop are early adopters. If you think drinking butter and coconut oil in your coffee sounds strange, you're not alone. I did too. But after trying it once, it's been part of my daily routine ever since. Not just effective in giving your brain some much needed fats, but also delicious. It's similar to a latte, but in my opinion, it's much tastier. \n\nOf course they have other offerings besides Sherpa Coffee here. They also feature the ubiquitous pour overs, espresso classics, and savory latkes and breakfast pastries. With a friendly staff as well, it's a no-brainer destination to start your day if you reside in the neighborhood.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

I really didn't want to have to do this but the coffee I had at the CoffeeShop was probably one of the worst I've ever had. It was bad enough to make me write a review and I've never been bothered to do that before. It wasn't even the fact that the girl was completely new and should of satisfied the owners tastes firsts before even being allowed to serve coffee to customers. It was the fact that the guy behind the counter( I'm assuming the owner) allowed this girl to serve a latte by literally rapidly pouring the warmed milk into a shot of coffee and not even watch her. I could of got a better coffee at McDonald's. I'm sure this is not indicative of the place as a whole but if the owners see this review.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-11", "description": "My body doesn't play well with bulletproof coffee. \n\nBack when I was heavily addicted to caffeine due to my schedule of having to wake up at 4am in the morning to yell at people to exercise before heading off to work for 12 hours, I would make myself bulletproof coffee every morning with Stumptown coffee from my french press, 1oz of Kerrygold Unsalted Grassfed Butter, and a tbsp of Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil. \n\nDue to the weird mix of  not enough REM sleep for about a year straight, mixed with the fact that I was always stressed because I found myself always on the go, muddled up on top of it with the adrenaline rush of attending some sort of crisis at any given moment, my body apparently thrived on the hellish combination of caffeine + MCT oils + fat soluble vitamins and eventually started to adapt to the giant energy surge it provided in the mornings.\n\nSorry for the long, run-on-ish anecdote, but this is where the above becomes somewhat relevant. Fast-forward about six months after I stopped needing to wake up so early in the morning and was no longer plagued by 12+ hour workdays to my current state of not having to do pretty much anything all day. I was back home in California hanging out with my friends, living a life free from the clawing death grip of caffeine as I had absolutely no need to wake up early or maintain some level of lucidity in the morning.\n\nI stumbled into CoffeeShop with a friend after a night of Blackout (it's like beer pong, but with 76 or so cups on each side) and I had discovered after parking at a nearby restaurant where we had our hangover meal that I had a flat tire. After dropping off my car at a nearby mechanic, we decided to walk around to see if there were any caf\u00e9s and coffee shops nearby, and voila, Yelp had told me that there's a coffee shop called CoffeeShop just half a block away.\n\nAs many of the reviews before mine may have indicated already, CoffeeShop is a small, unpretentious, community-centric establishment run by a stand up guy named Wilson. After a brief chat, I was able to discern that Wilson fully embraces the idea of extroverted communities and believes that his CoffeeShop should serve as a place where people come to take a moment and appreciate each other  and the world around them while drinking delicious coffee (the coffee that he roasts/serves on site is very aptly named ubuntu coffee)\n\nLike the other coffee giants that call the Bay Area home, Wilson produces some quality hand-dripped coffee from a variety of well-curated bean choices, while offering up some amazing specialty menus like the dirty matcha latte, the cowgirl coffee, and the iced coffee with the coffee ice cubes.\n\nNow back to my Bulletproof Coffee story. So after about four weeks of not drinking coffee on a daily basis, I ordered a pour-over with the Nicaraguan. A few seconds later, I glanced over to his LCD monitor menu (which seemed to be running a ubuntu-like GUI) and noticed something called the \"Sherpa\" which Wilson told me was Bulletproof Coffee. Intrigued, I asked Wilson if he could make me a Sherpa using the pour-over I just ordered, and he gladly complied after which he gave me what looks like a Starbucks \"grande\" size cup filled to the brim with caffeine, MCT oil, and saturated fats. \n\nI can't quite narrow it down to one cause/suspect, but basically the ungodly matrimony of the above gave me a caffeine high so severe that I skipped the phase where I bounce around everywhere like a hyperactive EDM bopper on MDMA, and went straight to feeling like my mind was trying to escape my body. It was to the point where if I stopped moving or walking for even a single second, my body would become so antsy that I would get the urge to take off in a full-on sprint; my friend and I went to visit some friends that we hadn't seen in a few years while my car was getting fixed after stopping by at Wilson's, and I had an extremely difficult time trying to sit still and listen to my friends tell me what they'd been doing for the past few years (Robe and Alex, if you're by any chance reading this, I apologize for my behavior that day)\n\nLong story short and personal anecdotes aside, yet another quality San Francisco joint that I plan on frequenting the next time I'm back in town. Oh and if I haven't said it already, Wilson is a stand-up guy.", "author": "Scott S."}

The signs small, but if you know that the place is painted all green, it'll most definitely catch your eye!\n\nSmall selection of pastries but all looking very tasty! I couldn't help but buy the chai flavored pastries. ALSO, THEY HAVE MACARONS! I did not feel like macarons at the time, but if you were wondering, they cost $1.75 each.\n\nThe owner was very delightful, and made each coffee and tea with care. I really liked that. I've been too use to the rush and busy feeling you get at regular coffee shops (Starbucks etc.). The little store made me just want to take a moment and just enjoy my latte.

Why is he the best?  Put simply, because he puts love into every coffee pour, and he makes the customer feel warm and happy with his affable and kindhearted nature.  If you want iced coffee, ask him to show you his stash of frozen coffee-based ice cubes, which he uses to make the iced coffee extra tasty and strong.  If you want a green tea latte, it's delectable! Order a Yerba Matte and he'll give you the whole gourde and bombilla set to enjoy.  \n\nNot only has Wilson done his homework about coffee prep, he excitedly shares amazing facts about the cutting edge technology and artful techniques, which he applies to every pour.  Wilson is an artist when he works, and he's damn good at his craft.  \n\nBut here's what makes The Coffee Shop truly outstanding: it's the way Wilson treats his costumers from the moment they enter the shop until the moment they leave: with intention, compassion, and care.  I love getting my coffee from Wilson because I get such a wonderful social experience with the coolest, hippest, and talented barista-owner-operator-human being in San Francisco.  So go brighten your day and get caffeinated at The Coffee Shop - serving the best coffee in town.", "author": "Allen K."}

The owner seems to be very proud of his cold brew and gave me a decently-sized free sample, (correctly) assuming that if I tried it I would ask for a regular serving. The ice cubes are made of coffee so you can enjoy your iced coffee without worrying about it getting diluted. I've only tried one of the donuts - maple pecan - but it was very good as well - very moist and just sweet enough.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-05", "description": "My 25 year old son and I found ourselves on Mission and decided to check out this small treasure of a coffee shop.  My son is more the aficionado than I when it comes to all things coffee and swears that this was absolutely the best cup of iced coffee he's ever tasted.  The coffee is cold brewed and served over coffee ice cubes so it never becomes diluted.  His coffee had a slight almost fruity quality to it that was just delicious with absolutely no bitter aftertaste.  Mine was freshly brewed decaf and was more \"coffee tasting\" than any decaf I've ever had - again, no bitterness and somehow also a perfect intensity with no dilution as one would expect with freshly brewed and iced coffee.  The taste was the closest I've ever had to coffee in Italy.  In addition, the pastries were fabulous - especially the banana apple walnut cake, made with incredibly fresh ingredients and a recipe that the owner, Wilson, has been perfecting for many months (redolent with cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg and the most wonderful hint of salt) - stop fiddling Wilson, it's perfect!  The place itself is cozy, tiny, and reflective of Wilson, the owner - completely welcoming and unpretentious, and just, well, a place you want to go back to again and again.  Coffee is locally sourced from a roaster in Emeryville.  It made our day to visit, meet Wilson and take our time enjoying his fabulous coffee. I've no doubt we'll be back again and again.", "author": "Amy C."}
