Won't reveal the name here but hint: it's on Florida St in the Mission. \n\nDecided to give Lana Thai a try since I got parking right in front.   Ordered their lunch combo special -pad Thai, curry chicken, and rice. At $6.95 it seams like a deal.   So disappointed that it's all carbs- a scoop of rice, pad Thai ( just the noodles with some mediocre flavor and a couple of lonely bean sprouts, a few morsels of eggs. \n\nThe chicken curry part was about 5 or 6 tablespoons , consisting mostly of curry sauce, 2 baby carrots, 2 bits of potatoes. and 2 teeny bits of chicken not even the size of a chicken McNugget.  Where's the chicken??  \n\nLesson learned : you get what you pay for.  If you want friendly service, no wait, carbs to fill the tummy, this is your place.  Any other expectation, look elsewhere. \n\nGiving it 2 stars cuz the owners are very nice, but food wise, nah.  Sorry - won't be back . \n.", "author": "mimi l."}

I noticed that some Yelpers stated that there were differences in the Yelp hours and the pictures of the restaurant's hours. Even when we went during the restaurant's hours, they were closed! \n\nThe second time I came back here with my mom and all was well. The restaurant was opened. We specifically came back the second time to order the stuffed chicken. We placed our order and drank our tea (btw they charge 1.25$ for tea). The server (he's also the owner of the restaurant) reported back to us that they were out of stuffed chicken. To our dismay, we ended up ordering the Pad Thai dish and the garlic pork chop dish.\n\nFinally, after learning our lesson multiple times, I called the restaurant specifically to ask if they had stuffed chicken. I was expecting a \"No sorry we ran out\" or even a \"Yes we do,\" but I was left listening to a dial tone. Even when the hours were specifically stated that they'd be open, apparently they were closed.\n\nDays later, I called to ask if the stuffed chicken was available and the owner said yes. I ordered takeout and went to pick it up. Let me just tell you, all those times of perseverance paid off...\n\nbecause their stuffed chicken is so so so delicious. They stuff the chicken with vermicelli and cabbage (aka Heaven). The vegetables on the side are cooked with butter. The sauce they provide with the stuffed chicken is like a universal sauce they give as a side for other dishes.\n\nMoral of the story: Call a restaurant before arriving, you never know if they decided to open or close. Make sure to ask if they have that one specific item you're looking for. Their Thai food differs from King of Thai or other Thai restaurants because they literally cook it there fresh for you; you can taste it! I hate how good their stuffed chicken is because now I'll keep wanting more, even when their hours of operation are fluctuating.", "author": "Erica K."}

I grew up in this neighborhood and would walk down the street and pick up lunch/dinner from here when I was in High School. Now that I am a \"grown up,\" I still come here. I bring everyone here - my family, my friends, my clients, etc.! \n\nPro's:\n- It is a small family owned business (love this, because I have a small family business)! The husband runs around and takes care of his guests, while the wife (Hi Lanna!) does all of the cooking in the back. Both the husband and wife are extremely friendly and just the sweetest!\n- The food quality. Yes, I have been to many great Thai restaurants in San Francisco but after actually going to Thailand, this place does not compare to the rest. It is AUTHENTIC! I feel as though I am right back in the right of Bangkok and eating the most delicious street food. My favorite's - shrimp appetizer, spring rolls, pad thai, red curry and my mom/ and fiance love the pork chops.\n- The price... All I can say is WOW! I feel like they have never raised their prices! You can literally dine here with 5 people and not go over $100. Where else in San Francisco can you get that?! \n- Corkage fee is only $8 (I suggest you bring your own bottle of wine here)\n- I'm not sure why people call this a hole in the wall. Sure, it's not fancy, but it's clean, warm and nicely decorated! The table in the middle is perfect for parties of 10 and more! \n\nCon's:\n- I'm honestly trying to think of one and I can't. Maybe the fact that sometime's it can take a while to get the food, but keep in mind, there's only one person in the back cooking so just be patient! OR... TIP: order in advance. When we come here with a large party, I always call a few appetizers in so once we arrive, they're already on the table!\n\nLove, love, love this place!

It had the homemade flavor striking a balance inclusive of the signature fish sauce, spicy chili, savory soy sauce, and sweet tamarind.  It left me comfortably satisfied without any repugnant greasiness.  At $7.45 for dinner, I definitely want to brag that I have found the quintessential hidden gem in this random mini restaurant row in Noreiga, except it was a friend's suggestion so unfortunately I can't take credit (citing my sources!)\n\nThe ambiance is cute, very homey Thai decor with tropical touches... they should share decorations with the tiki bar down the street.  Service is cute too, as in family run business cute--I'm not sure though, so don't go about in a frenzy slapping on a local business sticker on their window. \n\nAs if inexpensive and tasty and cute were not enough to make this a new go-to Thai place, they have lunch specials as well as daily specials.  The online menu is helpful, as it contains prices, descriptions, and pictures (photos are not dSLR food porn pro level, but makes me crave Thai food nonetheless).

San Francisco is not one city but a cluster of culinary micro-climates like the heavily Asian fog bank that makes up this stretch of Noriega in the Outer Sunset. My massage therapist (yes, I have one...sometimes...don't judge me!) recommended it to me a while ago, and he looks like a very healthy eater with a penchant for spicy Southeast Asian by way of his Malaysian-bred wife. So I convinced Jamie W. to make the trek with me to try it on an evening where we felt the need to try something healthy. We didn't accomplish \"healthy\", but we managed to have some surprisingly good eats for the drive. \n\nWe started with a hearty $6.95 bowl of Tohm Kah, the coconut milk soup with chicken, mushroom, baby corns, green onion, lemongrass and lemon juice (see photo). Perfect starter on a cold night. The $6.25 order of Chicken Satay came with a couple of skewers marinated in curry paste and accompanied by the all-critical peanut sauce with a nice consistency (see photo). Entrees were solid. We went even more predictable with the $7.25 Pad Kee Mao, which offered the thick chow fun noodles mixed with chicken, broccoli and bok choy (see photo). \n\nJamie went back to his Kentucky roots when he was drawn to the $8.50 Barbecue Chicken, which came with four big pieces slathered with a sweet curry sauce that wasn't too overwhelming (see photo). It didn't seem like a particularly Thai dish but who cares. We should have been sated, but we decided to try the desserts since we made room. The $2.75 Flan was delicious enough, but the standout was the $3.75 Fried Banana with Coconut Ice Cream. Fried with a crunchy crust and a nice contrast to the bracing coconut flavor of the ice cream (see photos). Definitely worth a trip out to the far reaches of the Sunset for us downtown types. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...excellent Thai dishes, well priced \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...compact place, could do without the lotto boards \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...good though attention wavers when big parties come in \nTOTAL - 4 stars...barbecue chicken and fried bananas almost give this Thai place a country twang", "author": "Ed U."}

I chose the restaurant because I wanted something not too far from home or school, because I have school right after, night classes really suck. After reading and finding this on yelp (maybe half a year ago) I really really wanted to try this place, that's why it's been bookmarked FOREVER on yelp & Mozilla. I came here once before, but I think I came too early on a weekday for lunch, so ended up going elsewhere. I FINALLY had the chance to go today.\n\nI was reluctant to go because she always takes pictures of EVERYTHING, and it's so embarrassing...I guess it informs the yelp community by taking pictures of everything. I sometimes do that too, I wonder if it's embarrassing for others. She takes pics of the place and the FOOD. If I'm starving, she has to take a perfect picture (and the first shot is never good enough) of the food before anyone can eat, so I always try to mess it up by eating the food before she remembers to take a picture, I'm so evil. She even took a picture of my water today. It wasn't so embarrassing today, since there weren't many people.\n\nI looked at their website prior to coming and it showed that everyday had a special, except Sunday (I guess they rest on the Sabbath Day). Today for lunch, it wasn't crowded, only another group of people were there. \n\nToday is Monday, so I had Monday's daily special which is Pad Thai & Panang Curry with Chicken. Out of all the specials, I would say Monday's seemed the most appetizing to me, you get PAD THAI & PANANG CURRY WITH CHICKEN, a good deal to me since I probably would have gotten that anyways. Both items were good. Curry came with rice and pad thai was yummy too. Lots of variety for only $6.29.\n\nI would come back during other days to see what all the other specials are like.", "author": "Kylie L."}

The Pad Thai came with 3 prawns and the rest was a clump of very dry noodles without much flavor: probably some of the worst I've had.\n\nI'd like to give a third star for the Rama Thai, as the combination of delicious peanut sauce, chicken, and spinach was excellent... the only problem was that the entire portion could be consumed in a few bites, which was disappointing (again) for the $7 it costs for that one \"special.\"\n\nGlad that there are plenty of other Thai restaurants around, as my search for a good one must continue.", "author": "Justine M."}

Juicy and stuffed with ground pork and noodles and cabbage and fried to a perfect golden brown. Another favorite of mine is the garlic pork chop. It is super flavorful and super garlicky. Yum. And the cabbage soup that comes at the beginning of your meal is perfect. Simple, and perfect. \n\nDid I mention this place is ridiculously cheap?

They use lettuce with it here; I have had it other places with cabbage which maybe is a little more of an acquired taste, but still this was very very good. \n\nMy friend and I then shared orders of the Rama Tofu and Green Curry Veggies. The Rama Tofu is a peanut-curry dish that comes on a bed of steamed spinach - almost had a flavor of a Japanese Gomae. We both felt that there was maybe too much sweetness/sugar though. Would like to see it with the sweetness toned way down, because the dish has great potential - I'd even see if I could order it less sweet, and maybe do some hot sauce with it. The flavor and consistency of the fried tofu in it was excellent, as was the spinach, which is why I might see if the sweet level could be modified.\n\nThe green curry we ordered with just veggies and it was full of them all cooked to perfection. I ordered it hot, which was maybe one degree too much for my friend, but I didn't even have to ask for water so I had no issues with it.

The pad thai is good too and I like that you can heat it up afterwards and it's not like eating rubber bands.  I'm just gonna warn you though, at times I've felt the pad see ew was a little bland.  Just sayin.\n\nOh yeah, and if you are ordering pick-up and you call in with your order, it will be helpful for you to know that they don't really answer the phone like a business, so there's a potential for confusion.  They'll be like \"hello?\" so you think you just called someone's house or something.

But the owner was nice enough to offer something else with the same kind of sauce. He told me to order the seafood salad which came with squid, shrimp, scallops, lettuce, and green beans with a swt&sour sauce. It was VERY tasty! but I did not like the greeen beans so i pushed it all to the side. \nThe place was pretty empty when i walked but and the food took a pretty long time to make which is weird since its just a salad. There was only 2 people working (wife and husband i think) since there wasnt too many people there eating. \noverall, its a cool place to eat lunch if you're in the neighborhood but i would not go out of my way to eat here since theres nothing that stands out too much.", "author": "Linda N."}

The little old man who served my friend and I was so kind and gave amazing recommendations. \n\nBecause of him, my friend got the pad see ew and friend ice cream while I got the heavenly \"mansa munsa curry\"... I know I probably slaughtered that one but it is the first one listed under curry! I don't really eat spicy food but I love curry and he told me that MANSA MUNSA was the curry for me! It was so simple yet amazing! Just a little sweet with a tad bit of salty and carrots, potatoes, onions, and chicken speckled throughout the curry sauce. However, the chicken aspect wasn't very good (too fatty for me) so that is why Lanna doesn't get the full 5 stars!! It had only the slightest bit of spice and you get an adequate amount of rice to go along with your curry so you aren't left with a heap of left over rice or loads of excess curry sauce! \n\nYou also get free cabbage soup, which is very light and delicious!!!

It's a lovely couple owned and operated business and, after a trip down to Anaheim, one of the reasons I love living in the city -- for delicious, unique food made by pleasant people.\n\nCame here with a foreign friend that was allergic to dairy as well as a vegetarian. Didn't realize just how many vegetarian options Lanna has to offer. Even though she couldn't drink the house soup (chicken broth!), we got pad see ew and pad thai vegetarian dishes, as well as the coconut soup and a vegetarian curry. All were quite delicious and I got the stuffed chicken wings to satisfy my carnivorous side :).\n\nYou really can't go wrong with Lanna's specialty, stuffed chicken wings. I just need to emphasize just HOW good they are, plus you can have them almost every day of the week paired with a curry or noodle through the daily lunch specials.\n\nAs like most Thai joints, lunches are relatively cheap and dinners are considerably pricier. Lanna is like this, but like GOOD Thai joints, completely worth it. The menu has something for everyone from classic dishes to more unique ones that you WON'T be able to find just anywhere.\n\nService is usually very good unless there's a surge of customers. The food is consistently delicious. And best of all, the restaurant is VERY clean (look at those scorecards!!). Bonus: I love drinking the water out of the wine glasses like I'm a huge deal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-20", "description": "So after moving into my new apartment, I had to see if there were any worthy, nearby restaurants I can walk to. Unfortunately for me, I'm pretty much in between Taraval and Irving and closer to Noriega than ever before. And sure, Noriega has the reputation of being the lesser of the three main restaurant streets in the Sunset/Parkside area (fourth if you count the last two or so streets of Judah, but I'm not,) but now, it's part of my neighborhood and I had to give it a chance.\n\nSo with friends, we started looking for a restaurant on Noriega that WASN'T Wasabi. My friend and I had all ready tried Green Bamboo and we wanted to see what else was there. Fortunately we were in the mood for Thai and Lanna was right there, looking us straight in the face. So we decided to try it out to see what it was all about.\n\nLong story short, I really like the place. For some reason, I think it's better than King of Thai. There's just something about it that I prefer. The food is pretty good. I think I might have had better Thai food elsewhere, but it's rare. The service is great; the man who usually greets everyone is really nice and polite, at least to us. The prices are affordable and you can get a good amount of food without having to dig too deep into your wallet.\n\nThe only problem I have with the place is that the place is a little bit too small. Granted, I think that's what gives it its character because it's a small mom and pop place and it's pretty comfortable in there. That is unless there's a huge, loud group taking up a third or half of the restaurant. Other than that, it's not too bad. Taking that step outside of the place can be a bitch if you're not looking, too, but I've never fallen flat on my face so it's not bad.\n\nPersonally, I think it's one of the better restaurants on Noriega. Granted, I don't have too much experience with Noriega, but I've been to enough restaurants both on the 19th side and closer to Sunset to know it's pretty good. I've been here multiple times after my first visit, and I'll definitely come here again when I feel like Thai.", "author": "Chris S."}

It took close to 50 minutes to get our very simple orders.  The reason that was such a problem is that the meters on Noriega are capped at 1 hour, which necessitated a mid-lunch meter refill.  It looked like there was only one guy serving, so I'm not docking them too much for it, but still that was a long time for a Saturday afternoon when the restaurant wasn't full.\n\nI didn't like the TV with rotating pictures of the dishes.  Frankly, it would have been better to be some random show than just the pictures of dishes.\n\nBiggest problem though is that my veggie pad thai was just boring.  Very little tofu, maybe 5 carrot chunks, maybe 5 pieces of cooked cabbage, and maybe 5 slivers of celery.

However, if you are looking for a quick bite, you should head somewhere else because this place was designed with atmosphere in mind. Remove the photographs of former Kings of Thailand, and you would think you just stepped into some French or Italian cafe. This is the type of place where you are supposed to sit for awhile, and soak it all in.\n\nThe ironic thing is that Lanna is merely a mom and pop shop (not a knock on it by any means), with only two employees - the wife cooking in the back, and the husband serving. However, I think most restaurants in the City should take some notes from this dynamic duo, as they are some of the most efficient I have ever seen!\n\nNow, I am extremely inexperienced with Thai cuisine (this is the only Thai restaurant I've ever been to), but from what I gather, my taste buds seemed to approve. I can't vouch for the authenticity, but in the whole scheme of things, does it really matter? All that I care about is that it tastes good, and that it does.\n\nHowever, with the good, comes the bad, although they are rather minor, nitpicky things:\n\n*It's too dark. I'm the type who likes to see what I'm eating. Also, being the klutz that I am, stabbing my nose with the fork is no fun, indeed.\n\n*The California Lottery Keno screen ruins the whole mood. I can see how the owner would like it though, since it brings in additional income, but I rarely see anyone playing.\n\n*It's a bit pricy. $7.50 for a lunch combo is on the upper end of the spectrum, considering all the cheap Chinese eats for $5 or less right next door.\n\nOverall, if you are in the upper Noriega region, Lanna is a nice place for a relaxing lunch. The clientele here during the lunch hour is mostly older Caucasian ladies, with the occasional Asian (surprisingly so, in this 60+% Chinese neighborhood), but I have never felt uncomfortable.\n\nP.S.

Vegetarian egg rolls were also terrific, crispy and flavorful.  Can't say the same for the prawn curry, which tasted something like pineapple soup with shrimp, not quite a crime against nature, but a head-scratcher nonetheless.\n\nAn endearing and enduring feature of Lanna, aside from the lovely family that owns the place, is the ongoing Lotto Hot Spot game and ceiling-mounted video monitor for your playing enjoyment.

The older guy was super nice and cheery and made sure we were taken care of throughout the meal.

We were looking for a new Thai restaurant to try in the Sunset and decided to give it a go. Service was pretty good. Our server (owner/husband) was very nice and hospitable. However, at times, it was a little slow waiting for him to take our orders and to give us the check. But overall, his service was the highlight of our dining adventure. The two stars are for the service...not the food.\n\nUnfortunately, I did not like the food. We started off with a salad that consisted of bean thread noodles, dried shrimps, black fungus, lemon juice, lettuce, fish sauce, and some other things. It was good, but was a little too tangy. Also, in comparison to some other restaurants it was not as good as I thought it would be. For our entreees, we shared the Peanut Sauce Chicken atop a bed of spinach and a Seafood dish with Bamboo Shoots, Bell Peppers, and Basil in a medium spicy sauce.\n\nThe Chicken dish was too sweet and I like sweet things, so for me to say that, it was pretty darn sweet. Also, the seafood dish was sweeter than I thought it should be. It actually needed more salt. Also, I did not like the seafood in the dish...the mussels were not fresh, the calamari looked a little odd...etc. The Thai beer was pretty good and the rice was hot and plentiful.\n\nBasically, I didn't like the taste of the food. I've eaten at other restaurants and based on my preferences I like them better. It looks like a lot of people like this restaurant, so I would advise you to check it out and make your own judgement.\n\nAs for me, I thought the price was not consistent with the food. I thought the $30+ bill was a little steep considering I didn't like what I ate. For me, I personally prefer Osha, Marnee Thai, Thai Cafe, and some other restaurants. I recommend you try those places as well.", "author": "MishEddie G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-02-01", "description": "My boyfriend and I went on Yelp last night looking for a new Thai restaurant because we were getting tired of Marnee Thai (which is our usual favorite Thai in the city).  Yelp had Lanna Thai rated at four stars and the reviews were overall very positive, so we thought \"why not?\".\nBIG FREAKIN MISTAKE!!!!\n\nThe first bad sign was the fact that the place was practically empty (one table of two leaving as we walked in), but we were both so hungry and we wanted to help support a wife/husband/brother/whatever family restaurant.  \n\nThe gentleman was polite and sat us near the window.  The food on the menu looked amazing and so reasonable (about $7-10 an entree) so we ordered the vegetarian red curry, seafood combo, Tomh Kah (medium size) and drinks for the both of us.  At this point we were very excited about the food, but still wondering why the place was empty.\n\nThe place was empty on a Saturday night because the food is PURE FILTHY GARBAGE!!!! As we sat there waiting patiently for our food, we could hear the beeping  and the opening of the microwave in the kitchen, which looked pretty filthy as well through the little hole in the wall where the food comes out of. \nWe got the soup, which consisted of congealed globs of coconut in a mustard colored soup base with onions and mushrooms and other random pieces of obviously recycled vegetables.  However, the combo of spicy sour tamarind and lemongrass with the smooth creaminess of coconut can never go wrong, so that dish was palatable.  However, the microwaving sounds made the experience eating this soup difficult.   \nThe next course that came was the panang red curry - which looked like wilted precooked and then microwaved crap vegetables in a maroon slim that WAS NOT FREAKIN PANANG.  I gavve my boyfriend a disgusted look but preceded to try it because I was not going to throw it away or send back food at a restaurant where I was the only one present.  It tasted worst than it looked!  The jelly like texture of the \"sauce\" and the melt-in-your-mouth texture of the \"vegetables\" made the dish more of baby food for babies in third world countries (I was born in Vietnam so I know what I am talking about!) more than Vegetarian Red Curry Panang.  What the hell is wrong with this place??!!!.  \nThe next dish - Seafood Combo - looked better and tasted a bit better (less slim, more spice and a good amount of seafood - mussels, shrimp, and calamari) but obviously not better because I got up in the middle of the night to barf coloful pieces of green mussels and pink shrimp out!  I should have known not to eat any of their food because my tongue tiggled the whole time (like when you eat too much sugar), which only happens to me when food is ladden with MSG.\nAfter all the crap we had to endure eating at this joint from hell (more like something you would find at a shady rest stop in middle america) we had to pay for it.  The nice suprise came when we discovered that the shady bastard who runs this place (who had been very pleasant to us throughout the meal - though he never asked us how our food was because he already knew the answer) charged us $6 for the rice.  To be honest, the rice was actually edible and was probably the most delicious part of our dinner.  However, why the hell would you charge $6 for rice for two???? I politely, being a timid sweet Asian girl I am, if there was a mistake with the pricing of the rice.  To this, the waiter gave us a shady grin and said he charged us for two large rice ($3/each person).  Uhhh...are you kidding me??? What restaurant (besides Yuzu in the Marina - which charge about $3 for their delicious shitake rice), especially this shitty establishment, would dare charge $3 for two scoops of rice per person.  Because of this manipulative move, each of our entrees were now $10-13 each, making it not in the one $ category.  \nBeing so stupid, I sadly accepted this answer and walked meekly back to my table.  We decided to give the guy a 10% tip, which we would never dare do anywhere else because my boyfriend and I have both worked in numerous restaurants (email me and I will give you the behind the scene descriptions of Liliana's, Castle Hill Inn and Resort, CJ's, and the Barking Crab, all in Rhode Island) and understand the importance of a tip.  \nAs we were writing the tip, but owner creeped behind us in the shadows and pounced on the chech the moment we left the table - an obviously bold and rude move.  We walked out of the restaurant and wanted to scream and throw up all the gross, dumpster - dived finds we just ate and paid for.  All we could say to one another is \"WHY????\" Why would you have a restaurant where you microwave old crap and present it to customers and then charge them for it? Why would you make disgusting food? Aren't you embarassed or ashamed?? I don't get it and I guess I will never get an answer. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here.

But the soup was pretty good. Very Fresh aftertaste. haha or maybe i was just thirsty\n\n- 3 people = around $30.  3 dishes, 2 drinks, and a dessert.\n\n-overall, this place is great, food is okay~ normal. not very great, but not very poor...it's right in the middle. Feels like I'm eating a home dinner or the sort.  if you like Thai food. this is the place. =)", "author": "Karin L."}

At first, I thought the curry and the coconut juice would be over-powering, but it was absolutely not. Not to mention, our meals came with a complimentary soup. The owner was very nice. Their prices are pretty cheap especially during their lunch specials. My friend ordered their \"Special of the Day\" and it came with a small portion of Pad Thai, rice, and a peanut-tasting curry. I had a try and it was delicious!", "author": "Dianne I."}
