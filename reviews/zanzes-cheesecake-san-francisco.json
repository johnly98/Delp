They were still good from sitting in the fridge overnight but melted just a tad bit.

Well, I've finally found a place where I can have a whole slice and finish it, all in one sitting! If you're like me and don't like cheesecake (or cheese), I highly recommend this place because it's one of a kind :)\n\nMy cousin bought a large traditional cheesecake for a family gathering and I was hooked ever since. Similar to what others have said, it really is fluffy, light, and creamy. On my sister's graduation day, my boyfriend went and brought one up to Sacramento for us. He told us that the kind lady advised him on how to cut it (using the fishing wire) and she also wrapped it with plastic wrap. I called ahead to order for a next day pick up and the lady who picked up said they are able to do that. When he arrived, he was able to purchase another small traditional cheesecake for his sister's birthday, so he walked out with two cheesecakes! \n\nI purchased another one on a Saturday and I called Friday afternoon to see if they are able to do so and the lady said they are. I'm not sure if we're just lucky or what, but the past two times we're been, we were always able to pick up another cake or pay for a size bigger! Anywho, this place has the best cheesecake and the graham crackers on top are the best! Sometimes, I even eat that part from my boyfriend's slice ;)\n\nJust a few things to keep in mind:\n**Always call ahead to order\n**CASH ONLY\n**Traditional cheesecake prices: $16/S, $25/M, $32/L\n*There's meter and street parking available", "author": "Vicky L."}

My family and I come to Zanze's on special occasions to pick up 2-3 cheesecakes since everyone loves this dessert and always wants seconds. I suggest calling in an order before picking one up so you are guaranteed a cheesecake. If not, then you wait in line and hope that they don't run out. They close their store once they've sold out for the day. On Thanksgiving and Christmas, you have to call in an order at least 2 weeks in advance because they sell out fast during these holidays.

He stated have our original first, after you have our original you can sample what else we can make.\n\nI requested for a small original cheesecake and when on the phone with the man it seemed like they were already out, I called at 11am on the dot, so it seems this places cheesecakes are a hot commodity, he checked and double checked and said I have a few left so we will put you down for one.\n\nBefore coming here I had a few folks that have tried their share of cheesecakes in several places, allot of the feed back was 50/50 some really liked it others were just like ehhh it's like a frozen cheesecake but better???? They all agreed in regards to the preparation and how the cake is cut is different.\n\nSo let me describe the taste as opposed to your store bought frozen variety. So if you have ever had the store bought Lucky's or Safeway, you get that thick heavy taste of semi thick cheese and super chewy cake taste that is semi sweet. Or if you go to cheesecake factory it is slightly better where you don't get the semi hard crust of older cheesecake that has been sitting in a freezer for several weeks, again softer but taste wise same, semi sweet but thick is taste when biting down.  Zanze's verision is very different, airy, light, delicious, sweet but not too sweet, if your using a string to cut a cheesecake that is impressive on its own.\n\nI do recommend a sample of this cheesecake shop, it is very different from most spots, fresh made daily, place an order thru the phone and pick up is a recommendation, if you just show up, they may not have any in stock, oh also cash only folks and these cakes are pricey but tasting it is well justified, I will be back for another type of cheesecake next time\n\ncheesecake ***** wow\nprice $$$\nservice ***** they tell you how to cut this cheesecake, mind blown hahaha\nambiance *** small shop, small front area, two people that I saw run the show two elderly folks, both are very nice and take pride in their product", "author": "Clarence A."}

What makes it difficult to get Zanze's cheesecake is a combination of the limited opening hours (Closed: Sun - Tues) and limited cheesecake supply. \n\nI tried a number of times on Saturdays but had no luck.. once because it was graduation weekend so they only took pre-orders, another instance I called beforehand and the lady said they had 4 small cheesecakes left but by the time I arrived 15min later, there was a \"Sold Out\" sign posted on the door. This was at noon on a Saturday.. just 2hrs after they opened! I guess they close shop early even though their Saturday hours are 10am - 4pm.\n\nAfter the 4th try, it was finally success! I called on a Wednesday right when they opened and asked that they hold one of the cheesecakes for me. The lady took down my name and reminded me it was cash only. I parked in one of the meters, ran into the store, and was elated that there was a beautiful cheesecake waiting for me. She quickly went over the details of how to properly slice the cheesecake using the fishing wire (1. hold the fishing wire taut with each end looped around your index finger and slice the cheesecake with one swift downward motion; 2. Release one end of the fishing wire and use the other end to pull the fishing wire through). Apparently it is such a delicate cheesecake that knife will ruin it.\n\nThe cheesecake itself is very light, fluffy, and delicate. While it is a good cheesecake, I prefer the more denser versions of cheesecake.\n\nA few tips if you're trying to get your hands on one of Zanze's cheesecakes:\n- Opt for weekday if possible (Wed - Fri 11am - 6pm or when they run out)\n- If on a Saturday, either call ahead during the week to pre-order or call early and ask that they hold one of the cheesecakes for you (only works if you are planning on getting there right away)\n- Meter parking is not too difficult to find\n- Cash only", "author": "Ruby C."}

Hadn't had Zanze's in years....YES it is super light and fluffy however as a few others stated,  if you prefer the classic dense New York style cheesecake,  you may be disappointed as this is not that kind.  At first few bites, it seemed all nice fluffy and very lightly sweet... then as it gets more room temp, the texture just feels like a mass of whipped cream.  From reading the rave reviews,  if you like almost a whipped creamy dessert that only holds structure being very cold/refrigerated,  you may love this type.... however if you prefer the classic dense cheesecake, as mentioned- you may be disappointed. Zanze's is good but it is a specific kind of cheesecake that may not be for everyone. It had been years since I had it and now I remember why there may not have been a drive to go back. Just needed a reminder I guess.", "author": "Lucky P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-22", "description": "I've been fortunate enough to call Zanze's my neighborhood cheesecake shop ever since I was a kid. I would walk by the glass shop windows, stacked with white boxes, on my way home from school everyday. Special occasions would often warrant one of these treats, where I would find one nestled in the fridge just waiting to be opened for dessert. When I got older, I soon came to realize that I had been spoiled with such a lovely bakery nearby that was not just my neighborhood cheesecake shop, but the best cheesecake shop in the city!\n\nThe cheesecakes are light and fluffy, but still silky and creamy. They're reminiscent of Japanese cotton cheesecakes, but are moister in texture. Only the original cheesecakes come with a graham crumb topping. The other cheesecakes are topped with fruit compote/whipped cream, or chocolate shavings, and do not have crusts. The only downside to one of these treats is you'll literally want to eat half the cheesecake. I can never resist seconds!\n\nCall ahead of time if you need the cheesecake for a special occasion as they often sell out by the end of the day (especially on Fridays and Saturdays). Also, make sure you follow their advice to cut the cake with the provided fishing line or your cheesecake will run the risk of collapsing in some areas! \n\nThese cheesecakes are nothing like The Cheesecake Factory, so if you're looking for a creamy, dense, and sweet cheesecake, this is not it. Zanze's is old-school. They let the cheesecake shine without any frills. They just add some amazing texture, but in the end, their cheesecakes are simple. And sometimes, simple is perfect.", "author": "Deanna Y."}

Where did you get it? I'm going to buy one myself!\n\nZanze's has the best cheesecake ever. I rarely ever speak in hyperbole. I also rarely ever like cheesecake. I'm all too familiar with the New York style cheesecakes that are too dense and heavy for my liking, but I've smiled and tolerated it every time somebody served one of those blocks of cream cheese pies with the texture of cold butter. \n\nMr. Zanze, the sweet, kind, lovable baker, has been making these amazing cheesecakes since the 1970s. He takes after his father, who was also a baker and experimented with the cheesecake recipe to get it just right. Since then, Zanze surely has perfected this European-style cheesecake. \n\nOnce I tasted it, I did a quick internet search to see what other cheesecake styles out there exist. Turns out there are way more than I can consume in a lifetime. I'll just stick to what I know and love... \n\nThis cheesecake is so light, delicate, mousse-y, and souffle-like. Topped with graham cracker crumbs and powdered sugar, it is perfect. I've never tried different toppings, because the plain one is just too delicious. I could eat an entire cheesecake by myself.\nIf anyone needs an example of 'light as air,' this cheesecake is it. \n\nEach box comes with a little bit of rolled up fishing line for slicing purposes. That shows just how light it is. They do patiently explain to you how to cut your cake...\n1. Pull fishing line taut.\n2. Place fishing line over cake, pressing down to the table.\n3. Pull fishing line across table and out of the cake. Do not lift fishing line up and out.\n\nApparently you can freeze these cheesecakes for up to three months too.\n\nAnother plus? They're affordable!\nSmall: $16\nMedium: $24\nLarge: $32\nAt these prices, it's a great option to bring to family dinners or get-togethers while still spending less than most cakes.\n\nI ordinarily am annoyed with cash-only establishments, but I don't mind it when it comes to Zanze's Cheesecake. \nGetting a cheesecake does require some planning, because they're only open Wed - Sat and close pretty early. Sometimes they run out, but you can order in advance.\n\nI've heard that Mr. Zanze does not want to retire because he's devoted to his craft and loves connecting with his customers through his cheesecake. I don't know what I would do if he ever did retire.", "author": "Joy W."}

This probably shouldn't be mentioned but the last time I had a stomach flu, cheesecake was the last thing I ate and so my memory of cheesecakes were forever scarred from that moment on.\n\nHowever, that did not stop my dad from buying cheesecakes from Zanze's now and then. It wasn't to torture me by any means, my dad simply has a love for their cheesecakes and who am I to deny him that simple pleasure of life?\n\nMy dad brought home a regular cheesecake for us before. He got the smallest size they had because my family doesn't eat much and one hour into having it in our home, I mustered up the courage to take a bite. After all, if this cheesecake came with a wire to cut it then I have to give it a go.\n\nIt was bomb. Zanze's cheesecake was light and fluffy and it was just delightful. Gone was that horrible memory of the stomach flu and in came the memory of this airy cheesecake. I know this is weird, but honestly Zanze made me love cheesecake a bit which I would've probably never said if you asked me this a year ago. \n\nOverall, I would probably send my dad back to get a cheesecake for me.

I read about Zanze's on a food blog and I was intrigued because they make a cheesecake that's similar to Japanese cheesecake. \n\nZanze's specializes in ONLY cheesecake. Small, medium, or large. $16, $24, or $32. That's it, that's all they offer. You can have fruit on top but you have to call and place an order ahead of time. No slices, you buy it by the whole. These beauties come with fishing line to cut the cake. \n\nThe cake is absolutely decadent! So airy and fragile. Like a little cloud. Not overly sweet, which is my main complaint about cheesecake. I was lucky to snag two small cheesecakes. One for me and one for my gf, and she and her fam also vouched that this was the best cheesecake they've ever eaten. \n\nZanze's is only open from Wednesday to Saturday.

Yes, I just said that.  \n\nIf you have had it before then you know what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm sure previous reviews mentioned this, but understand this place only makes and sells cheesecake, nothing else.  This is a family run place that's been here for at least a couple of generations.  Everything is made fresh by hand and on the premise.  This isn't Cheesecake Factory, so they only offer a few flavors here, regular and chocolate, the chocolate is just chocolate shavings on top of the regular.  If your lucky (and early enough) you'll be able to snag one of the berry ones but those go quick.  Thanksgiving time they offer pumpkin flavor which is really good too. But that's about it in terms of their selections.  \n\nNow to the cheesecake.  Zanze's cheesecake isn't your dense, mealy and dry cheesecake that taste like Sheetrock.  It's the softest and the creamiest and fluffiest cheesecake you will ever eat in your life.  The sweetness level is just perfect and it literally melts in your mouth in the most delicious way.  Let me put it this way, if you get one of their cakes, you won't be stopping after the first slice.  \n\nTheir cheesecake is so delicate that they provide you with a fishing line to cut the cake, knives would NOT do this cake justice.  There's no crust, instead just a thin layer of a light topping that gives the cake a different yummy texture.  \n\nFor those going there for the first time, parking sucks there.  Also be prepared to be disappointed if you end up getting there late.  They only make a certain amount of cakes a day, once it's sold out, you're S.O.L.  The cakes are also not cheap  but you're paying for top quality so it's worth every penny.  \n\nEnjoy it.", "author": "Kitai P."}

On our trip after the zoo we decided Zanze's would be the perfect dessert to our day of fun. \n\nThere's plenty of metered street parking in front of and around Zanze's. We were greeted by a woman who I'm assuming is part of the ownership due to her lovely nature. She said that they only had original and chocolate available in medium or large. Seeing as we had never been here before, we went with original. Toppings can often time mask tastes and original should be delicious. We were told how to cut the cheesecake and it didn't steer us wrong at all. We sliced 12 slices with perfect thanks to the helpful explanation. They have a \"window\" they pass the cheesecake through  and I'm assuming this gentleman might be the woman's husband who has been helping us. He popped his head through the window, asked if it was our first time and gave us his good gestures to enjoy the cheesecake. \n\nWe made the trek back to San Jose with this \"golden\" cheesecake. We popped it in the fridge for a few hours before slicing. This cheesecake is amazing. Being a person who likes to cook and bake its usually difficult to impress me.

The cheesecake is delicious and light. I stopped by the store early one Saturday to pick it up. I recommend ordering in advance if you want one of their flavored cheesecakes which look amazing. The original flavor did not disappoint none the less. The large size was great for a party and would easily serve 16 portions. The store front is pretty small but you can see the kitchen through a window when you pick up your cheesecake. It's nice to see the bakers in action. The lady at the register carefully explained how to service the dessert which I really appreciated. I highly recommend this business. It's a hidden gem!", "author": "Denise M."}

No Smalls however...but hey, I'll take a Medium (more of the good stuff for us!!) I go there to pick it up. The lady at the counter (I'm sure she's the owner) is super sweet and gets my cheesecake. She asks if this is for a special occasion and I tell her it's for my mom's birthday. She offers to put a \"Happy Birthday\" chocolate on top and packs it up. So thoughtful. And then I left....and had amazing, fluffy cheesecake later that night. \n\nCustomer service was great. Taste, of course, is great as always. Of course, I wish there was more crust but you just can't find this nice fluffiness anywhere else. I've really grown to love (and seriously crave) it. Try it out for yourself!

I ask her if there is a small raspberry available (as I have heard raspberry is by far the tastiest). For the past five-six phone attempts she has notified me that there are no raspberry cheesecakes available. But that I could order one ahead of time. I thank her for the info to order ahead but normally when I have these functions they are last minute. I'm simply looking for a quick treat to pick up. \n\nWell, it's that time again. A few girls are coming over tonight and I want to pick up a special dessert. I call right when they open and ask if they have a small raspberry cheesecake (as it would seem unreasonable they would sell out minutes upon opening). I'm told by the woman over the phone they do not have any raspberry cheesecakes. I'm told I would need to order one. I say no thank you, I will try again another time. Then she explains that I can order one for today. I think to myself: Great! This is a dream come true! I'm finally getting a small raspberry cheesecake after all!\n\nShe asks me when I want it. I say the sooner the better. She tells me that the cheesecake will be ready in 30 minutes. I leave the gym, I pick up my dog and drive over to get the cheesecake. \n\nPart 2: I arrive 45-50 minutes after placing the order. The woman in the front doesn't greet me. She just stares at me. I say \"hey, how you doing, I placed an order\" and she immediately interrupts me and says the cheesecake isn't ready. Then she proceeds to lecture me on all the steps it takes to make the cheesecake... I explain to her that my dog is in the car and I'm parked a few blocks away. I tell her I'm going to check on my dog and come back in 10 minutes. I do that. Upon returning the first words out of her mouth: \"I guess the dog survived\" in the rudest, nastiest tone. I said nothing, paid for the cheesecake and left. \n\nSurvey says: out of the four of us, two really enjoyed the cheesecake and two of us didn't. Why is there no crust?? All four of us thought this entire debacle was weird. \n\nNOTE TO OWNERS: Good service is everything!\n\nYou only accept cash. \nYour hours of operation are extremely limited. \nYou make it nearly impossible to pick up a raspberry cheesecake. \nYour front of house woman is overly rude. \n\nI know you're popular and probably won't care that I had a poor experience.

Cheesecakes are readily available in a first come first serve basis, but they're only about 8-10 a day.. so pre-ordering them a day or two ahead of time is necessary. The lovely lady was very nice and helpful by showing me  how to use the fishing wire to slice the cakes.. Since it's soo delicate, she also let me know when to thaw it, how to freeze it, etc... Prices are very reasonable considering how popular the cakes are.. Anddd.. they now offer seasonal flavors, such as pumpkin cheesecake during the Holiday seasons.. traditional and blueberry are yearly.. I have pumpkin cheesecake on my list for what to try next.. The cheesecake is light, airy, and fluffy.. The cheesecake is strong with the cream cheese, but light because of the graham crackers used. You can literally eat 1 small cheesecake yourself if you're having a bad day.. it's not the best decision... but it's definitely \"possible\".. if you dare..... it's THAT airy and light.. \n\nTo add another good note- when I went to pick up the cake, there were two pre-teens helping out at the bakery.. Though they didn't help with service, they were busily measuring out the fishing wire that will be attached to the cake box.. I do not see that as much anymore and really admire how family oriented the shop is. Please keep it up :)", "author": "Samantha W."}

I was just walking around,  waiting for my husband's dentist appt. next door to be finished .  \n\nI walked in this little joint only to see cheesecakes and thought,  wow only cheesecakes,  they must be delicious since it's their specialty... (especially for $16 per small serving,  6 slices). \n\nI gave it a shot and boy was I impressed at first taste. I didn't have to think,  Is this a good cheesecake? I instantly said, Wow Mamma!!! The taste is just outstanding and texture is perfect,  not to mention that it looked heavenly. The only thing i would add is a bit of  more crust,  but that's the way i like my cheesecake.  Their crust is a light crumb,  but delicious.  It's sprinkled mainly on top and a little on the bottom. \n\n\nI didn't enjoy it as much at room temp as I did Refrigerated. There's a big difference.  At room temp,  it's more fluffy and not as pronounced in flavor.  Refrigerated,  it's all fluffy,  but a bit more dense with much stronger flavor.  It's all a matter of preference.  \n\nIt comes nicely packaged in a box lined with doilies and box tied with rope,  a perfect gift. \n\nThey even include a piece of plastic string used for slicing the delicate cheesecake. Yes,  they mean business.  \n\nThey have other flavors available.  Strawberry,  etc.  And i have no doubt that they're nothing short of perfect.

Zanze's easily took the (cheese)cake.  \n\nI called in at 11am to put a small blueberry cheesecake on hold for Wifey's birthday dinner.  The lady on the phone was extremely friendly and helpful.  She let me know that they closed at 4pm and I could come at anytime.  \n\nI thought a small would be enough for 6 people.  When I walked into the shop, the lady from the phone greeted me with the same friendliness.  The man behind all of the cheesecakes also made an effort to peak out and say hello.  What awesomeness! I looked in the case and saw that a small just wouldn't be enough for 6.  She asked me if I wanted a bigger size without any hesitation.  They piled on the whipped cream and blueberries to order and sent me on my way with a marzipan happy birthday sign. \n\nShe warned me not to put it on too early or else it'll get lost within the blueberries.  Cash only folks!  She also took the time to explain how to use the fishing line.  Zanze's closes Sundays through Tuesdays.  What an awesome find...\n\nThe cheesecake, itself, was light, fluffy, and delish.  It wasn't overpowering and the blueberries were a great complement.  I could probably eat the entire cake if it was served to me on a platter.  Well, let's hope I NEVER do that.  \n\n5 super duper stars for my 600th review and reviewing this place proudly!

They also make a pumpkin top for the holiday, but not knowing if my friends were already making pumpkin & other pies, decided to go with the original flavor. It's a treat for any occasion and they are only open Wednesdays-Saturdays, so place your order in advance when you need it! They keep in fridge very well and can be frozen IF you have to.

It feels good to support a neighborhood establishment. The service is friendly, and the fact that they include the fishing line on the outside of the box (for a smooth cut) is a nice touch.\n\nAs far as taste, the fresh fruit topping was great. I loved the tartness of the raspberries. And like everyone has said, the cake has a very light, fluffy texture--creamy and almost mousse-like.

It is so light and fluffy, you hardly have to chew. It is neither too sweet nor too cheesy, just an airy delightfulness. Eating Zanze's cheesecake is what I'd imagine eating a cloud feels like. I've given this cake to multiple people who say they don't like cheesecake and they ask for seconds. The crust is light crumbs on the top rather than a hard layer on the bottom. I've ordered the small and it lasted me several days of delightful sweetness, between myself, the husband and one guest. \n\nSecond, the service. The attentive and caring service of this establishment is what makes this a five star review. Two months ago, I drove 25 minutes each way to pick up a cake for the husband's birthday. He'd had a couple bites of a Zanze cake when we were over at a friend's place and promptly announced that we must have this cake for every special occasion. When I arrived, a polite older lady took my order and carefully boxed and wrapped the cake. She asked if there was a special occasion and added a happy birthday sign made out of chocolate to put on top. Only when she rang me up did I realize that they only accept cash. I was so embarrassed and told her that I didn't enough cash. I rummaged through my purse and pulled out enough for a small cake, not the medium caked that was already boxed. She paused, looked straight at me and said, \"It's alright, why don't you pay me tomorrow?\" I told her that I had gone quite out of the way to get here and wouldn't be able to come back. I apologized profusely and asked if I could have a small cake instead. She said, \"You know what? Just take it. Tell your husband to have a happy birthday.\" This concession only cost her $5 but earned her a customer for life. I was so blown away by her kindness, I wanted to reach across the counter and hug her. \n\nLast week was my birthday and I knew that if I had a cake, it would be a Zanze's cheesecake. I came in, cash in hand, and ordered my cake. The same older woman boxed and tied the cake with care. They don't have an electronic register, she wrote down my order in a notebook and entered the amount into a calculator. She took her time to ask how my weekend was going. When I gave her extra money and told her that I owed her for the previous cake, she smiled and said thanks and have a nice day.\n\nThis place is old school and I love all the effort that goes into a delicious product and superb service!", "author": "Emmi D."}

Cheesecakes are usually creamy and dense, which is delicious, especially with a hot cup of tea or coffee. But Zanze's cheesecakes are light and fluffy, which makes them amazing. When you take a bite, it is like eating cheesecake clouds. You cut the slices with floss, and it actually works amazingly well. Cutting with a knife would probably ruin the whole cake because it is very delicate. So just use the floss taped on the corner of the box.\n\nOn the other hand, I noticed they are going on vacation until August 2012 (2 months). I would strongly recommend calling-in to check if they are open and maybe pre-ordering before jumping into the car and heading over to the store.

Luckily I found a convenient Saturday and we bought two large cheesecakes for good measure.  Each large one provides 12-14 servings depending on how big you cut the slices.

These are not the kind of cheesecakes where it's just so rich that the last few bites are just painfully hard to get down.  Zanze's cheesecakes don't even seem like what you envision a typical cheescake tasting like.  Can you believe that you're recommended to cut the cheesecake with a provided fishing line?  If you cut it otherwise with a knife or metal utensil, you risk having the cheesecake clump up as you cut slices and it just won't look nice when served.\n\nYou know you have a successful cheesecake business when:\n\n- You see Sam Zanze working in the background even though he's been so successful in this business; just shows he's passionate about what he's doing (or doesn't want to give away the secrets to making his awesome desserts!)\n- You only have cheesecake on the menu and the other varieties of cheesecakes are simply ones that add blueberries or raspberries on top.  So simple!\n- You make a cheesecake with no crust and people are still flocking to buy it like people were after those Tickle Me Elmos back in the day (ok, not as dramatic, but you get the idea)\n- You can shut down the shop for multiple months during summer and come back to start the cheesecake frenzy again\n- You have a small shop, with no seating, just large enough to distribute cheesecakes to the customers\n\nToo bad it's located all the way down Ocean Ave near SF State or else I'd probably be here a whole lot more often\n\nNote: I haven't ordered around the holidays but Sam indicated that it's best to place a Thanksgiving/X-mas cheesecake order at least 2.5-3 weeks in advance just to be sure you'll get one", "author": "Albie F."}

The whipped cream + blueberries + the jam were nice additions as well, and highlighted the cheesecake well (because, ya know, there are some cakes out there where the whipped cream and/or toppings are so overpowering that you could barely taste the actual cake). \n\nAs some negative reviews have pointed out,  yes, it is fluffy and airy and yes, the texture is similar to mousse. I don't mind as much because refrigerating it will firm it up a little bit.

A friend brought some home to try and I just have to say WOW. It's definitely different than most cheesecake. It is super fluffy and soft, almost not like a cheesecake. The crust wasn't super hard like other cheesecake which makes the two aspects (crust and cheesecake) blend very well! The cheesecake is so soft and fluffy that Zanze's gives you a fishing line to cut the cake. If you cut it with a knife it just destroys the cake.", "author": "Ryan E."}

They're located right across from the K stop, so it's convenient to come via public transportation but if driving, you have to find a spot. If you're lucky, the meters in front will be vacant. I've seen jerks park in the no parking area in front of the meters. Please don't do that! I know you're trying to avoid having to pay the meter, but there's a reason it's no parking!

When I got there I found out their plain cheesecakes are available throughout the day but the ones with toppings are gone by morning.

This pair comes in after me and apparently the lady bringing out the cakes know them because they're regulars. Guess who got their cakes first. AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN RESERVE ONE! When the lady at the register told her I had booked a cake, she just pointed at the cake she just brought out and said, \"This is for them.\" She then said she'd go back to grab me a cake.

So even though I was annoyed that I was first and I had someone outside waiting in the car for me, I just let it slide.)

So I went ahead and purchased the medium classic cake with all the cash I had on me (yes, cash only and I was so glad that I had cash...) and rushed back to try it with my friends.\n\nWe ate the cheesecake while we watched Season 7 of Friends (The One with the Cheesecakes). If you've never seen that episode, I suggest that you watch it while eating Zanze's cheesecake. My friends' reaction upon trying the first bite was the same reaction as Rachel's and Chandler's in that episode. The cheesecake was rich in flavor but fluffy and airy in its texture.

Although I am a fan of the former, because of the main reason that I've had cheesecake exactly like this from Japan a few times in the past, Zanze's wasn't really anything particularly new or different for me.  However, if you've never tried a cheesecake of this consistency before, you should try it and you may be surprised at just how soft and fluffy it is, compared to the more traditional ones.  I had removed a star because it lacked a crust on the bottom and instead had crumbs on the top.\n\nThe place is really tiny, maybe only around 6-8 people max can fit in there at one time.  Unless you live around here, the location appears a bit inconvenient and out of the ways.  If you're not driving here, then taking the \"K\" line is likely your best choice.  Also, I have to agree that their cheesecakes are slightly expensive - a traditional small which could serve about 2-3 people costs $14 and the medium that I got that could serve 4-5 was $21 (you will not be able to buy a slice, you need to purchase the entire cake); so another reason I had to remove a star.  I have nothing against this place and I will say that it's pretty good and I'm glad I tried it, but personally, I did not think it was really anything that was so out of this world unbelievably delicious, worth justifying going back again and again for.

I felt like this cake was seriously for me and not him since i LOVE cheesecake. When I first came to this place to order it, I can immediately taste the cheesecake in the air like seriously. It smelled so good. I got the medium traditional cheesecake. I asked the worker if they had one with strawberries but unfortunately he said the closest they can do are cherries. They really need to have one with strawberries because that's my favorite! \n\nAnyways, I picked it up and he even explained to me about the fish wire that was attached to the box. My boyfriend ended up liking the cheesecake which I was really happy about. The guests at the party really liked it too. I was so happy that it was a hit. My friends kept asking me if I had more haha. Next time for sure I'm going to get the large size. I love how it's so light and fluffy.

So, after seeing the rerun, I jumped online to find good cheesecake shops in the city.  The first one to pop up was Zanze's.  So I rushed over there one afternoon to find that it was closed for some reason or other.  Undeterred, I wrote down the date that they would reopen and would come back later.\n\nA few weeks later I came back when I had the free time and ordered a medium original (before you wonder if it was just for me, it wasn't, I mean I probably could've polished it off by myself, but I didn't).  Mr. Zanze asked if I'd ordered one before (I was about to pull the \"Does this look like it's the first time I've ordered a cheesecake!\" line, but I don't think he would've gotten my joke and it was too early to ruin a perfectly nice guys day with a bad joke), I told him no, so he explained how to cut the cheesecake with the fishing line.\n\nAs everyone else has written, this isn't your typical cheesecake, it's super fluffy and the graham cracker crust is on the top instead of the bottom.  It's also not overly sweet, but it still pairs well with whipped cream or a fruit coulis (You like that fancy food lingo, ladies? This is probably why I'm still single...).", "author": "Joe N."}

I really loved how the chocolate didn't over power the cheese and vice versa. Most chocolate cheesecakes I've encountered are way too chocolaty, rich and dense. Not Zanze's - it maintained Zanze's cheesecake's characteristic (light and fluffy) while bringing in a moderate hint of milk chocolate taste. It was simply perfect. I might like it more than the original....!!!! \n\nMy sister and I pretty much killed the cake in 5 minutes (darn them for being so easy to eat!)

I was the last customer and the lady who took care of the front (the owner's wife?) was so delightful, even after such a hectic day! \n\nBut the real treat is the cheesecakes itself.. it's so fluffy and light! I feel like I can eat the entire cake by myself! The menu consists of three sizes and we ordered the largest one but still we didn't have enough to feed 7 people... that's because we all wanted seconds!\n\nI used to be a one cake kind of girl-- always opting for a princess cake. I think this year for my birthday, I will trade in my princess cake for another Zanze cheesecake!", "author": "Tiffany U."}

I was desperate, \"What is so fabulous about this place?!\"  \n\nThe first time I ventured out to Zanze's, I woke up early just to take the bus out here.  Imagine my horror when the only option was a whole cheesecake and to go!  I knew I had to say no to that.  At this point, I only wanted just a taste, a slice of what all the hype was about.  I couldn't very well buy a whole one yet!  \n\nThe next time around, the BF and I made plans.  He called ahead for a  large cheesecake to feed my whole family.  They claim it can feed 14-16 servings from one of their big ones.  And so, that's what we did.  \n\nAs we used their complimentary fishing line to slice up this delicate cheesecake, I expected bliss.  Bliss is not what I got.  It was light, indeed very light.  Too light for cheesecake in my opinion.  I'd call it a mousse rather instead of a cheesecake.  I wanted something heavier, something orgasmic-worthy, and I wasn't getting it.  The woman who sold us the cheesecake said it would be \"The Best...guaranteed!\"  Well, sorry to say lady - \"This cheesecake is not the best, at least for me.\"  (Now, if you ask the BF, he'll tell you otherwise.  He had about three to four servings all to himself.)\n\nSo, I was disappointed.  Zanze's Cheesecake is okay, but nothing for me to rave about.  You won't see me getting out of bed early again for one of these things.", "author": "Teri C."}

I bought one of their large original recipe cheesecakes due to the adamant recommendation from one of the employee at the front counter, and I asked him to put chocolate shavings on the top. He told me it'd be a few minutes but the cake was ready in no time at all, and he even brought it outside to me because the store front is really small so I went outside to wait. The packaging was tasteful, as they use strings to secure the folds of the box instead of scotch tape. There was also a short spool of fishing line attached to the top of the box, which I couldn't figure out what it was for at first,  but was later informed it's used to cut the cake. At first bite the cake reminded me of Yoplait's whipped yogurt, but it was thicker with a moose like consistency. If you've ever had in the New York cheesecake you'll know that sometimes it can stick to your mouth, but this cheesecake is very fluffy and light. The sweetness of the cheesecake was just right, however, I do like my desserts on the sweet side. Another thing that I really liked was there chocolate shavings. Most chocolate shavings that I've had are usually tasteless and hard like plastic, but their chocolate shavings actually tasted like chocolate and melted in my mouth.

I wanted a small blueberry cheesecake ($13). I didn't pre-order so I was in luck they had one left in the back! The man at the cashier (Mr. Zazne?) was very soft spoken and I had to repeat my order three times to him. He took great care and time to tie up my cheesecake box and to explain what the fish wire was for, though I read all over yelp reviews of its exact purpose.\n\nI tore up my cheesecake box when I finally made it home. My first bite was definitely a big surprise! The blueberry cheesecake had the consistencies of a mousse. It was so light, I ate 1/4 of it before I even had to put my fork down. It felt like I was eating sweet nothings. I don't know if I would call mousse a cheesecake with barely any crust even though it makes a delicious dessert.

The thing I don't like about most cheesecakes is that its usually dense and too much. This is so light and fluffy (as fluffy as cheesecake can get).

The place only accepts cash, which is a bit annoying. Does the cheesecake live up to the hype? Hard to say. It was very good but I don't know if it was the best I've ever had. I tend to prefer Italian style cheesecake, which is why I was so excited to try this place but if you are going because you like Italian style cheesecake I think you might be a little disappointed. It isn't the kind of Italian cheesecake you will find in NJ. Very good, very light, yet somehow still rich and creamy. Very unique take on cheesecake unlike anything I've ever had, but I still prefer traditional east coast Italian cheesecake.", "author": "Jackson B."}

It sounds a little quirky, but that's just another thing that makes Zanze's special.\n\nAnother thing, they do constantly change their store hours so I like to call in to make sure they're open. The owners like to go on vacation during the summer so they're usually closed for a few weeks during that time. Speaking of whom, they're super nice and sweet!

It's kinda far out there, and their hours are not the most friendly, since they close at 6 most nights and at 4, I think, on Saturdays.  On a recent day off, I was driving around the area, and thought \"why not today?\"  \n\nWhen I first walked in, I saw a few different-sized cheesecakes, with a crumb topping, and I got excited.  I was then greeted by a very nice gentleman, who packed up my small cheesecake for me.  He asked me if I knew how to use the fishing line, and when I said \"No,\" he smiled and asked if I was a first-timer.  Pretty obvious, I guess.  \n\nThe cheesecake was a little pricey --$14.00 for the small -- but I knew it was going to be good.  It was tough waiting for my wife to come home to eat it, because I didn't want her to see that I had taken a huge chunk out of it, but when I finally cut into super-soft and fluffy cheesecake, it was worth the wait!  I don't think I've ever had a cheesecake that was that fluffy.  The only thing that threw me off was that there was no bottom crust, and the topping was only \"crust\" on the cake.  I would've liked more crust, but it's hard to complain when the pure, unadulterated taste of cheesecake shined through -- it's not called \"crust-cake\"!  We've been snacking on it over the past few days -- before dinner, after dinner, even at breakfast time -- and we're both sad that there's only a small piece left, but it's probably better for my \"diet\" that we're almost done!\n\nThey also have blueberry (and strawberry, I think) cheesecake, and I look forward to the next random afternoon that I'm in the neighborhood so that i can get another cheesecake!", "author": "Pilan C."}

This is just my own honest personal opinion.  \nI got the blueberry cheesecake.  I heard a lot of good stuff about this place and really wanted to try a good cheesecake.  \nPrice was $23 for medium blueberry cheesecake.  Cash only.  I don't think it was worth that much personally.\nThe flavor is very simple. The texture is too fluffy for a cheesecake. This style of cheesecake borders on mousse/soft like.  There is also barely/no crust for those of you interested.  \nI think the cheesecake would be perfect if it was a little less fluffy and \"in between\" the common/thicker/creamy cheesecake, then it would be delicious.  \nThe cheesecake is not as fattening as the usual cheesecake but I would have to say there's nothing extraordinary about it.  Maybe it is because I had Asian cheesecake and cakes that taste exactly like this before and that might be why I was disappointed.  The blueberry topping is delicious though, flavor of the blueberries are very intact and fresh, glaze not too sweet. \nThe cheesecake is light, fluffy, lacking in what I would define as a real cheesecake texture and flavor.  It just hit the halfway mark, and if it was just a tad bit more dense/creamy and I could taste the cheesecakeness of it, it would be the perfect cheesecake, not too rich and thick like the Cheesecake factory and not too fluffed up would be the bulls-eye.\nI think maybe it's the fact that it is different from the usual cheesecake and lighter in texture and flavor that makes it different from the usual cheesecake.  It's appears to be healthier/less calories.\nI don't regret giving this place a try and I will continue searching for the most delicious cheesecake. I'll know when I find it.

It's a small, shop that you could easily walk by if you didn't know about it.  \n\nThis cute couple some how turns clouds into cheesecakes--IT'S SO FLUFFY I'M GONNA DIE!!!! To give you an idea of how fluffy this cake is, you have to cut it with fishing line (included!) because it's so soft and delicate that it would just stick to the knife and you'd be left with mush...delicious mush...but that's beside the point.\n\nThe owner always suggests trying his plain cheesecake first before you try the flavored ones, and I agree.  The pure milky/ cheesey taste that you get from the airy cake is simply amazing.  I've tried all their fruit flavored ones, and although they too are amazing, my family and I always seem to go back to the original flavor.  \n\nNormally, I'm not a huge fan of cheesecakes simply because they're too dense and way too sweet (even for someone with a mouth full of sweet tooths like me) and i get sick of cheesecakes after just a few bites, but not Zanze's.  If you want NY cheesecake, go to NY but if you want an ethereal twist on cheesecake, come to SF!   Forget the gallon of ice cream while watching chick flicks...I'll take a large Zanze's cheesecake please.  \n\nThe only thing that I hate about this place is that TOO MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT and they sell out quickly!!!!!!!!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-12-28", "description": "So wonderful to see Sam Zanze and his marvelous cheesecake getting long overdue attention and praise.  I can't write about Zanze's without thinking of my late father, who went to high school with Mr. Zanze in Santa Cruz back in the late 1940s, and it was Dad who alerted me to this hidden treasure in the late 80s.  Since then, I've pretty much eliminated all varieties of cheesecake from my diet except those sliced by fishing line, which limits the field to Zanze's. \n\nWhile the cloud-like fluffiness of the cheesecake may tempt you to opt for super-size slices, don't look for Mr. Zanze to be your enabler.  He's quite content for you to enjoy his wares in moderation, and his obvious vitality and friendly demeanor would make him the perfect poster boy for the Cheesecake Association of America, if such an organization existed.  In other words, if you like your dessert to fill your plate, better take his serving guidelines and multiply by 2.\n\nAll varieties are excellent, but I hold a warm spot for both the chocolate and sour cherries with kirsch.  They also have blueberry, mocha, and raspberry, along with plain.  It's good to call ahead to make sure they're open, and that they haven't sold out of the variety and size you're seeking.\n\nFor all the contrived experiences that are foisted upon us as consumers, the individual expression of Zanze's Cheesecake is a delightful exception, with a unique and high quality product, delivered by a warm and sincere gentleman doing what he enjoys.", "author": "Hugh B."}

I had not realized they closed early on Saturday and his thoughtful call meant I got my cheesecake. Thank you again!\n\nI drive by this place almost every day and I've never really noticed it's existence. I've still never stepped foot inside it, but my roommate and his gf were UFC enough to have stopped in while walking around the neighborhood and realized they had stumbled onto desert gold. They brought back a small cheesecake topped with raspberries. The box had a small piece of fishing wire taped to it to cut the cake. That's right, it's so light you can't cut it with a knife without destroying it. Don't ask me how you're supposed to then lift the pieces without destroying the such beauty, but somehow we managed. Awwww yeahhhhh. My fork slide effortlessly through the cake and shortly thereafter my taste buds were freaking out and completely addicted for more. I've got a large on order to bring to work next Thursday and am probably going to go back to order another large for the house too.

Come Saturday, we drive up from the Peninsula with big smiles on our faces, wondering if all the fairy talesque stories were true.  We see the store -how cute and bright it seems- and we park.  We go in to find another costumer at the counter and a very cute 87 year old lady seating on a chair chatting the other lady up.  It is a very small place but it doesn't feel crowded somehow it is just inviting and cozy.\n\nOut comes Mr. Zanze carefully holding the cheesecake of the lady in front of us.  He looks adorable!  Like he should be sitting down, surrounded by small children while telling them stories with some large, old book sprinkled with sparkling fairy dust!  He says hi right away and proceeds to box her cheesecake.  The old lady is telling us how Mr. Zanze is a great dancer, and how dancing has kept her young -all this while doing a little happy feet motion while on her chair-.  Mr. Zanze then proceeds to tell this lady to remember to eat her veggies before digging into her cheesecake as she happily takes off.\n\nOur turn since the kind old lady seems more interested in chatting than picking up her cake.  Our first time there so he proceeds to explain all the details: how to use the fishing line, how long it'll keep for, how long it keeps if you freeze it, etc.  At the end, we're also reminded to eat our veggies.  He manages to say this with such warmth you feel obligated to comply (and you know you wouldn't be able to dig into that cheesecake with a good feeling unless you follow his instructions!).\n\nI carefully guard this piece of heaven while we drive back home.  While sporadically muttering some words to remind the bf to drive carefully, we do have a cheesecake on board!  We get home, eat something healthy, and finally, it is cheesecake time....  It is so fluffy the fishing line is a must (I just made myself hungry *tear*), lift it carefully with a knife which is about the width of the pieces you cut and it'll come out no problem.\n\nFinally, take a bite, *O-M-G*, *melts*.  How does he do it, my cheeks were tingling, I couldn't hold back a smile and a moan of pure joy.  It is so airy and fluffy and flavorful but still you feel so satisfied after one slice.  It has kept me happy since Saturday and I am sure it won't last too long so I am glad we got a large one.\n\nWhen you go to Mr. Zanze's be respectful and polite, respect this place that has made so many people happy because after you visit him once, you won't be able to stop finding excuses to buy more cheesecake!", "author": "melisa n."}

For my first time, I got the mini sized classic which serves about 8 slices I was told.\n\nI was amazed!  It had the flavor that I love about cheesecake without any of the heavy feeling!  It was amazing.  I will be honest, I ate three slices, and didn't feel guilty at all!  The bread crumb top was amazing and the cake it self was light and fluffy and cheesey.  \n\nI am now a fan of cheesecake.  At least this one.", "author": "Denise B."}

I will say right now, that i will be going to Zanze's this weekend because one of my friends from Vegas has heard us (me and another friend) rave about the cheesecake from this little tiny shop.\n\nAt first I thought it was a small cafe, but it's not. It's literally just a small shop, where seriously, only about 6 people can fit before you might have to go behind the counter. And it's a very quiet spot.\n\nBeing the only customers the first time I went to this place, the gentleman was really nice in helping us decide on what to do. He asked us if we've ever had the cheesecake before, and when we said no, he recommended that we go with the regular flavored cheesecake. This cheesecake is so delicate, and soft and literally melts in your mouth. It's so delicate that you have to cut it with fish wire to make the slices. It's fun to actually cut =)\n\nAnyways, the second time I went back to this place was when it was packed with people. I also learned that they don't take credit cards during my second visit. So anyways, we tried the raspberry cheesecake and just as good as the regular flavor. =) Definitely a place I would go to just for cheesecake.\n\nOnly thing is I always get confused with the hours and times they are open.  I have  a business card from them, but I don't know where I put it. boo.\n\nTry it. But don't take my word for this place =)", "author": "J D."}

Zanze uses Philadelphia cream cheese in their recipe, but I think that's better suited for the dense style cheesecakes. Ricotta makes a much better fluffy style.\n\nI ordered a small, regular flavor for $14 and waited a couple hours after dinner before digging in. The cake is very aerated and demands gentle handling or else it starts to get messy. The flavor is on the better side of decent, but the texture was a little too foamy for my liking. There was no need to wait two hours after dinner either, because the cake is so light it's almost not there.\n\nMy personal gauge for deciding how good a dessert is depends on whether or not I want to gobble the whole thing down in one sitting.

Around 3pm on a Friday, I decided to go here and get my mom a cheese cake for her birthday. I found metered parking right outside the store, and upon walking in the door, I got blasted by this heaaavenly aroma. I don't know how else to describe it. There was one other customer there, and he was already having his order boxed up and tied together with the string. I heard the man talk to this kid about how to store, cut, and serve the cheesecake. When it was my turn, I ordered a small raspberry cheesecake (around $10-$15) for my bf and I to split and a medium of the same flavor (for my mom's birthday gift) which was around $20-$25. I don't remember how much each were, but I ended up spending a total of $38 for those two cakes today. I'm glad I didn't read the reviews because I was so surprised and delighted at how light and fluffy the cheesecake was. (Insert \"Despicable Me\"s \"I'M SO FLUFFY!\" line here.) No but really, there's nothing more that I can say that would differ from any other review about this place here on Yelp.\n\nThe man, I think he's Zanze, or Mr. Zanze, or whatever his name is, takes much pride in his cheesecakes. You could hear it in his voice and see it on his face how much he loves his creation. He was very accommodating and he says he usually recommends the regular cheesecake if it's your first time there. He teaches you how to cut the cake using the fishing line they taped to the top corner of each box.\n\nIf you're into the more heavier and denser cheesecakes, then maybe this place isn't for you, but it's still DEFINITELY worth a try.", "author": "Michelle B."}

It's best if you call in and reserve your cakes a day or 2 in advance, as they sell out very quickly.  During holidays, it's best to reserve a couple weeks in advance.  The cakes come in small, medium or large (6'', 8'', or 10'' in diameter), in 6 different flavors - traditional, blueberry, chocolate, mocha, raspberry and sour cherries with kirsh.  Not all the flavors are available all the time, hence it's best to reserve in advance if you know there's something specific you want.  The shop is very small, so it's basically a call-and-order then pick-up kind of place.  Metered parking is right outside, enforced on Saturdays, so bring change.  The cake prices range from $13 to $30 each, and they accept cash or check only.  The airy texture of the cakes reminds me of a mousse - I do not know of anyone else who makes this kind of cake - Mr. Zanze will bake extra cakes which can be found at Molly Stone's Tower Market (635 Potrero Drive) so that people can buy them when his shop's closed.

He'll even ask if you have ever tried his masterpieces before... if not, he'll recommend the original vs. the other flavors. \n\nThe cheesecakes do freeze well, too. I was kind of hesitant to buy a whole cheesecake and it eat myself.  \n\nI'm not sure if the store is open on weekends, there were so many times that I passed by and the store was closed.

But for some reason I had some problems buying it.  I was buying four cheesecakes for ladies I work with and they wanted to buy it for themselves and their families of four.  I called in ahead to make sure they wont run out of cheesecakes and the owner asked how many ppl the cheesecake was for, to which I answered families of four each.  He suggested that I got the small cheesecake and I'd never seen the cakes myself before so I agreed.  Once I got there I saw the size of the cakes and decided the ladies would need a larger cake, so I apologized and asked for bigger sizes.  For some reason, he was very very very reluctant to sell me three medium cheesecakes instead of three small ones.  I still don't know why.  Maybe there was a shortage of those cakes? I'm not sure.  He didn't explain.  All in all, it was a lot of hassle just to upgrade to bigger cakes.  Or maybe he was afraid we wouldnt be able to finish such big cakes.  But the mediums turned out to be too small as well (we're monsters here I know).  But, it is the best cheesecake I've ever had and the man was quite pleasant once he decided to sell me the cakes.  But sorry for being the one four star review among all these perfect five stars :(\ntraditional cheesecakes are...\nsmall: $13\nmedium: $19\nI forget how much the large cheesecakes were.\n\nthey also have mocha, pumpkin, blueberry, and raspberry for slightly higher prices.  call in ahead to order the cakes/place them on hold so they dont run out.", "author": "Peggy W."}

Cheesecake has always been my favorite dessert and this is by far the best I've ever had.  I tried the traditional plain (as I tend to be old-school minimalist) and the texture is so delicate and rich, it nearly melts in your mouth.  The cake is fluffy and creamy yet dense enough to hold it's shape and have that weight that cheesecake does.  The size is perfect (not huge) and the fishing line is a requirement to make each piece the perfect portion without ruining the integrity of the rest of the cake.  The light dusting of powdered sugar along with the perfect paper doilie makes the presentation very elegant.  The price is high, but worth the indulgence.", "author": "Stephanie W."}

The cheesecake is really fluffy, almost mouse like. It also tastes like a mix between cheesecake and flan. It has a strong egg flavor and a really light cheesecake flavor. If it were up to me, I honestly wouldn't call it a cheesecake because it's completely different. If cheesecake is what you are craving, this isn't for you.

I ordered a large cheesecake(original flavor) about 5 days in advance just so I can munch of one of these for Thanksgiving.  The workers are super friendly and nice and has the family owned business feel. You either order small/medium/large. You can't order by the slice just to have a taste of it before you order the whole enchilada. They instruct you to use their fishing line to cut the cake(marketing ploy), but you don't have to.  So...... what do I think of the cake?? It is by FAAAR the softest cheesecake I have ever tasted. Think of it like custard almost(but cheesecake flavor). The flavors were pretty good and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It might be even too soft for me haha.

The rave reviews on yelp sold us and once I walked in and smelled the wonderful cheesecakes I knew it was going to be good!  They were about to close, but luckily they had one small cheesecake left.  The owner was so nice and delicately wrapped up our cheesecake.  He also showed us how to use the fishing wire to cut the cake.  When we got home my husband and I immediately each had a slice.  It was HEAVEN.  I love that the flavor is classic cheesecake but  it was airy and fluffy not dense.  I will definitely be going back here for cheesecake and will try their other flavors.  The owner told me that he once had a very pregnant woman come in for a cheesecake and when he asked her when she was due she responded with \"right now\".

These cakes are fluffy, light, not too thick or rich, and with a thin layer of crumbling atop the whole delicious delicate creaminess of it all... So yeah, now we usually get the medium size and it lasts, well, a day - that's better anyway, right?\n\nWe just recently officially moved to the East Coast, so I haven't been able to get my Zanze on lately. Over the dismal East Coast winter, we became so homesick for Zanze's cheesecake that when my mom flew back to SF to visit friends, she actually came back with not one but THREE huge cheesecakes. And they were delicious. Apparently this is quite a common occurence, too - we were talking to the old man who runs the whole operation one time and he told us about how he regularly gets orders from out-of-staters intent on sharing the love, especially around the holidays, when he enlists family members to help him churn out the (family recipe) cheesecake. \n\nIn my opinion, the original flavour is totally the best, but my brother is partial to the chocolatey cheesecake.

I'd been meaning to try Zanze's for years, being a huge cheesecake fan and having read great things. I was indulging in one of those \"take it as it comes\" afternoons, and decided to venture on over at long last. The shop itself is pure and simple... they sell about 4 flavors of cheesecakes and cherries for topping. That's it. Don't go expecting fancy display cases. But do go expecting some of the best cheesecake you will ever have and the most friendly, wonderful greeting. The instant you start talking, you realize why word of mouth has built such a cult following for Zanze's. When I asked, the gentleman said this month is their 28 year (I hope I remembered the exact number correctly!) anniversary of being in business. All those years selling one phenomenally good thing to people who adore it. Now that's a good life. And when you bite into the cheesecake, you can understand why. Some people don't like cheesecake. I think they've been subjected to gummy, heavy cakes and soggy crusts. Zanze's is a whole different experience. It's feather light, melts in your mouth, and has no crust except a light sprinkling of crumbs on top. I ate mine with a few cherries and left it at that. Another charming touch is that they tape a bit of fishing wire on the top of each box, and you use that to cut your cake. They will explain exactly how, so that you can have the best possible pieces. The hours are a bit limited since it is such a family-run operation, but when you find a spare window of time to follow a whim, I'd highly recommend checking if they are open and heading on over.", "author": "Shoshana D."}

My mom always asks me to pick up a cheesecake there for her when I go visit her. Yummy. Very light and tasty. We're going to have some for their wedding anniviersary party.", "author": "B O."}
