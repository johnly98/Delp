Thanks to yelp we were able to find this place. We were a bit skeptical at first because of the reviews but we decided to give this place a try.\n\nWe arrived during happy hour so a lot of items were at a cheaper price. Happy hour is DINE-IN only and does not apply during holidays! I decided to order a pound of shrimp ($15.50/ lb) with hurricane cajun sauce and mild spiciness. My boyfriend opted for the crawfish since it was live and it's rare that we come across places that have live crawfish. I can't recall the price on the top of my head since it was marked as \"market price\" which was subject to change. We also ordered some fries and chicken wings (~$6 during happy hour). \n\nI loved the way the served their shrimp! Instead of having it in a plastic bag, they served their seafood in a round steel container which kept the seafood hot. The hurricane sauce was also delicious with just the right amount of garlic chunks. If you do want extra garlic, they do charge for it! The shrimp itself was also good, it wasn't mushy from being overcooked at all. The wings and fries were also seasoned very well and to die for. My boyfriend ended up ordering another box of fries to go (that's how much he loved it!). Our dining experience was that good we told our friends about this and all of us ended up going again the next day. Definitely try this place out if you don't want a super long wait for delicious cajun seafood!", "author": "Diana L."}

When I came here with a group of people last time, we all enjoyed the food and the sauce. \n\nI was in the area again last night with my husband and his friend, so my husband and I were excited to try it again. We were disappointed that the yelp deal was no longer available. It became obvious pretty quickly that this place is now under new management. The service was pretty terrible. They were clearly understaffed with just two people serving, so I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. But it took them a long time to seat all three of the groups that were waiting for a table even though there were tables available. Once we were seated, we sat for about 15 min and none of the staff even realized that our order had not been taken yet. The table next to us, who came in after us had long had their order taken already. We finally flagged down the younger server and asked for hot water for my friend and to order our food. She left and never came back, she started putting together silverware instead. We flagged her down again and she realized she has forgotten the hot water, but we just asked to take our order. It then became clear that she didn't speak English, if she did, she spoke very little. She had to get the older woman to take our order. The younger server seemed very oblivious the entire time we were there, and the service was all over the place. I noticed another table waiting a long time to try and flag down a server for their check.\n\nI've been a server before, and even though they were understaffed, they didn't try and anticipate or meet the customers' needs at all. They weren't hustling to try and make up for being understaffed. Even when they weren't actively serving tables, they disappeared and did other random things. They never anticipated when someone needed their check, or checked in on the tables, or refilled the waters. \n\nOur food also came out at separate times, even though we all ordered similarly. Our friend got his food much faster than we did. The food itself was good. I had originally wanted crawfish but they were out. So my husband and I each ordered a pound of shrimp. The shrimp were big and pretty fresh. The sauce was good, my husband really likes it, although it was a little runnier/thinner than I like. Overall the food was good, not sure if it would be enough inducement to go back again with the poor service and how long the meal took.", "author": "Vannlyda I."}

Their garlic butter sauce is pretty good, with loads of garlic but no spice. Their hurricane Cajun sauce is weak. I got mild spiciness and my boyfriend got medium - they both ended up tasting the same and only a hint of spice. The sauce is also very thin, almost like a soup. Additionally, we always get their garlic noodles, which are decent but not spectacular. \n\nBefore, getting one pound of the shrimp/clams + garlic noodles filled me up and I would leave with no room for dessert. I feel that their portions have gotten significantly smaller. There were probably only 8 shrimps in my bowl and a lot of the clams were just the shell. I figured maybe the clams were at the bottom of the bowl, but I only found one.. so they really were just the shells. My boyfriend and I were both not full nor satisfied when we left. \n\nService wasn't great, but probably because they were understaffed. It was difficult to flag down a server because they were either not on the floor or not paying attention. I would skip out on Swamp if you're looking for flavorful Cajun seafood.", "author": "Cecille W."}

I didn't see it on the menu but they assured me that they would be able to do that. I asked again to make sure before we headed there and they said they could.\n\nWe get there and the place is not busy at all. They take their time seating us, and then make us move tables for no reason at all (it was just my girlfriend and I). I am pretty laid back so I didn't have an issue. \n\nWe ordered, and I made sure to have our waitress say twice that they could do fried coconut shrimp, as my girlfriend is picky with her crustaceans. They said yes.\n\nOur food comes out, I ordered the Shrimp, Mussels, and Crawfish bowl with corn + potatoes. My girlfriend's food comes out and it was their bowl of coconut shrimp (coconut sauce, not fried coconut-style). She was very disappointed but we understood it must have been an issue with communication and the waitress/restaurant misunderstood what we meant by fried coconut-style. Since we had triple checked that it was going to be fried, and my girlfriend would not eat the boiled/sauce style, we simply asked for our waitress to take it back to the kitchen. She wouldn't eat it, not a single bite. \n\nOur waitress argued with us and said we were wrong and thats what we had ordered. She said it was our fault, and was refusing to take it back without payment. I said there was no way we should pay for something that we didn't eat when the misunderstanding went both ways. She stood there and said we were wrong, in front of other guests. It was embarrassing.\n\nShe finally took the food away and told us she would take it off of the bill. At that point I honestly didn't care, I just wanted her to go away. I finished my food, which was good but not anything special. I'm from Georgia so I'm familiar with Cajun food (even though this is C'asian).\n\nThe bill comes and the coconut boiled shrimp has been taken off of the bill, but $7 was added to my bill for some arbitrary reason. It was like they had to charge me some way for the food that we did not eat or want. \n\nOverall it was a very unpleasant and uncomfortable, as well as embarrassing, experience. I've worked as a server for 7+ years and never, ever, have I argued with a customer and told them they're wrong about an order and that they have to pay for something they didn't touch. The place also seemed dirty and poorly managed.\n\nI still left a 15% tip but I will never give this place my money again. Go elsewhere.", "author": "Paul S."}

If you're looking for Crawfish: don't go to SF.\n \nThe crawfish was in season (was here last Friday) so don't get me wrong: it was good.. but for half a pound: I highly doubt it was actually half a pound (for the 2 item combo 1/2 lb x 1/2 lb of your shellfish item choices).\n\nLike in San Jose: they give you heaps. Unlike the Cajun  Shellfish/Crawfish establishments in San Jose: your food comes in a bowl and not in a saturated bag. \n\nIt's probably more worth it here to get the other shellfish options.\nPersonally, I don't eat a lot of shrimp, so I'd probably do clams all the way or something. My cousins don't eat crawfish at all, but they love the shrimp and the other shellfish options here.\n\nI got the Thai Curry Sauce and it was really good.

There was a party of 11 seated right across from us. All family members. We knew our food was going to take a minute to get to us due to the large party. I didn't seem to worry since I was enjoying their happy hour beer, $4.25 for a pint of Corona. They have an awesome selection of beers on tap. Our Cajun fries didn't take long to arrive. Small size but good flavor. The server gave us bibs and a big bowl to put shells in. After the party of 11 received all their food, we received ours. I ordered their 1 lb of hurricane Cajun shrimp with medium spiciness. 7/10\n\nThe food was 4/5. Service 5/5. Beer section 5/5 \n\nHowever, I do want to address an issue I had with my experience. While I was eating, I kept hearing the large party complain about every little thing ( the price, the slowness, the attitude of the staff, the selection of hot sauce ). I was truly embarrassed with the situation. When the large party got the bill, they were unhappy with the required tip for large parties. They were complaining among themselves on why they had to pay almost $60 in tip. When one of them discussed it with the server, the server explained very calmly how they charge a 15% gratuity tip for parties of 6 or larger. The lady complained how it was ridiculous they were being charge that much \"since the service was slow and the food had no flavor.\" I don't know what this lady was expecting. Every restaurant I have been to requires a gratuity tip for large parties. It sucks but I understand. The lady kept saying how she was going to leave a horrible review on Yelp.

I was craving shrimp/crawfish boil and this was the only place nearby open for lunch and with a decent health inspection score (90!).  We got the gumbo, sweet potato fries, garlic noodles, sausage, shrimp and crawfish hurricane sauce + corn (medium--it wasn't spicy so will try higher next time).  We were pretty hungry and felt the food arrived timely, hot, and in normal/expected portions to what we've gotten at other places.  I don't think we'd get the gumbo and sausage again (it was fine, but we're not huge gumbo and sausage fans in general--got them just to try), but we'll definitely be back for the crawfish and shrimp boil.  Yes, this place is not the Boiling Crab but it's good and hits the spot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-11", "description": "Excellent, PPQ brought Cajun seafood to the Richmond. We had been curious about Swamp, with its eye-catching name in blue lettering and black awning. The interior has some interesting faux window paintings of scenic ocean views. The rest of the restaurant is very simple without all the usual cheesy seaside decorations.\nSo we came for an early dinner once and sat by the window. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw some spindly legs moving along the wall. I turned to check out what was in my peripheral vision and it was a daddy long-legs. Since the restaurant was still fairly empty, they didn't mind us switching to another table. It's no one's fault. I just remember it vividly. Maybe the spider likes Cajun food too?\n\nThe shellfish menu is pretty simple. You just...\n1) Choose your shellfish. Pay by the pound.\n2) Choose a sauce/flavor.\n3) Choose level of spice.\nThere is a good selection of starters and sides. Other than the usual seafood apps, like oysters & calamari, they also have some interesting ones like alligator sausage, hush puppies, and the crawfish beignet. \n\nWe went with the 2-item Combo ($15/lb.) of Shrimp & Mussels in Hurricane / Mild Sauce,\n& added Corn ($0.75) + Hot Link Sausage ($2.95):\nThe shrimp were tender and sweet, and the mussels were nice and springy. The dark red Hurricane sauce was quite tasty. I think the spicy sausages we added brought the mild close to a medium spice.\n\nKing Crab Legs in Garlic Butter ($29/lb):\nThese king crab legs tasted fresh, tender, and sweet. The leg meat was nice and springy. I appreciate that the crab legs were cut into smaller segments. They fit nicely in the bowls and made for easier eating. It went really well with the creamy garlic butter sauce.\n\nWe checked in for the free Cajun fries. They were a thicker cut, not too crunchy, lightly seasoned, pretty good. \n\nAfter we ate all the contents in our bowls, we were still left with a lot of sauce, which was perfect for dipping the toasted bread.\n\nI enjoyed the dishes we ordered. I have to say I prefer the garlic butter to their hurricane sauce. I would come back to try out the rest of their menu, including the alligator sausage. I had some alligator in Australia and I quite like it! I'd definitely like to take advantage of their Happy Hour menu (2-6PM) too.", "author": "Joy W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-02-17", "description": "I came here because of the groupon deal because their seafood prices by the pound are pretty expensive and I would say overpriced. I did have high expectations of this place because it did have decent ratings and I've been wanting to try it, but I was disappointed :( \n\nThe server came pretty quickly but we weren't ready yet. However, when we were, it was pretty hard to get ahold of the server even though the restaurant was pretty empty. We were also not offered bibs, while I noticed other people had them on. A few other things I've noticed that were different from other Cajun places I've been to was that the food came in bowls instead of bags, we weren't offered limes, and we use plates and forks instead of the table and our hands. \n\nI checked in on Yelp for the free Cajun fries. Thank god I did not pay for those fries. It was the worse fries I've ever had and the smallest! It was not crunchy nor was it hot. In addition, there was barely any Cajun powder. I couldn't taste any Cajun at all. \n\nWe started off with a pound of shrimp and clams in the hurricane sauce and the medium and habanero spice. The clams weren't worth it at all. The clam meat was very small and there were even some that were empty. The shrimp wasn't bad, but I've definitely had better. The shell was stuck to the shrimp pretty well, so it was hard to peel. \n\nAs for the hurricane sauce, I am not the biggest fan of coconut curry, so it didn't come as a surprise that I wasn't the biggest fan of the sauce. It wasn't bad, but I prefer the house sauces at Cajun House and Boiling Crab. I don't really like the sweetness of it, so I probably should've tried the garlic sauce instead. Not to mention, there wasn't enough garlic in the sauce like I would normally expect.\n\nWe were still hungry so we decided to order another pound of shrimp and to try the garlic noodles. My mom told me not to because it's easily made and pretty expensive but since there were so many reviews about it, I thought I should. Man did I regret it. The bowl of garlic noodles came in a smaller bowl than the shrimp! My mom thought it would be oily because it would be made with butter but it barely had any at all. Normally that would be good, but this meant that the noodles had no flavor! I could barely see any garlic and you couldn't taste the garlic much either. The garlic hadn't been cooked to the point where the flavor had all come out yet or there just wasn't enough. I wished I had gotten something else instead....\n\nLastly, when I was about to use the groupon deal I found out I couldn't use the $50 value one because we didn't have four people, so we ended up paying an extra 30 instead. I guess it was my fault that I misunderstood the terms when it said dinner for 4 but I had just thought that it meant that the food was enough to fill four people...I mean if 2 people are eating $50 worth, doesn't that mean each person is paying more? That should be better for the business right? Well apparently not. If I had known ahead of time, we wouldn't have ordered the second pound of shrimp and the garlic noodles, especially since the groupon wasn't saving us that much to begin with. \n\nIn conclusion, I probably wouldn't come back here again. The groupon is a good deal but $25 can't get you much food and definitely not enough for two people to be full. I don't particularly like the sauce either and definitely not the fries and noodles. Both my mom and I have agreed that we prefer Cajun House in terms of sauce, portion, freshness, service, and noodles! Of course, my favorite will always be Boiling Crab, but that's considerably further.", "author": "Tina P."}

When we first arrived it wasn't very busy, the 3 or 4 servers seemed flustered and confused. It only got worse as more customers arrived. No one is greeted when you walk in, and it isn't clear if you wait to be seated, or seat yourself. Once seated, menus were tossed at us hastily without a word being said. We quickly decided what we wanted, put down the menu and waited, and waited and waited until we eventually flagged someone down. She didn't ask us if it was our first time, didn't ask us what we wanted to drink, didn't ask if the sky was blue, nothing.  We neglected to order drinks and had to flag her down again. They didn't check on us ONE TIME during our meal, we had to flag them down for extra napkins and bibs which should already be provided because...messy. During our meal we saw several frustrated customers having to regularly flag someone down to get any services. I saw a women with a To-Go bag walk BACK in, speak to a server regarding her bill and then walk away, I made eye contact with her as she was leaving and she rolled her eyes and said \"OMG\". \nI hear ya girl! They also made a *BIG* error on our final bill. \n\nOn a side note, the guy running around in sweat pants, who I assume to be the owner and didn't seem to do much of anything but hang near a couple tables in the back randomly turned on the music in the middle of our dinner, when he first turned on the music it was so loud, we saw several people startle, myself included. \n\nFood: This is NOT authentic. It is more Asian/Cajun Fusion. \n~ They should AT LEAST invest in Crystal hot sauce. It is straight from Louisiana.\n1) Oysters: Can't really mess up raw oysters, but you CAN mess up the raw oyster experience. The limes (not lemons, LIMES) we were given were dry, they had no juice at all. The horseradish and cocktail sauce were in the same tiny container and if you don't like horseradish it was difficult to get the cocktail sauce out, they did NOT provide a spoon for the condiment and we had to try and use our forks....fail, Oyster Experience Ruined.\n\n2) Hush Puppies - dry, hard and BLAND. Zero flavor. They came with a sauce which was tasty, but didn't fit with the Hush Puppies. SKIP THEM.\n\n3) Alligator Sausage and Slaw - This was the best part of the meal. Sausage was flavorful, tender and juicy. The slaw was drenched in a tangy sauce. Good Combo. Needed Crystal Hot Sauce though!\n\n4) Cajun Fries - Free with our YELP Check-In. The check in on Yelp says that it expired 6/30/2014, but apparently they are still accepting it. These were good, regular fries with a spicy seasoning. I'd order them again, but I'll never be back so maybe not. \n\n5) Shrimp and Clam Boil w/ Signature Hurricane Sauce - They should really put down what the Hurricane Sauce is, we were pretty disappointed. Given the name, we figured it would be a blend of true LA Cajun flavors...wrong. It is curry. The shrimp was cooked nicely, not overly done, however we have experienced shrimp much easier to peal than these ones.. The clams were good, but I did have a few that were really gritty. \n\nDecor: It is cute. I like the maroon wall painted up like bourbon street. I do think the other wall could use a huge mural of a bayou, but the small photo is OK too. \n\nFinal Thoughts: I would not return to this place.

The server was nice but just like everyone else.... they would not accept the Groupon. They told me they switched ownership and to contact Groupon (which I plan to did).\n\nThe food... the house sauce at Swamp was good (not greasy/overly buttery) but it tasted like they used frozen crawfish which is a big no no. The meat loses its flavors and tenderness when its frozen so its not as good. I wonder if they used frozen due to seasonal reasons....hmm.... I would love to try this place again during crawfish season. The garlic noodles were very good. (I wished they sold that with chicken as a lunch special like the pics in yelp but when I called before, they said they stopped serving lunch.\n\nWe also tries butter garlic and coconut curry sauces. I like mixing the house sauce with the butter garlic so its not that spicy (even though we got mild, it was still too spicy for me)", "author": "Karen L."}

I always get the boil with crawfish and shrimp with hurricane sauce, and all the extras, and garlic noodles. The food gets 10 stars. But I have to bring my rating down because of the atmosphere. It's not very inviting and they have multiple TVs blasting different channels at the same time, which is very strange and irritating. They should be playing some new orleans jazz or something, that would be really cool and fitting. I've been there probably 6 times when this has happened. I would come here for lunch more, but no one is in there so it's awkward and I just opt to order takeout. I think its because of the weird atmosphere that's pushing some people away. I also have to say that I was there about a year ago on a Saturday night and the staff was very friendly but they were over-serving people alcohol. They even let someone take a bottle of sake to go, who was so drunk he was falling over breaking glasses and drooling on himself.  I'd reccomend they keep that in check.", "author": "Simone B."}

Dipping those little nuggets of seafood in the chili sauce that it came with added to the deliciousness. \n\nWe then ordered the garlic noodles and king crab legs in lemon pepper sauce..wanted to try the hurricane sauce, but the boyfriend is not a fan of curry :( I'd never had garlic noodles before, but I thought they had a good bite and were even tastier drenched in the lemon pepper sauce.\n\nThe crab legs were very meaty and they gave us a big portion. That crab was sooo good! I like that they pre cut the shell so it's easier for you to claw the meat out. The fact that they serve everything in bowls makes it less messy which we definitely appreciated. I think bibs and extra utensils are given upon request because we didn't get any, but we didn't really need them. \n\nI wanted to order more, but we were stuffed with 1 pound of crab and an order of noodles. \n\nSwamp is yummy seafood, cool NOLA decor, and friendly staff.

Try to find the little hidden alleys of parking lots (they do have meters). \n\nAPPEARANCE:\nTypical tacky boat decoration that you see at other Cajun style restaurants but Swamp doesn't have wooden walls and tables to write on. It was pretty dim inside. Lots of seating available. \n\nSERVICE:\nEveryone was so nice, even when we stopped by 30ish~ minutes before they closed. A little laggy on water at first but they started filling up our waters more constant almost at the end of our meal. \n\nPRICES:\n$13/lb of shrimp which is a little more than other places that usually charge $11-12/lb. \n\nFOOD:\nWe ordered a pound of their shrimp in their hurricane flavor, (Cajun, garlic butter and lemon pepper), wings, garlic noodles and rice. \n\nSHRIMP:\nIt didn't come in a plastic bag, came in a bowl which I'm not a fan of since it lets the shrimp cool down faster which is NO BUENO. Thumbs up on their hurricane sauce though.\n\nGARLIC NOODLES: \nIt was yummy, 1 order was definitely more than enough for 3 people. \n\nWINGS:\nI didn't try them out but my friend said they were pretty good. \n\nI noticed that they had beignets for dessert so hell yeah I ordered them! \n\nBEIGNETS:\nI've only had these babies at Disneyland so that's where I'm basing these off of. Swamp's beignets were more fluffy on the inside and they weren't hallow compared to Disney's. Definitely 2 thumbs up! \n\nOVERALL:\nIt was a great experience!

This used to be my absolutely favorite place in the central Richmond. I went last night and ordered my usuals: spicy cajun wings, garlic noodles, garlicy green beans, and shrimp in mild garlic butter sauce. There was only one person working initially and he did not notice my friend and I for a long time - we ended up seating ourselves and getting our own menus by the door while we waited for him to come over. The server initially brought us fries, which we did not order, before realizing they belonged to another table - there were only 3 tables taken at that time. Two items in our order came out wrong, which we confirmed when we got the check: our spicy wings were written down as 'mild' and our shrimp came boiled with no sauce at all....I thought the waiter may have misheard me when I ordered so I repeated the shrimp order and pointed to the sauce on the menu, but it seems it was still written wrong. The green beans tasted fine, definitely the best thing we got, but the garlic noodles were noticeably dry and a smaller portion compared to my many previous visits. \n\nI get that switching ownership can take some adjustment, but it really feels like the quality of the cooking has gone down and the new staff is not well trained.", "author": "Vika M."}

With that said, it's decent if you don't compare (too much). The restaurant has a slight \"mardi gras\" theme, with beads and stuff hanging from the wall on the right when you enter. The old man, who I assume is the owner, was very nice and cheerful. He seated me even though my friend wasn't there yet.\n\nIt was kind of busy for a Saturday night -- the restaurant was about three-fourths full. When my friend arrived, it took a while before we had our orders taken since the servers were suddenly MIA and the owner was chatting up the table next to us. But as soon as he noticed, he turned around and helped us. He was very nice about the free fries with Yelp check-in (no rolling eyes or exasperated look because someone is redeeming a coupon THEY put up, so that was nice).\n\nFood came rather promptly. I had 1lb of the 2 item combo with shrimp and clam ($14/lb), medium spicy and Hurricane seasoning (equivalent to \"The Whole Shebang\") with sausages (I think it was 6 pieces for $2.50, which is way cheaper than BC I think) and corn ($0.75?). My friend had shrimp with corn and potato (they literally give you one huge spud haha). Food came in a metal bowl and at first I thought it wasn't going to be enough for me, but I was satisfied at the end. The Hurricane sauce tastes a lot like gumbo...Tasty, but doesn't really sit right for a crawfish boil (but then again, I don't know much about boils...). Shrimp was cooked perfectly, nice and crisp. But the corn was defnitely soggy and overcooked.\n\nService was good overall. We had our waters refilled without asking, and limes were brought out after we asked. At the end of our meal, they didn't rush us to leave or give us the check. They also give you heated hand wipes, which is a nice touch!

Decent size and good sauce. We had corns and regular sausages. Mix well with the sauce of the shrimp and the combo.

It's a bit pricey in my opinion ($15.99/lb) but worth it mostly due to lack of other options. I would skip adding the hot dogs / potatoes unless you reaaaaally want them. They're not amazing and I feel like it doesn't cook in the sauce long enough to really soak it up. I must say, the garlic butter sauce is delicious! For sides, I love the garlic noodles and the gumbo. \n\nFor the ambiance - depends when you go! It's usually been pretty empty when I've gone (even weekends 6pm) so you don't have to wait very long. I personally prefer that because you can actually hear your party talking.  It seems like a nice place to watch Warriors games as they've got the big TVs, but no roaring crowd like in a sports bar or other venues to watch it amongst other fans. The decor itself is cajun themed and interesting to look at. \n\nService is hit or miss.

The calamari was pretty good, it had like a curly fries taste to it and they were really crispy. The cajun wings were meh... I thought they were going to be dry rubbed sort of wings, but they are really saucy. I am guessing the sauce is their hurricane sauce.

They're perfectly crispy and seasoned; comparable to the Boiling Crab ones. \n\nWe also ordered 1 lb of mild shrimp in the hurricane sauce with one corn.

At first, I was skeptical of how good this place could be, but I thought, why not, and bought the groupon anyways. Boy was I glad I did. My boyfriend and I didn't want to order too much at first, so we got 1.5 pound of shrimp and hot link sausages (6). We got the mild hurricane sauce and the sauce was what made us fall in love. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and saltiness, and we doused our plump and juicy shrimp in the sauce before taking each bite. The shrimp was so fresh and sweet! After we finished out 1.5 pounds, it was so good that we ordered ANOTHER POUND and added a garlic noodle as well. Even the garlic noodles blew me away. I hate garlic, but the noodles were soooooo good. It was very simple, but mixing it with some of the hurricane sauce and eating it with the shrimp made it extra tasty. I'm drooling just thinking about how good that meal was. Definitely left very satisfied. I will be back!", "author": "Vivian T."}

You can use it during happy hour.\n\nI ordered everything on the happy hour menu except for the wings. All food is priced just about $6, raw miyagi oysters priced at $1.25 each.\n\nFried catfish - Mediocre. Tender inside, decent breading, lame spices for a creole joint. You get small to medium pieces.\n\nFried calamari - Mediocre. Salty, again not seasoned with spices enough. Enough to share between two people with medium appetites.\n\nGarlic noodles - Standard garlic noodles. Buttery and garlicky. Decent helping, comes in a medium sized bowl.\n\nOysters - This is the main reason I came here. Didn't want to go to bar crudo or hog&rocks due to my hate of crowds. Standard miyagi oysters. Clean, however $0.25 more than they are at the aforementioned oyster happy hours.. and that adds up since We ordered two dozen oysters.\n\nDraft beers - $4\nHouse wine (looked like a single serving bottle of some grocery store wine) - $4.50\nI've heard worse prices for happy hour beers so no complaints.\n\nService - Very nice, but a bit slow and incompetent, kind of like that really old person in your college101 class who sits front and center.\n\nI'll come back to try the boiled shellfish.. maybe. When groupon has a 25% off deal.. maybe.", "author": "Douglas Y."}

Service was very friendly and warm. We started with the gator sausage which was good. It was salty and tasty but the flavor didn't mimic your typical pork, beef or chicken sausage. There was nothing funky about the flavor but I would say try it if you're curious. I also had the shrimp, clams and mussels (yes, they have mussels which were super plump!) all in the hurricane sauce, mild. The sauce was tasty and not overwhelmingly spiced or too bland but their mild sure tasted like medium. It was fine for me but a little too much heat for others at the table. \n\nKeep in mind that Swamp does not use plastic bags for the seafood. They actually use big white ceramic bowls which I prefer. You don't have to roll down the sides of the plastic bag or dunk your hand in to search and fish out the seafood. In the bowl, it's easy to see all of the seafood and pick out a piece. Also, I appreciate the use of ceramic bowls which is very green and doesn't produce all the waste that plastic bags do. \n\nIf you want dessert, I saw a sign on the wall saying they now have fried banana served with Mitchell's ice cream. I think it's only vanilla or chocolate ice cream offered but macapuno with fried banana would be bombsies. \n\nAlso, we were able to catch part of a Giants game playing on the TV above the bar, which does have beer on tap.", "author": "Maya S."}

I was a little hesitant because I equate restaurant Groupons with \"desperate for business\". When we walked in at 4:30pm, I thought my fears were realized since it was mostly empty. They even seated us by the window. A classic restaurant trick to attract outside foot traffic.\n\nBut as others have stated, the service here is great. The waitress was patient when we wanted  the crawfish and was told that it was out of season. We ended up ordering a whole crab with garlic butter sauce, the shrimp & clam combo with lemon pepper sauce, 1/2 dozen raw oysters, gumbo with rice, garlic noodles, corn, potato, and French bread for dipping.\n\nThe oysters were not that great. I don't think they were as fresh as they could be. The gumbo is one of the best that I had and tasted very authentic. The crab was tasty. The legs were full of meat and I was pleasantly surprised that they included the \"goo\". Shrimp and clams were fresh and went really well with the lemon pepper sauce. I would pass on the garlic noodles in the future. It was a little clumpy and did not have that garlic punch that you would expect from other crab places in SF.\n\nExtra bonus was that they still offered Happy Hour prices on a Sunday.

While I appreciate this restaurant's best efforts to try to combine two different genres of food between Cajun and Asian fusion, for someone who loves Cajun it just didn't taste like the type of food I was hoping for.  I ordered three different dishes and none tasted to the quality that I would expect in a 4 star restaurant, let alone two dishes really didn't taste like the normal Cajun dishes I repeatedly enjoy.

We got here around 3pm, and we were happy to see that their happy hour is from 3-6pm, and you get 15% off your bill!!!! (SCORE) Also we were super excited because with a yelp check in, you get a free side of cajun fries.\n\nMy bf and I each got a pound of shrimp in the hurricane sauce (cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper, and coconut curry mixed together) with corn, along with garlic noodles and the cajun fries. \n\nThe cajun fries came out first--thin crunchy fries covered with cajun seasoning. Loved them!! After a while they did get a little spicy, but you have to expect that from anything cajun haha. The shrimp came out next in bowls! I liked this because your hands don't get as messy (for example, at BC or craw station you have to reach your hand into the bag and get your whole hand dirty haha) and it came with a spoon! We ended up spooning our hurricane sauce on top of our garlic noodles and O M G they were sooo good!! The garlic noodles were definitely a nice addition--needed a starch to cool our mouths off from the hurricane sauce hahah!! Super garlicky and not too oily.\n\nThe sauce here is thinner than boiling crab or kicking crab, but definitely has good flavors!! I loved the addition of the coconut curry and I could definitely taste it! The only gripe that my bf and I had about the sauce was that it was pretttty spicy. I don't necessarily like or dislike spicy stuff, but I can definitely tolerate it; my sauce definitely had a bigger kick than what I was used to for \"mild\"! Next time I know to order non spicy, because my bf's sauce still had a kick to it even though he got non spicy (probably just the cajun flavoring). \n\nPrices are around the same as craw station on 9th. Shrimp is $14/lb and I think that is a bit expensive. The garlic noodles were $7.50 and I think the fries were $3.50 (remember to check in!!!)\n\nBecause we came at an off hour, there were only 2 workers but they were both really nice and attentive.

We select the option two people for $59 recommended by the waitress thinking it would prob cover good food and she emphasize the crab is good. I saw there's a crab or lobster option but we wasn't being asked. The first food came Out was cold slaw which was okay. And then come the clam chowder which was good. But the main dish came out was one crab and it wasn't fresh. The meat are soft and falling apart. I am a sea food lover and I would know the different between fresh or Dead Seafood which I think the crab was dead before they cooked it that's why the meat are not chewy and soft. So for the price I would think you get some quality food but I guess not. The garlic noodle was not bad, a little too much garlic for me but It was just my personal preference. Also the waitress ask for what side dish would I want and I said French fries and I saw an extra charge for French fries.  I didn't look carefully to see if French fries was on the side dish menu but if it was not she should still let me pick a side dish that came with the order and lastly at check out I wanna pay with my birthday gift card and she said I'm not sure if the machine will take it. I just get so upset at the end. I think I would have liked it more if we order individual items like crawfish, shrimps or clams", "author": "Serena Y."}

(Inside joke between my bf & I, hehe) \n\nOne thing for sure, this place isn't swampy, hehe. I've been here twice and have had a good experience for both. My bf & I were both craving cajun food (second time) and it was between Swamp & Cajun House. Last time we were to Cajun House, it was super crowded, hard to find parking, and a bit of disappointment after purchasing a GroupOn deal. Swamp is located on the busy streets of Geary, but I don't think parking is too bad as compared to 5th Ave.. and they also have the awesome check-in deals for dine-ins - FREE cajun fries as appetizers! \n\nThe interior here kinda brings me back home in NOLA because of all the festive decorations they have up. The staff is friendly and attentive. The manager(?) I think .. whoever the guy is, is funny. \n\nMy typical order is always a pound of shrimp and a side of corn and rice. Hurricane flavor with medium spicy (always a regret). \n\nPricing for my order: \nShrimp - $14/lb \nCorn - $0.75\nRice - $1.50 \nCoke/soft drink - $2.50 (free refill!) \n\nI guess for my review, I will let you know what my bf & I do. When our order comes out, we like to dump all the shrimp onto the plate to cool off. After a couple mins (even when still kinda hot), we peel all the shrimps and dump the excess remains into a bowl (provided by staff) and put the shrimps meat into the bowl that it came with (into the sauce bowl). Before we add the rice into the sauce bowl, we take out the excess sauce with a spoon and put it onto our plates, since we have no where else to put it (and in case you took out too much, you can add it back in). Lastly, we add the rice into the sauce bowl that already has the shrimp, and we mix it! Ta-da!! Even the manager guy liked our idea! ;) \n\nAs for the medium spicy, I always forget that I shouldn't order it and regret it during my meal. For my second visit, I asked our waitress how spicy it would be and she said on a scale of 1-10, it'd be a 6. I took the chance and it felt like an 8!! T_T I should just order mild next time .. \n\nFrom what I remember on our first visit, we ordered Grilled Alligator Sausage ($6.50) and it tasted like chicken to us. It's always a good experience to try something new though, even if you may or may not like it. The gumbo ($8) from what I remember was good, nothing all that spectacular but maybe I'm biased because I lived in NOLA for awhile. \n\nOverall, I always enjoy my experience here and would definitely come back. When ordering the pound of shrimps, I highly recommend the hurricane sauce! Add a corn to your liking too ;)\n\nWant to know the inside joke for the poster child thing? It's cause my bf & I were seated next to the front window when the restaurant was empty. People would see us eating and stop and stare or look at the menu before walking off or coming in. We would have a little argument that one of us was catching the attention and being the poster child, haha.", "author": "Mandy G."}

While waiting for my order, I wanted to buy one of their shirts, but the server couldn't find the size I was looking for.  :(  \n\nWhen I got back to my car, the food smelled so good, I had to try it before I got home.

I could tell their mouths were drooling.\n\nOn 2/2, I took a coworker friend there.  He order the fried catfish and hush puppies.  I ordered the gumbo and crawfish beignet.  He was blown away with the catfish and hush puppies.  He's still talking about it.  My gumbo was good, not like I had growing up, but it was a good \"fix\".  The crawfish beignet was interesting.  It wasn't bad.  I could taste that it was frozen and it wasn't fully heated through.  There were \"cool\" spots in the middle of the beignet and crawfish.  I'll pass on ordering it again.

We started off with 2 dozen oysters. They were good (pretty big + fresh) but not amazing. We also got free cajun fries for checking in on yelp. The fries were fantastic.\n\nI ordered 1lb of shrimp in the hurricane flavor, no spicy. The hurricane flavor is the Boiling Crab \"whole shebang\" sauce equivalent, with all the boil flavors combined. The sauce was comparable to other similar places I love (Boiling Crab, Kickin Crab)- it was flavorful with a good consistency. \n\nHowever, unlike the other places, Swamp's Hurricane sauce contains coconut curry which really made a noticeable difference. I could very distinctly taste the curry and the coconut was very fragrant. Not sure if I liked it or not, and probably could have done without it, but it certainly was interesting. \n\nFor portions, my friends and I felt like they gave us less shrimp than other places do. Amongst our group, 3 of us frequent Boiling/Kickin crab in the Bay, and usually we're more full after 1lb of shrimp than we were at Swamp. But actually I felt like the potentially smaller portion size was perfect, because I was at a good level after the meal. \n\nFor sides, you can choose several things to be added into your sauce. I highly, highly recommend getting at least 1 or 2 pieces of corn. The corn is sweet and hot, and tastes super good drenched in sauce. We also ordered garlic noodles, which I thought were phenomenal.

Regarding the garlic noodles, it was pretty obvious that they basically forgot we ordered them.  Instead of admitting it, they kept telling us that it was because the kitchen had to make \"fresh\" noodles (despite other tables around us getting their noodles).\n\nOverall, we're not coming back.  So sorry to see such a wonderful family run place take such a turn for the worse.", "author": "Michael A."}

I'm not gonna lie either - I ate here solely because hushpuppies were on the menu. Ordering a mixed pound of spiciest-level clams and mussels was just a forgettable means to an end.\n\nHow were the hushpuppies? I say above Boxing Room (which isn't intrinsically saying much) and below Brenda's French. My second-opinion Southern friend & I couldn't wrap our brains around the presence of whole corn kernels, but the overall texture and taste were in the acceptable range of what can be expected in this part of the country.\n\nI may be back to try the alligator sausage or to get more hushpuppies. But if the not-all-that-hot Hurricane Spicy Habanero was their highest heat level, I'm going to look elsewhere for seafood boils.

Walked in and it was dead, but we arrived around 5:30pm so it was still early. I ordered combo with crawfish and shrimp with garlic and butter while fianc\u00e9 ordered shrimp only with all the garlic and butter and coconut curry. We also check-in on Yelp to receive free cajun fries, a bowl of rice, garlic pasta and oysters for appetizers.    \n\nOyster came out first and they were decent. The seafood comes in metal bowls and they give you empty bowls to put the shells which is nice so you don't a mess make everywhere. It took awhile to peel the seafood because it was scorching hot, but we were hungry so we fought through the heat to peel them. My fianc\u00e9s' one pound shrimp had about 10-12 shrimps in there and I had 6-7 shrimps and 9 crawfish. We managed to eat everything in sight and was pretty satisfied and full. \n\nOverall, I have a bias because I compare all seafood places to Boiling Crab and this restaurant is decent, but not as good as boiling crab. I personally don't like curry sauce in my seafood so that's why they lost a star for me and as the prices for boiling crab is cheaper than Swamp. Service was excellent and I would go back if my fianc\u00e9 wants to go.", "author": "Christina N."}

So good I had dinner here twice in a span of four days (and no, I'm not ashamed).\n\nMy typical order: pound of shrimp, mild, hurricane sauce, and one cob of corn. YUM. If you're still feeling famished, throw in an order of sausage as well. The hurricane sauce is SO friggin good. My friends and I think it is tomato based. Who knew a sauce that wasn't loaded with sticks of butter would still be delicious? Not me, no siree bob. And dinner would be incomplete without some sides. We checked in on Yelp and got an order of cajun fries on the house. Crispy, crunchy fries, with a bit of a punch--so good. Even better cause they were free. Also yummy were the deviled wings, alligator sausage (highly recommended if you are a fan of Spam haha), garlic noodles, and of course some french bread to sop up that decadent sauce. \n\nThe owners are really nice too. They like to come around and make sure everything is dandy. Great service, yummy food. Swamp's where I'll be when I'm in the city and too lazy to drive to Boiling Crab.", "author": "Audrey T."}

I had the gumbo with rice with lots of hot sauce (I love spicy food) - it filled me up and was tasty. My friends had the shrimp (1 lb. on the mild side, and 2 lbs. with butter and garlic). Both were scrumptious. The atmosphere is laid back, and the staff was very attentive, friendly and humorous. Overall, it had a family homey feel which I liked.

My friends are fans of seafood, especially crabs so we decided to try the place. Unfortunately, i didn't get any since I'm no seafood person but instead ordered a Five Spice Chicken w/ Garlic Noodles. I actually came out full from finishing so it was worth my dollars at least. The noodles were my favorite and the chicken was alright. My friends said the crab was tasty and went well with the sauce. The crab came in a large bowl. As you eat, you toss away the shells in another bowl that they provide you with you. The crab was no doubt pricey because of the seasons. \n\nService was good. The server we chatted with was awesome.

They're always friendly, attentive and the \"scraps\" pile of the shrimp and clam shell bowl is always emptied.\n\nMy go-to order there is usually 2 lbs of shrimp in hurricane mild, 1lb of clams in hurricane mild, 2 garlic noodles, 2 corn and FREE Cajun Fries (via the Yelp Check-in). I love how the clams are always huge and all of them are open. I hate it when I go to restaurants and half of the clams aren't cooked. The shrimp has always been big and not overcooked. \n\nThe Hurricane sauce that combines all of the sauces together creates a distinct sauce that separates them from Boiling Crab's Whole Sha-Bang. Perhaps its the addition of herbs and spices plus the coconut curry? I think I may like Swamp's sauce the best out of all of the Cajun food places (boiling crab, craw station, kicking crab).\n\nMy Mom and my favorite item has to be the GARLIC NOODLES!!!

Felt punished for ordering too many  fried foods!\ncrawfish beignets....Lacked flavor and not sure if they were supposed to be crispy or not.  They were not  and much too gummy and bready.\nchicken wings.......comical. 6 miniature size 2nd portion only  wing part slathered in ????sauce. $1.00 per part.  Definitely not spicy. We get the 2nd portion only in many Asian restaurants. When we finally requested that they throw in a drummette or 2 we were told that is the way they come in the bag. No choice.  Cheap chicken meat!  Some other restaurant gets the bag of drummettes I am sure for a higher price.\nAll of our dishes came out one at a time so, we were eating cole slaw with nothing else. Raw oysters arrived at the end. Calamari was hard on the outside and rubbery on the inside.\n\nI really feel bad writing bad reviews, but I do not want anyone going with too high expectations and being very disappointed.

Why are all these Louisiana seafood boil restaurants here in the Bay Area opened by Asian people? I'm always a little perplexed by that. They must have a lot of  Cajun culinary talent!\n\nStarted off with a dozen of Kusshi, Washington oysters to share. They were fresh and meaty, but didn't have a lot of flavor. I usually enjoy oysters that are sweet and briny. It came with one slice of lime which was weird because I think oysters should be served with an abundance of lemons. There were 3 of us and we went with two orders of the 2 item combo, the first combo with clams and mussel, and the 2nd with crawfish and shrimp, in the hurricane boil (all the flavors in one - Original cajun, Garlic Butter, and Coconut Curry), medium spicy and threw in 3 corns, $14/pound. The hurricane boil flavor is definitely recommended; the sauce is rich from the coconut curry and spices. I loved it. My favorite items from the 4 we ordered are the clams and the shrimp because they were much more rewarding and meatier. The clams were big and plump that night. I have made the decision that I am not a fan of crawfish because for the amount of work you have to put in, the reward is meager. The garlic noodles are delicious and garlicy. I like to pour the hurricane sauce all over it for more flavor! For checking in on Yelp, you get a free side of Cajun fries which was a nice addition because I wanted to add that anyway. I love free!\n\nIt wasn't very busy that night so the service was great! They came around to empty our shell bowls frequently. One big plus about this place is that the food is served in nice metal bowls, we get real plates and utensils instead of paper plates, plastic forks and food served in plastic bags.

We got our fries first, which were actually quite delicious,  spicy and crispy but not greasy.

No, I didn't have the alligator, need to work my way through that menu to it.  Came exactly at 5:55 pm, had 5 minutes to order from their Happy Hour Menu, and so glad I did!  The oysters were so fresh, so next time we have to order at least a dozen!  Only $1 each, what the hey!  Splurge!  It's so great to have someone shuck them and present them, all I do is slurp them.  We had cajun chicken wings.  If my non-spicy friend can eat them, you can too!  We had to order the rest through the main menu since groupon does not cover Happy Hour items.  We had the 2 combinations with Hurricane sauce:  Mussels and crawfish.  Skip the crawfish next time, not much meat.  Stick with the shrimp.  Service was great, ask and you will receive.  Love having the bib, just because the messy person inside me always wants to come out.  The crawfish beignet was nice and savory.  There's more crawfish there then in our combination and less work.  It reminds me of a donut with savory crawfish inside.  The garlic noodle was the last to come out and we were waiting for a long time to go with the \"mild\" spicy Hurricane. The \"mild\" really need something to go with it.  The garlic noodle had at least half a stick of butter?  (That is just a guess).  I can keep on eating that garlic noodle, but had to stop since I was really full from so much food.  They do have a set meal for $59 with clam chowder soup and probably everything we had.  I had to take home the sauce, no sense to waste such yummy sauce.", "author": "Helen L."}

I ordered a pound of clams and there was an abundance of them in it. it sure was swimming in a swamp of sauce, love it! the clams were fresh and made just right. a 12 of raw oysters were also ordered.  I know when oysters are good, oysters are good when they are shucked fresh and put on the tray right away, not pre shucked oysters and bathed in water until serving time. these are shucked then and there at order!

Take it from a New Orleanian, this place offers nothing like we've got down south. \n\nFirst off, the prices are outrageous for the quality of food and the amount of food you receive. I called my mom to tell her the price per pound of crawfish here--- $14.50. Are you kidding me?! My mother's statement explains it all \"...you've got to be kidding me! That's highway robbery!\" Truth, mom, truth. (And I get it, of course crawfish will be more expensive here....but $14.50 per pound is outrageous--FYI back home it's $1.50/lb) \n\nI could go on forever really. Nothing served was authentic. The gumbo tasted like rice with gravy--any yelpers who enjoyed the same gumbo I received have clearly never tasted authentic gumbo. The \"fried catfish\" looked more like fish n' chips from an Irish pub. Even I can make yummier fried catfish than the Swamp; this coming from a girl who can't even properly make Kraft mac and cheese. \n\nThe experience overall was pretty pathetic. Oh and since when is boiled crawfish served in a soup? Never. Since when does crawfish not include your corn and potatoes? Unheard of. \n\nAnd last, but not least, the service was awful. I think we waited for about 15 minutes for anyone to even ask us what we wanted to drink. \n\nThis place is not Cajun.

Came here two weeks ago for lunch on a Tuesday, it wasn't busy so that was good. We ordered:\n\n-Seafood boil with corn and Hurricane Sauce (this is the mix of all their sauces) /definitely has the most tastiness and kick\n-Garlic Noodles / tasted like those from Thanh Long or PPQ (seems like garlic noodles are a SF asian seafood restaurant staple). Was even better when you added Hurricane sauce to it!\n-Hush Puppies / small, crisp with just enough cake moistness in the middle to balance the fried outside. can't stand too big hush puppies where you run out of crunch...\n-Whole Dungeness Crab with the garlic sauce / Crab was good sized, fed 3 adults generously. Not terribly crazy about garlic sauce, it had a good consistency but I wished it was a bit more buttery tasting. Had enough garlic but was missing something else, IMO. \n-Cajun Fries (free with Yelp check in)\n-Crawdads w/ Hurricane Sauce / Personally, I've never been a fan of crawdads just because I feel like I'm getting jipped. They look big and meaty, but they're really just for sucking and minimal chewing, unless one likes chewing shells. Don't get me wrong, I'll eat 'em if someone puts it in front of me, but its not my first choice of water critter. \n\nEverything was good and tasty. I really enjoyed my meal here and I'd definitely come back when I'm in the area. \n\nPros:\n-Public parking on the back side, entrance on 18th Ave\n-Clean and casual restaurant\n-Give lots of sauce, definitely ask your server for a container to take the leftovers home! The hurricane sauce could definitely be used on a lot of things (eggs, chicken, as a dip..)\n-Good service, friendly, knowledgeable\n-Fresh seafood\n\nCons:\n- Its a bit pricey but it's quality seafood that's well cooked so can't totally ding them on that. \n-Depending on the time of day, parking in this area of SF can be tricky, but on a Tuesday at 12n, lot in the back was open.", "author": "Elizabeth N."}

What we ordered was a pound of mussels in garlic/butter sauce (no-spicy) and pound of shrimp and corn in garlic/butter (no-spicy) and another pound of shrimp with sausages in hurricane sauce (mild). Not being a spicy food eater, I absolutely loved the sweetest shrimp I've had in a long time in garlic butter sauce. The mussels were really tender and falling out of the shell, really delicious. Please use the bib they provide, because this food is MESSY but by the time you crack the head off your first shrimp with your bare hands, there's no going back. By the way, shrimp is the way to go - crawfish is a lot of work for such a tiny bite!\n\nThey serve the seafood bowls (not bags) steaming hot with enough sauce to dip your naked shrimp back into or french bread or whatever. We tried the alligator sausage which was tangy and spicy.\n\nThe servers are new to the job and twice we asked for things and didn't get them (water, garlic noodles) or they asked if we wanted water and then forget. Halfway through our meal the employee asked if we wanted bread and then about 15 min later it showed up. The lady next to us asked how to eat crawfish and the girl said she'd wash her hands and show her, but forgot she said that and never did. I agree with the other review about the constant perky \"Are you OK?\" They're just glad to be busy after the Perilla failure.\n\nWe live so close so we're going to go here instead of Cajun House, just for the proximity and that OH SO DELICIOUS shrimp!!

It tasted like a Philly cheesesteak minus the meat. We ended up staying and decided to give a shot at their entrees. My husband got lobster and ingot the crab legs. The waiter insisted I get some type of flavor on the crab legs because they were not that good without flavor. I got the lemon pepper and really happy I took his advice. The crab legs with the flavor were still not good, edible, but Def the worst crab legs I've ever had. My husband got the lobster and that was decent.

Usually at other Cajun Seafood places, 2-3 appetizers and 1 lb of shrimp comes out to be a very generous portion of food for the both of us. Oh, geez.

The garlic butter sauce was yellow, instead of red - very different from all other Cajun seafood restaurants I've been to. The sauce itself was quite bland, but the butter taste was so overwhelming, I actually felt sick.

The reason I say this is because they're not nearly as generous with their sauces here as they are in other crawfish places. Their flavors here are a little less 'intense' if that makes any sense, but is still very enjoyable. I, myself, love the thicker, richer sauce of other places so I didn't enjoy it as much here. Also, being in San Francisco means San Francisco prices.....certain items here are a couple dollars more per lb than its South Bay counterparts and other items can fetch even more $$$.

They have a check-in freebie for free cajun fries, hence why we picked this place compared to the other cajun seafood place  on Geary. Walked in on a Saturday night around 6:15 and it was EMPTY. I couldn't believe it. We found awesome parking and didn't have to wait! \n\nWhat we got:\n2 lbs shrimp, Hurricane style (The whole shebang), Medium spicy -- Nice BIG shrimps!\n1 lb clams, hurricane style, medium -- Tasty\n2 orders rice -- Have to soak up the juices\n1 order cajun fries (free) -- taste like normal fries with a cajun seasoning dusted on top. Surprisingly hot and crispy\n1 order sweet potato fries -- nice crisp and not soggy! \n1 order fried calamari -- Some places you feel it's 80% fried batter, NOT HERE. Actually very minimal batter.\n\nThe difference of this place and other cajun seafood establishments is they don't serve it to you in a plastic bag. There are plates and utensils on the table, and they bring your food in a pot. They give you an extra bowl for shells and routinely come around and empty the shells as you go.\n\nService was attentive, albeit it was extremely empty on a saturday night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-23", "description": "Although the name doesn't sound too appealing to the ear... the place manages to stick with and keep up with their name as the common theme throughout the restaurant. I like it! When it comes to these types of restaurants I don't expect to sit down and eat in a place that looks fancy. The concept is based on using your hands and not forks, knives, & spoons! (Which they provide though) This restaurant style is popping up all over the Bay Area now and yet some have not managed to keep up with the game, Swamp definitely does! \n\nThe man running the place who I believe to be the owner is very nice. As the evening rolled around to 7-8p the place began to get packed and there were only 2 servers plus the owner himself totaling 3 people who were serving the entire resto. With just them the service began to lag a bit. The bf and I didn't mind bc we were in no rush to be somewhere. They did apologize each time they came to the table for the lag of their service as they too knew they were short staffed. \n\nAs for the food-- We ordered a dozen half shell raw oysters, fried catfish, cajun fries (free with your first time Yelp check-in there), whole dungeness crab in the garlic butter sauce, garlic noodles, and for dessert the fried bananas & vanilla icecream. \n\nThe oysters were fresh and refreshing (wish we ordered more). The fried catfish was battered with a light beer batter and not with your normal flour/cornmeal. The fish wasn't overcooked, it was tender and flaky. The cajun fries were a little on the spicy side. The kick was a little overwhelming where at one point I couldn't feel my lips, bc they were just that much on fire. (BUT! I'm not going to ding them for a tiny error of over seasoned fries.) The dungeness crab in the garlic butter sauce was cooked perfectly. The sauce was off the chain, so creamy/milky. I poured the sauce over my garlic noodles as well! The garlic noodles didn't stick to each other and they were soft and tender. Dessert was splendid. It was the perfect ending to our meal. Not overly sweet! \n\nWill come here again!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-17", "description": "The main dish here came through and my wife is hoping to go back again.  This was my first time going here. \n\nThe service from the waiter (possibly the guy running the place) is deplorable and combative. \n\nFood: We had a prawn and shrimp boil with cajun seasoning. The prawn were undersized, but my wife really liked them as they had good flavor. The shrimp (whole and with veins) was good sized and tasted fresh. The watermelon iced tea was nearly undrinkable. The cajun fries were OK, but not spectacular as it was difficult to taste the seasoning.  If you ask for more ketchup, they'll bring the bottle over and squirt some into the small ketchup dish instead of giving you the bottle. \n\nService: Based on the service within only the first few moments of walking in the door, I was ready to walk out of the door. A few simple correspondences as a guest of the establishment shouldn't get your blood boiling and discomfort level up. For the quick and dirty on the place, you can stop here, if you are interested in knowing what happened, I've outlined the 4 painful experiences below. \n\nUnfortunately tone and volume are not yet transmissible via text, so you will need to imagine a very loud and angry guy who can make people uncomfortable with simple words. There were at least 5-6 witnesses (which is what I believe they should be termed in this type of situation) in the restaurant. \n\n#1 - Taken Aback: Walked in and the place was at about 20% capacity. The guy said \"can I help you\" from all the way across the restaurant which is a strange way to greet people.  Being that it was my first time here, I also walked in with that normal level of social anxiety of not knowing where to sit.  I responded in a joking manner that we're just trying to find a place to sit.  The guy told me that you don't choose, he will seat you himself.  Taken aback, I jested that there should be a sign if that is the case, but he said that they don't need a sign since he just tells people where to sit.... This went on for a demeaning 30-40 seconds. \n\n#2 - The Jab: They give you two menus, one of them has all the main seafood and one has drinks & lunch specials.  Outside the door they have a sign advertising Po-Boy sandwiches, this doesn't appear to be dependent on the time of day.  Not finding the Po-Boy on the regular menu, my wife found it on the lunch special page.  I asked if it is possible to get a poor boy at this time (after the end of lunch specials), the guy told me he could give it to me, but it wouldn't be at the happy hour price. I was fine with this pricing fact.. I guess.. but the way he said it was very rude and condescending. I would think that it's either on the menu or not (especially when it's on the sign outside and plastered in ads on the window). \n\n#3 - On the Ropes: We happened to have a Yelp coupon for free cajun fries.  I'm a scaredy cat, so after #1 & #2, I asked my wife to present the coupon to the guy.  She showed the coupon which still needed a few clicks to complete the transaction.  The guy very curtly said to her to click \"this\" now \"that\" now \"this.\"  I don't recall the commands on the phone, but basically instead of saying, OK, you just need to click through these steps, he elevated everyone's blood pressure in the room by using a high volume to spew the commands at her. Sometimes an economy of words with people can seem so much ruder...\n\n#4 - The Death Blow:  The menu for the seafood boils have prices by the pound.  We ordered a combo shirimp/prawn at about $14/lb, but didn't exactly say how many pounds and the guy didn't ask.  After ordering, and given the awful experience so far, I did start to worry that perhaps the default might be more than a pound, so I asked my wife to confirm with the guy when she walked back from washing her hands.  She asked the guy on her way back, and the guy got very loud and confrontational to explain how the menu works and that if you order the combo, it is simply $14.  She said that she was just worried because we didn't say one way or another and the price is in per pound increments.  The guy said he doesn't need to ask since it just is $14. She explained that it's our first time here so we didn't know how it works.  Disregarding this comment, the guy then \"went over her head\" and came over to me to explain how the menu works.  I told him that we just weren't sure and wanted to make sure and that I was the one who actually had the question.  He failed to grasp the situation and his handling was quite rude - particularly trying to go over my wife's head as though I could somehow explain his specious argument to her (if you've ever ordered something on a menu listed as market price, you know that you had better double check prices first!). \n\nP.S. Luckily he disappeared 20 minutes into our experience, so we were able to let our guard down and try to enjoy our meal on an otherwise nice Friday afternoon.", "author": "Brian L."}

Everything was pretty delicious and I am not sure if it's because the cooks had more time to prepare everything since we were literally the only people in the whole darn restaurant or it was just my lucky day.", "author": "Mona L."}

We ordered a 3lb bowl of crawfish and shrimp in the hurricane sauce and it was to die for. very delicious. I was a little nervous about ordering that much food, but it honestly wasn't that much given that it is shellfish after all. most of the weight is the shell. With that said, I finished the food and felt satisfied -- not stuffed, which was perfect. and that hurricane sauce was the bomb!! \n\nin addition to our boil, we also ordered a side of cajun fries with was delish as well.

But I guess they just aren't honest about it.\n\n[-] Shrimp ($12/lb) - It was either old, or left outside for too long. It had a smell to it. Like it's very old. We couldn't even eat it bc it just smells awful. It wasn't the sauce. It was the actual shrimp meat. You can just tell it wasn't fresh and it might have expired, or been left out too long.\n\n[-] We ordered the clam chower, but server totally forgot it. \n\n\nDid I mention I had a stomachache during the night?

I wasn't expecting this place to be great, but it was pretty good.\n \n* 1 dozen Kusshi on the half shell $18 (4 of 5) Fat and creamy raw oysters served with lemon, cocktail sauce, and horseradish. The oysters were fresh and very good size. Delicious for $18.\n* Sweet Potato Fries $4.50 (5 of 5) Fabulous. Looked like long cork screws and they tasted so good. Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. It was a really really really really good yam fry. Yummy!\n* Cajun Fries $3.50 or FREE with yelp check-in. (4.5 of 5) Pretty good and even better when it was free. The fries were good wedge sizes but surprising the Cajun flavoring was outstanding. The Cajun powder wasn't too salty and it had a good heat hint at the end. It was really really really good. But the yam fries taste just a little better. \n* Deviled Wings (6) $6 (3.5 of 5) Not too spicy even though they are called deviled wings. But they are super fat wings. \n* Grilled Alligator Sausage $6 (2.5 of 5) Very excited to taste this. It was one sausage sliced in half and grilled. It was a little fishy. But tasted better when we sprinkled lemon juice on top of it. Then it tasted like a better chicken sausage. This is definitely a pass when I go back a second time.\n* Fried Calamari $8 (3 of 5) Not bad but not great.\n* Fried Oysters $8 (5 of 5) Great batter and great size. The fried oysters were still moist and juicy in the middle. I would re-order and re-order. Yummy!\n* Fried Fish Fillet $8 (3.5 of 5) Tasted like really good and crispy fish fillet (like McDonald's). Again great frying and great batter choice. \n* Garlic Noodle $7 (4.5 of 5) I think this is one of my preferred garlic noodles now. It was great noodle choice because it was soft and chewy. I really liked the portion and the overall taste and texture. If I can't eat Than Long's garlic noodle, this would be my next go to place.\n* Garlic Butter Crab $30/each (4 of 5) Tasty. Very nice sauce. And exactly what it is named, garlic + butter. Tasted extra good when we poured the sauce over the garlic noodle. Delicious.\n* Hurricane Shrimp and corn and sausage $12/lb + 0.75each + $2.50 (6 pieces) (4.5 of 5) Hurricane is supposedly a mix of all flavors. I liked it, especially with rice or the French Bread. It was pretty good.  \n* Soda $2.50 free refill\n* Pitcher of Beer $16\n\nThis place was great for our group of ten. They were nice and accommodating. All the items very fairly tasty.

Instead they bring out piping hot shellfish in large shiny white bowls that really make the beautiful colors of the sauce stand out, not to mention you don't get sauce all over your wrists and forearms when the food starts running low.\n\nThe calamari, was just good not too fishy but nothing great\n\nGarlic noodles, were great soft and chewy and go great with the sauce from the shellfish\n\n2Lbs of hurricane clams with potato and corn, wonderful again except for that hint of sweetness I was getting but again there were other elements of flavor other then garlic so it wasn't bothersome.\nThe clams were fresh, fat and juicy, the corn soaks up all that wonderful sauce and keeps heat so beware when you first bite in! The potatoes are great when cut up and also soak up the sauce.\n\n1Lb of King crab with the habanero sauce, were good, I didn't have many intact legs and got a lot \"knuckles\" instead and no claws so there wasn't as much meat as I usually expect from King crab.

Around 6:15, I kept calling the waitress for our check, at least 3 times and she said ok but she didn't bring our check out until 6:30. She was standing there the whole time and doing nothing.", "author": "Polly L."}

This place reminds me of Boiling Crab minus the long wait and the plastic bags they serve the seafood in. I went with a group totaling 13 people. \n\nTo start things off, the owners and servers were extremely friendly. They had a few beers on Tap I had the Hennepin which was good. There was a yelp check-in offer where you receive an order of Cajun fries when you check-in. About 4 of us took advantage of it and Swamp accomodated the offer. The Cajun fries were good and had spice.\n\nA few of us grouped together and ordered a few things. We ordered Crab, Shrimp, Gumbo, Etoufee & Aligator Sausage. ALL DISHES WERE EXCELLENT! A few of us in the group preferred mild seasoning and their mild was actually pretty spicy. Although it was spicy, it was still good! On paper the Alligator sausage sounds exotic, but tasted like a regular sausage. They could have easily served us regular sausage and said that it was Alligator.\n\nOverall, I would definitely go back for the food. I would also definitely go back for the extremely friendly and funny staff & owner.", "author": "Richard B. F."}

The crab legs aren't a great deal, and the crawfish aren't very large, but man was everything spicy.

The way they served the crab legs made it extremely difficult and aggravating to eat. They cut the legs down the shell and off of the joints of the crab. Typically one would use this breaking point to remove the clear plasticy part that comes out of the meat but this was nearly impossible to do with how slippery the meal was and how it was cut.

Exactly one month later I dragged a friend with me to give Swamp another try.  They've read the reviews and have definitely done some fixes.  The restaurant was nice and toasty upon entering and the staff was very attentive throughout the meal and that's with at least 7 other tables they were waiting on, also the hurricane boil for our crab was less saltier and more flavorful.  The shrimp is still my favorite as i can tear through 1 pound quick!  This 2nd return visit replaces my 1st so-so visit so there will likely be a 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc....\n\nOn 11/19/12, we ended up here after the owner/manager of Cajun SF stole our parking and we decided to ditch that place for this one but that's another story.  So here is the review for Swamp:\n\nI know people have mentioned it's like the Boiling Crab type of places.  In overall concept it is except for one thing - food DOES NOT come in a bag!  It comes in a bowl and you better eat it fast because compared to coming out in a bag, it will cool down faster than you can eat it!  By the time you reach the last few pieces in your bowl you will be lucky if the sauce temp is luke warm.  Now what did we order?  1lb shrimp (Garlic Butter - Medium), Garlic Noodles and 1 crab (hurricane style - medium).  Overall, it's ok, nothing spectacular, perhaps i am simply used to the crab in the bag thing and flavoring so that it's no longer a novelty to me.  Not to mention they're cropping up more and more.  Anyone notice the old Cable Car Pizza/Hookah Lounge is now going to be something called Rockin' Crawfish?   \n\nThe food is ok, the crab wasn't the meatiest and the hurricane flavoring was too salty for my taste.  But the shrimp were pretty meaty and with spicy garlic butter pretty yummy but then I'm not surprised that they do garlic butter well.  After all the people running this place are related to the folks a few blocks away at PPQ!  Who...if you can keep following me....ran/run Perilla (also on Irving) which was replaced by Swamp!  \n\nService?  They're working out the kinks.  Like all new restaurants, they'll get it down.  They were attentive but tentative and tried to be helpful.  \n\nA the end of the meal?  A bill total of $80, including tip, for two people, had me expecting a little more as far as food quality and left me feeling like I overpaid big time!  Of course had we not ordered the crab and just ordered another pound of shrimp, the bill would have been a lot less but then where is the fun in that?  Must have crab!\n\nPS - If you go to my post about the old Perilla that was replaced by Swamp, I have a mention about the waiter who does not write orders down.  He's still here at this place!", "author": "Amorette K."}

The alligator sausage came after and it was grilled. The taste was badically like eating chicken. Nothing special. Our shrimp and mussels finally came out, and to my dumbness, went straight for the shrimp's head and it burned my tongue. Dumb move, i know. I thought the spicy habenero hurricane sauce would've killed me but it didn't. It seemed like it was just a mild sauce. But on the other hand, the corn that was in the hurricane sauce was definitely the spicy one. Weird. The shrimp in the garlic butter had to be my favorite. How I ate them was that I would peel the shrimps first, then pur them back into the garlic butter sauce and let them sit there for a minute or two to have a coat of the sauce. It's the same as dipping the shrimp, I know. But people have different techniques.\n\nOverall, I's say it was pretty good. It was just the service in the beginning that got to me.

I have ordered the crab, clams, mussels, shrimp, and they were all good. Their garlic noodles were the best I ever had even better than thanh long and I usually order one just for myself(It goes great with their sauces). They have the $49 set menu that gives you a fresh crab(not frozen), clam chowder, cole slaw, and beignets(perfect sweetness, light, fluffy. There are TV's around to watch your favorite sports teams, good selection of beers on tap at the bar and pitchers to go along with it, the place seats around 40+ people. If you check-in on yelp you get free cajun fries which is a good starter while you decide what you want to order. Bill the manager here is the man, I've come 5-6 times and he knows me, he hooked it up on my birthday meal here and usually throws in some beignets for me and my friends on a regular. I've suggested to Bill to make their sauces thicker and they have since made that a regular thing, they added more ingredients to thicken the sauce and give it more flavor. There's really no other Cajun establishment that competes with the flavors of this place in the city in my opinion, red crawfish is good but I like this place more.

Okay they are busy I understand. But ticked me off the most is how our dinner ended. My bf asked for a to go cup for a soda refill ( we had no problem with this the other times we have been here) the waitress told the older guy there to get that since he was working the bar. Suddenly not only did he give the poor girl a lecture saying that they don't do that but he came over to our table to give us a lecture on how can he make money if he gave to go cups and free refills are only in house. UMMM what? We just spend over $80 on your damn food and a refill that costs you maybe 50 cents is a problem and you are giving us a lecture about it? What is the difference if we stayed the extra 5 minutest to drink out of the glass and not to go? Completely unnecessary and uncalled for lecture to your customers. What would you rather have? Spend 50 cents of one refill of lose $80 because we are not coming back here ever again?

The oysters were fresh, the crab was a decent size and the shrimp were huge.  We had the crab & shrimp in the butter & garlic sauce and it was definitely finger licking good.  We also had the garlic noodles, which was good but tasted even better if you pour some of the butter & garlic sauce over it.  \nWe finished off our meal with their beignets.  I was hesitant to order it because no one makes it like Cafe du Monde.  The owner swore that it tasted just as good, so i had to try it.  The end result was it was good, close to Cafe du Monde's version but not 100%.  The downfall on that is the beignets could be a little lighter.  Overall my experience here was so good that i ended up coming back a week later and brought 4 other people with me to try it.  Each and every one of them loved it.  \nOh and I have to mention that our server was nice but the service in the kitchen is a bit slow.", "author": "Rose C."}

On the website, daily special they have lobster and crab @ $35.00 each. So I called and ordered for pickup. When I there to pickup, the older gentleman charged me $38.00 !! I asked him about the price on the website. He said that's not true. I open the page on my phone and showed him. He didn't even look at my phone and said to me. Don't come back if you like the price. We don't even take phone order or take out, I do you a favor to let you take out. You should not complain. Wow, on the website does not mention about NO TAKE OUT or  DON'T TAKE PHONE ORDERS! I told him it's not about $3.00 charge over the crab. it's about his attitude when he talked to me. I wanted to cancel the order, he said not because the kitchen already cooked the crab. \n\nMessage to the owner. Take down your website if it's not yours.

Tasty food - we ordered the hurricane shrimp, garlic butter crab, garlic noodles, clams and raw oysters. Love all of it! All were cooked very nicely, not over cooked. When I eat here it feels more home-y than other restaurants. When I come here I actually feel like I'm having a family dinner rather than being rushed out. This isn't boiling crab so PUH-LEASE don't complain it doesn't taste like it!!! The server (he told us his name is Bill but I don't know if that's his real name) is such a jokester and really made his best efforts in serving us. He makes the trip out here extra fun! The last time we went he brought out a birthday beignet for my mom enough for the whole party to share - bonus points for that. Went twice for birthdays in a month.

My good friend was craving Boiling Crab, but we didn't have the time or the patience to drive down to San Jose.  In lieu of a day trip, we thought we'd try out this local joint.  It was a wonderful experience - the staff were good-natured, had an excellent sense of humor, and prompt in their service.  Food was quite good.  We played it safe and each got a pound of shrimp: one pound of lemon pepper, and one pound of the Hurricane original flavor.  Both shrimps were absolutely delicious.  They were so fresh that we nearly burnt our fingers, and I was actually quite pleased that they were not served to us in a bag.  I hate having to reach into a nasty, oily plastic bag to get my arms dirty.  We also got a side of green beans, which was flavorful, and we happily chomped on in-between bites of shrimp.

First time, I ordered shrimp with hurricane sauce, added sausage and corn on the Cobb. It was so spicy I couldn't enjoy it, just felt burning spice all over my lips and throat. However, the Cajun fries and the French bread dipped in the sauce were delicious. Second and third times coming here I ordered shrimp with garlic butter sauce, no spice. It was the best!! It actually reminded me of Giovanni's shrimp truck in Oahu. All shrimp is served head on, she'll on so as you can imagine it's super messy ( which is why you get a bib and wet naps.) the garlic butter sauce is delicious. On our last time coming here we tried the chicken wing and hush puppy appetizers, which I didn't care for. The Asian man working here was very entertaining and made is laugh the whole time.

I drank it too fast because it was so good! We also ordered 1 lb. of shrimp with their signature hurricane sauce with medium spice and added additional corn and hot links in there, let me tell you, AMAZING! You gotta suck the juices from the shrimp head , and after peeling dip it back into the sauce for the best flavor! Lastly ordered 1 lb. of the king crab legs for $29. Not too bad. We had to get the garlic butter sauce for the crab of course! No mistakes here! It was to die for! They perfectly pre- cut the crab legs for you but also bring you some shell crackers just in case you need them! Again, once you take the meat out, dip it back into that sauce!

The food here was absolutely atrocious. I don't usually complain but reluctantly told the waitress that I couldn't stomach my crawfish after she noticed that I'd only eaten a couple of bites. The manager stopped by and rudely informed me that I simply didn't understand Cajun food. Little did he know that I've been to New Orleans several times and used to live in Pensacola and San Antonio, two other southern cities which have excellent Cajun food. We had a couple other side dishes and everything was awful. It seems like a tourist spot which falsely boasts Cajun food even though there didn't appear to be any Cajun chef.

Unfortunately that's all Swamp has got going for it. The price is steep even for SF prices - $14/lb of shrimp? I think their 2-choice shellfish combo is a nice option for some variety. The spiciness difference between the mild and medium was pretty negligible so go ahead and spice it up to your hearts content. The shrimp and mussels tasted fresh so I can't complain. Cat fish fillets didn't taste like catfish, just deep fried fish; wouldn't recommend it.

It wasn't busy at all there were about 3 other tables occupied 2 tables with just 2 people and 1 table with 3 people. What I don't understand is the service. It took them 15 minutes to serve us and then another 15 minutes for the fries to come out and then another 15 minutes for them to take our actual order. We ordered another batch of fries and it took 30 minutes for that to come out but with me telling the server that I am still waiting on my fries. It took 45 minutes over all for the actual food to come out while other people that just started coming in got served fast. I've been here a couple times already and it seems like they judge you on how you look if they think you won't be ordering that much because I came in with my niece and they took forever. My other sisters came and we ordered more but this is ridiculous they literally ignored us and took forever with the food! It wasn't even busy. I got the garlic noodle with crawfish and the crawfish was completely dry I think I'll just stick to the plain garlic noodle. Food is good just the service was horrible. Very rude to me and my family. Our bill came out to be almost $200 while the other people that just came went there for happy hour but they had good service while we had none. Don't think me and my family will be going back here for awhile. We even asked for a lobster to go before we finished and it took them 50 minutes!

Whooo! As a fan of the fabled Boiling Crab, we've gone to several restaurants in the city of mediocre sauce or seafood. We have drove pass Swamp several times and I have been curious to try it. Upon arrival at the restaurant, I was quite surprised that it was not the typical generic boiling crab decorations with the wooden pillars and fish nets. Instead, there was a stand with an assortment of seafood laid out for decoration near the entrance, Marci gras mask and beads amidst red walls. In the back of the restaurant, there is  a mini bar.  \n\nWe ordered the kusshi/washington oysters for $18 and those were fresh and briny. \n  \nThere were four flavors : original cajun, garlic butter, lemon butter, and hurricane (the combination of everything) in either no spice, mild, medium, and spicy habanero. My rule of thumb is to always choose the second to spiciest as I usually can take most spices. Next, we choose however much pound of seafood amongst shrimp, mussels, clams, crawfish, and so on. Crawfishes and shrimps are about 12 dollars a pound. I ordered a pound of medium crawfish in the hurricane flavor with a corn thrown in. If you check-in, you get a free side of cajun fries. They were pretty fresh and crispy fries. Once the order came, the crawfishes were very fresh and succulent. Sizes range from small to medium. I would not suggest getting the corn. It was a sweet corn that was not absorbing the sauce what so ever. The sauce itself was pretty spicy as I was continuously reaching for my cup of water. The consistency of the sauce was thin compared to boiling crab, but sweet which reminded me of chinese curry. I suggest ordering a side of baquette. The baquette is also fresh and perfect for dipping. Yum! I have not been this satisfied with my Louisiana crawfish craving in a long time.  \n \nThe service was great! Our waiter made us feel comfortable with asking him for condiments and such. He was extremely nice.  \n\nI am sold, I am coming back pretty soon!", "author": "Becky Q."}

WTF? We told her we were walking home (not that it's any of her business). I could see it if we were acting really intoxicated but we weren't! She better never go to New Orleans if she was shocked by our 2-3 drinks each alcohol consumption.

At first, I was afraid that there would be a wait since it was a weekend. But when my friends and I arrived, there were quite a few tables and booths available, so we were seated right away. We ordered oysters, shrimp, crab legs, rice, garlic noodles, and sweet potatoe fries. The service was quick, we got our whole order at the same time. It was great that that the shrimp and crab legs came in bowls rather than in plastic bags. And the best part was that the crab legs were already split in the middle, making it easier to break open and get the whole crab meat. I'm so bad at cracking those things open, so this was SUPER convenient for me. That alone would make me come back. The total came out to around $100, which wasn't bad to me.

I came with a friend... not expecting much since the city doesn't have much to offer compared to places in San Jose. BUT OMG! It may not be as good as boiling crab or other places, but it's definitely, in my opinion, the best place so far in San Francisco. Assuming that everything stays the same and the seafood stays fresh, then I won't have to be making my long journeys to San Jose anymore... or as much at least! And guess what!??!! They offer UNLIMITED soda refills!!!! Unlike other Cajun places in the city, they give you just can soda which you have to pay for each one. Being a soda lover myself, I love that it's free refills here!\n\nOkay, onto the food! Ordered 1lb of crawfish, mild hurricane. Nice little kick but very flavorful. Some of the crawfish were tiny though, while some was average sized. I guess it's not their fault, they should consider another vendor of crawfish though. Ordered 2lbs of shrimp, mild hurricane again. Again, very flavorful. Eat it fast because near the end, I guess we let the shrimp soak too long in the sauce (which is pretty hot) so it overcooked the shrimp... so it became chewy in the end. The only sad thing was that they didn't give limes and salt/pepper for you to squeeze and dip into. I'm not sure if it's going to be like that forever or if it's just now... but I hope they consider offering that. Cajun fries was free with checkin on yelp, so woot woot (free.... they just know how to draw me in). Nice and hot, and tasty. The only thing I didn't care too much for during the meal was the garlic noodles. The noodles were like they left it out too long so they all were stuck to each other... also needed more of that garlic flavor or whatever they need to make it taste like garlic noodles. \n\nService was excellent, always brought us more napkins, checked on us a few times, and the guy kept refilling my water without me having to ask (then again, it wasn't too busy... so I don't know how they would do if it were busy though). Place is pretty clean and the restrooms seem pretty well maintained. Oh, and they don't serve their food out of plastic bags! At first it didn't seem the same... but I guess it's better since you don't know what kind of chemicals may be leeching from the plastic into your food!

I can't be one to say whether it's traditional or not, but we did bring my brother-in-law who was born and raised on the outskirts of Battonrouge and he had nothing but high praises regarding flavor and variety of options of cooking the dishes so that must say something. Anyways, you can't go wrong trying anything from the appetizer selection such as the hush puppies to alligator sausage to the main specialty of crab, mussels or oysters. It was all great. But whatever you get, you must order the garlic noodles to accompany it. It is a definite must have. Ambience is great with tv screens and the noise level being at a medium. Finally, is the service. Top notch waitresses and waiter giving their undivided attention to the clientele to make sure everyone is happy. Most specifically, Bill.

To start, the oysters were so-so but the cajun fries were perfectly seasoned. The garlic noodles were decent but not spectacular. I was excited to try the alligator sausages. They were delicious but did not taste any different than a well-made pork sausage.\nNow to the seafood. The dungeness crab was probably about 2 lbs and tasted very fresh. It might have been my favorite part of the meal. The shrimp were big and tasted pretty fresh as well. We ordered the crawfish because that was what they were known for. That was a disappointment, however. The crawfish were definitely NOT FRESH and were very small. There was barely much to eat after taking the head and shell off. In half of the crawfish I ate, the meat was falling apart and not chewy, telltale signs that they have been sitting around in the back for a while.\nI will only come back for the dungeness crab and the shrimp, but I think there are better options in the Bay Area.

These promotions and free stuff should not cost a lot, and it can be made up by margin from returned customers.  Look at shabuway as a prime example.  They try to match up everything with their competitor, and then on top they throw in free refill on vegetables, and free green tea cream brulee.  It won many competitor customers over and returned.  I am throwing in these suggestions because I really like their services and like to help on new business.", "author": "Alex D."}

I have had wings at other places that were much larger.  \n\nThe shrimp was good size , two prices of potatoes for $1.00. 6 pieces of sausage for 2.50 and a half of corn for .75cents.   So $17 for the shrimp, potatoes, sausage and corn. The hurricane sauce was good.\n\nI would not order the fried fish or wings again sine is was ok.", "author": "Frances L."}

I did not like their flavoring, as it seemed overly sinus clearing from their habanero flavoring.  I guess since I'm critiquing the flavor, it really depends on each person's palette.  The service was attentive, the decor was nice and not as cluttered as others  who share their business model, and the seafood for the most part seemed fresh, save a few shrimp (but those could have been fresh but overcooked in the bowl - maybe).

So I wanted seafood and decided to come in wit the BF. He's a professional cook and has been for over 8 years now. And I have been a chef and cook in high end Michelin star kitchens. Saying that, I want everyone to know that we know what we're taking about. It's basic shit, Anyways, ordered the shrimp n mussel combo. Shrimp we're good, but the mussels were in the older side. Not \"bad\" yet, but close to. Shrimp were good though. Got the free check in fries. Spicy, but nothing to complain about. And then our king crab legs came. I took a bit and already had garlic noodles in my mouth so when I swallowed I had this odd taste in my mouth. I took another small bite of just crab alone and spit it out. Grabbed another from our bowl, opened the shell, and put my nose in it. To my disgust, it smelled like straight bleach. Burned the freak at of my nose. I let my bf smell it and the pure look of \"wtf omg\" on his face made my stomach sink knowing that I already swallowed a bit of rotten ammonia crab. I mean like this wasn't even SLIGHTY off. This crab was bad days ago!!!!! How the shit do you do that!????? No idea. So I told the waitress. She apologized and took it back to get me a fresh one. Then came back with some stupid bullshit answer of her saying that the cooks said it smelled like that cause it probably wasn't cooked all the way. I just sat silent thinking, if this girl knew who we were she wouldn't dare give some excuse so stupid that would try to OK rotten seafood. Moving on, they comped the garlic noodles. Big whoop. The whole damn meal should have been comped. Right after we ate, I ran across the street to walgreens to get pepto bismol and other stomach relaxers in case I would fall ill from my bite, but luckily all I experienced was some odd stomach cramps that kept me from sleeping that night. But I'll take that over being flat out glued to the toilet and having to go to the hospital!!! I would never go back. And I'll never let any friends or family try this place. That's just scary.

It was pretty mild to me but I'm thai so I guess my spicy tolerance is just too high. Even though it was spicy every tasted awesome.

We live close by so had been curious about this new place.\n\nFood's pretty decent.

Too much work for too little meat, IMO.  If we would go there again I think we would get the shrimp.\n\nWe got the hurricane, habanero boil.  Good flavor and nice broth to dip the hushpuppies in.\n\nThe fries, as mentioned in another review, were uninspiring. Pretty mediocre actually.\n\nHushpuppies were OK.  They came with this honey butter stuff that was pretty solidified in the ramekin.  I just dipped them in the ketchup and boil/broth and they were pretty good that way.\n\nIf I go there again I will order shrimp or mussels, some french bread to dip in the broth, and maybe try the alligator sausage.  \n\nService was friendly and prompt.

My family and I ordered gumbo, cajun fries, garlic noodles, and shrimp with the hurricane sauce. Everything came out relatively quick. Cajun fries were good, wasn't too salty. Gumbo was alright, it seemed to lack more flavor. Shrimp and hurricane sauce was okay. The sauce has a water like consistency but the shrimp were huge! The sauce I believe is a mixtures of garlic butter and lemon pepper, did not really wow me. My favorite dish was the garlic noodles. I felt that the noodles had the right amount of garlic flavor and more importantly, not oily. Customer service was good, they kept refilling our waters, asked how our food was, and asked if we needed anything else.

The only bright side was a nice looking Romanian waitress that alone deserves the one star that I'm giving to this poor tasting establishment. The questionable alligator sausage was OK and tasted like pork. The cook recommended us to try the French bread which felt like it was bought from Safeway and well it was definitely toasted.

Each course showed a lot of effort, and could have stood on its own.  The crab was perfectly cooked, very fresh and not overdone, and the sauce was amazing, very French.  It was perfect over the garlic noodles.  Cole slaw was creamy, crisp, really good, and the clam chowder had lots of clams, and potatoes that were tender but still in chunks.
