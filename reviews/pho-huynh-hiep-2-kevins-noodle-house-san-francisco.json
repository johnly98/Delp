I always go here for their meatball with thin slices of steak pho and every time I go here, it's always good! It's good that they're consistent. I love how you can choose what size pho bowl you want, unlike most pho places nearby. The small bowl for my order is $9.50, but a large is $11.25 so the price for pho here is a good price. Something about the broth they make is why this is my favorite.\n\nI've also tried their deep fried Vietnamese egg rolls and it's very good! It comes with a sauce to dip it in. \n\nI heard the dessert drinks here are good, but I haven't tried it yet. My friend tried the three bean dessert drink here and she like it a lot. It contained green jelly, mung beans, red beans, shaved ice, and something that my friend said tasted like coconut milk.\n\nI'd recommend this place! It's a great place to get pho for a good price and they have a big variety of food if you're not in the mood for pho!", "author": "Elaine N."}

A large will fill you up and then some though the prices are slightly pricier than what you would usually pay for pho. \n\nSo there you go, Kevin's Noodle House is quite reliable for pho and despite the long lines and what not, it moves by pretty quickly.

Kevin's Noodle House has a great website that you can check out if you want to look at their menu beforehand. Service is quick and within 10 minutes of ordering, I got my bowl of pho and a shared plate of the usual add-ins (lemon wedges, chili pepper slices, basil leaves?, and bean sprouts). The broth was flavorful and the portions were standard. The only semi-complaint that I have is that I got one jumbo slice of beef tripe which I thought was hilarious but ended up taking me a bit of time to chew apart.

This place had amazing turn out. While we were waiting, this place was packed full of patrons walking  in and out. We were told to check out this place. When we entered the establishment we knew we wanted to get pho.  So the decision was very simple.  Basic pho serving several different  sizes to appease hungry goers. Oh  my they  were so quick!  after taking our order, in less than 10 minutes there were three bowls coming out. Hot steaming broth of pho offering 3 different sizes.  I had the large bowl my daughter had the medium size and my son had the child size small. We had two beef orders and my daughter had the chicken bowl.\nThe broth was a delight of subtle flavors of saltiness from fish sauce, onions and aniseed. Absolutely fantastic tasting with very fresh condiments for our toppings of Basils, mounds of cilantros, bean sprouts, green jalapeno slices and fresh lime wedges.\nWe left the establishment feeling refreshed and ready to go sightseeing.\nLooking forward for our return  to try out other dishes.\nWe are definitely coming back here again when we are back in the Bay Area!", "author": "Cecilia L."}

Consistent food quality, large portions for the price, fast and efficient service... no frills no fancy treatment, just order your food, enjoy, pay & dip. Kevin's is pretty popular and if you ever come here, you know it because it always has customers no matter what time of day or night. All in all, I only have good things to say about this place. \nI came here an hour ago and was seated right away by the young gentleman. The prices have gone up so it's now $9.00 for a #1. I normally order #1 because it's the bang for your buck: large bowl of pho for a cheap price with a lot of variety in it. This time however I felt like trying the #2 medium which is similar to #1 but #2 has beef balls. ($9.25 for a #2 medium) The food came out quickly! Came with 6 beef balls. Broth was flavorful..just like how I remember it! Noodles were on the chewier side but I didn't mind it. I finished my bowl of pho, paid, and left. My meal was about 30 min overall. And right away my seats were taken by one of the three parties waiting and standing by the door. \nKevin's doesn't mess around when it comes to serving customers quickly and efficiently. Food quality is good, yummy enough to have locals like me coming back for YEARS. Stay you Kevin's, stay true.", "author": "Debby N."}

The fresh spring rolls aren't my favorite. They pre-make them, and I think they sit for a while in the fridge. Because of this, they tend to be very closely adhered to each other when they come out, making it hard to separate and share them. \n\nOverall my favorite pho spot in SF.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-22", "description": "When I think about great pho places in San Francisco, one restaurant that would pop into my mind is Kevin's Noodle House. I haven't ate here in six years since I lived near a couple of pho places, so I felt like I was due for a visit here. I came here with a friend at around 7pm on a Sunday and it was a full house when we went in. We waited roughly ten minutes before we were seated near the back. I felt like nothing has really changed here since the last time I've gone here. I do remember they do serve large portions here though. Anyways, I looked through the menu and narrowed down my choices down to the number 2 special combo pho that seems to have everything and the beef stew with rice noodles. I decided to get the large beef stew with rice noodles since I prefer that just a little more. I wasn't planning on getting a drink, but once I saw an avocado shake on the menu, I was strongly considering the drink. Then my eyes wandered over to the salted plum drink and the salted plum soda and I was thinking about those as well. I decided to go for the avocado shake since it's rare that I get to taste a good avocado shake, and I'll probably have an easier time finding the salted plum drinks elsewhere. \n\nOur respective orders arrived and I stared at the bowl before me. The large was more of a large bowl, but content-wise, it seemed like there wasn't much there. However, once I poured the bean sprouts and mint leaves in, it quickly ballooned into a full bowl of pho. I then tasted the broth and found it to be flavorful, and then moved to the other contents. I found the beef to not be as tender as I thought it would be, and it still felt a little tough as I chewed and processed it. The carrots are also not as soft as I would have expected from a beef stew, leading me to believe that the beef stew could have been better if it was cooked a bit longer. The noodles, however, were excellent, and I really enjoyed them. I found very little need to add hoisin sauce or sriracha to the meal, and overall, the pho was good. \n\nMoving on to the avocado shake, I thought it was well done and was on par with some of the best avocado shakes that I had in the past. The sweetness level was just right, but I wouldn't have minded it if it was a bit sweeter, since I have a sweet tooth. Nothing is worse than an avocado shake that isn't sweet and just taste of avocados. However, one thing that they could work on is the boba, as I felt that it was a bit too soft, as soft as how I would've liked my beef stew. Overall, other than the boba, I thought it was pretty good.\n\nAll in all, I think my meal here was pretty good, and I would definitely come back here again hopefully sometime within the next six years. I think I would get the number two pho next time or one of the seafood pho dishes. I am also interested in the salted plum drinks and I could see myself ordering that next time as well. Anyways, for pho in the Sunset, I would recommend this place to anyone who needs to fulfill their pho cravings, and I can personally say that I am looking forward to my next time here as well.", "author": "Nelson X."}

My friends and I went on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't that busy. \n\nThe server rushed as while he was trying to take our orders. We got our food and my friend never got the water she asked for. The food was okay. The broth wasn't even hot or tasted fresh. My friend and I asked for forks and we had to wait for 5 minutes. We had to ask another server about our utensils and he finally brought some out within 2 minutes. The fork was unusually sticky for i had to dip it into the cup hot tea they served to \"clean it.\" I would of asked for another fork or a cup of hot water (so i can clean my fork) but I'm pretty sure they'd forget again.\nWe asked if we can pay separately and one of the servers said we had to go to the back and pay. We didn't mind having to get up to pay. (The other location splits the bill for you while you're still seated). \n\nThe reason why I'm never coming back to location was not only the terrible food service, but the lady that gave my friends and I attitude while we were trying to pay was rude and disrespectful. She was so ungrateful and she seemed like she didn't want us to be there. She seemed so annoyed and arrogant with us. Her tone of voice was very condescending and just straight up rude.

Pho definitely hits the spots on a cold and windy day! The wait wasn't too bad for 7pm on a Saturday evening (5-10 minute wait) since I know this restaurant to be popular with the locals.\n\nI ordered the #1.\n\nThis bowl is a common order for a lot of customers since it's a large size for $8.50 with a set number of ingredients. A lot of other pho items are about $8.25 for a medium size bowl, so of course getting the #1 makes sense to order. Though my photo doesn't do the item justice, the taste is there. Enough sodium in the broth to keep it savory, but not so much that it's unbearable. I also had their Vietnamese coffee as well, but I didn't really like that. I guess it's a personal preference for people to like bitter coffee.\n\nGo here for the Sunset District's best go-to pho restaurant (aside from PPQ)!", "author": "Kevin S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-29", "description": "This is a neighborhood favorite not because the pho is great, but because the food is inexpensive and they are in a sweet location on a busy street with lots of foot traffic.\n\nWhen it comes to their pho, there are a few things that disappoint me. \n- The tendons are usually rock hard and inedible. I've been here many times, so I don't know why I keep hoping the tendons will be better. \n- Sometimes, the noodles are clumped together, so remember to stir everything around first. \n- The thin slices of steak are frozen and often have freezer burn, and sometimes it has turned a dark unappealing color. I just slather on some sriracha & hoisin on the steak, dunk it in the broth, and it's fine.\n\nSo why do I keep coming back? \n- The food is inexpensive (~$6 - $9 for small, medium, large pho) and the location is convenient for me. We covered that already. \n- The broth has good flavor, and it's always piping hot. \n- The Thai basil and bean sprouts are crisp. \n- I walk away feeling full, and I manage to overlook whatever it was about the food that bothered me, because all that sticks with me is the feeling of ingesting a whole lot of noodle soup. \n- The fresh spring rolls ($~6 for 3) with peanut sauce and rice plates (~$8) aren't bad. \n- Service is fast. Of course it is. I'm pretty sure everything - assuming broth in a large stock pot, noodles in a large container, and bins of fixings - are all prepped and ready to go. Once you order, it shouldn't take more than a few minutes to get your food. \n- & they accept card payment.\n\nOverall, a good option for quick, inexpensive food if you're in the neighborhood, especially on a cold day. A solid... 7/10.", "author": "Joy W."}

I've never been a huge pho person, but Kevin's Noodle House may have surprised my tastebuds! I've been daydreaming about the pho I had for lunch today. It was perfect and didn't feel filled with MSG and I loved how generous they were with the protein.\n\nI felt myself coming down with a cold, so of course, pho seemed like a perfect solution to alleviate my symptoms. It definitely cleared my nose after adding some hot sauce and jalapenos. I went with the 22A, the chicken pho. Man, that was so satisfying and delicious! This is the first time, ever, that a pho restaurant has made me want to go back! I loved the flavor of the broth too!\n\nThe service is very quick and the workers there are pretty friendly too. The spring rolls came out almost immediately after ordering and the the bowls of pho came out a few minutes later. The price point is also great (about $6.50 for a small, $7.50 for a medium, $8.50 for a large). Mm... how I could go for another bowl right now!\n\nParking is a bit of pain. You do have to be a little aggressive and fight for a spot. Don't forget to treat yourself afterwards to some boba afterwards along the same street!", "author": "Janet H."}

Such a great meal to get when it's foggy and cold. Which is all the time. So it's a great meal to get everyday basically. I usually get a small bowl of rare beef pho with a side order of the fresh shrimp rolls which are so simple but so satisfying. This is a perfect meal in my eyes. So affordable and a great option for dinner/lunch/breakfast/post-hangover, etc. This place is pretty crackin' so expect a wait at peak hours (dinner time around 7-8). So worth it!

The service is incredibly fast, and the broth is pretty flavorful (some people complain of MSG, I couldn't care less.) The noodles are indeed clumpy, so give it a good stir, and the tendons are a no-go for me given how hard they've been.

There was a good amount of people, though luckily the restaurant has plenty of seating and we were immediately seated. The restaurant has this lovely authentic aroma of pho and the workers are also truly Vietnamese, which was a relief among the many unauthentic hipster pho places in San Francisco.\n\nI ordered the small Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien, the combo pho with beef balls (an extra $1.25 for the beef balls) options include small, medium, and large. This was served within 5-10 minutes (wow!) and the bowl admittedly was small, but given the alternate options and relatively cheap price, the portion seemed to make sense. Due to the size of the bowl, there was less soup though seemingly a lot of everything else. The consistency of the noodles was perfect and the meat was standard and aplenty. My main complaint was the soup tasted as if they relied a little bit too much on MSG for flavor, and was quite salty. I was not that hungry to begin with, but the small size honestly was pretty small and I realized at the end that there was quite less noodles than I had thought. \n\nMy boyfriend got the same dish but the large size and agreed the portion sizes were not the greatest. Particular he noted that his bowl, while significantly larger than mine, was mostly just soup and not enough noodles. He thought the meat was dry and bland, and that the soup could be more rich and flavorful.\n\nOverall: Not my favorite pho joint, but not bad.", "author": "Vivian L."}

The garnishes were super fresh too; they serve mint, slices of jalape\u00f1o chile, mung bean sprouts, and lime wedges along with your pho. The staff is super prompt and the wait @ 1:00 pm on a Saturday was very short since there are soooo many tables. The staff is very speedy and super kind, especially when we asked to split the check.

I'm basically writing this review on his behalf, since he doesn't really write Yelp reviews anymore. Hi, Michael N.!\n\nUp until we recently came here together, my fianc\u00e9 had been underwhelmed, disappointed, disgusted, disgruntled, or all of the above with every pho restaurant he had ever tried in the city. This includes Pho Ha Tien (he will never, ever go back), Evergreen Restaurant (convenient to our place but just ok), Mau (overpriced hipster pho, though he thinks the other items are good), Good Noodle/old Pho Clement (nothing special), and Turtle Tower (yes, he even turns his nose up at Turtle Tower!). \n\nAt Pho Huynh Hiep, he's a big fan of the broth, which is the most difficult ingredient in pho to win his approval. The cuts of beef in the soup are good quality, and the noodles are fine. And he appreciates that \"small\" sizes are available (\"People from Vietnam think it's weird how our bowls of pho in the U.S. are so big\").\n\nParking is not always the greatest in this part of the Sunset, but during the weeknights it's not so bad. The restaurant is pretty spacious, and the longest we've ever waited for a seat is 5 minutes.\n\nSide note to the pho: the spring rolls (goi cuon), which my fianc\u00e9 usually doesn't go for even in the South Bay, are fresh and delicious here. The consistency when you bite into them is just perfect. Probably because they are made to order, with good quality rice paper and fresh shrimp and veggies. We always order them as an appetizer now. \n\nIt is likely that Pho Huynh Hiep is the only place in SF we will ever eat pho again (I mean, we HAVE been there 4 times in the past month).

San Francisco has never really been known for its Vietnamese food and it's place like this that prove the notion to be true. Most of all I've sampled here in some way remind me of the Vietnamese fare back home in NYC. which is not a good thing. Hence, 3.5 stars rounded down is the best I can do for now.\n\nLike most Vietnamese spots that specialize in noodles and soups, pho is a natural benchmark to go on. Only problem is, the broth is mad bland. I've had my fair share of pho tai and pho tai chin / nam bowls here, all priced accordingly at less than $7 each but either its loaded with MSG (likely) and / or prepped with subpar seasoning (also likely). In the unlikelihood its just bad luck, I still haven't mustered a decent bowl of pho here just yet.\n\nThe other noodle soups, like bun rieu, hu tieu, and bun bo hue  or even mi hai son (seafod) are also low on the Viet totem pole of deliciousness. The broth in all need some work. From a noodle standpoint, the consistency is there, but the broth is one essential that locks everything in place; an equalizer of sorts. It's just not there and that strikes out a sizeable portion of the menu. \n\nRice plates have fared better, which is their saving grace. Their meaty combo platter - com suon lap xuong tau hu ky (aka Chinese sausage, pork chop, and shrimp cake) is a mean dish, especially when doused with a tangy but sweet nuoc mam fish sauce. I also have some love for the bun thit nuong cha gio, otherwise known as vermacelli with pork chop and spring rolls. It's got a lot of textures going on, served in a decent portion if I've ever seen one.\n\nWhile there are some Viet servers, let us not forget this is The Richmond area. Most everyone will be Chino, which includes lots of the wait staff. They're not the friendliest bunch, so make sure you've got your orders straight before they ask (unhappily) again.", "author": "Jando S."}

The fatty brisket was good, I just wish I got more than one tiny shredded piece of it.\n\n0/1 Stars for Value --\nI would say this place is on the cheap side for food in general (about $8-10 per person), but I've had better and cheaper pho.

Tables turn quickly owing to the rapid delivery of pho and the acknowledgement that this is not a place to linger.  Beware though:  if anyone in your party orders bun, your pho order will be timed for delivery along with the bun (as it should be) and you'll wait longer than you would if you were dining only with other pho eaters.  \n\nA medium bowl of well-done brisket pho was $6 plus change.  A bowlful of beef bun (noodles, veggies, meat) was $8+.  The place serves no alcohol so this might contribute also to the pace at which things move along here (as well as the ridiculously reasonable end of meal tab).\n\nAs I fished through my pho I could be heard saying \"If I lived nearby I'd be here all the time\".

The first thing I noticed is it was PACKED for a Wednesday night. Judging by the number of reviews, this place is pretty popular. The service was very good and quick. One unique thing about this place is that the menu has different sized bowls of different soups, which was to my liking. I can't finish a full bowl of pho, so I ordered a small which was the perfect size, and I paid less in the end.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the spring rolls, I'm a pretty basic white dude, so I got the beef ball and rice noodle soup, and my buddy ate some beef stew. The spring rolls were amazing, probably the best I've ever had. They tasted super fresh, and the peanut sauce made them better. My Soup was pretty good, broth, beef, condiments, everything was great. I would go back here, but I like the Vietnamese place on Noriega street with the yellow awning and the name that I'm not even gonna bother to pronounce better!\n\nThis place has great Vietnamese food, and will serve as my second in command neighborhood pho restaraunt.", "author": "Jim D."}

I kid you not, these are some of the best wings I've had, the Vietnamese know how to do it, and Vietnamese Fried Chicken (VFC) is now my new addiction. First of all, they are large and in charge; hot, juicy, and light, I think they use Peanut Oil to fry the chicken.

Flank, brisket, tripe, tendon is what I normally get, along with a cafe sua da (iced coffee with condensed milk).\n\nThe first time the coffee had way too much condensed milk in it. The second time i asked for less milk and they gave me like 5 milimeters worth in height (WTF, I said less, not miniscule!). Get the balance right!\n\nThere is not much of an issue with the quality of the tendons, brisket, or flank. But on the 2nd visit, the pho noodles were mushy, clumpy, soggy, and just too soft/overcooked. There is a Cantonese term for this monstrosity, better pronounced as \"lum peht peht\", and that's not a good texture unless you are a teething infant, or an old toothless man.\n\nThe broth is a tad too heavy, and obviously is enhanced. This is a far cry from the clearer cleaner broth that I prefer at Pho Y 1 (E Capitol) San Jose.

If you're looking for a review on their pho, you should just completely ignore this review.\n\nTheir rice plates are SO FREAKING GOOD. I can't even begin to tell you how beautifully flavored and seasoned the meats on their rice plates are, and they definitely don't skimp out on the portions. They also serve a small bowl of the pho broth with your rice plate (no noodles, but it's alright--I never eat mine though). They get pretty crowded because it's so damn popular, but their service is quick so you won't really ever have to wait long. There's also plenty of tables.\n\nNote on service: they're not going to be incredibly attentive to your every single need, and it makes sense because it's such a high volume restaurant and they need a quick turnover to accommodate as many patrons as they can. Nonetheless, they do come around to fill your water every now and then. Just don't expect a greeting every time you come in the door, when you leave, and a \"how are you doing\" throughout your meal. It's not that kind of place, and if it were they would definitely charge more.\n\nIt's perfect comfort food, and they've stayed consistent with their flavors and their portions for each of my visits.

It has the right amount of flavor and spice within the broth. The beef stew was tender and a good amount (unlike some viet places that give you just 2 small pieces). The amount for a small size was smaller than other viet places because most smalls are usually the size of mediums so it's perfect for someone who doesn't have too big of an appetite; otherwise get a medium! A small was only $5.75!!! That's an incredible price for dinner in SF! \n\nThe durian shake that I got (that everyone was not fond of! =P) was really tasty and a good price at $2.75 because some other viet places charge up to $6.00 because durian usually cost a lot more than your standard strawberry or mango powder).\n\nTotal price including tip and tax was $11. Now that's a very appetizing and affordably delicious meal for SF! Will definitely come back!\n\nThe bathroom was a bit of a wait and they ran out of toilet paper and paper towels (and they didn't replace it quickly enough throughout the day) but just ask them and they should get to it.

I came here with my roomie to get a nice bowl of soup and because we were craving durian.

I ordered my default pho (pho tai with bo vien (meatballs) since I don't like tendon, flank and all of those weird things that hang off of the meat) and we shared an order of fresh spring rolls. To top off our meal, we both got durian shakes and boy was that tasty. They probably use frozen durian here since it's pretty hard to get it fresh here and the restaurant would definitely smell like it if they opened up fresh durian, which it didn't.\n\nOverall, the restaurant was very clean, especially for a pho restaurant. It's close enough to UCSF, so I bet they get a lot of students stopping in. The meal was cheap and I was able to get my Viet food fix in and my fill of durian for the month.

For the Appetizers I have had the Goi Cuon and Cha Gio. Goi Cuon is pretty standard, but I think each roll is lacking in one half of a shrimp. Their peanut sauce tastes heavy in peanut and is thick. I think they should add pickled carrots and radishes in their peanut sauce. Im not a fan of their Cha Gio for how its made. It looks like a normal chinese egg roll and does not look appetizing.\n\nOverall this restaurant has good flavors and I would recommend going here.

Fresh broth, fresh noodles, very fresh greens, therefore excellent pho. Hot tea is served. They take your order down with an iPad, so no screw-ups. \n\nIf there are other people standing around when you come in through the door, look for the sheet to put your name and party size down to help everyone keep track of which group is to be served next. Customers tend to overlook this, maybe because they're too eager to sit down and chow down. :)\n\n\nAlso, because I like to note random details, I noticed one of the staff members did something that'd typically go unnoticed and one that I actually really appreciated thanks to my father's feng shui teachings. In the back corner of the vast main dining room, there's a vestibule that leads to the restroom, and in the doorway between the vestibule and the dining room, there's a door. The staff makes a conscious effort to keep the door leading into said vestibule closed such as to keep that \"bad\" energy from the restroom away from creeping into the main dining room. You know...Chinese philosophy. (And you say: But it's a Viet joint!) Oh whatever. *I* appreciate it.\n\nGood for: quick 'n' cheap meals, parties up to 6 (a handful of tables can seat 8) people, solo diners, casual dinner dates.

For to-go you head straight to the counter and an old lady with absolutely no smile on the face resembling a disgruntled school teacher hands you the menu to order and after you order the only word you get is \"15 min-uu-ttes\". I got a combo rice plate, took them about 30 min not an issue given the rush but what drives you a bit crazy is the haphazard way they arrange their to-gos but the packing was good enough to withhold the ride home.

I have two hands also I can do it by myself. But the attitude was not nice at all. Also when I get my check, I thought it is expensive than I counted. She put my menu MEDIUM SIZE. I called service again and I said I ordered small size and even you checked it again. Ha She said no you said medium size and you already ate this. So just pay. And then spoke Vietnamese language. Are you kidding me? I could pay one dollar more for medium but with this kind of attitude? No!!! This restaurant service is awful and terrible.", "author": "Seulki H."}

I knew I would be back.\n\nAnd so you can bet that when I moved to the inner sunset and was down with the cold, Pho Huynh Hiep #2 (I like the way the name rolls off my tongue in my mangled anglicization, like an accelerating chromatic balloon) was the first place I thought of. And it worked.\n\nIf Warhol did a Campbell's Soup-esque painting of this chicken soup, it would be -- among many other things -- a completely unironic rendition. Because sometimes I do say 'Mmm-mmm good' when I eat your soup, but not because I've been conditioned by years of cheesy advertisements with jingles. No, this is a pre-TV, visceral reaction.\n\nTo be honest, I didn't even know Vietnamese dishes existed besides Pho (before I went to a Pho Huynh Hiep). I mean this from an epistemological standpoint. Can one really say one knows such dishes exist, having never seen or tasted one oneself? Exactly. And how would I ever know, when I'm programmed to say \"A large #1 please\" at every other restaurant I go to in the States? But something happened that hot summer day, and now I know about Vermicelli plates with Pork, and Vietnamese Rice Combos. If you had a salad, I would eat it. Actually I did. And this exploration of cuisine alone is the most culture I've ever experienced in San Francisco, with the exception of riding the Muni (a beast of its own, to be sure).\n\nLast but not least, 'real artists ship.' That's what Steve Jobs said. Or that's what Steve Jobs said while plagiarizing a la his other favorite quote, 'real artists steal.' Who knows. Regardless of the apocryphal origins of the phrase, you are the embodiment of it. And by that I mean the operational efficiency of this place. It is the perfect balance of tradition (broth) meeting technology (mobile kitchen order relays). And I work in the mobile payments industry, so I have some inkling of what I'm talking about.\n\nYes, now you know I know you know how to move product. And I know this is true, because you have multiple locations around the bay area, steeped in this very same tradition of brothy excellence.\n\nHats off to you Kevin. It's good to see people 'doing it right.' And I sincerely believe you help bring the hungry and the lonesome traveller back to humanity, one contemplative bowl of broth at a time... although, I'm pretty sure I'm the only person I've ever seen eating a bowl of chicken soup at closing by himself.\n\nRegardless -- my regards,\n\n-Christophe\"", "author": "Christophe C."}

You sort of lose track after 100 bowls, (actually maybe thousands) in over 100 places. There is a book title somewhere in there. \n\nI have been to Pho Hunyh Hiep 5  - one of the other Kevin's Noodle Houses - many times as my local go-to Pho diner when i worked in Concord near the Park and Shop mall where it was located.\n\nNumber 2 here is similar in set up, with about 3 rows of tables in a pretty large room that has about 20 tables and the same familiar drill at most Pho specialty places. \n\nHere, for the first time on Yelp, are the instructions from the standard Vietnamese Pho Restaurant Operating Manual, that secret and sacred document revealed here in public for the first time to educate and expand the appreciation of the growing Low Fan (foreigner) Pho loving masses: \n\n1. Number tables sequentially so you can put it on the guests check and manage the logistics of payment after the meal. The numbers must be in standard gold and black sticker decals of regulation height and placement, centered on the wall next to the table, or affixed prominently on the side of the silver napkin holder or silver table accessories caddy if there is no nearby wall. \n\n2. The guest check must be in 2 parts, with a detachable small bottom that you throw randomly on the table, where you can write the table number that matches the table, and the top part of the check, which you leave at the cashier in random cascaded piles. \n\n3. Have the standard Chinese/Vietnamese silver table caddy for: \na) Faux marble plastic beige chopsticks (must hold at least 50, try green/red if you want to look different, but not recommended) \nb) Soup spoons, must be plastic with faux blue porcelain appearance, rice or fish design\nOptions C - room for red squeeze bottle of Hoy Sin Sauce and off the 99 Ranch store shelf Sri Racha Tung Ot sauce, soy sauce, and glass dish for hot chili oil with silver lid and plastic spoon. If not room in caddy, place on table as if there was. \nOption D - add room for mini-saucer for condiments, i.e. Hoy Sin sauce and Sri Racha, to dip your Pho meat to season and eat, instead of dumping all of that into the broth and spoiling the 4 hour broth flavor you tried to create \n(but let Low Fan squeeze into broth, because that is what they are trained to do with catsup bottle on French Fries, or mustard on Hot Dogs, or thousand Island on Salads) \n\n4. Have 1 man serve as arbitrator of guest seating, and order taking. Must know menu by number and name, and good at pointing. Must know how to decipher Low Fan pronunciation in Vietnamese of Pho (Foh instead of Fa-uh). \n\n5. Substitute for man only when necessary with young cute girl (preferable a relative) who is tough and doesn't smile, otherwise leave women at cashier desk to handle money and sort out guest checks (preferable matriarch from Vietnam with poor English skills). Secret is, women are observant, so even though guests don't know their table number, she does, and can find the right check within 3 attempts, max, usually in 1 try.  \n\n6. Have older male staff as food runners, because their skin isn't as sensitive.  Must be able to handle hot bowls of soup, possibly with thumb over lip into bowl, for balance. No English skills required, in fact avoid. Refer to #4 man/arbitrator for questions. Cart/bussing skills a plus. \n\nI ordered Pho Tai Gau, medium. The broth was pretty good, a decent balance of sweet and sour. Not too mucked up with extras, but nice onions. The noodles were good, clumped as is typical, but not falling apart, or milky or mushy. The meat was average in quantity, but it was tougher than my now standard near Concord,  Pho Lee Hoa Phat (which also has several locations in the east bay). I also ordered Cafe Sua (Viet coffee). \n\nThis being SF, with the strong Chinese influence, it is common to be served a pot of tea in Vietnamese places. In the South Bay, it is more common to be served ice water in a glass. \n\nWhen I came in, everything was per Manual steps 1 and 2. I had to ask #4 for Hoy Sin, because it wasn't on every table per the manual rule number 3 Option, C above. I promptly got that from the #4. #6 did as instructed. The Matriarch settled my bill, as required in rule #5.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

Between 19th and 20th Ave on Irving, there are 2 pho joints that compete in the battle of the PHO - KEVINS VS PPQ.. and this is how it goes down:\n\nBroth - Kev wins, hands down. Kevs is richer, fuller, greasier, and just overall more satiating for the belly.  PPQs broth is cleaner and \"healthier\", if you're down for that.\n\nBeef - PPQ wins, hands down. Getting beef on the side, you can def tell the difference. PPQ is bright red and fresh. Kevs may have a little brown ring around the edges.\n\nRice plates - PPQs charbroiled meats are BOMB, along with their imperial roll. Never tried Kevs but they have egg rolls instead of imperial rolls. Not a fan.\n\nCleanliness- Kevs for the tables, utensils, menus and bathroom. PPQ may be sticky icky icky with tore up utensils and pubes sprinkled on the menus. \n\nService - Kev, for they understand English (HUGE PLUS) and will respond WITH urgency to our overwhelming demands for extra onions/cilantro, jalepenos, water, and tea. Also, service is fast, we were waved down to a table the second we stepped thru the door-homie saw us coming from outside! PPQ is hit or miss. You may have to wave your arm and remind the server you're waiting for a table when its busy. Your server will most likely be a fob*, so beware when making special requests, only 50% of them will be understood but they'll say yes and nod their heads to everything you say. \n\nParking - is a bizitch either way. Prepared to get sick driving round n round in circles.\n\nHours- PPQ is open about 1/2 hr later.\n\nBottom line: My heart will always have a special place for PPQ, but right now, Kevin satisfies the soul more .. & thats soul pho real.", "author": "Angela W."}

Test it if it's fresh by snapping the bean sprout in half, should be a easy bend and water will pop out. This place gets busy on weekends, but the turnover rate for tables are quick. Make sure to put your name on the clipboard on the front. Parking is a bit hard since it's located on the busy streets of Irving but this place is worth the hassle. They have really good blended drinks too! I suggest trying the avocado or jackfruit shake. Made with real ingredients. The crab cakes are also the best ones I've ever had!

For most of the items on their menu, you can order a small, medium or large. I ordered a large  for $8.50 and the bowl was HUGE!! Whenever I come here, it seems like most people order the medium because most people wouldn't be able to finish the large in one sitting. On average, the large costs $7.50. \n\nService is also very fast! On their busy nights, I have waited less than 10 minutes for my order. On their slower nights, I guarantee you that your order will come in less than five minutes. \n\nI also love that they put the mint, cilantro and bean sprouts on the side. I have been to pho restaurants where there is too much or too little mint, cilantro and/or bean sprouts, so for them to have these items on the side was a great idea. \n\nI only have two complaints, which also explains the -1 star:\n\n1) I wish they added more noodles. The amount of meat is great, but if they are going to serve me a huge bowl, I would hope that they would put enough noodles to fill it and not just serve me a bowlful of broth. \n\n2) The boba is gross.

It is always the go-to place my friends and I hit up when we're craving some pho or Viet food.\n\nThe service is pretty on point. Even on their most busiest days, we've been seated within 20 mins at the most, and the food usually comes out in 10 mins.  The place itself is very clean, which I do enjoy as well.\n\nNow, the food:  I usually order the #2 medium, which is my favorite.  The broth is the best, and there is always the right amount of broth-noodle-meat within the dish.  I also have gotten the #1 XL (which is like the #2, but in a bigger bowl), which is definitely more bang for your buck, especially if your hungry.  Another favorite of mine are the fried egg rolls, which are delicious! The prices are relatively cheap when it comes to pho as well...just another reason why this is my favorite pho spot in SF!", "author": "Megan K."}

They replace the shrimp with the holy grail of any veggie dish: AVOCADO. Mmmm! Also, I recently discovered that if you get the number 48 (B\u00fan Ch Gi\u00f2 -Fried egg roll, lettuce, carrot, peanut w/ vermicelli) you can sub a couple fried eggs for the egg roll. This makes a really fresh and satisfying vermicelli salad.

However, since PPQ is owned by a good friend's family, I've always been keen in being able to tell her I contribute to her college education. \n\nDecided to try this place today and it wasn't bad! The price was good for the amount of food you get ($6.50 for a medium bowl of pho with tripe, steak, flank, and brisket). You can't find that price very often anymore. The broth was nice and hot which was a HUGE plus cause a bowl of pho isn't the same if the soup broth is just luke warm. There was a decent amount of flavor in it and they were generous with toppings which is very rare these days. I made a mistake by not asking for my thinly sliced steak on the side cause it was way overcooked by the time I got to it. \n\nThis place fills up quick during lunch time, but the service is also very good and they have enough workers to keep the flow going.

After getting a tea in the outer regions (review to follow), I hitch hiked out of there back to civilization (fine, I took the N, but for the sake of the story, I'm calling it hitch hiking), and was craving pho. After carefully analyzing the Yelp profiles of several nearby Vietnamese joints, I ended up here.\n\nGlad that I did! It was 2pm on a Monday, and there were several tables of people, which was a good sign. Something about the place feels warm and cozy, despite its relatively large size. And despite that after ordering, I needed to talk to my server, went up to the counter, and was greeted by an older lady with, \"What you want!\" It was actually funny.\n\nAnyway, the pho was great. I alternate between seafood and veggie, and couldn't find either on the menu that didn't have chicken or beef broth. I asked the server, and unfortunately they don't have a veggie broth (I've come to realize those are somewhat tough to find), but they do have seafood (my server helped me find it - the menu is rather big). You can order small, medium, or large bowls, prices ranging from around $5.50 to $7.50. Fantastic deal!  It came out within about 5 minutes, piping hot and fresh, accompanied by basil, lime, sprouts, and jalepeno, all bursting with flavor.

Very full flavored and after a couple spoonfuls of chili oil, I found it had a nice kick to it. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a large 'Dac Biet Bo Vien' ($8.25) pho, which was HUGE (seriously massive! but my 6'4\" bf loved it so much he said he could have eaten 3 bowls) and full of all sorts of beef & beef derivatives. He was super happy with his order, as evidenced by the fact that he ate it ALL. \n\nI'm not the biggest pho fan, and I found the broth to have a strong beefy flavor, which was a little heavy for my taste, but I think that's a matter or personal preference. Luckily, I preferred my beef stew to the pho my bf ordered, and he preferred his pho to my stew. \n\nThe restaurant had a somewhat sparse feel to it, a big room with lots of tables & a few paintings (with a distinctly 'asian' theme) lining the walls, but the place was full & lively. Very low-key and casual, which I had no problem with. The service was EXTREMELY quick...I'd say it was a 3 or 5 minute wait between ordering and getting our food. Kudos for the fact that one of the waitresses was able to let me know whether or not the beef stew had any sort of shellfish in it (allergy), which is sometimes a bit more complicated to figure out. \n\nConsidering the price, quantity, flavor & expediency, this place definitely earned 4 stars in my book. Great for a foggy evening out in Inner Sunset!", "author": "Kaden F."}

Soup comes out, on average, about 5 minutes after you order, and they're really good at filling your tea pot as soon as the lid pops open.\n\nAlso, they definitely give me a really generous amount of meat (as much as I wish I could say it was a regular-perk, it seems to just be standard practice for them; I never actually get special treatment...), and when I have felt the need for extra broth, they're always willing to provide.\n\nAlso, the tamarind candies that come with your check are my favorite, so it's all win here!", "author": "Emilynne A."}

So after numerous tasty visits to PPQ, I finally decided I need to be fair and give this place a shot. \n\nSo when I came here, I couldn't decide what I wanted, so I decided to judge based off the pictures. And after a few minutes of browsing the menu, I decided to go with the Beef Stew. While this is not really a Pho dish, it would at least give me a feel for how good their food is. Let's just say that I definitely loved what I got but it didn't blow me out of the water. \n\nWhether or not this is better than PPQ is tough to say for now. I will definitely have to try the actual Pho here before making that assessment but what I can say is that their stew was delicious so I expect great things from their Pho as well.", "author": "Gajan K."}

It is the worst Vietnamese food I've had in the city.  My boyfriend agrees.  Neither of us are Vietnamese but we eat it once a week.  We love it.  This place was terrible.  I don't mind a bad atmosphere or bad service (this place has both) if the food is good (which it is not).  Therefore this place has nothing going for it.  Oh, except that it is cheap.  I'm pretty sure that's the only reason people like this place.  \n\nI was in the mood for some fried fish, but they had none.  Fine.  I wanted banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches), but they didn't have that either.  My boyfriend wanted crab pho, nope, sorry, no go.   Fine again.  We had the fried eggrolls.  They tasted like Chinese eggrolls, not Vietnamese.  My boyfriend had some beef pho.  It was awful.  In fact, it left a bad aftertaste in your mouth.  And there was an odd sweetness to it, as if they added cinnamon.  I had the pork bun (a rice vermicelli dish).  The noodles were cold and the pork was all fat.  The dish as a whole lacked flavor.  Nothing was spicy, which was a big disappointment.  Everything we had had no savory flavor and was way too sweet.  I kept adding hot sauce and I couldn't get the food spicy enough. \n\nWe didn't even finish our meals.  We had a few bites, paid and went next door to get some pizza from Irving's pizza (now that IS good).  If you want good, cheap Vietnamese, try Sandy's on 9th and Irving.  Not much to look at but the food is consistently good and the family that runs it is very sweet.  I won't cheat on you again Sandy's!  It is just not worth it!", "author": "Melissa M."}

This time was so much different.  The staff is beyond rude and bordering on hostile in some cases.  The food was just okay.  My soup came out in about one minute from the time I ordered, so if you're in a hurry that is good.  Problem was that it wasn't prepared well.  The waiter was severely pissed off at everyone and everything.  Every time I had to ask for anything I was met with a serious attitude.  I also watched him yell at a party of 4 that was trying to sit down at a table that he didn't want them to sit at.  This was the worst possible experience of customer service I have dealt with.  I will not be going back.  If this waiter worked for me in my customer service oriented business, he would be dismissed immediately.", "author": "James L."}

However every time I've dined here, the service has become progressively worse. My fianc\u00e9 and I waited just over half an hour to be seated. Saturday night; I get it. When we were seated, we waited about 10 minutes before they took our order. They forget half of it. I tried getting the busboy's attention on three occasions where we literally made eye contact every time and he ignored me. I finally asked for the check. Waited for about 10 minutes before we decided to get up and pay at the counter. That took about to 10 minutes.

I have been eating here for over 15 years - yes kids, it's been around at least that long - and it's been my favorite, consistent go-to ph\u00f3 restaurant during that time.  \n\nPros: \n- Familiar faces working here, day in day out, year in year out.  \n- Consistent, always excellent ph\u00f3.  Other very good menu items if you're not in the mood for ph\u00f3.  \n- 4 types of ph\u00f3 noodles to choose from - thin and wide rice, thin and wide egg.  (My current favorite is the thin egg noodle)\n- Clean!\n- Asian families, teenagers, hipsters, older folks, everyone! come here to eat.  It's comfortable, hits the spot and provides great value for the money.  I've brought friends, family, international visitors, and even a first date (she demanded ph\u00f3) here over the years.  A neophyte friend of mine didn't say a word during his entire consumption of his first ever bowl of ph\u00f3 (combination ph\u00f3 with thin rice noodle, extra large) and only when he was finished did he finally speak, proclaiming \"Excellent!\".\n- Seafood noodle soup for the pescatarians among us.   Hold the beef!\n\nCons:\n- As with most ph\u00f3 houses, limited choices for vegetarians.  Lettuce, bean sprouts, basil, and carrots only get you so far.\n\nThis place used to be called Pho Hyunh Hiep but now goes by Kevin's Noodle House.  Thankfully the food and staff are unchanged even though the place was refurbished about the same time as the name change.  \n\nGo on a cold day, get your ph\u00f3 on, and revel in the comfort that such a simple, delicious food provides. \n\nFor those of you that are new to the game, I would suggest either the standard sliced beef ph\u00f3 or the combination ph\u00f3 with either the thin rice or thin egg noodles.  Their dry vermicelli bowls are a good introduction too.  Enjoy!", "author": "Xaman E."}

Went in with a baby at night, and they suggested the front side table, but I declined - citing the cold coming in through the doors.  In fact, most patrons were bundled up, with some still in their jackets.  The soup warms you up after awhile, anyways.\n\nWe mentioned to the host that we needed a booster chair but no one helped us, so we just stood by our table with the baby in our arms.  Finally, we just scanned the room until we saw the stack and I got it myself.  Then we sat down, and after awhile, my husband got up to get the menus himself.  Our phos came quickly, and my husband asked the server in Vietnamese for a cup of room temperature water.  The guy left with a backwards look at us, and a woman stepped in to see what we wanted.  So, some of the staff don't speak Vietnamese, but they won't let on.  We ended up with a glass of cold water.\n\nThe chicken and the pho broths were good, my husband said.  Flavorful.  We finished them pretty quickly.  The stack of veggies that came with the pho is smaller than in restaurants where the clients are predominantly Vietnamese, but it was adequate for our needs.\n\nI have a feeling my medium pho was actually a small -- like someone else reviewed.  There were only 3 slices of beef and 3 significant clumps of tripe, with just a small mound of noodles.  I was still hungry afterwards, so we left to get some tapioca to fill me up.\n\nI'm still nursing the tapioca an hour later-- to block out the MSG sting on my tongue.

Being a high schooler back then, with no job, the allowance i got from my parents could only afford, getting a quickly's or wonderful foods drink then going into Kevin's noodle house for an after-school meal.  The rule was for vermicelli you go across the street to PPQ, you want Pho then Kevin's noodle house ; and depending on what rice plate you want you go to the one that you prefer to make that particular rice plate; ex: five spic chicken rice plate, go to PPQ, and Kevin's doesn't have five spice chicken.\n\nBut basically, you really could never go wrong with this place for pho.  The noodles are firm and supple but sometimes it's a bit mushy like it's been in the soup for too long, but don't worry it's  like a 1/100 chance it happens; I'm only saying this because it has happened to me maybe like 2 times, and I eat here a LOT. The broth is heavy with flavor and not bland (unlike PPQ's, NEVER go there for pho, taste like they use swanson broth and then throws in some onions). \n\nService is good, if you can speak vietnamese because they literally do not understand what you say.

Kudos to Willie for paying for the foods.\n\nParking.. is a little bit difficult.. since it's right in the middle of the area that surrounded by groceries stores, corner stores and restaurants.\n\nI went there with my gf, her friend and her friend's friends. So it's like there are 5 of us altogether. All of them ordered some type of pho and stew. I got tired of having pho every single time I went to Vietnamese restaurant. So instead, I ordered Rice with Pork Chop with Shredded Pork.\n\nTheir orders came out first.. obviously - it's pho.. it's like the quickest to make and serve. But I don't mind waiting a little longer. I've been trying to get a taste of their (Vietnamese) infamous Pork Chop Rice. And then it came.\n\nThe pork chop, the shredded pork all sitting on top of the white rice.. so beautiful. It came with some soup. It taste delicious too. I'm lovin every bite of my food.\n\nI'm also glad that the price of a Pho house in SF also the same with the one in my city, Philadelphia. Cheap!\n\nService.. just the same with every Pho restaurant out there. Regular. Nothing special.\n\nThere's a reason behind this 4 stars.. and not 5. When my new friend paid for all of our meals, and he already gave them tips and all.. we were still staying there to chat while drinking tea and stuffs. About 1/2 hour passed by.. suddenly one of their waiter stood closely to our table and started to glare at us repeatedly.. like wanted us to just get out and moved our conversation somewhere else. We got the hint and felt uncomfortable. So we decided to bounce. Too bad...", "author": "Yohann S."}

I usually go there for the vermicelli (cold noodles) with their shredded pork, shrimp rolls, and grilled chicken with fish-sauce vinegarette.  Their soup bowls are in three sizes so you have control of how much you want to eat.  Some places bring one standard size and you basically throw away uneaten food or you force feed yourself.  Yay, no need to gorge yourself of pho noodles!  They also have bubble tea drinks as well as smoothies.

She made a blood curdling scream but then put away her machete and went about the other tables.\n\nAfter that, smooth sailing. The pho, a medium, at $5.95, was plenty large. The portion was good, well cooked, with high quality beef. The broth was above average and the noodles were good. The pork chop over rice was not too fatty, well cooked and 4 large pieces.

Noodle soups also come out almost right after you order.  Talk about fast food.\n\nI usually opt for the #2 The combination beef noodle soup (the one with the beef balls) or if I'm really hungry, go for the #1 because its an X-Large.  Sometimes I'll go for the chicken pho, but only if I don't feel like going to the Tenderloin for Turtle Tower.  Other times I might try a rice plate or vermicelli as pho gets boring after so many times.  The imperial rolls are okay, have had better.  The chicken wings are VERY oily and not the best also.  The plus with their chicken wings though, is that they make it themselves in the back.  Other places uses frozen stuff and just toss it in the fryer (ABC on Noriega).  Food is okay.  Very cheap and very filling.   \n\nJust wish the soup didn't look like dirty toilet water -_-  But hey, what pho restaurant has soup that doesn't look like that? Always ask for extra lime as it makes your food taste better, and gets rid of the smell.  I also wish the quality of their food was better.  The beef is rubbery a lot of times and has too much fat.  The tendon, which should be very soft, is always too tough for my liking.  Tripe is something I forgo at this place because of how chewy and raw it feels when I try to eat it.\n\nService isn't the best here.  A group of around 5-6 I came with, asked for ice water, and they just laughed and yelled \"ice water.\"  We never did get that ice water until we asked them for the 3rd time.  Terrible.  If we ask once, you should just bring it and not be so rude about it.  \n\nI guess I'll be coming back here whenever PPQ -right across the street -  is packed like it always is when I go.  If this place is also packed, then I'm waiting for PPQ.  For what you pay, and how fast the food comes out, it gets a 3 star in my book.

This place does not disappoint taste wise, but the service was lacking. Since my friend frequents this restaurant, I told her to order me the best Pho on the menu. She went with her favorite, which was the medium sized beef. Even though she said 2 mediums, they brought us a small and a medium. Instead of making a second medium, they simply added more broth to mine and brought it back. It was rather disappointing b/c there wasn't much to consume. However, it did taste amazing and I loved all of their fresh ingredients and sauces to add to the mix. We also ordered the egg rolls, which tasted amazing w/ their table sauces as well. Yummy! I like that they provided us with free tea as well- always a nice perk! Oh...and on a Friday night, you can expect a wait. So earlier is better.", "author": "Sonya D."}

You'll be seated fast and I think just about everything on the menu is less than $10.  It's super fast, super cheap and very filling.  \n\nIt's pretty clean considering the many Vietnamese places I've been to and the other restaurants on the same street.  They do take Visa, Mastercard, etc., which is nice especially when you go with your friends and want to worry about splitting the bill later.  \n\nThe food always comes out really hot, the meat isn't a questionable blue color and they have plenty of hot sauce, hoisin sauce and it comes with your standard basil, sprouts, peppers and lime.   The broth is light yet full of flavor, not too oily, meat portions are good and the veggies are fresh. \n\nIf you're looking for awesome bun (shhh..go across the street) this place does have decent bun, rice plates, etc., but the Pho here is so so so good. I never get the large because I am very satisfied after a medium.  Unlike some other places, I don't go home with a huge MSG headache afterwards either. \n\nI've been there with 1 person and also with 30 other people and we always get seated quickly and get our hot bowl of pho just as quick. The only thing is that a large group might have a hard time all finding street parking right away.

Usually we know what we're getting so it's not a problem. But the last time we came here, I quickly changed my mind right after I placed an order...so I waited for my friend to finishing ordering first, and then told the waiter to take two things off of my order and replace it with ONE thing. Simple, right?? Apparently NOT. Our waiter was young, maybe in his early 20s, and seemed to understand English well enough, but he kept asking me to repeat my order over and over again like 5x. Then after patiently repeating my order to him multiple times, one of the chefs STILL brought out one of the things I asked the waiter to take off. I told him, 'I said no tofu. I didn't order this.' So he went to the back, asked the waiter, and then just came back and put the dish back on our table without saying anything and started to walk away. I stopped him and told him to take the dish back because I didn't order it. \n\nThen, to make things worse, my friend found a metal object in his soup. The manager came over and apologized and offered a new bowl, but my friend asked to have them take his soup off the tab. I asked the manager if we could get the checks and a couple of boxes. He said okay, and then just walked back over to the front register and sat there!!! After 5 mins of staring at him in disbelief, I stopped another waiter to ask for boxes and the check because our waiter seemed to have disappeared. \n\nThis was a HORRIBLE experience for me and my friend, we tried to be nice and patient about things, but their service just lacks!!

Plus they don't have two of my favourite dishes - bun bo hue and beef carpaccio with lemon - both of which I can get at Golden Star. On the plus side, their prices are extremely reasonable.\n\nI got the beef stew with clear noodles for an extra 50\u00a2. I thought clear noodles meant the skinny glass noodles, but instead they were like regular pho noodles, but clear and chewier/gummier (called hu tieu, I think). Though there was lots of beef brisket, there wasn't enough broth and most of my noodles were left uneaten just because I ran out of soup. The broth itself was ok but could've been more flavourful.\n\nMy friend got the grilled beef & shrimp cake with rice (#43). I didn't get to try the beef but he gave me one of the fried shrimp cakes and I really liked it, especially the crispy tofu skin (dried bean curd) it's wrapped in. We also split an order of shrimp spring rolls, which, again, were good but tasted like spring rolls you can find at any other Vietnamese restaurant.", "author": "Steph L."}

All great rivals have their respective venues of play, whether it's 18th century Vienna, Madison Square Garden, or on a shelf of two-liter bottles at the supermarket.  And on opposite sides of Irving Street at the busy 19th Avenue intersection, few rivals are in as close proximity as Pho Huynh Hiep 2 and Pho Phu Quoc, also known as PPQ.\n\nSo what's there to know about these two contenders? For starters, both serve a mean bowl of steaming pho', the perfect compliment to a cold evening, or the perfect way to recover from a cold or to fill an empty stomach.\n\nBy coincidence, I went to both Pho Huyn Hiep 2 and PPQ about a week apart.  Both times, the weather was cold and misty.  Both times, the dining areas were crowded with clientele busily chatting away between slurps. And both times I ordered my usual, #1 hold the tendon and tripe (all cartilaginous goodness is always a little too much for me).  In most pho' restaurants, that'll leave you with steak, flank, brisket and sometimes meatballs, with rice noodles in a delicious broth.\n\nBoth restaurants serve an excellent bowl of pho'.  I think PPQ sets the benchmark for what to expect from a typical pho' joint with a good broth/noodle/beef ratio, though the bowls could be a tad larger.\n\nOn the other hand, the extra-large bowl at Pho Huynh Hiep 2 is tremendous.  I did notice the broth to have a little more texture to it, just a touch thicker with a fuller flavor.  Disappointingly, their ratio wasn't as good--I found myself at the end of our meal scouring the bowl for loose strands to no avail.  The noodles were also slightly overcooked.\n\nSo what's the verdict?  Honestly you can't go wrong with either.  The dining area Pho Huynh Hiep 2 is twice as large as PPQ, so on a crowded night, you're likely to get seated faster, in my book this can be the deal-breaker.  They also have larger bowls to accommodate the hungriest patrons.   But on a lazy afternoon when both shops are equally empty, I think I'd tip my hat to PPQ.  They've got the edge when it comes to a well-balanced bowl of pho'.\n\nSo if it's crowded, you want a different take on broth, or are simply famished, go to Pho Huynh Hiep 2.  If it's quiet, and all you want is a standard bowl of pho', go to PPQ.  Either way, you can't go wrong.", "author": "Tony L."}

I'm a big fan of Kevin's noodle house in Walnut Creek, but I just moved into the city so I was really excited to try it out here. Boy was I let down. First of all, I don't expect much in the way of service when it comes to Pho restaurants, but the girl who helped me, Shu, was not attentive whatsoever. I was given hot water upon being sat so I asked for iced water. Doesn't come. I ask the person who drops off my pho for iced water. Doesn't come. I flag down Shu again and finally get my iced water. Lets not even talk about trying to get a refill. That's another story in itself. I ordered the 22A, which is just your basic chicken pho. It was disappointing a well. While I've always been a fan of the food and service at the Walnut Creek location, this pho was much more bland here. As for the sprouts and basil on the side, they did not look fresh and were slightly wilted. I almost asked for a new set up but I didn't want to be a pain and figured I probably wouldn't get it considering how hard it was to get a glass of water. When I asked for a diet coke though mid-meal that was brought rather quickly. (Maybe cuz I'm paying for it??) All in all, if I check out Kevin's again it will be back in the east bay, definitely not this location. Too many other good options in the city.", "author": "Nick M."}

The moment we sat down, waters and menus we in front of us and within a couple minutes we were all ready to order. I got a # one with beef balls, which is simply a combiniation pho containing the regular suspects: tripe, beef slices, tendon and beef brisket; I really felt like beef balls that night so I got an addition order of those, which seemed to be the popular choice seeing how half the table did the same.\nIn any case, the food came out within 10 minutes and having experienced a number of extra large bowls throughout pho places from norcal to socal the bowl I got seemed generous for the price that  I got it for ~ 7$ for a decent bowl, which really meant I had nothing to complain about the size haha. \nNow the first thing I do whenever I get a bowl of Pho is mix the contents and try the soup. Of course the soup is going to smell amazing, but that's because the whole room is already filled with the smell of all the aromatic ingredients that it took to make the broth. Anyway, the broth was delcious: rich and flavorful, you could tell that they actually brewed for atleast a night because you could taste all the rich flavors of the spices and meats. \nOverall, this place really hit the spot and the rest of my team can vouch; would I come again?

May warts grow all over the feet of your proverbial walks in life.\n\nMoving on.  Were it not for the cursed place I mentioned above, Marina and I would not have found our way over here.  It was around 9:15 on a Saturday night.  We found parking about a block away.  We had previously been shopping in Union Square.  I was getting a suit (grown up clothing!) and she got this nice pair of knee lenth clam-digger type jeans.  All on sale.  \n\nAfter attempting to go to Chez Papa Resto and realizing how incredibly small that place was, we looked around at another french place before getting in to the car.  Whilst in the car, I told her about the amazing broth of pho.  It was spiced, cinnamon, anise, a bit of cardamon.  I sold it so well that we headed straight for the sunset.  \n\nThere was a false start (and we'd found such GOOD PARKING too), we ended up here.  I was famished.  Hadn't eaten since noon.  Not even a snack.  I ordered the Imperial rolls and the fried chicken wings.  The imperial rolls were nice and compact.

I'm talking about the biggest wings ever.  The drumette looked like a full size leg drumstick.  \n\nAnd now the pho.  Marina go the Pho Tai.  I got the Pho Tai Gan.  This time I paid more attention to the tendon.  This place had nice juicy thick pieces that quivered and shook in my unsteady hands.  The tendon was substantial and not chopped up in to sliced like the TL plcaes. It was something I could sink my teeth in to.  \n\nI made sure to sip the broth before adding anything.

Not all pho broth has to taste the same.  \n\nLet us not allow pho broth to go the way of expensive trendy wines: suiting the tastebuds of that guy who gives out points just so they get a high score.

Funny.  Anyway, the flavor is different now... slightly sweeter broth, but more robust than in the past.  The only downside is that the soup was way too oily...  You could see lots of oil bubbles on top when it was served.  It made every flavorful spoonful feel heavy, which I am not fond of when it comes to pho.  On the plus side, they allow you to have the rare steak on the side, so you can control how well-done you want the meat.  I like mine at a medium.\n\nThe bowls got bigger (good) as did the price (expected).  I didn't try anything else, so this is not based on the other things they offer, but simply on the Pho Tai, which is my benchmark for pho places.\n\nAnyway, the service was still pretty fast as is with all pho restaurants, but it was not the infamous 30 second speed of order-to-served pho like back in the day with Pho Hoa Hiep 2.", "author": "Warren L."}

But, what brings me here is the fact that my husband and I found ourselves raving about the soup we had last night at Kevin's Noodle House.  You know how you know something is rrrrreallly good when both parties can't stop saying 'Wow, this is realllly good!'  Case in point - that's what happened last night.  I was craving something warm and clean, so we ventured to Kevin's because after all the pho places I've been to, his broth is the best tasting, non-MSG-flavored out there.  \n\nThe only reason I give it 3-stars is I still have serious issues with the bucket they push around the place when they're clearing off tables. I know it's efficient and it needs to be done, but  honestly, I just don't want to see dirty dishes while I'm eating a yummy bowl of pho.  It's not enough to drive me away, but it does make me consider wear a shield or something to save myself from the splash-back.", "author": "Jana H."}

What a great choice this turned out to be. It had beef balls, slices of beef, tripe, and beef fat with plenty of noodles and plenty of broth. It was supposedly a medium but boy was I stuffed. And I had been holding back on my caloric intake the rest of the day in preparation, but I was still stuffed.\n\nAnd then the bill came. Of course, mine was cheap, $6 or something. But then my dining companions pulled another one out of their hat and were trying to short the bill. $22 for a $20.40 bill? I think not.

One may be fooled into thinking these are your typical eggrolls from your favorite chinese dive, but you will be happily surprised by the rice paper they use.  Its the thin translucent kind, not the yellow parchment paper.  Wrap these bad boys up in some lettuce, pop in some springs of mint, a quick dip in the nuoc mam (orangy fish sauce) and be on your way to eggroll heaven.\n\nIn conjunction with the tasty fried treats, they by far, have a lock on their beef noodle soup.  You can stray away and try to get all the fancy smancy soups, but they definitely have the right combination for their special soup (dac biet).  Usually positioned at the top of the soup list, the #1, it's your basic noodle soup combination special with flank, brisket, tripe, and all that good stuff.\n\nDefinitely the spot to hit up Saturday morning after a long festive evening, the soup here will replenish the fluids to the bones.

Actually, they probably have been. So, we always end up having to dilute them with tea. Well, this time I actually ordered the Vietnamese coffee for the first time and really liked it!

The chopsticks and various sauces were already at the table, the iced coffee is dripping out of the french press at the table, I can order in Vietnamese at the table. and pay at the cash register in the back - just like home!  \n\nRegardless of the surroundings, I have to say the offerings tasted just like my favorites back home.  \n\nRecommendations: \n-Pho Tai\n-BBQ chicken over rice\n-iced Vietnamese coffee", "author": "Dong T."}

Fast service, friendly atmosphere, and good food. I've eaten a lot of pho in San Francisco, Davis, and San Jose, and I can honestly say that.. this place is definitely top tier, amongst one of the best pho places I've ever been to. As a humble little boy, I did not like pho.. I would prefer the most blandest rice plates over pho anyday. However, once I moved to San Jose for half of my college years, I developed a taste for this type of food.. beginning in San Jose's Lees Noodle House. Ever since my love for pho bloomed, I've been searching for the best pho. For many years pho has been kinda the same everywhere, with varying degrees of soup and noodle thickness, and my love for pho has just been kinda .. yanno unexciting and standard. When I revisited Kevin's Noodle House after my passion for pho flourished, I realized that this place has some of the best noodles of the bay! \n\nThe #1 pho is very good. The meat is very tasty, the soup is very savory sweet, and the noodles are perfectly balanced. These three things culminate into one very satisfying meal, be it breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even for all 3 meals. The pho is also quite cheap, price tag at around 8 dollars. very worth it. \n\nI would also recommend the rice/vermicilli plate with the charbroiled pork and egg roll. The meat is very tender, very juicy, and very delicious, while the egg roll is very crunchy and refreshing from the inside.. kinda like how spring is like. One gets the euphoric feeling of spring time when eating this plate. A nice warm sensation, like being under a tree under the bright sun.\n\nKevin's Noodle House is very good.. so good that there was a time when I came here to eat every single day of the week.. with anyone I could find who would be down to eat some pho.. I have no regrets", "author": "simon k."}

Ordinarily, I wouldn't have bothered but on that particular day, I had an extra hour so I decided to sit down and get a bowl of pho instead of quicker lunch options like the nearby pizza place or kfc.  I ordered a large bowl and was surprised when it came out immediately.  I ordered and the food came right out.  I've been back several times since and it never ceases to amaze me how fast the pho comes out.  Within 5 minutes of walking in, I'm eating delicious pho.  I've never been disappointed in the pho here.  Is it the best?  Maybe.  In all honesty probably not, but its definitely better than pho hoa.  The rolls are a bit more hit and miss.  Once my sister ordered the fresh spring rolls and well, there was nothing fresh about them.  But other than that one time they've never been bad, though they're nothing to write home about.  I usually just stick with the pho anyways.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, service can be pretty bad.  But chopsticks, condiments, napkins, spoons, even little bowls are all stored on the table so you don't really need them to do much other than take your order.  It personally doesn't bother me to much but I know it can be a sticking point to others.  My suggestion, drink the tea, keep track of what you ordered and pay cash.  Otherwise you could be in for some long waits.\n\nIt can get crowded and you might be asked to share a table, particularly if you are sitting at the larger center tables.  While I personally don't care for this, its not a deal breaker for me.  \n\nOh, I came here with my Dad one time and he wasn't supposed to eat rice noodles.  They were happy to substitute egg noodles for the rice noodles in the pho dishes despite the existence of a different egg noodle soup menu.  So they have that going for them.", "author": "Bryan P."}

The beef broth they use is excellent - extremely flavorful, with the full complement of spices you'd want it to have.  The price is right, starting from $5.25 for a small, and with your choice of sizes.  The lemonade is excellent.  The service is fast, and the restaurant is quite clean and pleasant, for a cheap pho spot.  But I'm subtracting a full 1.25 stars and deciding against making this my pho go-to because the beef itself does not taste as fresh and flavorful as I think it should, and the bean sprouts should have been fresher, too.  It's fine - the pho as a whole makes for a great meal - but I'm convinced there's better out there, even if \"better\" is all the way down in San Jose.  So I'd definitely encourage others to visit this spot, and I plan to return in due course, but not until I figure out whether I can do better  for pho tai in SF.", "author": "B L."}

When I order the plate with the chicken it becomes a hands on dish because i end up using my hands to eat it. The also make a mean eggroll and less greasy and a lot more flavorful than some dim sum places that I have been to. \n\nThe Chicken soup that comes with most dishes is really good as well, it has some sort of leaf and onion at the bottom and when you finish drinking the soup, the onion is nicely cooked. A little bit salty as well. \n\nOne of the waiters is kindly old man that walk around and takes your orders fast.\n\nThe food comes amazingly fast. \n\nOne main gripe is that parking can be annoying as hell because this place is so close to 19th avenue and to other shopping areas.

I asked for the chicken and shrimp pho. The broth was fine, so were the noodles, but the shrimp was borderline unedeble. They tasted so fishy if you closed your eyes, you could not tell it was shrimp besides the texture. And the chicken- oh God! Good chicken is mellow, not flavorless, but mellow. What they gave me was the most gamy tasting chicken I have ever had. When you ask for chicken, they give you chicken- not all meat either. The intensity of the gamminess was not like anything I have ever had. I have been to my fair share of Asian restaurants and have had some gamy chicken, but this literally lingered in my mouth 10 minutes after I ate it.", "author": "David D."}

My hubbie was under the weather and I also wasn't feeling good. I suggested cancelling our dinner plans and go for some hot pho to kill all the virus that was inhabiting our bodies. I Yelped of course and found several places on Irving. What the heck, lets just drive there and park. That is what we did. No problem finding parking. Went into Tuttimelon and asked the lady there what she recommended in Pho places here. She said the PPQ down the street. So we went all the way down the street and saw the restaurant. Long story short, since we were on the right side of the street and PPQ was across the street, we decided to go to Kevin's Pho  directly in front of us. Why waste more energy to cross?\nWe were seated immediately. I ordered the pork chop, egg roll, 2 fried chicken wings, over rice. My hubbie had the combo small noodle. Everything was very good. I finished mine and well he couldn't finish his to my surprise. Definitely be back again. $15 for both of us. Not bad for New Year's Eve!", "author": "Mauling W."}

If you are looking for good pho and can't make the trip to San Jose (East Side represent!), skip the phake pho places around town and come here.  It is the closest thing to decent San Jose-style pho you are going to find in the city.  They understand the secret that other SF places do not seem to grasp = GOOD BROTH.  Despite the heavier than usual layer of oil at the top, this broth still comes out tasting light and flavorful with just the right amount of spice and meatiness.  Service is super quick and efficient and the noodles are of a good texture and suitable quantity, plentiful and not stuck together in a clump at the bottom, but flowing freely about in your bowl with some friendly hunks of green onion thrown in for good measure.  Minor oversight: the basil was wilty and served sopping wet, in need of a quick shaking off before being thrown onto the herb plate.  Other than that, nothing really to complain about here... pretty standard issue stuff with above average broth.  The Vietnamese iced cofee is STRONG and delicious.\n\nIt is indeed a wiser decision to come here for pho tai rather than PPQ across the street, though no one can outdo PPQ for their #8 curry chicken vermicelli soup...\n\n3.75 Brothtastic hot cocks (rounded up to 4 for SF-curved ratings)", "author": "Molasses C."}

And everything else will be compared and judged according to it.  That's how I am with Pho.  Pho is definitely a meal that I crave consistently and recurrently.  And so far, I haven't found any Pho broth that satisfies me as completely as Tay Giang's.\n\nOn a cold and rainy evening, my husband and I decided to try a new Pho restaurant.  Based on the Yelp reviews, we decided to venture our palate at Kevin's Noodle House, with much anticipation.  The place was clean, bright and spacious.  And the service was fast as many mentioned.  As usual, we ordered our Vietnamese egg rolls to start off the meal, followed by a Pork rice plate for my husband and a Beef Pho for me.  \nI will admit that this place delivers a good tasting Pho broth.  In fact, it probably features second on my list of \"Pho\".  The portion was generous for the price.  If I were to rate the Pho alone, I will probably give this place a \"4 stars\".  However, where it lost a star was on the Egg rolls, and the quality of the ingredients as presented on the appetizer and the rice plate.  The rolls didn't taste authentic Vietnamese at all- more like \"Fast food style egg rolls\" with meager bits of carrots, cucumbers for garnish.  My husband's rice plate tasted good, but again it looked \"Fast foodish.\"  \n\nThat is why Tay Giang's still stands strong on my list of favorite Pho restaurant in the city.

Great remedy for hang overs! Their broth is flavorful and portions are usually generous, but not consistent so be smart and just get a medium/large. I usually order the raw thin sliced beef and tripe. I get extra meatballs added in! \nTheir bun thit nuong is average. Nothing special about it. Definitely doesn't have a wow factor for me because the flavors are really ordinary in the marination of meat. Its not the best here, but its a good alternative if you're looking for a healthy dish. Theres a lot of veggies! =) Its pretty much a vermacelli noodles on top of a salad topped of with bbq shrimp and bbq pork. Ok, it was a little exaggerated with the salad thing but there are quite a bit of veggies!\n\nAs for service, its typical asian service. \"What yooh want?\" Make sure you ask for water with your order, otherwise it might take awhile before you can waive someone down. Although you don't get attentative service as American restaurants, your food comes out pretty fast. So no worries if you're hungry.\n\nDownside: Drinks. They need a lot of work on their drinks. Their shakes aren't that great. I ordered an avacado shake once and it came out really powdery(Rating: below avg). The 3 other drink orders at our tables came out the same. I also have had their fresh young coconut, which contains more ice than juice or coconut meat(Rating:barely avg). I also have had their fresh lemonade. No restaurant can can ever mess up a lemonade.

The food is always good, the prices are low and the service is outstanding.  I've tried most of the pho dishes on the menu, and I've enjoyed them all.  There are some really nice combinations combining four meats with your choice of rice noodles or egg noodles.  The broth is usually clear and tasty with no hint of MSG, and the ingredients are fresh.  I prefer the thin egg noodles because no matter how long I let them sit in the broth, the noodles stay fairly firm and chewy.  I like the fact that most of the pho dishes come in three sizes (small, medium, x-large) because sometimes a medium bowl just isn't enough.  The chicken meat on some of the combinations is sometimes a bit tough to chew, but that's probably the ONLY negative thing I can think of to say about this restaurant.

I usually order a small bowl of pho with thin slices of steak (#17 - Pho Tai), which I have delivered \"on the side\" so that I can place the slices of meat into the hot broth to better cook them to my specifications. The waitstaff are very accommodating of this request. Also, it was here that I first tried Vietnamese iced coffee w/ condensed milk (#57 - Cafe Sua Da), which has recently replaced the white mocha as my favorite coffee beverage.

To PEOPLE WHO DON'T COOK or EVER grew up Eating PHO & OTHER Vietnamese dishes: Please DO NOT spend your hard earned dollars on this terrible excuse for a Vietnamese noodle house.\n\nFor starters, I came here on a QUIET night.  The staff was completely slow and Forgetful! There was a total of only 6 tables in the restaurants (wasn't even late night).  They mixed up our order and forgot water & vegetable condiments.\n\nSecondly, There \"Summer rolls\", the ones with the shrimp wrapped in rice paper was completely a rip-off and overpriced for what you are getting! It was the NASTIEST I've ever eaten in my life.  They mislead me as the consumer and I should have demanded my money back!\n\nAll they put in it was: Shrimp, lettuce, rice vermicelli noodles, and a few semi/spoiled bean sprouts! That's it!!! According to the menu (and from personal experience making it at home), it's suppose have: pork, lemon basil, mint, & green onions! NONE of these were present! All that was included was CHEAP ingredients that pretty much only costs $4 dollars buying at the store and then making them at home, however, in return you're able to make 25-30 rolls instead!\n\n\nThe thing that makes me the angriest the most was the Beef Pho! Never have I ever been to a Viet restaurant that was SO CHEAP and STINGY!!! DON'T even consider it as PHO!!! ALL IT WAS: FLAT RICE NOODLES WITH SOME RANDOM BEEF CUTS TYPICALLY FOUND IN PHO AND WITH BOILED HOT WATER OVER IT! THAT IT!!! Oh and here's the PLUS side, instead of giving you a lot of noodles, they decided to \"save\" by slicing up more BEEF TRIPE than anything else for the dish.  Instead of picking up layers and layers of noodles, you're actually picking up \"lots of thin layers of tripe MADE TO LOOK\" like the noodles! Isn't that great? I'm an \"adventurous eater\" but come on! Why did they have to go so far and rip people off, even with the noodles? The noodles ONLY cost anywhere from .50 cents-.95 cents a pack (probably even cheaper).\n\nThat's right! even with all of the condiments on the table it still tasted bland and nasty.  As a cook, if you don't have the base of a dish started, all hope is lost for the entire dish! In other words, if you are so lazy to even \"make\" the beef broth for the dish, there's no point trying to \"pass\" off the dish as authentic, but of course this place did! \n\nNEED I say more? I really hate putting down Asian restaurants, but I swear! The Chinese, Thai, & Vietnamese restaurants in THIS town really play to their roles as the stereotypical STINGY, CHEAP, & DIRTY Asian establishments as they are!\n\nUnlike the \"average\" resrauntraur, I been cooking ALL of my life and I rarely eat out, PLUS worked in restaurants when I was younger, I know what I'm talking about!\n\nIf I could give this place a ZERO STAR, I would!

I don't go to another other place in the city or San Jose for pho but this one! The pho comes out within 5 minutes and it tastes so good for those foggy cold San Francisco evenings! The soup base is perfect and the prices are pretty reasonable. It's about 7 dollars for a medium size bowl that fills you right up! It is usually filled with high school kids on Friday and weekend nights so there is at least a 5 minute wait but normally, there isn't a wait at all.

The noodles were not too soft or mushy, more chevy.. it came with sliced rare beef and the meat was still pink, but starts to cook in the hot soup. SO good and comforting. My other favorite on their menu is the cold vemellicelli noodles with shrimp and pork. Oh so good on a warm summer day.. It's basically a huge salad bowl with lettuce, cucumber, carrots, bean sprouts and a bed of dry rice noodles. You could have any type of meat on top. I highly recommend the bbq shrimp and pork.  The dressing is the famous fish sauce. They put it on the side, so you can add as much or little to your taste. There's so much more that's great on the menu, but these are my favorites.", "author": "Denise L."}

It's more spacious than the Daly City location and seems just a bit cleaner. Pho portions here are HUGE and cheap. I ordered seafood pho and was really surprised that they gave me a decent amount of seafood and it wasn't all imitation crab and fish balls. There were actually big pieces of shrimp and calimari swimming in my soup too! The staff is as friendly as you can find in a pho place; they're helpful but they're not there to be uber-nice, just to make sure that you get your food very quickly so they can turn your table over to the next set of customers... One thing that irked me was that our waitress told me it wasn't possible for her to charge my card minus the cash amount that my sister put down, which is a standard practice since my friends and I do it all the time. Don't tell me it's not possible when the fact is that you don't know how to do it! My sister saw that I was about to have a mini-fit and insisted that I just charge the whole bill, which was fine too but it was the principle of the matter...", "author": "Queenie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-08-19", "description": "Now, I grew up in San Jose, so even though I am not Vietnamese I would like to think that I know my way around a bowl of pho. That being said, this is a very decent place for me to get my noodle fix. The broth is rich and tasty and they load up those bowls with meat and noodles. I usually order pho tai nam, if i'm feeling adventurous I get the tai nam sach. The small is plenty, I think they just give you more broth in the larger bowl. They give you plenty of basil and sprouts and stuff. My only complaint is that my sprouts and basil are always presented sopping wet. I suppose that it's good to know that they wash the stuff but couldn't they put it through a salad spinner or something? Also parking really sucks on Irving so I often find myself debating whether I want to drive the extra distance to go to the one in Daly City or drive around the block 5 times looking for a meter.
