I have been wanting to try Saison for some time now and finally had the opportunity to do so this past Saturday, and here's my review. \n\nFood: specular, every single dish was organismic; my tastebuds were enlightened. Each dish unique in its own way and every single dish was well prepared and presented. I never thought baked caviar and greens would be a thing but, it truly is delicious. I strongly recommend getting the caviar supplement, it melts in your mouth. \n\nService: amazing, from the moment my husband and I arrived to the moment we left, we were well cared for. I would like to personally thank ALDO and GIACOMO for making our dinning experience at Saison remarkable, they really took customer care to another level. Previous reviews mentioned horrible service and pretentious vibes from the staff however, my husband and I experienced no such thing. We both arrived in causal wear and was treated with respect the entire evening: it is nice that Saison does not have a dress code, I find that I eat better when I'm most comfortable.  \n\nDrink: beverage menu on point. I was feeling a girly drink with vodka and asked for recommendations. I was informed that they did not have a drink on the menu that was fruity with a vodka base however, they would make one for me. I was asked by my server what flavors I liked and was presented with a vodka cocktail, I mean that's great service right there: accommodating the customer. And I have the say, that was one of the best cocktails I had in a long time, shout out to the bartender.  \n\nValue: I mean come on, this place is not cheap but, it is worth every penny. You get what you pay for and more. You have to try Saison at least once.", "author": "Tuuyen N."}

And full of contradictions. For a 3 Michelin stars restaurant, I do not want to peel some shrimps myself. And the duck course was way too rare and chewy. The black cod was the rare course that was good. \n\nI think they rely to heavily on the ingredients to stand by itself. Yes the ingredients are fresh and interesting but there was very little \"cooking\" technique involved in serving quite a few things raw. \n\nI would not recommend or return. This is the last Michelin (2 or 3) Star restaurant in SF that we checked out. Benu and Atelier Crenn are much better.", "author": "Tracy L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-03", "description": "My family does an annual triple birthday celebration for me, my dad, and the roommate. (Our birthdays are three days in a row.) Last year, my dad mentioned Saison, so I figured we should try it this year. I made a reservation through Tock about two months prior for our party of four on Tuesday, August 28th at 6pm.\n\nWhen booking, you have to choose between the Saloon or Kitchen, so I chose the Kitchen as I read the Saloon was just the bar area. We ended up sitting at a table right by the bar area, so our table was kind of in between the two. Couldn't really see the kitchen, but we weren't in the bar either. I'd advise asking for a closer table if you want to see the action. We didn't really have a view of the kitchen. Plus, during sunset, the sun is right in your eyes, I had to shield myselfself until it moved.\n\nYou're required to put down a deposit of $88 per person. I believe it's non refundable, but it's applied to your bill at the end of dinner. We opted for No Caviar as I'm the only one that likes it. I did wish this didn't require participation of the whole table as I would have definitely added it if they just let one person. Without Caviar, the prix fixe was $298 each.\n\n*Knifejaw\n*Spot Prawn\n*Tomato\n*Sea Urchin\n*Black Cod\n*Liberty Duck\n*A Broth Made of the Grilled Bones\n*Radish\n*Schmitz Ranch Lamb\n*Fruit, Sundae & Tea\n\nThe menu above is what they offered that night. I had a few dishes I liked, but nothing that blew me away. I enjoyed the sea urchin as I love uni, but combined with the sweet bruleed bread underneath? Some ate the urchin and left most of the bread. I didn't mind it so ate the whole thing. The duck was cooked beautifully, but the skin? Why wasn't it crispy? It ended up being very rubbery, so hard to cut with a knife. The spot prawn was tasty, but messy since we were expected to eat it with our hands. It did come with this sweet dipping sauce I didn't care for, so I ate it on its own. I did love that they included the head as I adore head on prawns.\n\nOur main issue with the menu was the lamb course. Overall, it was fine. Came with a side of Figs as well. But I made a note during the reservation process that one person in our party doesn't eat lamb. So instead, they gave him two chanterelle mushrooms and a squash blossom. Why not beef instead? It was a very sad looking course for the roommate. Also, we had three courses of tomatoes: Ceviche of green tomatoes with seaweed, Orange tomato in ganache with chocolate mint, Tomato inside a tomato. Not sure if they are particularly in season right now, but one course was just not up my alley. It was basically tomatoes in chocolate. I get the play on chocolate covered fruit, but I tried to eat just the tomato without the chocolate. I'm a huge soup person, so the broth was tasty, but super oily. I kind of wanted to scoop off some of the oil.\n\nDesserts were: Raspberries (Fruit), a Peach Sorbet with a splash of Rose, Smoked Cow's Milk Ice Cream with Salted Caramel (Sundae), and a Milk Chocolate Candy Bar with Gold. I enjoyed the raspberries as I adore all berries. Even though I'm not a huge sweet and savory person, the ice cream wasn't too bad. I still ate the whole thing. The candy bar was okay. I'm not a big milk chocolate person, so that was the only dish I didn't finish.\n\nThey started us with a complimentary glass of Blanc de Blancs, which was appreciated. I love a glass of bubbly to start a meal. They also offered two different Teas: Flower tea and Toasted Buckwheat at the beginning and end of our meal. We brought a bottle of Chateau Gruaud Larose 2000, St Julien which they corked for us. Corkage is $100 if you want to bring a bottle not represented on their wine list. They offer the same bottle, but a different vintage, so this adhered to their policy.\n\nGlad I checked another Michelin starred restaurant off my list, but this was a very lackluster experience. Nothing was beautifully presented or an especially luxurious ingredient. Maybe I just went when the menu didn't suit my taste, but out of all the higher end restaurants I've been to, this was one of my least favorites.", "author": "Elena N."}

It's expensive, but it would be worth it if the foods are good. Unfortunately, we came out disappointed. The service is very good, hence the 2*s. \n\nThe restaurant is located pretty close to AT&T Park, so if there's a game or an event happening on the day, traffic would be pretty bad. They provide complimentary valet, so that's a nice touch. We were greeted and seated right away when we came in. The server asked if we have any food restrictions or allergy and we told them that I don't eat salad and my husband doesn't eat fruits. There's no menu to look at and the dinner service began. They gave us champagne to celebrate our anniversary, which is nice. And they also gave a floral tea to start with. \n\nFirst course is the caviar. Later after dinner is done, we realized that we were served this because I don't eat salad. Other people were served some wrap dishes that comes with some fish and other seafoods plus another dish with veggies too. It's nice of them to accommodate my food restrictions, but on the other hand, my husband enjoys salad and wouldn't mind the other dish. In other Michelin star places, they would only replace my meal with non-salad but keep my husband's dish as regular. Having said that, this dish is the star of our entire dinner experience.\n\nNext was the uni toast. The garnish that came with the uni was very salty, it overpowered the uni taste. It's very pretty in picture though.\n\n3rd dish is some sliced radish. It's so not memorable, I can't even remember what comes with it :(\n\n4th course is lobster. It tasted good, but nothing special. \n\n5th course is porcini mushroom. The taste is very bland.\n\nNext is the quail. You eat it with your hand. I wish they give more sauce so it will taste better. The part where they have sauce is better, but other than that it's very bland and messy.\n\n6th course is antelope: 2 different parts. Comes with biscuits and honey butter. The biscuits are very salty. The antelope is okay. The honey butter is the only thing that saved this course.\n\nLast course before dessert is bone broth. It's tasty, but again, nothing special. \n\nDesserts consist of ice cream, ice cream in a fruit and hot tea. The first ice cream(sundae) is with caramel and the caramel might be burnt a bit since it has that bitter aftertaste. The ice cream in the fruit is good, but again, only ice cream for dessert at a 3 michelin star restaurants is pretty disappointing. \n\nI would not recommend Saison at all. If they charge $200 or less per person, I might not be as disappointed. We had dinner at Benu before and the meals blew us away! Every single meal at Benu were impressive while Saison always falls short. Now I know why the reviews are varied for Saison. Definitely a no go for me!", "author": "Prisilia P."}

It exceeded my expectations, and I feel fortunate to have had dinner here. Having gone to other three star Michelin restaurants, this definitely met the same standards. \n\nKey highlights from dinner was the toast. I can't have uni (I'm very allergic!) so instead, I had avocado. A tiny morsel, but insanely delicious! All the desserts that came were incredible, especially the wild strawberries. I had antelope for the first time and ate it with a hunting knife. And last, but not least, can we talk about their amazing playlist they have going? A wonderful collection of '80s music that turned my dining experience into part karaoke. This isn't a pretentious place; you feel like you're in someone's home and are welcomed with lots of smiles and warmth. Definitely do a walk through the kitchen after dinner too. \n\n200% worth it and 200% would come back again!", "author": "Lisa I."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-10-16", "description": "We heard many good things before, but it couldn't live up to the hype in any way. For us Saison was one of the most disappointing 3 star Michelin restaurant experiences we ever had.\n\nTwo main reasons: first, the food was nothing special and simply put boring. Many flavors didn't go well together, things were all over the place during our courses and most importantly many dishes were too simple for the price and not complex/creative enough.\n\nSecondly, the restaurant environment was uninviting. Super loud 80s pop music was playing non-stop, which was annoying during conversations and didn't fit the setting in any way. The music was intentional as one of the waiters explained later to express their unique style. However, everything else in Saison was a most classical 3 star restaurant setup, which made it immensely awkward. If the music would have been incorporated with a more unique/hip interior design it would have been a different story.\n\nThe environment is very cold and my wife was freezing in her dress. They had blankets for everyone already placed on every seat, so this seems to be a common complain. Maybe get a better heating system?\nWhile it was fun to sit very close to the kitchen and watch the chefs, quite often the seating areas would be filled with smoke, since they cook with open fire. A better ventilation system would be nice.\n\nThe service was very good (as you'd expect in a 3 star establishment). Everyone was welcoming and the sommelier did a great job as well.\n\nTo the food. We had:\n\n0. Started with some champagne and tea. Not a good combination.\n\n1. striped horse mackerel \n The mackerel was prepared as sashimi style with some kind of broth. The fish was nearly flavorless and the broth didn't go well with it either.\n\n2. California king crab\nThe king crab was well prepared. Just two bites of crab and a sweet sauce - nothing else. Good appetizer.\n\n3. cauliflower\nIt looked like an interesting cauliflower preparation. They cut and plated it at the table, but the flavor was totally uninspiring and plain. In addition the cauliflower was nearly raw inside and was way too chewy. It was cauliflower taste - nothing else. I could have made that at home in a more interesting way.\n\n4. sea urchin (on liquid bread)\nInteresting and decent dish, unfortunately the sauce of the bread was overpowering the sweet mild flavor of the Uni.\n\n5. king salmon\nCan't remember this dish well. It was good salmon, but that's about it. Nothing particularly interesting about it.\n\n6. additional caviar spinach dish (extra charge)\nThis was Saisons best dish. The caviar was prepared in seaweed leaves and slightly heated, topping some flavorful spinach with broth. This was a beautiful dish and the idea of warm caviar is amazing. \n\n7. squab\nThe squab was good, but somehow it didn't go very well with the side of squash. Both great dishes by themselves, but they didn't work well as one.\n\n8. radish\nMy second favorite dish at Saison. Creative combination of veggies with flavorful fond jelly cubes. Nice!\n\n9. mill brook venison \nThe venison was nicely prepared but there was no no other flavor in this dish. There was a roasted avocado as a side which was possibly the most boring use of avocado I have ever seen in a restaurant. In addition, the had some veal skin chip, despite having a ton of spices on top it tasted like nothing. Overall not a good dish.\n\n10. matsutake broth\nMinimal flavors in nearly clear broth and a nice tasting dumpling inside. Decent dish.\n\n11. fruit, sundae & tea\nBy far the worst dessert I have ever had in Michelin restaurant. The sorbet tasted bad, no one in our party eat more than a bite. The fruits with own sauce were nice, but a bit too simple. The sundae ice cream reminded me of the sundae United serves in business class. The ice cream was decent but, nothing special. Disappointing to get two scoops of ice cream based desserts with no special presentation or twist. Booooooring.\n\nLastly I'd like to mention their final tea: it tasted like my sports socks smell after an intense 2h gym workout. No one drank more than a sip. I have never used this word in relation to a well respected/renowned restaurant, but the tea was an outrageousness and simply put: disgusting.\n\nThey had no espresso available as final drink and no departing gift was given on the way. Out the door they forgot to hand back some things we gave them for the wardrobe - unfortunately we only noticed that at home.\n\nFinal verdict: high quality ingredients but very spotty and inconsistent cooking performance. I'm really wondering how they got their 3 stars. For me that wasn't even a 1 star experience (the service aside, which was impeccable). Overall disappointing and not worth the money. For a special dinner I would recommend Benu in San Francisco or SingleThread Farms in Healdsburg - which is in my opinion the best restaurant on the west coast. They are both cheaper and more importantly magnitudes ahead of Saison.", "author": "Kolja S."}

Let me start by saying everything that made the original review a low-score was changed. Service here was truly elevated above and beyond the level of what is common, expected or needed for any restaurant. Every member of the team was on point, kind, friendly, and left you with a feeling of being welcomed to dine at Saison.\n\nOur experience was helmed by the wonderful Noah, a man that truly understands what it is to interact with a customer, engage, and bring a sense of belonging - things not typically seen in the industry. In the top 3 best service experiences for me ever - for many reasons. Above all, Noah was extremely knowledgable, had detailed answers for every question our hungry minds had for him. It changed our visit from a meal to an actual *experience*. Everyone that supported Noah that night was also friendly and chatty, responding to anything in a gregarious manner. It was exactly what should be done at other fine dining establishments. \n\nWe had a delightful view of the kitchen and chef leading the team with great guidance. Another drastic change was the menu itself - we were presented with newer plates that visually more inspired - such as the  Abalone served in a gorgeous / very large sea shell. Me and my guest agreed that previous dishes that were served again had more flavor and better execution,  such as the quail. The wine and sake pairings were also on point, matching very well with each plate. I cannot being to tell you how delicious, savory and more, the caviar plate is at Saison. Highly recommended, tied for my favorite caviar dish of all time (next to TFL).\n\nMy guest and I agreed, that everything from the previous visit has been rectified and I would highly suggest Saison to anyone for a visit. Thank you Thatcher and Noah for the great adventure.", "author": "Jonathan Q."}

The food and the pacing were on point.  The smoked caviar was life changing.  The memories of the lobster roll and uni toast still make my mouth water to this day.  We left dinner that night dreaming of a repeat performance. \n\nWe are not wealthy, nor are we from San Francisco; so these experiences take planning, scheduling, and saving.  What's more, this time we were bringing my partner's mother -- her first experience into fine dining.  Once we booked the table for round two, we spent the next several weeks looking forward to round two of the culinary adventure that Saison would take us on.\n\nAlas, sequels are rarely better than the original. . .\n\nFor round two, there are still several high points.  Firstly, the Saison reserve smoked caviar is still transcendent -- smokey, briny, and perfectly balanced by the most tender braised spinach.  It's well worth the supplemental cost and remains the highlight of the meal.  \n\nThe caviar is followed by a forgettable ceviche, and then they served a spot prawn which was grilled whole and dressed in a sauce with a second peach dipping sauce on the side.  This is a very confusing dish. \n there are two sauces for a very delicate protein.  The peach sauce was much too sweet and overwhelmed the delicate sweet/briny flavors of the rare prawn.  The sauce on the shell did not add much to the flavor either (although it tasted almost like a barbecue sauce as I licked my fingers), as it was peeled off with the shell.  A good concept, but poorly executed.  \n\nThis was followed immediately by a trio of riffs on tomato dishes.  Two were highly forgettable, and one was just terrible -- and I say \"terrible\" without any hyperbole my my part.  Tomatoes with a chocolate \"mole-ish\" sauce which, when eaten together tasted bitter and muddy.  The tomato by itself was good.  The chocolate sauce by itself was good (and would be delicious on a small bite of pork belly), but the combination was a disaster.  \n \nThe fish dish after the tomato course was good.  But the duck course after that was another stumbling block.  The duck had perfectly rendered crispy skin, but the meat was stringy and chewy.  The accompanying romanesco was delicious and I greatly enjoyed it.  \n\nA light radish intermezzo followed the duck which was accompanied by a gelee that was much too savory and overpowered the radish.  Another miss. \n\nThe other strong dish of the night was the second protein -- a very well cooked lamb and squash blossom that was quite tasty; but by this time, the crew at Saison had lost my enthusiasm.   The meal had gone on for much too long (over 3 hours -- poor pacing!) and it had served too many misses and I was over it.  \n\nI get that everyone has an off night and I'm sure it happens, even at a venerable institution like Saison.  However, given the price and the effort it takes to come here, I won't be back to take the risk.", "author": "Shaun L."}

I wouldn't consider it a customized menu based on preferences- it's a rather set menu as everybody had the same things. I enjoyed how flowers were incorporated and the variety of the cuisine. The antelope was amazing followed by the antelope bone broth. Only critique would be to ask what each guest likes and does not so it's a more tailored approach. I also don't drink but they had various non alcoholic drinks which was a nice touch for me.\n\nFrom the first course through dessert nearly everything was exceptional. In my 2-3 star experiences I find some part of the meal is always somewhat mediocre. I truly felt everything was so fantastic and well thought out.

Note:  We had gone to TFL to celebrate my birthday in October, so it's hard not to conpare the 2.\n\nIn September I was able to was able to easily book a table for 3 in Decmeber.\n\nI do like how there is a NO dress code.  \n\nThe restaurant is located near the ballpark.

It will be nice to balance each course or across different courses with a bit of sweetness and acidity. To be fair the honey butter served with biscuits and antelope was really good. Two desserts are dairy based and both quite rich. I enjoy the texture and flavor of the ice cream. However, it would be nice if the mandarin dessert can get more refreshing, say a sorbet of good consistency with a bit of lemon zest or something. \n\nPresentation: my favorite plating is the pea soup. Very simple yet elegant, food choice of the glassware! Least favorite plating is for the cod. I guess it's because of my trypophobia. That plate made me feel quite uneasy. Most of the platings are quite simple, I actually appreciate this \"minimalism\". \n\nCreativity: they tease the diners a lot, have to say. There are two dishes no utensils were served, you get to use your bare hands to tear the meat, totally savage, loved it! One dish you get to choose your weapon to cut through the antelope. Fun! For the fish sashimi dish you get to mess around with the favors yourself, as they give you some autonomy to manage your own wraps. \n\nService: fantastic service.

It's a lot less formal in some ways than, say, Benu - for instance, at one point they give you half a bird and have you eat it with your bare hands.  So if you're looking for a traditional fine dining experience it may not be your thing.  But this is a fun, playful approach to food that I really appreciated.\n\nThe aforementioned half quail that you eat with your bare hands was really good.  The uni on toast was excellent.  The tuna dish at the start (which you assemble yourself and can kind of play around with different flavours) was also really nice, as well as the lobster.  The antelope broth was really good too (I may have even liked it better than the antelope itself).  Less amazing but still good: the vegetable dishes, the biscuits that came with the antelope, and the desserts. \n\nThere were some cool little touches like having you pick out a hunting knife to cut the antelope.  The amount of food was perfect, I was comfortably full by the end.  My one complaint is that for the price, I feel like there could have been more (if smaller) dishes - I think the tasting menu was a bit shorter than similar places I've been.\n\nI didn't have the wine pairing but I had two cocktails which were probably an order of magnitude less expensive, one was the milk punch and one was something the bartender made up to pair with dessert.  They were both excellent and didn't overpower the food. \n\nThe service is impeccable - they have all the little touches like having your car ready for you when you step out the door.  But it doesn't feel stuffy, they make you feel very comfortable. My brother and I were maybe a little out of place among the mostly much older people in the very serious suits who seem like they do this sort of thing all the time, but we were made to feel very welcome.\n\nWe could only get seats in the salon at a time when we could both make it, and I was worried we'd have a worse experience.  But the salon is literally some upholstered seats on the bar side of the room, right next to the seats in the \"kitchen\" area.  It's a much smaller room than I expected.  So that wasn't a problem.\n\nOverall I'd say it was definitely worth it, and given the price (and I paid) that's saying a lot.", "author": "Sanae R."}

I just don't understand why Saison charges so much compared to its peers. It was good, fine, but simply not worth the price tag. Many of the courses outside of the private batch caviar were solid, but unmemorable - and sometimes confusing. The uni course (cold, savory uni cream on a warm piece of toasted bread) stands out as particularly unsettling for the stomach. \n\nI will say dessert was more memorable than the other courses.

A very expensive birthday this year, indeed...\n\nI must say though the whole experience was fantastic, and we felt like we were treated like royalty with their attentive service. We particularly loved how the restaurant, although upscale, was not stuffy nor pretentious. I loved how cozy it felt and it was fun watching the staff work swiftly in the open kitchen while listening to some good 'ol Michael Jackson songs.\n\nMy fiance and I have been YOLO-ing it up this year and have been trying a lot more Michelin starred restaurants. We knew we were moving out of SF the end of the year, so we decided to take advantage and try all the food! Especially with Saison located literally a block away from us.\n\nThe food overall is delicious, but definitely more on the heavier side. 3/4 into the meal, I could barely eat. Saison is known for their fire program/smoking their food... it seemed like they smoked/charcoaled every single dish so it also got a little tiring for me towards the end. They are known however, for preparing food using any method other than a stovetop! Pretty neat. \nMy favorite part of Saison is the dessert. Be sure to come on your birthday because they make their grown up version of 3 musketeers. Most. Amazing. Chocolate. Ever. Gahhh... I would seriously buy that every month if I could. I also LOVED the yuzu ice cream. Not to mention it was so beautifully presented. As you can see, I have a sweet tooth.\n\nIn terms of the savory dishes, I really enjoyed the toast topped with uni and the grilled prawns. If you like a lot of meat, you'll for sure enjoy Saison. We also had quail and some gamey meats which I did not enjoy as much (just a personal preference).\n\nDefinitely worth the experience! I would probably come back in a few years, as this is a very expensive treat :)", "author": "Janet H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-16", "description": "I had a really fantastic birthday celebration here and it coincided with the end of my SF Michelin adventure (there are 33 Michelin starred restaurants in SF and I wanted Saison to be the last on the list). I can definitely see why this place is consistently rated the top restaurant in SF.  It's top 2 for me (the other one is Atelier Crenn).  \n\nAll of the top restaurants in SF have their own personality and Saison to me feels distinctively Californian.  The menu is straightforward and consists of the best ingredients cooked perfectly:\n\n(1).  Lobster lettuce cups (5/5) - it's lettuce cups but with lobster instead of chicken and with pineapple and flowers.  \n(2).  Uni toast (5/5) - this is probably as close to a signature dish as they have.  Lots of restaurants have tried this (Lazy Bear does a Dungeness crab toast) but the original is still the best. \n(3).  Black cod (4/5) - great flavors on the cod and the crispy skin was fabulous.  The sauce at the bottom was a little salty but that's being really picky. \n(4).  Smoked asparagus (5/5) - fresh asparagus crispy with smoky flavor.\n(5).  BBQ Quail (4/5) - it's better than the one at BENU but it felt incomplete to me.  It resembled Peking duck in my mind so I was probably looking for steamed buns and some sauce. \n(6).  Grilled antelope with biscuit and butter (5/5) - the antelope was really lean but the biscuit and butter steal the show here. It's among the best I've had in my Michelin journey (dinner roll with house cultured butter at Lazy Bear and the brioche with A5 wagyu butter at Atelier Crenn were the other two).  \n(7).  Antelope consomm\u00e9 (5/5) - transition course from savory to sweet.  I really appreciate this. \n(8).  Cow's milk ice cream, smoked and with caramel (4/5) - smoky ice cream was delicious but was a bit heavy. \n(9).  Strawberries and Oranges (4/5) - solid desserts but these are probably not competitive with the more elaborate desserts from the other 2-3 Michelin star restaurants. \n(10).  Snickerdoodle (5/5) - they elevated a candy bar and I love the playfulness here.  In most places, this would have been mignardises and I was probably missing that. \n\nAt the end of the meal, I was comfortably full and I felt that the menu, overall, was very balanced. To me, the lobster lettuce cups, the Uni toast, the biscuit/butter and consomm\u00e9 were the best parts of the meal. \n\nThe service was perfect and they really made me feel very special for my birthday. I'm also a HUGE fan of the ambiance here (elegantly casual) and they were playing 80s music (Love it!!!).  Open kitchen was mesmerizing to me.  \n\nThe base menu priced at $298 is competitive with the other restaurants at this level. You can also buy the caviar dishes as a supplement (I did not since I'm not really a caviar person).  They also did a non-alcoholic pairing for me - I consider this a real differentiator and skill demonstration for restaurants at this level.  They also gave me a sealed envelope with the night's menu (high-level, but not detailed and could have been personalized) on my way out. Highly recommended!!!", "author": "Andrew S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-28", "description": "Food for thought, don't book the 9:30 seating.  By the time we got to the fourth course, I was ready to call it a night. I spent a significant time wondering, where was our next course.\n\nIn short, the food was good, service was outstanding, definitely better than Per Se, but was it worth $550 (cost of meal and one cocktail); unfortunately, no. I truly didn't feel like the ingredients used warranted $550 bill per person.\n\nThe dinner started off with a glass of complimentary (if you call it that) Champagne, followed by infused herb tea in a very nice teacup (hmmm, maybe we were paying for the usage of dinnerware). \n\nThe first course was made with Saison's private batch of caviar served table side with kelp and greens. The server put our dish together by mixing the caviar and left a substantial amount on the spoons that he was using. My cousin and I were both thinking, there's enough caviar left on those spoons there for another dish. Why give us two new spoons when you could have given us those spoons to eat with. Super wasteful; I want to pay for food that gets into my stomach not have to account for your waste. Other than that disappointment, the dish was super delicious!\n\nSecond course, poached king crab. Very small portion but a burst in flavor. It came with a side, unfortunately, I don't have the best memory and I didn't make a point to write it down because they said they would give us a menu at the end of the night of what we ate. I thought the menu would be descriptive but their menu was a reflection of their website; very little information.\n\nThird course, uni on sourdough. Super good.... I really wanted more. It was like a one bite teaser. \n\nNext we were served a corn jelly to replenish the palette. I wanted more of this too! \n\nFourth course, deconstructed ratatouille. We were bought some cherry tomatoes, eggplant with diced olive, bell peppers and squash served on four different plates. This was my least favorite dish. I didn't care for the flavor or the concept.\n\nThe dinner started off so strong but it kind of went down hill from this point. The fifth course was a small piece of BBQ quail. The flavor was there but I don't see how this fits into a $550 meal. I feel like I could have ordered this or cook it at home and would have been just as good, if not better. It was served with a side of biscuits. The biscuits had way too much herb on top and it was a little dry. \n\nSixth course was Pronghorned Antelope served with some radicchio. I was so excited to finally get some meat but my excitement quickly faded. The antelope was ok, the radicchio was ok; together, it was an annulment waiting to happen. It definitely did not meet my expectations.\n\nAfter eating the sixth course, we waited quite some time for our seventh. We spent much of this time just watching the Chefs clean. I'll give them 5 stars for a clean kitchen, that's for sure. I mean, they were really scrubbing and getting every crack and corner; I don't even think my kitchen is as clean as theirs. \n\nOur seventh course was a broth made of grilled bones. Although I understand this dish took time, I felt that they could have timed it better. After all, we were the second to the last diners to be served. They brought the soup out in a huge bowl, scooped some onto a small coffee size cup and took the rest away... WTF!!! Did we not pay for that entire bowl? What are you guys doing with the rest of it? They did this with the caviar and now this soup. I know it's an elegant restaurant but there were enough soup there for two or three rounds for the both of us. If you were going to just give us a small cup, serve it in just the cup, don't bring the whole bowl and take it away. What I don't get was that each table was served their own personal bowl, so I know there was plenty to go around. \n\nAfter another long wait, we were shown a burnt pineapple that they said they grilled all day; I was tired and clearly no longer amused. Even worse, when they served it to us, it was so sour, we couldn't even eat it. This was the start of our last and final course; dessert. We were served candied raspberries, tried one and didn't care for more. This was served with some type of sherbet and tarty lemon sauce, which was pretty good; I could've have gone for another serving of that! \n\nThe final dish that they gave us was literally a slice of honey dew on a bed of ice. It was not sweet or anything special. I just don't get it. Why would you want to end an expensive dinner with a flat tasting piece of fruit???? \n\nI'll give it an A- for effort but a D- for price. IMO, they could have accomplished the same meal for about $250-$300. At $250 I would go back and try again but not at $550. \n\nFor $550, I can go back to The Kitchen in Sacramento, and have a much more memorable meal and experience. I still think The Kitchen is the best restaurant ever in comparison to price food offering.", "author": "Tinah Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-16", "description": "Saison was a wonderful and absolutely memorable experience but I have been fortunate enough to dine at various Michelin star restaurants across the globe and honestly felt that while Saison was good, it by no means lived up to the reputation that they have become known for. I personally do not think that my experience at Saison was worth the mind blowingly expensive price tag. \n\nThe service was friendly and attentive and we were seated at a small corner booth over in the bar area where we enjoyed about half our meal. We were then oddly invited to move our table to a spot near the kitchen. Appreciated yes to a degree but still found it to be a little strange. It was almost like when we arrived we weren't \"important\" enough for the seat we were later offered and we kind of shoved in the corner. Just strange.\n\nService was absolutely amazing, but anything less than 5 star service from a restaurant of this caliber would have been frankly unacceptable.\n\nNow on to the food... Not totally memorable. Good but out of the many courses there was only one dish that still remains imprinted on my memory today, for a meal close to 2k that should not be the case. I was expecting walking away from this meal so excited to write my review here on Yelp but it's been months and I have honestly struggled with what I wanted to say on the yelp universe. We were told so many times that items came from their farm that it almost turned into a joke and could have been a fun drinking game and then there was the strange thing of everyone yelling out in the kitchen \"YES CHEF\" every two seconds. They have become known for their Uni Toast but I found it to personally\n be an absolute soggy mess. \n\nI came expecting... wanting so badly to be blown away but I wasn't. After dining here I have started wondering who is awarding Michelin stars to restaurants.\n\nNot worthy of the price tag, not worthy of the reputation.

However, the orange sorbet was flawless - with the sorbet on top, carrying the sweet flavor, and the ice at the bottom, carrying the refreshing taste.\n\nTowards the end, we were invited to take a short tour of the kitchen (and felt the burning hot from the fire, which was used to cook the BBQ quail lol). \n\nService was classic.", "author": "Elaine H."}

We were the second party to be seated in the restaurant.  A glass of champagne was offered to my husband and I to celebrate our anniversary.  Thatcher helped us most of the night and is the definition of what exceptional service should be.\n\nThe food was simply wonderful.  My most memorable courses were the sea urchin toast, reserve caviar warmed in a seaweed blanket, and the antelope served with homemade biscuits and a broth from the grilled bones.  This last dish reminded me of a Filipino dish I've grew up on.  It was like that moment in the movie Ratatouille when the food critic takes a bite of Remy's ratatouille dish and has flashbacks of his childhood.  Yeah, it was that amazing.    \n\nI've read the other reviews and see people comparing Saison to the other restaurants, but would I compare?  Personally each restaurant brought a different experience to my life.  Food at Benu pulled at my heart strings.  The French Laundry had the most abundant dessert course.  Quince unfortunately was not my favorite experience, but I think it was partly because a family with their two grade-school aged children were seated next to us (all the while I was thinking I left my own kids at home to enjoy an anniversary meal with my husband).  Eleven Madison was an unforgettable journey through New York cuisine.  \n\nSaison -- it was exactly what I needed in this moment in my life.  I've been eating clean for weeks before this dinner and Saison brought everything I've learned about clean eating to an elevated sophisticated level.\n\nIt is the most expensive meal we've ever had.  So are you wondering if you should go?  I compare Michelin Star Restaurants to travel locations.  Where would you spend 10 days?  Some would say NYC.  Some would say Paris.  Some would say Hawaii.  It's about what you need and what makes your heart happy.  \n\nFor me, it was Saison.", "author": "Aura J."}

It's $298 per person plus wine etc and to come away feeling meh was so unfortunate. If you want to eat here, you need to call at 8am pacific time 90 days in advance and be prepared to pay $88 per person non refundable deposit. If you cancel, you don't get your money back. If you go, they apply the deposit to the bill. They have a wonderfully large and overpriced wine menu.

I arrived hungry and left hungry as the potions are very small.    Five star service for the staff but that doesn't get you three Michelin stars.   So here is the bottom line:\n- service three stars (but they could explain the food a little more such as sources)\n-  food one star overall.  It gets another star for being experimental but definitely not three stars when I compare it to the 20 or so two plus Michelin's I have been to.  No food I ate will make me say amongst the best ever.   \n-   Wine selection is all top notch and you can easily pay $1,000 for a bottle, but plenty of very good wines for $250.  \nI won't be back, but glad I went so I can check it off my to do list.   \n\nIt gets four out of five stars because it didn't live up to its hype.", "author": "Phil B."}

When we arrived we were about 10 minutes early so we were seated at the bar.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and a perfectionist in making the cocktails - a great experience in itself.  My husband didn't like his first drink, so the bartender suggested a different one and offered to buy it if my husband didn't enjoy it... he did. :) \n\nWe were seated about 30 minutes late but my guess the only reason for that was previous diners were enjoying themselves and lagged a little.  Can't say I fault them with the gorgeous views.  We were seated in a small booth looking straight into the kitchen - fabulous!  The cooks were artists and they all operated so smoothly.

Making a reservation was easy-- I timed it two months in advance while booking my plane ticket.\n\nI didn't exactly know what to expect before dining at Saison, but with the \"come as you are\" mentality stated on their website, I figured that it would be a more fun experience.  Probably my favorite thing about Saison is the unpretentious feel to things.  There was an amazing 80's playlist for music and I definitely felt comfortable rolling up my sleeves for the quail course.\n\nFor food, I experienced:\n\n1) Saison private batch caviar: I'm generally a fan of caviar, and this didn't disappoint.  The smoked salt flavor was wonderful.\n2) Live diamond turbot: sashimi and marinated/grilled.  Presentation was a bit confusing, but the idea was to make \"lettuce wraps\" with the greens, sauce, salt, and chilled lime.  Probably my least favorite course throughout the night\n3) Sea urchin: presented on sourdough bread.  This blew my mind... I could eat it for the rest of my life and not be upset about it.\n4) Naple long pumpkin: Pumpkin prepared three different ways.  Overall a decent dish\n5) Black cod: Obviously small portion, but a wonderful pairing of crisp skin and light flesh\n6) Barbecued quail: Easily the most tender quail that I've ever had.  I had no reservations about rolling my sleeves up as mentioned and really enjoyed this course\n7) Pronghorn antelope: This course began with me selecting a hunting knife to use from the chef's private collection.  I've never had antelope before, but it was to die for.  As a Texas boy, I can honestly say that Saison ruined buttermilk biscuits for me.\n8) A broth made of the grilled bones: A wonderful idea to use the entire animal.  The herbs added to the broth made this delicious\n9) Pineapple: Paired with what tasted like sour cream ice cream.  Very enjoyable.\n10) Fruit and tea: A really creative end to the experience.\n\nTotal for one person was $550 with two cocktails.  I've seen other people complain about the price on here, but I would counter that Saison is a ultra-premium brand and that, while price should reflect a quality of experience, it's also about creating an air of exclusivity as well.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience, but something just felt lacking to make this perfect.  The maitre d', while genuine and kind, came across as unpolished.  Starting and ending with two different teas is rather boring to me.  Lastly, the experience didn't feel like it was given a proper close-out, which may or may not be related to the absence of the sundae noted in the Michelin Guide.  At the end of the day, I'm definitely a fan and glad that I came here.", "author": "Ben C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-04", "description": "We had an exceptional experience at Saison! \n\nTo begin, the restaurant is stunningly beautiful! We were lucky enough to sit facing the kitchen (see pic below). Watching the chefs communicate and work was astounding to watch. When we learned that all of the savory dishes are created WITHOUT A STOVE we were absolutely blown away. Watching the chef place hot coals on a special cooking grate placed over the ingredient they were working with and fan it to create a broiler was fascinating!\n\nThe service: perfect. Nothing more needs to be said. The team of servers were knowledgable, friendly, engaging, and masters of their craft. \n\nWe were greeted with a glass of champagne as the server discussed the experience and what to expect. The cocktails were sensational! The Manzanita bark negroni was exceptional! The Shanghai nights was also fantastic. The Smoked heat was also amazing. Needless to say I was in cocktail heaven. \n\nNow on to the food! In a word, it was exceptional. You can always debate value. And I agree, Saison is EXPENSIVE! That said, this was one of if not the best food experience of my life!\n\nI will go course by course... (each is pictured below)\n\n1: House blend caviar with smoked salt and greens. The caviar was briny with incredible umami. The greens were a welcome balance to the saltiness of the caviar. While eating my wife exclaims... \"Oh my God, I do love caviar!\"\n\n2: Turbot two ways. The Ikejime preparation was intriguing. The texture of the fish was like nothing I'd ever had. It was firmer, more toothsome, and as bright as any sashimi I've ever had. I'll never forget that dish. The second Turbot presentation was the cooked version, served on the backbone, and roasted. It was served with gooseberries two ways. I appreciated the striking contrast between the simple raw preparation and the complex preparation prepared with the sweet and bitter complement of the gooseberries. \n\n3: Giant clam. The clamp was served both sashimi style and grilled. Again, the striking contrast of the two preparations (this time on the same plate), gave me an appreciate of the diversity and beauty of this ingredient. \n\n4. Spot Prawn: Look how beautiful it is. It tasted better. Caught in a bay in Oakland just a few miles away, and sitting in the fish tank in the kitchen alive until minutes before it was served to us, this decapod was sweeter and more tender than any gulf shrimp I have ever had (sorry mom!) .\n\n5: Radishes!! This dish was mind blowing. Yes, it was just radishes. Served three ways. The first was the raw radishes you can see on top. Below, cubed pickled radishes. And finally below those two was \"fermented\" radishes. The way they accomplish this task is intriguing. The radishes are put in sacks that sit above the cook top (the hard wood coals) each evening during service. They roast for approximately 5 days and shrink to a small amount of their original size, which intensifies their flavor. This dish was the most perfect example of simplicity. Three preparations of the same ingredient were topped with clarified butter and absolutely blew my mind. Freshness, tartness, and funkiness all emanating from the same ingredient. Much respect!\n\n6: Brassicas: This green salad was great. The greens were crispy, served with a beautiful emulsion below, and with a crispy element I currently cannot remember. \n\n7: Antelope!! Look at it below. It was perfectly cooked. It was perfectly seasoned. It was tender and juicy. It was served with the most amazing hot sauce and an exceptional biscuit. I could have eaten 5 more portions it was SO GOOD!\n\n8: Broth: This broth was complex and beautiful. It was meaty and perfectly seasoned. At first I was like, \"wait a broth\". Then, when I tasted it, I was a true believer. It was perfect!\n\n9: The ice cream was a beautiful texture, but the star of that beautiful dish was the Carmel. Taken to the edge of bitterness, but not beyond. I took each bite with a different nut and each was more interesting than the next. The nuttiness of the caramel complementing each nut in a different way. I was in heaven. \n\n10: Fruit and tea: The orange Julius, served within an orange peel was great. The Kumquats were good, but I'm not a big kumquat fan. But the blueberries! Simply the most perfect blueberry that I've ever had. And we used to go pick them growing up. \n\n11: Snickers: These put snickers to shame. All home made. Chewy, nutty, and covered with gold. What more could you want. \n\nIn summary, the service and exceptional cuisine made this the most memorable and flavorful meal of my life! Restaurants like this make me want to keep exploring and trying new things.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-08", "description": "I have put off writing this review for a while because I am by no means a huge foodie, nor have I been to too many Michelin star restaurants, but from my experiences at other restaurants I do not think my experience at Saison was worth the price.\n\nFirst off, I agree with other reviewers that the service at Saison was pretty great. The servers were great at engaging in conversation with us and I could tell they were listening in on our conversations to personalize our experience.  I went with a group of 6 and the other 5 had been to way more Michelin star restaurants than I, so they were conversing about their experiences at other places and why they did or did not like the other places they've been to.  I think that as a result, we got an extra round of drinks and were offered a kitchen tour, which was pretty cool!  The chef even came to us at the end and asked us about the food.  I would say, the ambiance and the service and the extra perks we got was pretty awesome.\n\nHowever, the most important part of the experience is the food, and I personally was not a huge fan.  I feel that the servers were not able to explain the dishes in a way that made sense to me, as opposed to my experience at other Michelin star restaurants.  I can say that our courses started out good, with a nice caviar dish, and I was optimistic because I ordered a foamy strawberry drink (forgot the name) that was also pretty bomb.  As the night progressed, though, the courses became more and more \"ok\", nothing special.  Still, I felt like the dishes could have been forgiven until we came across the pumpkin dish.\n\nThe pumpkin dish, my friends and I did not understand.  I think it's because of this dish that we left Saison with a slightly negative opinion.  I still can't describe what it was, but they took a pumpkin and served us three different parts of it.  I think it says a lot that none of my friends nor I were not able to figure out the place of the pumpkin dish.  It was strange to say the least and if I recall correctly, it came after a pork dish, when we were expecting beef or chicken.  We also did not get any beef or chicken at all, which was disappointing.  When I barely touched the pumpkin dish and the servers came to take it away, they did not inquire why I had not touched my food, which I found slightly strange.\n\nSince we did the menu with pairings, for almost $6000 I feel that the meal was not worth the price.  Yes, there was great service, I loved the ambiance, and the extra perks we got (including a copy of the menu and some tea when we left), but when it comes down to it, I really felt that Saison was too pricey for the food.  Although on his Reddit AMA, Gordon Ramsay did mention it was his favorite place to eat in SF!\n\nI think Saison is an experience you should have at least once, but for me, I will probably not be coming back in the near future.  I would be willing to give it a shot again when I'm super rich though :p", "author": "Julia S."}

They also acknowledged my boyfriend's birthday, which I also appreciate very much. Then i ordered a delicious cocktail while boyfriend decided to go with wine pairing. And the story begins...\n\n-caviars (4/5) (extra $88/person) our favorite dish of the night. They were handpicked just for saison. Simple and delicious. \n-DIY spring rolls (2/5) The lobster was good but the crab was mediocre. I really like the fermented pineapple juice as the sauce. However, the bitter greens were too bitter. I wish they could've told us before telling us to start wrapping the spring rolls ourselves. \n-uni toast (3/5) I walked in having very high expectations for this dish. I had something similar in Brooklyn fare in New York and that was phenomenal. However, this one is rather disappointing. It was too saucy and too salted. \n-Cod (3.5/5) it was good but nothing memorable. \n-Quail (3/5) Benu did it better... from texture to flavor \n-antelope (3.5/5) the meat was decent... however the server simply told us, \"this is antelope meat.\" I mean seriously? You can't elaborate a little bit more? Like what part of antelope is it? How should I expect the texture to be since it's very exotic? \n-antelope bone soup (4/5) I am a soup lover\n-desserts (4.5/5) they are all beautiful and delicious. \n\nWhat really makes this place a 3 Star is the wine pairing ($248/person). None of the wines really paired well with the food, let alone enhancing the flavor. It was very disappointing since all the other three star restaurants we went to did such awesome jobs. I seriously hope they would improve that when I visit next time...", "author": "Sasha Z."}

This was hands down the best experience I've ever had in a restaurant!\n\n6/5 for the food\n10/5 for the service\n\nWe started off with a free glass of champagne.  \n\nMenu consisted of the following:\ncaviar course\na sashimi sampler\nthe best uni I've ever tried\nradish and butter\npumpkin 3 ways\nwatusi with bitter greens and hot BBQ sauce\nbroth made of watusi bones\nsmoky ice cream with caramel and toppings\norange cream sorbet served on an orange\nblueberry with brandy and sorbet\nchocolate caramel mouse.\nTwo types of tea from their garden were included with the meal as well.   In the end we had tea in a jar to go.\n\nThe uni was very memorable with a perfect balance of texture and flavors.  The taste was  fresh and savory--it was served with a crisp layer and a soft layer of bread dipped in an amazing fatty umami sauce.  I loved it so much, they gave us an an extra portion each.  I will remember this course for years, and would like to eat it as my last meal if possible.\n\nThe housemade biscuit with housemade butter and honey was also the best I've had.  Every time I liked a dish, they gave us an extra portion.\n\nWe couldn't decide on a port so they gave us a tasting of 4 different types of ports and Madeira including a free one that is usually more than $200 a bottle retail online.  They charged us 38 each (their cheapest glass of dessert wine but gave us some of their collectibles at the 200/glass range.  The waiter hooked us up!\n\nI was also sold with four types of dessert!\n\nWe ended the meal with a picture of us with the entire staff in the kitchen.  The waiter took a selfie of himself afterwords just for fun with my phone.  The staff was so fun!\n\nThis is my favorite restaurant, even though I've been to six 3 Michelin star places so far.  This ranks better than French laundry, Manresa, Quince, Atelier Crenn, Ledoyen and Guy Savoy (Paris).  \n\nI would rank the three star places among a couple other favorites in this order:\nSaison and Guy Savoy (Paris) are tied\nQuince and French Laundry are tied\nLedoyen\nAtelier Crenn\nLa Folie (yes it is one Michelin star but it is amazing)\nCommiss\nAcquellero\nGary Danko (one Michelin star but amazing)\nManresa (I still remember they wouldn't let us try the third macaron--we could choose two out of three for the two of us, even though we were willing to pay extra and it was the end of the night).", "author": "Katherine G."}

The hall and oats playlist buzz in your ears as you sit at a beautiful wood table, chairs that have blankets hung on the backs and the open kitchen that gives one the sense that you just arrived to your friend's home. The service is nice and at times a bit over the top. In the sense that it was too proper and formal- didn't match the vibe of the place. This by no means means that you shouldn't have excellent service, this is Michelin starred, however there is a way to do it so the service is still excellent without it being stuffy. The food is a seasonal journey. Offering the fresh, seasonal items and even featuring what the owner has hunted. Most courses are intended to be made and eaten with your hands. While some might be put off by the \"we don't like silverware\" attitude; it's fun and ties nicely with the relaxed tone. The make your own lettuce wraps with lobster was delicious. Every component played perfect with the protein offering a symphony in your mouth. Hot tea is served at the beginning and end of the meal which was a perfect touch. I do wish that the first round of tea was stronger. The food was not stingy, and was the perfect amount. The uni toast was ok. The bbq quail was absolute perfection. The antelope was delicious and the home made biscuits with honey butter brought the comfort vibe full circle. The fish was ok, a bit too simple - I wish there was some sort of acid with the dish. The desserts were plentiful but the highlight was the ice cream with smoked Carmel sauce. It is always hard when offering extensive tasting menus to execute every dish perfectly, but for the number of courses it did a really great job. It's not hard to see why this place has been winner of Michelin stars. It truly was a treat to dine here.", "author": "Allie P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-04", "description": "Are we having fun yet?\n\nWell, no. Clearly not. The staff working at Saison reminded me of those scenes in Titanic when you got to see the folks below decks shoveling coal into burners as the ship gained speed.\n\nNow, above decks, our party of six was well taken care of, but these solemn faces of the staff members coming to our table from the nearby open kitchen (\"Yes Chef!!!\") (\"No Chef!!!\") looked like the chef's \"pep talk\" of the hour didn't really create the boost in morale he had hoped for. Each time a group ventured over to our table with the next course we were tempted to cheer \"Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!\" for a little encouragement or just adopt the poor fellow as a member of our party so he didn't have to go back to hear from \"Coach Chef\" again.\n\nThe food was wonderful and not! Sea urchin served on really well buttered toast was great, but then if you serve most foods on really good bread soaked in garlic butter it's going to be pretty good. Try this experiment at home: go to 7-11 with really good bread soaked in garlic butter and then put a 7-11 chili cheese dog on top of it. Pretty damn good, right?! Am I right?! Anyhow, the sturgeon caviar on seaweed was out of this world and even the bone broth puzzling served before dessert was very savory. Antelope cooked lean and medium rare is indeed just like beef looked lean and medium rare, but not as cool as saying you ate something with a head rack and then carved at your table with a hunting knife. (\"The chef would like you to use one of his personal hunting knives for this course.\" \"Thanks, but I brought my own?\")\n\nSome flavors were wonderfully fresh. The \"Orange Cream\" served inside a real orange was wonderful and fresh. The black cod served simply and the lobster served with roasted pineapple was also great. But, ending the meal with buckwheat tea that tasted like it had been aged in a bathtub seemed to be a strange last note on the palette that hung around the whole rest of the night.\n\nThe service was indeed excellent and they get bonus points for creating some nice non-alcoholic parings for the non-wine drinker at our table. But, they were so damn somber. How can you be so down with Flock of Seaguls and Billy Idol playing in the background? It made me miss the staff at Gary Danko, which seem to love being there and rightly see themselves as friendly and approachable rock stars of cuisine.\n\nThen there's the bill. It's a lot and it seems to be worn with pride by those that go there. Instead of catching a fish \"THIS BIG\" they go have a dinner that cost \"THIS MUCH\" and that's their fish story, except it's true. Being a local, I have to say that if you are going to spend what Saison charges, you might want to get a limo, nice hotel room and have a better dinner at Gary Danko for the same amount of money. But, that's just me.\n\nSo, Saison Staff, don't despair. Like Celine says about the folks shoveling coal in the bottom of the Titanic, \"Your Heart Will Go On!\" Hopefully, there are only a few \"Yes Chefs\" left for you to say before you move on from your resume building to your more permanent gigl", "author": "Eric W."}

There was only one female working, the hostess, out of the entire staff which was a bit strange in my opinion. It was almost all white men working there....The food was fair compared to other Michelin starred restaurants in SF. The uni toast or avocado in my case was delicious. The broth was much too salty. The dessert was sadly majorly lacking. One scoop of sorbet and one scoop of a smoked ice cream which I hated. The raspberries were the best part. I took a star away as there were no baked goods at all other than the toast which was two bites. We figured that the owner must be saving a great deal of money annually by not having a pastry chef. The baked goods are usually one highlight of Michelin star meal in my opinion. There was no take home as there are at other Michelin starred restaurants other than the menu which did not describe the dishes. We know we ate a \"tomato\" as a course. Give us the details if you are going to print out a take home menu. I would definitely recommend Atelier Crenn for the same price to others.", "author": "Jess B."}

We recently dined at Manresa the forth time and still found the place very interesting and on point. We'd expect the same if not better from Saison. However, a lot of the dishes were a \"meh\" reaction, the antelope was way too salty that we couldn't finish after a bite. The antelope soup was also very ordinary. Uni toast was a disaster, we are big uni fans and the way it was made totally took over the freshness of the uni from the excess amount of sauce. The one dish that we liked the most was the lobster wrap. Desserts felt sloppy comparing to a lot of fine dining restaurants, they could have done a better job than serving ice-cream and sorbet.

I appreciate the concept and foraging efforts, but taste-wise, the food was less impressive than I had hoped for. Perhaps my expectations were a bit high, or perhaps the specific dishes that night just weren't to my taste.\nNow don't get me wrong, there were definitely some incredible dishes. My top pick of the night was the raw lobster, followed by the caviar in seaweed butter. As for the uni toast that everyone raves about... well, it was a bit too salty for me... though it seems like I'm the only one on here who feels that way. Most of the dishes were reasonably enjoyable, but very few were particularly memorable. \nThere were a few dishes that I just could not even eat (which is a first, I'm not picky!)- such as the fire roasted pineapple served at the end. My goodness, I don't think I've ever tasted anything so sour. My cheeks were in agony. I usually enjoy sour fruits and candies but this was too intense for me. Additionally, the plum in creme fraiche dish had this somewhat nauseating effect so I could not stomach it. Neither could my dining partner. Perhaps we were too full at that point. Though... we had no problem eating the rest of the desserts.\nThe service was pretty good. I enjoyed the open view of the kitchen. Didn't see chef Skenes there that evening though. In the end, I would much rather go to Benu. Their service isn't as good but their food is a lot better.", "author": "J L."}

I don't think that this place is a good choice for people who are looking for a place to celebrate when fine dining is an uncommon event. I definitely don't mean this in a condescending way, what I mean is that if you aren't used to cashing out for the experience, it'll be VERY difficult to appreciate the Saison experience. If you're looking for a fancier place to celebrate and fine dining isn't your usual, I would suggest something else (DM me, I'll rec something good!). \n\nNow for my Saison experience. I had a VERY exceptional experience. This meaning that I had a great time but I also had an experience that is not generic to a regular customer. Regardless, I received great service. The staff, every single one of them, was so kind and responsive to what I wanted and needed. Even in the kitchen, I got so many questions answered and I felt welcomed throughout the tour. I learned so much from my servers. There was a story with every dish and I absolutely love that. It's not the run-of-the-mill, rehearsed presentation. \n\nThe wine pairing was so amazing. it was done SO well. I was very impressed. The cocktail that accompanied the antelope had so much substance to hold up. There were pours from France and California, a nice balance of white and reds and sakes. Overall, the food was extremely well-prepared. What topped off the experience was learning about the food. I also got to learn a lot about kintsugi! \n\nBe warned, the pricing is aggressive and if you know how to appreciate it, you'll appreciate it for sure.", "author": "Tina Y."}

The flavors were very good overall, just not the symphony in my mouth feeling.  Here are some of the memorable dishes:\n1. The caviar was super tasty.  They gave a fair good amount and it wasn't that salty.  \n2. The sea urchin was amazing.  It was so fresh and tasty.\n3. The pork in the sauce with the buttermilk biscuits were amazing.  It paired well with the wine (Volnay Premier Cru, 2012)  That was a really good recommendation from the somm.  \nThe tea was amazing.  I drink that for the entire evening instead of regular water.  They also had complimentary champagne. \n\nI was hoping they used more exotic or interesting ingredients.  Sea urchin, caviar, and abalone would be the most exotic of the series of dishes.  However I didn't think they were all that rare or exotic at all.  They also tried to be creative with their dishes.  The pumpkin course was pretty unique.  They prepared the pumpkin in 3 different ways, which was pretty interesting.  I wished I could've seen more creativity from this 3 star Michelin restaurant.  It's more expensive than French Laundry, and I felt that the food wasn't that much better than French Laundry.\n\nThe service is what makes this place over the top (better than French Laundry of course).  I'm left-handed, and they noticed it right away, by placing the utensils according in favor of my left-handedness.  They were so attentive to when you get up from your seat, and they always fold your napkin and pull out the chair when you come back.  Each bundle of herbs for the tea had to be wrapped by hand and they give you a fresh glass each time.  They even handed us purse hooks when we sat down as well.  Probably the only thing about the service was that they could've revealed and placed all the dishes for everyone at the table at the same time, but that's ok.

Before coming here, we had communicated via email with the establishment about my gluten allergies, and I was satisfied with their answer: there are traces of it, but overall very little. When we arrived, we brought up my gluten allergy as a reminder. However, it never occurred to me that Saison would not already know that given that they only have about 30 guests at one time in their dining room, AND we had communicated this to them prior. Our initial table host was stand-offish and cold when he replied deadpan, \"Everything has gluten in it.\" He didn't elaborate. He didn't say, \"We understand and have that noted on your reservations. Although the meal does have traces of it in the sauces/marinades as we communicated, anything that is egregious (such as bread) will be augmented.\" Instead, I had to explain about my gluten intolerance (no bread or pasta) like I wasn't at a 3 Michelin star restaurant. This is my only point of frustration. \n\nThe food is impeccable, but very relatable. It's not the most inventive (except the caviar), but more like using the best ingredients and executing it perfectly. \n\nOther than my first exception, be ready to be treated like royalty by everyone else in the house. The place is sexy, dark, woodsy, and literally smoky (open kitchen and they're known for cooking everything over fire). The music is just right: easy listening, classic rock. The hand lotion in the bathroom is from Aesop. Every man (there are no women working there) is in a crisply tailored suit and groomed to perfection. Every detail is exquisitely planned out, and this is what you're paying for - THE EXPERIENCE. Everyone serves you at some point and knows about the entire menu. Their wine list is extensive, and I want to give a special shout-out to Morgan who helped us on our Chassagne-Montrachet journey. \n\nStandouts include:\n- private batch caviar: this is an add-on, but you can't come here and spend upwards of $500/person and not spring for the last $100. They bring it to you table-side, wrapped in a kelp wrapper and kelp bow, where they \"open\" the present by snipping the bow with scissors and spoon the warm caviar over a bed of seaweed and spinach in a house-made broth that is like dashi. This is by far the MUST-HAVE dish.  \n- black cod: buttery with the thinnest crispiest skin served in a light but savory broth of lime and coconut - reminiscent of Thailand. \n- wildflower honey glazed quail: moist, tender, and juicy, served with no utensils, no adornments, on a stone plate, where you eat it with your hands as all quail should be consumed. This is the perfect example of what I mean when I said the food is relatable. The quail tasted like the best quail I've ever (which is Joel Robuchon's foie gras stuffed quail) and cooked to perfection, but it isn't paired with anything unique or cooked in a special way, same goes for the antelope and antelope bone broth, which tasted like an elevated version of what my mom makes when she reduces an entire animal into a cup of broth over 8 hours. \n\nOverall: this is an experience that one should not miss.", "author": "Patricia L."}

The presentation was phenomenal.\nThe food, however, was another story. I was so disappointed in this place. I was expecting so much more. I have been to nearly every 3 Michelin star restaurant in California, and in all honesty the difference is like night and day. It was so disappointing to leave a restaurant with so many courses hungry.  Everything tasted kind of \"off\". There were even a few dishes I thought were rancid. Completely inedible. \nThe worst part of all, is when one of the staff came to our table with the live crab we would be eating. Why do they do this? So you can see the live creature before it's dismembered alive and then eaten??? What kind of sicko would actually want to see that??? Completely sadistic. We pulled one of the waiters aside and said we do not want the crab dish. Don't bring it out to us. A few moments later another waiter came by and said that's not the crab that they actually serve. Wait? So one of them was lying to us. We told him we dont care and don't bring us any crab. Either was I'm shocked that they would do that. It really bothered us and still does. In San Francisco of all places. \nIn reading some other reviews, seems they give parting gifts as do most Michelin star places. Well, we weren't given anything. \nWill we be back?

My utensils were then rearranged accordingly for subsequent dishes. Pretty epic, huh? Talk about attention to detail.\n\nEvery single dish is heavenly and will leave you craving for more. They are all cooked by the fire, which really brings out the unique flavors of each individual ingredient.

This was one of the largest servings of caviar ever had in a tasting menu with it being golden osetra which is not cheap.  Perhaps best biscuit too which added to the course.

It was served with a boar jus that would have never thought of combining but it worked.  \n\nThe uni toast was a great one bite dish.  \n\nThe other home run was a black cod course.

There is no way to justify a $550 menu when the food is barely good; I am not saying it was bad, I am just saying that it wasn't good enough to justify the $550 the menu costs. First, the caviar I got did not taste that good. I felt I was having some type of caviar imitation from Trader's Joe. Then, the quail tasted just like a regular chicken from El Pollo Loco. Finally, the antelope reminded me of an old bison I bought in Mexico two years ago (it was 50% off because it was not fresh). I left pondering why there is so much hype about this place. The $550 menu should not be more than $155...and even that price would be too much for they type of food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-14", "description": "I really enjoy eating food, but I'm very much an amateur when it comes to fine cuisine, and this was the first time I've ever eaten at any Michelin star restaurant. I tried to write a much longer review, but exceeded the character limit.\n\nThe pros \n-This is the best single meal I've ever had (though several courses were not as good as expected)\n-The staff was incredibly friendly, informative and accommodating\n-you really need to read the cons \n\nThe cons\n-First, I felt nickel-and-dined by this restaurant. They don't advertise their price or a dish list either online or on a menu at the restaurant. After extensive research online, I expected that I would pay roughly $700 per person to include the wine pairing. This was a very tough pill to swallow for me, but my fianc\u00e9 and I did it as a splurge for our honeymoon. Well the actual bill for a dinner for two with wine pairings was $1812 after tax and a $298 \"service fee\". It was a pretty hard blow to be put into a spot where you're spending $400 more than expected for a meal you already feel like you're spending too much for. Also, despite a nearly $300 service fee, they still had a line for you to write in an additional tip. This lack of transparency felt extremely classless, and left me walking away with a very bad opinion of their business practices. I likely would have still eaten here if they advertised the genuine price. Just be honest about your prices.\nFurthermore, I've read several reviews/articles that talk about 20-course meals lasting 4+ hours at Saison, and that's why it's worth being the most expensive restaurant in California. Our meal lasted 2.5 hours and was 8 courses. I just want to make sure you are fully informed before you decide to eat here. I've seen reviews of other Michelin starred restaurants where you meet the chef or get a tour or something. None of that happened here, but you do get a printout if your menu. \nLastly, and this is a minor point, but my wife asked where the lady's room was during the meal, and was informed that someone would be by to escort her to it. It ended up being located literally 15 feet away from our table. For the rest of the meal, it made me unsure if I was allowed to get up and use the restroom myself, or if I had to wait to ask for  an escort like I was in elementary school again. For the record, I ended up just getting up and going on my own without incident. The bathrooms were nice and also very clean.\n\nIn summary, this was the best meal I've ever had, and the staff provided a very pleasant experience. However, I can unquestionably say that it wasn't nearly worth the price, particularly considering how classless they are with regarding to upcharging your bill and being unnecessarily deceptive about their prices. If I were to eat here again, I would not get the wine pairing. If I did, I would share one wine pairing with my wife, rather that each order one. Those are two big \"ifs\", as I will not eat here again, and I do not recommend it. I can honestly say that I will not eat at any Michelin Star restaurant that is not upfront about its pricing and doesn't try to offer meal upgrades for additionally inflated costs. I hope this review was useful to you.", "author": "Richard V."}

After hearing chefs in Japan dying to eat here I thought I'd give it a shot and I am amazed at the caliber of cooking present here. The attention to the finest detail, simplest preparation, highest quality and FRESHEST ingredients is analogous to Japan. Each dish is extremely thoughtful and while most everything is essentially pretty simple and far from decorated/ostenatious, it is all in the fine details and process where Saison shines. To add, all/most of the products are grown on Skenes Ranch and made in-house; the honey-butter, 3-month fermented hot sauce, preserved tomatoes. You're getting ultra quality ingredients cultivated by a chef whom like Japanese chefs, understand the importance of the highest quality ingredients and how its flavor changes over time. \n\nIn terms of cooking, I was aware of Josh's use of fire and roasting over the flames and was expecting a stronger note of charcoal/wood imparted on each dish, but they are incredibly conscious of this fact and use wood that imparts the most mild flavor to maintain the integrity of the dish while adding a slight kiss of smoke flavor. The rest of the dishes were also extremely well thought out, maintaining a balance of the 5 tastes. While some may be against the use of fruits for dessert, it's pretty traditional for Asian cuisine and I appreciated it since any cakes or parfaits would be indulgent. The ice cream and fruits were a phenomenal way to end the meal. \nThe herb tea at the beginning and smoked barley tea at the end were also incredible ways to both start and end a meal; whetting the appetite and aiding in digestion and counteracting the desserts. I would definitely buy the smoked barley tea (and hot sauce) if it were at all possible! \n\nAs for the service; impeccable. Warm, efficient, and jovial. Each dish was carefully explained and chefs were more than willing to answer questions, which I absolutely appreciate. Watching from a distance, everyone seemed to genuinely love their job and the environment created in that kitchen was effervescent. It also helps that they play some AWESOME old music from the 1980s and beyond. \n\nFor those interested in the wine; their wine \"books\" make the French laundry/Per Se look exactly like lists. You get a thick 1\" book for whites and a 1.5\" book for reds; no wonder there's no info on them online. Pairings are available, and they also have sakes which pair really well with the food in retrospect. \n\nOverall, Saison is an experience that I will gladly return to (hopefully each season).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-06", "description": "Oh Saison. I have some mixed feels about you.\n\nAmbience\nThe restaurant has a very strict timing policy where the meal will \"start without you\", so I was surprised to realize that there is probably only enough time for one seating a night. The tables are VERY spread out, and there can't be more than maybe 20 people in the restaurant. Its nice and dim so would be perfect for a fancy date, but I noticed most parties were actually business-related.\n\nWine\nThe wine book here is literally a book. It's dense like the textbooks that gave you hell in college except its contents actually bring inexplicable joy. We settled on three half bottles, which was a good amount for our group of three and we liked every wine the somm recommended. My favorite was probably the Storybook Cab.  The stemware is also gorgeous.\n\nFood\nFavorites were the caviar pudding, lobster, uni toast and duck bone consomme.  The caviar pudding is AMAZING, and you smear its buttery goodness on to this incredibly soft hot bread and it's like a calorie bomb heaven in your mouth. The uni toast is really interesting as well, you don't eat a lot of food in which the uni is actually the *lighter* component. Other dishes I didn't care for as much and I grew a bit tired of the smokey flavor profiles. I also loved many of the desserts, especially the adorable orange sorbet served in its own shell AND the tiny micro strawberries. Those things look underwhelming but they are INCREDIBLY delicious and pack a ton of flavor.\n\nService\nService was very nice and I liked how they weren't too stuffy or formal, but it didn't feel as \"polished\" as Benu.  One thing I do like is that often the chef created the plate often comes and presents it- its so much fun learning about the \"story\" of the food you're about to eat. Also, a fly flew in to my friend's wine (UGH) and they were pretty good sports about giving her a new one. \n\nBathroom\nNormally I don't write about bathrooms but theirs is gorgeous. Also love how they use cotton towels instead of paper towels, and the toiletries smell divine. Also weird- the toilet liners were out. Again not a big deal but surprising for a restaurant of their caliber.\n\nI don't know...for a place where the bill is $1800 for three people I just expected more. I think what did it for me was the fly + not liking a good amount of the dishes. I think ultimately food needs to TASTE good and I think Saison started strong and ended a little weak. It was one of those dining establishments that gets so lost in their zealous technique.  I do think everyone should try it once, but it's not a restaurant I would probably return to.

We were greeted with some 'complementary' amazing champagne and it felt like the staff consistently went out of their way to make it a better experience. Inside the restaurant there is a clear view to both a bar where a bartender is coming up with some cocktails (we tried one and I can confirm they are ) and there is also a good view to the kitchen where you can see the chefs doing their magic.\n\nThe location is not brilliant, with the restaurant not to far from the Giants stadium but inside that all changes. I wouldn't say there were more than 10 tables in total inside.\n\nWe had a set menu (I'm not sure if there is another option) which was incredible. There were two dishes in particular that blow my mind and had flavours I had never even come close to experiencing. I won't spoil the menu as I think the surprise is part of the experience but it's safe to say you won't be disappointed. \n\nMy one criticism is that the music played is slightly strange. The atmosphere is brilliant apart from the fact that casual, low key 80s music was being played. Although they were great songs, it think a chilled out music track like that at Buddha bar would work better. We asked about it and it seems that the chef is into that music which explains a lot.", "author": "Michael C."}

At a fraction of the cost, as well - which is a bit of a sticking point, because for the price you expect an equivalent bang for your buck. \n\nDid I just expect too much? Maybe. I just hope it's not chef Skenes resting on his laurels perhaps, or that he's too busy building up his farm/restaurant/whatever in Napa instead. With so much fantastic dining out there to be had, not sure I can in good conscious recommend Saison as-is. And I'm seeing now based on other reviews I may not be the only one.

It's a perfectly good restaurant and nice experience, but also a total rip off.\n\n$1200 for two people when it's worth $600 for two people. As easy as that.\n\nI've been to about ten 3 michelins, over twenty 2 michelins, and a good chunk of the  top 100 in the world. The lists are totally flawed but to play along I'll say that although this is currently rated a 3 Michelin , to me it's a lower 2.  Compare it to Quince and Quince beats it pretty easily - in flavors, decadence, amount of food, and atmosphere.  Benu, Meadowwood, Attelier Crenn?  Forget about it.

I liked it so much they brought me an experimental alternate version that was also delicious. \n\nYou want to hear the joke?!?!? We were served tea, orange push pop like sherbet (don't care it was in an orange)... Pause, here comes a rant! OMG what's wrong with people who call that innovative or whimsical presentation? Have your never been to Alinea food critics, pellegrino voters, Michelin voters?!?! I know you have, tisk tisk foodies for rewarding this pompous bs, ugh!!! So back to the humor... Pumpkin, antelope, radish...Oh I guess we were paying $400 for the one caviar dish!?! Don't get me wrong, I'll pay hundreds for interestingly prepared pigeon or potatoes, literally. As I did at Alinea and it was amazing! Nothing was interesting but the milk punch.\n\nThere was a rather boring blueberry dessert whose claim to fame and justification for price was a spoonful of rare Brandy.. Super irritating that there was a 2 oz pour of this Brandy that our server drank after bestowing our sad spoonful. Where's my $55 discount, because at only 9 courses (as opposed to 18-24 like you expect for $300, much less $500) that's what each course cost. I feel if the server drank the majority of the course, he can pay. \n\nUnderstand I know my shit, especially new American! I haven't reviewed everywhere I've dined...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-14", "description": "A solid and fairly exceptional dining experience. Worth the full $500 post tip and tax? eh. I can't deny that it was a pretty flawless experience, but not one that was wow worthy enough that I'd want to go back to in the future.\n\nMy friend and I came in for a Wednesday night reservation at 7:30. I had read super late online that 7:30 reservations aren't for the dining room, oops, but luckily, we got seated on this super comfy couch near the bar which I actually preferred a bit more than some of the table dining options. The restaurant is fairly small and has a beautiful open kitchen where you can actually see the chefs who are creating your meal. Even though it was more or less full, I was impressed that the noise level was pretty quiet throughout the meal. Waiters were never intrusive, very attentive to our needs, and it was honestly just a great atmosphere.\n\nWhen you get in and check your stuff (also I love that this is SF fine dining, dress code is come as you are!), you get seated and you're greeted with a glass of champagne that my friend informed me was \"the champagne they serve you on first class flights.\" Nice. I believe it was Krug Champagne? I don't even like champagne but this one was pretty delicious. The waitress comes over and checks over your dietary restrictions and then the sommelier comes over and gives you all the wine stuff, etc, and the meal more or less begins. They have an interesting pairing method where while there is a full on pairing for each dish, you can also just order glasses as you go so that way it's a bit more natural and self-paced -- this was what our waiter actually recommended, but my friend decided to go for the full on pairing.\n\nI feel like there's never much point in talking about your thoughts on the food to a specific detail since the menu constantly changes, but here's the menu we had, and I'll highlight the wins for me:\n\n1. Infusion of herbs from garden -- tea to open the palette\n2. Saison reserve caviar, cured with smoked salt -- BOMB probably my favorite. most generous caviar portion I've ever had -- extremely delicious bread roll too!\n3. Broth of grilled roots\n4. Live diamond turbot\n5. Battle creek trout, its skin and roe\n6. Sea urchin, liquid toast -- urchin game was on point, liquid toast was kinda weird\n7. Abalone, grilled over the embers, sauce of the liver and capere\n8. Pickles\n9. Custard\n10. Brassica leaves, blistered in the fire, broth of cultured vegetables -- the most expensive and delicious salad of my life\n11. Fire in the sky beet, bone marrow\n12. Whole duck grilled near fire with ragu\n13. Duck toffee\n14. Duck soup -- everyone hates it, but I thought it was amazingly delicious\n15. Ice cream and caramel\n16. Citrus and tea, wild berries\n\nWine highlights from the pairing -- an outstanding Stephan Ehlen Riesling from Germany 1991\n\nAnyways, overall, I'd say that all the dishes were very tasty, but some were definitely stronger than the others. I didn't find myself mindblown or particularly surprised or impressed by any of the dishes -- it was more like perfect execution of the natural flavor of ingredients, which is what Saison strives for, the whole concept of seasonality. I felt generally full after this set -- not super full though, and I don't eat a ton, so I could see why some people might be hungry afterwards. \n\nService was spectacular throughout the night -- they were super classy and professional despite my friend getting very drunk and spilling things, when a waiter accidentally poured me too much broth, he immediately apologized to my friend and got us some more to even it out, it's those little things that I find particularly elegant and elements that make the holistic experience very much a wonderful dining adventure. \n\nIt feels like a 4 to me relative to other Michelin restaurants that I've been too. It pains me a bit to give it a 4 when it was honestly holistically a wonderful experience, but I think for the sake of if you're trying to compare this to other great Michelin stars in the city (e.g. Atelier Crenn, Keiko a Nob Hill) I don't think Saison is much better, and with this high of a price point, it's definitely not better. So take this as a yes, this will be a hell of a lot better than what you're eating every day, but if you're looking to blow money and splurge, you're better off going to a different Michelin place in SF. \n\ntldr; great food, don't get me wrong, but mindblowing? eh.

I don't think I've ever seen anyone get that emotional over a single bite of food. And yes, it was that good.\n\nWhat were we celebrating? Nothing at all. Living in SF allows us the flexibility to feel fancy once in a while and Saison was the latest endeavor. As you already know, Saison is ridiculously expensive ($520pp for food, 1 cocktail, tax, tip) and it makes other 3 Michelin Star restaurants seem like a bargain. I've tried French Laundry and Benu as well and to me, Saison is one step above those two.\n\nWe made a reservation a few weeks in advance and were seated in the more casual lounge area, facing the bar. The setting almost made us feel too comfortable and we were even provided a soft throw pillow and blanket. There were songs (with words) playing in the background during the entire meal, which you don't usually find at restaurants of this level.\n\nThe meal started with a \"complimentary\" glass of champagne, followed by a beautiful floral tea. The meal also ended with tea (buckwheat) and we were handed dry tea leaves in a mason jar as a departing gift on the way out.\n\nAll of the courses were great and here are some of the standouts:\n- The first course was an egg custard with cheese and caviar. The custard was brought out in a plain white bowl and a heaping spoonful of the caviar was served onto the custard from an ornate jar. That jar was filled with caviar; seeing it was a jaw-dropping moment. This was also the best caviar I've ever had and I can completely understand why it evoked so much emotion out of my friend. I stopped her before the tears started flowing but she continued to sit in a dazed state for a minute or two. When she finally recovered, she exclaimed that she has been ruined and will never be able to eat normal food again. \nDid I mention that this course was also accompanied by perfectly fluffy and buttery biscuits?\n- The third course was the most decadent uni toast you'll ever taste. My mouth was watering just looking at it. The server explained that the easiest way to eat this was with our hands and I didn't hesitate to pick it up with my fingers. The uni melted in my mouth while the toast retained a certain level of crunchiness despite the fact it was covered in sauce. This must be what heaven is like.\n- I started losing count but I believe the 6th course was black cod. It came with a piece of crispy skin. The fish itself was so flaky and beautiful. It was served with a Thai-style lemongrass coconut suace.\n-After a few more courses, we were served 3 desserts all at once. The standout for us was the orange sorbet that tasted like an elevated orange dreamsicle. Instead of a bowl, it was served inside an orange! The first scoop was tasty but the more I ate, the more I fell in love with it. As I reached the bottom of the orange bowl, I found little slices of kumquat to finish off this dessert. It was wonderful.\n\nSo was it worth it? Absolutely, no doubt in my mind.", "author": "Yi Z."}

We watched about five others cleaning the kitchen 20 feet away (and not doing anything for us). We sat for a prolonged period of time with no food and no attention.

It is also the only eatery I've been to that does not even give you a menu, so don't be surprised--you get seated and your dinner just starts. If you didn't already know, expect to spend $500+ just on yourself. I believe the base price is $400 for dinner and the drink pairing is $300. I went with some good friends for a holiday dinner and we had a splendid time. You're probably asking if it's worth it and the answer is complex. Put as simply as I can, for this meal to be worth your time/money, you must appreciate the following:\n1) Well-prepared food\n2) Culinary art\n3) Adventures in eating\n4) Stimulating umami taste buds\n5) Elegant plate-ware and silverware\n6) Interior design and furniture\n7) Open kitchens with skillful chefs\n8) Knowledgeable sommeliers\n\nIf you can't swallow the price, think of it as purchasing an expensive art piece that you can eat. Joshua Skenes is a genius chef with innovative ideas who took years to perfect his art. You're getting a piece of it by visiting Saison. I haven't been to The French Laundry (the standard of fine dining) but I am sure Saison is up to par.\n\nThe food--amazing. The liquid toast with uni on top, the meat-tasting beets that were cooked for 72 hours, the whole hoshigaki, the lobster sashimi, etc. make you feel like your mouth is in another dimension simulating taste buds you never knew you had.\n\nFor one of the best (but most expensive) meals of your life, Saison is the place to be in the best city in the world, San Francisco.

The Uni on Tartine sourdough toast is one of the best sea urchin dishes that I've had outside of Japan.  The lobster and abalone courses were also delicious.  I'll come back in the future for more.\n\nThe wine pairings were elegant, delicious and paired extremely nicely with the foods.  The sole red was a fantastic aged burgundy that was oh-so delicate, as it should be.

NO\n(Haven't dined at Benu yet, but have done the rest)\n\nIs it a 5 Star dining experience when compared to other regular restaurants? YES\n\nFor me, SAISON is more than a four, but not a solid five. I am keeping it at a four because of their overall attention to detail, quality of ingredients, presentation, and service.\n\nThe first word out of the hostess' mouth was \"Happy anniversary.\" They did their homework and were ready for us. We were then escorted to probably one of the best tables in the house, front and center to the kitchen \"where the magic happens.\" I was stoked and could not stop smiling! That set up screams \"Look at us! We are about to put on a show for you!\" \n\nDress code is \"come as you are.\" I noticed everyone was dressed casual-chic, but it's up to you. Saison only seats around 20 diners. They did an incredible job with the decor and layout design. I never felt cramped. We had a head waiter and probably saw a good 5-6 others throughout the night also serving different dishes to our table. Every single one of them was extremely professional, knowledgeable, and seemingly proud to be working there. Also notable, the communication between them all was excellent. Having the great seats meant we got to see them calling the dishes out, cooking some, plating them, and also the expediting process. The kitchen staff had this calm sway about them. Everything was evenly spaced and very organized. I found it fascinating. \n\nI won't go into detail with each of the dishes. There were around eighteen of them and Yelp has a 5000 character limit, but I will just highlight the best ones and my least favorites. I also photographed almost everything (they are very photo friendly too!) \n\nFAVORITES...\n\nThe Caviar course with the Parker house roll. It's not Per Se's roll (my favorite), but still a pretty damn good one. \n\nThe Sea Urchin/Liquid Toast. What a delightful combination! It was close-your-eyes-mmm-mmm-mmm worthy. \n\nThe Toffee Milk Duck Liver Mousse paired with the Reutberger Kloster Beer. A perfect pairing. The plating, execution, and taste were on point.\n\nThe Duck Bouillon. It looks like nothing but a simple broth when photographed, but it was very good and especially comforting after so many courses. \n\nThe Beignets with the Cowgirl Creamery Red Hawk. Delicious!\n\nThe tangerine (I think)  ice cream inside the tangerine. \n\nNOT A FAN OF...\n\nSeaweed course\n\nAsparagus. Two of them. Beautifully plated. But it.was. just.asparagus. For the cost of this dinner, this course was insulting.\n\nFire in the Sky Beet. I just don't like beets in any way, shape or form. This one was no exception. \n\nBrussels & Cabbages course. Just blah. \n\nI know a lot of diners worry about not being full when they see photos of tiny portions. No need to worry. I was stuffed and even had a hard time finishing the duck courses that came towards the end. All of those \"bites\" add up. Trust me. \n\nOnce it was already getting late and not many diners were left, I noticed the staff was emptying out the kitchen cabinets and performing a deep cleanse on them. I mean, they were literally standing on the counters or on their knees scrubbing. All of them. Teamwork. Quietly. Odd?  A bit. \n\nOn our way out, we were given a copy of the menu supposedly listing the courses we had. Given that we dined blindly without a menu, it was disappointing to receive a menu with such little to no description. I know it's that minimalist concept some chefs go for, but I would love to be able to relive those dishes I loved and perhaps, understand those I did not a little better. There is only so much I can capture during a three and a half hour dinner (and several wine glasses later). \n\nAt the end of the day, this was a very nice experience overall. Some dishes more memorable than others. Will I ever return? I don't know. Right now my answer is 'not for a while.' For one, it's the highest priced dinner in the US out-the-gate and although it was nice, it's just not that mind blowing as say Alinea or as delicious as French Laundry. I rather visit a new restaurant if in the area or revisit an old favorite like Gary Danko (ahem, sans horseradish). Perhaps I'm a little jaded? It's a good problem to have, I suppose. Am I glad I dined here? Absofrigginlutely! As a food enthusiast, there's something to be said about experiencing these highly rated fine dining restaurants. I always, always, always learn and taste something new.", "author": "Brenda P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-09-07", "description": "I love food, love cooking, and love eating. I've greatly enjoyed several Michelin starred restaurants in the city, and have no real existential problem spending a lot of money on a meal if it's worthwhile. This should be clear by my choice to go to Saison at all, which is always going to be at least $400 per person, and can very easily approach a thousand dollars a head.\n\nI found my experience at Saison somewhat offensive. Of the seven courses we were served, only three were enjoyable enough that I would ever be interested in eating them again if they were free. This is shocking to me, in that I'm used to devouring, savoring, and almost licking the plate when served food of this echelon.\n\nThe experience was explicitly offensive because spending this amount on a meal is something which is a rarity for virtually all of us. We could have spent that money (or much less) at a hundred different restaurants in the city and had a much better meal. As silly as it sounds, I am annoyed that we missed that opportunity in wasting what has to be a rare occasion for us at Saison.\n\nI can't understand how we could be served barbecued quail which got what little taste it had from a brushing of wildflower honey on the skin. The meat itself had the watery moistness of being over brined, and the matching utter lack of taste. I fully appreciate that their intent was to celebrate the natural taste of the meat, but it just wasn't there. Eating the meat was far less enjoyable than a $1 piece of fried chicken I could get from KFC. I know that sounds uncultured and a little crazy, but it was our experience and collective opinion.\n\nAnother dish was a deconstructed ratatouille. This amounted to separate dishes containing items such as pealed tomatoes, a tomato gelee, and a rolled up piece of zucchini in broth. They were each very beautiful dishes. The only enjoyable component was the corn pudding underneath the gelee (which itself had the bitter acidity extracted from tomatoes with none of the redeeming flavors). We left half of the food on the serving plates, which is just unimaginable to me at a restaurant like this.\n\nWe were kind of puzzlingly served the only two bread items simultaneously. Biscuits (which were very good) as a part of a dish, and loaves of Parker House rolls together. The rolls had the slightly acidic taste of old butter, and none of the deep fermentation notes I hope for in bread. I'm sorry for being so harshly critical, but in what world are you served bread at a three Michelin star restaurant and half of it goes uneaten. It's bread, everyone loves bread! But it wasn't very good.\n\nOn a positive note, the service was impeccable. They clearly have both a very large and a very experienced staff. We were also served lovely tea in two different instances, and a nice beef broth as a part of one of the courses which was savory and smokey. The caviar and seaweed first course was rich and delicious, the sea urchin course had great textural contrasts, and sourcing antelope is always going to be an impressive feat.\n\nThere is no world in which any of that was worth the price, especially when you consider how many other wonderful places would happily accept your money and your time.", "author": "Zack B."}

Hmm well, Saison is actually a steal compared to living in SF...\n\nIn all seriousness, I was lucky enough to enjoy the full menu with pairings this past weekend. A and I arrived 15 minutes early and enjoyed cocktails while waiting for our table. The cocktails were creative and absurdly delicious. I surprised myself and enjoyed one with popcorn notes. There were a couple tables eating at the bar area, so that seemed to be an option.\n\nAfter we sat down at our dining table, we were given a flute of Krug champagne to start. We were already ecstatic about getting a front row view of the open kitchen, and the cocktails & champagne put me over the top. I had a good buzz going on already!\n\nFOOD:\nThe 18 course meal was heavy on seafood. Pine and seaweed seemed to be a recurring theme as well. The highlights for me were the roasted beet, naple long pumpkin 3-ways, and the duck bouillon. The 3-day slow roasting method created this insane texture on the beet that resembled a great rib bark. Except that it was a vegetable. I think if I had to give up meat, life wouldn't be so bad after all.\n\nThe duck bouillon was deceptively simple in appearance. The complexity of the broth though!...A remarked that this could cure any sickness. I'm a believer.\n\nAnd the classic uni over liquid toast? Just heavenly.\n\nThe portions were small enough that I could finish the whole meal. I was still really full, but not uncomfortably so.\n\nAfter dinner, we got a tour of the kitchen and upstairs. Then we received a copy of the menu and a jar of loose leaf tea to go.\n\nPAIRINGS:\nWe had 12 pairings with the 18 course meal: 2 sakes, 1 beer, 1 red, and the rest white. Pours are generous and they refill between courses. Be safe and don't plan on driving afterwards if you are a lightweight! I paced myself and left a good amount in the glasses - probably would have been uncomfortably tipsy otherwise.\n\nI liked all the pairings - nothing absolutely blew me away, but nothing was a mismatch either. Pairings aside, I enjoyed each individual drink and the diversity of the white wines. I also found myself really appreciating the sake, when I am normally not a sake fan.\n\nSERVICE:\nService was exceptional. The staff was the youngest I've seen at any fine dining restaurant, and they brought this engaging, youthful energy along with the professionalism expected from a 3 star establishment. \n\nTiming was pretty much perfect. No wait, it was actually perfect. Each course and its pairing came out like clockwork. We were done in 3 hours.\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n-Saison defaults to serving the longer \"discovery\" menu on weekends, unless otherwise requested.\n-Service charge of 20% is automatically included.\n-We found easy street parking right around the corner at 8 pm on a Friday. The meters were still running until 10 pm, but it was nominal at 25 cents/hr.", "author": "Adrienne H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-28", "description": "The drinks, food, service, atmosphere, decor... it's amazing. The meal I had was probably the best I've ever had, including trips to Europe and Asia.\n\nThe menu changes so it isn't really worth going over what my specific dinner was, but I will say the cooked fish dish I had was better than any cooked fish I had in Tokyo, and the uni and sashimi was comparable. I don't say this lightly, because if you've ever been to Japan, you know that their seafood makes ours look like a joke.\n\nAt this price point I feel like you can nitpick anything and it's valid, so I'll say that while the orange sherbert served in a hollowed out orange peel was absolutely delicious, I found the presentation a little bit cheesy. The glued-on green leaf elicited an eye roll as well. For such an upscale place, I would expect a presentation that doesn't remind me of a Costco dessert.\n\nWe also had a fish dish in a very light broth, it was served in a humongous dish with lots of little holes around the massive rim. You can see the same bowl used in photos here. I 100% agree that it makes a dramatic presentation, but it comes at a cost. If you aren't being insanely careful, you can easily dribble on the bowl, which, due to the holes, will then dribble on the table. I think this is an example of form being prized over function, and I don't think it would take a lot away from the presentation to use a solid bowl.\n\nAgain, these complaints are me being extremely pedantic - the taste was amazing, this is just me trying to find any sort of fault.\n\nMy party of 4 had probably 5 kinds of wine, rather than the wine tasting, so it ended up being around $600 per person. Fortunately I didn't have to pay for my portion! But if you are going to have to pay, you should ask yourself if you're really capable of enjoying food at this level. I don't mean to sound snobbish, especially since I didn't have to personally chip in, but do you really want to drop this much on a dinner experience?\n\nIt's laughable to talk about value when you've got a team of people waiting on you and you're paying this much for a few hours of fun. Like if you're making good money and want a special occasion splurge meal, yeah this place is amazing. If you're rich and the money is immaterial, then for sure, why not. But for a normal person, this is a lot of money to drop, so unless you're foodie level is maxed out, I might balk at it. Yes it's an experience, and yes it's all amazing, but dropping more than a car payment on a meal is a little crazy. Definitely ask yourself if a fleeting but memorable experience like this is worth it before coming, because if you don't seriously love high-end food, you're probably gonna regret it.", "author": "Sm L."}

The only other experience that comes close is watching the Jiro documentary on Netflix lolol Although I have never been there, I definitely felt the experience vicariously just from watching the documentary. If you don't know what I am talking about, go watch it! It's a very artistic documentary about a 3 Michelin star sushi restaurant, a great way to get a general idea of what to expect from a 3 Michelin star Restaurant. \n\nA 13 course meal all in small portions, about four to five bites per plate. Something you expect from a superlative restaurant. When we first came in, the servers poured us some champagne, then took our drink orders, and then poured us some tea. At one point, I was sipping on champagne, wine, glass of whisky, tea, and water.   \n\nThe food came out in ten minute intervals. Everything was presented nicely. The taste of the food is ineffable.. I can't describe this to you...You will just have to try it for yourself. But what I can talk about is the service here and the overall presentation. \n\nThings I noticed: \n\n1) The servers here are very attentive to details. After the first plate, they will notice if you are right handed or left handed and will set your utensils accordingly for the rest of the meal. \n\n2) Every time I stood up, one of the servers would assist me by pulling my seat, then he or she would take my napkin and fold them back neatly. Every time I came back, the server would pull my seat again and assist me in sitting down. I felt bad at a certain point because well... after drinking champagne, wine, glass of whisky, tea, and water... how do you not expect anyone to run to the bathroom multiple times...\n\n3) Speaking about the bathrooms, they are fancy and immaculate. No paper towels for your hands but actual mini towels lol... I don't know why but I was pretty impressed by this. I felt like I was in bathroom in a nice fancy hotel.\n\n4) The kitchen: After our meal, our server offered us to take a tour around the kitchen which was pretty informing. First of all it's an open kitchen so you can always peak at the kitchen to see the culinary work. I actually enjoyed the part where I walked around the kitchen while the server gave us explicit details about what some of the chiefs were doing and how the food was prepared.\n\nwow...

Not everyone can walk in and trust the chefs to provide their very best - find out if that style of dining is for you before coming in to the top of the line. The expectations that come with such a meal will only detract from the experience if you can't trust in the professionalism of the team.\n\nOn to the heart of my review: The very best meal I have ever had. Period. Bar none. \n\nThis is one of the few luxury dining experiences that is truly worth every penny. I honestly didn't think twice when time came to pay the piper (and it was a truly magical sum of money - just get over that now). \n\nThe food was superlative. The only true culinary 'miss' in my opinion was the raw shrimp. The flavor was enjoyable, but the texture was challenging at best. The beet dish was one of the most singular dishes I've ever had - and I utterly despise beets. The goat, dessert, abalone, tea, tomato (TOMATO!?), urchin ... all incredible. Beautiful.\n\nThe wine was on point. If you don't know what you're doing with a wine list, follow the somm's advice. They know what's best - they really do.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-31", "description": "I first heard of Saison from my cousin's wife, who is a serious foodie.  She recommended Saison years ago as her favorite SF restaurant, back when it was a 2-Michelin Star.  Now its a 3-Michelin restaurant (Benu the other in SF).  I booked a special dinner here for my wife's upcoming birthday.\n\nSUMMARY\nWe had an outstanding dinner - food, service, ambiance were top notch.  They feature fish and veggies (radish and root veggies are prominent) in many creative preparations, employ their wood grill to smoke everything - from duck to desserts, and have awesome desserts.  The food here is playful - does tricks on your mind and will satisfy your appetite.  Very laid back ambiance.  Compared to other 3-Michelin restaurants we've been to, I rank Saison higher than French Laundry and Le Bernardin but below Joel Robuchon (Las Vegas).  Still, solid 5 stars and will definitely recommend!  Dinner is just about right portion-wise - you won't leave the meal super-full, but you'll be satisfied for sure!\n\nLOCATION\nThe restaurant is on Townsend St a few blocks from AT&T park.  Its a nondescript brick building surrounded by fast food chain restaurants and sports bars.  Parking is valet, or you can find street metered parking pretty easily.\n\nAMBIANCE\nOne of the best aspects - no dress code!  It has a bit of a warehouse feel but its really trendy with wood and brick.  They play 80's and 90's pop music which sets the festive, mood - music I grew up with!  We were seated on a huge decorative wood table with full view of their open kitchen!  All the chefs looked so young and happy throughout the service.  One chef had the hardest job of manually fanning the smoke from the wood grill all night.\n\nSERVICE\nWow - the men and women in suits are friendly and super attentive!  They take time to explain each dish and how to best enjoy it.  Get up to freshen up in the restroom?  The waiter swoops in and covers your tea cup so it won't get cold.  I dropped my scissors (I will explain later) into the bowl and a waiter stealthily went across the room and brought me a new pair.  One other cool thing is that one of the waiters looked like Robin Lord Taylor! (Penguin on Gotham).\n\nDRINKS\nThe meal starts and ends with tea!  The first was a simple infusion of garden herbs (I taste mint and lavender) in Meyer Lemon water.  The final tea after dessert was roasted buckwheat tea that was excellent - sort of like roasted rice teas.  Then you get some more tea to go as a gift!  For adult beverages my wife ordered a Riesling that was sweet and went down smoothly.  I got the Saison Milk Punch cocktail - nice coconut-flavored rum cocktail.  \n\nFOOD HIGHLIGHTS\n- Battle Creek Trout: Shaped like nigiri, with crispy skin, a layer of roe, and then the smoked trout itself.  The vinegar broth cleans the palate with the sweet, citrusy flavor. \n- Black Cod: Grilled over embers with a nice light coconut-curry broth.\n- Uni on Liquid Toast: One of their signature dishes - rich creamy uni on a piece of porous crispy bread saturated with butter and soy sauce.\n- Radish: The whole plant was used and provided good contrast of color and flavor. Some parts were sweet like beets!  Drizzled with clarified butter from Vibrance the cow. (The restaurant has a cow!)\n- Whole Duck: Main course - smoked duck breast, followed by veggie-wrapped roasted duck offal (ground liver and kidneys), and the duck soup!\n- BBQ Celeriac: Interesting, playful dish.  Crispy celeriac skin on top of a roasted celeriac root. You're given some scissors to cut some fresh herbs to the dish.  When it came out I thought we were being served pho!\n\nDESSERTS\n- The standard dessert was this Orange Sorbet served inside an orange with fruit at the bottom.  Then there's this smoked ice cream with salted caramel, followed by tiny strawberries in cream.  The ultimate was the special birthday cake - salted caramel, hazelnut cream on top of a crunch chocolate-nutty candy bar.  Wow!", "author": "Daniel C."}

Last night had some wonderful bright spots but some unforgiving and unforgettable lowlights.  \n\nEveryone who makes a reservation at Saison is clear about the price pp.  Found it odd it needed to be lectured to us at the start of the meal.  Just tell me about the beverages and get on with the show.  \n\nChef has decided not to use ingredients outside of our region, so no Albas come this winter.  True sadness.  However, this does not apply to their wine and beverage lists.  \n\nThis was probably why they could afford to pile on the Saison Reserve golden osetra.  Seriously it was more than we could handle.  Over 1 ounce PER person.  \n\nThoroughly enjoyed:\n*herbal infusion tea to start the meal\n*trout with roe and skin, nice texture and buttery fish\n*uni liquid toast, flavor explosion, so briny and sweet\n*pickles, perfectly brined and fermented\n*asparagus, beautifully tender, the edible flowers actually added to the flavors\n*duck and toffee, best course of the night, the toffee, a classic, the meat, perfect, greens around the foie was overseasoned\n*smoked ice cream and caramel, we could have had 3 more of these\n*wild strawberries were adorable and delectable\n\nMiddle of the road:\n*broth of grilled roots, turnips, daikon, umami for sure, broth, salty, the fragrant broth smelled like how chinese Turnip cake tastes\n*parmesan custard, need more spring onion, mac and cheese in silky form\n*fire in the sky beet, have seen renditions of this, was never impressed\n*mandarin sorbet with segments of the fruit, lovely presentation\n*abalone, it's own liver sauce was cloying, overpowering, salty\n\nNot good:\n*live diamond turbot, the sashimi was crunchy, like tendon, server mentioned it is great without the condiments, use them, there is NO flavor\n*brassica leaves, this course has been redone so many times at Saison, but this time it was overly oily, I make kale chips at home, when you put too much oil before heating, it doesn't crisp as well and when biting into ends up being a mouthful of oil\n*seaweeds, gelatinous and unappetizing\n*crispy rice with the abalone, was abhorrent, crunchy in a stick to your crown, gotta get them replastered kind of way.  Not good.  \n\nTake aways: printed dated menu in an envelope, plus tea.  LOVE.  After an indulgent meal, I don't want more calories from a cake or cookie the next day.  \n\nThatcher is incredibly engaging and a star of the team.  Love him to bits.\n\n18 courses, about a third of the savories were vegetables, which I love, but others may balk at especially when a premium price is being paid.  In the past there have been 22 courses and most of the courses featured some sort of animal, at almost half at the price.    \n\nStill a wonderful gem in SF, just needs to be lighter on the salt and some reflection on what brought them to the coveted 3 Michelin stars.", "author": "Cynthia C."}

We made a reservation several weeks in advance, which is highly recommended as this place is rather popular. The hostess called us several time in the 7 days prior to the reservation to confirm. It was unnecessary for all those phone calls. We were first seated in the lounge area and given a glass of champagne to sip on while they prepared our table. \n\nWe were then seated at our assigned dinner table which is right next to the open kitchen, absolutely loves that. I do have to admit that the people working in the kitchen are all in great shape and super hot, contrary to popular belief that chefs have pot bellies and move very slowly. To say the least, I did enjoy the \"eye candy\" throughout our meal. We did do the 12 course for $250 and it was good, the seafood dishes were creative and tasty. However, the dessert courses were very lacking in presentation and flavor. Service was attentive, and precise. Our server was very nice. \n\nNote: I parked my car right in front of the restaurant on a parking meter.

Bit loud inside. Upscale modern industrial decor, full of cool accessories that one might find in a Restoration Hardware catalog. NO DRESS CODE, HOWEVER...most people were dressed very nicely. That sparkly dress you paid too much for? Here's your chance! :) There are thick shawls on the back of each chair, but it wasn't necessary.\n\nI asked the smashing young man serving us and he said: only ONE MENU now. On the evening we visited, it was $398, NOT including service, drinks, tax. With that included, it was slightly over $500/person and we only got 1 cocktail to split. Service was excellent and friendly.\n\nTasting menu comprised of 15 itty-bitty-fancy-food courses. Molecular gastronomy influences, lots of Asian-inspired dishes, and California cuisine. There were surprises, creative techniques, artsy plating, etc. Missing are big steaks & hefty meaty courses.\n\nWe started with a cup of Meyer lemon water with a bundle of garden herbs & flowers, served in a delightful teacup. Cute!\n\nFirst dish: \"Saison Reserve Caviar\" cured with smoked salt. Underneath a generous plop of caviar was a Sturgeon bone gel\u00e9e with a tiny spoonful of sturgeon belly. Delicate flavors, very mild briny notes, paired very well with a brioche cube basted in smoked pork fat. The soft bread reminded me of King's Hawaiian rolls. Delish!\n\n\"Broth of Grilled Roots\" - rutabaga & turnip smoked in a seaweed soup. Very delicate with mild citrus and savory notes. Nice transition.\n\n\"Live Diamond Turbot\" - served in a bone broth with lemon and radish, this fish had a crisp, snappy texture that was unusual. Very mild flavors. \"Still in rigor mortis\", said our waiter.\n\n\"Battle Creek Trout\" from Sacramento. Made of delicately crisped skin, thin layer of roe gel\u00e9e, sauce from its bones, and smoky, buttery soft flesh. One of the tougher dishes to execute and they did it perfectly.\n\n\"Sea Urchin and Liquid Toast\" - a signature dish. Uni was served like a piece of nigiri, except it was on top of sourdough bread which was soaked in brown butter & soy sauce. This was crunchy, sour, buttery, and salty at the same time. Seriously good!\n\n\"Abalone with caper sauce, made with Abalone liver\" - served with seaweed, pickles, toasted rice. Rich, creamy, and savory. No fishy flavors. Pretty creative, good use of textures, but that's a tiny piece of abalone in there.\n\n\"Brassica Leaves\" - roasted cabbage leaves in broth, sauerkraut with caraway seeds. Tasted like roasted Brussels Sprouts. I liked it, but couldn't help thinking I paid $500/head for cabbage soup?\n\n\"Custard\" - made from parmesan & Cowgirl Creamery Red Hawk cheese, served with green onions & seaweed gelee. Creamy & intensely savory. Texture is like the Chinese dessert Tofu Fa.\n\n\"Seaweeds\" - artsy dish of seaweed \"noodles\" (like a finer seaweed salad), clear gelatin cubes topped with tiny flower petals. Combination of sour & savory, cold temps, crunchy textures. Reminded me of some stuff we had at Meadowood.\n\n\"Asparagus\" - seriously delish. Two large, super tender asparagus spears topped with a citrusy, smoky glaze, seaweed, flowers, & herbs. Each bite had a slightly different flavor profile. I loved it, but flavors are very delicate. We were given a set of small tongs to eat them...really unique.\n\n\"Fire in the Sky Beet\" - red beet cooked for 3 days. DH described it well when he said, \"Deep flavors like an aged steak.\" Had a dense almost \"meaty\" texture. Herbs & bone marrow juice went well with it.\n\n\"Whole duck\" - 3 part dish. Small slice of duck breast aged 3 weeks in house and a potent, tangy cherry blossom sauce. Next to it was duck liver rolled in grape leaf? Duck was tender; skin was rubbery. Grape leaf had some bitterness that I didn't like. 2nd part was listed as \"toffee\" - custard topped with beer foam. Tiny pieces of what seemed like Cocoa Krispies (!) were mixed in. Not sure how it relates to the duck. Comes with a sip of the matching beer. 3rd was simply duck broth. It was waaaay too hot and I burned my tongue on it. :(\n\n\"Ice cream & caramel\" - Easy to make, IMHO. Surprisingly, ice cream had a deep smokiness. Topped with delicious caramel and cocoa nibs. Yummy, but unusual.\n\n\"Tea & mandarin\" - citrus buttermilk sherbet served in a mandarin orange skin, with kumquat pieces underneath. Tasty & refreshing. Tea was a mild buckwheat, like what is served in Korean restaurants.\n\n\"Wild strawberries\" - tiny berries with a glaze on top. Small dish of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.\n\nWe were pretty full, but we're light eaters. You can get a tour of the kitchen after your meal. They were very tolerant of photographs. We were given a glass container of herbal tea to go. Overall, an excellent experience, but not as good as the French Laundry. I liked it better than Meadowood, but I thought it was on-par with Atelier Crenn and Cyrus. Considering this place is about 2x the price, doesn't seem like a good value.", "author": "Kari C."}

Obviously for this much cheddar, all ingredients are local/organic/grown from their own farm. The chef is some famous dude that really knows how to make some cool stuff without doing any weird science BS. I almost cried when I ate me some caviar over aged kelp with fresh liquid bacon fat (obviously from a mother of pearl spoon), it was almost an outer body experience.

Every 30 seconds, another classy, sharply dressed lad or chick would either fold my napkin, layout new flatware or re-position plates! The sous chefs and managers gave you a nice little chat before each course, and they were happy to answer all my benign questions.\n\nThe location is conveniently not near public transportation, but you can uberpool for less than 1% of the cost of your meal. The restaurant decor is super relaxing, feels like you're in a ranch. The kitchen is integrated with the dining area, you see everything real time! I showed up comfortably in sweats (my girlfriend refused to do matching onesies), and the staff complemented my sweater.

It was one of the worst valued meal I have dined in my life. Normally I feel justified paying $500-600 for a meal if the ingredients are level of skills are fully justified.\n\nMost of the dishes looked absolutely gorgeous and that was about it. The taste was no where near the look of each dish. When I come to michelin starred restaurant, I'm looking for the, feel, uniqueness, locality, flow, beauty, chef's interpretation of the nature's freshest ingredients. I can tell you looking back at the pictures, the dishes look absolutely beautiful like a piece of painting.\n \nThere was nothing extraordinary about most of the dishes other than its awesome representation and passion from the chef. No ingredients were special or unique in any sense. I did not find anything amusing nor fascinating.\n\nThe food tasted great but thats it. Just great and nothing too more or less. I feel like this was waste of my time and money. I believe they are also well known for the Caviar dish but they have recently replaced them with a Tomato Gelatin dish.\n\nMain dish was river goat from Oregon. I was not given a option whether I wanted this gamey type of a meat nor knew their was alternative option for a duck.\n\nThis is the biggest waste of time and money for my meals ate.

Inside a building that you would never imagine is a super fancy restaurant, more likely to be an auto shop or something.   Oh San Francisco. \n\nExtremely attentive staff.  The sommelier was particularly great.  \n\nThey just start off by serving you champagne - because in the sommelier's words \"we think every experience should start with champagne\" Who can argue with that?  \n\nFrom there it was a whirl wind of foods that I really can't remember the names of - that's how inventive it was.  Toast soaked in something with raw fish on top?  Things like that.  But tasty stuff! And they paired things with interesting wines or beer that were meant to bring out the flavor.

Hand's down the best dining experience in San Francisco (alongside Benu.. and French Laundry/Meadowood if we're talking the whole Bay Area) and I go back and forth with this, but it's probably my favorite of the bunch.\n\nI chose to do the wine pairing with dinner, which I absolutely recommend. Saison's pairing is one of the best I've had, and it truly rounds out the experience. Matched well with courses, enhanced the flavors, and was both fun and unpredictable.\n\nThe menu is as you'd expect: extraordinary, mind-blowing, the perfect indulgent experience. Not much needs to be said here. You can see the hard work and care put into these dishes, as well as taste it.\n\nThe service was also wonderful. I would say it isn't quite as high end/luxurious feeling as other three Michelin star restaurants I've been to, but it is highly professional, and I can see how some might even prefer this as it creates a slightly friendlier feel.\n\nThe music. To me this was a highlight of their perfect atmosphere, and I couldn't write this review without giving acknowledgement to the amazing playlist they curated. I heard a few from David Bowie (one of my favorites), plus some other greats, which really made my experience memorable.\n\nLastly, if I'm being nit picky and comparative, I prefer the atmosphere at Saison over Benu, but the menu at Benu is a tad more inspired. Saison also feels a little younger and less heavy than Benu... think Per Se vs Jean Georges. Having said that, Saison beats the pants off of Per Se.

Their uni toast, for example, is fantastic and has some really nice flavor and texture. I also like their smoky ice cream with cocoa nib dessert. The service is also great.\n\nBut for a 3 Michelin star restaurant, Saison is a disappointment. It was for a time the most expensive restaurant in California, and it is simply not on the same level as other 3 star restaurants in the country (Alinea blows it away) or city (Benu is far and away more inventive and has better execution). There are also several 1-2 Michelin star restaurants I would put above it (Californios, Taj at Cameron place, even Coi). The dishes are not flavorful and reflect a sort of poorly executed try of incorporating asian elements into California cuisine. I vastly preferred when they were a pop-up in the mission and focused more on utilizing more elements of French cuisine. Their fish dishes, the sea foam gelee etc all lacked much depth in flavor. The presentation was nice though. \n\nBut with regard to execution, My wife got a piece of abalone that was so poorly cooked that she thought it was spoiled. She actually spit it out. I have never had something remotely similar to that occur at any restaurant with a single Michelin star, let alone 3 and at that price.\n\nTo be fair, this is from a meal in January 2014, so it is entirely plausible things have changed.

The wines were well chosen and the pours were not stingy, but on top of being the most expensive tasting menu, it was also the most expensive wine pairing we've had.\n\nWhile we knew the price when we went, I think what tipped it over was:\nwhen we got the bill (for 2 people) a 20% tip was included on top of the entire bill (including the wine pairing), which added another $109 to the bill, just for tip. But if it's a required 20% tip, it's not a tip anymore, it should be part of the original bill, and actually some competitors already include service in the bill because it's the French way.\nSo let's compare: French laundry is $270 with service included, Saison is  $510 per person before wines, and don't despair, your bill has a handy line where you can add an additional tip (which I found insulting at this point).\n\nThis is regrettable because the food was good, the service was good, but the meal was not a huge meal with so many courses you can't even count them anymore, and you turning away the dessert cart after you've already had 2 prior desserts. Charging about twice as much as the competition with a mandatory 20% tip that includes the price of alcohol just cancelled out what would otherwise have been a good experience.\nFor what it's worth, we enjoyed our table that was facing the open kitchen, and again all the staff did a very good job.", "author": "Marc M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-21", "description": "My mom and I took a short trip up to San Francisco last month, the whole purpose of which was to check out Benu and Saison. My mom wanted to go and my dad didn't feel like it, and I was happy to tag along as the spoiled 30-year-old child alternate. So big thanks to Mom for an enormously expensive, wildly fabulous dinner.\n\nSaison must do two seatings a night, and we got reservations for the first one, at 5:30 on a Wednesday. The restaurant was small, though it bled into some kind of lounge that made the space feel wider. Half of Saison proper seemed to be devoted to the beautiful open kitchen full of tattooed white boy cooks. (Side grumble: Interesting that when the restaurant is fancy enough for an open kitchen, 90%+ of the cooks are white.) We sat at a pleasant corner table with cushioned seating and soft furry throw pillows and blankets.\n\nService was excellent. We were attended to by a few people at various points, and everyone was both warm and consummately professional. Dinner started with a welcome glass of champagne, and we supplemented with wine by the glass--we got a Sancerre and white and red Burgundy, all lovely, though worth noting that the cheapest glass available was $28. We drank slowly, kicked back and enjoyed the omakase menu. It was fun not knowing what was coming, particularly since everything was extraordinary. The best ingredients, cooked expertly, much of it over a wood burning fire.\n\nThe meal got going with an infusion of herbs--fennel, Douglas fir, and santolina--a sort of fast-steeping tea, bursting with fragrance. Then came a decadent parfait of custard and cheese sauce and golden Osetra caviar, served with fresh biscuits made with smoked pork fat. Everything about this was sublime.\n\nNext, we had lobster tail sashimi and fire-warmed lobster claws in XO sauce. The sashimi was fresh and delicate, serve with slivers of citrus marigold and citrus marigold salt; the claws were meaty and boldly flavored. We ate them both with a dish of golden gooseberries, served raw and preserved, and tempuraed citrus marigold. The sea urchin that followed was fun and gorgeous, piled over grilled bread with a grilled bread sauce. The bread took over a bit, but hard to complain about uni anything. Grilled red abalone might have been my favorite dish of the night--it was impossibly tender, served with Monterey wakame and a creamy, funky abalone liver and caper sauce.\n\nJust to show off, the kitchen sent out two vegetable courses that were as exciting as anything with meat. I've eaten tons of radish in my life, but the radish dish made me rethink the vegetable. It came out raw, poached, and grilled, dressed with fermented cow's milk clarified butter. The textures were wonderful, and the rich butter was just right for the native spice of the radish. Then there was an insane rataottouille, a medley of eggplant, cherry tomato, zucchini, roasted tomato, corn, corn pudding, and something like mint jelly, with a grilled olive sauce and plenty of fresh herbs. Every element was fresh and distinctive, and together they gave a sense of bottomless garden bounty in one small bowl.\n\nWhat felt like the core entree portion of the meal started with line-caught Half Moon Bay black cod. It was a perfectly cooked piece of fish, served in a house yogurt and citrus leaf sauce that tasted like a limey lemongrass coconut milk curry. Then came a whole lot of pork--grilled hairy pig, pork belly, pork rind, dressed in a grilled fat and vinegar sauce, with fermented chile hot sauce on the side. The pork was tender and juicy, if a bit less exciting (and disproportionately large) than the rest of the meal. My mom doesn't love pork, so she got the world's meatiest beet dish--beets dried above a fire for three days, served with a pickled beet rose sauce and a side of chorizo wrapped in radicchio. I actually preferred the beets to the pork. They had a real steak-like texture, with a substantial crust and bleeding insides. The grilled chorizo radicchio roll was also on point. Both pork and beets came with a basket of salad herbs, each individual leaf/stem/flower presenting a unique flavor. There was a numbing licorice herb, a frosty-looking guy called ice plant; definitely a fun accompaniment. The savory portion of our dinner wound down with roasted pork bone broth and roasted beet broth, both dripping with concentrated flavor.\n\nThe desserts came all at once, a light, refreshing picnic of sweets, ideal for the end of a long meal. There was a deceptively simple smoked ice cream with a rich caramel sauce, a citrus buttermilk sorbet served in a hollowed rind, and tiny strawberries glazed with strawberry juice and Szechuan peppercorn, served with whipping cream. Finally, we had a fantastic toasted buckwheat tea, which we received dry as a parting gift.\n\nThis was an exceptional meal, without a lackluster bite.

The main theme of our meal was \"savory,\" but wow, I never thought it was possible to create 20 different variations on savory with absolutely no hints of redundancy. Your tastebuds transcend reality, your mind enters a dream state, nothing else matters asides from you and that little bit of magic sitting on your tongue. And for those of us who like to (maybe not simultaneously) employ all our senses in their dining experience, the kitchen is open and visible from your table, so you can watch these culinary masterminds at work, preparing the bites of heaven that will soon enter your mouth. \n\nYou begin your meal with a light chamomile tea that stimulates your appetite, and then dive into a gustatory adventure of nonstop perfection. My personal favorites are the sea urchin atop liquid toast (made of tartine sesame sour dough), parmesan custard (with braised red hot cheese mousse), and the caramelized duck liver toffee (served with reut beer, grapefruit, and caramelized white chocolate). Don't these simple ingredient descriptions just make your mouth water? Or maybe I'm the only one with a drooling problem...\n\nOh, and do *not* even get me started on dessert. You're initially served a savory ice cream (I don't know how you make ice cream savory, but they did. And sadly, I'll probably never be able to enjoy any other ice cream ever again. This was just too good...and it's made from scratch! They have a cow named Vibrance who makes the milk for the restaurant!), but after your check, you're presented with two surprises, a gordonnugget mandarin filled with citrus and butterscotch sorbet (absolutely the cutest thing ever!), and wild berries with glaze made from the fruit itself and whipped cream. \n\nThe blend of flavors, the unbeatable presentation, the classy decor and open kitchen, the courteous staff, and the relaxing ambiance all come together to make Saison a night that is nothing short of perfection.", "author": "Ying X."}

We had such expectations - about creativity, flavor, new tastes and how we were let down \n\nIt is well known that Saison has the most expensive menu in town. As a foodie, this was supposed to be my Mecca so maybe I built it up this Michelin 3*. \n\nIn a nut shell, the 18 food courses for $398 is simply not worth the money. The courses are well presented, service is excellent, but neither the flavors nor the combinations were impressive. I could list all the 18 courses with my thoughts on each but they change too often to be of help to future diners. \n\nI will say one of the 18 courses was a bowl of duck broth!!!! If you were to cost average my meal, (pre tip and tax), I just paid $22 for a cup of leftover bones boiled for a couple of hours. \n\nThe menu was supposed to be seafood heavy - only about 9 of the courses had a fish element. \n\nWhat I liked: the first caviar course, the duck course and the orange sorbet dessert. The service was great and we enjoyed our sommelier\n\nAlso - I left hungry! After 18 courses. That's what happens when you serve broth for dinner. \n\nI still Saison is an experience but a much better can be had at French Laundry (where I left full, enjoyed much more creativity and flavor). I also think better creativity is available at Lazy Bear (1/4 of the price) or Wakuriya (if you prefer Japanese flavors) \n\nSave the $$$$ - go to French Laundry, Lazy Bear or Wakuriya.", "author": "Rumesha A."}

We particularly enjoyed the Negroni with burned manzanita - inspired and a delicious way to open your palate. Noah was extremely knowledgeable about wines and the paired wines he gave us were unique and matched the food nicely. The entire waitstaff are impeccably trained. That brings us to the food - we enjoyed the pronghorn antelope and the sea urchin on sourdough toast. Those two dishes were delicious. We both felt the BBQ quail was woefully undercooked and it just did not taste good. For 2 people with paired wines, the price tag was extreme: $1800 - making Gary Danko or The French Laundry in Yountville seem like a real deal in comparison. We were celebrating a special event, we are glad to have experienced Saison, enjoyed the service...but the food and price tag are not congruent with reality.", "author": "Nancy M."}

Designed so everyone in the 18 seat main dining room can see the magical show that is the kitchen. A perfectly orchestrated dance.\n\nThe service is beyond reproach. Meticulous and thoughtful details from the reservation until you are out the door. Dietary restrictions? Special occasion accommodations? Needs a purse hook or blanket? Check, check, check. The staff are knowledgable, engaging, and run an operation so tight that gives the navy seals a run for their money. They do not spill anything on the counters or floors and we had no idea where their dirty utensils or dishware were, the kitchen always looked like it was ready for a photo shoot. \n\nThe presentation is beautiful without being overworked. Technical complexity with restraint. You are presumed to know how to use chopsticks. Or your fingers. You should like seafood and strong touches of Asian influences. The ingredients are locally sourced from their farm or local purveyors of the highest quality products. You need to be able to read to appreciate their three volume leather bound wine and cocktail lists. \n\nSounds like the making of a big ole thumbs up review right? It was until you get to the food. Yup, the food. I never expect to like every course. If I find half the courses pretty tasty and maybe one or two what I'll remember in a year or two, I'm a happy camper. When you sit down and expect to spend over $500-600 per person (that's with no alcohol, $398 + tax + 20% service charge) you generally expect to finish most of the plates. I couldn't finish about half my plates because most were really really over salted. I had to go to the bathroom twice before we even got to dessert because I had to drink so much water to wash it out. (TMI, I know) I didn't say anything for the first half of the service that this was a problem, but after we both started to feel the dehydration kicking in, I finally said something when they asked if everything was all right when I left a course largely uneaten. \n\nThe staff did a really commendable job of trying to make it right. They talked to the kitchen at least twice to dial it down, I could see them discussing and then the expediter looking over at us to see who these crazies are that were questioning their basic seasoning. They threw in an extra dessert that no one else had (which turned out to be absolutely the best passionfruit sorbet I've ever had - I've seen it on other reviews but it was not being served to other diners that night). They even lopped off part of our food bill. They were so freakin awesome that I tacked on extra for the service part of the bill. \n\nBut what it boils down to is still the food. Except for the exceptional herbal infusion tea and the orange and passionfruit sorbets, everything tasted just OK. I'm not talking about salt or no salt, even if that was perfect, the food was just not that tasty. This is one of those situations where flavor somehow got lost in the valiant technique and presentation. I've eaten at a number of three-star Michelins and San Pellegrino's top 50 world restaurants and the commonality among all of them is that for the most part, the food was straight up yummy. \n\nSaison, I'd come back and give it another shot. But next time, I'll eat at the bar (apparently you can have anything from the tasting menu and as many as you want, and it is way easier to get a table there) - you're killing it in every other way, but please give me yummy!!!", "author": "Snuffles B."}

The open kitchen, smell of the wood fire, and overall appearance of the dishes is simply amazing. \nMany of the dishes are absolutely perfect. The sea urchin on a piece of bread is something that stands out in a week full of fine dining. \nIf I were to offer three small criticisms... \n1. The meal starts with a hot tea, there is a hot broth served during the meal made of bones, and then the meal ends with another hot tea. Perhaps it's just personal taste but I found the number of warm beverages a little much. \n2. There were one, maybe two, of the meat dishes that weren't wildly overwhelming. The antelope, while obviously a rare dish, was cooked perfectly but overall, didn't exhibit any flavors that I felt I couldn't generate in my own kitchen. \n3. The desert was a little odd in that there were two different variations of ice cream. Both were exceptionally good but there was a point where it felt like I had eaten more than enough ice cream.\nAgain, the experience is well worth a visit.

Some of them were reasonable, but for the most part, it felt like the accessory were forced upon the dish just for the sake of being fancy. The flavors were poorly infused and tasted like failed experiments. For example, there were way too much sea-salt sprinkled on our desserts where they tasted more savory than sweet, and the roasted duck was so rough that I had trouble chewing and swallowing it.\n\nService: Servers are professional and friendly, but could have a better understanding of the menu and courses. On one of our dish, I believe it was a roasted beet, we had a cubic shaped brown sauce that came with it, we inquired the server on what's the best way to eat this dish as the previous courses all tasted funny. All he said was \"my only advice is not to dip the beet into the sauce.\" Well then what is the point of having the sauce on the side?\n\nAtmosphere: Open, welcoming, and original.

Baume, Benu, Quince but Saison is a cut above the rest. I don't want to say its necessarily BETTER than French Laundry but it is very much in the same category. It's puzzling why they're holding off on awarding Saison that last star....Chef Skenes is definitely deserving. \n\nSaison is an experience. From the moment you walk in you're transported into an open warehouse decorated with wood and foliage. The ambiance is completely inviting. If you're lucky enough you can sit closer to where the magic happens; its as if you're literally dining in the kitchen. You can watch how dedicated and meticulous they are in ever dish.

My water glass was consistently refilled (which TFL failed to do).\n\n4. Minimal yet elegant ambiance. The upbeat playlist featured my favorite tunes (INXS mothafuckaaaa) and the restaurant does not enforce a dress code. If the weather had been a little warmer on the night of my visit, I would have rocked my birthday suit.\n\n5. Well-appointed bathroom.

I must be the only one here who is practically licking my plate clean (it is a Michelin star-rated restaurant afterall ...but when you have food this good, etiquette be damned!).

Rest assured, you are in the hands of one of the best chefs you can ever come across!! So, dont worry too much. Just trust him! \n\nSaison has their own farm from where they get at least 80% of their produce. That means, every vegetable, greens, poultry, meat, egg etc is being tailor made for the the chefs requirement from the time of their very existence!! Isn't that amazing enough!!\nEvery bite of every course is beautifully thought out. \n\nSaison is not the place if you are expecting avant garde presentation with fancy foam and liquid nitrogen and what not. He loves his fire though. Most of his dishes are smoked, cooked in embers, lightly grilled near the fire. The chef is more of a purist/minimalist if you understand what I mean. He believes in elevating each ingredient on their own merit. A classic example is the orange creamsicle which literally is orange in a creamsicle form served inside an orange (even the sugar content is minimal to absent!!). Every detail be it the smoked caviar cured with their special salt or finishing the radish with clarified butter are so amazing that you will wonder how such simple yet effective things transcend the dish to another level!!\n\nService : 5/5...or 10/5?\nAnd the staff!!

The staff was as much fun as they were considerate and detail oriented - we were joking around with them all night and by the end they felt like old friends, a far cry from the stuffy suits at Marea in NYC who looked down their noses at us for rolling up in jeans. And the food! Just so incredibly yummy, which you can't always say, especially if the chef is being experimental and trying to make \"art\". While the dishes were indeed creative, they were also so delightful from beginning to end, and absolutely #worthit. Our absolute favorite was the magical uni toast, but I also loved the freshly torn pumpkin with shaved octopus and the antelope was extraordinarily tender.  I would happily forego a few months' worth of dinners out in order to save up to come here again. Such a special place!", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Highlights: Osetra caviar over egg custard and buttermilk biscuits (really?? yes. delicious); black cod; raw lobster tail on ice; sommelier-suggested wine pairings.\n\nSaison has a uniquely \"relaxed\" atmosphere for a restaurant with three Michelin stars. Example: the relatively loud late 80s rock music playing last night. Love it or don't... \n\nFor the most part, the service is nonetheless gracious and attentive.  One example of bad service last night, however: the host/maitre d' (though it is hard to categorize staff at Saison, as they play multiple roles) who commented--twice!--on my apparent \"Miami Vice\" look (I was wearing a light summer suit with pink shirt), as well as my wife's pink scarf on pink scarf on pink dress.  I'm not paying $600 a person to elicit your comments on my sartorial choices, little man! That's why the four stars... Honestly, didn't bother me personally much.

I have to put Manresa at the top followed by BENU and Saison following that.  Saison was wonderful and very innovative with ingredients presented in unusual ways.  I knew the meal was going to be good when they started us with a big scoop of caviar over a custard with warm buns!  Sadly, this was the single real standout.  All was good and beautifully presented, but no ooh's and ahh's.  Service was impeccable and very welcoming and being seated next to the open kitchen gave us the opportunity to query the cookstaff.  All in all, a very pleasant evening!\n\nSome clarification on my Michelin ranking...\n\nManresa - Inventive, whimsical and out of this world with layered flavors and textures.  Their \"Walk in the Garden\" is a true tour de force and the boiled egg with wasabi, sea salt and olive oil is unforgettable as each flavor serially wafts across your palette!\n\nBENU - Asian fusion taken to the highest level!   Great flavors and textures, but not up to the level of Manresa.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-14", "description": "My ranking for 3 Michelin stars in SF bay (2015):\n1. Benu\n2. Saison (very close to Benu)\n3. The French Laundry\n4. Restaurant at meadowood\n\nI enjoyed Saison a lot, although the tasting menu is a bit pricey (~$500 after tax and tip), but it was well justified. Here is my in-depth review of their tasting menu of June 2015:\n\nCaviar with citric jelly and bioche toasted with smoked pork fat (5/5) - The brioche was very rich and absolutely divine. It was even better than Manresa's brioche. And because the bread was so rich, it complemented the caviar nicely, which came with a citric jelly.\n\nDaikon stuffed with scallops with sea cucumber broth (5/5) - The broth was delicate and packed with all the richness of the scallops. The well hiddened stuffed scallops was also a nice surprise.\n\nTurbout sashimi (4/5) - Came with spices and a wasabi mixture. The turbout was good enough on its own. A solid dish.\n\nTrout sashimi with deep fried trout skin and trout roe (4/5) - A nice combination of textures and flavors.\n\nSea urchin with crispy bread (5/5) - the bread was soaked with some kind of sweet sauce. The sea urchin was melt-in-your-mouth buttery.  I'm a bit biased for this dish since sea urchin is one of my favorites. \n\nArtichoke and crispy rice with abalone juice (3/5) - the low point of the meal. I did not like the rice, it got stuck in my teeth too often. I also hoped for more abalone (I could only taste the artichoke, wasn't sure whether they had any pieces of abalone in it.\n\ncubes of vegetables, gelatin and ice that tasted like oyster (5/5) - Very nice palate cleanser. The ice cubes were my favorites, it was like eating oysters.\n\nburdock and cod (3.5/5) - The burdock was wrapped with cod skin. Also, similar to the previous trout dish, they had a piece of cod sashimi with a fried cod skin on top. It was decent, but not a memorable dish.\n\nwarm savory custard and cheese (5/5) - If I get to choose my last meal, this dish would probably be in it. The custard was creamy and packed with flavor, it was like eating cloud from heaven.\n\ncrispy kale with juices from fermented cabbage (4/5) - I like this vegetable dish. The bitterness of the kale went really well with the acidity of the juice.\n\nbeets cooked for several days in its own juice (5/5) - I did not remember the details of how they cooked their beets, but it was really good.\n\nduck breast dry-aged for 2 weeks with duck liver wrapped in vegetable (3.5/5) - The vegie was a bit bitter for my taste. The duck was well cooked but nothing mindblowing.\n\nduck liver with caramel and cream (5/5) - The dish was served in a small cup, at first you could only see the custard-like cream from the top. As you dig in with a spoon you would eventually get to the liver, which was a bit liquid-y like a mousse. The liver had a distinctive, almost heavenly taste that made me go \"woah... what the f--- was that\" (in a good way).\n\nduck broth made from bones of the previous dish (5/5) - This broth was so delicate and fragrant. You could smell it from a mile away.\n\nsmoked milk icecream with smoked caramel (5/5) - the definition of perfection.\n\nmandarin orange with sorbet and strawberries (4/5) - The sorbet was served inside of a madarin orange shell, had mandarin and orange skins underneath the sorbet, enjoyed it a lot. However, the strawberries were a bit bland and were lacking the flavors of a strawberry, not a big fan.\n\n\nOverall, price aside, my experience at Saison ranks (far) above TFL and Meadowood, which puts it very close to benu.", "author": "Eric C."}

I think for me, the key was that these items were innovative, delicious, and also comforting. Growing up in a Taiwanese-American household, many of my food memories have a tiny bit of American, but mostly Chinese/Japanese/Taiwanese influences. There was a course that was just broth, but likely the best broth I've had in my life. I wanted to put ramen noodles into it, but thought the noodles would distract from the rich flavor of the broth itself. They also had two teas that began and ended the meal. This might seem simple to make, but I feel like the extent to which I enjoyed the teas really speaks to the attention they give to even the smallest parts of their meal.\n\nThe ambiance is also really nice. The interior is very clean and has elements of a warehouse, but having the decor be books, teapots, and showcasing parts of the prep kitchen give it a more homey feel without making it too comfortable. It still feels very upscale and nice, but not cold and foreign the way a few other fine dining places can be. Also, I came for a birthday dinner and literally everyone who served us wished me a happy birthday.\n\nParking was easy to find on the street, and you can apparently download an app to pay for parking, or else use card!

Luckily, they change their menu frequently so every time you go you have a slightly different experience. The dishes that neither of us cared for was the salad. A server explained that each ingredient came from the Saison garden, which is cool, but it looked like a few flowers and leaves put into a bowl. Even worse, it tasted like random flowers and leaves put into a bowl... Hopefully they pulled this off the menu. I was also not impressed with the foie gras dish, my boyfriend thought it was decent but we have both had better.

I'm giving this two stars because it isn't as bad as Meadowood. Meadowood really made me question the Michelin guide for the Bay Area, and whether this organization isn't influenced by politics. \n\nDesign: Open kitchen cool. The attention to detail, plates, glassware, service, attention to detail, is very solid.\n\nFood, generally:\nIn general, most of the dishes are knock offs of other 3 star michelin restaurants. This was surprising and very disappointing. If this were graduate school, well, even a boarding school, Saison would have been expelled for plagiarism. That's right. Not original.  That's fine to make the same dish (kind of), but not at a 3 michelin star restaurant and not if you are a 3-star charging the most ridiculous price. Unless you're going to make it better, you shouldn't copy someone's innovation and make it worse. It is poor form and just unethical.\n\n\nIf i see one more restaurant that brings a whole bird to the table stuffed with herbs, then goes back to the kitchen to \"cut it for us\" and comes back with ONE tiny sliver, I will throw it at the chef's face. If your name is 11 Madison, Meadowood, or Saison, please stop copying each other's stupidity.\n\nA lot of the dishes were confusing, or bitter because the vegetables were roasted too long. Or the bitterness wasn't balanced with something else.\n\nA LOT of problems in dishes: \n\na. didn't highlight the center.\nb. fish. great skin. mine was lukewarm. I tried the other fish, it was actually cold, yes cold in the center.  \nc. I can't believe they used cheap abalone. On top of that, the rice was just ok. I also tasted a lot of vinegar (sauerkraut??) which overpowers the already delicate flavor of the abalone. \nd. The Uni on toast dish was the worst. It looks like it's going to taste good, but all you can taste is sourdough.\ne. slightly grilled Maine lobster. You can barely taste the lobster. There's nothing to intensify the flavor of that ingredient.  \n\n*Use spiny lobsters for fucks sake. California has the best. For someone that touts himself as an ingredient connoisseur, he used terrible ingredients. This either tells me he doesn't know what he is talking about or took short cuts. This is absolutely unacceptable at a restaurant of this caliber. \n\nThere was a lot of table-side service, like pouring the soup table side, but the one thing they should do table side (carve the duck) they didn't. Instead, they chose to showcase a whole duck only to return with a little sliver.\n\nRating:\n\nI'd give the service a 5 and the food a 1.  there were way too many unpleasant tastes or lack of taste. the seafood was actually quite bad (except the caviar). \n\nEven the plates and concepts were copycats of a Brooklyn 3-star Michelin restaurant, but not executed nearly as well.\n\nConclusion: \nNow that I just taught you to cook give me my $4000 back, and send Chef Cesar Ramirez an apology for copying his dishes.\n\nBay Area 3-Michelin:\nMeadowood= fail\nSaison= fail\n\n3 more to go.", "author": "Harry L."}

We went with the wine/saki pairing because we always do and very much enjoyed what was offered.  They stick with mostly white wines with a saki in the middle and start off with a little champagne, which is always nice.  The NUMBER ONE reason I gave 5 stars (which I almost never do) is the staff, they absolutely made the evening for us.  My biggest food love, hands down, we are talking last meal on death row kind of love, is uni.  Saison has a mouthwatering sea urchin on toast that is to die for.  Our waitstaff took note of how much I enjoyed that course and gifted me with a second round, I almost fell out of my chair!  In the course of the tasting menu we had a little caviar with smoked salt, beautiful amberjack, black cod with crispy skin and smoked caramel ice cream that tried to compete with the uni for best dish of the night.  The only miss for me may have been the hairy pig.  The meat was super flavorful but the meat to fat ratio was off for me personally, but again the staff noticed and asked the right questions about the dish to take back any concerns so the chef.

This menu and surrounding experience was impeccable. Like many others who have written reviews - I've been around the proverbial block of top restaurants on the planet. This was my favorite. But Saison's genius is generally found in its simplicity. It doesn't do over-the-top presentation with layers upon layers of complex arrangements of their ingredients. There's also not a lot of \"cheater\" ingredients (truffles, cheese, butter, foie, cream [not that there's ANYTHING wrong with those wonderful ingredients]). Instead think more simplistic. Think Japanese influenced, locally sourced (mostly proprietary), wild game/comfort...California meets ...idk everywhere else I guess. The point is not the origin but the treatment of the ingredients. Everything is touched by the fire - including the ice cream (sifted thru embers). The chef uses the best products the region (and world) have to offer, touches them with fire and lets them be. It seems he's figured out that with this approach, the ingredients will stand...and dance on their own. I understand all the accolades they've received - I think the culinary world sees this style as refreshing and actually pretty difficult to pull off. They do it perfectly.\n\nFood is king but I have to add that the staff was perfect. From the bar manager (Anthony I think) to EVERYONE else - thank you!

I mean, after a while I feel like they all sort of start to look the same. The service is more or less similar, the food is creative but has the same themes ... either you have no idea what you're eating and its good, or you just get a pretty solid entree but it's pretty standard. You come to get comfortable and you feel like the experience is more predictable than you'd like.\n\nVery few places wow me. Even TFL has somewhat lost its luster after a few too many repeat visits.

Saison definitely deserves its three Michelin star rating, and I found the experience more enjoyable than the French Laundry due to the higher number of courses, more standout dishes, and more intimate setting.\n\nThe dining room is very elegant and small, but there is plenty of space to move around. The place never feels too crowded. The kitchen is wide open, so you get to watch all of the chefs work their magic. We sat at the bar, which felt a little awkward at first but we quickly got used it. \nThe service was spot on and exceeded my already high expectations. Everyone was nice, respectful, and knowledgeable about all of the food that was being served. They answered our questions about where the food was sourced from and from a high level how it was prepared. The staff interactions all felt very genuine, which helps ease any pretentiousness that sometimes comes by default when dining at very high end restaurants. Lastly, since we were celebrating our anniversary, we received some complimentary champagne and dessert. \n\nAs for the food, we had a 16 course tasting menu.\n*** = mind blowing, stand out, remember-for-life dish \n** = love\n* = extremely like\n\n1) Infusion of some herbs from our garden\na. The presentation was awesome - a very cute mini bouquet of herbs\nb. The taste was okay, nothing spectacular. Tasted like lemon tea without the tea and very subtle on the lemon\n\n2) Tomato\na. This dish was served with some bread, which probably ranks among the top 3 best breads I've had, especially in terms of texture. \nb. The tomato itself was fresh and tasted great but at the end of the day, it's still a tomato...\nc. The dish was a little larger than what I would've expected\n\n3) Soup with radish and scallop\na. Broth was great, radish was great, scallop was great... not much else to say\n\n4) Lobster***\na. This was one of the standout dishes for me, and definitely top 3 of the entire meal\nb. The lobster is very lightly grilled and is slightly raw in the middle, making it almost like sashimi \nc. It was extremely fresh\nd. One of the sauces was good, the other was a bit overpowering \n\n5) Trout*\na. Served raw, very fresh and very smoky \nb. It came with its skin lightly fried and roe, which I love\nc. Very delicious, definitely something I will remember for a while\n\n6) Sea Urchin \na. Uni is usually my favorite sashimi, but the one here was not as good as I would've expected\nb. The uni was above average, sourced from Santa Barbara\nc. The \"liquid toast\" that the uni came on was pretty disappointing\nd.  Liquid toast was overwhelming and didn't even taste that good on its own\n\n7) Abalone**\na. Abalone served over rice with some special sauce \nb. The rice was amazing, probably the best I've had in terms of flavor and texture \nc. Very savory dish, definitely top 5\n\n8) Pickles \na. Palate cleanser that came with horseradish flavor shaved ice\nb. Shaved ice was a bit too strong \n\n9) Custard*\na. A custard dish made with cheese or milk or something, I don't really know. I do know, however, that it was absolutely delicious \n\n10) Brassica leaves\na. A vegetable dish that had cabbage or lettuce like leaves, and fried kale\nb. The fried kale was so fried to the point that it seemed burnt, but the leaves were very good and the sauce was awesome\n\n11) Beet**\na. Literally a beet \nb. I had no idea you could make beet that delicious \nc. Upon further inspection of the menu, it looks like it came with bone marrow, which probably explains it\n\n12) River goat***  \na. Holy. Shit. This dish came with a hot sauce that was the best sauce I've had in my life. It had a spicy pepper flavor with a hint of BBQ sauce and a buttery after taste. Absolutely mind blowing.\nb. The goat itself was cooked to perfection, great flavors and texture \nc. Portion was reasonably sized, big enough\n\n13) River goat broth*\na. A soup made of the bones of the goat. \nb. Very savory and delicious \n\n14) Ice cream*\na. Amazing\nb. Tasted like goat milk ice cream, one of my favorites, and went well with the caramel topping \n\n15) Citrus and Tea\na. I enjoy tea\n\n16) Wild berries \na. Beautiful dish, and really big... this is like 4 courses in one \nb. A bowl of wild strawberries, which even though they are tiny, they taste more strawberry like than any strawberry I've ever had \nc. A beautifully sliced dragon fruit half, which tastes like dragon fruit \nd. An orange filled with orange sorbet like thing in the middle \ne. A passion fruit thing with passion fruit sorbet like thing in the middle \nf. Great way to end the meal and the strawberries were the best part\n\n17) We also got a peanut butter and caramel ice cream bar that had gold on it, because the meal was not nearly decadent enough", "author": "George Z."}

And, that's the cheapest menu.\n\nThat's MORE than French Laundry! \n\n*GRABS ANKLES*\n\nI told myself that I would never spend that ridiculous kind amount of money on food again; especially, after spending $$$$ at Meadowood where we were served a tasting menu of vegetable amuse bouch\u00e9s (apparently marinated in unicorn piss) and we were left looking for the nearest McD and bar to drown our sorrows.\n\nWhat a hypocrite as I found myself at Saison on Friday. As we were seated, David, our handsome waiter asked, \"Any special occasion you two are celebrating today?\" Oh you know, just that we're 30 (something), not married, and have no kids. Why not forgo our first born here right? My gf and I kept this to ourselves of course; no need to look desperado. \"Nope\", we replied.\n\nSaison has definitely outdone themselves from their previous Mission location (my old review: http://bit.ly/1qEDhIF). Owner/Executive Chef Joshua Skenes' genius menu pushes the envelope on Nouvelle American cuisine with French and Japanese influences. Duck liver mousse with toffee, milk and beer--what the heezy?!?! Insanely good.\n \nCurrently, they offer 2 menus: $248 Tasting Menu (~14 courses) and $398 Discovery Menu (~22 courses). We didn't think we could stomach 22 courses so we went with the Tasting Menu. BIG MISTAKE as we kept eyeing our neighbors' table. You've already waited 2 months to dine here and you're at the most expensive restaurant in SF so you might as well splurge on the discovery menu. Just sayin'.\n \nThey require at least a week's notice to cancel your reservations, otherwise you will be charged the full tasting menu price per a diner.

Since the menu is seasonal, I won't get into the nitty gritty details other than each perfectly executed course which was thoughtful, innovative, and well-balanced in flavors and textures. Some people may say some of the courses are bland but with the use of exquisite, top-notch ingredients, you want to let the main ingredient shine which I thought they chefs team did. Artfully shine that is.\n \nStandouts were the pristinely fresh local spot prawns (plucked fresh from their water tanks), the crisped skin seabass with a exoticness from the rangpur lime and yogurt, the luxurious duck liver mousse with toffee, milk, bread & butter, and the carniwhorous delight of beef grilled alongside its bones.\n \nOh and I can't forget those homemade dinner rolls. OMG. Hot of the oven, they were like soft, pillowy natural breastests. *poke poke* Do ask for seconds.\n \nWith an army of 12+ chefs, each had their own station which they were responsible for a particular course, that they then personally deliver to you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-03", "description": "KenScale: 9.5/10\n\nAmong all the restaurants in San Francisco that I was planning on visiting during my stay in the Bay Area, I had the highest expectations for Saison, where chef Josh Skenes was winning accolades left and right for his tasting menu that was devoted to nature (culminating in three Michelin stars recently). Yes, the tasting menu didn't come cheap (it came at $398 before the mandatory service charges and drinks) but I was just in absolutely bliss once the meal was over. California cuisine is defined by the emphasis on seasonability and freshness of ingredients. The devotion to this philosophy at Saison was on a whole different level. \n\nEvery dish at Saison was telling its own story about the gift of the nature to humanity. The meal started with aromatic hot tea from herbs sourced at the restaurant's garden. Then came a series of seafood that was nothing short of outstanding. I was just stunned with the combination of different ingredients in each dish to create flavor and texture that was not only sensational but unique in its own way while maintaining a common theme of nature. I could certainly eat caviar any day, and the black cod with grilled mushrooms that came in pine bouillon had almost a zen-like quality to it. Lobster warmed over the coals was as smooth as I could possibly dream about, and the trout skin and roe was melting in my mouth, as was sea urchin that came on top of liquid toast. My revelation among the seafood dishes, however, was the grilled abalone that was as tender as a perfectly cooked steak. With the grilled pork jowl on top, it created a sensation I had never experienced before. Next came a series of vegetable dishes. Brussels and cabbages had a variety of textures from different cooking techniques that worked harmoniously with one another. I was also a huge fan of squash, which came in both raw and braised/smoked form. The standout from the vegetable offering, however, was the roasted beet that came with bone marrow and pickled rose on top. I'm not even a huge fan of beet, but the one I had at Saison just had immaculate texture that gave me joy every bite. For meat sequences, the kitchen started out with duck liver toffee with layer of break, milk and beer (to go along with a complementary glass of beer). It was another magnificent dish. The main savory dish was also duck, dry aged for around three weeks, accompanied by a side of date, whipped yogurt and ragu. Not only was the duck perfectly cooked, but the side was another stunning complexity of flavor. The bouillon of the grilled duck bones that came after was also very rich and aromatic. I was starting to get full by the time desserts started coming out. The desserts were somewhat weaker than all the fantastic dishes that came before, but I still wished there were more of cow's milk ice cream that came with smoked coco and salted caramel. The meal concluded with another hot sea accompanied by persimmon with ground butter and honey that was fresh and delightful.\n\nThe restaurant has that vibe that you could probably only see in California, bordering on the casual and classy, with fully dressed staffs attending to your needs in professional yet friendly manner at a dining room that looks upscale yet not stuffy, with the open kitchen on the side. The restaurant has a full bar as well as wine pairing options. Unless you're going for the pairing, definitely try a glass or two of wine picked by somemlier Mark Bright. Make sure to book in advance. Despite its prohibitvely expensive price that may scare away some diners, the restaurant really isn't that big. I don't know how else to describe my dining experience at Saison. It is the highest itieration of the beauty and elegance of California cuisine, period. I probably spent the most amount of money in my life dining at Saison, and I don't regret spending every penny for this remarkable culinary journey.", "author": "Ken S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-12", "description": "One of two 3 michelin starred restaurants in SF (other one is Benu) so I expected food to be really good and it was! \n\nFianc\u00e9 treated me to dinner here for my birthday. We had a 5:30pm weeknight reservation. Finished dinner at around 8:45pm. Restaurant does two seatings per night. Two different tasting menus- Discovery (~20 courses) and a shorter one (~12-14 courses) with optional wine pairings. We chose the shorter menu. Was full and satisfied, but still comfortable after dinner. I felt perfectly satiated. \n\nFood- The menu changes all the time so I'm not going to write about each dish. Meal started out with herbal tea from herbs from their Garden and cruc grande curve champagne. The dishes that stood out to me were: Aged duck omg. So tender and flavorful!! Then they serve you a bouillon made with duck bones, so rich yet light at the same time (wow!). The abalone in liver was also soo good, as well as the cod.. Amazzzing. Fish was cooked just right and skin was crispy and fishy to the perfect amount. Fire beet Was also so delicious in both flavor and texture. The beignets were incredible, so light, but not not friend enough. The honey butter it was served with was made from milk from their cow, super smooth and tasty (this is coming from a person who does not like butter). Instead of the wine pairing, we ordered glasses of Sancerre (from France) and Chardonnay (from Ernest vineyard, created specially for Saison)... Both were sooo good. Because I am lactose intolerant, they created a hazelnut milk ice cream (instead of cow's milk ice cream) for me.. It tasted just like regular ice cream, actually even better without the bit of gaminess! For my birthday, saison served me a champagne sorbet (since I'm lactose intolerant) with a cute candle, then the waiter poured champagne into the bowl. It was sooo good, they used Krug grande cuv\u00e9e in a sparklng glittery golden bowl. I wanted to take the bowl home!! Lastly there was persimmon with syrup made with armagnac 25yr and buckwheat tea. Persimmon tasted perfectly ripe and I love tea so it was satisfying to end the meal with two cups of buckwheat tea.\n\nService- Wait staff were friendly and attentive. Was a bit strange that hostess did not offer me to sit in the lounge area while waiting my fianc\u00e9 initially when I arrived. But she did ask later after some other people who arrived after me proceeded to the bar. It was a bit awkward with me standing in the entry way, just felt that that should not have been missed for a three star restaurant. I won't deduct any points though, since the rest of the experience made me forget that. During dinner, staff placed my spoons on my left after they noticed that I preferred to use my left hand for spoons and fork/chopsticks with my right. A staff member took us behind to tour their storage room of aged meats, experimental items, and produce. Then upon leaving the restaurant, we were given printed menus (with hbd printed on them) of what we ate along with a small cute jar of dried herbs from their Garden. What a way to end our first experience there. Warmly and sweetly!\n\nDecor/ambiance- good. More casual than you would expect, which makes it comfortable because you don't feel like you have to be too dressed up or super quite during the meal. I took plenty of photos during dinner and it they had no issues with that. They do have LED lights I think so photos didn't turn out very well on my iPhone... Had some streaks/lines in them.", "author": "Iris H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-15", "description": "4.51 stars. The food is excellent. Not just good-excellent, but really beyond excellent. It's not just tasty like excellent food in excellent restaurants tends to be, but it's actually mind-expanding, innovative and very unique. On the merits of the food alone, I wouldn't have even hesitated for a second before awarding the five stars.\n\nDecor and ambiance is fantastic too, although they probably shouldn't plan a 9pm seating on the patio in November - that's just betting too much of their customers' money on the reliability of the propane heaters. Service was good, not impeccable but the glitches aren't worth dwelling on.\n\nMy disappointment was the wine pairing, which really needs an upgrade. The pairing aspect of it was great - all the wines complemented the food very well. It didn't necessarily add anything to the food, but then the food was so good that it wasn't necessary to add anything. But the wines themselves were substandard. Of the 7 wines there wasn't a single one that I felt like shopping for. Not one. I got the feeling that the sommelier had more than half an eye on the price tag when he decided on these pairings.\n\nBut do some quick math: The pairing is $78 for 7 wines - and you get refills. So perhaps I should have adjusted my expectations, it's just that when I'm paying over $100 + tax and service for my food I want pretty spectacular wine to go with it. Let's have a premium option, please.\n\nThe Michelin star was clearly given for the innovativeness of the food and probably the quaint setting. It's awarding risk-taking and in the same spirit I'm gonna round up instead of down from the 4.5 stars that I'd ideally want to give here.", "author": "Aaron D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-06", "description": "First, let me note that this review is for the Salon a la carte menu, not the tasting menu.\n\nWe've really wanted to try Saison, but my husband is a super picky eater. He does not eat any seafood, cheese, mushrooms, eggs... the list goes on. This makes these multi-course tasting menus really difficult for him, since he ends up eating a LOT of vegetable substitutes (which he will eat but doesn't really like). Saison is especially difficult since there's no published menu in advance, and usually has a lot of seafood courses.\n\nOn a whim, we decided to try the salon after reading about it. It was really easy to make a reservation on a weekday. We got a 7:30 reservation a couple of days ahead with no problem.\n\nMenu:\n\nWe learned that the Salon menu is pretty much a subset of that day's tasting menu. On this day, I think there were about 8-9 selections. Only one was a meat dish (duck). There were two vegetable (beets, celeriac), one dessert (ice cream), one cheese course, and the rest all seafood (lobster, trout, sea urchin, a caviar, and maybe one other?).\n\nFood:\n\nMy husband had the beets and bone marrow as a first course ($28). The service of this dish was incredible as they took out a huge beef bone and spooned the marrow table side. He only had 2 little pieces, so I didn't try any. He liked it but it wasn't overwhelming.\n\nMy first course was the lobster ($28). This was barely cooked, more like a lobster sashimi with a dipping sauce, some smoked salt, and tiny bits of greens. I was initially a little disappointed that the prep was so simple, but after a bite, it's the most delicious lobster I've ever had. It was incredibly sweet and fresh. Fairly substantial portion also.\n\nWe both had the duck ($48). This was 2 pieces of grilled duck breast, with a \"cabbage roll\" of radicchio stuffed with roasted duck offal, and something called duck liver mousse savory toffee. OMG this thing was orgasmic. Best duck I've ever eaten.\n\nHe then had the dessert ($16). This was a tiny bit of ice cream with caramel sauce. Meh.\n\nI had the cheese course ($28), which was a huge cup of a cheesy mousse, served with honey and beignets. This was good, and ironically, super filling. I only ate about 1/3 of it and shared most of the beignets. As an aside, they do not have boxes for you to take left overs home. Too bad b/c this cheese mousse thing would have been awesome on toast the next morning.\n\nThe portions are small, but what they do is give you twice the amount that you would get on the tasting menu, so you're getting 2 bites instead of one :). We thought 3 courses was just right.\n\nWine:\n\nThe wine list is not just one but two books, one for white and one for red. As expected it skews very high end. We really had to focus to find something in the $100-$150 range for reds. We focused mostly on pinots given the menu, and found a really delicious Peay for $98 way at the back of the book (it was misspelled, so you can find it easily by looking for Peavy :). This was actually a good value!\n\nService:\n\nService was good. You get the same fancy table-side service you would get in the dining room, but in the much more casual bar setting. This felt a bit weird but still enjoyable.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, the bill for the night was around $350 including tip. We felt like we got to try the best elements of the tasting menu for a much lesser $$/time commitment. Food was amazing, but I'm still docking it 1 star for the price/value (for example, I'd rather go to Gary Danko for the same $$).\n\nI do very much want to try the whole menu, but just have to ditch him and go with someone else :). If you are not a seafood lover (or just a very picky eater, or don't want to spend $500-600/pps, or don't have 3-4 hours...), I would highly recommend Saison Salon as a place for the unique experience of eating true Michelin 3* food in a bar :)", "author": "Judy D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-08", "description": "A serious focus on food. \n\nI was lucky enough to be able to dine at Saison. Given the price point of the meal, eating here is definitely a luxury and an indulgence. \n\nThe restaurant is small and intimate, which maintains the air of exclusivity, and yet the atmosphere is casual and not overtly stiff. Before going, I had the impression that the restaurant was little snobby;  the meal will begin without you if you show up late and you can only cancel reservations with a week's notice. Yet after my meal, I realized that such polices are not driven by arbitrary snobiness, but rather the high standard for the food that they serve. They have no dress code, and while service is extremely professional and knowledgeable, the servers are very friendly and charismatic. I cannot emphasize enough how good the service was. From the moment I stepped into the restaurant to the second I left, I felt welcome and pampered. \n\nThe food was great, as would be expected. The ingredients were top notch to begin with and dishes were prepared with precision. The wine pairings really impressed me as well. \n\nThe menu changes regularly, but below are some examples of the dishes I tried. \n\nWhite sturgeon caviar, gel\u00e9e of the bones. This first dish was perhaps my favorite. Amazing freshness and I really liked how they used different components in the same dish. I would say this was definitely a Michelin star worthy dish. I'm not a big fan of champagne, and yet absolutely loved the the one they paired with the dish.  \n\nAmberjack with vinegar of the bones, served sashimi style with chopsticks. \nAbalone with sauce of the liver & capers.\nDuck liver with white chocolate sauce. \nWood pigeon tourte with sunchoke and sunflower seed butter. \nGrilled beef. \nPinenut and hibiscus yogurt parfait.  \nBlack sesame ice cream (black sesame is such a good flavor)\nVery explosive chocolate truffles. \n\nFresh bread was served throughout the meal. Despite the simplicity, fresh bread with good butter is in some ways perfect. The meal ended with some very good tea and as we left the restaurant we got a canel\u00e9 to go as a final and very welcome surprise. \n\nSo what's the final verdict? Were all of the dishes mind blowing?  Can I personally taste the difference between a dish at Saison and one served at a less expensive (yet still very expensive!) restaurant? Perhaps not always, but it is the overall experience at Saison that will be hard to replicate. Their focus is on food, and that is something that I can respect and appreciate.", "author": "Augusto T."}

The drinks from Saison were great. My husband's wine was fine. My Tropical Paradise mocktail was delicious and not overly sweet. The bartender nailed it when I asked him to surprise me with a drink.\n\nUnfortunately, the excitement ended there at the bar and the rest of the night did not go so well...\n\nMoving over to the dining room...if you are a party of 2, you'd likely have to sit against the wall facing the kitchen on the most uncomfortable sofa bench ever. Just imagine sitting on the hardwood floor for a 3-hr meal. Torture! Saison, you charged us enough money to eat there. Couldn't you at least invest in some comfy chairs? \n\nService was exactly what I'd expect from these kind of restaurants - attentive. And for $168 in tips, you'd better be fanning me while I eat. One of my pet peeves about this restaurant was that they would ask you for your opinion on the food served, then the minute you say anything less than positive, they would walk away and only return to hand you the bill. \n\nAnd now for the food...the list below seems like a lot, but keep in mind each of these was a bite-size portion, not even tapas portion.\n\n1. A cup of lemon water infused with flowers - I make tastier water at home with my infuser - beyond blah\n2. Sun dried tomato gelee with golden caviar - good\n3. Poached turnip scallops over vegetable broth - good\n4. Warm lobster with spicy mint radish and dipping broth - excellent\n5. Smoked trout and roe with trout skin as chips - ok\n6.  Warm toasty uni - excellent\n7. Red abalone with capers and seaweed - ok\n8. Ratatouille vegetable medley - good\n9. Pickled cucumber with horseradish ice - ok\n10. Petaluma cheese custard with green onions - excellent and was the best dish of the night for me.\n11. Crispy leaves cooked over fire in vegetable broth - blah\n12. Dried beets cooked in bone marrow - good\n13. Grilled aged duck with minced duck liver wrapped in lettuce - ok but too salty\n14. Duck fat soup - blah and too salty\n15. Salted caramel ice cream with cocoa nibs - good but not an ounce of creativity. Salted caramel ice cream has been done over and over by every restaurant and ice cream shops. Blah!\n16. Barley tea - another blah - I can get better ones from Japanese markets for a few bucks.\n17. Fruit gelato - good\n18. Mini strawberries and gooseberries - seriously? Did you guys even try the fruits before serving them to us? They were so sour I had to pass.\n\nSo there you have it...$1100 for 6 bites of seafood items, 1 salty bite of protein, 1 bowl of salty broth, 5 bites of vegetables,  3 ok desserts and 2 cups of blah tea...all of this over a course of 3 butt-throbbingly painful hours! \n\nOur parting gifts were a copy of the menu and if you guessed tea, you'd be correct. Was this really worth the $1100 to you?\n\nSaison, you are not deserving of even one star, let alone 3!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-04", "description": "We ate here about three months ago, but the experience is still vivid and fresh in my mind like I ate there yesterday. Not to get emotional but after eating at The Restaurant in Meadowood yesterday night, I fear that this might be the last best meal I will have in my life. They recently earned their last star for the upcoming year of 2015. And trust me, as the guide says, it is well worth the journey!\n\nEverything was executed perfectly. If I can say only ONE thing about the menu, it is that Joshua Skenes did not spare a single questionable dish. There was nothing added that was excessive or unnecessary. It flowed so freely and harmoniously. My mouth waters when I reminisce about that night's dinner and I oh so desire it badly (*fooodgasmmm*). Although I can only speak for October's menu, I have no doubt in my mind that Saison will continue to push the limits and excel while they're at it. Why? Because every dish was unique, creative, and complex without overdoing it or seeming like they're trying so hard.\n\nSo why does it cost so much? You will get three types of dishes at Saison. First, the simple most basic things like brussel sprouts or a bouillon of grilled duck bones that taste amazingly delicious because they just know wtf they're doing (techniques). Second, fresh, hard-to-get, only-the-best seafood like you never had before like the diamond turbot or battle creek trout, skin and roe (ingredients). And last but not least, the dishes that combine them both... the mind blowers o____O *faints* the dynamic ones that changes flavors in your mouth.. from umami to sweet to a pinch of salt.. \n\nIf you're not a hardcore foodie, this place isn't for you. If you don't like the servers telling you about your food, this place isn't for you. I definitely do. I'd love to know how much thought and effort was put into preparing my food for a night. And if I could afford it, I definitely wouldn't mind paying for the \"last best meal of my life.\" So wth are you waiting for? Go for it!", "author": "Lien H."}

You definitely get what you pay for.\n\nTotally understand why this place has such good ratings... from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, they absolutely make sure you are having a great experience. Only thing that's minus a star is that they're not super vocal about their total service charge for the night. My family's bill ended up being about $200+ more expensive than we thought, just because of this charge. So just a head's up on that front.\n\nBut yes, amazing service. Also, awesome and very friendly staff.\n\nTo add to that, awesome food as well. I don't even like fish/seafood, and still ate up all of their courses (BTW, sea urchin on butter dunked toast.... OMG). And if you have ANY, and I mean ANY, complaints, they are more than willing to substitute/remake whatever you don't like. So don't be afraid to ask.\n\nAll in all, suuuuuuuper expensive.

I love when I get to use all 5 sensory 'experience' : smell, taste, touch, sound and sight. I only got to use 3 of 5 at Saison (smell, taste, sight).\n\nI did a full wine pairing and I'm not too impressed. Some was a hit and some was a miss. Then I ordered some wines that were recommended, I was not ... too happy by the recommendation. I think I ordered a total of 3 distinct wines after the wine pairing, and I did not like all 3.\n\nThe wine I asked them to find similar taste to was a 2010 Pinot noir Marcassin.\n\nService was top notch.\nFood was delicious. \n\nI will come back and I'm hoping it gets better with each visit.", "author": "Nit A."}

If I wanted to eat sushi for $300 a plate I would go to a Japan! \n\nI have had some fine dining experiences that put this place to shame. The idea behind a pri fixe tasting menu of this caliber is to show a range of techniques on a mixture of different proteins and vegetables but not at Saison. My friends and I visited Saison expecting a well rounded meal but all we got was raw fish, dish after dish. Although each of the dishes was prepared to the restaurants two Michelin Star standards there was no diversity in the order, type of protein (fish) or flavor of the different fish parts and fish eggs that were served to us.\n\nThe first 8 dishes in a row were as follows:\n\n1) Sturgeon jelly with caviar\n2) Monk fish Liver\n3) Jack fish sashimi\n4) Herring with fish eggs on toast\n5) Fried Sea Cucumber skin\n6) Thick cut Abalone \n7) Golden Trout Row on stringy pudding\n8) Sea Urchin with Turnips\n \nIn summary a bunch of cold fish jelly, eggs, liver, bait fish, sea slug, and snail!\n\nMy hat goes off to the pastry Chef for saving our meal if it wasn't for his amazing bread in the 8th round we would have walked! \n\nSo if you're looking for a place that can make the garbage of the ocean palatable this is the spot, but if you are looking for a diverse dining experience where food is cooked and comes out higher then room temperature I would strongly suggest you go somewhere else!", "author": "Dustin R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-15", "description": "Came here for our rescheduled Valentine's. I'd been looking forward to this meal with great anticipation. \n\nTL;DR:\n\nI really wanted to love it. I tried for the first several dishes to convince myself that this was prime echelon, but by the end it was clear that the quantities and qualities were just not up to snuff with other Michelin 2 stars. At ~$700 for 2, this was the first time I've ever not been full (even after five large rolls). More importantly, the foams & garnishing flowers were flavorless, the 'smoky' preparation style was way overused, none of the fish blew my mind as they do in Japan, and the tasting menu lacked substance--meat, more poultry, give me anything besides bread to fill me up!\n\nTHE DEETS:\n\n***WHITE STURGEON CAVIAR, sturgeon belly cured & smoked on kelp, gelee of the grilled bones\n\nThe caviar had a smoky touch, very slightly fishy, but not distractingly. The gelee (basically cold runny jello) was sweet and refreshing and made a delightful match. The sturgeon belly and kelp on the bottom were not as remarkable as their counterparts. \n\n***(CRU) Coal kissed cherry blossom bream, cherry tree\n\nThe skin was lightly grilled & smoky with a raw interior. The meat was very fresh, but rather standard flavor-wise. The fried cherry leaf may have been a fun idea, but it had no flavor. \n\n***(CRU) Golden eye snapper warmed under some coals, bone vinegar\n\nFlavorless daikon slice on top. Again, fresh but average fish. Bone vinegar practically undetectable. \n\n***(CRU) Pickled horse mackerel on toast, preserved wild onion\n\nThis was *guess what*...smoky! (Any other tricks?) The toast was a bit crunchy. The onion jam was sweet and pleasant, more so than the nondescript fish (which was becoming a theme). \n\n***ABALONE, roasted over the embers, sauce of the livers & capers\n\nThe abalone was too firm and practically unflavored. Bland sheet of seaweed draped on top. The liver and caper sauce wasn't as creamy as I'd hoped, basically caper mayonnaise (in a bad way). \n\n***GOLDEN TROUT ROE, cured mountain vegetables\n\nRather large roe, similar in taste & feel to salmon roe. The underlying porridge had the consistency of a Chinese white fungus stew, i.e. slimy (as created by yam shavings). This in & of itself is not a problem, but it didn't add anything to the dish, which was otherwise bland. There were little roots & various mountain vegetables in the mix. \n\n***ASPARAGUS, cooked in their juices and then grilled, tuna hams\n\nNot sure what tuna hams are, but there were certainly no traces of fish in this dish, just asparagus in some savory juices (quite yummy), a little flavorless egg white foam, and green onion for garnish. \n\n***ARTICHOKE, stuffed with scallop & grilled, wild thistle barigoule\n\nThe scallop was much meatier & less buttery than any I've tasted; in fact I thought it was fish (very unfortunate).  The artichoke was soft, but insufficiently creamy and underwhelmed by the light broth. The garnishing flower was flavorless. \n\n***WHITE ASPARAGUS ROYALE\n\nA lot of flavorless white foam. I don't even remember what was underneath, but it certainly wasn't the white asparagus that I know and love. Must have been pretty average, as many of these dishes were becoming. \n\n***TOFFEE, milk, bread & beer\n\nEasily the best dish. Shrouded by *guess what* white flavorless foam, underneath lay a light cream ice cream with soft toffee bread chunks. It had that pleasant burnt flavor & a great soft consistency, matching delightfully with the cream. A hint of the essence of dark ale.\n\n***WOOD PIGEON TOURTE, sunchoke & sunflower seed butter, coffee beans\n\nThis was basically a hot pocket filled with pigeon baloney. Light buttery layered exterior, savory meat mixture on the interior. Interesting, but unremarkable. The accompanying sunchoke in brown sauce was meh, but the pear slice over sunflower seed butter was uh-mazing. \n\n***WINTER CITRUS, buttermilk, birds nest\n\nCitrus flavored shaved ice over some buttermilk ice cream (basically light cream flavored again). Birds nest makes for a fun title, added a little consistency, but no flavor.  Little garnishing flowers were flavorless. Pretty good I guess. \n\n***BLACK WALNUT, souffl\u00e9 and ice cream\n\nOne of the most nondescript souffl\u00e9s ever. Like a healthy wheat pancake. Virtually flavorless, and practically unsweetened. The ice cream was flavorless too and served over toasted walnuts and maple that didn't taste maple-y. A disappointment. \n\n***TEA\n\nBuckwheat tea. Tasted like a farm smells. Nothing special here.\n\n***TARTELETTE, milk chocolate & spearmint, lemon chamomile cream, chilled white chocolate truffle\n\nPretty darn good for mignardises. Buttery & rich, soft, creamy, & tart, baby pie crust.  The truffle was filled with a chilled liquid center and delightful. \n\n***CANEL\u00c9\n\nPretty nice little pastries, caramelized exterior, almost custardy interior. Very simple & unexaggerated flavor.", "author": "Elliott D."}

The dinner started off great- I loved a lot of the starting dishes, but there were some missteps later on such as overcooked fish and bland/boring dishes. \n\nMy biggest complaint was with the service. While the staff was professional and polite, they leaned towards the stoic and cold side. There were a couple of times where my friend and I felt like simple requests were rebuffed for no reason- for example, we asked for a copy of the menu to take with us so that we could remember the meal. Our server looked surprised that we would want one, but said he would arrange a copy for us- this didn't happen. Another example is that we came to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday, and the only extra we received was a tiny cube of a chocolate olive oil cake. No magical music box a la Benu, no extra fancy dessert plate a la Atelier Crenn, Quince, and countless other high-end restaurants we've been to in the past. \n\nIn the dining room, the menu price is $298 and optional wine pairing is $148.\nThe price of the meal isn't what bothered me, but rather the value. I understand the ingredients are all top notch, sourced supposedly at the height/peak of freshness, and the presentation of each dish was gorgeous. However, I didn't feel the love behind each dish as I did when I dined at the old location.\n\nI agree with Michael Bauer's review that oftentimes, the guest is left by the wayside in preference to the food, and the chef's \"ideal\". Where do you draw the line between flawless execution of food and pretentiousness? I'm still not quite sure where which side the new Saison has landed, but I definitely left the restaurant disappointed, with $800 less in my pocket, and an uncertainty about wanting to dine at Saison again.", "author": "Amy D."}

On the regular tasting menu ($248.) out of 13 courses, 6 were fish (1 raw, 4 cooked, 1 caviar), 2 vegetables, 1 pigeon.  There was one I just can't remember other than it was a savory course with chocolate (very little) and foam on top.  It was some kind of whipped liver.  Very rich.  We really enjoyed it!  LOL\n \nWe happened to get the closest table to the kitchen entertainment.  That is always fun!  And best was that the built in wall seats we had were actually very comfortable which was a must for the 3 hour sit down.\n \nWe arrived a few minutes before opening so we were shown to a table in the bar area and given a taste of champagne to start the evening.  Then we were escorted to a great table,the best if you are into kitchen watching.\n \nThe service was perfect, the staff friendly, and the space comfortable.  The tables are spread out, the noise minimal.  Though we were not totally wowed by the food, the whole experience was very enjoyable.  I am thinking it may have been an off night food wise.  An expensive off night.  LOL \n \nInstead of the wine pairing ($248 each) we opted to enjoy a bottle of champagne and then a really nice red wine with the pigeon, then glasses of a different champagne with the desserts.\n \nOur meal started with a hot cup of herb tea, beautifully presented.  The flavor not so much.  Next came a good sized dollop of white sturgeon caviar over a gelee made from its bones and a small slice of the fish.  Just a festive and elegant way to start the meal.  \n \nWe did enjoy most of the courses, some were exceptional, some not so much.  My husband is still raving about the so tender abalone sitting on a bed of its own creamy liver.  My favorite might have been the sea urchin which was a supplemental additional course from the Discovery menu.  There was only one course that really was not up to par.  It was the beignets of bitter vegetables with a small deep fried anchovy.  The puff batter, reminiscent of bad Chinese fried shrimp,  just tasted of oil and was so greasy.  Actually, anything could have been inside, no other real flavor was evident.  However it was accompanied by a tasty \"Saison\" dipping sauce and a small cup of a clear both made from artichoke thistle with bacon which we really enjoyed.\n\nDehydrated brassica leaves in bonito broth with some crunch of toasted grains and popcorn is a Saison signature dish. Too plain with no goodies as in photos of other Saison renditions I have seen.  Not even added cauliflower much less foie gras or an egg.  Some of the leaves were so dried they crumbled in my mouth.  No real taste.  Kind of odd.  Though I did get a bite or 2 with the broth, crispy grains before they got soggy with a swirl of some sort of oil which was very tasty and gave me an idea of what people have raved about.  \n \nI must give mention to the Parker House like rolls.  My husband, from the Boston area, had the real Parker House rolls at the Parker House Hotel many times growing up and is a real fan of them.  He loved them!!!\n \nWe also decided to try 2 courses from the $398 Discovery menu.  One was sea urchin toast and the other ikura stuffed pea shells.  We also enjoyed the cheese course for a supplemental $48 which featured 5 cheeses and 4 small strips of buttered toast.  By this time, I was so full,my husband was left to enjoy most of it.\n \nThe underwhelming dessert was served in 2 courses and was not its crowning glory.  The first was a small fruit like mouse over a thin crisp like cookie.   The fruit used was not readily identifiable, maybe mango.  It was garnished with strings of maybe raw rhubarb, which was without flavor or sweetness.  The second was Saison's signature canel\u00e9.  Buckwheat tea was served thus completing the loop.\n \nWas this dinner worth over $1000 to us?  My husband enjoyed the entire evening so he voted yes.

It is no secret that I heart food experiences and it was a \"fancy\" restaurant I had been wanting to try. While the food was certainly delicious, I've had better service at restaurants with zero Michelin stars (compared to the three they hold). I think when you have the accolades Saison does (and charge the prices to match), the bar is raised. After a nearly an hour wait for our table even though we had a reservation, rather than take responsibility and offer a sincere apology, I felt the GM tried to explain away the situation by saying they couldn't help that the party before us had arrived late due to traffic. I was disappointed that the restaurant didn't take ownership and instead tried to put it on other customers. In the grand scheme of things, for sure first world problems, but I wanted to share since I think there are so many better restaurants to go for a special occasion where you are less likely to be disappointed (e.g. Atelier Crenn, Benu, Coi).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-01", "description": "To begin, yes, this is the most expensive restaurant I have ever dined at... by $5.  But, although $ is always a consideration when you are paying these kinds of prices, this review doesn't have anything to do with 'sticker shock'. I didn't experience any.  What I did is compare my experience as a whole to my multiple experiences at the French Laundry, the Restaurant at the Meadowood; Per Se; Daniel Boulud's db Bistro; Jean Georges' J&G Grill; Le Bernardin; Alinea; ABC Kitchen; and Eleven Madison to name a few.  And I can say with 100% certainty that I had a better meal at all of the above except for the Restaurant at the Meadowood.  Then when I factor the price, I can conclude that the entire ordeal was simply not worth it... at least not to me.\n\nTo begin, I give this restaurant props for the overall experience.  The d\u00e9cor is magnificent.  Comfortable elegance as well as perfect lighting highlights the open space.  This is a small restaurant with some 9 tables and capacity can't be more than 18-20 people.  We got lucky and got one of the 3-4 tables that face the open kitchen.  The kitchen is, well, open.  It's as if we had dinner at a movie theater and the movie was the perfectly orchestrated motion of the 9-10 chefs/staff, all with white chef coats, effortlessly moving around the kitchen... until the end that is. (see below)  The music selection was also just perfect.  From rock to easy listening music, a lot of effort went into designing the space with attention to every detail.\n\nAlso perfect was the service.  Perfection!!! But I expected this at a 3 Michelin starred establishment.  They did a real good job all night long.  \n\nI can't say it enough... I LOVED THE EXPERIENCE!!!  But, ultimately, it's a about the food.  \n\nMany establishments, like Alinea and Saison, promise a one-of-a-kind experience.  Some deliver.  Some don't.  Others, like Per Se and French Laundry, don't promise a one-of-a-kind experience.  You pretty much know what you are going to get at these restaurants.  They promise perfect execution on a very intricate and very well thought out menu.  Although I didn't love the Alinea experience, as I felt it was too gimmicky, I left Chicago thinking that I had just experienced one of the most unique dinners of my life.  Truly, a one-of-a-kind experience!  I left Saison thinking... that's it?  \n\nThere were certainly highs on the 18 item menu this night.  The 'caviar' was my favorite item of the night.  It was a good sized serving of caviar with a perfect parker roll.  The 'battle creek trout' was the best fish of the night.  The crust on top was a nice contrast. The 'sea urchin' was the wife's favorite of the night.  Very well thought out and executed dish!  The 'toffee, milk, & beer' was a very well thought out duck liver dish.  The beer was a nice touch!  Finally, the 'burdock preserved in the wood burning oven', possibly the healthiest dish of the night (had to google it but burdock is a root used in many medicinal and herbal remedies, including its use in oncology to treat many serious health problems), was good. \n\nHowever, there were way too many lows for this level of a restaurant.  The 'infusion of some herbs from our garden' was aromatic at best.  The 'black cod' was served room temperature at best and the skin was not as crispy as I would have liked.  A missed opportunity I thought!  The 'lobster' was gummy.  Inexcusable!  The 'seaweeds in vinegar'... no comment.  The 'grilled asparagus' and the 'brussels and cabbages' were nothing special.  Both beautifully plated and both well cooked but, at the end of the day, we are talking asparagus, brussels and cabbages. The'fire in the sky beet' (Disclosure: I love beets!!!) was a beet with some good smoke flavor as it is cooked for some time high above the burning oven.  But again, it's a beet.  Finally, the desserts were good, especially the 'red hawk mousseline' (cheese and beignets) and the tangerine ice cream served inside a sliced orange.  \n\nThe kitchen was immaculate and was kept as so throughout the night.  Given the openness of it, I can see why.  But I really disliked the fact that about 30 minutes before dinner was over, they started cleaning said kitchen... and I mean cleaning as in scrubbing and taking EVERYTHING out of the cabinets, scrubbing them, and putting everything back in. These guys took shoes off and stood on the kitchen counters! While we watched! I do not see the need for this. In fact, given all that was happening in the kitchen, we weren't offered a tour of said kitchen as many of the tables got to do prior to us.  \n\nIf you are seeking a truly one-of-a-kind dining experience, go to Alinea.  I felt that, in this department, Saison fell short if that's what they were going for.  Overall, I also felt that they fell short in the food department.   Just not enough substance... and that's where the price comes in.  This was not a meal worth the price in my mind.", "author": "Lawrence P."}

So when we visited, I made sure to get a booking to give it a try. I secured a fairly early Thursday night booking. I do love the casual dress code. I don't mind dressing up sometimes, but when you're traveling, it's nice to not have to worry about having to pack too much. \n\nEveryone was really friendly when we arrived, and we were seated in an area that had a great view of the open kitchen. It makes for good photo taking. We opted to get the wine pairings with the courses as well, which was a good decision as they had a really nice selection of wines to go with all the courses. And some delicious Sake. And they were really good about topping us up if the drinks were supposed to go over several courses.\n\nI did like the Asian inspired theme. Obviously San Francisco is a place to expect that, and it was a nice change from the European style tasting menus that we'd been having at other places. The tea at the beginning was a nice touch, but they dropped one of our glasses, so they had to bring us fresh ones. Whoops! It was really cute though. The wasn't perfect, as the sashimi dish just had a chewy texture. But the flavor was nice. The sea urchin course was outstanding though, as it just oozed with deliciousness. I also remember the beetroot and duck courses as being top notch.\n\nThe buckwheat tea at the end was amazing. I kept wanting more and more. (And the packed some up for me to take with me at the end which was a nice touch.) I also enjoyed how after they brought us the bill, they brought out some more dessert. Because you can never have too much dessert. (And also I was a bit disappointed because at that point we had only done one dessert, and I wanted more!) \n\nSaison is probably one of the better restaurants in San Francisco. If I were living here, and I wanted a really nice meal for a special occasion, I'd probably be back. It's convenient because it's in the city and not far away like some other places, but it's not my best fine dining experience. Just a really good one. But with the service, food and wine combination, it was a really amazing evening. When we dined, it was ranked #69 in the world.", "author": "Grant T."}

My friend and I showed up after imbibing at the champagne society in an Uber on a Wednesday night and found the famed restaurant in an unpretentious brick building with an open kitchen. It felt like a tech startup in a warehouse -- and I mean that in the best way possible.\n\nWe were welcomed in and seated on some very comfortable couches near the bar, with a great view of the open kitchen. Immediately we were offered some Krug champagne, which despite the copious amounts of bubbly I had consumed less than an hour ago, I happily accepted. Some herbal tea was brought out at the same time, and a waiter came to explain the night's menu.  I opted for the full wine pairing -- although they offer a \"go by the glass\" option, I felt like to truly experience such a famous dining establishment you have to see what the somm had in store for each of the dishes that night. I think I made the right choice!\n\nThe menu changes quite often so I won't dive too deep into the details, but there's a very refreshing theme of fresh local ingredients that I appreciated. it was difficult to describe what kind of cuisine it was, as it had elements of cuisine from all across Europe and Asia. In the same meal, we were served generous portions of caviar, sea urchin, and duck, alternating between forks and chopsticks.\n\nHighlight of the evening though, and what I truly appreciate about fine dining establishments, is my introduction to well-aged Rieslings; most of the wine pairings I had that night were at best \"meh\", meaning nothing that was particularly new to me. However, I vividly remember the 1991 Riesling, with a great, dense nose of nectarine, tasting like a sweet syrup of tropical fruit. I have never had such a well-aged white wine before, so props to the somm there for making this great selection available to us. \n\nOverall, great experience. Very high price point but you do get what you pay for.", "author": "Richard Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-01", "description": "When you eat two iPads, it'd better be good. Saison is reputed as having the most expensive tasting menu in San Francisco, with the elevated wine pairing, it's as expensive if not more than Per Se or French Laundry, at Michelin 2 star, you wonder if that's worth it? The answer is - but of course.\n\nSommelier and pasty chef hail from New York City, dropping names such as Jean George. Two other chefs came from Benu, practically next door, seating is casual elegance. Welcome drink includes complimentary Krug. For the savory dishes, I would say the white sturgeon roe with tomato jello and the first uni dish were among my favorites, King crab with bloodlime was something else all-together, abalone with seaweed and lardo wrap, exceptionally good with a bit of artichoke to add the crunch, all very memorable and flawlessly executed. I loaded up on pictures, from baby amberjack to Japanese mackel to trout two ways to grilled tomato with tomatillo to pine mushroom. But that's not all, duck liver with toffee and beer emulsion and pigeon with suncokes and dates have to be the richest dishes of all, both exceptionally inventive. Then onto the epic dessert selections. Pearl sorbet to kick it off, buckwheat souffle created cognitive dissonance, passion fruit and chocolate chai warm tart coupled with dangerously great truffles, canele not unlike you'd get in Bordeaux and a little birthday cake just for moi. \n\nSommelier does know his wine, a fx trader who turned wine expert, he's travelled the world and knows his wine. Yes like a wine connoisseur who does it for living,  he agrees that one does graduate out of bordeaux and onto red burgundy, California wine is just okay as we have not spent the last two millennia doing it.  Elevated wine pairing spent much of its time traveling from Austria, onto Germany, through Bordeaux and finally settling down in Burgundy,  specifically, Beaune,  known by the locals and wine connoisseur as THE red wine region of the world. I was thoroughly impressed. Not a real California wine drinker, but I do know my French red, if I may say so myself. Thoroughly impressive journey. Allegedly, the co-owner was the Sommelier, I'd like to know if that's the case.\n\nI was in awe with Benu, though some may feel exactly the opposite, Benu had thousand year eggs, and is too fusion, some may say, and Saison is more mainstream and new American. That's all true. I would say the service is spectacular, what a performance.  But it still lacks a little bit of aging. Not too much but just a little more and then it can compete with the big boys like Daniel and Per Se.\n\ni liked it more than French Laundry, but that's because I've graduated my taste from country style French to modern city living. Per Se is truly my top end of measuring stick, and Saison is close, very close.\n\nFun fact, bartender is a young kid from Virginia, white kid who speaks fluent Mandarin, he spent four years in Beijing, doing Kung Fu, and he lived close to where my father lived. He asked me if I was from Beijing, my mandarin is Pekingese, adopted from years spent in my father's childhood place of Beijing, and we had a nice chat about Chaoyang district of Beijing, where he lived and where my father had a place. I was impressed by how good his accent was, and he can red Chinese. He was the first one who could read my Chinese name on Facebook, upon showing him a photo of me, taken from exactly 16 years ago, he pronounced in perfect Chinese of my Chinese name. Impressive, very impressive. I have only met one other kid, another young boy in his early 20s, who spoke with no accent. I'm often impressed by some people's ability to speak a foreign language. \n\nGive it a five because of all that, and it's literately a block away from my office. \n\nI must conquer Alinea next.", "author": "Victoria E."}

My pallet is not as refined as most who eat at these types of places and this was the first time I really stepped out the box to try new things. \n\nI knew going into this experience there would be things on the menu that would not be for me, but honestly I wasn't expecting 10 out of the 14 dishes to not be for me. Personally, every raw dish dish I tasted, definitely tasted like fish and salt. I know there were more ingredients to the dishes but that's all I tasted. The vegetable dishes(aka the soups and whatever little grilled salads they give you) all tasted the same(aside from the grilled beet and the parmesan soup). I felt myself forcing the food down, even though I did not enjoy it, because the kitchen was right next to me and I wasn't eating anything. That's the exact feeling I do not want to have, especially when the bill comes and it's $1500 for 2 and I still feel hungry.\n\nI can definitely say, the kitchen and wait staff work very hard and they do a great job on making things look perfect. Nearly all that served my table knew it was our anniversary and congratulated us on it. \n\nThe wine was really good.\n\nWould I go back? Maybe.

I won't go through all of the courses, but nearly everything was perfect aside from a couple minor missteps in the vegetables. They focus heavily on seafood, and specifically preparations involving things grilled and smoked in their wood oven. A lot of it comes with broths made from the meat or fish bones, or sauces made from other parts of the animal. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxed and casual, pretty much the opposite of what you'd find at a place like The French Laundry. The service is really, really outstanding. Everyone is professional and obviously trained to serve at a restaurant of this caliber, but has a friendly and laid back attitude that fits with the overall vibe of the restaurant. I forget his name, but the sommelier in particular was a great guy. \n\nI hate to join the chorus here, and really hate discussing the issue of price, but I do think it is somewhat of a complaint here. Obviously, a restaurant like this is going to be expensive, and that's fine. I don't have a problem paying for good food. But the truth is that there are a number of restaurants where you can get food and service at or near the same level of quality for around half this price. \n\nFortunately, they don't get cheap on you. The caviar course is by far the most generous heap of caviar I've ever been served, and it was the good stuff, too. They gave us two complimentary glasses of champagne (also the good stuff) as we were waiting for our table to get set up, and then a cocktail later in the meal.

Since it moved to this new SOMA location, I wanted to come but schedule was never allowed until recently. \n\n           Spacious place, super high ceiling, cute, chic and modern, the kitchen tables and the main dining room can hold up about 30 seats max. 6 seats at the bar and a few more table at the lounge, where you can have the shorter version menu.\n\n           Spacious open kitchen, beautiful setting, I got to see all food stations and it was just lovely to see how their dishes being prep. Chef Joshua Skenes was in the kitchen, and so his partner sommelier Mark Bright.\n\n            Mixologist Jake was at the bar, whipping some awesome cocktails for you Ladies, think of Magic-Mike, if you come here for a few cocktails, bring your $100 bills only! If you don't like wine, the cocktails menu here is well crafted to pair with chef Joshua Skenes menu.\n\n            Sommelier Mark Bright was greeted me nicely, warm, kinded and handsome always a plus to get someone like that pour you wines all evening!\n\nTHERE WAS NO MENU, NO NOTE this time. It was a journey of fun and full of surprise. \n\n1st bite -  a bowl of green jelly and 24K gold flake, pure joy!\n\n2nd bite -  Live scallop - simply fresh and sweet\n\n3rd bite - another fish dish, eithe fluke or kanpachi with deep fried fish roe, super crunchy.\n\n4th bite - crispy shell with salmon roe - so nice how I bite on it, the texture just went crazy in my mouth. This was fresh, sweet, just a perfect dish all around.\n\n5th bite - this little fish dish, sit in a mini cup like a cupcake shell, I got no idea what I was eating, (the wines were that good), but I wanted more of it.\n\n6th bite - this dish with a giant scoop of foam, once I dig  it up, it was avocado, risotto, tarragon, just warm and delicious. This dish was so colorful, refreshing, & too pretty to eat!\n\n7th bite - bread and butter were served\n\n8th bite - Sturgeon, curry, some crispy flakes, the aroma was insane, and the sturgeon was merely seared, somehow it compliments each other quite well. \n\n9th bite - Comte cheese and Perigord trufflelicious - It was a decadent dish of truffles and once can only appreciate it if you are truffle fan like myself, before winter is over, so these truffles are gone till next Fall season! \n\n10th bite - Special dessert chocolate, ice cream, and a lot of love by pastry chef Shawn Gawle (@ShawnGawle) - a former L2O, Robuchon, Corton chef! He served the dessert himself, I got to meet him so that was a nice treat.\n\n11th bite - Another truffle chocolate bite.\n\nWINES: This meal was a lot more fun because somm Mark Bright poured me some of the nicest and amazing wines.\n\n- Champagne to begin with \n\n- 2009 Moreau Naudet Chablis Premier Cru Forets - love any Chablis any day.\n\n- 2009 Chassagne-Montrachet, Les Chaum\u00e9es, 1er cru, Domaine Michel Niellon, white Burgundy - this was beautiful with all the raw seafood dishes served. \n\n2009 Kutch Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast - beautifully paired with the comte cheese and Perigord truffle. \n\n2003 The Royal Tokaji Aszu 6 Puttonyos, Tokaj-Hegyalja, love.\n\n2003 The Royal Tokaji Essencia tokaj, presented nicely in a box, serving in a spoon, Aszu Essencia, produced only in exceptional years, is the richest of wines originally created by the genius of the Magyars. The handmade bottle is a replica of the earliest Tokaji bottle, dating back to the 18th Century. Hand picked Aszu berries are macerated with top quality base wines. The resultant Aszu wines mature at different sweetness levels, generally 4, 5 or 6 puttonyos. Careful pruning in the 1st and 2nd Growth vineyards amongst their 80 hectares, hand picking and maturation for a minimum of 3 years in G\u00f6nci casks in 13th century cellars, ensure these rich, refreshing wines are produced to the highest quality. This wine was aged in used Hungarian oak for 6 and a half years.\n\nSo it takes about 7 years to ferment the grapes, then roughly 200 lbs to make this 1 bottle of Tokaj! And Saison serves it by the spoon, about $100 you can taste this rarest juice as its best! THANK YOU somm Mark for the wonderful service. \n\n            After all, the talented chef Skenes, former Jean-Georges, Michael Mina group, Chez TJ, 2 Michelin star 2010, very well deserved! I'm so looking forward to come back for the full 20 tasting menu. Service was impeccable always by the whole team;  Saison surely serves delectable cuisine and surely worth a detour! \n\nOverall: 5 stars\nFor value: 5 stars\nFor Food: 5 stars\nFor Service: 5 stars\nFor ambiance: 5 stars\nLocation: SOMA  - there's valet parking here sometimes!

So, when I discovered that they have a Salon with a small sampling menu I was definitely intrigued.  We made reservations for Saturday at 6 PM and went off to see what it was all about.\n\nTheir website said to come as you are, and we did.  While some customers were wearing sports jackets, no one was really dressed up.  All the servers wore gray suits.  \n\nWe got there before 6 PM but the door was open and we were greeted as if they had been waiting just for us, and had this specific table for us.  Much nicer than standing out on the street for 15 mins.\n\nSo we started with a cocktail - Number three - rum and pineapple and lime - I was not sure what to expect - but it was really good.  Very good rum, nice and smooth.  I thought that the cocktails were very good and flavorable without competing with the food.\n\nThen they brought the Salon menu.  There were four starters, two entrees, and two desserts.  Again, not knowing what to expect, and because we were encouraged to order everything that we wanted at one time, we were cautious in our ordering and just ordered one plate to share.  I think if we had known in advance what the size of the portions would be we would have ordered more items or orders two of some of them.  Instead we shared each plate - and left not quite satisfied.  \n\nOur selections were:\n\n1.  Live scallops on smoked avocado\n2.  Abalone stew of rice and abalone liver\n3.  Cold smoked salmon on vichyssoise with trout roe\n4.  Strawberry sundae of popcorn ice cream with chocolate.\n\n The items we skipped were\n1.  Corn pudding with caviar - $88.\n2.  An offering of various greens of the mustard family.\n3.  Wood pigeon\n4.  Another dessert.\n\nEverything that we ate was absolutely delicious.  The service was excellent. The servers took time to chat with us in addition to giving excellent descriptions of what was being served.\n\nWe will definitely eat there again.  Next time I think we would either choose everything on the salon menu - and maybe each get our own plate - or go for the full menu.  Haven't decided yet.  However we really did appreciate the ability to sample the food without committing to a major hit our our pocket books. Without the Salon option, we probably never would have considered the full menu.  But now we will.", "author": "Pam H."}

But don't expect to be impressed by the food.\n\nFor me I could think of so many better restaurants to spend $1200.\n\nWe had 15 course meal. Of which 4 of those courses are bitter herb teas and soup stock. One was a dressed up tomato, one was a cucumber salad that tasted like something from a grocery store take out.  There was a plate of bitter greens and that I took a bite and spit back into my napkin. \nMaybe I'm not new age enough but what is with all the tea and broth? All off the dishes had broth instead of any impressive sauce.\n\nTo give credit due - there was one sea urchin dish that was transcending. Our waiter could tell I wasn't too impressed with the previous courses so I was so delightful when came back and repeated the sea urchin.\n\nThe rest of the dishes were good but I cant remember flavors even 24 hours later. The last savory dish was goat. It was the best goat I've ever tasted, but then again I would never choose to order goat over beef. It was ok, but kind of wishing I had some beef. Hard to swallow spending $1200 and not getting a single slice of beef.\n\nDesert was a disappointment. A small scoop of ice cream with Carmel sauce. Then a frozen orange cut in half with some more ice cream inside. I kept waiting for the layers of desert to arrive and they didn't. Just another cup of awful tasting tea and a huge check that included service. \n\nWe had a fabulous table sitting right at the kitchen. Really fun to watch all the action. The only thing I didn't like about his was then they started cleaning up. If they are going to have an open kitchen they should wait until the guests leave before they start cleaning. It's hard to enjoy your meal when you feel like you are in the middle of a big clean up.\n\nI asked the waitress why the meal seemed to lack decadence. She explained that the Cheff had gained a bunch of weight and his wife put him on a strict diet. He lost a lot of weight on that diet and decided to infuse his menu with the lighter fair to keep him from gaining the weight back.\nThat's why they don't serve bread and butter and got rid of the end of meal cookies and treats. \n\nWhen we walked out of the restaurant- I was hoping to get a tasty treat for breakfast.

The dinner was a surprise gift from my husband to celebrate Christmas and 10 years together :) I'm the luckiest [cue Ben Folds]. Or, if you're at Saison: Phil Collins. \n\nI still think about this dinner. When people ask me how it was, I don't really know what to say. Dinner here was just one giant overwhelming FEEL. The price, the food, the moments-everything was staggering. It was kind of beyond me. Is what Chef Joshua Skenes doing considered modernist cooking even though he uses fire which is so... primal? \n \nThe doors didn't open until exactly 5:30 PM. I was delighted to find that we had one of the best seats in the house: one of the cozy tables with bench seating facing the bright, open kitchen. This was the place to sit. The kitchen was so quiet. It was like watching a ballet. \n\nWe had 3 main servers: Max (the somm), Matthew (the now-former ma\u00eetre d), and Simon (I may have hugged him). Everyone was friendly and tidy in their trim suits. \n\nEven though the wine pairing was staggering ($398 + $50 addition for sharing), we went for it. We couldn't resist the fact that they were opening special magnum bottles because it was New Year's Eve. Balloons hung in nets waiting to be released at midnight. \n\nRight as we sat down, Max poured us a taste of Krug (!). If I'm lucky enough to return, I may not do the wine pairing again because it was part sake and even if it's the best sake in the world, I am not a fan of the fermented rice. I'd stick with champagne (more Krug, please) and cocktails. \n\nI ordered a cocktail because he's the bartender at one of the best restaurants in the world. Max helped me decide (I was having trouble). They were offering 3 cocktails not normally on the list for New Year's Eve. Max recommended the Jungle Bird which is what the staff drinks, he said. A tiki drink. I was sold. \n\nIt tasted like burnt, sea salt caramel. It was layered and delicious. \n\nOur New Year's Eve menu: \n\n* meyer lemon water tea... our tea was served in delicate, flowery china teacups. they made me feel elegant and giddy. \n\n* anaheim peppers preserved in the wood burning oven, buttermilk... this was a delight! it was served in a small, crystal jewelry box and it was so delicious. definitely top 3 of the night for me. \n\n* [an exuberant amount of] golden caviar (with pork fat)... it _is_possible to have too much caviar in case you were wondering. it was a very generous portion. \n\n* lobster warmed over coals... served with an adorable wedge of yuzu... something in this dish tasted like... paper bacon. it wasn't bacon... but the umami was undeniable.\n\n* mt lassen trout, its skin & roe... the skin was like... a perfect potato chip. and the broth was... even though it was unladylike, I went after that broth like a kid going after the last drops in a cereal bowl. I think Simon said it was OK. \n\n* dungeness crab, the whole thing \n\n* abalone grilled over the embers, sauce of the liver and capers... I think this one tasted like bacon, too. I just remember it being very, very, very yummy. I liked the texture of the abalone. \n\n* seaweeds in seaweed vinegar... my least favorite dish\n  \n* blackgill rockfish, pine mushrooms, pine bouillon \n\n* brussels & cabbages blistered in the fire\n\n* naple long pumpkin, hung over the fire for 3 days... when they first brought this out, I thought it was beef! but no, it was all-pumpkin-3-ways and it was amazing. \n\n* toffee, milk, bread & beer... this... this makes your mouth HAPPY. (One of the best things I've ever eaten.) \n\n* whole duck grilled near the fire, a bouillon of the grilled duck bones, ham from the legs... the duck was delicious and the ham was like the best prosciutto ever. \n\n* red hawk mousseline, yali pears... my favorite cowgirl creamery! \n\n* ice cream & caramel cooked in the fire... it was ice cream. cooked in fire. it was ICE CREAM. COOKED IN FIRE. \n\n* tea & persimmon  \n\nEverything tasted like it was kissed by fire and smoke. That's the thing about these 3-star Michelin chefs. They set out to do something and they succeed. \n\nIf you're collecting 3-star Michelins, then Saison is already on your list (as it should be). But if you are trying to decide on just one of the four 3-star Michelins in California, I haven't been to Benu (yet), this is how I'd rank the others: \n\nFood: \n1. French Laundry \n2. Meadowood & Saison tie (I couldn't decide which was better) \n\nService: \n1. Saison (they talk to you [if you like that])\n2. Meadowood (they kind of talk to you)\n3. French Laundry (they don't really talk to you) \n\nValue: \n1. French Laundry \n2. Meadowood\n3. Saison", "author": "Christine N."}

It's cool, yes, but the moment and experience significantly outweighs a photo. Especially in Saison's case.\n\nWe had 4 people with the traditional tasting menu and 2 bottles of French wine, + 1 cocktail each. The total (includes service charges/tax) came to approx $660 per person.\n\nI won't take the time to list what we've had as they use their own farm goods and locally sourced things to fill our plates. From start to finish it was a fantastic experience.  They have a \"come as you are\" policy which is incredible for SF. You really feel comfortable in your own skin no matter who you are. There are blankets on all of the chairs incase you are cold, however, we felt the climate was perfectly comfortable (i was in a short sleeved knee length pencil shaped dress). \n\nThe wine book was the like an encyclopedia. It was HUGE. We gave the professionals a price range, taste aim etc and they chose 2 different bottles they felt would suit the tasting menu as well as our needs. NOTE: you can SPLIT the wine pairing. Don't be that person that's so wasted they can't get through the most expensive meal of their life. :) \n\nThere are a few things you should know: I hate uni. I hate caviar. I hate most things duck. What were my favorite things? The caviar, the uni toast, and the duck toffee paired with beer.  I would order a whole plate of all of the above and these are things I gag when thinking about. Flawless. Especially the Uni. Honestly, if you're reading this you know that SF is overrun by uni. It's like the thing that every restaurant thinks it needs in order to stay on the map (perhaps that and foie gras at this point.) This was spectacular. It had some crunch on the toast but was really soft and easily chewable. Raise your hand if you hate chewing a chunk of meat or fish in order to get your body to allow you to swallow it. Perfection. \n\nOther things to note: The desserts were all amazing. First bite is pure shock. Second bite: you can distinguish a specific flavor. Third bite: another flavor and so on. \n\nCocktails: You are able to eat/drink at their bar. We went on a cool occasion so this wouldn't have been the right scene for us, however, you can just walk in and sit at their bar!  I can honestly say I think Bill Nye the Science Guy or Mr. Wizard was the mixologist on call. We ordered 4 different cocktails (1 for each of us). Each cocktail was one to envy. It was like you threw the descriptives into a hat and the artist made a cocktail perfectly suited for you. I don't think any of us ordered off of a menu. We just said what we like and suddenly we were paired with the perfect match.\n\nI view this restaurant as an experience. It's not somewhere you should go if you're just trying to wow a date. You don't take someone here if you have a budget. This is truly an event/experience. \n\nThis is my first 3 star but I've been to many 1-2 Star spots.", "author": "Karen A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-25", "description": "I normally don't feel compelled to write Yelp reviews of restaurants that already have 2 Michelin stars, but this review is specifically for dinner in the lounge at Saison - where apparently the format has been modified a few times since they moved.\n\nFirst off, the service is impeccable.  The bartender, Jake, was able to describe each dish in even more detail than the various chefs who delivered them from the kitchen and he was an amicable guy to chat with while dining alone at the bar.  The hostess was also top-notch, having helped me secure a reservation on short notice and even greeting me by name the second I entered the front door.\n\nSecondly, the food is superb but you hopefully knew that before you looked up Saison on Yelp.\n\nHowever, while the food and service were entirely 5-star, the overall experience of dining in the lounge specifically compels me to leave a 4-star rating.  Even though my total bill of $150 inclusive is a relative \"value\" compared to an 18-course meal in the dining room, its still not a modest sum to spend on dinner so a little constructive criticism seems fair:\n\nI'm sure that many others have opined about the 80s soft-rock soundtrack, which I was able to get into up to a point...but when you're only in the restaurant for a little over an hour and start hearing the same Sade and Phil Collins ballads more than once, it becomes a little grating.  And maybe its just my inner Patrick Bateman talking, but the specific combination of those songs paired with small,expensive, and preciously-presented plates had me feeling like I was eating dinner in a Brett Easton Ellis novel.  In any event, there was enough good music from the 80s that the tunes ought not start to repeat themselves in the course of a single meal - particularly when played so loudly.\n\nAlso, the lounge was uncomfortably empty during my entire meal for an 8pm reservation on a Friday night, save for one other solo diner who arrived as I was having dessert.  I enjoy dining alone when I travel, but I enjoy being the sole customer in the room a little less...especially in a city with so many vibrant and bustling restaurants where the energy of the room enhances the overall experience (like at my dinner the night before at State Bird Provisions, for example).\n\nAnd although the wine list had some very exciting options by the bottle, the options by the glass are much less interesting and out of the two I sampled (a Chablis Cru and a Sancerre), each tasted like the bottle had been opened the day before  - which, considering the lack of patronage in the lounge, seems entirely likely.  Since the lounge menu is strongly encouraged to be ordered in its entirety as a complete 8-course tasting menu, it would be appropriate for the restaurant to offer a wine pairing to complement it.  And if not, they ought to at least open a new bottle for each service when charging $20+ a glass for wines that are good but hardly great.\n\nAdditionally, its a little chintzy that no bread service is offered with the lounge menu.  Its one thing (and probably a good thing...) not to offer bar snacks, but given that they already bake bread and serve it in the dining room, there's no justifiable reason not to also serve bread to a customer eating an 8-course menu in the lounge a few feet away.\n\nLastly, regarding the format of the lounge menu, it is technically offered a-la-carte with 4 \"starters\", 2 \"entrees\", and 2 desserts (plus a caviar course for those who indulge in such indulgences).  While anyone intending to just cherry-pick individual items would presumably be allowed to do so if they insisted, they'd invariably leave hungry and quickly.  Saison should simply make the lounge menu a complete tasting menu of small bites for a single price and dispense with the whole a-la-carte pretense altogether.\n\nSince my motivation in eating in the lounge was to have a delicious meal by myself that would not take 3 hours nor leave me too full or inebriated to do anything afterwards, I was happy with the experience (and loved the food!!!)...but under any other circumstance, I'd prefer to do the full menu in the dining room instead and that's exactly what I'll do when I return.  Which I shall..", "author": "Daniel S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-12", "description": "I'm struggling to decide how to score this, mainly because of the price. I wasn't surprised by the price. I was well aware before going in, but it makes it difficult to properly assess a meal. The only other dinner I've had with a $1,000+ bill was Joel Robuchon, which was pretty much everything I could ever want in a meal and then some. However, where Robuchon succeeds in excess and overwhelming the patron, Saison takes a uniquely different approach. It's considerably more delicate with a greater focus on locally sourced ingredients and vegetables. I will say though that we did not have the typical Saison experience. I'll explain...\n\nI noticed on their site that they offer dinner in a \"Chef's counter\" setting. I assumed this would be located adjacent to the kitchen in Saison. However, as we arrived we were greeted at the door and directed back to the street. We walked a few steps down the block and were shown through a private gate that led to another building altogether. Upon entering that building we found a private kitchen and bar space. There were four other guests eating next to us for the evening. To make things more unique, Saison had entered into a partnership with sushi chef Jiro Lin for a while and we had apparently booked a seating at his last meal with the restaurant. It was a uniquely intimate affair in which the chef made us feel extremely comfortable and relaxed as he casually chatted with us throughout the evening. \n\nThe food: The meal began with tea followed by six courses prepared by Saison. This included a wonderful caviar course served on top of an egg custard with melted Cowgirl Creamery cheese and accompanied by a buttery, perfectly cooked house roll. The other stand out from Saison was the pickled cucumbers. I hate cucumbers in any variety, but especially pickled. However, this was served with \"horseradish ice\" atop a gelee and it was absolutely incredible. So fresh and tangy. The ice really balanced the cucumber flavor. The other Saison courses were fine, but nothing too memorable. \n\nWe then got to Chef Lin's Nigiri tasting which included 15 pieces of the freshest, most unique pieces of fish you'll ever eat. Tile fish, grunt fish, golden eyed snapper, geoduck, scallop, bluefin tuna, sea urchin, a salmon roe \"ice cream cone\". They all tasted like they had just been caught, and were prepared perfectly with subtle accompanying flavors and perfectly cooked rice. When I commented that I could keep eating it all night, Chef Jiro graciously prepared me two more pieces of Nigiri but the sake had taken full effect and I don't remember what they included. \n\nThe meal concluded with a trio of deserts including an orange sorbet served inside of an orange, mochi cakes with a decadent sugary glaze, and wild strawberries with cream. They were all incredible, and I don't usually go for deserts that don't involve chocolate.\n\nPros: Ambiance, knowledgeable and attentive staff, friendliness, attention to detail, MOST of the food as described above. \n\nCons: Though I loved the intimate setting, I do wish the website would have further explained it. Not sure all of the food was worth the price. Unless I go to Japan I'd have a hard time finding a more amazing Nigiri experience, and several of the Saison courses were wonderful too, but compared to other high end/3 star experiences I don't know that the value was there.\n\nI wish there was a 4.5 option because the price is the only thing pulling me towards a 4.", "author": "Nick B."}

That might sound excessive, but really, it was 9 BITES of decadent, delicious culinary wonder.  I didn't know food could taste so...sophisticated.  \n\nTheir cocktail menu could use some sophistication, however.  They don't yet have a liquor license, so options are quite limited.  \n\nThe interior also needs work.  It's as if they couldn't decide whether to make it into a lounge, an upscale restaurant, or a warehouse.  So it feels schizophrenic, and the lighting is absolutely horrific...completely unflattering.  I had never spent a second of my life thinking about restaurant lighting before, but Saison taught me a lesson there for sure.  \n\nOf course, one must comment on the service of a $400 dinner for two.  Well.  They tried, but they didn't quite hit the right note.  The first course took an excruciatingly long time to arrive, especially since we had no hard liquor on hand to keep us entertained.  Aside from our very charming bartender, the waiters all lacked warmth, albeit cordial.\n\nWas it a good experience?  Yes.  Was it worth the money?  For once.  Would I do it again?

The star of the show was the beautiful kitchen with chefs working stations including a wood fired hearth. The seats where very comfortable , we were sat as close to the kitchen as possible per our request. Our captain was Juan, a veteran of fine dining he was as smooth as they come, he really made the night special. It was the end of our honeymoon and my Birthday. They knew it and congratulated us many times. At one point I asked my wife what something was and out of thin air there was Juan to answer the question, later on my wife went to reach for her purse again a server reached down and handed it to her. Ok, ok on to the food, The caviar with melted leeks and butter, decadent yes but worth it. The lobster with xo sauce was excellent. The liquid toast with sea urchin, absolutely amazing, great textures and flavors.

We made reservation at 7:30 pm unknowing that it would be seated at the actual bar.  \nWhen the hostest called to confirm my reservation a week prior she did not mention the seating arrangements to us at all. I received the email 2 days prior to my reservation which stating bar seating, it was too late to change.  We then later find out that all 7:30 seating are at the bar not in the dining room. So beware. \nI wouldn't expect a fine dining experience dropping $750 for a meal to sit and watch the mixologist tossing some liquid hydrogen over the bar top matter of fact over me.  \nThe disappointment began there, since bar dining is not quite my cup of tea.  The perk was the bar tender pour some concoctions that he had just created for my husband to taste and we also get a small treat of a tequila shot since I was asking him about it. He was entertaining,  well we made the best of our situation so might as well get entertain. \nOverall,  service was attentive, and everyone was nice.  Would it compare to the experience at Quince, or Benu for much less or even The Meadowood the answer is NO.  I think it's way over priced. And certainly not fine dining unless you can call bar top dining FINE!\nI do appreciate the complex flavors in each dish which was very well prepared with different techniques,  smoked, charred, fried, raw...complex yet subtle and delicate which is mastered for molecular cooking.\nPresentation for each dish was flawless.   \nSo why is it an issue you may wonder beside our seating were odd.  We chose the 14 course menu for $248, op out on the wine pairing and go with cocktail,  and sake instead.\n3 out of the 14 bite-sized courses was liquid,  one was herbal literally it's a tied knot of some pine needles and berries,  taste like green leaves in hot water to me.  Then a tea course in between and smoke duck bone consomme.   \nSo the other 11 bites one was brussel sprout and cabbage and the other was radishes.  Probably the most expensive bite of radishes and cabbages you will ever eaten too.  Average $20 a small plate if you do the math, unless those radishes and cabbage were grown on gold soil and wash in Alps Spring water, it was way over price. So was $60 worth of hot liquids, averaging $10 sip.\nSo I was also looking forward to the uni dish and the warm bread that everyone was raving about, sad new menu changed there is no bread, no uni for the evening. \nRegardless of all the disappointment above,  we do love love love the duck livermouse.  The chese course and the tender duck was also a big hit.\nOverall food was good, but we wish that $750 later we didn't have to eat ramen noodles when we got home.\nSo yes, we do feel a little disappointed for a 3 Michelin star experience,  perhaps it was overpriced,  perhaps it's the bar seating and too much cold dry ice got tossed, perhaps it's the small bites and we left hungry. It sure did not measure up to my expectations of a fine dinning establishment!   \nOh well, better luck next time!", "author": "Toni L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-22", "description": "Came here to celebrate on a Saturday evening. My first surprise was when I checked in via yelp, scored the \"High Roller\" badge (hehehehehe)\n\nThe dinner here is by no means cheap, but I think you certainly get what you pay for (in food quality, quantity, and of course the service). The food was approx 500 for 2 people, the \"elevated\" pairing we had was approx 600 for the both of us, with tax and tips, the bill came out to just under 1400 dollars (yikes!). For those who happened to come across my benu and coi reviews, I may be referencing those through this review (coi being the disappointing low end of \"fine\" dining, and benu being the pinnacle of it)\n\nLocation: skip the valet, parking is plentiful (that is if you come during a NON EVENT night...i.e. the ballpark), 25cents per hour meter. \n\nThe ambiance: modern open feel, with lots of wood and foliage, exudes a sense of intimacy yet open air feel. LOVE the open kitchen, LOVE the fish tanks with the fresh catch. The music was akin to radio station 96.5 KOIT, for those of us who grew up listening to it (and those of us who continue listening to that station today), it is what they categorize as \"lite rock.\" The music was tasteful, and at times brings back memories of \"those days.\" \n\nService: service staff was friendly, genuine smiles, friendly to converse with, informative, extremely attentive, in fact, I am not use to having someone pull the chair and push it in for me each time. In contrast to Coi's robotic staff with botox expressions. Everyone, and I mean everyone at Saison, was a pleasure to talk to, and yes we asked a lot of questions about the food, how its done, where its from, and they were patient enough to answer all of them. Everyone said \"happy anniversary\" to us, to the point that it almost became kind of embarrassing (like when you're in public and everyone sings happy birthday to you). But they were genuine, which is the most important part (or at least they were good at pretending to be genuine). \n\nThe food: There would be no point for me to list every course here, as they tend to change anyways. All you need to know is that there were approximately 22 dishes including the bread, add 1 more for the anniversary mini cake and add 1 more for the take home treat for next morning. I think its advertised as officially 17 though. Anyways, the food was phenomenal, each dish we had was spot on and creative (even the dinner rolls!!). What was especially memorable for me was the melon soup (specifically the fresh whipped coconut cream, so airy and light, yet coconut-y), the abalone was superb and fresh, wood pigeon with coffee (say what?!), and my absolute favorite-est-est-est of all...the RAW LAMB (lamb carpaccio). I remember asking the server \"that's raw lamb you said?!\" and she replied with some over-compensating statement like \"but dont worry, we oxidize it, and its safe to eat, blah blah blah...\" and I said \"oh no, I didn't mean it that way, I just never had raw lamb state side, its been years since I've had this..\" then I started drooling and her face showed a sign of relief. What I didnt care for that much was the tomatoes (again, read my review for coi), however, they were tastefully done and delicious, as much as you can do with tomatoes. On top of their wonderful food, was the wonderful dinnerware and glassware they served the food in, very neat and definitely made me feel better knowing that I swallowed about 1400 dollars. \n\nThe pairing: the pairing is broken into 2 categories, the regular one is 148pp and the \"elevated\" one is 298pp. The red wine was so light and exquisite, the sake was aromatic and refreshing, the sweet wines were tastefully selected (especially the one that tasted like ice wine). The thing that you need to know is they do second pours. So while each pour is enough for about 4 drinks, if you down it before the dish comes out, you get a second pour! In contrast to the stingy service at coi (have you realized that I hate that place yet? ugh, and they had fruit flies all over, anyways...back to Saison). So the thing you need to know about the pairing is...BOTTOMS UP, but do it with class, this is a fine dining establishment. \n\nThe last thing you need to know is that when you sign the bill, they hand write the amount, very personable and definitely takes the \"ouch\" out of it. AND AND AND, they give you a Cross pen to sign with, boy was I tempted to pocket that pen. I made a comment to our server \"i almost pocketed your pen\" and her response was \"you wouldn't be the first, and you wouldn't be the last.\" LOL, love it! But I didn't pocket it though. I may next time I come back though.", "author": "Long C."}

I've been to a number of Michelins both domestically and internationally, and three-star Saison wins in all aspects. I took my mom here for Mother's Day last year. The bill was more than my month's rent in San Francisco for the two of us (tasting menu and wine pairings), but I would do it again in a heartbeat. When people talk about food as a language and as a communicative medium, the sort of holy and divine journey that Saison takes you on is what comes to my mind. There is nothing that even comes close.\n\nBook as far in advance as possible if you want prime seating; I think they take reservations 2 months out from your desired date. Book a table facing the open chef's kitchen if you want to really heighten the experience. My mom and I sat next to each other so we could both watch in fascination as the kitchen went about their work.\n\nThe ambiance? Gorgeous. Classy, natural, understated, without trying too hard. A lot of high-end restaurants have decor that is either too minimalistic or too opulent; Saison's plays perfectly with their food philosophy of enhancing natural beauty. From the wooden tables to the open kitchen and the beautiful silverware and wine glasses made especially for Saison, the setting is laid-back enough that you feel very comfortable during your meal, but classy enough for you to know that you know you're dining at the finest restaurant in SF. No dress code--rare for a restaurant of this caliber and again reinforces the focus on the meal, not the patrons.\n\nI won't get too in depth regarding each course because the menu changes to reflect whatever produce is in season, but some of my favorites from that night were the reserve caviar, which was served with the most mindblowing brioche (I could honestly eat this every day if I had the funds to), the sea urchin on \"liquid toast\", the fire in the sky beet & bone marrow, the asparagus, and the amazing, amazing desserts. If you're looking for spicy, strong, pungent--Saison isn't your place. The flavors are subtle undertones and overtones that complement each other to enhance the natural flavors of the ingredients used. They use several parts of an ingredient, all prepared in different ways, to bring out the truest essence of the flavor. For example, brassica leaves were served in broth of the cultured vegetables themselves, and asparagus was grilled with a sauce made from the peels. The battle creek trout was served with its skin on and its own roe. There's a very strong focus on seafood and vegetables (especially roots). Everything is prepared via fire and smoke with a grill that is constantly burning almond wood--almond wood is \"clean\" and won't leave a smoky taste on food.\n\nBeverage pairings were spot on, spanning champagne, wine, sake. It is a LOT of alcohol, and the two of us little Asian ladies simply couldn't keep up with the pacing of the pours. If I went back, I'd opt to split a pairing with my dining partner. Each wine was wonderfully explained by our sommelier and never, ever overpowered the food (a difficult feat, as the flavors are so delicate). They begin your meal with a wonderful tea and give you some tea as a gift when your meal is over. The herbs of the tea come from their own garden, of course.\n\nService was--unsurprisingly--the best I've ever received at a Michelin. Our servers were personable, charismatic, great at answering a ton of questions we had regarding the food, the sourcing, the wines, the preparation. This must have carried over well, because we received a quick tour of the open kitchen as well as the back kitchen later. Fascinating to see how meticulous preparation needs to be in order to guarantee such an unforgettable experience.\n\nAll in all, had a mesmerizing and wonderful experience at Saison. Every detail was looked after, every unspoken request instinctively recognized and accommodated. Our meal took a little over 3 hours and we left feeling satiated but not uncomfortably bloated. Saison definitely warrants a return trip in my book--can't wait to go again and am excited to see how they'll evolve moving forward!", "author": "Chrystal Z."}

The second I walked in, I thought \"Hell ya, this is the BEST 80's song!!\" And I continued to think (eventually turning into verbalizing) every song that followed during my 3+ hour dinner. At first I thought it was kinda strange to have a kick ass 80's playlist at this type of restaurant, but then I realized how brilliant it was as everyone seemed to be enjoying their experience much more because of it. Bravo, Chef. Bravo. Smarty pants. \nDid I think the music was overcompensating for the quality of food? Of course. And as much as I like bitching about things, I can't in this case.

Admittedly known to Chef Skenes as well as Maitre D' Matthew Mako and welcomed at the door like an old friend it was to the restaurant's longer Discovery Menu that I was treated and with 20+ courses comprised of a cornucopia of exotic ingredients manipulated only as much as necessary to maximize both flavor and texture not a single bite would prove less than ambitious and, perhaps more importantly, delicious.  Undeniably a tasting menu rooted in logical progression yet at the same time often hinting at things to come or flavors just passed it would be nearly impossible to single out a dish as the meal's strongest and as such focusing on one 'segment' that exemplified everything from sourcing to technique one would be best served to witness the urchin, abalone, surf clam, and sea cucumber quartet - each plate a stirring tribute to its ingredients but the succession a veritable work of art with brine, bitter, smoke, and sweet all delivered in harmony with texture moving deftly from crunchy to creamy and back.  As much an event as a meal I've said before that Saison is the best restaurant in the country and although other factors may indeed be tinting my most recent experience I am just as comfortable now suggesting that both the food and the service better than ever, a proclamation leaving me to wonder just how much better it can get...and eager to return and find out.", "author": "Michael U."}

The remodel on the actual restaurant was done very beautifully. \n\nThe bad was the price and the food. This was one of the more expensive Michelin restaurants that I have eaten at. It was probably the worst in the quality of food.  Some of the dishes were fabulous while others fell flat. With three stars I expect every dish to shine and have a comprehensive progression. This was not the case at Saison.  I am really not sure how they pulled three stars. They must of had a stellar night that evening. I have been the zero, one, and two star restaurants that I would return to long before I would go back to Saison.  For the price, it was by far the worst Michelin food I have had to date.  \n\nNow let's talk about their playlist. Saisons insists on pumping 80s and 90s pop music at a very loud level. Never have I had music distract me so much from the meal. My friend and I kept joking about, \"what will we hear next, Hall and Oats, Hewey Lewis and the news?\"  By the end of the evening we had heard it all.  I don't know if this was their inside joke on irony but the music belonged in a roadside bar not a Michelin restaurant.

It's kind of a weird combination of casual and exceptionally fancy, though.  Perhaps it's a conflict between customer expectations given the price and a desire for a more casual experience on the part of the restaurant.\n\nIt's a very small restaurant, though the space is large.  A beautiful open kitchen takes up about half the space.  Dress code is \"come as you are\", and some people seem to take that to heart.  I'd say about half the diners were \"dressy\", and half were just nicely dressed, though not dressed down necessarily.\n\nThere are two menu options - the regular set menu, or a \"discovery\" option that's considerably more money.  We chose the latter - there are more dishes, though maybe not many more courses.  If we had it to do over again, we might choose the former as the add-ons, though nice, didn't seem to really expand the experience as much as one might have hoped.\n\nThey have a very large wine list, and be sure to check out the cocktail menu from the bar - it's got some excellent pre-dinner choices.\n\nThere is also a wine pairing.  It's a *lot* of wine - almost a pour per course.  They are used to people requesting to share one pairing, and more than happy to split it into two sets of glassware even.\n\nService was prompt, courteous and reasonably friendly.  They did recall that we'd visited their other location, and were welcomed back by a server who was working when we last visited.  Pacing of the meal was the best I have ever had at a restaurant of this caliber - we were never left wondering when the next course might be out.\n\nThe menu itself - very heavy on seafood, somewhat Asian influenced, with a pairing that was very European and white-oriented - is seasonal, and reasonably well laid out elsewhere.  Suffice it to say that we were impressed with the delicacy of flavor and technique.\n\nThe experience was just short of perfect - a napkin taken and not replaced, a lack of coffee and mignardise being offered afterward, that sort of little thing which one would normally shrug off until one looks at the price one is paying compared to an experience at Benu or Crenn.\n\nAt this level, what matters is the experience and the novelty, and Saison delivers.", "author": "Albert H."}

I have been to other 3-star places, French Laundry, several times, and Meadowood, once, in Napa so I have those to compare however perhaps the city is different. \n\nThe service is great -- very attentive though as one reviewer mentioned, not quite as polished. They are friendly and helpful but there were little spills here and there that were not a big deal but just not the same as my other experiences. \n\nWithout going into length in my review (please PM me for more info), I felt that food was all similar in flavors. Granted, dinner was in late February but nearly ever dish was smoked and was quite salty in nature. The daikon was smoked as was the fish and duck breast. Caramel also made an appearance a few times in the trout and ice cream. I just didn't experience a breadth of flavors or cooking techniques. Also, daikon (and other radishes) made a few appearances and as much as I like it (and I do), the multiple uses of it was not exciting. \n\nDishes to note:\nThe caviar and leek pudding was excellent albeit on the salty side. However, using the bread as the vehicle was amazing. \n\nDishes not so great:\nFish was undercooked where it was 'sticking' to each flake.\nDuck broth could have been served warmer. Since it was cooler, it started to taste and feel really greasy. \n\nWine was good although I'm not very experienced in it. I just know what I like and I think the sommelier did a good job. \n\nI also felt like the amount of food for the price was very little.

Saison has retained its same style as well as its incredibly creative, ambitious and progressive approach to food.  Many restaurants promise a one-of-a-kind experience like The French Laundry, Alinea and minibar by Jose Andres, but Saison stands so far above them in how it delivers perfectly prepared and delicious cuisine while also making you truly marvel at what they have put together (and how they did it).  Saison also has the advantage of drawing from the many great local California farms.  Simply put, I cannot imagine a restaurant that can deliver the type of thoughtful and delicious cuisine you will experience at Saison.\n\nSaison mostly showcases seafood and they keep a lot of it in its natural state (or close to it) by using slow cooking techniques like smoking, poaching and lightly grilling.  Their Hassun-like seafood offering unveiled one perfectly rendered protein after another as well as vibrant flavors and pleasing textures.  A lightly grilled scallop was centered between velvety celeriac pur\u00e9e and perfectly crisp and sweet pear while mackerel and goldeneye snapper were accompanied by nicely pickled elements.  And the trout roe was the best part--bursting with juiciness alongside creamy custard and variations of tomato to provide a truly unique flavor experience.\n\nSlowly poached and lightly grilled black cod delivered the moistness and flakiness you often find with this fish elsewhere, but Saison avoided the typical miso trap of many other restaurants.  It integrated a caramelized plantain chip instead with a sauce featuring a truly distinct and unique variation of lime.\n\nThere was also great uni with custard as well as briny caviar with potato (served both creamy and as a gelee).  Sea cucumber was used to create tasty and crispy chicharrones and they utilized egg yolk and the sea cucumber innards to create a rich sauce (respecting the ingredient by utilizing all of it is a common theme at Saison).\n\nSaison is excellent at showcasing vegetables, poultry and meats too.  Rutabaga was nicely tender but also had a great caramelization that provided a completely different texture as well as flavor. The cardoon soup had the warmness and heartiness (as well as a great smoky bacon-like flavor) of a great soup, but there was also white truffle to make the soup feel luxurious as well.\n\nVery aromatic white truffle was also used in the truly creative cookie of pecan, brittle and creamy duck giblets.  Saison followed up the made for a king rabbit course I had last time with a similarly royal-esque entree of a perfectly baked tourte with a very juicy wood pigeon center as well as excellent red cabbage and apple pur\u00e9e.\n\nSweets unveiled one great item after another like the best pre-dessert I've ever had--cool and refreshing pear sorbet with creamy panna cotta and sweet pain d'epices.  Flavors of black walnut were in the souffl\u00e9 and ice cream (so great to have a baked to order dessert; a rarity these days).  There was a variety of mignardises and for-later treats and the highlight might have been the chocolate truffle with liquid coffee cream center.\n\nService was excellent.  The staff is very polished and food is perfectly presented.  I really liked my server.  She was very professional, but she was also hipper and more down to earth than what you typically get at high-end restaurants.  This was both refreshing as well as very fitting with Saison's personality.  Saison's chefs even present courses a la minibar.\n\nThe dining room is very nice with an impressive and immaculate kitchen at the center.  It is best to get a view of the kitchen where you can see the precision, skill, organization, and teamwork needed to pull off a special restaurant like Saison.\n\nPrices are high, but it is also a once-in-a-lifetime experience so if you compare it to staying at one of the country's best hotels, having the best seat/suite on a top international airline or driving a super car, it is a relative value.\n\nIf you are seeking a truly one-of-a-kind dining experience, you need to look no further than Saison.  It is a restaurant that has few equals in all areas of the dining experience be it the quality and freshness of the produce, the handling and cooking of the proteins, the creativeness of the menu, the striking dining room, or the wonderful service.  I will continue to search for a restaurant that can deliver an experience more rewarding than Saison, but I know that it is probably not possible.\n\nValet parking is available.  Street parking can also probably be found on a night when the Giants are not playing.", "author": "Anthony N."}

You read all these five star reviews shouting awesome, sublime, culinary experience of a lifetime and then there are the outliers like me. But in all honesty, I was so underwhelmed, I almost died a little bit inside. Huh...did I miss something? Did my taste buds pack their bags and go home?!\nI was so excited for Saison. My only other 3 star experience had been at Benu (when it was a 2 star) and that place was beyond expectations awesome.\nFood, overall, is good but nothing that really gave me the tingles. The broth dishes were okay but being Asian, I have had my share of rich broth growing up so nothing out of the ordinary and flavors I haven't had before. I think the highlight of the meal was dessert, which I'm not a huge fan of. Also, several of the dishes had that same flavor profile, smokey. Smokey after smokey. I was smoked out after a couple of them. \nHowever, the most shocking part of the meal was a dish with kale where the guy was supposed to pour broth into. I was last to get served the broth only to see that there was none but maybe a drop or two left. Much to my dismay and shock, the guy never came back with more broth. And let me tell you, the others' dishes were filled with it. It was not even a glass half-empty scenario, just a glass empty one. I was speechless that a restaurant like this would just ignore the whole situation. I knew it, the broth guy knew it, that there was no broth in my dish. Maybe I should've said something but then again this is a three star restaurant right? If they are so quick to pull out my chair and fold my napkin after every time I go to the restroom, shouldn't they serve me the dish right too?! \nLeft the restaurant hungry and I'm ashamed to admit, I headed straight to jack n' the box for a sourdough and curly fries.", "author": "Julie L."}

We were also hoping to complete our visits to all of the 3 Michelin Star restaurants in the bay area (But Manresa just got its 3rd star so we got a new one on our list). We love fusion food, especially Japanese fusion. We were seated at a table that faces the kitchen. They have an open kitchen, so you can see everything that's going on. As their menu changes quite often, I won't go into detail about what we had (as it maybe different from when you visit). The most common question I get is if they're \"worth it\". Well, given they're the most expensive restaurant in California, they do have a pretty high price tag. People may say it's too expensive for the food that they serve. However, remember when you come to a restaurant like this, you're also paying for the experience and service. I don't think the meal was \"life-changing\". But it's definitely one of the top meal I've ever had. And having gone to Meadowood, Benu, and French Laundry, I would say Saison is better than French Laundry in my book (but remember, I like fusion food). Benu is better in my opinion (they're Chinese fusion while Saison is Japanese fusion), but Saison is a close second. Would I come back again? Definitely. If you're hesitant about the price tag, this may not be for you as you may leave being unhappy about the price despite a stellar meal. But I definitely think it's a restaurant that's worthy of a visit!", "author": "Sharon L."}

I had read a lot of the good reviews (and some bad). I had heard so many of my foodie friends talk about this place. I wanted to see if it lived up to its hype!\n\nReservations: On opentable.com, you can make them 2 months in advance. If there isn't anything available, I highly recommend calling them. They might have booth seating in the saloon bar area, but you won't get to see the open kitchen. I ended up calling a month before and all the 8 dining tables were booked, but they had one spot in the saloon area at 8pm. I took it! I kept checking on opentable.com to see if there were any cancelations. Nothing. I emailed them the week of and was extremely fortunately to get an open spot! Persistence! \n\nParking: There's plenty of metered parking nearby, but do read the signs very carefully (some only allow you to park for 20 minutes). We were lucky to find street parking on the SE corner of Brannan St. & 3rd St.\n\nThe Story: While walking to the restaurant, I asked my bf to guess where we might be eating that night. He guessed Tres and something along The Embarcadero. lol As we stop in front of Saison, I smiled and looked at him and the first thing he said to me was \"No way!\" haha Yes way! He apparently has been trying to get reservations to here for years! And I did it in one try! :D\n\nRight when you walk in, you are immediately greeted by a host and they seat you at the bar for a complementary glass of champagne! We ordered some drinks too. Then, our table was ready and we were seated right in front of the kitchen, next to the fish tank! It was an amazing evening! We were able to see all the action happening in front of us and enjoy all the wonderful courses! I loved that each table had a furry pillow and blanket! \n\nI almost wanted to pass out after our fifth meal! lol I didn't know how to pace myself! So there isn't any set menu or set price. It's whatever the chef feels like making and depends on what ingredients they have. They'll just want to know if you're allergic to anything. We added a special dish (p\u00e9rigold black truffle, koshihikari rice, parmesan) they were serving that night, but it wasn't as great as the other dishes we had that evening. I'd pass on it next time. I love seafood, so I didn't have one favorite dish. I loved them all, even the brioche loaf and the butter!!!! (They ended up packing one for us to take home!) Wow. The details and thought that went into each dish was simple yet intriguing! I loved the dinnerwares of each course! Everything seemed to come together. By the time we got to the tea, I couldn't eat or swallow anymore. lol I've never felt this full and satisfied after a meal! I wanted to lay down on the furry pillow.\n\nStaff and service was exceptional! Mark and Patrick were extremely helpful at answering all of our silly foodie questions! After dinner we got to talk to them and see the fish tank where there's live uni, abalone, sea cucumber, etc.! And upstairs they apparently have around $200k worth of dinnerware, but we didn't get the opportunity to see that. :( \n\nI highly recommend coming to Saison for any special occasion! It is definitely worth it to sit as close as you can to the kitchen! And make sure you fast during the day or wear something stretchy while dining! haha\n\n\nTIPS:\n- Book ASAP! There are only 8 tables!\n- Seafood heavy... I hope you love seafood! :D\n- Price shouldn't matter because you won't know until after you see the check!", "author": "CeCe C."}

(I ate here a couple months before it was granted 3 Michelin stars.)\n\nTo put things in perspective, I've been to a hefty amount of Michelin-starred restaurants (to list them all would make me seem crazy), and Saison was a complete and total standout. It's right up there with the best of them (Eleven Madison Park, Momofuku Ko), and beats out some of its more tired brethren (Per Se, Le Bernardin).\n\n**FOOD!**\n\nI had a really outstanding meal here, the best dishes being:\n\n*An awesome dessert-like duck liver mousse (with toffee, milk, bread, and beer)\n*The uni-on-toast dish, which was probably the most magical bite of the night\n*Roasted abalone!!! Soooo tender.\n*Silky soft cheese from their cow \"Vibrance\"\n*The KRUG sorbet!!! I wish I had enough money to make NV Krug into sorbet all the time. :) \n*The beautifully delicate french marigold panna cotta\n*Buckwheat tea at the end--where has this been my whole life??? Super nutty, I could drink gallons of it.\n\n**SERVICE!**\n\nMy main waiter was also super awesome.  He had apparently recently moved to SF just to work at Saison.\n\n*While waiting for the duck mousse dish, he gave me a tour around the open kitchen (which was really beautiful and pristine).  They had live sea cucumbers in a tank for the next day's tasting menu, which was cool!\n*One of my other waiters comped me an entire loaf of bread (Parker House rolls) because I asked if I could wrap up the couple rolls I had left.  I told him he didn't have to, but he insisted (and I'm glad he did).\n*One of the chef guys delivered a duck dish, and he just seemed really enthusiastic about the \"sea figs\" they had foraged (which was adorable)\n*When I left for the door, my main waiter guy was there to give me a firm handshake (and the to-go treats everyone gets!).\n\n**OVERALL**\n\nI cannot recommend this place enough.  It's in my top three favorite 3-Michelin-star restaurants (alongside, but very different from, Eleven Madison Park and Alinea).  Also my favorite restaurant in San Francisco.

The low notes: The only meat dish was pigeon and the remainder of dishes were mainly fish.   Many of the courses were unique and interesting but it wasn't enough to overshadow the dishes that consisted of 1/4 piece of asparagus or a sliver of raw fish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-18", "description": "Saison is an interesting experience.  The ambiance is hard to pigeonhole, but it feels very California, with an industrial base to support the SOMA location and a heavy focus on wood, which compliments the flavor profile of the menu.  I definitely didn't care for the the 70's and 80's pop music (and I gather many other people feel the same way), but I guess that's what you get when the kitchen is literally a part of the dining room and the Chef plays music that he likes to cook to.\n\nThe food at Saison is exciting.  It features flavors and combinations that I haven't tasted before and that I don't think any other restaurants are really attempting to achieve.  The underlying theme through most of the courses is smoke, imparted by their big wooden cooking-pit thing.  The entire menu almost seems like an attempt to take that base flavor - that embery smoke - in different directions to really explore the \"smoke space\" of flavor, if you will.  There's more to smoke than tasting like burnt wood, as I learned, and the menu evokes nuances of the ingredients and that fiery undertone in a way that is apparently unique to Saison.  That is pretty exciting.\n\nThe other really exciting thing about Saison is the ingredients.  The Bay Area has long prided itself on farm-to-table, locally sourced, organic ingredients, thanks to folks like Alice Waters and all those people up in Napa.  Saison is shifting that same focus from the farm-on-land towards the coast, right into that frothy border between the open Pacific and California's foggy coastal range.  To California's farm in the sea, so to speak.  And I don't mean like salmon and tuna, I mean like all the nitty-gritty bits you get digging around right off the coast from Monterey up through Fort Bragg; the stuff dug up by their dedicated seaweed and shellfish dive forager (I'm not even joking about that).\n\nSo rather than sampling California's farmland bounty, as has already been done countless times by restaurants all over the bay area, we get to sample California's coastal bounty, from the seaweed and kelp all the way up to the abalone, sea urchin, and swimmier fish like herring, amberjack, and trout.  \n\nJust to mention one of the dishes - the \"it\" dish for me (i.e., that one dish in a tasting menu that makes everything click in harmony in your head for the first time) was a sea urchin served in its own spiny shell over a bed of kelp, with various morsels including but not at all limited to turnips and a sea-water froth reminiscent of Ocean beach at high tide.  It looked and tasted exactly like San Francisco smells.  You know, that walk along the pier, under the golden gate bridge, or along the tide pools of Northern California, where the wind blows just right off the water and a wave crashes and blows mist in your face.  That smell.  Perfectly embodied in presentation and taste.  Something that made me immediately remember where we are and why it's a wonderful place.  This is what the menu here is all about.\n\nI guess one could complain that the menu lacked variety, as the underlying burnt ember smoke flavor sort of permeates all of the dishes, but that's the whole point, it's the thesis of the menu so to speak.  I didn't really mind since it helps to create some truly unique and interesting combinations that pull flavor nuances that I didn't even know existed from the ingredients.  I suppose one could argue that the menu could use more theatricality, at least to suit its flavorful ambitions; only the sea urchin dish really took the grandiosity to the next level.\n\nAnother gripe could be that the meal lacked any substantial meat course (e.g., a red meat), which would have been expected given the hefty price tag (there was, however, a pigeon course, further representing San Francisco).  But I suppose a red meat would have been irrelevant to the ember-toasted coastal waters theme of the menu.\n\nThe service here is fine, and the staff is friendly, contrary to some of the reviews I've read detailing supposed condescension.  The service itself wasn't as theatrical, orchestrated, luxurious, or all-around coordination-impressive as say, Eleven Madison Park, but it got the job done.  In addition, we had a 9PM seating and the service was quite rushed, perhaps not allowing the time to bask in the aftertaste of each course or to feel any sort of sense of fine dining luxury, but at least I was able to make the last BART train.\n\nAlthough they go for $18, the cocktails here were inventive, full of depth, and delicious.\n\nAll in all, dinner at Saison fully encapsulates the essence and flavor of Northern California unlike anywhere else.", "author": "Mike L."}

He definitely brought it. I believe I had a number 7. \n\nThen we were seated at our table.

There was also one of the captains, I forgot her name but she was absolutely fabulous! The way she poured that broth on my mushroom...MMmMmmmm!! Get it girl! \n\nWhy don't they list any of the females???\n\nRegardless, Patrick and his team took care of us very well and sat us in a perfect position for the entire cooking. The seating was comfy with random furs to pet while you're eating your caviar. I was definitely the loud brown girl in the corner having a good ole' time. I mean, can you blame me? With the delicious food making me high and the wine pairings...whhoooo....I was in a very happy place. I couldn't contain myself anymore...\n\nThen again, I don't think you have to be that serious when eating great food and drinking fabulous wine...am I right? \n\nI can't wait to come back...I mean who needs to pay SF rent...that's so overrated....", "author": "Leena B."}

So as it turns out, the extraordinary reputation Saison has garnered that I was obviously challenging in my initial review couldn't be any more true. They really are as top-notch as it gets. \n\nMy initial review had nothing to do with the food, which was outstanding, of course. It was all about the off-putting sense that Saison had lost sight of the customer and the full experience that makes a great meal really great. Well, to my tremendous surprise, they proved me wrong. \n\nOn their own, Saison tracked me down. I never contacted the restaurant with my disappointment so this was completely unexpected. In my email inbox was the kindest email from General Manager, Patrick Ellis. He acknowledged my disappointment and the issues I raised in the most sincere way and somehow even found a way to thank me for voicing my concerns. He also extended an incredibly generous offer to have us back in order to experience the meal and their new space in the way we had originally hoped, which is no small offer. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, my little unhappy Yelp review was not going to undo Saison and honestly wouldn't have even made a dent. So for them to take the time and effort to seek me out and make the situation right by one small customer really says a lot. I have to eat my words and say that what they're doing does matter to them in the fullest sense and that despite the accolades, they do in fact still see and care about each and every customer. \n\nAfter reading my review and update of this restaurant, the one and only thing that should be taken away is that Saison is the real deal, truly.", "author": "Amy K."}

I have been blessed to have been able to experience quite a few spectacular restaurants, but Saison was phenomenal.  The menu ranged from 15 to 18 courses and each dish was a piece of heaven.  Just the right amount of balance between texture and flavors.  Each dish is prepared with fresh ingredients from their garden as well their farm.  Although each course had its uniqueness, the Beets were my favorite. The aging of 3 days added such wonderful texture that allowed it to taste as though I was having a delicious piece of well prepared steak.  The atmosphere was fun and the staff offered impeccable service.  I would suggest you do experience this restaurant with an individual who would appreciate and enjoy the finer dining and that you would not sharing a four hour dinner with.

Evidently, the somewhat incongruous musical selections are that of his sister's generation, and my own, and I smiled numerous times throughout the meal as everything from Genesis to Seals and Crofts serenaded in the background. He did it for himself, not for you. Good.\n\nMy personal experience here was so overwhelmingly unique, completely thoughtful and gratifyingly personal in the world of fine dining, the level of customer service I received astounded me. Whether I (or anyone else) like it or not, it is inbred in me to appraise, like an invisible radar, where everything comes under scrutiny and judgment, as only then, can it be improved. No improvement needed at Saison, but I had their back, just in case.  ; )\n\nWhen asked what sort of gift would please me for my birthday, I did not hesitate. Although when I arrived more than 18 years ago, I made a sport of finding, invading and conquering the highest caliber restaurants in the Bay Area (Chez TJ's was on the list, a foretelling), in the last decade I've done much less of this, due to changes in the size of my wallet and the size of my thighs. However, I'd recently read a miraculous review detailing every savory bite a reporter had enjoyed there, and although I initially scoffed at the associated moniker of \"most expensive restaurant in San Francisco,\" as that adds no intrinsic value for me, the details were simply too enticing to pass up.  And they are. \n\nSome of the hundreds of details include: more caviar than I've ever had in a single sitting surrounded by crystal clear delicious bliss that paired the smoky supremacy of bacon, with the metal tang of fish, was drop dead extraordinary. A beet, that tastes like meat. For every salad with goat cheese I've ever enjoyed, beets were meant to be with meat and make a far more perfect companion. Beautifully arranged flowers atop two whittled stalks of delectable asparagus, and sea weed, a gorgeous collective, tiny vines and berries in a fat, white dish, so beautiful, you almost wanted to just stare. But it's Willy Wonka here--you eye your next challenge (I had 18 courses), hear the particulars and with the scrutiny of a surgeon, appreciate the colors and aromas completely and then, you pick up the butter cup and take a bite, because you can, it's all edible. \n\nThe wait staff, while emanating the distilled combination of clout and decorousness, are ultra friendly, super knowledgeable and so service oriented, I truly felt as though I had been served. As in, I snap my fingers and you thus come hither. Wench. Or swain. You just feel so special. They come from all corners, a subtle roving silent army, with no \"Hi, I'll be your server tonight.\" Everyone, including the chefs, the sous chefs, might be your server. It's titillating. It's surprising; it's what makes it an event. \n\nFood probably shouldn't be considered entertainment, necessarily, but when one enjoys it as much as I do, it is. If you are out to amuse your taste buds whereby they are doing a victory dance with every delectable bite, and can have diligently saved for the event (or are lucky enough to merely possess this without blinking), such that there is no stinger in the price tag (and I don't want to hear a word of whining about having to pay such a gratuity), to pay for the reality you've not only been supremely entertained, also waited on hand and foot in the vein of royalty, and eaten the most glorious combinations of food ever devised, Saison is the epicenter of all culinary entertainment and worth every dime.", "author": "Megan H."}

I hope many months from now that the positive reviews that are to come mean that you've got your stuff together.\n\n__________________________\n\n\nOkay, first thoughts...  I've read that the food is amazing and absolutely worth the price.  Visiting Saison has always been on my culinary to do list.\n\nSadly, that won't be happening now... not for a while a while anyway...  \n\nAfter hearing that Saison had reopened, I tried to visit the website to purchase a couple of tickets to dinner and take a look at what the tasting menu would look like.   The website (saisonsf.com) was unavailable or down so I thought I would check back in a few hours.  A few hours later, still no luck so I thought I would call the restaurant and ask them when they thought the website would be back up and running.  When I called and told the person who answered that I was inquiring about reservations, I was told that reservations are only done online and to visit the website for instructions..  THEN PROMPTLY HUNG UP ON ME AFTER HE WAS DONE TALKING.  I tried to call back a couple of times but there was no answer so I can only assume that it was either very busy, or they were screening my call.  Whatever it was, COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE if you are trying to aspire to 3 michelin stars. \n\nAm I overreacting?  From what I've read, the food at Saison is helping to keep California on the culinary map, so NO, I'M NOT OVERREACTING.  Cyrus closed a few months ago, Masa's is closing right after valentine's day.  I'd hate to see Saison close before it gets a chance to get started.  I'm sure the food is no doubt, amazing.  But I'm not ordering take-out.  This isn't Mission Chinese food.

Around $500 / person including wine pairing)\nDining room: We sat right in front of the kitchen and saw all the action. Pretty awesome.\n\nTip: Go to the restroom right after you finish a course but before they take away the empty plate. And get back to your table within a minute or two. \n\nWill I go back again? YES! Because the food was absolutely amazing. The best fine dining food in the bay area in my opinion.\n\n\nNow, the story:\n\nThe food we had was absolutely amazing. Josh, the executive chef of Saison is really talented and can put together unexpected combinations of food that just blow your mind. \n\nPretty much every single course we had was really really good, and that rarely happens to me nowadays. (I just went to French Laundry two weeks ago for their secret extended menu and was utterly disappointed.) \n\nJosh's food is heavily influenced by Japanese cooking. He uses lots of ingredients from Japanese cuisine, such as uni, dashi, daikon, shiso, seaweed, etc. Yet, he always adds his own twist to it and make it entirely different. I won't go into each dish that I had since he changes his menu and it is unlikely that you'll get what I had last week. \n\nAbout the service: I thought everyone was really nice and accommodating. The reason why I gave it a four star was related to the restroom tip.\n\nThe restroom tip has a long story behind it, so if you are interested, let me know. I'll email you. Out of courtesy to Saison's staff, I don't want to post the details on Yelp. Let's just say that to make sure you have a full dining experience, follow my tip when you need to use the bathroom.\n\n\nI will definitely go back again for the food. I've been to all Michelin star restaurants in the city and most of them in the bay area. Saison is absolutely the best.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-18", "description": "I'll keep my review concisely focused on our experience, as the food is consistent and highlighted extensively in other reviews. For background, we had the discovery menu for two a few weeks prior to this review.\n\nA few things:\n\n- The kitchen connects with the main dining area, which is great in the sense that you get to observe everything happening in front of you. And surprisingly, the kitchen is extremely quiet and although we were seated only 10-15 feet from the stoves, we hardly heard anything at all (whether it's the chatter of the cooking or the talking of the staff). The down side of this is that there is a possibility that you'll be seated next to the freezers and refrigerators used by the kitchen staff throughout the night, like we were. For a now-three Michelin starred restaurant, you would expect a very pleasant dining experience (think TFL and MW, which we could not help but compare our Saison experience to). However, getting blasted by 4 or 36 degrees Fahrenheit air regularly throughout the night made for a rather unpleasant dining experience, even if you were wearing a blazer and long sleeve shirt like I was. If you visit, you'll probably want to explicitly ask for a table away from the refrigerators/freezers. \n\n- The service was incredibly inconsistent. This issue is consistent with other reviews that I've read. Because there are so many dishes, you're served by an army of staff, most of the times by someone who you only see once throughout the meal. Because of this, the depth of the dish's introduction varies greatly depending on who you have explaining your meal. Sometimes you'll get one line about the dish (usually to the extent that we can already identify ourselves just by looking at it), or other times you'll get a thorough history and some novel facts about it, which we would expect and appreciate for this level of restaurant. (To which The French Laundry and Meadowood, which Saison is now considered a peer to, are consistently fantastic at). \n\n- On top of the service's inconsistency, the pacing of the dishes was also very inconsistent. Sometimes we had dishes served immediately upon finishing the one prior. Other times, we had to wait a rather long time (at one point one server quipped that they hadn't forgotten about us; I guess he could tell that we certainly felt that way). \n\n- Throughout the meal, at the corner of my eye, I could often see the waitstaff hovering nearby to quickly pick up the plate as soon as I've set my spoon down. At times, this pressure made us feel quite rushed to finish the course, but then of course it became a matter of \"hurry up and wait\".\n\nOverall, for the price of the meal, we were expecting to be thoroughly impressed compared to its other three Michelin starred peers. While the dishes were very, very good (innovative, incredibly impressive ingredients, artfully crafted, with very delicate flavors; highlights were the uni, the abalone, and the foie mousse savory/sweet concotion), Saison's other faults coupled with the high cost (one of, if not, the most expensive tasting menus in the bay area) overshadow the food. At this level, the restaurant should be judged not just for the food itself, but rather on the experience (including ambiance and service) as a whole. And as a whole, Saison failed to deliver in our experience. Suffice it to say, Saison was worth a try, but we won't be returning as there are a plethora of other comparable, more pleasant dining experiences in the bay area.", "author": "James T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-18", "description": "Short version: Worth the price and absolutely consistent with a 3-star Michelin restaurant! \n\nSaison was an amazing experience!  My wife and I came here for our 10-year anniversary, and the staff clearly went out of their way to make it an absolutely wonderful evening.  Each course was thoughtful and executed to perfection.  It was obvious that the chef and the staff cared greatly about what they do, and wanted to make it an unforgettable dining experience.  In particular, the maitre d', Michael, was outstanding and repeatedly went out of his way to optimize our night. \n\nAs others have mentioned, this restaurant is expensive: ~$400 per person without drinks.  Because of this, we chose to get 2 moderately priced half bottles of wine -- the sommelier was not in the slightest bit judgmental about this, but rather complemented our choice.  The Sancerre and Champagne we chose were superb and nicely complimented our courses.  Later in the meal, we were given a complimentary splash of red wine that they thought would pair well with one particular course, simply to enhance our enjoyment of it.  \n\nAlso, in honor of our 10-year anniversary, Saison provided an extra course as well as an additional small desert. Even without these kind gestures, it would have been a 5-star meal, but this generosity did crystalize this as one of the best meals of our lives.\n\nWhile I understand that some people may be frustrated by the cost of the meal, I suggest accepting that before you start your meal so that it doesn't detract from your enjoyment of an amazing meal. Don't get me wrong, I don't think this (or any) restaurant is above reproach, and it's reasonable to question the bang-for-the-buck after the meal. I'm simply saying that you risk self-sabotage if you are constantly thinking about the high price during an otherwise extraordinary dinner. (Just my two cents.)\n\nLastly, for what it's worth, my wife and I have gone to a handful of 3-star Michelin restaurants in Chicago and NYC, and only Alinea was better in our opinion. We will be back, and we also look forward to checking out the a la carte options at the bar.\n\nPS: The 'horchata cocktail' certainly has an impressive back story and pairs well with the desert we had.", "author": "Dustin J."}

Arrived promptly at 6pm for our birthday celebration. we were seated immediately and offered krug to start ( love that)\nThe restaurant itself is spare and mostly unadorned. A high brick wall space with an open kitchen leaves the show to most diners. My back was too the kitchen but the other 3 had a full display. The wine list is extensive and seriously marked up. Stratospheric. Wines that I have in my own cellar that I bought for 70-80 dollars are anywhere from 450-750 a bottle. WOW.\nThe staff were all universally friendly and knowledgeable and make for a lovely experience from a service perspective\nThe biggest issue other than the huge mark up was that the restaurant was freezing. I mean seriously cold. maybe 64 degrees at best. We mentioned it several times. The amount of air flow from the vent system to the open kitchen actually had a wind chill factor. Every woman in the restaurant was in full coat and staff provided shawl. I was in wool jacket and pants and my hands were numb.\nOn the way out Patrick Ellis the GM apologized for the cold and said they were having an issue. I wish they had told us up front as it just seemed like they did not care that we were all freezing. For 3400 dollars and three stars ambience is a guest that needs to be catered to equally with the food. Saison fails in that regard at least last night.\n\nThe food. I mean really thats the star.\nWe had the full monty.\nEach dish was exquisitely presented.\nThis is a restaurant of subtle flavors. Truly delicious almost all seafood or vegetables\nwith just one small piece of duck towards the end. Each dish had something truly nuanced for me. Caviar with the slightest glaze of pig fat was transformative. Sounded odd tasted like heaven. Subtle bits of smoke in ingredients was a haunting thread that weaved in and out of courses. It was like that for everything. Pretty plates brought by pretty people with subtle ethereal nuanced flavors.\nAt the end I was happy but not wowed. My palate had been exposed to a graceful ballet of flavors textures and suggestions. I was left looking for a little bigger flavor profile as the night went on or a larger crescendo.\n\nAll in all lovely, Very overpriced. Very cold. Not a do over for me. I would rather eat twice at meadowood for the same money and be blown away and trying to find another date to return.\nSad to have to say that. Glad I went, I learned things and had my palate extended in unexpected ways but for the price there are many many alternatives that I think put the full dining experience especially diner comfort more in what I want from a \"big event\"", "author": "Paul G."}

Moreover, there was so much commonality amongst the dishes that if you didn't like a certain ingredient, you'd be disappointed for large swathes of the meal. 3-4 dishes had the same seaweed gel... hope you like seaweed!\n\nThe dishes really just weren't memorable. I can still tell you today what I ate at WD-50 or Momfuku Ko, the only dishes I really liked at Saison were the lobster and the duck.\n\nThe wine pairing at $300 was a big rip-off. Mostly sweet white wines, with a beer and 2 sakes. Only one white cab that had age, nothing that blew me away. Sake and beer to me just don't have the same complexity of a fine wine. Again, nothing bad, but nothing near worth the $300! I wish I'd just brought a nice Pefu Merlot.\n\nThe highlights are that the space was great.\n\nService was pretty good. Our main waiters & the chefs were awesome, had some fun conversations and you could tell really loved the food. The bartender was kind of surly and made a bad first impression.", "author": "Alexander K."}

In the bay area, I've done the whole gauntlet at FL and Benu.\n\nFirst, let's be real: tasting menus are debauched and disgusting and vulgar and gluttonous and historians will marvel at the decadence of a society that can put together 20 courses of anything. Saison's reads like a menu from one of Caligula's lesser orgies.\n\nNow, that said, here is what distinguishes Saison from its compatriots in sin:\n\n1) The atmosphere.  Definitely the best design / atmosphere.  Not stuffy at all, feels like you could walk in on a weekday and just sit down.  That said, it is also stylish and sophisticated - exposed brick walls, poured concrete floors, elegant fresh flowers, open, mod kitchen.\n\n2) The bar.  You actually CAN just walk into the bar, and the drinks they poured were certainly some of the most innovative I've had.  I would definitely come in here to kick it after work.\n\n3) The food - better than FL which is old-school and resting on its laurels.  More comparable to Benu, though I thought Saison just did a better job executing on dishes.\n\n4) Service.  The reason Saison won't get 3 stars - it is too casual for the snobs at Michelin.  Don't get me wrong, it was altogether good and timing was fine, but it is not the almost-overbearingly-attentive-swiss-watch precision of french laundry.  If FL service is a Rolex, Saison's is a Nixon.  Benu is somewhere in between.\n\nThe wine pairings were great.  The take home brioche was maybe the best brioche I've had.\n\nTo sum, this is an excellent place in which to be high. With Food, Wine, and a 20% Tip, the bill is like $520 per person.", "author": "Anthony L."}

As far as comparisons, it is more like Chicago's \"Alinea\" than our own \"French Laundry\", that is, inventive rather than classical. \"Alinea\" is perhaps a little bit more wildly inspired and intense - say fauvism vs impressionism, but \"Saison's\" inventiveness works as well - duck liver mousse with a beer broth! Yet even simpler dishes, like smoked trout, truly shine - and as is well known, mastery in basics is even more difficult. It is also enjoyable to see the chefs working in the kitchen, especially when they gather in groups and start putting something together - \"Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn, and cauldron bubble\".

Now don't get me wrong, the food and experience was good, but it did not meet my expectations given the cost. While I'm sure the dishes were all exquisite, some were hit or miss for my particular palate preferences, and my wife felt the same way. My least favorite was the uni on toast. It was my first time eating sea urchin, and it just wasn't really my thing. I wasn't a big fan of the raw lobster either (for the record, I do enjoy sashimi, so it's not just a raw seafood thing). That said, the dishes were prepared very well, and if you enjoy these things, then this might be the restaurant for you. I really enjoyed the caviar pudding, which was served with a delicious biscuit rushed with pork fat. My favorite course by far was the dessert. The tiny forest strawberries with cream were amazing and flavorful, and they also had a super cute orange sherbet served inside an orange that was perfectly creamy and delicious.\n\nAs for the wait staff, they were fabulous and definitely improved on the whole experience -- they were attentive, funny, and did a good job explaining the dishes and answering our questions.\n\nIf you're adventurous, try this restaurant; I'm glad we tried it, though I don't think we'll be back because I don't think it was worth the money based on the amount of enjoyment we got.

I have been to them all: Coi, Benu, French Laundry, Per Se  etc...  I live close and have been walking by, watching the progress and anticipating Saison's opening. Last week, my wait was over.  The interior design is comforting with warm tones. I love that they are not pretentious in their presentation. The kitchen is in the dining area and open, which is amazing to watch the process as it goes on in preparing the food.  There is a large communal table which is fine as long as you don't have two relatively loud and squeeky girls sitting next to you ( my only complaint in this review)... \n\nThe food is amazing. There are 18-20 courses but each course is a bite or two so you get the pleasure of experiencing each flavor without the pain of overindulgence.   Not only is each course a mouthful of amazingment but their presentation and dishes in which they serve each course is a visual joy. The sommelier does a fantastic job of pairing wines with the courses and even includes a beer on one course.  \n\nThe wait staff is varied and highly attentive. They will even share additional tidbits if you are a curious sort ( I am). \n\nMy only suggestions would be that I like a menu that tells me what I am eating so I can reference it...I also take pictures to show everyone on FB what I ate and I can't always remember, especially after 18 courses. \n\nThe price is up there with French Laundry but worth it... a definate dining experience in all aspects. \n\nOh, and it was a blast eating the hand picked salad fixings by hand.... (required)  This added to the comfortable and casual environment. I personally don't need to feel like I have something to prove with snobbery in a fancy restaurant. I loved that   I was casually comfortable during dinner, listening to Fleetwood Mac,  while I ate the most amazing food.

This is an experience of unbelievably complex flavors, textures and experiments. The service is also amazing. The wait staff noticed immediately that my fianc\u00e9 is left handed and began setting his utensils on the left side. Each meal comes out in a unique serving dish and with different utensils, all of which add to the experience. The wine pairing, though pricey, is highly recommended. The wines all enhanced the flavors of the meal. Among my favorite items were sea urchin on top of what they called \"liquid toast\", caviar, and just about all of the seafood items. There was also an incredible liver toffee with white chocolate and beer on top which was stunning. Some of the flavors towards the end of the meal were a little too smokey for my taste, and I would say that overall, the menu was geared towards a salty palate, but everything was truly unique, unusual, and highly impressive. I enjoyed the 80's music soundtrack throughout the evening. I also should note what a well-oiled machine this place is overall.

The other dishes were predominantly raw fish. No beef, lamb, or pork dishes were served. One serving consistent of a duck based broth. No bread was served during the meal, which seemed very odd. We were not offered coffee, tea, or a dinner drink to finish the meal. Desserts were very simple and not very creative. Two ice cream dishes and one with just fresh berries, again not the creativity you would expect in a 3 star restaurant.

The food, there is no doubt that this restaurant takes serious pride in their menu, but come on. What stuck out the most, a delicious vegetable dish. Might be one of the best things I ate the whole year. So there is a star for that. What else stuck? The tougher than nails beef that was plated in a deep bowl and was very hard to eat. Had a hard time getting my hands in there to cut it. Good thing it was only two small bites worth. Yeah, I know, no big deal, but after spending almost $800 on dinner for two I except things to be amazing. This service, it was fine. The wine? Sweet pairings, half made sense, the other half seemed like the place was trying to show off with esoteric wines or hard to get sommelier chest puffers. I know every ones tastes are different, and this one didn't really work for me. Hopefully it did for others that night. I was never planning on writing this review.

If you want to be rude, just say your name.  I also read about the whole Chubby Noodle vs Fat Noodle lawsuit going on. I have no vested interests in any part of these two restaurants, but reading Saison's rebuttal made me sick. What a bunch of arrogant, full of themselves jerks. Maybe they feel that they can be with all of their Michelin stars. We all know that it takes years of hard work to get even one. There are people who take the accolades with great poise and pride, like Thomas Keller or Michael Tusk. The Saison group would rather shove them in your face and make you pay for the abuse.

To our complete suprise we found a dining establishment with TWO MICHELIN stars right in the middle of our own neighborhood!!  Being the foodies that we are we decided to celebrate our next anniversary at Saison. \n\nWe had dinner here on Saturday night, 7/26/14 and ordered the 20 course exploratory menu for around $400 per person.  We decided against the wine pairing because it just seemed like way too much alcohol and instead had the sommelier pick out a very nice chablis that was fantastic and really well priced at around $90.  \n\nThe food and the experience really can not be described.  The intimate setting with just eight tables of diners surrounding that beautiful kitchen with its wood fire gently but intently kissing the proteins, bones, beets and veggies (really anything.. ) and the delicate precision of it's chefs as they assembled and presented our meal.   Quite literally a symphony for the eyes, nose and mouth.  starting gently with that fragrant tea, like walking (and sipping) a meadow.  Sublime.  Then the texture and taste explosion of the trout roe really set the stage for a fantastic night!  In fact all of the dishes mixed beatifully textures, temperatures, flavors, odors, colors, etc...   mmm  But for us the the climax dishes were the uni toast (OMG, i could have died after that) and one that I forget the ingrdients other than I think it had a milk or whey base but if I close my eyes I can imaging it again in my mouth.   hmmmm!! \n\nSo, I titled the review the \"parade of spoons\" because in addition to the THREE MICHELIN STAR (hopefully next year!!) quality service and food there was a different spoon for almost all of the 20 different courses and many of them just as beautiful as the food itself!  All seemed to be designed specifically for the food and its particular vessel.  And the fun we had with the staff as they presented each new spoon!!  \n\nI guess the only negative thing I could say is that after we made such a big deal on how impressed we were their hundreds (waiter confirmed...) of spoons and that my partner even joked about taking one home as a souvenir, the least they could have done was suprise us with a spoon to take home.   We did just give them almost $1300.00 for dinner with tip so just sayin.....    could have thrown us a spoon!\n\nFood was to die for but come with an open wallet as it is not cheap.

Too many fishy, strange courses (chewy abalone, I'm looking at you!).  No dish that blew us away.  No \"anchor\" dish (e.g. a nice steak or red-meat dish) to let us know where we were in the procession of the meal.  When the dessert courses started to arrive, we all asked, \"That was it?\".\n\nSaison is not worth upwards of $400/person.  Service is very good, and the food is presentation is great.  But overall, I was not impressed with the creativity or overall agreeableness of the courses.  One thing that struck me in our meal was how ocean-centric the meal was.  This would be fine, except that none of the dishes were particularly amazing, and some were downright bad.  The three best dishes of the night were: goose liver mousse, live scallop, bread.

Then do the wine pairing since they know best which wines will enhance their food.\n\nIf they have a special add-on that night, just say yes.  I went in February this year and their special was a dish with a generous helping of shaved black truffle.  I will not even try to describe the courses as I might not give justice to them.\n\nThey have an open kitchen so its interesting to watch the chefs as they prepare your courses and you will see how meticulous they are with the food.\n\nWe were a bit late but they patiently waited for us.  They just had to move us to the saloon by the bar for our dessert courses which was fine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-11-13", "description": "Factory Dining\n\nThere is a saying among service academics--in manufacturing, quality is measured by the degree to which everything is exactly the same, while in service, quality is measured based on the degree to which everything is different for every customer.  There is never any question about what is important at Saison.  Everything is based on driving out variance (i.e., individuality and customer needs) and making the whole process as uniform as possible, for maximum operational efficiency.  The customer is just a part moving down the assembly line.  The customer can make no variation in the menu (it is emphasized in pre-meal communications), and if any course is missed, too bad (also emphasized ahead of time by the restaurant).  The pace of the assembly line must be maintained.  Chop chop!  We had a 5:30 reservation, and the pace of courses was relentless.  Don't fall behind!  The table must be clear by 8:00 apparently.  No lingering over coffee here!  At one point we ordered a bottle of wine, and the pace of courses was so rapid that it was several courses before the wine appeared.  The price of the meal was set ahead of time (emphasized in the restaurant's communications), as was the 20% mandatory gratuity (whether service was good or not).  No variance is permitted at Saison--very efficient.\n\nMy wife and I were seated next to the refrigerators and freezers, from which restaurant workers were extracting food to be prepared, with my left ear aimed down a corridor in which some sort of loud restaurant operations were occurring.  I had trouble understanding what my wife was saying, most of the meal.  The server mentioned that a wine pairing was available, and my wife said that sounded nice.  The wine pairing option was not listed on the wine list, and price was never mentioned by the server or listed anywhere.  It turns out that the wine pairings were $248 per person, for the equivalent of about 2  1/2 glasses of wine, according to the server.  Even a non-mathematician can quickly calculate that that comes out to almost $100 per glass.  I had to ask the server for the price of the wine pairings (appearing cheap to my wife), and then had to explain to my wife that the wine pairing that she thought sounded fun was actually an extreme ripoff (again looking like a cheapskate to my wife).  I am sorry, but I am not a Silicon Valley zillionaire, and $100 glasses of wine are not tolerable to me!  \"If you can't afford the restaurant, don't go,\" she said to me, after not speaking to me all night.  Needless to say, our entire evening was ruined.  I have been to many Michelin 3-star restaurants around the world, but this is the first at which I felt I had to be one of the one-tenth of one percent to have a good experience.  If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it, is the clear message, (even though the amount I spent at Saison as a \"cheapskate\" was more than what I spent at Epicure, my favorite Michelin 3-star restaurant in Paris).\n\nIn all fairness, the precious little dishes were cooked with great subtlety and sophistication, although no one course was individually impressive.  My wife and I went to the hotel bar after dinner and had a bar snack that even my wife admitted was far more satisfying than what we experienced at Saison.", "author": "Roland R."}

Overall, everything that changed I think changed for the better, and everything that didn't change didn't change for a reason.\n\nThe goods:\n\n- I was instantly impressed by the ambiance and the decor - as soon as you walk in, you're whirled into this rustic, darkish, yet very stylish decor.  There is a bar (of about 6~8 seats) where folks can enjoy cocktails (beer, wine, and selected cocktails) and to the left is the completely open kitchen and the dining tables that are sporadically located throughout (about 10 or so tables if I am not mistaken).\n- The kitchen itself looked amazing - it's impeccably clean to begin with and contains all the gadgets, equipment, and apparatus that you can ever have in a culinary world, including an open fire oven.  There is a separate dessert kitchen which is absolutely fascinating too.  The fact that you can watch the chefs whip up your dishes right then and there is worth paying the price.\n- The meal was flawlessly presented and was flowing very nicely.  The intervals between one dish to another is carefully thought through and was perfect (I'd say one of the best) - which is a very important part of the meal in my opinion\n- The dishes were very good. Some of the highlights of the meal:\n   - Vegetable bowl with anchovies and a coin of lardo gelee on the bottom (simply done and simply the most flavorful out of all dishes)\n   - White asparagus, uni, and bianchetti truffles \n   - Toffee of duck liver, white chocolate, milk bread (the most delicious duck liver dish I tasted)\n   - Sesame souffle with black sesame gelato\n- Wine pairing was inventive, and expansive when it came to going to old and new worlds\n\nThe not-so-goods:\n- I wish I could express how inexpensive the meal felt after the 5 hour feast that I had at Cyrus or Madrona Manor.  Don't get me wrong it was still $300~350 per person but I truly felt I got more than what I paid for.  I didn't quite get that here.  The meal per person came to about $500 per person before tip, which ranks the price comparable to the French Laundry and Alinea.\n- No valet parking....gah.\n- I was fine with the limited beverage selection, but I still believe the best of the best should offer everything (including liquors)...hehe.\n\nOverall a very good experience, and definitely worth the visit.  The floor and kitchen staff are very professional, courteous, and friendly as well.  I'd definitely go back when the season changes for another one-of-a-kind meal.\n-", "author": "Mike P."}

VERY GOOD AMBIANCE that could have been great if '80s soft-rock music (reminiscent of south/central Florida) had not been all that played during our 3-hour culinary experience. GREAT DECOR & DESIGN. GREAT WINE LIST & DRINK options. OUTSTANDING QUALITY & FRESHNESS of ingredients. GREAT PRESENTATION of the courses. Unfortunately, where Saison failed was on the two things which I value the most in a restaurant, especially in a 3-Michelin-starred one that charges French Laundry prices: flavor & creativity. SAISON FAILED PRETTY BADLY ON FLAVOR & CREATIVITY. Out of our 15+ courses only 3 were great and none were \"wow!\". If I compare my experience at Saison to my experiences at \"San Francisco area\" greats like Coi, Quince, Manresa, Atelier Crenn, and even Nico, AQ, State Birds Provisions, Bar Tartine, and Perbacco (all which have less Michelin stars than Saison or no stars), Saison stands at the bottom. And comparing it to French Laundry (one the best dining experiences I have ever had - where all courses except for one were \"wow!\") is not possible. \n\nI am happy for the Chef and happy for all who love Saison. I wanted to love Saison so badly. Almost all the courses' flavor profiles were smokey and vinegary (obviously something that the chef must love). There was no variety & no creativity or innovation. And I can do without creativity and innovation as long as the flavors are delicious. They were not.\n\nThe 3 great dishes were:\n\n1- The radishes prepared several different ways with clarified butter\n2- The brussels & cabbages blistered in the fire\n3- The tea & persimmon", "author": "Jorge K."}

To be honest, we both really enjoyed the ambiance at the original location better. The food is still great, although it's not as surprising after the first experience. I wish they had changed things up as a lot of time had passed between the visits. This generally means that we will be unlikely to ever go back unless we hear of a shift in the menu or style, etc.. That said, the food and the inventiveness is impeccable. The staff are fun and friendly, giving Saison a lightness that offsets the seriousness of the very-visible kitchen. Watching the kitchen is still fascinating, and the whole team is (as I recall) wonderfully diverse, which we noticed.", "author": "Lisa L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-14", "description": "I can't think of a place in the bay area better than Saison for tasting-menu dining.\n\nI'd been to the old place on Folsom several times during the last few years.  The ingredients were always of the highest quality.  Joshua's food started great and got better with every visit.  Mark's wine choices were exceptionally well chosen to compliment and enhance the food.  The  environment was comfortable and casual, and I loved the fact that there was no pretention even though it was easily serving one of the best dining experiences around.\n\nI was worried that some of the charm of the would be lost in the new location but it's not the case at all.  The new location is certainly more upscale and stylish, but I don't think any of what I liked about the old place has been lost.  It's still an extremely comfortable place to spend a few hours.  We also liked the way the seats are arranged around the kitchen and how the cooking staff are often the people bringing the food.\n\nThe food and wine as always was terrific.  I'm looking forward to visiting again in a few months and seeing what new things Joshua has come up with.", "author": "Michael E."}

For the price tag, you would think it would be stuffy but not at all. Joshua Skenes takes elegant and creative to a whole new level. His creations and culinary skillfulness definitely impressed me, which doesn't occur often. Non-foodies or people who don't cook won't appreciate the complexity of his dishes, the rarity/quality of his ingredients or the skill involved to get it just right. It's no easy feat to make food out of things that you don't normally think of as food. I can see why it is listed as one of the top 10 places in the world.", "author": "Betty V."}

The discovery menu and the wine pairings blew us away! Impeccable, attentive, yet unintrusive service is definitely something to write home about. Ask for a table opposite the kitchen: watching these masters work was like listening to a perfectly orchestrated and executed symphony! Bottom line, from stem- and tableware selections to the restrooms smelling like a flower garden, no detail in this place is overlooked! Simply perfect!  If you can bear the prices, make a point to try this fantastic food temple! Bravo, Chef Josh and team! Congrats on the very well deserved 3 Michellin stars!", "author": "Mikhail S."}

With that said, this is LOVE.   I live in Sonoma and NYC. Yes I'm bicoastal.  I went to Saison this evening.   Expectations were high.   Much like going to the Laundry or the now closed Cyrus.   Or for my east coast readers think PerSe, Daniel, Marea or Le Bernadin.   Saison in my opinion is El Bulli America.  Best meal in years.   If you love food and fine dinning, mortgage your house, sell something valuable, whatever it takes.   If your not willing to do so, your not a foodie.  Cancel your yelp and eat at a diner.   If your like me you'll want to work hard and get a standing reservation!    Watch out Kostow and Keller there's a new star on the horizon and it's called Saison!", "author": "Tom G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-14", "description": "Saison was my first time at a Michelin star rated restaurant, and it was defintiely an experience to remember (or not remember, considering the co-owner of this place, Mark Bright, continuously poured us more and more wine. Got pretty wasted). The most memorable of the dishes were the lobster bisque (to this day i still don't know exactly what the flavors hitting my taste buds were, but still agreed that it was a sensation I have never felt with food before), and the wood pigeon. There was also a caramel beer that was a perfect complement to a dessert dish. The wine paired beautifully with the food, and each and every single one of them is tasted and selected by the owner himself. I would highly recommend doing the wine pairing. Since Saison, I've been trying a ton of Michelin star rated restaurants to try to find a similar experience, but sadly, Saison has yet to be topped. On a service level, Saison was also spectacular. The chef continuously handed us free taster courses, and a 7 course meal soon became 10+ courses. The portions were perfect: after all the courses, I wasn't stuffed, and felt amazing. Last tip: take public transportation. You will get wasted.", "author": "Victor C."}

The space feels different but uniquely special and equally wonderful.  I have to say that the evening was spectacular, and faultless. Patrick Ellis and his front of house staff are superb: graceful, unobtrusive and yet tremendously welcoming and warm. The space is wonderful - from the warmth suggested by the firewood at the entrance to the somehow both tranquil and frenetic efficiency of the open kitchen. The 80s music backtrack is still there but a little more subdued - it's a grown up version of Saison. The food is spectacular. Others will give you the course by course description - the tastes were wonderful, flavorful, special without reaching to be too arcane, and just right in quantity and variety. The Asian influences seem a little more pronounced than previously, but work beautifully. The serving ware and wine pairings were unique in their fit and creative. Saison is a special place. Expensive but wonderful. As good a dining experience as one can have anywhere in the world.", "author": "roger m."}
