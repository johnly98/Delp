This sushi restaurant has been around since last year and just last night I decided to order from there because I was craving some good sushi and wanted something quick. \n\nIt was truly hard to choose what items I wanted to try since every picture on Yelp looked amazing. I decided to go with things that I'd get at any sushi place and also a popular menu item that everyone recommended. \n\nI can't even begin to describe how fresh the fish was and how HUGE of a portion each sushi roll was. I wasn't expecting it whatsoever. \n\nMy order contained the following items: \n\n- Salmon Skin Roll (CRUNCHIEST salmon skin!!! I've never tried anything better. The addition of freshly cut veggies is the perfect paiaddition to this roll) \n- Philadelphia Roll (Soft smoked salmon with cream cheese and freshly cut avocado. Melt in your mouth kind of sushi roll) \n- #4036 Roll (One word... Amazingness!! So many things inside of one sushi roll and the flavor is out of this world) \n- Agadashi Tofu (Lightly battered outside with a soft and well prepared tofu inside)- Sweet tempura sauce on the side.\n\nBonus! ---- Free Delivery & On the house California roll when ordering over a certain amount! \n\nI'm so happy that I finally tried this place out because I've been missing out.

After reading more reviews, post dinner, they have multiple posts with bugs/cockroaches/insects/hair in their food. \n\nWe came here yesterday on a cold, rainy Thursday night because the other sushi spot a few blocks away was packed and had a waiting list. That should have been our first sign since this one was relatively empty. \n\nOur order: \n1 glass of sauvignon blanc\n1 grilled whole squid\n1 bento box dinner\n1 Nabeyaki udon\n\nThe wine came first and it was served warm - how that can happen on the coldest day in SF, I do not know. When I asked our server, she replied that they didn't remember to put it in the refrigerator. Most places would have told you BEFORE they served you and offered to take the wine off the bill. Instead we had to tell her that it was undrinkable and to take it back. \n\nMy dining companion's bento box came second. It had a tiny piece of grilled mackerel that was almost burnt to ashes. The salad, which is basically lettuce and two cherry tomatoes, comes drenched in disgusting mayo dressing (also mentioned in other reviews). The miso soup was lukewarm and extremely salty. The salmon cut roll and the mixed tempura were the only decent items. \n\nWe shared the bento box since none of the other food came and finished the entire bento before anything else showed up at the table. We asked about the udon and the squid, and the server said said yes, it's coming shortly. At this point, she should informed us ahead of time or made some sort of other accommodation. When two people dine out, they expect to eat at the same time, not share one person's meal and then wait for the next person's meal. \n\nThe udon finally comes, and still no sign of the grilled whole squid. The Nabeyaki udon is basically a \"throw whatever we have into the pot.\" In any Japanese restaurant, Nabeyaki udon typically has spinach, mushrooms, fish cake, egg, and chicken. This one had: two big chunks of carrot, two big chunks of zucchini, two florets of broccoli, teriyaki chicken, tempura shrimp, and a rubbery boiled egg (they were trying to do a soft boiled egg, but you need to do this in the shell and then peel it and add it to the soup, not crack the egg into the soup and overcook the white part of the egg). It was obvious, they used the same ingredients as what they have in the tempura. \n\nWe eat the udon, and when we're almost finished with our udon, our appetizer finally comes. I would have canceled the squid when we had asked about it earlier but they said it was coming soon. This was a lie. We ate a couple of pieces of the squid, and guess what? It was like rubber! Overcooked. We left almost the entire thing on the table and refused a take home box. \n\nThank you for wasting $50. You have lost a potential returning customer.", "author": "Patricia L."}

We were really craving sushi and it was relatively close in proximity. \n\nWe ordered the following:\nSmoked sake - This was really good, but I think a bit novel considering the price.  The smoked flavor wasn't very strong, but the key to utilizing the Himalayan salt block is to leave the salmon on there for some time.  I still preferred dipping my sake in soy sauce, but to each their own.\nUnagi hand roll - The price is a bit much for this and it was a bit lackluster.  I would probably not order this again.\nSpicy scallop hand roll - This roll was packed with so much scallop and it was delicious! The scallop was sweet and creamy.  I would definitely order this again.\nR&J roll (hamachi, salmon, shrimp tempura w/ unagi sauce) - I don't typically like hamachi, but the man friend does, so we got it.  The hamachi was a little fishy, but I couldn't tell (apparently man friend is a hamachi connoisseur)? The roll itself was good with good flavor profile and textures with the sweet unagi sauce, buttery salmon and crunchy shrimp tempura!\nBento box w/ spicy tuna roll, mixed tempura and chicken katsu - I was most impressed with the presentation of the bento box.

They offer a pretty standard menu considering SF with some house specialties but been to so countless Japanese sushi bar, Izakayas, Ramen house... the offering seems erringly similar.  At first glance, the price is in the middle of the pack, but I typically avoid those discount prices because in most cases you get what you paid for.  I've been here several time mainly because I find the fishes to be decently fresh and the quality, portion size and presentation is good, in the middle to slightly upper in the Richmond District. \n\nI've ordered Sashimi (good size slices), tempura (fluffy-crispy with good varietal veggie), nigiri (good bite size, rice ratio), rolls (fair amount of fillings good rice), ramen (slighly over-flavored), beef teriyaki (decent quality of meat).  All in all the presentation are good, the place is clean, the decor is standard and roomy.  Again, for this price point, it's pretty good, close to 4* for food. \n\nThe service can be better because they seem to be a bit dis-organized each time I've been there.  Either the wait-staff is in-capable to see the needs of customer (slow to get wasabi, napkin, no soup...) or overwhelmed and understaffed (unable to attend) or Sushi Chef don't take order at sushi bar (customer leaving without order) or sushi chef pissed of and fighting with kitchen staff  etc...  It just seem the owners are young and don't possess leadership quality understanding what it means to offer HOSPITALITY, which in my opinion is an art.  With that being said, the negatives don't happen all at once, and I go back because they do try and make effort.  The reality is about a 3* for service.\n\nI really hope they can do better, they have potential to be one of the better place if they can fine-tune their operation.  They resonate with me well with the fore-mentioned positives balancing food, decor as a Japanese staple.  Service needs to improve.  Parking is poor. Perhaps it explains why they are not too busy each time I've been there.", "author": "Steven C."}

Even on a slow night we waited for over 40 minutes for a teriyaki entree and two orders of miso soup (we had to ask for it and we're given attitude). \n\nPlease take the time to train staff on being courteous, attentive, how to prioritize service tasks and follow through. \n\nMiki isn't far away if you're looking for an alternative, but they are closed on Sundays and Monday's.", "author": "Licette M."}

Decided to give it a try since it has some positive reviews.  I am glad we did coz it becomes our All-Time-Favorite sushi place now. \n\nEasy find free parking, decent environment/atmosphere. The impressive parts are the food and service they provided. \n\nWe ordered the Oyogu roll, Albacore Tataki, salmon sashimi, dragon and caterpillar roll.  From the present of the dishes, you can tell the chef had really put quite some effort on them coz they look good. The sashimi tasted fresh and the special sauce was delicious.  The chef also made some cute mini sushi for my 2-yr old son and he love it.  \n\nBeside the good food and the affordable price, what I love the most here is the service and the friendly smile of everyone.  The chef even treated us two shot of their best Japanese rice wine at the end to congrat us for our unborn baby girl.", "author": "Hong Y."}

I have NEVER walked out of a restaurant after eating one small order before. We miss Yu Zen dearly after this experience. ):\n\nDate & seating time: 9/11/16 @ 6:50pm\nPartner in crime: The boyfriend\nFood ordered: Ankimo, R&G Roll, and Assorted Sashimi\nFood received: R&G Roll\n\nWait what?\n\nService (or the lack of): The waitress serving us was utterly useless. I asked her what the difference was between the assorted sashimi & the seasonal sashimi since the menu had no description differentiating the two besides the price. She just pointed at the billboard near the sushi counter, listing out their freshest catch. That doesn't tell me what the difference is.\n\nShe tried to list out the types of cuts I will get for the seasonal sashimi, but fail to answer the question once again. It was a basic question, but she couldn't seem to understand what I was asking, so I gave up and told her I'll just go with the latter.\n\nOnly the R&G Roll was served, because 10 minutes later, the chef pops up to inform us that they ran out of Ankimo. Is there a miscommunication between the chefs and waitresses here? He asked if there was anything else we wanted, but we were not interested.\n\nAnother period of time went by, but there was no sashimi in sight. The waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything else. That question confused me, because we still didn't receive our assorted sashimi yet. Then she responded back, \"What? You ordered it?\" -facepalm- \n\nFinal Verdict:\nI'm done with this place. We grabbed the check and left to go eat at a restaurant that can take orders and had everything listed on the menu as advertised. Final food for thought, DO NOT EAT HERE.", "author": "Wency W."}

I would love to see them do well in this 'hood where we visit often. Great lunch menu and prices. Extremely reasonable dinner prices as well.  Lots to choose from. I would say the food is similar to when YuZen was run by its original owners.  And the acoustics are much better than with the last owners; not so loud. New carpeting helps. Young, friendly owner.

Each time, food and service have been consistent. And, yes, I posted one of those early reviews during their soft opening period, in the time frame where Yelpers like to claim reviews are fake or posted by \"friends of the restaurant owners.\"  \n\nWell, friends, this location is open for lunch. I can't compare it to Yu Zen. The former location was never open during that time and I was beyond excited to discover that Oyogu was!   And I don't know any of the owners/chefs, well at least not until today, when I learned that our server was the sushi sous chef.  Does that count?\n\nAs for today's experience, this place remains a hidden gem. The sashimi is consistently fresh and served at the appropriate temperature - not partially defrosted as I've had at other sushi houses in the City.  Working my way down their sushi lunch menu, all the combos are reasonably priced.  The seared albacore with a drizzle of sauce is perfect and my favorite.  For bento boxes, the salad is lightly dressed, be sure to mix well. Gyoza could use a lighter touch (possibly because I'm used to a thinner gyoza skin), but the tonkatsu is light, not oily. Bento boxes also come with a salad, miso soup, and rice.\n\nThis is also a family-friendly restaurant. Ask for mini-sushi for the kids.\n\nService is consistent.

Fish seemed fresh, but the sauce is too sweet. I feel it takes away from the overall roll since it over powers some of the other flavors. The spicy scallop roll is normally a hand roll, but our server told me I can pay an extra $2 to turn it into a roll.  That worked out well for me since this meal was family style with the people I was with during this meal.  This was my favorite roll.  The avocado was fresh, scallops were fresh...no overpowering sauce. The scallop and avocado combined had this light flavor where you can taste the two mixing.  It has creamy texture that melted in the mouth.  The sake kama was cooked well.  I've been to places where they overcook the fish and it's dry and unpleasant to eat, but this was very moist.

The rolls were reasonably priced and fresh. We even received a free California roll based on the size of our order. Although we did not dine in the restaurant, it was clean and friendly. We definitely recommend Oyogu Sushi if you are looking for fresh, reasonably priced sushi.", "author": "Marc H."}

It's my go to lunch place.  I usually order the 2-item Bento Box.  The variety of offerings is just delicious and oh so tasty!  Serving sizes are large.  I absolutely love this place!!", "author": "Natalie A."}

I personally really like nigiri and was wondering if they have a combo. Unfortunately, they only have it for lunch time and at night time they only have the sashimi combo. We asked if we can turn the sashimi combo into a nigiri combo. The waitress was nice enough to help us ask and the sushi chefs were able to accommodate with us and it was only $5 dollars extra for the nigiri. We picked the 16 pieces sashimi combo and what we noticed was that they actually gave us 2 extra pieces so we had a total of 18 pieces and they gave us 3 pieces of each fish so we were all able to try all the different fishes. That was really nice of them since we know that 16 is not divisible by 3. We also ordered two rolls and an appetizer of chicken karaage. We were super full and satisfied with our dinner. The price was reasonable too and the bill came out to be less than $100 for the 3 of us. This is definitely not my first time coming here and it won't be my last. The waitress was also super friendly.", "author": "Katie Y."}
