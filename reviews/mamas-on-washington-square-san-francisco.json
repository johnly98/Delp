It was a Sunday afternoon so of course there is a line. This would be my second time here and I remembered liking it my first time as well so I wanted to show my friends :)\n\nWhile we stood in line, there were a couple hot Pizza Spots that we wanted to try so a few of us stood in line and a few of us walked to get some pizza :P\n\nThe wait was about an hour, and basically there is no \"writing your name down then leave\", you legit just have to wait in line until you reach the door and you tell them how many people and they'll figure it out. \n\nThere is menus posted on the window so you can check out their menu while waiting in line. I was definitely craving something sweet so I knew I wanted French Toast. When we approached the door, the Host/Manager told us some popular picks from the menu in each section:\n\nFRENCH TOAST: CRANBERRY ORANGE is the favorite and the Chocolate Cinnamon is a second favorite\n\nSANDWICHES: Famous Monte Cristo\n\nBENEDICTS: NORWEGIAN Smoked Salmon\n\nOMELETTES: Northern Italian \n\nWhen you get in, you stand in another line to order the food and pay for it, then you get seated. NO CREDIT CARDS btw! So have cash or debit card ready.\n\nAs a table, we got the Monte Cristo, French Toast Sampler (comes with Cranberry Orange, Chocolate Cinnamon, and a berry one), and the Norweigian Benedict.\n\nEverything was delicious! I personally loved my French Toast - the cranberry orange was definitely a favorite and the chocolate cinnamon was my second haha\n\nYou can also get to go boxes for leftovers, tip, then leave!\nFriendly service.

The line was super short (3 parties ahead of us) and we got seated immediately after we ordered. This place only accepts debit card/ cash so don't forget to bring them! \n\nI had a pleasant experience from start to finish - their food is exceptional and the servers are attentive. I really enjoyed their monte cristo - it's like a savory french toast with ham and cheese. The jam that comes with it is soooo good too! I also enjoy their shrimp salad - it's well seasoned and the greens are super fresh!

I start to see line building up quite quickly around 7:40AM, so be sure to arrive before 7:30AM to be on the safe side. \n\nIf this is your first visit, I highly recommend you to get these two!!! \n1) Our Famous Monte Cristo: This is AMAZING. It is the one that makes me want to come back every time. It is almost like a French toast with ham, turkey slices, and heavy cheese inside. It just melts in your mouth. What I love about it is the raspberry jam that comes with it! They make their own jam and I did see people buying the jam (it is THAT GOOD!). I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!\n\n2) Northwest Omelette: Naked omelette with cream and smoked salmon! It goes well with Monte Cristo and as someone who loves salmon, this dish is a must for me! \n--------\n\nWhat I do NOT recommend: \n1) Pancakes: Large portion but nothing special and a little too blend. I saw a lot of leftovers. \n2) Dungeness Crab Benedict: it is OK, but not good for its price, $25.95. I would not order this again. \n----------\nDrink:\nLarge Grapefruit juice is my pick! I love sour taste so I get this whenever I go!\n\nWhether you are a visitor or new to the city, I recommend you to try this place out!

The wait was about a little over an hour on a Sunday at noon, and we waited about 20 more minutes to be sat and for the food to come out. You have to physically line up to order at the counter and wait at the cashier's for a table to be open before being seated.\n\nThe cashier was very nice and made an effort to make conversation with us as we paid and waited for our table. Onto the main part of our meal!\n\nTLDR;; good brunch spot, and I'm glad I tried it, but not the best I've had. The ingredients are good, but ultimately because of the wait, I probably wouldn't stop by more than once.\n\nI got the fresh crab Benedicts--the bread was soft and the eggs were perfectly poached. There's a slice of tomato and a red sauce that makes it taste almost like a pizza. They're generous with the crab meat and it didn't taste frozen. For the price point (almost $30 a plate), however, it was probably a one time thing since it wasn't mind blowing.\n\nMy friend got the Mama's Children's Favorite Omelette which was overall pretty good. The eggs were fluffy, and everything was as expected.\n\nWe also tried the chocolate cinnamon French toast. I don't know how to describe it, but it was so good!

The wait in the line was not that bad, but it is not ideal for groups bigger than two. Once you get inside you go to another line which is at the register, where you place your order. The weird part after you order you have to stand and wait for a table, which is awkward because there is really no standing room, better off waiting outside as previous.\nSo, despite my line rant, the food was delicious. I got the crab cake eggs  benedict, which was gooey and delicious. The soju bloody marys are nice and spicy too, not bad for non vodka drinks.

However, it is super heavy with a lot of cheese and heavy egg bread (about 3 slices put together per sandwich and 2 sandwiches... 6 slices total).

Better off going somewhere with no line and you can probably get same quality of breakfast food for cheaper. \n\nI'm not deliberately trying to be critical but these are the reasons for the low stars: \n- tiny space which means the limited decor/ambiance amounts to sitting shoulder to shoulder with the people hovering (a lady had a baby in a stroller and the servers had to jump over every time they went back and fourth)  \n- I saw fruit flies on the pastries \n- menu said salad was an option, but the cashier rudely said only potatoes (how hard it is to put some greens in the plate)? \n- waitresses will purposely/systematically leave their tip from previous customers on the table (as noted in another review)\n- the fruits were not super fresh or cleaned (if so famous and pricy I would think they would source organic or at least wash/pick out mushy berries)! \n\nContext: I went in on a weekday morning around 9am and there was only 3 couples ahead of me (no line outside).  I was seated in around 15 mins, and severed my order around the 25 min mark. \n\nBy 9:45am, there was a line out the door. Mama's reputation is based on the famous line so it's what they have to maintain. Someone else asked if they could get a reservation or write name list, but the waitress curtly said no. \n\nFood: average breakfast food, cheap ingredients and preparation for the price point (by CA standards -- since this is SF it's acceptable).

I arrived 10 minutes before opening on Saturday and still waited over an hour to place my order, waited forever for it to arrive, and only had ~10 minutes to eat my food before my parking expired. Interestingly enough, the two parties AFTER us got their food before us and one of them had already finished eating by the time our food came. Be warned that the two hour parking is NOT enough to wait in line and eat here. The French toast was pretty good but not exceedingly better than your average diner French toast.\n\nThe one thing that really bothered me is what I noticed the waitresses doing after each customer left. They would take the tip that was left, then replace it with a $10 bill (for two person tables) or $20 (for larger tables) and place it in between the napkins/condiments. They would let this fake tip sit there until the next party is seated, then take it while you are watching so that you're tricked into thinking the last party left a huge tip. I waited a long time for food, so I noticed them doing this many, many times. I feel like this is a dishonest way to try to get more tips- also who tips $10 for two people for breakfast?!\n\nSkip this stop on your trip to SF, there are better brunch places in the city.", "author": "Chloe Z."}

The portion is quite big and it is served together with some potatoes (which I found surprisingly perfectly cooked), and you get to try three different varieties of bread/loaf.

I feel like we got off on the wrong foot. \n\nI have been dying to come here for ages and was thrilled when I power walked from my hotel on Mission Street all the way over to Mama's early in the morning. I arrived at 7:15 expecting a line before they opened at 8am. There wasn't a soul in sight so I did some epic people watching at the park across the street. \n\nAround 7:30 the crowds started to arrive to form a line , so I strutted across the street to secure my spot. As I'm gazing over the menu ( even though I KNEW what I was getting), my eyes scrolled across the horrific sign stating NO CREDIT CARDS. I panicked and saw the line getting bigger but sprinted up the hill to the B of A to get some cash. By the time I made it back the line was about 30 people deep. \n\nIt only took another 30-45 minutes in line and I was super thrilled to finally be inside. Then it hit me... At the register there's a teeny sign that states \" NO CREDIT CARDS. DEBIT ACCEPTED OVER $15.\". I'm sorry, but what? They should seriously have that sign OUTSIDE. Sure, maybe it's just me that reads credit cards AS CARDS. But whatever, I was just happy I was no longer going to be hangry.\n\nThe weird thing is that they let people into the restaurant without there actually being tables opened. You form a line and order/pay ahead at the register and then find a seat. However, if you order and there is not a table you literally just stand there awkwardly watching people eat. I feel like this makes people uncomfortable watching them eat and I personally felt quite rushed knowing all eyes were on the tables. I think there are only 12 tables in the place. \n\nI ordered a Bloody Mary (reallllly spicy and good) and of course the Dungeness Crab with spinach Benny. It's was quite pricey. I didn't even look at the price when I ordered and my total for those 2 things was $34. The Benny had generous servings of crab, but I don't think it's worth $29. It was tasty and the potatoes were really good as well. But it's a bit steep, especially when you're feeling like you have to inhale the food so the couple standing waiting for the table doesn't drool on your table. \n\nOverall, I'm happy I came and happy I got my Benny. I probably wouldn't come often if I lived here because I don't like the rushed feeling. But it's a cool experience.", "author": "Steph G."}

Even went out of my way to make sure I had cash and arrive early enough. We still arrived 30 mins after opening for a friday morning and our wait was about an hour. Once inside the guy taking the orders put a stop to everything. No more orders were being taken for whatever reason. Not too Sure if because there wasnt enough tables or the line was really long outside but my husband and I were about to be the last ones to order right as he cut off the line for a moment. \n\nJust as that happened what looked like a tourist was taken inside by a server to order food to go. He didnt speak english very well and showed the cashier what he wanted to order via a photo. Just then he (the cashier) started laughing so hard and motioned for what i believe was the head chef to look and they both had a good old time laughing. He then said oh thats such and such order and gave the total. Then tourist then tried paying with a card to which I winced because he hadnt done his research and was then turned away because its cash or debit only and no credit card.\n\nBy this point I almost walked out with the scene that just happened. But I had waited so long and I was starving by this point and ended up ordering and my husband was very rudely mocked for ordering a side of bacon for him and I to share after his omelet already had bacon in it. My conscience has eaten at me since and I wish we hadn't eaten here.\n\nBe prepared for long wait, people staring at you while you eat, the waitors and waitresses switching out the tips so it looks like the previous customers tipped well and have cash!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-25", "description": "It annoys me when people base their reviews based on the wait -- anyone who has done even a simple lookup of Mama's knows that the wait is notoriously long, especially on the weekends. If you don't want to wait, just don't go, simple as that. \n\nThat being said, I do kind of agree that the food itself is not necessarily worth a 2-hour wait, although I have definitely waited at least an hour and a half before and felt quite happy nonetheless after filling my belly with delicious food. The way to do it is to hustle over there 15 minutes before it opens on weekdays, and God knows how early on weekends -- 30 minutes? 45? \n\nThe food is consistently good and made from quality ingredients. This is a well-established restaurant that has earned its praise and reputation. I'd shout out their homemade jam too, because that's always a nice touch. :) \n\nHOWEVER. The most recent time I went, which was a couple days ago, I was rather disappointed by my experience. We got there at 7:50 a.m., 10 minutes before opening, and sure enough a line had formed; I think we would've been maybe the fifth group in line. 8 a.m. came and went... no one came to open the door. At least 7 more minutes passed before at last Mama's opened!! I really think that's unreasonable considering the ridiculous notoriety of the lines outside Mama's -- and in general I think places need to open on the dot on time. \n\nThey also let in enough people to fill about a quarter, and then half the number of tables in the restaurant, and then it stopped for a good 15 minutes. They locked the door. Yes. They locked the door. Is that ordinary protocol?? Honestly I couldn't remember. Someone from Public Works came by and commented on how half the tables were empty, and then she first tried to go in, then knocked on the door when she realized it was locked. It took 5 minutes for someone to come to the door to talk to her, and she informed them she needed to talk to the manager since they were in danger of a citation for leaving their bins outside past opening time. \n\nObviously, the food was good as always, but as I mentioned in my earlier tip, the prices have gone up. Honestly, I'd rather that than the SF surcharge tacked on at the end as a nasty kind of surprise, but it's something to note. Nonetheless, I'm a bit upset by the service and management of the place as I experienced on a weekday. Mama's is so well-known and has been around for so long that it should be a well-oiled machine at all times. It's rather unbelievable that these things are still happening, even if they are training new people.", "author": "Julianne W."}

I knew the hype behind this place and wanted to come a half hour early before opening, but wound up getting there 15 minutes before opening and there was a long line already formed! When the doors opened, my wife and I didn't make the first cut of customers into the restaurant. I was pretty perturbed, but as it turns out unreasonably so. We only waited another 10 minutes because the restaurant requires you to order at the counter before being seated and served by their wait staff. So, the ordering process may take a bit of time before the line starts moving again. Once the tables are full, the line outside will have to wait about 30-40 minutes or so before the customer is done eating and the table is cleaned. \n\nMama's is a real small restaurant. It seems very popular with the locals for breakfast and Brunch. My wife ordered a French toast variety, and I had the shrimp Benedict. Both were good, but nothing out of this world, or anything I would crave again I actually came here for the Dungeness crab Benedict's but I was disappointed it's only served on the weekends. Ugh. They also serve, pancakes, omelets, salads, sandwiches and burgers here. \n\nOur meals were still good and the waitress, despite the amount of work put on a friendly smile.

I went on Super bowl Sunday so the line was pretty short, thank god. But on a typical Sunday/Saturday expect to wait 45min -1 hour\n\nPros: \n- Food is delicious! My friend and I shared the North Beach Benedict and french toast sampler and they were both amazing! They satisfied both my savory and sweet cravings. \n- Their Bellini was also very refreshing, I highly recommend getting a drink with your brunch. (but don't get the alcoholic lemonade/spritzer it tastes just like straight up lemonade) \n- It's such a cute little cafe/restaurant I love the ambiance and the view from the window. If you get a good seat you can see Washington square OR you're probably stuck watching the people in line. \n\nCons:\n- Don't drink too much water because using the bathroom will be difficult. It's cramped and pretty small (totally fine with a small gal like me) but there's only one bathroom and the staff usually doesn't let you wait in front of the door. So you could miss your chance to use the bathroom. \n- Our waiter was kinda rude. We still had a couple of bites left and our Bellini was still pretty full and he kept asking us if we were done..hinting to us that we should leave. I mean I get it there are long lines and people are waiting but I want some time to enjoy my food.\n\nOverall it's still a great place to grab brunch and I would go again! :)", "author": "Elisha F."}

Finally decide to try this place since I have to drop off the beau to run the north face endurance 50k.  Coordinated with a couple of friends that wanted to try this place as well.  Got to the place at 7am after dropping off the beau and there was no line yet.  So I decided to go back into the car and wait another 30 mins since it was in the 40s outside.  \n\nGot in line at 7:30am and was the first one in line.  A few minutes before 8am, a guy came out and as how many was in each party.  Doors open right at 8am and you go straight to the cashier to order.  My friends were not here at this time but luckily I read some of the previous reviews say you have to order at the counter before you get seated.  At that time, I called my friends to have them look at the menu and tell me what they want.\n\nOrdered and got seated even before my friends got there.  They got there right when the food came out...how lucky for them.. I had to wait in the cold and they came right when the food came out.\n\nItems ordered:\n\nThe Famous Monte Cristo - read so much on this that I have to give it a try.  This is our favorite out of the 3 dishes we ordered.  This sandwich came cut in 4 and is filled with flavors.  Thinking about it now is making my mouth water...... delicious! ohhh I can't forget about the jelly sauce it came with... that compliments the sandwich very well....drools...\n\nCrab Benedict  - Another item on the menu that I wanted to try since I like crab.  This dish came loaded with crab, very generous serving I would say.  Everything on this dish is delicious... another great recommendation from yelp.\n\nLast dish we ordered was the sampler of the French Toast.  As you can say..its a sampler so you get to try a little bit of everything.  It was good...but not the best I've had.  \n\nOverall, I will definitely come back here for the Monte Cristo... soooo delicious and highly recommended!  Come early as well!", "author": "Ashley L."}

We came, we waited and it kicked ass. Day after Christmas was really crowded, because many restaurants were still closed. The line wrapped up the corner and we were able to run up the street to grab a coffee from Hole In The Wall Coffee to stay focused on the mission. It would be an excellent idea for Mama's to offer coffee (or mimosas) to guests waiting outside...but again, if they're making it without the hassle - I get it.\n\nOnce we got in the door of the tiny restaurant, there is another small line and you order at the counter. The food prep line is just in view through glass and the whole place is bustling. It took some serious restraint to not order the carrot cake (regretting that decision) as it looked better than any I have seen. \n\nWe ordered the dungeness crab omelet and the original monte cristo. Both the entre\u00e9s we had were delicious. My omelet was cooked to perfection and exploding with fresh lumps of crab meat and ripe avocado. The monte cristo was beautifully plated and full of buttery goodness. Mama's potatoes were spot on, I generally won't eat potatoes  since they're filler for the most part...but these got doused in ketchup and scarfed down.\n\nAlthough the sun was shining on this little box of a restaurant and the grills were at full tilt, the temperature was just perfect inside. The bathroom is pretty well hidden and if you can avoid using it, I would advise it, but not for any other reason than having to walk through the kitchen. It was clean and perfectly fine.\n\nAfter all, Mama's was worth the wait and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good breakfast at a place with staying power.

They are hoping that you would eat really fast ( that's what I did when I was waiting). They do not accept Credit card so make sure to take Debit or Cash.

Just a 10 minute walk from our hotel, it was the perfect place to kick off a beautiful day of sight seeing.  The walk was really nice and the restaurant is right across of a park.  \n\nWe went on a weekday morning around 9:30 and only had a 30 minute wait.  They have a great system to handle the high demand of their small restaurant.  After waiting to get in, you line up inside to order your food and pay as you watch the cooks putting together all the amazing dishes.  This helps to inspire (or complicate) your dining selection!  This process allows them to turn over tables faster because you don't have to wait for your bill at the end, just finish eating and head out.\n\nThe service there was excellent!  We brought baby bear in her stroller and they stored it and retrieved it from bellow the restaurant for us.  The waitresses were very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.  \n\nWe decided to get something sweet and something savory, so we ordered the Northern Italian Omelette and the French Toast Sampler.

The restaurant is super cute and one of you can get inside to buy some freshly baked goods (cinnamon roll, crumble cakes) while the other wait in line. Service is great as well.

For years I've walked by it and the line out the door was too intimidating for me. This past weekend I felt the urge to see what the big deal was. The food was off the hook!! The service was excellent and people were super friendly. So you wait in line and someone will come out to see if you'd like a coffee or tea. It's cash only for that service. Now do yourself a favor and look at all the pics on the yelp page and start deciding what you want. I ordered the Crab Benedict with a baby spinach, it came with  potatoes. Smothered with hollandaise sauce on top of an English muffin. This was a dish I would order over and over again. I also ordered the assorted French toast. The bread is specially baked by them, there is a few choices so that's why I had to get the assort. One of the bread was a blueberry bread and the other one was a cranberry nut bread. This was fantastic. The third dish that was ordered for my table was the banana pancakes. I have never had banana pancake that was so fluffy. Banana was inside and outside of the pancake!! Delish!! Also there's little pastries that you can order, I ordered the carrot cake since I was told it was the most popular pastry and one bit with the cream cheese frosting, you'd think you'd died and gone to heaven. Look don't let the line fool you, it's worth the wait!! The restaurant has been around for a long time so they know what they're doing when it comes to breakfast.", "author": "Patrick T."}

If you was my mama, and you cooked up a meal like THAT...?! I would not be telling anyone that you were my Mama! Yep... that bad! I call this a classic edition of an \"overhyped Yelp restaurant\". Overhyped and overrated to the max! Shall I proceed?! Yes, indeed!\n\nIt aaaalllll started when I reached North Beach. I don't really frequent this part of the city too often because it's always overcrowded and packed with tons of tourists. If I was a tourist myself, I wouldn't have minded so much... but this girl right here has road rage and a bad case of impatience, so I try to avoid areas like this most of the time. I had just hiked Land's End and decided that since I was already in the city, I might as well see what the hype was about. \n\nI had bookmarked this place a while ago, but hadn't been in the area for a little while. I trekked my way through the city streets to North Beach and was actually able to find a decent parking spot. I got there right around 1:45ish and waited in line. This place is known to have a line, so I expected it. I figured that it would be worth the wait since it had a high star rating in Yelp and from friends.\n\nI had to use the restroom while I was waiting, and the owner (I think?) told me that it was behind the kitchen. This place is TINY... I know it's San Francisco, but when he said behind the kitchen, I didn't think that I'd be all up IN the kitchen with the cooks, body brushing to get by. After squeezing in between the cooks, I walked down stairs outside to a portable sized restroom. I was shocked. For such a busy and popular establishment, I couldn't believe that THIS was their bathroom! If you're claustrophobic, you might want to hold it! I'm just glad that it was clean and that there was toilet paper. \n\nI went back up and noticed that the line had gotten longer. As I waited, I struck up a conversation with a family that was visiting from the south. I overheard someone saying that Mama's was cash only. At this point, I had been waiting for a little over 20 minutes. I freaked out because I didn't have any cash. The nice family behind me held my spot while I went to a nearby ATM to get cash. But, what baffled me was that there was no clear sign that said cash only in their window. It would have been helpful to see it beforehand! I got back in line and waited for another 15 minutes until I finally made it inside. \n\nSince I was inside, I assumed that I would be getting seated. Nope... what they do is, you order at the register, and then stand there and wait until a table opens up. How awkward! I decided to order their crab cakes Benedict special and banana smoothie. They finally sat me at a table about 10 minutes later. But damn... it was the most uncomfortable feeling ever! When I looked up, I could see the people standing and waiting there just staring at me. People just waiting to see when you'd be done eating. But not just the people waiting... the cooks and servers too. I hadn't even gotten my food yet, and I already felt like I was being rushed.\n\nMy banana smoothie came first. It was decent, definitely made with fresh banana, but not work 7 dollars. My crab cake Benedict arrived next... and what a disappointment it was! First off, the portion size was SUPER small! Two small ass benedicts with maybe 6 or 7 potato slices. Um, WHAT? If I'm paying you $25 for breakfast, you better FEED ME damnit! \n\nI cut into the Benedict... and I was appalled. No runny egg yolk... at ALL! These eggs were completely overcooked! To top it off, it tasted horrible. Bland and the crab cake was just nasty! I started to wonder if they had served me bad crab. The potatoes were mushy and cold. One of the biggest lies that I've ever told occurred here on this day... when one of the cooks asked me if it was good. My heart was broken, but I did not want to break his heart after what was probably a long work day for him. I just nodded and smiled. \n\nWhat was perhaps the most disturbing element of this entire experience was how the owner/manager continued to let people in while his employees begged him to stop. They looked drained and tired and I overhead him say that he would make them serve people until there was nobody else left at the door. I understand from a business standpoint, but these people have lives and families. It lightweight sickened me, and I started rushing to get out of there because I was so uncomfortable. I also witnessed how they completely forgot to make an order for one of the family's children and then just ignored the mistake. \n\nNot sure if this was an off day, but there was just way too many bad vibes in there for me to ever consider going back at this point. 2 stars instead of 1 because of the hard working staff and the friendly owner (he was friendly to the guests at least).", "author": "Shayla B."}

I came into the city to have brunch with my friends here after reading all the glowing reviews on Yelp. What a fabulous brunch! We ordered the Monte Cristo (25% of guests order this according to the business owner), Dungeness crab omelette, and Crab cake eggs benedict. My favorite dish was the Monte Cristo- talk about the best combination of sweet and savory! I personally am not a huge fan of that taste combination but this place does  an awesome job of balancing the two. The Dungeness crab omelette was delicious and the crab was plentiful and delish. The crab cake benedict was yummy also, but did not match up to the other dishes we ordered. I highly recommend ordering the monte cristo if you ever go! We also ordered mimosas (which are pretty expensive at 8 dollars). I got the grapefruit one but it was mostly just a flute of champagne with no grapefruit in it.\n\nYes the wait is INSANE.  We waited for about 2 hours to get in for a table of 3. However, the line passes pretty quick with good company. The business owner stands at the front of the line and talks to customers which is such an awesome touch to customer service here. All the workers are chatty and will talk to you as you wait to pass the time! There is street parking available but there is a 2 hour limit except on sundays.

The inside of the restaurant gives off summer vibes since it's decked out in yellow floral which is super cute. \n\nWe ordered the French Toast Sampler, Smoked Salmon Scramble, and Silver Dollar Pancakes. I got the French Toast Sampler, which came with 4 different flavors: cranberry, orange, banana walnut, and Swedish cinnamon, all topped with bananas, strawberries, and blueberries. The french toasts were perfectly fluffy- not too soggy, not too crispy. My favorite flavor was probably the banana walnut, which tasted like banana bread, but I enjoyed all of the flavors. I love french toast and usually try it at every breakfast place I go to, and this is definitely in the top three. \n\nOverall, I'm looking forward to coming back to Mama's and trying different options on their menu!

Their system isn't wait to be seated and have a waiter take your order rather you have to wait in line to order at the cash register, get a number, then seat yourself.\n\nWe ordered their Northern Italian Omelette that had mushroom, spinach and diced pancetta and also their famed Monte Cristo, a French toast grilled cheese basically. The Monte Cristo was soft and lightly sweet with a great balance of saltiness from the melted cheese. Similar to a sweet and savory combo.\u00a0David thought it was very tasteful and delightfully cooked, it wasn't greasy or oily rather surprisingly well made that it tasted very fresh. It came with a side of jam of sorts, although I thought maple syrup would've been better. But he very much enjoyed the jam it came with.\n\nThe omelette on the other hand was fluffy and decent, the pancetta gave it a great savory kick that most meats don't, so it was definitely an interesting flavor to omelettes. The side of home fries were lacking in flavors though, soft and well cooked, but didn't taste like much.\n\nOverall, I didn't think the omelette itself was mind blowing enough and worth the almost one hour wait let alone 2-3 hour wait for some people, BUT definitely recommend the french toast dishes as THAT dish itself was very delicious and worth the wait!

I used to live close by so I would be able to roll out of bed early and stop by in line. Once I even came on a weekday before work! \n\nThey have really delicious home made jams here that you can spread on your toast on the side. I usually get some type of omelet or egg scramble and also get a pastry to go as well. Since you order before you sit you have plenty of time to look at all the delicious pastries. \n\nI recommend coming on a rainy day as the line is significantly shorter. Also I believe the line starts around 7AM on weekends. The restaurant is fairly small and can probably only fit about 20-30 guests total.", "author": "Jeanette S."}

Came on a Saturday maybe around 12:40/1 pm surprisingly the line wasn't too long and we got seated within the hour! I asked what was the most popular item and the owner said it was the monte cristo. He said that his brother makes this special jam that makes the whole dish so unique. He basically told me without the jam it would just be a regular grilled cheese ham sandwich and a waste so you HAVE TO dip the sandwich in the jam to get the whole experience of the dish. With him telling me all this  I automatically chose the monte Cristo to order! \n\nIt was my friends birthday so the whole staff actually sang happy birthday to her. It was so cute and sweet. The guy at the register asked my friend if she got easily embarrassed because she was about to be. After the song they also said they would give her a free mimosa on the house. We got seated near the window on a spacious table. They btw don't accept credit cards just debit and cash!!! The food came promotly my friend also ordered the north beach eggs Benedict that we shared. \n\nFor the food: Yes. Get the monte cristo. The jam like the owner said makes the whole dish!!!!! It was so good!! I'm in love with sweet and savory dishes and this dish hit that spot quite perfectly. I would eat the jam everyday if I could! I honestly would want to know the secret specialness that makes this jam because it's perfect. The sandwich seems like it's deep fried/ French toast and the inside is the meat and cheese. All these flavors together with the jam made the dish one of my favorite I would say for brunch! For my friends north beach eggs Benedict it was really delicious as well. One of my favorite eggs Benedict not being too salty and not too messy. \n\nFor parking: this place is near coit tower so just be prepared to park on hills! \n\nOverall: great customer service and food! Would recommend this place just be prepared to wait!", "author": "Leslie F."}

It's one of best places (if not the best place for brunch) in the city (and Bay Area in general). No reservations. Either show up super early before opening to beat the crowd or really late right before closing. We started waiting for a table for 2 at 2pm today for brunch on a Saturday and had our food on our table at about 3pm. For comparison, I've showed up closer to prime brunch time before and have had to wait closer to two hours before. Be prepared for a wait. \n\nThe brunch is unique and unparalleled quality. I also love that it's a family owned place (homemade jam, fresh picked berries and fruits from the farm). They even make fresh pancake batter every 30 minutes! \n\nAs for food, you must try the Monte Cristo sandwich. This is the most popular item on the menu and they serve about 80 of these a day out of 260 or so total orders. I also love the French toast sampler. I think the ones that are included changes each time, but today I had the cinnamon, lemon berry, and the banana nut. The cinnamon was closest to the traditional French toast, while the lemon berry and banana nut were more like the thicker baked breads turned into French toast. Smoothies are great here.

Honestly, waiting outside the restaurant for more than an hour in the sun while tired, hungry, and slightly hungover is not very fun. It was my first time here but my friends had been before and raved about it, so I kept my complaints to myself. Now, although there is a long wait, the family who owns the restaurant is super friendly and will come out and chat with the people in line, explain the menu, answer questions, etc. When you get inside, you can place your order but then, at least in our case, you may still have to wait for a table. Thankfully, the cashier (also a member of the family) chatted us up and helped pass the time. So... customer service is a huge plus! \n\nFINALLY, we got a table and relaxed to wait for our food. It came and it was AMAZING. I had an incredible French Toast that was lemony and sweet and perfectly cooked. It 99% made up for waiting.

We also ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and Cranberry Orange French Toast. I ain't a fan of fruits so the French Toast was a no go for me, though my fruit loving friends did seem to enjoy it. Very tart and every bite you take is bursting with orange hinted cranberries. The crab cake benedict had their egg perfectly poached. Got food porn written all over it and their hollandaise is yummmm. I would recommend as well though a bit pricey. \n\nAlso please note they DO NOT TAKE CREDIT CARD. Debit card okay.

This place is cash only or debit card if you order +$15, which you probably would since most dishes are around that price anyways.\n\nThe Monte Cristo's cheese, turkey and ham just melts in your mouth in between a french toast like bread.  The savory treat is balanced with a slightly sweet homemade jam that just melts in your mouth.  It's a really rich breakfast, so be prepared for some food coma afterwards.  I've tried to get the Mama's cristo, which is their variation, but they only make a limited amount.  The regular MOnte Cristo is one of their most popular dishes though. \n\nI've tried their crab and Blackstone (bacon) omelettes.  However they were just average.  Tastes good, but just average.  Maybe I'll have to come back and try their salmon (recommended by the cashier) and/or their lobster omelette as well.\n\nAnother thing I like about this place is surprisingly their special bloody mary.

I knew I wanted to try an egg dish and a french toast dish. He recommended the Benedict over the omelettes and the hollandaise sauce was one of the best I've had. For the french toast he said that the classic was the cranberry orange, the Kugelhopf was the heaviest (lots of butter) and the chocolate cinnamon was the sweetest.

He made several recommendations, but everything on the menu sounded good. I had the South of the Border omelette and also tried the cinnamon chocolate toast. Food here is homemade and very impressive! Everything was delicious!!! Their fresh squeezed OJ is also a must get. I will definitely come back here (earlier)!", "author": "Maria V."}

I honestly think it's overhyped because the food and service fell a bit flat for me. \n\nDropped in on a random weekday around 1:30 pm. Thank god there was no ridiculous line out the door at this point. However, there was still a line at the register. So at this place you basically go in, order at the counter, and then wait for a table to clear up while your food is being made. When I first walked in, no one greeted me or even told me how this set up worked. The waitress at the door began talking to the next party and I had to wave someone else down to ask how this worked since it was my first time here. She explained the process to me and I went ahead and got in line. Their menu is displayed on the wall, but you can ask for a menu card if you'd like. Getting a menu card also proved to be difficult because I had to flail around until someone saw that I needed help. Once we did order, the food took SO long to come out. And this is when the place wasn't even crowded. I'm pretty sure waited at least 35 minutes for food. \n\nVegetarian options (if you eat eggs) included omelettes, benedicts, french toast, pancakes, quiche, the california sandwich, and the quesdilla. Foodwise I had the quesadilla without sour cream because I was not feeling any of the sweet options. It came with avocado and salsa on the side both of which were good, but not really anything special. I also had a side of the roasted potatoes. So the quesadilla was good, but was it great? Nope. I know, I know. I decided to get a quesadilla and they can only be so good. But if I'm paying $11.50 for a quesadilla, I expect it to be amazing. I was most sad about the roasted potatoes. They were lukewarm, under salted, and just a bit flavorless. I love potatoes and I wanted to love these, but alas they were just sad imitations of real breakfast taters. \n\nThe confusing ordering style and service combined with the lackluster food move me to give it a 3.5/5 rating.", "author": "Lakshmi M."}

Derp.\n\nTo me, out of all the the popular brunch spots in the city, Mama's vibe is the most inviting and homely. Anyone's frown will surely turn upside down upon gazing at all the breads, fruits, and pastries on display. More importantly, the restaurant's logo has hearts on it and its name reminds me of my mom. Call it an unfair advantage. I will surely take mother dearest here next time she's having a bad day.\n\n// Crab Cake Benedict ($22.95) - 4 stars\nSince I couldn't order my Dungeness Crab Benedict, this dish was the logical fallback.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-05", "description": "Bottom Line:  High quality ingredients make the difference at this small, cozy cafe that is known to have a long wait. \n\nWhen it comes to Mama's On Washington Square in the North Beach neighborhood there are really only two things to talk about - the line/wait time and the food.  \n\nOne of my fellow Yelp Elite friends and I will sometimes express how much we like a restaurant based on how long we are willing to wait in line.  I think this strategy works well in SF since lines for breakfast seem to be common.  As far as Mama's go, I would be willing to wait 45 minutes, 60 minutes maximum.  Lucky for me, I was fortunate to be able to go to Mama's on an October Tuesday Morning.  BF and I got there at 7:45am and we were 5th and 6th in line.  The doors opened shortly after 8am and we had ordered and been seated by about 8:10am. I think it took ten minutes or so for our entrees to come out. Our brief wait was totally worth the deliciousness that followed.\n\nAt first I was disappointed to learn that there is only a partial waitress service here - diners order at the counter and seat themselves. When the food is up on the pass, a runner will deliver it to the table.  But, while waiting to place my order I got to see the ingredients Mama's was using.  Everything looked super fresh, hand picked and high quality.  Something else that looked good was the chocolate drizzle coffee cake so on an impulse I added that to my order.   Come to find out, that coffee cake was absolutely, positively delicious!  \n\nBF has been reading Yelp reviews so he knew to try the Monte Cristo sandwich, which is listed on the lunch menu but it actually served all day. Imagine slices of turkey, ham, cheddar and gruyere sandwiched between two pieces of bread that have been encased in battered egg and grilled.  Once battered, it is hard to tell where one slice of bread ends and the other begins.  The bread was slightly sweet but the inside was pure savory.  For additional sweetness, the sandwich is served with a side of jam.  I thought the bite of sandwich was good but for me there was too much going on for me to make a meal of it.\n\nAs usual, I went for a protein packed eggs benedict.  I ordered the North Beach which consisted of prosciutto and tomatoes.  It was tasty and the presentation was beautiful.  It was served with a side of breakfast tomatoes.  In general I think breakfast potatoes are just meh but I was glad to use them to sop up the yolky and hollandaise goodness from my benny.\n\nA few other notes - the d\u00e9cor here is homey and cute.  I can't decide if its Italian countryside, French countryside, rustic sheik or some other d\u00e9cor but I did like it.  Also, the restaurant is small so I don't recommend it for parties larger than four.  Finally, the wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  At the table next to me there was a mix up/miscommunication about what the lads had ordered and the waitress was super friendly and accommodating about it. \n\nI would definitely return to Mama's again on a weekday but I can't foresee myself hanging out on Stockton St. for two hours on a weekend morning.", "author": "Courtney K."}

The restaurant has been around for a while and the owner spends time visiting with folks waiting outside. He is extremely kind. I will say all of the food looks great. I tried to be adventurous and try the orange, cranberry french toast. It was not my favorite as it was made from heavy bread (similar in texture and weight to banana bread).

However, I don't remember much of the omelette or the sampler French toast I had. I was extremely content in the moment, but mamas didn't deliver a brunch-to-remember. I think it is feasible to find similar quality brunch in the city without having to wait for so long. However, if the wait isn't an issue then certainly head over to mamas.

Granted, I've only been to Mama's twice in my life, separated by 5 years, but I can tell you that I refuse to eat a Monte Cristo anywhere else. \n\nThe first time I had ever had a Monte Cristo was in 2012 at Mama's.  I wasn't sure if it was the cheese or the jam that made it so delightful, but this Monte Cristo is the only one I'll eat.  I've tried a Monte Cristo once somewhere other than Mama's and was so disappointed with it, that I vowed only to order Monte Cristo's at Mama's.  Mama's Cristo isn't greasy and what really makes it special is that jaaaaaaaam!\n\nIt is very cozy inside with limited space for large groups.

The Benedict came with slightly too much hollandaise sauce for my liking, but besides that it was made to perfection; the egg yolk was a perfect combination with the hollandaise sauce, and was topped off perfectly with the english muffin and ham. The French toast was also very enjoyable; there were three separate flavors: cinnamon, blueberry, and cranberry. \n\nOverall, this was a good experience, but one that should be reserved for occasion, it was truly a huge effort to get up early enough, and I will look back on this moment with a smile.", "author": "Peter W."}

This is a must order when you're here! (I will add that there was a little bug on our plate (see pic); I'm guessing it came from the salad that came with this dish. Luckily we saw it resting in peace on the side and was able to dodge it from going into our mouths! Take this how you want to take it...) \n\n-Norwegian Benedict: Eggs poached perfectly. This was good, nothing special... there was an overall tanginess to this dish that we didn't really enjoy. The potatoes were also a little of a let-down.  \n\n-French Toast Sampler: Meh. Nothing special. Typical french toast. Wasn't bad, wasn't great either.\n\nService was wonderful and friendly! Aside from the Monte Cristo, everything was just mediocre. (Maybe give pancakes a try?? We saw majority of the tables order it and it looked delicious!) We were planning on ordering the beef hash, but was told that they don't have it today. That was a little disappointing, taking into consideration the long and sweaty wait... haha\n\nHow strange that this restaurant is listed as a tourist attraction... fellow tourists, there are far more better brunch places in the city that are worth trying (not to mention waiting 1.5+ hours for...)!", "author": "Kris C."}

I noticed Mama's was a well known breakfast spot and I liked that it seemed really \"mom & pop\"ish so I had to try it. We went on a Sunday and they opened at 8:00 AM. If you are not there by 7:15-7:30 AM you will be waiting if you get there after 8:00 AM. We waited approximately 1 hour 20 min to be seated. It's a true mom and pop restaurant so it's smaller on the inside. At first I didn't want to wait but I'm glad we waited. They are closed on Mondays and we are leaving on Tuesday. One thing I really loved about this restaurant was that one of the owner's was greeting customers at the door and going over the menu and best options. I love when restaurants give you a more personal experience. However, I will say for a breakfast place they are a little more on the expensive side. One dish is like $13.95, a small OJ or Apple Juice is $3.95 and a large is $4.95. \n\nThe food was worth the wait. I ordered the Monte Cristo and my husband ordered the French Toast Sampler and an Omelette. They give you plenty of food. One thing I liked about the Monte Cristo was that it was Grilled like French Toast instead of deep fried so it didn't feel as heavy. The jam it was served with was amazing and made in house. The Grilled Potatoes that came with it were good as well. They could have used a tad more seasoning and/or salt but overall good. Overall a good dish. My husband's French Toast was good and his omelette was good as well. All their food was good. Really on complaints on the food. \n\nOverall, I'm glad  we got to try Mama's. The food was very good. My only things I would suggest to be concerned about is the wait time and make sure you don't mind spending $35-$50 for 2 for breakfast. Other than that give them a try.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

Yes that is crazy, but really not that much different that your average restaurant on a Friday or Saturday night. The french toast is exceptional. I have never opted for any of their other options because French toast is my go to breakfast. They use a beautiful brioche which is divine. You have a nice helping of fresh fruit and the and eggs and bacon if you want to add a little extra to your plate. \n\nI decided on the banana walnut French toast this time around and was not disappointed. It was cooked perfectly. \n\nThe staff here has this down to a science.  Because the location is so small you have to wait outside until a table clears up.

Also -- perhaps because I'm often a skeptic -- when places are built up so much by people I usually walk in with doubt from the start. Now, Mama's was pretty good. Was it worth the value and worth the wait? No. This is solidly a 3-star joint: not bad, not fantastic. It's alright. \n\nI went it on Tuesday afternoon around 1. My boyfriend and I stood in line for about 20-ish minutes which is apparently awesome given that Mama's is known for hours-long waits particularly on weekends. Once you're let inside, you pay for your food up front. There is a large menu of brunch/lunch items and beverages. Pay attention to the area near the register because there are specials and cocktails taped to the glass wall that aren't on the paper menus. While in line you'll see their various pound cakes, crumb cakes, and other goodies to entice you while you wait. \n\nThe space itself is rather small which is another reason why the waits are long. It's a charming and cozy corner spot -- very old school San Francisco. Mama's is adorned with kitsch and newspaper clippings and photos from the distant past. In terms of service: rather efficient and friendly.\n\nWe ordered the Monte Cristo. Oh, yes. It *is* delicious and probably one of the better Monte Cristos I've had. Portion-wise: it's a disappointingly small for the price tag ($12.95). The bread is beautifully eggy and rich and the homemade jam to dip the sandwich in is lovely. We also had the Pan Dore ($10.95): a sourdough baguette French toast that is also eggy and is lightly covered with a wonderfully not-too-sweet lemon butter sauce. I also had a basic iced tea with my meal. In all, from the point we stood in line to our first bite, we waited about 45 minutes which wasn't too bad. \n\nIn the end, Mama's is worth trying once. It's a San Francisco institution. We decided that we probably won't go back any time soon since we walked away with a reaction of \"meh.\" Long lines (again we went on a Tuesday afternoon which seems to be the way to go!) coupled with a higher price point for middle-of-the-road food... eh, we'll pass.", "author": "James Z."}

Finally I can cross the famous Mama's on Washington Square off my brunch list, but sadly I have to say that I don't think I'll be coming back.\n\nWhile the interior of the restaurant is very homey and makes you feel like you're eating food made with love from your mama (the restaurant name is spot on folks), the ridiculous wait times compared to the quality of food simply don't match up.\n\nI came here for Sunday brunch, which is arguably the most crowded day for brunch to begin with, but we waited in line outside of the restaurant for over an hour and a half, waited another 20 minutes in line to order and pay for the food, and then waited another half hour at our table to finally be served our food. That was a 2.5 hour wait for food, and I regretted not eating something light beforehand to endure this brunch journey.\n\nI decided to be bold and order the shockingly expensive special, the Crab Cake Benedict ($23!!) -- I waited that long, so might as well go big or go home. I don't really understand why this benedict was so expensive as all the benedicts on the regular menu were around $13-15; I suppose the cost was due to the fact that they used real crab, but even so, that is a huge price increase compared to the regular benedicts.\n\nThe Crab Cake Benedict was definitely tasty, but was it a mind-blowing, life-changing, 2.5 hour wait worthy benedict? Sadly, no. In fact, I had some issues with cutting into the English muffin portion of the benedict. Even though I was given a serrated knife, I had to put in some serious upper arm work to cut through the muffin -- luckily I work out or I would have been sore the next day from how much effort I had to put in. My friend who also ordered a benedict was also struggling to cut through his English muffin, so at least I have some peace of mind that it wasn't my (lack of) upper arm strength that failed me in trying to cut through the muffin.\n\nWhat I did enjoy about the benedict was how juicy the crab cakes were and the fact that the hollandaise sauce had a bit of spice to it which complemented the dish perfectly. I am normally not a fan of spice due to my low spice tolerance, but the spice on this sauce was a perfect amount to give something different and unexpected to an otherwise ordinary benedict.\n\nWhile Mama's on Washington has good food, the wait and service time to enjoy the food are simply not worth it. Unfortunately for Mama's, this is one famous brunch place that doesn't live up to the hype.", "author": "Pooja M."}

It definitely whetted our appetites. We waited about 30 minutes for our food and had 4 entrees between the three of us. Hey, it's the weekend; don't judge us!!\n\nWe split the French Toast Sampler. This was pretty good. The bread Mama's uses is delicious and really makes this special. Each of the varieties was good in its own way. I think I may have had better french toast at other places but being able to try different varieties in one plate pretty cool.\n\nI had the Veggie Benedict without Hollandaise and with Fruit. I know, it's weird, but I love avocado and poached eggs and really hate Hollandaise. This was okay, not too much to mess up or set this apart. The eggs were poached perfectly though! The only thing is I wish I hadn't paid up for fruit since the portion served was TINY and not worth the $2. \n\nMy friends had the Egg White Scramble and the Smoked Salmon Benedict and seemed happy with their choices. I think we all liked our food but didn't think it was worth the wait and fame Mama's has.\n\nOverall, I thought Mama's was good, if not overhyped. I would go back and maybe try their famous Monte Cristo but if you have to wait an hour+, I would keep walking as you will end up disappointed.", "author": "Carrie W."}

Almost like a diner or kitchen in a traditional american house. Very bright interior with a lot of framed pictures and decor. \n\nFOOD:\nThe food was good, but nothing mouthgasmic. We ordered 2 dishes: \n1) Classic Benedict: runny yolk. check! Canadian bacon went perfect with the muffin and egg used. Only compliant, I could taste the salt they used to poached the eggs. \n2) Monte Cristo: I enjoyed this dish better. Basically a grilled cheese french toast combo This dish is carbs overload - made of 6 pieces of bread total and potatos! In between each toast are cheese and turkey slices.

We got there around 11 AM on Sunday morning and ended up waiting about an hour until we finally got it. Keep in mind people....once you get in the restaurant, you aren't immediately seated. You have to wait in another line to place your order and then you are seated. Debit card/cash only though.\n\nI got an order of the Norwegian eggs benedict (smoked salmon) and it was off the charts good!! That egg was phenomenal. The yolk just oozing out right after I took a stab at it...it was delicious to say the least. The English muffin was properly toasted and the Hollandaise sauce was perfect. I'm salivating just thinking about it. We also got an order of the famous Monte Cristo and it was fantastic. Everything about it..the presentation, taste, jam....all went perfectly together.

In terms of the food, the french toast was great but pretty average and the homefries were delicious but a little too oily. I am not a very big fan of ham but I managed to also really enjoy the Monte Cristo, and I would definitely recommend others to order the Monte Cristo.

We both thought the food was really good, but definitely not worth the wait of 2 hours! \n\nThe main reason why the wait is so terrible is because there is no proper system of how guests are seated. There is no sign in sheet so you have to wait the entire time around the block of the restaurant in a line, AND once you're inside, you're seated at any empty table. \n\nMy friend and I noticed so many people sitting in a table for 5 or 6 with only a party of 2!

Mama's has a line starting right at 8 AM and it doesn't let up for pretty much the entire day. Arriving at 10 sticks you with about a two hour wait time--typical for all days of the week, according to the affable owner who greeted us at the front of the line. However, they do hand out water to guests in line!\n\nAfter waiting in line, you're let inside to order and pay before being seated. It's a fairly small place, but they cram in a fair amount of people! This whole segmented ordering process is to assure that your food arrives quickly once you're seated, since you probably don't want to wait any longer after waiting outside. \n\nNow, the food! I'd recommend going with an egg dish because the plates my friends ordered seemed much more worth the cost. Any of the eggs Benedict dishes are a must, as their hollandaise is super flavorful; normally hollandaise doesn't taste like anything to me, but this hollandaise is ~special~.  My other friend got one of the special omelets and everything melted together inside beautifully. \n\nI got the French toast sampler which was well worth the opportunity to check out different types of French toast, but was definitely not filling. Luckily one of my friends eats like a bird so I helped her finish her omelet. The egg was cooked very well in the toast and the cinnamon one was especially good! Their syrup also isn't overly sweet. \n\nOverall, Mama's is a bit pricey, but if you order the right plates it's totally worth the wait!

I'm just gonna tell you now, the line is worth the wait. This is where the famous line comes in, \"PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE\" !!! \n\nParking- So, parking here is ridiculous. It took us 35 minutes to find a parking spot. There is a bunch of parking meters, you just need to find an open spot! :/\n\nWait time- It's about a 30 min - 2hr wait depending on what time you get there and how many are in your party. Obviously you wanna get there before it opens, but if it's not possible, don't worry, it's not that bad! Like I said, \"Patience is a Virtue\". \n\nWhen you finally get to the front of the line, the host asks how many are in your party and then lets you in. You stand in a line to order your food, and while you're standing in line there are a bunch of pastries and bread behind the glass. Makes you just wanna try EVERYTHING!! I tried the carrot cake. It sure was yummy!\n\nWe were very excited to try our food. I ordered the Monte Cristo and my boyfriend got the French Toast Sampler. HOLY COW. Sure enough, it was great. I wish the serving amount for the Monte Cristo was a little bit bigger though! That's how good it was. It made me want more  lol \nAnyway, the French Toast sampler was yummy as well.

Easy to get to once you walk your dog or go for a run at the park. One thing about this location is the wait... It's at least an hour long... So be prepared to wait.\n\nParking wise around there I'm guessing would be horrible. Luckily I took the bus over. Small short and easy walk to the place from Columbus.\n\nMocha comes in one of those tall and skinny glass which masks really how much coffee there really is. Taste wise, it is pretty decent. Nice aroma with a robust flavor of coffee with a nice kick of chocolate too it. The cream makes a nice addition as it softens the whole thing. Small little deco to top it off.\n\nNow for the main course... The Monte Cristo! Nice decoration. It better taste better than it looks... And it does! You got the choice to either eat your sandwich sweet or salty. What I gotta say is the berry jam addition to give you the choice is a great idea. If the sandwich at any point becomes bland, you can just dip it in the jam and it just creates an alternate flavor that is pretty good to the palate. In itself the sandwich is just one big sandwich cut into 4 triangles and battered French toast style but yeah, if it does get bland to eat it plain, just dip it! Additionally, the potatoes were made right as the outside was nice and crunchy and the inside was still golden soft. \n\nAddition of the strawberry and oranges makes a good exclamation point to end the breakfast/brunch. \n\nService was pretty decent and food comes pretty fast. The staff tries to get you seated asap and makes sure to try to accommodate.\n\nOverall I would give this place a 4.5/5 stars (wait and parking not included into consideration as this would bring the rating down to may be 3 stars). Food and service is good and very tasty. Now, I'll be looking forward to the next visit. Time for you guys to come and try it! Bonne appetite!", "author": "Roger P."}

I walk by all the time and there's always a ridiculous line outside. But I went on a Saturday at 2 PM (their brunch ends at 3PM), so I didn't have to wait too long, maybe 20-30 minutes. My friend ordered french toast and I had the benedict. Tasty, but just regular brunch, not mind-blowing. Not worth hours of waiting (is anything ever worth that? lol). We also had brunch drinks, which is pretty standard although they tried to be creative with it - white wine with lemonade (my friend didn't like it, but I thought it was decent). Our cashier gave us more french toast complimentary to welcome us to SF, since we both just relocated here. Friendly, but slow service. It was also a little frustrating how you have to stand in line to order, wait and then get seated and wait some more for your food to come out. And when you're waiting outside, you see several empty tables inside and it's like, why aren't they seating more people? They are creating a line on purpose. I hate that.

The baked goods looked amazing but given the carbtastic nature of the Monte Cristo sandwich, I reined myself in to focus on the main objective, sandwich and a side of grilled potatoes.\n\nGrilled Potatoes\nMediocre. It was a little dry but they're just potatoes.  No one cares.\n\nMonte Cristo\nI went for the version with gruyere since it's a better melting cheese (often used in quiche and fondue).  To my surprise, compared to my childhood memory of the Monte Cristo at Bennigans, Mama's version is less greasy. This is definitely a plus for my waistline!  The sandwich was dipped in an egg batter and pan fried.  It reminded me of a triple layered french toast with ham and cheese.  However, after digging into it, it's was just that--simply a french toast with a thin slice of gruyere, cheddar and ham. I expect the cheese within a Monte Cristo to be melted but it was clearly not the case at Mama's.  While the presentation with homemade jam, 3 slices of oranges dotted with a strawberry half, dusted with powdered sugar was pleasant to the eye, it was poorly executed.  \n\nVerdict\nThe Monte Cristo fell short of expectations.  I left filled with food envy since the omelettes looked a lot better.  Because amazing loaded omelettes are ubiquitous in the SF brunch scene, I would not wait over 30 minutes in line at Mama's for it. \n\nLastly, Comments on Operations\nThe line outside feels artificial when nearly all the tables inside were empty upon my arrival.  It is entirely the result of an inefficient ordering process.  The line goes directly to a single cashier and she moves in slo-mo, pausing about 3-5 minutes between each order to direct the kitchen and wait staff and assign tables.

You wait in a line outside to come in and wait in line to order at a cashier then you take a seat of one of their few tables, and you get semi-service (they bring your food to the table, but I wouldn't call it full service). Pretty overpriced for the hassle and the food was fine, nothing extraordinary. What's all the hype about??

So if you don't like to wait I suggest to really come really early even before they open.\n\nBut this place is worth the wait... the food is really good and freshly made when order. So much flavor on every bite of the food. If you come in san francisco I suggest and recommend to really trying this place. You wouldn't wanna miss this opportunity to try 1 of the yummy food in san francisco. \n\nThe wait is so long I remember when we get in the long was long and when we are done it seems like the line never ending that's how good the food is.

The wait for food was a bit longer than expected,  about 20mins... we were hungry and it was so hard watching others eat next to us!  We tried the french toast sampler, chorizo benedict, and a slice of carrot cake.

It was good but nothing spectacular. I got the our famous monte cristo. I was enjoying it until I pulled out a 1 1/12 inch white hair from the cheesy part of my sandwich. I was so saddened to not have been able to finish my meal. Our waitress immediately offered to bring another plate or refund my meal. I opted to refund my meal as I was almost done with my plate anyhow. The fresh squeeze orange juice was good too but again nothing I'd have to come back for. My 9yr old picky eater ordered a large bowl of fruit (small was $7.95 and large was a dollar or two more, about $10?) and she mostly enjoyed it but the strawberries were a little unripe and too tart for her liking. For the cost, you'd think the serving size or taste would make up for it but it just didn't. It was just strawberries, cantaloupe, honey dew melon and pineapple. No blueberries! We came at 11:53a and got in to order in 45 min. But then waited another 30min for our food to come out. The big guy in a niners beanie and white t shirt was seen outside sitting on the next door pavement or steps smoking a cigarette. When he took or order he had no smile, no enthusiasm, and no sense of humor and looked really grungy.  I want to even say he seemed a bit hungover or just out of it. He had the \"why am I here right now\" type of look. I don't normally care about big, not happy type of people taking my orders but I'm slowly realizing it does make a difference in the dining experience with happy vs not so happy employees. Overall, I would come back but only with people who \"have to\" come to try this establishment. On my own though, I wouldn't bother. As a foodie, I'm glad I got to check this place off as a \"must try\" spot. Minus one start for the hair, unhappy employee taking our order, and prices to portion ratio.", "author": "Nance_ E."}

Not only was I intrigued by Mama's popularity, but I was also charmed by the Mama's Cristo sandwich $11.95, served here (Roasted turkey breast, honey baked ham, apples, Havarti and cheddar battered in egg and grilled, served with their homemade jam).  The Mama's Cristo is essentially the savory and sweet version of their Famous Monte Cristo sandwich. \n\nI made sure to blanket each bite of my Mama's Cristo with Tabasco and their homemade jam. In regards to their homemade jam, I have to admit that I appreciated its delicate sweetness. I generally stay away from jams due to overwhelming sweetness, but I highly recommend slathering on the homemade jam from here, because it's not too sweet. \n\nThough the famed Mama's Cristo was pretty interesting, I wasn't blown away. I also had the opportunity to try the Smoked Salmon Scramble $13.25 that my fianc\u00e9 ordered (smoked salmon, red onion, capers, and roasted tomatoes).  There was a generous amount of salmon in the scramble, which was really nice. The cream cheese served with the bagel that comes with this dish, could have been incorporated in the scramble for additional flavor dimension---but that's just a preference. \n\nOverall, we agreed that our experience was satisfactory, but nothing would urge us to visit again, by choice, especially since their lines can get unbearably long.

I waited an hour to get in the restaurant and another 30 minutes to get seated because they were unorganized. After that I had to wait another 30 minutes for my food, although, I already ordered while waiting for our table. I ordered:\n\nThe Classic Benedict ($12.95): Very disappointing and the potato tasted like it was undercook. The ham had a really weird texture, but the egg and english muffin was good.\n\nBlackstone Benedict ($12.95): If you want to order the Benedict, I would recommend this one. The bacon was really crispy and was perfect with the Benedict. Potato was still horrible tho.\n\nOur Famous Monte Cristo ($12.95): THIS IS AMAZING. The first bite was like meh, its okay. Then you take another bite and OMG it is so good. The jam was so good with it. The bread was sweet and the inside was savory. Went really well together.\n\nFinally, the question is, would I get in line again? HECK NO. Maybe, unless I really want the Monte Cristo, but besides that HELL NO. Not worth it. The place is super unorganized and a waste of my time.", "author": "Irene Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-05", "description": "I'm not the first to point out that the ingredients that make up french toast, pancakes, omelettes, and eggs Benedict do not add up to $$-$$$, and yet people still pay it, and line up for about an hour prior to forking over said $$. It is delicious and when you make your own, the results usually are not restaurant quality. Even if yours are restaurant quality, it is still a pain to wash all the dishes.\nI'm not one to line up for brunch or breakfast. I'm not a morning person. So Mr. Joy had the brilliant idea to dine at Mama's close to closing time, around 3PM, in hopes that we wouldn't have to compete with the brunch crowd. We still had to wait about 40 minutes, but it was a nice day, so it wasn't too bad hanging out under the green awning. Once you step into the cozy little diner, you order at the counter where all the fresh baked goods are lined up. They only take cash or debit card.\nThe thing about Mama's is you pay before you are seated. Some leave a cash tip on the table on their way out. So when we sat down at our table, there was a $10 tip, which I handed to the waitress. What would you do if you found cash just lying around on the table? Honestly, I was tempted to use it as my own tip.\n\n$6.25 Mama's Smoothie - bananas, berries, orange juice, yogurt, honey:\nMr. Joy heard good things about the smoothie, and wanted to give it a try. It was sweet, a little thick, with some seed texture throughout, so it was not a bad smoothie. But I thought the ingredients were very simple, and easy to make with a blender, so the price is too steep for me.\n\n$12.95 Monte Cristo - roasted turkey breast, honey baked ham, cheddar & gruyere cheese battered in egg, grilled, served w/ homemade jam:\nOf course I had to try the the amazing Monte Cristo sandwich as I am a fan of French sandwiches. It was beautifully plated with 4 thick triangle sandwiches, each one made up of 3 slices of battered bread. The middle slice in each sandwich makes the Monte Cristo. The plate was dusted with a little powdered sugar and accompanied with potatoes and fresh fruit. The sandwich was so fluffy and lightly crisped up on the outside. I actually thought it could have used more turkey, to balance out the carb to protein ratio, but I'm always in favor of more meat. After finishing that sandwich, I definitely felt like I had consumed enough carbs for the whole day. The jam helped me chew through all the bread, while also adding a sweet component.\n\n$11.95 Blueberry Pancakes:\nI'm not a huge fan of pancakes, but these are some very moist and fluffy pancakes. It was satisfying to cut into the fresh blueberries embedded in the pancakes.\n\n$4.95 Spicy Italian Sausage:\nThis sausage was halved and flattened out, almost looking like a sausage patty. Delicious.\n\nThe prices at Mama's are not bad compared to most brunch places with long waits. I'd still like to try the crab Benedict or pick up some freshly baked items from the Bake Shop. So perhaps one day I'll return for brunch in the afternoon, which is when I usually have my first meal on weekends.", "author": "Joy W."}

What are people doing to wait this long for the food? \n\nOh yeah, it's pretty good food. I mean I wouldn't lie and say that this isn't a tourist location because it is. \n\nThis time around since we came on the weekend we had to get the actual crab instead of the crab cakes like I had last time. \n\nIt's expensive but worth. I love crab and they definitely piled it on. For $30 dish, they made sure I felt like I got $30 worth of crab. The Benedict which I ordered was great! The omelette which one of the people I came with got, was also great with avocado and crab yum!  The other people in our groups got other omlettes also looked great! \n\nIt's like you can't go wrong here. \n\nPro tip: just be ready to wait but the food is pretty worth it.

After 20 minutes in line, I asked my friend to go check bc I didn't want to wait another 40 mins since the line (12-14 ppl in front of us) had barely moved in those 20 mins - restaurant staff assured him it'd be another 20, so to be a good friend I stayed. However, the 20 mins turned into 40 for a total of 60 to just to GET INSIDE the place. \n\nAt this point I think my wait is over but NOPE, now we were afforded the opportunity to make the INSIDE LINE in front of register to ORDER the FOOD before u are even able to get a table (they close by 3pm BTW). \n\nThey had a selection of scrambles & omelettes but none included a simple ham, cheese and mushrooms omelette/scramble. However, upon request they said sure, no problem, except no American cheese, it had to be cheddar. \n\nI asked for my omelette SOFT and so did my friend - it's a big deal to me; I hate omelettes that are so overcooked that they are literally a sponge you can use as a cushion - for a place that ONLY makes breakfast you'd think this be a simple and run of the mill request - well, it wasn't; we had about another 10 people after us while we were making the line, and half of them got served their food before our, apparently very complicated, order was brought over. \n\nGuess what? The omelette was so OVERCOOKED and hard we could have used it as a frisbee. Instead though, they used it as a Mexican tortilla and inside of it I had what seemed like a 'tumor' of leg ham and mushrooms - disproportionately big - they had made burritos out of our omelettes - And it was swimming in ham and mushroom juices. At this point the 'server' asks if it's OK, to which I said: I asked for a soft omelette and you gave me a burrito, so no, it's not OK.\n\nBecause I figured they wouldn't be able to do a decent soft omelette again, I told him to turn it into a SOFT scramble. \n\nWell, that took another 15 minutes, and which by then they had ensured to serve everyone in the restaurant, before my apparently OVERLY COMPLEX SOFT SCRAMBLE showed up. \n\nFor shock factor, they had separated all ingredients, because apparently it's unheard of that if you ask for scrambled eggs with ham, cheese and mushrooms, they are not to be scrambled and cooked together. \n\nSever asked if that's what I meant, and I blew a gasket (internally) so I said no, but that I'd work with it because I didn't have another 15 minutes to wait for scrambled eggs. It came with a baguette that I'm guessing was supposed to be toasted, but they did it in the grill and it tasted of animal fat, because the ham they use is leg ham, not deli ham - yuck - I'm Cuban, so I know all about leg ham, and it's always disgusting. It's not something you want in your breakfast. \n\nBy this point the OVERLY PACKED little restaurant was pretty much empty. \n\nThe food was, at best, standard in flavor and texture. I don't know what is everyone's effing drama about going to the place and putting up with such ridiculous waits to get an average breakfast at best - are the standards that low in San Fran? It's just a freaking run-of-the-mill breakfast place. \n\nI honestly would have enjoyed ANYTHING from Denny's WAAAYYYY more - their stuff, is better crafted, has more texture and flavor - and I'm a discerning eater - and I wouldn't hesitate choosing Denny's over this place a 100 times over. \n\nSo to summarize I'd say: Save yourself the MAMA DRAMA and leave the mommy issues for your real mama, LOL.", "author": "Carlos P."}

HOWEVER, we chose it as our out-of-town friends had a mid-afternoon flight to catch and the reviews (on their website and here) spoke about waiting up to a half hour for brunch. Reality alert! After waiting in line on the sidewalk in the hot sun for about 20 minutes I counted about 25 others in front of us and asked the Maitre D how long we should expect to wait: \"30 minutes\" he said very politely. \n\n20 minutes later he came out, looked at the line and said \"oh no, that's more than 25 so it'll be 45 minutes\". Very sincere, nice guy. Charming even. Bottom line? 1-1/2 hours standing out there till we got in the door. And then? Wait again!! You stand in front of the food prep area--for us about 30 more minutes--then finally order. Then they find you a table. \n\nBrunch came about 20 minutes after we ordered (and were seated).  So it took about TWO HOURS from the time we arrived to get our food. Again, the staff was very polite; the Maitre D was more of an MC as he kept us all entertained some of the time we were waiting.

We passed by mama's and there's always a long line at mama's and today there was no line, so I thought perfect! Went inside, third in line and There was no clear direction on seating so I told my mom to sit at an empty table in the corner while I was next to order. About a minute passed, and came up to my mom and told her if she didn't order yet she needed to get out of the seat and told her that she can move to the other side of the store where there's another table that was just about to be cleaned. The approach of the waitress was very rude, and didn't really explain why and told my mom to move. I get that they want people to sit after they order, but there was a lot of open tables so I didn't understand why she forced my mom to move out of this table. I was pretty pissed after this but since we paid for meter, I let it slide. So we ordered the Monte Christo and a French toast sampler. \n\nThe food was alright. Not great. Not bad. It's definitely not worth the wait if there's a line. The Monte Christo was a lot better than the French toast sampler. Flavorful. Pretty good. The French toast was dry, but edible, not the best I've had. Just as we were gonna end our meal, I took a sip of my water and, \"BAM\", the biggest cockroach I've ever seen. Just crawling on the walls. I was pretty grossed out. I informed my waitress, she told the people behind the register but no one really did anything or apologize to their customers. Overall, it was a pretty disappointing experience for something that's supposedly so good and 4 stars worth. Hope a health inspector comes check this place out again cause I've been to dirtier places but I've never seen a cockroach that big, probably feeding of their food!", "author": "Clarissa O."}

Yes, I understand, show up before 8:00 AM to be the first round getting in or else you'll wait an hour. My experience was poor and overall, the food did not wow me nor disappoint. \n\nFOOD: I got the Monte Cristo sandwich here with all of these wonderful reviews on yelp. Yes, the sandwich with meat, cheese, with fresh fruit, and homemade jam. All of those things can build to a great brunch, and the food was solid. Nothing superb, but solid. I will say the food is not bad. \n\nSERVICE: I wondered why I even tipped now looking back. I did not mind the hour and a half wait. We were told in advanced of the wait when my friend and I showed up at 8:15. I get that it is popular, written in travel magazines, what not. I found my service experience to be extremely diminished when I was bullied by the cashier. He asked me where I was from and I told him that I lived in Oakland, only to get a smirky comment about hoping I lived in a \"safe part of Oakland\". Sorry I can't afford to live in San Francisco! I don't appreciate the ignorance, and left a sour taste in my mouth and into my meal after waiting well over an hour. \n\nTl;dr: The food is solid. Only worth it if you're in the first round.

My friend talked me into going and the wait actually wasn't as long as we thought it would be. Probably because we came on a Wednesday. But the line moved pretty quick. We waited 30-45 min before we were seated.\n\nWhen you walk in, you go straight to their counter to order & pay. Then choose a table, and they will bring your food and drinks over to you. Service was great so it's always nice to leave a little tip before you leave. Keep in mind they only take cash or debit cards. NO credit cards.\n\nAfter my friend and I finished our lunch, we both agreed that it was good. But don't understand what the big hype is. I can see that this is a neighborhood gem, but unfortunately I feel it's overrated. The food was good, fresh. But nothing that blew me away. It felt like a casual lunch at a neighborhood cafe. Not worth the wait in my opinion. \n\nWe ordered: \n- Kugelhopf: We heard this is a popular item on their menu so we wanted to try it. It's a big slice of brioche bread so we shared one. It's a thick slice, and fluffy, and served with their homemade jam. It was good, simple. That's about as excited as we felt about it.\n- Egg White Scramble: This was our favorite dish. The scramble was very flavorful from the mushrooms and green onions. On the side were slices of tomato and wheat toast. The dish was fresh, tasty, and healthy. \n- The Californian Omlette: This omlette was good, but it was massive and full of cheese. My friend and I had a hard time finishing it because it was pretty heavy from all the cheese, bacon, and avocado. We were happy to try it though. On the side were their grilled potatoes and wheat toast. If you like hearty breakfasts, this is a good dish to get. \n\nService was wonderful and the restaurant itself is very cozy and bright.

As expected, there was a huge line out the door when we visited, but thankfully we had friends who reserved a spot for us on the line so our wait time wasn't too bad. On a regular day however, expect to wait an hour to get in the door, and another 15-30 minutes to order and get a seat. Huge props to the cashier for the killer service. While we were waiting for seats to open up, he kept us entertained with stories and interesting facts about Mama's. We had a fun conversation with him and he made sure we weren't bored the whole time.  \n\nI'm OK waiting for good food, cause all of it just adds to the excitement, anticipation and the experience. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat, this isn't the place for you. \n\nThe place has a very quaint feel to it, as it has been around for a very long time. The selection they have is crazy! A lot of their menu also involves fresh seafood, which I'm looking to try next time I return. Also heard they have great benedicts. We visited in the morning, so initially we were worried they wouldn't serve the Monte Cristo (the menu says they only start serving the sandwiches at 11), but thankfully they were serving it at the time.\n\n----\n*Mama's Famous Monte Cristo - I gotta say, this sandwich is honestly one of the tastiest meals I have ever eaten in my entire life. I have never tasted anything like it before. It's the kind of sandwich that makes you ponder life and wonder what you've been missing out on all this time. They make it so that the turkey, honey glazed ham and Gruyere cheese are sealed inside the French toast bread. The sandwich is divided into four and comes with a side of jam (freshly made jam, none of that packet stuff). Every bite is fluffy and soft, until you get to the center of the sandwich and feel the gooey cheese and savory ham and turkey melt in your mouth. The jam adds a whole other level of tartness to the sandwich. Together, the whole thing is just a perfect blend of flavors. \n-----\n\nI also tried some of Mama's Breakfast Burger, which was a daily special on the menu, but I don't think I've had enough of it to write a remember much or write a review about it. I do remember it being very delicious though.\n\nOverall, I love this place. It definitely gives off a quaint and home-like atmosphere, and serves great brunch food without sacrificing its integrity.

Just like people have mentioned you wait in line, you go inside and wait more in line to order, you get seated and the food gets brought to you, after that you will need to ask for water, coffee and tea refill because it will not happen on its own. Service needs to step up its game. \nThe food...we ordered the scrambled salmon for $12 or so it was ok and the bagel that it came with was dense and not all that good, the monte cristo for $15 was good but the raspberry jam that it was brought with was the bomb, my banana walnut toast that was $12 was ok, the banana bread was on a dry side and it could have been more moist. I was under the impression that the baked goods were baked there but they are not, they come in a package. \nThe prices are high, for 3 items, tea, ice tea and 2 to go crumb cakes we paid $60. \nThe old fashion crumb cake, small I might ad  for $4.50 was dry but the apple crumb cake was off the hook - super moist and just incredible. \n\nWould I come back for the food - no\nWould I come back for the prices - no way \nWould I come back for the line - hells no.\n\nFirst and the last time.", "author": "Magda G."}

I was the last one on the list, but I shared a table with another patron (the restaurant was filled). At 8am, they slowly let 2-3 parties in at a time, and inside is where you stand in line to order and pay. After paying, they direct you to a table. I got inside around 8:15am to order, sat down, and the food came at about 8:45am. I ate and got out of there by 9:15am. By then, the line was down the street.\n\nNow, on to the food. I ordered the monte cristo, and it was life changing! I am usually not a fan of mixing savory with sweets (i.e. bacon donuts, savory crepes, etc.), but the monte cristo just worked! In this case, the sandwich is savory, and the homemade jam is sweet. I don't know how, but they worked well together. I devoured 2, and I think that's where I should have stopped. After the 3rd piece, I started feeling sick. The 4th went to waste. I offered the other patron, but he was stuffed so he only took a bite of one of the slices. If you have people to share dishes with, it would be great. In my case, no one wanted to get up early on vacay. I also ordered a cup of grapefruit juice, and it was refreshing. The other patron ordered a northern italian omelette and he loved every single bite of it.\n\nI agree that the food is incredible. The way they run things is efficient and organized.

Mama's just set the bar way too high and now everything falls flat for my newfound expectations. Thanks a lot, Mama's.\n\nIn all seriousness, I came here with my girlfriend over the winter and we fell in love with this place. Sure, the wait is sometimes long but it honestly isn't that bad, we only waited like 30 minutes and it was WORTH IT (we got there at 8 AM). Once you finally get inside, there's yet another line that you need to wait in. This one is a lot better because you wait right in front of chefs and you get to watch them cook, it's amazing.

The menu is huge and they have a bunch of delicious options for everybody. \n\nThe service here is just as good as the food, which is saying a lot. They gave us a larger table because we ordered food for four people even though there was only two of us haha. Every waitress/worker here was so incredibly nice, not just to us either but to everyone in there (it's a small restaurant, you can see everyone). \n\nNOW FOR THE FOOD:\nI ordered the Washington Omelette. Excuse my language but it was fucking magically delicious. It gave me this weird feeling of wanting to eat it and wanting to smear it on my chest at the same time. Eggs were perfectly cooked and it was STUFFED with ingredients. Side of potatoes were awesome too, i normally hate potatoes but I ate all of them (ask for some hot sauce).\n\nMy girlfriend ordered one of their Benedicts, I forgot which one it was but she said it was one of the best she's ever had. Based on all their other food, I'm sure you'll be safe in ordering any of their Benedicts.\n\nOur third plate was the French Toast Sampler, three flavors of incredible magical french toast with fresh fruit all over it. Our favorite was the Cranberry Orange but the other two were also freaking good too. wow. SO GOOD.\n\nFinally, we also ordered the Monte Cristo. LISTEN TO ME. PLEASE. YOU MUST ORDER THIS. YOU HAVE NOT LIVED UNTIL YOU HAVE TRIED THE MONTE CRISTO HERE. I can't even string together the right words to describe how good it is to you people, it's incredible. It's like having sex on top of a flying unicorn. I don't know how they ever managed to make a sandwich taste this good but they did, and with the jam they give you....wow, I am not worthy. \n\n\n\n*********\nFor all the people who are giving this magical place only 2 or 3 stars and then having the nerve to say that it is subpar to other breakfast places.

I guess the hunger is real. \n\nAfter standing an hour in line, outside and inside, on a weekday (don't people have work!?), we finally made it to the front to order. They have menus on the windows outside and a huge menu board on the inside. Trust me, you'll have enough time in line to pick what you want to eat.\n\n- Washington Square Omelet (Spicy Italian Sausage, Bell Pepper, Tomatoes and Hot Pepper Jack Cheese): huge portions and they don't skimp on the ingredients inside. It comes with toast that tastes delicious with their homemade jam.\n- Corned Beef Eggs Benedict: I normally don't like corned beef because it's too salty for me, but these were flavorful and just salty enough. The egg and hollandaise sauce were awesome.\n- Monte Cristo: French toast ham and cheese sandwich. So delicious! If you look on Yelp, this is probably the most popular item. \n\nAfter Gary and I finished splitting the omelet and Eggs Benedict, we began to eat the Monte Cristo. If we weren't so stuffed, we would've been able to finish the whole thing because it is AMAZING.

Not really :( \n\nNot sure why we were still surprise by the line but yes, there was a line out the door on this Saturday morning. As we tried to entertain ourselves for a little over an hour, we finally got in! Once you are in, you first order your food and then the waitress will direct you to your table. Mama's is known for their brunch and breakfast foods. From benedicts to toasts to to pancakes to omelettes, they got it all. They also have their specials (not on the menu). I ordered the North Beach Benedict ($13.25) which consisted of two poached eggs, prosciutto and grilled tomato served on top of toasted english muffin with homemade Hollandaise Sauce with a side of potatoes. The food tasted good but I didn't think it was great!! After waiting an hour and a half, I expected the food to be AMAZING. But it did not blow my mind. My friends got the Norwegian Benedict ($14.75) which came with smoked salmon on top of everything else. Again, it was alright. We also shared a Swedish Cinnamon French Toast ($9.50) which actually tasted better than I expected it. I thought it may have just been an overpriced bougie French Toast but it actually tasted like a really really good, moist, fluffy french toast. Other than that, I didn't leave the restaurant feeling satisfied. \n\nAfter we left in the late morning, there was still a very long line out.

Furthermore, being not a native of San Francisco, I notice that chefs do not use gloves for meal prep in a couple of restaurants, this being one of them. That makes me really uncomfortable.

I came here with a friend of mines that lives in the city and it was both of our first time there. The wait was about 1 hour or less for us, but it was fine since the weather was nice and we had soo much to catch up on. There is no reservations, you walk in and stand in line. They call you in by who was there first. The line at the door is usually long, but as you are near the front you can see the menu clear and gives you an idea of what you want to order. Once you are at the front they ask you how big your party is ask you to wait then let you enter. As you walk in they tell you to stand in another line along the register to order your food and pay first. After you pay they seat you at the appropriate table for your party. My friend and I sat in the booth. We ordered an omelette, chocolate chip french toast, and monte cristo sandwich. The portions were huge and shockingly I was able to finish my food. The omelette my friend ordered tasted like combination pizza so it was ok, the monte cristo was pretty small, but with the housemade jam it was delicious, and the chocolate chip french toast was delicious. I think the french toast was my favorite meal there. The staff we had was friendly and very attentive. She came by frequently to check how we were doing and refilled our waters. If you need to use the restroom while you are there it is a small unisex bathroom. You have to wait by the kitchen incase someone is down there already and walk through the kitchen to go down to the back to use the bathroom. Their bathroom is pretty much in a small shed.

When you are ushered inside you expect a seat only to be directed another line in front of the kitchen leading to the register. As you near the register you hope you know what you want by looking at the multiple boards containing the menus. Upon ordering, you wait to be seated while trying to avoid blocking the servers and guests as they pass. Once you are seated it is heavenly with delicious food and drinks. The restroom is another adventure, be prepared to step down some very steep steps outside the back of the building in what is like an afterthought restroom. Overall was fun.

It is my favorite thing about Saturday. \n2: I eat eggs Benedict everywhere, every week.\n\nI feel like I can give an accurate and experienced review because of these things.\n\nEveryone and their dog has either heard of, or already eaten at, Mamas. With about a million referrals and getting tired of the same, \"Oh you haven't had brunch until you've had Mama's. BEST IN THE CITY!\" comments I figured to give it a try. \n\nMaybe this was a rookie mistake, but although I had heard a line was eminent I didn't believe it would be THAT BAD. Oh man. Never have I ever waited an hour and a half for eggs Benedict on the curb. \n\nOnce inside, I loved the environment and culture. You can see staff working on delicious food in front of you before you place your order, making you second guess every decision about this meal you thought was right. (At least that's how my wife felt. Like I said, I always get Eggs Benedict).\n\nWe were seated and our food came out much more quickly than I expected, which was good because after waiting in the sun we were both getting a little hangry. I ordered eggs Bene' and my wife ordered the vegetarian omelette, with bacon. (The staff found that hilarious but I thought the funniest part was an omelette that is vegetarian?!?)\n\nBoth dishes were great! The eggs Benedict was delicious but not LIFE CHANGING like it is painted to be. It was a well done and delicious meal!\n\nSo why only 3 stars? I don't feel like the food matches the reputation or wait. I would go again, definitely, if I only had to wait 20 minutes. But 1.5 hours? Guys....

Minus 5 million stars for this, but I am trying to be objective. There is simply no reason why this restaurant should only accept cash other than being too cheap to pay the transaction fee associated with cards. The prices are higher than average, leaving plenty of room for those transaction fees. Plus, every other restaurant accepts cards. Maybe I am being too fussy, but I am just not going to stop at an ATM just so I can eat here. \n\nIt's also very shady that they are cash only and don't keep solid records of their transactions!

Since Mama's closes at 3, we didn't have a long wait as long (only around 30 minutes before we ordered & got seated), which was great - I've heard that the wait can be hours if you get here at peak times. The menu items all sounded mouthwateringly delicious, and it was so tough to make a decision. I like how you can watch the kitchen staff make and assemble all of the dishes while you wait in line, which adds to the salivation that I was developing in my mouth. One thing that I did notice though was that the blueberries to top the french toast were frozen, not fresh, and there were some bugs flying around the bread that's used for the french toast... hm not the most ideal. Nevertheless, my friend and I were so excited to order, and we wound up choosing the Famous Monte Cristo & the special Lemon Blueberry French Toast. \n\nMONTE CRISTO: this dish was pretty good. Made our trip here worth it. It's basically a sandwich embedded within french toast - creative dish and very visually appealing. The blend of cheeses is perfect, and the taste, overall, was very on point. Super satisfying to my taste buds. I ate it by itself, without dipping in the jam.\n\nLEMON BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST: very ehh. Pretty bland, honestly. The lemon and blueberry flavors were both not prominent. Workers forgot to add berries on our french toast, so it didn't look as good as the other french toast dishes that we saw leaving the kitchen when we were waiting in line.\n\nTHE FAMOUS JAM... tasted just like normal jam. Nothing too special, especially since I'm not the greatest fan of jam.\n\nOverall, it was a good brunch, but not life-changing. If I were you, I'd come to try it out if the wait is less than an hour.

Brenda's soul food cafe is one example - many food are super champ and are what many people cannot make on our own.   \n\nhope this helps!  Make your food spendings worth! :)", "author": "Clara L."}

There are plenty of reviews,  thousands actually,  talking about the most popular things to order so I'm going to skip all that. \n\nLet me tell you how is going to go when you visit.  There will be a line,  you'll wait a long time and probably meet  people from all over the world while doing it,  it will be worth it. You'll read reviews and know what you just have to order. You might have anxiety when you're ushered into the restaurant because you just can't decide. \n\nDon't worry about it.  You'll have at least 20 minutes more inside watching the line. That is going to make you change your mind on what to order more times than you can count. Just when you're settled on what to get you'll near the cash register. Right there at eye level you'll see plates of a variety of crumb cake flavors. These were not even a consideration in my ordering until now and under pressure I caved. Yes, I'll take one! \n\nThen came the freshly warmed square of chocolate crumb cake to our table. One of those perfect pieces with 50/50 cake to crumb ratio. Warmed just enough to where the crumb turns into almost a thin layer of frosting where the crumb meets cake. It's moist, not overly sweet perfection a plate. I considered waiting in line again just to leave with a few more pieces to go.\n\nBottom line - yes the food is worth the wait. Listen to everyone else about what to order for your main entr\u00e9e or just be inspired by what you see on the line but start with the crumb cake.", "author": "Sarah S."}

Standing in line and waiting for a table anywhere, especially when I'm hungry is typically a bad mix. But if I want brunch in SF, ultimately, I have to wait for it. On the Wed before Thanksgiving break last year, I decided to try my luck at Mama's. We did a drive by and the line didn't look too bad, so we decided to give it a shot! Yay for getting off work early! Sadly, the line moved really slowly. Once I got close to the door, I realized there was another line inside! WTF?! More waiting?! By this time, it was too late to give up. Finally after an hour we were inside and at the cash register! We decided on:\n\n-Mimosa ($7) - Cuz I always need a little alcohol with every meal! Lol!\n-Classic corn beef hash and eggs, over easy with whole grain toast ($12.25) - The roommate's plate.\n-Mama's sampler french toast plate: Banana nut, Chocolate brioche, Cranberry orange walnut covered w/berries and bananas ($10.95) - Yum! Who doesn't love a french toast buffet on a plate?!\n-Washington square omelette with sourdough baguette ($10.95) - Filled with spicy sausage and melty pepperjack cheese! One of my favorite combos in an omelette! \n-Side of bacon ($3.75) - Cuz brunch isn't complete without a side of bacon!\n\nWe ended up at a table right by the front entrance which was uncomfy for the roommate. He doesn't like it when people watch him eat. I was fine since I was facing the other direction, but I do understand where he was coming from. Basically everyone in line is watching you have breakfast while trying to pass time. So instead of a solid 5 stars based on just the food, I'm giving Mama's a 4!", "author": "Elena N."}

Not bad considering sometimes people wait anywhere from 2-3... But with the sun shining down on you, the wait can seem very tedious! When we got to the front of the line, we were so excited. This was my first time at Mama's and I knew it was super popular from all the pictures and yelp reviews.\n\nAfter debating internally for quite a while in line, I finally decided on getting the Norwegian benedict, which included smoked salmon and capers over an english muffin, topped with two poached eggs and hollandaise with a side of potatoes. I also added avocado for I think $1 or $1.50? The smoked salmon tasted really fresh, and not salty at all which was great! It complemented the hollandaise really well because the hollandaise was very rich. The eggs were poached perfectly which I was so happy about because when I get benedicts with eggs cooked too long... I don't enjoy it. I like those runny yolks!!! \n\nI definitely want to come back and try the monte cristo... or the crab benedict when I have mo money hahaha. If the monte cristo here compares to the one at Disneyland in Cafe Orleans, i'm sure i'll be very impressed! \n\nThe service is really nice here, everyone is super friendly and accommodating.

We waited for 1:55 minutes for mediocre breakfast food. The one thing this place has going for them is that their food is original. I had never heard of banana nut bread French toast before. We ordered the monte cristo, French toast sampler, and two large orange juices. When we were finally allowed to enter the building, we had to wait in line again to place our order. While in line inside, you can watch the chefs cook the food. That's only if you can look past the multiple fruit flies hovering over all their breads and cakes.  \n\nThe fresh-squeezed orange juice was fresh-tasting but room temperature. Once the food arrived, the French toast sampler, which included Swedish cinnamon, lemon berry, and banana nut bread, had a nice flavor but seemed like it had been sitting for a bit. The Swedish cinnamon was hard to cut through but the lemon berry was nice and fresh. I liked the monte cristo better than the French toast. The ham was yummy and the cheese was a nice pairing in the sandwich. \n\nOne of the main reasons I wanted to go to Mama's was to try their homemade jam.

The food isn't that good and expensive. I got the crab omelet. It was $27 plus $2 to substitute 3 slices of tomatoes instead of potatoes. The egg on the omelet was overcooked and a bit rubbery and the tomatoes that I paid an additional $2 for wasn't even ripe. And the crab w the omelet was not a good pairing and needed a sauce.

Relief from the heat and One step closer to trying Mamas for the first time. There is another line at the counter to order once you get in but it went by pretty quickly inside. I ordered a vegetarian omelette and split a French toast sampler with the hubby. Everything was deeeeelicous ! My omelette as cooked perfectly and well seasoned. It also came piping hot which was great because it's so unappealing to have luke warm food. \n\nThe French toast sampler was delicious and a perfect way to try a couple of different ones ! Their homemade jam is also yummy and great to add on your toast.\n\nI would love to come back soon but will have to strategically time it so I don't have to wait in line so long !", "author": "Nancy T."}

It's always a bit of a trek to get up there on the weekends...especially because San Franciscans LOOOVE their BRUNCH.\n\nWe showed up here shortly before closing and just made the cut-off. The good part of that was that the line was only a 30 minute wait...\n\nYou step inside, order at the counter, and then they seat you. Food comes out rather quickly and you are left to enjoy your brunch without too much interference. :)\n\nWe ordered:\n1. Monte Cristo - Think about a moons over my hammie but lux-ified, less greasy, and way more high-end classy. This is pretty much it. The bread is perfect, the egg batter is fluffy, and you don't walk away feeling like you ate a cup of lard. This lots of the charts in my all time favorite breakfast items and could probably eat it every day for the rest of my life..\n\n2. French Toast Sampler - So this wasn't my favorite. I can't help it. I'm not usually a fan of orange zest or fancy fruity toast...so this was already on the \"less favored\" team when I ordered it. It was alright, but probably wouldn't ever order it again.\n\n3. Pancakes - EVERYONE says the order the french toast, but when we asked the cashier..he said PANCAKES. So we ordered both. and man...pancakes is freakin' right. I would pick them over the french toast any day. yummm. Super fluffy..and you HAVE to try it with the homemade jam. It is soooooo clutch.\n\n4. Crab Benny - B LOVED this one...he liked the big chunks of crab in it and thought the ratio was perfect. I'm pretty sure he ate all the crab off of the other one (aka my half), because I didn't get much of the crab and had mostly greens. lol! Either way..I liked it well enough, just not as much as HE liked it. \n\nWould definitely be back if the wait is decent. They have a huge selection of coffee cakes as well...will have to try ALL OF THEM next time :)", "author": "Jennifer S."}

I originally wanted to try Mama's Cristo, but they substituted with the Monte Cristo because they were out of some of the ingredients.

Is it worth the wait?\nAfter your outside wait you are cautiously let into the place where you wait in another line to order your food. At the counter you are told no credit cards just cash. Two for breakfast was close to $50 bucks.\nYou then are told what table to sit at. At one point my friend thought we were going to have to go to the counter to get our food. No that was not the case. A very pleasant lady brought them over. I had two run ins with the Napolenic bus boy. The reason for no credit card is that cash is king and creates a nice vacation kitty.

The wait was about 30min to 1 hour, but time passed quickly as I had good company. The restaurant looked very cute, homely, and very inviting! I was excited thinking that we made it as we got to the door, and then my heart dropped when I saw the line INSIDE. WHHYYYYYYYYYYYY. Mama's was really clever to have us line up along the kicthen- we got a full view of all the dishes that were being made and served. Not only was it torturous to see and smell all the food while we lined up, but it was just as agonizing to change my mind over and over everytime I saw a dish being prepped. \"I want this- no wait I wan't- but that- OMGGGG\". Being the big eaters that we were, my +1 and I ordered:\n\nWashington Square omelette\nSouth of the Border omelette\n Orange and Cranberry mimosas, \nfruit bowl\n French toast sampler ~\n\nThe food + vibe + staff friendliness made it a 5 star place, but it wasn't until my second visit that I found the \"thing\" that put Mama's on my list of favorite brunches\n\nDuring my second visit on a Saturday (around 11) with some friends we waited ~2 hours (I've never waited that long for food before...). Again, good company made the time fly, but the staff member selling beverages to those lining up made things better. Be advised that any beverages ordered have to be paid in line and in cash.\nThis time I decided to try the salmon benedict, which was good (who doesn't love benedicts??) but I couldn't help but eye my friend's salmon scramble. I was fed but not completely satisfied and decided to order a stack of pancakes with berries. I need to remind myself that my stomach can't take in as much food as my eyes do... needless to say I was very full and couldn't finish the pancakes. No regrets though, as I discovered how yummy the pancakes were there! The french toasts from my first visit were delicious, but OMG those pancakes were the fluffiest, most perfecrly buttered pancakes that I've ever had. Gotta give them a try to understand what I mean. I don't usually order sweet dishes as my main course but Mama's may be that exception.", "author": "Sherry Y."}

It was amazing and the raspberry jam on the side was great although I still prefer the toast with maple syrup.  \n\nMy friend ordered the monte Cristo which looked like  a combination on fresh toast and grilled cheese. It was great especially with the side of potatoes. We ended up splitting our plates so I was able to get it all.  \n\nI highly recommend this spot. Great brunch food but just expect to wait.

It seemed to take quite a while, giving the the people waiting plenty of time to peruse the menu posted in the window. \n\nWhen we finally arrived at the door (after around 45 min.), a waitperson quizzed us on how many people, then closed the door on our faces - you must wait to be summoned a few minutes later.

Mamas controls the crowd by controlling entry to the restaurant. \n\nWe had the special crab Benedict containing spinach.

We arrived at the end of the Mama's line around 11:00am and were seated around 1:30pm. Yes this was quite the wait. Luckily we brought books with us to read while we waited (I highly recommend this!). \n\nWe ordered the crab benedict, Washington square omelet, and french toast sampler.  \n\nI am a fan of crab and thought the benedict was the bee's knees.

I tend to fair on the side of not liking sausage so the bf enjoyed most of that. \n\nThe french toast sampler was tasty! My favorite was the challah... great texture to the bread with the perfect smidge of cinnamon. \n\nTip: Ask for jam for the toast... the berry jam is AMAZING!\n\nWhen we come back we will: \n\na) Get in line wayyyy earlier.\nb) Order the Monte Cristo and Coffee Cake. \n\nLast note that they only accept cash or debit cards.

Thank goodness, as the line was already forming! They don't open til 8, but it's always good to get there early. One thing if you haven't been there before: there's no waiting inside. The place is adorably tiny and they only let you in the door as space becomes available. Not a place to bring a double stroller or screaming starving toddlers. We were lucky enough to be one of the last tables seated before it was full and the wait began outside. Ordered 3 different types of Benedict, plus plain old scrumptious coffee cake. So good! We should've gotten a piece of cake each, but were behaving ourselves?! Anyway, great breakfast spot!", "author": "Gretta B."}

We waited a little over an hour even though we went at like 1:30ish. I heard one hour wait is no biggie at this place by the way, many wait way longer. Anyhow, is it worth it? I guess so. Just a note, prepare to circle around and around for meter parking!\n\nAnyhow, I had the French Toast Sampler with Fresh Fruits, which is great for a newbie like me who never tried any of their bread before. My sampler of French toasts were made with the Swedish Cinnamon, the Cranberry-Orange, and the Banana Nuts bread. The presentation was amazing--very appetizing and colorful. My favorite was the Cranberry-orange one because it has a tang to the sweet maple syrup. I also had a bite of my friend's Egg Benedict, which tasted typical enough. \n\nOhhh, I highly recommend the carrot cake here though. I ordered one and had a bite despite how full I was from brunch.

So why are people lining up for 2.5 hours at the corner of North Beach? Because Mama's Brunch. There are three big reasons why Mama's is such a consistently popular place.\n\nReason Numero Uno: THE MONTE CRISTO\nThe Monte Cristo is the crown jewel of this popular brunch place. It is basically a french toast ham and cheese sandwich served beautifully on a powder sugared plate. You can choose to bite right into the crispy exterior of the french toast and let the warm ham and cheese slowly fill into your taste buds, OR you can choose to cut the sandwich up into tiny pieces and dip them into a sweet syrup before your epic indulgence. \n\nReason Number Two: CRAB BENEDICT\nThe Dungeness Crab Benedict is so delicious that it would make Benedict Arnold come back over to the U.S. Army. It's pretty hard to turn your back on fresh-tasting crab engulfed in egg yolk and hollandaise sauce. You can betray your country Mr. Arnold, but you can't betray your tummy!\n\nReason Number Three: HYPE\nAs good as Mama's is, the wait is 2.5 hours no joke on a bloke. So if you go consistently, you must either be a very patient grasshopper or simply a bonafide hypebeast. Let's be real, we are only talking about breakfast food. I don't care how organic the eggs are or how much powdered sugar they put on the plate, no brunch should be worth waiting 2.5 hours for under the heat of the blazing North Beach sun.\n\nWith that being said, I'll probably still go to Mama's if I know of a friend that hasn't been here before.

And yep, I did have to wait in that infamous 1.5 hour long line before I got seated like the rest of the folks. Lined up at 8AM, got in at approximately 9:30AM. In order to eat here, you must have patience, persistence, and a tolerable hunger level. With the amount of waiting, I felt like I was going to die from starvation before I got in, but luckily I made it in and out alive. Also, it's really nice of Mama's to have a waitress come outside and offer coffee to waiting customers in line.\n\nThe line leads to a hanging menu above and eventually, the cashier who rings up your order. You pretty much order what you've been eyeing on the menu before you get led to your assigned table. The workers are all hard-working and nice, but are definitely busy so it may be hard to get one's attention right away. My boyfriend and I ordered the French Toast Sampler, The Californian Omelette, Northern Italian Omelette, Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice, and a smoothie.\n\nCalifornian Omelette - Prepared very well with crispy bacon, avocado, and Monterey Jack Cheese. Not too burnt or watery, and very fluffy. Delicious, but I would not recommend it because it is a bit on the plainer side (I'd suggest an omelette with more ingredients in it).\n\nNorthern Italian Omelette - Includes Italian Cured Bacon, mushroom, fresh basil, tomatoes, and garlic jack cheese. My boyfriend loved this one; me not so much. I thought it was a bit too pepper-y or too many spices in a bite for my taste. But try it for yourself, I'm sure it's delicious :)\n\nFreshly Squeezed Orange Juice - Very freshtasting and delicious. Quenches your thirst perfectly on a hot day. Recommended.\n\nSmoothie - Delicious and fresh tasting as well. You can taste the blended texture of fresh fruits and not something artificial at all. Recommended.\n\nFrench Toast Sampler - Very good, and I would recommend it for everybody to try! It features three different types/flavors of toasts, and I enjoyed the one that tasted like cinnamon the most. Comes with syrup and fruits such as blueberries, strawberries, and bananas. Definitely big enough to split too.\n\nI hope my recommendations help you with your first or returning visit, but this place is definitely a must-try to check off of your foodie bucketlist!", "author": "Michelle S."}

I stood in the November sun for over 1.5 hours for a hallowed seat at Mama's. Why is a question I will continue to ask myself for another year. This was further reinforced by the collective sigh I head once the line I was standing in let us inside to wait even further. Like wtf. \n\nFood was not instagrammable, I am sorry to report so I didn't even get bragging rights and I bet ppl are questioning whether I have even BEEN to the sacred grounds of a routine top-tenner in the SF brunch scene. Well my little haters, I have, and yes, therefore I am better than you. \n\nFood was still yum. I dug into some of my friend's Kugelhopf and excusing how it sounds like kegel, it was very good. I also enjoyed Chocolate Cinnamon. Unfortunately, the 2.5 hours I had reserved for brunch were largely eaten by this line so by the time my freshly prepared food made it to the table I had 20 mins to scarf down and have convo with friends so I took my dish to go. \n\nWord to wise - Chocolate cinnamon looks unsightly after 2 hours in the box.

My boyfriend and I got in line thirty minutes before opening on a Tuesday morning and we were still pretty far back in line. It took us around 45 minutes to get in, so it would be advantageous for you to come on an early morning weekday so you can find parking and avoid standing in line 5ever.\nOnce you get in, you stand in another short line to order and wait around until a server finds an empty table for you. It's a very staggered system for maximum efficiency. Luckily, your eyes will have many things to ogle while you wait. Watch the cooks through the glass doing their thing. Read the articles about Mama on the wall. Stare at the beautiful pastries.\nWe decided on the Monte Cristo ($13) and the vegetarian omelette ($12). The vegetarian omelette was DELICIOUS. It had such a generous serving of creamy goat cheese inside. The omelette comes with potatoes and your choice of bread. I chose the sourdough. There are glasses of homemade strawberry jam at every table, which I used for my bread. I also asked for butter and I think that's homemade too. \nMy boyfriend loved his Monte Cristo and the apple crumble he ordered. They heat the crumble up for you and bring it out before your meal so you have something to snack on while you wait.", "author": "Jordyn Yian C."}

But no, there is no host/hostess, & there is no waiting list. You literally have to stand in line the entire time you're waiting (over an hour on weekends). \n\nWhen we finally got in, we got the Dungeness crab eggs benedict & the french toast sampler. Both of them were really good, but like I said, not worth the wait. The french toast sampler came with 3 pieces - cinnamon, cranberry-orange, & banana walnut. My favorite was the banana walnut, which is especially good when you eat it with the banana slices it comes with.

We got in line at 8:25 on a Saturday morning and were told approximately an hour wait from the nice man who kept coming out to keep tabs on the ever-growing line. I was hoping he'd bring out cups of coffee, as I'd read in previous reviews, but that didn't happen. Listening to the chatter around us from other die-hard \"I must eat at Mama's this morning\" customers, it was apparent that there were some locals in line. When a local is willing to wait, you know you're onto something good. All in all, we sat down at 10:10, after a 20 minute wait once we were actually inside the restaurant. I get that it's an extra line to wait in, but you get to ogle the breads and pastries and wake up your sleepy stomach. We had a lovely chat with the cashier, who said this was his family's business and he knew the answers to all our questions like the back of his hand. \n\nAll in all, we waited 2 1/2 hours from the moment we were in line before we got to taste the delicious morsels Mama's offers! Order everything you want, even if it sounds like a little much. Because come on, how often are you going to wait in a line like that? We got the Mama's Monte Cristo (11.95), French Toast Sampler (11.25), Mama's Berry Smoothie (5.50), large OJ (4.50), side of scrambled eggs, and a coffee (2.50). It was all perfection. Sublime, exquisite bliss. The waiters were smiling and quickly gave us water and coffee refills as we needed them. I was surprised they were so jovial under such a stressful situation, but I guess that's their everyday work. The berry smoothie was sweet, fruity, and smooth. The breads were fluffy, flavorful, and buttery. The OJ tasted like someone had literally crushed the oranges while they were still on the tree. The scrambled eggs were soft and light without a hint of brown, exactly how I like my eggs!\n\nTalk to any of those happy people stumbling out of the door after their meal, plump and blissful, and they'll totally tell you it was worth the wait...if they're able to speak through their food coma.", "author": "Carlye M."}

We probably waited for 15 minutes but I would have waited longer. I love this place. But, carve some time out for a wait just in case you have to. I don't know how everything tastes so magical at Mama's but I promise it does. Once you are inside you order your meal at the counter. It's hard to make a choice because there are so many options. I asked the waitress what her favorite was and she said the Mama's french toast sampler or the Monte Cristo. My daughter got the Mama's sampler and i got the California omelet. The sampler comes with 3 different breads (Cranberry Orange Bread, Banana Bread, Cinnamon Sugar Bread) with fresh strawberries and bananas on top. Our plan was to split the two dishes in half so we could try it all. Seriously do this!The omelet comes with your choice of bread and country style potatoes. You'll need to pay with cash and it's a little pricey (but worth it). Then they will seat you. The omelet was perfection. Perfectly crisp bacon, avocado and monterey jack cheese. They bring this homemade jam to the table which is heavenly on the toast. The potatoes were good but super filling. Next time, I'll get fruit instead. My daughter's sampler was so good. Of the three breads, the cinnamon was my favorite but i also enjoyed the cranberry orange. My daughter got the banana smoothie which was one of the best I've ever tried. I got the fresh squeezed orange juice which was perfect. Leave a tip at the table for the friendly service. We also got the apple crumb cake and the chocolate crumb cake. Both were delicious. We were all sad when we were too full to eat any more.", "author": "M H."}

Does it really need another one.\n\nAt some point, I think some look for something to give a lower rating. I mean I can do that too. I can remove 1-2 stars simply by saying the wait SUCKS. And you aggressively have to try and come early so your wait is not too long, or come twoards the end of the day so the wait isn't too long. Also add, that hype made this place so popular. Sure I can say all that and instantly mark the rating down.\n\nBut I won't. I look at places differently when I review it. Regardless of the hype, the food is legit. The vibe and atmosphere once you are \"IN\" definitely adds to the entire experience. A real quaint and intimate experience while eating---if you can ignore the many outside peering in the window looking at you. \n\nYou can see the staff hard at work when you walk in to order. You can see all the fresh ingredients they use. The wait staff is very nice, sincere, and attentive without being intrusive as you eat. They don't try to rush you in anyway despite knowing the crazy line.\n\nOn this occasion we had of course the Monte Cristo and an omelette. The Monte Cristo here won't leave you feeling like you are about to get a heart attack, like a Monte Cristo should. So can we really say this is an authentic Monte Cristo? HA! It was good though. Clean and fresh tasting. Same goes for my omelette. \n\nThere is not much else to say about the food. I've ate at so many hyped and touted breakfast places. Yes you can tell when a place uses high quality ingredients, but most breakfast items are not complex and most places can cook a pretty good breakfast. This place is indeed much superior than most, but I have a handful I consider on the same level as Mama's. Using fresh ingredients, sometimes bread freshly made in house, etc. If you are a fellow foodie, of course you have to try this place. Get it under your belt. Despite the hype and popularity, the place does not seem to have degraded in quality. The price also does not seem overly inflated compared to other highly ranked breakfast places in the city. \n\nI would definitely go again, but won't go out of the way or put forth the effort to do so. Meaning, if it just happens that we're in the city 30mins to an hour before the place opens, lets go. But won't bother waiting in line if its a 1.5+ hr wait.", "author": "Eugene N."}

Honestly I am pretty simple with my breakfast foods: pancakes, bacon, hash browns, etc but they didn't have anything like that. I simply got the \"two eggs anyway\" and added bacon because that seemed to be the closest I could get. My boyfriend ordered the Monte Cristo and it looked and tasted great. To be honest, I wish I got the Monte Cristo. It was the most delicious breakfast plate I ever had. \n\nThe reason for the four stars is that the seating was incredibly small and the waitresses seemed to have forgotten my coffee after I asked about it twice. The concept of ordering first and then having a seat was confusing to me, but I guess if that's how they work then so be it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-19", "description": "The first time I went to Mama's:\n\nWe waited for 40 minutes after getting there ~10am, then we were led to queue in front of the register to order our meals. We then had to wait another 10 mins inside the shack after paying at the cashier. That was a bit confusing. However, service was awesome and the food was pretty good--but not worth a 50 minute wait though. I had the Washington Square omelet for $10.99 (this was in 2013), which is pretty decent. The omelet was large and the home made raspberry jam was great. \n\nThe second visit to Mama's:\n\nWe waited for 15 minutes after getting there ~12pm. Our buddy came to visit SF and we wanted to give him the full SF experience. Harking back to my very good first visit, I decide that this place would be worth the premium price that they charge (most of the prices have gone up). I had a hard time deciding what to get this time since I had the omelet two years ago. I was really worried that I would be disappointed if I chose a sandwich versus breakfast item. But, summoning my courage, I decided to go with a sandwich: The Famous Monte Cristo for $12.95. \n\nThe presentation was very nice, complete with cute little triangle sandwiches, slices oranges topped with strawberries, their famous jam in the middle, and a side of your choosing. You can choose between potato salad, a regular mixed salad, or roasted potatoes. In my case, I told the cashier roasted potatoes, but I was served potato salad. I immediately told the waiter that I asked for roasted potatoes. She then proceed to ask the kitchen to get a free side plate of roasted potatoes compliments of the staff! All was going too well. \n\nBut after the first bite, I immediately regretted my decision in choosing the sandwich over the other breakfast items. The sandwich consisted of ham, turkey, melted cheese nestled in two bread slices that were dipped in egg and pan fried. The taste was underwhelming and each bite was drier than the last. Eating the first piece was ok, but by the time I got to the third piece I was overcome with boredom and dreaded consuming the last piece. The only savior to my dish was, ironically enough, the potato salad. The moisture was a good complement to the dry and boring sandwich. I was still hungry by the time I devoured the sandwich and potato salad, so thankfully I had the free side of roasted potatoes. After consuming the orange slices and the strawberries (none of which were in season, mind you), I was left a bit disappointed with my experience. If only I ordered the omelet like I did two years ago... \n\nBottom Line: Get there around noon to avoid the wait. Don't get the sandwiches; it's a breakfast place so treat yourself to an omelet or something. This is a place you need to try just once, since it's a premium price for decent, but not extraordinarily amazing food. Finally, it's cash only.", "author": "Andrew C."}

No matter when you go, be prepared to wait at least a good half hour. Also, the seating of tables is very inefficient.

I can't remember where it was, but we were actually going to eat somewhere else, that ended up being closed. After not as much research as I'd like, we decided on Mama's.\n\nHere's the thing - maybe we were bummed because it wasn't our first choice... but I have to say that I would never stand in that line again. It truly was really good, but not OMG SEAUX EPIC.\n\nFor reference, I had the Swedish Cinnamon French Toast. My dining partners got eggs benedict and a monte cristo. Everything was the same for me - good, not phenomenal. That makes me sound like an entitled prick, but when you wait an hour during a down time just to order your food, you kind of want it to taste like a combination of Fergie and Jesus.\n\nOnce inside, you are squished between other people in line, customers already at their tables, and servers hustling around. It's the definition of stuffy, and the servers are far from super-friendly.\n\nBottom line: I did it... and I'll never do it again.

My friend and arrived at 10am and the line was as we expected, about 50 people deep, not too bad. I typically don't like to be negative about service and reserve my reviews to talk about the food, but I have to make an exception for this experience. The line moves slowly mainly because the staff doesn't understand how to prioritize guests based on their party size, i.e. they made us wait behind a group of 4 to be seated before seating us at an open two top table...WTF. It was that kind of nonsense that created unnecessary waiting, whereas most restaurants will try to seat people as tables become available based on the size of their party. \n\nOther than that the food is good, not great. Oh I should mention once you make it inside you have to order at the counter, so take that time in line to make your meal decisions. \n\nLast tip.

It looked and tasted exactly how I imagined. It had smoked salmon, capers, leeks and some kind of creamy sauce drizzled on it. I wish the salmon pieces were a little bigger but that's just the fatass in me speaking. Co-worker had the french toast sampler and she devoured that shiz, dessert for breakfast!

I would have ordered the monte carlo but I thought that it wouldn't be served until 11am (according to their website), but saw the table next to mine having some. The carrot cake came out immediately and I ate that right away. It was very delicate, moist, borderline too rich/sweet, but delicious. My omelette was good, but nothing mind-blowing.

The bacon was crisp and tomato fresh as well as that fresh baked English muffin. The potatoes were seasoned and crisped to perfection definitely an A1 dish. The French toast was very average the single item that saved this dish was the homemade raspberry jam, I wanted to pack up jar and take it home. I also had the smoothie, fresh and full of berries but a bit too much ice that made it watery.\n\n    Overall I would definitely reccomended this place! It has unique and signature flavors that you just can't get anywhere else.

I'm not usually a huge fan of sweet brunch items, but after seeing their french toast mentioned in all the other Yelp reviews, we just had to try it. The bread is more of a pouncake-texture and comes with fruit inside (the banana walnut was amazing), and a generous helping of fresh fruit and syrup. \n\nThankfully we had squeezed in a 3-mile run in the morning because we demolished everything. #sorrynotsorry\n\np.s.

I would have liked a little more cheese, but that's the only complaint. Solid potatoes and very very good buttered rye bread.\nLemon blueberry french toast - a special for the day, and special it was. Not gooey or sticky, but a nice crust on one side from its time on the griddle, and sweet and flavorful from the fruity quick bread they used. Much better than soaking up normal day-old bread. When topped with maple syrup and their house raspberry preserves, it was a complete winner.\n\nI actually wasn't terribly impressed with the pastries we got outside - even after they were heated up. The banana nut bread was very dry (I am used to a denser, moister variety), the chocolate crumb cake was fine, and the broiche roll thing with the German sounding name was pretty decent. \n\nAll in all, a long but delicious experience.", "author": "David B."}

Obviously I can't answer for everyone, but here is why Mama's truly does rock...\n\nFamily owned & operated since day one.  \n\nThe owner actually grows some of the produce & herbs they use in his own backyard.  \n\nThey themselves bake some of the dreamiest bread you'll ever have in your life; which you can also have made into french toast.  The kugeluph brioche, the cranberry orange walnut bread, the banana bread...all house made & all heaven.  \n\nThe pancakes deserve major attention, too.  If the apple cinnamon pancakes are available as a special, order them.  They're AMAZING.  Trust me.  I'm not usually a fan of apple anything...\n\n...except for the pan dore french toast here.  This dish is totally worth the calories, & a cavity.  Baguette french bread sliced horizontally ever so thin, both saut\u00e9ed in & then topped w the most amazing lemon, apple, & butter sauce.  You don't even want to know how much butter goes into this dish.  But like I said, it's totally worth it.\n\nThe bran muffins.  House made.  These are not your grandma's bran muffins.  They are extraordinary.  They will change your opinion of bran muffins forever.\n\nThe house made jam.  Apricot is my favorite, but all of them are great.  Seriously.\n\nThe Monte Cristo.  Period.  Dipped in their jam...de-effin-licious. \n\nBetween the dungeness crab omelette & benedict, the salmon benedict, the corned beef hash, the slim joe burger, all the baked goodness, & the pancakes & french toast, what more could you want?  \n\nGo as early as you can.  Preferably before they open.  If you're not there in line already @ 8:00, it's an hour & a half wait...minimum.  Yes, MINIMUM.  Even longer on weekends.  So grab someone you love, a coffee, a paper, & just get comfortable.  I suggest someone you love, because then the wait will go faster.  \n\nThere has been a line outside Mama's for decades.  And there's no sign of it going anywhere.  Mama's is a breakfast tradition, a neighborhood tradition, a family tradition, a weekend tradition, a San Francisco tradition.  It's just tradition.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-14", "description": "Oh my god. Seriously the best brunch I've ever had and at such a reasonable price too! Friends and I had just finished volunteering during an early morning shift in SF and we were looking for a place to grab breakfast; saw Mama's on Yelp--the comforting name of \"mama\" wooed us to adventure forth into SF and find out about Mama's!\n\nParking was definitely a bit difficult since it's SF and all, but there are ample streets all around the place so you're bound to find a place at some point. \n\nThe line is just as bad as the reviews say they are. We got there around 9:30 and got in around 11:15 a.m. Definitely a place you don't want to go to on a busy day--treat Mama's as luxury for leisurely days. The line was insane, but go with a group of friends and time passes by pretty quickly. One slight downside is that once you get in, you wait in yet another line--but that at least gives you the time you need to figure out your orders and pay! By the way, cash only!\n\nWe got a total of four dishes and split them for maximum joy. We ordered:\n\nChocolate Cinnamon French Toast: Heaven. Besides its beautiful presentation--chocolate drizzled on the plate and toast and garnished with fresh fruits, this was the best french toast I've ever had! Super soft and chocolately. They give you some syrup but the flavor is rich enough that you won't need it.\n\nMonte Cristo: Basically a grilled cheese but fancier and with ham embedded. They serve this with a salad--we got a Spring Salad, pretty normal, and their homemade jam! You MUST try their jam! There's a jar on the table so even if you don't get a meal with the jam, definitely give it a shot! It's a strawberry flavor and despite the sweet/salty combo, it compliments the Monte Cristo quite well! Soft and delish. I wouldn't actually be able to eat the whole thing though since it could be overwhelming, so sharing is a great option.\n\nSalmon Smoked Eggs: I will never eat normal scrambled eggs again. Coming from an Asian family, I've always been really picky about my eggs in American dining because they always feel undercooked to me. These eggs were perfectly cooked and had smoked salmon! How can you not like smoked salmon?! Phenomenal. It comes with a bagel and cream cheese, although I'd personally suggest you slather their jam on your bagel instead. :)\n\nMama's Children's Favorite Omelette: Meh. I'm not an omlette person. Friends got it cause they liked it. I'm an egg person. I can say that the egg is pretty well cooked though? Also comes with a slice of sourdough bread--SLATHER THE JAM. THE JAM IS GREAT!\n\nMama's Smoothies: Definitely a very healthy smoothie with fresh ingredients. Not exactly worth the five dollars though, but it's decent! Berries, orange juice, yogurt and honey!\n\nWaiters are extremely nice and the decor of the restaurant has this great homey feel. They decorate the place with all the awards they've gotten and cute very vintage photos and posters and it honestly does feel like home. Go with friends so you can sample more! The wait is definitely painful, but for a once in awhile brunch place, the wait is definitely worth it!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

There were already a few people waiting in line, all very merry and talkative despite the freezing weather and painfully early hour. \n\nThe atmosphere is really cozy, and even the people who dine here are friendly. Awards are literally everywhere. You order first and then decide where you want to sit. I got the Monte Cristo, my friend had the California omelet, and we shared the French toast sampler. The omelet was so-so, but I loved the Monte Cristo! The melted gruyere and ham on crunchy bread was perfect, and you could get an additional blast of sweetness by dipping it into the jam. The French toast sampler was made of varying degrees of tastiness. I liked the citrus-flavored toast, but everything else was average. \n\nOverall, nice experience and atmosphere.

Apparently we arrived at the perfect time because we found a park right across the street *SCORE* and there was only about five people in line so the wait was minimal, 20 minutes at best! All the pastries they have look so tempting while you wait to order your food. I went with the carrot cake with cream cheese on top and my hubby got the apple crumb cake both tasted amazing but I'll just speak for myself. The carrot cake was so good, the cream cheese on top almost looked like a stomach ache waiting to happen because there's so much cream on top but when you bite into a piece it's really pretty light almost like it's whipped. If you like carrot cake you won't be disappointed at all! I ordered an Washington Square omelette with avocado and mushrooms. The combination of veggies with the Italian sausage made it pretty flavorful and I loved that they weren't stingy with the cheese or the avocado! My hubby ordered the Monte Cristo which I guess is a fan favorite, he said it was really good but not as good as the one at Disneyland (if you've ever had it). I gotta tell you if you've never been here and you're standing in the long line wondering if it's worth the wait, YES it is. You won't be disappointed and although the seating area seems it fairly small it's not uncomfortable but who focuses on space when their food is ON POINT!!  Before I leave though I do want to mention that the customer service is excellent! There's nothing like good food and GREAT service! Enjoy!", "author": "Qiana P."}

ANY sign up sheet is better than what MAMA'S system currently is. The wait to eat here is unbearable and not worth it AT ALL. TOO overhyped and I felt like a sucker for waiting over an hour to eat mediocre food. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the food here isn't disgusting but it isn't revolutionary as well. It's one of those typical hipster breakfast spots that people with big wallets who don't appreciate diners go to. But if you still insist on getting this hipster style of cooking, you can EASILY get it at other restaurants in the Bay, such as La Note and Venus, but with better quality and shorter waits. For example, La Note adds garlic to their potatoes which adds great flavor. Not here, nope! Potatoes were not even crispy. For two people, I paid over 40 and this was just for breakfast alone (the French Toast sampler and Eggs Benedict). \n\nTldr: The wait here is too long and the food here is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT. I will definitely not come back here and wait in that ridiculous line for another second.\n\nYou have been warned.

Probably 45 minutes to an hour. Doesn't matter how early you get there, although I like to get here around 7AM. Regardless, THE WAIT IS WORTH IT. TRUST ME. \n\nThe best breakfast and one of the best meals of my entire life. Prices aren't the cheapest for a breakfast joint but the few extra dollars are worth spending for the high quality and fresh ingredients. \n\nMy two favourite dishes are the Eggs Benedict Florentine and the Our Famous Monte Cristo. Its hard to choose which one I like better, honestly. Also, while a bit pricey, the freshly squeezed orange juice is TO DIE FOR. The lemonade is pretty fantastic as well. \n\nAs for the staff, they have never been anything but wonderful. They are kind to both the customers and each other. Our waiter, who has been our waiter each time we have went, is absolutely amazing. He is nice, kind, funny, prompt, and even helpful. He suggested eating the jam(which is flippin great, if I may add) with the french toast to our friend. Now, our friend is a big syrup advocate, but, because of this suggestion, ate his entire plate of french toast only with jam and skipped the syrup entirely. He was almost in tears! \n\nOverall, Mama's is probably one of the best, if not the best, meals I've ever had. I'm always going to go back whenever I'm in The City. I know Mama's is quite famous  and sometimes famous places can be a bit disappointing and overrated. This is NOT the case for Mama's. Mama's is beyond perfection.

I want to rave about the Monte Cristo because it's such a unique and delicious dish that is so central to what makes Mama's.. Mama's! I would describe it as a little sweet tweak to the perfectly warm ham and cheese sandwich. The softness of the bread, the sweet berry taste and texture of the jam, and the savory taste of the ham and cheese create a beautiful harmony. \n\nThis is definitely a breakfast joint to check out in order to \"experience\" a bit of San Francisco! \n\nTry not to come in big groups because their seating is limited and you'll likely have to wait for half the restaurant to clear up.", "author": "Jane S."}

Everyone says to get the famous monte cristo and the Dungeness crab omelette and I decided to try the monte cristo because the crab omelette was like 24.99. Really?!\n\n1. Appearance 5/10 - it's like 540 sq ft with only like 6-9 tables this explains the long line (waited close to an hour or more). The tables and chairs are old fashioned and the decoration was terrible no offense. It looked like grandmas house painted yellow. Honestly if your running a business this small. Please consider patio chairs and tables outside or at least benches for customers to sit on.\n\n2. Customer Service 7/10 - The hostess was okay. She didn't smile a lot and wasn't a good talker either. The cashier was friendly he asked me how we found out about the place and where we came from which was also nice. The waitress was ok she greeted us but wasn't really good on conversations. \n\n3. Food 7/10 - The monte cristo is 2 ham, turkey, egg and cheese toasted sandwich cut into pieces of four and you get a choice of side- salad or like hash browns or something and it comes with a jelly jam dip on the side oh yeah it's sprinkled with powdered sugar. This was okay. The bite of it was very flavorful but honestly I can make this myself.

They were nice enough to let us in after they were technically closed at 3:05pm on Saturday (though there were still tables in there finishing their meals), though.\n\nWhile the bread was soft, and did have a good texture that was moist but not to the point of being spongy and still broke apart just easily enough without being too crumbly, I found its consistency a little oily. I thought the cranberry was just too powerful and tart - it may be just my personal thing that I don't like cranberry too much, but I've had it in other breads where it's more dried and the flavor isn't as intense. In the bread here the cranberry has retained a lot of its moistness and therefore that overwhelmingly tart - no, not tart.

This is my second time coming here because the first time I was just not going to wait in the never ending line, but this time me and my friend decided we were going to wait it out and see what it was that everyone was talking about. Let me add on that we were in line for 2 hours.... Let me repeat 2 hours of standing outside waiting eat brunch. The line really barely moves... So after waiting for 2 hours, it was finally our turn to come in and order food. Whoever was at the cash register was taking her sweet time, packing someone's to go order, talking to her coworkers, and just not really into the whole let me take your order thing. \n\nWe decided that since the wait was so long we had to try multiple things because we weren't going to be coming back here for awhile. So we got the eggs florentine and added sausage, the Washington square omelette, the monte cristo, chocolate crumble cake, lemonade, and berry smoothie. The total for all this was around $55.00. Not bad, but a bit pricey for brunch. \n\nWhen we were served the food, they brought us the chocolate crumble cake first and so we tried that first. This was very warm and rich with chocolate. For my taste way to sweet, but pretty tasty. Then we were served the rest of our food. I had the eggs florentine which was the typical eggs Benedict, nothing special at all. My friend had the Washington square omelette, which he also wasn't impressed much with. Then we shared the monte cristo which I liked the most. The thing is the food was good, but it's not something that I couldn't make for myself at home.\n\nAlso I tried other brunch places in the city prior to this one such as Kitchen Story and Sweet Maple and I would say I was more impressed with what I ate there. The foods presentation was much better and there was nothing close to the wait that I stood out here. \n\nOverall the food here was good, just not worth the wait for 2 hours whatsoever.

The food I would say it's worth 4 stars but because of the wait i decided to give it a 3 stars for the whole experience.\n\nHere is the breakdown of what we ordered:\n\n-The coffee and the latte were pretty bad. Tasteless to say the least. \n-The monte Cristo was really good. Specially with the jam. It just made the sandwich perfect. \n-The crab Benedict was just average or actually might be a little below average for the price (26.75). The actually Benedict sauce was not that good.\n-the French toast platter was good but not great. No wow factor at all. \n\nService overall was good. The waiter has a good sense of humor and they are very friendly and attentive.", "author": "Nicole H."}

The French toast they use is like a poundcake-esque type of bread that is soft and fluffy. I usually like a little crunch, but the flavor and texture make up for it.

I took a bite of the Monte Cristo, man that was delicious! It's good! I also like the french toast, they use the yummy bread to make it and the jam is such a great addition to it.

This deterred me from ordering the cranberry orange and the french toast sampler. We ordered the Kugelhopf french toast and the breakfast sandwich. My Kugelhopf came with 3 slices and the taste just didn't wow me. The bread was thin so it didn't have much texture in each bite. I had to use more syrup and butter then I usually would to add more taste. The breakfast sandwich was pretty good. It had Canadian bacon, an over easy egg and melted cheese.

It's basically a french toast sandwich, with turkey, ham, and cheese in between. It is good I won't deny that. But for the wait we had, I expected more.  Bf wanted to get the eggs benedict, but we got so hungry from waiting in line that he got the omelette since it looked bigger. It was yummy but again, not impressed.\n\nDRINKS - After a long wait we wanted a drink. On the menu outside of the door, it said Mimosa for $7.95 and Screwdriver for $6.50. So we ordered the screwdriver and it came in a cute jam can. Now, I don't drink a lot of alcohol, but I tasted no alcohol and it was basically just orange juice! I told our waitress this and she said she can give me a mimosa instead, but that's not what I wanted. I just wanted to drink a bit of something since the wait was so long! Tryna scam me for a more expensive drink? But when we got the bill, we got charged $7 each for our screwdrivers. I told her it was $6.50 on the menu but she said \"No all our alcoholic drinks are $7.\" Uhhh.. well then you should charge me what's written on the menu!\n\nOVERALL - Expectations for this place were not met, so I'm not coming back.

At least you'll have enough time while waiting in the long lines to run off to an ATM to grab yourself some cash. \n\nThe way Mama's works is that you wait in line outside and they slowly let people into the restaurant where you can see the chefs at work. This is where you can get a look at their specialty menu and order your food but it'll be another 10 minutes before you're seated and yet another 10-15 minutes before you get your food.

There's a 4-step waiting process which is a terrible system for them\n(1) You wait outside\n(2) You wait inside to order your food at the cashier \n(3) You wait for a table to be cleared out which can either be quick if you're lucky or awhile which is what happened for me\n(4) You're finally seated at a table, but now, you wait for your food to arrive which w/ the monte cristo, it took the longest to prepare\n\nAfter all that, it took 2 hrs to get our food (2:30p). I ordered the Famous Monte Cristo & was really excited to try out this dish. Disappointed..skimpy one slice of meats & cheeses between 3 thick battered pieces if bread; I was expecting a lot more. I didn't use the homemade jam b/c berry jams always taste too artificial for me personally, so I ended up using Tobasco which made the meal for me.\n\nOverall, for its hype, it was a letdown. I would not come here again for a 2hr+ wait. However, it's jst one of those places that everyone has to check out one time", "author": "Trina N."}

But really, mentally prepare yourself for a solid 1.5 hours in line, even on weekdays. I might recommend waking up early to beat the rush, but from what I hear, the line starts forming around 7:30AM, so there really is no escape.\n\nI got the grilled chicken sandwich, but only because I couldn't get the Monte Cristo. Note: They can't make any substitutions (i.e. taking out ham) from this dish, which is heartbreaking for folks that don't eat ham because this one looked, smelled, and supposedly tasted incredible. But back to what I actually ate, the chicken was more tender than just about any grilled chicken sandwich I've ordered anywhere, so that's a big time plus. The sandwich overall is solid, but the bread is a little too challenging for my liking. \n\nWhat puts this place at 5 stars for me is their incredible french toast. I got the french toast sampler platter so that I could get a taste of as many as possible without having to wait in that line weekend after weekend, and man does that dish deliver. They were all excellent, but the Cranberry orange was my personal favorite. So much flavor! Loved it. They actually use fancy and fresh breads as the base, which I haven't seen anywhere else before. The jam that they have on the table is also fantastic, and allowed me to survive my starvation while waiting for the food to arrive.\n\nCheck this place out!", "author": "Madhur B."}

I don't think I've ever waited for Mama's breakfast this long before, but regardless of our 2 hour wait, it was all worth it in the end. \n\nI have tried the Dungeness Crab and Spinach Benedict - probably the best crab benedict I have ever had. Smoked Salmon Benedict - the smoked salmon is so delicious. French Toast Sampler - I would say my favorite of the three options is the banana walnut french toast. The Washington Square M'Omlette - savory and delicious. All of the breakfast options are served with a side of house potatoes and house jam. Honestly everything I've tried on the menu is cooked and crafted to perfection. But overall I think the dish that really wins my heart is the Dungeness Crab and Spinach Benedict. \n\nThey also have a nice selection of breakfast drinks - soju screwdrivers, bellini's, mimosas, and bloody marys.\n\nI don't understand how Mama's does it, they have the ability to make food so delicious that people are willing to wait 2 hours just to have a taste of the food!

We came to the restaurant at around 10:30 AM, thinking that it would be worth it to stand in the 2 hour long line because everyone says this is the best brunch spot in all of San Francisco. So we waited.\n\nWe ordered the Veggie omelet with goat cheese, peppers, mushrooms; the French Toast Sampler (special) with cranberry, orange, cinnamon nut toasts and fruit; a slice of the carrot cake; a piece of the old-fashioned crumble cake. \n\nEverything was average at best, though the prices were very affordable and reasonable. The omelet was tasty, but nothing special. The french toast sampler had some hit and some misses-- I loved the cranberry flavors, but the cinnamon and more nuttier bread sample wasn't as tasty. The carrot cake was great but I would have loved it to be a bit warmer and a bit moister/softer. The old-fashioned crumble cake was good, but not the best I've had by any means.\n\nMy overall verdict is that it is an extremely average, standard brunch place with a standard menu and standard portion sizes. My issue is that nothing tasted special, unique, or different. My friend and I both agreed that the place was definitely overrated and that we expected a lot more, especially after waiting for 2 hours.", "author": "Roopa S."}

The home made raspberry jam is nice but it won't change your life. \n\nMy beef is with management, specifically Mr. Sanchez who was hosting today.  I am highly insulted that after waiting in your line for 90 minutes you snuck what I can only assume are some dear friends of your family in the back door and sat them next to us (along with the two toddlers they had in tow).   \n\nI waited in line to give you my money so I expect you to manage your wait list with full integrity.

I asked my boyfriend if he would be willing to stand in line for 2 hours. He told me to gtfo and said there were other places that served food faster and tasted better. I shook my head and scoffed at him, thinking what does he know? He just consumes food and doesn't taste it.\n\nSo beginning of March, I dragged my boyfriend here, promising him that the line won't be long, if we get there early. We came about 10 minutes before the restaurant opened. There was already a long line. It took about an hour and 30 minutes before we came inside. \n\nI ordered the Monte Cristo, while my boyfriend ordered the banana pancakes. We also ordered fresh squeezed orange juice. We both got our juice and I stared at the cups..... $3 for this small cup with no ice?! I grumbled and drank it, taking the ice cubes from my water cup and dropping it in the oj.\n\n I was disappointed in the Monte cristo, which tasted like a grilled cheese sandwich with ham to me. Only good part was the jam. The potatoes that came along with it were bland. I forced myself to eat almost of it, since I was hungry from waiting.\n\nOverall, this place was ok. The wait is no fun, and I'm giving this 3 stars for the service and the fact that my boyfriend ate all of his banana pancakes.

It doesn't matter what time of day you try to come, there will be at least about a hour wait. It's a very small cafe. The way it works is that you order and pay, then get seated at a open table. But is the wait worth it?\n\nService:\nThe service here is so-so. They don't give you a sense of welcome. They didn't smile when they took your order. They didn't even greet you. They honestly just get down to business. They'll take how many people in your party, then take your order, then take your cash. \n\nThe highlight of our service was the busboy. Although, he had broken english, he actually tried to strike up conversation! Loved it! \n\n\n\nFood:\nCrab Benedict - Good. But it wasn't amazing. They served it with fresh crab meat on lightly toasted english muffins. The favor profiled meshed well, but it's been done to death by other restaurants as well. \n\nMonte Cristo - French toast stuffed with cheese and ham. I'm not a big fan of sweet and salty, but I did enjoy this dish. The homemade raspberry jam is a must for this dish. The sweet and the salty blended beautifully. \n\nCoffee Cake - Better than your average coffee cake.

I ordered the apple pan dore, which the menu describes as \"slices of sourdough baguette (good ol' Boudin) with saut\u00e9ed apples in lemon butter sauce\" for $9.25. Not too hefty for hip brunch in SF, but not cheap either. \n\nWhile waiting in line though, you get to watch the cooks and see the delicious baked goods and ingredients they use-which truly look amazing quality and make your mouth water.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-26", "description": "(Skip to the bottom for my final verdict)\n\nSF takes their brunch seriously, and so do I. That is the only reason I endured circling around the area for 40 min looking for street parking, only to pay to park in a parking lot near chinatown, and then proceed to wait outside Mama's for another hour and 20 minutes. \n\nAfter waiting a total of 2 hours, we finally stepped into the quaint cafe furnished with plenty of homey knick knacks that you would find in your grandma's kitchen or living room. I adored the fresh flowers at each table and really appreciated the openness of the cafe. There were large windows that allowed plenty of natural lighting to spill through and light up the restaurant. \n\nInstead of being seated first, we were directed to order at the window first and then were allowed to pick from any open tables. We ordered the blackstone eggs benedict and the french toast sampler. After doing extensive yelping, it seemed like I'd be missing out on not trying the chocolate cinnamon french toast so I asked them to sub the regular cinnamon brioche for the chocolate cinnamon and they were happy to accommodate at no extra cost :) \n\nMama hit my major sweet tooth right on the spot with her delicious french toast. What makes this the best french toast I've ever had is the ridiculously flavorful slices of brioche. Each slice was moist, packed with warm spices, and the cranberry orange and banana nut brioche were studded with walnuts. The shining star of the show had to be the cinnamon french toast. It had the best texture, lightness, and overall flavor. The cinnamon brioche was the best bread for soaking up the french toast egg mixture (in the end the chocolate didn't add much). The banana bread was also delicious but slightly denser. The cranberry orange french toast was my least favorite but still better than any I've tried. \n\nDunk the french toast in syrup or do yourself a flavor and slather on a bit of the blackberry jam sitting innocently on your table. It wasn't too sweet and had a very bright berry flavor (I'd imagine it'd go amazing with a meyer lemon scone mmm). If you're not too careful, you could end up chugging the whole jar on the spot. \n\nThe eggs benedict were pretty customary, but too salty for my taste. I'm not much of a savory breakfast person so I'm biased but my friend said they were good, not amazing. We also ordered the old fashioned bar and a slice of carrot cake to go. The carrot cake fell short for me because it wasn't exceptional in any way and didn't have a cream cheese frosting but a rather plain buttercream frosting. The old fashioned was just average for me as well. It had an ok crumb topping but not really worth trying. \n\nWe received excellent and friendly service from everyone including the busboys! I never felt rushed during the meal and our water glasses were always filled. A busser was even kind enough to box my food and pack up some jam for me :) \n\nThe price for breakfast was fairly reasonable, about $10 or so a plate. However, the price for pastries that didn't blow my mind was somewhat stiff. \n\nFinal verdict: \nAll you french toast fanatics out there, this will now be our official congregation spot, 10 minutes or 2 hours, rain or shine. Everyone else, not really worth waiting more than 30 minutes in line for! I would also save my money for pastries elsewhere. Heads up, Mama's only takes debit cards, no credit!!!\n\nIf Mama's didn't have such a long wait I would come back for brunch every time I was in the city!\n\nP.S.

I needed to add ketchup and tabasco to give this more flavor.\n-Another egg dish which i don't remember, it was tasty but nothing memorable.\n\nFor 2 people, I think the bill came to about $50 which seems very steep for brunch for me. \n\nI heard the owner talk about opening up a second Mama's in the area of a place that used to be a grocery store, so maybe that will help with the lines. I'll probably come back to try the Monte Cristo since that's what everybody raves about, but only if there's no line.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

Expect to wait 2 hours to get into the place and get seated.\n\nWe got here around 8:30 in the morning and the line was mehh not too bad. The first round of people had been seated so ultimately we were waiting for those people to get their food, eat, and get out of there. We waited about 1.5 hours outside the restaurant. The time really flew by, the weather was beautiful, and there are bakeries around (as noted in other reviews) where you can grab some coffee and/or a pastry while waiting in line. The line inside only took us about 10 minutes and you get to sit there and watch the chefs cook.\n\nWe got the crab benedict and I opted to try something different than reviews raved about and got the Salmon scramble. It was light, filling, and full of the perfect amount of flavor. The portion sizes were on the smaller side for the pricing, but when you're as big of a tourist trap as this place, I guess you can get away with charging whatever you want. \n\nIt is definitely worth stopping into and trying. I can't say I'd go here ALL the time, but I'm glad we went and had the Mama's experience.\n\nBRING CASH.

I don't know how to review this without pissing off the die-hard fans and still be honest with my reviews, so here it goes. \n\nOverhyped... Monte Cristo - an exotic name for an odd tasting savory french toast... I don't know why people rave about it.  It contains hammed turkey and cheese (cheddar), then dipped in egg and fried like a french toast.  The cheese was strong and overwhelming.  I think it would have tasted better had they use something else instead of cheddar.  Cheddar is cheap and too strong a flavor.  Their Dungeonous crab egg benedict was good with real crab meat, but it was also $22.. So you really paid for what you get.  Overall, I think this place will continue to do well, simply because of their touristy location and they have a few interesting items.  If you don't believe what I say about the Monte Cristo, then try it for yourself.  Just make sure you order something else as a back up too.\n\nWe waited for an hour to get inside.  Once inside, we waited in another line for 15 minutes to order and pre-pay.  Once seated, that was when we got excellent service.  The waitress and the coffee guy were friendly and attentive.  This business does not accept credit cards.  They only accept cash or debit (with a $1 fee).  \n\nNOTE:  Order anything, except the Monte Cristo - unless you like strong flavor cheese  with savory turkey meat and sweet jam.  The strong flavored cheese wrecked my taste pallet for the day. \n\nI don't hate the place.. I also don't love the place.", "author": "Duke D."}

Probably not.\n\nWith a lot of places, the hype is what drives people to wait for food (or anything really). I guess after an hour of waiting and all this hype, I had expected more. However, I do love how the restaurant sticks to its quaint, family owned-style. Unfortunately, the prices do not really stick to its roots...for me, this place was a little more on the plus side, especially for any breakfast items that contains crab. I didn't try any of the dungeness crab benedict, but I saw it and for the amount of crab you're getting and the price you're paying, I didn't think it would be worth it (even though according to others  it is).\n\n1. French toast sampler: I liked how they used different bread for the different french toasts. I thought it was pretty good, but I liked the maple syrup even better. \n2. Washington Square Omelet: Goodness, was this delicious. I usually never like ordering omelets because i feel like it's too much at times, but boy was this one on point. If I come back, I'm definitely trying more of their omelets. \n3. Monte Cristo: Good, but not anything to rave about. However, it could be because I've only tried one monte cristo at one other place before.\n\nHowever, don't get the wrong idea, I thought that the food was fresh, and delicious, but just not worth the wait!", "author": "Annie N."}

First of all, we got there early and the line wasn't too bad, until all of the people that had others waiting in line FOR them showed up. Thankfully we just made the first seating. We ordered the coffee cake to share, the Blackstone Benedict for me and I don't even remember what J ordered. We drank our coffee. We waited and we waited. We ate the coffee cake.The couple who ordered in front of us finished and we were still waiting. \n\nOut of coffee, and now out of cake as well.\n\nFinally our waiter delivered our food, and I will say he had that \"guilty look\". Everything was COLD. The tomato, the english muffin (soggy too from the tomato sitting too long), even the crispy bacon, COLD. The potatoes, the eggs, and worst of all the hollandaise.\n\n\nNot only was the hollandaise cold, but it was BROKEN! Who serves broken hollandaise???? It was as if it broke, and they tried to fix it by adding more lemon and putting it in a blender. It was much too sour, really gritty and quite frankly, gross.\n \nOur waiter was hiding out and did not come back to check on us. By this time,I felt sick to my stomach and just wanted to leave. I ate only two bites of my breakfast and the waiter said NOTHING. Obviously, we had already paid, so we put the tip on the table and left (I will NOT stiff a waiter, EVER, even when they ___).\n\nThis was the worst breakfast ever.

Definitely not worth waiting 2 plus hours and in the freakin rain!  I got here at 8:25am on a Saturday morning and already the line was up to the middle of the block - thus the 2 hour wait. And they open at 8am!  I think these crazy ppl must line up before they open.  \n\nOrdered the Crab Benedict ($22.50) - presentation looked good, was def made to order w/ fresh crab meat, perfectly oozy poached eggs w/ right amount of hollandaise sauce, BUT overall the dish was quite bland.  Something was missing.  the crab maybe should have been seasoned a little? It had a slight fishy taste. English muffin was standard as well.  At that price, I was expecting it to be WOW.  And they were skimpy on the amount of crab. I've definitely had better benedicts such as Mission Beach Cafe. Extra disappointed as they only serve Crab on the weekends so I was expecting it to be bomb! \n\nAlso ordered their famous Monte Cristo ($10.75) which is a french toast stuffed with a layer of ham & cheese and turkey & cheese. Again this dish was just OK and again BLAND.  I wish it was more eggy. this was just lightly dipped in egg batter because when I sliced into it, you can still see most of the white bread. I guess it is meant to be like this since its a sandwich and not really a french toast? And it was not crispy..at all.  I really think they may have under fried mine. Oh wells. Dish comes with their homemade jam which just makes it sweeter but does not necessarily make it taste better.  Now that i think about it, i should have asked for butter and syrup. \n\nApple Peach Bellini ($7.00) - champagne with apple juice and peach puree. Finally something that was simply GOOD.

My bf and I are in town and we wanted to try good places in SF. We had a few friends recommending the place and so what did I do? I went to my handy dandy Yelp app to help me decide if we should come here or not. Their pictures look really good and their reviews were both good and bad. Being my stubborn self, I wanted to try it for myself and decide on my own.. So.. We did the crazy.. And waited... We waited in line for an hour and a half.. And waited another half to order, be seated and finally get our food.. So took us 2 hours so finally get food in our belly! This didn't bother me though because I did my research and new that there was going to be a wait. \n\nThe food itself.. It was good, but it was like any other \"breakfast\" places out there. We ended up getting the Monte de Cristo.. Which is a turkey (or ham I can't remember) sandwich.. But instead of sandwich it was dipped and cooked in what was like a pancake type batter.. It also came with potatoes and their special jam (wasn't too crazy on the jam) their potatoes were really good! The sandwich was good but not 2 hours wait type of good. My bf decided to get the organically pancakes with seasonal berries. Not going to lie, their pancakes were really good.. But again, not a 2 hr wait worth type of good. \n\nBasically, my tip to you.. If you are not on a time crunch where you are only in town for a couple days and have so much more food to try at other raved about places.. Then come try Mama's.. Their food is legit.. But if you are on a time crunch and want to try other places before you have to leave.. Then try the other places! Most likely more worth your time.

Or it could also just be that I think it's over hyped. We arrived at 9:40 on a tuesday morning and the food came around 12. Yes this was a 2 hour wait. We were beyond hungry then. I feel like if you gave us anything it would have tasted like heaven (okay maybe not everything). The wait is however an expected routine you have to go through but I have to say MAMAs in my opinion was not worth the wait. If it was an hour maybe, but the satisfaction from the food was not worth 2 hours of my time. I love brunch/breakfast so I've been to a lot of places before judging.\n\nAlso parking around here is not a pleasure at all!! there are lots of meters but that means killing your wallet to pay and wait in line because we literally spend most of the time waiting in line than eating. 2 hour wait  maybe 30-40 min eating MAX.\n\nI tried multiple plates of food today which includes\n\nVegetarian Egg Benedict:\nYes vergetarian who would want it right? no meat? well you're wrong! This is amazing!! spinich, tomotal, mushrooms, and avocado may just be one of the BEST benedict I've had here or in general. Even though I said its the best for me, one plate is not satisfying for a 2 hour wait. \n\nBlackstone Benedict:\nIt has crispy bacon and tomaton topped with two poached eggs. It was okay... wasn't that good actually. just tasted like bacon egg and tomoato because the ingredients didn't really like blend and more like you taste them individually. If you want bacon I recommend just getting a side of bacon.\n\nMonte Cristo:\nI myself am not a fan of it at all. The reason though is probably because I don't like grilled cheese sandwiches and this somewhat tasted like it. There ham and cheese in the middle and it's cooked kind of like a french toast. Yes it's salty not sweet, however they give you homemade jam so that you can dip into it. The jam was delicious and I would recommend getting toast on the side to eat with it. I think it's weird to have salty and sweet together like that so I didn't enjoy the combination, but that's me not you so you should try it still.\n\nChocolate Cinnamon French Toast:\nFrench Toast has always been a favorite part of my breakfasts. I can't really judge this because my friend had it. She enjoyed it. I however only had a corner of it but I was not impressed. So pleass don't take my judgment on the french toast to direct. By the time I tried the french toast it was a bit soggy, I didn't really taste the chocolate, and it didn't give me that \"Surprise\" I was expecting to get.\n\nOrange Juice:\nFresh Squeezed orange juice is always yummy, but it's kind of pricey. 4.25 for a cup of OJ.\n\nI've also had other dishes before which are\n\nSalmon Benedict: \nIt can get a little messy because the salmon might fall out of place and stuff. This was yummy except the salmon seems to be a bit too salty for my liking and the sauce is slightly heavy. \n\nSwedish cinnamon French Toast with berries:\nI think this is quite similar to the CCFT but maybe the different timing that I ate it at made a difference because I actually thought this was delicious. So I can't really give you my best opinion on the french toast again I encourage trying the french toast.\n\nI think I've had enough of MAMA's for now.

Even brought us all water while we waited. The manager on the other hand was an ASS. Okay so we had a big group.  5 adults and 3 kids. He demanded not pleaded. Not at all apologetic but demanded that we separate in four. To be clear I asked him \"you're telling me we won't eat together?\" Again. Not one little \"I'm sorry miss but our place is too small for a big group\"  something like that would go a long way. We are paying for the food and service. And to be honest I can make better food at home. \nFood - That was NOT worth the 2 hours wait. The monte Cristo was dry. Pancakes were delicious. My poached egg whites were pretty runny - not cool. It's nasty. It was whatever. And they don't have waffles.  I'd go somewhere that takes reservations. I'm sure I can find a better breakfast spot.\nPiece of advice to the staff.

Fruits taste like they were just plucked off the branch, the fresh baked pastries smell and taste wonderful, and yes, the homemade jam is as good as advertised.  Even the apple juice taste like the way it ought to be, more apple and less juice.\n\nI had the Monte Cristo (turkey breast, baked ham, cheddar and havarti cheese bread dipped in egg and grilled).

The dungeness crab is a tough choice for a protein and it is handled with care it's easy to overwhelm with other flavors.  The crab here is chunky, clean and full of beautiful flavor.  The hollandaise sauce adds a nice buttery citrus blast that really makes it shine.  The eggs were poached perfectly .  The potatoes on the side were very nice.  They had a nice crispness to them along with a very herby flavor.  It really doesn't get much better than this!\n\nChorizo Eggs Benedict - 5 out of 5 - Oh man this is some seriously good chorizo.  It was flavorful, but clean and not greasy.  Its served over tortillas.  The hollandaise was great and really worked with the chorizo, much to my surprise.  I only had it once as it was a special and I haven't seen it in a while, so I hope it comes back soon!\n\nOVERALL\n\nBreakfast is my favorite meal of the day and this is in my top 3 places to go.", "author": "Rob P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-06", "description": "Oh look!  It's Mama's, that restaurant that always has a ridiculous line (even when it's freaking closed) and is on every to-eat list in San Fracisco.  The question for such a restaurant usually boils down to 'is it worth it', to which I typically say 'probaby not, but let's give it a shot'.  Being the kind of person who actually doesn't mind lines all that much (you're probably with friends if it's a restaurant, right?), it becomes about the charm.  The food, the service, the smiles; oh, how Mama's lacks.\n\nFirst things first: the line.  Expect it to be apparently over an hour, especially if you don't feel like getting up early.  And then once inside, you line up to order at a register, your butts in some other eater's faces, themselves cramped into a small table in a tiny restaurant. You eat your food as quickly as you can while the employees and customers outside dog you the whole time - comfortable dining experience?  Meh, who cares when it's all about the food!\n\nMama's Sampler French Toast: Lemon Berry, Banana Nut, Swedish Cinnamon - Covered with Assorted Berries + Bananas 10.95: This dish, meant to be a sampler of the goodness of Mama's, really failed to whet my appetite for future visits.  It looks like a freaking American flag, though there's nothign wrong with that if that was the intention, which I kind of doubt.  And considering the three types of toast are as different as flavor profiles can be, it's odd that three different fruits are dumped on the top of the all of them - acceptable for your mama while at home, but not a restaurant serving alledgedly the best French toast on this coast.  To boot, the toast wasn't all that great; I enjoyed the fruit more.\n\nNorthern Italian - Pancetta (Italian Cured Bacon) , Mushrooms, Fresh Basil, Tomatoes, and Garlic Jack Cheese $10.95: Considering everything, this actually wasn't that bad of an omelette, except that the bacon completely ruined the it.  The crispy crunch really doesn't help the consistency or give it an interesting texture, instead distracting you from the rest of the gooey soft goodness, making you think 'who the hell put that in here?'  It'd probably be a decent dish if they used something a bit softer, say, a more stereotypically Italian sausage?  You can evaluate for yourself what the bread and orange were like based on the picture (not great...), the potatoes were, well potatoes.  It's a good portioning for that - enough to make you happy but not enough to be the main course.\n\nSo, Mama's.  The prices seem appropriate for San Francisco as far as the food goes, but $7 for a screwdriver at a mom and pop shot seems a tad steep - what goes in here, Kettle One?  I normally feel bad ragging on what might be a family business, but as this one's just raking in publicity and money, I'll just stay what my friends told me before I visited: Mama's is a busy restaurant that's busy only due to hype, and not much more.", "author": "Christopher P."}

So after what seemed like a long awhile, the line started building up. Then the fun began. Tourists walked up to us to ask, What are you guys in line for? When we told them it was for brunch at Mama's, they replied: \"We would NEVER wait 2 hrs for food in Amsterdam muAHahaha.\" Then after another forever, the friends that just woke up started to join their friends at the front of the line, adding another 30minute to the wait.

The monte cristo was delicious, it's like a sealed french toast sandwich with ham and turkey. The homemade jam is very yummy too. The crab benedict was okay, but that's because I'm not into hollandaise sauce and there simply is not enough crab for me. If you like that kind of thing, go for it! It's also a bit pricey.

The line is a standing line only (no texting/waitlist), so you should come with someone you're comfortable talking to for 2 hours.\n\nWhile the food at Mama's is by no means bad, it is not as good or innovative as most other brunch spots in San Francisco.

This was a unique experience, and the better dish of the two.\n\n- French Toast Sampler ($11.25): This comes with a slice each of the Cranberry-Orange, Banana Walnut, and one other that did not have much distinctive flavor. I enjoyed the Cranberry-Orange best. The toast really is nothing very special (the ingredients are all pre-made into the bread, which is on display in the glass case when you order), and I don't think it's any better than a toast I could make at home.\n\nDespite mediocre food, the raspberry jam that is at every table is fantastic.

Again, not a huge deal, but there wasn't a sign either. \n\nI'm short, so I couldn't see most of the menu which is posted on the walls next to the cash register and above the grills.

When I received the coffee, there was no half and half and the coffee was burnt. Or it was probably maxwell house, which has the same horrible flavor. It comes in a tiny mug, which bothered me at first because you can get a cheaper black, drip coffee from most chains.  The omelet came with tons of cheese though I specified for a small amount. The egg omelet portion was dry. The potatoes that came with the dish were too oily. \n\nThe best part about the meal was the apple crumble --which was absolutely delightful-- and the multigrain toast that undoubtedly came from a package. \n\nAnd probably the orange slice garnish. \n\nI think this place does sweet pretty well, but needs a little more assistance with the savory.

We took advantaged that we were still on east coast time and woke up at like 6:30AM, showered and out the door by 7:15AM.  We got in line around 7:30AM with just a few people ahead of us.  \n\nThe doors opened promptly at 8AM and we were the last ones in before they cut the line off.  The restaurant is so small with no more than probably 20 seats, that they constantly have a line outside. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 and I seriously love to brunch (or just eat in general) and ordered enough food for a small family of 4, but hey- when in Rome? Anyways, we quickly scanned the menu and ordered the 2 farm eggs any style, scrambled with bacon, the Cranberry-Orange French Toast and the Monte Cristo.  \n\nI absolutely loved the French Toast, you could taste all the cranberry and orange bits inside every bite. It didn't even need any syrup; it was just sweet enough alone. I liked that It wasn't just cranberry and orange slices piled on top, but baked inside it already. \n\nThe Monte Cristo was interesting.  It is essentially a turkey, ham and cheese sandwich that has been battered and grilled.  The combination with the gruyere cheese inside makes it melt in your mouth soft with a slight crisp from the grill on the outside.  Add on their home-made jam and syrup, it really is a delicious sandwich with a perfect sweet/salty combo.  I was impressed that the sandwich was built so well, it was not sloppily put together and battered and held up its shape just fine for handling and dripping into the jam. \n\nThe only odd thing is the bathroom.  I peeked around the corner of the kitchen and asked a man where the restroom was.  He pointed a door that opened up to the back side of the place.  I was a little confused and initially thought it was trying to be funny and was kidding.  I followed his instructions.  I walked through the small kitchen, through the door and was outside.  On my left was this make-shift tiny bathroom outside. \n\nAnyways, I am so glad I woke the fianc\u00e9 up that early because by the time we were out of there around 10, the line was so long up the block!   Advice (an oblivious one too): Come early and come hungry!\n\nHonestly, it did live up to the hype.  I think if I had to wait over an hour in line though, that definitely would have tinted the Mama's experience.

Would the food at this restaurant really be worth the wait? In my opinion it was. Wait aside, the restaurant although rather small was cozy. The ordering process was simple: stand in line first and then get seated. Since they have an open kitchen, you could view all the items being prepared and pick one that you would enjoy. I chose the egg white scramble and added salmon to it. The salmon was smoked and tasted so fresh and paired well with the egg white. The vegetables were clearly saut\u00e9ed in the preparation process and had a ton of flavor, but were not as tart as when they are eaten raw (a good thing for this dish). The grilled potatoes were also the perfect texture. The outside was crispy and the inside was a bit soft.

The smoked salmon was definitely delicious, you can tell the salmon is fresh and plenty of it on the benedict (aka not stingy with the portions) we asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side, which was a really smart idea because our bread didn't get soggy! It isn't the best smoke salmon benedict I've tried, but it's probably one of the best options on their menu. The French toast on the other hand was nothing special. It was lame, it came with 3 slices of regular thin bread. The bread was nothing special, it was not crunchy, totally soggy and tasted like something I could make at home! And we added fresh fruit for an extra $2... (We tried Mymy coffee down the street the next day, and we compared French toast, and Mymy definitely have better, crunchy, thick, free fresh fruit, and just right French toast then this place--and NO WAIT!) This French toast was below par, I guess people around here haven't eaten out in LA for brunch. LA definitely have the best French toast at Blu Jam Caf\u00e9. Comparing LA to Mama's, definitely wasn't worth that wait. The Bloody Mary that we ordered was good, but was realllllly spicy at the end...

He gave us an overview of some of their popular items and made recommendations. The house baked breads for French toast are made daily - so fresh!

I was excited to see listings of vegetarian-friendly items! Major points! My friend and I ordered several items and shared... Mama's French Toast with fresh fruit = yum! (Note - you must get the fresh fruit or seasonal berries!) Mama's Benedict - specifically the one titled 'Vegetarian' - w/ saut\u00e9ed mushrooms (not overpowering), avocado, baby spinach and grilled tomato = DELICIOUS! The poached eggs were perfect.

Granted it was 12pm in the middle of the week (psst hint hint for those who don't like waiting in lines). Service was quick and very polite. The kind waitress briefly refused service to us saying that they only served parties of 2. Of course she was kidding, otherwise we would have been pretty bummed out lol. The big Mama's Cristo, not to be confused with their famous Monte Cristo, was my pick of the day. Served on a plate that screams colorful brunch, the four cuts of the sandwich, placed with slices of orange and strawberry, potato salad, and their delicious jam in the middle. The sandwich was grilled to perfection. And topped with their jam, an absolutely terrific brunch for a 15 minutes wait.

Getting there at 7:30am on a weekday is the safest way to make sure you don't wait more than 30 minutes. Otherwise, expect to wait 1 hour (maybe more).\n\nThe bread and jams here are great. The French Toast is an easy crowd pleaser. The omelettes aren't cooked with everything mixed together. It's more of a stuff with eggs folded around it setup. The Northern Italian omelet was a tad salty for my taste but definitely creative with its Italian bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, and basil.\n\nThe staff is really friendly and efficient.

You will definitely have to wait 1-2 hours to finally get a table, but luckily you get to meet a lot of characters on the line to keep you entertained. \n\nDuring my wait, there was a group of ladies from New Jersey having quite an interesting internal dispute, a minor accident with a senior falling off her scooter, a visit by some local musicians, and plenty of fun conversation. Quite eventful. \n\nOnce you make it inside, the restaurant is quite comfortable and spacious. They sit the next group at any available table, so it really is a first-come-first-serve queue regardless of group size. The decor is quite cute and homely, though the mean glares from the people waiting in line outside will make you think twice about really taking your time eating. \n\nOnto the food. The crab Benedict was pretty good and the crab definitely fresh, but it did not blow me away. It had spinach in it which partially covered the more delicate flavor of the fresh crab meat. It was also not cheap. \n\nThe famous Montecristo is definitely a must-try if you come here. It was a quite nicely crafted sandwich, different from other incarnations which can get very messy. Was it worth coming here just for the sandwich though? I am not sure I would call it the definitive Montecristo. \n\nThe blueberry pancakes were good pancakes, but not good blueberry pancakes. They were fluffy, but were lacking in the blueberriness. The blueberries, can't just be on the outside, they have to be in the batter and get cooked along with the pancake. \n\nOverall, I had a fun experience and a pretty good brunch, but was it worth the wait? I don't think so. Come on a weekday.", "author": "Augusto T."}

Once you get in the doors, you have a small line as you pass by the open kitchen and order at the register. From there, you're seated at your table.\n\nSomehow one of my friends brought up the fact that my birthday is next week and the guy asked me if I wanted the restaurant to sing me Happy Birthday. I shrugged it off and the guy announced my birthday and indeed got the whole restaurant to sing me Happy Birthday. Haha.\n\nHere's the rundown of the food and drinks:\n\n1. Orange Juice - looked like fresh squeezed OJ and my friends seemed happy with it!\n2. Monte Cristo Sandwich - pretty good rendition of the classic sandwich. Not as heavily fried as the one from Disneyland, but that's probably a good thing. They serve it with a jam that tastes homemade. The sandwich itself probably could use some more filling since I didn't really taste any of the ham or cheese.\n3. Crab Benedict - they're doing it right. It's one of the pricier options, but they put a fair amount of crab under a buttered english muffin, topped with a perfectly cooked poached egg, and a rich hollandaise sauce. It was so filling I couldn't finish the entire english muffin.\n4. French Toast Sampler - three different pieces of bread dipped in an egg batter and cooked to perfection. It's topped with sliced bananas, strawberries, and blueberries. The cranberry orange walnut bread was probably my favorite. Nice and sweet. The banana bread was also nice, but quite dense to be made into french toast. The Swedish cinnamon bread was just okay, with a slight cinnamon flavor, but not much else.\n\nOther items that looked pretty good were the omelets and the bacon (nice thick cut strips).\n\nThe service was excellent and the food was tasty and rather filling.

The harder decision always is, when I decide to come by myself, whether or not that if that morning I am willing to stand in line for over an hour next to someone reading an Alcatraz map out loud. Usually common sense will win out 9 times out of 10, but that one time I do make the sacrifice, I have always patiently endured the wait with hunger (secretly smiling to myself when someone in front of me in line bows out and leaves before getting inside), but have always left satisfied and rewarded with a solid treat that gives me a special start to the rest of my day.\n\nEverything on the menu here is solid, and the quality is always consistent. My favorites depend on my mood, I usually order the eggs benedict. The way they make it here is just head and shoulders over anywhere else, the hollandaise is just the right consistency with a little kick, the fact that they make it with real Canadian bacon that is harder and harder to find these days, and the eggs are always perfectly poached. If I'm feeling like something more substantial, the French toast here cannot be beat, and the ultimate combination of French toast with everything else that goes well with it is the Monte Cristo sandwich, which I can never finish in one sitting because the Havarti cheese is so rich, but would recommend sharing if coming with larger groups.

I had a stacked schedule, and the wait time at Mama's was just too long for me. This weekend I had some time on my hands, so I got to Mama's around 10:30, and the wait was a little over an hour. One of the women working there was kind enough to come out and give some of us hungry patrons a little water while we stood outside looking at a bunch of people dressed up in Santa costumes walk around the are; SantaCon I believe they were headed.\n\nAnyway, now I'm at the front of the line, time to find out what the hype is all about. I get inside, wait in another, but much smaller line. You walk past the grill and all the freshly baked bread and desserts, and then order before sitting down, which I always love doing, because when I'm ready to go then I can just head out.\nI sit down, and when the gentleman delivers my food, he gives me a tip to put the homemade raspberry preserves on my French toast. After finishing up half of my eggs, bacon, and home fries, I get into the French toast. Now, if you're a fan of Smucker's raspberry preserves, prepare to have your world turned upside down. The jam was magnificent, but I was bummed out to find that they don't sell it. I was; however, able to get a small to-go cup of it.\n\nThe hour wait was definitely a bit long, but it's not their fault; it's just a popular spot, and understandably so. Just be prepared to have to make a bit of time for it if you're on a schedule. It was well worth it in my opinion, and when I return to California next month I will certainly be returning here. I was told that if you can make it there around 8AM, then you may avoid a crazy line, but I could not confirm that myself.\n\nFor food, I ordered the Swedish cinnamon French toast, which is their default, along with scrambled eggs with Swiss cheese, home fries and a side of bacon. I usually like my French toast crispy around the edges, but I often find that this will cause the inside to be a bit soggy. Mama's French toast isn't very crispy on the outside, but the inside was perfectly fluffy, which was a find trade-off in my opinion. The bacon: three very big, crispy, and delicious slices. The swiss cheese eggs were excellent, and while I'm not a huge home fries fan, these were crispy enough for my liking. I also ordered silver dollar pancakes and an apple crumb cake-type dessert to go, but I didn't eat the pancakes until about nine hours later; they were still pretty delicious. The verdict is still out on the crumb cake, but I will get to that at some point.", "author": "Melvin D."}

The blueberry pancake was fluffy and delicious, although not as good as the blueberry wheat germ pancake at Stacks! Maybe that's just me and my love affair with wheat germ (hey it does have health value!). \n\nService Review: Our server was very friendly and delivered our food as soon as it was ready. We were a little nervous we wouldn't be able to make it in before their 3pm close with the crazy line, but admins assured us we would make it and they were right. \n\nVenue Review: Looking for parking consumed all of 20 minutes, but eventually we ended up parking at the Catholic school on the same block just down the street...and no one towed! The school parking lot was open, no one there had permits, and people seemed to be simply parking and then going elsewhere so why not. \n\nThe restaurant itself is tiny: maybe a dozen small tables in this itsy bitsy corner brunch place at Washington Square. The line, however, stretches the length of the restaurant. We ended up waiting about an hour in line for a table for 2...but it was well worth the wait! \n\nOverall Impression: There were so many people taking photos that we are convinced this is an SF tourist attraction. Their food overall is up-there in the rankings, but I think Stacks beats them on blueberry pancakes and Sarabeth's kills on their eggs benedicts. Still, Mama's is certainly a spectacular SF brunch (if you can get in by 3pm!). Long wait aside, this place is adorable and we really enjoyed our brunch!", "author": "Rachael K."}

Expect to wait an hour to get in, and then another 10-15 minute line to order and wait to be seated once you're inside. The wait is soon forgiven as the service and food is really excellent. The restroom, if you can call it that is worth seeing for a laugh. The place is really small, not really good for big groups, especially to all the people who are still waiting in line. Best for brunch or lunch I think, couples will like the intimate seating but in reality, quarters are a little tight... \n\nWaiting in line to get into Mama's, one is afforded a view of North Beach on Stockton and Filbert, I remember some things.  In the original movie 'Dirty Harry' when Scorpio was looking for his next potential victim, he was about to shoot the gay, black man in a pancho, who was waiting for his partner that came out of Mama's holding an ice cream cone!

Different, but effective I guess.\n\nI had the Monte Cristo sandwich:  turkey, ham,  cheddar, and havarti all between slices of cheese bread, dipped in egg batter and pan fried like French Toast.  Served on a plate with homemade jam, strawberry and orange slices, country potatoes, and then dusted with confectioners sugar.  I found that dipping the sandwich in the jam made this taste soooo gooood!!!...\n\nMy better half had the excellent Eggs Florentine:  2 poached eggs with spinach and mushrooms and Hollandaise sauce,  the mushrooms and spinach were really fresh.  I tried a bit, and it was one of the best Egg Florentines that I have tasted in a long time...\n\nThe waiters and servers were very nice and attentive.  If you need to use the restroom, watch your step as it is little more than a water closet, literally,  down a couple of steps outside the back and back up a couple of steps.

The place is teeny tiny, and since I was a party of one I had to wait for a two person table to open up before being seated. \n\nReally that's the trick. Get there early and only have 3-4 people in your party. If you are a two person party they will only seat you at the two-seat tables.

It's more of an open faced omelette, but with all the goodies sprinkled on. The brie really made this even better. And it came with two slices of toast and a side of potatoes. The potatoes are DELICIOUS by the way. Have the toast with their homemade marionberry jam at every table. I am not joking when I say it is ridiculously addicting and yummy. You'll keep reaching for more.\n\n[French Toast Sampler] --three delicious slices of their awesome breads battered and french-toasted. I think the breads we had were lemon raspberry bread, cinnamon apple?, banana something....and they were topped with fresh banana, strawberries, raspberries, and marionberries. Yummy!\n\nTheir pastries looked really good too, albeit a bit pricey. I ordered a small glass of fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice and it was also kind of pricey for what I got, but it was refreshing.

During that time the people in line were not offered any sort of refreshment or the opportunity to use the bathroom by the Mama's staff.\n\nOne would think that the owner would appreciate the huge amount of business he or she is getting on a daily basis and would show a bit of appreciation and common decency by making the wait in line as comfortable as possible.  There were a couple of small benches where people could sit while they waited - but additional benches need to be added so that more people can sit down while they wait.\n\nFinally, be careful when using the bathroom - the toilet seat is loose.

You pay for the cute atmosphere, neighborhood, and visually refreshing food. But nothing else. \n\nPut simply, it's a winner if you're visiting or in the area. But there are better french toasts and egg benedicts in this city (e.g. Zazies!).", "author": "Diane N."}

We didn't have to wait that long - we were advised by an Uber driver to get there early, got there 30-ish mins. before they opened, and still had to wait another 30 mins. or so - but nothing compared to line that was there on our way out.  \n\nFood wasn't anything special and had ANOTHER long wait to receive it.  Friend had French toast, I had an omelet, and neither was exceptional.  The place is very cramped, and another party that had someone with a disability was having trouble a few tables away.

Maybe this was an off-day, since clearly they have a big following, but I can honestly say I wouldn't go back.  Especially not if I had to wait any longer than I did.

We were debating between the crabs benedict and the omelette and the owner recommended the omelette because it was simple and you were able to taste the crab more, while the benedict had a more complex taste to it. I'm sure both would be equally amazing. The potatoes that came with the meal on the other hand are not their strong suit. But everything else did not dissapoint, and was worth the wait! \n\nAlso tried their chocolate crumble and that was delicious too!! Would recommend", "author": "Lauren W."}

We decided to order a couple of dishes to share. We had the pancakes, the french toast sampler and an omlette (I just remember there being goat cheese and spinach). The pancakes were absolutely heavenly, so fluffy and delicious. The french toast was a nice surprise and we got to try a bunch of different flavors. The omlette was a savory treat that came with home fries. All items that we ordered were delightful. Our server even came around and told us to try a reddish sauce on our pancakes. I'm not sure what they put into that sauce but it was sooo tasty.\n\nMy friend and I only waited about 20-25 minutes to eat at Mama's. The entire staff is so friendly. The restaurant is small which is why you have to wait a long time for a table. Its a order first, seat later kind of restaurant.

For me, I don't think it was worth the 2 hour wait, but I guess I have to do it at least once in my life since I live in SF. The restaurant is pretty small, and probably seats around 30-40 people at a time. Mama's is definitely more for tourists than locals. However, the portions are huge and the prices are reasonable! Would come again if the line wasn't that long...\n\nI purchased a Scoutmob deal for $25, which included the following:\n\n1) 2 Fresh Squeezed Mimosas\nSmall, but you can definitely taste the alcohol! And it supposedly uses fresh squeezed OJ, but I couldn't really tell the difference, but I'll believe it!\n\n2) Chocolate Crumb Cake\nNot a fan of chocolate, but it was indeed very crumbly. \n\n3) Banana Walnut Bread\nMoist and soft, but nothing that spectacular. Had a hint of cinnamon, which I didn't like :( \n\n4) Buttermilk Pancakes\nOMG THIS WAS SO GOOD!!!! The pancakes were light, airy, and fluffy! They almost just melt in your mouth!! Be sure to eat them warm :) I would definitely order this again next time if I do come back!! \n\n5) Monte Cristo\nThis dish was pretty tasty as well, but VERY filling! At most, I think I could've just finished half of this. This is basically a french toast sandwich stuffed with ham and cheese. It was just so perfectly soft and delicious! It also comes with house potatoes, which were very flavorful as well. Would recommend getting this dish!! :) \n\n5) Pasiano Eggs Benedict\nWas not a fan of this mainly cause of the hollandaise sauce. By the time I was eating my fair share, the english muffin already soaked up the sauce, which made it really soggy. Probably need to eat this ASAP. \n\nIn addition, we ordered the following:\n\n6) Dungeness Crab Omelette\nThis was really good! The omelette was filled with fresh? dungeness crab! You can actually see the chunks of crab in each bite. This is on the pricer side though ($22), but it's worth it for the big portion and the amount of crab you get! \n\n7) Salmon Scramble\nThis was alright.. basically just eggs scrambled with small pieces of salmon, with house potatoes and a bagel. Nothing too special here. \n\nFood is definitely better than a lot of the other breakfast places in SF, but I'm not sure if I would say this is the best one. I feel like most people convince themselves it's the \"best\" brunch food they've ever had because of the long wait? Nonetheless, this is worth a try at least once! :)", "author": "Michelle L."}

Wonderful wonderful place that any short visit to San Francisco is incomplete without. Mama's is truly a top tier place to go to for a brunch and an icon to the city and North Beach. First thing's first, if you're planning on coming here, plan on a solid wait (30 minutes to an hour, sometimes even more). It's a really small space and they can only fit so many people at once. If you're lucky and show up a tad before closing (3 pm) you might only have a 20ish minute wait, otherwise showing up that late could risk being just short of the cut off. Anyways once you've trekked your way inside, there's another smaller line but then you can use this time to make the ultimatum between two items or take in the homely interior. Mama's also has amazing little pastries, but they only make one batch of each per day so you're gonna have to come a little earlier and pray that they haven't ran out of carrot cake (I've only been lucky enough to have this once throughout my multiple visits). Be sure to also sample some of their freshly squeezed orange juice or grapefruit juice. You'll be seated shortly after ordering by one of the very friendly and conversational servers and you can even spot the owner lurking around on occasion. The entire place just makes you feel like you're in a classic mama's place, so home-like and cozy. The food doesn't take too long to come out but it feels like years after all the collective waiting and it definitely amplifies the taste a little, but it's still the highest of quality regardless. As good as the eggs benedict are, I somehow always end up ordering french toast. The kugelhopf and chocolate cinnamon french toasts are both to die for. So sweet, so soft, and so satiating. It enough to leave you full but still surmountable, you don't have to be a competitive eater to clean your plate here. I think it's almost impossible to leave this place unhappy, honestly a five star plus place.", "author": "Qasim S."}

They take a couple groups at a time. You line up and order at the counter and THEN you sit down. So don't expect them to let in the first 15 parties all at once right at 8AM. At 8AM, they only let in the first 3 parties. They let in the next 3 parties probably around 8:20AM. Now I understand why the line is always so freakin' long. \n3.

When you get inside there's ANOTHER line but thankfully this one is quicker. You line up by the bakery counter/kitchen and can see pastries there and what's being cooked. By the time you get to the front of that line you order and pay at the counter. Then, somewhat magically, there will be a table open for you. I mean, I assume there will be, unless you have like 8 people in your party. Small parties are better here, it's not that big.

For instance, we and three other couples sat outside in line, looking in at open tables for 45 mins, while they waited until a party of four left so they could seat the party of four in front of us.

Great combination all together! The jam was fresh, fruity, and delicious. I'd definitely get this again if I come back! The staff and service were great.

Sure the long is wait and finding parking is a headache but if you come with the right mindset, Mama's is totally worth trying at least once. \n\nFor years, I had been driving past this brunch locale wondering why the line is out the door. Finally, I committed, took the plunge, and waited like the many before me to try their most popular dishes. Yes, you guessed it -- Dungeness Crab Benedict, French Toast Sampler, and the Monte Cristo. Also tacked on the Smoked Salmon Benedict and Eggs Florentine. I figured that starving for an hour equals ordering more worth. Got to make the trip worth it. \n\nHow can anyone not love the Monte Cristo?! Sweetness of the jam paired with the salty turkey breast, baked ham, and Harvarti cheese is already a match made in heaven. Having the entire sandwich dressed up as French Toast send this dish over the top. Dungeness Crab Benedict did not disappointed either. Perfectly poached eggs on top of a nice helping of crab and spinach. Some might think this is blasphemy, but Mama's Crab Benedict rivals Zazie's La Mer. French Toast Sampler was excellent and a great way to try their Banana Nut, Kugelhopf, and Swedish Cinnamon. Fruit was fresh and not doused in syrup, which is always a plus. The other two Benedicts were good but not memorable. \n\nNow for I passed the boring wait. First, you need a very nice, patient Buddy #1 to drive around looking for parking while you wait in line. Either that or take the bus. Second, you need Buddy #2 to wait in line with you. You can also throw in Buddy #3 to create the perfect even group of four. Once Buddy #1 has found parking, divide up into pairs - one set will stand in line, while the other explores North Beach and Chinatown. Exercise, good conversation, and great food all rolled into one trip to Mama's. \n\nWhat I recommend: \n\n-- Monte Cristo\n-- Dungeness Crab Benedict\n-- French Toast Sampler\n-- Be prepared to stand and wait. \n-- Bring a good parker, preferable one that can park up hills and in tight spaces or take the bus. \n-- Bring cash, unless you want to pay the extra $1 card charge.", "author": "Andrew W."}

The decor and furniture was classic and old fashioned and the food was delicious! It felt like I was in someone's home.

I was in food heaven. \n\nSo here's the deal...you wait outside until someone escorts your party inside. You then wait in another line to order. After that, you wait again for an open table. It's super cramped inside so be weary of bringing big parties. The food comes out to your table once you're seated. Portions are large and in charge. Monte Cristo was definitely good, for the first few bites. After that, it was just too cheesy and hearty for my liking. It came with a side of baby greens and an impeccable home made jam.

It's not bad...but it's not good enough. I knew there was going to be a long line, I knew there was going to be a wait, and I knew there was a lot of hype about how good Mama's is. But still, it wasn't worth it, not even once.\n\nI came here early on Sunday morning and ended up standing in line for TWO HOURS before we finally got through the doors. Only to wait in line again about 20-30 min to order our food and be seated (yes, there's another line inside).\n\nThe food was average. I had the Washington Square Omelette with a side of chicken turkey sausage. Everyone else ordered the Crab Eggs Benedict (average), the Vegetarian Eggs Benedict with a side of salmon, and the Classic Eggs Benedict. I've had much much better eggs benedict. The best part of our meal was the Mama's Smoothie and the sides of salmon & sausage. \n\nEven worse, the Classic Eggs Benedict was extremely undercooked:  a good portion of the egg whites were clear, watery and raw. The waitress was very apologetic though and had a new plate prepared and checked up on us 2-3 afterwards to make sure everything was okay.\n\nThere are so many other brunch places in SF with better food and, although there will probably be a wait, they allow you to put your name on a list and come back when you can be seated versus standing in line like cattle and wasting 2.5 hours of your day waiting for average food.

I can't stop talking about the experience we had visiting you. \n\nFrom the moment we walked in our server, greeted us and asked if we knew what we wanted. We said yes so he sat us down and said he would put in our order. Typically you would have to walk up to the counter, order and then wait to be seated. I wish I would asked for his name because he was good. He had this ability to make us feel comfortable in a small crowded restaurant and make us laugh. \nWe ordered the monte cristo and the Dungeness crab omelette because of the reviews. I'm happy we went with Yelpers recommendations. \nThose of you that eat monte cristos know that they can be on the greasy or heavy side at times. Mama makes the best, light, fluffy most flavorful monte cristo I've ever had. Perfect balance of sweet and savory. Use the jam....you won't regret it. The crab omelette came out and I honestly didn't think much of it at first. I wouldn't have ordered based off looks alone. Wow, wow, wow!! Filled with real chunks of Dungeness crab, havarti cheese and avocado. Sooooo good. All the sides of home style potatoes and fruit were all good which was to be expected. \nMy only gripe would be the hour long wait. It was kind of fun chatting with strangers in line about what they were going to order. I met a couple that went two days in a row. Two days and waiting an hour each time. That's crazy! But after hearing that I was sold and excited to try the food. So I recommend to wait in line, have someone in your party go down the street to grab some coffee, make some friends and get ready to enjoy some great food.

Muahahahah!!!! I hear that normally you have to be here earlier. I've heard about two hour lines. Actually being in line for Mama's is quite an experience. The people in line were quite friendly and there were people chatting up and down the line. We chatted away with the first people that arrived.\n\nFinally 8 AM arrived and we found out that now you have to order at the register and then sit down. This was not good for my BF since he didn't really know what he wanted and felt he had to make a choice fast since there were soooo many people in line behind us. I already knew what I wanted from the moment he proposed Mama's days earlier. I always order Eggs Florentine at breakfast places. I do not think that the way they have you order here is a good idea since the way from the door to the register is too narrow for them to be doing that. It looks bad too. This is one of the reasons I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.\n\nMy Eggs Florentine had the BEST hollandaise sauce EVER!!!! I would have liked more spinach though. I forgot to ask for my eggs over hard. I am not a fan of runny yolk....oh well.... The potatoes that came with the eggs were really good. My double cappuccino was great too.\n\nMy BF had Eggs Benedict. It was delicious as well. Nice tasting ham in it.\n\nWe shared the French Toast Sampler. The french toast was made of home made bread. Banana, cranberry and cinnamon bread. The cranberry bread was the best and one of the best cranberry breads I have ever had....wow!!!! It was as good as cranberry bread I had tasted in the First Grade which i have never forgotten. Wow....nice sweet and sour cranberries....mmmm!!!! The pieces of bread are pretty small though. However, they do give you a good amount of fruits with the bread. Notably, they serve fresh blueberries and strawberries....mmmm!!!!\n\nThe second reason this place does not get 5 stars is because woe is anyone who really needs to go to the bathroom here. There is only one and it is somewhere behind the area where the dishwashers work. I had to wait and wait and wait and WAIT for the person that was in there to finish. All the time I was WAITING I had to dodge customers and waiters and busboys haha! Not fun at all and you begin to feel quite silly just standing there! That's just how narrow this place is. It's a really small and narrow restaurant.\n\nOne of the best things about my Mama's experience is that I got a window seat. There is a really cool view of the grassy plaza in front of the restaurant from the seat I chose. If you are lucky you just may get to see groups of people practicing Tai Chi in that park. According to a lady that was reading a newspaper behind us, the day we were here was the same day when DiMaggio tried to wed Monroe in the church that is in front of the plaza. Interesting, though I am a fan of neither.

But even so, eating at Mama's is something you have to do at least once.\n\nAs you wait in line to order, you have a clear view of the cooks preparing the food with all the fresh, vibrant ingredients. It helped me make my decision on what to order since everything on the menu sounded so good. I went with the North Beach benedict and shared it with my girl who ordered the Blackstone benedict. The North Beach was on the saltier side but still delicious. However, I think I'd prefer the Blackstone with the crunchy, hearty bacon. The poached eggs were perfectly runny and soaked into the store-bought English muffins. The potatoes accompanying the benedicts were hearty, earthy, and very comforting. I'd order both of these again. In addition, I had a taste of the banana nut French toast too. It was a delicious bread with lots of flavor but lacked a crunchy, eggy exterior that characterized French toast as French toast. It was almost as if the banana nut bread wasn't coated in an egg batter at all.\n\nThe Monte Cristo seemed to be a crowd favorite, but I really didn't think it was that special. It really needed the homemade jam, which is probably good on everything, for it to taste great. It was a regular sandwich to me.\n\nWhen I come back, it won't be because I'm craving Mama's, but because it's some sort of an occasion, i.e. catching up with friends I haven't seen in months.

I know it's an institution and what not, but I think there are other comparable and even better places to eat. \n\n- French toast sampler: This is the recommended one since you get a slice of each of their special breads. The main problem for me was that the toast wasn't light and airy. It was good, but nothing special. I could find similar toasts at other places.\n- North Italian omelette: I really liked the pancetta because it was unique and gave it a distinct flavor. Everything worked well together. What ruined the plate for me was the homefries, which were inconsistent. Some were well-done and some were just soggy and chewy. We actually ordered an extra side of it and regretted it.\n\nThe service was great throughout; they were prompt with refilling our water and didn't try and rush us even though there were people waiting.

Make sure to get their early, because the line can grow quite long (even on a Thursday morning). \n\nInside, Mama's is a charming cozy cafe with bright tables and accents that offer an instant mood booster (no matter how severe the hangover). The food is simply delicious. I ordered the Washington Square omelet. It was the perfect amount of savory and spicy, not to mention the size of a regulation football. The grilled potatoes were exceptionally seasoned and cooked to perfection.

We arrived on a Thursday morning at 8:35 a.m., and there was already a line of about 30 people outside the restaurant. The line was moving very slow, too. I started second-guessing the wait, but people came out and were raving about how delicious it was. \n\nAt around 9:30 a.m., we finally made it inside - only to discover ANOTHER line that you wait in to order. Then, you wait again for a table to open up. All in all, we waited an hour and a half just to get our food -- on a Thursday.\n\nI ordered the Californian omelette. It was good - not a more than 15 minute wait good, though. My colleague ordered the french toast sampler. I fear that perhaps I selected the wrong item after trying a bite of her french toast. It was good. Again, I would argue it's not an hour and a half wait good. There's not many food items I would wait an hour and a half for. \n\nOnce we were seated, the service was attentive and good. There's a tiny bathroom outside, which was a little strange. \n\nOverall, I didn't find the food to be worth the wait. I'd go back if it were only a 15-20 minute wait at most.

Deliciously good w/ a not too thick/not too sweet cream cheese frosting. My other half had if I remember correctly, the dungeon crab eggs benedict, might as well go big after all that waiting.

A friend and I shared a couple of specials: the crab cake benedict and the French toast sampler. The crab cake benedict was ok; kind of a chintzy fried flat crab cake. Not that impressed. The side of potatoes was delicious, and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The French toast platter was AWESOME. Especially the banana bread one. Yum!\n\nI also ordered a Bloody Mary, which tasted kind of weird. Apparently (according to the menu) they make it with soju instead of vodka, so maybe that's why. I couldn't drink more than a quarter of it before I abandoned it.\n\nBut the venue. Goodness, what a trainwreck. For some odd reason they do not keep a list of names like a normal restaurant - you are forced to line up outside and wait like you're at the mall on Black Friday. When you finally get to the door and are allowed to enter the restaurant, you still don't get to relax. You have to get in a second line to order your food. After all that, you get to the register... only to find that they do not accept credit cards. Cash and debit cards only. When you're seated, it is cramped.\n\nAdditionally, the bathroom setup is really weird. In order to get there, you have to cut through a portion of the kitchen, go outside, down some steps, and into a teeny tiny unisex bathroom. I'm not sure how a disabled patron would use the restroom.\n\nAll in all, I'd be willing to give the food another shot, but maybe order takeout if they allow it.

I usually like pretty plain items like scrabbled eggs and bacon. We walked from our hotel to mamas to see a big line. I'm going to guess 30-45 people ahead of us. It took about an hour to get through the line to get inside. Then once inside you get inside, you then stand in another line to order. This next line took about 15 minutes. I ordered a Bloody Mary and classic eggs Benedict. To start, the place is very small so seating is tight. We sat and waited about 15 minutes for the food to come. My Bloody Mary was one of the worst I've had. It was similar to eating straight pepper. I only drank about half of it because it was burning my stomach and I couldn't stomach another sip. The eggs Benedict was nothing special. Poached eggs over ham on an English muffin. I've had better. All in all, it's a lot of hype. I asked my wife what score she would give it.

You are SO worth waiting in line for.\n\nI came here with my boyfriend for brunch on a Thursday afternoon. There were about 15-20 people in line and the wait was about an hour for two people. Parking wasn't too bad, however, on weekends, it can get a little hectic so be prepared. Don't forget to feed your meter if you don't find a free 2 hour parking spot nearby!\n\nWhile waiting, I tried so hard not to look like a total creeper by watching the people enjoy their meals, but it was difficult! When you get to the front of the line, there is a menu: check it! They have plenty of breakfast/lunch items to choose from and yes, it may be difficult to make a decision, but you can always come back another day to try another thing on the menu. Once you get to the front of the line, you have to wait in another line to order your food/wait for a table. Here comes the hard part: MAMA'S WILL TEASE YOU! As you are waiting, you will be able to see the cooks prepare other people's meals right in front of you! After you go through that torture, they will direct you to your seats.\n\nLuckily, my boyfriend and I were seated right away because we had a small party. Due to Mama's modest size, they really do their best to sit people together instead of separating their parties. I ordered the french toast sampler and Mama's potatoes while my boyfriend ordered the monte cristo sandwich.\n\nFrench Toast Sampler: It came with a Cinnamon Swirl French Toast, Banana Nut French Toast, and a Cranberry Walnut French Toast sprinkled with banana slices, strawberries, and blueberries accompanied with syrup. This was probably the best french toast I've ever had. The outside was perfectly crispy, was drenched in smooth butter, and the bread was just phenomenal! The syrup was very good and complemented the french toast slices. The fruit was sweet and fresh, too!\n\nMama's Potatoes: These were just okay. Unlike Plow, these potatoes were bland and lacked flavor. I'd say the potatoes were forgettable!\n\nMonte Cristo Sandwich: This was so good! Probably one of the best Monte Cristo's I've tasted and I didn't feel like I was going to have a heart attack right after! The Monte Cristo was perfectly fried, the cheese was smooth and creamy, and the ham was thin and flavorful.

Ninety minutes on a Tuesday makes it unlikely that I'll re-visit Mama's anytime soon.  We arrived at 9 AM and joined the line wrapped around the restaurant's outside corner.  Mama's doesn't take reservations and you can't put your name down on a list and return when it's time.  You must have someone waiting in line at all times.  Thankfully there are several coffee shops nearby and you can pick up a coffee while another member of your party holds your place.  \n\nOnce you finally get to the front of the line, the host will let you enter.  You'll be ushered to the counter where you, first, order and pay for your food, and then, get shown to your table.\n\nThe food was good, but nothing more amazing than other SF brunch spots.  The two of us shared a slice of blueberry bread, one of their eggs benedict specials, and the french toast sampler.  The blueberry bread and eggs benedict were both very good, but the french toast sampler was a disappointment.  The french toast was dry (I think the bread needed to be soaked longer before being cooked) and the different samples tasted more or less the same.  If there is a next time for me, I would try the blueberry pancakes - the table next to us seemed really to be enjoying them. \n\nPrices were reasonable and the historic value of the location and restaurant were very cool, but the 90-minute wait on a weekday is just too much to make Mama's a go-to spot for me.", "author": "Kimya P."}

We got the sample French toast, shrimp eggs Benedict, and various other dishes to share. It was the best meal I've had in SF during this visit. Service was great.

My NY girlfriend came to visit me over the holidays, and she only expects the best when it comes to food. We aimed to arrive at 8 (which is when the place opens) on a Sunday because the line gets long. Luckily found parking nearby and got in line by 8:05. The line was pretty long and the place just opened 5 minutes ago. The wait was about an hour but went by pretty quickly if you're chatting it up with friends. 2 of my friends went to La Boulange and grabbed us some hot drinks and macarons to enjoy while we waited. \n\nI really wanted to have the dungeness crab benedict ($19), but being the broke grad student that I am, I went for the eggs florentine. French toast is usually my default, but have recently fallen in love with poached eggs. Eggs perfectly poached; flavorful hollandaise; and perfect potatoes. Definitely beats any of the $15+ eggs benedicts I've had in NY. \n\nHere are my tips:\n\n-If you do get the french toast, it's imperative that you add some of their homemade jam to your french toast. It's takes it to a whole nother level. \n\n-Get in line before the place even opens.", "author": "Katrina L."}

As you wait in line to order your food, you can actually see the cooks making everyones food. The staff was also quite warm and welcoming. But this one waiter was kind of weird.

And he also did it again to my friend when she asked for a box to go. And then it becomes awkward when he says no because honestly, what do you say to that because you know they're going to give it to you?? Weird guy, but friendly. And cute too.

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't standing in line for 1.5 hours good. Or $19.50 good. It was mediocre and the sauce was also a little overly sour.\n\nLuckily the crab omelette was amazing and stopped me from thinking that this place is overrated. There was a fairly generous portion of crab in the omelette and it was delicious. It went nicely with the avocado and brie, as they brought out the flavor more, and yet at the same time they also toned the flavor down a little, if that makes any sense.\n\nThe french toast sampler was good and nicely decorated with fruits.

A really good crumb cake=4.5\nI was debating on so many choices, but went with the Farmers Omelette: \nSmoked Bacon, Baby Spinach, Grilled Leeks and Sonoma Goat Cheese $10.50, I opted for egg whites. The Omelette was well balance with all the ingredients, very tasty and the egg whites were made perfect. The Mama's Grilled Potatoes were bit crunchy outside, but nice and soft inside. I chose the sourdough baguette and it was really great sourdough bread. Farmers Omelette=4.5\nI had regular coffee=4\nI can't rate my wife's food based on my taste, but she really enjoyed The Californian Omelette: Crispy Bacon, Avocado, and Monterey Jack Cheese $10.25\nShe also agreed that this place is worth a 30 minute, maybe 45 minute wait.\nSo, all in all, it was really good.

This monte Cristo is a win.\nFor the crab cake , the actual crab meat was sweet and tasty and the flavor complemented with the potatoes that came with it .\nAfter the meal , there was no feeling of fullness that's disgusting but light and satisfied.\nGo and take The mama's challenge ..

So i've been to Mama's several time, each time I am prepared to wait in line for at least an hour! But it is definitely worth the wait! I tried their sandwiches before, delicious! But definitely their breakfast food is way better! They have this french toast sampler, I love it! Usually its three flavor of the day, and its never a disappointment. The egg Benedict is delicious and savory. Just thinking about it makes my mouth watery! I had the omelette and it was pretty good but the french toast is where its at!\n\nMama's is a pretty cozy restaurant, great for breakfast and brunch, and no matter what time you go. Its going to be busy! Their servers are quite friendly and even if its busy they make sure you get the attention you need. Asking if you need refills or if you need condiments, they are the best! I would definitely go here if you have some time to wait for good food, but be warn you are going to have to wait and its not going to be a disappointment. Great place to go with friends, family , or someone special!", "author": "Amy T."}

I ordered the yogurt french toast with fresh fruit. However, the french toast was very dense and doughy. My server was understanding, said that the yogurt french toast was her least favorite dish, and let me exchange it for something else. She recommended the egg dishes so I tried the eggs benedict, but the hollandaise sauce was sour. I have never had sour hollandaise sauce before, wasn't sure if it was spoiled, but didn't want to send a second dish back. I think I should've tried the Monte Cristo, but am not sure I'd want to wait in line for Mama's again.

Just be patient with waiting. We waited 20 minutes outside and 20 minutes inside the restaurant before ordering our food. The kitchen is extremely small with 3-4 guys making the food. My hubby got the crab benedict and loved it since there were chunks of fresh crab. This was an expensive dish for $20 which was a bit overpriced, but at least he liked it! I had the sampler trio of French toast with cranberry orange, walnut, and another type of bread. Love the homemade jam that was on the table. I used the jam as my syrup since it was so awesome!

My two teens thought we were crazy to wait for breakfast, but they left as believers.\n\nI ordered the crab cake omelette on a friend's recommendation.  Unfortunately, they don't make such a thing.  They did have a crab cake benedict.  After some negotiation, the lady taking orders conceded to make an crab cake omelette with havarti and avocado.  \"Make sure you let me know how it is\" she said.  \n\nWell, let me say that this was thing of beauty.  The eggs perfectly cooked as always.  The crab cake just crunchy enough to add a new dynamic to the omelette.  Wow, just wow.  Was well worth the $27 price tag.  When I told the lady how good it was, she asked for my name and said it might show up on the menu, so if you order a \"Jeff's Omelette\", that's me!  (Aren't you proud of me, mom?!)\n\nAs for the rest of the meal, potatoes cooked perfectly with a nice crunch and the perfect amount of onion.

Such a deliciously genius invention! I want to make babies with the Monte Cristo. I love it so much.\n- French Toast Sampler: Walnut bread, banana bread, or cinnamon bread? In my usual gluttonous fashion, I could not decide one ONE so I opted for all three and got the sampler. I didn't even need to use syrup. The raspberries, strawberries and blueberries added the perfect amount of sweetness.\n- Washington Square Mom-elette: A sausage, cheese and pepper omelette the size of Washington Square. I had two bites and surrendered. *raises white flag*\n\nTheir house breads are amazing. We tried carrot cake and blueberry sour cream bread and both were really moist and fluffy. I would come back for that alone.\n\nI also must say that the service here is fantastic.

I have a rather list of SF bookmarks, and Mama's was the first to go. I was dreading a long line, but 1 hour from the time we started waiting in line to the time we started eating wasn't too bad. Plus it was a weekday. I don't think I could've handled anything longer.\n\nOnce inside, it was a well-oiled machine. After a long line outside, then there's another mini line inside, where you can watch the cooks crank out breakfast before paying at the register. After paying, then the waitress directs you where to sit.\n\nMy wife and I both had the specials -- I had the crab benedict while she had the crab omelet. Each of these dishes were a shade under $20, and along with a side of bacon, tax and tip, we're talking about a $50 breakfast for 2 here. We were given a table for 2 right by the door -- where minutes earlier I commented, I hope we don't get that table.\n\nI didn't want to be gawked at by the people waiting in line, but it wasn't the case at all. Besides, I was too busy stuffing my face with crab to even notice. The crab benedict was good, and surprisingly not too heavy. The crab omelet was light and fluffy, and both dishes were stuffed with fresh crab meat. The side of bacon came with 5 crispy and thick pieces -- and nice salty contrast to everything else.\n\nSo was it worth the money and wait? It all depends. If you wait in a long line for something, you hope it's good in the end. The food at Mama's was good, but nothing earth shattering. Breakfast is breakfast. Mama's has everything down like a well oiled machine, and service was efficient and friendly. Solid 4 stars from me.", "author": "Dru C."}

Every table has a different flowered plastic table cloth and there are tchotkes on the wall.  \n\nI tried the Eggs Benedict with prosciutto and tomatoes.  And, yes, it was amazing.  I loved that the prosciutto was shredded instead of just one big slice.  It made it so much more flavorful, easier to chew, and cooked better that way.  The accompanying breakfast potatoes were delicious, too, and I love any place that automatically brings me hot sauce with my meal!  The service was fantastic and everyone from the greeter to the cashier to our server was extra friendly.  That's hard to do when you're crazy busy all day.  \n\nOn the way out, I noticed the specials that were posted by the door.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-13", "description": "I ordered the Monte Cristo, and I honestly didn't think it was anything superb or super special.  Even if it's made with Honeybaked ham, the crispy sweet texture that makes this ham delicious gets lost in the melted cheese.  The battered sandwich is lightly dusted with powdered sugar, which is nice, but the homemade raspberry jam is runny and too tangy for my taste.  The portion is also small for the price.  The wait for this place is way too long--it would be preferable if waiters came to your seats to take your order.  While I was waiting in line, it reminded me of being in front of a dance club that isn't crowded at all inside, but the promoters hold up the line to make it look like the club is the place to be.  Definitely won't be returning any time soon.", "author": "Monica O."}

Arriving around opening time, we were doomed to wait 2hrs before entering the petit restaurant to order and get seated. For a restaurant to have an \"auto-wait\" of 2+ hrs (unless you arrive before the sun rises), the food better be worth it!!\n\nThe wait was so long that people in line were sending runners to grab coffee at nearby cafes for their group. A few taxis came by, carrying tourists who were asking the people in line how long the wait was or how long they've been waiting. After hearing \"1.5hrs\", they all got back in their cars/taxis and drove off. Smart decision...\n\nUnfortunately, the food was all (MAJOR) hype, and definitely not worth wasting my time. Reaching the side of the restaurant, I noticed a news article that discussed top tourist destinations - and for SF, they had a long list of destinations to hit... and what's first on the list to start the day? Mama's! Yea... no wonder the hype has skyrocketed!\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, I enjoyed peering into the kitchen, and seeing all the ingredients, breads, and food on the stove, as we waited in a tiny line to order our food. Then we waited to get seating. Waiting, waiting, waiting...\n\nNow to talk food!\n\nI went simple, not giving into hype, and ordered two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast. Pretty hardy, but not too much. I think they also water down their ketchup, seeing as I tipped that bottle over my potatoes, and that stuff just gushed out! The poached eggs were a bit overcooked, seeing as the yolk was near hard-boiled and gooey.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Monti Cristo. I have other friends who have spoken highly of the Monti Cristo, and it seems like my girlfriend somewhat enjoyed it. My opinion? Bland, and completely overrated! The sandwich is cut into quarters, before dropped in egg, and then cooked. I perceived this combination as a french toast sandwich, but they don't add cinnamon. It's just egg. Thus, everything seems really bland. I was also surprised they didn't provide maple syrup for the sandwich. Rather, it's served with more jelly... which is already in a canister on the table.\n\nI don't see why the Monti Cristo is so loved, when it's so simple and underwhelming. Anyone could make it, as long as you have a sandwich and eggs. It's also a good think to make after a long night of drinking.\n\nOh well, after experiencing it once, I could say hands-down that it's NOT worth it! You could try this place out... but you could definitely go to other places, get the same (if not better) food, for a lot less wait-time.", "author": "Kevin J."}

And I live 2 blocks away so we did it smart and got there at 7:30am on a Thursday and were able to sit down at 8:05am or so.\n\nThat is the only way to do it. I repeat. ONLY WAY. If you think this place is worth over 30 minutes in line, you are straight up crazy. I don't know why there is always a line thats over an hour long. Park Tavern is caddy corner to this place and I prefer it to Mama's 9 out of 10 times. No wait, impeccable staff, amazing food, great cocktails.\n\nBut if you want the tourist trap, then wait in line. And don't let the line fool you. A line at 7:30am is different than a line at 8:00am and after because the entire restaurant is available before 8am (at which point they open and quickly fill all seats). So the only time a long line moves quickly is before 8:00am.\n\nI'll close this review by saying that my 4 stars are based mostly on food, which I enjoyed.", "author": "Andrew K."}

French toast and the like. She once messaged me: \"Do you dip or soak when you cook French toast?\" It turns out we both dip. Over the past few years, we've traded some cooking tips and gone on some culinary Yelp adventures. \n\nWhen her birthday rolled around this year, there was only one place she wanted to go: Mama's. With over two thousand reviews on Yelp and a 4 star average, Mama's is *the* place to go for breakfast or brunch.\n\nNow I'm not the type of girl who likes to wait in line for food. I just don't. I can think of so many other things I'd rather do than wait to be seated. But I'll do it for a friend in honor of her birthday. And we tried to minimize the wait by going on a weekday. There still was a surprisingly huge line (please note that pics in this review aren't mine, I just link to them from other fabulous Yelpers.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#OawUK99pZ3IBleoLxk7nfQ  I found it shocking. And even more stunning was seeing some people wait with kids for over an hour. I can imagine doing that with a foodie adult friend, but never an impatient child (like me or my son). \n\nAnyway, birthdays are special, so we waited. And tag-teamed out of line a couple of times to investigate local bakeries and make a coffee run. There was plenty of time for that.\n\nWhen we finally got inside, we decided to go nuts and order a lot of food, because we wouldn't likely return and put up with the wait ever again.

We had plenty leftover. While the food was 5 star worthy, I have to dock a star for the wait. Unless you're into that, it makes me think about the former USSR and those poor bastards who had to wait in line for things, and thank G-d I usually don't have to. Phew.\n\nOur favorites were the Cranberry French Toast and Pan Dore (a unique dish), followed very closely by the Blueberry Pancakes. Their house-made jam was excellent as well. I wasn't crazy about the Eggs Benedict, but I liked the home fried potatoes that came with it.\n\nTo get to the bathroom, you have to walk through the kitchen. When we were there yesterday, the handle came off the faucet, so there was a definite plumbing issue to address.

I ordered 2 dishes: \n\nPan Dore - (2/5) french toast drenched in lemon butter. I didn't like the sour/oily combo that was a little bitter and it soaked the already thin slices of french bread to the point that they were soggy/rubbery. The bread was too thin to have a fluffy consistency and the egg mixture overwhelmed it. It tasted of fried egg basically and I regretted choosing this french toast even though it sounded so unique!\n\nMonte Cristo - (3/5)  I loved the presentation, how the meat & cheese were encased inside the batter and it was divided into 4 neat triangles. While the bread was pretty good, the cheese I had was not melted enough and tasted like Kraft cheese, which I really hate. The breast and ham were thin deli slices that they gave too little of, at least relative to the thickness of the sandwich bread. In short, what was on the inside left something to be desired. My two friends took two of the  4 triangles eagerly since it looked really good, but they were left unimpressed as well. \n\nI tried a bit of my friends' french toast sampler. The presentation was stunning like most dishes here. The fruits were a nice touch, but I usually don't pay restaurants for fresh fruit. I go to the farmer's market for those. The french toasts themselves were underwhelming. I think the best one was the banana bread, but banana bread is hard to mess up.\n\nI think their savory items are better overall from past experiences of ordering benedicts and everything involving eggs. \n\nI'm going get on the bandwagon and say that I would come here again if the line is short, simply because  Mama's is usually in such high demand and I buy into the hype and recognize a rare opportunity.  The service is always efficient at least, and it is an inviting, cozy spot to eat with warm, bistro colors.

Surprisingly, it wasn't heavy at ALL and the flavors were amazing. The house potatoes were toads awesome as well :)\n\nFrench toast sampler:\nCame with 3 kinds of bread: cranberry, cinnamon, banana. Wish I took a bite when it was still fresh but we ate it as \"dessert\" after we finished our entrees. I think it woulda been pretty damn good and the varieties of bread is great. The fruit on top was really fresh too! They didn't skimp on that either.\n\nMonte Cristo:\nUHHHHHHHHHHH SOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD. French toast with cheese and turkey on the inside. Gushy soft, savory goodness mixed with the light, airy, semi-sweet bread was HEAVEN!! I want some now.\n\nOrange juice:\nPretty good but not $3 worth! You can tell it's fresh though. Wish it were more cool but at least you know they made it on the spot and that it wasn't sitting in the fridge.\n\nSpiked lemonade:\nFresh squeezed lemonade with sauvignon blanc and soda.

I went on a Sunday morning fully expecting a significant wait but it thoroughly exceeded my expectations.  Arrived around 9:30am  on a Sunday and stood in the lengthy line for about 2 hours.  Thank baby jesus it was a beautiful day outside but once you finally get to the door and  in the restaurant they stick you in another line to wait to order your food...there is not table service, you order from the counter and they bring you your food.  I complain about the wait just as a warning, I realize it is not the Mama's fault that it is extremely popular.  Do NOT head to Mama's hungry expecting to eat soon.\n\nThe food was very good, minus the Monte Cristo. We went for my GF's birthday and ordered Monte Cristo (horrible), Veggie Benedict add bacon (excellent), spicy Italian sausage (very good), sourdough toast (excellent), spiked lemonade (excellent), Spicy bloody Mary (very excellent). When we ordered the clerk checked my GF's ID and realized it was her birthday.  He got the entire restaurant to sing happy birthday and comp'd her drink. I have no idea why anyone is raving about the Monte Cristo.  I love Monte Cristo's and this was one of the worst one's I have ever had.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-20", "description": "This place is solid. I would give them 3.5, but since that's not an option, I felt they were more deserving of an official 3-star rating. We showed up on a Sunday at about 7:45 and waited in line for about an hour.  I have no qualms about standing in line, as it's indicative of a good restaurant and something we volunteer for. \n\n1. There were 8 of us, and I know they had to wait a good while to push together tables for us.  I appreciate them keeping us together so we didn't have to sit apart from each other.  The place is incredibly small, so large parties take up about...one-third of the place.\n\n2. The concept of paying then eating is odd, but it works. We got to stand in line and watch the cooks put together all the plates, which was very interesting.  They have everything down to a science and make it look easy!  \n\n3. I swapped dishes with someone else so we ordered 2 dishes and passed them back and forth.  The first dish was their apple pan dore. The sourdough bread was really good and tender, nice and thin, very moist.  I was extremely disappointed in their lemon butter sauce.  There was no citrus at all, and it mostly felt and tasted like a melted butter sauce.  There was no zing and it left the dish lacking.  The saut\u00e9ed apples were very good, still a good crunch factor but tender and a really pretty presentation with the pink skins still on. They still didn't quite finish the dish.  Halfway through our meal, our server remembered that we were supposed to have their homemade raspberry jam. Admittedly, I forgot to ask, even though the menu states that all dishes come with it.  Once we received this, the dish turned completely different. The sour preserve helped cut the butter of the sauce and paired well with the sweet apples. This should just come with the jam because it's lackluster without it.\n\n4. The other dish was the North Coast Benedict. The prosciutto was amazing.  Tender and shredded, it was salty and piled on high. The English muffins were crisp and buttery. The biggest issue: the poached eggs were BAD. In hindsight, I should've sent them back. But we had been waiting for an hour and the restaurant was clearly busy. We went with it. The eggs were hard-poached. When you broke the yolk, they were completely solid, no runniness at all. How can I saturate my muffin when the yolk is basically hard-boiled? I admire egg poaching, as it's not something I have mastered, but for a breakfast place this was the most disappointing portion of the plate.\n\n5. Most everyone else at the table ordered the corned beef hash or corned beef benedict. The beef was good.  Tender and shredded, but it lacked the typical vivacity of corned beef I know and love. I think the emphasis on all those pickling spices and mustard seeds would've really popped this savory dish. With the egg on top, the meat just lacked life. \n\nOverall, a good breakfast place. I think the hour long wait is a bit over-hyped but I can safely say I have tried Mama's! If you're willing to wait, it's worth a try for the experience.  \n\nP.S. The bathrooms are extremely inconvenient as you have to go through the kitchen and down some steps in a back patio area.  It's...odd, as people sit out on their porches and watch you, but it's not a deal breaker and something of the charm in this place.", "author": "Kathryn T."}

The woman was becoming very belligerent and loud, taking jabs at the man regarding his race. Once the manager and server came by, the harassing couple was about to leave. Once they left, the manager apologized and said they would not be welcomed again. This went on for a good 20 minutes before they came over and asked what the commotion was about.

A minimum of an hour wait (no matter how early you show or how late), this place will reward those who are patient enough to wait.  Once granted entry inside this marvelous corner restaurant, you will immediately be acquainted with an old fashioned decor reminiscent of a classic 90's brunch place.  Instead of being seated immediately, you have to line up and wait to order inside. Once you place your order, you are directed to your reserved seating, where you are served the rest of the meal.  \n\nAll three of us ordered the Monte Cristo, with an order of Cinnamon French Toast with a topping of Fresh seasonal berries.  This was my first time having any kind of Monte Cristo, but I have to say I was well pleased.  The French Toast was also delicious.  And the the Home-made jam is amazing!!!\n\nOverall this place has fantastic food at a very reasonable price.  The people are friendly (our waiter joked with us and took several pictures of us and our food without us even having to ask haha). The only knock on it I guess is the wait time to get in, but hey, you can't really blame the place for being so popular. :)", "author": "Austin R."}

As with the other reviews, get here early or be prepared to wait. A nice line was already present 10 minutes before opening and if you do not make it through the initial wait, you can stare into the window as those ahead of you are eating. The wait was more than 30 minutes, to get into the diner watching the kitchen do their thing and looking at all the delicious cakes and bread.\n\nYou have plenty of time to decide what you want to order as there is a menu posted outside and inside as you wait to get in front of the cash register. Its order & pay first, then you're seated and get food, which probably speeds things up a little bit.\n\nNow to the food - there are too many choices, which is especially hard for an indecisive person - so I settled on their crab omelette special (the specials are not listed on the menu on their website).

If the food is worth it, I would not mind the wait. Both times I've visited Mama's I had to wait around 40+ minutes to get in; when I mean get in, I mean just to be able to order my food. It took around 20-30 minutes to the food me and my boyfriend ordered. \n\nOrdered: \nCrabs Benedict: The crab was cooked perfectly and they give you generous portions of crab. The eggs and the hollandaise sauce were also cooked perfectly. The crabs benedict is served with home fries. The home fries were crispy and cooked nicely, well seasoned. This dish had just right portion without leaving you too bloated afterwards.\n\nFrench toast sampler: The french toast sampler consisted of banana bread, cranberry-orange bread, and a cinnamon bread. I loved how they freshly bake their bread, each one of them tasted delicious on their own without the batter. Each of the french toast were cooked perfectly, it was not at all undercooked and eggy. \n\nService: Service is friendly, slightly attentive, but when I saw the kitchen get flustered with orders, the waitresses just stood there in the corner talking to each other. There hasn't been a time where I came to Mama's and it was not busy.\n\nOverall, I would definitely suggest this place to someone visiting SF.

Not gonna lie, it was painful because it was extremely windy and my stomach kept grumbling at the sight of everyone's delicious food.\n\n*Tip #1: make sure you look at the menu while you're waiting in line because you order before you get seated!*\n\n*Tip #2: BRING CASH-- they don't take credit cards and they have a $1 fee for debit cards*\n\n*Tip #3: Do NOT come on weekends. We ignored this and regretted it.*\n\n*Tip #4: They're closed on MONDAYS*\n\nATMOSPHERE\nThe workers were very friendly, until they notice that you're done eating and they'll politely try to usher you out. We wanted to stay and chat some more (mainly to let our stomachs digest everything), but we felt uncomfortable every time the waiter came by to ask if everything was fine.\n\nThe decor was very quirky and homey; it definitely felt like I was at a grandma's house. The walls are bright yellow it was very cozy and comfortable.\n\nAfter eating at Mama's, I can see why there's a perpetual line wrapped around the corner: THE PLACE IS JUST SO DARN SMALL! It's very narrow; as a result, there is extremely limited seating. Luckily you can stare at the food as it's being prepared while you wait in line AGAIN (but this time, indoors).\n\nFinally, the clientele at Mama's is very diverse. I definitely saw a wide range of patrons, from fobs taking self-portraits with their food to local foodies discussing politics-- to students, like my friends and me, celebrating the end of college.\n\nFOOD\nThe only reason why Mama's gets 4 stars is because the food is really expensive here-- I wasn't expecting such steep prices, especially at a mom and pop diner like this. \n\nHowever, the quality of the ingredients and the overall taste of the food made up for the high price tag.\n\nAll 3 of us ordered APPLE PEACH BELLINIS, which were $7 a glass (no refills). The presentation was nice and classy: there was a TON of champagne and freshly cut strawberries. \n\nWe ordered:\n1. MONTE CRISTO WITH HOME FRIES\n-I normally don't like sweet food, but the MC was to die for. It's basically a fancy ham and cheese (2 different cheeses) sandwich dipped in egg and fried. It comes with Mama's famous homemade dipping jam and oranges/strawberries. I was worried that it was going to be soggy, but the texture was just right and it was very fluffy.\n-The sandwich comes in 4 and it's extremely filling.\n-The home fries were good, but nothing special. \n\n2. SMOKED SALMON EGGS BENEDICT\n\n3. SHRIMP EGGS BENEDICT WITH GRILLED TOMATOES AND AVOCADO\n\nBoth SEAFOOD dishes were tasty. You could tell the ingredients were fresh and the dishes didn't have that \"fishy\" taste to them. The flavors blended well together and it was a very light, but hearty meal.\n\nAs someone who doesn't like brunch or breakfast foods, it means something when I say that I would eat at Mama's every morning-- if only the line wasn't so discouraging!", "author": "Krystie M."}

I know, I know, it's part of the charm, but oof!  \n\nWe got there at 8:35 in the morning and waited almost exactly two hours (it was the Fourth of July, so I'm sure that contributed).  Again, it was strangely charming - the people in the line were fun and funny, it was a beautiful morning in Washington Square, and mom and I traded places going and grabbing coffee down the block and watching the elderly Asian ladies doing their fancy dances down in the park.\n\nThe restaurant is tiny and the people are really nice.  You order at the counter and are seated as tables become available.  I want to tell them to make the restaurant bigger, since there is obviously a demand for the food, but the food is so good, they obviously know what they're doing!", "author": "Ramona T."}

That should be the only thing I should have to say about this gem in SF.  \n\nAlthough this place has basically become a tourist attraction in SF, nothing else compares to the quality of the food Mama's puts out for breakfast and lunch.  Getting here, the line doesn't seem like an hour and a half wait but looks are deceiving.  I'm guessing the only time there really isn't a wait is at opening hours but that's it.  I left the place about 45 minutes from closing and the line was still as long as it was when I was waiting.  \n\nBasically its a two-tiered line to get your food, three-tiers if you wanna use the bathroom too.  Outside line to get in the place, inside line to get to the cash register and place your order, and small line to get to the little one toilet shack of a bathroom. The guy working the cash register has a good sense of humor, guessing he gets pretty bored just sitting there.\n\nOn to the food!\nMONTE CRISTO\nDamn. My taste buds went on a wild ride with this one. Turkey, ham, cheddar, and havarti stacked like a club sandwich and cooked up like french toast. Served with their homemade jam and home fries, it could be a meal for two.  Savory, salty, and sweet. Fireworks in my mouth!\n\nDUNGENESS CRAB BENEDICT\nHUGE chunks of crab meat, sauteed spinach, 2 poached egg, and their homemade Hollandaise Sauce, all stacked up high on 2 english muffins. Served with some home fries.  It was delicious but a different kind compared to the Monte Cristo; flavors were not as vibrant but still there.  I had to separate some of the sweet crab meat and eat it by itself because the hollandaise sometimes overwhelmed the delicacy of the crab.  But other than that, definite must.\n\nORANGE JUICE\nhahaha. yea even though it's a bit on the pricier side, it is worth getting, especially after the wait.  Fresh squeezed, or at least it tastes like it, it compliments any dish Mama's serves.\n\nNow, I know people like to enjoy their meals and I respect that, but please, if you ever go here, don't sit there for another half hour sipping on coffee with your party after finished eating.  It's rude and discourteous to those waiting outside.  ALSO, this applies mostly to older asians, DONT STARE IN THE WINDOW AS PEOPLE EAT.  Hella awkward and yea, kinda rude.  I mean, asians do it all the time in typical asian restaurants but come on! A quick glance is all you need!!!

At first I was skeptical and wondered how in the world can a breakfast place be that good to the point where the line takes approximately 1-2 hours. Well Mama's is THEEEE place. My best tip for this place is..COME during WEEEEEEEKDAYS. I came on a Friday around 12pm and I thought the line was horrendous but apparently that was considered \"shorter\" than usual. Come right before it opens because even before it opens there is apparently a line as well. Alright lets talk about the FOOOOOD.\n\n1. Monte Cristo $9.50\n[Breast of Turkey, Baked Ham, Cheddar and Havarti Cheese Bread dipped in Egg and grilled, served with Homemade Jam]\n-OHHHHHH MYYYYY GODDD. Let me tell you..I am usually not too big of a fan of breakfast but seriously this dish had me at HELLO. The sandwich is cooked to perfection. The cheese melts extremely nicely with the egg dipped cheese bread and ham and not to mention the homemade jammmmm is to die for. Honestly the sandwich is only this orgasmic due to the jam. The jam is called Olallieberry jam. Cannot buy this jam anywhere TRUST. So if you ever stop by mama's buy a jar of their famous homemade jam.\n\n2. Dungeness Crab Omelette Approx $19.00\n[with Avocado and sour cream]\n-MEHHH I have had better dungeness crab honestly, but the omelette overall was still very delicious. I disliked the fact that you can see a bowl of already peeled dungeness crab sitting at the window display while u are waiting in line to order. It kind of defeats the purpose of \"fresh\" in my opinion. But it was still very delicious. Yes the omelette is a bit pricy in my opinion but you do get huge chunks of crab in every bite. The omelette and the benedict are the same price but the omelette is much larger in portion and just easier to eat overall. Even though the dungeness was peeled ahead of time and left in the silver bowl in display..the crab still tasted very fresh anyway. The texture of the crab meat was not dull and moldy like dead-unfresh crab.\n\n3. French Toast Sampler $10.75\n-EHHHH if this is your first time at Mama's I guess it is worth trying the french toast sampler...but honestly if I were to come again..i would NEVER get the french toast sampler. To me it tasted very average and the variety of toasts did not seem too special. We got a cinnamon bread, chocolate bread, and banana nut bread all dipped in egg via french toast style. Standard fruit and powdered sugar on top. All tasted very average to me. I would spare that 10 dollars and buy another monte cristo if I knew how average the french toast sampler was. \n\nOverall Mama's is a great breakfast place if you know what to order..haha well that's what yelp is for! Cash only and extremely crowded. Which is why having company is great to pass time with (; After you are done with mama's..head on over to fisherman's warf which is within walking distance away!", "author": "Lena L."}

Pan Dore is lemon sauced bread and my fav.  The Northern Italian omelet is the best and their multiple pastries are not too sweet; just the way I like it. (Not sure if they make pastry there but everything else is clearly prepared in their open glass off kitchen/prep area).  Everyone I see enjoys the meal and I have never had a bad one.  And I agree with the reviewers about the longg wait... it can be up to 45 minutes, but that's why (as a local) - when I go; I being a collapsible lawn chair, a paper, and either sunglasses or an umbrella.\n\nGreat food and family staffing offsets the lack of parking, long line and \"cozy\" setting (closely spaced chairs). \n\nA SECRET!!!  - -  they had a partnership with a restaurant in Marin county that failed.  The partnership, NOT the restaurant.... so anyway, although they are no longer affiliated with the San Rafael entity, the menu over there has many of the same items and it tastes really close  (can you say they cloned the recipes)  - so if you don't want to wait in line and don't mind driving and want to the taste of Mama's (more of less); go to the Marin place. There is outdoor seating too and your view is that of the dock of little boats.\n\nBut as a courtesy to Mama's if you want to find out where this restaurant is, \"Bing\" around for it or send me an email.

It's a clever tactic they got here with the waiting time of 1-2 hours. It's just enough time for tummies to grumble and for anything stuffed into our mouths could be more delicious and tastier than what it actually is or to justify the wait of 2 hours it can be nothing less than delicious. This place didn't disappoint at least! \n\nMy favorite of the things ordered was the orange-cranberry french toast with walnuts and additional seasonal fruit. Usually french toast is too rich for me by the 2nd piece but i didn't find it so with this one, perhaps it was soaked in orange juice and the batter was lighter. I was able to enjoy every bite and gobble it all up. \n\nThe Dungeness Crab Egg's Benedict was good too. The crab meat was light and flavorful and was fresh! Usually the seafood taste can overwhelm a dish but this one complimented the rest of it well. Next time i come i'd like to try dungeness crab in an omelette form! \n\nThe Monte Cristo held good flavor too. I felt the portion size was good because any more than the 4 wedges given could of become too rich.

The omelette was good, but monte cristo was the best dish out of the two.  I believe what made the monte cristo so amazingly delicious was the jam.  The discovery of the jam definitely made the long wait worth it all.  It wasn't too sweet and had nice bits of fruit in it.  We were told all their jam is made in-house and you can even order it online from their website!  Definitely a must try in SF.", "author": "Stephanie T."}

After trying to go to Mama's once, I thought I'd give it a go seeing how I'm local and find out what all the hype is about. I went on a friday at 11am, and had to wait 2 hours before even placing my order. We had the Huevos Rancheros and the Mama's special breakfast sandwich, which the cashier said were a couple of the best items on the menu (also they only take cash or debit[$1 additional charge]). The food was fine, nothing special. The sandwich bread was soft and the black beans were cooked well, everything else was pretty standard brunch affair.\n\nSave yourself a lot of time and go to Bottle Cap just across the park - much better food and no wait.\n\nI honestly think this place has simply gone viral and the reviews are totally out of proportion. Also, what food doesn't taste good after waiting 2 hours??? Everyone inside was staring at their smartphone instead of talking to one another, which makes me this these high reviews are simply based off empty internet hype.

We decided to order three of the most popular dishes for the two of us (we knew this was gonna be wayyyy too much food....) and my mouth started to salivate in anticipation as we were seated. \n\n1) Dungeness Crab Benedict - 1/5\nI was looking forward to this dish the most. I LOVE crab, and I LOVE eggs benedict, so this one seemed like a no brainer. But I was sorely disappointed. The poached egg was overcooked, and the hollandaise sauce was mediocre. I for one love runny yolk all over the place that I can sop up with some extra bread (or just lick off the plate). The poached eggs here are cooked so that there is none of that delicious, golden, messy yolk. I secretly glanced at the Eggs Benedict that the parties next to us ordered, and their eggs were cooked the same way. Maybe this is the way that Mama's prefers to cook their poached eggs, or maybe the chefs just accidentally cooked the eggs too long, but either way, a big fat thumbs down on this dish. I'd rather take the crab separately and eat it on its own.\n\n2) Monte Cristo - 4/5\nThe concept behind a Monte Cristo has always seemed so strange to me - sweet and salty mixed together. A cross between a ham/turkey sandwich and french toast. Thus, I have never ordered it before, afraid to be wasting my money and calories on something I wouldn't like. I was pleasantly surprised by this dish! Though this french toast sandwich thing seems to be theoretically so wrong on so many levels, it's actually quite enjoyable. Two opposites put together = perfection. Kind of like Ron and Hermione. (Any Harry Potter fans out there?)\n\n3) French Toast Sampler - 2/5\nDecent. Though I've definitely had better french toast elsewhere. It comes with one piece of cranberry, cinnamon, and blueberry french toast, topped with fresh blueberries, strawberries, and bananas. Nothing spectacular. \n\nThis place wouldn't be a bad option for brunch if the lines weren't so horrendous, and if you happened to be in the area. But granted that people wait 1-2 hours on average, and that there are so many better brunch options in wonderful San Francisco, I would skip on going to Mama's.\n\n\nSorry Mama's, but I'm not a fan. :(", "author": "Sally T."}

We woke up early, waited in line and ate it all up.\n\nBrief Summary\n-- Get here early like 730am\n-- Expect to WAIT\n-- Their system works (it's so simple it's complicated lol)\n-- Research the menu and KNOW what you want so you're ready\n-- Great friendly service\n-- Mom and Pop status\n\nAfter much hype, the GF and I made it to Mama's. I was the one lagging and not getting up as soon as I should have. Even still, we got there somewhat early and ended up being the first people to wait for a table.\n\nTheir system is simple. You wait in line outside. You wait in line inside and watch them cook other people's food. You order your food, pay and you wait for a table. Once you sit down, your food is basically ready. You eat, leave a tip and the cycle repeats.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n-- Scrambled Florentine\nThis is what I got. Crispy bacon, spinach, onions and white cheddar. Home fries/potatoes. Orange wedge. Sourdough baguette toasted with butter. There was great balance in my dish. It wasn't the best breakfast I ever ate but it was definitely delicious, fresh and satisfying.\n\n-- French Toast Sampler\nShared this with the GF. We had to try it since everyone and their mother is getting it and putting it on their yelp reviews. There were 3 slices, a bunch of fruit, powdered sugar, an orange wedge and some syrup. I think I liked 2 out of 3. One in particular was a bit too fibrous for me and consistency wasn't very \"french toast\"-ish.\n\n-- Dungeness Crab Eggs Benedict\nThe GF ordered this. She said it was very filling. It had a lot of crab (explains the $20 price tag) and it was delicious. I'm not a big fan of seafood so I didn't try it. \n\nWaitstaff was very attentive and friendly. A lot of people seem to know the staff. I really liked the \"home\" feeling here at Mama's. Definitely enjoyed the breakfast.

We hopped into our place in line and it continued to grow... and grow... and grow... and by the time we were seated, about 45minutes-1hour later, the line was stretching down the block. \n\nSo that's advise #1: get there early.\n\nA friend got the French Toast with Berries, and another friend and I split the French Toast Sampler and Dungeness Crab Omelet with Brie and Avocado (on the special menu).  Everything was excellent.  The french toast was made with three different types of bread, grilled to perfection.  The omelet was filled to the brim with crab, brie, and avocado.  Yum yum yum!  Don't forget to serve yourself generous servings of the homemade jam placed on each table... it's really good on both plain toast and french toast.   Friends tell me that the Eggs Benedict and the Monte Cristo are both very good too. \n\nWhich leads me to advice #2: if going for the first time go with friends and order different dishes so you can taste everything (it is a bit of a hassle to come here after all, with the long wait and what not.)\n\nBut if you come here and find a super long line, and you feel like your stomach is going to eat itself because it's so hungry, and you can't fathom how you are going to wait two hours, fear not!  \n\nAdvice #3:  Go across the street and buy focaccia bread from the Liguria Bakery.  I recommend the cinnamon raisin or pizza.  Ask them to cut it up for you.  It's less than $5, decent portion, and the perfect snack to munch on as you wait.\n\nOne more advice:  They only take cash/debit, and they charge $1 on all debit card transactions so bring cash!", "author": "Michelle P."}

We didn't make it in on the first seating at 8am, and ended up having to wait close to an hour. Just to recap, we waited for an hour at 8 am on a Thursday....\n\nBut the food did not disappoint. We had: \nNorthwest Omelet (smoked salmon). The omelet was great, but what was even better was the daily jam on the toast. The jam - some berry I didn't recognize - was delicious.\nCranberry-Orange French Toast with berries (cranberry walnut bread, battered in egg whites) - SO GOOD. Seriously, you might not expect french toast made from cranberry walnut bread to taste good, but it was superb. Plus the bread had come right out of the oven when we got there so we knew it was fresh. \nWe also split a piece of coffee cake which was amazing, probably because by the time we got in we were ravenous. \n\nThe food was hands down a 5 but the wait is just absurd and brings down the overall score significantly.

I really don't get why everyone has such fantastically astronomical things to say about this establishment.  It's just ok...if that at all.  \n\nWe arrived a bit before 8 and began to wait in line.  For a place that is so popular and has such a following, you would figure they would be thankful to their customers by not making them wait outside in the rain.  It's not like they were even busily preparing anything they were all kind of just standing around looking for something to do.  I mean come on, you can't open your doors 5 minutes early when you see a line full of people waiting in the pouring rain???  That's just ungratefulness for your good luck of returning customers if you ask me.  Not only did they make everyone stand out in the rain, they made us wait 5 minutes after the establishment was supposed to be open.   \n\nSo as we were freezing our bun-zo's off, they finally opened their doors.  A normal person would expect cheerfulness and politeness when walking in, but I guess we should have dined somewhere else for that.  We reached the counter to order and the guy taking the orders didn't even look up and acknowledge us.  I get so upset when people in customer service act like you're bothering them.  I just waited in the rain for 20 minutes, the least you could do is pick your head up and smile at me and act like you want my business!!\n\nThe waitress, however, was very pleasant.  I would give her 5 stars.  The food, eh, not so great.  Seriously, it would have been just as good at Denny's without dropping 25 bucks for two people.  We had an omelet and french toast with potatoes.  It tasted like french toast that I could have made at home with regular bread.  The best part of our meal was the homemade raspberry jam on toast.  Hard to believe but yes, this was the best part.\n\nI guess what I've learned from this experience is beware of the establishments with raving reviews and lines.  I mean really at some point I guess they convince themselves they don't have to be nice, courteous or of superb quality if there's always a line of people waiting to eat there.  I guess they get in the mentality that they're doing you a favor by selling you food instead of appreciating the fact that they have been fortunate enough to stay in business.  If I had waited 60 minutes like other people, I would have been super upset.  I know, for sure, I will not go back and I will never recommend the establishment to anyone.", "author": "Victoria R."}

I've never had an average meal here and I've been there early, mid-morning and right during the lunch rush.  \n\nThis is not a place to stretch out and sit for hours while you languish over your meal.  There is a continual line from before opening until they close shop.  It feels crowded (and is) and after you stuff yourself you feel a need to get up and walk it off.  During a visit in April 2012, I noticed that George Lucas skipped the line and got in the back door.  He was still sitting in his corner perch when my party was finally seated.  Apparently there are different rules when you produce billion-dollar movies.  \n\nMy favorite is still the Monte Cristo sandwich dipped in their homemade jam.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-27", "description": "After sleeping for only three hours the previous night, I was still determined to eat breakfast at Mama's. I've heard good things and I wasn't about to miss it because I slept in on a Saturday. I guess parking is pretty hard to come by around Washington Square so if you find a meter, bring plenty of coins as the max time is only one hour (however, we got it to go to 1:07, but anything over that is a waste of your quarters, trust me). When we got here a little past 8:30, there was already a long line stretching along the restaurant. I guess this place is popular with both locals and tourists alike so be prepared to rub elbows with rude foreign tourists. The wait was a little more than half an hour to get inside.\n\nWhen I stepped inside, the first thing I noticed was that this place is TINY. I guess to make things more efficient, you pay for your food first and then you get seated and served. It's nice because you get to see into the kitchen and the side next the register is also lined with pastries and baked goods. We ended up order way too much food and I was stuffed beyond capacity. We got four plates and basically shared everything family-style:\n\nMonte Cristo - This is only on their lunch menu, but when you are a regular, I guess they make exceptions. This sandwich alone gives this place five stars. Whoever invented this is a genius. Ham, turkey, cheddar, Havarti cheese stuffed between three slices of French toast with a side of homemade blackberry jam. Perfect balance of sweet and savory. I think this even trumps the eggs Benedict that I usually get. \n\nShrimp and Avocado Benedict with Grilled Tomatoes - Your standard poached egg with Hollandaise sauce but with a generous helping of Bay shrimp and also avocado and a grilled tomato all on top of an English muffin. Delicious.\n\nSmoked Salmon Benedict - Same as above except replace with smoked salmon. It is a bit on the salty side, but goes well with the bland taste of the egg. \n\nPan Dore - This was probably not good for me at all. French baguette toasted with slices of sauteed apples drenched in lemon butter sauce. It was more like pure butter. If you have a heart condition, you should probably not eat this. One bite was enough, but anymore than that is a bit much. \n\nI should note that everything at this place tastes good with the homemade blackberry jam. Potatoes too dry? Dip it in the jam. Pan Dore too buttery? Dip it in the jam. Great place to have breakfast if you can find the time and if you have the patience to wait. I would definitely come just to try the Monte Cristo.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

Once in Nashville at Pancake Pantry and once in NYC at a cute place in SOHO years ago.  Both were well worth it; but when I saw the line in front of Mama's I was skeptical.  The people towards the front mentioned that they had been waiting almost an hour-and-a-half, and advised that we should do the same.  They had been there before and said it was the best breakfast we will ever have.  Now, I am not sure I believed them at the time, but I did like the challenge.  I was pretty hungry, so sitting in this line would be like having some serious control over myself that I usually do not exert.  \n\nWhen I'm hungry, I gotta eat.   \n\nBut I did it.....with the help of a leftover piece of saltwater taffy I had in my backpack from my trip to Sausalito the previous day.   And let me tell you, my friends, it was well worth it.  I hear from other reviews that it depends on what you end up ordering, but from what I saw, every dish looked amazing.  The presentation was impeccable (and I like my food to look good AND taste good - makes a big difference to me, anyway).  When my Chocolate french toast with bananas and strawberries finally made it to my table, my jaw hit the floor.  It was a masterpiece....and I gave it the respect it deserved by eating every....last.......bite.\n\nI have posted a picture of this delight, so please check it out; and let it convince you that the 2 hour wait will be worth every stomach-growling second..", "author": "Arpana W."}

Forget the syrup altogether, the jam is amazing and I regret not trying it before I'd eaten most of my pancakes. And this is from a syrup lover. \n\nFirst off the bat: is it worth the wait? Mmmmnotreally but kind of. If you've never been, go once. If there's almost no line, go. Otherwise, it's not worth it. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the food is excellent, the atmosphere charming, and the employees professional and kind. But I waited 96 minutes in the rain for pancakes. That's just not worth it more than once. \n\n Tried the blueberry pancakes and they were fluffy, with tons of real blueberries inside and out. They were served hot but with chilled blueberries on top which added a nice contrast and kept it light. I made the mistake of eating most of them with syrup before trying the jam. The jam was wonderful, sweet and tart, and it cuts the heaviness of pancakes wonderfully. Highly recommend it. \n\nIt's a great little spot and if you didn't have to wait so long it would be flat out incredible. I should mention, the wait is purely because of the quantity of people wanting service. Mama's service is lightning fast and works like a well-oiled machine. \n\nGo if you've never been or if you're lucky enough to arrive when there are 15 or fewer people waiting outside.", "author": "Michael W."}

It was certainly worth the cab ride and wait time. The morning was beautiful, cool and crisp a big change from our humid Florida mornings so standing outside was a nice change.\n\nWe got here somewhat early, around 8:00 am-ish and were quickly schooled in the protocal of wait your turn! :) Upon arriving I noticed a handfull of people standing outside in a group and saw a line of folks standing in line inside the restaurant. Not knowing what to do, I walked right into the place and immediately got scolded nicely in broken English, to wait outside, no problem I thought so I walked back outside and the same waiter/host comes outside and barks orders to everyone to line up along the wall fronting the place......OK, I thought, this is going to be an interesting experience.\n\nAfter standing there a few minutes and doing my typical observation of what's up, I figured it out. You wait outside until a table or two clears, then your invited inside to stand in line again to order your food. Once your food is ordered your directed to a table by the same dude who barks orders at you outside. Once your food is cooked, its brought to you by a really sweet waitress who makes you forget about the dude who barked at you twenty minutes earlier because your a tourist who does not know the rules.....Oh well!\n\nBut wait, there is more! The food is amazing! I got the corned beef with eggs benedict, I know, corned beef and eggs benedict is kind of an oxy-moron but so what, it tasted amazing and the corned beef was by far some of the best I ever tasted. I was so engrossed in my my meal that I forgot what my wife ordered, but whatever it was it must have been good because when I finally came up for air, her plate was nearly empty.\n\nThe service is good once you get in the door, the place is quaint and charming, and it is also very clean. It has a huge following among locals and tourists like myself and the entire time we were there, the line which got up to twenty plus at times never let up. I suggest you bring a grande latte and a granola bar to tie you over while waiting in line!.:)\n\nPrice is reasonable too and we will certainly come back the next time we are in town and this time, I know the rules! :)", "author": "Bruce M."}

Have to say I liked everything from start to finish (sans the LONG wait outside). \n    \n     So the wait outside wasn't unbearable. It was a warm January day midday, and the line wasn't more than an hour long for us, but I DID have to grab a bagel from a nearby shop to help pass the time.  Once you get close to the front of the line, you can see the meny and choose what you want before getting inside. Once inside, you have about 5-10 minutes to order your food, and pay before being placed at a table.  This I do like, and their food was good enough, I'm sure they rarely get asked for a refund! After waiting about another 10 minutes, a table was free, and we (4 of us) were seated. \n    \n     Brunch drinks are always iffy with me. I'm not a fan of alcohol or wine, and usually any drink I get sits on the table as I strategically take a few  forced sips, just to ensure the drink wasn't a total waste of money.  I ordered the \"Apple/Peach Bellini\"and I really enjoyed. One friend had the \"Papa's Picnic Brunch\" and I enjoyed that as well. Nice to know I (with my sensitive to alcohol tongue) can have a fruity alcoholic beverage, and not walk away wishing I hadn't spent the $8+ bucks on a drink that I didn't come close to finishing (fyi, the drink was only $7). \n \n     For my meal, I had the \"Dungeness Crab Benedict With Fresh Spinach\", which was FRIGGIN' delicious! The crab wasn't imitation, eggs benedict cooked just right, and spinach sauteed lovely! I ate the sucker up, and wished I could have another (maybe the bagel wasn't worth it?!). Can't remember what everyone else ordered, but everyone enjoyed their meals as well, except one friend who ordered the shrimp salad. She felt the dressing made the salad very oily. \n\n    I also ordered an apple crumb cake from the bakery, which was pretty good. Wish they could've thrown some vanilla icecream on top of that, and THAT would've made my Sunday!\n\n   All in all, this was a more than decent place to have brunch. The decor is very \"homey\" deserving the name \"Mama's\" (LoL) and I spent about $35, but I walked away more than satisfied. I wanted to give the place 4 stars because I would absolutely go back, but I'd have to be in a REALLY good mood (and have had to have a small snack beforehand) to wait on that line.

Everyone has already said great things so why don't I go through a more practical view of this restaurant.\n\nFirst, GO EARLY. They open at 8, go at 7:30am or even earlier. That outside line can be at least an hour wait. And that is only the OUTSIDE line. They hang a menu by the door so you can decide on what you want by the time you get inside. They keep the front door closed so that no one can bunch up on the inside.\n\nOnce you get in, you will wait on ANOTHER line, the ordering line. This line moves faster than the one on the outside. However, only the first few people get to order. Until those people move for a table (which is another wait), you have more time to look at the menu.\n\nOnce you are seated, the foot comes pretty soon as you had already ordered probably about 10-15 minutes before.\n\nI had the french toast sampler and it was AMAZING. The homemade jam was definitely great for the toast, even better than the syrup. My friend had the breakfast sandwich which was also equally good.\n\nFor the bathroom, there will be yet ANOTHER line (yikes). Most tables sit about 2-4. There are two booths that can sit more than that but larger groups may be a bit longer wait.\n\nI loved my experience at Mama's. It felt like such an accomplishment just to be able to get inside the door!

Waiting 1+ hours for this place is considered a short wait, and if you go on a bad day/time, get ready to spend upwards of 2.5 hours sitting in line for a mediocre meal at gourmet prices.\n\nI guess this just goes to show how effective marketing ploys can be... if you have so little seating that people have to stand out in line, the American public will be fooled into thinking that it is worth standing out in line, attracting more people. Then the cycle repeats. Well played Mama's, well played.", "author": "Nick M."}

Our friends were with us & they ordered the cranberry French toast & the Crab Eggs Benedict with spinach. We all shared this amazing spread. \n    The florentine scramble did not disappoint. It was perfect! It had a little bit of bacon, a little bit of cheese, a little bit of mushrooms & a few slices of red onions. The eggs Benedict was surprisingly wonderful. The banana nut French toast was a perfect sweet satisfier.  The only thing that I didn't care for was the cranberry French toast, but my friend loved her order. The service was great. Everyone was super friendly, helpful & accommodating. Our grand total for 5 entrees & 3 coffees was $78. Pretty good!\n   The carrot cake was calling to us, so we got a couple of pieces to go for later when our food went down. It ended up being much later, as we remained stuffed til way after lunch time. It ended up being our after dinner dessert. Very moist! \n  My only regret was not having tasted their homemade jam.

Tasty crust on each slice - you can still see the egg it was dipped in before being griddled. Pancakes are thick and fluffy, 3 stacked beautifully on top of each other. You can eat them plain without any berries and they'd still be great. Omelette was stuffed FULL of bacon and mushrooms. Very tasty. You got a bit of everything and all it's flavors in each bite.

And the hype wasn't wrong, but not entirely right either. It wasn't phenomenal but I wasn't disappointed either. Came here with my boyfriend on a Wednesday around 1 and there was no wait at all, lucky for us. So you enter and order at the cashier before you get a table. There's probably around 15 tables in the whole place, biggest table sits about 4-5 people. Giving the place a homey feeling. I had the Norwegian Benedict (smoked salmon) and my boyfriend had the corned beef hash Benedict. Both dishes were good but I think my smoked salmon was a little over cooked. Both plates went for about $13.75 each and the wtf moment for me was our small orange juices that went for $3.50 each, I literally finished that thing in 5 gulps! It was like an oversized shot glass. Too pricey if you ask me. Also, wear a sweater if you plan on going here, they have the entrance  doors open as well as multiple fans blowing full speed down on you.

Three different style breads covered in blueberries, strawberries & sliced bananas.  All were good, especially the cranberry.  \n\nDungeness Crab Benedict - 2 stars ($21.95)\nTasty, but for that price it was pretty darn skimpy on the crab.  Eggs were too wet from poaching and made the bread soggy.  The Hollandaise Sauce was good, but a bit tart and thicker than others.  Home Fried Potatoes were good:  Crispy on outside & tender on inside.  (NOTE: their other Benedicts are about half the Crab price.)\n\nService - 3 stars\n* Efficient & no nonsense.

I'm ashamed to say this but I have ordered Monte Cristo three times and I've only been here 3 times! We also had the Slim Joe Burger ($9.50). Wow, this was also very tasty. They seasoned the burger meat really well and I love the choice of using baguette instead of regular burger buns.\n\nI enjoyed my $3.95 (large glass but really? It feels time in my hand!) Fresh Squeezed Grapefruit juice but seriously, it is overpriced! In my opinion, all of the beverages here are overpriced.

Right across the street from Washington Square Park in North Beach, sits Mama's, a rather small establishment known for their \"to die for\" breakfast. I planned today to brunch with my cousin, and had her wait in line while I Barted in. She wrote me a text, \"hurry, where are you, there's no line, oh wait, it was hiding,it is long\".\n\nThe line wasn't terrible, but the cold weather certainly made it seem like \"forever\". The longest I have ever waited for food was in New York, SoHo: Dominque Ansel's Cronut - three hours in line was certainly \"forever\". My cousin and I, as well as other patient guests, stared inside as people ate and we drooled for their food. We came hungry! I arrived at 9:30AM and we were let inside to the warmth at around 11. Be sure to come prepared, because there are no menus at the tables. Upon entering the restaurant, you are directed to the registers, and once you order, you will then be seated. It is very organized! The one let down, which will not be reflected in the star rating, is the unavailability for credit card transactions, which was startling because it is the new age. What's interesting is that, I called ahead to make sure what forms of payments they take, though they take debit cards, credit cards are of another story. I think if an establishment is able to process debit cards, credit cards are no different (maybe with a small fee, but I think it's necessary). Service was prompt, fast, and the servers were accommodating. \n\nOn to the food: I ordered (1) Dungeness Crab Benedict [fresh lump crab meat, poached eggs, spinach, hollandaise, english muffins, and grilled potatoes] - WOW, delicious, well prepared, and with ACTUAL CRAB MEAT, MMMMMMM! (2) Smoked Salmon Benedict [smoked salmon, poached eggs, and english muffins] - my cousin gobbled it up! We shared (3) Kugelhopf French Toast [house made Kugelhopf, dates, almonds, raisins, and maple syrup] - YUM! It was a bit dry, somewhat caky, so make sure you drizzle some maple syrup (drench it!) and it'll taste superb! And (4) Monte Cristo [turkey breast, honey baked ham, cheddar and gruyere cheese, and grilled potatoes] - It was more on the sweet side with the jam, but once you cut into the filling, it's \"heaven in bread\", simply \"delicious\". (5) I drank some bubbly - Ruby Grapefruit Mimosa [refreshing!], and my cousin had (6) Mama's Smoothie [bananas, berries, orange juice, yogurt, and honey] - a great combination for a light and delicious drink. \n\nThis restaurant is a \"must go\" for those who love breakfast, and brunch! It is absolutely \"worth the wait\".", "author": "Alex C."}

Delectable, impossible, eyes-roll-back-in-head perfection.\n\nThose are the descriptors coming from a person who usually does not fawn over brunches, but may now have to rethink.\n\nMy friends and I came here on a weekday around 1 p.m. and were fortunate to wait for only about 15 minutes to get in. I had heard rave reviews on this restaurant, so I couldn't be more excited to be invited into the place so quickly and was thankful for my lucky stars that day.\n\nSo in what sweet and savory goodness did I indulge? First, I shared a sampler platter of thick pillowy French Toast, which included the Banana Nut and two other fruity flavors I cannot remember. They came sprawled on a large white plate topped with freshly cut strawberries, blueberries, and bananas, and were so delicious and spongy soft that I felt they could almost melt in my mouth.\n\nAlso, I had a plate of the Blackstone Eggs Benedict, which I savored to very last molecule. This dish could honestly produce an embarrassing reaction of salivation from me at the mere thought of it, any time, any place. The Hollandaise sauce which smothered the layers of crisp cut bacon and thick poached eggs was simply to-die-for (and probably would in large enough quantity!). Each bite sent me into fits of pleasure, as the ingredients blended together perfectly yet still retained enough of their individual flavors to surprise the taste buds every so often. Although the French Toast was gratifying, I much preferred the Eggs Benedict for its more colorful favor and texture. The side dish of well-seasoned potatoes which accompanied the Eggs Benedict were delicious as well.\n\nOverall, this was a wonderful first-time experience with a restaurant whose hype is actually very well earned! Reasonable prices for taste satisfaction beyond compare - who could ask for more?", "author": "Amy T."}

Even if we had been able to walk straight in, I would not have been impressed.\n\nI tried the crab benedict, the crab breakfast sandwich, and the french toast sampler.\n\nCrab benedict was about $21. It was fine. Nothing special. Not memorable. (I am an eggs benedict aficionado.) The best eggs ben I've had so far are the lobster eggs benedict at 25 Lusk ($19, polished atmosphere, no wait). The eggs ben at Lynn & Lu's Escapade Cafe in Oakland (~$10, sweet friendly service from cute girls) and Boulevard Cafe in Daly City (~$10) are also high on my list. I know the crab in Mama's raises the price, but... it didn't raise my level of enjoyment.\n\nCrab breakfast sandwich: This was pretty good. The bread was a lot softer and fluffier than I expected. I enjoyed it more than my eggs ben. Not sure how much it cost. \n\nFrench toast sampler: Good! You should order this.\n\nScrewdriver: Made with soju. It was really good. The OJ to soju ratio was perfect. It was strong but also had a strong orange flavor.\n\nService: Lackluster. Not rude, but not really service at all...\n\nCashier was more focused on the game than the customers. He took our order well but I overheard that he forgot something from another table's order.\n\nOur server didn't really do anything. He brought our drinks and food to our table and never came by or made eye contact with us again.

We ( 2 of us) waited at least an hour to be seated, but judging from the other reviews that might  be the norm for this place. You have to choose your meal before you sit down so I suggest you look at the menu and specials on the window outside when you have the chance if you can be indecisive. The price was decent for the quality of food (around 12-25 for a plate-charge a dollar extra for credit card use).  Food came out fairly quickly (maybe a 7-10min wait) finished in 30 mins.

Not only am I excited that I got to eat at Mama's, but now that I have been through this experience...I get to write a review!\n\nI've been waiting to try Mama's forever, and I will say that I am not disappointed at all. Is there usually a long wait? Yes. Is it worth it? Pretty darn close. However, I knew this beforehand so that did not bother me at all. \n\nA good tip to know is that the waiter service isn't like your typical one. Yes, there are people that bring your food to you, however, you actually pay for your entire meal before you sit down. It does make it a lot easier to just get up and go about your day when you're done because you don't have to wait for someone to bring you your bill and for them to cash you out. \n\nI really wanted to dungeness crab benedict since I thought it would be super drool worthy. Alas, that did not work out for me since that piece of heaven was about $21.50, and I just couldn't justify spending that much on a benny, especially when they had about 10 other ones to choose from. I ended up getting the smoked salmon benny, which was AHmazing. The salmon was super rich but not heavy, and adding the avocado to it added just the right amount of that something that I was looking for. \n\nGot a carrot cake to-go for the bf since he was at home, and I knew he would probably want something from Mama's. The cake itself was pretty good, however, at times the texture was a bit off, but the taste was still there. The frosting, though, was absolutely creamy, dreamy, and delicious. I kinda cheated and whilst sharing with him turned into a frosting hog. It was so good that he called me out several times, whoops. :)\n\nTo top everything off I got a drink, mimosa to be exact, at brunch, of course. However, I noticed they had two kinds of mimosas, the regular OJ, and another one that I've never seen paired with champagne...grapefruit! Interesting! I had to get it! I asked them to put more champagne than grapefruit, and wow...hit the spot. I seriously loved my grapefruit mimosa. So refreshing. So delicious. So addictive. Trust me, get it.

There MUST be something good at the end of this madness....\n\n...lo and behold, there's wonderful food just inside the door. But after you get in another line to  order, and then into one more line to wait for a table. During this torturous waiting period and smelling the beautiful brunch smells, I think I actually started to drool. We finally got seated, and it was even more painful! The food took a while to come out, so we just had to watch everyone around us scarf down their food. It was hard to just sit there and not try to steal a bite from our neighboring table. \n\nFINALLY. The time came. The food has arrived!!! We got the French Toast Sampler, the Monte Cristo and the Eggs Benedict. The Monte wasn't quite my taste and I've definitely had better eggs bennys in my life, but the FRENCH TOAST SAMPLER is to die for. Or, at least worth the wait. Each slice is different and absolutely amazing. That dish alone made me forget about my standing-in-line-for-hours blues.

We came here Sunday morning and after finally finding parking, we saw how long the line was. Our total wait time was about 1.5 hours until we finally got seated. Unfortunately we got seated by the windows where everyone was standing outside and would clearly stare at you while you eat, hoping you would hurry up so they would be seated. While the place offers many different types of foods ranging from scrambles, omelettes, benedicts, waffles, pancakes, etc, the wait was really not worth it. I felt the flavors although good, were not outstanding and was not distinctive enough from other places to make me want to stay in line again for another 1.5 hours. I felt I could eat the same food with the same quality at other places that are also very good with a much shorter wait. Brunch is a very popular meal, especially in San Francisco so I must say, I have more restaurants in mind to go to more brunch rather than this one. I must highlight that the flavors were great and we did leave satisfied with the quality of the food. However we did not enjoy having to wait so long to be seated and not being able to enjoy our meal and take our time because of the rapid turnover of tables that was needed in order to seat as many parties as possible.", "author": "Wendy Z."}

My advice is that if you haven't tried it, give it a try because the food is good.  But it's definitely not somewhere you want to visit often unless you like waiting in line.  On a Saturday afternoon around 1pm, I waited about 45 minutes.  There's practically a line until they close.  So there isn't a dead time where you can go and avoid the line. \n\nAlso, you can't order to go either unless you wait in line.  So that kind of sucks.  If there were no line, I would visit Mama's more often because there's awesome breakfast/brunch food! \n\nTip: Try to use the bathroom before coming here because to get to the bathroom, you have to go through part of the kitchen, which is kind of awkward.

I would not wait 2 hours again - maybe one hour max, but then i'd have to show up at 7am (yes, 7! the place opens at 8am, but i heard the line starts forming even before that). I probably won't be back, but it doesn't look like Mama's will be hurting much without my business.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

Once you got inside the Indiana Jones queue, you had to wait another 20 minutes in line until you watched that stupid Indiana Jones safety video. Then once you got past THAT line, then you moved on to THE NEXT LINE which actually got you onto the ride! And after the ride was done- you loved it! The Indiana Jones ride was so much fun, it made all that waiting in line well worth it!  \n\nWelcome to Mama's in San Francisco!\n\nLine upon line, more waiting after more waiting- If you're going to Mama's then you probably already have a good idea what you're getting yourself into. Straight up- Mama's is delicious, and that's the truth. Is it worth spending half of your morning waiting in line for? That's for you to decide...\n\nFrench toast is so awesome- I recommend trying the 'French Toast Sampler'. The bread is kinda, well, bready- but they fuse the flavors into the bread so well, truly better than any other french toast I've had.. When eating the French Toast you'll feel like Willy Wonka \"The Banana toast tastes like Bananas! The Cinnamon toast tastes like Cinnamon! The Snozberry toast tastes like Snozeberries!\"\n\nAlso, the Eggs Benedict are made to perfection. Last time I went I ordered the Shrimp Benedict- check it out:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?userid=-4BEUkLvHQntN6qPfKJP2w  Absolutely delicious- so freakin good. The potatoes are kinda dry, but no biggie.

Honestly, I have never ordered anything off the menu that I didn't like.

One of my favorite parts about the restaurant is when you enter (right before you order your food) you get to see the cooks preparing the food you're about to eat. There's also a nice spread of the meat, like dungeoness crab and shrimp, along with fresh vegetables. \n\nIf someone was holding a gun to my head and asked me to pick my favorite main at Mama's I would say the shrimp egg's Benedict. For a side, I would definitely recommend the carrot cake. The food is so damn tasty. \n\nMy only dislike about the restaurant is the price; however, I've decided that some things in life are just worth it. \n\nA LARGE piece of advice for anyone visiting Mama's would be to arrive before 9AM.

Luckily it was a nice day and the sun was shining. \n\nWe ordered the Mama's French Toast Sampler so we could try a little bit of everything (Banana Nut, Swedish Cinnamon, Orange-Cranberry). It was topped with lots of fresh berries and bananas and a side of maple syrup. My favorite was the banana nut, which was a slice of banana nut bread dipped in the egg bath then grilled to perfection. I took one bite with the maple syrup and the rest with their homemade jam! Next we had the Blackstone Benedict since this place is known for their benedicts. It was quite delicious and they did not hold back on the crispy bacon...MmMm! Our friend ordered the Smoked Salmon Scramble, which came with potatoes and an bagel. He said it was pretty good, but could live without the tomatoes in it. Besides sharing the french toast sampler with my bestie, Alice L., we also go the Southwest Omelete with the habanero sausage (not spicy folks).

We stayed in the Inn across the street.  We got up at around 7.  Mama's doesn't open until 8 AM on Sunday.  We noticed, however, a line forming at about 7:10AM.  We thought, hey probably just early birds.  But the line kept growing, so we took a hint and rushed down to get in line. Good thing too.  Before they opened, the line was over two blocks long.  But the place is small.  So, to make a long story short, if you arrive at least 30 min before they open, you will get right in.  If not, your in for a long wait. \n\nWhen they open, you walk up to a counter, place your order, then find a seat.  My wife had the french toast sampler, and is still raving about it.  Apparently the \"sampler\" refers to the fact that they use four different breads to prepare the dish.  I had the dungeness crab omlette with havarti.  Oh man, was it good.  Coffee was stellar, and service was awesome.  The atmosphere was sublime.  \n\nThe tables are close, so you can't help striking up a conversation with neighboring tables, and by the time we were done, it felt like having a meal with old friends.

The muffin under the poached eggs are so good too! The Monte Cristo is one of their signature dishes, so you have to try it once here! The chocolate cinnamon french toast is also very delicious, topped with fresh fruits and a side of maple syrup.

My Mama's virginity was taken away today. Wait, that came out wrong. Anywhooo.....the wait is so fucdfsidofjsoidfijing ridiculous. Stood in line for 2 hours on a freakin' weekday, like who works anymore right? Or maybe these people take entire days off for a nice brunch.\n\nThe Monte Cristo with the homemade jam (seemed like boysenberry) was a nice combination of sweet and salty to go with the foolproof egginess of a classic french toast. Unlike anything I've ever tried, that dish itself deserves 5 stars for originality, 3.5 stars for taste.\n\nThe North Beach (eggs benedict with prosciutto and grilled tomatoes) was one component short of amazing, and this is what really prevents Mama's from getting that last star. THE POACHED EGGS WERE ALMOST COMPLETELY OVERCOOKED. Poked into them expecting perfectly runny yolks given that this place specializes in breakfast, but sadly, it was almost completely solid. Luckily I'm not the type to completely be turned off by a dish when one thing goes wrong, so overall it still tasted amazing given that nice smokiness of the prosciutto and perfectly grilled tomatoes.\n\nSo was it worth the wait? It honestly depends on how much you enjoy a nice brunch. For me, I'd much rather wait that long for dim sum.\n\n\nTL;DR\nOne of the best brunches in SF if you're willing to stand in line for 1-2 hours EVEN ON A WEEKDAY.", "author": "Vincent C."}

My brothers were in town from (sd & la) and one of them really wanted to try this place since he had heard such great things about it from his coworker and wanted a taste for himself. \n\n5 of us hopped our way over to North Beach where parking is usually treacherous but we were able to find parking 3 blocks down. \n\nTips for Mama's: \n*Expect a wait. 1.5 hours to be exact.. If you're terribly hungry or have no patience forget about it, (unless you come during odd hours). The line did seem shorter as we left the place after we finished brunch around 2pm. Mama's is open till 3pm. \n\n*This place is small and basically is first come first serve. You inch through the line at a snail's pace. Luckily when you get in you can order your food and pay for it before you are seated at a table. \n\n*What to order: french toast sampler was pretty tasty for those who want something sweet but our favorite was the dungeness crab omelet and the mama's fried egg with sausage (it's one of the specials can't remember the name). The crab omelet is pricey at $18.50 as was the dungeness crab benedict (lots of yummy crab but ultimately a little heavy). \n\n*Service was surprisingly good! Our waiter was very friendly and recommended the jam over the french toast. \n\n*Bathroom-teeny tiny. First you walk through the kitchen then outside, walk down a small flight of stairs and you have made it to your way to an outhouse with plumbing!

Didn't know he'd agree and we decided to drive by to see how long the wait was... When we drove by and saw that line we were like O.O ohhellnaaa (1.5-2 hr wait) Don't get me wrong i was STARVING at this point. So we decided to eat in Chinatown....but nothing sounded appealing after the thought of Mama's. So we ended up driving back and the said the wait was about 1- 1.5 hours. SO we waited in line -_____- for what felt like forever but really was about an hour so not too bad. \n\nI already knew what i wanted. I had been dying to try to Monte Cristo. I was conflicted btwn that and a Benedict because i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Benedicts.. but i knew my bf was going to get a Benedict so Monte Cristo it was! And when it came ... it was so beautiful. How I wished there were more than 4 triangles on the plate. Best choice ever. I had Monte Cristo before at another brunch place but this one does not compare. Their homemade jam definitely added some sweet kick to the sandwich. I'm no cheddar cheese fan and the sandwich had just the perfect amount -not too much but not too little. Words can't really describe how great this sandwich was. If there is another place that makes a better Monte Cristo than Mama's someone better tell me. I also tried my bf's Benedict - i don't remember the name but it had bacon. Not bad - but not really worth that wait time. He also enjoyed my sandwich. I quote - \"it's flavorful\" (he's a man of little words)\n\nAside from the yummy food, they also provide excellent customer service. Everyone is super friendly and accommodating. They didn't look annoyed or anything despite the chaos happening inside and outside their restaurant. Love it. I feel like customer services makes your food taste a little better (not sure why).

Seeing the long line outside made me want to give Mama's a try at least one since I have never ate here before even though I am a native San Franciscan. Got here on a Saturday morning at 10AM where it took about two hours to get inside the actual door to order. So I decided to get the Washington Square Omelette which consisted Sausages, Bell Pepper, Lumberjack Cheese, and Tomatoes served with Sourdough Bread and a side if Grilled Potatoes. The Omelette was the bomb, it was super delicious and was cooked to the right fluffy texture. To top it off, I chose their Sourdough Bread which went well with their homemade jam on the table. Their Grilled Potatoes were seasoned very well also very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Overall a good place to eat but the wait to get inside to order was ridiculously long as it is a very small restaurant. Would return later to try other items on their menu when I have the time to line up again.", "author": "Peter C."}

Thought the line would be shorter than on the weekend but apparently still at least an hour wait on the weekday. My hypothesis is that they make you wait so that you're so hungry, any food will taste good. Their food was decent but I wouldn't wait an hour again. Overloaded with sugar. Price was decent though. I wanted to get the Monte Cristo - I don't eat pork so I asked if they could exclude it or substitute something else. They said they refuse to make any changed to the items on their menu (what if someone is allergic??). I got the French toast sampler and boyfriend got monte cristo. Everything is just filled with sugar to make it taste good - even the things meant to be savory.", "author": "Japna S."}

This place could use some 1-stars anyway.\n\nWe finally got into the actual building to wait in another line which didn't take as long. It's just a line to get to the register and pay. We ordered our goods and we were directed towards an empty table. We got to an area where there were 2 empty tables. One table was in direct sunlight and by the entrance. The other table was neither of these. So naturally, we were interested in the better located table. We inquired to the waitress if it was alright if we sit in the better table and she firmly said \"NO\" without even looking at us. She didn't even say sorry and made sure to give some attitude.\nThis set a low mood for the rest of the dining experience. Furthermore, after a couple minutes, we think that she even knew she was being rude and she said aloud, towards us, \"it'll just be another Yelp review,\" implying that she knows we'll write something about her. So apparently she knows she is a terrible person and doesn't care. She is in customer service so her life depends on being nice to people. We didn't give any tip because she didn't deserve it. She is probably very unhappy with her job and doesn't make any money and has to take it out on other people. I would be mad too if I made crap money for the rest of my life. Who knows. Either way, she is a terrible person. She said her name is Kim. I hope that you don't get served by her because you might die of rudeness that will ruin your day.\n\nAnyway... You can easily see what to order here from the thousands of other reviews.\nAll I am going to say is that this joint is overrated for sure.\nDon't waste your time waiting more than 1 hour in line--come at a non-busy time if you absolutely must come here.", "author": "Marlon T."}

If you're like me than the hanger will make an appearance and it might make you want to leave the line and go somewhere else. Overall I'd say Mama's is good. The food is good, service is good, and the restaurant has a cute vibe. I tried really hard to not let the hanger impact my opinion on this review. \n\nFirst off the line is not a joke. We waited on line for 2 hours! We went for Sunday brunch so obviously that's prime time. They open at 8 am and I hear that people will line up as early as 7am to avoid the ridiculous line. We arrived at 8:30 and had to wait 2 hours so I'd recommend arriving well before they open to trim down your wait time.\n\nThe food is good. We ordered the monte crito (one of their most frequently ordered items), the northern m'omlette, and the french toast sampler. No complaints here. The food is very homey and delicious. Will it blow your mind? Probably not but it's definitely a solid meal. You can tell a lot of thought goes into the menu, and they make their own jam in house. A couple interesting things on the menu too.\n\nThe service is really good. They do a good job of keeping the people waiting on the line hydrated and will take your drink orders while you wait. Once you get inside the restaurant you have to wait on a shorter line and this is where the manager (?) will talk to you about the specials of the day and really give you an indepth overview of the menu and answer any questions you might have. This was probably my favorite part of my experience.\n\nThe restaurant seats about 35 people so it's small but not overly cramped. Overall, I thought Mama's provided good food, and great service. I would absolutely not wait another 2 hours now that I've had the food. I think you'll have a good meal too if you come here, you just have to weigh the cost benefit of the line before doing so.

I got to SF at 10 AM (my earliest brunch ever...) and had about a 45 minute wait.  The line moves pretty quickly and its surprising how fast the customer turnaround is. \n\nI have to say, the hype over Mama's kind of ruined it for me.  Everything was good and delicious, but I expected OUT OF THIS WORLD based on the line for this place.  I decided to order both the dungeness crab eggs benedict and french toast sampler b/c I'm a greedy eater.  I appreciated the chunky pieces of crab, but the eggs benedict weren't cooked perfectly...they were a little too overdone & not runny enough.  The french toast sampler was okay..my favorite by far was the cranberry one (the apple had too much cinnamon & sugar).  I also ordered the northern italian omelette, which I enjoyed but it also didn't rock my socks.  \n\nI'm glad to have finally tried this place for myself, but definitely wouldn't wait in line to go back.  It's close to coit tower, so I'd recommend taking a nice after-brunch stroll to get a good view of the city!", "author": "Chinh T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-12", "description": "This is a definite 4 star restaurant. There's ALWAYS a line rain or shine and this Thursday morning was definitely no exception. 45 minutes for a party of two and of course, I had to run across the street to nosh on some focaccia as I waited. I could hear from the conversations that most of the people in line were locals so I could only imagine what the line would be like on the weekends...(shudder.)\n\nSo after a 45 minute wait in the sunshine, my sister and I were finally called up to the coveted spot at the front doors to await the line to finally order food. Luckily, they post their specials on the window adjacent to said door and much like the ritual at the \"Soup Nazi's\", one should have their order ready and cash out. By the way, this place does NOT take credit cards in case you didn't notice but they will accept ATM debit cards with a slight fee. \n\nWe decided on the french toast sampler with fresh fruit and the Northern Italian with two cups of coffee. Mama's also serves fresh juices and mimosas with orange and grapefruit juice but I reserve alcohol for special occasions so I declined this time. The best part about standing in line forever is the line for the cash register. You're just a mere 6 inches from the actual kitchen and the scent of batter, fresh cake, muffins and sourdough tempt and lure you. Mmmm...I love breakfast.\n\nAfter ordering and paying (about $30) we were sat at a little 2 top table facing the kitchen and patiently waited for coffee. There's only about 2 servers for the entire dining room so I am forgiving about 4 minutes for a cup of coffee and I take it with a grain of salt. The food arrives hot and gorgeous promptly and it makes up for the almost now hour wait. \n\nThe french toast is made with cranberry-orange, banana, and cinnamon swirl loaf bread. All of this is topped off with strawberries, blueberries and half of a banana and lightly dusted off with powdered sugar. This entire concoction is sweet enough with just the sugar and fruit that you don't need the maple syrup taking up space on the plate. I honestly couldn't remember how my sister's omelette tasted but it must have been good considering how most of it was finished.\n\nA word of warning if you're coming to Mama's to have a nice meal and conversation with a friend: the tables are cramped and you will have no privacy. There is no such thing as \"can I have a window seat\" or \"could we have a booth.\" Nuh uh. Forget about it. I was within inches of the couples to my left and right and apparently, whatever I was saying offended them enough to stop them in mid-conversation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-23", "description": "We came here for brunch last Saturday, expecting the weather to be grand yet the weather was fairly gloomy and the line.. well. The line was long! We waited about an hour, give or take a few minutes, but it was worth it! To be honest, my girlfriend wanted to surprise me so I actually had no idea where we were going or what the place served. Based on a few recommendations, we decided to order 3 things because we couldn't decide what we wanted to eat more! Man the menu items looked so.. so.. tantalizing! Okay, on with the food.\n\n1. Washington Square Omelette. - It was basically your standard omelette with italian sausages, tomato, bell peppers, and pepper jack cheese sprinkled with some garnish. Nothing outrageously special here.. except that it was cooked to perfection! Woo!\n\n2. French Toast Sampler (French toast made out of Swedish Cinnamon bread, Cranberry Orange Walnut bread, and Banana Nut bread) -  Although personally the swedish cinnamon wasn't particularly a favorite of ours and cranberry orange walnut wasn't too strong, the banana nut bread just hit the spot!  It was amazing! None of these are overly sweet, and the french toast is topped off with fresh fruits with maple syrup that is subtly and perfectly sweet and complements the sweetness of the berries and toast very well.  I would strongly recommend getting just the banana nut french toast rather than the sampler, but of course, if you wanna try the various types of french toast they have here, be my guest.\n\n3. Monte Cristo - Golly, the thing everyone seems to talk about, and rightfully so! It's QUITE delectable and so rich and cheesy, I'm craving some right now as I'm writing this review! I don't want to spoil any more, but it's too amazing not to talk about it.  It looks like a boring, fat piece of french toast.  But inside.. seriously.. The perfect combination of turkey, ham, and melted gooey cheddar between two slices of bread with a subtle cheese taste. Once you top it off with their homemade jam, everything just melts in your mouth.\n\nSome ending thoughts: Their homemade jam is absolutely great! I think they sell em too but I forget. I'll be back there soon enough so I'll find out then. Lines are long, especially so with the chilly weather, but summer's coming up soon so that's not a concern woo!.. hopefully. It took us a while to get seated but I think that was simply us being unlucky and some seating arrangements going wrong. Not a huge problem anyway. Restaurant is small, which makes this place really cute, homey, and comfortable.  The decor is nice; overall this place is very quaint.  Portion size is BIG so prepare to get stuffed! The 3 items we ate (sharing everything) had us full for the entire day, even going into dinnertime! Looking forward to coming here again, most definitely!", "author": "Hanyong C."}

While the food was very satisfying, I'm not sure if it was worth the 1+ hours we spent waiting in line trying to pacify our growling stomachs. Apparently, there is always a line out the door and around the corner here. This surprises me, I really doubt this is the best place for brunch in a city like San Francisco.\n\nThe restaurant is small. Like, really small. That's why they can't turn tables very quickly. It's charming and simplistic though. Don't go to the restroom here unless you can help it - it's not very clean, and it's actually outside of the restaurant. It's an outhouse. To get to it, you go through the kitchen, and down a small flight of stairs.\n\nAfter we finally made it inside, we ordered the French Toast Sampler, the Monte Cristo, and the Crab Egg Benedict. The Monte Cristo stood our the most. I would've liked a little more filling, but it was fried very well, and the raspberry preserves it was served with was excellent. I'd recommend the French Toast Sampler as well, I was particularly fond of the slice of banana nut french toast. The Crab Egg Benedict was a little disappointing, surprisingly.

It was a Friday afternoon, the sun was shinin' the sky was a beautiful blue and the birds were chirpin'... Well, maybe no chirping birds, but we did run into a couple of gangsta pigeons as we were walking out of the Montgomery Street BART Station...Then we walked 20 minutes to get to Mama's, saying to ourselves, \"this is gonna so great, so worth the trip.\" \n\nGot to Mama's. Saw a line. Still telling each other, \"this is going to be great..\"  I kept telling myself it will be just a few minutes 'til I eating some of Mama's food. I got excited as we neared the door, there was even a menu on the window, so we occupied our time thinking about what to order. We decided on the Dungeness Crab Benedict (#1), Crab Omelette (#4, not #5), and the French Toast Sampler (#10).\n\nWe were *finally* granted access into the little cafe. And guess what..?  We had to wait in yet another line! Geez... well can't turn back now since we already survived a 55+ minute wait outside. The line inside was shorter, it was only about 15 minutes. You have to wait in line to order and pay for your food. NOTE: it is CASH or DEBIT only! There's a $1 fee if you use your debit card.  Our bill ended up at $57.20.. The reason for the line is because we're waiting on other diners to get up and free up the tables. Man, I was so upset I saw some peeps who were already done eating, still seating down texting on their cell phones.. Seriously, get up and go so the rest of us can eat some tasty Mama's food. Geez... \n\nWell, we finally sat down and had to wait again for our food to arrive. I'm sure this time it was only like 5 to 10 minutes, but we were so hungry it felt like forever.. sigh.... Finally, the waiter brings 2 dishes out. The crab benedict and the crab omelette. We immediately split our plate half-and-half. Based on the Yelp review I immediately opted to fork over some crab benedict into my mouth...and it. was. a. little..... disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it was good but not *that* good, definitely not based on all the hooplah I read about on yelp. No worries though, it's still pretty good, just nothing special. Next I tried the crab omelette.. now, that. was. the...... bomb.com!!!! It was sooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooood, like slap yo' Mama good! Yum!!! It's like I couldn't eat it fast enough, hmmmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm goooood! ; ))  \n\nThey kinda skimped on the crab on the benedict, but the omelette was filled with crab, it was so good! I was full and I still wanted more of that omelette. However, some of the homestyle fries were kinda burnt, not good! Next, they brought the french toast sampler. There were 3 types--the Swedish french toast, the banana nut, and the low-fat apple yogurt cinnamon. There were all good. I didn't really care too much for the banana nut bread french toast, it was a little dry for me, but I put the homemade jam on it and it helped! I loved the Swedish cinnamon and the apple yogurt cinnamon, I could hardly believe it was low-fat!\n\nBottom line, everything was pretty good. I'm glad I went, I think it was worth the wait. I'll be back to try more items on the menu, but if the line isn't so long.\n\n\nLast TIP:  The cafe closes at 3:00, if you get there like 2:00-ish, there's barely any wait! We left like 2:15PM and there was no wait at all! If only wee had planned our trip better lol! (But then, again it may have just been that one time).

All the bread, coffee cakes, etc was fresh :) The Shrimp, crab, salmon, fruits etc were lined up in ice along the window so you could see how fresh they were. Good thinking!\n\nI wish I would have known that you have to order before sitting, or else I would have paid attention to the menu a little more hahaha! My fault.\n\nI got a simple breakfast - Poached Eggs, bacon, taters, and toast. With a pannycake on the side.\nMy date got the Crab, avo, tom, and Gruy\u00e8re omelet. \n\nYeow! The crab was so sweet and there was a LOT of it!\nMy eggs could have been boiled with a little less vinegar, but what can you do.. They were the perfect consistency though, thats all I really care about. I cant STAND an over/under cooked egg.\n\nThe taters were crisp and fresh, and they had theee best bacon I've ever had. So good! Perfectly crisp but not burnt! My pancake was a smaller, but good size. HELLA thick but still fluffy! Yum!\n\nThe service was friendly and very fast! They only have so many tables, and stay full while open, but I didn't feel rushed or like I needed to leave as soon as I was done eating. This was a plus for me.. Cause I was FULL when I was done, and didnt want to move a finger! lol\n\nI will go back next time Im in SF!", "author": "Stephanie S."}

Since I couldn't get myself up that early, I got here around noon and there were only 4 parties in front of me.  I don't remember exactly how long the wait was but I do know we got in and out in an hour (parking meter helps my memory).\n\nMama's is not the typical place where you get seated and someone takes your order.  Rather, what you're waiting for outside is to get into another line inside to order and pay.  Once you order and pay, you then get your table and wait for your food to arrive.  It's a quaint little cozy restaurant (bigger than Dottie's but smaller than Brenda's) with a restroom that you have to snake through the kitchen and down a set of stairs in order to get to.\n\nSurprisingly, we did not wait too long for our order to arrive.  While I got the Prosciutto and Asparagus Omelet special, my honey got the Monte Cristo (MC).  Normally, he looks at my order and then gets disappointed at his but his MC beat my omelet out of the water (don't tell).  The MC was meaty and cheesy while grilled to perfection on the outside.  My omelet wasn't a complete fail as it had a generous amount of tiny shredded bits of prosciutto.  But it just did not look as appealing as the MC.\n\nAnother good thing about Mama's is the jam.  They have strawberry, raspberry, and I believe mixed fruit if you ask for it.  The jam is more like preserves since there are bits of real fruit in there.\n\nOverall:  Maybe it was the omelet or maybe it was death by comparison but I did not think the food was extraordinary enough to give it 5 stars.  Maybe next time I'll get the MC.", "author": "Linh V."}

Ah yeah! The ordering process is a bit...different. The line you see outside simply gets you into another line inside where your orders are taken. My boyfriend and I, who were visiting from Brooklyn, joked that they really make you earn your food here...no sitting down and having a waitress take your order. Your ass is gonna stand up until it's ready! The cooks, who you can see from the \"inside line\", don't even get your little slip of paper until a table opens up. We got a kick out of that, but the novelty would probably wear thin if this was our regular spot. \n\nThe food itself was awesome. I got a burger, which was fresh ground beef with caramelized onions in between 2 pieces of toasted sourdough. Me bf ordered the Monte Cristo, and was the picture of confusion when it came covered in powdered sugar and strawberries. But once he bit into it, his face almost exploded from the joy. And after commanding half of his place, I understood why. Definitely get that if you're into the sweet / savory combo as we are. \n\nI was feeling hefty enough as it was from my \"vacation diet\" (ie. eating everything and anything I wanted) so I passed on the pastries sitting in the shelves. But if I had to do it over again, they would have left with us. \n\nSo, go. If only once.", "author": "Kimberly L."}

Unfortunately, they are too busy to be able to take custom orders so I just order the Monte Cristo as is and then peel off all the meat myself. I would also recommend dipping the sandwich in their homemade jam, but my boyfriend prefers it without. So if this is going to be your first time, give the jam a shot - but it may not be your cup of tea. \n\nI have only had maybe two other things from their menu even though I have been here a billion times.

The french toast sampler was amazing. Reading all the reviews here, I couldn't understand how standard french toast could be SO amazing...\n\nEasy: they don't make your run of the mill french toast. The sampler had a slice each of blueberry loaf, cranberry walnut (?) toast, and cinnamon toast. All were delicious. The syrup and homemade jam to put on top were amazing. And they had fruit!! and plenty of it! Raspberry, blueberry, strawberry, and banana... I LOVE FRESH FRUIT ON FRENCH TOAST! \n\nThe waiters were uber friendly. I always love waiters in California, because we're generally friendly people... but the waiters at Mama's were genuinely sweet and friendly. The cashier-- the son of the owners-- was incredibly friendly and welcomed us since it was our first time. I love the fact that you pay first (makes it easy when you go with friends) and then get seated immediately. The waiters were super attentive with water and coffee.\n\nThe prices were very decent for San Francisco. $10.95 for a HUGE french toast sampler with homefries and toast on the side = AWESOME. \n\nThe restaurant only seats about 30something... thus the long wait. If you get there any time after 9am, you will wait forever.

However, the baked goods are unique and definitely worth trying.\n\nThat being said, parking is awful in north beach, the wait is at least an hour long on weekends, and those two factors combined make Mama's a less favorable option for brunch.  \n\nIf you're looking for good brunch that's truly UNIQUE in the bay area, and not just something you can get anywhere (or cook at home), try Brenda's Soul Food or Red Door Cafe - now that is def worth a return visit, even if there's a wait.", "author": "Cynthia G."}

I can't justify a wait THAT long for average sized portions at typically SF city priced food. \nMy husband and I ordered a variety of meals to get a feel for the food and honestly only one of the dishes stood out. The monte cristo- VERY good (5/5). Perfect combo of sweet & savory, wish we'd ordered two. We also ordered the French toast sampler (4/5) sweet, good breads but left you wanting sausage or bacon (I'm a big French Toast fan and it didnt wow me), the Northern Italian omelette(4/5) very juicy and a great combination of flavors, and Joe's burger (3/5) just an average burger, good size though. Definitely would recommend the Monte Cristo. My husband and I both agreed it was the best out of everything we ordered and we both wanted more! Really enjoyed the jam that went with it.. Though.. i must admit, i think i could make it at home myself. Omelette second, French toast third and not have ordered the burger. \n\nWe also got a hot chocolate and some sort of berry smoothie.

I made a point to clear a morning to try this wonderful gem! I took the advice, and pass it on to you, GO EARLY! I don't mean at opening. I mean an hour or more before opening. Within 30 minutes of opening, the line was blocks long, and I got to meet a lot of the locals and listen to their complaints. When I got on the trolly toward Washington Square, before the usual tourist-rush, he asked me if I was going to Mama's and he was right! Up to the article being published, it was San Fran's little secret. The locals said they could walk right up and maybe wait 10-15 minutes, and get in and out. Now, they huffed and complained as we waited 2 hours to get an early spot, but the line does move very quickly. So, apparently the longer wait is a result of the article, but I assure you, it is WELL worth the wait! But don't forget, the later you go, the longer the wait, and breakfast will switch to lunch, and you don't want that to happen.\n\nAt first it was a little awkward sitting by the door and window, having hundreds of people in line peering in at you to see what you ordered and watch you eat, but once the peach belini arrived, I cared a bit less. I ordered eggs benedict, and it was wonderful. I wanted to go more than once so I could try other items. But dedicating an entire morning more than once wasn't going to work for my short visit, but I did take some baked goods to go.\n\nIt was easy to find and easy to get to using public transportation. I opted to walk off breakfast and take alternate transportation to other parts of the city and finished the day with various park tours and was full all day. If you are a local, I feel your pain about losing easy access to your favorite spot, but if you are visiting, please carve a morning or two out to have breakfast at Mama's!\n\nI went on Labor Day weekend in 2013, so I'm not sure how busy it is on a non-holiday weekend.

I have lived in the neighborhood a couple months and every time I walked by there was a line.  Finally, one week day morning, I came by and no line at all - actually I had to be the first person to wait outside the door before being allowed in to get in the indoor line at the counter.  The service at the counter is very slow but I think that is done to coordinate the seating inside.  After about 25 minutes I had ordered and paid and then waited another 5-10 minutes to be seated.\n\nThe food was good.  I had the orange juice and monte cristo.  At $17.00 it should be good.  The food ordered by other tables all around looked good, high quality and well prepared.  If just rating the food, I would probably give an extra star - although it is just breakfast people!!\n\nThe service was good - the staff well trained and they know how the place works.

Definitely a must try.\n\nAnd this is kind of sad but... This is the first time that I've ever tried toast, butter, and jam all together. I was lovin it.... . Why didn't I try this sooner in life? If you never had this, please do.\n\nMama's got it goin onnnn.", "author": "Maiden D."}

I was more interested in being a tourist and visiting the beautiful landmarks that San Francisco had to offer.  \n\nTwo years later, my interest now revolves around eating and some more eating. That being said, I reflected back on the time when I marveled at the long line outside of Mama's and decided to FINALLY try it out. \n\nThe wait is long but it's organized nonetheless. My boyfriend, my brother, our friend, and I waited for about an hour and a half to get in Mama's. We ordered Monte Cristo sandwiches and the French Toast Sampler. The French Toast Sampler came with a Banana Nut, Swedish Cinnamon, and Cranberry-Orange Walnut french toast (the latter not being my favorite but LOVED the Banana Nut). In my opinion, my boyfriend's Monte Cristo was definitely worth the wait. And to our surprised, it's delicious dipped with the homemade jam. If I were to come back, I'd skip on the sampler and order the Banana Nut French Toast and the Monte Cristo.", "author": "Katherine A."}

If I had to recommend something, it's probably the Breakfast Sandwich. Crab Benedict was good, but not for that price point. To be fair though, I had a mindblowing Eggs Benedict experience elsewhere and haven't recovered from it. \n\nService was very minimal in our experience. You order the food, sit down, they bring it to you, and you're pretty much left alone until you're finished.

The absolute tasty euphoria in my mind's eye that was Mama's has not diminished! \n\nMy wife and I arrived at 8:45a and found a line roughly 20 people deep waiting for us. I estimated that to be a 45 minute wait, but it turned out to be twice as long. That's the only negative I have to say. And that's pretty good if the only complaint a person has for your restaurant is that it's so good and so popular! \n\nI had the traditional eggs benedict, my wife had the northern italian omelette, and we shared the swedish cinnamon french toast. Each a perfect blend of simple, yet dynamic flavors. Hands down the best hollendaise sauce I've had at a restaurant. I prefer when it's more lemon-y than buttery, and that's what you find here. It gives the illusion that it's healthy! Ha! It clogs the arteries just the same, but it's worth it when it tastes this good. And the ham used was the perfect thickness, not so much that it overwhelms the dish with saltiness, and not so thin that it's for looks only and provides no flavor. And the english muffin, simplest of simple things (yet so often a disappointment at other places) was toasted in just the right way, crispy edges, but not difficult to cut. \n\nThe omelette was the most surprising for me, every ingredient used was bursting with flavor. Italian bacon, basil, tomatoes, garlic jack, it was a shame I only snagged a bite or two - but it was enough to get the point. \n\nAnd the french toast was mouth watering - a perfect breakfast dessert to share and finish off our meal. \n\nThis place is worth the wait, and has more than earned it's five star rating from me.", "author": "Mark D."}

Good thing the neighborhood had little pastry shops to snack on but really.. The wait! The main reason why we stayed in line is because we were waiting for so long already, I had a snack, and I've been wanting to eat here for awhile.. Along with their cute restaurant name as well! \nWhen you finally reach the door you would think you finally get to eat! You're wrong.. You have to wait in another line inside to order and to wait even longer for people to leave in order to sit! \nI had the Monte Cristo and it was all worth it in the end! Along with my piggy who got an omelet.. I can't remember what it was called but it was sure tasty! I'd love to eat here again if I only had to wait at least 15 minutes for a table.

We got the Dungeness Crab Eggs Benedict, the French Toast Sampler (Cinnamon, banana, and cranberry walnut), the apple yogurt dipped french toast, and an omelette. The crab eggs benedict was out of this world, possibly the best one I have ever had in my life. The sauce was so creamy and the chunks of fresh crab meat were HUGE. Love the spinach, love the potatoes on the side. The french toast sampler is my second favorite; I really liked how each of the freshly baked breads (baked in their restaurant!) had different flavors that gave each bite a unique kick. I smothered all three pieces in the homemade jam at the table, which I recommend you do as well.\n\nIf you come here, order the specials; don't go for the plain jane stuff you can get at other brunch places.

Then we waited in another line to order, which took another 15 minutes, then lastly, we waited about 10 minutes to be seated (but in this cramped place, 25 minutes feels like torture).

But after being seated, they lightened up and actually managed to bring a smile to our faces. \n\nWe ordered and split a Health Shake, and the Northwest Omelet. They were both really good.

It's not nice to glare at people while they eat because YOU didn't get here early enough.\n\nHaving seen Mama's featured on multiple TV shows and magazines, I knew to expect a line. It was an hour wait for us even at 9am on a Saturday (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=qUajojEM0TDUOXdGis2kwg). Good thing I had anticipated this and grabbed a custard bun at a Chinese bakery on my way here!\n\nTIP 2: If you are here for the French toast and have a hard time deciding on which type to get, just get one of everything! You get a choice of any 3 if you order the Sampler and can add more for an additional price.\n\nKnowing that we would not likely return due to the wait, my friend and I wanted to cram in 4 dishes (literally) during this visit - 2 x French toast, pancakes, and an omelette. Our server warned us it was a lot of food for two people, (if I had a penny every time I heard that... well, I still wouldn't be rich, but I'd have a lot of pennies!) so we settled on an augmented French toast Sampler, omelette, and a side of buttermilk pancake instead.\n\nFor the FRENCH TOAST SAMPLER (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=yvneqNYV2HY6-r_KvZTq9g) we had the standard banana nut, cranberry-orange walnut, and Swedish cinnamon, but we also added the kugelhopf, chocolate cinnamon, and fat-free apple yogurt cinnamon (cause you know, we're watching our figures). The BANANA NUT and CRANBERRY-ORANGE WALNUT were just basically banana bread and cranberry-orange loaf - there wasn't really anything \"French toast\" about them. The SWEDISH CINNAMON was very nutmeg-y and the APPLE YOGURT CINNAMON wasn't very memorable. My favourites were the KUGELHOPF (the brioche bread makes a big difference and this had the best egg batter \"crust\") and the CHOCOLATE CINNAMON (great with the side of chocolate sauce). All of them could've been moister though.\n\nWe got the Mama's Children's Favorite OMELETTE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=ns3tMMIpWsZWSS-L7Aa-tw) - mushrooms, green onions, tomatoes, and jack cheese, served with home fries and sourdough toast. The omelette itself was pretty good and the home fries were decent, but my favourite part of the dish was the sourdough toast! Lightly buttered, it was simply scrumptious with the delectable homemade OLLALIEBERRY! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=pAI-DXUoanNioABKH_tDAQ)\n\nThe BUTTERMILK PANCAKE was also delicious (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=m1eLpd2H-8m6B1laOqZIPw). Incredibly fluffy texture with a nicely browned \"crust\". There was a hint of saltiness (from the butter?) that went perfectly with the sweetness of the syrup.\n\nAs for the service, I was very impressed - fast, efficient, and so friendly (especially considering how busy and hectic this place gets).\n\nMama's is a place I would go to *once* - I'm glad I can say that I've been here but even gladder that I've tried everything I wanted to so that I'll never have to wait in that line again!", "author": "Steph L."}

No. Then what is it? \nI couldn't believe several tourists were actually taking picures of themselves next to the sign outside. Perhaps this was just something to pass the time while they were waiting well over an hour standing outside in line. \nSo even though I showed up 10 minutes before they opened on a weekday, and was about 1/3 back in the line, it still took over an hour to get inside, place my order and sit down. Once you get inside, you stand in line again to order at the cash register, then you stand there and try to stay out of the way while you wait for a table. \nI will say they seem to try their best to accommodate as many people as fast as they can, but this clearly results in you being rushed in and rushed out as fast as they can. So don't come here expecting to have a leisurely meal with your family or think you're going to sit and enjoy reading the newspaper with your coffee. That's not going to happen with the line outside staring at you through the windows willing you to hurry up and leave so they can get inside and have their turn.\nI had the french toast with berries, a side of scrambled eggs and fresh squeezed orange juice. Prices are a bit on the high side- something like $4 for my side order of two scrambled eggs. The orange juice tasted freshly squeezed as advertised.\n\nBesides the long wait and fairly standard tasting (but good) food, the other reason I only gave 3 stars is the service. They brought my meal out and never came back to see how I was doing. Service was pretty non-existant.

CASH ONLY - did not know this in advance. luckily had enough cash on me....would've been pissed after an hour and a half wait otherwise!!!) once you've paid you then proceed to line 3. where the waiter/waitress will come and get you once a table big enough for your party opens up. you are only served/seated for your party that is present. can't have a table any bigger for straddlers.\n\nall in all, the lines are long during peak hours, so get there super early, or way late. but the food is amazing.", "author": "Patty W."}

We came here so I could cross the heavily hyped Mama's off my SF Foodie's bucket list, but I won't be back.\n\nMLP and I went today (Superbowl Sunday), got in line at 8:37am, and had 14 parties (~30 people) in front of us. Didn't get in the door til about 9:45, then waited another 10-15 minutes in the ordering line, and another 5 to be seated.  So from line to food on the table was about 1.5 hours. I think the 8:40ish arrival was our downfall - not early enough to be early, but we hit probably the tail end of 2-3 waves of people. When we left at 10:45ish the line down the block wasn't as bad as when we came in at 8:37. Hmph.\n\nPlus is that food comes out fast once you put your order in and get a seat. We got the weekend special of Shrimp & Avocado bennie (~$11) and Monte Cristo (~$10-11). Bennie was executed fine, but it didn't blow my mind. It came with some (already cooked) shrimp, avocado, tomato on top of english muffin with home fries and slice of orange on the side.  Home fries were just ok, nothing to write home about. Monte cristo (ham and cheese sandwich that gets french toast fried) was really good, with the homemade jam. But was it still worth the wait? No.\n\nService was fairly efficient: our water was always filled and the guys were smiling and nice. \n\nOverall: Solid food, but wouldn't come again.

WHAAAT???  \n\nI had myself a Florentine Scramble (plus mushrooms!), a lemon crumb cake and an orange juice. I was hungry after that darn wait.  My friends had a Monte Cristo and a French Toast Sampler (banana nut, Some Raspberry thing and some chocolate thing).  I liked my scramble.

I don't even know what to say.  People make it seem like the mecca of breakfast places.  I would say that the food is pretty good but I hear the weekend wait can even reach 1.5 hours?  In that case, I don't know if it's worth it.  An hour and a half wait for me has to result in something out of this world.\n\nSo the routine is you stand in line outside which has its own appeal.  Monkey see monkey do.  Then a man beckons you inside in which you proceed to wait in a much smaller line, standing next to the fresh pastries, watching the cooks prepare the orders, smelling the aromas, and finally you get to the cashier where you can order what your stomach has built up desiring.  They do not take credit cards but they do take debit for an extra $1 charge.\n\nAs soon as you order, you wait only a little while more until another man directs you to your table.  I actually think their method is most efficient because while you're in line to order your food, they have time to prepare the tables.  It makes you feel like things are happening and that you're more productive even though they just put you in another line.  And after we sat down, the food only took about 5 minutes?  Impressive.\n\nMy smoked salmon benedict tasted as it should and nothing surprised me.  Don't get me wrong, it was good and the smoked salmon was fresh as can be and I knew they would do a good job.  The side of potatoes were cooked to a lovely consistency.  The chocolate cinnamon french toast topped with bananas, strawberries, and berries was intense.  It's so loaded that you can barely see the bread.  What allows the menu-makers to put \"chocolate\" into the description is that they drizzle chocolate syrup onto it.  I really wish it was incorporated INTO the bread instead... perhaps a chocolate swirl would fare well.  Now there's already powdered sugar and chocolate syrup, but they also give you a side of maple syrup and suggest that you put the tableside jam on it too!!!  And by suggest, I mean I literally saw the waiter go to every table who ordered french toast and told them to add jam to it.  Holy crap, it was a total sugar overload.  Aside from that, I did enjoy the dish!!  The bread was evenly coated in egg and considering how fast they cook things, it was really fluffy and moist.\n\nMama's should Twitter their wait times so I can decide if I want to come back or not!", "author": "Shannon L."}

I am giving the place a four star because the servers were very nice and accommodating. I ordered two things off the menu because I was starving after the long wait because when I arrived it was breakfast but when I got seated it was closer to one. I got the French toast combo, which was ok I wasn't really blown away I don't feel all bread can be turned into French toast and if you are going to attempt that you should try much softer types of bread. However, since I was starving I ate it. I then ordered the vegetarian eggs Benedict, which I was much happier with and pretty much cleaned my plate. I would say my suggestion is anytime you do a vegetarian option your home fries should be sweet potatoes to add a sweetness to the salty flavor of the mushrooms and tomatoes and also they should lightly toast the bread because it was a little hard to cut my English muffin. Another friendly suggestion that New York has done well is having someone come out and find out your party size it makes things easier in terms of getting people in and out and accommodating those larger and smaller parties. I also recommend you bring cash as there is a $1 surcharge for debit cards and they don't take credit cards.", "author": "Aja D."}

After the anticipation that got built up from the hour wait, to my dismay, i don't think the food delivered.\n\nEverything on the menu sounds amazing in theory. I chose to order the Dungeness crab \"m'omelette\" as it sounded like the perfect food-gasmic meal: avocado, havarti cheese, omelette, crab. These are all wonderful things individually, however, when you join it all together, it just becomes...weird, and not in a good way. The filling didn't marry together well, and that problem was heightened by the fact that the omelette itself was pretty stiff and not fluffy as it should be. The home fries on the side, at least, were good.\n\nMy friend's dishes were thankfully much better than mine. The hollandaise on the veggie eggs benedict was fantastic. The french toast sampler was huge and seemed overall enjoyable, but they used their flavored loaves as the toast (ie: banana nut bread for banana nut toast). IMO, this made the entire dish very heavy and dense.\n\nI can understand why tourists want to come here. The food all sounds amazing, but is actually just passable overall and not worth the agonizing wait. If you want a good brunch place, I've been told that Brenda's is where it's at right now.\n\nTIPS: \n\n- If you do plan on eating here, come at around 2p to avoid peak lunch hours. There was literally no wait by then.\n\n- Get the egg's benedict, skip the \"m'omelettes.\"\n\n- Don't get stuck on the hyped menu items, I'm sure you'll find plenty of other tasty under-hyped dishes/", "author": "Melissa C."}

I love the fact that when you walk in the first thing you see is food! Pastries, bread, fruit, shrimp... everything! \n\nBut normally I must say that small and quaint isn't always the best thing, but this time? It is! Because the food here is AMAZING and just well made all together. I went with two friends today and we all had what I think are their most ordered dishes. I had the buttermilk pancakes with the fresh fruit, which was absolutely divine. The fruit was so fresh and the pancakes were oh so fluffy and delicious. I usually form my opinions on places based on their pancakes, and hands down, these are the best pancakes I have ever had. My friend had the Washington Square \"M'Omelette\" and that was good too... sausage, bell peppers, hot pepper jack cheese. Such good flavor! And my other friend had the french toast, which also came with some fresh fruit. Just wonderful!\n\nThe service here was great, too. Our waitress was so nice and even offered to cover our friend's french toast while we waited for him to come so that it wouldn't get cold. And when he did come, he asked for some whipped cream and she got that for him really quick. Everyone was really friendly, from the lady who took our order to everyone else that was refilling our waters and clearing our plates. \n\nI cannot wait to come back to eat here!!! I'm literally counting down to the next time I get to go here. Their menu is very, very extensive, so I'm sure I'll have a lot of things to order (especially for lunch!) in the future. \n\nOh yeah, and as for the standing in line thing... my friend told me that sometimes the line can go to the end of the block! Yes it's discouraging, but let me just tell you that sometimes there are lulls in the line and at times a whole bunch of people seem to leave at the same time. So if you see the line and you are discouraged, don't be! Just line up, and there will be someone there to warmly greet you and tell you to come on in. \n\n(But if you're really worried, try a Thursday at around 11:30 because that's when we went and we sat down pretty quick.)", "author": "Caroline L."}

It is worth all the hype and exceeded my expectations. \n\nMy friend and I decided at the last minute to hit up Mama's. it's a Tuesday morning, it shouldn't be so bad. We were wrong. Although I found parking very easily and nearby, the line was already several parties deep (outside that is). Inside the line was already formed as well. We waited about 30 minutes until we were able to order and then another 15 to get seated. I think the wait time (which is beyond their control) was one of the low points for me. The other low point is that they only accept cash or debit card (with a $1 fee). Luckily I had my debit card with me that morning (it was very spontaneous) and could forgive the $1 fee because the food was magnificent. \n\nMy friend and I split the Apple Pan Dore and the Mama's Breakfast Sandwich with crab. My friend has previously been to Mama's and suggested the Pan Dore. It already sounded delicious from the start and it was even more amazing after I took my first bite. It is not a typical french toast as the slices of the baguette are thin and almost resemble blintzes. The apples are thinly sliced and cover the whole middle portion of the plate and the lemon butter was one of the most amazing things I've ever had. It had just the right zing to it and complemented the whole thing so well. And they do not hold back on it. They were practically drowning in the lemon butter, as they should be! I will definitely come back for those!\n\nThe Mama's Breakfast Sandwich with crab was also delicious. It is on their specials menu as they have many shrimp and crab items on there at the moment. A lot of the crab options sounded amazing but some were very pricey ($21.50 for an omelet or the benedict) and the sandwich was still pretty pricey ($14.50) but was very good. The crab was fresh (as you can watch them cook while you're in line to order) and they paired it with fluffy scrambled eggs and cheese and put it all on a soft bun. It comes with their yummy home fries. \n\nI also had their fresh-squeezed orange juice, which was great! Not too sweet or too tangy and I do love fresh-squeezed!\n\nOverall the experience was great. The food was just as amazing as everyone said it would be and I believe in the end it was worth my wait.

This allowed me to get some nice pictures of my girlfriend and I in front of Mama's sans line.  There's a nice little park just outside Mama's where lots of elderly Asian ladies do early morning tai chi, so we strolled around the park a little bit and ran back as soon as we saw a line starting to form (around 7:45 am).  Everyone who was there by 8 am made it in the first seating.  But I can imagine that anyone who arrived past 8:15 am might have had a really long wait.  We were in and out by 8:45 am and the line was a block long when we left the place.  How it works is you wait outside for a bit, and then you go inside and wait inside for a bit to order at the counter.  You don't order unless there are actually seats for you.  Obviously, for us there were plenty of seats, but the group who arrived at 8:15 am and just missed the first seating was standing there at the counter watching everyone eat for quite a long time.  How sad.\n\nI ordered the dungeoness crab eggs benedict and my girlfriend had the low fat french toast (she was on a diet).  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the crab blended very well with the spinach and egg, but the hollandaise had a little too much mayo for my taste (and way too much for my girlfriend's taste).  The low fat french toast was good, but sort of underwhelming.  If I walked into my local brunch place and got this eggs benedict and this french toast, I would probably think it was fantastic.

We were prepared to wait over an hour. The wait was actually about 25min, which was surprising, considering it was a Friday, and it was freaking beautiful in the city. \n\nIced Coffee - good brew, and made just the way I like it. Slightly bitter, and not too creamy, we added sugar to taste and it was just perfect. Strangely, their coffee didn't give me the bubble guts...\n\nCrumb Cake - This was good. Nothing outstanding. Some parts were slightly dry, yet the crumbs were a bit more moist, which was nice. The helping was a good size for two people to split.\n\nEggs Benedict - Off the record, I absolutely do not like Eggs Benedict or thick cut bacon. I also dislike Hollandaise sauce greatly. That being said, Janette ordered this, and I tried it. Pretty amazing. A perfectly poached egg on top of Hollandaise that was neither overly creamy or overly citrusy. Additionally, their use of thicker cut bacon actually worked better. This place probably cooks the best thick cut bacon. It was still slightly crispy yet had good texture. The tomato added a nice refreshing contrast to the creaminess of the whole dish.\n\nMonte Cristo - Hands down the best breakfast sandwich in the world. the cheeses, ham, turkey, bread, and french toast batter all meld perfectly, and you can eat it as is. However, adding the home made jam creates this culinary orgasmic entity that just encompasses your mind and body into taste bud bliss. This is the freaking sandwich. I refuse to order anything else here because of how much I enjoyed this sandwich... so I'm pretty much now backing on tasting what my friends ordered the next time I come here.\n\nLike my friend Char said, I kind of didn't like the $5 being left on the table as a reminder to leave a tip. I thought that tips are pretty much default at sit down places... that was kind of a turn off and made me dock a star (I don't normally dock stars for stuff like this, but have their servers been shafted that often?).

I did feel better knowing that portions were good when I did take a peek of people eating.  \n\nWhen we finally got in, there's a menu (if you didn't take a look at the one that was outside) above the kitchen counter and you go to the register and order what you want and pay right there.  OH and it's CASH ONLY...luckily my friend and I made a trip to the BofA down 2 blocks while one of us waited in line.  \n\nI had the crab benedict while my friend had the monte cristo sandwich.  We ended up splitting it with one another and it was both oooooohhhhh so amazing.  Definitely a hearty breakfast/brunch but well deserved after waiting in the cold.  SO GOOD.  Fresh dungenous crab...so sweet and amazing.  And cheesy monte cristo sandwich.  Love in breakfast form.", "author": "Kim D."}

Mama's is so amazing, it gets an Olsen twin to eat.\n\nThe food here makes Olsen twins return to the city where they got their start (sort of) and wear sunglasses indoors while ingesting carbs. But it's just as amazing for diners of a less rich and famous stripe. And if you come to eat at Mama's on a weekend, there is a likely chance that you'll be in the line outside the tiny restaurant for upwards of half an hour or more. But like any good mama, you'll be pretty darn pleased with the results of your labor. There are omelets crammed with meat and veggie goodies, crumb cakes, and an apple pan dore served under a pool of lemon butter sauce that will have you exclaiming, \"Have mercy.\"\n\nETA: A couple people have asked if I have photographic proof of the Olsen sighting. So I'm adding this, even if there is no evidence of actual food ingestion: http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/ZrnrWCsZFnxzkWnU-PLWmg/l. \n\nCome on, NOBODY likes to have their picture taken while eating.", "author": "Kimberly V."}

Got there around 10:15am and had to wait 45 minutes outside with a handful of die-hard locals but mostly a horde of SF-hoodie wearing tourists. \n\nThe place is small and the demand is great and for good reason. Sweet or savory, you will not be disappointed. It was my girlfriend's first time (and my umpteenth), so I let her choose two dishes to share. The way it works is you waitwaitwait, order at the counter (CASH/DEBIT ONLY), then wait to be seated. Based on rave reviews by Yelpers, my friend chose the Monte Cristo (who in @*?! name orders from the lunch menu at Mama's?!?!) and the French Toast Sampler. Oh, and a few pastries to go :)\n\nWe were both gravely disappointed with the Monte Cristo but delighted with the French Toast. How can you go wrong with perfectly ripe, fresh berries topping fresh baked goodness? Since the savory selection was a bust, we asked the table busser if we could bypass the long line and order some sort of Benedict. He took the order for us! And then, a server came by to confirm our order and we had poached eggs less than 10 min later!\n\nIf you've never been, it's definitely worth trying but I wouldn't make it your go-to brunch spot...that is, unless you eat at home first to help your stomach make it through the wait (the ridiculous wait that will undoubtedly be had no matter when you go) to second breakfast.

The avocado overpowered the shrimp flavor and my eggs were slightly too vinegary.\n\nI had a slice of the Monte Crisco sandwich and although it was my first and I don't have anything to compare it to, it was quite possibly the most delicious sandwich I've ever had. All the flavors just simply worked together as the entire thing melted in my mouth. Also great with the jam! \n\nEveryone else really enjoyed what they got: chocolate pancakes and california omelet, so it could have just been that I got the one thing on the menu that was subpar. However, I'm not willing to go back and give it another chance because of the ridiculous wait. \n\nPro tip- by the time we got our food it was around 2:30 and the line had gone down considerably. They stop letting people in line around 3, so if you are willing to have a late brunch/early dinner, you'd only have to wait about 45 min\n\nThey also only accept debt (and charge you $1) or cash... super lame.", "author": "Rona Y."}

The line has always been long every day!  Maybe because it was so close and since I was still young, I've never thought of trying Mamas. \n\nNow years later, I finally came here with my boyfriend to try it out yesterday.  It was a rainy morning when we arrived at 10:00am.  Luckily there was no line!  Mamas is so small!  You line up to order at the counter then find yourself a seat to sit while you wait for your food.  The workers here are amazingly nice!  Once you are seated, they come up to you & serve you your beverage and will bring you your food.  Matt ordered the eggs benedict with potatoes and I ordered the trio sampler french toast served with bananas, strawberries, and blueberries.  The food was soooooo good and no wonder there's always a line.  Matt was WOWED by the flavors of his eggs benedict because usually the ham is very salty but not here.  It complemented the poached egg and English muffin very well.  My trio french toast was as amazing served with their homemade raspberry jam.  \n\nI had a hard time ordering because I wanted to try so many things!  The portions are perfect, everyone is able to finish their plate of food.  Such great quality in a smaller portion compared to other breakfast joints.  After about 10 minutes, more and more people came and line was finally formed!  So glad we came right before the line!  \n\nPlenty of metered parking across the street by the park, they only accept cash and atm cards, and the restroom is actually outside by the back door (still kept  neatly!).", "author": "Lily M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-04-21", "description": "I *just* finished eating here after several attempts over the last few months, and I have to say that it was a disappointment, although perhaps not for the \"right\" reasons.\n\nFrench toast has become my litmus test for good breakfast joints, and while you would think that their French toast sampler, with all the rave reviews, would make this a five-star cafe, it's not what I wanted from my French toast.  Their sampler is made, not from regular bread/toast, but from banana bread and cranberry walnut bread, and another that I didn't take note of.  We all know that banana bread isn't really bread at all, but actually cake.  So the dish is attempting to be a cake version of French toast.  Despite the potential for off-the-chart sweetness, that alone isn't a deal breaker for me.  It's something interesting that I'm willing to try, but it wasn't even really that \"French\" in the context of French toast.  Rather than really drenching the \"toast\" in egg batter, which is a must in my book to be good French toast, they just lightly dipped *one side* in the batter.  So it turned out to be cake with an eggy side and syrup.  Just not what I wanted, or could even accept for French toast.  Sorry.\n\nI also got a side of scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese, another one of my favorites.  The eggs were probably perfectly done when they came off of the grill, which means they were just slightly overdone when they were sitting in front of me on the table.  And rather than sprinkle in some grated cheddar cheese, they simply laid a slice of cheddar over the top of the eggs, so it was just barely melted.  They were still fairly good once I mixed them up, but certainly not exceptional.\n\nThe English muffin was perfectly done, but cold by the time I got it, the coffee was good, and the fresh squeezed orange juice was also good.  Not good enough to save the meal for me, though.\n\nAs for the place itself, it's very quaint and the staff are very friendly and efficient.  I got here at 7:30 and was the eighth person in line, so I had ordered by 8:05 and was eating by 8:15.  Not too bad, if the food was stellar.\n\nI'll probably come once more and try one of their seafood and egg dishes, since they're supposed to be good as well.\n\nOh, and as others have noted, come with plenty of cash in hand.

So the day before my sister arrived from Chicago, I got an email from Scoutmob with what sounded like an incredibly good deal.  I bought it and am very glad I did.\n\nFor $25 we got one order of buttermilk pancakes, 2 entrees, we had a choice of the Monte Cristo sandwich, Slim Joe burger, or a Paisano Eggs Benedict.  Also 2 specialty baked goods, choice of crumb cake or homemade bread, plus 2 drinks, choice of mimosa, Papa's punch which is made with red wine, or coffee, tea or a soft drink.  I figured this would cost over $50 without the deal.\n\nWe got there about noon on Friday and the line wasn't too long, could have been worse from what I've read here, about 45 minutes.  My sister has recently had 2 knee replacements and can not stand for very long.  I asked if we could take a chair out to the line but they wouldn't allow it, but they did allow her to sit on a chair that was just inside the back door while I waited in line.  I'm taking one star off because I thought they could have let us put that chair in the line so we could talk while waiting, we hadn't seen each other in a year.  \n\nOnce we got inside you have to wait in another line to order your food and then they direct you to a table.  It's kind of a weird system but I guess it works for them.  It seems more confusing to me.\n\nI'm not sure why they were offering this Scoutmob deal because they obviously don't need to drum up more business, especially at the height of tourist season.  Mama's must be written up in every tourist guidebook because everyone waiting in line with us was a tourist, and all were from other countries.  The woman in front of us was from Mexico and she said her friend had visited here and loved Mama's so much he waited in line twice to eat there.\n\nThe food was really good, the pancakes were the best I've ever had, really light and fluffy, melt-in-your mouth variety.  The crumb cakes were absolutely delicious also, I had chocolate which had chocolate baked in and drizzled over the top, my sister had cinnamon walnut.  I had the burger with potato salad and my sister had the Monte Cristo with coleslaw.  All of it was spectacular.  There was so much food we took home half of our sandwiches and sides so we got 4 meals out of this $25 deal, although I left a $10 tip so it really came to $35, but well worth it.\n\nI would come back bit I would come in the winter and I would arrive earlier, I'm not fond of lines even if the food is great.", "author": "Madeline M."}

The eggs were perfectly cooked and the potatoes were alright.\n\nThe great:   Hands down the best breakfast sausage I have ever had in my life.  The Bellini trumped my friend's mimosa in flavor by miles.\n\nThe bad:  How do f*ck up sourdough in San Francisco?  I could have knocked someone unconscious with the staleness of this bread.  It hurt my teeth.  Please understand that I would have been far more forgiving on imperfections had I not waited 2.5 hours for this meal, had the plummeting blood sugar of a diabetic, been irritated by the ordering system and disgusted by the bathroom ... please see below.\n\nThe ugly:  as many other people have mentioned, the line is pretty ridiculous.  What makes it all the more ridiculous is that the wait stems from unnecessary inefficiency going on inside.  The ordering system is all very soup nazi meets cafeteria ... there were other things that I would have remembered to order (i.e. coffee) had there been less pressure.  And after you've just spent hours+ waiting outside, you now wait inside crammed next to the nazi counter, hovering about awkwardly while waiting for a table to open ... I'll rephrase, watching an open table just sit there empty for a longer than necessary period of time considering the sheer number of rumbling bellies in the area.  I wanted to help the staff out just to move things along.  I wanted to remove the big round tables in the back and replace them with diner square tables for space efficiency.  and why aren't there tables outside ... surely mama can afford the license.  Minus one star for unnecessary inefficiency.\n\nThe unacceptable:  The bathroom set up at mama's is not ok.  Not only do you have to walk thru some private employees-only usage space, it's merely a dressed up outhouse in the back yard.  The inside, tho tiny, is truly adorable ... but getting to it is a level of awkward that I cannot explain.  There is no room to form a line either ... you're either in a server's way or hovering over people enjoying a meal.  awkward.  I mean seriously, you're going to have people wait in line for hours, you need to rethink your bathroom situation.

Mama's just doesn't know what kind of place it wants to be ... does it want to be a sweet little kitchen where people gather for good food and laughs?  or does it want to be a place to get in and get out with time to appreciate a happy belly and a smile once you're walking out the door?    \n\nI won't be going back anytime soon.", "author": "Sarah K."}

The monte cristo was yummy (but I like the one at Blue Bayou in Disneyland better) and the french toast was bleh!  I like my french toast plain and simple and theirs just had way too much going on.  I felt like I was just eating a fancy toasted loaf of bread.  No, thank you!\n\nOverall, I probably would come back here for the monte cristo but only if there is no wait or if I have a good 3+ hours to spare.", "author": "Lisa Marie R."}

Had to take it to go. She thought that it was flavorful. This place is also really health conscious because they let you substitute with egg whites. I ordered a not so breakfasty meal, which was beans, sour cream, eggs, and tortillas. I have to say, if you're going to come here, don't even think about deviating from the norm so order french toast. French toast is absolutely beautiful and scrumptious. \n\nIT'S CASH ONLY! There's an atm near a convenience store, but save yourself the trouble. I wish it wasn't cash only, i'd probably order more.

One day while in the city with my mom I decided I wanted to go to Mama's again... to my surprise their was a line waaaaaay down the block.  Figured it was just the wrong day so we said we'd come back another day when it wasn't so busy.  I decided to do some research and then realized that a long wait is to be expected at good ol' Mama's - due to all of the media coverage it's delectable food has received.  So, mostly you'll find tourists waiting in the long line waiting to get a taste of this San Francisco treat.  \n\nFor my next venture to Mama's I was a bit more prepared.  My boyfriend and I decided to go on the 4th of July, figuring a weekday wouldn't be as busy... even though it was a holiday.  Luckily we only had to wait about an hour to get inside.  We ordered our food at the counter where you could see the cooks cooking away the scrumdiliumptiousness.  We ordered 4 items off the menu: The French Toast sampler, The Lox Bagel Platter, the Dungeness Crab Benedict, and the Californian Omelette... oh and we ordered their tasty beverages too... Mama's Spiked Lemonade and Fresh Squeezed Mimosas.  \n\nI was a little nervous that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered it to be back when I was a kid - but nope... DEEEEEEEELECTABLE!  I wasn't a fan of all of the french toasts... my favorite was the original, but even the one I wasn't too fond of (the Kugelhopf) was still better than your average french toast you get when ordering out.  The Lox Bagel Platter was SO good.  I'm really picky when it comes to salmon and I couldn't stop eating this thing.  Yum... I want to eat it right now.  The Californian Omelette was delicious and fresh - loved the potatoes that came with them.  And the Dungeness Crab Benedict was tasty too!  After devouring all of that we moved onto the toast and their special homemade jam that's sitting on the table.  OMG... so.good.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and go try Mama's... don't bitch about the hour long wait, because guess what, it's worth it.  And if you don't like it then I'm sorry for your tastebuds, but there's obviously something wrong with them.", "author": "Carina S."}

My boyfriend and I had the cinnamon french toast with fruit and the eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce is actually unreal and has a really unique kick to it. The French toast wasn't that special.

All in all the food seemed a bit sloppy for the hype surrounding this place. The grapefruit mimosas were too strong, there was barely any grapefruit taste, it was mostly (cheap) sparkling wine with a touch of grapefruit juice. There was also a piece of hair on my fruit bowl and I had a little struggle trying to get the waitress' attention to come and exchange that for me.\n\nI really really wanted to like this place.

Having read good reviews about this place and hearing from locals that we should dine here, I decided to stick out the wait and experience Mama's.\n\nThey weren't lying when they say the wait can be at least 1-1/2hr. By the time we actually got into Mama's and started waiting in the 'inside line', it was already 2:00p. \n\nI got the spinach and mushroom eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce was pretty delicious, but the spinach had the worst case of post-spinach chalkiness. I think it's how they cook and/or prepare their spinach, but it was full on horrid. I know that spinach can have a chalkiness to it, but this was overkill. The overall dish was delightful. \n\nShanna M. got the smoked salmon eggs benedict which she absolutely devoured. Polus T. got the momelette that had prosciutto, jack cheese, and mushrooms [i believe..] and that tasted absolutely amazing.\n\nWe also got the french toast sampler. Although I thought the sampler was tasty, it was a waste of money to me. 3 pieces of french toast for $10+? Not quite worth it to me.\n\nWe all got a spoonful of the 'much-raved-about' homemade jam. Yeah, it was pretty good, but overly sweet.\n\nAll in all, I thought that Mama's was not bad.

My wife and I came here on Sunday at approximately 9:20 am and we waited in line more than an hour. And yes, it was worth the wait. The moment we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with a warm welcome. While we were waiting outside on a cold January morning, my wife and I looked at the menu which is posted by the door, so the moment we were seated we knew what to order. The restaurant is very busy, full of positive energy, yet the wait staff is very friendly, fast and efficient. The service was awesome and our waitress was always attentive. Most of the tables are very close to one another and it is possible that the couple beside you can hear your conversation. The decibel level can be high because the restaurant is packed. \n\nI ordered the eggs Benedict and they were just amazing. However, the highlight of my meal was the french toast sampler. As Adam Richman from \"Man Vs. Food\" would say, 'Oh my goodness, Oh my goodness!' or Guy Fieri from \"Diner, Drive-in, & Dives\" would say, 'money!' The chocolate cinnamon swirl french toast melts in your mouth and it was awesome, but I suggest the sampler, because you get the best of all. Furthermore, the side of strawberry jam on the table is amazing! The staff @ Mama's know their stuff, baby. \n\nHere is my advice: Before parking your car, have someone wait in line because it can be very, very long. Parking can be a challenge in North Beach, so I suggest taking public transportation or bring your patience with you (anyway your spouse, significant other, or friend will still be waiting in line when you do find a spot). Before entering the restaurant, browse at the menu outside the door before you enter. The line is extremely long on Sundays, so I suggest dining @ Mama's on weekday's, except on Mondays because they're closed. Just be sure to bring your appetite with you. \n\nI love this place for many reasons: friendly staff, great service, moderately priced, and most importantly is the food. If you're craving for french toast, go to Mama's. If you never tried french toast, it's because you haven't been to Mama's yet.", "author": "Albert B."}

This was an experience I had to try after hearing so much about it. Our most recent visit was on a Wed. morning; the day before thanksgiving. The wait in the cold, outside was about 45mins. Which from what I understand is a shorter than normal wait. \n\nWhen we finally got inside, there was yet another line!! I was duped. We waited another 5-10 mins to order our food. The special of the day was dungeons crab omelet, sounded like a good combination. We settled on the omelet and a short stack of pancakes. \n\nThe price for me was a bit high for the omelet. But then again, the portion of crab in the omelet was pretty hefty. The pancake was descent, but I expected something better for a place that has an hour wait. \n\nThe setting was homey and cozy. You really get to know your neighbors because the tables are extremely close to each other. \n\nOverall, the quality lives up to its name, but just not that party in your mouth experience and may not be worth the one hour of your life wasted in line.", "author": "Charlie W."}

One Sunday afternoon, I got to the City shortly after 2:30 pm.  There were 2 small groups ahead of me at the door.  To my surprise, there was another line inside!  To speed up the process, Mama's has you order and pay first and then when a table is available, they seat you.  I would say the wait was about 30 minutes until I was seated.  \n\nI liked the cinnamon chocolate French toast.  The toast was soft and moist.  It was topped with fresh berries and banana. The cinnamon was very apparent.  When I looked over at the next table, I noticed theirs looked a little different.  Ah!  Mine was missing the chocolate syrup.  That was easily fixed after the waitress brought a little side dish of it.  Yum!  The Washington omelet came with seasoned potatoes and a short section of a baguette.  The omelet was also good.  The sausage had a nice flavor with a little kick to it. The bread that came with the omelet was a little hard.\n\nMama's was definitely good, but I don't know if I would wait more than an hour to eat here.

Mama's is located in San Francisco's North Beach area (little Italy). The first thing you will notice about Mama's is the line to get a table there. Since there is no waiting list you have to wait in line for a table to open up. The line usually goes up the street. \n\nThe food at Mama's is truly amazing. They serve so many different types of French toast that you will go crazy trying to figure out which one to choose. Let me tell you that not matter which ones you order you will not be let down. If you can't choose then try the French toast sampler. It will let you try four different types of the FT. When you order the French toast do not forget to spread on some of the homemade jam that is located at each table. The jam is worth the long wait outside alone. It is really that good. If you're not a French toast fan there is still plenty of other wonderful options for you. I have also had an omelet there that was amazing, If you like salmon they have an out of this world salmon omelet. \n\nNo matter what you are in the mood for Mama's will have you covered. The food is so good that bye the time you leave you will have long forgotten that you had to wait an hour in line for breakfast. It is truly that good.", "author": "Craig R."}

To get to this little restaurant, it's easier to locate Washington Square! A bit of advice, come about an hour from when you are expecting to eat, because when I say little, I mean very little! The whole restaurant holds about 30 people max, which is very small for a busy place like this! Expect to wait in line, even during random hours. Anyways to get to the food!\n\nI personally ordered the Northern Italian Omelette, which I destroyed off my plate! I've never been a huge breakfast type of guy, expect bacon so saying that I absolutely devoured this omelette is saying something. The egg was cooked evenly and the middle was just the right temperature. Enough to melt the cheese, but not burn your tongue!\n\nAnother bonus is the service there! The waitresses were very VERY nice! One of my party members got held up, thus their held onto making his plate til later. When we asked them to reheat the food, they did it gladly!\n\nThe reason for the 3 star instead of a 4 is their cleanliness. As my friend was eating his food, he found a hair in his omelette.

This place is not an unknown (or, for those of you who hate the double negative, a known), but as a fan of that magical hybrid meal called brunch, I wanted to put in my two cents...\n\nAmid much fanfare and excitement, my friend and I went to Mama's at around 12:15 on one of the nicest days we've had all year.  The line didn't look particularly long...but when we were still waiting for our food (albeit inside), it started to feel long.  We waited in line for a long while, and I didn't realize that you then have to wait in another line to order your food.  As you wait in line, you are tortured by the delicious-looking baked goods...and I don't even like sweets!  After you order and pay, then you have to wait for a table.  It seemed odd to me, and it was particularly awkward considering that the place is small, and everybody was essentially crowded in a very small area practically hovering over the other patrons who were still eating (slowly, I might add).\n\nWhen I finally got my food, it was delicious - I got the special (the crab benedict).  It was tasty, particularly since I don't like my eggs benedict runny.  The crab was tasty and fresh - my first crab benedict ever!  It was a pretty pricey brunch ($25 with an entree, juice and ocffee), though not too terrible.  \n\nWhile the food was good...I don't think it was good enough for me to wait in that line again...", "author": "Wendy L."}

Since we were staying within walking distance we decided to check it out.  The wait was 1 1/2 hours.  We've never waited that long in line to sit down to eat but we had no plans so we just did it.  The staff was very nice and water was brought outside one time for those having to stand in the sun.  It is a very small venue so seating is a premium.  At one time a party of two was sat at a table that could have accommodated 5 - 6.  The couple behind us asked if they could join us as we were sat at a table that could accommodate 4 - 5 and there were just two of us.  \n\nAfter a long wait outside you are then brought inside and have to wait yet some more to watch them cook the food and to be seated.  We had a delightful experience because of the couple behind us and eventually sitting at our table.  Had it not been for them I doubt the experience would have been so pleasant.  \n\nAs we watched the cooks prepare the various meals the main cook was sloppy with what he was cooking, if something dropped in the eggs by mistake i.e. spinach, meat he would just scoop it out and throw it on the floor.   The \"fresh fruit\" was not fresh as it appeared to be the mix you can buy from a bag at Smart and Final.  Flies were abundant in the cooking area as well landing on the various breads used for the french toast.  \n\nUpon being seated we only had been checked on once by one of the servers.  There was one young man who spent more time going out to the back door to look at the line and eyeball the young ladies.  He walked around and didn't do much from our observation.  \n\nThe food was okay.  The potatoes were undercooked.  The South of the Border omelet advertised with chorizo was not chorizo but rather linguica.   It was more of a black bean omelet as there were only five pieces of \"chorizo\" in the omelet.  My partner's omelet was tasty.  The blueberry pancakes were tasty but only four blueberries in each pancake.  Coffee was good if you can get a second cup.  \n\nThis place continues to be a place to go to for locals and tourists but I wouldn't go back again.  I can cross it off my bucket list.", "author": "Chris S."}

You order at a counter once you are granted access to the inside of the restaurant, and then are ushered to a table.

Still, I was pretty disappointed with our meal.  We all shared food (since it was our first visit), so I got a sampling of four dishes: eggs florentine (both poached and scrambled), seafood omelette and the french toast sampler.  The poached eggs were very undercooked, with runny white.  Scrambles were okay, not terrible but not good either.  The french toast was dry, though the breads and berries were tasty.  Also disappointing was the lip-pursingly dry blueberry-lemon muffin.  Overall we were very underwhelmed by the food.\n\nWhile this has no impact on my review, it should be mentioned that we waited in line (outside the restaurant) for 1.5 hours -on a weekday morning.\n\nThe one upside was the very competent wait staff. \n\nBottom line: massively overhyped, poorly executed menu and completely underwhelming.

Thinking that since we were coming on a Thursday, I thought I had outsmarted the General Public. My first lesson of 30; I ain't that smart.\n\nDoesn't matter WHAT day of the week, you are waiting in a line. A  l o o o o n g  long line. Almost an hour and a half went by when we finally stepped up to the red stoop, the bottom half of the double door closed - but all that we could see was plenty alright with me. \n\nCarrot Cake Squares, Sour Cream Walnut Coffee Cakes, Cranberry Bread, Cinnamon Bread, Banana too, among fresh berries, bowls of shimp and crab, avocados, eggs, baguettes just waiting to be toasted. I could sit for hours (not in the God Forsaken line - at a table, with the aforementioned food, Silly). \n\nThen I learned that after you are done in line, you get right back in line!!! But we came upon a server who was cute as can be and sweet as pie, she seated us right away and asked what it was we wished. Now, it was past breakfast - but that's what we came for - however lunch sounded grand as well, so what do you do in this circumstance? Well, you get both of course!\n\nThe French Toast Sampler and Shrimp Salad was my order of the day and my Wonderful Mama got the Monte Cristo.\n\nThe Sampler was of the Cranberry Orange Walnut Bread, Cinnamon and Banana Bread. I didn't even need the syrup. Served with those fresh berries, the dense Cranberry, chewy Cinnamon and moist Banana were perfect on their own. \n\nShrimp Salad - a simple robust salad with half an avocado, big slices of tomato, a bit of sliced egg, perfectly toasted baguette and vinagrette on the side is satisfying and clean.\n\nThe piece de resistance, of course was that Monte Cristo. My Ma has a knack for ordering THE best thing on any menu, and this, my friend was it. Cut into quarters and THEN dipped in batter, these were individually fried and fabulous. A pot of homemade jam accompanies and there was never a better match. Salty ham, melty cheese, airy brioche, eggy batter and jam. The Perfect Bite.\n\nWe didn't stop there, my Mom without my conculting, got the Carrot Cake and Sour Cream Walnut Coffee Cake, as I SURELY would have said no. Well, those were gone before we got home, let me tell you.\nThe Carrot Cake itself is so moist, it's almost like an English Pudding - a little bland, but this cake still shines because of it's topping. No ordinary heavy cream cheese, this was infused with something lighter and tangy - creme freiche or sour cream perhaps? Heavy cream? I haven't deciphered it yet, but it was the most amazing frosting I have ever let touch these Irish lips.\n\nSour Cream Walnut Coffee Cake - the piece that I chose was so dry and slightly tough, I was shocked. I did of course eat it - as I am a Glutton, and noticed when we got home that my Ma's untouched piece was moist, brown-sugary walnutty fantastic and Mama's rep was redeemed. \n\nI MUST mention our terrific waitress, she was friendly, personable, respectful and fun.

There is a funky system here whereby one orders her food and pays for it at the counter before getting a table.  The food is then brought out to the table after the person sits down.  I imagine they have this down to a science, and given the modest size of the restaurant, people probably order well before the kitchen is ready to prepare their meal.\n\nOn the one recent day that I finally did grace the interiors of Mama's, it was pleasant outside (upper 50s, perhaps) and it appeared that the line out the door wasn't too bad, and much more attractive than what I had witnessed previously.  I was, perhaps, the third or fourth person standing outside.  I didn't realize that there was another line at the counter waiting inside.  And even though the line wasn't so long, I still waited about 45 minutes before I got a table.  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, I waited 45 minutes to sit down and about one hour before I got my omelette.  Was it good?  Sure.  Worth an hour of my life?  No way.  Did I mention that I arrived about 2:30p, just a half hour before closing, hoping to avoid the lunchtime crowds?  And I still had to wait an hour! \n\nThe omelette was good.  It was a vegetarian variety -- spinach, onions, egg whites, etc.  The breakfast potatoes were also pretty good.  I enjoyed the slices of homemade bread that they included on the plate.  But, was it better than Rick & Ann's in Berkeley, where I seldom have to wait more than 10 minutes?  Marginally, if at all.  (When Bette's Oceanview Diner does it right, its omelettes are better, though there is less variety).\n\nIt's a pleasant place, and on a nice sunny day, looking out over Washington Square is a delight.  But who wants to wait an hour for eggs?  The whole brunch thing is something that I simply don't get.  People flock to these tiny \"quaint\" places, wait in grostequely long lines for an interminable amount of time for eggs.\n\nIt's too bad.  My girlfriend loves brunch (her running favorite is Bette's Oceanview Diner in Berkeley -- another place that has obscenely long waits; Mama's is worse).  I'd love to introduce her to Mama's to spice up our brunch rotation, but with food that more-or-less runs with the pack, why would I bother?  Why would anyone?\n\nGranted, as a vegetarian, there's a lot on the menu I wouldn't touch.  The person in front of my raved about their Monte Cristo; the person behind me was jonesin' for the Slim Joe Burger.  Perhaps with life-affirming options like those, I could be inspired to waste my life away for a meal at Mama's.  For vegetarians, however, it's the standard brunch alternatives (eggs, pancakes, french toast) or a handful (as in three) of additional vegetarian lunch options (quesadilla, sandwich, quiche).  I'm sure they are all reasonably satisfying, even if the options aren't as varied.\n\nIn a perfect world, I might venture out to try the French toast or the pancakes even though as someone who doesn't eat breakfast much I haven't eaten them in over twenty years.  But, alas, this world ain't perfect, and my time is too valuable to spend 90 minutes for a breakfast plate that at most I would acknowledge as good.\n\nI wish Mama well, but there are reasons why I moved out of the house long ago.\n\nPlease Note:  CASH ONLY.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

Service was good but seemed like it was very slow for the simplicity of the dishes.  Long line waiting even before restaurant opened. We waited an hour to be seated and we were there 30 minutes before opening. The orange juice was delicious and the fruit was great! The seafood appeared to be fresh but the Norwegian hollandaise was definitely not a $25 meal! My friends said their food was pretty good but all in all we all agreed we wouldn't wait that long again for that meal! Maybe midweek would be better but avoid this place on weekends unless you want to wait in line for hours for a mediocre meal.", "author": "Tara A."}

I walk by this restaurant often and assumed it must be so good because there is always an extremely long line. No, the food is not beyond compare and actually pales in comparison to many of the other wonderful spots in North Beach. My best guess is that this place was reviewed favorably or put in guide books so that the tourists always come here (that is what the majority of my line seemed to consist of...tourists looking to say they ate there).\n\nI may be overly critical because I had such high expectations, but I truly think the food is mediocre. The place was cute, but the atmosphere was all wrong for a breakfast spot. As you can imagine, such a long line means many customers so this place was loud, packed, and I felt rushed to finish my meal.  You are brought inside to order at a counter and after you order you must wait for your table and there is very little room to wait. I had a group behind me waiting and I was constantly moving to get out of the way of the servers. I feel like they place in view of other diners to rush them out and that is certainly how I felt when eating. Besides being rushed, I was seated in front of one of the many windows with the line on the other side of the glass. I felt like a crowd of people were standing next to me and watching me eat.\n\nTruly, the only redeeming quality of this restaurant was the fact that the food was not terrible. If you are looking for a quick breakfast or a leisurely breakfast, then do not dine here. If you are looking for decent food, a claustrophobic environment with little service, and a ridiculous wait (over an hour...at least!), then dine here.", "author": "Kara P."}

As we were waiting in line, one of the cooks gave us slices of bread to eat while we are waiting (I can't tell you how they were though because I'm allergic to walnuts).

It's just typical breakfast food with a fancy twist.  Nothing worth waiting over an hour for.  To be specific, we got the frech toast sampler and the pancakes with fresh berries.  I can make pancakes at home which are on par with these and of the 3 difference types of french toast, only one was really good, the lemony tasting one.\n\nIf Mama's truly appreciated all their customers then wouldn't they develop some sort of reservation or ticket system or something?\n\nSo if you do decide to wait in the line, here are a few tips: 1) bring things to do!  We brought out cocktails but they didn't last as long as the line did!  2) When you do finally get in there - order A LOT of food!  After waiting over an hour to eat, you will be hungry and their portion sizes will not satisfy your major starvation!\n\nSo in my opinion, there are way better places in the city to go for brunch where the wait is short or you can actually make a reservation!\n\nSo Disappointing... :(", "author": "Carly P."}

They kindly and courteously escorted her out the door and thus made all those individuals waiting in line wait just a little less. They are also on top of getting your food, drinks and refills. I must of had 4 cups of coffee and didn't even ask for 1 refill.\n\nAnd now down to the food. I went with the Dungeness crab omlette. Each and every bite had crab in it!!! It was a bit pricey 18.50, but well worth it. The omlette itself measured 7 to 8 inches in lenght, 3-4 inches in height and 4-5 inches in width. It was a big and well cooked omlette. On the side are red country potatoes. The potatoes are good and well portioned but as for flavor were ok. What was good was the fresh sliced french bread served with the meal. They slightly butter the bread and grilled it giving a crunchy and golden brown texture. On the table is homemade boysenberry jam. WOW! \n\nNow was it worth the wait..... Yes....

I thought it was a sandwich but it was cool that it was like french toast...soft and fluffy. I, on the other hand, had a hard time selecting my food because I was hoping I could get more points on choosing good food since the bf is at 7 points of choosing good restaurants and good food while I only have 3 points. I selected the dungeness crab omelette with avocado and tomatoes with whole wheat toast. It sounded really yummy. I should have kept things simple. The crab meat was rich so that's a bonus but maybe it wasn't the best combination to have egg with it. The avocodo was so mushy that I couldn't find my tomatoes...The bf sensed that I didn't really like my food so he passed me off his plate :) So the bf with 8 points and me still 3 points. \n\nJust for the first comers, you need to order first before getting a table.

It was a hangover-appropriate overwhelming combination of all the things you never thought you'd enjoy in an omelette. Black beans, sour cream, and salsa.. + jalapenos. Yum.

Definitely better than the spinach/tomato version I had previously.\n\nThe mimosa was nice - fresh squeezed OJ and heavy on the champagne, small glass.  I would have had another one, but unfortunately the way in which you order first at the front and then sit down makes it somewhat awkward to order anything else afterwards.  \n\nHowever, the monte cristo DOES in fact live up to the hype.  Gooey goodness encased in delectable egginess, dipped in homemade jam - I was a bit skeptical of the jam, but I'm glad I tried it because I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nSo, would I go here and brave the lines on some random weekend again?  Sure, but I won't bother with the benedicts.  I'd stick with the monte cristo or the french toasts, and I'd get 2 mimosas.  I'm sure their omelettes and other sandwiches are great, but it doesn't seem like anything you can't get somewhere else in a more convenient neighborhood without the line.  The specials are likely a good way to go as well so if you fancy a dungeness crab, shrimp, or other seafood-version of a benedict and it's on the white board, it's probably a safe bet.", "author": "Sus...

The best brunch I have ever had. \n\nStanding 50 feet away from the base of a soaring cathedral, Mama's offers a religious experience for disciples of Sunday brunch. And yes, like heaven, it takes a while to get in. If you count 15 people standing outside, that's a 1 hour wait. 30 people = 2 hour wait. \n\nStanding in line becomes particularly torturous once you get inside. It seems like it's time to eat.  Oh no. Like Job, your faith will be tested. There is another 15 minutes to stand there watching people eat all around you. Resist the urge to sit down at a recently vacated table and eat their scraps. Your time will come. \n\nWhen you finally make it to heaven's gatekeeper, remember that he only takes cash or debit. I usually order approximately 4 dishes for a party of 2. Best bets: omelet (Washington Square), eggs benedict, 2 eggs any style, and any French toast. Their homemade jam is great. Don't be shy. Put it on everything. And I mean EVERYTHING. \n\nThe service is top notch. Mama's treats each customer like one of her children. My waiter once refilled my coffee cup 12 times in an hour.

Waiting in line, check out the focaccia bread store across the street at Liguria Bakery. \n\nPan Dore with apples is my favorite, followed by the Monte Cristo. Pancakes are good, and so is the Northern Italian omelet with garlic cheese! Everything is delicious so come hungry.

I casually asked the girl in front of me how the line worked and from there, we made a small acquaintance, making the 40 minute wait interesting.\n\nBasically we waited outside. Then they moved us inside and we continued to wait in line. They make you think you are getting close, but you end up waiting and waiting in different places.

I don't think I would wait 45 minutes(as other people have on weekends) for them.  I thought the service was abysmal since we were seated right next to the door and would get a blast of cold air whenever the door opens(there was a lot of tables open away from the door).  This is after I offered to be seated with another diner from England which I just met to save them space on tables.  I could see that they just gave us attitude which I felt uncomfortable.  The English guy Stewart is here for MacWorld and was very nice and pleasant, however he didn't eat too much of his omelet or drank his coffee.  In retrospect I could understand why since I felt this place was highly overrated.  We might have just gotten them on a bad day.  All I know is that the coffee here is the worst I have ever tasted, anywhere!  The coffee that I had at work which sits around for hours tasted much better.   I just felt the owner lady(I think) at the cashier was rude(for telling us to sit next to the door) and I really did not enjoyed my dining experience here at all.  I will most likely never be back.  Which I am sure would please people who wait 45 minutes for a plate of average tasting omelet, at this establishment! :-)\n\nI am just amazed that a place which serves such horrible coffee and average omelets could warrant waiting for in SF, and praised as being a GREAT breakfast place.

The food is Okay but there are plenty of other restaurants in the City just as good without having to wait. Wont be going back Thanks.\nPS: Our server was very good and got a 40% tip.", "author": "D.

Judging by the huge line going around the corner every day of the week I'm guessing the word is out. I went at around 10am on a Thursday and found myself about 10 deep in a line of eager diners waiting to get their breakfast on. In addition to breakfast Mama's also serves lunch as well as baked goods. In terms of breakfast, they have all the classics but their claim to fame is their french toast. The way it works here is you wait in line to order and pay, then you're seated and it's pretty much a regular procedure after that.\n \nPersonally I love french toast but never order it when I go out because I know nothing will ever to compare to my mom's french toast which she makes with homemade cinnamon raisin bread, thickly sliced of course. Mama's has a number of different types of french toast, not all are available everyday due to limited availability but that's one reason to keep coming back. If you're like me and can't decide on what type of french toast to get you can get the variety plate that comes with a thick slice of 3 varieties. The morning I went this included a banana nut bread topped with fresh bananas, a cinnamon, and a lemon berry topped with fresh berries. Each table also has a jar of homemade berry preserves that the waiter suggested I try with the french toast (very good call). I can say with no hesitations that those three pieces of french toast were the best I've ever had. I can't go into detail more than to say that it filled me up, was worth every penny (the prices here are reasonable but not dirt cheap), and that it was nothing less than perfect. Their fresh squeezed orange juice and friendly service really just put them over the top. They don't take credit cards but do take debit cards which saved my ass because there aren't any ATMs on premises or on the block from what I could see. Hands down Mama's is definitely one of the best breakfasts in town.", "author": "Matt E."}

The eggs were poached nicely though. \n\nFrench Toast Sampler - I was very excited to try their different house baked breads french toast style but one bite later I realized I like the traditional french toast made with white bread. The heavy blueberry, cranberry and orange breads were overpowering.

Famous for their French toast sampler and eggs Benedict, so we had to try them!  Restaurant is located in North Beach on the corner of Filbert and Stockton.  Wait time was about 30 minutes.  We arrived at 10am on a wednesday with two parties ahead of us.  We waited another five minutes to order our food at the register.  One suggestion is to bring cash.  Don't pay with a credit or debit card.  They charge a surcharge.  Instead of paying the cost themselves (the cost of doing business which is a benefit to them), they pass it on to the customer.  The dungeness crab eggs benedict was excellent.  Their hollandaise sauce has a special zing to it.  One plate can definitely serve two people.  The french toast sampler was nothing out of this world.  Each slice of French toast was hard.  The syrup did not even soak into the toast.  It seemed that they served us old slices of toast.  Service was alright.  We had to get up ourselves to get two clean plates to share the french toast since our server wasn't around.\nWould I go to this place again?

It is no doubt good, we'll get into the details in just a bit. As for the wait, we got there with a party of four at 9:20am on a Friday. Life is much easier with a party of two or less. The wait to get from the the back of the line, order food, and seat at a table took a total of an hour and a half so we ending up eating at 11am. If your entire party isn't there, you have to wait outside and other people after you get to pass you. Fair enough.\n\nWhile I ordered, I asked the cashier which she would recommend, the special shrimp or eggs benedict. As this is my first time here, I wanted to try what they were famous for which was the eggs benedict but she gave me a clear answer that the SHRIMP BENEDICT was better. Slightly more expensive $11.95 vs $9.95. My friend got the Monte Cristo despite it being before \"Lunch\" 11am availability (Lucky us!). My other friend got the smoked salmon benedict. Service was quick and often. EVERYTHING was delicious. The Shrimps scattered around the egg benedicts was alright. I could've done without it. The Monte Cristo was delicious as expected, and the smoked salmon benedict was plenty more worth it than the shirmp. What's also amazing is the great variety in the menu to fit into any person's diet. I feel like this is a place that you can try on the occasion but I don't think the wait was worth it.

There is always, and I mean ALWAYS a line so expect there to be a long wait. I assure you, it's worth it. The place itself is quite small and the seating is limited, but it has a very cozy and relaxed atmosphere. That being said, I've never felt like I needed to rush through my meal to make room for the crowd outside waiting to be seated. The servers are always polite and I've always had a good dining experience there.\n\nNow about the food. There are so many things to choose from on the menu, so even though I've been here many times, I always have something new to try. One of their most popular dishes has got to be the Monte Cristo. They are triangular pieces of bread stuffed with ham, cheese, and turkey, battered in egg, grilled, and served with homemade jam. It's absolutely delicious!\n\nIf you're in the mood for something sweet, their french toasts are a great option. They really are very tasty (writing this review is making me crave for them right now)! If it's your first time here, I suggest you try their french toast sampler. This typically includes banana nut, cranberry orange walnut, and Swedish cinnamon french toast, but it depends on what breads they have available that day. The french toast is topped with a generous amount of fresh fruits and dusted off with powdered sugar. It's perfection on a plate.\n\nTheir eggs benedicts are delicious as well. They have a dungeness crab benedict on their specialty menu and what I love about it is that they don't skimp on the crab. It's a bit more pricey than the other dishes but you do get what you pay for. I've also tried the Paisano benedict, which has pancetta and grilled peppers in it. Delicious. \n\nBottom line: There is always a long line but it really is worth the wait.

And then we had to wait another 20 minutes to get our food.  Basically, we got there around 1:30 or 1:40, and didn't get our food until around 3:00PM.\n\nI would consider myself a really patient person.  I don't mind waiting.  But this was so not worth it.\n\nI ordered the Eggs Benedict with a side of bacon.  The bacon was pretty good.  The eggs benedict was just a huge disappointment.  The hollandaise sauce was bland and sour.  I know there's lemon in it, but it should be a hint of lemon.  Ugh, not good at all.  The potatoes were average.  Nothing spectacular about them.\n\nMy boyfriend got the Californian omelet (bacon, avocado, jack cheese).  It was a pretty good omelet.  The eggs were fluffy, the bacon was crispy, and the avocado was just the right amount of ripeness.  It was good.  I also had a bite of his french bread with jam.  That was really good.\n\nMy roommate got the Monte Cristo.  It was actually really good.  I would say it's probably the best thing I tasted out of our three orders.  It's weird that you eat this sandwich with jam, but for some reason, it's really good.\n\nAnyway,  I'll probably come here again, and order something else next time. \n\n3 stars for now, because the food was not good enough to justify the wait.  And also, why can't they just take names?  Then instead of standing around waiting in line, we can put our name down, go browse around at shops nearby, and then go back when they're ready to seat us.\n\nThis might be good or bad: we were full for the rest of the day.

All the 5 star reviews are so true... so so true! Mama's completely exceeded all my expectations!\n\nMy Washington Square M'Omelette was HUGE and so gooood. With Italian sausage, roasted bell peppers and tomatoes (and I added in onions which also came roasted). Ohhhhh... the flavors melded so well together! And the house potatoes - OH!

Definitely five-star good.\n\nI'm dinging Mama's a star, though, because of the line.  Now, all of my fans should be furiously typing, \"But, John S., you gave the Pork Store five stars, and there's always a line for that place, and it's on Haight Street!\" but fear not, stalkers, I have a good reason for my apparent reviewing unevenness.\n\nAs my furiously typing fans have made clear, I don't automatically drop stars for having to wait in line, but the line at Mama's is kind of tricky.  It hugs the eastern wall of the restaurant, so in addition to waiting in line, you can also clearly see everyone inside already enjoying their breakfasts.  When you get to the Dutch door, you think you're that much closer to paydirt, and when the greeter guy unlatches the bottom half of the door for you, you're ready to go inside and . . .\n\nwait some more.  See, the line continues inside.  Distance-wise, it's much shorter inside than outside, but it also moves more slowly.  By the time you get to the register--and that's the second deception; you're ordering at a register--you really know what you want.  They try to make you feel better by having you wait right in front of where the cooks are cooking, but this just makes you hungrier.\n\nOnce you've made your order and paid (it's cash only), you wait again, this time for the cashier to tell you when a table is open.\n\nI actually like how you don't get to choose where you sit, and honestly, the whole waiting-in-line process isn't so bad.  But I definitely wouldn't stand in the rain for this place.  OK, maybe I wouldn't stand in the rain for any place, but I would stand (and have stood) in the fog for the Pork Store, and I don't know whether I would do the same for Mama's.\n\nOh, and once you're seated, there is honest-to-goodness waiter service, and it's decent.", "author": "John S."}

I finally came back a year later and was determined to try it out. I went with my sister and another friend on a Sunday morning around 11am. We obviously knew there was going to be a line because of the time of the day and week. But once we arrived- the line was bigger than we expected. \nI don't know if I'm proud to say this but we basically waited 2 hours in line to just get into this miniature restaurant.\nAnd the wait doesn't end there; once you get past the front door- you need to wait in line to order your food at the cash (yes very unusual- they make you order your food before you get seated). So once you order your food- you need to wait to be seated- once your seated- then you need to wait for your food to arrive.\nSo we basically took 4 hours of our time for Mama's.\nNow; the food.... the food; i hate to admit it; but it was amazing. We all ordered the eggs Benedict  and we were speechless how good it was.\nHowever- my sister found a hair in her plate which she told our waitress- the waitress didn;t even apologize- just gave her a new one ( another wait there). I found that to be rude\nIn the end; we were satisfied with our breakfast- but I was upset that we wasted 4 hours at Mama's with all the waiting.\nI think the food was worth it, but worth my time? I don't think so.\nIf you have plenty of time on your hands- check it out- but prepared to wait....and wait....and wait. ( We actually went to a bakery while we waited 2 hours in line and ate pastries- then even had time to digest that and be hungry for \"brunch\")\noh and did I mention you need to wait for the bathroom too?

I've converted several people over the years into waiting so long in line for the best food ever. \n\nBut really, the reason why I get up after a huge night out with a hang over and stand in line for over an hour in the wind is strictly for the Monte Cristo.

Go for the more interesting options! They do have very tasty Benedicts, pancakes and wonderful Old Fashioned Crumb Bread, but I've never ordered anything other than the Monte Cristo since my first time with it. \n\nAnd forget all you lame-o people that didn't give it five stars.

I thought-- really?! for breakkfast?! It better be out of this world. Good thing the wait was actually 25 minutes and the food was delish (and extremely filling).\n\nIced Cafe Latte- I absolutely need my coffee in the morning and since it was a gorgeous, sunny morning in SF I decided on an iced refreshment. It was strong, but not too bitter. I added a dash of Equal and it tasted perfect to me. Delish.\n\nOld fashioned crumb cake- We started off the day with a little something sweet. It looked like the Starbucks crumb cake, but tasted MUCH better! It wasn't as moist as we hoped, but I enjoyed the generous amount of baked crumbs atop the cake. Amazing with my coffee.\n  \nBlackstone Eggs Benedict- Bacon makes everything damn good. But what really stood out was the hollandaise sauce and its kick of spice. The eggs were nicely poached (my only gripe was that one egg still had a little runny egg white & that grosses me out). Overall, yummy dish and I would order it again if I was really hungry because it was a huge portion!\n\nMonte Cristo- The boyfriend's dish of choice. I was already getting stuffed from my eggs benedict & potatoes, so I only took a bite of the sandwich. It is definitely for the more adventurous heffer and I liked it; the cheese made it delicious to me. \n\nI will be back to try an omelette or one of the seafood breakfast items!!", "author": "Janette H."}

Unless of course there's a natural disaster and every restaurant and grocery store is closed and government relief workers are handing out rice and cans of chili to live on.  But I digress...\n\nSince we were a large party, someone thankfully got there around 9am.   This person was NOT me.  I got there about 9:20am and the line seemed to grow and grow.  The wait was not unpleasant since there were plenty of entertaining ppl/sights across the street in Washington Sq. LOL but that's for another review.  We finally got in around 10am.\n\nMy favorite things about Mama's...the fresh squeezed juice, strong, hot, tasty coffee and this incredible homemade jelly!  \n\nI had the french toast with fresh berries and it was delicious.  For my 3yr old, since they don't have a kids menu, they will let you order a half order of something...so he got the 1/2 order of the dollar sized pancakes with strawberries.  It was a hit!  The eggs and potatoes were also perfect!  The food came out quickly, it was hot and fresh and delicious.  One of our party comes here and orders the Eggs Benedict.  In fact, that's all he ever orders from Mama's...he says it's the best ever.  It certainly looked amazing!  \n\nThis place would get 5 stars except for the wait and although the waitstaff was attentive, it wasn't exactly the warmest either with one notable exception.  Maybe it was because I was the only person crazy enough to bring a kiddo here...I certainly didn't see any other kids inside or in line waiting.", "author": "Angela N."}

While wait inning inside in the line (after a half hour outside) I was able to see the amazing food they were making.  This food gets 5 stars with looks alone.  I almost ordered pancakes and French toast as well as the monte cristo. However, you order while still in line and pay when you order.  I like this idea since you already spend that time in line and you don't have to waste time at the table waiting for the check.  I decided in the 'famous monte cristo' and was not disappointed.  It came with a mixed berry jam that the waitress said was \"kinda famous.\"  The cheese inside and combination of jam was amazing. My friends omelet was perfectly cooked as well. \nI also want to say they don't have cooks, they have artists. The entire staff was really nice.\nAdvice, think if what you want to order before hand or while in line, be prepared to wait in line for a while, and have cash.

Me and my wife left the house at 5am from Yuba City in great anticipation to try Mama's after we noticed the long lines out the door during Fleet Week. We arrived early and were the first in line. We had a hard copy of the menu and made our selections beforehand; especially after reading that you place your order with the cashier before being seated. At 8am sharp the doors were unlocked and we immediately placed our order with the cashier. We ordered the crab benedict, buttermilk pancakes, Washington Square Omelette, a peach bellini, and coffee. The crab benedict was nothing special. The poached eggs were a bit overcooked and not enough hollandaise sauce. There were plenty of crab however. I had much better at  less popular restaurants. The buttermilk pancakes were like any other pancakes I tried; only these were smaller ~6\" diameter and only three per order for $8.95. They were not fluffy and light at I've read from other viewers. The omelette was the better of all three. The Italian sausage they used was very flavorful and the eggs were fluffy. Overall, the WOW factor we were looking for just was not there. Needless to say we were a bit disappointed. Anyone that knows me knows I don't mind spending good money on good food, but $58.00 for a mediocre breakfast? But I won't end this review on a sour note.

I would wait in that line anyday and now I understand why so many others do also.\n\nAfter waiting in line on a Sunday morning for about an hour and a half, we were finally seated.

My eating partner had 2 eggs with potatoes, sourdough and a bloody mary.  We also shared pancakes.\n\nWe received our drinks right away.  The belini was delicious, due to the freshly squeezed apple juice and heavenly peach puree.  His bloody mary, made with soju was very good as well, but needed to be colder.  The food came out shortly after.  My omelette was cooked to perfection and had a pretty good balance of ingredients...maybe a little heavy on the avocado, but nonetheless delicious; fluffy eggs and lots of cheese.  The potatoes were excellent as well as the sourdough bread...I wonder where they get it!!?? Yum.  He enjoyed his meal as well; the over easy eggs were also done perfectly.

On one hand, it is a genuinely excellent breakfast, at a reasonable by San Francisco standard pricing. I've eaten there twice now, and both times the food was fresh and delicious, with first rate ingredients.  The coffee was hot, fresh and they keep your cup full. The wait staff are friendly and maintain and calm demeanor and eye of the storm attitude, as if oblivious to the 75 people in line outside.\n\nThe main downsides are, of course, the weekend brunch crowd wait. When I arrived at 10:30 a.m. on a Sunday, there were between 35-40 people ahead of me. Had I arrived 5 minutes later, it would have been closer to 50 people. \n\nIt took 1.25 hours until I and my party were actually inside the restaurant. This is the 2nd downside. You're waiting in line, so you can...wait in line. Once inside the restaurant, you're in a new, cafeteria style line where you can watch them make your food. You order at the cash. Once ordered, you wait, yet again, for a table for your party size to open up. Which is really my 2nd and 3rd complain together, cafeteria style ordering. What if you want more juice, toast, eggs while already seated? Are you supposed to wait in line again?\n\nBy the time we left I had been there close to 3 hours.

At first I thought it was for the busser to pick up, but then I noticed they too were intentionally leaving it on the tables!  I understand you're working hard but I don't need a reminder every time I take a bite into my sandwich.  I ALREADY had to wait 1hr. 15 min. in line to sit here.  Thanks.\n\nP.S.:  To make the wait in line a bit easier, grab some Foccacia bread from Liguria Bakery across the street.  You can nibble on some food while you wait.  It's probably the best over the counter italian bread I've ever tasted.  The Pizza flavor is amazzzing ..... their hours of operation are a bit tricky though.  I never know when they'll be open!", "author": "Char C. B."}

If you're coming on a sunny day, it gets pretty intense in the sunlight so dress in layers and wear sunglasses as you wait.  The time it took for us to stand outside and then again in the line inside was probably 30 min in total and the wait to be seated and served had me antsy and hungry.  But it was definitely worth it! I got the Washington Square momelette and my friend got the Scrambled Florentine.  They were equally amazingly flavorful!  I don't even really like eggs but the filling of sausage, bell peppers and cheese made it delicious.  It came with red potatoes and 2 pieces of toast which I enjoyed with the homemade jam.  The jam was probably the best I've ever had- it doesn't have that thick paste consistence of the usual jam but instead had whole pieces of berries and a thin jelly mixed in.  Too me, it was the best part of the meal- two thumbs up.  \n\nReading the reviews, I originally wanted to try the French Toast Sampler but last minute decided on the Momelette because I wanted something more hearty.

And every dang person in the line was a tourist, replete with guidebooks and maps and loud conversations about Cleveland.  As tourists ourselves, we had little room to talk, but I think the line strengthened our resolve to seek out neighborhood places, not ones in the guidebooks.\n\nNow, it's not that I'm opposed to waiting in line for good food.  I think there are times when this is a perfectly reasonable thing to do - like when you're trying to get brunch in Chicago, for example.  This might also explain why we rarely find ourselves getting brunch anymore - we wake up hungry, and the idea of standing in line for an hour when we've already delayed breakfast by an hour or two is just unbearable.  We were later told that the line at Mama's can take more than an hour - no way is it worth it.\n\nOnce inside, we ordered our breakfasts - a French toast sampler for my husband and a tomato and prosciutto Benedict for me - then settled down for coffee and people-watching.  My Benedict arrived with overdone eggs and the overly salty prosciutto, but the hollandaise was mild and the slices of heirloom tomatoes helped to even it out. The breakfast potatoes were excellent. My husband was less satisfied with his breakfast - the French toast was dense and barely, well, French toasted - but between our two plates, we left full and happy.\n\nI'm not sure what advice I can give you about Mama's.  I'd say come hungry, as the portions are generous, but then you have to stand in line for an hour, by which time you might give up and walk away.  I'd say have a snack before you get in line, but then maybe the line will go too quickly, and you won't be hungry when it's your turn to order!  How about this: roll out of bed and immediately proceed to the Mama's line.  By the time you get to the front, you (and your stomach) should be awake.  That's the best I can do.", "author": "Elizabeth E."}

Worth the wait? Eh? It was a good breakfast - don't get me wrong - but worth the wait and the travel to North Beach?  I don't think so.  It could have been what I ordered.  I promised a friend I would try to the place again and go with her since she hadn't been.  I heard that most hotels tell their customers to go there so maybe that's why there is a long line and why there is a hype.  Non-locals are amazed and how good this place is which is probably true depending on where they live, but this is San Francisco, the mecca for foodies.

So the sampler and the eggs Benedict came first and I tried it and they were average...the look on my face was EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT. I was thinking to myself \"I waited 2 hours for some average breakfast?! The reviews on yelp warned me that this was food was not worth the wait...but then came the monte friggin cristo.

All it is is a ham egg cheese sandwich but the way they do it is they infused the egg like a french toast. And they give you this raspberry jam that makes it perfection.

Making people wait in line on the sidewalk is rude to the neighbors, pedestrians, and the customers.\n\nKudos to you if you can make food this good, but imo that's only one aspect of a good restaurant.  Get a bigger space, do take-out, get a permit to put tables on the sidewalk, take reservations, but don't make people wait on the sidewalk.  It's not nice.

But the line moves a lot slower than you would think which is because the seating area is rather small so it takes a while for turnover.  If it turns out to be a sunny day in SF, make sure you put on some suncreen and maybe even a hat cuz the sun hits right where you're standing in line and you can burn after waiting for so long.\n\nThe wait was worth it though. An hour and a half later, we were finally seated. Very cute cafe. You order at the counter and it's cash only so be prepared. \n\nWe ordered the omelettes - Farmer's and Mama's Children's Favorite.  Even with egg whites, they were very fluffy and flavorful not to mention huge. Coffee was above average.  I was very tempted to try the french toast but maybe next time. \n\nEveryone walks out of this place looking happy so I'd definitely recommend this place as long as you expect to wait up to 2 hours.", "author": "Mona S."}

The second time I came around 1 PM and the wait was a little bit over an hour. I guess coming here at that time might save you some waiting time since they close at 3 PM. It sucked that we actually have to stand in line the whole time and then there's more waiting when you get into the restaurant. \nThe boyfriend ordered French Toast Platter and I got the Prosciutto and Tomato Eggs Benedict. The French toast have 3 or 4 different bread and my favorite would be the cinnamon and banana bread. The fruit on top was really fresh. My Eggs was amazing. I think this really got me into egg benedict. The food was totally worth the wait, but if you plan on coming here, I suggest bring good company or something entertaining to do while in line.", "author": "Huyen N."}

What a crowd.\n\nAfter searching for the best breakfast joint in the North Beach area, I stumbled across Mama's.  The reviews looked highly promising, so I decided to give it a whirl.\n\nI woke up early on the first morning of my trip to SF, with hopes of beating the masses.  The air was crisp (and rather chilly) on my walk there, so my appetite was at full-strength, to say the least.  I arrived at 7:40ish, but to my dismay, the line was already about half a block long.  Being the persistent type, I decided to wait it out.  An hour later, I was finally at the front door.\n\nThe inside is a classic looking breakfast joint (think of your grandma's kitchen).  Once you're in, you'll have to wait in line again to order (it goes much faster though).  This is where the torture starts.  While waiting, you're forced to watch the chefs prepare all the amazing looking breakfast dishes that they offer.  They've also strategically placed the coffee cakes and other goodies in plain view.  Talk about  indecision.  \n\nUltimately, I went with the Rancheros (the Banana French Toast looked mighty tempting though).  It was delicious, and I'd recommend it to anyone.  The coffee here isn't fantastic, but it's not bad either.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nThe service here is friendly, welcoming, and laid back...which seemed to be the case for all the places I visited in San Francisco.  The food tastes great, so get yourself out of bed early and go enjoy.  Just make sure you get there early (I wouldn't arrive any later than 8).", "author": "Michael C."}

I wanted to be blown away with my dining experience especially after waiting over 2 hours 20 minutes to get into the door. We were in line at 8:45 my wife our 12 yr old daughter and myself it was Valentines day. We ordered 1 Crab Ceaser Salad, 1 Cranberry orange french toast, the French toast sampler & the North Beach Benedict so we could at least try the Hollandaise sauce. I just was not blown away with the food, I wanted to convince myself that what i was eating was the best breakfast in the City, all I could think was, is this all? It is good, fresh, the wait staff do their best in such a small place and the owner is very pleasant. My daughter was originally going to order the Monte Cristo but as we entered and about to order she saw the bowl of fresh cooked crab just sitting there waiting to be put into orders so the crab Ceaser was it for her, the Crab was very delicious. The North beach Benedict was very tasty the egg poached perfectly and the Hollandaise sauce was very good I had the french toast sampler, 3 different varieties of bread which seemed too dry, I had to add more jam which is home made and very very good. Then there was my poor wifey, she accepted the fact that at some time we were going to come here and wait, because this is a spot I have had my eye on, half way thru her meal which was the Cranberry Orange French Toast, she starts to get tears in her eyes immediately my heart sank, there was a curly hair inside the bread of her Cranberry french toast and she was disgusted thinking that she had consumed over half her breakfast thinking she had eaten someones hair. My wife immediately without causing a scene got the attention of  a server who came to my wife's side so my wife could show her the problem, My wife is Asain she has No curly hair and is currently a restaurant manager at a popular country club, she was so professional yet very mad about the situation. The server immediately offered to have something else made for my wife, and my wife politely said sorry She could not think about eating anything else. The server within two minutes was putting money on our table to pay for the cranberry french toast, I did not feel good about that at all.on the way out I suggested to the owner about hair nets. I have a hard time believing that this is one of the better Breakfast places in the bay good yes, but not the best. Mamas Royal Cafe in Oakland is just as good in terms of food quality.

After waiting in line for a little over an hour we were welcomed into Moma's.  We had decided upon the Crab Benedict and but were still deciding between the French Toast Sampler and the Sourdough Apple-Butter French Toast.  We decided to ask the cashier for his vote on the French Toast, FRENCH TOAST SMAPLER he directed us.  \n\nWe sat at out table and were brought out Mimosa's (now they tasted good but my mom and I were convinced there was no actual booze in these things as we were both empty stomached and felt nothing).  \n\nWhen our food arrived it looked yummy, but the meal was already cold when it was delivered to the table.  The Crab Benedict was good, not great but good.  The crab in it was tasty but the hollandaise was just average.  The potatoes however were at the same time slightly burnt and not cooked inside....hhhmmm.  The French Toast sampler was just disappointing.  The cranberry-walnut bread was good, but really didn't notice any egg toasted on it.  The banana bread while flavorful just crumbled when you attempted to eat it and the Cinnamon bread tasted like wonder white bread....very very disappointing  \n\nI have had far far better breakfasts in San Francisco (like All You Knead and Dotties) and elsewhere, I don't get why people wait for hours here.", "author": "Laura J."}

We also had the bloody mary which came in a decent sized mason jar, and was nice and spicy. We ordered the Monte Cristo and the crabs benedict at the recommendation of the host. The monte cristo was huge and had a nice mix of flavors. The crabs benedict were amazing. The fresh made hollandaise sauce was incredible, with a perfect tangyness and spice in it.

IS NOT A TOURIST TO SAN FRANCISCO, I AM A SF RESIDENT FOR OVER A DECADE WHO HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE DINING ALL OVER THE BAY AREA. \n\nWARNING: If you read this you'll be compelled to wage an all-hands campaign to revise, revoke, re-edit and break rank with any guidebook, website, blog or public record of any kind that recommends dining at... Mama's in North Beach. \n\nThis place sucks, and it's not worth the wait AT ALL. Other reviewers refer to the scores who flock to Mama's as lemmings and victims of clever marketing. I couldn't agree more. Once I checked out other single star reviews of this joint, I was further appalled at how Mama's treats customers--\"Moldy french toast?\" that review was classic. Anyway, here's another outrage to add to Mama's list of spurned customers and embarrassing customer service:\n\nMidweek the wait was still an hour from when I stepped on the line OUTSIDE to sitting down at my table inside. And, what's with the SECOND line inside the restaurant? You place your order with a cashier and PAY (cash only) without even the privilege of sitting down or taking a sip of water. ****What a great way to \"trap\" customers in the restaurant while you continue to wait standing inside to sit down at your table. And HOW CLEVER that they only take cash and they give you NO RECEIPT showing what you paid for and ordered!\n\nMeanwhile, there I stood at the front of the big inside line with another single diner like neglected livestock in a very crowded high traffic area-- WTF??!! People squeezing past every few seconds. What rocket-scientist thought of this system? It doesn't make anyone feel welcomed or special. You immediately feel like just another tourist, and warm body in the pursuit of profit. It didn't take long for me to figure how their system totally benefits the owners, see **** above.\n\nI repeat...WTF???!!!! \n\nWhat's even more sad. With this assembly line dining experience deflects, negates, amputates any poetry from the customer service experience. But, again, I don't think Mama's cares about customer service...\n\nAfter another 10-15 minutes of standing and waiting, a 'host' approaches me and the other single diner, \"Do you two want to share a table?\" Again, WTF???!!!! That kind of instant chumminess might work in a more loving atmosphere but as I've now waited ages the last thing I want to do it make awkward conversation with a stranger who is obviously just as frustrated as I. The host is noticeably pissed when I say, no, I'd rather not do that, and once my table is ready he practically yells at me to sit down.\n\nI sit down--more waiting. I even waited for ice water. YET, they have at least 4 people working the floor at a place that can serve only about 40-50 people at a time? Again-- WTF??!! Finally, my omelet arrives, and you know what, I'm so over this place that I don't even want to look at the indifferent host and the tourists who are shoveling food down hoping to justify the ridiculous wait.\n\n\"How are you?\" said the server smiling sweetly. Too little, too late. I took my food to go and ate in the park. By the way, when they packed up my food, they gave me a small baby fork! Hello??????? And, no jam. WTF????!!! I swear, this fork was like a golf pencil with tiny little tines--how am I supposed to eat a crab omelet with that thing??? WTF???!!! Their response, \"We don't have \"real forks\" right now... \"\n\n\"I'll give the place 2 stars,\" I said, \"if the food is out of this world.\" NOT!! The eggs on the omelet were not seasoned at all, too much avocado and not enough cheese inside, potatoes also very little seasoning, tomatoes--even during high tomato season in SF--flavorless&cheap!\n\nBland, pedestrian, predictable...Read all of the single and double star reviews of this place--they all attest that the food is very, very, very commonplace... similar and better can be found all over the city. They had a Sysco Food Supplier calendar hanging next to the register-- so you do that math. If you want a great brunch try The Butler and the Chef Cafe in South Beach, Foreign Cinema in the Mission, Brenda's French Soul Food in the T-loin--that place always has a line, but their beignets, shrimp and the Hangtown Fry are totally worth every second.\n\nMAMA's in North Beach aka MAMA's on Washington is PURE EVIL... The epitome of old guard tourist traps--high prices, super-long waits (remember! the outside line AND the inside line!), indifferent staff and incredibly mediocre food. Their set-up of ordering off the boards and paying at the register instead of being greeted and served by a waitress-- i.e., PAY FIRST AND EAT MUCH MUCH LATER-- is laughable, horrible, deceptive and shady all at once.

To be honest, the homemade Jam was the best thing there. I ordered the Washington Square omelette, which came with potatoes and toast. the portion was normal size, but i had maybe 7 potatoes cubes max, which was a shame because it was better than the omelette itself! I think Original House of Pancakes have better omelette and twice the size.\n\nOverall: Totally NOT worth the wait, skip out on the food and just buy the jam.", "author": "Tina P."}

Under my friend's instruction I had the Monte Cristo which was a plethora of cheese and deep fried goodness. My stomach felt like it was going to explode by how many of those things I was putting away.\n\nHe also got the french toast sampler which deliciously got eaten up. My favorite is hands down the banana nut french toast. I would stop by just to get baked goods from Mama's, it was definitely quite the treat.\n\nMy only big big thing was the selection of coffee and juices. I can't say that the taste of the juices and coffees top my list. They might wanna get a certified barista to start running the drinks. The Latte was extremely strong and bitter with no real bean taste and my orange juice tasted sort of like Minute Maid... \n\nAll in all, I heard the line can be pretty insane, I would say go early and don't expect to have a lot of space. It's a tiny quaint little area with literally 10 tables. That or get there at 8AM. I would definitely come again and BMOB.", "author": "Win\u00e8 C."}

Yes, sometimes I'm disappointed by how long I have to wait to experience their amazing French toast but never let down by the experience itself. Granted I do try to avoid this places on weekends and holidays, I don't have the patience to wait an hour plus for breakfast! I did that my first trip to Mama's now I go on weekdays. It's a great place to visit on a random Tuesday! \n\nHere's the scoop: You have to wait in line to place your order and pay, afterwards you will be seated. The staff is super friendly and so patient even on a jam pack day! This alone impresses me! \n\nThey have a huge variety of breakfast and lunch items. Love the fact that they also serve alcohol.

It is very cute and homely inside though, and the yellow decor makes it a sunny and cozy environment.\n\nOne plus is that because you order and pay up front, canteen style, it makes it quicker to leave once you have finished eating.

The line outside was to be expected, I was told, and although it was 1/4 of the way up the block, it moved fairly quickly. You're let in only when a table has opened up for you. You wait inside until you get to the cash register, where you order your food/drinks and pay before you're actually seated (of course you tip after your meal). Reading the previous paragraph back to myself, it sounds like a long, tedious wait, but I assure you it's not. They've got an efficient system here, so it doesn't take quite as long as it would seem, and the food is worth a short wait anyways.\n\nMy smoked salmon benedict was great, but my gf's monte cristo was simply amazing. Easily the best monte cristo I've ever had anywhere. Next time I eat here, and there will be a next time, that's what I'm ordering. If you're in a time crunch and looking for a quick breakfast, or conversely if you want to read the entire paper while you sip on coffee refills, this is not the place for you.

It occurred to me, as my fellow line-mates gawk at the food inside while rubbing their noses against the window like a Labrador in the back seat, certain tables on the inside must have some level of a fish bowl feeling to them. \n\nWe get in, order, pay and sit down. That's right, unique protocol and nuances, right up my alley - loving this already! My Monte Cristo comes out and I'm trying to figure out who ordered the French Toast. I mean it's covered in egg, sprinkled with powdered sugar, and flanked by strawberry and orange slices. I must say this though: If there was ANY resemblance to French Toast, it ended there. Upon digging my teeth into my first bite, I drop my fork, pick up my cell phone, transform into a 14 year old girl, and text Angie W the following: \"OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG!!!!!!!!!!!!\" \n\nAre you kidding me?!?! There was this cheesy meatiness that has to be experienced to be believed. Mama's serves a boysenberry jelly with the Monte Cristo that balances the saltiness of the sandwich with the sweetness of the jelly. Be careful here, the jelly is really sweet, so you don't need much. In fact, depending upon your tastes, you may not want any at all. Either way, frickin' delicious!!!!!!!! \n\nLet me tell you people, I may not have recipe for happiness, but I have no doubt in my mind that, what ever it is, it includes a Monte Cristo. \n\nI've been taking the pleasures of The City a bit for granted lately.

Although you can't go wrong with bananas, berries, and yogurt all churned together.\n\nItalian Omelette-Well done. Enjoyed the garlic cheese and pancetta stuffed inside. The potatoes were ok. The sourdough baguette toast was alright.

Looking for a spot  to park is a headache so if you can't find one go to one of the local parking lots.  \n\nOnce I got to the line we took turns waiting for our turn then you get through the door and there is still a wait for a table total time waiting 2 hrs.

My buddy got an omelet which he said made his day and we all shared the different kinds of coffee cakes.

My feet were killing me from standing in heels for that long.\nI tried something different this time, a veggie quiche, which was good, served with a green salad dossed in too much oil, a slice of orange and a whole 4 inch bagette, halved.  Hubs had the burger served in a French roll, it was OK but he thought it was too oily.  BFF thought her cinnamon French toast was wonderful and loaded on top with a ton of berries. Her hubs had an omelet which he liked, but couldn't finish.  The meals came to about $45. Food was nice but NOT worth standing in line for 1 hr 15 mins.  Thank goodness we were not in a hurry anywhere and wanted to catch up before she flew home that afternoon.  Even better, they're painting the building and the scaffold shelterd us from the scorching sun.\nIt's CASH ONLY.", "author": "Ry T."}

AND, I hate traveling to that area of SF because parking sucks.. and there are no direct bus lines from the inner sunset. =(  SF weather is also unpredictable and can be freezing cold! \n\nThis place lives up to it's hype.  If I were a morning person and lived closer, i would definitely come here.  Their omelets are big and they also have a variety of combos to choose from!  I can't remember exactly what I got, but I remember being blown away by my food... I didn't want to share any of it! =P  \n\nHere's a tip for all you willing to stand in line... look at the menu and decide what you want before hand.  Once you enter the restaurant, you go to the cooking area and order what you want.  No time to sit and decide what to get... Their specials are probably the best thing you can get... crab omelette or salmon?  DAMMN. Can you say YUMMY IN MY TUMMY?!  everything there sounds good... so you'll probably take the entire time standing in line to decide what you want... and then when you get to the counter and see everyone else's food, you'll change your mind =P\n\nPrices can be steep for breakfast... but it's worth it here.

I've been here 3 times with groups of 3-5 people, so I've heard direct feedback on 12 or so different menu choices. Invariably, all the people I dined with here said their food was very good to extraordinary. Mama's is a SF breakfast landmark from the past, it's been here for years and you can read some of Mama's history via wall-framed newspaper articles from long ago. North Beach location (on Washington Square near Coit Tower and many other sights) is awesome on a sunny morning, especially if you want to show some out-of-towners a slice of SF magic.  Yes, there really was a Mama, and you know mama knows how to do breakfasts right. This looks like one of those rare places where I think I could order almost anything off the menu and not be disappointed. \n\nCons: Seems a bit overpriced, even for the high level of quality. Mama's seems to be on the tourist circuit, thus: If you arrive after 9 on weekdays or 8:15 on weekends, be prepared to stand in a 20 minute to 1+ hour line that extends around the block.  Oh yes, arrive too late and the entire Mama experience changes:  you'll be stuck hangin' on the street in line with a motley & sometimes loud crew (read: don't even go after those times). Very few tables (12 or so), cramped space throughout, the entire place isn't much bigger than a small convenience store. But surprisingly charming ambiance packed into in that small space, and damn good breakfasts. \n\nGo early, beat the crowds, and enjoy a leisurely breakfast that *gasp* rivals your own mama's best.", "author": "Jack H."}

I could have breakfast for all three.\nIf there were 9 meals in a day, I probably could have breakfast for all nine meals.  \n\nYou get the picture.\n \nSo when one of my most treasured girlfriends called and said the magic word \"BRUNCH\"  - I was all over that like white on rice.\n \nI have heard of Mama's occasionally, but had never been.  I've basically remained faithful to Pork Store or Yank Sing for brunches, but with a considerable amount of time on my hands on this Thursday morning, we headed to Mama's to wait in line w/ infant in tow (not mine... hers!).  Though it was a pretty hefty line - I have to say that it moved rapidly, especially for such a SMALL restaurant!\n \nIt's an odd setup.\nWhen they let you into the restaurant, it's to order.  It doesn't necessarily mean there's a table open for you, but somehow, by the time you order and wait around for a little bit, one table opens up.  On this day, we scored a corner booth which was perfect for my friend, the baby, and me.\n \nShe ordered the \"Monte Cristo\"?  I tried it, and found it just decent.  If you like Monte Cristo, this is probably very good, but I am not a fan of the dish / concept itself.\nI ordered the Farmer's Omelette, and it, too, was just decent.  It was definitely bland, and there was just nothing impressive about this dish except that very fresh ingredients were used.  It needed more of a kick, and the combination of ingredients were a bit of a letdown.  Also - the home fries / potatoes were not all that great.\n\nThe Bloody Mary(s) I had, though, were great!\n \nService is excellent - - extremely friendly, and on top of everything!\n \nSo while I didn't really enjoy the food as much as I do at Pork Store, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the company.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-18", "description": "Food:\nI got the Dungeness Crab Benedict, which was so nicely balanced.  The crab came in the form of big, plump chunks.  The hollandaise sauce was light.  The baby spinach added a nice bitter flavor. The English muffins were perfectly toasted.  The side of grilled potatoes were cooked just right.  My only criticism of the food was that the eggs were just slightly overcooked.  I like my poached eggs to have runny golden yolk to gently ooze over my plate.  Although the very center of the egg was creamy, it resembled more of a soft-to-medium-boiled egg.\nHe got the French Toast Sampler, another well balanced dish.  They use 3 different house-baked breads and top them off with bananas and a trio of fresh berries.  One of the staff tipped us off to using the house-made olallieberry (a blackberry-raspberry hybrid) jam that sat on our table, which made a great breakfast plate even more amazing.\nThere is not much on the menu for vegans, but ovo-lacto vegetarians will rejoice!\n\nPrice:\nSome things are more expensive than others.  The majority of their breakfast and lunch items are reasonably priced ($7-10).  A few select items are a little on the pricey side, but justifiable.  Substitutions cost extra.\n\nAmbiance:\nThe interior is kind of small (hence the long waits), but so cute and homey.  I felt like I was in Mama's cozy breakfast nook.  Photographs and newspaper clippings about the establishment decorate the walls. We came on a day where the rare San Francisco sunlight poured into the room, creating a soft, sweet glow.\n\nRestroom:\nI wouldn't describe the bathroom as an \"outhouse\" like another Yelper wrote.  OK, it's not your traditional WC; you have to walk through the kitchen and outside and down a small set of stairs.  There is only one and it is unisex (so it smells a little like sperm).  But it's got a toilet, mirror, soap, and sink... what more do you need?\n\nParking:\nSucks.  You can drop off your friend(s) to wait in line while you circle around looking for a free parking spot.  Or do what I did:  I walked from my hotel, which was in Union Square (Tenderloin-adjacent).  It was a brisk 30-minute walk.  Just about all of SF is walk-able (that is, IF you are able to walk).  Or take the MUNI (30, 39, 41, 45, 8X).\n\nOverall Review:  \nThere is a reason why there are over 2000 highly favorable reviews (and counting) on Yelp.  There is a reason why Mama's consistently finds herself on numerous \"Best of\" lists.  There is a reason why people line up around the block and wait 1-3 hours.  I have waited 4 long years to try this place.  Was it worth the wait?  Yes!  Does it live up to the hype?  Yes!  Will I be back?  Yes!  Is $20+ a bit much to pay for a breakfast plate?  Yes, but I have to take into consideration that they use REAL crab.  They get bonus points for giving back to the community.\n\nTips:\nGo early.  Like, 30-to-45-mins-before-they-open-early.  If you don't want that big of a wait, I would recommend that you also go close to closing time because they do serve breakfast all day, BUT you may run the risk of them running out of certain food items.\nCertain dishes are only available on the weekend.  Use that opportunity to try something that you wouldn't be able to get Tuesday-Friday.\nBring cash or your debit card.", "author": "Cindy K."}

And by being a yelper, you would probably go to great lengths for food and will probably read this review and many many others to see what people say. So I'll focus on some stuff that others might not focus on as much:\n\nTHE LOCATION\nMama's is located on a quaint corner in North Beach, right near Washington Park. As you're waiting in line, you can chill out by watching the elderly asian folks start their day with some tai-chi, or walk across the street to get some delicious foccacia bread.  Do bring something to read, and do be prepared to wait.\n\nWhen my 2 friends and I arrived at Mama's, there were 3 people already standing outside the door waiting for it to open at 8am. By the time the doors opened, the line had grown to 10+ people behind us. After opening hours, the average wait to get in is about 60 min.\n\nTHE SERVICE\nBe prepared to order right as you get in! Mama's is also a seat-yourself kind of place, but thankfully that doesn't mean that the waitstaff is equally lazy. In fact, everyone seems happy to be there and to refill your water and coffee mugs.\n\nAnd last but not least, THE FOOD\nMy friend, Laura B, ordered the pancake sampler and ate them with the tableside jam...and loved them. I'd get those next time around. I had eggs benedict. They were well cooked, although the biscuit kept falling apart amongst all the sauce/egg yolk. I prefer my biscuits a little toastier, and crisper. Steph Y ordered a crab omelette and it had really big crab chunks + a good amount of avocado. \n\nSO... I'm glad I tried it. If it weren't for the wait, I'd probably go back more frequently...but Curly's is nearby, and usually has less of a wait. Way more practical.", "author": "aileen c."}

Mama's had been recommended in a book at our hotel, so we hopped onto Yelp to check the reviews.  All of them seemed to point towards a delicious breakfast, but a lengthy wait.  Now, my wife and I are not the \"waiting\" types.  I really haven't been that many places that are worth a significant wait.\n\nMama's was worth the wait.  \n\nWe arrived much later than we inteded, as many reviews pointed out that lining up at 730am for an 8am opening would be appropriate.  With a late night out, we had a hard time getting out of bed and thus ended up at Mama's closer to 8:45am.  The line was already down the block, half of it shaded, the front half of the line (right before you step inside) right in the sun.  \n\nWe waited nearly an hour outside, before stepping in doors to the \"inside line\" which was much shorter but allowed you time to see the chefs in action and some of their fresh baked goods.  The smell was amazing, and we loved watching the chefs cooking up their delicious treats.  We must have changed our minds about what to order 10 times while waiting inside.  We spent maybe 30 minutes inside waiting to order, and then waiting for a table to open up.\n\nMama's is a small restaurant (you could call it cozy if you're nice, \"cramped\" if you're upset).  It is nice and well maintained - and the staff was very friendly while we were there.  I can't imagine how hard it would be to be happy at all times when they are SO busy, but they did a good job of seeming that way.\n\nWe settled in on our orders - myself, I ordered the Washington Square Omlette (sausage, veggies, cheese) and my wife ordered the french toast sampler.  We also ordered a stack of buttermilk pancakes to share.  Yes, too much food for us...but really, we're on vacation, and we wanted to try it all.\n\nThe omlette was delicious - made especially so by the fantastic spicy italian sausage contained within.  It was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned.  My favorite part of the entire meal.  \n\nMy wife's french toast sampler came with 3 different types of french toast - each delectable in their own right.  Very different.  We liked the banana bread french toast the best.  The pancakes as well were light, fluffy and delicious.  \n\nDon't forget to try the jam they have on the tables.  It's made fresh there and I can't remember the name - but it was great on toast, great on pancakes and great on french toast.  \n\nService was quick and efficient (it would have to be to keep this place moving and seeing as many patrons as they do), and it was a decent value for the price.  Portions are good sized, but not outrageous.  \n\nSo for us, the wait was worth it.  We would definitely return, although we'd probably try to get there earlier.", "author": "Chris B."}

Most folks know about it since its sitting on the corner of one of the most famous SF neighborhoods.  But yesterday Mama's kind of saved my life. So I must pay tribute here.\n\nI had one of those sf \"wednesday blow outs.\"  And I was sh-sh-sh-shaking on Thursday morning.  So I hopped in my car with my royal ground double cappuccino and went up to coit tower to calm my spirits. It was a beautiful sunny morning in North Beach and this was helping me get through this surreal moment of edgy morning bliss.....\n\nAfter walking around in circles up on Coit Tower, I drove back down the hill to washington park.  Yes, Mama's was open.  I parked my car and went into St. Peter and Paul church to ask for some salvation.  It was a  brief but peaceful interlude.  Then I hustled back up to the corner.\n\nI swung the little half door of Mama's open and walked inside.  Not much of a line at 8:15am.  The only thought I could muster at this moment was \"french toast.\"  But wait, I can still read and the specials board conveniently had blackstone eggs benny written out in front of me.\n\n\"I'll take the number one special.\" I said.  Then I turned and grabbed the corner table by the door.  A little kid who was waiting for his dad sat down next to me in a chair.  I looked at him and he smiled at me while swinging his feet back in forth.  Oh god, he can tell?  Does he know what a mess I was last night.  I smiled back and said hello to the kid and opened my sf guardian....laughing to myself.\n\nThen suddenly the blackstone eggs benny appeared on my table.  \"I'm, umm dehydrated,\" I told the sweet waitress from Portland....  She got the hint and kept filling my water glass.  Another moment of clarity hit me.  This eggs benny is really a life source.  Totally fresh hollandaise sauce, fresh bacon, and home fries.....ah the sweetness of this warm dish was  filling and reinvigorating.  Thank you Mama's.  Thank you North Beach.  Thank you San Francisco.", "author": "Georgio N."}

Given this place it pretty small I understand why the wait is so long.\n\nI got the eggs florentine and it was delightful.  The eggs were poached to perfection.  Once you stick your fork in the egg the yolk comes oozing out mixing with the hollandaise.  How the egg is prepared can really make or break a dish for me.  I don't know what they put in their hollandaise  sauce, but it different than the norm and different in a good way!\n\nMy bf got the northern italian omelette which  has prosciutto, basil, tomato, cheese and avocado as an extra and it was delicious.  No tabasco, salt or pepper necessary.  The eggs were very light and fluffy which is something I'm not used to with omelettes.  There was a shell in the eggs, but I can look pass that since it tasted so good.  The dish also comes with a baguette and potatoes.  The baguette was good, but I was not a fan of the potatoes. \n\nThis place takes cash only so make sure you have cash on you before getting in line.

Calling it great would be vastly over-estimating it, while calling it bad would be slander.  I can in no way call anything they make the best, but I do appreciate that there is a great deal of individuality and effort put into each dish.\n\nOn a good day, I would call it the 5th or 6th best brunch in SF, based solely on food quality.  When you factor in the cost (at least 10% higher than everyone except Dottie's, which is the best) and the wait (by far, the longest in the city, averaging around 90 minutes), there is no reason to ever go there, when given options.\n\nHowever, if you do go to Mama's, get the french toast.  It's the best thing on the menu.  Portions are small-ish, but flavorful.  If you're hungry, get something else while you wait in line or you're going to need to eat afterward.\n\nAs a last word, it's good, not great by any means.

I got the French toast (or Swedish toast or some kind of toast) topped with fruit and with fresh squeezed orange juice. (Did I mention that home-made jam included with every meal.) I was careful... watching out for hairs in every bite. Their food has great presentation. Their baked goods are freshed baked, fresh, and very good.\n\n2. Three different people came by to apologize about the hair in my food including the chef. Which is amazing considering the next point....\n\n3. ... the food was cheap. Seriously. You will probably pay just as much at an IHOP or a Denny's and it won't look as nice, taste as good, or be as fresh.\n\nSo, children.... to summarize:\nGOOD PRESENTATION + GREAT TASTE + EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE + LOW PRICE = 5 STARS\n\nI've been to 5 star restaurants that are less apologetic about the disgusting things they try to serve me.... and its unrealistic to expect all of your chefs & food handlers to be completely bald... so I overlooked the hair thing.\n\nOne warning though...

Also, there is no take out. \n\nI recommend the French toast with comes with lots of berries. If you get eggs and toast, you'll be happy because they are perfectly cooked. Not too brown. Not too raw. The chef is a big guy who handles all the eggs. He wears a top chef hat and you can tell he's in his groove when he juggles 5 egg orders. Why do I know this? Because there is really no table service. You stand in a line that runs along the kitchen and order at the check out. This gives a perfect view of their tiny kitchen.\n\nBy the way, they make their own jam. However, it lacks pectin so it's very slimy at best. I hope their chef buys pectin to thicken it up.\n\nThere are a lot of brunch options in the city.

Also stellar was the Monte Cristo, a jumbo turkey and cheese sandwich dipped in egg and lightly grilled to hearty perfection.

Of course the food took a little longer, but luckily we had a snack beforehand to tame our appetite because we knew the wait would be awhile.  But even with our snack we devoured everything in sight.  \n\nI wonder if they serve brunch all day because I'm craving a Monte Cristo now!\n\nIn line, we met a family from France who saw Mama's in their guidebook.

Luckily, the most recent time we visited SF, there was no line yet on sunday morning.  we got there at 7:30 and were 2nd in line! by 7:45, there was a huge line behind us.  In addition to the pancakes, I ordered the dungeness crab benedict - which were amazing but they could have added a bit more crab for $21.  The coffee was fresh and delicious.  We also ordered the carrot cake with cream cheese frosting to go.  At mamas, pancakes are #1 (although I'd like to try the french toast next time) and the carrot cake is a close second.  Best carrot cake I've ever had.  You can see real shredded carrots, and the cake itself was so moist and the frosting was the perfect touch - not too sweet either.  We chatted with the baker on his out to go home for the day - he was very proud of his work and I can see why. He does good things at Mamas.\n\nThey only accept cash.", "author": "tina y."}

Wonderful little traditional breakfast shop that truly embodies what San Francisco is all about. It has the old school SF feel with the architecture and the comfort of a traditional diner.\n\nThe food is quite good, got the Monte Cristo which is an amazing culmination of flavors when you add the homemade jam. I think in the end I ate more jam than sandwich but both are great. Prices and portions are reasonable. \n\nYou order and pay at the counter, service is diner-like. Not a whole lot of seating so make sure you get there early or super late. The line is quite ridiculous, might need to make like Black Friday and camp out the night before.", "author": "Ed L."}

This is my only negative comment though.\n\nThe food looked amazing, everything was super fresh. Everything ran efficiently, and the environment was so warming. So on to the food. I had the crab benedict, and it was pretty good. The crab was insanely fresh, but i felt it just needed a bit more flavor overall. Still I highly recommend it. My girlfriend had the french toast sampler, which was also pretty good, but a bit overwhelming(the sweetness). I've had better, but this is definitely among the best. \n\nThe freshness alone makes the food amazing, everything was bakes fresh (blueberry muffin was INCREDIBLE).

The good thing about the indoor line is you can watch the cooks do their magic and you have an excellent view of all the breads, pastries, fruits etc... You also have some time to review the menu (albeit it is difficult to see the chalkboards).\n\nWe had a french toast variety and a salmon special, 2 coffees, an OJ and a Mimosa (champagne/orange juice $7.00 fair price but the taste was bitter and it was served almost at room temp) plus 3 to go pastries. The presentation and the flavor of the meals were very appealing and good.   Service is fair (I think they are just too busy and overwhelmed) and you feel a bit rushed while dining (likely because of the huge line).  Coffee is blah...shame shame.  Overall price is a bit high.  Our total cost for two including the three pastries was about $70 (with tip).\n\nThe place is tiny. I have mixed feelings about the ambiance due to size and how busy the place is.  There is only one restroom that is very tiny, outside in back and down some narrow stairs.  They need to lease adjacent space or maybe make an arrangement with the city to put some picnic tables in the park across the street and then take to go orders from folks in line outside who don't necessarily care about going or sitting inside. \n\nIn short most will enjoy the food and dining experience.   However, the wait is ridiculous.  Is the food worth the wait....for my wife and I, no.  However, some folks will likely argue it is.  The overall value is a judgment call.

This place is really recommended for parties of 2, if you want seating right away. I understand that because of the small size of this restaurant crowding is unavoidable but a system of ushering your guests to wait outside or near the back would have been a nice suggestion rather than the rude barking of demands to \"clear the aisle.\" It is like the staff was unequipped with handling large crowds, though that is how is has always been there.\n\nThe packaged experience was horrible and I plan to never again set foot in this restaurant. I now fully regret paying a gratuity of 15% for a meal that was accompanied by exceptionally awful service just because I felt the pressure of staff eyes and hovering.

We all agreed we must come again! \n\nIt was tough deciding what to order, as the menu was full of goodies.  We ended up going with a Monte Cristo, the Dungeness Crab Benedict, and the Northern Italian Omelette.  We dined family style and shared everything.\n\nThe MONTE CRISTO was a thing of beauty.  Four golden wedges of turkey/ham/cheese sandwiches egged and grilled into perfect, perfect French toast.  Lightly dusted with powdered sugar and accompanied by a small ramekin of homemade boysenberry sauce.  Oh my goodness, savory and sweet, warm and light, this dish answered every one of my needs!  As I took my first bite, my mind began to hum.  :)\n\nThe DUNGENESS CRAB BENEDICT was also quite good.  The poached eggs especially were done really well.  The egg whites were so tender, but still completely cooked.  And though I'm not a big fan of crab usually, I enjoyed the meat here, which was fresh and tasty.  The Hollandaise was also nice and mustardy.  I'm glad they didn't drench the whole dish in it.  The English muffins at the bottom, though, were soggy and a little sad.\n\nThe NORTHERN ITALIAN OMELETTE was a let down for me, but my two dining partners really enjoyed it.  I found the egg overcooked, with both the texture and the flavor reminding me of a rubber ball.  Very strange.  The filling was also lackluster and rather generic.  I didn't taste any basil or pancetta.  Maybe it was late in the day and some ingredients ran out.  But again, the people sitting to my left and right thought it was good.  \n\nThe grilled red potatoes that came with each of the dishes were so-so.  My sister makes the ultimate oven roasted version with cilantro/garlic pesto and peanut butter(!), so perhaps I'm overly critical here.\n\nThe housemade berry jam, which is really more of a sauce in texture, is very good and also pretty for the eye.  It's magenta, a little tart and not too sweet.  A drop of it goes well with everything.  \n\nService was excellent all around.  The wait staff, the bussers were across the board very efficient and courteous.  The owner was also very personable.  All are truly praiseworthy.  The vibe at Mama's is full of goodwill and welcome.

After waiting outside, you wait in line inside and take your order and stand there till a table is ready. It's definitely small and a tad cramped in there but worth it. \nThe food was delicious of course. I had the pancakes with fresh fruit. the pancakes were thick and fluffy and the fruit was all perfectly ripe. I also had the orange juice. and it was obviously fresh squeezed. It wasn't that cold which was surprising but totally worked. \nAs long as you come with expectations of waiting and good food, you will not be disappointed : )", "author": "Kathryn G."}

So we braved the line and arrived on a Saturday morning at 9 am.  Boy was it long!!  We ended up waiting a total of an hour and 15 minutes (this includes the line outside AND inside).\n\nI ordered the Dungeness Crab Benedict and my husband had the French Toast Sampler.  Both were very good and their homemade jam went perfectly with the french toast.  There were huge pieces of crab meat which I appreciated.  For $18.50 though, I thought that was a little steep.  Both of our meals along with one orange juice came out to $38.  Their portions are large so we were both stuffed when we left.  Our waitress along with the entire staff was very friendly.\n\nOverall great food but wouldn't wait in line for over an hour for it again.  Being from the Washington DC area, my husband and I are used to restaurants with elaborate brunches and breakfast items like Mama's.  I guess in San Fran a place like this is more rare.

Came here last Sunday (rainy sunday) hoping the rain would fend off some patrons.  Waited probably 30 or so minutes outside, then 15 inside for 45 min total wait.  We got inside right before the downpour began, so we were able to actually eat here.  Had we arrived 15 minutes later, there is no way we would have waited in that rain.  So that was that.\n\nFor food, I had a florentine scramble, and a 'side' of the french toast sampler.  I wanted bacon, and the florentine had that.  I wanted sweet, and the sampler had that.  So I got both.  The french toast sampler was awesome, with fresh fruit and 3 different varieties of dessert bread tastefully prepared for my ravenous appetite.  As for the scramble, that thing was gone before I even realized it.  Got it with the sourdough, and the cheese, bacon, spinach and potatoes that accompanied it all were also dominated.  I didn't feel too pushed by other patrons, even with this weather.  I may have been too into the matter at hand though.

And then when I got to the windows I saw all the people eating the beautiful plates of food I was smelling, and then even after stepping foot inside I spent a good chunk of time watching the chefs cooking while waiting to order and be seated. Everything was good and the jam was delicious and worked REALLY well with the monte cristo and I usually stay away from any type of jam. The four thick evenly battered and grilled pieces of sandwich was the perfect texture with the right ratio of meats to cheese. My favorite from the French toast sampler HANDS DOWN was the orange cranberry walnut bread; the others didn't stand out too much, but still thick and fluffy nonetheless.\n\nStaff was friendly and attentive among the chaos inside and the tiny diner felt like a local establishment you'd visit in a small town, even though there were too many things going on. Overall, the food was delicious but I'm not sure if that was because my stomach was eating away at itself by the time I took my first bite or if it really was that standout. Maybe that's the key to their system: get you super hungry so you think the food tastes better, and since you're hungry, you eat fast so seats get freed up faster?

I am truly more of a breakfast at noon kind of a girl, so a place like Mama's is perf. for me, serving b-fast until the late afternoon. \n\nEveryone's heard of the place, seen the line, and wondered what the big D is. Well, I am here to tell you. After you wait in the line outside, you wait in a shorter line on the inside. The menu on the outside window is helpful so you can get a head start on what you would like to order. Once you're in, you're golden. The smell of french toast and pancake batter is tantalizing. Your eyes will gloss over as you see bowls lined up on the counter brimming with fresh fruit. The kitchen/counter is busy and makes you realize how fresh everything really is. \n\nThe menu has tons of variations of french toast entrees, omelets, scrambles, pancakes, and lunch choices (salads, quiche, sandwiches, etc.) I had an egg-white veggie scramble with fresh fruit on the side (so good and healthy to boot). The P-Cakes w/ fresh berries were also amazing (one order can easily be shared). You pay when you order so sit down, enjoy an excellent  breakfast, and leave your tip at the table. \n\nFYI: go with the fresh OJ (or a Mimosa). The bloodymary was not the greatest.", "author": "Theresa T."}

Very long. So you must go there with someone whose company you truly enjoy, so much so that the SF chilly wind wouldn't bother you. Otherwise, you would inevitably raise your expectations for the food to compensate for the pain, which is not really fair (especially if you intend to yelp afterwards).\n\nSecond, Mama's has some interesting dishes you would not want to miss. Their serving portion is generous. Unless you are going there in a large group, and especially if you are going there with just one another person besides yourself, make sure that your companion LOVES to eat and LOVES to eat a lot.  \n\nThe first time I tried Mama's, the wait didn't bother me. Love was in the air. We shared Dugeness crab benedict, day's special omelet, and the combination french toast. Needless to say, the 6'3\" 230+ lbs then-boyfriend and 5'3\" *cough* I cleaned up the plates, smiling, laughing, and savoring each bite. The french toast was made of three different kinds of sweet bread, which gave each slice different texture and varying degree of sweetness. It's fun sharing it with someone and discuss which one's your favorite and why. With the homemade jam, this was the best french toast I'd ever tasted. The Dungeness crab benedict was made of fresh and authentic ingredients, where each ingredient retained its original flavor yet worked together beautifully. This was truly a 5+ star experience. \n\nThe second time I went there, the wind seemed colder. The wait seemed much longer. Once inside, I ordered the divine french toast to boost my mood along with some kind of eggs benedict, and the pretty boy ordered  the Dungeness crab benedict. After a long wait, the food was served, and I was disappointed. The poached eggs were over-cooked. The model-thin pretty boy didn't seem to enjoy eating too much and just poked his eggs and took a few bites of crab. The french toast was still good but went cold and hard barely touched. The food was still good, but the magic was gone.  I felt like this was a 3 star experience.\n\nNext time, I'll go there on a weekday alone, just so that I can write an objective review.", "author": "Nana N."}

We got there early to try and beat it, 8am or so, early for a Sunday. The line didn't look too bad, but we had no idea how little tables they had.

The pancetta was slightly too salty for me but overall it was still delicious.

Don't like my french toast being too soggy or too sweet. I heard that their syrup isn't unbearably sweet tho and tasted healthy ^_^ Out of the 3 different french toasts, I liked the orange cranberry one the best, then the swedish cinnamon.

Because I tried Dottie's first, I was not as wowed by Mama's as I might have otherwise been. Even though Mama's is right in my North Beach neighborhood, I would still choose Dottie's... \n\nBUT... Mama's is in a great location overlooking Washington Square Park. The restaurant is super cute with a little French 1/2 door at the entrance and cute, colorful tables inside. You can probably expect to wait in line about 30 minutes during the week and an hour on the weekend... so bring good friends so that you can chat in line (and then steal their food once you order!). You order in front of the kitchen which is cooking up tempting deliciousness. Both times I've come, I've ordered egg dishes and been a little bit disappointed. My friend tried the crab omelet and it was delicious but EXPENSIVE (about $16?!). I've heard that the sweets with fresh fruit are really good and will probably need to try them next time... Mama's also serves up mimosas, bloody mary's, okay coffee, etc so you can pick your morning poison. I'd recommend checking out Mama's but knowing that it's, at best, only the second-best...", "author": "Meghan P."}

It's supposedly THE brunch place in San Francisco because people wait what seems to be eons for tables, as it felt that we did this morning. Granted, we were a party of 5, and in this tiny little restaurant, fitting 5 of us definitely seemed to be a bit of a chore. \n\nWe stood in line outside the restaurant, then stood in line inside the restaurant to order our food from the slightly surly lady behind the counter. Then we went back outside the restaurant to wait for our table again. All in all a strange way of going about things. \n\nBut, I must admit, when we did get the table, it was very much to our liking. Large and round, which is always a good and social way to seat a party of 5. But the food was rather dull, I must admit. The omelette and home fries were, well, not what I'd stand in line for, and the coffee was HORRIBLE. But, on the other hand, the bacon was nice and crisp, and I usually mainly gauge a brunch place on how they do their bacon. In this area, they are on the right track.

IHOP was the best, but I hate Fisherman's Wharf.  On my first morning in San Francisco in nearly a month, I have no food in the fridge and I'm in desperate need of a filling breakfast to jumpstart the day.  Since it was a weekday and I was weighing the options at 7:30 in the morning, Mama's came to mind.  Surely, all the frat boys and sorority girls that I see waiting in line on the weekends would be just rolling out of bed or enroute to the FIDI.  I was wrong, arrived a bit after 8 and there was already a line.  Not a big deal as I figured it was now or never.  I was surprised that it was all tourists in line so Mama's must be prominent in tourist publications.\n\nWhen you finally get inside, you think that you've reached salvation, but nope you're tortured even more by shuffling single file past the assorted coffee cakes that are spilling over with crumble and baskets of fresh fruit and seafood.  Although I'm leary of trying fruit that is sitting next to salmon.  I would think the odors of the fish would corrupt the essence of the fruit.  I played tribute to my own Mama and ordered what she would have ordered, the North Beach omelette.  \n\nThe only good thing about the setup is that the food usually arrives within minutes of getting seated at a table.  The food was close to perfection.  Omelette was stuffed with veggies and cheese, but I thought the roasted potatoes were a bit on the bland side.  Decor was more impressive than I thought it would be.  I was expecting mismatched dive in desperate need of an overhaul, but I got a bright cheery Provencal atmosphere which this Francophile appreciates.\n\nI'm not a big fan of lines so the only time that I would be likely to return is on a weekday, when I play hookie from work.", "author": "Amy Z."}

Initially I was loathe to make him stand in line for 40 minutes. But he was totally unfazed as were people 2 yards behind us. I couldn't believe how nonplussed they were to do something like this for breakfast, which I consider the most disagreeable meal of the day. I think I have trouble digesting eggs, I hate sugary maple syrup and jam, coffee at that hour makes me feel strung out but homicidal and I'd just rather be in bed sleeping. But there we were. My back started aching after 25 minutes, but my dad stood there rigid like an old marine waiting for marching orders.\n\nWhen we finally got inside the staff were incredibly nice. The system for getting people up to the menu and the ordering place then to your table is very organized and painless. And even though you've already ordered and paid, the table service is very attentive and friendly, and they offer you coffee the entire time, never making you feel rushed. There is no turn'em and burn'em feeling here once you're inside, at all. That would have killed it for me having waited as long as we did.\n\nThe first thing we saw was the beautiful display of quickbreads and crumbles, We couldn't resist piece of the regular crumble - it was buttery and amazing, quite sugary but splitting one prevented it from being overpowering. From the many excellent-sounding choices on the menu, I got the florentine scramble and my dad got the northern italian omelette. We were both very happy. I was very impressed with how fresh and non-sandy the spinach was, and as promised the scramble contained bacon which was plentiful and of excellent quality. \n\nThe french toast made from banana nut bread really tempted me, as did the banana walnut french toast and the brioche french toast. There's lots more to try here, and I'll come back when I have time to wait in that line and when I have enthused companions. \n\nI can honestly say even though I don't generally appreciate breakfast and brunch that this was exceptional.", "author": "Roxmarie M."}

I grumble, whine, scratch my ass, and pretend that I went back to sleep while I try to sleep.\n\n730AM:  the sexy lady  is like WAKE UP NOW WERE GOING TO MAMA'S!!!! (I almost sh*t in my pants)\n\n745AM: I'm dressed well, showered, brushed my teeth, washed my face yada yada and out the door.\n\n8AM: turn onto stockton and start bitching about how theres never no spaces to park in north beach.  Cuss at all the north beach residents, DPT, SF, people that are fortunate to live near mama's while the sexy lady emotionally supports me.  \n\n810AM: car is parked on the other side of a hill from mama's.  I'm out of breath and cuss under my breath some more as I see a 20 person line in front of mama's.  \n\n815AM: Bored shes reading anthony bourdain's book, im reading my haruki murakami book.  \n\n9AM: We get let inside to suffer through a smaller yet more torturous line because we get to watch as people eat our favorite breakfast in SF.    We watch as chefs prepare a hollandaise sauce thats drizzled over perfectly poached eggs.  Potatoes get grilled to a crunchy brown with bits of onion.  pancake batter is poured like silk water and the instant the batter hits the hot griddle an explosion of memories of sunday morning breakfasts with your family  emanates from your olfactory nerves to through your mind as you breathe through ur nose.  \n\n915AM:  The sexy lady wants crab benedict, I have the california omelete although the washington square wants to be devoured by me also, but so does half the other items on the menu.  We can't resist getting pancakes since their berries are incredibly sweet and theres a sweet surprise waiting for first timers at Mama's that sits at every table so humbly it often gets forgotten.  \n\n930AM: We're finally seated, I sip my hot cocoa like a little school girl and she sips her coffee ready to do business.   I stare at the humble Mama's jam, in its little plastic container with its little spoon.  Little do people know this is what makes mama's so unique.  Their homemade jam.  Its not overly sweet, and its made with tons of berries.  I love berries, and I love mama's jam.\n\n945AM:  Our breakfast arrives, our table is crowded because of our order of blueberry pancakes but we can finish it.  The freshness in every ingredient for both our benedicts and omelete are immediately noticeable.  Its simple american breakfast fare but everything is cooked well and cooked with really good ingredients.  Even the strawberry that garnishes the pancakes is as sweet as the maple syrup.  But F the Fing syrup I take spoonfuls of it with the pancake bits into my mouth, oh Mama's you could be billionaires if  you charged for the option to have this blessing on my table.  Oh but please don't because I'd have to give up so many luxuries in my life for that jam.   \n\n1030AM:  The sexy lady has a smirk on her face like she just had some incredible sex.   I'm satiated beyond any other happiness this world could offer.  I'm contemplating just sleeping or defecating for the rest of the day.  We stroll off in glee.  \n\nDon't even contemplate going to dottie's if you can make it out to north beach!!!!!!!!!", "author": "Tomo S."}

Mama's is a fairly small restaurant with about a dozen tables but you order before you're seated so that speeds up the turnover A LOT.  You'll find a typical breakfast menu here with a variety of pancakes, eggs, french toast and pastries.  Everything was very fresh and prices seemed aligned with most other breakfast places- about $8-10 a plate.  A group of us sampled:\n\nFrench Toast Sampler- the orange cranberry was decent- though a tad too flavorful for me, the cinnamon was sooo good- like eating a cinnamon bun but less gooey, and the chocolate was good as well.\n\nShrimp and avecado eggs benedict- the avecados were sooo good and creamy and fresh.  i expected the shrimp to be tasty but it was just boiled and bland for my taste, but they loaded my plate with lots of shrimp.\n\nCalifornia Egg White Omlet- great healthy option, but nothing out of the ordinary.  it's hard to mess us breakfast foods like this, though i must say everything was really good and fresh.\n\nMonte Cristo- I always try to stay away from monte cristos in general cause you just feel horrible afterwards, but this one was a much healthier option, not greasy at all.  very very good.  every one at my table loved this dish.  \n\nOverall great place with decent prices.

If you are white and love breakfast places (redundant) you have go here once in your life. How can it be worthy of an hour plus wait? \n\nI was determined to find out. With my white friends (hey, I like to be as authentic as possible), I waited in line for an hour. They have an odd service system that makes tipping difficult. We had to stand in line and order with the cashier. The couple behind us were seated and had table service. \n\nI had read so much about the eggs Benedict so I had to try that. I really wanted the crab version but at $18 it was too steep for my recession budget. I settled on the shrimp version. Anyone can toast an English muffin, poach some eggs but it takes talent to me a good hollandaise. Mama's version was good, light, but not lemony enough for my taste. \n\nI'd heard the mythic tales from my white friends about the hour long lines for french toast. Pain perdu is just stale bread that the French reuse. Mama's famous french toast was a bit of a let down. I was expecting something closer to a soft bread soaked in milk and eggs resulting in a custard texture. Unfortunately, it appears that they simply dip the slices of bread in egg. True, they use banana bread for the french toast but it is just banana bread dipped in eggs then fried. Doesn't sound too appetizing does it? I'd rather just have the banana bread. I have to admit the presentation with all the fruit is lovely but I care more about how it tastes. \n\nSo I can check Mama's off my bucket list. When do I receive my honorary white status card in the mail?", "author": "Monica L."}

I ordered the monte christo which was decent as well as a corned beef benedict. They were out of corned beef, would have been nice to know before waiting in the half hour first line, but I was already committed so I got the shrimp benedict instead as did my buddy.\n\nI have never had such fishy tasting or dry shrimp in my life, were literally the consistency of overcooked Idaho spuds, very obvious they just through some old frozen shrimp into a pot and put them in. The eggs were good but the holandaise sauce was very sour and almost tasted rotten as well, the flavor may have come from the rotten shrimp.\n\nLong story short I refused to eat mine and stuck with my monte christo, my buddy ate his and is now extremely sick. If waiting an hour for mediocre food and food born illness is your idea of  time and money well spent then this is the place for you.\n\nThere are plenty of great breakfast eateries in this city, there is nothing special about this place that warrants the wait, glad I tried it, won't be going back.", "author": "Erich G."}

Of course I also checked it out on Yelp. Everyone sure was right!! Definitely one of the best breakfasts I've had. I was considering ordering the Salmon scramble but everyone on yelp raved about the Monte Cristo so I changed my mind. I am SO glad I did. I would have been very sad if I never tried it. People can tell you how good it is but you'll never believe it til you experience it for yourself. So go try it! Bf got the dungeoness crab omelette, it was good but wasn't great. Even less so since my monte cristo was only half the price! I will definitely crave it when I go back to New York. The pancakes were good too, very fluffy with crispy edges, I love that. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Go early! We went on Sunday, got there 30 minutes before 8 when it opens and there was already a line.", "author": "Mary H."}

You can't miss it since there is a line that branches out from the corner.  \"There's a line?\" you ask?  First and foremost, it's not a ridiculous line.  Secondly, be prepared to wait for an hour or so before being able to be seated.  The owners are aware of this line and offer water and samples to those who are waiting in line.  A menu is placed on one of the windows so that you have a chance to decide on what you want so that when they take your order, the process is streamlined.\n\nOnce you make it inside, it is packed, the hosts/hostesses, servers are really busy.  This does not take away from the hospitality that they give to all patrons.  They are courteous and friendly and they make sure that your order is to what you have specified.\n\nWe were seated and since we had a large party, it took a bit to get the food out.  Some restaurants bring the food over once it's ready; here, they bring all of it out so there's no waiting.  Our party ordered quite a bit ranging from the French Toast Sampler, to multiple types of \"M'omelettes\" where some contained dungeness crab and salmon, while others with traditional ingredients.\n\nIf there's one M'omelette you have to try, it's the Florence M'omelette. Not only is it an omelette with crispy bacon inside, it contained some greens and cheese that tied the flavors together effortlessly.  I paired a beer with our brunch, but the reason why I paired a beer wasn't because I liked beer.  Mama's is the first place I've been to (that I know of) that serves Anchor Steam Beer (Yay San Francisco!).  I couldn't pass up that offer.\n\nThe overall experience was great even though there was a wait in line.  Plan accordingly because parking is a little difficult.  Public transportation is best and if you walked, even better.", "author": "Nicklaus B."}

It was fun and completely distracting to watch chefs at work, preparing such dishes as French toast and eggs benedict with a creamy hollandaise sauce.  I kept changing my mind about what to order...bouncing back and forth between a savory omelette to sweet stack of pancakes.  So, what did I do?? I combined the savory and the sweet and asked for a Monte Cristo sandwich.  SCORE!!

So when friends suggested that we have breakfast at Mama's and then told me it'd be an HOUR wait before we'd be seated, I was indignant and ready to march to Chinatown to pick up some take-out dim sum. After much persuasion- and because I was craving fresh squeezed orange juice- Mama's prevailed and I waited dutifully in line along with the rest of the herd to see what all of the hype was about. \n\nI'll admit- the breakfast is pretty good here. Although I ordered the dullest thing on the menu (2 eggs over-medium with Canadian bacon), my breakfast companions were more adventurous and their fluffy omelettes and pancakes covered in fresh fruit made my plate look like green eggs and ham. Who knew Canadian bacon wasn't really bacon but ham instead? I was horribly tricked . . .why are the Canadians always trying to differentiate themselves from Americans?  \n\nThe orange juice and home-made jam did make up for my ham surprise however. I did notice that I was the only person in the entire restaurant who picked white over wheat toast, which I found a little funny. I mean, you're already gorging a heaping plate of 3 eggs, bacon and pancakes smothered in maple sauce. How much more damage are a few pieces of white bread going to cause?\n\nAnyways, I left Mama's satisfied- it did exceed my somewhat mediocre expectations. I still would pick a bowl of pho over it, however, the fried rice may have been beat.", "author": "Alice P."}

Well, it's really the seating system that they use. You wait and wait and wait on line outside, then you get inside and you're still in line!  Once you order at the counter, you might have to wait some more to get a table.  By the time you're seated, the food comes about a minute later. Even if you're a slow eater, you only spend a few minutes at your table.  I can appreciate that this helps more people per hour to enjoy Mama's yummy food, but it doesn't have the lazy Sunday morning brunch vibe that I am after.  I would almost say that this is the place to go for a quickie brunch, except that you could wait an hour in line before getting the quickie part!

My fiance had some kind of omelet, which was also amazing. We ate the jam on his toast, and it really is incredible, like everyone says.

First tried Mama's almost a year ago and every time I eaten there since the same has held true: \n\n1)  They make the best fresh baked coffee cakes ever - hands down\n2)  The service is friendly and efficient\n3)  Plan on 30 minutes minimum to get a table - but believe me it's well worth it.\n\nIf your ideal breakfast includes fluffy omelettes/eggs, perfectly cooked sausage/bacon, a side of home fries, and maybe a short stack buttermilk pancakes - then this is your spot. \n\nI think I would eat breakfast here at least three times a week if I had no job, time was never of the essence, and I didn't mind a 44\" waistline by the end of the year (oh, did I forget to mention - NOT health food).

Free methadone? WalMart to open the day after thanksgiving? No. Eggs and toast.\n\nThe system is structured very poorly. You wait outside. You wait inside. You wait at your table. (unless you're a group of 2...) This was quite painful. Eating breakfast at noon is painful on its own.\n\nOnce I had food in front of me, it was great. I would argue most anything would taste great after waiting two hours--but that seems to be the name of the game here.\n\nI couldn't discern if they had any specialties--the menu seemed pretty standard, but the basics were done really well. \n\nSo overall, If i could skip the line somehow, I'd be happy to go back.\nI guess my main qualm is with the concept of waiting two hours for breakfast without there being anything discernibly inventive or exquisite at the end of the tunnel.", "author": "Eli A."}

You see, the lines are horrendous on the weekends and I'm not willing to wait more than two hours for food, but was obsessed with trying the place. \n\nThe key is to get there at 7:30 a.m. and stake yourself in front right when it opens at 8. To our surprise, there was a small line that had already formed at 7:30. \n\nI have to say, I don't really get what all the hype is about. I mean, I know it's a SF institution and all, but why is the line snaked around the block with throngs of people patiently waiting for nothing extraordinary? \n \nThe bread selection was fabulous and the French toast sampler was definitely tasty, but my smoked salmon eggs benedict had a hard yolk, which is a pet peeve of mine. Proper benedicts are meant to have a runny yolk and a place like Mama's that turns out thousands a week should know how to get it right. So I did what I am not fully comfortable doing, and sent it back.

I hope that a breakfast eatery as special as Mama's is on every street corner in heaven- right next to a Costco hot dog stand.

If you're fortunate enough to have yourself an easy breezy Sunday with no planned agenda in view, visit Mama's and allot yourself 2 hours for the entire experience. Chat with friends whilst waiting in line outside, bring a newspaper, answer work emails- whatever you want cuz you're GONNA wait. There is NO escaping it (unless you arrive at 2pm, then it's a slightly more decent wait time of 30-45mins). \n\nMama's makes their  omelettes with only uber-fresh ingredients.

The taste of the pancetta is really brought out in the eggs.  The omelette's super flavorful and loaded with ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it off of my SO's plate.  I've also tried the famed Monte Cristo here.

The service is great too, particularly, by a server named Betty T. :)  However, it just pains me to have to wait for food when I'm already hungry.  Coming to Mama's requires a plan, which consists of finding a treasured parking spot in North Beach, getting a spot in line, waiting in the sometimes cold weather for that warm \"hello\" that allows you to enter the restaurant, ordering your food, and hungrily waiting for the food to arrive.  And frankly, when I'm hungry and wanting to break my fast, I don't want to go through all of that.

It's a very basic breakfast/brunch/lunch place that attracts a huge crowd solely because it's an institution in SF.  You'll almost certainly have to wait in a long line.  I have waited for as long as an hour and a half to eat here.  I don't see what the fuss is about.  I've had the \"Momelette\" which is a basic omelette, among other bland omelettes on the menu.

If I'm going to be waiting over half an hour to eat, it's got to be amazing.\n\nI was not and am not amazed by Mama's.  Save yourself the time and go to Mo's Grill instead.\n\nIf you choose to disregard my advice and do end up going here, be aware that once you actually get inside the restaurant after your hour-plus wait, you have to continue to stand in line until you reach the cashier.

It's a little steep for breakfast, so again, is it worth it?  I had omlette, which, had excellent fillings, but the eggs were a little too firm, and it wasn't really fluffy.

All the items are prepared with care and made with fresh ingredients. The pancakes are impossibly fluffy, the french toast melts in your mouth (the half stick of butter might have something to do with that), and the eggs are filled with delicious fresh goodies.

They were all delicious and the seasoning was just right, especially the French toast's topping of fruit, which was not too sweet, so I liked it the best. We had a fun time.

We had been told by at least 10 people we had to go there and if we didn't get there early we'd be waiting in line.  The second part we screwed up.  After we were able to regain our equilibrium, walk and shake off the head fog from the previous night we headed towards\n\nMAMA'S ON WASHINGTON SQUARE\n\nMama's is a motherly feel inspired too small bakery and restaurant.  I say too small cause on a Friday around 11:30am when people should be working, this isn't LA where people don't work, we were standing behind about 30 people outside of Mama's.  We were told it's like this everyday and weekends are even worse.  Mama's line is like nothing I've ever seen (Pink's in LA is the closest).  While most restauants have a waiting list or people just hanging artound outside, at Mama's the line starts inside the restaruant at the register and travels up the block elementary school style, one person behind the other.  The employees regulate how many people come inside at a time and if you leave the line you're screwed, you've lost your place.  Standing there you wonder if Mama's is worth it?  Well you should see the food first.\n\nOur party of three ordered Prosciutto and Tomatoes Benedict, the Vegetarian Benedict and a special, the French Toast Sampler. \n\nThe Prosciutto and Tomatoes Benedict was very tasty, a mix of salty flavor from the prosciutto, creamy hollandaise sauce which was a little bitter or sour, which is a nice original touch.\n\nThe Vegetarian Benedict was just as tasty.  If you read me often you know from my burger eating that I'm as carnivor as they get, but this vegetarian dish packed the power of a carnivore's punch, full of flavor.\n\nThen came the sugar and like Jesse James' obsession with sexy tatted-up pinup models my obsession is with sugar.  I like Jesse's obsession just as much, but they don't have \"Those\" kinda girls at Mama's.  Not only did I order the French Toast Sampler but I ordered two slices of Cinnamon Sour Cream Walnut bread.  Today I was all about the carbs and the sugar.  The French Toast Sampler was fantastic, two of the three.  What was cool about their french toast was they make it with their sweet breads and cakes. (The basket of breads photo is what they use to make the french toast) One piece was banana nut topped with fresh bananas, swedish cinnamon topped with berries and another was cranberry orange walnut, which I could have done without (just my personal taste).  The banana nut and the swedish cinnamon was soo sweet and tasty I didn't even need syrup which is like Jesse James and Tiger Woods not needing sluts.\n\nBy the end of my french toast rampage I was stuffed.  I had also eaten the last bites of both of the Benedicts.  I stand to see good food go to waste, especially not after waiting 40 minutes in line.  But we were still left with the Cinnamon Sour Cream Walnut bread.  My friend and my cousin were waving the white flag.  BITCHES!  But I still had the motivation and will to at least try these heavenly sweet pieces of decadence.  I dove in and it was everyting every coffee cake in every coffee shop around the world tries to be.  It was sweet but not too sweet, spiced but not too much cinnamon, and soo moist I thought it was attracted to me.  (This is me chuckling.)\n\nI didn't try the Chocolate Drizzle Crumb or any of the other spectacular baked items they bake fresh daily, but they all looked amazing and if the line wasn't forever we probably would have gone back to try them. \n\nWhile Mamas is a great meal, a fantastic breakfast\nand was worth waiting in 40 minutes in line in the hot sun for, it wasn't good enough to do it again.  Nothing against Mama's but I don't really know any meals I'd wait 40 minutes for.  I totally go to Mama's again if I was back in SF but not if I had to wait in line.  No line means I'm there, otherwise SF offers too much good food to be standing in a line.

My bf hates waiting, but I got him to admit that our one-hour wait was worth it.  :-)\n\nGive this place a try if you're in the area.  You won't regret it!", "author": "Diana C."}

My daughter mowed her scrambled eggs, and my son couldn't even finish his pancakes they were so huge (and really fluffy).  The wait staff was great and helpful in storing our stroller.

If you get the A-team, your eggs benny has a hollandaise that is perfectly balanced, your omelettes are perfectly light and filled with flavorful ingredients, and your salmon and crab are light and fresh. Simply put, all elements come together to make you realize that the 90 minute wait wasn't only worth it, but that you've had one of the most deliciously simple breakfast meals of your life.\n\nIf you unfortunately are greeted with the B-team, however, things may look the same on the surface, but all of the sudden the wait you endured doesn't seem as  much of a payoff. The hollandaise has separated slightly, and the food lacks overall freshness and delicacy. \n\nFrom what we can tell, the A-team works the weekend crowd.

I've heard so many good things about this place and it just didn't live up to my expectations unfortunately.  I came here with my friend Jeff who moved to Seattle a few days later.  Jeff loves eating so I thought this would be a good place for our final SF meal together.\n\nI knew to expect a long wait.  We arrived at 10:15 on a Friday morning and a long line had already started.  We arrive to the front door and end of ordering line about 45 minutes later.  Probably sat at like 10:55 and got our food around 11:15 or so.  So all in all waited an hour for food.\n\nI ordered the french toast with the apples and lemon sauce stuff.  There was an advertisement on the window for it winning an award so I thought it would be a good choice.  Jeff got a salmon scramble thingie.  We both got mimosas and coffee.  Jeff got toast with his meal so he got to try the olallieberry jam.  \n\nMy meal was ok.  It was french toast made with a bagutte cut long-ways.  The french toast was really eggy which I like.  It takes a bite out of the sweetness.  And this is just that--VERY sweet.  It has this lemony sauce in the place of syrup and sauteed apples on top of that.  It was just a little too sweet for me.  \n\nI ordered a chicken apple sausage on the side and it was amazing.  You could tell they cooked it in the same pan they cook the bacon and other fatty yummy stuff because it was pretty greasy.  Which was nice because it definitely gave me a nice break from the sweet french toast.\n\nI tried a bit of Jeff's scramble and it was pretty tasty.  Nothing spectacular but very good and had fresh salmon.  He also got a side of pancakes and they were probably the best thing either of us ordered.  Light, fluffy, perfect combination of salty and sweet.  Pretty much why I love breakfast in one wonderful bite.\n\nAlso, Mama's should be commended for the olallieberry jam.  Its soooo fantastic.  My mom took my sister and I and some of our childhood friends olallieberry picking every summer north of Half Moon Bay and it brought me back.  So tasty!\n\nAll in all, I think I had WAY TOO HIGH expectations of Mama's, maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  I don't know.  \n\nEither way, I like both Chloe's and Ella's much better.

To really enjoy the experience, you definitely need patience and a little bit more patience. My suggestion is to meet old friends and make it an event as opposed to just getting breakfast real quick. Before you go to Mama's, have a coffee. Try not to drive since parking just adds to the agony. Don't forget that there is yet another line once you make it in. That's when you hopefully start to work on your appetite. \n\nTalking about the food, everything that I have had thus far is really delicious. It's probably best to qualify \"everything\": eggs, eggs and French toast. The orange juice is freshly squeezed and very tasty. Don't order the small since it's really a teaser portion.

I was beyond stuffed- even for an exercising foodie and I managed to devour everything w/out popping out at the seams (a miracle in itself.) The jam was good but my boyfriend said he could do w/out it (I beg to differ- it did bring some pizazz to the bread).\n\nAt the end, IDK if it warrants a 1 hour wait. Dungenuss crab in an omlette is unique but not that special.

However, with the constant crowds comes long waits including waiting for your food. This resulted in my eggs benedict being served cold. Although the staff was polite and soon brought me a new hot dish, the whites of the eggs were not cooked through and the hollandaise sauce had way too much lemon. Don't know if this was an isolated instance of poor execution but I suspect that with the great amount of popularity Mamas enjoys also comes lapses in the wake of large crowds.

I read the Yelp reviews and tried to figure out the best day and time to go. We decided on a Tuesday morning and we arrived around 7:15AM. Yes, we are crazy, but not that crazy to wait in line for over an hour and waste any of our precious time in SF waiting in a line. There were seven people ahead of us. By the 8AM opening time, the line wasn't too bad. So, we got in with the very first group that morning. We got lucky! Yeah! \nMy husband ordered the french toast sampler with berries and he fed me a bite. It was fresh and delicious. I am a cereal gal and not much into pancakes, waffles, french toast, eggs, etc. and I am not hungry so early in the morning so I ordered a fruit cup and sourdough toast. This was definitely some fresh, yummy sourdough bread and not at all hard and chewy. I spread some of their homemade raspberry jam on it and it was delicious. The fruit cup was fresh and flavorful. We also got some baked goods to have for snacks later. All delicious. We both enjoyed our breakfasts while we watched some groups doing line dancing to Chinese music at Washington Square Park across the street. Wonder what happened to the tai chi classes? \nFYI: Make sure to bring your cash. Extra charge applies for debit/credit cards. Menu is posted in the window so you can make ordering decisions quicker. The people waiting to get in will be staring at you and your food. Well, mostly your food! It's not really a place you can linger too long since people are waiting. We were the first one's done and out the door. Also, you can work off the calories by climbing up Filbert to the Coit Tower and back down the other side and go to the Ferry Building in time for the Farmer's Market.

Anyway, got inside pretty quickly as well.  Decided to try something new - a mistake, should have at least stuck with the monte cristo as originally planned.  \n\nWe ordered:\nOne slice each of the blueberry coffee cake (super moist, full of blueberry - yummy yummy and delicious!) and crumb cake - both are served warm.\n\nEggs Florentine - 2 poached eggs covered with spinach, mushrooms and Hollandaise sause served on English muffin w/homefries.  Must admit I was underwhelmed. One of the eggs was over cooked and in general it was just ok.  \n\nEggs Benedict with tomato and prosciutto - both eggs were perfect but still nothing to write home about, not sure what it was but somehow just expected something very savory with prosciutto.\n\nMama's Sampler French Toast - slice each of cinnamon, banana nut and cranberry orange with fresh berries.  We had wanted the Kugelpuph French Toast - home baked brioche Bread w/nuts, raisins, and cinnamon but they were out - 11:30am only, how's that possible?!?)\n\nCoffee is still great, always piping hot and refilled at the right moment.\n\nHomemade jam is still yummy as usual.  I think we will stick with the monte cristo and omelets if/when we return.\n-----------------------------\nFolks, we waited a little over an hour in the cold weather and we will go back again!  Crazy, perhaps!  But we are not alone, plenty crazy people in front and behind us.  So, just plan accordingly - bring a favorite book, crossword puzzle, PSP, iPod or whatever...\n\nWhile waiting outside, I was constantly peeking in to see when tables may become available.  When i see that there are open tables, WTF was flying all over my head and narrowly escaped my mouth...with shit load of people waiting, what dumbass is managing the place?!? Well, turns out they have a different system.  \n\nFirst of all, the line continues inside.  When you get close to the door, someone will ask you how many in your party then close the door on you.  Once you are inside, you can see the open kitchen, the yummy yummy food and the menu.  When you get close to the register, you order and pay (CASH only) then wait to be led to an available table.  This also explains the cash left behind at the table - it appears the wait staff leave the previous tips behind as a reminder to you before they take it away when your food arrive.  Not a bad idea as a reminder.\n\nWe ordered:\nNorthern Italian omelet ($9.95) with pancetta, mushroom, basil, tomato, and garlic jack cheese - served with home fries and your choice of bread.  This was delicious!   The pancetta was so tasty along w/ the juicy tomato, the nice fragrant of basil and the garlic jack were a perfect combination.  \n\nMonte Cristo ($8.95) - turkey, ham, cheddar and Swiss on white bread-dipped in egg & grilled, served with homemade jam - Heaven!   Just imagine a tasty turkey, ham & cheese sandwich french toast style - the cheese melts but don't spill out...it's freaking clever and damn divine!  It's sprinkled w/ powder sugar and served w/ your choice of home fries, cole slaw, potato salad or greens.  \n\nEach table has a jar of their homemade jam - SO good, I piled it onto each bite of my toast, OINK!\n\nWe also had a side order of the crumb cake.  It was brought over warm with our coffee.  The coffee was surprisingly pretty good - it was HOT and the wait staff was very good at refilling the mug at the right time.  \n\nOh and who do we see waiting in line behind us?  Rob Schneider.  Surprisingly, he is a lot better looking in person than in movies.  He appears to be a regular.\n\nThe waitress asked how long we had to wait, when we told her a little over an hour...she asked if it was worth the wait...our answer?!? \n\nWe'll be coming back!", "author": "Gloria H."}

(sorry chloe's, your croissant french toast is great, this kugelhof would be world renown if more people knew about it).  actually, maybe it is world renown, the line to get into this place is ridiculous, i have literally seen it go around the block.  as in it went down the street, you turn the corner and it went down the entirety of the next street.  needless to say, the weekend is not a great time to go, but if you see a short line, jump in and enjoy the best breakfast you will ever have.\n\nsince i haven't hit my 5001 world limit, i will go into how wonderful the omelets and ingredients taste.  since everything is absolutely fresh, there is no mistaking that all of their flavorful omelets are delicious.  from the washington square with fresh panchetta to their south of the border blackbean omelet.  \n\noh, and they have this thing called an apple pan dore, its french toast with sliced apples in some crazy sweet sauce.  try their bacon or italian sausage with this.  its divine.\n\nas you can tell, i get very excited when thinking about eating at this place, its mouth watering.\n\nlunch... \n\nslim joe burger\nmonte cristo\n\ntry them, love them, let them show you how food should be prepared.", "author": "Wayne L."}

Here's what I have to say:\n\nOne hour wait standing outside. Once you get inside, you stand in line at the counter facing the little grill/kitchen and watch the food being cooked. This is where you get sucked in, hook, line and sinker. Everything looks and smells great. Menus are on big boards and by the time you get to the front of the line inside, you place your order and pay. Then you wait a little bit longer and then are taken to a table.\n\nThis is a small establishment, they have 13 tables and no counter (which explains the long wait). \n\nDrinks arrive shortly thereafter by friendly staff and then the food comes a bit after that. That actual wait for the food wasn't long. \n\nThe food: exactly as it states on the menu and very very good. Prices are right in line with decent breakfast joints. The french toast is really good. \n\nThe bathroom: it's out back (literally), you walk through a part of the kitchen, outdoors, down some rickety stairs and low and behold, a small 1 stool tiny toilet room. It's like an outhouse but painted orangey/pink to make you feel better. \n\nWe had several staff pop by and make sure everything was good and I really had a good time.

I've tried some good ones (Bill's in the S. Bay, and Cafe W in Berkeley) and unfortunately Mama didn't make the cut. I tried the french toast sampler, and unfortunately if this is a sample of Mama's best, I think Mama should stick to other items. \n\nThe sampler has three types of toast, the cranberry something or other, the banana and the cinnamon. Of the three, the cinnamon was the only one that wasn't unbearably dry, but it was a thin piece, half the height that I usually associate with french toast. (Sure this could be my own deranged psychosis, but I have come to expect french toast to be think, about an inch, but I've been known to like thicker especially if it of the \"stuffed\" variety). \n\nAnyway, the best one of the three was the Cinnamon because it wasn't dry and tasted ok. The other two were not horrible, but they more like taking banana bread or cranberry bread and tossing it on the grill. I much prefer my toast to be drenched before grilled and moist even before the syrup goes on. Again, to each their own, your mileage may vary. \n\nWarning, Pet Peeve Influenced Rant:  I hate it when places burn my food, and Mama went and gone and burnt my dang potatoes.  It really ruins my meal when I have to pay for something I would throw away if I made it at home.  If I want carcinogens I'll go to the neighborhood park and lick the dirty BBQs, please don't burn my potatoes!\n\nOh and somehow they managed to burn some of the potatoes while one was buried inside that was almost entirely uncooked.\n\nOn the plus side, there was no wait at 8AM on a rainy Friday morning and the egg dishes looked good, so I'd be willing to go back and try the benedicts, after all Mama probably can do something right or else this place wouldn't be so popular..... right?

It was a surprise because we love to dine out for dates, but at first I was irritated at how long the line was. It wasn't until we got inside the door that I saw a glimpse of the place. The diner is pretty small - in fact, it looks like a small local diner for breakfast or lunch, preferably. Actually they open early in the morning but close before noon, hence the looooooong line to get a table. It seems as if the customer service was quick but efficient. Everything was fast paced; ordered our food and then pay at the register. Simple as that we found a seat for us. The rest of the time, me and my boyfriend barely talk because we were indulged in our meal. Yummm.\n\nMy only criticism is the size of the diner. Due to the fact that there is a high demand of service in this place, they should expand the diner. However, that still doesn't overpower the delicious food I ate ;)", "author": "Charmaine Marie L."}

We stood for an hour outside, in the hot sun, with a small awning providing only partial relief.  Once inside, the hostess was nice enough to pull us out of line, seat us and put in our order for us, or we would have waited longer.  She didn't do this for anyone else; maybe she felt sorry for my wife, who was five months pregnant.  \n\nYet, we both agreed the food was worth the wait.  Maybe the best French toast I've ever eaten, and very, very, very good crab eggs Benedict.  Except for the spinach.  That dry mouth spinach effect set in about half-way through an otherwise perfect Benedict experience.  The hollandaise sauce was to die for.  The potatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The grapefruit mimosa was delicious, as was the juice alone.  I cleaned my plate and part of my wife's and somehow was able to walk afterwards.\n\nIt's just too bad all this quality comes at such a high price: You have to wait on the sidewalk, in the sun. There is little seating on the sidewalk, and little shade. Once inside, you continue to wait, at the counter, where you put in your own order and pay for it, like a fast casual restaurant. What table service we had was very good, but it was only partial table service, and the ambiance, while cute and comfortable, was nothing to write home about.  \n\nAnd how you will pay.  My crab Benedict, which supposedly is Mama's specialty, was $20.  The plain Benedict was $12 or $13, so it cost an extra $8 just to add a little delicious crab meat?  That's four-star luxury hotel restaurant prices, minus the four-star ambiance and the four-star table service.  Of course it was worth it.  As if to highlight Mama's complete and total power over its customers, they don't accept credit cards and charge $1 fee for a debit card.\n\nChances are that you go to Mama's for the food, and the food is incredible.

There's a line outside to get in.  Then when you get in, there's another line and wait to order and be seated.  \n\nOUR FOOD:\nWe ordered the crab benedict, the monte christo, and the french toast sampler.\n\nI RECOMMEND:\nThe crab benedict was really not all that great to me.  It tasted pretty typical and not really any more superior than any other crab benedict I've had.  The potatoes were pretty standard.  \n\nThe Monte Christo was excellent.  This was the first I've had a Monte Christo so I don't really have a frame of reference, but it was a great introduction.  The flavors sound weird, especially with the jam, but it worked very well to complement the saltiness of the cheese and meat.  \n\nThe french toast sampler was also very good.  I'm a fan of meals with variety, so the choice to have three types of french toasty was definitely my steeze.  All three were very good.  \n\nTHE CONCLUSION:\nI doubt I'll come back here, only because of the wait.  It's good food, but not worth an hour wait.", "author": "Per C."}

It's not really sweet, but far from bland and no kind of syrup is even necessary. The waiter was so friendly and provided excellent service. He recommended that I enjoy my french toast with their mixed berry compote (which you'll find on each table), rather than the syrup. My oh my... their berry compote was perfect. It wasn't too sweet and it was loaded with berries. Definitely a better substitute than the traditional syrup. I'd love to have this for breakfast every single morning. \n\nEveryone else said their omelette's and potatoes were good, and so I tried some.

Not surprising for SF on a Saturday around brunch-time.  Lack of any indication of their seating process, we entered, expecting to find a hostess or a clipboard upon which to register our name, etc.  Instead we were gruffly dismissed by a busboy/bouncer who was guarding the door from the inside.  His only comment before shutting us out was to \"wait outside and we'll call you.\"\n\nOnce inside, the ordering and seating process was unclear, to us and just about everyone else in line.  It seemed awkward to order in line then just stand there clogging up the works while waiting to be assigned a table.\n\nI understand the assembly-line flow, but they could do with a little communication to the patrons.\n\nBarring the waiting experience, the food was delicious.

Unfortunately, I didn't think the food lived up to the hype.\n\nIt was 9:30 on a weekday, and I ended up totally underestimating the line. When I went to Dottie's, it was a Saturday morning, so the line was obviously ridiculous. But the line here at Mama's was just as bad.\n\nI ordered the Washington Square M'Omelette (Italian sausage, tomato, bell pepper, and jack cheese; $9.95) and a large glass of orange juice ($3.75).\n\nWhenever I order breakfast, the thing I look forward to the most is the potatoes. The grilled red potatoes here didn't do anything for me. It was bland and slightly undercooked. The other major disappointment was the orange juice. I'm used to the small and pricey portions of fruit juice at a restaurant, but the one at Mama's wasn't very good.\n\nNo complaints about the omelette -- it's the reason for the four stars. Nice and spicy, with a good serving of meat inside. The other positive point about the restaurant is the staff -- they were all very friendly and polite. Even the cashier lady, who appeared pissed off until she actually started to take people's orders.", "author": "Ryo M."}

The flavors are really yummy and indescribable best eggs benedict I ever had!  \n\nIn addition to the benedict, we usually share the french toast (we've tried different kinds with mixed berries and love them all).  The french toast comes with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and a splash of chocolate syrup on the side.  Mama's makes their own syrup that goes well with their french toast or pancakes.  The best French toast plate is the Sampler plate (and I think we added berries).  Our last sampler plate included Cranberry Orange Walnut, banana nut and original french toast.

Dont even worry about putting your name on a list becasue there isnt one\n\n2. Eventually you make it to the front door and they usher you in only to wait in another line to order. THis can take up to 20 minutes sometimes on top of the already 1 hour outside wait\n\n3. You now reach the register and place your order you pay and then are told to wait again for the next available table to sit at\n\n4. Finally after starring down the family of 6 that are taking 3 tables they get the hint and leave, the wait staff quickly scrambles to divide those tables up so you can sit and enjoy your yummy north beach breakfast\n\nOrder the low fat french toast that is dipped in yogurt and apples. I can't see how this is low fat but who cares its Damn Good", "author": "Gabe G."}

The line was less long than usual so we examined the menu and immediately recoiled at the $18.50 shrimp and dungeoness crab omelet options.  \n\nMy first thought was \"WTF!

They are always heavily laden with seafood, (to compensate for the outrageous pricing), and they are often watery and downright fishy, and/or rich and overpowering.  \n\nTo top it off, the fact that they would dumb-down precious dungeoness crab by wrapping it in egg and cheese earns them the douchebag award in my book.  That is on par with ordering a Knob Creek bourbon and mixing it with Diet Dr. Pepper.\n\nMy boyfriend tried the shrimp omelet and was highly dissatisfied.  (See above said reasons why seafood omelets do not work) He was also expecting prawns and instead the omelet was over-filled with baby sweet shrimp.  \n\nI thought I would keep it safe and order the proscuitto benedict, which was one of the few other items on the menu that is inarguably difficult to fk up.

I said, okay, I'll Yelp it and see what those Yelping people have to say about Mama's.  I trust the Yelpers, they have never lead me astray.  We were not disappointed.  We arrived at 9 a.m. on Sunday morning and  we were the fourth party in line outside of the door.  I think there were about 4 parties inside who were ordering. \n\nBefore I walked in I had decided that I would get the crab omelette until we got inside and I saw one of the cooks assembling the french toast that was featured on the specials board. OH MY STARS again!  Yummy-licious french toasted bread with what I think was laced with dried cherries. The toast was topped with a whole sliced banana, fresh rasberries and strawberries, sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Oh and they serve it with a little pitcher of syrup.  My husband ordred the crab and spinach eggs benedict.  Perfection with plenty of crabmeat.  His plate also featured very tasty home fries. The waitstaff was very kind and very attentive.  I asked our server to please compliment the chef and his assistants on their preperation of our food. You have to try this place.  You will not be disappointed!", "author": "Kate L."}

Let the stars be the judge of that. I got the Monte Cristo. It was very delicious with the jam they served with it. The frites/potatoes were also delicious and crispy as well. Maybe because I was waiting for such a long time without eating anything before that in that line that made me hungry and think the food was great....i know...run-on-on sentence...but that's to express my point. it was delicious enough that i cannot grasp the words or statement to write it down. Anyway, definitely worth a try if you're in SF to visit. If you are there during the weekdays as well, I suggest going then when people are working...so there hopefully is a shorter wait time. Possibly around 1 or 2ish is went it may be empty? Sorry, I wouldn't know. Don't live in SF :)", "author": "Jessry H."}

I usually cringe at the thought of waiting half an hour, but for Mama's I consider myself lucky. I had their french toast for the first time rather than going for my usual savory foods - omelettes and eggs benedicts. I found the chocolate cinnamon french toast to be overly sweet and nothing special. Their Kugelhopf tasted like the regular raisin brioche that I bake since I love making french toast with either brioche or challah. The best one out of my sampler was the swedish french toast. Overall, it was underwhelming and overhyped. There are a lot better french toasts in SF, especially in Mission district. I've tasted better at most places from Luna Park to Foreign Cinema to Universal Cafe. Mama's better up their game, especially as the wait is atrocious!", "author": "Ned C."}

Do expect a long wait just to get inside if you are not first in line when they open.

The long wait is not because the service is slow.  Definitely some of the best service and hospitality my wife and I have ever received.  I ordered a local favorite....The Monte Cristo.  If you've never heard of this sandwich it is like the best ham and cheese sandwich you've ever had.  Inside is ham, turkey, cheese then dipped in egg and cooked like French toast.

We began with a couple slices of the Cinnamon sour cream bread and the Old fashioned crumb cake. Both were out of this world. Fresh, soft, not too sweet...the crumbs melted in my mouth. For our group of 5, we ordered 4 plates: The Monte Cristo, Mama's french toast sampler, and 2 omlettes (one with italian sausage and the other with pancetta). French toast was superb as always- covered in fresh berries. The omlettes and potatoes spectacular! But the real yum of the day was the Monte...these little sandwiches of ham and cheese were dipped in an egg batter and fried...along with homemade jam, wow all of us couldn't get enough of it. It truly is a must!\nSo yes, all you tourists from Europe, do come and try the Monte Cristo! We Americans are proud to share!\n\nService was good as always! Friendly and never pushy...even for such a tiny place.", "author": "yeana j."}

But, this weekend was beautiful and my friend from Pittsburgh and I didn't mind the warm sun on us while we were waiting. I think our total time waiting (began at about 10:30 a.m. Saturday morning) was about 45 minutes. One of us held the line while we each checked out La Liguria across the street and my friend ended up returning with a huge and very tasty rosemary foccacia. \n\nOrdering is a little different, when you get to the front door, they ask you how many are in your party, then they let you in and you wait in line again in front of the glass where you can see the cooks preparing the meal (my friend changed her selection about four times before we actually paid). Then you pay - cash or debit (but they charge $1.00 to use plastic). You wait again until they can seat you. When they do, the food comes out pretty quick. \n\nWe both shared the french toast sampler and the Northern Italian. We were full, but not dying full. The jam that they have on the table is really as good as everyone says it is. The waiters were really nice, they sometimes weren't too available for questions because they were walking around a lot, but there are other guys that are constantly filling up your water and asking you if you're enjoying your food. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend a visit to Mama's and I'd definitely go back when I have time to wait. There are are tons of fresh choices and really interesting creations for breakfast.", "author": "Katherine R."}

When we were allowed to enter, (only a couple people at a time were permitted to enter since the restaurant was already full!

Who knew the love would last after all these years. \n\nWhen I first moved to the Bay Area in 99 a couple of friends wanted to take me to the City and kept raving about a place called Mama's. Now coming from the Midwest I had in mind a soul food place filled with comfort foods that would revert me back to that fat little kid from Indianapolis however when you get there you realize (1) this isn't that type of place and (2) its going to be a loooooong wait to get in.  It's bad enough that parking can be extremely tricky in the Washington Square area however even more discouraging is looking at a long line that brings back memories of my club hopping days. Fortunately for people like me unlike those SF clubs, Mama's welcomes all walks and not just the \"best looking/best dressed\". From the tourist from France, to the young couple in love, to the pet owner who dresses her dogs in sweaters although its 85, to the guy flying solo who comes only with a word puzzle. \n\nOnce you get up to the window you almost feel like its teasing you... you can see but don't touch as you see happy customers slowly enjoying their food as you watch like young Oliver begging for more. When your ushered in you notice even more how SMALL this place is. Just imagine your dorm room in college and subtract a couple feet. You start to wonder where there going to squeeze you in when your drawn to the cooks using their utensils like artists. You gaze over the fresh made breads, fruits, and omelets just made and think you know what you want until something else is made then you change it again... and again.I've had several amazing items including very delicious  Dungeness Crab Benedict , Nelson's Rancheros, and the\nNorthern Italian however the one thing I come all the way from San Jose to Mama's for is the same thing over and over... the Monte Crisco Sandwich. I order it so much that guy who I always see there knows what I want and this is even after I had not been there in over a year! Talk about knowing your customers! The Monte Crisco sandwich is the one thing that people will stare and point at you through the window. If you've never had it you MUST try it... a perfect combination of Turkey, Baked Ham, Cheddar and Havarti Cheese Bread dipped in Egg and grilled served with Homemade Raspberry Jam cut in triangles dusted with powdered sugar that will make make you feel like your eating at a 5 star restaurant while sporting flip flops.  First time I was told about it I thought there was no way I eat a sandwich with raspberry dipping sauce but after one bite I was a believer. Wash it down with a cold Mimosa and your day starts off better than anything Tony The Tiger puts out there.\n\nOverall, this is my favorite place for breakfast or brunch in the City. Delicious FRESH foods, nice staff, interesting people to meet in line, and one of the oddest places for a bathroom you'll ever see... trust me just make the trip back there and you'll see. No matter what your taste in food is, you'll find something there to savor. The only cons...  Long days you can stand in line for up to 1 1/2 hours so you might have to run to the meter again and put more money in since parking authority has a cruel sense of humor in SF. Not sure how they could do it in that space but like to see them get a lil bigger so you don't invest 3 hours of your morning just for breakfast, and also like to see Mama's come into the year 2010 and start accepting plastic instead of cash. Mama's though is the type of place you normally see in movies that you wish you could also experience.

Poached eggs were gooey, runny and perfect. The blueberry sour cream cake was delicious. Bacon came out hot and fresh still dripping with a little grease.  Good solid food, but I can't say I'd wait that long again. There are tons of brunch places in the city just as good, at least for eggs benedict. So why two stars? A note to the manager, if a table has been seated for a good long while, one person has finished their meal, the other two are well halfway through their plates, do not allow their friend rushing in late to order food (especially when she isn't even prepared to order), further holding up the large table when there is a line of people outside of your restaurant who have been waiting for over an hour or more. This is completely unfair to those that have been standing patiently for a spot. I felt really bad for those still standing outside watching this happen. I wish I had said something when I was there, but my friend didn't want me to make a big deal about it. I left with a bad taste in my mouth after that.", "author": "Sophie P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-23", "description": "Well I've been here twice now and I continue to be impressed. \n\nMy roommate and I started out the day very late - at about 12:30 we decided we were hungry and wanted pancakes. So we started our brunch search. When she suggested Mama's because of all the great reviews I immediately said 'no-way! the line will be out of control!' And it was -- but since it was a lovely day, we waited. And waited. And waited. Over one hour and it was worth it as always.\n\nThey definitely manage the crowd very well - and despite the always huge amount of people, they don't hurry you along.\n\nI love the counter-service ordering, but also that they bring the food to the table. Waiting in line and watching the chefs do their magic is part of the fun and anticipation, I think -- and since all of the ingredients are spread on a bed of ice in charming ceramic bowls (behind a large sheet of sneeze-proof glass, of course), it's clear that the food is very fresh. Always a good thing.\n\nWell as it turns out, pancakes we did not get -- An hour in line is a lot of time to think and rethink an order.  But, in keeping with the decadent and lazy Saturday, Cat and I ordered a piece of chocolate drizzled crumb cake as an appetizer, and then split Eggs Florentine and Apple Pan Dore. The Eggs Florentine had excellent flavor and after I finished I wanted more - although the yolk could have been a bit runnier - the egg was soft boiled rather than poached. The Apple Pan Dore was made with sourdough bread sliced so thin and garnished with the most amazing lemon butter that it could be cut with only a fork.\n\nThe line is, yes, obnoxious - you have to be die-hard to go here - either get up super early and arrive at 8am or be prepared to wait an hour. Either way, it's worth the wait.\n\nIf I had three thumbs, they'd all be up - as it is, my two are pointed skyward.", "author": "Juls P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-06", "description": "Mama's is great little place with awesome food and perfectly poached eggs.  Man, I love poached eggs.  \n\nAlthough it was noon, we had breakfast.  After lots of indecision, I got their Ranchero (Mama's version of huevos rancheros), and FRESH SQUEEZED grapefruit juice.  Jesus Christ, that juice was such a treat.  The boyfriend had their Market Omelette with bacon, spinach and chevre.  He said it was good, but a little rich, so he packed some up for later.  I am vegetarian, so I loved all the choices I had to choose from (not so at all places, even in our fair city, read my reviw of O'Rielley's if you don't believe me), and since brunch is my favorite meal to dine out for, I was seriously in Heaven.  Another plus: my Ranchero came with potatoes (most places don't serve potatoes with theier huevos rancheros, so I always have to order a side of them since I passionately love carbohydrates).\n\nGo to Mama's during the week and skip the crowds.  There may be a short to medium line, but don't let that fool you.  The way they have it set up, by the time your ass hits a seat your food is pretty much ready, so you stand and wait instead of sit and wait.  Standing burns more calories anyway, so you're good.  And another nice thing about pre-paying is when you're ready to go, you go, no need to flag down the waitress and wait for change or anything.  Also, as a note, in this kind of place, cash is king, they don't take credit cards (but I think debit is kosher), and besides, a cash tip on the table is a really nice way to say \"thanks\" to the girls who work that crazy busy little spot.\n\nOverall:  Food off the line is damn tasty, their juice is fresh squeezed, and the pasries by the register are old-school homebaked and look marvelous.  Service is efficient and we never had to ask for water or coffee refills.  I was curious, however, how it would have worked if we wanted another mimosa or glass of juice.  I guess I'll just have to cross that bridge when I get to it.\n\nIf the line outside doesn't scare you, but intrigues you as to why people are lining up, there is a good reason, and you should check it out.", "author": "Amanda B."}

The wait is long and draining, but it is well worth it! \n\nI've tried several different items at this popular breakfast place including:\n\nOmelettes: Washington square (italian sausage, peppers, cheese and tomatoes) and Mama's Children's Favourite (tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers, cheese). Both of these omelettes are amazing. They are piled with fillings that are chunky so you have the satisfying bite to your omelette. They are also huge and take up half the plate alongside crispy homefries and your choice of wheat, white, rye or sourdough toast. If you are opting for something savory, definitely go for the omelette and you will be satisfied for hours as the portions are big enough for both breakfast and lunch.\n\nPancakes: hot, fluffy, perfect and so satisfying! The creamy soft texture with the perfect blend of savory and sweet paired with a warm maple syrup topped with icing sugar is perfect for pancake lovers. The best pancakes I've tasted.\n\nFrench Toast: Kugelhumph french toast with dates, cinammon and nuts is the perfect wake up medley of sweet syrup and crunchy creamy brioche bread.\n\nCorned Beef Hash: (a special and not always offered everyday) The best in the city! the perfect mix of two over easy eggs, fresh shredded semi-lean corned beef and crispy bite size potatoes. Hit it with some ketchup and tobasco sauce along with an oozing yolk and you've got a plate of caloric goodness that is worth every bite. \n\nNOW, the sourdough toast is an essential selection in all of the bread options that come with your meal. The crispy yet warm buttery bread paired with the excellent olallieberry jam that is readily available on all tables is one of the main reasons I go to Mama's. Their jam is amazingly the perfect combination of sweet and tart with chunks of olallieberries drowning inside a syrupy concoction. I was tempted to swipe that container of jam into my purse as it is homemade and not available for purchase. \n\nThe baked instore items such as the lemon berry muffin and banana bread is served warm when you order in the store. They also have carrot cake, blueberry crumble cake, apple crumble cake, and other varieties. \n\nTheir coffee is always hot and refilled constantly with the friendly yet efficient service. It is always a mouthwatering 10 minutes when you stand in line observing  the cooks casually cook up a storm behind the glass of baked treats while you decide on your order. \n\nSo go early, bring a jacket and stand in line to wait for a perfect breakfast in San Francisco!", "author": "Florence T."}

Be careful, don't go in before this, even if the door is open and you see open tables because they're going to just kick you right back out and tell you that you can only come in when you are told to.

I had woken up uncharacteristically early one morning at 6:30a, strategically woke my bf up for some morning \"fun\", and we decided to walk to Mama's for breakfast afterwards.  By the time we got there at 8:00a, the line was really long!  It took us 1.5 hours to get through the line out front and to get through the line inside.  I had the french toast and my bf had the Washington square and we both LOVED our food.  I also took my roommate here one morning on a weekday around 10a, there was a line of four people outside so we didn't have to wait too long and we ordered the same thing above and loved it.\n\nSo fast forward 3 years...  I had never been able to go back to Mama's because it's just so hard to get up that early and I don't have weekdays off anymore.  But my bf's biggest regret was not getting the crab egg benedict special the first time around, so we made it a point to set our alarm today to wake up in time for Mama's.  We got to Mama's around 7:30 and found several parking spots open right in front! Score! We also saw a line about 20 or so people deep.  No score...  Still, we knew we would get in for the first seating, so we waited in line.  My bf ordered the crab egg benedict and I  ordered the Monte Cristo.  Bf said his egg benedict was okay.  The crab tasted like they had cooked and shelled it the day before and there was something off about it.  I liked the Monte Cristo, but it's not something I would order again.  I thought the OJ tasted diluted.  I would come back here if I got a weekday off and the wait wasn't too long, but I would NOT wake up at 6:30a on a weekend again to come back.\n\nService has always been great and it is cash only.

All in all I would probably wait in that line again to enjoy the food there over and over again even if the sun was out.

The food is akin to the cheapest diner mush you've ever tasted, AND posted in minuscule font on a faded white-board lets you know the crucial fact that they only accept cash for payment - and at $18.50 a plate, that's ridiculous.  \nI waited in line for 90 minutes: no place to sit, standing on a concrete sidewalk with a 30 degree pitch, aching feet and bored out of my mind (not much commerce in the area) only to be served a very lackluster spinach Florentine scramble:  a ton of salt couldn't provoke any flavor from the spinach, with undercooked bacon slices, and potatoes that had no taste with depressing, lard-smeared toast.   It was disgusting!\nThe dimwitted staff is excruciatingly slow and there are only 12 tables in the place!  When you get to the door, you may think you are close to eating but no..... you still have another 20-30 minutes inside waiting on line to order!  No menu, you must crane around all the heads and bodies to read what they serve.  \nI saw NO handicap access to this place.  If you are diabetic - forget it!  If you are hypoglycemic, like myself, this experience is close to a death wish.  \nWhile in line, you will get your picture taken by a dozen tourists, all fascinated with the line of (poor saps?) eager to eat at this greasy spoon.  Maybe you will be lucky, like me and get to listen to a gaggle of girls behind us squeal with inane shrieks as they loudly discussed - in my ear - their social 'lives'.  \nIt was pure hell.  And I put that lightly.\nFor those that crave to 'be someone' as they wait in line at a snobby club, for the moment the doorman permits you entry, only to be overcharged for weak drinks and wonder when the fun is going to happen, then go ahead and waste your time in beautiful San Francisco waiting in line to eat here.

Still other people tell me they have waited over an hour to eat here. \nOk - so I was convinced I had to try this place. My friend and I stumbled upon this place after I aimlessly walked through Chinatown and into North Beach. It was a Tuesday morning, and there was no line, so we decided to give it a shot.\n\nWe got the monte cristo, brioche french toast, and the cinnamon sour cream cake. Was it all delicious? Yes. Was it the best brunch ever? Probably not. Would I cross the bay bridge just to bring a few slices of coffee cake back with me? Never...\n\nLets put this all back into perspective. I think Mama's IS REALLY good, but I think I overhyped myself because of the 1000+ reviews on yelp. \n\nOur food was all VERY well-prepared, but what really did it for me was the homemade jam! The omelettes also looked good, and it seemed like that what a lot of other people got. \n\nI would come here again as long as I didn't have to wait over 20-30 minutes. I don't think it'd be worth a 1 hr. + wait. I would say the morning breads and pastries are probably not all that worth it either. Our small sour cream cinnamon cake was $3.95.

We hiked over to Mama's after getting many local recommendations as well as the many positive Yelps.   Yes, the locale is nice near the park.  Yes the restaurant is small and only seats maybe 25-30. Yes, there can be a long wait as the line is queued outside the main door and inside as well to place your order.  Yes, this is their way of ensuring the seated diners are not crowded and waiters can actually deliver the food.  During each visit we had a combo of dishes ranging from the French Toast Sampler to the Dungeness Crab Sandwich.  Yes, the food is very good.  Yes, the breads are awesome.  Yes, the photos posted are accurate.  Yes, they do not take credit cards - cash or debit with a surcharge.  Yes, we were lucky as we managed to eat here twice - but only by arriving very early, well before opening.  Yes,  Mama's is a nice family owned / run business which has excellent staff with a great memory for people.  Yes, our waiter remembered us from earlier in the week. Yes, I would I wait in line to eat a Mama's - I did.  Would I arrive during peak times and wait two+ hours?  ... Probably not, as my time in the city is limited.

Line wasn't too bad -- it moved rather quickly (you order and pay before sitting down, so it's like a literal squat and gobble -- not really a place to linger).  The line was my biggest concern, so all's good on that front.  \n\nSo, while waiting, I was debating between the croque monsieur and the farmer's omelette.  I opted for the omelette, which turned out to be a huge disappointment.  The omelette was rubbery and the flavors were disappointing.  My friends scored the french toast, which, although a somewhat smaller portion than a hearty girl such as myself typically goes for, looked quite tempting.  Having said that, however, I will confess that I am INFAMOUS for having serious plate envy.  I'm not proud of it, but there you have it.  \n\nSo, all that to say, I was not at all impressed with the omelette, and the potatoes were so-so (a little seasoning wouldn't have hurt), but the jam was divine.  I think it was just a case of bad ordering.  Next time I go back I'm trying the french toast AND the croque monsieur, dammit.  Then I'll reassess.", "author": "Samantha R."}

We got here early afternoon, around 12 or 1, and there was a line outside of about 10 people or so.  We waited in line for probably 25-30 minutes before getting to the counter, but it wasn't all bad since they had the menu put up on the window so you can decide what you want while you wait.  Once you get up to the front of the line at the cash register, you order, pay and then they seat you.  Beware, while you're in line inside the restaurant, you'll be tempted by the breads and pastries they have on display.  I couldn't resist getting a piece of coffee cake with chocolate drizzled over the top.  Very good!  It's a somewhat small place, so seating is kind of limited, but our party of 8 managed to get 2 tables next to each other.  \n\nThey have a good menu of breakfast items (a lot of eggs/ omelets, French toast and pancakes) plus a variety of sandwiches and salads that are served between 11 and 3 (they close at 3pm).  I couldn't decide whether to get the Washington Square omelet (Italian sausage, tomatoes, bell peppers and jack cheese) or the French toast sampler (one of the specials, which included three different types of French toast with some fruit topping).  One of my friends was having the same dilemma, so we decided to get both and split them.  Genius idea, huh?  Both the French toast and the omelet were great!  Mama's makes a homemade berry jam that tastes fantastic on the French toast!  The omelet, very good too.  The Italian sausage in the omelet was awesome and I couldn't get enough.  I don't know what it was, maybe the spices, but it was really great.  A couple of my friends ordered the crab omelet and the crab eggs benedict, both of which were fantastic too.  One of the others also had the burger on a sourdough baguette, which I didn't try but which looked really good.  \n\nThe service was good, no issues, and the prices were reasonable ($5-$10 for most dishes).

So we waited in line - and true to form - it was half an hour and suffered not moving up in line but by maybe a couple of spaces when one of us considered leaving.  But we were determined because, as we saw it, we were already invested in this by half an hours' worth of our time - and dammit - we didn't want to be the suckers leaving the line after we had already been here that long.  But that was where we went wrong...\n\nAfter an hour waiting in line, we finally got to go inside.  First of all, bring cash because that's all they take here.  We ordered within 10 minutes - at the counter.  Because here, they take your order at the counter and then you sit down and they bring you your order.  What wasn't cool was that there were 3 of us  and they had a bunch of tables open for only 2 people each.  So, literally, we stopped the line - for half an hour, waiting for a 3+ table to open up.  They stopped taking orders, they didn't look for any other 2 person parties, they didn't bother to try to squeeze in 3 people at the 2 person tables (which I kinda was hoping they wouldn't do anyway, but for the sake of efficiency at other restaurants I've seen this done to get the lines moving).  Nor were there any prompts to get one of the larger parties to leave, even though they had already finished their food, had their plates cleared, and continued to talk and take out their mapquest maps even while clearly people were waiting to sit down and eat.  I've seen restaurants, like in New York, rush people out all the time.  Maybe even a semi-apologetic but firm, hey guys, don't want to rush you but there is a wait so could you move this along, please...? would have been great.  But none of that happened, instead the entire crowd waited painfully while we waited for our table.  Maybe the sadistic part of me was a little grateful for that but in no way do I think that was even necessary.  The staff also did nothing to make us feel better or more comfortable just a semi-apologetic excuse from the cashier as we waited.\n\nThen finally a table opened up, we sat down.  I asked the waitress when our order was going to arrive and she told us our order was just put in.  She explained that orders are put in after we're seated.  I think my jaw hit the ground.  I asked how long that was going to take as we had a half hour left on our meter.  She said - oh well, you should go put more money in your meter, and left.\n\nWhen the food arrived, it was good.  I ordered the eggs florentine with green onions, which was good.  The home fries were okay.  We tried not to let the last hour and a half destroy our spirits.  We really, really tried.  In the end, though, we wound up measuring the food to the wait - and given that it was part of our overall experience, I think it's fair to make adjustments to this review as far as how the food fared against such a wait.  No food deserves an almost two hour or more wait.   And given that the staff did nothing for us in the painful half hour, like offer us a little appetizer, give us a little certificate for another dining experience here, stand up for all the customers waiting by trying to get the diners who were finished to move along, or offer a sincere apology (and I mean that by having exhausting other alternatives on their end) - I really have little incentive to come and try out their food, again.  Yeah, I get they are a mom and pop store - and maybe they don't have the means to be throwing out gift certificates every time there's a little fuck up like they do at Starbuck's.  But we're also not in the dark ages where we can't appreciate a little more time and effort put into customer service.  \n\nTwo stars.", "author": "Lorraine D."}

But then again, anything is going to taste fantastic after waiting in line for over 2 hours. Believe it or not (and I shouldn't give this away) but there is an IHOP 4 blocks down the hill and their french toast is as good, if not better than Mama's) I believe that Mama's has turned one stretch of our neighborhood into a horrible tourist/transplant infested mess. Out of towners smoking and talking loudly while staring through the window at the people inside Mama's eating their overpriced crab benedict. Are these the same people who camp out in front of KMART or Best Buy all night after Christmas to save $20 on a DVD player? I laugh everytime I walk past these poor souls in line as I head over to Original Joe's.

I couldn't wait to try the breakfast at this cute little place after reading so many great reviews.  Lucky for my friend and I being that it was a Thursday, the line wasn't bad.   So embarrassingly funny though...while we waited, I was peering through the window to see what everyone else was ordering for ideas and eyeing the yummy dishes they were throwing out from the kitchen.  This one guy was forking a good dose of the french toast into his mouth when he caught me drooling.  hahaha  Sorry dude, it's a bad habit I have..watching people eat!  \n\nSo, you can imagine how starving we were when it was time for us to order.  Btwn 2 girls...we ordered the Monte cristo, eggs benedict and a trio of their most popular french toast served with fresh fruit on top - the kugelpuph, cinnamon, and the banana nut.  The tables next to us and people in line were starring at our food - I think they were either amused or amazed at how much food we had ordered considering each dish alone would have fed 2 slightly hungry people.  Okay, so I had the Monte cristo with potatoes.  Gawd...definitely hit the spot.  With all the other options on the menu and being that I'm a huge fan of breakfast foods...I had a winner!  My friends eggs benedict was just okay.  I took one bite and it was a bit too rich for me.  She tried the Monte cristo and agreed it was the bomb!  Okay, onto the trio of french toast.  I could only have a small bite of each but they were all good.

Once we were invited inside, we were placed in another line that goes past the kitchen headed toward a cash register where we were told to order and pay for our meal (cash or debit, no credit cards) and wait for a table to open up. One opened up and we were directed to seat ourselves. The drinks we ordered were unceremoniously dropped off at our table. We asked for a bowl of fruit to tide us over until breakfast arrived (there is one cook with some helpers preparing food for about 20 tables, so the wait at the table was lengthy).  A bowl of fruit was brought -- along with a bill that was expected to be paid upon receipt, before our main meal was brought. This was a real put-off.  When our food did arrive, it was luke warm. At this point  - now an hour and twenty minutes into the ordeal - we did not have the patience to send it back.  I had Florentine Benedict and my husband had the Crab Benedict. Both were pretty much unacceptable. The Hollandaise sauce tasted like yellow-colored paste - not a even a hint of tangy lemon or and echo of rich butter to be found anywhere on the plate. Honestly, I am an average home cook and I can create a better Hollandaise from scratch at home. I was inclined to scribble down my recipe on a napkin and hand it to the cook. \nTruly, I felt embarrassed for them for what was supposed to be \"the best breakfast in town.\" The poached eggs were overcooked so that the yolks were not runny, but chalky-cooked. And don't forget, only luke warm. The fried potatoes that came with the meals were dark brown, almost burnt, and dripping in whatever grease they were cooked in. They didn't even taste like potatoes and were not seasoned in any discernable way.  We also ordered sides of Italian sausage (hey, it's North Beach!) and we were greeted with a greasy and again overcooked mess on a plate. And throughout the entire time we were seated, our small water glasses were refilled once.  It's like they couldn't get your cash and get your out of there fast enough. At the end of the meal, we decided to leave a very small tip  (less than 5 percent) on the table for the limited and less than stellar service we received. It was memorable, but not in the way restaurants want to be remembered. We also made a family pact never to waste our precious San Francisco vacation time at Mama's again.", "author": "S. M."}

The coffee was tasty, as was the orange juice.  The servers (if you can call them servers: although they bring you your food, you order at the counter before you sit down) are pleasant, and the food came quickly after ordering.  \n\nOverall, Mama's is a nice experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-01-06", "description": "There are so many reasons I think Mamas is THE BEST breakfast in the city. As a brunch hobbyist, I'm very impressed that EVERYTHING is homemade. I mean, the baker makes cakes and breads right in front of you. If you're a local and go often enough, you may be offered 1 of their fine coffee cakes on the house, because you ARE special to them & they appreciate your willingness to eat in the same small space as the hoards of tourists who listen to their hotel people. Being a creature of habit, I LOVE the crab benedict (or shrimp, if I go too late and they run out of it), momlettes, chocolate cinnamon french toast with berries (CRAZY good), and the egg white scramble w/ mushrooms and green onions (but be sure to ask for butter on your toast with this dish, if that's your preference...they'll keep it off, thinking you are concerned about your health, or something...very considerate). Bacon and fresh OJ goes with everything...highly recommended.\n\nBRING LOTS OF CASH...they don't take credit and feature above-avg. prices.\n\nNow, to address what many find to be a frustration...the incredibly LONG lines on Sat/Sun. They open at 8...arrive at 7:45 with a cup of coffee, newspaper, and comfortable shoes...lean against the wall for up to 30 min. The most important tip: arrive with only ONE dining companion (parties of 4 or more make it difficult for everyone to be seated...honestly, I saw a party of 15 once and that will discombobulate the restaurant for hours, so please dine here responsibly). That simple. Alternatively, go during the week, when there are no lines to speak of...I mean, if you're going to take a mental-health day, this is not a bad place to get back on the road to recovery.", "author": "Julia C."}

Come to Mama's and find out!\n\nAs a devout foodie, this is my mecca.  At least once a year, I make the journey for Mama's fluffy cloud-like pancakes, their unique delicious Italian-inspired omelettes, and their heavenly Monte Cristo sandwich (its a ham, turkey, swiss sandwich dipped in egg batter, pan-fried, and served with jelly/jam).  You might be wondering, does this guy eat all of this?  The answer is yes, the first time I visited, I ordered everything I just listed above.  After a 45-60 minute wait in line (which is the average wait time for weekends) and seeing all the wonderful entrees, I couldn't help myself.  Additionally, they have some of the best seafood breakfast specials around.  From fresh crab egg benedicts, to shrimp omelettes, to specialty french toast sets, I feel like I died and gone to breakfast/brunch heaven every time I get to this place.  This place still maintains its hidden gem charm (homey, down-to-earth, and outstanding service), but just with a lot of people.\n\nAlthough I have tried many places before I came to Mama's and even more afterwards, its places like this that make me keep exploring what's out there.  Thank you Mama's for the wonderful job you do!\n\n*Tips (everything on the menu is very good, so here are just non-food tips):\n- Weekdays are far less busy.  If you got the time, swing on in, grab a paper, and enjoy.\n- The wait can be long on weekends.  The place is small too, so large parties usually have to sit apart.\n- Cash only, be prepared.\n- If you can't find parking near Washington Square, head east on Filbert Street (towards Mason Street), there usually is parking around there.

Never been to northbay so cannot say the whole bay area. Dottie's take second place next to Mama's. I love the Washington omelette, Mama's sampler frenchtoast and the blueberry muffins (still warm, really moist and most importantly not too sweet.) I normally do not order the eggs benedicts because Los Gatos Cafe has the best eggs benedicts. Remember to come in a small group that way you get to order more and sample more.

Highlight of waiting in line was a guy on a scooter came by and told us that he was a local and that we shouldn't be waiting in line and go to Mo's for breakfast, which he said was way superior. No one budged from there spot. =) Total was 48 pre-tip. We had the following:\n1) Crab Benedict: Good, but benedicts were never my style, and there was crab shells in the mix.\n2) Shrimp Asparagus Omelet: I loved this one. Perfect combination. \n3) Chocolate French Toast: Bread was not fluffy, a bit dense. Do not eat with syrup, eat it with the jam that is what makes it taste so good.\n4) Blueberry Sour Cream Coffee: Liked it, but not a must order.\n5) Tea: Totally should have skipped it, it was just Tazo tea bags.\nOverall a good breakfast place and would come here again if there wasn't a line outside.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-10-02", "description": "Over the years I've noticed an evolution in what once might have been called \"dive\" restaurants.  While originally these places were low-cost restaurants with great food but simple surroundings many have evolved to become Yuppie traps: run down or out of date buildings with so-so food and high prices that people with too much money feel it's cool to visit.  It is great marketing, but not a great dining experience.  Mama's is just such a place.\n\nBy now it has cult status and the lines and dumpy surroundings (as others note in Yelp) are a part of the experience- again, great marketing (!) if people will put up with it.  Now why they put up with it is another story.  You get average food (some of it very good, but most average), so-so service (usually rushed because of the line) and, to top it all off they only accept cash despite having fairly high prices.  In today's world high prices but no credit cards is really not quaint, it's just bad customer service.\n\nIf you can go on a weekday and avoid the line maybe give it a shot- they occasionally have some creative food options. But when all is said and done you could save an hour of time and just go to Moose's across the street. Much better service, not rushed, good food, and the prices are not that different.", "author": "William H."}

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the wait was definitely not worth it, since my breakfast, which was actually a late lunch by then, was just average.  I had the Northern Italian omelette, consisting of pancetta, mushrooms, basil, tomato, garlic, and cheese.  There was nothing special about this omlette.  In fact, it was quite bland for having basil, garlic, and pancetta as its ingredients.  The home fries and coffee were average.  My friend had eggs benedict with avocado and she only ate half of it because there was some sort of metallic taste to it.  However, she did enjoy the banana cake, and I had a taste of the chocolate crumb cake and that was good.  Perhaps the baked goods are something to rave about.  There are so many breakfast/brunch joints in this city that are well worth a 2 hour wait, but Mama's just isn't one of them to me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-23", "description": "OK. I'm the type of dude that schedules my errands specifically to avoid lines, traffic, waiting, or pointless standing. You'll never find me in that line of cars always found outside TJ's, though I shop there weekly. I, also, love breakfast. I went to Mama's today as the host for my out of town friend, for our very first visit. Now, it is 100% feasible that the food is worth the wait, if you have found yourself waiting very long, for almost all of the people who have ever visited. Though, it would have to be a pretty clean entrance-to-exit experience, because that friggin' wait puts the rest of the factors on a tight-rope. Any slip-ups, and the wait won't be worth it. Especially with the food. Our wait was one (1) hour. Everybody was super polite and efficient. I ordered the french-toast sampler and a side of chicken-turkey sausage, she ordered the shrimp benedict special and added crab meat, tomatoes and avocado. We both also ordered small juices. Our bill was $40.04. Ahem. After we were seated, a couple was seated to our right, and then to our left. Both parties received their plates before we did. Ahem, again. Getting wobbly. The sampler arrived with the three headlining FT; cinnamon, something else I can't remember, and the cranberry-orange. I ate the cinnamon and unknown first, one by one, to savor the flavors. Each could be topped by my own unexperienced hand in less than ten minutes in my little kitchen. More gummy than fluffy, and nothing special, even with the wonderful fruit topping. The cranberry-orange, was super-delish and they get major points for that. However, it was sort of cheating cuz it really wasn't bread made into FT by fancy and skilled techniques, it was cake, cooked as FT, so not that impressive in the end. You should try my carrot cake FT.... right? Shrug of my shoulders. Coffee was edible, though I'm a snob. Juice was good. No biggies. My company received her dish, a familiar to her seafood benedict which is her usual out-on-town breakfast order, and I couldn't help but notice her grimly poking at it and tasting-testing the food. She was not feeling safe. I tasted it, it was putrid. PUTRID. There is no way to ever find out if it was the recipe (I doubt it) or if it was the freshness of ingredients (I would be apalled). She very politely explained our taste testing results and the gentleman very politely removed the dish immediately. Not feeling frisky anymore, she asked for the safe bet from my plate - the cran-oj FT. \"Pretty-good\", she reports, and, \"fairly decent\". She is not a snob. She would have liked butter. The waitress was very polite and brought over a five dollar bill - the difference between her first dish and replacement dish. Ahem. Better than a kick in the shin, right. But, I don't know, a tricky fish-in-benedict meal that tasted foul.... might be a comp. Am I wrong? She did report a loss of appetite and a queasiness. We waited for an hour, and after that long of a wait, I would have been more comfortable with prices a tick towards reasonable, being served before others sat after my party, safe food, and maybe a fuller gesture towards restitution considering the possibility of foul food.  If there isn't a line - I recommend going at your convenience.", "author": "Travis L."}

(We arrived as the last of a small rush. Everyone ahead of us was seated immediately.)\nThe food was very good and the desserts/pastries were excellent. The only negative was that I when I asked to have my carrot cake microwaved for a few seconds, the cashier (owner??) looked at me like this was the most difficult thing that she had ever heard of and that she couldn't do it because the icing would melt. I wasn't even close to the mood to argue about it so I let it go. (I guess that if you own a really popular restaurant you don't have to worry about customer service.

Mama's serves the warmest, tastiest, and most comforting breakfast food. \n\nMy friends and I arrived a little earlier than 8:00am and there already was a line. No big deal though because we were expecting it.

The four of us ended up getting a LOT of food: the Northern Italian M'omelette, 2 French Toast samplers, the Chocolate French Toast, the Monte Cristo, and the Silver Dollar Pancakes. We didn't think it was too much until our register guy commented, \"Wow you all must be hungry because that's a LOT of food.\" I guess we were all just super excited. My favorites were the Monte Cristo, and the Cinnamon french toast and Banana Nut french toast from the Sampler. The Monte Cristo was *cue angels' orchestra music* amaaazing. It was perfect--cheesy, savory, and the jam added a kick of sweetness. The homemade jam was really really good. The French Toast sampler was good to try out some of their different flavors, but I ended up only really liking two. But all of them were soft, but chewy enough, moist, sweet, and delectable. YUM.

Over Memorial Day weekend we (me, wife, daughter [age 8]) went to Mama's on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nYou've read it a million times - believe it! There will be a line. Both days we got there at 7:45 (it opens at 8) and were at least 15-20 people deep in the line. At 8 the door opens about the first 10-12 people are let in the door, where you immediately wait in line again because you order at the counter. As the counter line decreases they let more people in from outside. Of course, if after ordering at the counter there are no tables then you will wait again. Yes, that's right, three lines.\n\nThe crowd is a nice mix of locals and tourists (given how much SFO gouges tourists for the hotel tax the tourists ought to get a priority line), young and old, families and singles, couples and friends. Other than a few hungry kids there was virtually no grumbling about the line. We expected it so we didn't mind.\n\nThere is not convenient street parking right in front of the restaurant - this is freaking North Beach. Good luck finding parking. We enjoyed our walk from our hotel (Fairmont on Nob Hill). The smart move is to drop someone off to reserve a place in line while you go find a place to park.\n\nThis place does not take credit cards or (I think) checks. You've been warned - bring cash!\n\nThis place is not cheap, so bring lots of cash. We paid $50 including tip each time (and one of us is only 8 years old). The only reason this place doesn't rate five stars is because the value wasn't there for me.\n\nPlenty has been said about the food so I really don't have anything to add. Suffice to say that we thought it was so good we ate there on back-to-back mornings. What often isn't discussed is the service - it was fantastic. Every server was friendly and efficient. Our waiter from the first day (I wish I knew his name - fantastic service!) recognized us and gave us a very cheery greeting. He remembered that my wife ordered ice tea the previous day so when we were seated there was already an ice tea waiting for her. I just said it but I want to repeat it - the service was outstanding. If I didn't live so far away I would definitely become a regular.\n\nFor those who like Mama's you might want to try San Diego's version. It is Kono's - located at the base of Crystal Pier in PB. It is my favorite place to eat breakfast and has many things in common with Mama's: 1) Only open for breakfast and lunch; 2) Cash only; 3) Order at the counter and food is brought to your table; 4) Restaurant isn't very large, but it is bigger than Mama's; 5) Not a huge menu; prefers to focus on doing a smaller number of things very well; 6) Lines, lines, lines!!!!!\n\nJust go to Mama's and see for yourself - you will want to come back again.", "author": "David J."}

I'd been hearing great things about Mamas for, like, ever. many, many mornings I had walked by the long line of people eagerly awaiting a meal inside. Finally, I decided that it was time to give it a shot. I woke up early and made it to mamas slightly after they opened (they open at 8). My wait in line was brief, but longer than I expected it to be at 8:10 am.\nonce inside, I got to wait in another line to order. after ordering and paying the woman at the register told us to \"wait right here\" to be seated. all the tables were full and we had to wait for someone to leave. (which was awkward because there is no room inside for standing around). we finally got to sit at a table and were served our drink orders. the lattes were decent. Not great, but not bad.

They give you cinnamon, banana-blueberry and banana-walnut French toast topped with fresh fruit & a side of maple syrup. Try putting their homemade raspberry preserves on the french toast - delicious!

We went on a Sunday morning at around 9 and had to wait an hour in line to get in.  It was fun, we ended up talking to people around us and the time went quickly. You order at a counter and then you get seated. I took the recommendation of others on Yelp and ordered the French Toast Sampler. My wife got the Salmon Benedict. The servers are great, they keep your coffee cup filled and a smile on your face while you are waiting. Mine recommended putting the homemade berry jam on the french toast that was already smothered in fresh fruit (mostly strawberries and bannanas). What a great recommendation. The sampler was to die for, especially the cranberry orange piece. Equally good or possibly better ( I can't believe I'm saying that the french toast is so good) was the Salmon Benedict. I just wrote in another review that I don't normally like salmon, I think I'm gonna have to rethink that position. Anyway the food was really good. The line is ridiculous.

I woke up at 6:30 in the AM to get to the restaurant before it even opened. I never wake up this early, not even for school so you can see how determined I was to eat at this restaurant. We got there at exactly 8AM and there was a wait! It was a frickin' cold morning and I was extremely irritable from waking up so early and when you pair that with the cold weather, I was like RAWR! After half and hour, I finally got to order my chocolate cinnamon french toast while my friend ordered the Californian omelette. We were seated near the door which was unfortunate because whenever someone would leave or enter the restaurant, we would be the ones to feel the cold wind. When the food came I was in a grumpy mood, but with one taste of my french toast, I perked up. I love french toast. I love chocolate. The combination of the two almost killed me. I really liked it and when my friend asked to try some, I wanted to stab her with my knife. However, we decided that we would trade dishes. The omelette was tasty, but I loved my french toast. Apparently she liked it too because she asked our waitress for more chocolate sauce for the french toast. We even struck up a conversation with some french tourists who were seated next to us.

But, this is what you need to do if you want to eat at Mama's and survive the line.  There is a random focaccia place on the corner right across the street that serves delicious pizza bread. It opens and closes when it wants, so you can't always rely on that for the wait. So, I recommend you bring your own snack. Once you enter Mama's,  though, all the angst and promising that you will never ever stand in line again melt away, and all is forgiven when you eye the delicious breads and coffeecakes in the case. (Carrot Cake is a must try, but a bit pricey at $5 for a square). The line and table seating is quite efficient once you get in, so just hang in there. We always get the crab benedict and pancakes (sans fruit). The waitstaff is always super friendly and encourage you to try the jam on the pancakes. Personally, I like it with just the syrup, but try it for yourself.  Why the 3 stars?  On the last visit, the benedict was a bit disappointing (and the price seemed to have increased), so to wait that long for just pancakes makes it only 3 stars.", "author": "Mashi M."}

Everything was great and SOOO much better than the lame service and food at the expensive places like Absinthe.

The wait outside Mama's was less than 10 minutes; but once stepped inside, we had to wait in the line again before we can order our food.

Besides the Eggs Benedict with smoke salmon that I ordered, we also shared a slice of banana bread and 3 coffee cakes (vanilla, carrot & blueberry flavor).

Every restaurant is different for everybody, but hey the line is killer, my advice to people without unlimited patience (planet earth) Tuesday-Thursday, during non holiday times.  During the summer you can expect it to be busy every frickin day.  Plan ahead is a good idea too, going there on an empty stomach might make you a bit irrational by the time you get the front of the line.  \n        I find what mamas does the best is consistency, it consistently has put good food out there for many years.

We had a bit of a \"situation\" with a fellow diner wrongly assuming that he was next up for a table. After a quick he said she said between fellow diner and my friend and I we relented as I don't argue over brunch tables. The waitress noticed what happened and came over to us to say she was sorry and that that table was in fact ours. When we sat down I have to say the waitress, Sally, went out of her way to make up for the misunderstanding with a genuinely lovely demeanor as well as on the house mimosas and a crumb cake and cookie to take away. The owner, Debbie, even stopped by our table to apologize! As it was my friend's birthday, it wasn't a great start but Sally and Debbie turned it around and that's the real meaning of a small, independently owned business. As everyone has mentioned, they always have a line out the door but that didn't stop them from caring that two patrons had a bad experience and doing whatever they could to turn it around.\n\nIn addition - the food was fantastic. I had egg whites with spinach & mushrooms which was bursting with flavor and we also had the french toast sampler which was quite good, as everyone has said.", "author": "Barbara C."}

I have never been less than satisfied, and quite regularly I am ecstatic over what I consider to be the best omelets in the world. They're \"Momelets\"! You can expect to wait in line, and it is always crowded, so if that isn't your plan, you'd be happier elsewhere. They do great silver dollar pancakes too, but I'd suggest ordering an egg dish as well. Their eggs benedict is to die for. If you like crab, when in season they have a crab, leek and white cheddar cheese omelet that will give you premonitions of paradise. The service is fantastic, and the people there treat you like family (well, I suppose we are considering how long we've been frequenting the place). My only complaint is the coffee. Don't get me wrong, the coffee is drinkable - it's just not great (he never asks for a second cup at home). I honestly think it is brewed too strong.

Suffering from jet lag I woke up at 730am and ended up in line around 830am.  There were 2 parties ahead and it still took about 30 minutes.  But it was definitely the shortest line I have seen so far.  The bakery across the street had half of SF waiting to get in.  I think they were selling foccocia or something but their line was ridicuolous.  Anyways, mamas pretty much lives up the hype.  Crab is in season so all the specials have crabs.  The crab \"momlette\" was freaking amazing!  With fresh, whole meat dungeoness crab soaked in butter it was freaking awesome.  The OJ and the homemade jam was also really good.  I also had some of their french toast.  It was a little too sweet for me so i didnt use syrup.  I just dipped it into the jam (thats what fattys like me do).  It is definitely worth coming to mamas.

If you are fortunate enough to eat here on a weekday when it's not completely bonkers (like on a Thursday right before you get dental surgery) it may be unclear about how this place works.  First you wait in line outside the door, and then they let you in to wait in line by the counter.  As you wait by the counter, much of the breakfast menu (posted on the wall) will be blocked by hungry bodies, and you should actually be reading this menu and know what you want by the time you get to the register, because you order at the counter, which is a little bit of a pain when some dumbass won't get out of the way so you can see the menu.  After all of this complaining, I must say the eggs benedict was some of the best I've ever had, but i don't think I'd ever wait in line for 2 hours to eat it -- I was much happier waiting for only 25 minutes, all the while unclear about how the place worked.

I only go when I can slip in on weekdays but I don't love breakfast enough to wait in an hour long line.  I took my coworkers there yesterday because they were craving a good solid breakfast.  I had the eggs florentine with a side of spicy italian sausage and tomatoes.  I've had the omlettes in the past and they are delicious.  The pancakes with fresh berries are the real winner here and the baked goods.  A real treat.  Next time I'm going with the french toast.  Yumm..", "author": "Allison M."}

I don't go as often as  I would like to because of the wait.  Even during the weekday when I've taken a day off from work I've had to wait with all the tourist.  The most annoying thing is listening to the tourist say Joe Dimaggio and Marilyn Monroe where married at St. Peter and Paul - THEY WERE NOT MARRIED THERE!  The owners are really nice and once I forgot my wallet and the owner's husband said I could come back another day to pay.   The pancakes are so good there, and the omlettes are excellent.  My sister actually worked here when she was in college back in the early 70s.   They used to have several Mama's in the city, including one in the basement of Macy's.  Another trivia note is that when Micheal Douglas was filming Streets of San Franciso he used to date the owner's daughter.   Great place just wish they would bring back the hotdog sandwich they had in the 70s, and put up a sign that Joe and Marilyn wer NOT married at St. Peter and Paul (they were married at City Hall)", "author": "P S."}

So, while my friend was at work, I walked over all by myself and saw the line around the corner. I am a huge breakfast fan so decided to wait. In line, I met lots of people who were all friendly (everyone in SF is friendly) and told me it would be worth it. The nice girls waiting behind me asked me to join them (not sure if it was out of pity since I was by myself...but regardless, it was a nice gesture) so I accepted and we walked into the restaurant together as 3. Unlike the traditional restaurant, you walk along the counter where you see the cooks cooking and order at the register at the end of the counter, pay up, and wait, awkwardly, standing over people who are already sitting and eating, for a table. Soon after we were seated, our waitress took our orders and everything came pretty shortly after. The 'healthy' french toast was amazing - yogurt bread dipped in egg whites instead of the entire egg. It was delish and I couldn't help but notice that I had scarfed my food down way before the company I was with. How embarrassing. But it was so good!

Standing at the couter made me so hungry because you watch the food being prepared and everything looks so bright and fresh.

Luckily we could oogle at the food inside and occasionally smell the yumminess inside when the door opened and closed.\nAfter 45 mins of waiting outside we were let into the warmth to wait in the line inside. By this time we were starving and decided to be pigs and order 4 dishes for the 3 of us.\nThe cashier woman was a serious ding to this place. She was completely grumpy, didn't make eye contact, and made our long wait almost intolerable cuz it took twice as long to place our order since she wasn't paying attention to us and instead concentrating at how miserable she was.\nOn the flip side our table server was very nice and funny. We entirely enjoyed our omelettes and my eggs florentine along with our shared cinnamon and chocolate french toast.  Sinfully sweet and delicious.\nTheir hollandaise was citrusy and yummy without the too heavy feeling that some have. Their homefries were just average.  I wish I could have tried thier blueberry coffeecake but that would've have totally been too piggy.

I have been here over the weekends waiting in  line  to get that spot for my friends who conveniently showed up after church or laundry only to find a table and give me a \"Thank you\".

Yes, I have had that disappointment of finding them closed on a monday. Brunch is at its best and when you have that heavenly French toast, it is unparallel, no word in my vocabulary can match the quality of the French toast. Only minus, besides the long wait, is tables are really too close, so you might not feel very confortable, but trust me no one is listening to you perhaps not even your friends... they all are busy enjoying  brunch.

First off, we only waited in the inside line and it still took over 30 minutes to sit.  Come on, that's completely ridiculous.  Second of all, BLAND!!!  Ok, I'm exagerating slightly, but really, the food was just good, not great, not excellent.  For a place that regularly boasts what must be a 2-3 hour wait, I expected the food to blow my hair back.  I love breakfast and try to get to new places whenever I can.  It was also a bit on the pricey side for breakfast.  I was excited to be 1 block from this place and now I wouldn't set foot in there even if they didn't have a 2 hour line.  Skip this place and head to Ella's or Kate's Kitchen.

It sounds bizarre but it's very cool, trust me.  It was a tough decision but I ended up ordering the Banana Nut French toast and my wife had the special...Crab Eggs Benedict.
