Their menu is overwhelming with so many options from sushi, sashimi and combo plates. The place gets packed, so come early. I'd like to describe the service as organized chaos. You order, take the number and grab a table. They serve you quick. Tables are in close zones from each other too, so if you have a personal bubble, you may be uncomfortable. \n\nI ordered the katsu curry plate with a dragon roll (way too much food). My friend ordered some nigiri and my other friend ordered some tempura and cali rolls. The sushi rolls are basic American rolls and not the best nor freshest I've had. While Japanese chefs do add wasabi to their nigiri, it's very minimal whereas this place packed it on and my friend had to wipe it off. The curry with the katsu wasn't the best either, it was more carrots and veggies than sauce, though it was still edible and quite delicious. \n\nOverall, this place is a decent place to go to for cheap and quick Japanese food with great amount of portions. Don't expect top quality stuff here, though. I'd come again.", "author": "Jenna T."}

Which is why it's really annoying when Japanese-hunger-pangs hit me in the middle of the workday, and the closest place to my office is the Floating Sushi Boat place run by Chinese people in the middle of Chinatown.\n\nOne day my stomach decided that it wanted some hot noodle soup.  My first instinct was to go to Ramen Underground, but I was too lazy to stop by the ATM first, even though it was on the way.  So I looked up Tokyo Express, saw that you can order online (!) and immediately clicked my way through the website for some tempura udon, Alaska roll (salmon and avocado) and the Heaven roll (spicy tuna, basically).\n\nI placed my order through Seamless (if you're a first-time user, put in X949yT in the coupon box for $5 off!) and they said my order would be ready in about 30-35 minutes.  I headed to pick it up, and they asked for my ID, gave me my food, and sent me on my way.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't know how long my food had been ready prior to my arrival, and although they were in separate bags, the heat from my udon made my sushi lukewarm, so I had to stick it in the refrigerator for a bit before enjoying.  I sort of wish they'd put my sushi outside or something until I got there.  The udon was good too, and it came with a small salad.  Downside was the price - as with most Japanese places, it's pricey if you order more than your basic bento box.\n\nTotal fan of this place, especially when I'm really craving some good ol' sushi.

You go to the front and order, get your number placard, take a seat, and your food is brought to you.  While you wait, you help yourself t tea and water at your own leisure.  There might be a mad scramble to find a seat/table right after you pay, and this can be a bit daunting.\n\nI ordered the Chirashi, 'different fish over sushi rice bowl,' ($12.99), my sister ordered the Blossom Chirashi, 'tuna, salmon, avocado over sushi rice bowl,' ($12.99), and my colleague ordered the Vegetable Don ($5.99).  All of our orders came with miso soup and small salad.  \n\nOverall, the prices aren't too bad.  They aren't overly priced, and they can be cheap since you aren't paying for the service here.  They do offer an array of Japanese food, as well as sushi and rolls.  My chirashi bowl was filling.  I didn't count how many slices of fish, but there was a good amount that covered my rice.  The fish wasn't the highest quality, but it'll do for a fast workday lunch.\n\nAs other yelpers mentioned, this is an 'express,' so they are quick to clean up your table as you finish your soup bowl, salad bowl, etc.  At times, the way they start rearranging your plates to make room can be a bit overbearing.  But I guess they are aiming for efficiency and not politeness.\n\nFor vegetarians out there, they offer quite a selection of veggie options, from rolls to entrees.  And they are easily noted on the menu.  Because of their huge menu, they also have a bunch of handwritten specials written all over the place. Good luck trying to read it all before ordering.  \n\nOverall, I would return if I'm craving a decent Japanese lunch - from a bento box to sashimi, I would go back.  I wouldn't rely heavily on the sushi though, but I'll take their Japanese food, that's for sure.\n\nSide note:  If you aren't ready to order because you're still perusing their big ass menu selection, step to the side or let the people behind you know that they can go on right ahead.

So I am highly impressed and very pleasantly surprised when my chirashi sushi arrives with buttery slices of hamachi and salmon that melt in your mouth (the tuna slices were as expected, not so great). It's even topped with a shiso leaf, very authentic. \n\nThis place can be hit or miss, but for the most part, it's a hit  - I frequent it about once every two weeks, and I've only been disappointed with the fish quality once or twice.\n\nBut the reason I felt compelled to write this review - the other day I ordered their tamago chirashi (a bowl of sushi rice topped with various types of cholesterol-laden \"tamago\" (egg) - masago (flying fish roe), wasabi masago, ikura (salmon roe), slices of tamago and uni).

But I didn't get sick and it wasn't really bad either, so I can't give them just one star.\n\nSteps to improvement: better fish, smaller menu, don't precut the fish, and keep it cold until served, not luke-warm.

My friends ordered regular rolls to go and received them very quickly.  I ordered two deep fried rolls and a seaweed salad.  The staff asked me if I knew the rolls were deep fried and I said yes.  Then we had to wait a very very long time while other people were ordering and receiving their orders left and right.  I assumed the delay was because the deep frying took a long time and that was why they had asked.  However, when I finally received my order, both of the rolls were over fried.  It seems they had just forgotten them in the fryer and then packaged them up and given them to me anyway.  So the outside was slightly burnt and the fish was overdone, as if it were from Denny's. It was bad.  The seaweed salad was no worse than one gets at most Japanese places in town.  Do not get any fried items here!  Can't speak for the unfried rolls but why would I return when there are sushi shops on every corner?", "author": "Sonic H."}

And whenever our boss was in town from Seattle, we would order in from Tokyo Express and pick up the food in about 15 minutes. They are extremely effective, at the point of seeming brisk...but it works for the type of service and food they offer. Speaking of the food, the sushi is surprisingly good for a place that's right on the border between FiDi and Chinatown. No real complaints, really. So why the 3 stars? Well...it's all a bit too fast paced and too rushed. I mean, it's all ok if I'm ordering out, but when I sit down for a meal, I don't generally like to feel the wait and bus staff breathing down my neck. The other patrons are worse; they're like vultures waiting to jump on my not-yet-but-soon-to-be-vacated seat.", "author": "Philip W."}

I spent a long time trying to find a good sushi place near my office and I finally found it when a friend took me here for lunch one time. So. Good. A wide variety of sushi dishes that they make right quick and are delicious.\n\nBe warned: if you go between 12-1 this place is going to be packed to a level that boarders on the absurd. There are two registers you can order from so just hop in line, figure out what you want to have and they will crank you through there. I would reccomend one of the specials because this place is a tad overpriced (-1/2 star) and they are a good deal. Generally it's a big roll and a small roll and miso soup and a salad. Once you order they give you a number...if it's packed go and stand by the door and wait for them to seat you (this may not be explicitly apparent but it's what they expect you to do...I was pretty confused my first time). A waiter will rush by and get you seated somewhere pretty quick, but if it's just you (or just you and a friend) it's going to be at a table with another party (-1/2 star...I understand the need to get everyone seated but I'm just not a huge fan...this place should expand so all parties can have their own table!).\n\nI usually take a late lunch and go around 1:30...not as crowded then by half.

I have only had their sushi so I can't review any of the other food but I see a lot of people with Udon soup, bento boxes, and the teriyaki and donburi entrees. My favorite rolls are the spicy hamachi, spicy tuna, heaven roll, double punch, dragon roll, spicy CA roll, rock & roll, and the knock-out roll.
