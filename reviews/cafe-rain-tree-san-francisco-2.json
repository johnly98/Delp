Has all the traditional food fare for breakfast and brunch with a few extra twists. Definitely enjoyed the espresso milkshake; if you get the chance and like espresso and milkshakes I suggest you give it a try.\n\nThe service here was good too, the wait staff while only having one person on, made regular rounds to check on us and was pleasant, not overly cheerful but more than polite enough. They were happy to make a minor alteration to my French toast and add banana and the French toast itself was cooked properly crisp on the edges and soft in the middle. Also important to note, the price is more than reasonable for what you get.", "author": "Anthony S."}

I always judge breakfast joints by their basic eggs and hash browns and Rain Tree doesn't disappoint. Their corned beef hash is decent, as is their Irish breakfast (which you don't see on many menus these days).\n\nOne bonus is that it's rarely, if ever, crowded.

I thought the service was awesome and the food was pretty good.\n\nI ordered the #1 Rain Tree Special - Blueberry Pancakes ($10.75) and also ordered a glass of fresh squeeze orange juice. The plate included 2 pieces of sausage, 2 eggs, and 2 pancakes. The pancakes could have been more fluffy & would have been better with less air bubbles, but they did a good job with the sunny side up eggs. The orange juice was super refreshing and I'd recommend ordering one.\n\nWe also got the popeye omelette. Nothing spectacular about it, but they were accommodating and let us put extra ingredients on it.   \n\nThey take credit cards, but would prefer to take cash.", "author": "Victor L."}

I ordered an avocado for extra $1.95 or so. What I got was smears of oxidized (dark turned) avocado in my omelette. I had to search for signs of avocado. When I asked why so little avocado and why dark/oxidize, the waitress said all avocados are like that and I can pay again if I want more added.  What triggered this review is the attitude the waitress had. Not only the attitude, she along with the cook and a guest (family member?) all mumbled something in Spanish and laughed. It was obvious that they all laughed on my feedback on a bad avocado. I wanted to support a small business so I came here instead of my favorite place \"Crepevine\" just two doors away. It was a TOTAL waste of money and felt cheated. No tip!", "author": "Chance M."}

It's a comfortable size with booth and table seating. My friend and I grabbed a table in the back as it wasn't too busy. \n\nThe server quickly came to offer us coffee. We ordered pumpkin pancakes, which is a seasonal dish going on right now! And then we also ordered corned beef hash benedict. The pancakes were good, but there was nothing exceptional about it. The hash was also okay, but again, there's nothing that made it special. It came with a side of potatoes, which were not very good. I would go back if I was in the mood for another diner meal. \n\nBut the service there was great. Our server was always kind to check in on my friend and I.

Here's the scenario, bf and I been having brunch at Crepevine a lot lately...so we wanted to try something different. Just a few shops down is Rain Tree. Thought we'd give it a go. \n\nUpon entering RTC, it's just a typical small greasy spoon diner. No frills, but we're thinking maybe a good hole in the wall. They have the chef cooking at the open kitchen right behind the counter. Only a few tables were occupied and two people sat at the counter. The lady who seemed like the manager said we could sit anywhere. \n\nBrunch specials for $9.50.... sounded good. I chose the Portabella Benedict and bf chose the Bacon Avo Omelette. After we ordered, we decided to check out the reviews on yelp. Oh damn.... 2.5 stars. Too bad we didn't check beforehand. We were sitting there, hoping that we'd have a decent bfast. \n\nOne thing I noticed was that the manager and waitress were helping make the toast. However, both these ladies were touching money, menus and serving the dishes in between while handling the toast with their bare hands. I did not see either of these women wash their hands once. Violation health code right there. I understand that there's only one cook, so they're trying to help out but please do not touch my toast with the same hands you just used to handle money. Did you know that money is filthy and that fecal matter can be found on it? I read that in TIME magazine. Ick ick ick! \n\nWhen our food arrived, bf and I were like.....WTF. It looked like someone had just threw everyone on the plates. Not asking for high presentation points there but damn, I can make something more appetizing in my own kitchen. \n\nRight away, I noticed that the poached eggs on my benedict were still raw. The egg whites were clear! I told the waitress. She apologized, said they'd make me a new one and took it back to the chef. A few minutes later, she brings my food again. Guess what? I know for a fact that they just stuck it in the microwave and did not make a new one. The ketchup I had put on my potatoes was still there. Seriously? I was so turned off....then I tasted the holindaise sauce which was just disgusting. It tasted very lemony. The portabella mushroom was very chewy esp since they microwaved it and the english muffin was now mushy. The potatoes were all falling apart and bland. \n\nThe bacon avocado omelet was completely overcooked and burned. There was hardly any bacon or avo! We also found a moldy potato on bf's dish. The toast was bleh and we knew it was no good to begin with. \n\nAnother quote from bf about this meal - \"If I was on an deserted island and someone gave me this ish, I'd eat it.\" Horrible bfast! It wasn't cheap either...especially for a poor meal. Regret not having checked out the other yelp reviews before eating here. Always trust your fellow yelpers for good advice!", "author": "Liv A."}

I then mentioned the 2 table setting that was there and still there and that it was misleading. other restaurants I have gone to either place signs by the door to either wait to be seated or just seat yourself. this place have neither. and when we initially walked in nobody was immediately there to great us until several minutes after sitting down. so this last then said that unfortunately people don't pay attention to signs and would just sit anyways. \nnow, I have always been a hot-headed person and would now always think of my friend about my actions. I decided to calm down and just accepted what I was told. I also told this lady that at least they should place a 4table setting instead of 2 and she did that after i placed our order. \n    I don't know if I was white would this have happened to me?

My boyfriend and I live close and were coming from church super hungry so we went here just to try it. \n\nIt starts off with terrible service when the waitress neither greets or gives us any direction to being seated, so my boyfriend and I are standing there for an awkward eternity it seems before we are even acknowledged. Red flag #1. I later see that there's a small handwritten sign that says \"seat yourself where table is clean.\" We sat ourselves at the bar and notice a number of tables that were empty, but haven't been waited yet. Red flag #2. My boyfriend and I sit down to review the menu and when we've made our decisions, we put down our menu to get the waitress' attention. Nope. The entire restaurant itself is small, so the fact that she didn't notice us waiting for a solid 10min is beyond me (Red flag #3) But my boyfriend and I aren't exactly in a rush so we aren't angry or anything. She finally takes our order and I ask for the porkchop, sunny side up eggs, and salad to replace the side of potatoes. My boyfriend orders the vegetarian dish American omelette but requests to add turkey. After we place our order, we wait. My boyfriend and I are sitting right in front of the cook so we are able to observe how he cooks. Red flag #4? My boyfriend sees him taking my porkchop, completely frozen, and pops it into the microwave to defrost. Yeah... My expectations are already lowering. We see him making other people's food meanwhile, and amongst many things wrong, we notice a pretty burnt pancake going out, him wiping one of the plates (with food already on it) with a dirty towel, the waitress taking people's orders incorrectly and wasting food as it was sent back, and overall, no care when it comes to the food that is being plated. When our food came out, as expected my porkchop was 100% dry on top of being the flattest and tiniest portion ever. I took a few bites and literally spat it out (as undramatically as possible) because it was like eating salty rubber. The cook forgot to replace my potatoes with a salad and had to switch it out after being reminded of my order (which he did so by using his hands to push it off my plate and back into the pile of potatoes used for all plates). However, I did get to try those potatoes via my boyfriend's dish and needless to say, we didn't finish that either. There was like a hint of cayenne pepper that seasoned it very poorly. And it was cooked very mashed and dry. Given I'm a home cook myself, I was not impressed. My boyfriend's omelette was actually decent, but even he said there's no way you can mess up an omelette, and he doesn't cook... At all. I had earlier ordered waters when the waitress originally took my order, but never got it so I asked for waters when I luckily got her attention. She comes back with ONE water. SERIOUSLY? So I proceed to ask her for another for my boyfriend. Overall, we finally got our check and couldn't wait to leave.\n\nI honestly don't understand why people would open a restaurant and not strive to make it at least decent.

A good two slices of tomatoes, one large romaine leaf bent in half, Irish bacon, cheese, one sunny side egg and my usual side of mayo.  This burger was so large, I could not even finish it.

I hate doing this, but this place just ruined my day. \nThe husband took a break from work and decided to take me out to breakfast on this beautiful sunny October morning in the Inner Sunset. Our destination was actually Park Chow (we love you, Park Chow), but they had already stopped serving breakfast, so we decided to try another nearby place... and then we made the mistake of walking into this place. To start the girl who was behind the counter looked like she clearly didn't want to be there, which okay, I don't blame her. Then the knife that was placed in front of me to use was dirty. Okay, I didn't complain because I hate being that kind of person, so I just reached for the seating next to me and grabbed other knife. Then my food comes and there was a freaking long, blond HAIR in it. I tell the girl about it ( I'm sorry I had to disturb you from playing with your phone, lady, but there is a hair in my food!) and she doesn't even apologize, or anything, just takes my plate away and doesn't even ask me if I'd like to order it again or if I'd like something else, she just takes it away with a annoyed expression. Not even the slightest apology. Okay, girl, maybe it's not your fault that YOUR blonde hair was in my plate, but neither is mine. You could at least had been nicer about it. It's called good costumer service. After an  awkward while without even saying a word she brings me another plate ... WITHOUT ever asking me if I want it. I take the food... and because I don't want to be a bitch and say that i don't want it, because I lost my appetite, I just take some hesitant bites, try to eat the eggs and the english muffin, but then I just give up (the food was terrible by the way). Then she brings the bill and that's when my husband gets upset . After all that terrible experience she charges the full price for my food? REALLY?  I would have gladly and quietly payed the bill, walked away and never go back, but my husband worked in the food industry for many years and he HATES bad customer service. And when he complains about it, the cook comes out and tells us that we are trying to eat for free and that he's seen that before. REALLY? REALLY? \n\nThanks for ruining my morning, Cafe Rain Tree. I am always surprised that in a city like San Francisco, with so many amazing options for food, a place like this is still open.

With so much going on in the surrounding area in the way of mind-blowing food, it can sometimes be hard to notice.  But if you're interested in solid, standard diner fare with a pleasant atmosphere and friendly service, Rain Tree is your place.\n\nMost of my experience with Rain Tree was back when it was open in the evenings.  There was definitely a certain charm to its bright, friendly decor when it was dark outside and though I still enjoy going sometimes in the mornings, nothing's as great as breakfast at night.  Except maybe ponies.  Eating breakfast at night on a pony would trigger the apocalypse.\n\nThe fare at Rain Tree is very standard.  You have various arrangements of eggs, meat, and bread, and you have sandwiches that can all be served with avocado (thank you, California!).  I give it props for the crepe section on the menu, which is a very nice touch and goes a little beyond standard diner fare.  The way the food is executed is very standard - if you sit at the counter you can watch your food spluttering away on the griddle, which is always fun.  The last time I was at Rain Tree, I had an egg white omelet containing spinach, onion, mushroom, and sausage.  The bits containing sausage, as one might expect, were excellent!  But the rest was a little bland.  Part of me appreciates that, because it means it's just the basics and not a whole lot else.  But if you're looking for something with a bit more pizzazz, you may want to seek it elsewhere.\n\nTo be fair, if you're looking for particular elements or ingredients, I'm pretty sure the staff would be happy to accommodate you.  Everyone who has ever served me has been very friendly and has handled my requests like pros.  I think that says a lot, since in a lot of diners I've found myself more or less on my own.\n\nI kind of feel like Cafe Rain Tree is the \"little engine that could\" of the Inner Sunset diner scene.  Does it have the rad moves of some of its elder brethren?  Nah.  Does it do just fine without?  You bet.", "author": "Becca S."}

Seems quite Avatar-ish doesn't it? I was kinda bummed when I walked in. It seemed like your typical, old Americana diner, the kind you see in the middle of nowhere, like the desert, the kind of place destined to get attacked by zombies.\n\nThe wait staff bordered on nice and cold. Really couldn't decide. They were Russian and one of them was consistently being hit on by two older American men. Classic lines \"Wow your name's Oksana? Were you named after the figure skater Oksana Baiul?\" \"Um, no. She and I are the same age.\" \"Really? I just thought cuz you're both named Oksana!\"  We really wanted to go over there, slap him and say \"That's cuz Oksana's a common Russian name, dumbass.\"\n\nThe food was decent though, I have to say, and cheaper then the breakfast spots in LA.  I got the Joe's Special (although I have no idea who Joe is and the menu doesn't really explain Joe's whereabouts).  His special comes with eggs scrambled with ground beef, onions, mushrooms and spinach.  I was hopeful but the beef came out plain. Unseasoned. Maybe it's the Angeleno in me, when I hear ground beef I think tacos.  I think flavor. The potatos were home-fried but also unseasoned and the wheat toast was average and arrived pre-buttered.

We usually go on Thursdays (random, I know).  The locals are just as down to earth and friendly.  It's not breakfast at Mama's, but it's better than the franchise feel of IHOPs or Denny's.\n\nI've never had to wait and our favorite booth is always ready and open for us.  By our third visit, Sunny has our order preferences down and even greets us personally from the counter the moment we walk through the door.\n\nNow for the food:\n\n*I usually like the Mediterranean scramble when I want something light, the feta cheese and artichoke hearts are its highlights.  \n\n*The omelets are huge -- don't be deceived by the neat way the cook arranges your plate.

I've had breakfast there 2x in the past couple of months. Food is mediocre, service is without any heart. I ordered eggs one time & a sandwich another time. Really average food. \n\nWe were one of two tables of customers & we STILL didn't get coffee poured. Asked for extra napkins...she never came back. Little things like that are a drag at breakfast time.\n\nAnd why oh why can't ANYONE seem to understand a request for crispy potatoes??? They couldn't either.\n\nTry Irving St. Cafe or Art's Cafe for a much better meal and experience.", "author": "Dee B."}

Kudos to the cook for turning out consistently decent breakfast, pancakes, bacon eggs over medium (and there's not many place with truly decent panceakes consistently here).  But both times the waitress overcharged us and got the order wrong.  Cannot fill up the coffee, forgets syrup with pancakes, etc.  You have to chase her down to get anything and she forgets everything and doesn't seem to know the menu.  But still...good pancakes.", "author": "oyefunke a."}

On a whim, we decided to eat here on Memorial Day because Art's Cafe was closed.  What a sad mistake. We sat for over 15 mins before the one guy behind the counter (no other wait person) brought us a menu, right about when we were ready to get up and leave.  The 2nd wait person finally arrived at 10am and it was clear they were understaffed for the holiday breakfast crowd.   The food was a sad comparison to the past.  My corned beef hash was outta a can (I can do this at home!) but the over easy eggs were done just right, oozing creamy yolks over the hash when pierced.  It came with 2 slices of wheat bread (my choice) and disgusting diced potatoes, whiter than my cupboards.  Did the cook even bother to cook it long enough?  It had this semi-stale after taste so I left it on my plate, untouched.  What's even sadder is that you couldn't catch the attention of the 2 wait persons.  The table next to us got up & paid at the counter, dead tired of waiting for the check.  We had to do the same.  Couldn't even get a 2nd coffee refill because they don't bother to scan the room to see what the customers need.  Adios, Raintree, service is bad enough that my hard earned money can take a hike elsewhere.", "author": "Ry T."}

The omelettes are yummy but nothing really special about the place.  I feel that if you are going for the diner feeling, then really go with it and play up the space more.

A soggy english muffin, poached egg made in old water, a slice of overripe tomato, a SLICE of cheddar cheese, dusted with parmesan and dried parsley.  Served with tasteless potatoes.  All for a hard-hitting $8.25.  My diner tasting coffee was $1.60.  My gf had the french toast, which was average, but priced a little better at $5.25 (I think).  She liked her milkshake, which was just under $4.  I'll never go there again.  For good, cheap diner food, I'll just go around the corner to M's.", "author": "Jack O."}
