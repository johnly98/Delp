So many things wrong with the entire experience. \nArrived at 5pm, left at 5:37pm sans sandwich. Didn't have fresh bread, or many other items. 3 other people ordered before me and got their order first. The trainee did not know simple math and got flustered and when I asked why I was overcharged 6$ the sandwich maker/only other person in the shop, put her hand up to me and told me don't be rude. After back and forth for a few minutes where I was trying to help him do the math because they don't have receipts or a calculator, I went to sit down. 15mins later my sandwich was not done. When I asked them status, she immediately replied give her her money back. Then the cashier spent 10mins trying to figure out how much to give me after I told him 10x it was $12.40 while he yelled at me. I just went in for a sandwich, wasted 40mins and got yelled at.

Up until this point probably Brother's sandwich in LA was my fave but as a person who normally hates sandwiches I can see why people like sandwiches, after Mr. Pickles. It's in a what I thought was a somewhat random location, very residential. It's easy enough to find though and it's no-nonsense, straight forward good food. It's super casual and a bit run down with limited seating.\n\nMy hubs and I shared a Station 7 sandwich and it was SO good. The chicken breast was a teeny bit dry but the pepper jack cheese was all melted, the sauces were an incredible and the veggies in it were SO fresh. It was one of those times where you're like, wow this is what fresh veggies are supposed to taste like and you remember you eat un-fresh delayed delivery food from middle man grocer which is just depressing. The dutch crunch bread was probably the best part of the sandwich, every single bite filled my nostrils with super fresh bread-y scent and the texture though it cuts up your mouth is incredible. \n\nOverall, would HIGHLY recommend, I can't wait to come back!

You should really think of changing your name since you won't give people pickles on their sandwiches, Mr. Pickles.\n\nNext I ordered #17, a BBQ chicken sandwich with pesto.

I had the worst possible experience coming into mr.pickle today. First I ordered 'the bear' or 'the boar'. First they don't take credit cards. That part I don't mind but then I noticed they don't hand out any receipts. They don't punch it in the register. They don't keep any records of sales or orders. Sound fishy? Uncle Sam will probably catch up to them sometime or another. \n      \n      After waiting 20 mins or so I noticed the people who were behind me  getting their sandwiches and started eating. Then one of the guys asked me what I ordered. I told him what it was then he told me he lost the post-it they use to keep track of what sandwiches to make. Who writes the order on a post-it and think that is a good system to be organized?\n\n      He goes and tells me that it will take another 10 mins to make the sandwich that they totally forgot about. This was after already waiting over 20 mins after I placed my order. \n      \n      I asked why would it take that long? They said because it needs to be toasted for 3 mins. Well does it take 7 mins to finish it? Are they making everyone else's sandwiches before they get to mine? He then told me they can make a cold sandwich for me right away. I looked at the menu and all the sandwiches they make are all toasted except for 2 . It has a \"T\" next to sandwich on the menu to indicate that the sandwich is toasted. \n     \n      He was kind enough to refund my money and make the cold sandwich for free. I thought that was a nice gesture. I then ordered the House Combo. They make the sandwich right away and in just under 30 mins I finally had a sandwich and went on my way. When I got back to my office to eat since I had no time to eat there I saw that they gave me a sandwich with only cheese and a cucumber!!!! I can not begin to explain how pissed off I was when I saw that!!! \n\n      The only thing that I can come up with is that they had to have did that on purpose since I took them up on taking the free sandwich. They offered it to me because they made the mistake and had me wait close to 30 mins to get a sandwich I didn't originally ordered. Who eats and orders a sandwich with only cheese and a cucumber??? \n\n       This is by far the worst experience I have ever had in getting a sandwich. I would not recommend this place not because of the sandwiches but for how they treat their customers and how they are cheating on their record keeping. How do you claim accurate sales and pay taxes when you don't keep any records of them? No receipts, all cash, and take orders on post-its.", "author": "Alex H."}

I needed some grub and I took to my Yelp bookmarks to try something new.  I decided to try Mr. Pickle's.  I first heard of Mr. Pickle's in SF Weekly when their iconic sign was stolen and I was always intrigued.\n\nI made my way inside and it looked like a nice mom and pop deli.  I took a glance at their menu and the Cesar Chavez and The Gaucho caught my attention.  I chose the Gaucho because the chicken comes marinated in my favorite sauce, Frank's Red Hot Sauce.  The sandwich consists of chicken marinated in Frank's sauce on a sourdough roll topped off with mayo, mustard, pesto, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles and peperoncini.  The sandwich also comes with ranch dressing, but I'm not a fan of the dressing so I requested no ranch.  \n\nThe sandwich is a generous portion and comes nicely toasty.  The sourdough roll was tasty and crunchy and the sandwich exploded with flavor from the chicken to the sauce.  The sandwich was a little spicy because of the wing sauce but it was perfect in my opinion.  The crunch of the bread, the flavorful chicken, and the condiments all added for a tasty sub.  I had intentions of saving the other half for later, but I couldn't resist.  \n\nMy only complaint is the lady behind the counter, perhaps she's the owner?  She had the TV on and they were running a news story about the new Arizona immigration law and she made a coarse remark regarding illegal immigrants.

There was basically just Subway (everywhere!) and Quiznos was the hot new thing. There was also a scattering of independent shops that were hit or miss, nothing too special unless they served 'Boars Head' which usually meant they wanted 10 bucks for a sub. And of course local California chain Togos was the place when you wanted something special (back when avocado was special)\n\nFor some reason the sandwich renaissance SoCal experienced has yet to make its way north. Jersey Mike is here but you have to hunt for them. Togos is still here going strong but none of the other big chains currently in SoCal raising the stakes are present. No Capriottis, no Gandolfos, no Firehouse Subs. For this reason Mr. Pickles seems to be thriving and all the Bay Area folk I talk to rave about the place like its....actually good.\n\nIts not that Mr. Pickles is bad. Its just that the bar has been raised so much by all these newcomers that Mr. Pickles now ranks somewhere down around Subway as far as Im concerned. Let me take that back, at least you can tell the difference between one meat and another at Mr. Pickles but to me their quality still isn't as high as the other big national LA chains. I like some things about Mr. Pickles. Throwing in a cookie is a nice touch (even if they are usually burned or hard as a rock) and I'd prefer a pickle like the real delis do.\n\nI think most people just keep going there because of nostalgias sake which isn't a bad thing. But I have a feeling Mr. Pickles days are numbered. Like Quiznos which slowly got replaced by Jersey Mike franchises and the Togos locations that are slowly closing  down as LA's sub titans battle for marketplace, its only a matter of time before they make their way north. I hope Mr. Pickles figures it out and adapts in time to survive. As for me, I'll be counting the days until Gandolfos opens nearby!", "author": "R S."}

I got the sandwich that with chicken, honey mustard, extra pickles, in a dutch crunch roll (called Station 7). Being Sunday, I assumed I was going to get stale bread. Boy was I wrong! The roll was soft, crunchy, and perfectly toasted. My teeth sunk into it and my biteful of sandwich melted into my mouth.

I thought he was get annoyed and roll his eyes at me, but he didn't. :) When I was done with my meal (since half definitely filled me up) I requested a container; instead of giving it to me, he wrapped it up. It was a simple, nice gesture to say the least. \n\nAnd the sauce!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-22", "description": "Located quite conveniently on the corner of 20th and S. Van Ness, Mr Pickle's is an excellent small sandwich shop with a huge, creative menu. Besides making your own sandwich out of all the normal ingredients, the 31+ specialty sandwiches are innovative and robust. Along with fresh, (usually) flavorful meats and veggies, their sauces are savory and plentiful.\n\nSome Favorites-\n\n#13: Cesar Chavez - Seems to be everyone's favorite. Chicken breast, bacon, avocado and jack cheese on sourdough roll. Chicken is always tender, bacon is usually slightly chewy but sometimes nice and crispy, avocado is abundant, and the sourdough rolls are fresh and immense.\n\n#3: Tony Soprano - Great italian combination here. Salami, ham, mortadella, provolone cheese and italian dressing. Excellent on either the sourdough or dutch crunch.\n\n#19: Station 7 - Chicken breast marinated in honey mustard (Yes!) with pepper jack cheese and avocado on dutch crunch. Not sure how anyone can dislike this combination.\n\n#10: The Bear - For when I want to get messy. Hot roast beef with bbq sauce and melted cheddar cheese. Healthy serving of roast beef, that doesn't get overcooked in the process of heating. Tangy and sweet bbq sauce, with no spice at all (A spicy bbq sauce would be awesome here) but nonetheless a nice compliment to the roast beef and cheddar.\n\nBesides those big four, there's plenty of other delicious choices, as well as unlimited possibilities for your own custom supersandwich.\n\nNot the most attractive decor or layout but it works, as it simply wouldn't feel right if it were much classier. Service is usually great, but sometimes it can be on the slow side. They only accept cash, and more often than not the ATM is out of order, so you need to go across the street to the laundromat. Prices are very fair, and seating is scarce, be prepared to eat standing up or get it to-go.

What kind of sandwich place has sandwiches that AUTOMATICALLY come with pepperocini and pesto at no additional cost??  I'll give you a hint--an awesome one.  (You can also ask for toppings to be excluded as well, and they're good at honoring that request.)\n\nThe portions are HUGE, too.  I can usually pack away a lot of food for someone my size, but these beasts are usually good to last for 2 meals--or at least a meal and a snack.  If you do manage to finish a whole one in one sitting (as I may or may not have challenged a friend to do), do not be surprised if you find yourself passed out in a food coma afterward.  (If you're lucky enough to work around here and eat a whole one for lunch, don't say I didn't warn you that your afternoon productivity will massively decrease...)\n\nThey also have about 20 specialty sandwiches to choose from.  My favorite is the Mercy Me--warm chicken breast with marinara and provolone.  Amaaaazing.  I usually get it sans mayo, but the pepperocini gives it just the right kick.\n\nI've tried the Gaucho too -- chicken breast marinated in Frank's BBQ sauce and ranch.  If you like hot wings or ranch, this is your go-to sando.\n\nJust make sure you have dolla bills, yo, because it's cash only.\n\n**Sidenote: I drove by this weekend, and I'm happy to report that the Mr. Pickles sign is back!

It is now staffed by one woman, and one guy (same ones every day), and things are going much more smoothly. The sandwiches are not gourmet, but you get what you expect to get, no more and no less, and they don't make mistakes like they did before. For me it is still a meal of convenience and I always feel a pang when I spend money on not great food. If I could be whisked anywhere in the city to eat I would never eat here. \n\nOld review: I love sandwiches. Unfortunately, Mr. Pickles is the closest sandwich shop to my work so I eat here from time to time. The quality of their meat seems to have improved since they first opened, but their bread is just stuff you'd buy off the shelf from Safeway. The kind that never molds or gets hard. In a city full of amazing bread this is a crime. \n\nThese sandwiches are NOT made with love. I don't order the posted specials, so whatever I order, they get wrong every time.  Literally every time. I started to pre-write my order on paper so I could just hand it to them and cut down on one possible point of failure, and they still get it wrong.  Its almost comical.  I wonder, what will be missing from my sandwich today, the avocado, or the cheese?  Will I get mayo instead of mustard?

Parking can usually be had nearby, but plan on putting three quarters in the meter because you're likely to be waiting for about that amount of time if you arrive between 11:30 - 1:00.", "author": "Lucius M."}

We get back to our workplace and I looked at my sandwich and the first thought was \"DAMN, pretty big, lots of meat, my kinda sandwich\".

Really he should be called Senor Pickles, but Mr. Pickles answers to no one. Mr. Pickles makes me feel safe. I feel like he's protecting the street. What harm could befall me while Mr. Pickles is on the beat?\nHaving said all that, I've only been there once. I'm not sure about the price since it was on work. There's very little seating, a counter and some stools. The sandwiches were pretty good. The one time I went in there all workers looked like dopey hooligans. Big teen-aged boys who were joking around a lot. I liked that. Mr. Pickles is a small Bay Area chain, and each place names their sandwiches something different. I found this slightly confusing when picking up the order I placed.\nI suppose this review isn't too helpful, but really it's all about Mr. Pickles himself. Mr. Pickles! I squeal with delight each time I see him.", "author": "Daniella C."}

I am a big fan of the Ceasar Chavez as any sandwich with chicken, avacado, and swiss is heaven in my book, the Padre's Pride from the San Mateo Location (the original) is better.  I stop off here to get food for beach trips or ball games and every time am glad I did.   Get to go and call in your order if you can, the wait can be quite long.", "author": "Darren R."}

Boy have I been missing out! I got one of the most rockin' sandwiches I've had in a long time. Mortadella with melted swiss cheese, good bread, pesto and peppers make it messy in a good way.

The sandwitches arent horribly cheap but they are big and tasty...The soprano on dutch crunch is simply killer and a real meal and a half for most of us normal folk...the service is fast and friendly and the chip and drink selection is pretty damn good as well.

Featuring tons of meat, fresh bread, and pesto spread onto every sandwich they make these bad boys offer a huge sandwich with a lot of flavor.  Try the Tony Soprano (it features just about every meat in existance that ends in a vowel) or my #1 pick the Pastrami with Bacon and get your daily reccmmended allowance of nitrates.", "author": "matthew w."}
