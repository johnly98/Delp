An epic pillow fight with around 1000+ random strangers? YES. This is the best place to take out your aggression in a healthy way using pillows to hit people and having the time of your life. The event is non-official and non-permitted so come at your own will. There was a website that stated the event starts at 6pm and that's pretty much when it started. Not sure if I would say this is a \"good for children\" event due to all the semi-violence. Although, there were kids and I got beat up by 3 kids with really hard pillows all at once! Kids can be really aggressive... Hahaha. \n\nRecommendation: wear a mask because I didn't and I was choking on feathers and cotton. Yuck. Maybe some fun costume! \n\nKnocking off one star because some people took this pillow fight too seriously. When it started dying down, there were 2 girls that were hitting each other with pillows and then their pillows turned into fists instead...yikes. I would say to leave earlier than near the end because things get kind of crazy. \n\nBut other than that, just an event to have fun. Definitely an event to go to at least once!

Police were there too, don't get me wrong, but they were merely there to make sure it doesn't get completely out of control. \n\nAnd pillows were scattered all over the place , so if you do bring your pillow, be prepared to lose your pillow, be also you will find another random pillow and can pick it up. \n\nAlso a lot of people wer dressed up.

Seems like the rain also affected attendance because I think there were less people this year compared to 2010.\n\nThe city complaints every year that it takes $17,500 (quoted from the newspaper) to clean up the streets after this event. That figure varies depending on who u ask, some say it's much higher after adding disposal costs. I always thought that city employees liked an excuse to get overtime. \n\nOn the other hand, u could join a new group of volunteer do-gooders to clean up the area after the event (until 10:30pm).

Romance.\n\nF*** Valentine's Day.  \n\nIt is one of the largest scams in history driven by capitalist intentions.  This is not reminiscent of an era where love letters were carefully written and delivered, despite the rain/sleet/snow.  Or when a lock of hair was sent to an admirer.  Or a Nocturne is composed and dedicated to the love of their life.  Ah.  Now that is romantic.\n\nThe scam is that the usual bouquet of roses triple in cost.  The aisles of every retail establishment is bursting at the seams with crimson objects of artificial affection.  Single women feel like crap if they don't get anything or have someone listed as their +1.  Hopeless romantics that make me rolI my eyeballs all the way back Beetlejuice style.  I'm not bitter.  I've had my fair share of V-day.  I even had three ridiculously large bouquets delivered to my place of employment once by the same guy but they all died within a week.  Couple $$$ out the door.  And who can really consume 2 pounds of chocolate?  That is the perfect amount of fat I need extracted from my butt.\n\nNo.  I'm just getting too old.  And time is too precious to waste.  Having expectations is the worst curse anyone can do to themselves.  Why wait until this day to profess a love for someone when you can do it everyday! \n\nA big hug.  \n\nA bright smile.  \n\nWarm thoughts.  \n\nWords of affection.\n\nThis is where the SF Pillow Fight Club steps in with a reality check and curbs your enthusiasm with a big bag of down in your face.  Hanging out with a positive crowd and bonking someone on the head with a good goose down pillow (the feathers kind of poke) is the best kind of love give/take.  It is fluffy.  Warm.  And if you need to hug someone, viola!  Hug the pillow.  And not to mention, lots of fun.

Haha, just kidding! Kind of. You can bring a date too. :) Prepare to smack people and get smacked around, wage mini-battles against strangers, breathe in a ton of feathers, and have an amazing night. :D \n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n- Come with friends! Safety and more fun in numbers. It's easy to get lost in the crowd or get mobbed if you're not careful, so it helps to have buddies to back you up.\n- Bring a synthetic pillow and face mask/scarf/something to cover your mouth. Seriously, breathing in those feathers is so not the business. It's entertaining at first, but you won't feel the same once you start coughing. No bueno. :(\n- Bring a camera! The ferry building and the plaza are gorgeous at night with the giant, action-packed flurry of people and beautiful lights. You will get some amazing pictures, but definitely be careful as attacks can come out  of nowhere and damaging/losing your phone or pricey camera is never fun.\n- Some people can be a little too aggressive. There is plenty of security on the sidelines keeping an eye out, but sometimes things get lost in the chaos, and people get hurt. :( So, again, bring friends to be safe and watch out who you decide to pick a fight with. A few bumps and bruises are alright here and there, but my friend got knocked out cold when he got lost by himself. That part of the night I don't want to repeat ever again. :( BE CAREFUL!\n- Some people bring their kids, and I mean YOUNG kids. Ummm. Yeah, no, I'd be terrified for my tiny child. Just make sure you don't run one over by accident. \n\nSo anyway, just be safe and (mostly) considerate, and you're good to go. :) I promise you it's worth trying at least once.", "author": "Grace T."}

The commotion, crowds, spirit, fun, and sheer jubilation was great way to spend part of Vday evening in the city. The crowd was massive. I heard that previous years had 2,000 to 4,000 participants. There were tons of people spectating on the sidelines, loads of photographers cruising about the herds of people with their fancy cameras and gear, and loads just in it to hit-and-get-hit by swinging pillows. Although the official start time was 6pm, the action went well beyond 30+ minutes into a beautiful, clear SF night with NO FOG or wind chill Sunday night. It was THE PERFECT setting for all the crazy madness!\n\nI definitely recommend for all to come see or take part in this festive annual event down in the Embarcadero's Justin Herman Plaza. It's great with friends or just by yourself. Something different from the everyday, monotonous routines. Come enjoy and experience it! I know I'll be back for more next year and beyond.

My boyfriend at the time drove me out to San Francisco on Valentine's day, giving no indication of our plans what-so-ever. Held a bag with two pillows, but I was still clueless. We went to Embarcadero Square around 5:45pm and sat around waiting. Still, I didn't know what was going on. Sure, I noticed other people strangely hanging around the square, holding over-sized bags, and anxiously watching the clock tower, but the dots didn't really connect for me until the clock struck 6 o'clock and people ran into the center with their pillows held high.\n\nDefinitely not what I was expecting!\n\nWe split up and entered the crowd separately. I got my good share of hits and some elbowing, but I didn't care. I was having a blast attacking random strangers, enjoying the silly costumes of others, and soaking in the excitement and energy of the crowd. My favorite part of the night was when pillow-fight participants using down-pillows wore out their weapons. When the pillows broke, a great release of feathers would fly into the air, having some semblance of snow. It's really beautiful, but also deadly to the lungs! I even proceeded to making a feather angel on the ground.\n\nI hope I can make it out to the Great San Francisco Pillow Fight again. I had the greatest time.

I haven't seen the pics yet but I'm anticipating great things since one just bought a really nice camera and lens.  I'm sure there were some other people there I knew but never found to show them my love, which equals a good tolchok to the head.\n\nProduct: Well, nothing's being sold, except maybe your soul for the chance to wallop some schmuck upside the head with a large bed pillow and know no repercussions will be forthcoming.  In other words, AWESOME value.\n\nService: Hmmm, people wearing helmets... You'd think that was cheating but it actually draws attention.  It's a great SERVICE to all the other pillow fighters because it's liking painting a giant red bulls eye on your head.  It also provides great energy and motivation as arm and shoulder muscles begin to fatigue.  Take the second wind I just described and multiple it by, say, 30 and that's what wearing a thong as a 5'4\" scrawny caucasian does.  Disclaimer: I'm 6'5\" so that was NOT me.  Being so tall was actually a disservice to myself... little people, why you gotta hate?!?  Oh, and the UN peacekeepers provided a great service by toting out victims on stretchers.  Last but not least, people were giving me crap about having a small pillow... at least it wasn't an airplane pillow.  Really?  You know who you are, bring the big guns next time.\n\nAtmosphere: hot, stuffy, people pushing and shoving and yelling, feathers a-flying... general mayhem until about a half hour in when people start getting pooped and call for reinforcements.  This is the -1.  It was too crowded, or I'm too tall and my arms are too long, to really rev up a good swing every time.\n\nUniquity: They had pillow fights in the quad at UC Davis so this isn't all that unique.  But it's great times and a way to let out some stress on V Day, especially if the world hasn't seen fit to bless you with a date with that special someone afterward.", "author": "Robert R."}

I, like many of you, upon first opening the box and seeing the strap thought: \"Dude, this looks stupid. I'm gonna put the camera in my pocket anyway. No way am I going to use this stupid strap!\"\n\nWell, the SF Pillow Fight is exactly the place where you will wish you HAD attached the wrist strap to the camera, coz you sure will want to use it. You're gonna be amazed at the awesomeness of the event. It will look like a million people out there just slamming pillows into each other, feathers flying, screams of laughter erupting, and utter chaos all around. Everyone will have a look of pure JOY, like we had when we all were 3 years old. You're gonna think...this is FREAKIN AWESOME! \n\nOf course you're gonna want to take pics of you, your friends, and all the mayhem. You get your group together, and hold the camera away, pointed towards you all (you know...coz you can't NOT be in the picture that you're taking). You hold down the button, see the red-eye flash flicker a few times, and WHACK! That's right...someone has just smacked your camera with a pillow and it  has flown off into the crowd. You yell....everyone is yelling. You scream....everyone is screaming. You run after it....everyone is running everywhere.

What a Valentine's Day it was! A chaotic blend of laughs, cries, giggles, guffaws, screams, hits, near misses, near hits, races, runs and just plain fun.\n\nIt was a great way to let off steam, get a really good workout (try laughing, hitting someone with a pillow, ducking, defending, avoid getting hit by a pillow, running, finding your way, taking a breath, side stepping, two stepping and then posing for a camera), and just another different way to celebrate Valentine's Day.\n\nSome notes to point out:\n1. Get there on time or you'll be left on the outer perimeter trying to get in\n2. If you start at the center of the mass, remember, you're going to get pummeled way more (I enjoyed it!)\n3. If you can, get goggles (swimming goggles work) since the minuscule  feathers might irritate the eyes\n4. Wear a scarf to cover your mouth or in 15 minutes you'll sound and look like a cat hacking up a fur.. er... feather ball\n5. DO NOT wear caps, beanies or hats you love for you will feel the pang of separation\n6. Unless you have a camera that has a strap that goes around your neck, watch your camera coz it could get damaged\n7. Best place to get video footage is either towards the fountain on the 4th step looking down or right in the crowd (the latter seemed very Blair Witch but with feathers and giggles)\n8. BEST ADVICE: have a good time, let loose, hit someone you don't know, hit someone you find cute, hit someone who worked with you before to get even (I did).\n9. ONLY WORD OF CAUTION: it is a petri dish of germs especially if there is a bug going around. So be warned, if you're one of them folks who is nervous about catching something other than that cute guy / girl's eye. :B\n\nWe called it a night at 7PM and then we dragged our asses to the Market Bar (review below) for a great victory (?)

If you can't find a date (or have one anyway) this is the best way to just let loose and vent with a pillow.  The major \"tenets\" are can't hit anyone without a pillow AND/OR people with a camera.  However, this event has gotten much larger than in past years so watch out for the no-fun people who just bash left and right with no wanton disregard--it's one reason why the SF govt has been putting the control on this event (and the Bay to Breakers to name) .  I've been hit without a pillow and at times even with a camera so there's a chance for someone to just run amok.  \n\nWhen the event is on a weeknight the best part is seeing all the corporate people getting out of work and either watching what's going on or just partaking in the whole tomfoolery.  Only in San Francisco.\n\nIt's still for kids but with the advent of people wrecking the spirit of the show best to leave them at home (or take them elsewhere safe).   That is a tossup since it's literally an all-ages event.  I don't know if they'll have it again in 2011 but I hope it happens.  Weed out the bad apples and let the people have fun--that's what the pillow fight is about. ;-)  Despite its recent shortcomings, the SF Pillow Fight gets 5 stars from me because it's something fun on what is supposed to be a \"romantic\" holiday--the dateless people can have something to do, and the couples as well!\n\nGet there early--usually all the fun happens before the clock strikes six--then it's open season. :-)\n\n-----\nEdit 2/17/2011: Another pillow fight.  Thought the cops were going to crack down but they decided to let people have fun.  Only d-bags were the ones who tried to hit me when I didn't have a pillow AND I had a camera and the people who actually tried to stir up a fight.  Extra kudos to the people who tried to clean up during/after the event--which probably help reduce the bill and to keep in the spirit of the leave no trace premise.  Decided to try and help them out for a bit.  Because of that grass-roots effort it still gets five stars.  I will have to agree--DON'T HIT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A PILLOW.  Good thing I took a pic of those perpetrators but given they were having fun--I just have to smile.  If they called me (name curse word) that would be asking for it.  The idea is to have fun.

Focusing any modicum of attention on an area higher than an inch or two off the ground reveals the source of at least one of the materials covering the well-worn asphalt of the beginning of Market Street, which in this case happens to be a close-packed and howling mob of total strangers all laying into each other with varying degrees of force. In the middle of the street. With pillows. \n\nPrevious generations have had a number of definers which are too varied, strange, and otherwise recorded by sources far more knowledgeable than I to attempt to give any kind of summation, but I truly believe that nothing as yet invented can top the flash mob. A group of total strangers gathered together in a commonly-used space to accomplish a small, concrete, and completely discrete goal provides an atmosphere and energy at once intimately related to and yet totally separate from the gatherings of the past, filled with both the terror and promise inherent in any large gathering of people but enhanced by both the anonymity and immediacy afforded by the electronically-inspired medium.  \n\nAs far as I can discern, the larger political goal of a giant pillow fight is a repudiation of the consumptionist mores and values which permeate our culture's supposed celebration of intimacy through the vehicle of hitting each other with feather-filled sacks, to emphasize the pure human contact that occurs in such an act and provide an outlet for the unseemly glut of emotions riled up by the mass-media machine in the lead-up to said celebration. However, this has absolutely nothing to do with ducking the trio of large men swinging pillows with more enthusiasm than discretion, making sure to smash your own head-rest into the small girl in front of you with less force than you otherwise might, or attempting to change the course of your latest sally mid-swing as you notice your intended target is wrapped in no less than four expensive-looking cameras and desperately trying to proclaim that he's more interested in documenting the experience for his no-doubt-extensive Twitter audience than actually partaking in it.\n\nWhat else is there to say? Whether you're lucky enough to be kicking off a romantic evening guaranteed to end in bedroom gymnastics or simply bemoaning that modern society is seemingly designed for couples - all the way down to tax law, for goodness' sake - show up and worship at the Church of Down Feathers (And Suitable Synthetic Products).", "author": "Alex B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-02-16", "description": "V Day 2007:  On this most god-awful of cloying commercial holidays nearly a 1000 San Francisco residents partook in a Valentine's Day Pillow fight at the Embarcadero.  When my coworker invited me I was initially hesitant to go.  It was listed on the Squid List and I had a horrible vision of a hideous seething mass of old 'Burners' with manic panicked hair and striped tights writhing around in an orgiastic frenzy of feathers and dust mites.  The whole thing smacked of SF Burning Man style hedonism.  As it turned out the crowd was more Mission hipster than Burner.  A very slight improvement in my estimation.  And much to my surprise it was really fun!  I brought with me my oldest, saggiest IKEA throw pillow coated with a variety of suspicious looking white stains.  Before your imagination carries you away; I must state that the pillow was from my office couch at work though, not my bed.  Whatever that means. \n \nAnyway, it was very cathartic.  I wouldn't have guessed it but there is no better release for pent up aggression than wildly swinging an old pillow at some strangers head!  I had particular fun aiming for those with dreadlocks and/or annoying sunglasses. Feathers were flying everywhere and the concrete was strewn with the fuzzy innards of decreased pillows.  People were giggling maniacally as they clobbered one another.  After 30 minutes or so my friends and I emerged sweaty and ecstatic. Our hair was fringed in feathers and our throats tickled.  I was happy.  And I wanted a drink to celebrate.  \n\nSo the questions that begs to be asked is:  why a pillow fight on Valentine's Day?  Could  it be that the only way that single men and women can relate to each other in this city is to bludgeon one another over the head anonymously in a crowd and then run in the opposite direction - laughing hysterically?  Is it that this syrupy holiday, which never fails to freak out everyone (both single and coupled), creates such mass anxiety and irritation that we must exorcise this pent up angst through pretend fighting?  Or perhaps on the supposed 'day of love', we, as a society, prefer to express our hidden hostility overtly in a frenzy of passionate yet harmless attacks towards random strangers?  Hmmmm....\n\nOn to my favorite subject:  the inability of men and women to court and date one another in an even vaguely sane way.  While I enjoyed the pillow fight I cannot help but feel a bit sad that it was one of the most uninhibited and carefree times that I have had around strangers in quite a while.  I didn't meet anyone there, nor was I attempting to, but still it seemed a refreshing moment when men and women could put aside their mutual suspicions of one another and just have fun together in a non contrived, silly way.  Most of the time I feel like I am trapped at a bad junior high school dance where boys and girls eye each other fearfully yet desirously from opposite sides of the room.  Everyone is afraid to take the first move, so no one does.  The music plays on and overall things are quite boring.  \n\nLater Valentine's Day night, after several drinks with friends, I found myself walking home alone, swinging my pillow at whatever struck my fancy and cracking up. Just before my house I found an old chain link fence.  I beat my pillow against it until it split open.  That night I went to bed smiling.", "author": "Maria M."}

News flash, people, using an otherwise fun event to be mean to other people is not cool and a really douchey thing to do. The douchiness of that mentality is only eclipsed by the complete disregard for the location and the environment. People come, they have fun, and they don't bother cleaning up after themselves. The obscene amount of debris is left in the plaza and worst yet, washed into the bay by way of storm drains. The city is left with the mess because this was all done without a permit. The cost of clean up will come out of something else in the city's budget, but who cares right? Nobody's gonna take away our right for irresponsible fun. yeah... I wish pillow fight would just die.", "author": "Miriya S."}

The best part was that i only brought one pillow, which my friend used and i ended up creating one from the carnage on the ground and a discarded pillowcase. it was probably the grossest thing i've done in a long time, collecting slightly damp goosedown to shove in a dirty pillowcase, but hey, it was worth it once i started whapping people in the head. even though the plaza was PACKED with people, i ended up running into a mutual friend and having a mini battle. something i will definetly remember to bring next year will be a mask to protect my lungs from inhaling pillow feathers, because for the rest of the night my comrades and i were hacking up pillow dust. it was gross. but the satisfaction i got after whapping random strangers over the head and in the groin with a pillow made me mark this on my calender for next year.", "author": "elisabeth s."}

I did not get to bring a pillow because I didn't want to carry it around and I couldn't just donate it to a Homeless person because I like my pillow. Anyways, I took a lot of pictures and recorded parts of this event. Everyone was having fun and I didn't see any angry people. I saw this one girl bleeding from her finger and she said she didn't know how it got busted open. Feathers were everywhere! A lint remover is a good idea to bring and don't wear glasses! I bumped into people in different parts of Frisco and asked if they enjoyed the pillow fight, they all said yes.", "author": "Men A."}
