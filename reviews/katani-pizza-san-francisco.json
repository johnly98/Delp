GLUTEN-FREE Pizza that doesn't taste like.... you know.  Katerina flies in special crusts from out of state, and keeps them separate and non-cross contaminated from the regular pizzas. I'm from Brooklyn, and very picky about pizza, but this is by far the best gluten free pizza i've had.\n\nThe \"gluten free\" pizza from that other more well known place makes the crusts on the same countertops with the regular pizza, and I always get sick afterwards. Katerina cares enough to take it seriously, and she even delivered our first order herself, after we talked on the phone about her process. Always delivered piping hot within 45 minutes. Not going anywhere else. :D", "author": "Ian B."}

You've rarely seen such a tidy little pizzeria. \n\nOnto the pizza, the main event: I was starving so I went right for the pizza with all the **meat! \n\nAnd if you love bacon, sausage, pepperoni and even sliced hot dogs, get the We Will Rock You- you'll be in heaven. It was absolutely delicious and very rich so there were plenty of leftovers. \n\nTrust me, I'm not complaining but the slice was groaning under the weight of all the pork goodness so I grabbed a fork to eat it lest I be wearing it. \n\nIt was a fine concession. \n\nThe salad was delicious with finely chopped (maybe it was shaved) broccoli on a bed of arugula, slivered apple and almonds, pancetta (pork!) and small pieces of cheese. \n\nAnd that my 10 year-old would be fighting me for the salad fork made me laugh: The salad was that good. \n\nEven at 4:30 pm, the pizzeria was starting to pop with people picking up individual slices and the delivery guy heading out with a pie.\n\nI couldn't tell if the crust wasn't as crisp as I'd prefer or it was protesting the punishing weight of pork goodness weighing it down. The question didn't affect the star rating one bit, it's a solid 5-star spot.\n\nAnd it's not just for take-out: Despite its small space, Katani has a serviceable amount of seating. \n\nIf you're walking from Golden Gate Park two blocks away or deciding you can skip those next two 21-Hayes busses going by, you can comfortably unwind with a slice & a soda.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

So tasty and definitely a place I will try again and again.

The sadness has dissipated now that I know this delicious Katani pizza is there :)  We ordered there \"Take a Chance On Me\" pizza which was awesome and I'm very excited to try more.

My boyfriend has severe gluten allergies and misses common tasty foods, like pizza.  There are places that claim to have gluten free pizza, but that's all mute and void when the dough gets cross contaminated by being created on the same table with the same tools, etc.\n\nWhen I called in, the owner Katerina picked up.  I told her about my concerns.  She is very meticulous about her gluten free pizzas.  They are made in Vegas, then frozen and shrunk wrapped to her store.  She has no tolerance for employees who don't take the \"gluten free\" part seriously.  SHE HAND DELIVERED OUR GLUTEN FREE PIZZAS TO OUR DOOR just to make sure they were done properly.  \n\nI tried her chicken wings and they are equally delicious, breaded and baked with little bits of celery and carrot for taste.  I did not use the spicy sauce as I like it mild, but all of it tastes wonderful!!!\n\nDefinitely give Katani Pizza a try, they really care about their customers and do a great job delivering delicious pizzas: gluten free and with gluten depending on your tastes! :D", "author": "Elaine H."}

It was not sitting in the oven but in the box and not in those insulated bags/purses to keep them warm. Grabbed a slice right away upon receipt and it was room tempurature and I love my pizza hot/very warm so that was the major killer of the overall experience. Sauce had close to no flavor but the excellent news is the owner states that no sugar is included this is very good. Dough tasted bland and lacked minimal salt in my opinion.

When the roommate asked me what I wanted for dinner, I figured we should keep the theme going. Decided to try Katani Pizza. We placed an order for delivery through Eat24 at 5:46pm. Our order arrived at 6:23pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Chicken Wings: 6 pcs, spicy ($7)\n*We Will Rock You Pizza: Tomato sauce, light cheese, Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, ground beef, bacon, hot dog, Thin Crust ($24 for 14\" Medium)\n*San Francisco Pizza: Pesto sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, parmesan, arugula, no almonds, Thin Crust ($15 for 9\" Personal)\n\nThe roommate loves meat pizzas, so I ordered that one for him. The pizzas are thin crust, so not super substantial if you're a big eater. It was fine with me as I prefer a thin crust, but I think the roommate would have a liked a thicker crust. The We Will Rock You pizza had plenty of meaty toppings. I wasn't sure how the hot dog would fit in, but it worked. I adore pesto, so I got San Francisco pizza. I wanted it to have more pesto flavor, but overall, it was a good pizza. The parmesan is strong, so don't order this if you want a mellow cheese. Also, I wanted more fresh arugula as I like that contrast in texture. The chicken wings were huge. Definitely a lot of meat on those bones. Taste wise, they had a little heat, but they were a little mushy on the outside.\n\nGood place if you like thin crust pizzas like me.", "author": "Elena N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-08", "description": "A true locals pizza place, on a half-block of other locals businesses.  Katani is located a block from the Panhandle, but it feels like a long way from there.  It feels like a place where flatdwellers walk over to sit at one of the 15 chairs and have a semi-quick dinner (pizza isn't a quickly made dinner, no matter where you go).\n\nTheir pizza menu is quirky.  Each combination is named after a pop song, a song that usually has nothing to do with the ingredients used but who cares about that.  Like the old Ike's Place, but Katani has a manageable number of combinations, and it's easy to pick out what you'd like, unlike the huge and unorganized menu of Ike's deli.\n\nThe Hunny and I had what I called the Queen Special  Actually \"We Will Rock You\", and I was surprised that my girl didn't start stomping her feet twice and clapping her hands once.  She made her own 9-incher with black olives and basil.  She found the basil too spicy once it kicked in;  her 10-year-old taste buds haven't grown to appreciate basil yet, I guess.  The Hunny and I were impressed with the meat-lovers pizza we had.  I especially liked the tangy salami.  Katani uses a thin crust, halfway between regular pizza and pita bread.  I'd rather have toppings than bread, so this worked great for me.\n\nI love the owner, too.  She, like my girl's church friend, is from Bulgaria, so we got to talking (actually, she did most of the talking) about Bulgarian culture, Concord, her various businesses, the difference between the Orthodox Churches (\"they're all the same\"), marriage & family.  Friendly!\n\nThere are bigger pies available in North Beach if you want to gorge yourself.  They taste great too.  Katani can hold its own against them.  I don't think you can go wrong eating at Katani Pizza regularly.  They certainly deserve the business.", "author": "Ron L."}

It literally tasted like and is as thin as a saltine cracker instead of pizza dough. This is not what I expected for a $25 pizza, which was only a medium size.\n\nBlaze at stonestown charges half the price for slightly smaller pizza.\n\n\nI'm really disappointed especially after reading the reviews.

Or if you're from ny and its been awhile since you had a good slice. This is your place. When I go. I just get cheese slices. Sure they have jazzed up slices. But to me. They do such a good job at the basic slice, i find it hard to try anything else. The business owner is very accomidating and if something isn't what you wanted, she will go to great length to make it right by you. Though I never had an issue. \nThe decorum is modest, as pizzaria should be. Super nice interior just tells me i'm gonna pay a lot of money for beer, and the pizza.. and the  pizza is going to be pretentious... and okay.\nAlso bonus. They make each slice.. fresh and to order.

The portions are huge so I got two meals out of it!\n\nReally good! The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is I prefer my pizza crust a little crispier.  Next time I order I am going to ask for it a little crispier. We also had the spaghetti and meatballs and the cheese garlic bread. Both were delicious. Can't wait to work my way through the menu. Bonus, we ordered for pick up and it was ready in 15 minutes!", "author": "Hilary M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-03", "description": "Ordered from Eat 24 after seeing strong reviews and my regular pizza joint was closed for the holidays.  Got large cornmeal crust with pepperoni and jalapeno plus garlic bread with cheese and spicy chicken wings.\n\nThe pizza had high potential...the crust was thinner than i expected as i'd ordered the regular cornmeal rather than the thin cornmeal but was tasty and well cooked and the pepperoni was very good.  The downsides were that the jalapeno was pretty much raw and the whole thing was delivered at a tepid temperature.  It was the owner that delivered it...it seemed she was short staffed due to the holidays...so perhaps she was trying to do lots of orders in one run but the pizza definitely did not benefit from being less than fresh and hot from the oven.\n\nThe garlic bread was meh.  A french roll, split, garlic and cheese added and toasted a little...bit it had no character.  It was just filler...like home made when you don't have time to do it well.\n\nThe chicken wings also suffered from being delivered at a tepid temperature.  Any fry crisp they had was soggy and they were definitely not spicy.\n\nI really wanted to like this place and the pizza was solid enough that I'll probably give then another go...they just need to speed up their store-to-house delivery time to ensure the pizza arrives in top notch condition and they need to up their garlic bread game considerably.", "author": "Adam S."}

Almost 50 bucks, including tip...avoid this place.\nNever again.", "author": "S. M."}

The owner is extremely nice, funny and the place has a very friendly ambience. I tried the meat lasagna while I was there and it was unbelievable!!!! Very generous portions and the fresh and quality ingredients they use makes the lasagna fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised that they deliver in my neighborhood in the Marina as well. My friends and I have found our new place for delivery for all the football and Warrior games. Great place to watch games. I love to go eat there as I felt so welcome the first time I went and it's always entertaining. Recommend \"Take a chance on me\" for vegetarians with potatoes, zucchini, garlic. It was savory and light at the same time! Another thing from the menu I can recommend is their salads. House loaded salad is what I usually get.", "author": "Peter E."}

Let's start off with just ordering process I was ordering for a party of about 15 people when I was graded on the phone it was a very professional easy-going individual who would obviously knew what they were talking about I had asked for some recommendations on what type of Pizzas they would recommend so that everyone can have a pizza of their liking.it was very appealing to me that these are just your ordinary pepperoni and combination pizzas. They came up with creative and funny names that really make the ordering process a little bit different and fun I was able to order five pizzas all with different varieties for all different people they had told me that the pizza would be delivered within 30 to 45 minutes. Sure enough 35 minutes later a driver had showed up with the pizzas. They were easy-going and willing to bring the pizza all the way inside to where I needed it. And let's just say how important it is that the pizza was still warm when I got it. I had a chance to try all five of the different pizzas and I have to say the taste was amazing definitely my new go to pizza!", "author": "Robert L."}
