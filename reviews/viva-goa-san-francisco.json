He advised they close from 3-5 to get ready for dinner service. No problem, we were happy they served us so close to 3.   They brought fresh, hot naan and drinks.  Although they were technically \"closed\" at that point, We never felt rushed and the food was delicious. Here's where it gets weird...\n\nThis guy comes in (at least 3:15at this point), the waiter politely tells the customer that they are closed between three and five. The customer sits down at the table and demands to be served. He shouts something like \"All these other people are eating!\"  He is advised the few people left were here before 3pm and now the buffet is closed.  The guy is totally loud and belligerent demanding water and to be served. He takes out his phone and starts recording the whole event as if they were discriminating against him for some reason. He was ridiculous.  \n\nDude. You missed lunch, accept it an move on. Sheesh. \n\nAnyway, back in the land of sanity, the waiter and manager remained calm and professional. Eventually the guy left.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-27", "description": "In my travels and sojourn through Asia, I have become rather familiar with the varying cuisines. In India, for instance, there was a distinct difference between Indian cuisine and Goan cuisine. The latter cuisine, it appears, took the Indian cuisine a step further by adding unique hand ground spices, coconut vinegar and coconut milk (thanks to the Portuguese influence) resulting in an altogether original cuisine.\n\nViva Goa restaurant, having opted for that name, ought to have focussed wholly on providing traditional Goan dishes instead of conflicting the menu with Indian dishes. There are plentiful Indian restaurants which are more qualified in serving savory Indian specialty dishes to their customers. \n\nAnother comment: Don't ever expect to savor the same mouth watering dish created in the country of origin and replicated elsewhere. It doesn't work that way. Therefore, expect the expected disappointment. If you crave for true Goan dishes, book a flight to Goa.\n\nAdditionally, we live in an age where demand exceeds natural production. If some reviewers are bitter about the curries served here that appear to have no coconut milk incorprated, guess what? Who in this day and age has the time to grate a coconut and extract the milk to favor you with a curry made with authentic coconut milk? As for the ready made coconut milk which comes in cans, do the math. Most of the canned coconut milk comes from Thailand, and these too by the millions. How many coconut trees are there in Thailand to feed the world's demand for coconut milk? The result? You guessed it: synthetic coconut milk which make most curries at restaurants taste like they were not made with coconut milk.", "author": "D M."}

This place gets close but doesn't quite hit the mark. The CTM sauce was superb--lighter color, good taste and texture, and creaminess--not too sweet, not too spicy. Just right. The chicken itself however wasn't tender enough and didn't hit the spot the way I had hoped.  Also, they could work on improving their rice and naan. The former wasn't a good batch (not fluffy enough) and the bread didn't taste fresh out of the oven and was too thin. \n\nStill, this is a solid option to satisfy that CTM craving.

We placed the order at 11:44am and it arrived at 12:36pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Vegetable Samosas: Potatoes and green peas with mixed Indian spices and wrapped in a golden crispy pastry ($5)\n*Butter Chicken: Tandoori chicken cooked with a blended mild tomato base cream sauce, Very Spicy ($11.99)\n*Chicken Tikka Masala: Oven roasted chicken breast cooked with tomato and onion base cream sauce, Very Spicy ($11.99)\n*Onion Naan: Naan stuffed with onion and herbs ($3.49)\n*Garlic Naan: Naan topped with chopped garlic ($3.49) x2\n\nI adored the curries. They were both rich and creamy with a good amount of spice. I liked the tikka masala more than the butter chicken, but that's more of a flavor preference on my part. I liked the creaminess and heat of it more. The garlic naan was a great tool to sop up the curry. Soft, chewy and with great garlic flavor. The roomie always orders onion naan and seemed to enjoy this. I'd recommend staying away from the samosas. They were overly hard and salty. They resisted and crumbled when I tried to break them in half. Not good at all.\n\nOverall, good chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. Just stay away from the samosas. So bad!", "author": "Elena N."}

This restaurant is the reason I go there, to try the authentic Goan spices!  I'm glad walk-ins are acceptable, so I can find a table just for me.  I got a free glass of water and I first ordered the Indian Tea (Chai with milk).  One sip of Chai in a ceramic cup, bold but not spicy, and it's good for me without adding sugar.\n\nThe atmosphere isn't bad at all with those dim lights everywhere.  The smell of various kinds of spices didn't just come from their plates, the lunch buffet area is where all the spices come from.  But I came here to try the best dish in the restaurant.  Thus, I savor the lunch buffet on my next future visit.  I was getting my waiter's attention so I ordered the following: Vegetable Caldin, Aloo Paratha, and Raita.  Oh, and I chose the Basmati Rice.  It's nice to talk to other patrons sitting in their respective tables, even while waiting for the food.  I asked one of the three men from my right side, saying \"how's your food?\".  Then he said \"it taste good\".  Many people enjoy their food straight from the lunch buffet while talking.  Me, I enjoyed observing most of the people here.  After waiting for twenty minutes, my food has arrived, and almost filled my whole table.  One of the three men I talked to said I'm a \"happy camper\".  Great!  Time for my feast.\n\nA bread basket of Aloo Paratha looked fried to the deep crisp.  The first piece of naan bread tasted crispy on the outside with rich chunky potatoes on the inside.  Tasted so good with and without the Goan spices, I couldn't stop wolfing all the pieces, until I came to the point of slowing down.\n\nThen I got to the Vegetable Caldin.  I wasn't fooled by its small size.  I knew there's more vegetables on the bottom with green herbs on the top.  And the yellow part that dominate the entire bowl, could be squash or turmeric with hints of coconut water.  With cumin, coriander, and the Goan spices, made a very warm bowl altogether.\n\nI know I couldn't easily finished the Basmati Rice.  I only finished some of its lengthy whites and all the green peas.  Raita was the last one I finished.  Taste like yogurt dip with strips of carrots and cucumbers.  Just a few spoonful sips, and it eased my digestion.\n\nI managed to finish most of the meal.  No homemade ice cream for me.  I was all good.  The food was good too.

Plus at $8.99 on weekdays, it's an absolute lunchtime steal.  \n\nSeafood is an integral part of Goan cuisine and at this buffet, you get some Goan fish curry to soak up that fluffy basmati rice. The curry is pretty light but I appreciate that it's a dish not typically found in other Indian buffets. Vegetarians will also appreciate that this buffet has a wide spread of vegetarian dishes ranging from a mixed vegetable vindaloo to samosas to sag paneer and lots more. I especially love the Goan salad. It's bright with a nice mix of pickled veggies and chickpeas - very refreshing counterpoint to the various curries. As with all other Indian buffets, expect the usual chicken tandoori and chicken tikka masala. All in all, a hearty and fulfilling meal with mild spices for those dreary SF afternoons. \n\nIt's a little dark inside and the d\u00e9cor is a little  dated but service is attentive especially when it comes to keeping your water glass full.

I'm so glad we took the chance, because Viva Goa was simply delicious!  \n\nThey have lots of northern-Indian/Punjabi style favorites, so you can order good ol' standbys if you want (paneer, korma, tiki masala, etc.), We had the navratan korma, which was our \"just in case\" dish, and it was REALLY wonderful-- fresh, well spiced, very delicious.  But I'd highly recommend you try the Goa regional specialties (they have a little tree logo next to them), which are super well-flavored and really delicious.  We had the vegetarian caldin, which was light and tangy, while still rich in flavor/style.  Wonderful!  Also had their samosas, which were *very* flavorful (there are a shocking number of Indian restaurants who serve crap samosas-- why God, why?!?!).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-21", "description": "For some reason, all my closest Indian friends are South Indian. Through our foodie adventures, I have developed quite an obsession with the cuisines of this region. When I discovered the existence of Viva Goa, I was determined to make the several-mile trek up to the Marina because it had been ages since I'd had Goan food (and I've gotten kind of sick of the same old Westernized North Indian dishes).\n\nMy friend and I came here for lunch. She opted for the lunch buffet, but I decided to go a la carte because the buffet only had 2 Goan dishes (both of which weren't terribly exciting) and I wanted something authentically and uniquely Goan that I wouldn't be able to find at other Indian restaurants. \n\nAfter some consultation with the very friendly Goan owner, I chose the Prawn Xacutti. If you only have room in your brain to remember one Goan dish, let it be Xacutti, the definitive curry of Goa. It differs from other curries by having poppy seeds as part of its flavoring. I chose the prawn version because Goa, which is right on the coast, is famous for its wide variety of seafood dishes (particularly fish and shellfish). The xacutti was thick and tasty, with a complex multi-layered variety of spices, and the prawns were large, succulent and perfectly cooked. Combined with a generous portion of basmati rice and freshly baked, piping hot naan, and this meal could have easily fed two. \n\nI also tried some of my friend's Goan Fish Curry (one of the two Goan dishes at the buffet). The fish (some kind of white fish) was very tender, reminiscent of the way Chinese people cook fish, but the curry was rather watery and the flavors seemed diluted. For dessert, my friend and I split the Bebinca, a traditional Goan dessert made with flour, sugar, ghee and coconut milk (which gives it most of its flavor). Bebinca reminds me a lot of Chinese Thousand-Layered Cake, my favorite dim sum sweet. Both desserts are traditionally baked in layers. Viva Goa's Bebinca was very thick, with an almost paste-like consistency, and had the delicious flavor of coconut mixed with caramel. It was served with whipped cream. We both really liked it, but couldn't finish more than half because it was so rich.\n\nThere are no shortage of great restaurants in the Marina, but if you're looking for something off the beaten path, might I suggest Viva Goa?", "author": "Josephine L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-25", "description": "Viva Goa is a good Indian restaurant that could use the services of a restaurant consultant. What I like about this place is that you feel kind of like you're sitting in a family living room. The service is friendly and unpolished, and you can enjoy your meal without worrying about putting your elbows on the table. The food is above average Indian cuisine, with yummy chicken tikka masala, naan, jasmine rice, and other staples.\n\nThe reason I take off one star is because of the delivery procedure. Since this is one of the few restaurants that delivers to my house, I order from them a lot, sometimes twice in a week. I've been doing that for months, and yet each time the guy who takes orders picks up the phone, it's as if I'm a brand new person he's never met before. I literally order the same thing every time and yet he still brings me through the same 6 scripted questions (I can recite them) and then makes me spell my name and address. Often he will misspell the name of my street (\"Pilbert Street?\"), which, aside from the fact that I've spelled it for him 80 times, is located 2 blocks away from his restaurant. Sometimes I feel like shouting into the phone \"Dear God, man!  Where has your memory gone?? Lay off the ganja pipe for a while!\"\n\nViva Goa: please get a computer. It's 2014. They have some great technology out now.\n\nThis restaurant needs to take a page out of Escape from New York Pizza's book. When I call, their caller ID links me to my address. They ask me what I want, confirm my address, and I am literally off the phone within 30 seconds.", "author": "Evan B."}

My eyeballs nearly popped out when I saw sorportel on the menu!  Delicious chicken xacuti, pork vindaloo, and the seafood platter are all winners in my book.\n\nFor the uninitiated,\n\nPut down that naan and rogan josh.  Set aside the daals, the saag paneer.  For gods sake, stop eating that samosa.  Goa is known for its seafood, its coconut-based dishes, its spicy cuisine, so take full advantage of these strengths.  Help yourselves to the Goenchim Sungttam (a prawn appetizer) or the chicken lollipops.  If you're down with heat, order up the pork vindaloo, otherwise the Chicken Xacuti can serve as a flavor-bomb alternative.  I personally haven't had the Rechado Pomfret Fish or the Chicken Cafreal here, but those are both super super good if done well, as is the sorportel.\n\nI'll be back, fo sho.

Even better with fresh vegetable pakoras! Amazing start to the meal.\n\nFor the main course, we decided to stick with Goan specialties, being in a Goan restaurant. We ordered the fish curry and the chicken xacuti, accompanied with plain naan. The fish curry was slightly bland for my taste and the curry element slightly thinned-out and translucent. I'm not sure if that is the intended preparation, but it definitely could've used a tad bit more masala. Overall though, the fish was fresh and didn't leave an aftertaste. The chicken xacuti was plenty flavorful. Similar to a standard Indian chicken curry, it included a few nontraditional spices.\n\nOverall, a nice place to dine and friendly customer service.

Crunch crispy goodness, with a hint of spice. \n\nWe also ordered regular nan and rice - to go with our yummy chicken vindaloo! The sauce was a bit more saucey (versus being thicker) but it was still packed with a lot of spices. The dish was full of a lot of flavor! Just a bit more spicy and it would've been perfect. The tandoori chicken was good too, it was cooked in an oven - but the chicken was similar to BBQ chicken.

I really like most things on the menu, but the main issue here is the location. When Chestnut and Union are only a couple blocks away, it is so difficult to want to go to Lombard. There is something nice about getting out of dinner and walking on a nice street, and Lombard--let's face it, it literally *is* highway 101 (look at a map if you don't believe me).

I am from Mangalore, which is an Indian city not too far from Goa, and both these places have a LOT of common elements in their cuisines. I was extremely happy to find this place reviewed so highly on Yelp! and convinced my fiance to take me there when I was visiting last weekend. We tried the following dishes from their menu:\n\nFish cutlets - These were decent; there were 2 big patty portions coated with semolina (rava) which gave them that extra crunch. I wish they served them with some other condiment than plain old tomato ketchup!\n\nPrawn Xacuti with rice - My Goan friend in Chicago made chicken xacuti the other day and it was SOOOO GOOD, I can almost smell and taste the curry in my head!! Unfortunately, Viva Goa's offering was a terrible let down. The xacuti masala didn't seem fresh at all. The dish felt like it was just stored away in the freezer, taken out, reheated and served to us.\n\nSeafood Biryani - The rice grains were well cooked and long. I think the seafood consisted of calamari, scallops and crab meat (or was it fish? I don't remember). This dish was passable but nothing to brag about.\n\nPork Vindaloo - This one fared the worst! We ordered this after making sure that there were no big pieces of pork fat in the gravy. The gravy looked like something you'd get at a Chinese restaurant - red, soupy, thick. It tasted horrid and I felt like there was tomato ketchup mixed in it. The Goan \"vindaloo\" is very similar to the Mangalorean \"indaad\". This dish did not come anywhere close to what I have been eating all this while in India.\n\nBebinca - My favorite Goan sweet of all times! I had to have this for dessert. What they served us was 4 decent sized pieces. The bebinca was a bit dense but this could probably be because it was not freshly made (the cooking process is quite long and tedious) and was stored in the refrigerator. I still enjoyed the dish!\n\nAll in all, this experience was a disappointment! I will have to rely on my friend to satisfy my Goan food cravings until my next trip back home :) Her mum's prawn balchao and mole are A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!", "author": "Raquel D."}

On average I get dinner delivered from Viva Goa once every week and a half or so.  Before discovering Viva Goa, Indian food did not happen for me very often, as there is a serious shortage of decent indian spots in this part of town.  Needless to say, I have turned into a one-woman PR machine for this place, telling everyone who will listen to go there because i want to make sure they stay in business to feed my addiction.\n\nAdmittedly, my experience with the menu is limited because I am having a hard time branching away from the Chicken Tikka Masala because it is amazing!  (and just spicy enough to make me sweat a little when prepared \"medium\").  But why fix it if it aint broken, right?  I recently traded in the vegetable biryani for the Aloo Gobhi in an attempt to cut down on the rice (although potato and cauliflower instead is not much of a carb cut).  The Aloo Gobhi- although i am sure I am pronouncing it wrong, is a great addition to my dinner routine.

The Biryani was a mountain for me, huge amounts of rice and it was just wonderful, we shared each other's food and the curry was beautifully thick and creamy with the right amount of spices, and the lamb/meat was spiced and cooked extremely well.\n\nThe service is good; caring people, I suppose. Asked if the food is good and how everything is, just like any waiter would. Nothing bad about them, just good people.\n\nThe place is not bad, only been there twice and every time we get there there's always a place for us to sit at, just the three of us.

So I took out my new phone and typed in Indian food on Yelp and this was one of the first places to come up  on the list.\n\nSo we ordered the Goan Chicken Masala and the Chicken Tikka Masala with some rice and it was simply amazing. The taste on both of these dishes were out of this world, especially the Chicken Tikka Masala. This particular dish is the one I always get at Indian restaurants as a comparison piece to see how it stacks up to the competition. And let's just say this was one of the best ones I've ever had. I can't wait to go back again and try some of their other specialty dishes.\n\nLet's go go goa, to Viva Goa!!!", "author": "Gajan K."}

We used to vacation in Goa as children so I took my wife there as a Stewart's date night.  I had the mulgatawni soup it was very very good warming, delicious. For my entree i had the pork vindaloo with rice. This was also very good with lots of flavor of sweetness, cardamon and cloves very southern Indian. I tried also the salted lassi which was a drink I had not tasted since living in India as a punka walla. Then my wife had the sizzling chicken tika with a massala sauce on the side. It was spiced subtlety and dryer then the normal gee coated rubbish other \"authentic\" places serve. We had the mango kulfi and bebinca for desert. The bebinca takes forever to make so there is no Indian restaurant that I know of that has it on the menu. It is really delicious with lots of coconut and sugar as i remember it as a child.\n\nThey have a buffet during the day that changes every day.

Viva Goa had been on our list for a while so I was very excited to finally try Goan food here!\n\nI quite enjoyed the large crispy chip that we were given. It is served with two sauces, one green and one red. The red sauce is sort of fruity and interesting but I much preferred the green, spicy one. \n\nWe asked our server for an appetizer recommendation. He suggested either the chicken lollipops or the shrimp. We decided to get the shrimp because I was a little wary of the \"Szechuan sauce\" that the chicken lollipops are served with. Sounds really cute though, I mean, lollipops? Maybe next time. The shrimp was good. They're hot, not cold.\n\nFor our entrees, we got the Fish Curry and the Lamb Xacuti. Also an order of rice and an order of naan. Loved the fish curry! Medium is the perfect amount of spicy and the curry complemented the fish very well. My favorite thing about the fish (aside from the wonderful taste) was the heat retention in the center of each piece of fish. Mmm...\n\nThe lamb xacuti was good as well! The lamb is cooked well and the sauce is not too overwhelming with lamb flavor. Just right. I really enjoyed the two dishes that we got because they were quite different and gave us a great dining experience. \n\nGlad that Viva Goa did not disappoint and I definitely want to come back to try more items on the menu!", "author": "Lydia W."}

I was hesitant when i first entered, since the outside of the place, and actually even the inside were very simple. But this rating is based entirely on the food not the appearance.\n\nI wish i could remember the name of the dishes that we had, but one that i could remember was Chicken 65, this was just amazing! Enough said.\nThe other dish that I couldn't believe was even better than the Chicken 65 was this beef with potatoes spices and CINNAMON! Yes that is right cinnamon, and not just a hint of cinnamon like i expected, but rather enough that you can taste and smell it within the bounty of other flavors that explode all over your tongue as you take your first bite. Oh also this place does not mess around with the level of spicy. If you ask for spicy you get spicy! I mentioned to the server, \"Extra spicy\" since i'm used to being at places that laugh at you when you ask for spicy food (Often rightfully so). Well i can say... this was one spicy dish, but not too spicy that it wasn't pure deliciousness.\n\nI am happy to add to the many 5 star reviews of this place. Our entire meal was less than $30 for 2 people with one large beer (enough for 2), and it was one of the best dining experiences i have had in the Marina.\n\nThe ONLY negative feedback that i have is that it took a while for the check to come once our meal was complete, and when it did arrive i was in the restroom.

And depending where you are on the learning curve, it arguably does not have anything *really* great.  As with the clientele, lots of restaurants are good (yes, that includes Mamacitas), reasonably healthy, fair-to-over-priced.\n\nThat said, I lived in the Marina for 5 years craving easy Indian.  My laziest alternative was in Pac Heights and mediocre at best.  When Viva Goa moved into the old Tibetan spot on Lombard, I was not expecting much - but I could smell their concoctions percolating through the neighborhood.\n\nBecause of my earlier-stated laziness, I checked out Yelp and saw positive reviews in the first week despite the awkward location.  Knowing nothing about Goan food, I decided to check it out and was amazed how accurate the reviews were - great flavor, even tender fish curry.  I NEVER eat fish in the buffets, much less in curry.  Overall the buffet is reasonably small, but very well rounded with the requisite chicken dishes, some good veggie and always something interesting like fish, lamb or goat.  Yeah baby - goat!\n\nTo wrap up, these guys do a great job for Marina and Pac Heights.  Good flavors and some sort of Goan influence, that I hear is unique.  Besides being tasty and cheap - the most important thing is these guys are super nice and hospitable.  Go get your fix and blow off the Grove or the Shitty Pig.", "author": "DaPlayer A."}

We were assured it was \"on its way\" and would \"be there shortly\".  Another 40 minutes went by, & still no food - finally we called back, only to have my name & number asked over and over (literally 5 times in a row).

Finally they informed me that no order had ever been received - despite the fact that they had assured us 40 minutes prior that it was \"on its way\".

But we were swayed by the big Daily Lunch Buffet sign out of the doorway...dang...$8.99....sigh...such a buffet whore.\n\nFirst thing we tried was the chicken tandoori (I know that it's got to be more tender and juicy right out of the kitchen instead of sitting on burner for hours), which turned out to be too dry. The vegetable samosas were filled with carrots and potatoes...I liked it even better with their mango chutney sauce poured all over (I'm all about the sweet and savory). The naan was excellent. Very hot and crispy, almost like a cracker! The Goan Chicken Masala had excellent flavors and the chicken was really tender. \nThe Goan Goat Masala had a gamey flavor but then most goat dishes do.\n\nMy favorite is the vegetarian dish Channa Masala (Garbanzo cooked with onion, tomato, fresh herbs & spices)..all Sandy said was, \"it has peas and tofu in it. How good could it be?\"  Hello? It was hella good...the sauce with naan made it wayyy worth the trip back again for seconds.\n\nFor dessert, we grabbed the sweet cantaloupes, and I had the rice pudding which had real rice in it...I was thinking of the creamy milk based mushy type but the rice actually was cooked and sitting in minty herbal flavorings...slightly sweet.  I tried the Gulab Jamun (milky fried balls soaked in flavored syrup), they were not as sweet as I thought and really delicious.\n\nIf you're here, definitely get an order of Mango Lassi. Both Sandy M and I agree Viva made the best one we've ever had...so thick with mangos and chilled perfectly.\n\nI think I'll come back here next time and do a la carte. That way I can defintely get the taste of flavors fresh from their kitchens.", "author": "Pauline L."}

I had chosen the place because we had eaten some amazing paneer tandoori in Vancouver and had been searching for another restaurant that served it. Viva Goa was the first one we found, and I sort of wish we hadn't, the tandoori was beyond dry and tasteless.\n\nThere's also something to be said about conscientious waiters, if when the two of us order two rices, and you don't mention that one order of rice is generally portioned for 3 people, it's irritating. Not because I wasted a 1.99 on rice, but because it went straight into the trash untouched.\n\nAnyway, when it was all said in done, dinner took way too long, the food was dry and salty.

The waiters were downright rude to us, making snide comments, no smile on their faces..nothing. We had to keep signaling them to come to our table to take our order. One of the waiters, Sam, was great though..", "author": "Ro D."}

I loved the food. We had the Chicken Xacuti and Lamb Masala with some garlic naan. It was so good ~ even with my tummy trying to fight the spice I kept eating.\n\nEven writing this review makes me hungry. Marina/Cow-Hollow - it can be hard to find some place that has great prices and good and Viva Goa seems to combine them all. It was quiet and much like the last reviewer, I really liked that it was quiet, but the staff was very nice and the food was really yummy so they deserved to be Yelp'd.", "author": "rei a."}

Yes that good. My boyf is Sinhalese and knows his Indian food and even he was excited about the food we received here.\n\nFirst its a quiet little place with nice ambiance. Staff were all very attentive and courteous.\n\nKeep in mind both my boyf and I love spicy so it was great to have a place that truly made things spicy  when asked to and not just what they think we can handle. I am very very fair but grew up eating jalapenos from the vine practically. But most people take one look at me and figure there is no way I can out spice my boyf but I do.\n\nWe started with the Goan Mussels cooked to perfection! Even tho spicy you could still taste the sweetness of the mussels. We also tried the Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken 65, Goan Seafood Biryani, and garlic naan (there was something else in there too but I just cant remember it). All of it very good. But the biggest compliment comes from my boyf on the Biryani. He has yet to find in over a year in CA a Biryani that he would claim as good and this one he says is great.\n\nIf we are ever in San Fran you can be sure we will be back here again.", "author": "Leslie B."}

Even if some of them are roach fests (how do they keep getting away with it?!) there are enough decent ones to mostly satisfy even this British curry connoisseur.  Variety, though, is not their strong point, most of them offering a me-too menu selection.  Thankfully, Viva Goa is willing to go south on them all.\n\nMixed in with usual favourites like masalas and vindaloos (which are worth seeking out themselves) you'll find unique Goan treats like the Chicken 65 (the closest curry in the US to my favourite chicken pathia), Lamb Xacuti and Vegetable Caldin.  This place might even be good enough to unseat my current favourite, downtown's Mehfil Indian.", "author": "Stew M."}

We came to this place with one thing in mind that this is the only goan cuisine around bay area. I did not really care about all the other 100 things they have that you get in any other Indian restaurant, rather I went there by keeping \"Xacuti\", \"Vindaloo\" in mind because these 2 things are Goa regional specialty. Chicken Xacuti 4 stars out of 5 , really really good, very flavorful. I love it. Vindaloo I would say 3 out of 5 , not bad but not too good either. Apart from these things we ordered usual things on the menu, they were average. In Appetizers Chicken Lolipop was pretty decent . Price wise 6 curries, 10  naans, couple of beers, couple of sodas came out to be $150 with tax + tip.\n\nI would recommend this place to people who are craving for some Maharastra Coastal / Good spicy food specially \"Xacuti\".\n\nyes they offered us free desert, orange ice cream very creatively prepared. 5 stars out of 5.", "author": "Rajesh S."}

Goan food is unique and distinguishes itself from the rest of the Indian cuisine by drawing influences from Portuguese - who colonized Goa for ~450 years -  while not losing its traditional Indian character,  'Viva Goa' fills the gap by presenting a decent Goan menu along with the standard Indian fare. \n\nOperated by 2 very friendly entrepreneurs, Viva Goa is a small and cozy restaurant with an ambiance not too heavy on your eyes. On our request, they even went out of their way to make a 'rava' (semolina) fried prawns. If you are curious, check out the Goan landscape wall hangings, listen to the Goan music while you devour the Goan Cafreal, Kalind, Vindaloo and the irresistible Xacuti. Enjoy with a chilled Indian beer and end with a slice of Bebinca. All at prices that won't hurt your wallet.\n\nI happened to spot it on the very second day after they opened, while returning from Napa and I'm glad I did.

We didn't order an incredible amount of food, but what we chose was perfect for two. Basmati rice for one (it's enough for two), Roti (something like whole wheat Naan?), Goan Chicken Masala, Vegetable Caldin, and Baigan Bhartha.  The Chicken Masala dish was by far the best, but the vegetable dishes did not disappoint either. Had a great little meal mixing them together with the rice, trying different combos of the three entrees, and of course wrapping it all up with Roti!

Hard to beat that, especially in this neighborhood! Also went for dinner Saturday night around 8 and the place was about half full. I love that it never seems to get packed and it's quiet, the crowd is nothing like the people walking down Chestnut just one block away (more mature), and the servers are very polite. While we waited for our plates to come, our server brought us papadums and dip on the house! We had the \"Chicken Xacuti\" and the \"Beef Assado\" with garlic naan and plain basmati rice. The chicken dish is authetic of Goa and was tasty and saucy, not very different in taste from a curry. The beef dish is Portuguese, without any Indian influences, and was not good. It featured sauteed sliced beef with bland over-steamed sliced onions, green bell pepper, and zucchini and a side of rice. The dish lacked flavor and the beef was a bit tough. The naan was too thin; it didn't have enough doughiness to soak up sauce. Mango lassi was delicious and I think uniquely in that you could taste the tang of the yogurt. Chai is not free here like at casual Indian restaurants. Since this is a regionally different Indian restaurant, they also feature a couple of pork dishes. Also of note, all meats are boneless!

We used to take in one Indian food meal per trip near North Beach and really liked it there.  Then, somehow last year, I learned about Viva Goa.  The fact that is was Indian food from a different region than we were accustomed to, I convinced my husband to try something new.  It was so good last year that we came back this year and found it to be even better.  It helped that it was less crowded (we got there earlier) so had time to chat with the waiter (who is from Goa) about our choices.  The chicken vindaloo was the best we've ever had!  We also had the vegetable xiachu (not sure it's spelled correctly) and a Goan lamb dish.  Kudos all around but especially the chicken vindaloo (which incidentally originated in Goa and was taken up and dumbed down by other regions i.e. Punjab).  The waiter brought us a complimentary dessert, but we were too stuffed to enjoy it.  The prices were reasonable and we had enough to take home for another meal.  The ambiance was nice and I got a big glass of Kendall Jackson for $8, which is far cheaper than I've seen at other restaurants.  All in all, an enjoyable experience.

There's a fish curry where the fish is tender and flavorful (not dry like I've had at buffets in Vegas where you know the fish has been overcooked sitting under the head lamp). They do change their buffet items so you get a surprise each time but you can expect the tandoori chicken, which has always been super moist and lightly seasoned.
