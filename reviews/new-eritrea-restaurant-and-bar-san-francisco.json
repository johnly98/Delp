The meat combo had one lamb, one beef and one chicken. \n\nEverything was really good, I didn't even have a favorite! We also got a side of the cheese and yogurt.

The space was pretty big, but the best part was the back of the restaurant where they had a sun roof. Since it was a sunny day, the lighting was so nice :) Initially, there were a number of fruit flies where we sat, and so we asked to be moved as the flies just didn't seem to want to go away from us. \n\nThe food was so-so. We split a meat combo of chicken, lamb, and beef. It wasn't tender at all, so wasn't too tasty. But I did enjoy the vegetarian combo we added, which was tumtumo, hamli, and alicha. Tumtumo is made up of lentil beans pur\u00e9ed ,& simmered with Eritrean spices, onions & herbs. The hamli is made up of collard green and spinach, and the alicha has seasoned mixture of potatoes, carrots, cabbage, garlic and ginger. I really enjoyed the hamli and alicha! The portions weren't super big, so we ordered another dish :P what can we say..we were hungry haha. We added the kilwa, which is tender beef saut\u00e9ed in butter with tomatoes, onions, garlic Eritrean spices. This dish was much better than the meat combo.\n\nThe service was also really great! Our server was quick to move us because of the fruit flies, and super kind. Overall, great service, but I think there's better Ethiopian restaurants in the city of SF I would rather try next time.", "author": "Jackie C."}

I'm usually pretty tired after a long work day and the last thing I need is someone catching me lookin' drained. My growling stomach got the best of me and I decided to take a seat and grub anyway. \n\nWhen you enter, it's a bit tricky. I must've stood at the door searching for the hostess podium for a good few seconds until I realized that it was actually past the long bar, about halfway into the restaurant. I was then quickly greeted and seated to a cozy little nook. \n\nMy order:\n\nMeat Combination - Zigni Beef simmered in red sauce with authentic Eritrean spices, Zebhi Dorho Chicken Drumstick marinated and simmered in onions, tomatoes, clarified butter, and red pepper sauce, and also Alicha Begee Lamb cooked in mild tumeric sauce with onions and garlic. Coupled with a side salad and injera, OMG, this dish was incredible. So flavorful and comforting. \n\nNew Eritrean Special - Tenderized boneless chicken mixed with mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, garlic, and spices. This was probably my favorite of the night. Delicious!\n\nStuffed Jalape\u00f1os - No no, not like the ones at Jack in the Box, but even better IMHO. Loaded with tomatoes, onions, and a bit of olive oil, these unassuming jalape\u00f1o bites elevated my overall dish experience to the max. Fresh and crunchy and not at all as spicy as you would think; then again I do enjoy spicy. They do a good job cleaning out the seeds and membrane to avoid steam coming out of your ears. \n\nService is incredibly friendly and helpful. I also like how they set the whole bottle of water at your table so you can fill up your glass as needed. I drink tons of water, so this was perfect. \n\nGreat casual spot!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-15", "description": "My friends and I hadn't been planning to eat here, but we're so glad we did! \n\nFirst, I need to establish that this was the first time I've actually HAD Ethiopian food. In fact, in our group of three at the time, only one person has tried any before. So us knowing how to do anything at all during our time there is mostly thanks to her. But whether or not this is a new culinary experience for you, it's a relaxed, low-key place to eat and rest after a busy day.\n\nNew Eritrea Restaurant and Bar is located in the Sunset District, which is frankly where all the TRULY mouthwatering Chinese restaurants are located (seriously, look up Chinese restaurants with \"Outer Sunset, San Francisco, CA\" inputted into Yelp's location bar). But it's not just Chinese cuisine either and New Eritrea proves that. Originally, we had been trying to get into San Tung down the street. But it was the weekend and in the middle of dinner rush, so that wasn't happening. We wandered up and down Irving Street, looking for a place to eat, but the other two places we stopped by also had a very long wait period. New Eritrea was our fourth choice and the first one where we could immediately be seated.\n\nThis is a lovely spot to eat with a lot of options if you are (or with people who are) vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, lactose-intolerant, or are adherent to Muslim or Jewish dietary restrictions. Half of the menu was vegetarian/vegan, with even the meat dishes being vegetable-heavy, and there was no pork dishes. Additionally, the sourdough injera bread was made with teff flour and was great for the friend that was avoiding gluten. \n\nWhen we asked our waitress, she talked about how New Eritrea serves Eritrea food, which is a mix of dishes and flavors from all the surrounding areas/countries around the state of Eritrea in northeast Africa. The most prominent influence, of course, being Ethiopian food. From the way it was explained, the melting pot and blend of cuisines in this manner kinda reminds of the way Singaporean fare came about. We ended up ordering a vegetarian combo platter (though none of us were actually vegetarian), and we all enjoyed it. I was pretty full from eating my own injera as well the injera that was being used as a plate for the combo and splitting one of my friend's leftover bread with the other friend. She ended up still being hungry and ordered more. The injera itself was a treat, as I enjoyed the slight tang of sourness and how it played with the flavors of the different parts of the vegetable combo. Eating with it kinda reminds me of dumpling making, where you have to use the dumpling skin to scoop out the filling while being careful not to squeeze while doing so.\n\nThe reservation system on their website is straightforward and easy to use. Additionally, they deliver to the inner and central Sunset District, the inner and central Richmond District, Cole Valley, Haigh-Ashbury, North Panhandle, and Laurel Heights. Inside, it's a bit worn, but it's clean and the setting is decorated and can flex between casual and semi-formal. Overall, I felt like it actually added to the low-key, relaxed charm. It's good for large parties of most kinds and I saw such a party while we were there. Their full bar wasn't really occupied at the time, but I'm sure it can accommodate if you're looking for a much more casual get-together.\n\nParking is...challenging along Irving Street. If you're not taking public transportation, you're gonna have to try the surrounding street parking. If you can and you're lucky, try to grab one of the spots along Irving Street. If THAT doesn't work, be sure to check the street parking on the roads running adjacent to Irving (ex. 9th, 10th, 11th, etc.). My friends and I had parked in the Andronico's Community Market parking lot (turn from Irving onto Funston Ave, it'll be to your left. Turn from Irving onto 14th Ave, it'll be on your right). It's technically only for Andronico's customers only, and we did end up buying some groceries and midnight snacks from them before leaving.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time trying something new and it was pretty delicious! That, and we were all pretty tired after a day Muir Parks and San Francisco exploring. Be aware that they're only open for dinner and are closed on Mondays. So if you're in the area during the dinner rush and don't want to deal with the long wait time you'll face with many of the Sunset District's restaurants, New Eritrea is definitely an option if you're looking for an accommodating, relaxed place for a satisfying, sit-down meal.", "author": "Christine L."}

They became yelpers after they were introduced to Ethiopian food.  Well, because of that episode, it made me want to try Ethiopian food, so the search begins.   I first had Ethiopian food in Seattle and it drove me crazy when i came back. And so begins my search for Ethiopian food in the Bay Area and that's how I found this place. \n\nI've been here a few times already, and i love it here.  You can get a platter for the right size of your party, and makes it perfect for sharing.   The vegetarian option is my favorite, more than the meat option.   The Injera bread is usually a little bit too sour for me, i wished it was less sour. They will give your more bread if you need more to pick up your food with. I love their honey wine, and it's best to get the whole bottle as oppose to a glass. The service is always great and i will continue coming back.

Try to make sure everyone's not sick for this one!\n\nSo I can't recommend specific foods as they served all the orders on one communal platter and didn't specify which was which.

I saw that it had a solid 4 star rating and vegan as a keyword so decided to give it a shot.\n\nWhen I walked in on a Sunday around 4pm I was either the only customer or one of the only customers. I think their dinner hours only start at 4pm, so that could also be the reason. I was seated at a table that was under a large glass elevated sealing, but the glass looked a bit dirty and it wasn't very scenic to look up. The rest of the atmosphere was a bit shabby too, where it felt slightly dated and maybe corners had been cut when it came to sweeping in the evening. Let's just say that I wasn't impressed and I didn't want to linger in this kind of environment.\n\nThe menu states that all of their vegetarian dishes are also vegan. I ordered the Vegetarian Combo to try as much variety as possible. My food was good, but the portion wasn't enough for leftovers if you are super hungry and I only got one piece of injera in a basket which seemed skimpy to me. I would have asked for more injera, but I believe I saw on the menu that it said extra injera was $3. I'm used to be served as much injera as I want with my meal at other places and this is the first time I have encountered being give only one piece of injera with my meal. \n\nOverall, as someone visiting from out of town, there is no reason for me to come back here since there are so many other options available.", "author": "Regina W."}

I enjoyed the food at New Eritrea and the traditional experiencing of eating this cuisine with your hands. \n\nI went to dinner with my friend and her family. While waiting for our food, we had some honey wine. I highly recommend trying this wine if you're a fan of dessert wines. We ordered a giant platter of the meat combo and vegetable combo. The meat combo had lamb, beef (my favorite), chicken, and catfish. The vegetable consisted of boiled potatoes, different types of beans/lentil mashes, and okra (my favorite). You are provided with injera, which is sour bread, to pick up the different types of meats and vegetables on the platter.

I personally try to avoid places that insist on prix fixe (never seems worth it) or worse, family style (someone always leaves hungry) as well. New Eritrea fit the bill perfectly!\n\nSeemed like most of group did not eat Ethiopian food on the regular, and even those of us pretty familiar with that spicy/tasty Ethiopian goodness, were not familiar with Eritrean cuisine (myself included). I love Ethiopian food and make the most simple vegetarian stews at home (all hail berbere!) One of my colleagues, Helina G (read her very informative review) is of Ethiopian descent and her advice on the menu was really appreciated by the 8 others in my group.

Two of us needed the gluten-free injera, which you ideally request in advance. \n\nI loved everything on my plate (veg platter) and might have inhaled it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-08", "description": "This restaurant is classified as an Ethiopian restaurant, but it's actually Eritrean. I am Ethiopian-American, and there are subtle distinctions between the two aside from the language and geography. Eritrea was formerly a part of Ethiopia until they won their independence in 1991. However, even before that, there were several historical events that shaped these cultural and food distinctions. For example, Ethiopians eat some dishes that include raw/tartare meat (kitfo, terey siga) and cook with heavier spices. Whereas Eritreans have a heavy Italian influence in their cooking that typically includes a lot of tomato-based stews and will even offer various interpretations of pasta and lasagna dishes. However if you're simply looking for injera, spicy stews and/or vegetarian combination platters, either type of cuisine will generally fit the mark. \n\nRecently dined at New Eritrea for a team dinner. They did an excellent job accommodating our large group. The service was excellent and the space was open and inviting. Our server was attentive and extremely patient with our specific requests for gluten-free injera (made wholly with 'teff' grain, indigenous to the horn of Africa). Wine glasses remained full and there was a genuine hospitality that we all very much appreciated. Everything was awesome from the service aspect. Unfortunately, the food itself was average. I grew up eating and cooking these dishes and was very excited to show off the delicious flavors that this type of cuisine had to offer to our group. However it didn't meet my expectations. If you go here, your best bet is to try one of the meat stews (tsebhi or 'wat') or 'tibs' which are some of the most popular items on the menu.", "author": "Helina G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-02", "description": "I've been eating Ethiopian food for many years but I think this was my first foray into Eritrean food. While there are many similarities there are enough differences that it's worth noting that one is not the other, much the same way you shouldn't conflate Indian and Pakistani food. From what I experienced, I would gladly take another go 'round with this cuisine. It was great stuff.\n\nDespite the very casual appearance, the restaurant takes reservations, call ahead orders and can accommodate groups. If you prepare a trip in advance, know that you can request the injera be made with 100% teff flour. This will ensure that you're eating gluten-free (if this is a concern). Once this is done, come in and get ready to have a good time. The restaurant bears the bones of what it was before. I'm guessing it was a bar. The architectural elements are interesting and worth noting. Also worth noting is the very affordable wine list. I opted not to get honey wine (it's hit or miss with me) and, instead, enjoyed a glass (or five) of South African rose'. As much as I wanted to go to town on the sambusas, I knew that they weren't safe for my gluten sensitive stomach. I bravely soldiered on, drinking wine and waiting for the shared (and, giant) vegetarian sampler. It was worth the wait. With my own basket of warm g-f injera at the ready, I dug into mound after mound of red lentils, yellow lentils, okra, collards, potatoes, and chickpeas. The Eritrean spices made the vegetables even more delicious. Because I am a glutton, I couldn't resist my neighbor's NON g-f plate of lamb tibs and chicken. I should have. My belly was not happy with my folly the next day but when I tell you those tibs tasted so good on the way down, I am not giving proper respect to how incredibly good they were. I don't know whether my issue was the cross-contamination or if there needs to be a particular g-f preparation for the dish but I know that if it's possible for me to, safely, have it in the future, I will.\n\nOur server (the owner?) couldn't have been more pleasant to our somewhat unruly group. There were many of us who'd never had Ethiopian food before, much less Eritrean cuisine. He took questions, complicated orders and kept the wine coming with a smile and much grace. I appreciated him. For the entirety of our (very long) meal, the restaurant was packed with patrons. Evidently the word is out about New Eritrea -- and for good reason.", "author": "Johnny T."}

When I left the restaurant, my clothes still smelled like it, which I didn't appreciate because we were going out to a bar afterwards with friends. Just like leaving a Korean BBQ place and smelling like it afterwards, my clothes and body reaked of the smell from this restaurant. \n\nSince it was my first time at the restaurant, I ordered both the Vegetarian Combo and the Meal combo to share with my boyfriend. He's more of a meat lover than I am. I can do without but Is till want to try it so that I can review it. :) \n\nI was able to substitute one of the sides on the vegetarian combo plate for something that I preferred which was nice. The vegetarian combo came with 4 items including a side salad. The 4 items were: lentils, collard greens, chick peas, and potatoes (but I substituted mushrooms instead). \n\nThe meat combo came with 3 different meats: beef, chicken, and lamb as well as a side of lentils and a side salad. \n\nOverall both combo plates were spicy! I never noticed the spicy-ness of Ethiopian food until I ate at this restaurant. This restaurant definitely used a different type of spice or just different ingredients to make their dishes because I had a difficult time finishing my meal. \n\nThe enjera was the same thankfully. I enjoyed that a lot. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't say this is the best Ethiopian restaurant out there. A lot of customers seemed to be enjoying their meal. I saw more men than women here.

The seating towards the back is very nice as the ceiling is made of glass thereby allowing the natural sunlight to illuminate the area. The service here is super friendly, always being attentive, helpful when ordering, and smiling.\n\nWe started off with some meat and vegetable sambusas. The meat one is very simple with some ground beef inside, but the vegetable sambusa has a number of vegetables within for more complex flavors. The chili paste that comes with this starter is absolutely amazing! It has a thick paste consistency to it and has quite a kick of heat and spices. If you like both spice and spiciness, then I highly recommend getting some sambusas to give it a try.\n\nWe ordered both the vegetable combo and the meat combo which seems like the way to go if you're not sure what to get and want a bit of everything. It comes with injera on the side and also under all the goodies, soaking in all the sauces and flavors until it is revealed at the very end. The injera has a unique sour taste to it and is quite spongey as well, making it more interesting than a typical piece of starch. Each of the meats and vegetables were all unique in their own right. What I love about the variety is that each part of it is doused in a separate sauce to get all types of flavors. They have the flavor of Indian food with the variety of spices, but a bit more subtle, not being so strong and powerful.

For one person, this is a LOT of food, so it's well worth the price. \n\nThe second time I went, I went with two friends.

The injera is almost 100% gluten free, and the small amount of wheat in it is fermented, so it didn't bother me. \n\nMaybe I went at weird times, but I think this restaurant should be a lot busier than it is.

We were all so full by the end. So one piece of injera was definitely enough for everyone. \n\nSERVICE: We came on a Saturday evening and were seated immediately.

The sambusas came with a spicy chile paste that was absolutely amazing--it added the perfect amount of spice and flavor to the dough pockets without being overpowering. Then came the main dish--my two friends and I split one each of the vegetarian combo and the meat combo and were served both on one plate. The meat dishes (chicken, lamb, and beef!) were all very tender, having been braised or stewed, and the vegetable dishes (chickpeas, potatoes, lentils, collard greens) were all tasty as well--no one item stood out for me, but having a little bit of everything was definitely a great way to try out the different components.

I've had Eritrean/Ethiopian food before in Berkeley and LA but had been on the lookout for a good place in SF. \n\nWe had to wait maybe around an hour to be seated? It was definitely packed and busy. \n\nCustomer service: It was okay, our server was pretty nice. Definitely seemed to be stretched a bit thin given the amount of people in the restaurant. \nRestroom: Pretty decent and clean, which is pretty important given that I was going to use my hands to pick up and eat the food. \n\nFOOD: Ordered the meat sambusas to start off - they are pretty much like samosas and came with a hella spicy red dipping sauce - use sparingly. Gonna admit, the red pepper sauce wasn't my favorite, but to each their own.\nThen, we ordered the meat combo and vegetarian combo platter. It came on a large circle of injera and separate injera on the side. At first glance, it may not seem like much, but the injera definitely expands in your stomach and fills you up. Similar to past experiences with this cuisine, I didn't like every separate entity within the meat and vegetarian combos. However, I'm not sure if they spice it differently from other restaurants, but I just didn't like some of the dishes that I usually like. \n\nI did like the lentils and the simple salad (I think it's iceberg lettuce?). Was not a fan of the collard greens. As for the meats, I liked the zebhi dorho and zigni. Injera was spongey and not too vinegary. Typical prices for Eritrean/Ethiopian food.", "author": "K W."}

First we had the Sambusa with ground beef...AMAZE. Two puff pastries filled with nicely seasoned beef and it comes with a side of something spicy...a kind of paste you can dip it in. So good!! For dinner we had the Kilwa beef and the New Eritrean Special (chicken). The chicken dish BLEW the beef away. It had so much flavor and the chicken was cooked perfectly. They bring both dishes out on a silver platter sitting on top of the crepe like bread called injera and place bean paste and a small salad in between the two for separation. You can eat it with the bread but I also sort of wrapped the meat in the lettuce. I had the meta lager (Ethiopian) which I really liked.

Once the food came out, we never again saw our server and did not get a water refill. \n\nWe ordered the lamb and okra. The lamb was very tough, almost chewy and did not have a lot of flavor. I probably would have mistaken it for beef if I hadn't ordered it myself. The okra was spicy and more flavorful, carrying some chocolatey notes. I was surprised that it was very mushy, almost more like a paste with only a few distinguishably pieces of okra. Perhaps this is the standard, but I like the texture of okra so I was a bit disappointed. \n\nOur entrees came with \"salad\" served in the middle of the tray, but really it was just glorified iceberg lettuce with a few slithers of carrot. I was surprised that the tray did not come with other sides. I guess I was expecting more of a sampler of sides because that is what I have gotten previously at Assab Eritrean.

Seated immediately with very pleasant service, yummy food, and overall lovely time.\n\nWHAT I TRIED: House platter for 2 (vegetarian) + 2 orders of Meat Combo + 2 extra orders of injera\n\n----MORE DETAIL----\nFOOD: GOOD: I've been a bit spoiled by Ethiopian food in DC - I had a favorite place there which is hands down the best Ethiopian food (and some of the best food) I've ever had. However, this ethiopian food was legit and I enjoyed it. My friends loved it and thought it was the best ethiopian they've had in SF. What I thought could have been better: 1) the injera was a bit more sour than I like it - but that is also more authentic (likely that they had a higher ratio of Teff flour) - so it's a matter of preference, 2) the meat was a little overcooked and therefore dry, and 3) the sauces were a bit sour and not as flavorful as I'm used to, but I think they were also healthier (less clarified butter). What I really liked: 1) they had Eritrean + Ethiopian food and I haven't had as much Eritrean before - friend pointed out that Eritrean tends to be creamier (they really cream up the lentils for example), 2) portions were a good size, and 3) I don't usually like okra, but their okra was delicious.\n\nSERVICE: GREAT: Nothing exceptional or unique, but the servers were very nice - didn't rush us but were still attentive and joked around with us a bit. Very friendly.\n\nAMBIANCE: My friend described it as \"Italian restaurant-y\" which I liked and thought was accurate. It had an \"African flair,\" but you wouldn't really have been able to tell it was Ethiopian/Eritrean from the ambiance. Low mood lighting + clean, interior but nothing special. It was quiet enough to talk without screaming and we sat in the back which was like a greenhouse.", "author": "Christina K."}

The accompanying sauce had some spice to it which was pleasant. The only downside was that it was semi-cold in the middle. I guess they didn't heat it up all the way? \n\nMeat combo:  It was a platter of beef, lamb and chicken. The beef had a good sauce and the injera (flat bread) soaked it up nicely. The lamb was a bit too gamey for me, but was still enjoyable. The chicken was a drumstick in a tomato based sauce with spices.\n\nVegetable platter: This had 4 separate  portions of lentils, collared greens, potatoes and chick peas.

Even though I'm a native of this city, I don't really enjoy sourdough, but I thought the Injera bread was good, spongy, and not too sour for my tastes. \n\nThe honey wine seems to polarize a lot of people, but I'm all about it. I like sweet Muscat dessert wines, so I guess it makes sense that the honey wine works for me too.", "author": "Nei N."}

Thanks for being so accommodating and for providing people with delicious food and friendly service during Saturday dinner rush. I hope you guys liked the cakes and icecream I made :)\n\nLet me just start with a little background: emailed the restaurant via their website to set up a reservation. Their online reservation system is a bit off, as you can only reserve in increments of five people, but forget all that. If you want a reservation, just call them. The young man who answered the phone was so nice. He double-checked everything and when asked questions he was kind enough to find out the answers for me if he didn't know. Genuinely a sincere experience that gave me a great impression. I was reserving for 12 people and asked if it was OK for me to bring cakes and icecream to celebrate two birthdays (because, as I'm sure most of you guys know, some new popup hipster restaurant will say no if you don't use milk from your own organic beer-fed and hand-massaged cow). Not only was it perfectly acceptable, but they proactively told me that they could provide disposable plates if needed and that they would store the cakes and ice cream for me. \n\nNow, on to dinner: parking was a pain, so most of the people got there about an hour late. The staff never rushed us (the people already seated) and were so patient. If it were my restaurant I think I'd be pretty PO'd. They have a full bar so some of our crew opted to get drinks there and all were very satisfied with the quality. The food was delicious. We got both vegetarian platters and combo meat platters for our group, and the amount was perfect. It was an almost even split between guys and gals, and everyone loved the food. I personally preferred the vegetarian selection because you can really taste the different flavors better than the meats, but the meat options were just as yummy.\n\nWhen it was cake time the owner cleared off a little space so that my friend and I could prepare and light the candles. He gave us matches and when we couldn't get the matches to light, he got new ones and helped light them for us. Keep in mind, this was all during a Saturday night dinner stretch! All with such a friendly demeanor! Seriously, the best service I've encountered in SF!\n\nOur group was there til closing and we didn't even know it. The owner and staff just let us stay. We didn't realize that the whole restaurant was empty until about a half hour after they officially closed. \n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place for birthdays :D", "author": "Jamie C."}

The presentation is traditional but not the kind of thing that photographs well, so even though the reviews all rave about it, looking at the pictures was never terribly inspiring, and we always ended up going elsewhere. However, having now been, I would most definitely go back--and I'm sure we will.\n\nWe tried the meat and vegetarian samplers so that we could try everything. It was a really good choice. The flavors just blew me away. My favorites were the--I don't know if it was spinach or okra--it was green for sure!--and the lamb and beef, but everything was good. Loved the injera too, and it is fun to eat with your hands! There were two lentil-type dishes on the vegetarian side, which were tasty but less potent in terms of flavor/spice. The spices in the greens were really mind-blowing. The spices in the meats were amazing.\n\nThe service was great--very friendly, warm, welcoming, helpful, attentive. The ambiance was nice--homey, nothing fancy, but it felt clean, organized, attractive. \n\nI definitely regret not trying this place sooner and look forward to going back!", "author": "Jennie S."}

The only thing that stops me from eating there more often is that I have to call before 2PM to be able to request gluten-free injera. Since injera is traditionally gluten-free, why not just make it all that way? I am pretty sure that just this small change would lead to even more frequent and happy customers.\n\nLove this place - thank you for all your delicious vegan selections. I could eat here everyday.

I feel terrible giving one star but I am just voicing my opinion. Coming with my family, I was so excited to come and try a new cuisine. The portions looked huge, the dishes were service family style in a huge plate, and you use injera (flat bread) to dip in the dishes. Ordered the House Sampler-Vegetarian Combo for three, Kilwa, and Zebhi Dorho. And a cup of honey wine. With a name like honey wine, I expected the sweetness of moscato but it tasted like Halls Honey Cough Drops. The huge platter arrived and we each received an injera. I originally thought that we would need to order more injera but after tasting it, I decided against this idea. All of the vegetarian dishes are sour, really sour. The injera is also sour, so it is sour on sour. Not for me.

Don't worry, I've never gotten sick, they use quality product and have a sanitary kitchen. I have visited enough that I have tried almost everything on the menu and it is consistently good with most dishes being excellent. \nThe staff is always polite and welcoming.

Every single one of those dishes, especially the Kitfo are something everyone has to experience. This place isn't just something special because its Eritrean, its one of the best around.

We ordered the vegetarian platter for two and the lentil appetizer. \n\nThe appetizer came out promptly and tasted delicious. It's basically lentils in a pastry shell. It's very savory, mostly due to it being fried, something I'd love to get again. Our main course came soon after and to explain it, it's like 6 piles of slop on top of their dosa like bread. Each person also gets their own bread to use to rip and pick at your meal. I'm not too sure what pile was which, but they all tasted delicious.

I ordered take out one night and the food was still hot when I got home 20 minutes later.The New Eritrean Special (Chicken with mushrooms) and Kilwa (beef) were both very good.  We also had the okra, which was so so.  I ended up adding sauteed chicken to it the next day for another meal.  With that said, there was a good amount of food with each order, which includes the flatbread, side of mashed lentils, and a simple salad.  There was enough food for the two of us for about three meals.  Total was a little less than $40.

Talked to a man over the phone who was very nice, said I had 12 people, said we would be there at 6:30, he said they could take us no problem.  Our party turned out to be 10 and they did not hassle us about it.  Everyone also did not arrive at the same time (some came early, some on time, some late) and despite this those who were early/on time were still seated.\n\nWe took a long time - A LONG TIME (I want to say 30 minutes) - to decide on appetizers and entrees.  I felt our servers (we had 2, one man and one woman; the man was the person I spoke to on the phone) were getting a little impatient, but that's understandable and they were not rude or snappy with us at all; they were, in fact, EXTREMELY NICE. Example: There is this hot (as in spicy) spread (\"spread\"...not sure what to call it) that comes with the appetizers we ordered. Two words: \n\nHELLA GOOD. \n\nSo good \"HELLA GOOD\" deserved it's own line (it was a mix of ginger, garlic, chili powder, andsomethingelseidon'trememberbutitdoesn'tmatterbecauseit'sallmagicalandwonderfulmixedtogetheranyways). \n\nAfter we finished our appetizers I was scraping the ramekins for the remainder of the spread (\"spread\") and was licking the spoons.  When the female server came to collect the empty plates I protested when she picked up the ramekins and she replied: \"But they're empty.  You want me to bring you a new one?\" \n\nMY FACE LIT UP LIKE TIMES SQUARE, THE VEGAS STRIP, AND TOKYO COMBINED. \n\nI felt like a winner. \n\nI asked our male server later if they sold it in jars.  He said no, lots of customer before have asked the same thing, and they were considering it, but as of now - no.  A sad, sad no. \n\nWe ordered HELLA FOOD.  7 entrees total, I believe.  Plus the appetizers.  Plus two bottles of wine (the honey wine and a white wine, which we discovered were quite good mixed together).  $217 total before tip.  \n\nI'm not much of a foodie, so describing the food with nuance and accuracy.....sorry, can't do - ask someone with a more refined palate for that one.  However, my non-sophisticated tongue was quite pleased, for whatever that's worth.  The LAMB, though...#s 9 + 10 are both lamb...I forget the names, I forget which one is which...but the SAUCY ONE - not the drier one - THE SAUCY ONE.  \n\nMy IJUSTLIKEFOOOOOOOD taste buds give that dish a resounding HELL YEAH.\n\nOverall, really great food, really great service.

Unfortunately (at least on this trip) that means that anyone wanting a nice dinner is out of luck. \n\nApparently relaxed vibe here means that this place is family friendly. By that I'm alluding to the very loud children that were welcomed into the restaurant on my visit. \n\nIf you want any kind of quiet or intimate conversation you won't find it here, at least I didn't. If this is a regular occurrence, you definitely won't get any kind of pleasant dinner or nice environment here. It sounded more akin to Chucky cheese going ons in the front of the restaurant.  Now mind you, I understand a child's behavior is a great reflection on the parenting. There was a child closer to me that was completely unheard. You would not even have known she was there but to glance over and see her. But the other family, that was a different story. And for the restaurant to allow such behavior to continue, apparently that's the crowd they want.\nI'm only taking them down a bit for this since they don't choose dinners. But they do choose who stays. It was akin to the drunkard whose had one to many at a bar and is now bothering the patrons. Maybe you didn't invite him in. But you can cut him off and ask him to leave.\n\n\nNow on to the food...\n\nThe food was delicious. I've always wanted to try Ethiopian food, and i was not disappointed.\n\nI opted for the veggie combo. It allowed me to try a few different things as one dinner. The flavors were homey and delicious. Reminiscent to the best stew you've ever had. So delicious.\nThe flavors were not strong or over powering. More comfort food style.\n\nI always thought the bread stuff that works as your spoon would be more like naan. Instead it is thinner and has less flavor. I don't mean this in a bad way.It allows the dishes to stand out on their own. More like the casing to a French crepe. It's not exactly like that, but the best I can describe it. There is a large piece provide for your meal. Additionally, your meal is served on top of one of these bread pieces. So you have more than plenty to eat your meal.\n\nOverall the food was delicious. I wish those horrible children hadn't ruined the experience. But there were several families coming in with children.... So it's hard to assume this was really unusual.\n\nNevertheless, this was a good experience with Ethiopian food. Maybe it was just an off day...

The owner is always warm and welcoming; and even if we have not been there in awhile he always remembers us.  We had a party of 11 and service was on point.  We went with family that had never had Eritrean cuisine.  We started with lentil and meat Sambusas.

Good, a bit chewy but just the right amount was served.\n\nMeat Combination (combining three of their dishes): Zigni (beef),  Zebhi Dorho (Chicken) and Alicha Begee (lamb).  The Chicken dish had a better blend of flavors and I would have it again.  This was listed on their online menu $2 cheaper than their actual menu at the premises, so not sure how many other price discrepancies there are.  The website doesn't seem like it's been updated in a while.\n\nOverall the food was OK.  The lamb was not tender and the beef a little chewy.  Chicken was really good though.  Prices are higher than the quality of the dishes. This is not as tasty as the Eritrean on Geary, but the service was friendly and they did well in getting the food out, considering how many people were dining.\n\nSomething I really don't understand about some restaurants is how many things are missed.  I know I go there to eat, but I also judge my whole experience.  The door for the ladies room was propped open, I discovered due to the fact that the handle was hanging on by a wish and a prayer, as all other nails had disappeared over time.  The cubicle I was in had a toilet seat that desperately needed a little love and I was apprehensive to park my rear on!  The only tap in the room did not run correctly and instead soaked the underside of the tap and the sink unit.

If you look at the menu that's posted in the photos, add $1-2 to everything since prices did go up!  Nevertheless, it was still worth it.  Just tear off a piece of the injera bread and use it to sample the dishes.  If you run out of injera bread, don't order more!  Just use the injera bread that is served with the dish on the bottom.  You save money and it soaked with all the flavor.  The meat was savory and moist.  Veggies were delish too!

Well, for me:\n\nUni : Japanese restaurant :: Kitfo : Ethiopian restaurant\n\nThis exotic dish of minced raw beef (or rare, if you prefer), mitmita, and clarified butter may frighten some people. But for me and my iron stomach it's an essential--and quintessential--part of any Ethiopian meal.\n\nThe KITFO at New Eritrea was absolutely AMAZING!! It was easily my favourite of the 6 dishes we had here. The portion was generous and the beef was so finely ground it had a mousse-like consistency that melted in my mouth. But what made this dish truly memorable was the clarified butter it was soaked in--perfectly seasoned and it gave the dish the most wonderful caramel-y/nutty aroma. SOOO YUMMY!! Definitely the best kitfo I've ever had. I'm still having food dreams about it...\n\nThe other entr\u00e9es we got were the OKRA (flavoured with tomato, onions, and spices) and a meat combo that included ZIGNI (beef simmered in red pepper sauce), ZEBHI DORHO (chicken drumstick simmered in onion, tomatoes, and red pepper sauce), and ALICHA BEGEE (lamb with potatoes, carrots, peppers, and curry). They were all served on one big platter over a piece of injera. (We each also got one piece of injera to eat and use as utensils.) To be perfectly honest, all of them except for the lamb looked (puddles of red stew) and tasted (tomatoes, onions, and red pepper) the same. But, they were seasoned well and tasted great with the tangy injera. I liked the lamb dish most, partly because the curry sauce made it a little different. That, and I just really like lamb!\n\nWe also got an order of MEAT SAMBUSAS, which were deep-fried samosa-like pastries filled with ground beef, onions, and spices. The crispy shell was nice but I thought the filling was rather bland if not for the spicy chilli paste they were served with to give it a little kick.", "author": "Steph L."}

On top of that, running into ex-coworkers from a previous job released another set of photos where I was thinking to myself, \"what the hell made me wear my hair like that?!@#\"\n\nSo it was fitting in that New Eritrea found us, giggling as much as we did back in the day.  He was voted the most intellectual.  I was voted (two years verified via yearbooks) class clown.  A true fit.\n\nNew Eritrea has a fantastic broad menu to season the diverse clientele that is out and about in the city.  When we usually went out, we ordered a smattering of vegetarian dishes as well as a couple of meat dishes to even out the meal.  I preferred the injera here than Blue Nile, one of my first experiences ever.  Not as tart or yeasty.  I would recommend the following:\n\nZebhi Dorho - a wonderful slow cooked piece of chicken that literally falls off the bone, simmered in spices.  Perfect to sop up with the injera.\n\nKliwa Begee - another simmered dish and the only way I'll eat lamb.\n\nVegetarian combination - a compilation of their three popular veggie dishes: lentils, potatoes, peas, and carrots are covered and provide the perfect backdrop to the aforementioned meat dishes.\n\nI rarely order an appetizer because by then, after all the talking and looking over photos, has somewhat eased our appetite.  Service,however, is a bit slow if one is in a hurry, so I'd recommend elsewhere for the time strapped.

The meat platter, which you must eat by hand, had 3 types of meat which all had their own sauces. I wasn't a huge fan of a couple of the meats, I am still unsure which ones they were.

Sure, oil tastes good, and the food here is super savory. But sometimes when I'm halfway through my favorite mushroom dish, I realize it tastes exactly like pizza.\n\nAlso, that same mushroom dish I've ordered about 6 times ranges from nicely spiced to un-spiced to REALLY too spicy. Which means I can't say \"more spice than usual\" or \"less spice than usual\" because, what's usual?!\n\nStill, I like coming here because it's close to my house, and the food comes out fast, super filling, and pretty tasty. They have more tables than Assab so the wait to sit down isn't as long, and the service is faster as well.\n\nI also love that they have a catfish dish - which I HIGHLY recommend.

I love meeting up here with individual friends to catch up over dinner, and it's also an amazing spot for large groups. I recently hosted my birthday dinner here, and they comfortably accommodated a group of 20. The shared platters are especially good for groups because it makes it easy to split the check later. They also serve pitchers of a range of beers.\n\nThe food is amazing: warm, nourishing, perfectly spiced. They offer both meat and vegetarian combo platters that allow you to sample a wide range of their dishes for a very affordable price. They're perfect for sharing! I would also highly recommend the gored gored beef - this scrumptious dish is not to be missed. The samusas are excellent as well. I'm not sure what goes into the spicy red sauce that accompanies them, but the end result is addictive.

All the food ordered comes out on a big platter without any forks or spoons. You eat with your hands? How? This grey spongy thing here is bread? This bread doesn't look like any bread I have seen before. So many mind blowing things happening at once. \n\nMeat combination was a good choice that came with chicken, beef, and lamb. The beef was soft and had an interesting sauce it was in. Chicken was hard to eat since it was a chicken leg. How do you share a chicken leg with people? The lamb was kind of chewy, but it pretty good.Kitffo had a lot of spices inside it. I didn't really like the kitffo. It was too weird for me with so many spices hitting my taste buds at once. Imagine all the spices used in curry but a lot more spices. There were also a small salad in the middle of the platter. Eating salad without a fork is quite difficult.\n\nOverall the food was pretty okay. Kind of hard to get used to all the new flavors and spices they used. The service was kind of slow. The experience itself was fun and interesting. This would definitely be a fun experience with a large group of people.", "author": "Steven B."}

The location is also great because it is only a quick two block walk from the botanical garden.  I found it entirely on accident and stopped in to try it.   \n\nThe place could use a spruce up, but don't let the old decor fool you.  \n\nThey serve a style of bread called Injera which was very interesting.  It resembles a thick crepe with a slightly tangy flavor - think the tang of Greek yogurt.  It is very light and spongy and doesn't have a ton of flavor alone.  It is used with eating the way you eat with a tortilla.  It is just like a sponge, so it will sop up every last bit of flavor, but it is leaky, so ask for extra napkins!\n\nI had no idea what to order and it all sounded good, so I just let the waiter order for me.  He recommended the three meat dish with lamb, chicken and beef.  I am not normally a lamb eater, but this was delicious!  The chicken was also great.  The food was much spicier than I expected, so it took me a while to power through my meal. The meats came with a variety of sauces on them and they resembled a curry.  They were very complex in seasoning and balanced really well against the meat.  Oh...the meat!  It was ALL so tender and juicy and all melted in your mouth like a quality pot roast that has been slow cooking for hours.  The chicken is served on the bone, so dig in.  \n\nThey have several wines on the list and a full bar.  They serve several wines from South Africa and they serve a honey wine that is really interesting.  It reminds me of mead.  \n\nThe food is fairly oily, but I am not sure if that is just indicative of the style of cuisine or this place.  \n\nThey don't serve the meals with utensils so if you don't want to use your hands, then you need to ask for silverware.  The server could see the confusion on my face so he offered me a fork and explained to me that you use the injera to pick up the meat and eat it.  Don't laugh - I just have never had this type of food before.  Since I like to look like I know what I am doing sometimes, I grabbed my injera and loaded up a handful of meat.  It was delicious, but I must again reinforce that I needed a ton of napkins!  I got my nails done later that afternoon and I had sauce stains all over my nails.  That is the sign of a good meal!\n\nThe service was great!  He was friendly, helpful, attentive and quick.  The food came out in no time at all with a basket of injera.\n\nIf I am in the area, I would definitely stop back by, but who knows what other culinary adventures you may miss?

I love Ethiopian cuisine after my experiences working as a waitress for an excellent quality Ethiopian restaurant for 2+ years in Colorado (Nyala's Ethiopian cuisine). \n\nIt was very late 9:30pm and a lot of places were closing but luckily the New Eritrea Restaurant was open. There was only one other couple at the bar at that time and so we expected quality service. But the food took a long time to prepare (30+ min) and they were unapologetic about this. \n\nWe ordered a vegetarian combo for two which included 6 dishes. My favorite was the Okra. We also ordered Kilwa (saut\u00e9ed beef), Kitffo (spicy rare beef), Zebhi Dorho (marinated chicken drumstick stew), and Kilwa Begee (lamb stew). The best, by far, was the Kitffo which was served with farmers cheese and collard greens. It was pipping hot and very flavorful. \n\nMy main disappointment was the injera. You were charged extra when ordering more and it wasn't very fresh. I am used to softer injera with a spongy texture - this injera was at least a day or two old which caused it to dry out and become become brittle. The Injera at the bottom of the plate was the worst. Normally my favorite part is to eat the injera at the end which has absorbed all the sauces and spices - But the stale injera deflated this pleasure completely.\n\nSo overall, while I love to eat Ethiopian food and really enjoyed the Kitffo, the slow service and stale injera but a damper on the experience.", "author": "Nina E."}

The ambiance is warm and cozy, the service was great, and the prices were about what I expect for this kind of food (10-15$ a plate).

Don't fill up on the injera in your basket... save room for the very best part of the meal: the soggy injera underneath your various entrees!!!!\n\nI enjoyed the veggie combo platter and the As Kiwla (spicy curried catfish). Absolutely delicious. I would write home about this one but instead I am writing to you.\n\nI must recommend that you skip the tempting sounds of their sambusa appetizers as it is not much more than a lot of fried dough with a meager scrap of filling. I must also make note that the spicy curried lentil dish on the platter was oversalted, I love salt so this was actually a surprising pleasure for me. \n\nAlso this is a beautiful and thoughtfully decorated/arranged restaurant ~ very good energy in there. I love this place!!\n\nOh yes my dining partner and I paid $32.50 for 2 lentil sambusas, 1 catfish, and 1 veggie platter ~ pretty standard for SF.", "author": "Libra J."}

I am NOT one of these people who will give this cuisine a low rating because I don't like it.  In fact...I love it.  One of the things that I usually love about it is that, unlike most Thai and Indian restaurants, they don't use 4 gallons of oil to make your meal.  This is the first place I've been to where oil was a real problem.  I was glad we walked the 3 miles from BART to get there because there was just THAT much oil.  In fact, we could've taken the oil left on our plates home in a to-go box and I could've used it to cook for the rest of the week.\n\nAside from that; the service is great, the atmosphere is great, and I love the glass ceiling in the back.  Yay for Tej!  The taste of the food was average (we ordered the veg combo).  I was excited to see the okra because that's one dish you don't usually get...

Basically, that eliminated all our sushi options in the immediate area.\n\nI suggested Ethiopian, and she concurred it would be a nice change of pace. We got here and it wasn't all that busy, so we were seated right away. We debated over what to get (i wanted more meat, she wanted more vegetables), but ultimately settled on the meat combo and the vegetable combo--the come with 5 sample dishes each--and an appetizer. All the food came rather quickly, and we were very pleased with the speed of delivery and quality of the food. I really liked the chick peas and collard greens, as well as the very moist chicken and the beef.\n\nThis wasn't our first time having Ethiopian, but i definitely suggest the two combo dishes for anyone going for the first time.

I've had Ethiopian and Eritrean food in many places around the US. Its one of my top 5 favorite foods.\n\nI am sorry to say I didn't like the food that I had at New Eritrea Restaurant & Bar. Maybe people have different baselines for what they think good Ethiopian/Eritrean food should taste like. Or maybe we picked dishes that aren't the restaurant's best.

At New Eritrea they have a Veggie Sampler where you get what would have been a nice set of 5 veggie dishes if they had tasted as good as they sounded. When it came out, it was anti-climatic. It didn't even look appetizing. \n\nThe Vegetarian Allicha, normally one of my favorites had an orange sheen to it and was almost all very large pieces of potato with almost no cabbage. It tasted bland and well, to potato-y.\n\nThe rest of the veggie sampler were also missing the usual charge I get from this kind of food. The  Alicha-Ater (pureed Chickpeas) was ok as was the Hamli (Collard greens and spinach) and Okra. But the Tumtumo (pureed lentils) was pasty and somewhat tasteless and Shiro (split peas) was also nothing to write about.\n\nThe injera was thin and with nothing to say for itself ether.\n\nWe also got the New Eritrea Special which is made from \"Tenderized boneless chicken mixed with mushrooms sauteed with onion, tomatoes, garlic and authentic Eritrean spices\".

Dim lighting, candle lit table, and soft tone music really set the tone for a romantic evening...or in my case an romantic outing with my best buds.\n\nThe Service here was unmatched. Small things like a helpful suggestion on what to order, constant checking in to see if everything is okay, and the revolutionary idea of bringing a pitcher of water and leaving it at our table rather than scurrying to the kitchen every time someone needs water. Sadly service like this is a rarefied occurrence these days.\n\nFinally let me get to the food and drinks. Obviously if you are coming to New Eritrea Restaurant & Bar you are basically putting yourself out there to try something new. I've read several reviews were people say, \"The food was to bizarre and eccentric for me.\" Well OF COURSE IT IS, it is ETHIOPIAN FOOD!  That is like me going to a House of Prime Rib and complaining, \"Ohh this food was too Prime Ribbery!\" That being said the food for the most part was great. We ordered several meat dishes (no homo) and not only was the meat tender and juicy but the sauce was really mouthwatering. So many flavors in the sauce, it felt like the sauce was injected with food anabolic steroids, which in other words injected with super flavor!\n\nMy only complaint for the food was what they called bread. This bread which resembled more of the padding they put on the floor at Chuck E. Cheese, was definitely not my cup of tea. Not only was the look unappealing but it tasted like a Scotch-Brite Sponge. \n\nAt the end of the day New Eritrea Restaurant & Bar was a pleasant and delicious surprise. Beautifully decorated, amazing service, and scrumpt-dilli-umcious food, what more can you ask for.

I find everything very flavorful and I can't guess how it's made, so that's always the sign of a winner in my books. I usually get the veggie combo. Their collard greens are probably the best way to cook that tricky veggie; I actually come back just because I'm in the mood for those. Really, I get cravings for their collard greens; when does that ever happen! And I also love the lentil dishes, so amazing.\n\nI've had their meat too, being a huge fan of eating animals, and it's tasty. Just that the veggie dishes here are good enough that I don't miss meat, so I usually just go veggie.\n\nTry the Ethiopian beers or honey wine, they're quite good. The beers aren't like typical light colonial-style pilsners. They're heftier and kind of sweet, very nice. \n\nAlso, for the gluten intolerant, their injera does contain a small amount of wheat (I asked because I wanted to bring my mom here and she can't have gluten) but if you call in advance they can make the injera entirely with teft for a gluten-free meal.\n\nOne last thing: I don't usually rate on service because it has so much to do with the particular server you get and nothing to do with the quality of the food or the overall experience unless you're faced with total incompetence, BUT, at New Eritrea the waiter is always super attentive and fast. Also friendly without being in your face. We've had a few nice chats.

My classmates and I were invited out for lovely evening of Eritrean food which I will sum up in a few words for those of us with little time - eating at New Eritrea was like going home to your parents house and they've prepared a banquet in your honor that they've been stewing all day.\n\nFirst, the alcohol, because really how else can you begin to taste the food if you don't have a good drink to pair with it? I recommend having a nice amber beer or a honey wine. I had both and they were really great with the food. They have several beers on tap and some imports at their fully stocked bar.\n\nFirst, for appetizers we had these samosa like things come out alongside some spicy chili paste. Add just a little paste to your samosa (it's filled with lentils) and so tasty. I think they're either lightly fried or baked because they were very light.\n\nFor dinner a huge platter came out with an array of options (all the veggie favorites and all the meat favorites). The vegetarian options were delicious - lentils, chickpeas, another veggie puree, carrots and cabbage, all steaming hot and so tasty (watch your fingers guys!). The injera bread was very nice, not too sour. I have a hard time ranking the meat options. The chicken curry was divine, the lamb curry was great, but the beef tibsie was incredible. I couldn't get enough of the latter but they were all very good, just the right temperate (hot!) and wonderful to share.\n\nThe service was lovely, such nice staff, very attentive. We never had to wonder if they would bring more water bottles for the table (even though they were incredibly busy). Also, one of our friends crashed into a glass door by accident (watch the glass wall everyone!) and the staff were so attentive of him even though he was fine and it was totally his fault he walked into it as he missed seeing the wood frame.\n\nEmergencies aside, the food was excellent and I will certainly go back with my adventurous food friends.

Be prepared to use napkins as this family style of eating can get messy. Each dish was a little pricey (average $12 each plate) in my opinion for the kind of food we were eating. They had one plasma tv by the bar. \n\nBottomline: The service was good but I probably wont be back here as this unique type of food and way of eating isnt quite my cup of tea.", "author": "Robert Y."}

I lived with a Kenyan family in a far-from-affluent neighborhood and worked miles away on a heavily fortified street, across from the Israeli embassy.  \n\nThe city lived up to its pejorative moniker, \"Nai-robbery,\" as did my neighborhood, South-C, to its (\"South Central,\" naturally).  I watched three men with anachronistic rifles burglarize a neighboring home and a young couple divested of possessions at knife-point.  I was repeatedly accosted by unseemly fille de joie and targeted by skillful larcenists.\n\nAnd yet, I loved Nairobi. The verdancy of the city, vibrancy of its nightlife, each unique storyline that followed the fade in of daybreak.  \n\nAnd of course, the incredible cuisine.  \n\nSome of my most poignant memories from Kenya are of the people I met, conversations I enjoyed, and authentic food and drink I savored in the lush courtyard of a local Ethiopian restaurant.  For successfully transporting me there with its delightfully taciturn service, unrefined yet lively decor, deliciously nostalgic Kenyan beer and savory, authentic, yet reasonably-priced shiro (a traditional dish made of chickpeas, onions and tomatoes), ingera, and asa kilwa (catfish sauteed with onions, tomatoes, garlic, red pepper sauce and olive oil), New Eritrea Restaurant and Bar deserves five stars.", "author": "Savvy S."}

I've always been a fan of richly spiced ethnic foods (like Indian, Thai, Afghani, etc.), and this place does not disappoint.  It's totally a fun and satisfying dining experience.\n\nYou eat with your hands, family-style.  The entrees come on a large platter on top of a large injera (\"bread\") and you also get your own injera to tear into pieces to pick up the entrees.  The vegetarian/vegan dishes are really good--very tasty and filling.  But if you're into meat, which I am, you must try the \"Gored Gored,\" which is a dish with cubes of tenderloin tips served rare in a spicy sauce.   There hasn't been a dish there that I haven't just absolutely loved. The food can be real spicy, so hotheads rejoice!  Or, you can ask them to adjust the spiciness if you have a delicate palate.  (I just called you a wimp under my breath.)\n\nThey have a fabulous Ethiopian stout called Hakim which I highly recommend with your food.  We also tried the Pinotage, a red wine from South Africa, and that was wonderful as well.  \n\nThe staff and service was great!

(Sad face). \"But you can have it with rice if you want.\" OOoh. \n\nSo, that prompted our visit to the restaurant last night. It was my first time having Ethiopian food, although I've wanted to try it for years. My date and I ordered the meat sampler and the vegetarian sampler, so we had 7 dishes to try. The chicken -- a huge, tender drumstick -- was astoundingly good. We also particularly liked the buttery potatoes and the spicy lentils, but everything was wonderful. He had a glass of the stout and I had the honey wine -- delicious. \n\nWe came in at about 8pm and the place was empty except for a few people at the bar. As we ate, more and more diners came in. Even so, it was reasonably quiet -- we could actually hear each other talk! -- and there was some soft music playing. In addition, the service was great and our food and drink arrived quickly.", "author": "Beth W."}

Total cost, including my *three* extra pieces of injera, plus generous tip, was $60.\n\nFinal note: the staff working here typifies exactly what I have experienced in every Ethiopian or Eritrean restaurant from Berkeley to Oakland to SF to San Diego: flawlessly courteous, genuinely concerned for the patron's enjoyment of the dining experience, more than willing to check in on the progress of your meal but un-intrusive overall, and -- most importantly -- genuinely appreciative of your business.

The service is really friendly and fast, the restaurant is large with plenty of seating, a full bar and in a fairly decent area for parking.\n\nI loved the injera bread/pancake. It looks like a flat sponge, but has a sharp sourdough flavor. It's pretty different from other flat breads. We ordered a meat combo and a veggie combo, in order to try as many things as possible. To be honest, I expected a lot more exotic flavors, but it was very middle eastern and normal. The lamb dish was good, the beef tasted like chile con carne, and the chicken was tender. The vegetables were mainly comprised of lentils. Overall, great flavor and fun to try new things. I'm not really a fan of eating with your hands, but whatev - it's fun!", "author": "Amanda D."}

Also, it has been years since I've eaten at an Eritrean/Ethiopian restaurant, so I cannot compare the food to other Horn of Africa restaurants. For the same reason, finding New Eritrea was a blessing; this is a wonderful cuisine that deserves more popularity.\n\nI've been meaning to come here for a while. Finally I didn't have something that had to be used or go bad, and so I gave Puffle  (my Labrador) her bowl of food and slipped out while she wasn't paying attention to anything but chowing down.\n\nThe menu has six vegan dishes, plus a combination of the first four. I had the combination, and it was very tasty. The four were served on top of injera (a spongy, moist, tangy bread made of teff flour), with an extra piece of injera served on the side. There are no utensils, so you scoop up the stew-like dishes with pieces of injera. I was out of practice, and had to order an extra bit of injera to finish my plate, and I used three napkins. Presumably one gets better at this with practice. But when I was done, my plate looked as if Puffle had been there to lick it.\n\nUnfortunately New Eritrea is only open for dinner, and they have no outdoor seating, which is why Puffle had to stay at home. Still, it is fun to have this African cuisine so nearby. I'll go again.", "author": "Earl K."}

Now that that's out of the way, I liked this place although I did have some qualms with its bright lighting - I need soft, yellow light to look fuckable can I say soft or would that be inappropriate? Also, they really need to do something about the exterior because it kind of looks like less of a restaurant and more of a random little shit shack. Or, like what you'd expect a restaurant to look like in Eritrea (whatever, you didn't even know where Eritrea was until you Google mapped it).\n\nI went here a couple nights ago with a pretty big group of like 10 or so, and we sat in the back room. I ordered a Harar beer (it's Eritrian, too!) because I can't interact with humans while sober (jk friends I like you guys!). That beer was very good, and got me a bit tips after just one. Best part of sitting in the back happened when some guy walked into the glass separator between the back room and the bar area and the ENTIRE restaurant started laughing at him. It felt like being in a movie. The waiter then placed a few blue post-it notes to alert people that there was glass that cannot be walked through.\n\nThe food came out on a big platter with 8 piles of brightly colored goo (I didn't order it so I don't know what it was). I only ate the vegetarian stuff and felt like an assole for having to ask people to dip first in the vegetarian stuff and then go to meat, and not the other way around. It was tantamount to asking people at the dinner table to please wipe front to back. Continuing with the culturally insensitive, bathroom theme, the way to eat here is to use the INJERA bread to grab the gooey stuff and just TRY not to have the image of scooping up baby poo with a diaper and placing it in your mouth. The injera bread was okay but it seems like if you're going to use it to replace forks, spoons, napkins, and plates, it should be awesome. However, I've had it at a different Eritrean restaurant and it was much better here. So it may be physically impossible to make it taste any better. The food was very, very delicious despite everything I've said.\n\nAnd I can't not mention this but the whole time I've been writing this, I can see someone else's review saying the food here is \"Americanized\" BUT, it's still good and I'm going to give myself an aneurysm by repeatedly saying to myself \"What in the actual fuck? Seriously? What in the fuck?\" The word Americanized generally seems to mean \"made more delicious and awesome.\" Really, dude, unless you are from Eritrea, have been to Eritrea (congratulations, you're either Eritrean or rich enough to afford that plane ticket) or have had an Eritrean person make Eritrean food for you, please make sure to alert me if we ever meet in the world that you are the guy who said this so I can waste no time speaking to you.", "author": "Joe T."}

How does one distinguish the \"cuisine\" from the \"place\"?

There are no utensils (something my fellow diner could have warned me about before I asked where the forks were...), instead you use a thin spongy flat bread to scoop up delightful bits of meat and vegetable, and then eat the whole mess. Sort of like making dozens of tiny wraps.\n\nMy party split one vegi-combo and one-meat combo, which the staff was nice enough to put on a single large plate for a family style experience. More than enough food for the two of us and allowed for the sampling of four different vegi dishes and three meat dishes. I was a bit nervous, during the experience, that I would run out of bread -- and thus be forced to use my bare hands to eat -- but it turned out we left bread on the plate, so don't worry about it. Just be conscience of your bread to food ratio and you'll do fine.\n\nAs a final note, the ambiance of the location was really lovely. Extensive wood paneling, local art and music, and a very friendly waiter really made the place comfortable with a bit of a post-colonial vibe (as my fellow diner described it).

Not rushed, not intrusive, but attentive in a way that you're not left wanting for anything. The restaurant itself feels a little random and dive-y, but in the best way possible. There may be Christmas lights and lots of random decorations, but it's dark and cozy and warm, and the bartender is usually playing some Ethiopian jazz. Really, it's one of my favorite places to go in the Inner Sunset.", "author": "heather c."}

Meat combo comes with beef in a spiced tomato sauce, lamb curry, and chicken leg braised in a spiced tomato sauce. The lamb and chicken were good, but the beef this time was so gritty, the way meat gets when it has been cooked too long and feels like sand on the tongue.The veggie combo has changed over the 20 years I have been coming here. This one has a green veggie which I think is spinach and two different kinds of lentils, very gritty and bland. It used to come with a mushroom that was one of my favorites. You now have to order the mushrooms as a separate entree. We used to be stuffed after sharing the two combos, but portions have really shrunk. We were still hungry after this time. Oh, and to aid in digestion of all the spice, ask for the yogurt. I think it is homemade. Very tasty and complements all the sauces very well. It used to come standard on the platter, but that changed over ten years ago and you now have to ask for it.", "author": "Carrie W."}

Now, if Ethiopean marathon runners come to mind, you would be way off. This was a bunch of crazy-hungry (feel free to change that hyphen to a comma) Yelpers...so we were sprintin'! In no less than 15 minutes time, we blazed through:\n\n- The standard romaine lettuce, cucumber salad: doesn't really impact my rating, but I didn't care for the dressing which was like that bottled Kraft Italian crap.\n\n- #16 Okra: sauteed with tomatoes, onions, and spices. They intentionally cook their okra lightly so as to keep it firm, not mushy and super slimy. But since I'm weird, I actually prefer my okra to be mushy and slimy.\n\n- #17 Vegetarian Allicha: a yellow, seasoned mixture of potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, and possibly some other veggies. Other Yelpers  have found this to be bland, but I quite enjoyed the subtle flavor  and the way that this worked very well with the melt-in-your-mouth texture of the veggies.\n\n- #19 Kantisha: sliced button mushrooms sauteed with onions, tomatoes, and the more Ethiopean spices. We ordered this as medium spicy, but I found it on the mild side...alright, but I think I'd skip it next time to try out something more interesting or traditional like lentils or split peas.\n\n...and of course, the MEAT!\n\n- #7 Kilwa Borho: white meat chicken cooked in a tomato based sauce, which we ordered as medium spicy. Again, the spiciness wasn't all there, but this was still quite tasty. I'm partial to dark meat, so I will probably try the #8 (marinated drumsticks) next time.\n\n- #12 Gored-gored: OMG. It was tenderloin steak tips that straight up tasted like BUTTER. Not beef taste with a butter sauce. It was as if the beef and butter were one in artery-clogging harmony. I raved about this like a madwoman, but others thought that the butter taste was too much. Wimps.\n\nWe scarfed this all down with the generous helpings of injera bread provided (2 per person). This is some of the best injera I have ever had - subtly tart and riding the delicate line between spongy and firmness in texture. But beware - that stuff really does expand in your stomach, and you'll be feelin' it long after the meal is over.\n\nBut wait, the race wasn't over yet. We knew we still had some eating left in us, so decided to order some meat sambusas, which are like the Eritrean/Ethiopean answer to the empanada. The outer layer was chewy and crispy, with yummy seasoned ground meat inside - even better with the tomato paste-ish condiment. Though they were good at the time, I wasn't so impressed that I would order them again. \n\nPerhaps it was the sweet nectar of the 13% alcohol honey wine. Perhaps it was invokation of the Filipino idiom to \"galit-galit muna,\" in short, \"Shut up, and let's eat now.\" But we tore through that meal like we were running for gold. We were athletes fully into the game,with much of the meal spent grunting, groaning (think Sharapova...yeah, she's tennis. It's still sports, only a minor mixed metaphor), and one word calls out to the food. \"Beef.\" \"Potatoes.\" \"Chicken.\" Alas, the moment went by too fast. When I return, I will have to slow myself down to a jog so that I can fully take in the tastes and smells...and hopefully not end up with indigestion the rest of the night.", "author": "Steph P."}

There aren't a whole lot of choices for it near home. So when we spotted this restaurant when driving home from eating in this area, we groaned and made a mental note to remember it for our next trip. We were back this weekend to visit the new Natural History Museum in the park and remembered our mental note. This place is very close to the park and in a neighborhood of restaurants and shops. \n\nThe place was busy but not packed fairly early on a Friday night. \n\nNew Eritrea is on the edge of the Irving Street food district. Walk until you think you've looked at all your choices and you'll see it about 1/2 a block up. That's too bad because they are quite good. \n\nSomeone mentioned issues with parking. We've been to this area twice now and always found street parking quite easily. You may have to walk a couple or three streets. The spots turn over fairly quickly. \n\nThe place is fairly large with two dinning areas and a full bar. It's not fancy but it isn't downscale either. Sort of homey, reasonable for a date where you aren't trying to impress with romance. Perfect for talking to your companions. \n\nFood is primarily the typical stuff you see on Ethopian/Eritrean Menus. There were a couple of dishes marked New Eritrean but we didn't try them. We had the smaller of the vegetarian samplers and a meat dish. The veggie sampler came with 4 choices, each quite nice. I don't believe I'd encountered the spinach one before. The potato dish was quite yummy. Everything was good. The meat dish, while not spicy hot, was pepper hot. A nice touch.\n\nThe Injera (bread) was a bit more sour than I've had at other restaurants. I quite like this variety. \n\nWe ordered the Ethiopian stout. It's the mildest stout I've ever tasted. If you like dark beers but not stout, give this one a try. I'm definitely looking out for it. Water came in a traditional water bottle (think 1920's America) which kept the water very cold. \n\nService was very prompt and attentive. The bill was a bit more than the normal Ethiopian at $25 for 2, including alcohol. Hardly expensive for a nice and very filling meal.", "author": "Alyson A."}

I love that the beef entrees traverse the spectrum from tartar to rare (and some of that well-done stuff too if that's what you're into), and the Samusas are a great start, but be careful because the main courses are copious.  Average price of a meal (without drinks and apps) is under ten dollars.\n\nI have eaten just about everything on the menu and have never found anything I didn't like.  I even like the okra, and I DON\"T LIKE OKRA. Tej (Ethiopian honey wine) by the carafe is a good deal, and the cold sweetness is a great balance to the savory, spicy food.  They carry Ethiopian and Eritrean beers, but I wouldn't recommend them.\n\nThe folks running the restaurant are kind and welcoming and the food comes fast and hot.  The restaurant is long and narrow, the main dining room dominated by a gorgeous wood bar that is tragically underutilized, and the tables are pretty standard, except for the shaved and painted animal skins sandwiched under Plexiglas.  I think they're cute, but some vegetarians I have dined with found them less than appetizing.\n\nI will always cherish the night I took my three (female) roommates here and while buzzed and bored following dinner, I utilized the Tej cork, candle, and wall length mirrors to give myself a dashing charcoal mustache, and then proceeded to talk all three of my lovely companions into impromptu facial hair which they wore proudly out for ice cream.", "author": "Quinn S."}

Want to nearly guarantee your chances of getting laid?  I'd say you have about a 100% chance of getting laid after taking a first date here.*  (see disclaimer below)\n\nIf you haven't been here before, you should seriously ask yourself why the hell you haven't checked it out yet.  This is one of the raddest restaurants in the Inner Sunset.  It will be OK - you don't need to be scared of the strange Eritrean restaurant any more.  I am your friend, and I will talk you through this:\n\nSo why is this place so rad?  The food is tremendous, they offer a nice selection of \"unusual\" drinks, and the service is way above average in terms of attentiveness and friendliness.  Even better because the vast majority of the rice and potato eating crowd in the neighborhood is far to dull to try something different - you won't need  a reservation.\n\nWhen dining for two your orders are brought out on a round circular dish similar to a pizza pan.  A slice of Ethiopian/Eritrean bread called injera is laid down first and both entrees are served on the injera and split down the center.  If you haven't been before I suggest ordering the Kitfo (a steak tartar that I usually order rare, but is also available raw) and either the vegetable combination or the mushroom dish.  Remember, if you aren't wierd you'll probably be sharing your entree with your date - so this way you get the best meat entree and a vegetable dish to compliment it.  \n\nTo compliment these excellent selections for your entrees (the Kitfo?  Nice choice man!)  I'd suggest to you that the honey wine OR the ethiopian stout or porter will pare up naturally.  If you or your super-hot (and by now impressed) date like sweet wines - the honey wine is the way to go.  Besides, this is the only way to absolutely insure that you will get laid afterwards... so take notes: Kitfo, Vegetable combo or Mushrooms, honey wine or porter or stout. \n\nOk, you're doing good so far.  \n\nNext thing you need to know is that you eat Ethiopian/Eritrean food with your hands - no utensils.  Now this might seem scary at first, but trust me - it makes eating out just a little more fun - just remember to be a decent person and wash your hands after you go to the bathroom: you and your date will have plenty of time afterwards to make \"direct\" genital to mouth contact if you choose to - so for now, be a gentleman and wash your damn hands.\n\nOk, by now you and your date have completely enjoyed your meal.  The Kitfo has been completely cleaned out.  The injera is nearly decimated.  Your date is feeling slightly intoxicated by your awesomeness (with help from the honey wine), and now can't wait to get you home where she can rip off your clothes.  I'm going to let you figure out this next part by yourself.  I will, however, wish you good luck!  No need to thank me.\n\n* Only applies to first dates.  Results may vary.

The well-worn menus are limited but extremely delicious. The veggie combo plate is a steal at $10, and the meat combo plate is only $10.50. I was also glad to note that they don't put their clarified butter in ANY of the veggie dishes, which makes ordering easier for the vegan or dairy-allergic among us. despite the warnings of other reviews, i ordered one of the lighter eritrean beers and I thought it was delicious. \n\nThe service is wonderful considering there is sometimes only one person serving all of the dinner patrons and anyone sitting at the lovely and tragically underused bar. Even if you never knew New Eritrea years ago, this restaurant will welcome you with open arms, make you feel right at home, not make fun of you if you mispronounce Eritrea (didn't even know this was a possibility until i witnessed it on my last visit here), and serve you delicious food at extremely reasonable prices. a great spot for a low-key weeknight dinner, or a festive friday night affair that makes use of the full-service bar. either way, New Eritrea will not disappoint.\n\nupdate: ok, now that i've been eating eritrean food for a few more years, i have to say that the injera at new eritrea is really pretty bad. it's unfortunate, b/c the rest of the food is tasty, but without good injera it's all kind of ruined.", "author": "Jessica C."}

If you dine in - the service is good and prompt.  If you pick up - the service is lightening fast.  \n\nOur favorite is to order one of the two vegetarian combos. One includes okra, which I'm not a fan of, but you can ask to swap out anything with double of another.  The injira is good - a bit more vinegary than some places, but still a nice balance with the food.  The chickpeas are super tasty, but sometimes over pureed - good thing the Injira is such a great way to eat food!  \n\nWe've tried a couple of the meat dishes and are usually very pleased.  The chicken and lamb dishes are nice and tender.  The only disappointment I've had was with the beef kitfo - flank steak chopped to ground beef consistency with too much oil for my taste.  That being said - for the number of times we've eaten here - the place as a whole is definitely a favorite!\n\nA word of warning about Injira - don't eat it with beer!  As a spongy bread, it will expand with the carbonation!  Not a pleasant feeling on a full stomach :)", "author": "Lisa B."}

Our waiter was very nice and made some great recommendations.  Not to mention he patiently explained how to eat the food by scooping it up with the flatbread.  The experience of actually eating the food was fun in and of itself.  It's like we got to play with our food and no one yelled at us for it.\n\nWe tried the meat combination platter which consisted of zigni, zebhi dorho, and allicha bagee.  All were delicious and just the right amount of spiciness for my tastes.  My favorite was the zigni...the sauce was so good!  We also ordered the meat sambusa (meat eggroll) and the tumtumo (purred lentil beans) and loved both of those as well.\n\nUnrelated to the food, halfway through our dinner an angry drunk came stumbling into the restaurant screaming obscenities at everyone.  Something to the effect of, \"Where's your fucking maestro motherfucker!\"  Uhhhh...what??\n\nOur waiter handled him really well and called the cops.  As we were walking along Irving after our meal, we spotted him on the street being questioned by cops with his girlfriend sobbing next to him and one of his flip flops in the middle of the road.  Gotta love Friday nights.\n\nANYWAY.  To summarize my long novel of a review, I highly recommend New Eritrea and will definitely be returning.\n\nIf you've read this far along, I give you 5 stars.", "author": "Christine C."}

And this was exactly what we got! Now - don't get me wrong, I LOVE Assab but they are closed on Sundays and usually entail a long anticipated wait to get your dish. So we chose New Eritrea. \n\nYes the service is alot better. The smiles are still there, but we never had to ask for water or more napkins. We did have to order yogurt sauce as the dish we got didn't come with it. We got our check in a timely manner even tho all the serving and waiting was provided by one guy. \n\nWe order the veggie sambusas, meat combo, veggie combo, and the new eritrean chicken special, for three peeps. It was the perfect amount of food for under $40. We also noted that the hot pepper kick that makes us sweat beads and reach for tissues wasn't as bad here, so we could have easily gone without the yogurt sauce.\n\nThe decor was dimly lit, romanty, and we sat in the back that has the glass ceiling. The front has a basket weave themed bar, that I'm sure could accomodate larger groups than Assab could.\n\nGosh, I'm sorry New Eritrea that you get compared so much but there aren't many places like you. I hope to see you again! \n\nAlways, \nDanielly\n\nP.S. I think its sad seeing how yelpers here say samosas instead of sambusas. Its like saying Eritrean is like Ethiopian.

The staff here is so amazingly friendly, you'll feel right at ease once you step through the front door, even if you're apprehensive about giving Eritrean a try.  If you're unsure of what to order, definitely take the lead from your waiter, that's what we did.  We ended up getting a vegetable dish and a lamb dish and thought it was so jam-packed with flavor and spices and oomph!\n\nTo complement our dishes, we sipped on some Eritrean-style coffee all throughout our meal and man, talk about full-bodied goodness of wonderment!!  That coffee was uber-strong and packed a flavor punch!  (I just got a vision of the red Kool-Aid Pitcher bursting through a brick wall, saying \"Oh yeaaahhh!\", only instead of holding a pitcher of the red stuff, he's toting a carafe of New Eritrea brewed coffee.

My vegetarian aunt likes to restaurant shop, looking at about 10 before deciding to go back and read the menus of a couple. For some reason this makes me insane. I should be more patient with my dear Aunt. But anyway, we walked pretty far down Irving from 9th (well 3 or 4 blocks) and found this place. I put my foot down. The bar looked so welcoming, and the colors were bright and inviting. \n\nI got the most popular dish (the menu said), which was chicken with barbeque-like sauce. It was two chicken legs arranged side by side with a huge - where did they get that chicken?? - hard boiled egg between them. Have you ever had a warm hard boiled egg with barbecue sauce? It's actually not half bad... at all. The sauce is truly amazing and goes wonderfully with the spongy all purpose use-as-a-napkin-or-any-utensil bread which lines the plates and fills the basket they bring to your table. It's actually like a massive crepe. This is making me hungry.", "author": "Roxmarie M."}

That, when it comes down to it, is what makes this food so special and sets this restaurant apart.  It has a certain sourdough-like tang that is missing from other imitation injera.  Has something to do with the grains used and how they make it. \n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful.  The space is open, light and airy and they have decorated it with photos and crafts from Eritrea.  Never had a problem finding a table - infact it usually seems pretty empty.

Of the veggies, J and I agreed that the hamli (collard greens) and shiro (split peas) were the best. The potato dish was cold when it was served to us, and the lentil (or was it chickpea) puree was bland and lacked texture.\n\nThe injera was definitely something I had never experienced before.

We learned some Eritrean history - and found out he's the only US importer for the Eritrean national beer they serve.\r\n\r\nFrom first impression, its kinda like Indian food in the textures and serving style of the dishes (without the rice).

Please note:\n\n1) If you don't like the taste of sourdough bread, you probably won't like most Ethiopian food - their stews are almost always served inside a large round crepe made of injera that tastes like the inside of a sourdough loaf.  \n\n2) If touching your food/eating with no utensils freaks you out, you are a wuss & hypochondriac, and this place probably isn't for you.  There are no utensils - you rip off pieces of the injera crepe and dip it in the stew.  \n\n3) Lighting in the restaurant is dim, which some people find sexy, and others find horrifying or claims it gives them migraines.

I say this because New Eritrea is a great restaurant to ease a newbie into this bold culinary realm.  Thats not to say that New Eritrea lacks authenticity, like one of those places that falls between what it should be and what the owners think people would want.  Like P.F. Changs or something.  This is NOT the case here.\n\nWhether you have a favorite Eretrian dish, or know nothing about it, getting the vegetable AND meat combo dishes is really the best way to sample the plethora of their offerings.  Everything I have sampled has had good, deep, rounded flavor, and their injerea bread is just perfectly tart and springy.

I am a HUGE fan of kitfo (leb leb (rare))... and I have tried almost every Ethiopian restaurant in the South Bay and now I'm moving my way up the peninsula.  I know that Eritrean food isn't necessarily \"Ethiopian\" food, but it's pretty darn close. The kitfo was a little bit spicier than the others I have tried, but definitely hit the spot.  It was great! They did serve it in a bowl, and I would have preferred that they just slid it off onto the injera like they do at other restaurants, but this is no big deal, because I scooped it all myself.  \n\nThe water bottles that they provide at first are pretty nifty than having to wait for the server each time your glass goes empty.  Also, the service was great! We had the same server twice and he was very friendly and definitely checked up on us.  One thing I did notice was that the injera wasn't as thick as I'm used to.  It was almost crepe like.. even perhaps a little bit thinner and it tore pretty easily when scooping up food, but if you're watching your carbs, you might actually consider the thinner injera a blessing... but come on, who really goes out for Ethiopian/Eritrean when you're on a diet? \n\nThere is a fixed \"meat combo\" of 3 items, so you get the same things over and over... I would prefer the \"pick 3\", but... overall things were great. As Ah-nold says, \"I'll be back!\"\n\nBottom line: good food, great atmosphere, great service.", "author": "Buck T."}

Only $16/person incl tax and tip (but not drinks).  Not bad at all.   I will definetely go there again, since it's the closest Ethiopian to my place.  \n\nFor the newbie:\n** You'll want to wash your hands before and after the meal.\n** The food is deceptively filling, especially when you consider that you're eating the injera it's sitting on.\n** Get extra napkins!

The kitchen rarely has an off night and the service is always super friendly and attentive. The food is incredibly flavorful and expertly seasoned AND a lot of bang for your buck. Get the Gored Gored or the Kitfo and it's the equivalent of getting a huge yummy steak for only 10 or 12 bucks. The Kitfo is my personal fave- raw or rare ground beef served in clarified butter with lots of excellent East African spices and a little yogurt on the side. Mmmmmmmm!!\n\nIf you are looking for some veggie options, the Shiro (spicy garbanzo puree) is tasty and the mushroom dish is divine- super spicy!\n\nI personally think that Eritrean cuisine tends to be more flavorful (+ spicy!) and interesting than Ethiopian and New Eritrea is the most consistent and yummy Eritrean around (Assab is great too but not quite as consistent and the service there is always painfully slow). The music here is often great too- lots of fab Ethiopian (they often play discs from the Ethiopques series!) and East African stuff.\n\nThe only downside is that when they are busy, the food can take a while so be sure to get a cheap beer on tap and an appetizer to hold you over. The sometimes slow service is forgivable since damn, there is only one person in the kitchen cooking all that food!\n\nI absolutely adore this place. The food is always so tasty that I eat until I'm about to explode, the servers are super sweet, the injera is always fresh and tangy and the ambiance is dark and cozy.

On the same piece of injera (bread/pancake) was also some sort of spinach side dish, that was similarly tasty.  My companions, who had never had Ethiopian food before, were similarly pleased.

It's all about the clean jazz hands at this dining establishment...\n\n\n\nThere were 8 fabulous yelpers at dinner that night and while waiting for the whole party to show up, we started off with the meat something or other appetizers.  Ah yes, the fresh Eritrean hot pockets, as I shamelessly like to call them. Crunchy meat filled goodness.  Matthew S. suggested we begin the Friday night festivities with their honey wine.  A sweet sweet nectar.  Just the way I like it.  But I was also craving a stronger drink and Keane and I found our way to the bar and ordered a Kettel One and soda, to which the bartender/waiter replied, 'Oh I've never heard of that combination before'. 'Oh really, hmmm, that's strange. Well, I guess you learn something new everyday.' I started wandering off to look at pictures while he continued to make our drinks, and when I turned back around I saw him pouring Kahlua into two glasses! 'Oh No! I'm sorry, I said Kettel One, the vodka, and soda.'  He started laughing and said, 'Oh hahahhaa no wonder I thought it was such a strange drink!'  He then prepared the drinks the proper way but gave us the Kahlua and soda anyhoo - which turned out to be good! Tasted like a bubbly chocolate milk drink!\n\nAnd then came time for us to order our entrees.  At first we weren't quite sure how to go about  ordering our meals.  Being major carnivores, we decided to get the meat combination platter and threw in a vegetarian dish just to mix things up. Ah yes. Meat. Meat meat meat. I very much enjoyed the beef dish, as it reminded me of my mother's home-cooked meals. No, she's not Eritrean, but I guess her cooking is? The chicken, well at least the sauce, was excellent! I don't think I ever got to really try the chicken because unfortunately I was sitting on the boys side of the table and the gobbled everything up. Bastards. The third type of meat was lamb, which I could care less about.  And the vegetable was a sauteed spinach mixed up in some flavorful sauce. I'm still craving that. Mmmmmm...\n\nOh and a big big plus - the waiters are always smiling and are so friendly!  Part of the eating experience is the emotional connection and smiles always make me happy!\n\nHurrah!", "author": "Aim E."}

We got the vegetable sambusa which would have been good if it hadn't been oozing oil down my hand with each bite. After getting fed up with the noxious drip I held it over my plate and gave it a good squeezin'. We read that the chicken drumsticks were the best so we ordered that. I'm not sure if it was just cause I'm an Eritrean food noob or if the kitchen was having an off night, but the injera was painfully sour. There's a different between pleasantly tart and overwhelmingly vinegary.  At first I thought, \"Hm, maybe they seasoned the chicken with vinegar.\" I tried the chicken alone, and it was delicious. I tried the chicken with injera, and all I could taste was sour. I found myself wishing for some good ol' naan bread to eat with instead.", "author": "Skye L."}

REALLY badly...\n\nWe frequent Cafe Ethiopia and always seem to enjoy the food.  I've eaten at a great place in Berkeley as well and so I had high hopes... \n\nSo... We go in pretty early... Around 5:30 on a Thursday, and we were likely the first table of the day.  \n\nThe owner seemed very polite and was quick to give us a nice large cold bottle of water... I thought we were off to a great start...  We order the Veggie Combo and the Meat Combo...  Both of which are supposed to come with a salad.\n\nWhen the food arrives, there are maybe 9-12 SMALL pieces of lettuce in the middle with a few pieces of tomato... I am assuming that their normal salads are more than 4-6 quarter sized pieces of lettuce, but whatever... I'm more excited about the meat/veggie dishes that are on the plate, than I am concerned that we got shafted in the salad category....\n\nSo I start with a veggie one... It's less than luke warm... I move on to the next...  hardly luke warm... the next one has COLD spots... COLD SPOTS.... It was luke warm where it wasn't cold...  And all of the others followed the same suit.... Except for one...\n\nThe lamb dish tasted like it was fresh, and had some VERY good flavors... It was in fact excellent...   \n\nNow... I can accept if a dish is supposed to be room temp... but... this was as if the food was all heated up in the microwave, but just not long enough...  It could have been heated in a pan, but I have enough experience as a cook to know without question that 5/7 dishes we had were in a refrigerator less than 10 minutes prior to hitting our table...  \n\nWe didn't wait for the check, we did the quick math to come to $23.50 for the meal, and handed an even $30 to the owner as we walked out the door (he was also our server)...  He asked if we were in a hurry, and we replied that the food tasted like it had been microwaved, but not enough, and that it was for the most part, totally inedible... He seemed genuinely hurt by the fact that we had had such a terrible experience, but at no point did he say, \"that's impossible, we don't own a microwave\" or \"all of our dishes are prepared fresh\" or anything.... just more like... \"$h*t... I really hope you don't tell people about this... and I'm about to go kill the cook...\"  He did offer to give us our $ back, but I didn't see that as necessary... He has costs to maintain, and me having an extra $30 in my pocket doesn't change anything for me...   Having hot food, or at least tolerably warm food does...  They failed...

It really brought out a different flavor and was a nice change in texture. \n\nThe salad was fine - I was happy it was not drenched with random french dressing. \n\nThe injera was a little dried out on the edges but other than that was good and the amount was just right.\n\nThe service was great, really fast and friendly. The price is very reasonable, they have a full bar and the atmosphere is fine.\n\nThis is the best overall Ethiopian/Eritrean place I've been. I don't know how many times I'll be back since my husband said the beef in his kilwa was tough and chewy (he will never get over Cafe Colucci!).", "author": "Sarah J."}

For the sake of comparison, I ordered the exact same dishes as I had at Axum.  I was pretty surprised that the food tasted exactly the same.  Exactly.  The only difference was that New Eritrea was slightly more expensive and the pancake bread thing at New Eritrea suited my palate better.  It wasn't as sour as the one at Axum.  So if I had to pick one over the other, I would prefer New Eritrea.  Plus the service is friendlier.", "author": "Kandi K."}

I have to say that I'm really beginning to consider Eritrean or ethiopian  food another type  of comfort food for me besides Thai and Vietnamese. Its great to eat with your hands and also having a option to use a fork. The server is also friendly.  Every time you go there, he always has a big smile and very welcoming to all of the customers.\nI don't remember the names of the food I had but I definately had the chicken drumsticks which the menu said it is one of the popular dishes in the restaurant. I love the spices added into it. I also like how they add a salad on the side too. The bread for me is ok because I'm not much of a sourdough type of person, but I still eat it anyways with the dish I order. That's the only sourdough bread that I will ever eat. \nMy friend ordered a fish type dish that he really enjoyed. A perfect place for meat eaters and vegetarians.\nI would definately recommend this place for any one wanting to try something new and exciting. If you don't come out of the restaurant feeling full, the good thing is that you're on Irving street. Hopefully you will want to come back for more like me. : )  the music is also great too.", "author": "Sabrina L."}

It's actually always too much, which is okay, because take home an extra order of the injera and you have lunch for the next day.

If you enjoy trying new exotic cuisines and have not, try this place out right away.  I will agree with Roshni's review: there is NO similarity between indian and eritrean food, except that both use curries to some extent. I'm not sure what the subtle differences are between eritrean and ethiopian, but I do know that Eritrea was colonized by Italy and some of the foods have hints of italian influence.  The staple of the food is a large, flat, spongy bread called injera. You tear off little pieces and use your hands to scoop up bits of tender meats and veggies stewed in a variety of exotic spice-rich sauces based on the main spice which is called berbere.  The place is a bit cavernous inside, adorned with cheesy tourism posters from ethiopia and eritrea and never too crowded. They do have live music sometimes and the honey wine, called Tej, is basically a tasty ethiopian version of manishevitz.", "author": "Rick H."}

Not upscale, but the food is the bomb (a line I often put in my reviews -- I guess I like quirky neighborhood dives with great food).  They aren't afraid to make their spicy dishes spicy, they have a really tasty dark beer that I always get (forgot the name, sorry), the prices are low, the portions are big.  The service is always so warm and friendly it makes me want to travel to Eritrea; they seem like wonderful people.  The music is usually sort of African pop-jazz; it's usually good, sometimes bad, always strange.  Don't be expecting a fine dining experience; the decor is cheesy, the table tops are plastic, and it has sort of a seedy feel to it.

Although the name \"New Eritrea Restaurant\" really didn't stand out in my mind as an overwhelmingly unique venue (maybe because I'm not quite sure about the distinction between new Eritrea and old Eritrea, other than Eritrea used to be a part of Ethiopia so maybe that was the \"old\" Eritrea?), we decided to try it.  We walked into a largely empty restaurant on a Saturday night which usually doesn't bode well, but we ignored the lack of customers, sat down and ordered dinner.  We tried the vegetarian combination platter, the meat combination platter and the Kliwa Begee (lamb strips cooked in an onion and tomato reduction).  The food is served  Ethiopian style on a large platter which everyone shares, family style.  Due to my lack of experience with this food category, I couldn't distinguish the actual difference between Eritrean food and Ethiopian food.  The two lamb dishes (Kliwa Begee and Allicha Bagee) were extremely flavorful and my favorites of the meal.  Overall, the food was very tasty and filling.", "author": "Matt P."}

I thought after discovering the Tea Leaf Salad at Mandalay I'd had most everything new and somewhat esoteric in the city. I was wrong. If you've never had Ethiopian food before - I really don't know how to describe the food or the \"experience\" to you. Hmm...let's start with no silverware (so wash your hands ;-)). Before going, my friend said it's a lot of sauces, meats, veggies, and a very unique flat bread that you dip everything in. That pretty much described it - but doesn't really sell it. Made me think of Indian food. There are definitely some similarities - but honestly, I'd prefer this now. The Samosa-type appetizer we had was good. I loved whatever African beer they'd imported. My friend enjoyed the Honey wine - me? Not so much. But the food was EXCELLENT! And FUN! We had the meat sampler and the veggie sampler but substituted a dish with the okra (it was a TON of food).
