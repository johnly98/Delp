One night, coming back from our friend's place around 1 AM, we decided to drive around SOMA looking for this guy.\n\nWHAT IS THIS THING?  A street vender selling bacon wrapped hot dogs on a cart in the middle of the night.\n\nWHERE?  I found him at the Corner of Folsom and 6th at 1 AM.  However, based on other reviews, he could be anywhere near a club.\n\nHOW MANY CARTS?  Unknown.  Comparing the picture I took with the one posted by Eric W., there seems to be more than one cart.  The two pictures show that the cart and the guy are clearly different, yet they must coordinate their business, seeing that they use the same brand of aluminum foil, cook the bacon hot dog in the same way, and have the exactly same condiments (grilled onions, mayo, pepper, ketchup, and mustard).  I wanted to ask him more questions, but his English was poor and my Spanish is worse.\n\nPRICE:  $3 per dog.\n\nANY GOOD?  Well, rationally speaking, NO, it is cheap standard hot dog with bacon.  Only unique part is the wrapped bacon, but it was high fat bacon that only increased fat content.  Buns are standard cheap kind you buy at Safeway.  No gourmet stuff here.\n\nBEST IN THE CITY?  Again, NO.  During normal business hours, you could get far better hot dogs at various places around the city.\n     \nSO WHY A GOOD RATING?  This is what is so COOL about Yelp.  Zagat would never give a Hot Dog Cart a high rating.  Look, where else would you go at 2 AM for some hot dogs?  Seven-Eleven?

The thought of eating pork wrapped in pork brought an irresistible craving. (Don't judge...)\n\nWe drove around searching for the cart for about 10 minutes before finally spotting it in that one corner of Mission and 23rd street, right by the home of the heart-attack-inducing Tortas Cubanas. When we finally spotted it, my heart skipped a beat. (If you have trouble finding the cart, forget the fact that he's right on Mission St between 23rd & 24th next to \"That's It\" - just look for the bright white light emanating from the cart that gets more brilliant the longer you stare.) Being the ladylike person that I am, I took exactly 2 seconds longer than the boy to scarf down my bacon dog. And then, seconds. \n\nThat's how good it was.\n\nI asked my husband afterwards whether or not he was ready to stop eating pork at the cost of keeping a pig as a pet. His response was, \"No! But I'll tell Corky pig stories before bed, walk him around the neighborhood, and teach him tricks.\" \"What tricks?\" I replied. \"Sit, stay, roll over, and play bacon. They're really smart. You should watch that video on YouTube.\" Nice.", "author": "Asha S."}

Mmm the grilling meat + onions..unbeatable. I've always held out though, and refused to eat it until I was actually in the Mission - Hey, the 7x7 list says I need to have the bacon wrapped hot dog from the Mission, so who am I to shirk on the experts? Even though, I know, it's probably the same regardless of whether I get it in North Beach or Fidi or Soma or Union Square or even LA.\n\nWell...I made it to the Mission and found one of these carts set up outside of Mission Chinese food. Pretty smart on their part, I'd have to say, since all the hungry people waiting outside for a table now had something to tide them over. $3 for a hot dog, and really good service from the vendor, who offered us hand sanitizer, and even cut the hot dog in half for my friend and I to share.\n\nIt's just unfortunate that the taste isn't as good as the smell or the service or the hype. There is only one piece of bacon wrapped around the hot dog, and you seriously can't even taste it. I wish it had a more pungent flavor, or was crispier or something so you could tell you were actually eating bacon! The hot dog was also not so good. I know, I've been spoiled by good hot dog places like Top Dog or Rosamunde's, or even Costco/those \"gourmet\" hotdog packs they sell from Safeway. But this hot dog had no flavor and was not juicy and did not have that hard crispy shell. Boo. The bun was the normal kind you buy from the grocery store too.

An obvious example of this has to be the following story of my experience with the \"Bacon Hot Dog Cart\" in San Francisco.\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to be quite the social dipsomaniac. I had an insatiable craving for alcohol beverages as long as there was a party. I was a freakin' drunken mess, with great hair, dressed like a drug addict, partied like a rock star and bragged about all of it. In other words, I was a prettier version of Ke$ha.\n\nAfter a long of partying in San Jose, I received a phone call from some friends and they asked me to come up to San Francisco since there was some super awesome secret party with drinks, drugs, and dames. Being young and dumb, I stopped playing my buzzed game of Madden. I quickly brushed my teeth (with Crest and not Jack) and started driving to San Francisco.  \n\n(Please note that I may or may not been slightly impaired. Please do not try this at home. In fact, stay home. Do not drink and drive. It's pretty much stupid and irresponsible. Clearly, drinking yourself to oblivion, staying home, and drunk dialing your coworkers is the smarter and much more responsible thing to do.)\n\nAbout 45 minutes later (and 57 texts from my friends mentioning booze, blow, and babes), I am exiting into San Francisco. At this point, I am sobering up and starving. I spot the Bacon Hot Dog Cart and I feel as I found water in the desert.\n\nI buy one and it's delicious. It's piping hot wiener wrapped in bacon and shoved in between some buns slathered in lubricating condiments. It truly is the San Francisco treat. I loved it so much that I wanted even more hot wieners in my mouth, so I ordered two more. Please don't judge me. Sometimes, you feel the need to \"Express Yourself\" and plus, \"I Was Born This Way.\" Wait. That is the same song, right?\n\nAfter devouring three heavenly bacon hot dogs, a bag of Lay's sour cream and onion chips, and a diet Pepsi - I completely forgot about the party, drove home, and fell asleep. Essentially, I drove a combined 90 minutes in order to eat 3 bacon hot dogs from a food cart in San Francisco. People don't even drive that much for booty calls to please their loins. But I drive that long to please my stomach.\n\nIn the end, it was delicious, inexpensive, and so worth it.", "author": "Archie G."}

Also, to be fair, there should be a phyllo dough wrapped tofu pup meatstitute cart as well. And I'm flexible about the morningstar farms cart. Just to not be a dick, you know.

Last one I had prior to this past weekend was back in LA after catching a Lakers' game at Staples Center (very nice venue by the way). That dog was amazing, and I wasn't even drunk either.\n\nFast forward to this past Saturday. It was roughly 2:30, when all hope for trying one of these was fading due to the fact that some friends and I were still trying to leave the SoMa area. By 2:40, our only hope was to swing by Bruno's, only to find out the cart was not there. Tear.\n\nBut wait! Some sort of grilling device and two people were hiding behind the bus stop. This led to promptly pulling over and running across the street. Considering there were 4 of us, they still had 6 dogs going on the grill. Success. I paid my 3 bucks and downed it within minutes. All in all, it doesn't compare to the LA dog, but it'll do.

I immediately run up to him and tell him how much I love him and how much I love sausage and bacon and hot dogs. I order one and scarf it down. It's soooo tasty and all I can think is, I already finished it?? No way! So of course, I order another one. My friends covered theirs with tons of toppings and didn't taste the bacon apparently.

I don't dare eat a deep fried snickers and I didn't feel good eating a border dog.\n\nThe end,", "author": "Krissy M."}

We had just arrived in town after twelve hours of driving from Seattle en-route to Arizona so, needless to say, we were exhausted.  As tired as we were, however, we were still craving something as unhealthy, decadent, and morally reprehensible as a bacon-wrapped hot dog.  Such is the life of sinners.\n\nWe drove down each numbered street for twenty minutes, eventually (and just barely) spotting our target near 16th and Valencia.  We spent another twenty minutes trying to park, unable to muster up the cajones to park in the middle of the street like everyone else seemed to be doing.  You have to understand that, from our Arizonian-perspective, those lanes are for turning.\n\nShort story long, we added an hour to an already brutally long day just to fill our stomachs with poison and it was worth every bloody second.", "author": "Robert A."}

The server toasted my bun for a minute, then loaded it up with an oily hotdog link wrapped in bacon, and added on some of those browned onions and ketchup, mustard, and mayo.  Well, the regular hot dog part tasted like a typical hot dog.  But then I'd get these chewy pieces of bacon-y fat in my mouth, which is a real kicker!  Bacon being rather hard to incise, and the bacon strips being rather long and uncut, it's hard to separate the bites to have even chunks of bacon in each bite.  So every now and then I'd get a long chunk of bacon between the choppers.  Definitely worth chewing the fat and savoring it in the mouth.  So be careful not to swallow too fast.  You'll finish it faster than you think, and be thinking about getting another one after you've walked just a block down from the cart.", "author": "Gerald C."}

The bacon hot-dog cart really is the second-best restaurant in San Francisco. Not quite the culinary nirvana that is first-place winner La Palma Mexicatessen, of course -- but appreciably more exquisite than third-place Gary Danko.\n\nI mean, granted, Gary Danko's wine list may be a little more extensive, its tablecloths a touch more plush, its artisanal cheese cart just a smidge more, um, artisanal. But the true gourmand will note that Danko's pancetta-wrapped frog legs fall just shy of the gustatory gold standard set by those two surly dudes doling out mystery meat from behind the stainless steel cart on 16th Street. \n\nStill, I can't help but wonder whether there might be a slight shake-up in Yelp's Top Five if a higher percentage of users were SOBER when they wrote their restaurant reviews.

I was with Meemeers, BK, Los and a couple of other people in front of Cat Club on a week night many moons ago.  I remember it clearly but unfortunately I was sober and way too scared to even take a small bite. It all looked so wrong . . . so very very wrong. I mean the thing was screaming heartburn at me and I was not brave enough to take the plunge right then and there.  Plus, BK wanted me to get in the car immediately as he usually does when we are out and about parading thought the dark nights of San Francisco. I didn't really get enough time to evaluate the entire situation and  back in those days I was more of a street cart food vendor virgin who needed more information before making a final decision. I clearly remember watching them all closely as they literally went for there's and after each bite they would all turn to me with big smiles and say, \"okay, take a bite.\" \n\nIt took some time but luckily one very special night about a year later I found myself in front of Cat Club once again and gently took a few steps to the cart. I said hello and introduced myself to the fellows cooking it up and they proceeded to hand me the most amazing meal I have ever had in my life.  I say meal because you get your carbs, protein and veggies all in one lump drenched in mayo, ketchup and mustard. And I gotta hand it to them because to this day I have never had a bad dog at one of the many carts in the city. \n\nEvery time it's perfection!  Time after time I'm satisfied entirely and I even carry a picture of a Hot Dog Cart on my phone so I can look at them all lined up and looking all cute from time to time. Oh, and I have to add that I do not have the ability nor am I strong enough to walk away from the cart. No matter how long the wait or dangerous the situation I'm down for my dog!

With Keane as my sidekick, we tracked down the MAN.  It was a glorious site and smell to behold.  Let's be frank...when you're a little intoxicated and your last meal was 6hrs ago, just about anything is going to satisfy your hunger.  Bacon wrapped hot dog definitely hits the spot under these conditions.  Grilled on a baking sheet, the tasty treat is covered in grilled onions, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and jalepenos.  Believe the stories...it is delicious.  However, while most reviewers will let their intoxication decide on a 5-star rating, I have to deduct some points.  I know, blasphemy.  Personally, I like my bacon crispy.  I couldn't tell if it was one or two pieces of bacon wrapped around it, but we could barely taste the flavor of the bacon.

If you can match these requirements 5 stars!", "author": "Fatty A."}

I stepped out of the Kat Club and the cold air hit me like a bad dose of meatloaf.  As my friends gather themselves attempt and to leave, an odor of angelic porportions wafts into my immediate area.  What can it be but a hotdog wrapped in bacon and covered in grilled onions.  I quickly dismiss this atrocity as I do not eat pork but my thoughts quickly fade into a melange of gin and cheap whiskey.  As I stand there wondering how I'm getting home a friend puts forth this delicious looking item into my peripheral vision.  The drunk munchies take hold and I engorge myself.  The savory hot dog is tamed by the sweetly caramelized onions, while the ketchup and mayonaise conduct a tasty tap dance in conjunction, complementing thier masters.  One day later I am told I've eaten pork, and if it wasn't for how good it was I would be mad.  Damn those things are good and not even my hatred for pork can keep me from stating that.

Okay, I agree... unhealthy, cheap hot dog and bun, drenched in reused oil, no food inspection... but CRAP, they taste darn good. I even ate these hot dogs sober (yes, I noticed everyone talking about eating those hot dogs after a drunk night out), during the middle of the day after passing 5 carts while walking down Mission St for several blocks to visit a friend after attending the Carnival festivities... I initially thought, this is extremely unhealthy and is a floodgate for atherosclerosis. But after passing by a few carts, I couldn't deny my craving. They are amazingly good! Yup, they are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced, but whoever thought up the idea to bring out hot dog carts sizzling with such an entrancing aroma late at night when all of the Mission is inebriated is just genius. Why give it 2 stars??? Because I know there are healthier alternatives that taste better! I'm addicted b/c of the unhealthy aspect and my craving during such an inebriated state of mind. Besides, my 2 stars will do nothing compared to the hundreds of other 4-5 stars that this \"place\" is receiving.", "author": "Ju S."}

The bacon dogs also keep your hands full which is invaluable in keeping you from taking out your cell phone and drunk dialing random girls you haven't talked to in two years or worse texting them asking them  to call you up so that they of course can come over to your place to have a threesome with the other girl you drunk dialed because that happens all the time right.

I had to click on the review.  I had my first \"dirty dog\" in LA after going to the bars on Sunset one night.  (Bad night, some girl I didn't know threw up on me, but the bacon dog made it better!!).  So, ever since I read those reviews, I decided I really missed those bacon dogs!  I ended up going to a birthday party at Club Icon last friday.  I had just gotten my massive tattoo filled and it was hurting like crazy.  (I had to drive like an old woman, I couldn't even lean back!)  I really did not want to be at the club and was not a happy camper.  So a few hours later, I'm outside with some friends who were smoking.  So I'm sitting there all crabby when I smell....BACON!?  I looked around and saw the bacon dog cart!  Just a few feet away from the entrance to the club!  Hooray!  I bought one and ate that dog with a quickness since I had no time for dinner before the club.  That bacon dog made my day.  Guess what...there was another bacon dog cart just down the street near the corner!  TWO CARTS within a block's radius!", "author": "Cheryl L."}

This is the place you have been searching for (although they move from time to time, but basically in the same area). A bacon dog is basically bacon wrapped in a hotdog together with some onions, jalapenos, mayo, ketchup and mustard. You're imagining it right now, are you? This is late night snacking at its best although vegetarians would disagree. However, it can be difficult to keep your appetite once you get a whiff of the people around you who are mostly drunk at this time of night. What this place serves, it serves well but don't be expecting too much. After all, this is still a hotdog stand in the middle of the night serving food that you can make in your own kitchen.", "author": "Alexander L."}
