We ordered an app to share and our own mains. They also have a tasting menu which is 7 courses for $93. There's a more expensive option which is 10 courses.\n\nUNI CREME BRULEE to start. Ok this thing is $25 and like others said, it is very very tiny. Delicious, but tiny. The oval dish is around 3x1.5 inches. In the pics, it looks much larger, at least 3x the size. Just be aware of that when you order. The creme brulee was topped with uni and 3 types of roe. The creme brulee part itself is also very uni flavored. They definitely mix in some uni in there, so you're not only getting a mediocre creme brulee topped with uni. Although small, I'd recommend this dish because it's so unique!\n\nSCALLOP & PORK BELLY comes with 1 scallop and 1 small piece of pork belly. It is tiny, but the scallop is very tasty with a seared outside and not overcooked.\n\nMUSHROOM PAPPARDELLE housemade pasta with yummy mushrooms and veggies. This dish was creamy and tasty would recommend it if you're in the pasta mood.\n\n14 OZ WAGYU RIBEYE holy hell this was soo tasty. Cooked to perfection the meat was really fat and marbled. I dream to go back and eat this steak again. This is the reason I'm giving this place 5 stars. I'll be back again to try the tasting next time!!", "author": "Jessica L."}

Get it! \n\n+: fresh pasta. You can taste the difference \n\n+: when they get our order wrong and served the wrong pasta dish, they served the right order quickly after and comped us the wrong serving \n\n-: small portions. Everything is pretty over-priced. \n\n-: When asked casually if we wanted bread after we had placed our order and before they served our food, we said yes... only to find out on the bill that the bread is $6 charged to us as opposed to being complimentary like most other restaurants. The bread was warm, served with regular butter... nothing to write home about. I'd recommend to skip it. \n\n-: the service left so much to be desired... and I can't describe why. the chef came by to say hi after our meal, which was a lovely gesture. The empty dishes were taken away quickly and the service was prompt. However our waiter just didn't seem to enjoy his job one bit. I hope he has a better day there tomorrow. \n\nWe generally liked their appetizers more than other things on the menu. Pretty creative dishes. Hope the execution could be better. For example the lobster ramen sounded amazing, and we see lobster meat in it. However the noodles and broth both could be improved, and we strangely could not taste the lobster/seafood at all since they added very overpowering smoked bacon bits in there. The lobster meat was also over cooked. \n\nIf we are back in the neighborhood again, we will drop by for the uni creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.", "author": "Joyce H."}

We both got the tasting menu with wine pairing. It was incredible, and the most enjoyable, impressive tasting menu experience I've ever had. Dishes were interesting, new flavor combinations and tastes while still being absolutely delicious and executed beautifully. Sometimes I feel like tasting menus do weird combos \"just because\", but end up with something I wouldn't really want to eat more of. Not so here. \n\nStandouts were the uni creme brulee, the pork belly and scallop (perfectly cooked), the foie gras and the duck breast. The foie blew my mind. The uni blew my husband's. I also really loved the combo of pickled fennel and the rich curry-like sauce with the grilled octopus, the hamachi was wonderfully tender in the crudo to start. They were very accommodating and allowed us to swap out the ravioli and dessert for fritters and cheese instead, and we added on the foie. All wines went very well with the dishes, were good pours, and service was excellent. \n\nCertainly expensive, but 100% worth it in my opinion. Please take my money and stay open and keep doing wonderful things. My husband says easily this was a top 5 meal of all-time. I think it was the best meal I've had in SF hands down. We will be back :)", "author": "Cat G."}

My parents are very traditional chinese and not very accustomed to western fine dining cuisine.

We came at 8:30pm and because everyone was tired, we shared a few things (2 appetizers & 3 entrees) \n\nPortion sizes were small, but we were satisfied by the end. \n\nThe octopus and hamachi crudo appetizers were tasty. \nThe lobster ramen entree was not so great. it was super expensive and definitely not as good as the ramen you'd get at a ramen shop like ippudo or mensho's.

With that being said, yes my boyfriend and I are getting THIICCCC from eating out so much.\n\nAnyways, we came here on a Thursday night with reservations and I'm happy we did because it was pretty busy. We were seated right away upon arrival, which was nice because we all know there are some places that make you wait an extra goddamn 15-30 mins even with a reservation.\n\nHamachi Crudo: came with 4 pieces. Super flavorful, super delicious, super good. I recommend this as it was light but tasty. \n\nSeared Foie Gras: this is honestly the prettiest dish I've ever seen. Not only was it good, but the presentation was hella pretty... (hella extra with the tiny flowers), but SO beautiful. GET THIS!!\n\nScallop & Pork Belly: the pork belly was nice and tender, but unfortunately our scallop was slightly overdone. I would say give this a try because I remember the last time I came, the scallop was cooked perfectly. A pretty good appetizer if you want a couple of small bites.\n\nUni Creme Brulee: being a fairly small appetizer, we decided to ball out and get 2. One for me and the other one for me lol jk. You can actually taste the uni in this one, which I really appreciate. Overall a well presented and delicious appetizer, but by the size of it, I really can't see people sharing this...\n\nBlack Truffle Ravioli (with added shaved truffles): you HAVE to eat this with your pinky up. The truffle scent is really strong and made me a happy person that night. I do have to say though, the smell is stronger than the taste. Overall a nice dish, but a tad greasy.\n\nParpadelle: I actually enjoyed this a little bit more than the ravioli just because I thought it tasted better. I really like creamy stuff * lol ;) * so this was one of my favorites. \n\nDuck Breast: my boyfriend and I both agreed that this was cooked perfectly, but one thing that was a tad disappointing was the skin. It was soggy and tough, and kind of took away from the wonderful and soft texture of the meat. In my opinion, the duck would be 10/10 if the skin was crispy.\n\nOverall, all of the food was great! I would definitely be back again :)", "author": "Jackie T."}

Absolutely no weird aftertaste and super super tender.\n\n-Duck Breast: So tender and light on the palette, but the sulfurous veggies that paired with it gave it a interesting kick.\n\nOverall, every dish we had was full of contrasting delicious flavors and I can't wait to come back here again.", "author": "Jenny L."}

But it's inevitable that people will find it eventually...\n\nService 4.5/5 - personable and friendly coursing (though they forgot a dish of ours)\n\nValue 4/5 - I mean... you'll prob spend $50-70/person + wine $ depending on your appetite, and portion sizes lean small, so you should set your expectations properly.  You're basically getting elevated, 1-Michelin-star equivalent foods so you're not gonna get that for cheap.\n\nFood 4.5/5 - special shoutouts to the rich foie on toast, the juicy-tender duck breast, as well as the decadent chocolate cake dessert.  OK - lobster not-actually-ramen noodles, scallops and pork belly (wish the belly was a bit more delicate), the pork loin (wish it was a tad less lean), the crudo (would prefer a more delicate taste), and the well-executed but unmemorable almond cake.\n\nFinal score: 4.5/5, rounded up to 5 stars for this lovely li'l spot on the hill!", "author": "J C."}

The service was also very good, but the extra touches for my birthday were a really nice surprise. I thought the personal handwritten birthday card from the restaurant was truly unique.\n\nWe began our meal with the Tartine bread and seasoned butter. If you haven't had the chance to taste Tartine bread, then you haven't truly broke one of the best breads in the pantheon of breads. You should obviously try Tartine bread at Tartine though, just saying....but this will work in a pinch.\n\nNext came the grilled octopus, hamachi crudo, and seared sonoma foie gras. Gosh, each was better than the last. Presentation was beautiful and the taste was exquisite. I particularly loved the floral undertones on the hamachi dish and the texture of the grilled octopus. Up next was the truly memorable uni creme brulee. The caviar, tobiko, and trout roe combined beautifully to provide a briny, yet buttery topping on crispy crostini. To say that this was a must order is an understatement!\n\nFor shared entrees, we went with the maine lobster ramen, the pappardelle, and the grilled duck breast. My favorite was definitely the duck breast which was prepared perfectly. Our table was split on the grilled legumes, but I liked the combination of textures and colors. It was a delicious dish in my opinion. The pappardelle was good, but very rich. The lobster ramen was also good, but probably the least impressive dish of the night in my opinion.\n\nTo round out the night, our table opted for the chocolate souffle tart and butterscotch pot de creme for dessert. Both were absolutely decadent, though I would have much preferred a straight souffle, just saying ;).\n\nAll in all 3rd cousin is an amazing treat for your tastebuds. I will undoubtedly have happy dreams of this tonight!", "author": "Elaine Y."}

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted warmly by the Chef - and there was even a birthday card from the restaurant on my place setting!  \n\nWe opted for the tasting menu and the wine pairing.  Chef Greg Lutes came to our table and asked us if we had any allergies, if there was any food we disliked, etc -- just a personal, extra touch that made us feel special.  My sister being pregnant, he made some adjustments to her tasting dishes - which was pretty awesome.  \n \nMy favorites: the bread/butter, Uni Creme Brulee, Grilled Octopus, and Porcini & Black Truffle Ravioli \"Francese.\" \n\nTo start, the bread is from Tartine Bakery - and as much as I try to not fill up on bread -- I mean hot damn.  It's so good lol...and the butter...I had to force myself to stop.  It's so good! \n\nThe Uni Creme Brulee - I mean it's beautiful.  It's a totally different and unique dish that is absolutely delicious.  This is must try.  It's super famous and popular, I definitely recommend it.  Also a highly IG-able dish lol.  \n\nThe Grilled Octopus - I am not a huge fan of tentacles and am usually freaked out - but this dish is plated so beautifully that I didn't even notice them!  I loved the charred/grilled flavor and the octopus was cooked perfectly.  Also, it was shaped like a heart -- pretty damn cute.  \n\nThe Porcini & Black Truffle Ravioli \"Francese\" - yeah this ravioli is pretty damn good.  Definitely try this, it was one of my favorites and absolutely delicious.  Lots of flavor.  \n\nThe wine pairings were amazing and it's definitely not like some places where they don't really give you enough.  I definitely had more than enough...but in the best way possible LOL.  \n\nOverall -- I LOVED this place.  I can honestly say it was one of the best culinary experiences I've ever had.

We got the uni creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (delicious but much smaller than I was anticipating), bread and butter (great but cost money), scallop and pork belly (again REALLY delicious but smaller than anticipated -- I should mention the pork belly was perfectly crispy and the veggies were the perfect texture), and the pappardelle (SO GOOD! Especially with pancetta. We got the half portion and it was very generous.) Generally my overall impression is that the place is very good although a bit pricy. Everything including two sodas was $100+ and I did not think it was that much food.\n\nThe one thing I really must knock about this restaurant is the service. While everyone appeared attentive enough, the restaurant forgot one of our orders and forgot the order of the table next to us. The lady had been there much longer than us and ordered the same thing as us. However, we got the dish first. Rather than admitting they made a mistake when the lady ask, they told her it takes a long time to cook the dish... ok. Then we got our appetizers but 30+ minutes went by before we got our main. I asked about it and they said it just takes awhile but I could see the waiter go to the back and scramble to figure out what dish we were missing. They were able to turn it around quickly but... they really shouldn't be forgetting orders or it should be obvious we were missing a dish when we had been sitting there for 30+ min with empty plates.

Brought to your table upon request :)\n\n(4/5) Kale Salad: Had to offset these birthday calories with something green. The kale salad did not disappoint! Fresh, seasonal ingredients with a tasty dressing. \n\n(5/5) Uni and Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e (petrossian caviar, yuzu tobiko, trout roe, toast): The crisp toast and caviar provide a fantastic amalgamation of flavors. YOU MUST GET THIS.\n\n(4/5) Grilled Wagyu NY Steak (creamy grits, spinach, pole beans, cippolini, chantrelles): This steak was cooked to medium-rare perfection. I also loved the crunchy pole beans. Not a huge fan of grits but these ones were pretty delish.\n\n(5/5) White Chocolate Bread Pudding: God literally gifted this down from heaven to us mere plebeians.

It was on my list of cool new restaurants to visit that month so I was psyched and ready to stuff myself. The restaurant is in an area where we drove through some pretty narrow streets. (Think streets where one car is able to drive down the street. Yep, that narrow.) The parking situation is pretty much street parking. \n\nUpon walking into the place, I noticed that it seems like a little hole in the wall but done in a very clean and modern way. I loved the large roundish window by the front entrance. There's about 15 small tables with some pushed together to accommodate larger groups. There's also 2 seats at the bar area. We glanced over the menu and noticed it's shared plates, family style. We opted to go a l\u00e0 carte instead of their tasting menu because we weren't interested in some of the dishes. Everything we ordered was to our liking and I feel that this is definitely a restaurant that I could bring friends to for a small group dinner. The pricing isn't too steep either. \n\nPain Bakery Porridge Bread & House Butter : This was complimentary if asked for. I couldn't tell the taste between regular bread and porridge bread, but it was good nonetheless. \n\nCaramelized Brussel Sprouts : These were a good veggie side. Really can't go wrong with Brussel Sprouts. \n\nHamachi Crudo : This was nice. Delicately made and plated. I really enjoyed the sauce it came with and I'm not even a sushi connoisseur. \n\nUni Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9 : This was my must-order. I love my Uni and Caviar and this was the highlight for me. The Uni cream with Caviar slathered on top of the thinly sliced toast was just HEAVEN. This is definitely a dish I can't find anywhere else. Yes, it does look like a small portion. I do wish there was more. \n\nPappardelle : This was on the menu so I had to order it. (Pappardelle and Tagliatelle are my favorites.) This was really creamy and rich; richer than I'm used to. It was ok, but I would probably order something else next time. \n\nMeyer Lemon Pot De Cr\u00e8me : This filled up half the glass jar so it didn't seem like a lot, but when it was just enough as a dessert. It was light and not as creamy as I thought it was going to be. \n\nTruffles : This came complimentary with our bill. It was a nice touch.

You can never reliably schedule your anniversary dinner unless you're the fan of a losing team.  Now with the championship safely in our hands, we ventured out at the end of June for a celebratory dinner.  It took a few turns around the block to find a spot to park, but if you go right around 6:00, during the \"changing of the guard\", it's definitely doable.\n\nIt's a tiny little place, but better than expected acoustics, based on the previous reviews.  We could hear each other most of the time.  Maybe they've put in some sound absorbers, or people were behaving themselves.  As others have mentioned they have personable servers who are knowledgeable and professional, but low key.  Ours was a professional surfer on the side.\n\nHere's what we had.\nStarted with a celebratory glass of Cremant D Loire Brut Rose Premblule, 2014 $15:  dry, but a bit of grape flavor.  liked it.  The list of wines they pour by the glass is pretty limited, but we managed to find a couple of reds that would go with the mix we were having, both pinot noirs.\n\nWe started by sharing Zuckerman's Asparagus Fries with vadouvan-garlic dip $9.00: 4.5 stars.  This was excellent.  The asparagus could have been slightly thinner, although their girth meant that they kept their texture.  The dip was exquisite, garlicky, a little acid, slightly floral, and smoky.\n\nThen of course with my fish egg obsession I had to get the signature Uni Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e petrossian caviar, yuzu tobiko, trout roe, toast, $21: 3.5 stars.  I'm sorry, but it just didn't thrill me.  I loved all the roe, fresh  sweet, briny, excellent popping action. The Cr\u00e8me was not bruleed though, and the custard itself wasn't firm enough for my tastes.  More like the texture of clotted cream.  \n\nBurrata warm blistered padron peppers, brook cherry, pickled cipollini, olives $15, 5.  Seemed like kind of kitchen sink combination, but it totally worked.  Each element held up to the others and the burrata was a perfect texture for the substrate it all rested on.\n\nDuck breast over kung pao vegetables, 4.5.  I don't remember the price, and it's not on the menu anymore. It was an interesting combo.  The duck was slightly under for me, but the I loved the unexpected heat level on the veg.\n\nSeared Sonoma Foie Gras walnut french toast, onion-blood orange jam, huckleberries $27, 4:  The foie was a bit on the small side, but fresh delicious and well prepared, however the combo of the french toast, the jam and the huckleberries accompanying it was overwhelmingly sweet.

The reviews looked good and place seemed right up my alley. I was lucky they could fit us. We decided on the taster menu $93 which included 7 courses. Each dish looks too pretty to eat... but that didn't stop me from cleaning my plate each time. Hamachi crude was perfect, uni creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was very unique... quite heavy but good. Octopus was cooked to perfection and veggies/potatoes completely very nicely with the sauce. The black truffle ravioli was also good but on the heavy side. The duck was very good and sauce had a kick to it. The dessert has lychee ice cream that was very refreshing and the chocolate truffle filled my chocolate craving... Totally worth the $$$. The sparkling Rose at $16/glass was good but pricey.  I would have liked to try the lobster ramen and foie gras but was too full.

This is a hidden, relaxed neighborhood gem that's yet been flooded by foodies -- I do hope they continue to succeed, though for this price I also wish the more average-tasting dishes will be perfected into truly excellent ones.\n\n[What was brilliant]:\n-Fried oysters with a parsnip sauce: the batter was sort of like tempura, and the saucing was earthy, tangy, and impeccable. This was a gem.\n\n-Truffle ravioli: I normally dislike raviolis, but this was better than Quince's headliner pasta dishes, which is saying a lot considering Quince is a 3-star Michelin eatery.\n\n[What was great]:\n-Scallops and pork belly: wonderful mix of crunchy and smokey and sweet.\n\n-Hamachi crudo: one piece I had was slightly less fresh than I'd like, but the tart saucing is complex, perfect, and braided the taste of fresh hand-picked flowers\n\n-Uni creme brulee: I was slightly disappointed (considering the hype) but still, points added for creativity. In the end, I'm not sure this elaborate treatment of uni wins out over just serving fresh unadorned A+ grade uni on its own, but uni will always be good.\n\n[What was average]:\n-Steak rib entree: I found the well-cooked rib to be sort of like okay barbecue, not fine dining, and the rare slice, while good, was sort of small and not very marbled.\n\n-Dessert: the ice cream was nicely sprinkled with a good crunch, but the gingerbread cake was very average.", "author": "Ken H."}

Luckily for us, that was the worst of our symptoms. We came in for dinner on a Friday night around 8pm, and was able to grab the last two seats at the bar. The restaurant was pretty full, so reservations are definitely recommended for weekend nights. Make sure you request the porridge bread and butter, since the portions are on the small side! We tried:\n\n-Hamachi Crudo (Avocado, Fuyu Persimmon, Cranberry-Kosho, Furikake Tuile, Black Garlic, $15, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bwRwCdTayyF0DMD8iuQaiQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): For $15, the pieces of crudo were super thin, and they tasted a bit fishy. We're pretty sure this is what caused the stomach cramps. The flavors were ok, but there was too much going on- I wouldn't get this again.\n-Maine Lobster & Crab Ramen (Bacon, Savoy Cabbage, Tat Soi, Soft Egg, Mesilla, Half Portion/$22,https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xaGfgoAz3W4O7JchOO8S9Q&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): On the bland side, and I didn't like the presentation- I don't think you should call a dish \"ramen\" if the noodles aren't submerged in the soup. The \"soup\" was also too salty- Skip!\n-Uni & Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e (Petrossian Caviar, Yuzu Tobiko, Trout Roe, Toast, $21, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zZIoG35t5JDdN7abY_aLrA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Sadly, overrated for me. I love uni, and I thought the sweetness from the brulee overpowered all the other flavors, including the brininess of the uni- skip!\n-Pappardelle (Di Napoli Squash, Wild Mushroom, Smoked Scamora, Creme Fraiche, Mint, Half/$18, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Pnt6_RjJmjAoQWfzdskrvQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The pappardelle was great, and really fresh tasting. It was cooked perfectly, and I liked the creaminess of the sauce. However, the squash wasn't fully cooked, and the pieces were still crunchy. I would recommend the pappardelle, but not with the squash.\n-Bread Pudding (w/Caramelized Banana, Strawberry Ice Cream, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=FuAu-kkYNTbakIkvnWOpfA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok, and I didn't think all the flavors worked well together in this dish- skip! \n-Complimentary Dark Chocolate Truffles (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PpF6-73PluxXiKEY_d--FA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Good, but not amazing. These were very rich.\n\nThe servers are very friendly, but the service was a little slow (not sure if it's because we were at the bar or not).

It's one of her favorite dishes. When I found 3rd cousin and looked at the menu, I was excited to check them out. I made a reservation for a party of four about a week prior through OpenTable for Tuesday, May 9th at 6:30pm.\n\n*Seared Sonoma Foie Gras ($27): cashew french toast, onion-blood orange jam, huckleberries\n*Grilled Octopus ($16): beets, fennel, sultana-caper emulsion, rocola\n*Scallop & Pork Belly  ($18): rutabega, kumquat, mung bean sprouts, peanut, black vinegar\n*Uni Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e ($19): petrossian caviar, yuzu tobiko, trout roe, toast\n*Special: Pork Pate ($12)\n\nMy favorite app was the uni creme brulee. Great flavor without coming off as fishy. And it was nice and creamy. The foie looked beautiful, but unfortunately it was rather thin and undercooked. It looked like they just lightly seared each side and served it to us. I guess I understand as the piece was so thin, it probably would have melted into nothing if seared any longer. But it was really disappointing as it was rather pricey for the size. The rest of the dishes were good. Not huge portions, so keep that in mind when ordering family style. The scallop and pork belly dish is literally one piece each. Remember to ask for the complimentary pain bakery porridge bread and house butter if you like bread and butter.\n\n*Rack of Lamb ($34): couscous, fava leaf, shakshuka, date & pinenut\n*Grilled Wagyu NY  ($32): crisp polenta, spinach, ramps, cippolini, morels, green peppercorn\n*Grilled Pork Chop ($31): al pastor tamale, bacon braised collards, cherry mole\n\nI don't eat much in one sitting, so by the time we got to the entrees, I was already getting full. I just ended up sampling everything. The steak was my fav, but that's because I love beef. The center slice was perfectly cooked for me as I love a rare steak. The pork actually looked dry at first, but was cooked to a nice medium, so the meat by the bone was super tender and juicy. I had a small piece of lamb and it was cooked nicely as well, but with two pieces, I found the serving to be on the smaller side. Most of the entree dishes I've ordered come with three pieces.\n\n*Angel food cake, local berries, fernet caramel, whipped cream, pine nut brittle, shiso ($9)\n*Cinsault, Dom des Homs, L'Amandier, Coteaux de Peyriac, 2015 ($56)\n*Coffee ($3)\n\nWe only got one dessert as everyone was full by now. It was good sweet ending to our meal. For the wine, we brought a bottle to cork and also ordered a bottle. Corkage is $25 per bottle for the first two, $35 per bottle afterwards. But for every bottle you buy, one corkage fee waived, so we ordered a bottle. I didn't notice until I was writing this review, but the wine was listed for $48 on their menu. We were overcharged by $8 (plus tax, SF Health, etc), so I guess corkage wasn't really free after all. We did get complimentary chocolate truffles with our bill.\n\nI was originally going to give them four stars as we had a good time and our server was amazing. But as I wrote this and recounted their wine list discrepancy and their disappointing foie, I think they deserve three overall.", "author": "Elena N."}

Let's get to the breakdown. \n\nI don't usually start with service, but that's what is top of mind at this spot. And not in a good way. While the hostess was extra bubbly and acknowledged the birthday note included in the reservation upon check-in, that was just about the extent of the jolliness. The waitress and waiter were very serious with my group, and not lively or interactive like they were with the table next to us (also celebrating a birthday). I thought it was so nice that they brought that table a candle with their cake, and thought we'd get the same experience - we didn't. Jokingly, I told the bday girl to blow out the candle on the table to make her wish, which she did. The head chef came by right afterwards, and asked how we were. I responded saying the food was excellent and we were celebrating a bday. He noticed immediately that she didn't get a candle and I told him about the table candle. Instead of bringing something else out to appease the situation or apologizing(?), he said \"oh okay we should have. Hope you had a great dinner\" and quickly walked away. It was very awkward. Still not sure why my table didn't get the same treatment/experience as the table next to us???\n\nBUT aside from service, the food was top notch. Both the hamachi and octopus were good, but the uni creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, truffle mushroom ravioli, and cod entree were EXCELLENT. The uni creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was nothing short of amazing. The perfectly balanced sweet, savory, umami flavors were all on point. The ravioli had just the right amount of truffles (without overtaking the entire dish), and was wrapped in a perfectly al dente skin. Anddd as for the cod. Silky smooth and almost buttery. \n\nThe recommended Chardonnay also paired very well with our dishes. I appreciated the suggestion based on our dishes ordered.

The gal who serves as hostess, runner and bus-er is just lovely. She cleared a better table for me (was dining solo), just because. I was starving so I ordered a glass of rose and my requisite uni creme brulee from her as soon as I sat down and she mentioned that the guy, who doubles as the server and sommelier for every table in the small restaurant, would be with me shortly.\n\nThat's where it went off the rails. I proceeded to watch him check on EVERY other table, sometimes twice or thrice, even exchanging looks with me multiple times as I held my menu, without any hint of him coming to greet me anytime soon. I presume he was ignoring me because he was aware that the lovely hostess had wined and uni'd me and he figured that he'd bought some time because of it.\n\nAt least 20 minutes goes by. My uni creme brulee has been presented and quickly wolfed down. Two nice ladies are sat next to me and are perusing their menus leisurely whilst I continue to stare Mr. Elusive Waiter/Som down with a \"What am I, Chopped Liver?\" look (which by now he's purposefully avoiding). I'd already downed my last sip of wine and taken my credit card out of my wallet, knowing full well this meal was a bust by the time he lowers himself to head in my direction. Guess what he did?\n\nStanding between my table and that of the 2 nice ladies next to me, he goes, \"hello ladies, SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.\" I. JUST. COULDN'T.\n\nI interjected, e-FCKING-mediately, to announce, \"Oh, really? Because I've been sitting here for at least a half an hour and YOU HAVE YET TO EVEN GREET ME.\" He turned my way, tailed tucked between you-know-where-but-not-quite-enough-for-me and whimpered sheepishly,\"Oh yeah, so sorry about that.\" He noticed I had my credit card out and ready to go, and that the Yelp app was open on my iPhone on the table. He followed up quickly with a \"....oh you're ready for the check?\"\n\nOff he ran to fetch my check. I chatted with the two women about the turn of events and they empathized with me. He set my check down like NBD, mentioning he comp'd my rose (like that should make everything all better). And says, \"have a nice night\" (obviously attempting to salvage the perception of the table next to me). I laughed, got up, bid the women next to me a good evening, glowering \"I'm heading to the awesome noodle place next door and will be ordering one of everything.\"\n\nBefore storming out the door, I made a point of handing the lovely hostess a nominal cash tip (which she deserved, and then some). Bottom line: Given that this is essentially a high-end neighborhood restaurant, the chef-owner should evaluate whether his front of house staff is delivering the kind of service that is commensurate with the price-point. \n\nSigned,\nMoving to the Neighborhood and Never Returning", "author": "Melanie D."}

BUT the \"dude\" could have been friendlier and more engaged with his customers.\n\nSo a solid three stars.  Which is good. I am grading this on a grand tasting menu and the basis that you are spending $250 + tax per person on a night out...so three stars is solid. Especially given that the evening is leisurely and 3 hours plus. And neither I or the missus regret the night out.  But again, neither of us were blown out of the water either.", "author": "Rajash S."}

We went with the 10 course grand menu and it was spectacular - if you go this route, make sure you come hungry! I'd read about the uni crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e and I agree with it being the unofficial house special. It managed to combine two very distinct, intense flavors in a way where both came through without being overwhelming. The bread and butter was oven to table and it showed. Not a single course was anything short of stellar. All of the servers worked together to help make it a wonderful evening - ask questions! A lot of the dishes had interesting ingredients or came from regions we were unfamiliar with, hearing the story behind each plate from the staff made the meal into an adventure. Given how consistently excellent all of the dishes were, if you're going for your first time I'd recommend going with one of the two tasting menus. At $89 the tasting menu (7 courses) is a phenomenal deal for top notch service, beautiful plating, and delicious food from the kitchen that's no more than 20 feet from the furthest seat.", "author": "Michael R."}

We started the meal with green bean fries, uni creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, scallop and pork belly, octopus, and had the melt in your mouth seared foie gras. We also ordered the pappardelle with shaved black truffle, but as we waited for it, THIS IS WHEN THINGS WENT REALLY SOUR FOR ME.\n\nThe chef himself came over and asked us if we could switch to a different table because the large party next to us brought more people than what they made reservations for. Mind you, WE WERE NOT DONE EATING AT THIS POINT.\n\nI was not going to throw a fit in the restaurant then, so we moved to a different table at their request. Our pappardelle came and the chef brought it to us saying that he added the truffle, but I told him we actually ordered it as an add-on, and he said \"oh, I put more\". Whether or not that was true I didn't believe it at that point because I was pissed, and the truffles were grated finely over the pasta versus shavings that I'm used to getting at other restaurants. (Side note: I looked up photos of the same dish on yelp and the amount of truffle was comparable.)\n\nHe then brought us a complimentary appetizer of fried oysters, but at that point we were full and quite frankly I like my oysters raw. We then ordered the butterscotch pot de creme for dessert before we got the bill and the post-dinner chocolate truffles.\n\nThey comped us for the uni creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the foie gras in addition to the complimentary oyster appetizer (we still got charged for our truffle add-on that he initially said he comped). While I appreciate the gesture and understand that they were trying to rectify the situation by comping some of the items, it doesn't change the fact that what they did was impolite and rude, especially for a nice restaurant! They tried to accommodate guests who clearly did not book enough spots for their group, but they did it at the expense of another patron (who was still eating!), and that is just not acceptable, even if you comped the whole bill. \n\nA great restaurant would have handled that differently. Disappointed.", "author": "Tanya P."}

When we asked what the tasting menu consisted of, he rushed through the seven items way too quickly and basically kept iterating how it was a great value -- great to know it's a good value, but was more curious to know what the actual courses would be and a delicious meal, not to score a good deal. It was also confusing because he didn't reference specific courses, and instead gave generic course names like \"pork\" and \"steak\" -- normally that would have been ok, but there were two pork dishes on the menu. He mentioned it last -- after a steak entree -- so I assumed it would be a main course pork we would be getting instead of the appetizer that consisted of pork belly that it actually referred to. Not a big deal, but not the service you would hope for from a place like Third Cousin. \n\nSecond, the food:\n\n- Hamachi crudo -- a wonderful start! Fresh, well complemented, and was a great palette cleanser\n- Uni creme brulee -- the much-referred to crowning jewel of Third Cousin. A wonderful mix of textures and balanced flavors -- up there with Skool's uni-flan. \n- Grilled octopus -- octopus was over-grilled, resulting in charred octopus tastes and extra-rubbery meat. Aioli was also overpowering.\n- Pork belly + scallop -- (thought this would be a pork chop, given the lack of information from our server). The least impressive course -- pork belly was overcooked and burnt, and while the scallop was cooked really well, the spicy peanut sauce made the flavors confusing and tried too hard to be fusion.\n- Truffled ravioli / pappardelle -- fresh pasta always adds so much and both these were solid courses, but nothing to write home about. Preferred the ravioli to the pappardelle.\n- Flank steak with polenta and veggies -- solid course but again, nothing particularly standout. \n- Chocolate souffl\u00e9 tart -- again a little bit of a surprise given the lack of information from our server. Was expecting a pure chocolate souffle and ended up with a tart -- which was delicious, just unexpected. \n\nWould I come back again? Maybe -- if I'm in the area. Would NOT recommend the tasting menu (no matter how \"good value\" it may be), and definitely don't expect standout service.", "author": "wendy q."}

This jewel in Bernal Heights is intimate, modern and classy with an understated elegance.  The chef is a true artist and his creativity is evident in his inventive, artfully crafted and beautifully presented dishes.  3rd Cousin is fine dining without being stuffy or pretentious.  Sophisticated enough for a special occasion while also casual enough to go on a random Wednesday night. \n \nI had the 7 course tasting menu with the pairing.  The food is as visually appealing as it is delicious and the pairings perfectly accentuate each dish.  Given the quality and variety of ingredients used (uni, truffles, lobster) 3rd Cousin is a great value, a far better value than many other high-end restaurants.  Each course was perfectly paced and I found the staff informative, attentive and friendly. \n \nHamachi crudo-well balanced flavors that elevated the fish.  The white soy was delicate and not overpowering and the rice crisp gave the dish a nice mouth feel.\n \nUni cr\u00e8me brulee-unique and innovative dish that starts with a light and airy uni mouse which is bruleed and topped with fresh uni and assorted caviar.  The smoothness of the mouse and the creaminess of the uni, mixed with the slightly sweet crunch of the brulee and salty pop of roe provide a nice play of flavors and textures.\n \nOctopus-Beautifully presented dish that was impeccably cooked and although grilled had a nice smokey finish.\n \nRavioli-Perfection!  Soft delicate ricotta filled al dente raviolis which are then bathed in a beautiful unctuous sauce and smothered with black truffles.  An exquisitely luscious dish.\n \nPork belly and lobster-Chef's version of surf and turf features a flawlessly poached lobster paired with crispy pork belly giving you a dish that is simultaneously rich and light at the same time.\n \nDuck-perfect seasoning and flawless cooking provide for a wonderfully tender and succulent duck in an elegant huckleberry sauce.\n \nDessert-was a delightful chocolate souffl\u00e9 tart which pleasantly surprised me with a velvety liquid chocolate center when I took my first bite.  Perfect ending to an amazing dinner. \n \nI'm excited to have found this restaurant and I cannot wait to go back!", "author": "Mimi T."}

We did the Valentines Day Pre-Fixe ($99/person), definitely on the pricier end.\n\nWe arrived at 4:57 for a 5:00 reservation. The couple in front of us, also here for a 5pm, were asking if they could be seated and were told to wait outside. Which was odd. When we went into the restaurant, the couple in front of us complained to the Maitre'd about the delay in seating us for a 5pm reservation. The Maitre'd replied that we were welcome to walk in as soon as we got here. I had to interject and let her know that we were told to wait outside. Already a bad start.\n\nWe were seated, and ordered the ginger beer and pomegranate juice. Both were delicious and refreshing. The ginger beer had a fresh ginger kick. In the middle of drinks, my wife indicated that the seat was uncomfortable and would prefer to sit at a bar stool, that was cushioned. We requested this, and the response was \"No, we have reservations and are full.\" This did not answer our question nor was a plausible response - given that the bar chairs were empty from the time we were seated until the time we walked out of the restaurant. Further, we made a reservation, and our table would be open for whoever else. Their incompetence was noted.\n\nWe ordered the Hamachi and the Oyster for appetizer. The Hamachi was good, melt-in-your mouth texture, with fresh greens and perfectly paired sauce. The fried oyster was good, but not great. It fell a little flat with flavor, though the oyster itself was cooked well. \n\nWe ordered the twice cooked pork belly and the uni creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The pork belly was flavorful, but overcooked and chewy (not the tender and/or crispy that you would expect). The Uni Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was good. Very rich and luxurious. My wife enjoyed it, though noted that there was a serious lack of crostini to go with it. In addition, we noted that the table next to us got a larger sized serving for the dish (a larger oval container, rather than a small ramekin that we got).\n\nFor entree we had the duck and the pappardelle. Both were tasty. The huckleberry sauce was delicious as were the Brussels sprouts and parsnips (on the duck). While delicious, the portion of the duck was small. The pappardelle was rich, creamy and flavorful. The crispy greens added freshness and crunch to an otherwise rich dish. \n\nFor dessert we were given 1 piece of chocolate/raspberry cake for 2 people. This was surprising given a) the price of $99/person - you would expect cake for each person and b) the table next to us got two pieces of cake. The waiter brushed this off as a \"mistake\". This is very poor in hospitality. I would have given both tables within eye-shot an extra piece. Going to a restaurant is an experience, and this dulls the mood (again for $99, you'd just expect two servings). \n\nOverall, we may go back in the fall - and hope for a better experience. The food was just good enough for the price point, but leaves you unsatisfied and discontent. While individual dishes may be flavorful (at times) the experience is flat. There was not enough recognition that a higher end restaurant is more than just the food, but also the details of service are equally important. A little additional hospitality and extra gestures would go a long way to justify the price point. Or at the very least, a piece of a cake per person.", "author": "Aditya Y."}

Some unique flavors but also some combinations that don't seem to sit well. It's sort of Italian focused, with several fresh pasta dishes and some unusual twists. They have a seafood \"ramen\", which was $44 for a plate of Italian-style spaghetti noodles in a thin broth that tasted like smoked salmon. Most of the rest of the food was similarly not quite there yet but at elevated prices.\n\nService was also surprisingly bad. I mean, I know how hard it is for restaurants in SF to hire these days, but when we approached the hostess to say we had a reservation, she grabbed some menus and walked away from us without saying a word. A moment later, standing in front of an empty table, she looked at us puzzled as to why we hadn't follow her.

Portions were very small, flavors were flat. \n- The crab/lobster ramen was especially  disappointing, $44 \"large size\" for what felt like a one-person dish; \n- wagyu beef texture felt like eating lean hanger steak; \n- had to share 3 pcs of corn fritters (tasted more like potato cheese pops) among 4 ppl and would have gladly paid for extra piece if we knew of portion or were offered (small details like that set a restaurant apart); \n- scallop of scallop/pork belly was good, but pork belly was dry and overcooked; \n- uni creme brulee was good but tiny; \n- octopus was rubbery and not flavorful;\n- can't remember the desserts\n\nEvery dish was simply overpriced considering its tiny portion and underwhelming quality. \n\nWe wanted to like 3rd Cousin, as the menu looked good and some of us live in Bernal and want to support a neighborhood shop, but unfortunately we expect better food (and service) for the price.", "author": "Ack J."}

She knew the wines super-well too.\n\nI'm really not into the lobster/crab ramen that I tried on a previous recent visit. I say skip that, but other reviewers seem to dig it.\n\nI think my favorite thing about this restaurant is how the chef has certain dishes that he just rocks. They're his invention, he does them well, he gets loyal fans, and changing the entire menu with every sub-season means fans don't get their favorite thing. So he plays with variations on his classics. SO GOOD.\n\nI finally tried the hamachi crudo after years. It was literally so good that I ordered a second.\n\nMy partner went with the fried things x2 so I got a taste. I've been avoiding fried food but after tasting realized for the splurges, this is a good spot. The corn fritters represent the best of summer (fresh corn!) in a fluffy fried delicious ball that doesn't make you feel stuffed and heavy. It's just not greasy, and on the inside it's SO fluffy/doughy. It's what a fritter truly should be. The asparagus, green beans, or whatever other fried app is on deck this week turns out is great too: tempura style so again not heavy, with thought to the sauce.\n\nAnd now that I've had two variations on broccoli soup I'm gonna say the chef here is a soup genius.\n\nIf you live in Bernal, this is a necessity neighborhood spot.

I will write another update once we give them another shot.\n\n**************************************************************************\nNobody wants to be that person....\n\nThe one who looks like a complete d*ck for sending back their food. \n\nApparently, we were those \"d*cks\". When we sent back our food, the ladies at the next table looked at us and whispered to each other. They continued to stare at our table throughout the night--I guess I must have had a huge booger hanging out from my nose. Anyways, the staff at 3rd Cousin were really nice about it and was apologetic so may this review is more of constructive feedback. \n\nI've been to the owner/chef's previous restaurant/pop-ups (Lot 7 and Kinfolk). Though I had lukewarm experiences at both places, I wanted to put those aside and give 3rd Cousin a shot. My friend and I both live nearby so we thought it would be a good place for us to catch up during the week. \n\nUsually ambiance has little to do with my overall experience but in this instance, it did. Poor acoustics made the dining room incredibly loud so we had to shout across the table to each other. So did every table so it felt like being stuck in a metal box with a bunch of raging banshees. My friend was also bothered with the poor ventilation. Additionally, it was so dark that we had trouble reading the menu.\n\nPlease note that a credit card is required to secure reservations and if you don't cancel your reservations within 48 hours, you will be charged a $25 fee. \n\nThe New American Menu is short and concise with 8 snacks/apps ($5-$17), 5 entrees ($21-$32), 2 sides ($9), and 3 desserts ($9). There's a chef's tasting menu available for $89 pp. Beer and wine only. I noticed many of the menu items are carry overs from the owner's previous restaurant/pop-ups so I thought they would have had enough time to perfect these items. I know they're still new in this location (opened mid-November) but quite frankly, I was surprised some of these dishes we received left the kitchen. At these price points, I expected more care and finesse. \n\nMy friend and I shared the following (sorry for the dark pics, I lightened them on Photoshop as much as I could):\n\n*Pine nut, spigarello, and ricotta fritters w/ sofrito ($9): bit.ly/1IK6YTp\nThe pine nut and ricotta fritters were creative but left in the fryer too long. The exterior was quite hard and the interior was hollow with whole pieces of pine nuts.\n\n*Fried organic chicken thighs w/ romesco, autumn royal grape agrodolce, herbs ($11): bit.ly/1O0j7FQ\nThe menu indicated \"thighs\" but there was one boneless thigh quartered which seems a bit excessive for $11. I picked up one piece with my fork and noticed the burnt side was placed faced down on top of the sauce. I took a bite and it was confirmed--burnt. The burnt bitter taste lingered in my mouth throughout dinner.\n\nWe sent this back and the second order was better (not burnt) but the chicken was quite bland and was 70% batter. The romesco sauce was bland as well. Perhaps brining may help? Zero Zero and Mason Pacific have a similar fried chicken dish which are both fantastic as they brine their chicken. \n\n*Uni Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e w/ hackelback caviar, trout roe, tobiko, toast ($17): bit.ly/1SSxp9F\nAs the chef's signature dish from both his previous stints, the uni cr\u00e8me brulee was the best dish of the night. The silky smooth custard was topped with uber fresh sweet briny uni and you get a nice pop of saltiness from the caviar, roe, and tobiko.\n\n*Pappardelle w/ spigarello, wild mushroom, smoked mozz, creme friache, reggiano, truffle ($24 + $3 guanciale): bit.ly/1HYTxPm\nThe pappardelle arrived as a pile of mush.\n\nWe sent this back and the second order of noodles kept its form but it was still a little too soft as it lacked a toothsome chew.

I hate sending food back and when we did, they were nice about it. Usually restaurants send out bread or a little something from the kitchen gratis to tide diners down while they re-fire their entrees. They didn't but maybe that's something they should consider.Dinner took 2.5 hours so food service was a bit on the slow end. \n\nWith time, I hope they're able to work through all the rough patches we experienced.

Tl;dr -- this experience underscored my sense of isolation to the extent that I wanted to go home and put a gun in my mouth. \n\nI made my reservation six weeks in advance. I was informed that I would be sitting at the bar because I was dining alone. Sure, fine, I was  already going to be alone on Thanksgiving, I was happy just to have place to go and have a traditional dinner. The front of house girl took my credit card number over the phone, which seemed legit at the time.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, I was having trouble getting an Uber car to the restaurant. When I called the restaurant to let them know about the delay, I was told by the front of house girl that there was another diner coming in right after me and however many minutes I was late would be however many minutes I had before they kicked me out of the restaurant and handed my seat to the next guy. I was just a cow going into a slaughterhouse at that point. I blamed it on the girl's inexperience and possible lack of a finishing school education. I arrived and was seated at the bar, which came almost to my shoulders. I asked for a seat at the shorter bar next to me. I was told that other people would be seated there and I couldn't have that spot. This wasn't true.  \n\nI ordered my dinner, and the 1st course, salad, was exactly what this Southern white girl would have wanted. That is to say, it was slathered in mayonnaise. When the main course came out, I was horrified. There was about a pound of turkey in the center of the plate, with 4 sides similarly piled in the center. I cannot exaggerate how unappealing the plating was. All the food was touching all the other food in a sloppy mass. I sampled the green bean casserole, which was gritty, flavorless, and ice cold; the sweet potatoes, which were undercooked and also cold; the mashed potatoes, which were inoffensive; and the stuffing, which was pretty good, but also cold. The turkey was not dry, props to the chef, but it was also cold. I ate the 2 side dishes that were palatable, and asked for a box for the rest. My dog, a fat little gentleman himself, was very grateful the next day. Finally, dessert appeared, a bourbon pecan pie that was actually amazing. I tried to ask the waiter for some coffee, but he ran away as soon as the pie hit the countertop. This was pretty much par for the evening. \n\nAt this point, I had had about 8 to 12 oz of food for the evening. That would be ounces in volume, not in weight.  The food, with the exception of the pie, had tasted terrible and made me feel even more unhappy about spending the holiday by myself. I asked for 2 additional pieces of pie to go, finally was able to order my coffee, and got my check. For terrible food and terrible service, I didn't leave much of a tip, but the bill came to around $120. That's dinner for one, half of which could not be consumed due to temperature & taste problems. The chef came out to ask me how dinner was, and I told him the pie was fantastic. I left and went to a bar, where I met up with a friend who had just gone through a terrible break up. We were both having s***** Thanksgivings, and we ended up laughing over a plate of fish-and-chips at the only Irish pub we could find that was open. \n\nI would never darken the door of this restaurant again, not if it was the only place in town. The way I was treated and the way the food tasted and the huge 3 digit bill all combined to make me feel cheated and unseen. I was just an invisible inconvenience, a credit card waiting to be jammed into a machine.The fact that I didn't eat more than half of my entree should have been a clue that I was a dissatisfied customer. But these people literally did not care. All around me there was evidence that I had been lied to, with open tables and open bar seats where I would have been much more comfortable during my meal. And surely they must have noticed that my food was cold when it came out. And maybe they would have bothered to take a little extra time to check in with me or at least wait for me to finish ordering before scurrying away, considering that I was alone on a holiday. The front of house staff have barnyard manners, and I don't know about the chefs ordinary menu, but his Thanksgiving offering really made me question his palate.\n\nYou know how people on Yelp say, if I could give this restaurant 0 stars, I would? If I could give this restaurant smallpox and a fire and silver fish, I f***ing would.", "author": "Jolie O."}

We arrived a little earlier than our reservations, but they were able to accommodate us nonetheless. It's a cozy, trendy little spot. I have to admit that some of the items were very unique and those alone would've been a five star for me, while some of the others were quite ordinary to say the least. Also, very tight spaces getting in and out of your seats for the tables next to the window.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Sea Scallop & Pork Belly ($19), Uni Creme Brulee ($19), Foie Gras Special ($27), and Bread & Butter. From least to best, the foie gras was nothing extraordinary, but I'm personally no connoisseur of fancy foods. Next was the sea scallops and pork belly, which is a split. I enjoyed the juicy and luscious scallops that was seared perfectly well, but the pork belly was quite hard and chewy. As for bread and butter, it's a classic that can't go wrong. The special part was that their butter offered a unique flavoring which stood out to me. Finally, we have the uni creme brulee. The name itself already drew my attention for it's unique union of the two flavors. With such a creamy texture for both, the mixture was nothing short of amazing. This dish is a must despite how small it was and served with just five pieces of baguette. On the other hand, we were able to continue enjoying the uni creme brulee on the bread we also ordered, so yay!\n\nI was honestly pretty stuffed by the time our main entrees rolled around. We ordered the Pappardelle ($18) and Duck Confit Bolognese ($18). It was a good thing we ordered the half size portions, which was just enough. The pappardelle was the winner of the two with the creamy, cheesy truffle sauce. The addition of mushrooms and broccoli was exactly how I enjoy my pastas, so plus in my book.\n\nOverall, the uni creme brulee and pappardelle stood out to me most here. Otherwise, everything else was okay, especially for the price you're paying.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

We lucked out and were able to snag a table after a half hour wait without a reservation on a Saturday night, but would definitely recommend reservations as the place is cozy and we're late eaters (sat at close to 9p). For starters we had the hamachi crudo with green strawberries (order this!) and the burrata with olives, charred padron peppers, cherries and olives. The burrata was good, but nothing special. Definitely get the hamachi though! Yum!\n\nMy boyfriend had the wagyu steak and I had the Uni cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and seared foie gras apps for my entree because well, why not? I love Uni and foie! He enjoyed the steak, but felt it was a bit chewy; think the cut was a NY strip. Flavors were good though.\n\nThe Uni cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was very creative and super rich. Not quite as much fresh Uni as I would like, but this dish is definitely worth trying at least once for all Uni lovers such as myself. The foie was served on this delicious almost French toast type bread with nuts and huckleberries. I would order this again in a heartbeat.\n\nThe house bread and butter are delicious as well! Don't forget to ask for this.\n\nWe had the chocolate souffl\u00e9 for dessert which reminded us a bit more of a brownie than a souffl\u00e9. I was picturing it in a ramekin, but comes as a square served a la mode on a plate along with nuts and some fruit, which I think was pickled.\n\nOur bill came out to $154 with the above apps,entrees, one dessert and a glass of wine. We look forward to returning. The only hitch was the hostess was initially extremely rude to us when we  walked in.

The pasta was nice and soft and the sauce was very \n+ Foie Gras (off the menu) - You can't go wrong with foie gras ever, so this dish was a win. The pistachio toast was delicious too!\n+ Make sure to ask for some of their delicious bread! We seriously couldn't get enough of it.\n\n- Cactus Fries (off the menu) - It wasn't bad, I just think that cactus might not be for me. It's very similar to okra, but with a tangy after taste.\n- Sweet Corn, Kale & Ricotta Fritters - I found the fritters to be too soft and mushy, almost like a pillow!\n- Duck Breast & Duck Brat - I also wasn't particularly found of this dish, but the rest of the table liked it. I think it was just a matter of preference for this one. \n\nWe ended our meal with the bread pudding dessert- which was delicious!! Chef Greg Lutes stopped by our table to say hello with a yummy Pot de Cr\u00e8me-- much appreciated final touch to our meal. There were also homemade truffles that came along with our check.  \n\nWithout a doubt, I'll be back at 3rd Cousin for another delicious meal!\n\nOn a side note: Making reservations was a piece of cake, but they do require a credit card on file and have a 48 hour cancellation policy.

We had the tasting menu which was lovely and highlights are already well described by many - so I'll just add to the pile of accolades by joining the masses in high praise of the uni creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with caviar (really really great), the porcini ravioli was also a seasonal winner and the pork belly and scallops were spot on. Instead of octopus we ended up with swordfish, not usually a first choice for us but well prepared with some interesting locally sourced greens that added a nice twist. Ask for the bread and butter and be impressed with a creamy loaf (yes a loaf can be moist and creamy!) with a great earthy char on the outside.... The Wagu beef and short ribs were another outstanding dish and it ended with a gooey chocolate cake w ice cream. Buy a bottle off Greg's wine list and he waves the corkage on one of your own. Service was a little klunky but the food and people actually more than made up for it. Glad we finally made it to this spot. A little late to the party (I was on Kinfolks and 3rd Cousins pop up email list for years and never managed to make a dinner before he opened this brick & mortar gem) but glad we finally arrived.

There was also no \"crunch\" that you would get in a creme brulee dessert. Overall, this was a disappointment. The Sea Scallop & Pork Belly appetizer was much better.

Service +1! We were seated right away and I personally really like this little part of town where there are restaurants on a street I have never been to. Very hipster, rustic decor. \n\nI read from other Yelpers that asking for their bread is a must because they don't offer it. It's complimentary, but the most moist and soft bread interior I've ever had. Lots of sesame and tasty! Their butter was a little salty, but it was good on its own. We ordered their organic carbonated fruit drinks: Pomegranate &  Passionfruit - was a bit too diluted and the passionfruit was really bland. We started with the Burrata an Hamachi Crudo - both good, and I really liked the crunchy topping on the hamachi that brought together the soft and crunchy textures. The burrata was delicious and paired with olives and zesty-tasting veggies. One of my friends that likes uni, really enjoyed the Uni Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I have never tasted warm uni, so it was very interesting on top of the crunchy bread pieces - paired well together, but the uni was on the fishy side so I didn't enjoy as much as she did.The purple cauliflower was tasty as well and reminded me a lot of rice, but smaller. We also ordered another side, brussel sprouts! This place serves brussels differently because they actually use large pieces that they cut into 4ths - really liked the balasmic flavor the small nut pieces. My favorites were the entrees: Grilled Wagyu & Truffle Ravioli.The grilled wagyu was perfectly cooked and flavored, not overpowered with marinating. The two tofu-looking things tasted like cornmeal texture and a bit too hard for my likings, but I enjoyed the wagyu a lot. The truffle ravioli was also super delicious - i wish I had more! We ended on 3 desserts: Meyer Lemon with coconut flakes, chocolate souffle with ice cream, and banana bread pudding with strawberry ice cream - I liked the souffle best because of the melting chocolate inside with the ice cream. I liked the strawberry ice cream for the bread pudding too, but strawberry flavor gets lost with the bread pudding. Would return to this spot because of their great service and good food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-19", "description": "We had a wonderful birthday dinner celebration here. If you like quality ingredients, unique flavor combinations, great wine pairing and excellent service, you will like this place. Yes, it's a little bit on the pricey side if you get the tasting menu, but for a special occasion, I'd definitely recommend this place.\n\nThe tasting menu will run you $89 per person, with a wine pairing of $59 per person. You'll get 5 savory courses and one dessert course, and if you are wanting to try something specific off the menu, you can certainly request it and they will try to incorporate it into the tasting menu. The tasting menu itself will be mostly things off the menu, with a dish or two that is tweaked depending on what the chef has on hand.\n\nHamachi with a Strawberry Habanero Sauce - We got 2 pieces of fresh hamachi which was delicious. There was a furikake cracker on top which complemented this nicely. The sauce wasn't too spicy despite having habanero in it.\n\nUni Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e - I love uni, so naturally this was one of my favorite dishes of the night. It was uni blended with cream and probably other things to make up the base. Then it had a piece of uni on top and 3 types of caviar, and came with 5 little pieces of toast. I could have eaten two of these; I've never had anything like this before. They have this a la carte, so get this if you like uni!\n\nScallop & Pork Belly with Pluots - This was one of my other favorite dishes, and my boyfriend's favorite dish of the night. How can you go wrong with perfectly cooked pork belly & scallop? The sweetness of the pluot sauce and slices of pluots paired really well with the saltiness of the pork belly. Highly recommend this dish.\n\nSpinach Gnocchi - I usually love gnocchi, but I thought I'd love this more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it was still really good, but the texture was slightly soft for my taste. There were fresh slices of black truffle on top which was delicious. I guess after eating the uni creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the scallop & pork belly dish, this one was hard to live up to those 2 dishes.\n\nMeat Tasting Plate - Talk about meta -- we got a 4 course duck/meat tasting plate during our tasting menu. First up was deep fried sweetbreads (don't google this if you don't know what it is -- just eat it), a duck and foie gras sausage, roast duck, and a piece of foie gras. I love foie gras, so let's just say that was the highlight of that plate! I did like that there were a few bites of 4 things -- I loved the variety.\n\nChocolate Tart Dessert - If you cover anything with chocolate, I will love it so I loved the chocolate tart shell with the warm chocolate in the middle.\n\nThey ended with 2 little pieces of chocolate on a plate with a candle for my boyfriend's birthday, which was perfect, and several staff members wished him happy birthday. \n\nThe wine that was paired with all the dishes were all excellent, and we had a really enjoyable, lovely meal. I do think that the tasting menu is a bit on the pricey side, but all the food was well-prepared and with ingredients that are expensive. If you come here for the tasting menu, just be prepared to throw down a decent amount of $. Otherwise you can order off the a la carte menu. I'll be back again!", "author": "Christina L."}

Came here for dinner, restaurant was about half-filled, maybe a slow night. Good ambiance. Staff were friendly and food came out in a good pace. Could tell a couple staff were very young, one didn't know how to use the espresso machine.\n\nFood/Drink- could tell that the chefs put in thought and creativity into each dish, but each dish seemed to be a tiny bit off to me. BREAD and butter- good bread, I liked. OYSTER TEMPURA- flavors were good, but not as crispy as I would like. $15 for 3 fried oysters (as explained by our waitress, but we were given 4). UNI CREME BR\u00dbL\u00c9E- uni tasted fresh and nicely presented with tobiko and salmon roe, but the br\u00fbl\u00e9e was a bit too sweet for me, the crostini/bread served with it could be better. VENISEN- nicely cooked, but coffee crust was a bit overpowering which made the lamb taste a bit bitter. The BBQ sauce was a could compliment, but the beans were a tiny bit undercooked/hard. RABBIT GEMILLI- my favorite dish of the night, well flavored, got the small portion, and indeed it was small! Pasta was served hot, a bit cooler and al dente would be even better! Chardonnay was okay, had better at the same price point. PEAR & SUNFLOWER cake- good, not too sweet. Truffle chocolates came with the bill.\n\nHusband and I prefer creative/innovative food and are used to challenging flavor combinations, but we were a bit disappointed by the food that night, especially given the price point and quantity. It was nice that the chef/owner came by to thank us at the end of our meal, but not sure if we're going to be back soon.", "author": "Iris H."}

It's not super fancy but it's really nicely laid out, cute restaurant that I think we'll keep going back to. \n\nThe food was very good - we had the crudo which was great and the wife had a salad for an appetizer and she seemed to like it a lot. We shared the ragu with pappardelle which tasted good although it was a bit salty. \n\nWhat I think the restaurant can do way better is their wine list. I felt like the wine list needs work and if you're going to have a limited list, which I'm completely fine with, make it awesome.

Beautiful and sinfully delicious. 3 kinds of caviar nestled between slivers of uni atop a thin candy shell, and underneath a briny delicious crab and uni brulee.  So good. Could eat an entire thing myself (it's about the width and length of of two fingers, mind you) with a glass of wine and call it a night. \n\n* Hamachi - good strawbanero sauce, though the lime was almost overpowering. Also, the texture was a bit odd. Almost like the fish was a little overly firm, almost mealy, like it was a tad frozen. \n\n* Octopus - skip this. The octopus was rubbery. I only ate this out of a stubborn sense of duty to clean my plate.  \n\n* Duck confit pasta - salty and heavy, though the pasta was al dente and the squash helped lighten things up. \n\nThe guy who brought us our uni was really nice, though we found the service overall to be a little stiff. \n\nIt also gets incredibly noisy, so go early if you want a more intimate experience.", "author": "Annie M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-03", "description": "Greg got in trouble for contacting me on Yelp. He wanted me to come to eat at his new pop up, and I'm glad that he did, because I was delighted by his invitation and subsequently came here to dine during the hottest day of San Francisco, 84 degrees when we arrived at the former Lazy Bear location. Lately, my enthusiasm has returned, slowly but gradually I feel once again myself and ready to greet the world. It had been a toughie, all those work you put in, sometimes your body and mind still break down and there is nothing you can do about it. But then I was better. I met Greg and became a 3rd Cousin under a much better circumstance than several weeks ago, and because of it, I was able to experience the food in a way a real food lover would. I savored.\n\nThe setting, as many would know, was the same as Lazy Bear old locale, the casual snacks were served in the beginning as some people gathered. A very cute couple celebrating their 26th year wedding anniversary. A young couple just bought their house on Mission and 29th after moving from Chicago: one guy worked for a former employer of mine, and his partner worked for a tech giant in the valley. I started to rattle off restaurant names which made one of the boys feeling a bit in awe but at the same time made me feel a bit self conscious (have I wasted countless evenings eating out?). I shared the secrets for getting into State Bird and Rich Table, and told the boy in consulting the best bone marrow is now at Monsieur Benjamin, better than LoLinda. A preppy Brit walked in and asked me what this super cool joint was. He was getting off his Gbus and discovered it on foot. \n\nSuch was how an evening started. A great group of people formed a small circle, taking small bites of caviar and cream on chips and tuna tartar on rice crackers, and since when I'm on, I'm really on, I carried the conversation like I used to, assertive, attentive, inquisitive and assuring. That was how I liked a dinner party, a way to get to know others who liked to dine. We came here to bond over good food, in that sense, we all became 3rd cousins before food was served.\n\nGreg started out with spaghetti squash with pine nuts fritter then it was crab falafel aka a fancier version of crab cake, I liked it a lot. Then bacon wrapped sea scallops and crisp pork belly. Can't complain. All extremely tasty. We went inside the kitchen as we once did at Lazy Bear and watched them prepare food. It required a bit of patience and lots of discipline to do so many dishes all at once. I told Greg that I was good at eating, not so good at cooking, there was no way that I'd learn any of it, but to watch food getting prepared, that was fun. Butternut squash gratin was simply heavenly. Rack of lamb was juicy and not dry, I had no idea that you had to put that much herb to make it tasty but now I understood it's mostly about preparation when you cook rack of lamb. Note to self: always order lamb at restaurants. You can never make such a dish on your own. Too damn complicated. \n\nThe most surprising thing was yuzu curd berries. Quite unexpected and completely delicious. \n\nGreg took his food seriously but with discipline and originality. Some will tell you Lazy Bear was phenomenal with a cult following, but eating at Lazy Bear to some is stunt eating. It's fanciful and not necessarily in a good way. The same group of people will also probably tell you there is something very distinct and different about Greg's cooking. There is a bit of substantialness that reminds of us his Midwestern roots. You don't have to create a complicated dish to wow the audience. You just need to manage the flavor and execute it well, be authentic and truthful to your own sense of style. \n\nWhile I have met and made many friends who are from the Northeast, I am secretively drawn to Midwesterners: there is a bit more subtly and authenticity in their behavior, and that transcends into how they create things. In this case, the meal is not overly complicated for the sake of being complicated, it's well executed, it's needing refinement as a new popup entity, but it's well thought out. With the fall, we start to see more squashes and root vegetables and that we wanted heartier meat. That was what was served tonight, there was consideration made to the seasonality and that subtly was not lost on us. \n\nI'd watch this spot. I'd encourage you to come and try it out.  Mostly, I'd like to invite you to venture out of your comfort zone and enter the secret and exclusive pop up San Francisco dining scene, if you have not already done so. You want to be the one who can say, \"I've eaten there before it actually opened.\" There, that's how you enter the big league (of super food lovers). and separate yourself apart from the rest of self-proclaimed foodies (99% of San Franciscans will call themselves foodies because they have once waited in line at Bi-Rite or Tartine).  And do it soon before it goes mainstream.", "author": "Victoria E."}

There were three of us and we began with some of the best wine recommendations we've had in years, and I'm a wino sob who regularly goes to Auberge and Village Pub just for the good somms. The hamachi was fresher than I've had at sushi legends like Kusakabe. We ordered the uni cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e twice - so juicy and the uni itself was made even better by caviar and the crunchy creme shell. I think Greg must have some kind of an advanced pallet to be able to put these dishes together. The corn fritters seem like they would be the most humble part of the dish yet somehow he made them sing. Basically each dish that came out was our favorite until the next one and then that one became our new favorite. When we thought we wouldn't be able to order one more thing we ended up with two of the chocolate cake desserts - I haven't had any variation of a lava cake in years. I thought it would be old fashioned, boring, but the chocolate was to die for. Outside it was delicately crunchy, inside it was the ideal consistency and temperature.

For the uninitiated, it's a one of those fancy places that offers meticulously prepared \"new American\" dishes via a prix fixe menu or your own a la carte choices.  Hungry but not famished, we took the latter route and ordered based on what looked great in Yelpers' photos, plus the server's recommendations.  Which, BTW, included what might have been the single best wine pairing I've ever had.  Let's get right to it:\n\nUni Brulee: you're a foodie if you're eating here, so I know you're going to order this.  Let me also suggest that you (1) try to get a good combo of the various ingredients of this dish in each bite, because there is a certain magical balance to achieve and (2) you order it with a glass of the recommended slightly effervescent Riesling (Smith Story, Rheingau 2014) , which you should sip before you eat the dish.  The wine will bring out the sweetness in the dish in a particularly magical way, and both of us thought the combo was pure magic - hence the superlative above.\n\nPork belly and scallops: yep, you foodies are going to order this too.  As you would expect,  the scallop is perfectly cooked and seasoned, but the real magic here is the tiny piece of pork belly that they braise and deep fry (we asked how they prepared it) which makes it quite literally melt in your mouth.  Yum.  Went well with the recommended Chenin Blanc (Roark Wine Co, 2014).\n\nFlatiron and short ribs: After having these two together, I now wonder why they aren't combined more often.  The flatiron was pretty magical, moreso because of its pairing with the short rib.\n\nThe venison steak (with coffee rub!) was good not great, but the zinfandel recommended with it (Bucklin, Bambino Old Hill 2012) was actually much better with the beef!\n\nWe were also recommended a glass of Cabernet (Siletto Vineyard, San Benito 2014) which was simply fantastic on its own.  I have no idea why, but it was better solo than with food.\n\nWe finished with the pear cake with ginger icecream and a caramel sauce, which was as good as it sounds, especially with a latte.\n\nAs you would expect at such a place, service was perfect and the damage was substantial, about a quarter grand after tax and tip.", "author": "Aaron M."}

The flavors were rich and every plate featured innovative combonations.\n\nWe had one server who was really exceptional,  and the chef also checked in a few times, which was also nice.  \n\nYou will drop some money here,  but it's honestly so worth it.", "author": "Caddy M."}

You can join him and try out his cooking in the Pop Up location at the Bernal Heights/Mission border. I met chef on Twitter and Instagram, and become a fan of his food now.\n\n    We love the space too. It's the former Lazy Bear Pop Up space, rustic, intimate and spacious. Chez 3RD Coursin offers 1seating at 7 PM, in JAN 2015: 2, 3, 11, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29.\n\n     I came a a few friends to 1 of his Pop Up in DEC 2014, for about $70-$85, you got 3 passed  hors d'oeuvres, and 5 tasting courses with the option of wine pairing at $45. It's a real bargain. Once chef Greg Lutes opens his restaurant, I can't imagine him to keep this price point up with all the rent and operation costs. \n\nHors d'oeuvres:\n- Lobster Spring Rolls - this was tangy citrus, fresh herbs, good chunk of lobsters in rice paper, was delicious, I couldn't stop eating this. My favorite bites of all!\n\n- Caviar on blini bite - vvery good\n\n- Tuna Tartare with tobiko - full of flavor, fresh, and a perfect bite\n\n1st Course: Roasted beets, fennel, burrata fritter - this was DELICIOUS, generous portion as a salad dish at a restaurant.\n\n2nd Course: Corvina fish, confit squash & peppers, plum, red wine and chef Greg Lutes shaved the Buddha Hands citrus on top, beautiful dish all around.\n\n3rd Course: Seared Sea Scallops & Crips Heritage Pork Belly.  The pork belly was a bit over cooked on my plate, my friend's scallop was a bit over cooked because this was a thinner cut of scallop, but the flavor was all there. And the ALBA TRUFFLES saved it for me ;-)\n\n4th Course: Venison, this wasperfectly cooked to medium rare, GENEROUS entree portion. We all enjoyed this dish very much.\n\n5th Course: Parsnip & Apple Cake, dessert, everyone at the party finished it strong.\n\n    The wine list offers 10 by the glass, and was about 8 white and 16 red bottles of wines, range from $44-$380, but majority was under $68 bottles, very reasonable and approachable wine list.  \n\n     If you don't want to order any wines, Chez 3RD Cousin allows you to BYOB here, it's truely a bargain. \n\n     You can view all the current menu here: http://www.3rdcousinsf.com/menus, follow chef on www.Instagram.com/GregLutes and www.Twitter.com/GregLutes.\n\n      Chef Lutes and his staff are amazing, nice, friendly and make sure that we all had a good time here. The food is solid, the portion is generous for me, the price point is UNHEARD of. I'm excited for Chef Lutes and rooting him for his new restaurant in 2015. \n\n     P.S. In the mean time, I'm looking forward to come back in JAN 2015 for another dinner with friends.  Let me know if you YELPERS want to join me, it'll be fun :-)", "author": "Manda Bear B."}

Regarding the pork chop, 80 percent of it was perfect and very tasty. Unfortunately the other 20 percent of it was too raw to eat... such a waste on a $32 menu item. How is it that such a talented staff can do this? I realize some cuts cook at different speeds, but there's no shortage of expertly-cooked chops in this town. This should never happen.\n\nRegarding the hamachi sashimi, it was flavorful enough, and the plate was perfectly designed with the fine accompaniments, but it was cut way too thick to enjoy as crudo as it was not nearly delicate enough. Everything else we ordered was delicious.\n\nThe other mystery to us was the music playlist. The room is extremely loud to begin with, so why play very loud hard rock music on top of that? Maybe they think it will cover the noise but all it did was make it worse\n\nLastly, there appears to be a venting problem...

The hors d'oeuvres laid out for all guests to consume, regardless of what party they're a party of; the communal tables, the BYOB policy.. They all create a unique atmosphere. The bread they served on the side was amazeballs - super crispy on the outside, light and airy and a slight sourdough taste on the inside. Surprisingly, this might've been my favorite thing of the meal. I also enjoyed the coffee-crusted venison a lot. Perfectly cooked, tender, and the coffee crust paired very well with the slight hint of gaminess of the meat.\n\nAll of the other dishes though, were just okay. The vegetable first course was okay, but I mean, it's just vegetables. Halibut was definitely on the overcooked and dry side. The scallop and pork belly were okay, but tasted very much like something out of a Chinese restaurant.\n\nThe meal itself was good overall, but for that price point, I'm not sure if I'm sold on this whole concept.

From this tasty beginning, diners know that they will be in for a treat.\n\nThe main meal commences with a creamy, rich celaric, potato, and leek soup accompanied by Burgundy truffle and rye, a wonderful pairing with non-vinatge brut Champagne. Next, a garnish of tart goji berries artfully provides a foil to the light, white fillet of corvina and a creamy confit of squash and peppers. \n\nSeared sea scallops and crispy pork belly come next. Matched with avocado, pear, and wild mushrooms, the sweetness of the scallops with the crispy-fatty goodness of the pork belly was a delight. On a base of hominy polenta flanked by purple cauliflower and quince, the coffee crusted venison was a strong finish to the main courses. Just when you think it couldn't get any better, the imaginative parsnip and apple cake with salted caramel, buckwheat, and pistachio gelato arrives. Dessert heaven. \n\nAn all-around good meal.

His flavors are comforting and familiar, but done in an incredibly refined, complex and surprising way, and it never felt fussy. \n\nWe left still thinking of the pappardelle dish and how Chef Lutes balanced luscious flavors without them ever being heavy. If it would have been appropriate to lick our plates, we would have.  His uni creme brulee has a hint of sweetness but is oh so savory and velvety. In fact we wanted more and more bread, just so we could get every drop of sauce from every dish, including the steak and short ribs which was rich, hearty and perfect!  And that butterscotch pudding! What a great end to a delicious and memorable meal. \n\nIt's also worth noting that each dish is presented beautifully, on serving ware that makes sense, is garnished expertly, and generally makes you look forward to your server bringing each dish. I've never been one for photographing my food, but I have actually thought about it at Chef Lutes restaurant.\n\nConsidering 3rd Cousin has only been open for a month, service is attentive and friendly, and I was surprised that one of the staff members remembered that I can only have a little red wine because I am allergic to it. It always feel wonderful when staff go out of there way, and 3rd Cousin works it butt off to do just that!\n\nConsidering how packed they were on a Tuesday night, I recommend going as soon as you can, because I wouldn't be surprised if Michelin took notice soon.  I've now taken two sets of friends, and both groups said they want to eat there all the time! My only fear is I won't be able to book a table soon!\n\nMy only minor complaint is the volume, it can get loud, but considering you will be busy eating and not talking too much, it's not too bad.

So we picked our own dishes. We chose the uni creme brulee, hamachi crudo, papardelle, gnocchi, and halibut. For dessert, we had the white chocolate banana bread pudding which was on the house. Super sweet of them. The owner/head chef came by and introduced himself and checked on our table. I loved the food, everything tasted delicious! I'd definitely be back and recommend this place to friends.", "author": "Joey C."}

The food is fresh, seasonal, prepared with great technique, and incredibly tasty. I have tried the tasting menu twice and have also dined a la carte. The tasting menu is $90, which is a bargain these days in SF. My one small complaint about the tasting menu is that I wished the portions were just slightly bigger. Everyone in our party wanted to eat a tad more. Even if you order 1-2 more entrees, it would still be pretty affordable for the fine dining experience.", "author": "D. P."}

But I've been following chef Greg ever since he had his Kinfolk pop-up, and want to support him and his wonderful cuisine.\n\n3rd Cousin finally allows Greg to come into his own, having had to contend with cooking in temporary pop-ups for the past few years. Even though the place has only been open for a few months, things seem to be running really smoothly. And the food is impeccable! Make sure you get some of the uni creme brulee, which in my mind is his signature.

Our friendly waiter helped us customize the menu to our mixed pescatarian and omnivorous palates and we were off. As we expected, the food was delicious and beautiful - the scallops and chocolate souffle tart stood out as particularly tasty and creative - and made with extraordinary ingredients. Likewise, the wines were well paired and appropriately-sized pours (I was able to enjoy the sixth glass as much as the first).\n\nWhy only three stars? \n\n* While the food was delicious, it wasn't particularly inspired. The uni in a creme brulee was distinctive, but also our least favorite dish. Other plates struck me as dishes you might get at a dozen other places in the city. My final savory plate was a collection of very fine meats (beef, foie gras and duck sausage) that had no clear relationship among them. \n* The room is loud and crowded. The tables are quite close to one another - to the point that I got bumped by waitstaff while they were serving neighboring tables. \n* Both the kitchen and waitstaff seemed to struggle with the intensity of a tasting menu. Both my wife and I got plates with items at odd temperatures (a roasted fig garnish that was unpleasantly cold, beef that was luke warm). Further, each change of plates and silver felt like an interruption - not the invisible service you can find at other restaurants that offer tasting menus like this. \n\nWe did enjoy dinner!  But, after tax but before tip, our meal was $150 each. At this price, I expect an unique meal without obvious flaws. \n\nIf we return, we'll stick to the a la carte menu.", "author": "me m."}

We finally got to go to the final incarnation 3rd Cousin. People are super nice here and their wine list is very well curated. Our server was knowledgeable and charming. We had the sparkling rose champagne and it was outstanding, I went on the Wine Searcher website and bought several bottles the next day. The Uni Creme Brulee is MENTAL, we were savoring every spoonful. That was the kind of dish you go out for dinner to experience. I am sorry to say the rest of the menu wasn't close to that level. My coffee coated venison was rather bland as were the other dishes we ordered. It's a bit of a price point issue - at their price points I expected to be as wowed as I was with the Uni dish.

Um there were like 20 open tables why stick us right next to the only people in the place and why the need to check? She begrudgingly sat us elsewhere. The service was great though kind of rushed.

Third Cousin is definitely a great addition! We enjoyed four small plates rather than entre's. The roasted brussels sprouts and hazel nuts - outstanding. The pine nut fritters - outstanding! the fried chicken thigh - wonderful romesco sauce, however - a little salty for our tastes (disclaimer: most SF restaurants we find about 30%-50% too salty - so perhaps we just pay closer attention to this), though the royal grape agrodolce was a nice foil. The pappardel spigarello with wild mushroom and truffle - sublime! We should have gotten the full plate! The servings are not large, but so well presented, prepared, balanced. Their wines by the glass - quite nice as well - for instance, their Grenache blend red at $12 (their least expensive red by the glass) was very mellow - I recommend it for pinot noir lovers. While we find the space quite spare and modern (to our tastes), we agree with some other reviews that it's a bit noisy (a common SF restaurant complaint, eh?).
