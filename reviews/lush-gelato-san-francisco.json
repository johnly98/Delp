Luckily with the weather being cold and rainy, they weren't busy at all and we instantly got to try all the flavors before selecting what to get.\n\nUltimately we split a two scoop order with Banana Salted Caramel & Orange Zest Chocolate (http://bit.ly/1YMN4dW).  The combination of these two flavors made it almost like having a banana split but not so heavy.  The banana flavor was really prominent and the orange chocolate reminded me of those Orange Chocolate squares that you get from See's Candies.  Very tart and tangy and I enjoyed every bit of it.\n\nOverall, it was a very good experience at Lush Gelato.

For example, I had Asian pear sorbet with a salted (or maybe it was toasted?) almond gelato, which was a delicious combo. The Asian pear one was especially great. My friend had a ricotta one that was super cheesy, but an interesting combo all the same! One word to note, if you're looking for a regular flavor like vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry, and don't get me wrong, I love those basic flavors, you might not find that here. However, my advice to you is to be adventurous!", "author": "Sruthi S."}

I don't know when a general sense of ennui took over the higher-end ice cream shops, but that's what greeted us here. This is the third of the Lush Gelato shops to open and the first in San Francisco. East Bay friends had been raving about the one on Piedmont Avenue in Oakland for years, but I could never find an opportunity to try it out. I was thrilled to see this shop as Jamie W. and I were strolling along Polk on the way to Aquatic Park.\n\nA scoop costs $3.50 and you add a dollar for each additional scoop. Jamie was good and just had a scoop of the Raspberry Sorbetto which was pretty refreshing (photo:  http://bit.ly/1OYsuGC). I went for full-on decadent and went with a double scoop of Mexican Chocolate and Banana Salted Caramel (photo: http://bit.ly/1SfkXUf). It was definitely creamy but not quite the flavor explosion I was hoping for. We returned a couple of months later, and I tried the Vietnamese Cinnamon to go with the Mexican Chocolate this time (photo: http://bit.ly/1neGAra). I'm still not quite a fan as I think the indifference was leaving more of an impression than the gelato.\n\nGELATO - 3.5 stars...certainly creamy enough though not really that memorable\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...small space with a couple of tables if youc are to stick around\nSERVICE - 2 stars...a little more genuine interest in the customer would have been nice\nTOTAL - 3 stars...a straw hat and a rainbow-stripe vest might help", "author": "Ed U."}

The lady making ice cream in the back is a bit of a brute, and does not seem interested in scooping ice cream.  In her defense, she has to walk all the way to the back of the production area to the room's only door to come up the hallway to the front to serve customers as they trickle in.  It's a bad design and a long walk.  But it would be a good idea for Lush to have someone scooping ice cream that was at least a little friendly.  Incidentally, my wife's ice cream had a piece of plastic in it.  We would have said something, but the     lady was already in the back again and didn't come out for the rest of the time we were there.  We could see her staring through the glass window that separates the production room from the cafe but couldn't talk to her, making it all a little weirder than necessary.", "author": "peter d."}

The gelato here is a wonderful creamy consistency rich in flavor and texture.

From the creativity of the flavors to the satisfaction of having the most perfect dessert, everything about Lush is wonderful.\n\nI absolutely love unique and out-of-the-box ice cream/gelato/froyo flavors, and Lush surprised me with how many unconventional flavors that they serve. In fact the large majority of all their flavors are unique and non-traditional. And, the best part is that the names are accurately descriptive of what flavors you're going to experience in your mouth. \n\nI went with a friend (and fellow Yelper) who was nonstop raving about Lush ever since he tried it for the first time. We went on a Tuesday evening, and the place had the cutest ambiance, with small tables for sitting and chatting and lights hung up along the walls and windows. I wound up trying a lot of different flavors because I was so blown away from the uniqueness of the flavors.\n\nWound up choosing the Creme Fraiche & Strawberry Gelato, and I absolutely loved it. It was such a high-quality step up from your typical strawberry gelato, since the gelato itself had more of a Creme Fraiche flavor while the strawberry flavor was added with fresh strawberries in the mix! So fresh, and so delicious.\n\nMy friend, a regular now, got the Dulce de Leche and Cowgirl Creamery flavors. Lucky for me, he's a sharer, so I was able to try his flavors, and got to experience the wonderfulness of them both. The Dulce de Leche is just bursting with creamy, caramel flavor in a satisfying yet not overwhelming manner. The Cowgirl Creamery is one that he's gotten multiple times, and I can't blame him. It has a great creaminess from the fromage blanc and chunkiness from the cookie dough that makes for a perfect combination of textures and flavors.\n\nPrice is absolutely reasonable for the portion sizes and the freshness of the gelato. You can even walk to the back of the store and see employees making gelato during the day. \n\nIf you have a sweet tooth (like I do) and want to go for some incredible frozen desserts, choose Lush.

M got the mint chip and the dark chocolate but he didn't get to taste them since he was in the car.

Very creative flavors and insanely good texture. \n\nI fanatically tried 5 flavors before deciding. Not a huge fan of the donut flavor but it is quite creative. I ended up getting the pear sorbet and banana salt caramel. I have to say that I was really really impressed by the pear sorbet. I mean how often do you see pear sorbet. The sorbet even has the pear texture. Super delicious, unique and refreshing \n\nBanana salt caramel was quite interesting too and a very nice combination.\n\nI would come back to get a pint of the sorbet", "author": "Ruxin H."}

The woman at the register spoke Spanish and we would ask her questions but she didn't understand us because of the language barrier which was a little frustrating.

The best was mango because it was so strong in flavor but everything else was just ok.", "author": "Melissa P."}

Had the popcorn truffle; initially, I was expecting the flavor to the likes of a Jelly Belly popcorn jellybean--strong but not too strong.  However, this popcorn truffle is quite nice--not overly sweet, yet had that light buttery flavor.  I'd recommend getting this on a waffle cone.

I'm quickly filling up my punch card at Lush Gelato. I discovered Lush from a friend's party where they catered gelato.\n\nLove their unique and rich flavors - Dulce de Leche, Malted Milk, Mascarpone with Dark Choco, Earl Grey Tea, Butterfinger, Strawberry Basil...\n\nThe gelato has a really creamy texture; the flavors taste fresh and authentic- Mint tastes like fresh mint, the Mascarpone is smooth and tangy. They also have Alfajores cookies and homemade waffle cones.\n\nI've always had great service when I've gone in... the owner is friendly and offers samples and keeps the line moving when it's busy.\n\nGlad to have a local small business join the Polk neighborhood! I'm looking forward to trying their delivery service!", "author": "Kensie E."}

The gelato is luscious, the use of flavor is lush, engaging all my senses.  My favorite flavor, a combination of Malbac, black coarsely ground pepper, and fresh fig frozen into gelato.  Oh yum!!  And, I'm not forgetting the other delicious flavors!  Incidentally, my favorite flavor turned out to be a true aphrodisiac!  I'm walking down Polk St. when I realized certain delightful feelings were occurring with no stimulus except the gelato.  Therefore, I highly recommend the Fig, Malbac, and Black Pepper or something like that as I can't remember the flavor's exact name.  This may be a tragedy in the making because I definitely want more and the owners of Lush have a very special flavor here.  I giggle every time I think of it.

He never cracked a smile.  Acted like I was a disturbance. Also, have never been to a gelato store anywhere that wouldn't allow at least 2 flavors  - so I just got one scoop of mint chocolate chunk which was sorely lacking in chocolate chunks. In Italy I've been told it's a law that you get at least 2 flavors! (Ok -maybe not a law but certainly standard practice).  While eating, I read a Yelp tip about the scoop card so I asked a new different server if we could have one. She looked around & said they were out. \"Sorry. No offer to even write on a business card that we had had 2 scoops.  Eating gelato should just be more fun than this. I won't be back.", "author": "Judy M."}

They have good mint gelato; my experience with fresh mint flavors in gelato and ice cream from other is that they taste strongly like toothpaste- Thank you Lush for not making toothpaste flavored gelato :). I settled with their banana-caramel-salt, which was amazing at first but in the end turned out to be a bit too rich for me.
