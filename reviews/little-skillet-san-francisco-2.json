Really fantastic. One of my there pieces was very small, but the other two were somewhat large. I'm not certain if they're intentionally trying to give everyone roughly the same amount and my two larger ones were larger than normal, but if I got a two piece and one of the two pieces was the small one I had, I would have been disappointed.\n\nEveryone told me how great the waffle was going to be. I'm not sure if it's because it was overhyped and I was expecting too much, but I was really disappointed in the waffle. I felt like it was burnt, the batter was kinda bland, and the syrup wasn't great either. I'm typically a waffle person, especially a nice Belgium waffle, and everyone else seems to love it, not sure what happened here.\n\nThe mac & cheese was pretty good, though.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-27", "description": "When I moved offices to cloudy San Francisco, one of the very first things I did was look around and see what good restaurants were nearby me in Mission Bay. \n\nIf any of y'all have ever worked there, you'll know that the food game is pretty dismal - save for the plethora of bars near the ballpark. One of the few standouts to me was Little Skillet, a Southern-style bar known for their fried chicken and drinks.\n\nBecause reviews for dinner were pretty mediocre, I had actually procrastinated on visiting Little Skillet. That was until last week, when my girlfriend and I wanted to eat somewhere very close to our office. Luckily, Little Skillet was only a block away on Townsend and Ritch Street.\n\nOne thing I soon realized about Little Skillet while walking into this bar was that it's definitely more about drinking and having fun here than the food. Now, I'm not saying you can't eat and have a great time but this place was definitely geared toward customers who want to drink and relax. For instance, the bar had a large number of giant tables and counters where you can chill with friends and watch games on TV. The place was extremely spacious, so even on busy days I'm sure you can still find a spot. Furthermore, the menu was pretty tiny; they only served several brunch options, a few sandwiches, soups and sides, and their popular Southern Fried Chicken. In terms of cost, expect to pay at least $15+ for your meal. Not too bad, but it could've been cheaper for what we got.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ended up ordering their 3-piece Crispy Fried Chicken to go along with a Blackened Shrimp Po' boy Sandwich. Food took a little bit longer than we expected to come out (around 15 minutes?) but I guess it was because of how many people there were. Here's what we thought:\n\n- Shrimp Po' boy (8/10): Let me start with the Po' boy. Overall, this sandwich was actually quite good! The French bread, sauce, and coleslaw all created an amazing mix of taste and flavor that reminded me of Nola and the South. The shrimp pieces were very plump and juicy too. $12.5 wasn't bad with the decent portion sizing, especially since the order came with some heavily seasoned chips. However, I wished that the sandwich itself had more shrimp though. We probably only got like 5-6 pieces tops.\n\n- Crispy Fried Chicken (7/10): When it came to their 3-piece Fried Chicken, my girlfriend thought it was okay. Chicken was quite crispy as advertised, the syrup really made the whole sweet and savory combination work, and the waffles were crunchy too. Probably the best part was that the chicken wasn't overly salty or oily. Although, it was kind of annoying that this cost us $14. For only three pieces, it should've been a bit cheaper. \n\nEven though I'm not the type of person who gravitates toward the bar scene, I kind of enjoyed my experience at Little Skillet. Price aside, the food was actually pretty decent. And even though the setting was a bit loud, it was actually perfect for a large meetup or a game day. I give this place a \"Nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating. This sure beats Roscoe's (probably)! \n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

Stay tuned.\n\nI checked out the famed Brenda's French soul food on Friday and loved it. A friend mentioned this spot over the weekend, so I felt like checking it out. Had the waffles (they didn't have chicken and waffles on the to go menu!), angel biscuit, cheddar grits, and seasoned fries. \n\nFirst the waffles. I still don't get the appeal of chicken and waffles, but at least these waffles were really fluffy and slightly eggy. Best waffles I've had, from a certified waffly person on waffles. The syrup had a slight...spiced taste to it? Maybe vanilla extra with a little edge? It was like the fancy grown up version of the $1.50 elementary school breakfast I used to get. Eggs (got scrambled) could've used some salt, and could've been a bit more runny. Bacon was the thicker cut kind and they left the fat chewy! 3.5/5 for the waffles and bacon.\n\nAngel biscuit-- this was an alright biscuit, but it wasn't a gamechanger for me. The one at Brenda's was a bit fluffier. 3/5.\n\nThe cheddar grits consisted of a layer of cheddar atop some more or less flavorless grits-- probably healthier than the one at Brenda's, but who goes to eat healthy restaurant Southern food? More flavoring would've been appreciated. It was still good though, but probably only because I like grits. Baby onions sprinkled across the top made it look fancy. 3/5.\n\nFinally, seasoned fries. The fries were alright, with mashy sort of centers and crispy outsides. I think they used the red Cajun seasoning. Standard. 3.25/5.\n\nOverall a 3.25 on this place for me.", "author": "Nicole H."}

It's a nice spacious restaurant with plenty of large tables and a bar seating area so it works out perfectly when we gather a group of 6 or so.\n\nThe flagship item to get here is definitely their chicken and waffles. One can select how many pieces of chicken they'll get and also substitute out their waffles for another side if they choose to do so. Their chicken is pretty decent but nothing special in my humble opinion. The skin is very thin and has a light crisp to it. Sometimes, the piece they give doesn't have much meat on it so that is oftentimes quite a bummer. Their waffles are light and fluffy and go great with maple syrup. I find their waffles to be just right and they go perfectly with the chicken.\n\nOther than their chicken and waffles, I've had the chance to try their catfish sandwich and their fried chicken sandwich. They were both pretty good and I really enjoy the balance of meat, coleslaw, and bread. It's just right. The chips that come with the sandwiches are also great and appear to possibly be made in house.\n\nLittle Skillet is a great spot to go with a group to enjoy some southern tastes like the infamous chicken and waffles!", "author": "Joshua M."}

You order at the register on the side and they bring the food to you. \n\nFirst things first, cashier wasn't friendly at all.

I don't expect stellar customer service but it's attitudes like these that kind of put a damper on a first time experience at Little Skillet.\n\nI ordered The Works, which comes with two pieces of fried chicken, two waffles, and a side. My boyfriend ordered the three pieces of fried chicken and a side. They have a great variety of side dishes, from collard greens, mac and cheese, andouille sausage, etc. My boyfriend chose the mac n cheese while I got the andouille sausage. He also wanted thighs only, and they were able to accommodate that, which was nice. What was disappointing was that my waffles were room temperature. I expected a warm fluffy waffle with my fried chicken but it seemed like my waffle wasn't heated at all and it had just been sitting out.

She's literally went the bare minimum when it comes to service, if even.  Unfortunately, she was the only waitress running the place.  It was mildly busy, but not excessively (just before a weekend Giants game).  \n\nI had the chicken and waffles to which our table got a really small batch of chicken compared to other tables...  At this point, it seemed like a rip-off given how much we had paid for chicken.  So we complained to the chef (because the waitress wouldn't check for us).  Even the chef claimed that it was near the end of a batch so they knowingly gave us small pieces...  It's also worth noting that the extras they gave us as an apology were freshly fried and significantly better.  The chicken here wasn't remotely near the best I've had, but it was good.  The waffles were more interesting, having a brioche-like taste that was mildly sour with a syrup that reminded me of rum and raisins.  \n\nMy favorite dialog between the waitress here was when she delivered the waffles we had ordered (plus the extra pieces of chicken).  She was going to take away our number after delivering just the waffles which would usually indicate the order is complete.  I asked her if our chicken was also coming to which she didn't know.  I had to deliberately ask her to check on it for us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-16", "description": "Not sure about all the negative reviews is about for this place, but admittedly I've only been here once so far so my experience may have been rather limited. Came here yesterday for lunch with a coworker based upon Yelp's suggestion and the fact that it was only about a block away from the client site that I was working out of. It's very easy to miss this place because it's located at the end of an alleyway and not visible at all from the main street. \n\nWhile the line certainly was long when we arrived, the wait was only about 5mins before we got to the front. My only complaint about the line was that they placed the shelf with condiments and napkins directly behind the line. Which resulted in people constantly needing to cut in front in order to grab some sauce or utensils. A much more strategic placement of this shelf would have been at the end of the counter closer to the bar where people naturally wind up after placing their orders and not in the way of anyone. \n\nI went for the Po Boy Sandwich and a slice of lemon cake, while the colleague went for the two piece chicken with waffles. Their portion sizes are pretty big, as I was quite surprised by the size of my coworker's waffles. Only thing that I found odd was that they don't provide any syrup for the waffles at the tables (or anywhere else that I could see). After placing your orders, you're given a placard which in place of #'s, have little cards with pictures of flowers or vegetables. A unique spin which added to the pretty cool rustic decor of the establishment. Find a table after paying for your food, and a waiter will come to your table afterwards with your order when it is done. \n\nWhile there are multiple Po Boy sandwiches on the menu, I opted for the catfish as I was feeling fiendishly sly that day and wanted some fish. The bread that it was on was the perfect level of softness and crunch, and matched with the catfish, cole slaw, lettuce and tomatoes, made it an amazing sandwich that really hit the spot for my rumbling tummy. The po boy sandwich also comes with some thick chips that I believe are made in house. They were definitely really good and I wish they sold those in separate bags because I would definitely take some home with me.\n\n\nOh and the lemon pie that I ordered? AMAZING! Took me about all of 30secs to wolf down that utter deliciousness.", "author": "Alex C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-13", "description": "Hmmm. I love fried chicken, but I was a little disappointed with Little Skillet, to be honest. \n\nLocation: The main entrance for Little Skillet is somewhat hidden in an alley way, but inside the building, it's actually quite spacious. The decor has a very rustic feel to it. Lots of wood and mismatched tables, but still very cute. There's definitely more large tables here (think picnic table type), rather than smaller tables, so if you're coming with a smaller party (e.g. 2-3), be prepared to sit at a larger table that you may end up sharing with others if they get busy.\n\nFood:\n- Mini chicken and waffle basket (small, $10): We had to try the chicken and waffles of course, but honestly, I wasn't that impressed. The chicken was very crispy and fried very well, but I felt like it was lacking in flavor. I was a little disappointed. The waffles were quite good and the syrup was more on the thin side, which I liked. But even in terms of the chicken and waffles combo, I've had better. \n\n- Skillet hot wings (small, $9): We ordered these in the buffalo flavor, which was quite good. I feel like we paid too much for the portion size that we were given though...\n\n- Cajun seasoned fries (small, $5): We asked the guy at the counter whether he recommended the cajun fries or the smothered fries, and he responded as if we had asked the most inane, obvious question ever: cajun seasoned fries. So on his \"enthusiastic\" recommendation, we ordered the cajun fries. The verdict? Meh. I love fries, and I thought these were only alright. They didn't taste particularly seasoned to me, but that seemed to be the general theme for food here.\n\n- Side of collard greens: Pretty standard side of collard greens in my opinion. Probably one of the more flavorful parts of the meal.\n\nService:\nAs you can probably tell from my description above, I was not wow-ed by the service here. You order food at a counter on the side of the bar, which would have been fine if it wasn't for the fact that the guy working that counter was so unpleasant. He never smiled at us, which also could have been forgivable if he had at least attempted to be nice. But alas... he treated us like we were the stupidest people to ever set foot in Little Skillet. When we asked for recommendations, he treated our questions like they had obvious answers that we were just too stupid to see. After we finished ordering our food, we asked whether or not we could also order drinks at the counter or if we had to go to the bar. He started repeating \"at the bar\" over and over as if were so dumb that he was worried we wouldn't understand him. Not a great way to make your patrons feel, dude.\n\ntl;dr: Little Skillet was ok food wise, but I do think that our not so pleasant encounter with the guy taking our order left a sour taste in my mouth.

Little Skillet would be somewhere that I would like to sit down and enjoy the food next time around.\n\nOur pick up time was 12:45 pm, and when we got there we had to wait around 5-10 minutes in line to pick up our order. We took some of their hot sauce/ketchup/syrup and then we headed out.\n\nIt took around 10 minutes for us to return to building. Once we began, I went straight into my food. \n\nThe Shrimp Po'Boy itself was fairly plain. I didn't think the remoulade sauce flavor was apparent, this might have been due to the fact that either there was not enough sauce, or the remoulade flavor was not strong. The shrimp itself came in decent sized portions and was tasty by itself. The biggest problem with the Po'Boy is that there is way too much coleslaw in the sandwich. The sandwich tasted like coleslaw almost every bite, when there was shrimp in a bite, I could barely taste it. I want a Po'Boy to either have a very strong remoulade or seafood flavor, or both if they can make it happen. This Po'Boy tasted mostly like colwslaw, and that's not what I want.\n\nThe house chips were stale. I blame myself for taking a long time to get to the chips, so I will be giving the benefit of the doubt. The house chips tasted really good despite being stale with the hot sauce that they had!\n\nOverall, I would not be sure if I would come again. I would come again just to check out the restaurant and other dishes, but I wouldn't get their Po'Boy again.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

My girlfriend is from here and I took her home and now she understands what I mean by that OMG, melt in your mouth like butter, yummy goodness! Anyway on to my review...\n\nAmbiance- we came at 10:30am on a Saturday morning and Drake was cranked up and it was a great vibe. It's all self serve and you just walk up to the counter and order and everyone was super friendly and helpful. I like to decor of the restaurant and the feel was just welcoming!\n\nFood- here we go...everything we got was cold. I figured since it was just opening our food would come out piping hot and fresh but I was disappointed...\n\nShrimp and Grits: I absolutely love shrimp and grits when done correctly...the grits were watery, soupy and grits should be thick and hot! The flavors were there so it was good but if you thicken up the grits, add more cheese and serve it HOT it would be yummy!\n\nChicken and waffles: first off, I have never had chicken and waffles until I moved here and when we were down in Georgia my girl noticed that there weren't any restaurants we went to that offered that...I could be wrong but I honestly think that was something that was thought up here..anyway the chicken was good..a bit bland... and had a nice crunch but again was cold and the waffles were the same. \n\nMac and Cheese: COLD! I'm sure if it was hot it would be good but cold Mac and cheese...no thanks! \n\nIdk if they were just having an off morning, but I'd like to come back another time to maybe see if they serve hot food because then I feel like the food would be ok.

Little Skillet brings the tastes of the South to life in a cool ware-house-like setting.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n-Biscuits and Gravy: They do have a mushroom gravy if you're vegetarian. I wish they made the buscuits more buttery and put more gravy, but I guess you can't have it all, can you? (6/10)\n-2 piece Fried Chicken: Nice and greasy! Lots of white meat- they give you a drum stick and a breast. (9/10)\n-Cheese and grits: Good amount of cheese. Mix with a bit of syrup for optimal taste. (8/10).\n\nOverall, this is a great place for brunch and I would definitely come back.

No. Are you looking for a place that will leave you beyond stuffed with their generous portion size? Then Little Skillet is where it's at.\n\nThis unassuming place was recommended and my pals and I were hankering for some comforting soul food, so what better than a place that serves chicken and waffles. We decided to share among the four of us. Chicken, waffles and sides of mac and cheese. I would say if you think you've seen big chicken pieces at KFC or places like Roscoe's or Lolo's you are mistaken! The chicken pieces here are on steroids and are crispy, juicy and seasoned well. They tasted amazing with hot sauce. The only let down is that their waffles are nothing close to what you would expect from southern places, richly flavored with cinnamon and on the thin side. The waffles served here are thick, Belgium styled waffles. They didn't taste like much and the syrup didn't do much for it either. I found it difficult to eat, as they come served in to-go boxes and you need to grab some plates to eat if you are dining in. I noticed a lot of mention about their syrup and I also found it very thick and syrupy, with no distinct maple flavor to it. The mac and cheese, on the other hand, was deliciously rich and cheesy. \n\nService was reasonably fast, considering they are frying chicken. Price is a little on the higher side per person. Seating was a little uncomfortable at small sized table, but definitely fun for anxious people to rock the little antique sewing machine pedal on the bottom.

Even though they said this would take 15 minutes to prepare, that dish actually came out first, so if you're hesitating because of the time to prepare, just go for it!  \n\nI ordered the Big Skillet Breakfast Sandwich with fried chicken and waffle.

Two trips later, and here I am, having dinner with the best of SF company. On my first and what will likely be my only visit, I arrived and felt easily at home at how casual this establishment is. Exactly as un-pretentious as most Southern joints I've spent considerable time in in the Deep South (Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee). I was wowed by the Southernness of it all, but deeply disappointed with the food. The venue is self-service, so this review is only for the food and ambiance. \n\nMy party of five ordered chicken, listening to Nei N's recommendation to get chicken with a side of chicken. Except that's not technically possible, so we ordered chicken with a side of mac, seasoned french fries, and waffles. The waffles were the star of the show-light and flaky, almost like beignets. The chicken, however, failed to meet expectations and left us in sore disappointment. The coating didn't even meet the definition of fried chicken. It was almost like panko baked chicken. Maybe this meets the definition of NorCal fried chicken, where its lightly fried, so its not so bad for your health and health conscious people won't feel as guilty? Yeah no. The mac n cheese was cold and runny, and I'm sad to say that at a table full of historically plate-cleaners, everything was barely touched. \n\nNeedless to say, I made a hop skip and jump over to Renton, WA, and had waffle-encrusted fried chicken (yes, its a thing!) that satisfied my craving and that of every other health-conscious Seattleite looking to cheat on their kale salad in the southern suburbs.", "author": "Jen B."}

Great when eaten with some of that Crystal's hot sauce between bites of syrup soaked waffles.\n\nArnold Palmer: I really don't go out of my way for Iced Tea or Lemonade, but for some reason their combo really does it for me.

A perfect casual brunch/lunch place with a nice little outdoor seating area, there was also inside seating but we chose to sit outside because it was a bit more quiet compared to the inside. We came as a party of four, we all go the fried chicken with sides. For me I got the three piece with waffles and biscuits and sausage gravy which I enjoyed a lot. The chicken had a nice crisp skin with a good amount of flavor, the meat was juicy but lacked flavor maybe if it was a bit more like salted or marinated, it would've been superb. My favorite was the waffles, it was crispy and had a fluffy center which was amazing! the gravy and biscuits were okay but the gravy was really good creamy and flavorful. We also got the beignets but I didn't really like it because it had like a thick dinner roll like texture. Even though it was counter style ordering the food runners were really nice. Overall this is a nice little brunch spot to enjoy some yummy chicken and waffle.", "author": "Maybeline C."}

The fact that it's a special treat makes bad fried chicken especially disappointing. I was not disappointed here. \n\nLittle Skillet is inside a bar, tucked away in a corner. I ordered at the front desk and give minutes later my food was ready. I got the two piece chicken with mashed sweet potatoes for $11. This was a lot of food. Enough for two meals. And the chicken? Delicious. Cooked perfectly. Moist on the inside, crispy on the outside. Not too greasy  (but a little bit, hence the one start deduction) Spiced perfectly. Definitely worth the calories. And the mashed sweet potatoes? Heaven. I was super full but still had to force myself to stop eating.\n\nMy recommendation: Go here. Get the chicken.

I wouldn't get the waffles if you like yours fluffy.\n\nWe also got a market salad to share, which wasn't terribly good. Very plain. Maybe we didn't drown it in enough dressing.\n\nSecond time, I got the ribs, a cup of gumbo, and a side of collard greens. The greens had a nice sour kick to it and the seafood gumbo was delicious!\n\nI would definitely recommend the gumbo--big, juicy morsels of seafood and nicely spiced.\n\nThe ribs though, were disappointing--a bit dry and I was pretty unimpressed by the BBQ sauce.

Venue is tavern-like but at the same time very welcoming and cozy. You place an order at the cashier and receive a number, and they bring you your food. I have always been a skeptic when it came to chicken and waffles, and I've even tried Roscoe's in LA and was very unimpressed. However Little Skillet has changed my whole outlook on this odd combination!\n\nFirst of all, the chicken has the PERFECT fried skin/meat ratio. You don't get that fatty, oily taste when you bite into the leg. I don't know how to explain it, but it tastes \"healthier,\" than your average chicken wing.  In addition, the syrup doesn't taste as fatty/sugary, and even though it is a little more liquidy it still does the job of giving you that sweet maple taste. The waffles too are super good quality and don't remind me at all of Eggo.... 100% will come back!!!!!!!!", "author": "Genevieve M."}

I had the chicken and waffles.  Overall quality of food was good.  The waffle was delicious and had a great flavor.  I thought the chicken was not as good as the waffle.  It did not have a lot of substance to it.  Mainly just at a lot of breading and not a lot of meat.  That was a little disappointing.  My friend ordered the chicken and some mac and cheese.

If I were at some bar and they served me Little Skillet's chicken and waffles for $8 then I'd be pretty satisfied with my purchase, but the fact people would come back for $15 of meh chicken is crazy to me. If I ever return it will only be because my coworkers peer pressured me. tl:dr go to halal cart", "author": "Zaid E."}

Best place that serves chicken n' waffles in San Francisco, hands down!\n\nMy friend and I shared the 8 piece chicken and waffles. The waffles were perfect! Just the right amount of crunchiness and softness. Also, the syrup wasn't overly sweet and tasted like it contained a bit of cinnamon? We got to choose which type of meat we preferred, which was awesome, since we love legs and thighs! The skin was flavorful and the meat was tender and juicy. I'm drooling just thinking about that meal!\n\nThe 2 piece chicken and waffles combo with a side is great as well! The seasoned fries I ordered as my side was delicious! Do pair the yummy chicken with their hot sauce!\n\nAmbience is nice. Perfect place to hang out with friends, even though it is always crazy packed and loud.

The waiter at the window said \"My computer just went down, you will need to go inside to place your order\".\n\nI get inside, and happily choose the cob salad, and sweet mashed potatoes to go.  The patron in front of me, had ordered a Cesar salad (after a lot of back and forth with the to-go waiter as she put the wrong order in twice). I sit down, and start reading news forgetting that I have been sitting there for thirty minutes.  I look up and realize that several people after me had received their food, I go to the counter to inquire on the status of my order -to which the reply was \"our printer/computer in the kitchen went down for about a half our\".  The patron before me realized the same thing, and questions his order status -to then be asked several times what he ordered. \n\nI finely received my food, from by the looks of the situation it's the manager -who seemed annoyed that he had to apologize for the wait.  I couldn't tell if it was stress, or him just being kind of jerk. Either way I was polite and rushed back to my office where I got to eat a small portion of my angrily made salad before having to rush into a meeting.\n\nAfter finely getting to eat said salad, and some of the tasteless sweet mashed potatoes I would say that the food is not worth the $18.00 plus dollars.  I would also say, that in a restaurant crisis, the staff has horrible plan B skills on how to recover from a power outage/down kitchen printer.  Really I would have let all of this go and chalked it up to a bad day for them -if the manager had been a smidge nicer and gracious about the whole thing. \n\nI will not be going here again, and if you really want awesome fried chicken on a salad -there is a salad place next to Safeway (where they specialize in Salad) -it will knock your socks off (and if they fudge up your order, the manager won't be a D about it).", "author": "christopher s."}

The location itself is a bit out of the way - around AT&T Park and tucked into a random alleyway. \n\nI ordered the 2 piece fried chicken with a side. Seasoned fries for me - What can I say? It was a fries kind of day for me. Anyway, the food came on a metal food tray that was super reminiscent of those old school cafeteria meals. Upon first glace, the chicken looked amazing and I wanted to gobble up the fries. I didn't understand the extremely small corn muffin or bite size piece of watermelon. For the record, the corn muffin was just okay - I like a little more crunchy to soft contrast. The watermelon was good - too bad I got something the size of an orange slice. \n\nWait wait wait! Back to the old school cafeteria tray plating. I was slightly bothered by how it affected the meal. I appreciate the concept BUT I would prefer a plate. Since it was a metal tray it came with a thin brown paper lining. It definitely was NOT the sturdy butcher paper you'd wrap nice cuts of meat with, so as I tried to portion out the large pieces of chicken the paper softened and tore. Since I don't really like the sound of cutting metal on metal, I spent the entire meal trying to delicately eat my food and avoid paper sticking to my chicken. \n\nAt last.. the food. Good portions for the price, however, it was noticeably disappointing a few minutes in. The chicken skin was crispy and the meat was juicy while the fries were wonderfully seasoned with a crisp outer and soft inside. Unfortunately, after a few bites I noticed the chicken was a bit under-seasoned and the same went for the fries.

I was impressed, and I grew up in Texas.\n\nFrom previous research and second-hand information, I was expecting to have to order from a window facing an alley and then eat my order while standing in said alley, but a sign in the window pointed me to order from inside of Victory Hall & Parlor instead. What a pleasant surprise that I got to enjoy my food indoors at a nice wooden table!\n\nAt first, I waffled between getting the 2-piece chicken and waffles or 2-piece chicken and side. You probably never thought about it, but it's hard to choose between Belgian-style waffles and mac 'n' cheese. Then my eyes traveled to the bottom left corner of the menu and noticed something called The Works ($17.50). This was the juxtaposition of the two main options: 2 pieces of chicken, waffles, and your choice of side. Perfect! It even came with a slice of watermelon and a cute little jalape\u00f1o cornmuffin to live up to its name.\n\nThe sides: I slurped up the watermelon slice first: it was refreshing and lovely. The waffles were fluffy and dense at the same time. (I know: it sounds paradoxical, but it's true.) The syrup enhanced the waffle experience and wasn't cloyingly sweet. The mac 'n' cheese was solid but nothing spectacular. The cornmuffin was a perfect mixture of spiciness and sweetness.\n\nThe main attraction: the fried chicken was superbly crispy on the outside. The inside was moist for the breast piece I received, but the wing was actually a little bit on the moderately dry side. No biggie: still delicious. If there were an option to get spicy fried chicken batter, my life would have been 110% complete. At the end of it all, I was happily full and covered in grease. I bet the other diners (who varied from yuppies basking in the hipster ambience of the bar to humble blue-collar folks) wondered why a petite Asian woman was stuffing her face full of comfort food in the corner by herself.

We weren't sure what to eat so I just yelped \"food\" and looked at whatever came up. 4 stars for Little Skillet? Sounds good to me! And their location is so close to caltrain that it's perfect for lazy people to get a meal and go! \n\nComing in, Little Skillet is connected to a bar now I guess and there's someone outside who checks your ID to insure you're of age. Little Skillet is towards the back, you can't really miss it. Their menu is small so ordering doesn't really take long. \n\nService was nice and quick. You order and pay, the worker gives you a number to take to a table, you sit and wait, get your food and utensils, and boom. Time to eat\n\nI got their 2 piece side with chicken and I was surprised it came with waffles because it didn't say so on the menu, but boy am I happy it did. The waffles are delicious and their maple syrup is actually, like, fresh maple syrup. None of that Mrs. Butterworth stuff, no sirree.  And the chicken was amazing. So much flavor. Argh. I wasn't crazy about their corn bread muffin because it had a bit of a jalapeno flavor mixed in there. And for a side, I got their mashed sweet potatoes which was definitely sweet, but I wasn't too crazy about. Still decent, though. Don't get me wrong! \n\nOverall, definitely going to come back. Their chicken and waffles were the best I've had so far. :)", "author": "Venus L."}

Normally fried chicken usually makes me feel really greasy and gross afterwards, but Farmerbrown's somehow manages to have a perfectly crunchy seasoned skin and juicy interior without feeling oily at all! The waffles are incredibly good as well and compliment the chicken perfectly. \n\nThe sides I think may be hit or miss. The sweet potato mash tasted very fresh and simple (which I liked), but the macaroni and cheese was seriously lacking in cheese, which is kind of blasphemous. The lemonade I got was also very refreshing and tart and went really well with the meal. I'm actually pretty happy I don't live in SF right now or anywhere near this place.

I'm usually not a huge fan of fried chicken, and I've never tried chicken and waffles at any other restaurant, but I have to say this did live up to the hype! The chicken was cruncy outside and juicy and flavorful inside. The waffle was crisp on the outside but light and fluffy on the inside. Mix the two together along with the syrup and hot sauce and you've got an amazing combo! Also thought the sweet potato mash and macaroni were very on point.\n\nWe also ordered a few of the waffle dogs out of curiosity, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! The hot dog is wrapped in bacon and lays on top of a bun sized waffle. The savory and sweet mix really well together just like the chicken and waffles, and it also comes with homemade chips! \n\nDefinitely would like to try it again and eat at the restaurant to get the full experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-09", "description": "What can I say?  Little Skillet has grown on me, and I find myself reflecting on my prior review, and feeling as though I graded them too harshly.  I've had a chance to try tons of other delivery options in the area, but I keep coming back to Little Skillet!  Part of that is how much I adore Chicken and Waffles, but to Little Skillet's credit, they are incredibly consistent, and I really value that when ordering for lunchtime at work.\n\nI order via Eat24, and one of the weird quirks about Little Skillet is they never quote the right delivery time, but that's because they quote delivery times that would be boarder-line magical if they were able to deliver in that time.  For example, my last order, they confirmed a 15 minute delivery time, and it was actually delivered in 45 minutes.  I don't consider that to be \"late\" because in my experience, 45 minutes is pretty normal as far as delivery times go, it's just weird to get a notification from the app of when I can expect the food, knowing with certainty that I need to add 30-40 minutes to that quoted time.  It also still really grinds my gears when they put the chicken and the waffles in the same to-go box -- the waffles end up crushed in addition to being soggy, and sometimes the little syrup cup breaks open and gets everywhere.\n\nBut as I said at the top, the best part about this place is how consistently good the experience is, especially the food itself.  The fried chicken is always sublime, probably the best fried chicken you can get delivered in downtown SF.  The waffles, while soft and floppy, are (when you order 3 pieces of chicken instead of 2) *usually* put in a separate box from the chicken (!!!), meaning that they are warm and chewy, and great for dipping in the amazing syrup provided (I cannot rave enough about this syrup, it's so good!).  Turns out, 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles makes a wonderfully filling meal that, if I avoid the food coma, leaves me full and satisfied the rest of the day.\n\nFurther, my orders have never been late (e.g. took longer than 60 minutes to arrive), have never been incomplete (missing items), and I've never had an issue getting the food from the delivery person (they call me, I come out and get the food, no issues).  I've probably ordered from Little Skillet more than 10 times since my first review, and I'll keep coming back thanks to such a consistently good experience.  I now happily recommend Little Skillet to my co-workers.  Four stars.", "author": "Dan D."}

You will be very, very happy with what you get here. Don't confuse this place with the other Farmerbrown's by Market. If you're meeting friends here, make sure you clarify the address! \n\nOnce you step inside, it's a little confusing. The atmosphere is intimate but casual, with typical SF wood-hipster-esque decorations. There are two big rooms connected together, and Farmerbrown's is a little booth on the left side of the first room. Order from the booth and then grab a table anywhere you'd like. They give you a table number (it's actually a seed packet, not a number, which is adorably hipster) and serve the food to wherever you decide to sit. I believe this place is actually called Victory Hall & Parlor, which is a bar -- this makes it an awesome place to drink some tap beers after work and enjoy fantastic comfort food!\n\nThe waffles are crunchy on the outside but inside they're so light and fluffy in a way you can't even imagine until you try it! Very sweet though, so if you're sensitive to sweetness then don't add too much syrup. After you add the syrup, the taste will be so overwhelmingly magical, you're going to be feeling some sensory overload (don't worry, I won't judge you for any satisfied moans emitting from your mouth). \n\nThe chicken itself is tasty and tender. If you're looking for heart-attack-inducing grease, though, you're not going to get that here. I'm still pretty spoiled with chicken and waffles from my favorite place across the bay (900 Grayson in Berkeley -- you really can't beat their gravy). \n\nIn terms of sides, they always give you a small bite-sized piece of cornbread, which is just okay. For the choice of side, I've gotten the grits, the mac & cheese, and the fries. There's nothing too special about any of them... However, this is one of the only places you can get grits in the city, so that definitely puts it higher on my list. \n\nOne of the drawbacks about this place is the price (about $17 for a single order of 2 chicken pieces with 2 waffles + 1 side). If not for the price, I'd be coming here a lot more often because it's a 5 minute walk from where I live (right by the Caltrain station).

I had the hardest time choosing which side because everything looked so good!! I ended up ordering the biscuit side because I. Adore. Biscuits. And am compelled to order them if they are an option, everywhere I go. But then my friend ordered the seasoned fries and the mashed sweet potatoes so I got to try those too.\n\nThe biscuit was disappointing. It was hard, and not warm. It might have been one of the worst biscuits I've ever had. KFC biscuits are more tasty, and fluffier. However, the biscuit did come with some butter that was slightly sweet and hence unique so after I slathered a bunch of it on the biscuit, the taste greatly improved after that.\n\nThe fried chicken was good, but not amazing. I liked the drumstick piece so much more than the thigh piece. But it's small. Small drumstick! The seasoned fries were good. The cajun seasoning was flavorful but not overwhelming. The jalapeno corn muffin is TINY. But good. I think it would have been amazing if it came warmed.\n\nMy favorite side dish by far was the mashed sweet potatoes. I want to come back just to order this for myself. They taste like sweet potatoes which is great, and they also have a hint of mashed potato taste!! IT WAS DELICIOUS. 10/10 recommend!\n\nLove the decor in here! There are a bunch of different types of seating available, and you seat yourself after you place your order at the front. There is a parlor that doesn't seem like it's always open, but that area has two tables with high cushy seats for 2-4 people and then a long L couch (I wanted to sit here but it was occupied by a large group when we got there). The numbers they give you to put on your table so they can deliver your food to you aren't numbers. Each \"number\" is a different vegetable on a card!

The bartender was super friendly and not over talkative. The beer & wine selection was great. The fried chicken was everything I was craving.

As a fried chicken lover, I've been to a few different locations (whether they specialize in fried chicken or not) to taste test.  This one is probably my favorite that I've had in downtown SF!  You order at the counter and seat yourself.  Tables and seating were clean which I definitely appreciate for a bar/fried chicken joint (not so typical).  there's seating in two different rooms, one with more light which was quieter and one in the main area next to the bar.  So you have your pick of what ambience to go for, loud and exciting or quiet to have more private conversations.  I went on a Wednesday after work and it wasn't hard to find a table.  While you're waiting, you can grab a drink at the bar - oh, btw this place is half restaurant, half bar!!  Double win!  Unfortunately, I didn't order a drink because I didn't want to take up space before the food came.  But side note to self to try their cocktails next time I go.\n\nMy 2 friends and I shared the 8 piece fried chicken meal which also comes with 2 sides of your choice or waffles.  We opted in for the sides and chose the jalapeno cornbread muffins (a little lackluster and dry but I liked how bitesize they were) and seasoned fries (must try!!).  The chicken was split up into: 2 drumsticks, 2 wings and 4 breasts.  The pieces, especially the breast, were ginormous.  We couldn't finish everything but I think this meal would be perfect for a group of 4. It was hard not to overeat when the chicken was that juicy and the skin was that crispy,  We also luckily came in during National Waffle Day and they gave us 2 free waffles.  The waffles were alright, nothing noteworthy.  They came with a small side of syrup which didn't seem enough.  Syrup tasted a little strange to me.", "author": "Michelle B."}

She lives in the area, and we ended up walking over. \n\nWe decided to get the Chicken and Waffles with a side of cornbread, and a blackened shrimp po'boy. Overall the food was pretty good.\n\nChicken: Very crispy. Had strong chicken flavor, but not a lot of seasoning. It was a solid pairing with the waffles. They only used the thigh/wing, so not sure how i feel about this. I usually like a mix of white/dark meat to compare the quality.\n\nWaffles: Super crispy. The syrup was GOLD. mmm...a little goes a long way. But a lot wouldn't be too bad.\n\nJalapeno Cornbread: The side of cornbread are 5 mini-muffin sized cornbreads. They were okay, but I felt a little dry. And not very Jalapeno-flavored. So...if you don't like spicy, this is fine for you. Kinda wish they had some butter to go with this though. \n\nPo'Boy: Probably the best thing out of it all. The shrimp were pretty giant, and the portion for the price. It was also really flavorful, and came with a side of chips. Mmm.\n\nI also had their ginger lemonade, which really hit the spot.\n\nAmbiance: It's crowded and LOUD. Looked like half their space was taken up by a private party, but I couldn't hear very well. Also...folks, check your privilege. Throwing your jacket on a table you're not using in a crowded room is basically saying \"my jacket is more important than the business's business.\"  Rude.

While close to the Caltrain, the bar is in an alley which is a little bit sketchy. Nonetheless, we're all safe in San Fran right! :) Got into Little Skillet and was pretty impressed with the decor + music. I was feeling a burger so I just got a regular burger & fries (typical bar food), while my friends got \"The Works\" - Little Skillet's speciality of fried chicken & a side. Our food arrived very quickly, so I had no problem craving for my burger. The meat was cooked well, although I felt there should have been less raw onions and vegetables on the burger (caramelized or cooked would have been a lot better!), and my friends told me their fried chicken was a little dry. That being said, it was definitely still appetizing and our group's opinion was the food was... \"alright!\" \n\nOverall I felt the prices were a little bit higher than I would have liked ($14 for a standard burger), and I definitely think food could have been cooked/prepared a little better.

It's tucked away, so unless you plan on going here, you'll probably walk right past it.\n\nService: I walked up to the window at a little after 11AM. A little early for lunch, but I had been up since 5:15AM. I asked if they were open and then a few minutes later, a lady came to the window to take my order. I ordered the two piece chicken and waffles and waited about 10 minutes for my order to be ready for pick up.\n\nFood: Wow. They do fried chicken right. The chicken wasn't overly oily. It was nicely seasoned with a slight crunch that was subtle enough for texture, yet easy on the teeth. The waffles were also done well. They had an outer crunch and the rest was soft and chewy. It soaked up the syrup well. The combination of sweet and savory was amazing. I haven't had chicken and waffles at very many places, but this place did it justice.\n\nCost: At $10 for two pieces of chicken and two square waffles, it's not too bad. It's VERY filling and I could have stopped after only eating half, but it was too good to let it go to waste (waffles never taste good the day after). Also, you can specify what cut of the chicken you want because the ladies who ordered after me asked for two chicken breasts (I got a chicken breast and a drumstick).\n\nWould I return?

We had just picked up tickets for the SF Giants and were in the area of the park. The Little Skillet had just opened it's doors so we decided to go in. \n\nThe decor is very cool - including two overturned trolleys as tables and stools! Craft beers. I thought our friends joining us, who are SanFran locals would love the place, so we stayed and ordered food. \n\nIf you like chicken and waffles, THIS is the place in sanfran to get it. They even have a mini chicken and waffles if you just want a snack (but who only wants a chicken and waffle snack?) \n\nOur friends showed up, and LOVED the place, and said they would be back, and very soon.", "author": "Tova B."}

The worker double charged my credit card and when I called to get a refund, whoever picked up the phone sounded irritated with me as if it was my fault I got charged twice! She kept saying she doesn't see any double charges on her end so we kept going back and fourth for about 20 minutes then finally she found a mistake on her end and gave me a refund. I know everyone makes mistakes so I'm not mad about the double charge but what I am PISSED about is that they were very rude over the phone when I was trying to explain to them what was going on. So for that you get 2 stars. I do not care how good the food is, if your customer service is SHITTY I will never come back here again. P.S. clean your utensils and tables!

The food was ready, packed, and bagged at the time I had asked for. I had gotten the fried chicken with waffles and seasoned fries. The chicken was excellent: crunchy on the outside and yet moist inside. It was well seasoned and the texture was really nice. The waffles were fluffy and light, and came with some bourbon flavoured maple syrup. And the fries were skin on and seasoned lightly, yet just enough. Next time, I'm going to order to stay, because the place looked very warm and friendly. And the drinks looked inviting too. Awesome place. :-)\n\nBonus story: Back in April 2015, I had visited Kate's kitchen, on Haight street. And I had, surprise surprise, fried chicken.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-02", "description": "Actual rating 4.5 stars, rounded up because of the uniqueness of the experience - you can't really do this in San Diego.\n\nBTW their chicken and waffles is another item on the 7x7 \"Things to Eat in SF Before You Die\". It's #95 on the 2012 listing, but I also didn't know of this until after the fact.\n\n---\nWhen I do lab tours for hospitals around the Bay Area I also do a nearby restaurant search for cheap eats around the area and see what I can come up with. This was one of the top results that came up for the lab I was to tour that day. I took advantage of the $20 daily maximum at China Basin because parking around the SoMa area sucks in general (really expensive too). \n\nThe \"restaurant\" is literally a hole-in-the-wall tucked in Ritch Street; you won't find it unless you know where to look. Cars normally don't pass by this street. There's a small counter where the condiments and utensils are and standing room for one, maybe two people can stand but definitely not more. The \"dining area\" is a loading dock across from where you order. There's small blue cushions you can use if you don't want your clothes dirty.\n\nWhen I went the line went by quickly; within 10-15 minutes of falling in line I placed my order. For those that say they take cash only: I was able to use credit card with no problems.\n\nLike any restaurant on that list, I got what they were known for: chicken and waffles (2 pieces for $9.99). They come in take-out containers that contain 2 pieces of fried breast meat and 2 waffles done in the Belgian style. The maple syrup is in a small cup to either pour or dip. I dip my waffles in the syrup to not only not make a mess, but to avoid syrup on my chicken.\n\nTheir breast meat is excellent and exemplifies a GOOD breast meat; small meat size with crisp skin that is even throughout the chicken and moist and juicy meat. I was able to gobble up both pieces quite easily considering that I normally don't eat chicken breasts, especially if the meat is dry. Also excellent was that the chicken didn't taste too oily. The waffle is also very crispy, as crispy as the chicken skin. This was great as soggy and chewy waffles SUCK and it made the maple syrup stick to the waffle. \n\nWith a Mexican Coke, this was a $13 well spent for my meal for the day.

I'm not the biggest fan of chicken and waffles, but I'm always open to trying new things and new places. So the reviews on here looked good and it's near my work place, so I figured why not.\n\nParking is difficult, as you would expect. It's just street parking in an alley. There is no dining area or tables, so it's all just take-out. You can sit on the dock nearby.\n\nThe chicken. The fried chicken tasted like something from KFC. I kid you not. The skin was more soggy than crunchy. At Rosco's the skin is perfectly crispy, crunch with each bite. At Little Skillet, it's soft and soggy. I thought it was a fluke until I ate the other two pieces. Consistently soggy. The chicken wasn't dry, it was oily. The waffles were soft, no real flavor to them and the syrup quite sweet. I was hoping the waffle would have a nice crunchy exterior with soft interior, but it's just soft all around, which is good if you like that kind of waffle.\n\nI will try this place one more time to see if my results are consistent or if that day was a fluke.

When I was a kid, I had this strange habit where I would only eat the skin of the fried chicken that we ordered (I never ate the meat). 15+ years of the Food Channel and a couple of nutrition classes later, I realized that I've been doing it wrong all this time (well... half wrong).\n\nWe went to this place on a SF food adventure trip and man, this was a good pick. We decided to only eat a little food at each place so we could sample everything, but I would have been ok with just eating my full lunch here. The chicken was fried perfectly with a warm and crunchy exterior, while coating the juicy meat inside. As a person who judged fried chicken by their skin for half his life, this place nailed it with their batter. \n\nThe waffle that accompanied it was super fluffy, but I eat MEAT and all I could focus on was the chicken. This place is kind of hidden and you'll probably end up squatting on the sidewalk to eat your meal, but it's definitely worth it. So go ahead and feast in the streets.

You can tell that they really put in the effort to make every last detail count. \n\nThe food itself was decent. I got a two piece chicken & waffles, and my friend ordered the shrimp po-boy. I haven't had too much experience with soul food, so I don't really have much to compare this restaurant to, but I thought everything was solid. My friend really enjoyed her sandwich, especially the bread, which she said was fantastic. We also both got the strawberry lemonade (seasonal), which was good but VERY sweet. \n\nService was just okay for me. The guys behind the counter didn't seem too enthusiastic to be there, but they were good about helping us decide on what to order, as well as accommodating the humongous party that came in after we did by opening up the hidden lounge behind one of the walls (another point about fantastic interior design).

People usually just eat in the alley way or you can bring your food wherever. \n\nSo I open the box up and everything looks crispy and tasty. I took a bite of the chicken, it was definitely crispy. It wasn't particularly hot or cold, I think it was lukewarm or semi-cold. It seems like it's been sitting out there to cool, but nothing is soggy. \n\nI like the crispiness of the chicken. Other than that, I don't think it was particularly flavorful. I have had better fried chicken. So I was really excited for the waffle, but I guess the way it looked isn't the way I expected it to test. I thought it'll be crispy and a little bit sweeter, but it wasn't.

I'm a lightweight, form your opinions elsewhere.\n\nLastly, I will be back some time, I want to try the waffles and mushroom gravey.

Instead of working with me I was rudely told what cannot happen and then hung up on. I was told I didn't order a certain thing when it was clearly on my purchase order. This is the fourth time Lil skillet has done this to me as well as my co-workers. I used to patronize this place ,overlooking the draw backs. Today was the final straw. Goodbye Lil skillet you're fried!!", "author": "Leon R."}

I grew up eating fried chicken from KFC, so it's always been chicken and biscuits for me. Mmmmm KFC biscuits...\n\nAnyway, we came here for brunch, and I got the two piece with a side of biscuits. The biscuits weren't that great, just kinda cold and dry. It also came with a little corn muffin that was bland and largely forgettable. The chicken, on the other hand, was really good. The batter was crispy and not too thick. It was well seasoned, and I could taste the zesty herbs and celery salt. The breast piece is the real test of chicken, and Little Skillet unquestionably passed. In addition to the delicious seasoning, the breast meat was cooked very well and was still juicy inside. Next time, I would just get chicken with a side of more chicken.", "author": "Nei N."}

It's like fast casual so u don't have a server.  U order at the counter and they bring it out to you.  The issue I have with this place is our food was cold.  That's because its pre-made. The chicken was ok (Popeyes and Harold's is better and more flavorful and a bit cheaper).  The biscuit sandwich was really tasty. We also got a side of country gravy which costs $5 (it's treated as a side item) but was just okay.  Potatoes and waffles both were cold.", "author": "Diana D."}

I know that's a huge thing to claim but after eating her a few times the food is consistently good. Basically if you come here then you need to order the chicken and waffles. \n\nChicken - The batter is crispy, light and oh so tasty. I usually don't eat the skin when it comes to fried chicken but I eat it here every time. The meat is tasty and tender and I wonder to myself how I could ever eat another fried chicken place. Sorry Church's (I still like them biscuits)\n\nWaffles - First thought is, how good can a waffle be right? Well its good. Light, sweet, fluffy, crispy (if i could describe it with other words you can insert them here) and somehow the perfect pairing for that fried chicken.\n\nThey are in a back alley so most folks end up sitting on the loading dock of the building across the alley way which is a nice spot to hang out and chat.

The waffles weren't as thick as I'm used to and not as crunchy on the outside as I'm used to but they were still good.

If you haven't had it yet, you're missing out.\n\nFood:\nMy one-line assessment above pretty much says it all.  Best fried chicken I have had in a long time.  My previous fave fried chicken was at Wayfare Tavern, but Little Skillet has supplanted TyFlo's recipe.  It's.  Just.  Magic.  A friend and I took down an 8-piece order without prejudice. Crispy, meaty, and delicious.  Not greasy and not heavy.\nSides are tasty, too.  Don't skip the collard greens.  Mac and Cheese was ok, and the jalapeno coleslaw needed more jalapeno, in my opinion.  But you can always add hot sauce, so no worries. Full marks awarded.\n\nService:\nCounter service inside Victory Hall and Parlor is great.  No fuss and food came out pretty quickly.\n\nVibe:\nSpeakeasy-chic.  I love Victory Hall for its mellow vibe and great bartenders.  Having kick-ass fried chicken added to the mix just makes sense.\n\nFamily-friendly:\nIf your kids like the stuff that comes in a red-and-white bucket, then they will LOVE this.  Teach the young'uns what real fried chicken tastes like.\n\nSummary:\nYou need some of this fantastic stuff. Go get yourself a cocktail and some chicken.  You deserve it.", "author": "Aneesh B."}

Usually, there isn't too much of a crowd after 8pm so I usually get my food quickly at the bar enjoying a drink.  The previous night, the place was super crowded and the kitchen was backed up...so backed up that it took them 25 minutes to get to me my burger and fries.  I literally only had ten minutes to take a few bites, close out my bar tab, and hustle over to Caltrain.  I had to bag the rest of the food and reheat it later!\n\nThe food is good but since they are listed on Eat24 so not only do they deal with the customers in the building but the online ones as well.  If you're in doubt whether or not you have enough time to eat before catching your next train, then make sure to ask or take a look around the room for tall freestanding pickup order stands.  Their food doesn't deserve to be scarfed down like a competitive eater!  \n\nI do recommend the crab cakes and the burger which I did squeeze in a couple of bites before leaving.  The crab cakes were the right size and comes with some greens to help balance it out.\n\nI'll still be coming back here for my late Caltrain meal but will be more aware and realistic of whether I truly have enough time to enjoy my food.", "author": "Ben H L."}

I had a breakfast sandwich made with biscuits, a sausage patty, and topped with eggs.  The potatoes were great and the eggs were cooked well, but I couldn't get over the fact of how sweet the patty and even the \"biscuit\" were.

One of those alley joints- where once junkies slept- is now a really nice place to eat. So, me and one other person came here and ordered the chicken po boy and a fish sandwich, I think. A side of greens and the hibiscus lemonade and the ginger lemonade. The hibiscus one was pretty good. The actual restaurant was nice. It was temperature wise- perfect. It was cool and not all bright and sunny- I had a migraine so this worked for me. They had CNN, basketball, and some other sports channel on at the bar. There's a smaller room where there's a bar on the right side of the place- it's probably for parties- I don't know. The bathroom was dark. But pretty cool as far as the cranks they have as stall handles. All the steel was nice. It was clean and smelled like it was recently wiped down. The food was done pretty quickly. The chips? Super good. The sandwich I had was good. The chicken was one big breast piece. And when I bit it- the whole piece of meat came out. Slaw and pickles as well. But I ate every bit of it. The fish sandwich was supposedly good. I don't eat fish. But, I'll suggest that to anybody who does eat fish- it looked yummy. This place for me- was pretty pricey. I wouldn't go here again because of that part- I could think of so many other places I'd rather go for the amount of money. That lemonade tho? I'd gladly buy that by the pitcher.

Even though the workers were friendly when taking your order, it felt at times that the kitchen had forgotten some people's orders. Even at the back end of the lunch hour, there were still a handful of customers who had been standing around waiting for their food to arrive for what seemed like way too long.\n\nThat being said, the decor is pleasant (succulents galore!) and you can head to the bar next door to sit down and eat your food afterwards.\n\nFood:\n- Jalapeno Coleslaw: 1 jalapeno. Lots of disappointment. There was nothing special about this side, and since I expected some spice, it was an even bigger letdown when I tasted nothing but the dressing. Luckily, there's a substantial amount of slaw.\n\n- 2 pieces of chicken + waffles: The chicken was moist, but also way too oily for my taste.

It includes 2 pcs of their fried chicken, 2 pc waffle, a mini cornmuffin and your choice of a side. All that for $14. For my side I got the Mac and cheese. I also got their seasonal lemonade which was a refreshing strawberry watermelon lemonade for about $4. My bf ordered the pulled pork Benedict which was about $14 as well. \n\nWe placed our order, paid and chose our seats and shortly after our food came! Supe quick! My fried chicken was goooood. The skin was crispy and the meat was still tender. The Mac and cheese was a little bit too al dente for me and the cheese sauce coating the elbow macaroni was a little bit watered down for my taste. The waffles with that maple syrup was super good! The waffle were light and airy and the syrup came on the side so you don't end up with soggy waffles. I tasted a little bit of my bf's pulled pork Benedict and it tasted pretty good. The pulled pork was flavorful for me but he said it was just alright.\n\nOverall great brunch food and drink find off the beaten path! I gotta try those biscuits and gravy soon though!

They have a condiments/ utensils stand right next to the window. The girl who took our order was really friendly. \n\nTaste: \nI ordered the 2 piece chicken and waffle meal. I got a leg and breast, 2 waffles and some syrup on the side. I really liked the box that the meal came in; it's very sturdy. I liked the flavor of the chicken over-all. The leg was nice and moist, but my breast was a little bit on the drier side. The meat didn't have too much flavor, but that's where the skin comes in. It was crunchy and flavorful. The let down was the waffle. The description says Belgian waffle, and I am used to the one's with the chunks of crystal inside. This waffle was overly crispy in my opinion, I wish there was more of a chewy texture in the inside. I wasn't really sure if the waffle should have been savory or sweet because it had powdered sugar on top, but it almost tasted savory to me. [But maybe this is how the waffle should be]. I tasted my friend's mac and cheese, and it was pretty good. I don't know much about good or bad mac and cheese, because I am not a big fan of it in general.\n\nThe total came out to $11.42 with tax.

Make sure to drizzle each bite with their homemade green sauce. \nA little kick of spicy, a little bit sweet, and is perfect for the already good chicken.\n\nYou have you try the waffles here too. It tastes completely fresh and is the perfect amount of crisp. Their syrup is just the right consistency too - gets the waffles wet, but gives it just the amount of sweetness without the weigh down.\n\nAs for my side, I'm a hard core Mac and Cheese fan. Milky and creamy, but isn't overpowered by the cheese. Also none of that nasty orange thing that comes from the box. Even without the bacon topping, it falls on the better end of my Mac and Cheese experience.\n\nDepending on what you order, and the time of the day, the line can go anywhere from a 5 minute to a 15 minute wait. The food, since they're constantly preparing more, doesn't take nearly as long to be prepared (unless you're order for a family). \nAll in all, I will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Kevin W."}

Why fix something that's not broken?\n\nThe overwhelming sense I get is that they changed their items to be cheaper and more profitable. \n\nChicken and waffle is still good, but everything else changed for the worse. Much much much worse.\n\nThey used to have these awesome wings that were crispy on the outside with a buffalo sauce drizzle, along with some okra. I tried all the new wings - 'blasian', buffalo, and BBQ. They are all more expensive than before, worse tasting, and skimpier. Like getting some wings at Applebees. Even the new mexi-cali looking plates remind me of a sub-par chain diner.\n\nThe Gumbo is just a mess. It's red but devoid of any flavor. Think of pieces of fish, okra, and shrimp floating around in red chili grease. \n\nThey've even changed up their salads and it's just not as good.\n\nWhat happened to the old wings? The turkey chili fries? These were some of the fan favorites and while I'm not against changes, it sucks when they are for the worse. \n\nI guess stay with something safe like chicken and waffle or a burger.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-11", "description": "I LOVE soul food and have hit up more than several spots here in SF. They've all been pretty good with each having its own strength, but I can safely say, this is the best soul food spot I've been to in SF. The restaurant is located down a small ally way and is pretty easy to walk past without noticing. They have a small window on the outside for people who want to order to go, and to the right of that are double doors that lead into the main restaurant. The inside consists of a huge bar with lots of seats surrounded by many tables (large and small). There's also another room with a separate bar as well, but I was here for brunch on a weekday, so it wasn't serving. I showed up 20 minutes before they opened with a group of 10 people and they were super patient with us, considering we kept trying to sneak in early! Once you're in and seated, know that you actually have to order at the front register, where they'll give you a small sign for your table so they can bring you your food.\n\nAs for the food, it was bomb.com. I split an order of the fried chicken w/ mac n cheese and an order of the biscuits and gravy with sausage and eggs. The fried chicken was SOOOOOO good. The skin is nice and crispy and tastes with way fried chicken should!!! I've been to a lot of places that tried TOO hard on the skit and end up serving you salty breaded chicken. This place places just the right amount of crust on the outside. Idk how they do it, but the chicken was nowhere near greasy, and yet, was so so moist. It's a hard call to make because I've had SO much fried chicken in my life and everyone likes their chicken slightly different, but I feel I can easily say this ranks in the top 3 fried chicken spots I've ever had (that includes my momma's own chicken)! They also serve their chicken with a small piece of cornbread that's wtvr, it's nothing special. Their mac n cheese is pretty delicious. Although I've had better, I definitely wouldn't mind having this stuff all the time. It's flavor actually tastes like real cheese and is cooked far from al dente, which is how I like it! If you like more firm pasta, this probably isn't for you. The biscuits and gravy were also pretty delicious! The gravy is tasty with tiny bits of sausage. The biscuit is good, but its quite dry. Of course, the gravy makes up for this, but if it weren't for that, I probably would've choked. Everything in the biscuit is there, they just need to add some butter up in that mix. Regardless, since the gravy, sausage (which is more like a delicious hotlink), and scrambled eggs (which were cooked to perfection, something that is so easy to do yet ALWAYS messed up by restaurants) were nice and juicy, they carried the biscuit to perfection. My friends ALL enjoyed their food, which doesn't happen often when we go out to eat. This includes the pickiest vegetarian I've ever met who ABSOLUTELY DEVOURED the veggie po boy....he keeps talking about how we NEED to go back. Also, the Arnold Palmer was delicious!\n\nIn the end, the AMAZING food was SOMEHOW surpassed by the service. From the friendly bartender, to the cashier who had a 10 minute conversation with us about getting old, to the floor manager Laura (I think that's what her name was) who sang our two birthday girls Happy Birthday and hooked us up with two of the BIGGEST slices of red velvet cake I've ever seen, the service just CANNOT be beat. I don't even like cake, but this cake with cream cheese frosting was freakin AMAZING, I still had a few bites even though I was 100% full. Laura was super friendly and patient, definitely topped off our experience!\n\nMy last comment is something I picked up on several hours after eating here. I'm sure that anyone who fancies themselves a soul foodie knows what I'm talking about when I say that soul food restaurants tend to be hazardous to the digestive system :/ But I felt great after eating here!!! Quality food is served at Little Skillet!!!!", "author": "Adrian D."}

Honestly,  I'm stuck between three and four stars, which was the same feeling I had after trying the American Grilled Cheese Kitchen.  \n\nThis time around, I'm inclined to give a positive bump.  The fried chicken was very crispy, warm, and actually very tasty.  I did not get that greasy feeling.  The meat could have been a little more moist and succulent, but it was very tender.  And $10 for three pieces of chicken and a waffle, that's a pretty good deal.\n\nAs much as I liked the chicken, I have a bone to pick with the waffle.  That was really really bland and soggy, which was truly irritating.  It was so soggy that it couldn't even carry its own weight, it just limped down lifelessly.  I expected more given the strong reviews.  It was so bad that I suspected that they gave me an old batch.  It was as far from crispy as one can get, and that was even before I poured the syrup.  Uber-fail.  Good thing the syrup was really good, otherwise that waffle was unforgivable.  \n\nOverall, this is a generous four star review.

Ordered the works which is the chicken and waffles along with the gumbo.\n\nGumbo was good.  We ordered the cup but I think they ended up bringing us a bowl.  It was filled with fish and shrimp.\n\nWhen the chicken and waffles plate came both our mac and cheese and waffles were cold.  Definitely had been sitting out for a long time, but seriously the mac and cheese was way too cold to eat.  To be honest it was a little unsettling because the cheese had coagulated and the bread crumb toppings were soft.  \n\nMy girlfriend asked for a new one and the kitchen ended up sending out a huge cast iron skillet of new mac and cheese.  We couldn't tell if our bartender was joking or being a dick cause he made a huge deal on how hot the dish was.  (trust me we are not stuck up people, it was actually hilarious cause it was so over the top).\n\nProblem was that the mac and cheese just wasn't that good.  Not gooey, the bread crumbs were not crispy and golden, and needed salt in a bad way.  Smothered in hot sauce it was passable.  But seriously! This is a southern place and they serve watery, bland mac and cheese?? It really is bizarre.  I've had better mac and cheese and those cheap pay per pound lunch spots near Market.\n\nHOWEVER...\nThe shining star was the fried chicken.  Absolutely PERFECT.  Crispy, juicy, hot!  Seriously delicious. We both loved it.  But everything else was blah.\n\nAfter leaving a tip, the bartender looked at it ($2 for 2 beers) and literally got in my face, looking right into my eyes, and said \"Thank you so much, I really appreciate it\"  Again, we couldn't tell if he was joking or being a dick.

I hate going into restaurants near closing time, but it turns out that this isn't a sit-down restaurant.\n\nAround 1:30pm there was no line at the window and the chicken came out in 5 minutes.  The bf decided that he wanted to come here right after I had already eaten lunch, so we shared a 3-piece chicken + waffle ($10).  I think the 2-piece is probably the best deal.  The 3-piece comes with super dry chicken breast that I could've lived without.\n\nThe drumstick was SUPER moist, as was the thigh.

I don't know, I was just expecting more. The best thing for me was the texture of the waffles. Soft and chewy, exactly what I want in waffles. But the taste? It didn't really taste like anything. Not salty, not sweet, only maybe tasted a little malty, like beer batter. The syrup was AWESOME though. Was it cinnamon? It was good.\n\nAnd the chicken. Grr. The batter was, I feel, a little under salted, and not really seasoned enough like anything. The thigh was greasier than I like, and the breast piece was definitely on the wrong side of dry (though not so far as chalky, not at all), although I liked the batter better on this piece!\n\nJalapeno corn muffin was good.

With nearly 400 reviews and a majority of them being positive I was anticipating some fabulous chicken and waffles.  The Little Skillet lived up to the hype with some of the most flavorful and juiciest fried chicken I've ever had.\n\nI lucked out.  The crowds had already beaten me and a huge gathering of folks were already enjoying their food on the loading dock located across the street.  I got in as the fourth person in line, ordered, paid and stood aside in anticipation of my name being called.  Less than ten minutes later my name echoed in the alley.  My food order was ready.  I kept my order simple by just ordering a 3 piece + waffle combination (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SdI0uCelI4ihCwGyMLv03A?select=I4X0Et760WB71FlsJ8_N3A).\n\nIn the time that it took me to walk back to my office (15-20 minutes) my waffle, understandably, had already begun to cool, and it was no longer crispy.  The waffle was still excellent.  The outside was just a tad chewy, but I was most impressed by the inside.  The inside of the waffle had a moist eggy-like texture and seemed more like a pastry than a waffle.  Heavily dusted with confectioners sugar I found little use for the cup of thin, diluted waffle syrup that accompanied the waffle.  The waffle was plenty sweet without the syrup.  Judging by photos previously uploaded by other Yelpers the size of the waffle seems to have increased also.\n\nThe fried chicken was still hot inside the take-out box.  The chicken was lightly battered and deep fried to perfection.  I know all the claims of chicken skin being unhealthy to consume, but there was no way I was discarding mine because the crispy batter and the golden skin locked in incredible flavor.  Each piece was super juicy and none of the fried chicken had any greasy residue adhered to its exterior.  I was most impressed, and I can see myself braving the crowds to come back soon.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

I've eaten here three to four times during the weekends and usually the wait for our food is 15-20 mins. But today is the worst. We waited for our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of corn muffins for 45 mins. Wanna know why? because whoever that cashier was working tonight freaking lost our ticket and he didnt even bother to tell us that he never put the order in. How do I know? I was counting his tickets and his orders the whole time as I was sitting directly across from the counter. The people who came after us after half hour got their food right away. But we were still waitinf the whole time! then whoever was serving/cashier guy tonight passed our table at one point and asked us if we were waitinf for our food even though we had one of their stands indictating that we havent had our food yet! And then when he finally had our one bowl and chili and 6 pieces of cornbread given to us, he didnt even apologize and instead asked us if we wanted a dessert or drink for  time wasted waitinf for our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of cornbread. my boyfriend and I were pretty pissed at that point but we chose not to be confrontational and we said no. Mind you, I had a caltrain to catch so we barely had 10 mins of time left to eat our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of cornbread. Then the server/cashier guy came back and gave us a refund for our food. But the way he said sounded like he was doing us a favor. He said \" I refunded you guys\". OH REALLY? WOW THATS GREAT, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO???? Not even one drop of \"my bad\" or \"sorry for waiting\" or an explanation why we didnt get our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of cornbread earlier while everyone that came after us did!\n\nMy boyfriend and I worked in the food service industry so we dont like to be confrontational or be rude when we dont get our food on time. They only had one server and two cooks in the kitchen. The place was busy already, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt. We understand it sucks to only be the one working, but damn at least give your customers some respect. If you know you messed up and were lucky not to have me go off you a$$, an apology is much appreciated. \n\nMy one bowl of chili was barely cooked, and my 6 pieces of cornbread came out cold.

Big, juicy, sizzling warm pieces and not overly fatty either, but with a nice crispy coat. The waffles could have been warmer and I would have preferred them more fluffy, but they were still good. Definitely not made to order though.\n\nThe 2 piece chicken with waffles is probably enough food for a lot of people, so for $10 I don't think this place is really all that pricy for SF. It also comes with a tiny corn muffin which was pretty good. My gold standard of chicken and waffles is still Dame's in NC though. \n\nThe interior is really doesn't seem Southern so much as just \"old school.\" It never really comes off as authentic but still gives a homely but hip feel to the place. \n\nFINAL VERDICT: Worth checking out.

Turns out my order got lost, but I was totally written off about it when I asked 20 minutes in.\n\nI've been a longtime returning customer, usually I've loved the food. However, today I had a crappy experience.\n\nFirst thing to note is that they were really busy today at lunchtime. I could see that their kitchen was having more trouble than normal keeping up with the orders.\n\n20 minutes after I had paid at the register, still no food. I began to wonder, and approached the guy at the counter. The dude's response was simply \"the chicken takes 15 minutes to make\" in a condescending tone. Never mind that I don't recall ever having waited that long, but I was willing to accept it since they were busier than normal.\n\nAt the 35 minute mark, still no food. I went back up to the counter. At this point they rushed to get me my food with a few minutes of that, because I think everyone understood that no order takes 35 minutes. I asked if my order had gotten dropped. The dude said \"probably\".\n\nI'm not even that mad about the dropped order. I get that that happens. What pisses me off is that at the 20 minute mark they should have tracked down my order to see its status. Instead, I was treated as some unreasonably impatient customer, and then I had to sit around for another 15 minutes before I could get taken seriously. What the heck.\n\nAlso, the best the cashier offered me for my trouble was a free drink. What an insult. I think a free drink for the dropped order might work, albeit kinda weak.

The shells & cheese tasted ok, but I wish it was creamier. As for the jalape\u00f1o corn bread, I wish it had a harder exterior because it was a little soggy.

Usually fried chicken meat used in sandwiches is just ok, but wow, the chicken in here was soooooooo tender & moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. And it was white meat chicken too!

This is some voo-doo waffle magic I have never encountered before.\n\nHighly recommend! Order online ahead of time and drop by to pick it up at your leisure.", "author": "Dennis R."}

I am sure you low sodium people would love it the over easy eggs was not as crisp as I like it but still good runny eggs. The menu said a side if fruit not sure if I got some thing else but I didn't get the fruit. \nThe pork chops was cooked perfectly 5 stars for that but the potatoes could have been cooked alittle longer.

We were lucky to find a table that fit us perfectly in the room with the second bar and restrooms, since it was pretty busy. After taking a look at the menu, we all went up to the register to order and pay. My BF and I split the fried chicken sandwich and the chicken & waffles. My coworkers got sandwiches and the chicken & waffles too. Food arrived at our table pretty quickly and we noticed that the portions were pretty big! I started with the fried chicken sandwich and yummmm was that good! It had a jalapeno slaw in there, which was very refreshing. The chicken was also very moist and I like how they used the Vietnamese sandwich breads for the sandwich. And I think they accidently gave us fries for free instead of the chips that the sandwich was supposed to come with. Awesomes! =) I also tried the chicken and waffles, which was really good too. That skin on the chicken was nicely fried and crispy. And the chicken was just as moist as the chicken in my sandwich. The waffles that came with the fried chicken was made perfectly and complimented well with the chicken. The jalapeno cornbread was so cute and tiny.

Well, I came here twice and decided it's not all that great. One week I had the Chicken and Waffles. The waffles were amazing, Mac and cheese were good and the chicken pieces were small and alright. I got that combo meal that comes with a side, a waffle, and 2 pieces of chicken for I think 13 bucks. Don't know if it's worth 13 bucks BUT also realize it's the city so there's probably some mark up there.\n\nSecond week i came by and there was a Giants Game so the place was packed and busy. Well, I ordered the fried catfish and chips. The pieces of fish were small and I kid you not, my order took 45 minutes...and THAT was a 'To-Go' order. What upset me more was seeing people who ordered way after me get their food first. Mind you, these people 'ate-in' and got their food first. That shouldn't make a difference. The host saw me waiting patiently and I will give her props for apologizing for the delay. Regardless, it took 45 minutes and that one experience ruined it for me.\n\nThey get a 2 stars.

I liked the dimmed lights and some natural lighting.\n-Waffles were lightly coated with powdered sugar, and taste crispy.  \n- Chicken was juicy on the inside and really fried on the outside.

That's where you can order. \n- Dine- in area not clearly labeled. \n- Cornbread that came with my meal was bland. \n- Chicken was really oiling. \n- the maple syrup didn't complement the chicken very well and all it did was drench the waffles.

I came for a Sunday brunch with two friends and although there was a bit of a wait to order food, there was an abundance of seating.\n\n- The Works (2pc chicken + 2 waffles + side) ($14): The fried chicken here is delicious and juicy, with no excess oil. I prefer denser waffles, but the waffles are fluffier than most on the inside. We got the sweet potatoes (comes as a mash) for our side; this was the most mediocre part of the meal and you should probably spring for something more flavorful.\n\n- Country Benedict ($13.50): Eggs benedict is my brunch lover and I wanted to try the pulled pork, so this was a perfect match. The pulled pork is on the saltier side, and the poached eggs were cooked almost entirely on the inside, which was a disappointment because I love my runny poached eggs. This plate was disappointing, albeit not too bad.\n\n- Lemonade ($3/regular, $4/seasonal): The mason jar packaging really sold me here (no, you don't get to keep the jar). The seasonal flavor was watermelon, which I usually do not enjoy much, but I really liked it here. Both the regular and seasonal lemonades are not watered down, so either are quite tasty.\n\nThe cashier was rude and unhelpful, and was confused when I asked him to punch my punch card.

We had ordered the 3 piece fried chicken with the waffle and a side of sausage gravy. One bite and wow, I was blown away by everything we ordered. I was dipping my waffle, my chicken and even my spoon to drink up the sausage gravy. It is one highly addictive gravy and I am thinking about it right now. One time I tried to go to Farmer Brown's located in the Tenderloin district and the wait was too long that I decided not to go. But I am glad they opened up Little Skillet and now I can see why their are lines at F.B.\n\nI have gone back a few more times and every time has been such a great experience with people just relaxing in the area on the loading dock, on crates, or just standing and digging into their boxed lunches. I enjoyed everything about Little Skillet and can't wait to go back a million more times. San Jose needs more places like, places where you don't have to worry about the fuss of waiting for a table, hailing your server down or even taxes. Great place and worth the wait and best fried chicken in SF for now lol! I LOVE YOU LITTLE SKILLET!!!", "author": "Danster L."}

Quite liked that, and the quality made me think of how some great Chinese chefs do up their fried chicken. No dredging...just dusting.\n\nDRESSING\nThe syrup: I'm so curious if they use Dragonfly Sugarworks' Grade A... no viscous syrup here! Thin and buttery (paradox of paradoxes), and very detectable pure maple taste that coats the tongue just right, and allows a sweetness that lingers on the taste buds, but again, not heavy either.\n\nCARB CONTRIBUTION\nAnd then the whopping disappointment and quizzical portion of the meal: I was utterly perplexed that I was purchasing a waffle that did not have that buttery crispy crunch though it definitely had a thickness of a Belgian without the greatness of one...Perhaps they needed to place my homemade-looking double squared waffle in the broiler for one minute because it was looking and feeling flaccid and chewy.Plus, they were quite stingy with the powdered sugar: dusted and sprinkled it was not....more apt to describe as a whisper that i spotted and never tasted.\n\nChewy waffle is not impressive; i've honestly made more satisfying waffles with my own homemade batter and waffle maker. Ho hum....for one who is an aficionado of anything flour-based, the frown did set on after the confusion. \n\ni'd really like to hope the quality was compromised from the super turbo turnaround-time, and the fact that myself and 2 other patrons all received our cutesy boxes in cute bags a bit too quick, and that a second chance peace offering might be had one day.", "author": "Jana C."}

I had, in mind, Hard Knox (which, by the way, their cornbread muffins is a MUST try), but thought about Farmer Brown's, on Mason St., that a friend of mine had previously tried.  I checked Yelp, realized it wasn't open so alternately we went to Little Skillet.  Upon arrival, I was looking for the sitting area, but realized it was more of a \"store-front\" restaurant, with the register at the \"window\" and the kitchen behind them.  The cashier said the restaurant ONLY opens indoor seating on the weekends.  No worries...seeing as it was a great day and my tourist friends had never experienced casually eating food on the \"streets\" (the location is on a small, clean alley).\n\nA hipster type of place, my first-time at Little Skillet.  Definitely had a variety wide enough for even a vegetarian to enjoy.  Prices, were not inexpensive, but definitely reasonable.  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, and highly recommend others to order this!  The skin is crispy and the meat was nice and moist; the Belgian waffles were also moist, and adding honey makes it even better.  My Singaporean tourist crew enjoyed their meal.  Hit the spot.

This place is passable, but not great. \n\nI ordered the 2-piece chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits. The chicken was crispy and not dry, but the coating crumbled easily and had none of the hearty crunch you would expect from great fried chicken. The waffles and syrup were a nice complement, but I've had plenty of more delicious Eggo waffles before (but maybe childhood hindsight is always rosier...). The worst was the shrimp and grits. The shrimp weren't totally de-veined and the grits were watered down.

I'm not sure if the setup changes based on the hours of business but by the night, you'll definitely see people ordering tons of drinks at the bar as well as order food, which is always a great combination.\n\nBeing a lover of soul food, I had to try this place out.

The waffles were so light and fluffy and with that powdered sugar on top along with syrup, it's pure bliss on the lips. \n\nThis place is about 4 1/2 stars, close to 5.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-09", "description": "I convinced a couple friends to come check this place out for brunch after coming here literally the day before and watching another friend order food to go; any time I see biscuits and gravy on the menu, then IT IS ON.\n\nThe space is somewhat dimly lit, as there are windows but the restaurant itself is sandwiched in between buildings so there isn't much sunlight to be seen. People line up to order and then they bring the food to your table; they also bus your table, so in retrospect, I feel bad for not leaving any tip.\n\nThe cuisine is unfortunately what my friend called \"California Southern food\", as you feel perfectly comfortable walking out of the restaurant after eating there...which is NOT what I'm looking for when I want Southern food. I managed to run up a tab of $36 without a dessert, which isn't that hard when the sides are $5 a pop. Portion size is decent, but to use the term generous would be...overly generous.\n\nFried chicken: my friend had said that sometimes it comes out somewhat dry, which was not the case this time as it was perfectly FRIED fried chicken that held onto its juiciness in spite of being white meat. The crust is the right consistency as well. The problem is that it's lacking in the seasoning department, as we wistfully pined for that delectable blend of spices that defines the Colonel's original recipe. This does not supplant my favorite fried chicken place in the city at Hard Knox Cafe.\n\nBiscuits and gravy: this is where California Southern cooking comes into play. The gravy is not particularly rich or sausage-y in flavor, as I like my gravy to carry the sage that typifies breakfast sausage (like Orphan Andy's in the Castro). While the fried chicken was not lacking in moisture, the biscuits definitely were. It may sound gross, but they probably should've used at least twice as much butter/animal fat in this dish in order to do it justice.\n\nMac & cheese: very good. Interestingly, there are bits of carrots and potentially other veggies in this mac, which did not lack for creamy cheesy goodness. The darker appearance of the cheesy sauce leaves me wondering whether or not they use beef stock as their secret ingredient to give this dish more depth than I would've expected.\n\nCollard greens: a little heavier on the vinegar than I would like. Maybe it's supposed to be a little sour as I have never ate collard greens down south, but most other places I've been haven't been quite as heavy handed with the vinegar. Not particularly rich in flavor, they probably could've used more ham hock to give it a more weight.\n\nCole slaw: a red cabbage slaw that had at least some flavoring (as opposed to the one I reviewed at Gorilla BBQ)...but not much more. Not salty, or sweet, or sour...just slightly creamier than your plain chopped cabbage.\n\nThis place does pretty good business as there was a steady line of people waiting to order without running out of table space; the 2-3 guys manning the register, delivering food, and clearing tables would be hard-pressed to keep up if this place got any busier. I like that this place is within walking distance from my house so that I could potentially walk off the reduced calorie brunch fare next time (as I took my friend's offer for a ride back home), and I'd like to try their waffles just to cross that off the list, but I understand why this place isn't all over SF's must-brunch lists and would probably tell my friends to move on if they're looking to be incapacitated with deliciousness on the weekends.", "author": "Gene C."}

I requested breast pieces and he happily obliged with no extra charge. The food was made to order, which I could see. After a few good minutes of patiently waiting, it was ready! The fried chicken breast was so moist, tender and juicy inside, which I didn't expect in a breast piece. The skin was fried to a crisp which I enjoyed immensely. It was really flavorful, but not too salty. And there were two waffles, lightly dusted in powdered sugar. They were so warm and soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Add a drizzle of syrup to this pairing and you got yourself a winner!", "author": "Cindy T."}

Perhaps would be better for brunch than dinner, since it appears to double as a cool, hip bar for the young and moneyed, with a volume level akin to a frat party.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the simplicity of ordering your food at a counter and not having to deal with a waitstaff.  So why the candy store bit?  Well, I'll you why.  Due to hard wired starving hunter-gatherer tendencies, I love me some fat.  Yet having been born and raised in eating disordered California, I've been taught to fear fat.  It's always there in the back of my mind.  Don't order the fried food because you'll feel like crap afterwards.  Easy on the oil, please.  Um, I asked for this sandwich with no mayonnaise.  There is way too much butter in this.  For anyone so tortured by such thoughts, LS is like going to AA, except, instead of trying to quit your vices, you're obliged to indulge in them.  There is nothing on the menu that lets you escape temptation, and everything on the menu is the stuff my dreams are made of.  So, yes, I ordered the chicken and waffles, I ordered the shrimp and grits, I ordered the po' boy, I ordered the jambalaya and it was awesome.", "author": "Ash T."}

Fried chicken in super moist and flavorful. Biscuits are flakey and perfectly portioned. The scramble is never over cooked and the bacon is thicker than you would expect at a buffet. Homestyle potatoes are yummy too made with peppers and onions.\n\nDrinks come In mason jars BEWARE bloody Mary is super spicy and I think I tasted a hint of olive juice.\nAmbiance here is great young and lively down side is that you might get mugged buy a crack dealer on your walk to brunch.\n\nPro tip: make sure you have a reservation because the wait can get pretty long and this is NOT the neighborhood to be loitering in!!!!!", "author": "Daniela N."}

My friend and I drove all the way up to the City just to eat at Little Skillet today.  Little Skillet is a cute little whole in the wall (literally). My 2piece combo came with a wing & thigh.  My friend's had a drumstick and breast.  I thought the waffle was really good; crisp on the outside and yet super light and airy inside.  I don't remember having a waffle that light before.  The fried chicken was good, but there was nothing extra special about it.  My friend's sister works nearby and walked over to join us.  She also had a 2 piece combo.  She lathered her chicken with hot sauce.  The lady working the window was friendly, our food was ready really fast, and we just sat on the edge of the loading dock across the street.  It was definitely a good snack for me, but I wasn't full by any means.

I got the 2 piece with waffles, and opted to upgrade both pieces to white (and get breasts) for an extra dollar.

Both could have stood for a bit more seasoning/flavor, but over all were not displeasing on the pallet.\n\nCame with a side of syrup, but NO gravy. Whenever I have chicken and waffles, I'm sorry, but I need syrup and Gravy to complete the experience.\n\nI'm not exactly eating this food for my health, so if I'm going to get it, I might as well get the whole package.\n\nI would come back here, and would likely recommend this place in absence of other confirmed better options.", "author": "Christopher G."}

Seasoned and crispy but the meat wasn't too moist. It tasted overcooked a bit which was disappointing because I'd thought that's what they were known for, their chicken and waffles. The waffles were good but it tastes the same everywhere else. You can't really mess up waffles, can you? Okay, onto the next item. The fried catfish po' boy really was too dry! Not only was it dry but it was pretty bland. I had to drench it in tabasco sauce for me to eat it. It wasn't terrible. Neither was the chicken. But it just seem like it was missing something. Something that Roscoe's has that farmerbrown's was lacking. I even thought Popeye's fried chicken was better. \n\nNot to mention that we came on a rainy day to come try and not only were there no tables and chairs to sit, we have to pour our own hot sauce and get our own utensils. Do you know how hard that can be when the wind is going strong at 20mph? We had a few flying napkin and sauce lid casualties. \n\nOverall, I don't think I would be coming back.

But when it involves fried chicken and red velvet cupcakes, it's a sure-fire way to get me to. \n\nA group of us headed over here for lunch today. Since it's a good five long blocks away from our office, it's walkable, but not every day walkable. This is a good thing though, because if it was only one or two blocks away, I'd be on a fast train to heart failure. \n\nEVERYTHING on the menu made my mouth water. Fried chicken and waffles, BBQ pulled pork, grits and even a waffledog. I was debating between getting a two piece chicken meal or the fried chicken po' boy, and the po' boy won. The sandwich was filled with deliciously fresh coleslaw, and it came with housemade chips. And it was BIG. I devoured the entire thing, and was pretty proud of it too.\n\nWhile little skillet is just a take out counter, the only area to sit and eat is on the loading dock of the building across the street. Little skillet provides seat cushions though, so grab one for some nice padding. \n\nLike that they also provide both Tapatio and Crystal hot sauce packets and compostable cutlery. \n\nSince I haven't actually eaten their fried chicken pieces, I can only give them 4 stars for now. Bakesale Betty's fried chicken sandwich is still superior. However, the red velvet cupcake is 5 stars. The cream cheese frosting is to die for, and it's big enough to be shared with 6 people.

He also talked back at customers for no apparent reason except for the fact that they were asking for drinks.  I would assume that was his job, but I could be wrong.

We definitely ordered too much food, but I did get to try everything and overall I felt it was just A-OK. Below is the breakdown:\n\n- Fried Chicken: Overall, the chicken was pretty tasty and the skin was nice and crispy. The only thing is that I didn't feel there was anything special about it. Nothing that really makes it stand out or makes me want to go back.\n- Mac and Cheese: The mac and cheese was good and they add cayenne pepper or something, which gives it a kick.\n- Potato Salad: I couldn't quite tell what it was about the potato salad, but something about it threw me off. My coworker said that there was dijon mustard so maybe it was the strong mustard taste that I didn't like?\n- Waffles: I was really disappointed in the waffles. I'm not sure what happened since I read on Yelp that their waffles were nice and fluffy. My coworker tried to cut it with his plastic knife but couldn't so he ended up just biting into it. It felt overcooked and dry and I had to dip it in lots of maple syrup to get it down. I didn't end up finishing mine.\n- Corn Bread: This was a nice surprise since I didn't know the meal came with corn bread (had we known, we probably wouldn't have ordered an extra side =P). It was a bit dry for me (although I know corn bread is supposed to be dry) and I wasn't a big fan. Only had one bite.\n- Brown Sugar Pepper Dessert: The first bite was really yummy and tasted like crumb cake, but then once the pepper hit, it was a bit too much for me =(.\n\nOverall, the chicken and mac and cheese were OK but I didn't enjoy anything else. Not sure that I would come back on my own but I may give it another shot if someone wanted to try it.", "author": "Jennifer T."}

Think spongy cardboard and you get the texture about right. But still four-stars because the fried chicken is that good.

They said it will take 15 minutes - Perfect. We got there and there were people hanging outside and just a little line.

Sat across from the place where there was a loading dock, but it was it just looked too difficult to eat chicken and waffles there, so decided to just take it home to eat. \n\nOH, the sweet tea was REALLY sweet..I LOVE IT! If you are not really into sweetness, this may not be your drink choice. Seriously, HELLA SWEET! \n\nIt took about 30 minutes to get back and you know what the chicken was still crispy and yummy! I usually don't eat the fried chicken skin, but I did this time. It was very good.

The soft and fluffy waffle was only slightly crispy on the outside. Nevertheless it was delicious.

She took a great offense, and said, well we make fresh to order, and kept repeating it. I'm like then why isn't it crispy and hot? and fries were also soggy, but I couldn't return them because I was starving and I had to eat something :/ The strawberry lemonade was too sour, and let me tell you, \"Sizzlers\" has 100 times better strawberry lemonade.

What a waste of time, and money!\n\nI NEVER run in this problem at \"The front Porch\" Their fried chicken is the best one I've ever had. We have been there so many times, and It is consistently good...hmmmm.yummmmmm when I think about it. The price is the same. Little skillet's fried chicken was so horrible, and worse than the KFC.

Their seating is limited cushion on concrete without a table outdoors. They have good service and knowledgeable staff.  Their service, ingredients and niche save them from a three star review.  Lunch here will set you back .  I really want to love Little Skillet, but there's always something with the dish that holds me back.\n\nI miss the Dr. Pepper in glass bottles, but I know it is not their fault.\n\nThe details:\n\nThey've always been accommodating of inquiries and requests and in general have real good customer service.  My gluten free questions and so forth today were taken care of with the usual flair.\n\nI was reminded today, people who aren't local and haven't walked by don't have any way to know there are not any indoor (or outdoor) tables and chairs.  What there is are cushions you can plop down on the raised walkway across the street (which gets filled during lunch rush).  There are various parks and benches you could also relocate to for lunch on the go.  I usually take it back to the office.\n\nI still haven't had the chicken and the waffles together (nor am I supposed to, since they are not gluten free).  That said, when I could eat it, the fried chicken was good (maybe could be juicier?).  I don't like chicken and I like their chicken, so that's good enough for me.  Their waffles, I liked their ingredients and toppings, more than I liked the waffle itself.  They're only a nudge above ok.\n\nI remembered them as making a good salad, but something has changed, because this was ok and below par for the area.   I got a cobb salad with blackened chicken (I think first time for me here), no bacon.  \n\nThere's tons of romaine and a nice packet of dressing.  The quality and flavor of the ingredients is a taste-able difference.  It goes downhill from there.\n\nThe initial taste of the blackened chicken is flavorful enough for a moment, then it is quickly replaced with the heat and eventual sour aftertaste of just pepper and nothing but the pepper.  This is spicy hot, so adjust your order as needed.  I will say even though it was grilled, it was nice and soft.\n\n 2-3 slices of avocado (really good tasting one), but other salads have just as much or more for the same price or less.\n\n  I accidentally got a taste of some rock hard burnt bacon, make that two.  I should take away a star for that and requested a do-over, but I'm feeling generous.  Beware overcooked bacon, if you order something with bacon!\n\nI probably put like 20 small tomatoes in my home made salads and in this whole huge salad there was five or less chopped up.  This annoys me more than the bacon bad, even though that's a worse offense.\n\nStingy with the blue cheese, too.\n\nYour salad needs some tossing, before you eat it.\n\nOh yea, and I knew the cornbread wasn't gluten free, but it was overcooked mini muffin and too hard except one pinch worth of the very middle.\n\nI actually remember most of the food I've eaten here, which indicates they are doing something right.  Whether it was biscuits and gravy (I didn't entirely like their biscuit seasoning, but what I don't like, others might vote up), fruity morning waffle, waffle dog, or custom po boy with fries, melted cheese and remoulade, there were things to praise.  Actually, I don't remember having any criticisms of the waffle dog.\n\nNew Orleans has spoiled me, and there's nothing here that isn't better or cheaper there.  However, this is San Francisco.  This place is better than ok and LFC, even though it costs more, so four stars it is.", "author": "Denae W."}

All I asked of the manager was to have someone clean the table and sweep the floor around the table.  First attempt, table half cleaned and previous customers dirty dishes still on the table.  I asked that it be cleaned again.  Then, I asked if someone could do a quick cleanup of the floor.  The manager, Logan told us the restaurant was busy, they did not clean until closing and we needed to move to another open table. Excuse me?  Is it just me or is that BAD BUSINESS?  Most restaurants sweep the floor when old food, dirty napkins and trash are on the floor.  I really don't think its much to ask.  It was not half as busy on Sunday as it was Saturday and I saw about four tables that were dirty and needed cleaning.  This used to be my go to breakfast spot, but not anymore.

The waffle was ok, nothing special, and it comes with maple syrup only, no gravy no butter. But for $7/9/11 (1/2/3 piece chicken + waffle), it is quite a good deal, it fills you up and for the most importantly it was good, one of the better chicken-n-waffles in SF. I do suggest to eat it right when you get it because one time I made the mistake of taking it to go and 30mins later, the waffle was a bit soggy. \n\nIf you plan to drive there either go during a non-game day, the street parking gets pretty full.

I know it's cliche but it was finger licking good and I know in some way it will ruin fried chicken for me anywhere else.\n\nThe biscuits and gravy really didn't do it for me but I partially think it was because nothing could compare to the beauty of the FBLS chicken. I also enjoyed the Sweet Tea which was a refreshing accompaniment to my lovely chicken. If you're not into sugar then you probably won't like the Sweet Tea because it's a gallon of water, tea and two gallons of sugar. My friends all ordered the pecan tarts and red velvet cupcakes but I just didn't have any room left in my tummy for dessert. I know its one of those choices I'll look back on with regret!

Now that I've moved to San Francisco, I've all but abandoned my previous ways of eating in favor of opening my culinary horizons in a city that thrives on fantastic food from any-and-all sources imaginable.\n\nThough I'm not eating beef quite yet, and foie gras will always be off limits... I've been hooked on fried chicken and waffles. That savory VS sweet combo that always received such critical acclaim at Roscoe's in Los Angeles while I was growing up in So Cal just stalked me like a thief in the night. Though I've still yet to try Roscoe's, there are some great spots in the city for the seemingly unusual tag-team combo, and you bet your ass that I'm eventually going to try 'em all.\n\nFarmerbrown's Little Skillet is about a 10 minute walk from my office here in SOMA, so it's the perfect distance when craving something as bad for you as fried chicken. If this place were just down the block, I'd probably balloon to 300lbs in no time. At least the 20 minute round trip burns off a few calories before ingesting hot, greasy fry oil. Well, that's what I tell myself, at least....\n\nOf the three or so places I've tried in the city, these guys have the best fried chicken I've tasted. In fact, it just might be the best fried chicken I've ever had (keeping in mind I'm not so well versed in this meat eating thing). The chicken they use is of the organic, free-range Petaluma variety http://www.petalumapoultry.com/index.php, so the guilt level is at a minimum and you can be sure you're eating the highest quality fried white meat available anywhere in California. Let's see KFC try to pull that off, eh?\n\nIn addition to chicken and waffles, they have a whole host of other comfort food goodies to choose from as well. Salads, po'boy sandwiches, grits, pastries, and more. Best of all, it's fast and totally affordable. \n\nDon't be thrown off by the back alley thing on Ritch. It's not nearly as seedy as others would make it out to be. Plus, it's only open until 3:00pm daily, so what kind of criminal activity can possibly go down before Oprah hits the airwaves on CBS??\n\nOh - cash only!

Luckily, we found a (metered) parking spot right on Ritch St. :) Farmerbrown's Little Skillet is literally a hole in the wall in some alley in SF, but don't let the surroundings fool you! Little Skillet has some of the best chicken in town!\n\nThe line wasn't long (about 3-5 people.) The kitchen looked clean, big, and smelled absolutely amazing! I love the little laid back touches they added to the small wall and the water/iced tea station they have on the opposite side. I ordered the 2 piece chicken and waffles with a lemonade while my boyfriend got the cheddar andouille grits with the 1 piece chicken and waffles. The wait was less than 10 minutes which was nice and they also provide mats so you can sit on the loading dock across the street. Take it to go, or better yet, go to China Basin Park and enjoy your meal there!\n\nThe chicken was SO good. It wasn't oily, crispy on the outside, and the meat was so juicy and tender. The waffles were a bit cold, but the syrup complemented the waffles perfectly! The waffles were nice and crispy, but fluffy on the inside. I didn't really care for the grapefruit lemonade since it was pre-made and needed ice, but I heard their iced tea was good.

I don't know if it was that particular weekend, but there were also some vendors for lack of a better word selling other food right outside on the street. \n\nMuch like some other reviews, this place is hit and miss (this visit was definitely a miss). I feel as if the food would have tasted a whole degree better had it just been HOT or even reallllly warm? Our food was barely luke warm which kind of killed it for me personally. The waffle was cold and soggy, chicken was as if it might have been fried and sitting on a counter for some time... and grits were just... grits. Also, the biscuits were nothing special especially with the cold sausage gravy on top of it.  If you are wondering how long we let it sit, let's just say we grabbed it as soon as it was at the window and popped it open to eat it within a minute.

It was tasteless and very chewy or stale texture. The first time I had the waffle it was soft, moist, and fluffy on the inside and just a little crispy on the outside. It was warm too. This one was none of those things and it was in room temp and as if it was made earlier in the day and had been sitting under the heat lamp all day. Not appetizing AT ALL. It was so bad, I couldn't take another bite. After 4 bites, I had to just throw it away. \n\nThe apple filling also wasn't any good. It was blend testing and the apples weren't cooked long enough. \n\nOverall, a total let down and a waste of my $6. I seem to remember the waffle was around $3 or $3.50 and it was only 1 square.

Well they didn't break the mold here but they executed the expletive out of it. Oh my gosh this was probably some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. Tip: see if you can get only dark meat as the normal 2 piece is a drumstick and a breast. Personally I hate cutting into the breast piece and find drumsticks juicier and easier to eat. Back to the review the chicken was well seasoned the skin was crispy and full of flavor but wasn't greasy which is a serious feat.  The waffle was crispy and not soggy and there was just enough syrup to mesh the two elements together. I wasn't overly impressed by the eggs over easy or the small cornbread muffins that were garnishments. The space is a cool industrial feel with jazz and bands playing on the speakers. To be honest I felt like i was back home in nola listening to live music like Rebirth brass band or Tank and the Bangas while eating breakfast. Needless to say it's a really cool vibe. It is also kinda chilly inside as the front doors stay open so keep your coat on.  It's also inside an alley off the alley. Keep walking past the door with the street address and you'll see a sign.", "author": "Michele J."}

It was literally the best chicken and the best waffles I'd ever eaten; 5 star. Unfortunately it's never been quite as good as that first time. I live across the street so I keep coming back every so often, still chasing that dragon. The chicken and waffles are still generally pretty good, but every now and then the chicken is too salty and/or slightly burnt. The other item I get on the menu here is the pulled pork sandwich. While it's not anywhere near the best pulled pork sandwich, it's at least very consistent. Overall I would say this place is probably 3-3.5 stars.", "author": "Mark G."}

Instantly I thought to myself \"Self, get yee to Little Skillet, stat!\" So I went home, gathered up the mutt and made a beeline to Ritch Street.\n\nI saw the masses sitting on loading docks, hunched over their take out boxes without saying a word to their dining companions. This is always a good sign. The menu was chock full of Southern specialities but I decided early on that I'd be going with the chicken and waffles. I placed my order, waiting maybe five minutes before being presented with a box of goodness. The verdict? Total chicken-gasm.\n\nThe chicken was crispy and juicy and oh so flavorful. I ordered the three piece with every intention of saving a piece for later but knew with my first bite that that wasn't going to happen. The waffle was pretty standard but paired well with the chicken; I especially liked taking a bite of chicken and waffle together with some syrup. Mmmm, syrup.\n\nNext time I'll probably go with a different side in place of the waffle...the biscuits looked great, as did the fries. I can definitely see myself grabbing a box to take to a Giants game (although the fact that they close at 3:30pm means not to a night game) Bring cash and an appetite - you'll need both!", "author": "phil h."}

I've probably eaten more chicken than... well, someone else who also eats a lot of chicken but not quite as much as me.  And I've also had waffles.  Great waffles.  Waffles you'd write stories about, how they're made by unicorns in some fantasy rainbow city and sprinkled with little wisps of cloud dust.  But I've never had them together is my point. And the whole concept was very intriguing to me.\n\nSo today, mere moments ago, I ventured out into this personally unexplored culinary realm seeking excitement and previously undiscovered bliss. My journey fell short of those expectations, though it was not a complete disappointment by any means.\n\nQuite literally a hole-in-the-wall establishment, the Little Skillet offers no seating, save for the raised loading dock of the business across the street (lucky them). Many reviews have said that they accept cash only, though I paid today with my credit card with no issue at all. The service was prompt and friendly and the young lady at the register did a great job of balancing customers ordering and picking up food.\n\nThe Little Skillet did indeed deliver what it promised: chicken and waffles.  It was simply displayed on the menu as such and, wouldn't you know, that's what ended up in my same-as-every-other-restaurant-in-SoMa to go container. The fried chicken was brown and crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, just a hair this side of perfect.  The waffles were... well, relatively unexciting.  They weren't particularly sweet and they were decidedly colder than the chicken.  The tops were crunchy and the bottoms were soft.  The syrup was perhaps the least satisfying of the whole package; It seemed to be more tart than sweet.  \n\nAs I mentioned before, I'm new to this, so consider the source here.  And maybe I have this wrong.  But in my perception of this culinary combination, I assumed that the enticement here was the contrast of flavors, the savory and the sweet.  For me, that didn't really happen.  Let me be clear, I was not displeased with the meal as a whole.  The food was good.  The chicken was REALLY good, and I'm not a huge fan of straight-up fried chicken per se.  But after all I've heard, with the hype of the chicken & waffle experience, this sadly did not live up to it.\n\nSo maybe next time I try the shrimp poboy or the burger or the cobb salad, which were my other inklings today that inevitably lost out to the thoughts of chicken and waffle bliss.  And maybe I'll be blown away and maybe I won't.  But I think the point is, there will be a next time.", "author": "Lance H."}

The fried chicken was DELICIOUS! The skin was so crispy and piping hot, but the breading wasn't too thick. The chicken actually had taste and you could tell that it had been at least marinated in salt. I've eaten Tyler Florence's fried chicken at Wayfare Tavern for $22 and it was a total letdown (I'm sorry, Tyler. Your chicken doesn't hold a candle to Little Skillet's chicken). I'm not a huge waffle fan and those didn't impress me terribly. I actually thought they could have been cooked a little bit longer and been a little more crispy. I did find it interesting that the waffles actually weren't too sweet, which I liked. Chicken is 5 stars.

I decided to get 2 fried chicken with waffles ($8.50) and a side of coleslaw ($3.00). Little Skillet also gives things for free on certain weekdays (till supplies last), the day I went it was a mini red velvet cupcake. \n\nI was a little irritated that my co-worker got his food before me and he ordered the same thing (aside from the coleslaw, I am not sure why mine took an extra 10 mins than his!).\n\nMy co-worker and I decided to go back to our office kitchen area to eat since there is basically no seating area within that vicinity (people sat on the sidewalk or warehouse stairways). Our office isn't that far from Little Skillet, even less than a 5 min walk. By the time we sat down, the waffles were extra soggy, I love crispy waffles and this one wasn't made to my liking. The chicken was over cooked, it wasn't brown and crispy, it was just dark brown, but I do give them credit for it NOT being dry inside. It was juicy and somewhat tasty. The coleslaw was the worse I have ever had. It tasted like they put a lot of dijon mustard and a whole bunch of mustard seeds. It was just not appetizing. \n\nI would actually prefer Popeyes over Little Skillet after this experience.", "author": "Erica T."}

I never had grits before, it was very similar to polenta, which I also love.

Also tried their special waffle of the day, waffles topped with whipped cream, blue berries and tiny marshmellows. I wasn't wowed as the waffle didn't taste all that fresh.

This is some of the best chicken I have had especially outside of the south. The friend chicken skin was crunchy and had very little grease and the chicken was just moist enough. The waffle comes with a little powdered sugar and syrup and it is great for cleaning up after eating chicken.\n\nI have to confess, I also ordered a little pecan pie, and it was better than any pecan pie I have ever had.

They have free self-serve ice water, so you don't necessarily need to pay extra for a drink (or wait for someone to refill your water). It sounds like this place gets super busy at lunchtime, but yesterday we only had to wait a few minutes to order and another few minutes to get our food. Maybe it's because it's Thanksgiving week and there aren't as many people at work.\n\nAnyway, I went with the Pulled Pork Po' Boy and thought it was just okay. The flavor of the pork was nothing above standard, but the worst part was that the meat was on the dry side. To combat this, you would think that they would have a good helping of cole slaw to help give it some moisture...but no, they give you barely any when compared with the heaping mass of dry pork. But on the bright side, the cole slaw was not as mayo-heavy as other slaw I've had.\n\nI found the chips too salty, though I was impressed with the texture, which was crispy in some places and a little softer in others; you can definitely tell that they're fresh-baked, which I liked. The pickle they give you is really tasty; it's like a mix of sweet and dill. The only thing about the pickle is that it's so small compared to the size of the sandwich and the portion of chips.\n\nToo many things went wrong for me to give this place 4 stars. However, the fried chicken looked great, so I'm gonna give it a try next time I'm there.

Today, I went there around 11, and there was no line. I shared a 2piece chicken and waffle and a shrimp poboy with the bf. Since today is a Monday, they give out free lemonade or ice tea (but we only got it after asking the girl for it). We got the lemonade (so good!).\n\nWaffles-The waffles today were cold...not freshly made like the previous times I've been there. The waffles are usually warm and fluffy and goes perfectly with the syrup, but not today. Based on today's experience I would probably give it a 3 star (just b/c of the waffle), but overall I think it still deserves a 4-5 star. \n\nChicken- So good!! Probably the best fried chicken I've had. Goes really well with the hot sauce and waffles. The right amount of flavoring and also very crispy, warm, and tender. The only thing that is puzzling to me is the portion. Last time I ordered a 2 piece chicken and waffle I actually got 2 prices of wings and one huge piece of breast. This time I ordered the same thing but I only got breast and a small drum stick. Not too sure about how consistent the portions are...but the quality is good regardless of the portion.\n\nShrimp poboy- Surprisingly yummy. I wasn't expecting much since I usually come here for chicken and waffles, but it is good! The portion is generous and the shrimp is very juicy, plump, and well flavored. The amount of shrimp is proportioned well with the baguette. The poboy also comes with seasoned chips (tasty, but a little on the salty side). This is $12.\n\nLemonade- really good lemonade, does not taste artificial like the ones you make with powder. It has lemon pulp in it(or taste like it) and has other fruity taste to it ( can't quite figure out what it was... Pear?strawberry? O well... It's delicious). Usually cost $3 but probably worth it. \n\nI've tried many chicken and waffle places but this is yet my favorite chicken and waffle spot!\n\nNote: Monday you get free lemonade or ice tea, Tuesday you get a free mini cupcake, and Wednesday you get free chips with purchase.", "author": "Whitney W."}

The fries, YIKES, we can't believe one of us didn't crack a tooth. \n\nWhat really annoyed us, not once but twice, their menu advertises, prices INCLUDE tax, well guess what they charged us tax. Are they paying the government double tax? See for yourself both the menu and the receipt are attached. \n\nOne more reason why we won't patronize again...we printed our menu from their website on 4/22/11 - now that I posted my review the menu has conveniently changed and rudely at that!!!!

CHICKEN AND WAFFLES!!\n\nPros\n- CHICKEN AND WAFFLES\n\nCons\n- itty bitty waffle the size of maybe 1/3 of a regular waffle\n- $1 extra for gravy and not enough gravy in my opinion\n- small-ish portions for not that cheap-ish price\n- LONG long line\n- currently only open for lunch\n- no seating besides a few crates in the alley, so no luck if its bad weather\n\n\nWe got there around 12:15, and it was nearly a half our wait in line. The wait for the food was less than 10 minutes, which was good. I asked for two thighs, got a thigh and a leg. The waffle comes with powdered sugar and a bit of syrup. I wouldn't nearly have been full after the tiny waffle and two small chicken pieces. Good thing I got some cheddar and andouille sausage grits, yum! \n\nDespite all the cons, I will probably be back. Pretty good lunch spot! I think the food is good; really its just the wait and the price to amount of food ratio that teeters it between 3 and 4 stars. \n\nExample meal:\n7.00 itty bitty waffle + 2 piece chicken\n1.00 for a side of gravy, maybe x 2 cause it's not enough for me\n3.00 side of mac salad or 4.00 grits on their daily special menu\n2.00 drink\n---------------------------------------------------------\n~13.00 meal before tax\n\nSad to say, not sure the chicken and waffles are worth it.

It's in an alley and you can't miss it thanks to the many people sitting out front chowin down on fried chicken. They are to-go only and serve mainly fried chicken and waffles, with all the sides you would expect to accompany that combo. I had 2 piece fried chicken, potato salad, mac-n-cheese, and corn bread. Chicken & potato salad were amazing. Mac-n-cheese was good but spicy, which was a surprise. Corn bread was a bummer bec it was spicy too and I just wanted sweet cornbread.

Waiting for the bus to get over to SOMA was torture so I made a mental note to take the Muni underground next time. It was hilarious how we were practically on a foot race to beat the other customers to the growing line.\n\nLucky for us, the line wasn't as bad as we had imagined since it made its way up to the window quite rapidly. It took maybe about 10-15 min and it was our turn! I decided on the 2 piece chicken lunch box ($6.50) which came with an angel biscuit and a side of my choice. One con involved their cash only policy because they couldn't give me exact change. At least it was only a nickel but have the correct amount or carry small bills just in case!\n\nI thought the little condiment stand and barrel trash can were really cute (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SdI0uCelI4ihCwGyMLv03A?select=LuxyHicZ9hbZNHRKq0d_3Q) since they added to the whole country feel. Several minutes after I ordered and took this picture, I heard them call my name already. Props for their incredibly fast service! I'm assuming their chicken was made in large batches to accommodate the lunch rush.\n\nI can't say I wasn't a tad disappointed when I opened my lunch box though. It's funny how they call it a lunch box since I felt like I was in elementary school eating lunch in the schoolyard. haha The only seating was on this concrete platform thing across the street. Anyways, they gave me a thigh and a wing, a dinky little biscuit, and my fruit salad. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SdI0uCelI4ihCwGyMLv03A?select=lVl4xnLpsNVikHag2l9VUA) Fortunately, everything filled me up just right and tasted amazing! \n\nThe chicken was moist, hot, and fried to perfection. It was so yummy that I ate everything down to the bone and licked my fingers! The biscuit was just OK, nothing Pillsbury couldn't make. Last but not least, their colorful fruit salad was fresh, seasonal, and sweet...couldn't have asked for a better way to end my meal.

He called me soon after and told me that it was \"off the hook\" and that he would be trying it again on Monday, today!\n\nI have never had chicken and waffles but the concept has always intrigued me. We don't have Roscoe's here and I'm hardly ever in Oakland to try that place so I have no basis.\n\nAfter reading the reviews here I wanted to try the angel biscuit and chicken. My brother swayed me and said the chicken and waffle combo is where it's at. So I went with what he said.\n\nOur order: 2 orders of 3piece white chicken w waffle and side of sausage gravy, 1 shrimp o'boy sandwich, and 2 pecan tartlets. \n\nI like that you can choose if you want white or dark meat. And I'm really glad I got the white meat, even though most times I like dark. The chicken meat as everyone has said was moist and seasoned to perfection. And yes even though we asked for the 3 piece, we both got 4 pieces in our boxes. The waffle was a nice accompaniment to the chicken. The gravy is so very tasty and yummy and I dipped both the chicken and the waflle in it. Lol.\n\nMy SIL ordered the po'boy and I got a little taste. The shrimp was seasoned so nicely with a little touch of heat. It comes with some house made chips were also very good. And served on a ciabatta roll which held the sandwich together very well b/c they heap the shrimp on.\n\nThe pecan tartlet is yummy and a nice finish to lunch.\n\nDefinitely call your order in especially if you're planning to go during the lunch rush.

There are two negative things that have consistently stood out to me:\n\n  1. Messed up orders. I've done group orders (~ 3 or 4 people) where an entire order was left out. I've done single orders where a 3-piece only contains 2 pieces. This has happened on multiple occasions. Open your box, and check that you got what you ordered.\n\n  2. Inconsistent seasoning and frying. Sometimes it's salty as hell, other times it's just the right amount. Sometimes the chicken is overcooked (dry and dark brown) and other times it's fine. It seems to be a roll of the dice.\n\nThere are obviously things I do like about this place which is why I end up convincing myself to go once in a while. It used to take forever to get your order. It seems the wait is much shorter these days. You can choose dark vs. white meat, even specifying specific parts if you want (eg. thighs only).

Farmberbrown's was \"closest\" to me, and after checking out the other reviews and menu I ventured over.\n\nMy husband was in class so I was by myself, and I did not want to go to a restaurant and sit and eat by myself (I always feel weird doing that).  Farmerbrown is take out only.  They have some cushions you can grab and pop a squat on the curb, or the loading dock across the street, but take home was more my style. \n\nThey open early (9:30) on weekends, and I was able to walk right up and place my order. A two piece and waffles. After about 4 minutes my food was ready and I took it home.  There was a condiment bar that you could grab small packets of hot sauce, honey, and other fixings.  The best was what appeared to be homemade jalapeno sauce.  It was a delicious mix of a green hot sauce, honey, and what tasted to be butter.\n\nUpon getting home I had two small but tasty Belgian waffles, and 2 pieces of fried chicken (breast and wing).  The chicken was amazing, probably some of the best fried chicken I have ever had.  Hot, crispy, moist, well seasoned and just pretty damn good. The waffle left a little to be desired.  It was Belgian style (I like thin waffles when I have chicken and waffles).  It was also luke-warm and not served with butter, I had to use butter from home, which would have been a problem had I eaten there on the curb.\n\nOn its own the waffle was average, but eating it the right way, one perfect bite of chicken-skin-waffle-syrup-green hot sauce was awesome.  There was the perfect portion of chicken to waffles to make lots of amazing bites, with very little left over.  There was actually a small amount of chicken that didn't match up to waffle that was delicious as I dunked it in the syrup and hot sauce. I would also love a boneless option for chicken to make it a little easier to eat, especially if I was to eat it there.\n\nThey loose the 1 star for a couple reasons.  Not because its take out only or their location as some yelpers have suggested... I don't ever write reviews that ding places for trying to be more or less than they try to be (a McDonalds could be 5-star, just all depends on the experience).  But I digress...\n\nThey loose the star for a combination of: the lukewarm waffle, they don't take credit card, no butter,  and no fountain soda. In these days, places need to accept some form of credit, or use gopaygo, LevelUp, Square, etc. Its not often I have cash on me for cash only places and have to make dining choices based on that. \n\nWill I go back? HECK YES! The chicken was awesome, next time I want a 3-piece.

Absolutely loved it.  \n\nChicken + Waffle + Mushroom gravy + Maple syrup all in one big mouthful = FLAVOR EXPLOSION FTW!  \n\nIt's like when Remy from Ratatouille has flavor explosion fireworks when he eats a mushroom and some cheese together!  That was my experience!\n\nOkay, aite, here we goes again:\n\nTHE YAY:\n+ The chicken was spectacular.  Succulent, crispy, hot, juicy pieces of meat.  Both the dark and white meats were spectacular.  I am picky with fried chicken, it being one of my favorite foods, and this was cooked well.  The perfect combination of crispy skin, juicy meat, and flavorful herbs.\n+ We also got the grits with Andouille sausage and cheddar.  The grits themselves were alright, but the sausage was perfect.  Generous chunks scattered all over the top.  Makes for a very hearty meal.  \n+ They give you big, generous portions for everything, which I appreciated.\n+ It's a bit pricey for chix and waffles, which I hear should be cheaper.  But my friend and I each paid $12 for a ton of food: 2 pc chix/waffles each, biscuits with jam, biscuits with mushroom gravy, and grits with sausage and cheddar.  A bit expensive for lunch, but worth it considering how much food we got. \n+ This alleyway was so sunny, and the location is cute.  There's a perfect concrete ledge across this hole-in-the-wall where everyone sits and enjoys their meal.  Makes for a very casual and happy meal.  \n\nTHE NAY:\n- I wouldn't suggest the biscuits.  We ordered biscuits with jam, but for some reason, they also gave us biscuits with mushroom gravy.  The biscuits themselves were nothing special; it was just mediocre bread.  The mushroom gravy was flavorful, but it's really still not worth ordering the biscuits just for the gravy.  Just order gravy on the side if you want.\n- The waffle was too soft and soggy.  I prefer crispy, thick waffles.  \n\nOtherwise, it was a hearty and delicious meal.  Everything worked so well together.  I love sweet/salty combinations all in one bite, so this was perfect.  Tip: If you call in on your way there, you won't have to wait in line.  We found this very useful; we called as soon as we jumped on the bus to this place, and when we arrived at the storefront 15 minutes later, they had our order all ready!

It doesn't take much for chicken and waffles to be good. The service here was ridiculous. We showed up about 12pm for brunch, ordered food and grabbed a Bloody Mary at the bar while we were waiting. The Bloody Mary was on point with all my favorite southern fixings. Then it went downhill REAL fast. We had to ask twice where our food was, the people around us that had sat down 20 min after us had received their orders. They explained they were short handed and got it out to us shortly after, 45 min after we sat down. My husband's chicken and waffles were cold, I ordered the skillet pancake and it was dry and cold as well. I touched my hand to the skillet, which you're normally told not to touch, and it wasn't even lukewarm. I returned it and explained that I hated to complain but it was that bad. When asked what I wanted instead I said anything that was hot and ready since I was starving and willing to eat anything at that point. He said he'd bring me chicken and waffles which I was more than happy to have, except that what he ended up bringing out was chicken and gravy and again the chicken was cold. He explained the waffle machine was broken and then I watched order after order come out with waffles. I got about half way through it and there was a hair fried in the chicken I had already eaten most of. I've heard such great things about this place and obviously with 4 stars and so many reviews it should be decent, but this was one of the worst experiences I've ever had.", "author": "Kristal G."}

Also, I found the chicken to be nice and crispy with the right amount of breading - I can't stand it when fried chicken is super bready and soaks up a bunch of oil.  The chicken was also very juicy, but I didn't have a breast, which is the true test of chicken-frying skills.

I arrived shortly after opening, only a few people in the place. I walked up to the counter to order, mentioned to the guy taking orders that I had never been there, and I asked him a question about the menu. He was pretty rude to me. I have no idea why; maybe he thought my questions was stupid or something, but it was just a question about two of the dishes. Anyway, I ended up ordering the breakfast sandwich on a biscuit with boneless fried chicken and eggs over easy. The food came out pretty quickly, but the order was completely wrong: on a waffle instead of a biscuit, eggs cooked well done, and the chicken had a bone in it. They managed to quickly swap the waffle for a biscuit, which in hind-sight was a mistake, because the biscuit was so dense that it felt like I was like eating a wet brick. I thought the goal was to make biscuits light and fluffy. Not this place. It was like a rock. \n\nDespite the bone in the chicken, it tasted very good-- juicy, tender, everything you could want from fried chicken.

This is an iconic soul food combination made famous by the Southern California chain Roscoe's. This dish has become increasingly more accepted and mainstream (IHOP is now offering their own chicken and waffles dish). Sure, sure Roscoe's did it first or at least popularized it, but hands down farmerbrown's little skillet perfected it (well at least in Northern California).\n\nIt's hard to make a bad waffle. Shoot you can easily make one yourself as long as you have a waffle maker in your house. So in the end, it comes down to the fried chicken. Where other spots falter with their fried chicken, farmerbrown shines as bright as the Northern Lights. This definitely takes into consideration the fact that farmerbrown's is just little pop up stand looking thing located in an alleyway. Definitely not the type of place you expect to find good food. \n\nThe fried chicken is crispy, moist, and flavorful. There is just the right amount of spices that take your taste buds from Boresville to Happyland. This is definitely winning. The grits with andouille sausage is a solid and hearty dish sans the puddle of grease that rises to the top. But in the end there is no beating the chicken and waffles, a salty and sweet meal that excites and pleases the sense.\n\nI especially love coming here during the spring and summertime.

I made at least five visits during my two-week San Francisco trip (please don't judge!). \n\nAs a true southerner, I wasn't a fan of the grits. They looked very good, but the taste, or lack thereof, left much to be desired. The breads, however ... mmmmm mmmmm good! I tried the biscuits and waffles, and both were superb! On my first visit I had the biscuit sandwich. An enormous homemade cream cheese biscuit filled with egg, cheese and your meat of choice (I chose bacon). This is the good kind of \"slap yo momma\" biscuit you will find in the South. Soft and buttery on the inside (you know, the kind that sticks to the roof of your mouth), with a perfect crisp on the exterior. On another visit, I decided to try their special: chicken and waffles. I opted for a boneless fried chicken breast instead of the bone-in pieces. The breast was a little on the dry side for my liking, and didn't seem freshly fried. Sadly, I was in a rush and didn't have time to wait for a fresh breast. This, and the tasteless grits, are the reasons I give four stars. Otherwise, five stars across the board! \n\nIf you arrive before or after the lunch crowd (11:30 - 1:00), the lines are short and wait times are minimal!", "author": "Natrina C."}

With all that, and a topping of white gravy, my stomach was never happier!  \n\nAs for the chicken and waffles, I can say the waffles can use some work.  It seemed a little undercooked and soggy.  I don't know if it's just the way they cooked it since everyone in our party has the same opinion, but I thought that it would be a lot better if it was actually crispy and cooked well.  I'm pretty sure this is why I can't give this place a five star review.\n\nNow onto the chicken: just delicious!  I can easily say that it is the best chicken that I have tasted as of yet.  I haven't had much experience outside of fast food chicken so I am definitely not a fried chicken connoisseur, but my taste buds know delicious!  Sadly, I eat fried chicken with ketchup because I'm a freak, but I didn't even need to with this chicken!

(doesn't have a sign) My advice is to just look for the line. In addition, don't confuse it with Farmerbrown which is the sit down restaurant near the mall. When we arrived, the line wasn't too bad but it turns out we were just lucky because once we sat down (in an alley) the lunch rush showed up. I ordered the 2 piece chicken and waffles and some mac and cheese. My gf got the 1 piece and some grits instead of the fries at the recommendation of the woman taking orders. The food didn't take very long to come out and it appears to come out at a steady pace despite the line. \n\nThe chicken is crispy but moist and absolutely delicious. The waffle is sweet and coated with brown sugar and the syrup is great.The mac and cheese is a bit runny and chalky but it tastes pretty good and has a bit of spice to it. My gf had the grits with butter which to be honest are really bland. Being a pair of Asian kids, I can only assume it's an acquired taste. So if anything you should stick to the chicken and waffles, seeing as the sides are kind of blah. As a big eater, only having 2 pieces of chicken can be a bit of a tease. And with the sides and drink the bill can get pretty pricey which can lead you to wonder \"wait... that's all I get for my money?\" The sweet tea is all you can drink but it's outside so I'm not sure what's stopping you from just stealing some in a water cup.

The scene generally consists of yuppies lined up ten deep, all for the sake of fried chicken and waffles and I chose to become one of them today. I had a hankering for a good size portion, so I went for the waffle/chicken combo and a couple of their homemade biscuits. The chicken and gravy were decent, but you can never complain about chicken that is served fresh, right outta the fryer. The gravy had a buttermilk base that added some tang and some tasty sausage morsels that were yummy with the chicken and waffle. The buttermilk waffle, well, it was a waffle. Nothing fancy and pretty straight forward. I'm a huge fan of homemade buttermilk biscuits and I can't say Farmerbrown's were a standout. However, their homemade berry jam was spectacular and saved the biscuit from being trashed. \n\nI loved the setting of this place and I would love more stands, holes in the wall, and mom and pop joints to spring up in San Francisco as soon as possible.

It's a little window that you go up to order at and all orders are to-go.  My friends each got 2-piece chicken and waffles, which were $8.50 each.  I got the 3-piece chicken and waffles ($11) and shared with my boyfriend, because we weren't super hungry.  It took about 5 minutes to get our order, then we grabbed a seat on the sidewalk/loading dock area.  \n\nThe food:\n\nWaffle: very light and crispy on the edges.  I could taste a hint of vanilla and overall, the waffle was very fresh, not soggy at all, like I've experienced at other places.  It was topped with a little bit of powdered sugar and was your average belgian waffle size.  (It's $3.50 for an additional waffle if you want an extra.)\n\nSyrup: Comes in a small to-go sauce container.  It is very light/thin and not that viscous, like most syrups I'm used to having.  I poured the whole container over my waffle and it absorbed nicely into the waffle, making each bite just a little bit sweeter.  (Note: my friend has asked for gravy instead of syrup, so if you don't want syrup, this is another option).\n\nFried chicken:  overall, I thought the fried chicken was just alright.

After hearing about it through some co-workers I decided to finally check it out. Situated on Ritch Alley just off of Townsend, Little Skillet is literally just a take out window and most patrons seek refuge on the loading dock across the street (which is amazingly clean for a loading dock). I went with the 3pc Chicken + Waffle ($8.50) w/ a side of sausage gravy for an additional $1. The service was quick, friendly and more importantly my box felt very warm. Upon opening my take out box I immediately discovered an extra piece of chicken!, alongside a very generous container of gravy, a small yet well proportioned side of maple syrup and one quarter of a Belgian style waffle. Here's the breakdown:\n\n-The Chicken: Amazing- perfectly cooked, battered &amp; seasoned. Big thanks for the extra piece! \n-Waffle: Definitely on the small side and could be cooked perhaps a little bit longer but delicious overall... If they included two pieces of waffle we are looking at a 5-Star meal.\n-Sausage Gravy: Not sure why people complain about the amount of gravy you get because I had a bit left over. It's excellent as well but I'm not sure it's needed since the chicken is so good by itself. \n-Syrup: Awesome... nothing else to say.\n\nOverall, I am a fan and will be going back to Little Skillet. Everything I ate was delicious, however, I am still a little bit hungry and would have liked a bigger portion of waffles (maybe an add-on down the road). I think breakfast will be my next stop at Little Skillet... I'll keep you posted.", "author": "Mark B."}

I came here last Monday ~1:30pm.  So what happened?\n\n1) The online menu is inaccurate - the 8-piece chicken box costs $21 instead of $18.  Also, did you know it only cost $15 when they first opened?  A $3 price increase every few months is pretty steep!  It's not exactly a cheap lunch box anymore.  And also FYI, the chicken box now comes with jalepeno cornbread instead of buttermilk biscuits.\n2) The food sucked -\n     -Since when did an 8-piece chicken box contain 1 breast, 1 thigh, 3 drums, and 4 wings??  Getting 9 pieces of chicken does not make up for the fact that you dump all your excess wings on me and cheat me out of the larger, more desired breast and thighs!\n     -This was seriously the worst fried chicken I have eaten in SF - and yes, I am counting KFC as well.  It was not properly brined since it was under-seasoned and dry.  The breast and half of the wing were so dry and tough it was hard to swallow.  Not to mention the chicken was room temp when we received it and the skin was not crispy.  What's the point in eating fried chicken if it's not hot and juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside????\n     -The grits: overcooked, gelatinous, and under-seasoned.  Even after I added salt it still resembled baby food.  \n     -The fries: limp and soggy.\n     -The jalepeno cornbread:  the only delicious thing we received.  Buttery and moist.   \n\nMy advice to others: ONLY COME DURING RUSH HOUR.  IF THERE IS NO LINE DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM LITTLE SKILLET AND GO NEXT DOOR INSTEAD.

Mitch Hedberg may have proclaimed that \"Waffles are just pancakes with syrup traps\" but these are so much more. As for my two-piece, I dabbed a bit of Crystal hot sauce, bit in, and the crispy, not-too-thick skin gave me to tender, juicy chicken goodness. Aww man. At that point, I didn't even care that this meal was probably undoing a week's worth of workouts at the gym, because I was too distracted to notice.\n\nI also happen to think that this place has lots of character - it's basically a walk-up window in an alley with chalkboard type menus.

We finally got to try this place out before a Giants game the other day...and even almost went back after the game. We ordered the 3 piece fried chicken and waffles, waffle dog and a strawberry lemonade to share. The chicken was amazing. You could just taste the complexity of spices mixed together to create the perfect seasoning. This seasoning not only formed a delectably crisp skin, but also penetrated the chicken down to the bone. They must marinate this chicken for a good amount of time to achieve this. And the waffles...holy crap, I have eaten waffles at many a breakfast joints and Farmerbrown had the fluffiest waffles with a heavenly crisp exterior. This entree itself warranted 5 stars for sure. I've just never tasted this type of seasoned coating before. The chicken was also very juicy and not overcooked, even with a slightly darker than golden brown skin. Perfecto! Now the waffle dog, essentially a hot link wrapped in bacon on a bun-shaped waffle with grilled onions and some sort of chipotle aioli. I wasn't too satisfied with this, as it was overly salty and the flavors didn't seem to complement each other very well. Also, the bacon was soggy. I would rather have settled for thinner bacon, but cooked to a crisp. I know general cost of living in San Francisco is higher than other areas of the bay, but $24 was a little more than I expected to spend especially since there was no seating other than the sidewalk. Nevertheless, I will surely be back for the fried chicken and waffles...over and over again.", "author": "Priscilla V."}

The pulled pork and grits was amazing.  I'm not a southerner by any stretch of the imagination, but those grits made me want to give it a shot.  The pork was really tender and well shredded.  And the grits were creamy.  It was, I'll admit, a $10 heart-attack in a takeout container.\n\nThe shrimp and grits were good, but not as imaginatively flavored.  Both shrimp and grits don't have a strong flavor, so the overall dish needed a bit more spice/taste.  Still, the pork grits made up for it, a lot.\n\nMinus points for price: $19 for two orders of grits is a little harsh, even for SoMA.  I don't mind the lack of seating, although if it's between walking back to your apartment or ride, and plopping down on the sidewalk right then and there, go for the latter.

However, I found the flavor lacking...The flavor definitely was not memorable.\n\nSo why am I giving it 3 stars??  Well, I would give any fried chicken at least 3 stars and subtract or add depending on the two criterias that I mentioned.  Farmer brown certainly didn't do anything wrong.\n\nThe waffle is just another waffle.  Their syrup is light and thin, which may indicates a lower sugar content for those who cares.\n\nHonestly, once you've experienced Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, everything else seems ordinary.  Too bad there isn't any Roscoes in Norcal.\n\nPS.  The best fried chicken so far belongs to Roscoes and Churches' Chicken.  I know Churches is fast food, but I gotta give them credit.  \nPS 2.  Another 7x7 suggestion that fails to wow me.  Sigh.", "author": "Ricky N."}

I even ate the chicken skin.  $8.50 for two pieces of fried chicken and a sizeable waffle are not a bad price.

I actually prefer Kraft Easy Mac.  \n2) The seasoned fries are alright but nothing special, again at $4/serving.\n3) Jalapeno corn bread--great if you like corn bread, but a little on the dry side.\n4) I would not suggest taking the food to go if you're traveling far.

We ordered the mac n cheese and potato salad, and they pale in comparison to the chicken and waffles.  Yes, I know they are only sides, but the sides usually complete a great comforting meal.

When you order your chicken, they will ask if you want it dark or white. You can't order a specific piece the way you would at Popeye's or KFC because then they would have to throw away unwanted pieces at the end of the day. If you order all dark, you're liable to get a leg and thigh, if you order all white, you're liable to get breast and wing.\n\nI don't remember if you can order mixed but I'm pretty sure you can. Try, at least!\n-End of Update-\n\nI'm gonna do it. I'm gonna say that this is the best fried chicken within SF city limits. I invite you to prove me wrong as I'm always on the hunt for good fried chicken.\n\nThe Fiance told me about this place but as they are only open on weekdays during lunch, I hadn't been able to partake in the fried goodness until last Friday when work let out at noon and I hightailed it to the alleyway that is Ritch St..\n\nThe menu excited me. It's a soul food, fried chicken kind of place with things like sausage and gravy for breakfast and lemonade and iced tea to drink. The Fiance ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered a two piece combo with fries on the side. And then I got greedy and ordered some biscuits and gravy.\n\nIt was raining a bit but we huddled around until our order was ready (a quick wait, about 10-15 minutes). The Fiance said that we had to have a bite as soon as possible so he held the boxes open while I fed us bites of biscuits+gravy and fried chicken goodness. \n\nThe biscuits (there are two of them) and gravy were decent. I'm no soul food connoisseur so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about (but food is also subjective so pbbt) but I like my biscuits to be less spongy and more solid. The gravy was pretty good but I think I got tired of it after one biscuit.\n\nNow the fried chicken, there's another story. If you follow my other reviews, y'all should know by now that as a Korean, I am a huge fan of fried chicken. Koreans fry chicken differently than other folk but this place does a great job of doing it the non-Korean way. the breading is nice and crispy, not bogged down with grease.

I do love fried chicken, but don't eat it much since I don't want my love of all things fried to make me outgrow my jeans.  So I was pleasantly surprised by the relative lightness of their fried chicken.  Tasty mac n cheese as well.  The bit of potato salad I had was good; I expected it to be very mayonnaisy, but it wasn't and it had a good flavor.  I wasn't a fan of the jalapeno cornbread, but that's because I don't like to mix sweet with spicy (the cornbread itself tasted good).  I was also sad they didn't have Diet Coke (yeah, ridiculous given the rest of my meal, but I actually don't like the taste of regular Coke anymore---too sweet; I like chemicals in my food/drink).\n\nI liked the laidback environment of people lounging across the alley soaking up the sun while scarfing down the fried deliciousness.\n\nIt's probably a good thing that this place is no where near where I live.", "author": "Danielle B."}

Luckily they have a bench and a long concrete platform across the street to sit and eat if you're not taking it elsewhere (they provide seat cushions too if you want). Breakfast is mostly just biscuits (with mushroom gravy, sausage gravy, or butter and jam) or a waffle and lunch is primarily fried chicken (with or without waffles), pulled pork, or a couple of other options. Everything is fresh and homemade at cheap prices which is nice. I got the biscuits and sausage gravy with eggs for breakfast and I thought it was ok but it was definitely not traditional. The gravy was quite thin and there was some sort of seasoning in it that was very reminiscent of some Thai like flavors that I couldn't place.

I couldn't finish as the pieces were huge!  the biscuit was delicious and i topped it all off by getting a red velvet cupcake.\n\nI work within walking distance of this place and definitely will be hitting it up again soon.", "author": "Sonya T."}

Three girls on our lunch break: wearing suits and squatting on milk crates in a sunny alleyway while furtively eating our friend chicken, glancing around nervously every time a car passed by. It wasn't exactly a comfortable dining experience, but was the food worth it? Heck yeah.\n\nI got a 2-piece + side lunch box. The fried chicken was scrumptious: hot, juicy, crispy, and well-seasoned. Not too greasy, and not too fatty. In my opinion, it was just right. At Christina C.'s insistence, I shook some add'l seasoning on, for flavor enhancement. I chose macaroni salad as my side, on the advice of a previous yelper. The macaroni salad is lovely: pesto-y, crispy veggie-y, non-mayonnaise-y goodness. It's got a nice vinegar bite. The biscuit itself was the only thing I wasn't crazy for- alone, it was only \"fine\". Luckily, I had the foresight to order a $1 side of mushroom gravy. One dunk, and that so-so biscuit became so-good! \n\nCheck this place out, it's good eats. It's also quite an experience eating fried chicken with your fingers while hunkered down on a milk crate, low bench, curbside, or loading dock. The food is so good that your self-consciousness over nibbling at food in an alleyway like a common street rat will just disappear in a fog of chicken fried heaven.", "author": "Jessica T."}

I was craving shrimp and grits so I decided to go to the little skillet because I knew it would be fairly quick. The dish was pretty plain. Usually shrimp and grits has a flavorful, oily, seasoned sauce served on top. This was just plain grits, a tiny bit of cheese, and some flavorless shrimp. It came in a tiny cup and was $12! That's basically as much as the entree portion at the restaurant. On the plus side there was a lot of shrimp. I also got a biscuit and when I bit into it I wanted to cry. It was cold and stale and they didn't even give me any butter or jam or anything to go on it!  Saddest day.", "author": "C C."}

My husband had been raving about Little Skillet's chicken and waffles, so I was anxious to finally get my hands on some. And frankly, I was underwhelmed - the fried chicken was good, but the waffle was soggy. Even my husband said he prefered their smaller square waffles from before (guess they had changed them) and the quality wasn't as good this time. Since I am also a huge fan of farmerbrown (their main restaurant), I'm hoping this was just an off-day for them.\n\nFortunately, their grits were on-the-money. Stoneground grits with BBQ pulled pork and chedder...Mmm, mmm, good!!\n\nI'll have to give this place another go around.

I had been looking forward to trying Little Skillet for a long time, and I was only disappointed in one thing -- that I didn't order MORE chicken!!  \n\nSome co-workers and I decided to order some takeout chicken and waffles -- based on the recommendation of the 7x7 Big Eat SF list -- and it was a very happy lunch.  I had two pieces of chicken with a waffle.  I got a nice wing piece and a breast piece, and both were good.  The skin had a nice taste, and the waffle was nice and soft, providing good contrast to the chicken.  Soft + crispy, sweet + savory, the chicken and waffles once again proved to be a perfect combination.\n\nI only had a few small issues with the meal, although some of those may be of our own doing.  Because we got takeout, the skin was not as crispy as it probably was when it was made, and the syrup was a little bit too thin for my taste.  \n\nAlso, we ordered a few extra waffles and a drink, and they forgot to put those into the bag, so that was a bit unfortunate.  I know that stuff happens sometimes, but I still have to take a star away from their review for that.  \n\nMost importantly though, the food was great, and I'm looking forward to trying a few other things -- like the pulled pork, the grits, and the breakfast!

And I LOVE LOVE LOVE Fried Chicken (look to the left on my profile). Thus, I LOVE Little Skillet. It has been on heavy rotation for many, many months now. We usually sleep in, put in a phone order and roll up to the window after parking illegally (sshhh) since it's the weekend. They always sound surprised when we called in but the food was always piping hot. Actually it was mostly the girl that sounded preoccupied and surprised, not the guy.\n\nFood: I have no idea what they put in the breading of this chicken. I would consider trading in my DVR for this business. OK, that's probably a little dramatic but man, this chicken is good. My usual steez is the 2 piece chicken box. The breast is SUPER SUPER SUPER juicy and is usually piping hot. I'm Asian so you know I usually stick to the dark meat but I am not complaining if I get some breast in there, know what I mean? My side is usually the seasoned fries because they're crispy and way delicious. Take it from the potato lady, eat these fries! And the angel biscuit! Oh man, if it wasn't past my bedtime right now, I'd give it it's own paragraph. Fluffy, moist and delicious. SO worth trying. And there's Coke in a bottle (aka Mexican Coke)!\n\nBoo usually has the 2 piece chicken and waffle. Solid waffle and syrup. Yum.\n\nService: Love the guy who seems to run the joint. He's friendly but not in a fake way. And although someone like him (cool) would usually intimidate me (not cool), he's actually really personable. Yay for not being too cool!\n\nOh right, like everyone else said... loading dock. Lovely on a sunny day. Those are rather unlikely though so don't feel ashamed eating in your car. I sure don't!\n\nI do have to mention the latest visit which was a little bit of a disappointment but was given a one time pass because of all the solid visits beforehand. The breast seemed a bit lukewarm and had been sitting a bit. Same for the fries (usually my favorite fries ever). The biscuit seemed cold cold cold as well.

Thus is the reason for the four stars given to Little Skillet. Another reason would be because there just isn't any seating except for a loading dock. While that's fine and fresh by me, it really dashed my hopes of having some crazy-good fried chicken on rainy days (and I guess when there are trucks in the loading dock).\n\nON to the good.

After looking at the menu and reviews, I had this innate yearning to get out of the house and do whatever it took to get there, but decided to go the next day. When we got there, it took a little effort to find parking, 'cause it's right next to AT&T Park as well as in tons of business locales. BRING QUARTERS - it's gonna be meter parking and the lines are long here. We waited about 10-15 minutes in line but when we got the the window, the people were friendly and helpful, and in no way hurrying (as is often the case for places that are busy like this). I ordered the three piece chicken + waffle but forgot to tell them what I wanted, which I was kinda bummed about. The wait was not long at all. Oh - they also have Dr. Pepper in bottles. \n\nThe chicken was incredible though - as in OUT OF THIS WORLD good, probably some of the best chicken I've ever had. The batter was thick and crunchy, perfect with the moist chicken. Incredible. An extra $1 yielded some mushroom gravy which was also awesome, though it seems like a fancy option. Bare-bones chicken is better. The sausage gravy, which my cousin had, was not as good with the chicken (as was the mushroom gravy), though it had a really nice flavor itself.

A one-way alley luckily so I could watch for cops and meter maids.  It's a window, and they served the most delicious food in cardboard boxes.\n\nI got a 2 piece chicken and waffle combo with sausage gravy.  Though the gravy was effing delicious, it was $2 for a container the size of eye cream.  \n\nThe waffle was dusted with powdered sugar and I destroyed it in 4 bites.  Sure, I drowned it in maple syrup.  But it didn't stand a chance. \n\nAnd the chicken.  By the wrath of Thor.  I have never had a religious experience before eating this chicken.  There was one time I had some bad shrimp and I thought I saw demons, but that was completely different.  \n\nThis chicken was hot, steaming, well seasoned, crunchy, supple, not fatty and it was mine to eat.  \n\nI'd lied to my BF about where I was that morning.

The M&C was a little flour-y and grainy maybe from the roux that it was made from, but I probably wouldn't get it again even for $3. The  1 piece + waffle is $7, which we thought was a little on the high side but after taking a bite into the chicken...all the juices flowing out of it made the cost worth it. \nThey also carry this sweet and hot sauce that I used to only be able to get at KFCs in THAILAND.

Got to L.S. at around 11:45ish on a Tuesday.  I would've been first in line if it weren't for my indecisive butt disecting every menu item.  I don't know why I even bothered when the first and only thing I wanted to get before anything else was the Chicken and Waffles.  However, being that L.S. is only open during the week and I never have weekdays off except for that day, I decided to get my feast on.  So, I ordered 3 pcs. Chicken and Waffle (w/ syrup), a Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog w/ Pineapple/Jalapeno Relish, and a Mini Pecan Pie.  I am not ashamed to say that this was ALL FOR ME.  I had to take advantage of the situation.  What's a hungry girl to do?    \n\nI live in the neighborhood, so I took the buffet back to my apartment.  A little over 5 minutes later I reached home, cleared my coffee table and laid my spread out before me.  The Chicken and Waffles were so good.  The Chicken was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of crunch and breading.  It was the perfect crisp.  The Waffle was good.  It wasn't soggy at all and held its shape and crisp during the walk home.  The syrup was simple, but complemented the Waffle nicely.  I even forgot to order one of their fancy schmancy gravies or other C&W toppings.  At the end, it didn't even need it.  It stood great on its own.  Unfortunately, the Hot Dog didn't hold well at all.  It was so stuffed with Relish that by the time I got home, a good portion of the bun was soggy.  I could have forgiven it if the Hot Dog was amazing.  But, it was a little whack.  The Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog (alone) was good.  Wished they could have chosen a different bun for their Dog.  The relish was a bit too sweet (even w/ Jalapenos).  Thankfully, the Pecan Pie was a cute little thing.  The filling was not lacking in any flavor.  It made a great ending to my meal.  \n\nChicken and Waffles are a must when you come here!  So far the best C&W I've had in the Bay.  And in my backyard too?  Shooooooot!  That alone is enough to make me coming back here time and again.  Get the Pecan Pie too as a sweet little side note.  But, don't get the Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog w/ Pineapple/Jalapeno Relish - unless you think you're gonna eat it then and there or if you like your dog soggy.

On the contrary, I'm sort of picky about it since I don't like the mess with all the greasy hands and bones and all that, but oh my goodness, Little Skillet is great. \n\nSimple as it gets in the form of nothing but a window to order from and a loading dock and a few milk crates across the street to sit on if you're lucky, it really is the epitome of an inexpensive lunchtime delight. Add the foodie touch to it in the way that everything is organic and that makes it even better. \n\nThe menu is simple and you can choose from basically waffles and fried chicken, or both (chicken & waffles, of course). I had the three piece chicken & waffle box which came with two wings and a breast as well as a delightfully neat mini-Belgian waffle. The three piece was sort of too much and I walked away feeling a little gross (in a good way), so I would say the two piece should suffice, although it could be worth paying the $1 upgrade for two breasts if you like white meat as I do. It was extremely fresh, flavorful and just awesome. Compliment your food with one of the organic beverages they offer (like organic root beers), and you've got quite a lunch for about $10. \n\nOne trick is that you should go a little after the lunch hour to avoid the line. We went around 1:30pm on a recent afternoon and that really helped us avoid any sort of wait. Otherwise, Little Skillet is highly enjoyable and especially satisfying.", "author": "Justin S."}

The reason we came was because I heard they had Chicken and Waffles and I still haven't made it to anyplace with Chicken and Waffles though I've been wanting to try it forever.  \n\nSo on a recent weekday lunch, we ventured out into a San Francisco alley known as Ritch.  The only time I heard of Ritch was 330 Ritch, which has hosted parties for years.  So even though I have never been to 330 Ritch, I knew where the Ritch Alley was.  We parked half a block away on Brannan and ventured into the Alley.  A very non-descript alley, but once we saw a group of people gathering in front of a spot toward the other side of the block, we knew that must of been it.  \n\nAs we walked closer, yes, it was indeed Little Skillet.  Just so everyone knows, this place does not have a dining room.  Unless the one park bench in front of the spot plus a few milkcrates across the alley constitute a dining room to you.  Also, cash is the only form of payment.    \n\nWe ended up getting the 2 piece Chicken and Waffle for $7.  You can choose which pieces of the Chicken you want (Breast, Thigh, Wing or Leg)  I went for the Breast and Thigh.  The Breast was one of the best pieces of Fried Chicken I have had in my life.  I had the Thigh first and thought it was a little under seasoned but I guess I luckily saved the best for last.  In terms of the waffle, it was only okay to me.  The texture was fine but it tasted too much like a fortune cookie to me.  If anyone's ever had fresh fortune cookies straight from a fortune cookie factory, then that's what their waffle reminded me of.  Many people might like it but it really didn't agree with my tastebuds.  \n\nThey also have a bunch of specialized sodas for $2.  We went with the Empire Root Beer, which is made with cane sugar.

There are some other options, but seriously, why are you going to a place that touts authentic southern cooking to fussy things up with sandwiches and such?\n\nOf course, this being the healthy yelper, there were customizations.\n\nI asked for the waffle without butter, but definitely asked for the house syrup. Mmmm. Had a piece, froze the rest for breakfast the next day. It warms up nicely.\n\nAs for the chicken, took a small authentic bite, and then peeled off the fried shell. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was, and was also very happy with what remained - a generous portion of white meat chicken breast. Later that night it made for a perfectly delicious BBQ sauce slathered sandwich.\n\nAnd apparently it's good fuel.

The sandwich slaw was tasty and thankfully not too heavy on the mayonnaise. The pork was well-seasoned, but very dry. Had there been a good balance of slaw to counter the dryness of the meat, then the sandwich would've been more palatable (much like a hefty portion of vinegar-based slaw on a pork pupusa).

The skin was very crispy and had good flavor and the chicken itself was moist. We didn't like the grits. It was kind of tasteless, needed some salt and butter. The waffles were okay, kind of dry. The syrup helped! Overall I would come back again but it probably won't be my usual lunch spot since it is kind of pricey.", "author": "Amy N."}

Having gone to the main Farmer Brown in da 'hood I went to try this outpost.  Am disappointed to say that the chicken was just \"OK.\"  Nothing special; nothing extraordinary.  Much like the main place but without the ambiance/scene.  \n\nThe potato salad was pretty good and the cornbread was crumbly, but it's just sides.  The chicken was supposed to be the star.  Front Porch's was much better. Heck, dare I say that even Popeye's on Fillmore has more flavor.  I'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between this fried chicken and the one at Safeway. Again this was just OK...nothing bad, but definitely nothing to write home about. \n\nFor those who think this was the greatest FC you ever had, fine, but to me it just wasn't.  Ever tried Joe Jung's or a good Chinese FC?  It's a different style alright but even that has more depth than the Skillet's 1-dimensional creation.  I'll say the lunchtime alley scene is pleasant on a sunny day however.\n\nAnyway combine all that with the $8.50 price for 2 pieces -- I got a 3rd piece either by mistake or because it was an hour to closing! -- and a side meant I would normally be paying $4 for each smallish drumstick or thigh.  Kinda steep for what I got.  Would I go again? Probably not, sorry.", "author": "Me V."}

The waffles are your ordinary Eggo waffles you buy from the store, but they are quality Belgian Waffles! The chicken is great and its not your everyday KFC, but its free range, locally bought, fresh chicken. I've also read in a few articles that they use mainly organic ingredients, which is great! I love eating the waffle with sausage gravy and the chicken with the warm maple syrup provided!\n\nThe lines are usually never too long and go by fairly quickly. I love the scenery around the place and eating on the curb, it fully captures the essence of city life and the ambiance of the great weather!\n\nThe service is great as well! One time, they forgot a piece of chicken in a 3-piece that I had ordered with two other orders of 2-piece chicken and waffles. So they felt so bad for forgetting the piece of chicken that they were going to hook us up with 3 more pieces of chicken total! Since the pieces of chicken are fairly large, we declined but gratefully thanked them for the great service!\n\nThe chicken and waffles has been features on the \"100 things to try in San Francisco before you die\" and it is well deserved!", "author": "Langdon N."}

I went to little skillet yesterday with a dear friend of mind. I read about this review the night before, and low and behold, there is no dining room! It's dining al fresco at its best! \n\nParking was easy to find (Thursday at 11:30 am), but most of it is metered parking, so make sure if you want to eat there, get $3.50 in change for 1 hour of parking if you want to eat across the way (it's located in an alley), or you can do like my friend and I, scrounge for all the car change you can find, which bought us 25 minutes and eat in your car. \n\nThe service was great! I ordered the three piece and waffle (I'm a fat ass) and fresh lemonade and my friend ordered the two piece and waffle (she, not so much a fat ass). As an after thought, I decided to get one of their angel biscuits. As I started to pull out money to pay, the guy at the window said, \"Don't worry, we got you.\" AWWWWW! How nice! I left a tip, but I would have anyway, because he was very pleasant the whole whole time and friendly. \n\nThe chicken was nice and lightly crunchy. Very tender and juicy for fried chicken. And the waffle was nice and soft. I like my waffles to have a bit of a crunch, but might have lost it while walking to the car. I got not one, but two angel biscuits for free!, one with brown sugar and black pepper? on it and a plain one. Super yummy! A nice, tender crumb for both, and that brown sugar on top make just that much better! Light and fluffy biscuits: the best I have ever had! \n\nI will definitely go back to FB little skillet! \n\nI just have to figure out when....", "author": "Rachel N."}

As we made our way on the bus, our stomachs grumbled in anticipation of the soul food - but then the bus made an unexpected stop and the driver put out the cones as he called for maintenance to come out and fix whatever needed to be fixed. Disgruntled and frustrated with our luck, we stepped out to walk the few remaining blocks to little skillet. As we turned onto Ritch and got closer to the food stand, the smell of waffles and chicken became more prominent.\n\nThere was only a handful of people ahead of us and we ordered our food pretty quickly (remember to bring cash!). I opted for a waffle and 1 piece of chicken. While waiting for our food, we thought of places we could enjoy our lunch... we sort of missed the part about it not being a sit down place. There were no tables outside and it had been raining, so the bench across the way was wet. But we discovered a pile of cushions stacked outside, which we dried off and used to sit on the bench to enjoy our meals. I was surprised at the piece of chicken that I received - it was bigger than I expected. The chicken was perfectly crispy and the meat was surprisingly moist and tender (I usually don't prefer white meat because it's often dry). My friend pointed out that there's usually gravy with the chicken, but I think the flavor of the chicken was fine on its own. The waffle was fluffy, and the maple syrup was amazing! It was sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. The flavor was unlike that of any other syrup I've ever tasted (not that I'm a maple syrup connoisseur or anything...). I even dipped the chicken into the syrup for a sweet and salty treat :) \n\nIt didn't take me long to finish my food, and I was definitely satisfied (actually, good thing we got there when we did - they started to close shop soon after we sat down to eat, around 2:15, so keep the early closing time in mind...). It was my first time having chicken and waffles, and little skillet made me wonder what I was missing my whole life. Perhaps next time I'll also get a cup of Blue Bottle coffee at the stand next door :)", "author": "kimberly s."}

The old Oakland establishment was good back in the day. The original Roscoe's in LA sucks worse than KFC. So I was cautiously optimistic when I heard about this place.\n     I'm happy to say that THIS is how chicken and waffles should be done. I can't think of a better fried chicken anywhere in the city. The chicken is juicy, moist, tender, and bursting with flavor. The skin is lightly battered, which helps keep all the goodness locked in. The CRUNCH you get from each bite is ridiculous. Every bite is so loud, that it'll wake your neighbors!\n     The waffles are also good. The fluffy Belgian style waffle has a slight crisp to the edges. The powder sugar and syrup add the perfect contrast to the fried chicken.\n     Overall, I can't think of a better way to wake up then to walk on over to Little Skillet and enjoy some chicken and waffles outside on a nice Saturday morning.", "author": "Siao W."}

The biscuits were salted and had some butter in the center.  Cole slaw was fresh and not overly sweet.  This is pretty authentic southern comfort food.  We should have brought our waffle makers to create the quintessential chicken and waffles.

I think it might have been $5somethin before) you get two or three sizeable limbs of fabulously-seasoned chicken, a biscuit, and a full on container of side (macaroni salad please!) Occasionally they'll have samples of their desserts, like the pecan tart, which was the best I've ever eaten.

Fine, but a little on the soft side.  I'd prefer it a little crispier on the outside, but maybe that's just a fine-tuning issue.\n\nSampled their red velvet cupcake (OK, nothing special) and their mini-pecan pie (wow, AWESOME!).  \n\nIn addition to chicken and waffles, they also have po' boys, salads, biscuits, and chicken w/ sides.

First one of the two girls behind me go their order, then both of the two guys behind them got their order, then the other of the two girls behind me got their order, then came mine. What, Is the kitchen pulling order's backwards? I could see that maybe, if we lived in Bizzaro World that those who order first would get served last, but here on Earth, you're breaking my heart.\n\nAgain, my order could not have been more simple so why the crazy wait? Look, Little Skillet, I'm not venting because I'm overly impatient. I'm a middle child and therefore, patience is probably one of things that I have learned to exercise better than most people so I tend to be pretty chill about most things . . . But when I'm on my short 1/2 hour lunch break and I'm hungry, it really wears on my patience to have to unnecessarily wait for my food longer than I should because everyone behind me is getting their lunch first. So what I want you to know, is that it's not at all cool or trend worthy when cool and trend worthy lunch spots seem to think that just because their food is awesome that it should compensate for less than awesome service and sadly, it's becoming the norm.

That said, based on my first trip to Farmerbrown's Little Skillet, it's great idea with a lot of room to grow.\n\nI headed down to check out the Little Skillet for lunch with about 7 co-workers from the office. We expected a huge line but were delighted to find there was very little wait. The window staff kept things moving very quickly and smoothly. Between the 8 of us we all ordered a variety of things and only one order, that being the BBQ Po'boy, took a longer than average amount of wait time to come up in the window, the rest of our orders were very prompt. \n\nI ordered the chicken lunch box with potato salad. Both items were delicious. Chicken especially was hot and very juicy and held up to the chicken served in the restaurant proper, however, it was supposed to come with a biscuit but it was not included. In fact no one in our group who ordered the chicken lunch box (I think there were 3 of us) got a biscuit as it is said to be served with on the menu. That was a big disappointment. \n\nThe only other problem I saw, and this would be a big one, is that when I went to pick up my order from the window I heard them tell someone who was ordering that they were out of chicken. How can this be?! Under normal circumstances this would be unforgivable, but as it's the soft opening this week some problems are to be excepted and forgiven. I can understand that the demand might outweigh the supply while they struggle to find their footing. \n\nOverall I am happy that Little Skillet is open for business and plan to return in the future, but maybe after a few weeks when all the wrinkles have been ironed out.", "author": "Geoff W."}

Honestly I was a little disappointed. I tried the chicken, waffle and biscuit. Found the chicken a little dry and tough. In my book it was neither here nor there. Meaning it was naughty good. Nor was it all that healthy good either. The waffle was nothing special but I give it an extra thumbs up for giving a good amount of delicious syrup. Overall of the three things I try I would say the biscuit was yummy. It was naughty good in that I can taste butter in every bite. \n\nprice was all right.  Would say it was great. 2 pc for 7.5 isnt a bargain. \n\nLocation: not too bad. Aside from being right next to Blue Bottle cafe, I was amazed at how clean the alley was. In fact, there is a nice ledge across the way that we enjoyed our lunch.", "author": "Lisa C."}

I think the chicken is just cooked, so be sure you don't suck on the bone marrows. The skin is sweet and crunchy. The only odd thing is the syrup.

Today, I stopped at your place to order some food for a few grumbling tummies and was very disappointed. The order did not come out correct until I got home and popped open your boxes. I ordered 4 waffles, 8 pieces of chicken, shrimp po boy, and the BBQ pulled pork po boy. When I got home, there was 12 pieces of chicken and 1 waffle. HOW am I supposed to share 1 waffle with 4 hungry stomachs?!?!?! The sandwiches were the only things correct. Then, it was just until two minutes ago that I remembered during a random thought that you forgot to give me my biscuits that was supposed to come with my 8 pieces of chicken. \n\nThis was such a disappointment that I am not sure I can make it back to try your waffles.  I understand you had a long line and orders were taking a bit longer than expected but if you are running a restaurant/foodie place, you have to give the hungry people what they ordered or you might find a riot at your hands.   I'll give you guys another chance and hopefully your food can throw me off my feet so that I can give you a better star rating.\n\nThanks and have a good night!", "author": "judy l."}

The chicken and biscuit were very good, but I wasn't too big on the potatoes.  My friend got the same thing except she got the macaroni salad side and she wasn't too thrilled with it either.  I think she was expecting macaroni salad like from Hawaiian Drive in or something but this was a bit different.  My other friend had the chicken and waffles and he said it was nothing special.  \n\nOverall the experience was okay.  Chicken was very good.  Red velvet cupcake was pretty good too.

How could this be, that up until a week ago I had NO idea there was a chicken and waffle spot in the city? Plotted and planned and finally made my way over there today with a friend in tow.\n\nMe: 3 Piece chicken and waffle with syrup and cinnamon pecan butter $9.50\nMississippi Mud Pie Cake $3.00\nShe: 3 Piece chicken and biscuit with fries $8.50\n\nThe chicken was as close to perfection as i've had in a while. Cooked ALL the way through (a few places don't know how..you know who you are), battered light and not overpowering yet still crunchy, and fresh, not the sit under a heat lamp in the back cause we cooked you 3 hours ago and then threw some seasoning salt on you right before passing you off to fool those that don't know better. Waffle, while on the smaller side (you know those big huge waffles with the four corners, well it's one corner of that) fits perfectly in the lunch box and actually hits the spot perfectly. \n\nDidn't care too much for the cinammom-pecan butter, I could pretty much take it or leave it. The fries were good. The dessert however did nothing for me. Tasted like a glorified chocolate cupcake with some chocolate powder on top. Next time i'll pass on that if they have it again (it was a daily special) and try the Red Velvet Cupcake. \n\nOther things you need to know:\n\nParking is a b*tch in this neighborhood. For reals. Found a metered spot right near the alley but it was .25 every five minutes.\n\nYes, I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.\n\nAlso, there are crates you can sit on as well as a bench like spot in the alley. Yes, the area once upon a time was a pissy scented pigsty, but for all intents and purposes when we went it was very clean and there were a number of folks hunkered down enjoying their lunch in the alley laughing, talking and having a good time. Major upgrade. \n\nYou can take the underground train down there ( T or N) and get off near the ballpark and walk up a couple blocks. Google map it. \n\nAnd lastly, they are actually quick to put the orders together. I believe we waited about 5-10 minutes total for ours, so those who have the hour lunch break, whoo hoo for you!\n\nOne more recommendation to Little Skillet... put your menu online so peeps can see what you have to offer and plan accordingly.", "author": "Patrice W."}

I ordered everything take out so this may have effected the quality of food since I had to walk 2 blocks to my office. The biscuit was soggy and the gravy tasted like paste w/mushrooms. The chicken was dry and had no flavor. The batter was good but didn't have that crunch I was hoping for. I know they will work out the kinks and I will update my review after the next time. I wish them luck because god knows we need a better alternative from the Louisiana's across from Borders.", "author": "Kato D."}

C'mon, every race LOVES fried chicken, including this Indian. I'll fight anyone who thinks they love it more! I saw this place mentioned by 7x7 and it sounded perfect.\n\nOn the day of a job interview, I missed the Caltrain, so I walked over to the desolate alley Little Skillet resides in. Already knowing what I wanted, I went straight to order....at the wrong shop! I was standing in front of the coffee shop next door. I failed. =(\n\nAnyhow, a few minutes later I was sitting on an elevated asphalt across from it, eating from a cardboard box like a stray dog in an alley. No, more like a stray hyena. I savagely cleaned the chicken down to the bone. Normally, I don't even eat the skin of fried chicken, but this was exceptional. As others have said, it's not very juicy, yet it was so well cooked that even the white meat was tasty. I'm guessing they put crack in it, or human flesh. The waffle was also great--warm, fluffy, I could sleep with it. I'm convinced they stole the waffle iron from a giant, a breakfast-loving giant! The syrup makes the perfect condiment, for both, the chicken and the waffle. It's watery, so it only glazes your food, instead of drenching it, effectively eliminating the soggy waffle syndrome. It has a nice, refreshingly sweet taste. I loved it. All of it. Please don't hate me because you may not love it.\n\nOh, the job interview went great! The fried chicken and waffle didn't slow me down at all. Protein has always worked better than carbohydrates for me. \n\nMMMmmm, if there were a law limiting how much chicken one man can consume, I'd be beyond Charles Manson's level.\n\nEdit: I was looking at the user submitted photos and noticed some photos with a tiny 9-squared waffle. I ordered a one piece and still received the 24-squared waffle. Even my one piece of chicken was a large breast, but that may have been luck.", "author": "Rahil P."}

Soft and gooey on the inside, and crisp on the outside, just as it should be.  And the chicken started out well enough, but then about half way through I took a bite and ended up with something I certainly never expected.  I bit into a large piece of the backbone which came off with an unidentifiable organ still attached to it.  Lets just say I was completely grossed out.

Though I don't like syrup touching my chicken. yuck.\nRegardless, Little Skillet was on the top of my to-try list when I heard they had the best fried chicken. The boy and I came on a sunny Saturday afternoon and shared the 3-piece chicken & waffle, mushroom biscuit and gravy, chili (forgot specifically what kind it was), and a red velvet cupcake (suffice to say, it was enough for us). \nFirst of all, this chicken was ridiculously delicious! It's definitely much more about the flavor and juiciness of the chicken than about the fried batter, which is the case for most places. It's seasoned and cooked to perfection, with the right amount of batter. \nAlso, I LOVED the waffle. It's definitely more of a Belgian waffle--crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and sprinkled with powdered sugar, unlike Roscoe's (of LA fame) waffles, which has the same texture of pancakes.  It was sweet enough that we didn't even need the syrup (good for keeping my chicken syrup-free!). \nThe chili was okay. I know it's offensive, but it kind of reminded us of Wendy's chili. It was good, just not spectacular.\nThe biscuits were definitely a vehicle for the bowl-ful of gravy that was poured onto it. Again, good but not spectacular.\nLastly, I was kind of disappointed with the red velvet cupcake. It wasn't sweet enough for me--but am I eating red velvets correctly? (Are they supposed to be sweet like Sprinkles or a plainer cake for the cream cheese frosting? Someone tell me before I'm disappointed with red velvets forever.)\nIt was a little pricey for the fact that it's a window in an alleyway, but it is pretty high quality, gourmet food. And I didn't mind eating it on the loading dock with everyone else--it felt like a happy, communal picnic.\nThumbs up for using compostable utensils and packaging.\nDefinitely coming back when I'm in the mood for fried chicken!", "author": "Jen T."}

Between two of us, we shared the 3 piece chicken and waffle and the biscuit skillet with bacon, egg, and cheese (two meals = $23). The fried chicken was probably the best part of all the food - it was hot and crispy, but not too dry, and a nice chicken flavor. The waffle was definitely on the dry side and not that special. In fact, the flavor of the waffle itself was a bit like bread or the biscuit, as if they're using their biscuit batter as the base for the waffle batter. The \"skillet\" was really just a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit sandwich. The cheese was shredded and didn't melt well, which reminded me of the store-bought plastic-y cheeses. The biscuit was ok, but not amazing. The food satisfied, and I appreciated the ability to sit outside and eat my warm I-need-carbs mid-day recovery food, but for the price this place is just A-OK.", "author": "Sally R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-08", "description": "One of my fave food spots down in SoCal is Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles. The food is not hyper stellar, but the combination of those two food items with hot sauce and maple syrup makes for an excellent comfort food. That's why when I saw some beautiful fried chicken sitting next to a waffle with syrup dripped all over on the cover of 7x7 magazine, I immediately put the restaurant responsible for that dish on my to do list. \n\nAmbiance (4): Little Skillet is not a restaurant per se, it's more of a window in SoMa that you walk up to and place an order. Right next to it is another window where you can get your caffeine on. Blue Bottle caffeine at that and you can also get some beans to go which might an SF SOP for breakfast places (I noticed the Grind and some other joints doing it too). You can sit down across the narrow alleyway and eat out of your brown to go box and they even provide cushions. If you ever considered moving to SoMa, go down to Little Skillet. This is what that neighborhood is; good food, laid back attitude, sitting on a loading dock (or whatever that raised platform is), a spartan concrete atmosphere the norm. Of course, you can also be living in a modern condo with full amenities as opposed to a 1912 house, so maybe all that concrete is not so bad (wood does better in earthquakes until the fires start FYI).\n\nFood (4): The fried chicken was juicy and had good flavor, but I was expecting a little bit more crunch. I don't remember if the magazine cover had very crunchy looking skin or maybe that's just my preference that I am imposing on the memory of the cover. It wasn't as good as Roscoe's but it was still pretty good fried chicken. The waffle was definitely better than Roscoe's; it was nice and thick and tasty, with deep pockets to catch all that syrupy goodness. Put them together and it is a no frills meal that combines a lot of flavors that you probably don't think of when thinking breakfast/brunch, but Roscoe apparently did many years back (and other historically forgotten culinary figures I am sure). You can take it to go but in my experience fresh baked items like waffles and naan don't do good in closed environments when they are hot as the steam changes their texture for the worse. Best you pull up a bit concrete and enjoy it with some fresh coffee. The coffee was good to go and they use the Blue Bottleish process of drip for the regular coffee, and they also have an espresso machine for you latte lovers.\n\nService (4): Friendly staff manning the ordering and pickup windows. The old school megaphone (think 1920s cheerleading squad) was a nice touch.\n\nValue (4): A little bit pricier than Roscoe's but where else are you going to get this breakfast in the City?\n\nOverall: Good to go. Not as good as Roscoe's, but it has it's distinct SF flair. Now, if they would only open on Sundays, that would be awesome. There have been many occasions in the past where we have thought of going and it's been a Sunday. Regardless, if you enjoy Roscoe's you should head over to Little Skillet.", "author": "Alvaro H."}

The first time I really loved it, but this time I went at 12:30 and the chicken was cold and dry & the biscuit was cold. The chicken still had the essence of great seasoning, but cold and dry.\n\nI have to note that the prices went up about 15% as well, which is a noticeable jump. This is an observation mainly, but it also relates to my ratings because if they are charging more, their offerings should be on par.\n\nI would much rather have waited a few more minutes for hot chicken and biscuits than get cold, dry and fast. I will probably go back, but I hope management takes note and can make some changes.

The place is located in what appears to be an alley - yes an alley.  If you come around noon though you won't have a difficult time finding the place b/c there will be a long line (usually about 10 deep) in font of a pick up window.  Don't worry though, b/c the line is amazingly fast.\n\nTheir menu is simple...they have fried chicken, waffles and po'boys.. ohh and some amazing biscuits (more on that later).  My coworker raved about the fried chicken and I was in the mood for some waffles (go figure) so that's what I ordered.  I added in some mushroom gravy just to round things out.\n\nAfter ordering my food I stepped to the side and waited.  After about 5 minutes I heard my name called from the window which is lighting fast (especially during lunchtime).  While waiting though, I was able to admire the 20 or so people sitting across the street on the \"dock\" taking in the sun and enjoying their food.  It had a neighbor hood vibe which is cool.\n\nOkay...so on to the food.  I must admit. I eat food in sections.  Yes, you heard it, \"sections\".  That means I eat the appetizer first, the sides next and then the main course.  And the most important rule, is that I don't mix these things...EVER.  So following these rules, I ate one piece of chicken (which was okay) and then had a bite of the waffle (which was okay too).  I was like man..there has to be more to this b/c ppl were lining up to get their food.  So what did I do...I threw the rules out the window.  I put the waffle on the plate, poured some syrup on it then put a piece of chicken on top of the waffle and poured the gravy right on top.  By now other people in the office were curious and wanted to know how it would taste.  So I dove right in.  I got a little piece of everything and I must say the combination is OFF DA HOOK!!!!!!! I was so smitten by the taste that I turned to my coworker and told him he had to construct his food the same way.  I was raving about the food and couldn't get enough. I wanted to go back after work to and get some chicken and waffles for dinner.  While enjoying this amazing combination I was offered a biscuit.  I bit into the biscuit and it had this biscuit like texture but also reminded me of a roll.  I was confused at first but with each bite I fell in love with the satisfaction of having both a biscuit and a roll at the same time.  Its definitely something that I've never had before.\n\nSo...the bottom line.  This place is great and the prices are perfect.  The service is quick and I just love the fact that you order out of a window and there are people hanging out at the dock.  I'll have to give this place four stars b/c they don't take credit cards and the chicken by itself is okay.  Spice it up with some mushroom gravy and don't forget to add in the waffle and syrup!!!", "author": "Brian T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-02-04", "description": "For my first visit this week I gave them one star. My chicken was cold, not moist, tasted old. My FF's were just plain bad, cold, were nothing more than crispy/greasy little bits and pieces of French Fries. They forgot my biscuit..... and I was not impressed! One star.\n\nToday I decided to visit them once again and I ordered the exact same thing: Two-piece breast/leg with side of FF's.\n\nI give the chicken 4 stars this time. As the girl handed the box to me I could feel the heat.... I knew this time there was hot food inside.\nThe chicken was crispy, piping hot, very moist and juicy. I personally don't care for one of the spices they use, but you may! The chicken this time was much better. It is obvious to me now that the chicken I received the first time was not freshly cooked and they needed to change the grease. It had been cooked in old grease.. thus the dark color, lack of flavor and soggy texture.\n\nThis time the color was a light golden brown, and as I stated above was very hot, crispy and moist or juicy. Much better...\n\nThis time they remembered the biscuit. Overall I give 3 stars to the biscuit. It was not outstanding, not bad either, just rather flat but had good taste nevertheless....\n\nThis time they included a little tub of ketcup..... nice touch...\n\nMy French fries however, FAILED AGAIN!!!!!  Skillet employees... if you are reading this please understand that you cannot serve these one inch bits and pieces of French fries to your customers. Throw them out! Again they were not hot, not complete French fries.... just a pile of over cooked bits and pieces in the bottom of the box. \n\nThis visit I can only give them 2 stars. Here is why: They are not consistent! A well managed restaurant kitchen has to have a quality control program in place... a designated person to oversee the food going out the window. Someone has to do a better job of setting standards for this place. The employees put out good food one hour and bad food the next. Why? Because of two reasons... a lack of quality control enforced by a kitchen manager and a staff who for whatever reason does not mind putting out bad food too! \n\nQuality control has to happen at every level. The person making the fries has to know better... he/she has to know when to throw out those unwanted bits and pieces.... has to monitor the fries and not over cook or cook too many for the volume. Most people do not mind waiting a few extra minutes for chicken and fries that are piping hot, crispy and of great quality. \n\nThis place IS hit and miss and I understand why! Someone has to do a better job of supervision. Someone has to do more training regarding standards and quality control. Someone has to do a much better job at monitoring how much food is prepped in advance of \"the rush\". It's all about timing...... so my suggestion is to pre-cook less and try serving hot and crispy and whole French fries.... try to serve chicken that has been cooked in fresh or freshly filtered grease. But how do you do that? By having a staff who actually gives a shit and by having a manager who also gives a shit..... and by having an owner who won't tolerate bad food. P E R I O D.\n\nI will try this place again next week to compare for the third time....\n\nTwo stars this time.", "author": "Mark F."}

But this was the first time I've had chicken and waffles together.  And let me tell you... the combination was wonderful! \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the three piece chicken combo for $9.50, which included a biscuit and side order [we chose the french fries].  One of the specials for the day was sweet and spicy mustard chicken wings for $6, and since I love chicken wings, I had to try them.  We had to order a waffle [$3.50] on the side too since the meal didn't seem complete without one.  There is no seating here so we drove over to China Basin Park behind AT&T Park to eat.  The problem with not being able to eat our food right away was that it got cold VERY quickly. =(\n\nThe wings were more sweet than spicy but did have a slight kick at the end.  The waffle was lovely... slightly crispy but still soft on the inside.  The chicken though... was marvelous!  The crispy skin on the outside was seasoned and fried well, instead of just deep-fried.  The chicken was moist and well seasoned, even the chicken breast.  The biscuit and french fries were not that great.  The biscuit was not that flaky; it was more bready and kind of a disappointment.  The french fries were HORRIBLE.  They were extremely over-fried and we couldn't even stab them with a fork.\n\nOverall, the meal was enjoyable.  i wish that they had more seating or that there was somewhere closer to eat so that my food didn't get cold.

Since most of the clientele here are Hipsters, I should've known better but decided to give it a try. I get the chicken and waffles and I'm like,\"Wtf?\" A Belgian waffle? Seriously? And the chicken didn't look like it was fried right (too light) but I say what-the-hell and just start eating it. I'll give it that the waffles were good,light and airy with just the right crunch but being a Belgian waffle sort of kills the authenticity. The Chicken....they need to learn a thing or two. Undercooked and no flavor. I know I'm sounding cruel and I really hate to come down on an up and coming establishment that supports a good cause but they really need a lot of work. They're serving chicken and waffles and that's it. Chicken and some waffles.

It's only a few blocks from the ball park, so very convenient that morning.  We didn't really know what to expect, so when we got there, we were a little surprised.  There was no restaurant or seating area, just a counter to order your food.  I loved how you had the option to order the pieces of chicken you wanted with your waffles.  I got the 1 piece with waffle and hubby got the 2 piece with waffle.  There was also this little coffee stand next door that had blue bottle coffee - awesome, we got 2 cups to go with our breakfast! So, like I mentioned earlier, there was nowhere to sit.  But across the alley, there was a loading dock and everyone sat there to eat, so we found a spot and got ready to eat.  After 10 minutes, we noticed that our order still wasn't ready yet.  We saw people constantly going up to the counter to pick up their orders but nothing for us.  We asked and it turned out that they forgot our order.  But, they got on it right away and we had our order in 2 minutes.  And to make it up to us, they gave us a free red velvet cupcake for dessert.  That was nice of them! Yes, we waited a little bit for our order but it was completely understandable since they looked pretty busy, and there were literally 2 people in the back doing all the cooking.  As for the food, well, it was definitely worth the wait.  The chicken was crispy and flavorful, and even though I ordered the 1 piece, it was a pretty generous size.  The waffle was also great.  It was nice and crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  Pour on the maple syrup and it was the perfect meal! We were so full after our breakfast that we didn't eat the red velvet cupcake until a couple of hours later.  And when we did eat it, we were amazed at how moist and fluffy it was, even hours later.  The frosting was yum yum yum, not too sweet.  My favorite is still the red velvet at Teacake, but this one from Farmerbrown's Little Skillet came pretty darn close.  We'll have to go again next time before heading to a Giants game!", "author": "Kat M."}

It might sounds like a hyperbole, but it's just that A-MA-ZING. Little Skillet not very close to work, but I was dedicated to finding out whether the reviews of this place were true, so I took the streetcar from work and made it there by 12 pm. Turned out to be a good move, since by 12:20 pm there was a big line outside the window. Initially, I was conflicted between the pulled pork po'boy and the chicken and waffle combo that Little Skillet is known for, but after very brief deliberation I decided to go with the classic. And I do not regret it a bit. The chicken was tender and moist, with thin crisped skin and delicious flavor. Every piece was melting in my mouth. The waffle turned out to be great as well, not too soft, not too hard and with just the right amount of sweetness. It was just a perfect lunch: sitting on the shipping dock under beautiful sky, eating tasty food, watching good looking people around.

May I say that the chicken and waffles is the the bomb!!! I'm not a purveyor or expert of chicken and waffles - this being my first time - but it was just heavenly. I found the chicken to be flavorful and very juicy and the waffle very fluffy. Oh, and the syrup that comes with the waffle? It was as if God Himself came down from heaven to bless the syrup.

Head over to the ballpark to meet up with my friend who was already waiting in line since there was a bobble-head giveaway. Then I start to dig in. Well, I was kind of disappointed in the chicken because it was not as crispy or juicy as I had expected. Also, the flavor of the meat could have been better, needed more seasoning. After finishing my leg, wing, and breast piece, I douse my waffle with the container of syrup. This brought my meal to a satisfying end, because that waffle was huge! I've had juicier and tastier chicken from kfc and popeye's so I can't say this chicken is anywhere near the best.

The fried chicken was ok but then again maybe my expectations were too high since so many people were raving about this place. I'll definitely need to give this place one more try.", "author": "Xuyen H."}

The chicken was crispy and flavorful.  The syrup could have been a tad richer.  But the waffle was pretty bad- like a brick.  The flavor wasn't bad but it was solid like a rock.  Granted, we ordered in advance and then walked ten minutes with it.  Maybe it's better fresh.  Overall, pretty good and a definite must-try.  But probably won't make it a regular lunch stop.  Remember- no credit cards!", "author": "Alex C."}

I try to eat really healthy, but if it's not too greasy, fattening or processed, i'll give in and that i did.  I had 1 chicken (not greasy, juicy, crisp, free range chicken - fabulous) 1 waffle - light and fluffy w/ a little syrup ( though If i'm gonna do it guys, you might as well give me the butter too) and just to keep me still balanced i had a 1/2 salad (fruit, lettuce, asparagus - very fresh).  Got some sun, met some people - - great experience.  Keep up the good work.  Oh AND they actually emptied the garbage cans while i was there as all the customers keep them pretty full - - you got it all going on, no detail gone astray.", "author": "Candice C."}

I had the waffles and chicken that I read about in my hotel room 7x7 magazine.. I am glad that I tried it out and would love to go back.. I would recommend this place to anyone!", "author": "Brian H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-06", "description": "First the disclaimer, went to LS today with the intent of ordering the fried chicken, but while waiting in line decided on the pulled pork sandwich.  We arrived at 11:40a and the line was reasonable.  We received our food quickly and I enjoyed the vibe and eating lunch on the loading dock across the street.  My pulled pork sandwich ($9) with homemade chips was good, but I couldn't help thinking that maybe I should have had the fried chicken since the sandwich was just OK.  My friend had the BLT salad ($8) - when she opened the box it wasn't appealing and there was way too much dressing.  I wouldn't order either of these items again, but will try LS again and order the chicken and waffles.", "author": "Lori G."}

No need to waste words on describing it - just go try it.  The po' boys are also quite good.

So the second time we went we called in advance as was told - by a live person at Little Skillet - they open at 10 pm (it was a Saturday night).  But when we showed up they never opened - we waited and waited and no one answered the phone and they never opened.  What is up with that???  Booo!", "author": "Mary L."}

The food was cheap.which is a plus, but the chicken was just ok. The gravy was horrible!! Didn't anyone else notice that the herb-mushroom gravy tasted exactly like Campbell's cream of mushroom soup?? The waffle wasn't that great either. I will definitely not go back to this place", "author": "Eduardo I."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-26", "description": "I ordered the 3 piece chicken with waffle meal. I have to say the third piece of chicken was a tad small, but after eating the entire meal I have to say it was worth the price. Waffle and syrup were made for each other. Not too sweet, just the right amount. Can't wait to try other items. People around me were showing off their meals as if it was a lunch time show and tell. I would have gladly sampled their meals if they let me. Be prepared for a little wait, around 5-10 minutes at 12:30. Even saw eye on the bay there, so I'm sure even more people will be bombarding this place soon. Cash only.", "author": "Nicole C."}

The combination with a waffle was a bit strange to me, but the waffle was good, too. My friend's po boy shrimp sandwich looked great, too, with lots of shrimp. Oh, I tried a red velvet cupcake and it was good, too. The staff was super friendly and nice. I like this place!", "author": "Charlie S."}

The line wasn't too bad since it moves fairly quickly. I was concerned when I found a wrapper baked into my biscuit. It was only half a wrapper so I think the other half may have been in someone elses biscuit. It was an honest mistake, but it ruined my meal so I probably would not return.", "author": "Nora D."}

And like farmerbrown it has a great style all its own.  In an alley.  With no tables or fuss.  Just good food and nice people.  I had the 2pc Chicken and Waffles and wanted to go back for more.  My friend had a veggie Po Boy and loved it.  Just good simple food, it is amazing how hard that is for some places but not here.  And also, they have Dublin Dr Pepper and that in itself is a reason to keep going back.  Good work people.", "author": "Brian S."}

Their po boys and fried chicken are petty tasty too, but then again, when isn't fried chicken good?  The one detraction that this place has is that it's next to Cento and the two combined have attracted a huge following among the local crowd.  The lines get silly crowded during lunch time, and this is a food window with no formal seating.  Still, I get my waffle w/ whipped cream cravings and will continue to brave the crowds.", "author": "Loc N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-04", "description": "Four stars is a stretch, but merited in this case because the waffle was perfect.  Waffles are usually a complete disappointment, which is a pity because I crave them all the time, but these are just perfect.   The fried chicken is pretty good too.  The breading is crisp and flavorful and there is not too much of it.  The dark meat was tender and juicy but the white meat was a little dry and thats difficult to correct.   BarbersQ seems to get it right but in a fast food venue such as this its probably not to be expected.  I had to wonder where the chicken is from;  the fact that they don't advertise the origin is a bit suspect.  The crowd in line ordering and lingering in the alleyway eating was entirely under 30, all seemingly high tech worker bees.  I tried to eavesdrop on conversations but it was difficult.  People were either talking on cell phones or about cell phones.  In my day a cell phone weighed 20 pounds and you put it under your car seat.  Many of them were grabbing a cigarette, which probably goes well with fried chicken.  One could extract a couple of sociological observations from this experience:  (1)  No one over 30 has a job, (2) No one over 30 eats fried chicken, and (3) No one over 30 smokes.  When I was in my 20's we were taught not to trust anyone over 30.  Now I wouldn't trust anyone who doesn't like fried chicken.", "author": "David T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-19", "description": "OMG, what a find!! I happened to stumble upon this place while searching Yelp for fried chicken. A couple co workers and I went to check this place out last Friday. It's a pretty cool idea. It's basically in this alley and it is a lunch counter. They have all these awesome food items such as chicken and waffles and a pulled bbq pork po' boy. They also have daily specials like a bacon wrapped hot dog po' boy!!! wow!! I have to side with the fried chicken though. The chicken is absolutely delicious. The perfect blend of crispiness, seasoning, and moistness. The waffles are really good too but a little on the small side. But I guess beggars can't be choosers. A 2 piece chicken and waffles is $7 and you can choose what pieces you want (extra $1 for a 2nd breast.) The one caveat I have is to get there early! If you don't beat the lunch time crowd, you can end up waiting a while for your lunch. Other than that, this place is amazing.", "author": "aron l."}
