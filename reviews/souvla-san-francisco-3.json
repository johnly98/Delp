I can't speak for the pita sandwiches or other things on the menu, but I've gotten these two salads: \n\nPork shoulder salad (5/5): the pork was cooked perfectly and nicely tender. I loved the sweetness of the red onions and the creaminess of the cheese in this salad- all the flavors blended really well and if I go back to Souvla, this would be my go-to salad pick\n\nLamb salad (4/5): this salad was up there but compared to the pork, I think the lamb was a bit tougher and not as tender/juicy. I got a bit tired of chewing after a while and some bits of the lamb were dryer and less flavorful. Overall still a yummy salad that really fills you up though.", "author": "Joy C."}

The bussers are always on top of it and super quick to clear dishes to move tables quickly.\n\nWe ordered -\n\nPork salad - always my go-to. Tons of fresh, quality ingredients that contrast with each other so well. Juicy, fatty pork, crunchy cucumbers and onions, creamy dressing on hearty kale and romaine. One thing I don't like about the salad is that it comes with TOO MUCH feta. #firstworldproblem. A+\n\nLamb wrap - The creamy, spicy harissa sauce and well-seasoned lamb are the stars of this. The pita bread is soft, warm, and chewy. However, the distribution of ingredients was a bit off. The pita was so large that you had to eat it in two sections - the top & bottom of the pita. Top was all veggies while the bottom was the meat and sauce. It would have been nice for the ingredients to be mixed within the wrap or even just sauce ontop of the veggies. B\n\nFries - the fries were overcooked and too crunchy. The perfect fries should be crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, which these fries were not. Some fries felt like we were just biting through crust to get to the oily center. C\n\nVery affordable for the quality and quantity of food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-18", "description": "Huge fan of fast casual / counter service in San Francisco and the Souvla chain ranks among my top favorites.  The menu is narrowly focused on 3 types of spit roasted meats (and 1 veggie option I never bothered trying) offered in two forms: salad or pita sandwich.  Much more unique than regular soup/salad joints because the rotisserie meat is simply amazing.  Plus the ambiance almost feels like a full service restaurant.\n\nChicken Salad: I'm not a salad kinda guy, but I'm totally into Souvla's chicken salad.  They're really generous with the chicken, cheese and creamy sauce.  The fruit and veggies work very well to complement all the aforementioned umami and richness.  It's like you're getting your vegetables, but you're not sacrificing taste.\n\nChicken Sandwich: I am in utter disbelief that I prefer the chicken salad to the chicken sandwich.  Same central ingredients, but wrapped in a chewy pita.  The chicken is delicious of course and it's really packed in.  The pita is delicious too.  The sandwich just feels really heavy.  I noticed myself missing all that kale from the salad, which does a great job cutting the fattiness of the filling.  Also, the breast meat chunks felt particularly dry against the starchy pita.", "author": "Adam B."}

Especially with the huge pita bread. I'm not much of a pita person, so I mostly just ate the insides. Flavor wise, I thought the whole sandwich was a little bland. It needed more than just the yogurt sauce to add flavor. The fries were great! Arrived crispy which is hard when it comes to delivery. I actually used the yogurt from my sandwich as a dipping sauce for the fries. I liked the froyo as it was nice and tart. The baklava was a little hard to eat as it came in a giant clump on top of my dessert. It was hard to break apart and eat with the fro-yo.

The \"granch\" dressing (I think it's supposed to be a Greek yogurt-based ranch), pickled red onion, mizithra cheese, incredibly juicy chicken, and naval orange combination is beyond flavorful.

The atmosphere of both locations is pretty consistent with the same kind of Instagrammable decor found at every trendy spot in San Francisco these days, but it's more spacious here (brownie points for the heated patio in the back!), something for which you'll be thankful when it inevitably gets crowded.\n\nLet's get down to business now: the baklava froyo. It's frozen Greek yogurt topped with baklava crumbles and honey syrup. Don't forget to mix the baklava while you eat to maintain a good baklava-to-yogurt ratio. The sweetness of the baklava and the tartness of the Greek yogurt is a match made in heaven.", "author": "Amy C."}

Unfortunately, I think I was given the chicken sandwich instead of the lamb because the toppings were totally different than my friend who ordered the same thing. Regardless of that, I thought the flavors were amazing (although it would've been better if I got the lamb). \n\nMy favorite part of Souvla is their Greek yogurt soft serve which my friend raved about. We actually ended up visiting both locations because the machine at this one was broken. This is a MUST if you're at Souvla. The Greek yogurt with baklava crumble and honey syrup was so good.

My friend and I hit this location up on a weekday for lunch and were pleasantly surprised to find that it has a gorgeous back patio! The weather was a mix of chilly and sunny so we opted to sit outside and enjoy the greenery and sunshine. So in terms of leaf eater options, there's only really the sweet potato or other sides. I went with a roasted sweet potato sandwich and opted to grab some Greek fries on the side as well. So full disclosure, I actually do not like sweet potato very much. However, I always feel like I should give it a chance because you can prepare it so many different ways and maybe one way will click with my palate. Unfortunately, the sweet potato at Souvla was more on the sweet side than I'd like. I found it hard to finish my sandwich because I couldn't get past how sweet the overall taste was. If you like sweet potato, you will most likely love this sandwich and appreciate it wholeheartedly. If you're a sweet potato avoider like me, you may want to skip it. \n\nYou may be wondering at this point how I could rate this place a 4.0 when I didn't even like the sandwich. Well you see, there's nothing I love more in this world than french fries, especially if they are done amazingly well. Souvla KILLED it in terms of having some of the best fries I have ever had. They were crispy, flavorful, and delicious without being too oily. They're also served with a dip (you can choose from a list) and my friend and I chose the garlic one which was an amazing decision.  \n\nMy friend ordered the lamb sandwich and juicy potatoes. If you a strict vegetarian, keep in mind that these potatoes sit under the meat and are covered in the rotisserie drippings. Because of this, I didn't eat the potatoes. However, my friend did tell me that they were good, but not as good as the fries.\n\nService was great when we ordered and my overall experience was great, minus the sweet potato.

I am not a fan of tipping with options of 15%, 20% and 25% before I receive any service. I will happily tip well when I get great service, but I didn't get to judge that before tipping.

Although I still do feel like it's quite gentrification-y, I found myself quite satisfied with the food (and enticed by the Greek yogurt P:)\n\nTL;DR - Tasty California-Greek fast-casual, but so expensive! Wraps are $10 veggie, $11 pork, $12 chicken, $13 lamb. +$1 for the salad. I probably subconsciously gulped with each extra dollar I noticed as I scanned the menu. We ended up spending $30 for a quick lunch for two o.O\n\nThe CHICKEN SALAD turned out to be hearty and surprisingly filling. I liked the kale base, though the random pieces of romaine seemed out of place. Overall, the citrusy navel orange, sweet pea shoots, mildly pickled red onion, and decadent mizithra cheese shavings created a delicious, well-rounded salad. I wish I asked for less dressing (it's \"Granch\", tasted identical to ranch; would have much preferred a healthier yogurt based sauce like all the other choices). I appreciated the generous portions of roast chicken, but it was too salty and dry in my opinion. I had trouble finishing it towards the end because it was so salty! But I guess the healthiness from the kale and free-range chicken balances out the negative health effects of all the salt :3\n\nI also took a bite of the boo's PORK SANDWICH. As you are greeted by rows of rotisserie pork shoulder with salivation-inducing aroma at Souvla, I was excited to try this slow-roasted pork. It had good flavor, but like the chicken, I found it way too salty. \n\nDespite my complaints of the saltiness, the famous frozen Greek yogurt comes to the rescue for a dessert of redemption. We got the CRETAN WILDFLOWER HONEY YOGURT (because I'm too cheap to pay an extra dollar for the baklava crumbles :) and it was magical. The tart yogurt paired excellently with the sweet, floral honey. It reminded me of Shake Shack's frozen custard, only healthier and lighter. The consistency was also perfect, not too frozen and not too melty while we devoured it. \n\nOne thing about their food that was unexpected is the lack of hummus. Seeing that it's such a big health food trend, I think their menu would benefit from some hummus spreads and sauces. (They could even use Costco/mass-produced hummus, and no one would really know!)\n\nThe space is picture-perfect--olive wreaths on the walls, wooden tables, metal stools. Service is also very fast; the food arrives in no time after you order. \n\nThe verdict? Kale salads, free-range chicken, Greek yogurt, hefty prices, Pinterest-like decor, and inclination for aerial Instagrams scream gentrification, but the frozen greek yogurt...

I had several places bookmarked before my weekend in the Bay and Souvla was first on my list! Hubs wasn't hip on the idea of Mediterranean since he goes on business trips there and has had his share of it. \n\nI dragged him here anyway and he was just as pleased as I was! We ordered the pork shoulder sandwich, fries and salad. The sandwich was huge, we shared it and still couldn't finish it! The fries were mediocre, I think I'll order the juicy potatoes next time. The salad was delicious. With feta, olives, cucumber, romaine, tomatoes, and kale. Both the sandwich and salad was on point! \n\nThe cashier was friendly and the service was fast! We dined outside in their urban landscaped patio. I'll definitely make a return trip if I'm in the area! Delicious, fast, fresh and healthy food!", "author": "Micki M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-08", "description": "With New Year's having just passed, I'm sure we're all still keeping with our resolutions to eat healthier and to lose those extra pounds we've been lugging around.  To be sure, it's not easy to stay disciplined with hitting the gym and eating healthy, but it's definitely a lot easier when you can eat salads as delicious as Souvla's!  Yes, they may not be the healthiest ones out there, but HEY...it's better than not eating a salad at all!\n\nSince I've never been to their spot in Hayes Valley, it may (or may not) be better than this Souvla, but I still think this one is pretty damn awesome!  While it initially looks small, there's actually a good amount of seating (they have a nice back patio area).  Most  importantly though, the food is terrific!  The menu isn't extensive (choice of pork, chicken, lamb, or vegetarian as a salad or sandwich/wrap, sides, soup, and frozen Greek yogurt), but I've enjoyed just about everything I've tried.\n\n-- GREEK FRIES - Olive OIl, Lemon Juice, Parsley, Mizithra Cheese (with Harissa-Spiked Yogurt)...$4 (+$1)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/souvla-san-francisco-3?select=Cq2KAO1PJt2ya1V0dyQp4A)\nThe Harissa-spiked yogurt (which is the same as the one in the lamb salad, I believe) made for a terrific dip, but honestly, it was kind of unnecessary as the fries were PERFECT!  I loved the mizithra cheese and lemon juice, but I was most impressed with how crispy the fries were!\n\n-- SUPERIOR FARMS LAMB LEG - Harissa-Spiked Yogurt, Cucumber, Radish, Pickled Red Onions, Feta Cheese...$14 (Salad)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/souvla-san-francisco-3?select=WGpd-KET4TPSgNiIyImTBg)\nDespite really wanting to try their pork, I felt compelled to get the lamb the first time I came here (Greek restaurant and all).  Thankfully, it didn't disappoint!  The lamb tasted great, was really tender, and wasn't the least bit gamy.  What's more, the harissa-spiked yogurt and feta complemented the lamb really well.\n\n-- MARY'S FREE-RANGE CHICKEN - \"Granch\" Dressing, Fennel, Navel Orange, Pickled Red Onions, Pea Shoots, Mizithra Cheese...$13 (Salad)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/souvla-san-francisco-3?select=S2oIhNemaYa6qs_uX0nu8g)\nI was hopeful, given how good the chickens looked spinning inside the rotisserie oven, but it was underwhelming.  While decently flavorful, the chicken's consistency was uneven; some pieces were fine, others were hard and dry.  Still, the rest of the salad was pretty tasty, especially the dressing and the brightness the oranges added.\n\n-- AMERICAN HOMESTEAD PORK SHOULDER - Minted Greek Yogurt, Cherry Tomato, Pickled Red Onion, Cucumber, Feta Cheese...$12 (Salad)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/souvla-san-francisco-3?select=JwqMorJrwBpt0j-jlEB7GA)\nMy favorite of the three.  Not only was the pork cooked perfectly (crisp on the outside, juicy and moist on the inside), but it tasted AWESOME!  The seasoning on the pork was great and mixed really well with the minted yogurt, feta cheese, and pickled red onions.  Delicious!\n\n-- CRETAN WILDFLOWER HONEY Frozen Greek Yogurt...$4\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/souvla-san-francisco-3?select=uq-i7nkwzkku36Qj6WvMkA)\nUnlike what I expected, the yogurt was really creamy and not quite as tart as I thought it'd be (which is a good thing).  Of course, the honey definitely helped with the latter.  I'm not sure how to describe it, but the honey felt lighter and sweeter than regular honey (though not abrasively sweet).  Thankfully, it didn't have a strong floral tinge to it either.\n\n-- BAKLAVA CRUMBLES & HONEY SYRUP Frozen Greek Yogurt...$5\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/souvla-san-francisco-3?select=MLkHkgAHqyl3PGpt0J5NcA)\nAs much as I liked the Cretan Wildflower on the frozen yogurt, the Baklava was so much better!  Not only was there a good amount of it, but the baklava added a nice textural contrast and had just the right sweetness to offset the tartness of the yogurt.  YUM!\n\nBeyond simply how good all of the food was, Souvla is a fantastic value for the money.  I haven't had their sandwiches/wraps yet, but $12-14 for a salad this tasty and filling?  I paid the same for a salad at Squat & Gobble and it wasn't nearly this god!  Plus, the workers here are all so friendly, which makes just that much better in my book.\n\nSouvla, you probably aren't as healthy for me as I'd like to think you are, but I sincerely hope that I'm wrong...because your salads (and frozen Greek yogurt) are definitely something I can build a diet around!", "author": "Mike L."}

It was also easy to get a table after ordering.

Lamb was tougher and dryer than I would have liked. Again with the rating I expected a melt in your mouth, more-ish sort of dish but it fell abit short. \n\nLamb salad - quite pricey at $14 but it was a huge bowl. Not authentic Greek but I guess it's modified to suit San Franciscan tastes (they promise to use local produce after all). For kale lovers.\n\nGreek fries - crisp thick-cut fries which are above average but not the best I've had in the city. \n\nAlthough the food was a tad disappointing, the place was furnished tastefully, lots of white and wood, like how I would want my home to look like.

It's an explosion of flavors! :0  and having a mound of shredded lamb leg meat will fill you up fast. \n\nDon't skip the crunchy Greek fries with a sprinkling of Mizithra cheese nor their delicious dessert.

However, being an avid froyo/ice cream lover, my expectations weren't too high. \n\nI ordered the chicken sandwich which was heavily drenched with olive oil. It was kind of a struggle to eat my wrap since it got oily, but I guess that was the point? I also felt like the chicken thigh meat could have been juicier. But my boyfriend enjoyed his lamb sandwich. We also got the roasted potatoes, which was swimming in a pool of olive oil as well. Wasn't bad with their house-made hot sauce though. Although in all honesty, we probably should've gotten the fries instead.\n\nTHUMBS UP for the cute outside patio! Minimalistic design with a cozy feel, while the mini heaters kept us nice and warm amidst the windy SF weather. \n\nLast but not least, that yogurt ... man. Exceeded my expectations without a doubt.

The salad was bright, flavorful, and the chicken was so tender and juicy. I loved the fennel with orange as well. I have a hard time envisioning this one in gyro form, but for a salad it was awesome. Same for the fries, they were really flavorful and perfectly crispy. \n\nCouldn't leave without getting a frozen greek yogurt.

The lettuce remained crisp despite the warm sweet potato and toasty lamb pieces (I hope your mouth is watering).  There were so many fun surprises in the salad including walnuts, olives and feta cheese. \n\nLibations:\n\nI guzzled up my house red wine - it was delectable.  My friends greatly enjoyed the ros\u00e9.  You can either get a large 250 mL, 500 mL or a bottle. \n\nDessert:\n\n'Cause let's be honest, this is what we have all been waiting for- the greek yogurt with house baklava is phenomenal. My mouth was overwhelmed by this level of pure deliciousness. A solid mix of slightly tart greek frozen yogurt (consistency of soft serve) and a warm sticky muddled blend of baklava. My heart is content...for now.\n\nStop by if you haven't yet and get your Greek on!", "author": "Ali B."}

This new location on Divisadero is nearly identical in food quality and interior design to the first, and offers the same streamlined menu.  The seating layout in this location is about the only change with various sized tables throughout and patio seating in the back.  \n\nI'm a massive fan of their chicken salad / wrap as well as the Greek frozen yogurt (all variations).  The fact that you can get a glass, carafe, or bottle of wine relatively inexpensively is only icing on the proverbial cake (mmmmmm, cake!)\n\nOverall, Soulva is the bomb - a fast casual greek restaurant that serves consistently good food (plus you can watch the meat cook before your eyes).

I ordered the lamb salad and it was so refreshing, with the pickled red onions and the ample lamb hiding under the salad.  The fries were crispy and the sandwiches were really substantial and reminded me of kebabs.  Everything was served on matching white and blue trimmed metal dishes.

I try to bring all of my visitors here - all have loved it as much as I do.\n\n\nMust Try: The Lamb Salad\nThis is my favorite salad in the entire world. It's the only salad I crave drunkenly - I usually want to drunk eat pizza, tacos, etc., but this is just that good. If you eat meat, even if you're not usually a lamb person, you need to try this salad. The dressing (just the right level of creamy), kale, pickled onions, cheese and perfect sized slices of perfectly grilled lamb combine to create the most incredible taste experience. I also think that for $14, while not cheap, you're getting a great deal for San Francisco. This salad, which is super generous with the lamb and depending on how hungry you are could be 1 or 2 meals, would be like $25 at Blue Barn. \n\nOther awesome food:\n*The fries are GREAT. Recommend sharing with a friend.\n*The frozen greek yogurt is delicious, especially with the baklava and honey. I always lament the fact that I don't have the appetite to get one after finishing my salad. Worth a trip just for this as a snack.\n*The breakfast sandwich, offered until 2pm on weekends, is SO GOOD. I tried it with the lamb that I love so much and was so excited about how good it tasted. \n\nThings to note:\n*The Divis location has a lovely patio with heat lamps.\n*The line moves pretty quickly.\n*You can order wine here in several different sizes - the 500mL is perfect for when you're sharing with a friend but don't quite want an entire bottle.\n*If you're with more than like 4 people, it might be tough to find seating.\n*Sometimes they offer a brined whole chicken that serves ~4 people.

And I think that the flavors of the cheese, dressing, radishes, and onions are way stronger and more complementary when they're not disguised by the bread.

They also offer a couple sides, a surprising selection of Greek wines, and of course, frozen Greek yogurt!\n\nI came here for lunch on a Sunday, and the one issue we had when entering the small restaurant was the noise--it was fairly difficult to find a good place to sit that made it easy to talk, and the tall chairs weren't very comfortable. The food, however, was definitely quality and on-point. I got to try the lamb sandwich, which was cubes of lamb leg wrapped in pita with a yogurt sauce, feta cheese, and pickled vegetables. The lamb reminded me of gyro and was tasty, and the meat-to-everything-else ratio was definitely generous. The avgolemono soup, made with rice, chicken, egg, and lemon was nice as well--definitely strong on the lemony flavor, but a little expensive for what it was. Finally, I got to try the chicken salad, which was my favorite. The chicken was so juicy and succulent, and the salad (which included fennel, kale, onion, orange) was simple and tasty--it went perfectly with the olive oil and the yogurt-based dressings.\n\nFinally, we had to get the frozen Greek yogurt--we tried the sour cherry syrup, the greek olive oil & sea salt, and the baklava crumble, and each of these was delicious. The yogurt itself was light yet creamy and balanced between sweet/sour, and each of the different toppings played together very nicely with the yogurt.

We ordered the vegetarian salad and the lamb leg salad. \n\nOur bowls were vibrant with color and generous servings of vegetables and lamb meat. Definitely a step up from the lamb salad experience I had at Souvla on Hayes. The lamb here were in visible cubes rather than shredded dry bits. \n\nThis location is larger with a sweet patio in the back. There is a large family table, some bar setting and high 2 person high tables along the back. Beware if you sit under the tree, there are many ants that occasionally fall from the trees. Great place to sit if you enjoy the extra protein in your salad and your hair. \n\nOverall: \nFood/ drinks: 5/5 for salad bowls. \n\nService: 3/5 - hard to rate service for a place that has no service. Everything is self serve here. The pro about this location is that we didn't feel rushed to leave. \n\nEnvironment: 4/5- great decor, free wifi and self seating, self water service, clean the tables yourself, however music is still a little louder than what's comfortable to have a conversation in.", "author": "Janice K."}

(Granted, none of them are on Divisadero.) I'm guessing these people account for most of the positive reviews.\n\nThe food was fine, but has nothing to do with Greek or Mediterranean cuisine. Tzatziki sauce? This \"Greek\" restaurant called \"Souvla\" has apparently never heard of it. This is typical California \"fusion\", novel but I wouldn't call it delicious, especially to those of us familiar with actual Greek cuisine. And certainly not worth anything like what they charge for it. Everything on the menu is about priced about 40% higher than it should be.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-05-23", "description": "Inconsistent. I've had amazing food from here, and I've also had very mediocre food. However, lately it's been trending more towards mediocre/poor. Used to always get wraps, and over the past few months started getting the whole rotisserie chickens. The chickens were fantastic for the first five I got. The last four have been either dried out, burned, the last one I had was bloody. As far as the wraps go the meat is so inconsistent, but as of late just dried out, smaller portions. Sometimes you get harissa yogurt, sometimes you don't. Sometimes the meat is moist, sometimes it's just swimming in a boatload of oil. I truly just think they've expanded too rapidly and they don't have enough oversight in the kitchens when they get busy. It's just guys literally throwing things together without any care or consideration for the final product. I normally don't review, but after spending 30+ dollars on two wraps that were skimpy on everything, and the meat was completely dried out, I can't justify returning. Truly disappointing because I used to love the place, however every time I go in now it's a gamble whether you get a good product or not. Never really write reviews and I work in the industry but just had to express my displeasure. I have even mentioned the inconsistency issues with the chef, and he seemed very concerned. However being concerned is one thing, and actually practicing what you preach is another. I'm sure they will continue to be incredibly successful because most people don't really care, but you should save your money and go elsewhere. For the same money you can get amazing food from ragazza or namu stonepot. Also just realized my lamb sandwich didn't even have any of the pickled onions on it last night, there's like five ingredients in the sandwich.

It's a little closer to home, and while parking STILL isn't the best, we manage.\n\nMy favorite salad is hands down (not just at Soulva, but my favorite salad in general) is their Mary's Free-Range Chicken Salad.  The flavorful chicken and the sweetness of the Navel Orange?  Yum!\n\nI also love their Greek Fries.  We always add the Harissa spiked yogurt dipping sauce.  Adds a little extra kick to the fries.\n\nThis location is much bigger than the Hayes Valley one and we always manage to find a seat.  You can order online and pick up.

The food is great just like the original location and I like that the new space has more room.\n\nMy only gripe is the layout.  It's really confusing when you enter the restaurant.  A long narrow hallway connects the two parts of the restaurant.  The ordering area is crammed in this hallway so it creates a bottleneck quickly.\n\nOverall, highly recommend this place.", "author": "JD R."}

The back patio is absolutely beautiful with the twinkley lights, and it feels a little more spacious than the other location. Not too fancy, but not too casual-- it's the perfect in between place.

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. can you imagine if he had swallowed the bone and it lodged in his throat? this is purely bad quality control on the restaurant's end and you really NEED TO be more thorough with deboning and shredding your meats. SCARY!\n\nall in all, it was such a let down, would've given a 1 star, but another star goes to the friendly service staff with smiles on their faces. all in all, horrible food and will not return to to location.", "author": "Joyce C."}

I liked the chicken sandwich and the fries the first time I visited this place. I went back shortly after because I went to a work get together there and I had the potato salad.The potato salad was really good and I'm not even vegetarian. You will have to like sweet potatoes though--if you don't like sweet potato, you will not like the salad. Besides the yummy sweet potatoes, their dressing is soo good, I will have to try to look of the recipe and make it myself because this place is far from where I live. There is also kale and pickled onions and other stuff. Their salad portion is big, you will leave full/ satisfied if you order one. A must try! I'll have to try the other salads next time.

I absolutely love Greek cuisine and healthy food to boot so this should be my dream match .  However after several visits, I am still not thrilled.  I tried the veggie salad and pork salad 2 times AND the lamb sandwich. I chalk this up to the fact that I really do not like overwhelming amounts of fat in my meat, which I think some people do.  This isn't a sarcastic comment - I know people do.  I even read another comment which talked about how they LOVE the fattiness of the pork.  I, however, prefer actual meat. Further, the prices are a bit steep.  Tonight I ordered a salad for me, sandwich for my husband and side of fries and it was $35.  Yikes.  That said, because I really want to love it....I think I will give it one more try and try the chicken.

I used to always go to the one in Hayes Valley when it first opened up a few years ago. I've moved closer to the Nopa location, so I walked over and ordered the Chicken Salad (my favorite!) to go. \nThey brought me my order promptly... they were about to close, so I'm guessing he kitchen was working hard to get orders out quick. I do appreciate the speedy turnaround, and said so to the guy who delivered my food. But when I looked down at the box, and it was marked \"lamb sandwich\"... so I stopped the guy who gave it to me and told him I thought it was the wrong order. He told me, \"no, that's a chicken salad, we just reused the box.\" Um, okay? The box honestly looked a little dinged up, and in hindsight, I wish I'd asked for a fresh one. But, I took out my reuse-able bag and charged onward. \nI think they've changed their recipe for the yogurt dressing to be less yogurt and more olive oil. By the time I got to eat my salad, it tasted far more bland than I remember... of course, that may be because by the time I'd walked the few blocks back home, the gently used box had come apart at the seams and my dinner was pouring out of the box into a pool of olive oil in my bag. \nThe whole experience was disappointing. I used to really like that place. Please don't cut corners on that delicious yogurt dressing. Please only use boxes once. \nI'm still giving 2 stars bc I like that they use organic chicken.

Went to check it out recently and was struck by how much roomier it is than the Hayes location. Nice outdoor seating area both in front on the sidewalk as well as in the back patio (although it was closed when we went because they were installing heat lamps). The inside has some large communal tables in the front and some 4-person high tops along a narrow hallway towards the back. Menu is more or less the same as the Hayes place. Try the lamb wrap, fries and garlicky Greek yogurt dressing. And don't forget the Greek froyo for dessert! My only complaint is that we (a group of 4) had to stand around for 10-15 minutes waiting for a table after placing our order, and there were several groups of 2 lingering at the 4-person tables long after their plates had been cleared. On the flip side, service is fast - our orders were ready while we were still standing and waiting for a table! In short, I'd definitely come back here for a date night or get-together with friends, although I might come at an off-hour to avoid the dinner rush.", "author": "J L."}
