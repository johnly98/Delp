Only the curry was good), chicken tikka massala (since thing, meat was tough so I only soaked up the curry), and the bindhi curry (which was good, wish it was crispy). The garlic naan was yummy and much better than the parantha (too stuffed). \n\nDrinks: the Yeti tequila cocktail was good.\n\nAmbiance: It's a pretty large space which is rare for SF so thats nice to actually have some ample space to eat.

The staff were lovely and took the time to explain the restaurant and their history. The place was almost empty when my partner and I stopped in for lunch but don't let the lack of crowd trick you into thinking the food isn't great. They had some great cocktails on the menu and the bar was modern looking but it was too early to imbibe.\n\nThe food was excellent and the menu offered enough variety to keep even the pickiest eaters happy. The server made some great recommendations for dishes that go well together or are best for sharing. She deserves a lot of credit for this. I was a big fan of the Samosas ($8) which is served with some Tarkari and spicy sauces. I also liked the okra ($14) as it had more of a fresh, acidic taste to balance out all of the savory, warming flavors of the other dishes. The selection of meatless options was also a huge plus about the menu.\n\nOverall, this place offers some great food, served by great people, in a great atmosphere. The assortment of Nepali pop music was a great scene setter as well. My only regret is not coming late enough in the day to enjoy some of the cocktails. I would gladly come back despite the fact there was no yak and no dancing.", "author": "Patrick G."}

I highly recommend sharing family style. \n\n- Chicken MOMO and Veggie MOMO - Both chicken and veggie MOMO were delicious. If you don't know what Momo is, it is essentially a dumpling. They give you a side of hot sauce to go with these dumplings and the hot sauce is extremely spicy. I repeat, extremely spicy. Just a dab will send your tongue to a different dimension. Use with caution. \n\n- Butter chicken - This dish is the most amazing thing ever. The flavor was just intoxicating and the chicken was so soft and tender. Order a side of paratha to dip the sauce into for the perfect bite.  \n\n- Tandoori Plate (veggie and chicken) - This dish comprises of turmeric rice, mixed green salad, oven roasted vegetables, and chicken. I thought the dish was good, but not the most amazing among our order. The buttered chicken definitely beats this tandoori chicken. \n\n- Bhindi tarkari - This one is fried okra saut\u00e9ed with onions, ginger, and garlic. If you like okra, this is a must try. It's one of their more popular vegetarian dishes. \n\n- Paulingo saag ray paneer - A big fan of this chopped spinach cooked with cumin and coriander on top of paneer. If you haven't had it, paneer cheese is just so good!\n\n- Garlic naan - I was not much of a fan of their naan. I like crispy naan, and this one just wasn't crispy at all. I recommend the paratha as a substitute.\n\n- Rose Lemonade - If you are looking for a nonalcoholic drink, this is the one to get. I typically don't like rose flavored anything, but I enjoyed this particular drink.", "author": "Julia K."}

It's good for a romantic date. \n\nI personally haven't heard of many Himalayan/Nepali restaurants in SF, but this one exceeded expectations! The menu has lots of options for fried appetizers, \"Daal Bhat Thali\" which includes curry, lentils, veggies, sides, tandoori plates and curries. They have buckwheat roti here - which is gluten free! They also have lots of vegan and plant based options too.\n\nI wasn't feeling particularly hungry so I went with an appetizer, salad and roti. My friend got curry and the portions looked huge. The service was a little hit and miss. At times, it was really hard to reach out to our waiter. The Chicken Momo seemed popular here.\n\nBara ($8) - Black lentil puree patty mixed with ginger. Served with chicken gravy. So so good! \n\nBeet Salad ($14) - Roasted beets, arugula, kaffir cheese, krispy naan and sherry vinaigrette. The layout was a little weird for this dish since it came on a slim vertical plate. I found this a bit expensive for what you got.\n\nFaphar ko Roti (Buckwheat) ($3) - Super delicious and a lot larger than I expected.\n\nI'd love to come back to try their curry or thali dish.

They double as Nepalese travel advisors! So talk to them if you're interested.\n\nWOW. Buckle in because this review is going to be LONG.\n\nIf y'all haven't noticed, the Nepalese culinary game in San Francisco is FIERCE. Dancing Yak is a new face, only opening in May of this year, but they're already making their mark. As we approached the restaurant, a local to the neighborhood noticed us walking over there and remarked that it's her favorite restaurant here.\n\nThe vibe when you walk in is chill and modern--they play trippy atmospheric music and the walls are decorated with psychedelic mushroom paintings and other such art. The servers are genuine and friendly. \n\nI'll start with the cocktail menu. They have an assortment of traditional cocktails with Nepalese/Indian flavors. In particular, I loved the 'Avalanche on Everest', a mango lassi with vodka and rose water--tart, fruity, and ever so slight hint of creaminess. I also liked the 'Cheers! To Progressing Nepal', a cocktail with arak and mint lemonade (if you like anise flavor, you'll love this). They have tons of other stuff I didn't get to try, like a bourbon and chai drink. But you should totally try it and let me know how it is!\n\nTheir menu is lovely. They've got unique dishes while still paying homage to the very traditional dhal baat and momo, and some Indian favorites as well. They have an a la carte curry menu, which I liked. Again, some unique dishes and some common favorites. We went for the pork belly, which was crispy and fork tender and had such a unique flavor. We also tried the saucy lollipops--big, succulent pieces of fried chicken with a very mildly spicy sauce. For our entrees, we went for the thali with lamb curry (the lamb was scrumptious) and the butter chicken, which was probably the most tender chicken I've ever had, and the sauce was amazing too. \n\nDessert somehow also made an appearance--the kulfi (we got mango) is delicious and tastes like frozen lassi. We also got the pudding with almonds, but I wasn't very much a fan of that, I think because of just personal preference. It has the same texture as like a pudding made with ricotta cheese. It was still good, but not my kind of thing. They also have dessert that most Indian restaurants have too, like kheer and gulab jamun.\n\nTo top it all off, they give you a Nepali postcard with your check. On the back, you'll find tips and other info about traveling to Nepal, and they encourage you to reach out to them if you want to know more. To be honest, I'm very familiar with Nepali culture, and this is one of my favorite things about every Nepalese person I've ever met--they are proud of their culture in such an endearing and pure way. Nepalese people welcome everyone and are some of the most hospitable hosts you'll ever have. So let them introduce you to this wonderful, wild, and unique culture. You won't regret it! :)\n\nWay to go, Dancing Yak, for being an outstanding representative of Nepal and its culture.", "author": "Claire C."}

We just missed happy hour by a few minutes but nevertheless, I still wanted dinner. The interior and inside is great and spacious, with a couch/lounge area as the waiting area. Service was great but the kitchen overall was a little slow (took a while for the food to be brought out). Food is on the pricey side (ends up being ~18+ per dish as you would want to add a side of rice or naan to go with your sauce meat).\n\nFor food, I got the cashew chicken with garlic naan and the lamb patty skewers.  The naan was probably my favorite piece of the whole night, buttery and generous with garlic gloves. The cashew chicken was also super buttery and delicious. For the lamb patty skewers, we got it with the combo that came with roasted vegetables, salad, and rice. The rice was flavored and good. Not a big fan of the roasted vegetables, they were coated with some sauce and it was a little too overpowering. The skewers were good and I enjoyed the yogurt sauce that came with it. \n\n Overall, the food was good but not my favorite Nepalese restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place for a date night or something similar-- since they have a full bar and the extra time for the food is great for talking with your date. Otherwise, there are cheaper and better options in the city.", "author": "Jenny N."}

We squeezed into one of the comfortable booths and ordered the daal bhat thali with goat curry and chicken momos. The waitress was really helpful in describing the dishes and also told us we could request more spiciness. \n\nLike I mentioned, the momos are an inferior dumpling. The skin is really thick, and you have to rely on the sauce to give it flavor. The meat inside was nice and soupy, The daal bhat thali is definitely a plate meant for two! There was so much on there, from the goat curry to the lentil stew, rice, and cauliflower. The flavor of the veggies were really muted, and the pickled stuff was super sharp and sour. The lentils are hearty but also slightly blander.

It's by no means unheard of cuisine around these parts, but definitely unrepresented compared to something like Indian.  The menu has some familiar favorites (e.g. momos) as well as some things I haven't seen before (e.g. bara).\n\nBara: This was pretty tasty.  Reminded me of an uttapam, but a tad crispier on the outside and tad pastier on the inside.  Came with some chicken curry gravy, which paired just perfectly as a dip.\n\nChicken Curry Daal Bhat Thali: I couldn't commit to just one dish, so got the thali for variety.  The chicken curry had the same sauce as was paired with the Bara, but this time there was a bunch of tender chicken pieces.  Went nicely with fluffy rice.  The main veggies were cauliflower and potato in a drier curry (as opposed to the soupy chicken curry).  Lots of black lentils, which were so hearty they could be a meal unto themselves.  I found that sprinkling some of the fried potato sticks on top of the lentils was a great texture combo.  The papadum came in cute cones and added a nice crunch between curry bites.  Wasn't a big fan of the pile of greens; definitely the least flavorful, but I got full on everything else so no big deal.\n\nTropical Fruit Iced Tea: Unsweetened.  Very subtle fruit essence.

We finally resolved to explore the relatively new and scantily reviewed Dancing Yak, where we immediately got a table for two with no problem. The d\u00e9cor and paintings included vibrant purples and blues in an intriguing way, and we found ourselves among numerous couples on date night. \n\nOur eyes were without a doubt larger than our stomachs at this point, and we ordered all of chicken momos, dal, a classic Nepalese chicken curry, naan, and buckwheat pancakes. Momos are always a popular appetizer, but I actually could've done without them as the curries and breads were very flavorful more satisfying. My favorite item of the night was the buckwheat pancakes, made from oily and more mealy dark batter. While the food hit the spot, the service was spotty, as we had to put in a great deal of effort to flag down wait staff even though we were right in front of the restaurant and along the route from the kitchen to the majority of diners. Every time we did manage to hail a server, they sometimes appeared confused since they were not necessarily \"our\" server. They may have been getting their operations in order as a newer establishment. Most importantly, the food is hot and tasty and the portions large for an upscale restaurant. We packed up leftovers so our gluttony did not go to waste. The thing with Indian food is that one can easily find authentic offerings for cheap in the Bay Area, but Dancing Yak would be a fitting choice if you are craving these comforting spices but would like a classier environment.", "author": "Amy G."}

I prayed more in my late 20s than the 8 years in Catholic School. =/\n\nSo, when I read about the opening of Dancing Yak, I initially thought it was a nightclub. Then, I realized it's the restaurant that took over Babu Ji, Nostra, Plin, Another Money, and Conduit. In the last 5 years, no restaurant has lasted more than year in this space so hopefully Dancing Yak will turn that around?\n\nDancing Yak serves Nepalese fare and they have a full bar which is always a huge plus. They're currently in soft opening mode with a grand opening this Friday, May 4th. For now, they have a full menu for lunch and dinner with a plethora of apps, soups, salads, tandoori, curry, and thali. Based on customer feedback, they will shorten the menu so it's more focused and concise.\n\nWhile perusing the menu, we were brought a Complimentary Nepali Snack of savory rice crispies: https://bit.ly/2I4cDZ7. \n\nMy co-worker and I started with an obligatory order of Chicken Momo: Nepali dumplings w/ minced chicken, chives, garlic, spices, tomato sauce (8 pc - $13): https://bit.ly/2FBem2C. They were decent, though the spices were too muted for us (needed more ginger, garlic, and turmeric) and reminded us more of Chinese dumplings. The accompanying tomato sauce needed more oomph too. We were also brought a side of their housemade hot sauce which helped amp up the flavor. \n\nWe also ordered the Pork Bhutwa appetizer w/ chili powder, garlic-ginger paste ($12): https://bit.ly/2JMreW2. The menu says, it's a pork belly cut but customers complained that it was too fatty (umm, fat = flavor!) so they changed it to a lean loin cut. It was very tough and dry but the flavor was good. My co-worker said, it reminded her of her grandma's pork adobo. \n\nFor a shared entr\u00e9e, we shared the Salmon Caju w/ cashew nut cream sauce ($22), Garlic Naan ($3.50), Basmati Rice ($3): https://bit.ly/2HHjic5.\n\nI'm not a fan of cooked fish because most places tend to overcook fish it. However, my co-worker wanted fish so we compromised and asked the owner if we can do the caju curry with the salmon. She said, yes so I appreciate the accommodation. As suspected, the salmon was overcooked and dry BUT the deliciously rich, cashew cream sauce gave it much needed moisture and saved the dish. \n\nThe garlic naan was fresh out of the oven - hot, soft, and fluffy with a nice garlickyness. The basmati was perfectly cooked with nicely separated grains. Both the naan and rice were great vessel for sopping up all the caju curry. \n\nService was fantastic. The owner was the only one manning the FOH - engaging with customers and soliciting feedback. We were honest and told her what we liked and didn't like. She did comp the pork dish since the menu stated that it was pork belly but it wasn't. She overheard my co-worker talking about Indian ice cream and brought us out a sample of the pistachio kulfi which so good - creamy, nutty, and not overly sweet. \n\nDancing Yak has a huge, festive space that can accommodate over 150+ people and even has a private dining area. The bar seems like a great place for happy hour (they will have HH specials) and there's a corner \"living room\" area which is good for people watching while sipping on a cocktail. \n\nCurrently, Dancing Yak's food is at 3-3.25 stars (the spices are too tamed IMO but that's what they may be going for) but rounding up to 4 stars since they're in soft opening mode and I'm confident they'll evolve in the coming months.

I'm a huge fan of Nepalese food so I went in with certain expectations in mind, but also with a relaxed set of expectations given the soft opening. This place sets itself apart from other Nepali restaurants in the area given the more upscale feel/service and vibrant/colorful artwork hanging on every wall. Very cool vibes. If you've never had Nepalese food, you must come here and try it.\n\nThe cocktail bar was not yet opened so I'll be sure to update my review when I visit Dancing Yak after they officially open. They definitely had some kinks to sort out when it comes to service, but the food more than spoke for itself and I'm excited to see how this restaurant grows in a district ripe with excellent dining options. \n\nFor starters, we ordered the Vegetarian Momos (Nepalese dumplings) and the Bara (lentil patty). The momos were excellent!! I often find veg momos to be lacking in flavor when compared to their chicken counterparts, but these were packed with flavor and delicious veggies. And the skin was perfectly thin and not overly doughy, which is something I often find. The tomato-based sauce/chutney that came with it was equally delicious and savory. I would highly highly recommend ordering a set of momos when you come here. Will update this review when I try the chicken momos, but I'm sure they will be just as good. The Bara was super unique, in a great way! It is a lentil patty packed with subtle flavor (ginger in particular) and reminded me of something I used to eat at home - very warm and welcoming food. \n\nFor our main, we decided to check out the Dal Bhaat Thali platter, with fish curry. Thalis are a traditionally Indian/Nepali platter where you get to try a few dishes in smaller portions. It's a ton of fun to share these. This thali just reminded me of home - each dish was light and flavorful, and came with papad (like an Indian chip) that paired well texture-wise with the small dishes. The Daal Bhaat (black lentils dish) was very tasty. The seasonal vegetable dish was a cauliflower dish. It tasted just like how my mom makes it. But my favorite dish on the platter was definitely the fish curry - perfectly cooked, flaky fish, dipped in a delicious tomato-based curry. All too often, Nepali and Indian restaurants will serve curries doused in cream and they end up being too heavy, but Dancing Yak hit all the right notes :). \n\nWe ordered Naan on the side and boy was it goood! It was just so soft/pillowy and came fresh out of the oven. I couldn't stop eating it. \n\nThe server offered us complimentary dessert so we split a mango kulfi (ice cream) and a dish of rice noodles in a subtly sweet milk-based sauce with notes of cardamom. Both were tasty! The kulfi was definitely on the sweet side, while the other dish was more subtle.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the experience at Dancing Yak and cant wait to try new things (cocktails included) and update my review once they have stabilized a bit :). I wish them the best of luck with this awesome endeavor! The Mission was lacking an authentic, swanky Nepalese dining option.", "author": "Sabina S."}

The goat curry was pretty standard, and the naan and roti were both good as well. But the Khichidi really stood out. A pleasing mash of rice, lentils, and cauliflower (probably more?) with some bits creamy, some bits fried and crunchy, basically stole the show.

The flavors are subtly different from Indian and so delicious. I'd highly recommend the salt lassi with Himalayan salt and the chicken chili and chicken momos - staple dishes of Nepal and some of the best I've had. I've also tried the thali, paneer salad, chicken biryani, Kheer and gulab jamun - all delicious. The bar food at happy hour is equally good. I so appreciate the authenticity - in a sea of North and South Indian choices that tailor to American taste, this food stands out and is refreshingly different. \n\nLastly, let's acknowledge the lovely hospitality.

There's a whole long list of curries to try ranging including veggie-forward to meaty. The flavors are are on the mild/subtle side compared to what you might expect when you think of 'curries' - but in no way are bland or uninteresting. \n\nWe actually came on a lark one night with our baby daughter, then came back the next night with my parents!  We got to vegetable MOMOs both times (8 dumplings with tasty mix of not-crunchy not-gooey just-right veggies inside, plus a tasty medium-spicy sauce).  Later, we followed with the tandoor plate (minced lamb was fab), and a few curries. Of the curries, the butter chicken is a more tomato-red than you may expect (which is great! It's distinct from 'normal' butter chicken), the okra was saut\u00e9ed and had a roasted feel with some of the stringyness of okra but without the gooey consistency of most okra dishes. The eggplant curry was a scoopable consistency that you could easily spread over Naan or eat in small or big bites. We complemented it with garlic naan - which was perfectly crispy soft with generous but not overwhelming garlic. \n\nThe cocktails were interesting and fine (we got the two made with allspice dram - 'Honey Hunter from Nepal' and 'Don't Talk Yak').. but not fantastic.  Something about the balance of flavors and ingredients. (I finished about half of mine). Perhaps these will get tweaked and improved over time. \n\nDancing Yak recently opened up, so if you're looking for a no-wait kind of place with different and good food, this is great choice.

When we went out last night, our party of 3 was headed to a different restaurant but their wait was too long-so we went walking and decided to spontaneously try Nepali food. IM SO GLAD WE DID! \n\nWe had rose lemonade for a beverage, so refreshing and vegetable Momo to Start. They were delightful dumplings in a spicy curry sauce. Great portion and very flavorful.\n\nThen we had the curry okra and vegetable Bhandi. Everything was shareable, interactive and cooked lovely. I do wish the waiter told us what each thing on the Bhandi was when it was set down.

It's not as heavy as Indian which is also great.\n\nSecond, there were some new unique flavors that I hadn't tasted before that really impressed me. I think a chefs duty is to bring new exotic tastes to the customer to tickle their tastebuds and that's exactly what Dancing Yak did.\n\nThird, the restaurant experience was great. The decor was pleasing and painstakingly chosen down to the wax lotus leaf candle holders. The boss lady had great recommendations and was passionate about the food. She's also really pretty and has some smoking hot tatts on her leg. She is like exactly what I would imagine as a restaurant boss - strong, opinionated with lots of life stories.\n\nWe had the chicken moma and dhal bhat thali recommended by the boss lady.

The staff were helpful, almost too helpful (we had been asked 3-4 times before the food was served if we needed anything). Unfortunately the food wasn't overly good. I ordered the chicken tandoori meal. The amount of food on the plate was not as much as I hoped for, a very small amount of rice and salad along with 4 pieces of chicken. The chicken was not good, overly dry as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. \n\nBased on that I likely won't be returning. I still ate the food and wasn't full :( \nI actually ate again when I got home 20 minutes later.

It has a nice ambience with colorful art on the wall and decorations.  The restaurant is family-owned with family members managing the restaurant and serving.  I've always found the service excellent and friendly.  \n\nMy favorite dishes are the Butter Chicken and Daal Baat Thali.  Butter Chicken is prepared well and has a rich sauce that's addicting.  The Daal Baat Thali comes with a few different foods such as lentils, rice, and vegetable sides.  You choose the meat and usually I order the Chicken Curry.  It's nice because it has variety; so you can get different kinds of food even if you order one dish.\n\nYak has a fair number of people in the evenings, but at lunchtime, there's still many open tables.  I hope Mission folk patronize this place for lunch more because we need more restaurants staying open for lunch.  The restaurant in the same location that preceded Yak (Bhabu Ji) wasn't open for lunch.  Pauline's and Tawla which are nearby are also closed for lunch. \n\nThe music here is also really good even if I can't place what genre it is; it sounds like a fusion between Indian or Nepalese music and Western.  Its music taste rivals that of Burma Love, which is right across the road.  Which brings me to a comparison.  Having lived in this part of the Mission for a year, and close to BL, I've gone there usually twice a week.  Obviously I like Burma Love to go there that often, but I also find that the dishes there often taste alike.  It's also gotten to be really crowded all times of the day.  Dancing Yak has as similar ambience, more consistently good service, and in my opinion, the food tastes better.", "author": "Bob C."}

I understand it's hard to flip on a dime when your restaurant becomes hot. But the seriously prolonged waits for even cocktails is a problem. Much delay can be forgiven if a good cocktail is in hand. The key is IN HAND!\n\nCocktails are about a B-   There's not much creativity demanded for vodka based concoctions, and there were a lot of those on the menu. The riff on an old fashioned lacked Peychaud's butters and was consequently a bit plain, even with the slight kick from the pepper infused bourbon. My mezcal based cocktail was pretty good (a solid B), with some interesting flavors, but not an awesome marriage of flavors. \n\nThe wine list was A+. Delicious!\n\nFood was a solid B. Great presentation, well prepared, and fairly tasty. But nothing extraordinarily compared to other prices. However pricing is a A, so this place is a solid value. \n\nThe interior looks recycled and amateurishly designed. Except the bathrooms, those are great. Except how much dinner time do you spend there?!?\n\nSo we enjoyed our experience for the most part, minus the gross delays especially for the cocktails. For reference we spent over two hours here for a 1 hour meal. We are not at Atelier Crenn here!\n\nNOTE: after the first version of this review posted, which posted before we left the restaurant, the owner thanked us for the review and responded to the service by significantly reducing our bill, which was already very reasonable. We love owners who appreciate our reviews, even if they aren't stellar reviews without critiques.

I also didn't think that the projected video of various nature night sky scenes added much.\n\nInstead of bringing my appetizer and entree, they brought the appetizer twice.

I'm naturally very picky when it comes to Nepali food anywhere and today I was really impressed by the Dancing Yak.\n\nWhat tends to happen at a lot of Nepali restaurants is that the cuisine gets diluted by the Indian options on the menu. As a result, most places focus on making the popular items like butter chicken tasty and don't pay attention to their Momo's. \nI don't think you can call yourself Nepali restaurant w/o paying attention to the staple that everyone who knows the cuisine will expect. The chicken momo at Dancing Yak is great (I would hope that they make a few adjustments to the dough to make it even better) but the MOMO SAUCE is amazing. So simple and has a great kick, I inhaled the Momos today. \nI also had the dal bhat set, and all its components were awesome. Simple and done well, didn't overcompensate for flavor by making it heavy and greasy. And this is why I was impressed. Most Nepali restaurants that I've been to in the US try to do the most, this restaurant keeps it casual and keeps the prices reasonable. I felt like I was eating home cooking. Thank you.\n\nI gave a 4-star for now, because I think there's some improvement to be made.

The mojo sauce was a bit bland but seemed to have perked up the next day hen we reheated it.  The Curry Burry was soup like with only a bit of cauliflower in it. We saved the sauce for tonight's curry burry with shrimp. The Baigan Ko Tarkari (eggplant) was devine  Garlin Nan great. We also got the minced lamb tandoori plate.

Now.\n\nWe went a couple of days ago and are heading back soon.  \nWe enjoyed veggie momos  and pakoda for apps.  The momos were better than any we had in Kathmandu.  They were soft but still firm with deliciously shredded veggie innards.  The pakodas had a tamarind sauce as well as a fresh mint sauce.  Both sauces were great, but the mint was sublime, sooo fresh.  (I'm ordering delivery tonight and getting a few orders of momos.)\nFor dinner we had veggie Daal Bhat Thai and garlic naan.  Soo fresh and yummy.  Each little bowl was better than the last.  Of the three bowls the lentil one was my favorite, but it really was a three way tie.\nSo the food was great to say the least. \nOur server was fast and friendly and was there when needed, but never hovered.  And the hostess was wonderful, chatting us up about out trips to Nepal and her family.  Just what we needed a little trip to Thamel, but only a block away.\n\nOh!  and we got a mango/coconut milk ice cream pop with the check.\nYES!!!!!!!   \nNow, you need to go there, NOW.", "author": "Chester T."}

Pork belly is so homely made, perfectly spiced, pieces are lil bigger they could go slightly smaller. Bara is must try which is our Nepali version of gluten free pan cake. they served with gravy which is nice...again I would prefer thick gray so I can dip.

The flavors of each were perfectly balanced and beautifully spiced. After, our server surprised us with a delicately flavored and fragrant iced milk with a pistachio crust, a perfect way to finish our meal at the first Dancing Yak.

That's about it. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks and longer for food. A free snack of rice crispies and papadum arrived. Then appetizer  of momos was super salty and rubbery. Mains were delivered without spoons with one dish missing. I could see discussion between server and cooks about the missing dish...confusion reigned. The couple next to us sent their food back to the kitchen. The final dish arrived after we were almost finished with the other dishes and full. Slow staff or too few staff, many of them looping around as I watched to make eye contact. Asking for something sent the staff to the kitchen to forget and start serving someone else.

We settled on a Nepali place after seeing a tiny sign on the sidewalk with a humorous name: Dancing Yak. It wasn't busy, but it looked fine, so we took a chance. So glad we did! We had our fill of delicious food and warm service. The server and manager were helpful and seemed happy to tell us about Nepalese food. We had the Dal Makhni, Pork Curry with Bok Choy and the Goat Curry meal. Everything was absolutely delicious, including the puffed rice snack and the garlic naan. My wife loved the chai. Come to find they had only been open for five days. I hope they keep up the quality of the food and the friendly service.
