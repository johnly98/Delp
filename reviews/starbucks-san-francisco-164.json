For a Starbucks, this place exceeds my expectations.\n\nThe first thing you notice about this Starbucks is the layout. The building has a wide entrance door and a very long interior. The inside has almost a \"hallway\" feel - it occupies more square feet than most Starbucks I've been to in the city. They often have some good hip-hop, R&B, and 80s pop music playing in the background. I was very happy to hear Stevie Wonder and Kool and the Gang being played here.\n\nThe couch is very comfortable to sit on and work for hours. I've never found seating to be a problem here. Besides the music, background noise leans towards the quiet. I haven't ordered anything custom here, but I had no issues with the drinks I have ordered.

But rather than doing that, I remembered there's a Starbucks where I could replenish a pound of coffee I need to get anyway.\n\nSo I get there, and look for someone to ask to use the restroom. The employee stocking an area behind the cash wrap is way too busy to respond to me saying, \"excuse me\" and the barista wearing warriors gear rudely tells me once I purchase something, they'll stamp the code on the back of the receipt for me. I wouldn't be asking before I ordered if I didn't need the code urgently - I asked for the code because I needed to stop the pee dance so I could be a customer. Even after pleading with the guy, he said no. \n\nI bought a banana, to them being snide but church-like in their politeness. I rsaw the code on the receipt and went to the restroom and didn't even take my receipt and banana, because like I said I AM A CUSTOMER IN URGENT NEED OF THE RESTROOM.  While I waited to get my banana from the cash wrap, the cashier sweetly asked the guy making a purchase if he'd like the code to the restroom stamped on the back of his receipt ( like it's an extra perk ) to which I told him the code and upon leaving, I mentioned the code to the whole store. \n\nThe barista who refused to allow me to be a customer by preventing a positive experience said pretty rudely, \"alright, BYE!!\" as I left.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-03-27", "description": "More reminders of this being an impossibly expensive city with a changing climate. Stay away Moms of children who aren't perfect. If you don't mind being judged by the staff that gossips, or accused of being a thief by young baristas that are annoyed by children being children, go here(keep in mind I know they will lie), but pettiness and passive aggressiveness ruled the roost. LAST Week I went here while waiting for my child in an activity. I purchased a soy chai latte, and 2 hot cocoas for my children and chatted outside w/two less fortunate men, one was an AF Vet, told them I would be back after picking up my daughter. I left, picked up my child and gave each man $5. I have children with a Vet, so I understand they endure a lot. TODAY I went there again today and stood at the register, the barista never saw me and so I went to use the restroom, but I returned to the table when a gentleman asked me to watch his bag, I obliged. I happened to see the Tai, the AF Vet from last week who walked by, looking spiffy and say Hello and he sits down next to me where I was watching another customer's bag. A Latino man sweeping up with a tattoo on his neck, walks past and says to us in a tone more annoyed than helpful:  \"Can I help any of you with a minimum purchase?\", and mumbles to another customer that my son had taken a chocolate milk(he is 2, and it was below the table, I hadn't realized this)-it was vanilla, but I go and pay for the milk. A few minutes later, he had grabbed an apple juice(again it was under the table and we were seated close to the counter nowhere near the door, I hadn't realized this), he wasn't being loud or pulling breakables off shelves, and there was no line so, he was nobody he was getting underfoot of( I know how busy children  can be).  So the employee who had never bothered to greet me in any welcoming way or tone, then says to me:  \"Are you going to purchase that?\" What is the implication? I hadn't realized he grabbed an apple juice and he wasn't being loud, was he implying I would willfully commit theft?\" We were sitting down nowhere near the door(It is a long store), and I had already made a purchase. That sounds like a line a shopowner might use if he or she saw an unpurchased item in a person's pocket about to exit. Is this how Starbuck's trains its employees to speak to people? \"You better hurry up and buy something or get out?' Minimum purchase? Is this an elite nightclub? Then I went to speak to the manager-Chas, a young, pretty fair skinned black lady. She gave me an insincere apology by not only back peddling, but by defending his position when she had not even bothered to consult him. If you weren't there at that moment, how can you defend it? She said: \"You have to understand our position-the baby was walking back and forth\", is a child not allowed to walk back and forth? What was very clear is that she was so comfortable in what she was saying, and lacking in any sort of embarrassment or surprise, that it is clear they had already discussed what they thought of me. He was annoyed I returned the apple juice to the shelf, and I believe my son had detached the straw but I certainly wasn't going to give them more money after that remark. Chas also said to me that they would say the same thing to anybody else, well I hadn't brought that up, so that tells me, they wouldn't treat anybody else the same way. I am a mixed race woman, a minority just like them. I didn't have on designer clothes and I was wearing tennis shoes. I spoke to two undesirables in front of them. A beanie-wearing teen who got up to order, and the Vet, while looking clean, looked weathered in his face, as if he had fallen on hard times. So, she brought it up, not me, they would treat others differently. I know people will look at this and judge as they did, that control-your-child attitude but they could have handled it differently. I have worked many customer service jobs and in the food industry as well. I always received good comment cards. He could have said: \"Ma'am, are you aware your son, has a juice?\" \"Would you like me to ring that up for you?\" Why do that when you have been emboldened by your gossiping and judgemental co-workers. I have been to a lot of Starbucks lately with the cold weather and have received good treatment. Not here though. What was worse than the man saying what he did, was that a supervisor would back him up and tell me to understand their position, so thanks Chas you are ok with your co-worker accusing me of thievery. Can't wait until you someday have a child walk back and forth somewhere and people roll their eyes behind your back. This Starbucks is about 4 blocks from the biggest playground in SF, steer clear.  I guess all is well as long as these two don't work with children and their third co-worker who has leaning over and talking to her as I walked away and it was clear(although they will deny it, we all know how that works), Mean Girls, isn't just a movie.

Or just take the N, if you don't feel like walking.\n\nWait: This Starbucks is strangely busy! All the tables are full and there's been a line the entire time I was working here. **\n\nService: The guy at the register is nice. But, the management needs some improvement. They ran out of wooden stirrers. Also they offer no straws at the service station where they should be, with all the creamer and sugar are. It was frustrating. No straws or stirrers what kind of coffee shop is this?! WIFI is free, but its buggy. *\n\nAmbiance: They have some nice outdoor seating that offers both shade and sun. Its nice because its not just tables next to the side walk, they have railing that separates that space from the sidewalk so its not completely open. Sidenote, the tables on the inside are poorly lit and so close to the bathroom, you can smell it. Yuck. There's so much space in here, but I think its poorly utilized. They have two lounge chairs in the front where two or three tables easily be placed. It gets a more and more cramped, the farther in you go. There are outlets, but I only saw three outlets in the back and three in the front. Six sets of outlets for a Starbucks this big is a little lacking in my opinion. At least put out a power surge! ***\n\nDrinks: I got green tea and my friend can ice vanilla coffee. Its a standard Starbucks. I go here because I know there will be a restroom, tables, outlets, and as a Gold Card Member I get free refills. **1/2\n\nRestroom: Two separate unisex bathrooms. Messy. Another testament to poor management. Paper towels all over the floor and no toilet seat covers. Luckily, there was AT LEAST toilet paper and soap. **\n\nTo be honest, there are SO MANY GOOD COFFEE PLACES in Inner Sunset alone.  Why go to Starbucks if you're just drinking coffee and reading a book? Be adventurous and try DRIP'D or Martha's or Golden Bear or Flywheel. But, we all come to Starbucks because we know what to expect, no surprises. We know what franchises offer: known standardized services, which is why we get stuck coming here...\n\nSo heed my advice, if you're don't need to hardcore study or work, but are in a relaxed mood go to another local coffee shoppe. Support your local businesses! Don't feed the huge commercial beast known as Starbucks. Try something new, you may be delightfully surprised and then write a Yelp review, so the rest of us can try it too!\n\n\nAverage: ~2 stars. Mediocre.", "author": "Vivian C."}

You know how Starbucks coffee is hotter than the earth's core? Plus they don't pre-sleeve the coffee anymore, which is fine. I carried my coffee from the counter to my table, then lifted from the top to add a sleeve. Turns out the barista didn't put the top on right, so coffee ended up all over myself, the table, and my phone. While I'm flustered and in a complete mess, trying to clean up myself and my stuff, the table is still dripping with coffee.\n\nAnother nice customer had to ask the staff to help and clean the table (napkins can only do so much). After 5 minutes someone finally came over to mop up the table and never asked if I was alright or if I needed another drink, nor even made eye contact with me. I had to say something, so I told her I spilled because the top wasn't put on right and I asked if I could have a new drink. She seemed pretty annoyed with me, but said \"Uhh... Ok... What did you have again?\"\n\nI told her my drink order again so she could go told the barista. The barista started on 3 new drinks before making mine again, so there was definitely no rush to help me out when I'm just ready to get out of there at this point. The entire ordeal made me feel like I did something wrong and I was being punished, when it's the customer service that's lacking in this place.

The two comfy, leather chairs in the corner by the door must be the money-spots, you get the most amount of privacy of any seats in the house and you get a clear view of that peculiar televisual radio and of the sparkly, stylish baristas. \n\nThere's a fair number of outlets throughout for all you mobile computers, and the placement of the toppings/milk/other additions bar is central enough to be out of the way for those enjoying a good sit/sip. There's pretty much a straight line from the entrance to the bathroom too, so you can bee-line it to the potty in times of emergency, whether it's before the coffee or afterward. And the location itself is right along the N-line. \n\nI'm not entirely keen on Starbucks coffee so I'm an unfit judge, but the service here is great. Between myself and other patrons whose interactions I've eavesdropped on, these guys got the whole bit down. There doesn't seem to be a large population of regulars here ever, but the baristas do their best to make everyone feel at home, which is what makes me feel okay with coming to a coffee shop whose coffee I don't drink.", "author": "Jake m."}

I don't know what the deal is, maybe they burn a lot of items, forget to empty the trash, or never shower, but there's usually a strong, nasty odor in there of some sort.  I can't for the life of me figure out why.  And while I admit to having sensitive olfactory nerves, even my husband, who rarely smells anything notices the stench and complains.

The baristas are friendly and remember regular customers' drink preferences. They recently remodeled the place -- according to one barista, people complained about the lack of open tables. So the middle part of the wall is one long bench with a half a dozen small tables for one or two people each, in cozy quarters. And there are larger tables in the front and back.\n\nI actually think the redesign has caused *more* crowding, since more people have starting coming in now that they know there's more space. I actually have to wait for a table longer than I did before the remodel.

I live nearby and have been enough times to say that this review isn't just based on one, or two, or even ten experiences. In a nutshell, no matter when I go in, it always seems under staffed, dirty, and the staff that is there seems tired, unenthusiastic, under showered, under trained, and like they would rather be anywhere on the planet but there. I've worked in a coffee shop before, and in retail my entire adult life. I know that it can be stressful, and maybe not your life's passion, but I also know that it's not rocket science, and that if you can't figure out how to spell my four letter name correctly and clearly, then you've got big problems. I also know that if you think your job is that awful, there will always be someone else willing to take your place, who might actually understand the value of having a job. I can't believe that the store manager, or district manager of this store, whoever they are, have let this store become the inefficiently run embarrassment of a dump that it is. I would think that if you are part of a huge corporation who seems to pride themselves on great service and quality products, that you would be more on par with some of the other locations, that are in fact amazing. The Chestnut street location in the Marina is pretty much perfect any day, any time, and no matter who is working. They are friendly, and fast, and it is obvious that their regular customers, of which there are many, genuinely enjoy going there.

I know corporate greed, chain, puts out the small mom and pop shop, and all that.  But really, on a Sunday morning, I just want what I want the way I want it.  And Starbucks delivers every single time, hands down.  I have never been to a Starbucks where my drink wasn't what I expected, that is the beauty of a chain.  I can get the same drink at any location.  And sometimes that is all I care about.", "author": "Denise B."}

There's this one employee, i think she's the assistant manager or something - she's one downfall.  Whenever and i mean literally everytime she makes a drink for us, first - all the drinks no matter what they are literally taste exactly the same, you're paying $3.85 to basically drink expresso and hot milk only even though you ordered a caramel macchiato or a cappucino or americano...there literally is no difference.  I understand the budget and economy is tight and you gotta cut back on ingredients but dang, you don't have to be this cheap that you don't get any kind of flavors.  Speaking of flavors, the second point is, i don't know why whenever she makes the drinks, not only do her drinks taste the same but they also taste \"rotten\" as if she's making her drinks with expired milk - it's fuckin disgusting!!  My friends and I always wait till somebody else takes over the drinks department so we can get our money's worth.\n\nSo, if you ever plan on going to this starubucks and you order a drink, make sure this girl isn't the one making your drink.  She has dark brown hair, wears glasses and the biggest observation  - she's always wearing a tie.  She usually wears a black tie but a couple days ago she wore a green tie.  It's a tie nonetheless!  Just warning you guys.  Other than that, all the staff members are awesome and they make my trip to starbucks worthwhile and their drinks actually taste like what you ordered and something a person wouldn't even give their dogs.", "author": "Me V."}

Oh, they didn't play Nora Jones here.  I used the washroom here and was surprised that it was quite clean.  \n\nService was rather mediocre, especially since I was told the washroom key was taken and it was actually sitting at a different part of the counter.  I waited for a little but but decided to confirm again with her that they really didn't have the key.  It was then that she said, \"Actually, the key's right there...I just didn't see it.\"  OK, maybe you're busy or preoccupied with making someone else's drink but you should at least have the decency to see if I was still waiting for the washroom when you realized the key was at the counter!  Thanks, lady!\n\nAnyways, this is a pretty busy Starbucks with the tables pretty much 90% occupied and a relatively low turnover rate.  Most tables were occupied by students studying because you see a number of open textbooks, highlighters, and notes.  \n\nI also spotted some interesting things happening around here.  People would walk in with a box of take-out from a nearby restaurant, buy a coffee/tea, and then proceed to finish their meal at Starbucks.  I saw someone with food from a Chinese restaurant and another person with a box of pizza!  It almost felt like I was in a food court...except everyone had a drink from Starbucks.", "author": "Ginni S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-07-18", "description": "I wasn't very into Starbucks until they initiated the 50-cent refills for regular coffee, since I don't drink but a tiny bit before it's cold; so I'll get a small coffee that's half-full, and refill it every two hours or so that I remain nearby.  I liked that because I was paying about the same for the same amount of coffee, 2-3 dollars for venti-quantity in installments during a given day, without paying 1.50 per visit, which allowed me to drop that dollar in the tip jar instead, and produce less waste overall, which was a happy routine.  A couple weeks ago, though, one of the managers at this place started charging me full price for refills because I go to my office a block away instead of sitting in their always overcrowded, homeless-people-waiting-to-use-the-bathroom lounge.

Lattes that are more like hot shake, not a coffee drink. But it will do in a pinch. \n The tea is fine, not fantastic. At least they have honey for the tea (quite important for me) and sugar in the raw for the coffee. The people who work there are usually friendly and chatty, and never balk at serving me drinks when I walk in minutes to their closing time.\n  Most importantly, it is open when most everything else near is closed.

Custom-made to suit even the most fanatical coffee devotee's needs, on-point with whatever you need.\n- Restroom: Scary, scary, scary. Also, frequently and notoriously used as a personal shower/number 7 depository. I would laugh, except I don't want to breath in the fumes. Unfortunately, you don't have much of a choice if you're stuck in the Sunset with a bladder the size of a peanut.  (Ask yourself, can you make it to the gleaming, but sometimes smelly bano at De Young?) \n- Wi-Fi: Excellent, if there aren't too many people with laptops around and you're not trying to watch any videos.  YouTube can wait.  \n- All: Not bad. The service is awesome here, save for a few meanies.  Most of the SB peeps remember faces and are very open to making whatever crazy drink your inner-child desires. I'm thinking of my mint chocolate chip frap(extra coffee, extra cc chips) as we speak.\n\nLastly, enjoy.  This Starbucks may not be the Schultz' go-to archetype, but it certainly is cozy.
