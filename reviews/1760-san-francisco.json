The vibrant but casual vibe compliments the delicious food perfectly. Cocktails are always on point. \n\nThe wine service at the table could be much improved. The somm is always very nice and knowledgeable but definitely spread thin. The servers do not pour at all, which it seems they could easily do...\n\nEveryone that works at 1760 is very gracious and passionate about the concept and food, it shows and makes it a lovely experience - even if I'm waiting a while for our next bottle of wine to be opened and poured.", "author": "Nic S."}

The culprit is the Uni Bucatini. Beyond fishy - it seriously stank - it was inedible. It left a film of grease and salt in my mouth and throat and we had to send it back because neither of us could have another bite after our first. In its place, we got the risotto, and that also made us rather salty. Because it was like eating straight sodium. I have to round down to two stars due to these two dishes. We both thought the uni would be our #1 as it was our first choice, but it immediately became a dish we regretted ordering. This is the first time I've ever sent anything back to the kitchen. That is saying a LOT.\n\nI will end this review on a positive note. The gnocchi, scallops, and burrata entrees were delicious. The panna cotta and flan desserts sweetened the sourness of our last two main dishes I really disliked. I would come back but order wisely next time. The ambience and everything is great but when your food makes you unhappy, the ambience means very little.", "author": "Candace L."}

We tried the shishito peppers, brussel sprouts, fries, crispy chicken, lamb, crab fried rice, uni bucatini, and the grilled pork ribs. The most memorable items to me were the shishito peppers, crispy chicken and the decadent aji verde sauce. The crab fried rice and the uni bucatini were good too... gee, did I just name every plate I ordered? I suppose the lamb and the grilled pork ribs weren't as up to par as the others.\n\nThe interior design is quite nice and spacious. I will say, there was a bit of a kerfuffle when we first sat down, as they positioned us at a table right by the entrance (it was much colder at the time) when there were plenty of open tables elsewhere. My friend politely requested that we be moved - at first they said there wasn't anything they could do but my friend wasn't having that. She spoke up again several minute later, with more persistence in her tone, and lo and behold, we were given the opportunity to sit at one of the booths (it was being reserved for a party that was a healthy 90 minutes away). We finished in under 90.", "author": "Ojil E."}

I have been watching this PBS restaurant show since I moved to the Bay Area and I'll admit sometimes it lets me down, but not tonight. Everything about 1760 was fantastic. I've been in SF for work so I was alone for dinner. I sat in the bar and was greeted right away by both of the bartenders. They made some great recommendations and even chatted with me about some other restaurants in the city I should check out. I had Lumpia (Philippine egg rolls) to start which was awesome. I had a good friend growing up from the Philippines so I've had this dish quite a few times and they know what they're doing here. As my main I was trying to decide between the ribs and pork belly. The bartender recommended the ribs because they'd had it on the menu since they opened and it was a staple. I'm sooooo glad I did. They were amazing!!!  Kind of an Asian style with a sweet and tangy glaze on them. I'm not sure how else to describe them but they were super tender but really meaty at the same time. The texture was great. I will be back here again and again.", "author": "Marcus K."}

I would definitely have the Duck Burger again, the combination of the slaw with the duck (cake) patty and the sauce on a bed of pickles was a balanced bite. We were a party of 4 and was able to split in quarters. The other highlight was the chocolate ganache dessert (deconstructed s'mores). If you enjoy the toasty/Smokiness of a campfire s'more, you'll enjoy this one even more so. We also had the beef tartar which was a good starter. It's light, but flavorful. The crispy chicken was tasty as well with the yogurt dipping sauce. But if I had to recommend the two dishes to get, it would be the burger and the s'mores.", "author": "Andrew T."}

I live a block away and walked past it for a good 6-7 months before I realized there was a swanky restaurant/bar inside!\n\nFinally convinced someone to try the place out last night. Alright, it didn't take much groveling. Our eyes were glossing over the menu and we were anticipating our reservation well in advance. \n\nLight appetizer on the house consisting of a small toast with salami and Parmesan, garnished with a green thing. Basically, a glorified Lunchable.\n\nAvocado toast because we're basic millennials and we want the whole world to know. The avocado looked a bit... old... but still tasted fine. The salmon skin was a nice contrast to the cayenne peppered avocado and definitely tingled the taste buds.\n\nShishito peppers were so buttery and not overly doused with oyster sauce. I didn't mind throwing away my calories at this one. Every sesame seed made me believe there's good in the world still.\n\nScallops were to die for. The cauliflower pur\u00e9e with the pistachios - brilliant. Every inch of my body was wheezing with anticipation for the next bite. I'm usually quite chatty during dinner and this dish rendered me speechless. I'm still savoring that last bite.\n\nToo bad dinner ended on a salty note. The uni pasta was SO SALTY. Even Salt Bae would be wincing. I was really looking forward to this dish and it was the most disappointing.\n\nHowever, we told the waitress and she was so nice and accommodating! She took it off our bill! Excellent service. I'm a fan.\n\nAlso a fan of the ambiance. Saw several small groups - probably ladies that didn't make it to brunch then had to just settle for dinner.

Hats off to the executive chef who happens to be my cousin, you have done an amazing job, everything we sampled was delicious, definitely will have to come back and try more.\n\nHere is the list of things we tried and how everything measured up...\n\nsmall sample of soup - light creamy soup was offered before everything else, didn't see it on the menu but I believe it was a starter to cleanse your palette before trying everything they had to offer. I would probably order a cup if not a bowl of this soup next time, it is that light.\n\nAvocado Toast - dish lives up to its name, fresh avocado sliced and topped with several tidbits, I want to say thin sliced radish, diced bacon, pickled ginger, semi sweet chutney, and the veggie I could not identify but it was light, the dish on a whole was very good, 4 pieces of sourdough bread, with each having a helpful serving of sliced avocado and the other toppings, probably the only time I have had something this fancy served and it tasted as good as it looked\n\nBraised Brussel Sprouts was next on our menu - lets just say I am not a fan of brussel sprouts, from my recollection only two places have these veggies prepped a certain way where I can say i'm a fan, this place is one of them, the other is on Bst in San Mateo.\n \nHar Gow Cavatelli - shrimp with shell shaped noodles, presentation alone was beautiful, didn't want to eat it because of the presentation haha, one of the dishes that hits every part of your mouth, another must try\n\nOctopus - more a less a staple in my diet growing up, their version is different in a good way, flash fried sparingly drizzled yellow sauce with grape tomatoes, the octopus itself was the large tentacle type not diced served almost whole. chewy, seasoned well, must try \n\nDuck Sandwich with sunny side up egg - Sampled this sandwich, the duck patty was different, to describe it let say you had chicken fried steak made with a duck meat, different is how I can describe it, not like anything I have sampled before. If you are a fan of duck this is a must try, tell em to add an sunny side egg haha\n\nGrilled fish - I am not sure what kinda fish (hamachi) it was but what ever it was, it was good, how can I say this, I really don't like fish so if you can make me like it and almost finish the plate you know it was made good. must try\n\nFries - deep fried in truffle oil thin sliced frites and garnished with furikake need a say more haha\n\nPanna Cotta - warm chocolate cake, raspberry sorbet, so bad for diabetics but so good!!!\n\nMilk Chocolate Ganache - melted marshmallows and ice cream how can you say no to that, just say yes!!!\n\nChai-Horchata- as if the night could not get any better, this after dinner treat is served in a liquid form, hands down best idea ever, horchata is already a yes for me, chai also a yes for me, and COGNAC!!!!!!!! yeah COGNAC!!!!!!!! and it is not a small shot it is heavy shot in their OH MY GAWD!!!!!! piping hot, once it touches the lips, DONE DEAL!!!!! gonna have to come back and grab the barista that makes this concoction and hire them to make it at home\n\nfood ***** must try everything, duck craklins is must try for me next time, and more of that Chai-horchata\nprice $$\nservice ***** very attentive staff, very helpful staff\nambiance ***** modern, clean, open, airy, good for dates, or couples\n\nDefinite must try if you are in the city, reservations are recommended\n\nHats again off to the chef and his team, one of the best meals I have had in a long time", "author": "Clarence A."}

Very hip restaurant with some creative dishes but with smaller than normal portions, healthier dishes and superb service! \n\nFOOD: \nI was looking forward to trying their duck fat congee, but unfortunately they rotate the items on their menu so we were out of luck that day. Their menu is arranged from the smallest portion/appetizers to larger portions/entrees to desserts. We ordered: \n+ English Peas w/ albacore and wasbi buttermilk $19: although this dish was very refreshing, surprisingly good and definitely unique, I did not think it was worth the price. \n+ Striped Bass $24: corn, edamame, asparagus, morel and cherry ponzu. I don't usually like eating fish skin, but the cook on the bass was so crispy it would have been a crime to skip out on it. The veggie melody was a refreshing touch to the dish but wished there were more fish to to veggie ratio. \n+ Bevette Steak $28: mitake mushroom, bok choy, miso-sherry and wheat berries. They was THE best dish of the night. Beef was cooked medium-rare and to perfection. Veggie to beef ratio and spices were perfect. There is nothing I would change about this dish. \n+ Milk Chocolate Ganche $12: hickory ice cream, bourbon caramel and torched marshmallows. This was pretty much a deconstructed s'more. The flavors were delicious, but 2 scoops of ice cream were tiny compared to the other components on the plate. \n+ Vanilla Panna Cotta with raspberry and chocolate: Bday complimentary dessert! \n\nSERVICE: \nExcellent service! From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, servers and hostess were really friendly and approachable. They made we were happy with everything and comfortable. \n\nAMBIANCE: \nVery hip, rustic/modern interior. High ceilings, big windows, semi-open kitchen and very nice bathrooms!

The panko-breaded crispy chicken was less flavourful than some might want but was an excellent vehicle for a really delicious herb sauce. They were both half off for happy hour. \n\nOctopus was tender and tasty - doesn't say on the menu, but it's fried. The portion was also smaller than expected given the $27 price tag. Duck sandwich was good (spicy aioli is not very spicy), and the bun was toasted and delicious.\n\nWe also ordered a single drink, which had a lot of ice and didn't really elevate any of it's ingredients beyond recognition - so it wasn't really to our party's taste.\n\nWould go back to try their uni pasta, and overall a pleasant experience, but questionably worth the price.", "author": "Christina T."}

Meat tenderness was almost zero, it certainly was not overcooked as it's still red in the middle. So I'm not sure what went wrong.

The concept is shared plates but the plate especially the large ones aren't one bite per person. The octopus ($27) was by far the best dish we had and was unlike many upscale places now serving octopus a decent portion although now where like the huge servings you get in Spain or Portugal.\n\nSome of the dishes we tried\nTombo Tuna Crudo ($17) with soy-yuzu. toybox tomatoes. sea beans. -I would have preferred more pieces of fish (only 4) and more of the soy-yuzu dressing\n\nAvocado Toast ($11). with bacon. pickled onions. radish. lime - The French Spouse loves avocado as much as an Mission or Williamsburg hipster and always likes to try it. The bread here was excellent and the topping added texture and flavour but it's avocado toast for 11 bucks.\n\nThe larger dishes were large. We could have done with just one and the starter for a full meal.\nTwo that stood out for us were:\n\nUni Garganelli (24). sea urchin. duck cracklings. annatto oil- while not at the level of the most perfect sea urchin I've had in SF which is the Fregua Sarda cun Arrizzonisi e Cori de Tonnu at La Ciccia this was pretty damn good with bits of uni as well as rich umami sauce and the pasta was cooked perfectly, the duck crackling added texture as well as more savoriness.\n\nThe star was the Octopus (27). with broccoli di ciccio. fingerling potatoes. tamarind-chili sauce. This was new preparation for me and reminded me of the sauce often used for pakora and other Indian dishes as well as a sauce that you find in coastal Malaysian cities that is used on fish and mantis. The potatoes and broccoli were an intergral part of the dish with the octopus which was tender without being mealy served in smaller pieces. \n\nBeing gluttons we had dessert even though we were full trying the Milk Chocolate Ganache ($12) with. hickory ice cream. bourbon caramel. marshmallow. I don't like Milk chocolate and the dish is a gimmick but it's a gimmick that work so well. It was indeed like eating the best s'more ever. \n\nThey have a lively bar that's as popular as the food although the areas are separated by a demi-wall. The place is popular and packed right up till closing. The service was good and attentive without being pushy or rushing us out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-21", "description": "What is American (New) cuisine? It's such a vague and colloquial term. I associate it with the latest food trends, like avocado toast, for example. Since 1760's menu aims for variety & seasonality and does not have a central theme, that explains why they are lumped into the American (New) category. I appreciate their brief single-page menu, organized from the lighter to heavier dishes, so naturally I gravitated towards the bottom half of the menu. As someone who thrives on variety, but is easily overwhelmed by too many options, this menu offers just enough options.\n\nIt's been a while since I've been to 1760. Apparently the menu has changed quite a bit.\nThe uni bucatini is no more. Some may be disappointed, but if you didn't get to try it, you're not missing much. The creamy sauce and the bread crumb topping were great. However, there wasn't that much uni in the pasta. Also, the texture of bucatini is a little too hard, for lack of a better word. In any case, there are plenty of other restaurants to visit for uni pasta. \nA couple of things have remained. They still serve a duck sandwich and the cocktails are great.\n\nThe fried duck sandwich with slaw, pickles, & spicy aioli is okay, but pretty pricey. I would have preferred chunks of duck meat instead of the duck patty. I don't particularly like slaw or shredded anything, so maybe this sandwich just wasn't for me. However, I did like creamy aioli and the thick bun, which sufficiently soaked up the juices of the sandwich.\nThe sweet & fresh-tasting scallops and the mushroom tempura were far more enjoyable. I would be interested in returning to try their beef tartare and sisig dishes.\n\nThe cocktails are great, so if I were in the area, I'd drop by for affordable drinks during their happy hour (5-6PM). However, the cocktails on the dinner menu look much more enticing, but are nearly double the price. The 1760 cocktail was pretty refreshing, and not too sweet. The Pear-Shiso & Basil-Mezcal Sour sound pretty appealing too.\n\nThe food was good, but I was a little more appreciative of the setting. The space seemed reminiscent of a former diner transformed into modern wine bar, and done quite well. The tall ceilings created the illusion of more space. There is a semi-exposed kitchen in the back. A sweeping long bar is somewhat separated from the rest of the dining room. The long cushioned bench with high back rest served as the partition to the bar. It was very comfortable, but I was a little paranoid that the people leaning against the divider, which was also the back of my seat, might spill drinks on my head, but it wasn't that sort of crowd, so I dismissed the thought.", "author": "Joy W."}

The restaurant was empty when we arrived, which was expected, but started filling up around 7pm. The d\u00e9cor is very clean and slightly rustic with exposed wood. Service was great, and the space is fairly large, so there was ample space between tables.\n\nPlating was really nice, but portions are smaller than you'd expect. The menu is meant to be family style, with a range of small to \"large\" dishes. My friend and I split the following 3 and were reasonably satisfied, though not particularly full.\n\n1) Hamachi crudo (4/5) - I liked the grapefruit gelee and other garnishes, but the hamachi ended up tasting a little too fishy (and that's coming from a seafood lover like me!)\n\n2) SRF beef tartare (4/5) - Tasty! It comes with some delicious fresh herbs to cut the gamey-ness of the beef, but the meat itself wasn't very strongly seasoned.\n\n3) Beef short rib (5/5) - One of the \"larger\" options on the menu, but it was really only 4 small cubes of meat. The beef was amazing though, with just the right amount of fat in each bite so that it was flavorful and melted in your mouth.\n\nI really enjoyed both of the cocktails that I tried, but the highlight for me was really the chai horchata with cognac for dessert! Absolutely heavenly, and I would come back just for this. It was so smooth and creamy with a thin layer of foam on top, and the cognac adds a kick to it.\n\nOverall, amazing cocktails and tasty food though very very small portions.

Essentially, it is rice porridge that's a common breakfast stable in asian countries like China, Vietnam, etc. It's a pretty homey dish so it has a special place in my heart and brings back childhood memories of when my mom would make it for me when I was sick.\n\n1760's version is a modern take on this classic dish served with crispy pork, tomatoes and a perfectly poached six-minute egg. Delicious! only complaint is that I wished it was served a little hotter - came out lukewarm. \n\nThe brunch menu is a mix of decadent American dishes like the chicken and waffle croquettes and Asian dishes like kimchee fried rice. Somehow this mixture all works together. \n\nAlso got the seasonal fruit which was standard. The buttermilk biscuits are actually mini-biscuits with about six for a serving and were delicious. The cardamom beignets were little bits of fried heavenly dough. \n\nWe also ordered a bottle for the mimosas. Great flavors besides the standard OJ like pear puree. My only grip was that it didn't come mixed. When you're paying $28 bucks for a bottle of sparkling champagne, the last thing you want to see/know is that it's a cheap bottle. \n\nWould definitely recommend brunch at 1760.

This is one of the best salads I've ever had. The dressing had a nice kick of wasabi and the fried capers really made the dish special.\n\nNext, we had the Pork Sisig. It was visually pleasing, yet again, and had bold flavors. We were very pleased at this point.\n\nThe only slight disappointment was the Duck Sandwich. It was a good value; at $19, it was perhaps the largest dish on the menu and the bread certainly filled us up. But it was one-dimensional and not worth all of the mentions in the Yelp reviews.\n\nWe finished off our meal with the delicious Brown Butter Panna Cotta dessert.

I didn't realize it was an offshoot of Acquerello until I read I saw its tag line on Google Maps, but once we knew it was related to that, we had some high expectations.\n\nThe place was actually pretty empty around noon, so this is definitely a viable future brunch option if you're willing to spend just a little bit more. It's got a nice clean interior--very simple and almost raw at times (bare concrete floors), silverware comes in a cool carved wooden box, etc. \n\nWe got:\n\nChicken and waffle croquettes: These were awesome. They're glazed in a maple syrup -- they were super soft and had a great balance between sweet and savory, and were just a delight to eat. \n\nBiscuits: Also delicious. The SO was not as impressed, but I've never been served little biscuits with some maple flavored butter and some jam -- I thought the flavors complemented the warm biscuit well, the SO thought that the flavor was a little too subtle, but I was pretty pleased with execution. \n\nCrab fat congee: this was what really impressed me, and this is probably what's going to convince me to come back and try again. I was a little nervous about their attempt at Asian fusion, but they killed it. They got the texture of the congee to be pretty right, the choice to flavor it with crab fat and heirloom tomatos and corn definitely added an interesting fusion component. The crispy pork was a nice flavorful addition and also added some nuance and texture to the dish, and the runny egg was a nice touch as well. This easily sealed the deal for me. \n\nThey also have a really nice mixture of cocktails and drinks, and you can make mimosas with a number of juices!

But the best part was this saut\u00e9ed spinach and pur\u00e9ed cauliflower.  This dish totally worked.  But just keep in mind that you only get thee medium scallops for a total of $26.\n\nNow for the reason I came.  I heard about this duck sandwich that they do and I wanted to try it for myself.  It sounded very interesting and unique.  Something an up and coming restaurant can claim as their own.  Unfortunately I was quite disappointed to say the least.  It's ground duck meat that's shaped into a patty and fried.  The put it on a nice bun with slaw and aioli with a few peppers for some heat.  That all sounds good but the problem is that the slaw and aioli and peppers are there to mask the dry and flavor free duck patty.

The portions here are a bit small but can fill you up (depending). I recommend getting a couple dishes and sharing with each other or just getting a couple for yourself. \n\nI highly recommend starting off with their rosemary focaccia with baba ganoush spread. This has at the right amount of salt to it and strong flavor & scent from the rosemary. Next, their 'Har Gow' Cavatelli is phenomenal. The pasta is tossed and filled with tiny rock shrimp, garlic butter, and ginger. It's my favorite thing on the menu in fact. Their duck sandwich is ok; kind of tasted bland and like a veggie burger to be exact. I did love their fingerling potatoes because the charred avocado and cilantro gave so much flavor. The potatoes were cooked up perfectly! \n\nI also suggest grabbing some drinks off their menu. They have lots to offer and will satisfy your palate. For a great citrus-mint type drink for a quick refreshment, I recommend their 1760 house special cocktail. For a nice sweet drink to just take it easy on, I recommend their Falernum Sour which has egg white for texture and tiki bitters with pineapple!

The lobster bisque was a soup that went down in 1-2 gulps, for a whopping $6 each. It was delicious, though the portion size was disappointing. The beef tartare was more like a salad, which was interesting and well paired with herbs, though again, was a small portion size (priced at $16). The ravioli was very good, though I've always been a fan of Thai curry. Unfortunately this dish was again a very small portion size (priced at $18). \n\nWe decided to order another main since we were still hungry, the Paccheri (octopus) which was surprisingly in a pasta format.

Damn you yelp!\n\nMy fellow yelper in crime, Cat C., made rezzies for brunch even though it wasn't necessary (dinner is another story) because we don't like waiting. (part of the getting older thing) 1760 is a wonderful brunch addition to the Polk st. scene since this stretch is severely lacking exciting brunch options. \n\nThe french toast must've spent some time soaking in vanilla and Cointreau since it was robustly flavorful. I loved that it was light, yet substantial. Berries topped the thick brioche and added a natural sweetness to the dish.\n\nMy rock shrimp with polenta was TO DIE FOR. Simply prepared with hoisin and lime, the flavors really come together and the crunchy soft chicharonnes was a dead giveaway that there's a Filipino chef in the house. Holla, kababayan! =) My only complaint is it's too darn pricey for a very small portion.\n\nIf you happen to visit in the evening even just for drinks, cocktails are on point. I've tried their Basil Mezcal sour (kaffir lime, egg white, mezcal) and The 1760 (mint, cumin, mezcal, tonic, gin) and I love that they aren't afraid to use a lot of spices in their creations. Cardamom, cumin, garam masala are a common sight on the list, so don't hesitate to order a flavor profile mix that you've never tried before, it'll be a unique experience. \n\n1760 is a casual dining destination in the Russian Hill neighborhood that's filled with locals. Quieter at brunch, but more exciting for drinks and dinner. Either way, it sure is a winner.", "author": "Janice C."}

My now hubby and I had a failed attempt a couple years ago when we tried to go for drinks after seeing how busy Amelie was, yet, 1760 was just as busy.  Janice C. and I made plans to work out a few blocks down and then catch up over brunch.  Not liking nearby Mymy & Olea so much, I suggested 1760, and she agreed.  \n\nI made rezzies in case, and we got there towards the end of brunch, so it was pretty cleared out around 2.  I ordered the brioche french toast and she got the rock shrimp polenta.  \n\nThe brioche french toast had hints of vanilla, Cointreau and berries ($12) It was two pieces of brioche and was nice and airy.  It wasn't overly sweet and I loved the very faint hint of Cointreau and the sweet berries.  Definitely a winner and one of the better french toast dishes I've had.  Her rock shrimp polenta ($18) was notably on the smaller side with some rock shrimp, chicharrones, and shiitake mushrooms.  The polenta was nice and smooth, and the chicharrones were a nice touch.  But for $18 the portion should have been a little larger.  \n\nService was friendly, the ambiance was nice and the brunch was pleasing though we weren't stuffed.  I definitely would like to come back for their dinner some time.", "author": "Cat C."}

Ordered one only due to peer pressure.\n\nFrench fries w/parm cheese & siracha ketchup...not bad, but more of a filler. \n\nBrussels sprouts -- very good although only tried because they offered it to us since one of our entrees took a hella long time to come out. \n\nScallops - will withhold comment but order it if you are not super-sensitive to seafood. \n\nPork ribs -- on the dry side. What was worse is they served it on a piece of paper that looks like an old wine menu with the ink side up. Inquired about the food safety of serving hot food on a piece of paper that had print/ink on it & the wait staff said it was bought for that purpose & tested for safety or something (didn't sound believable).\n\nLast but not least the panna cotta -- have been here a couple of times for that alone because it was so delicious.

I was more impressed by the side of fruit(with mascarpone). Not only was the fruit fresh but the presentation scored high on the visually pleasing scale.

Nice space - large bar, plenty of room between tables, good music. Good wine list - and though I didn't go the cocktail route this time I definitely will on future visits -- the list is wonderful. Plenty of small plates -- actually really hard to choose. They've listed them from small to large and from light to rich, which is very helpful when choosing. The husband and I shared the Tombo Tuna Crudo and the Brussels Sprouts. Both dishes were remarkable -- probably the best tuna I've ever had -- perfectly executed. For our mains the husband had the Lamb Steak, which he loved - deeming it perfectly cooked and seasoned. I chose the Risotto with black and king trumpet mushrooms, water chestnuts and parmesan and what can I say - it was like silk. I love risotto but feel like I'm constantly disappointed when I order it out -- this dish was sublime! Of course we had to share their Milk Chocolate Ganache for dessert which was the ideal size after such a meal and couldn't have been moe delicious - I mean c'mon - who doesn't want a deconstructed s'more for a sweet treat?

This was good, but nothing to write home about. It's a perfect size to share for 3 people, though, and it keeps you from over-eating!\n\n3) Corn-Coconut Ravioli was up next. So good! There were six raviolis in total, so it was easy to share between three people. The flavour was unique, and not a bad Asian-fusion combo.\n\n4) Seared Scallops were delicious but some were overcooked. STILL GOOD THOUGH.\n\n5) Grilled Pork Ribs with Hoison BBQ sauce was our last savory dish. I don't usually like pork or go for ribs, but this was bombbbb.

Super disappointed. This was pretty much just like pasta in cream of mushroom soup. \n\nBeef short ribs: 5/5. They melted in your mouth. One of my favorite dishes of the night. \n\nDuck burger: 5/5 I was hesitant about this because so many people raved about it in the reviews and it lived up to the hype. Another decent sized serving and loved the spicy cole slaw.\n\nOverall, one time is probably enough of this place. Good to try, but not a place to continuously return based on the food.

When  I arrived, I alerted my server I had allergies to nuts. He assured me he would tell the kitchen and would let me know if there were nuts in anything brought to the table. I specifically ordered the salad that came with pecans and asked if they could serve it without them.  He assured me no nuts would touch the salad.  The salad was served with several pieces of nuts in it which I didn't realize until eating one.  I called him over and he apologized and said he'd let the kitchen know and that I wouldn't have to pay for the salad.  Really, how generous.  You could have killed me and your offer is to give me is to take the salad I couldn't eat off the bill.  I asked to talk with the manager.  No one came.  I asked him again.  \nThen, the executive chef came out and apologized and I asked him if he realized what happened and takes this seriously.  His comment was,\"well that's why I'm out here.\" Then asked me if I wanted benadryl and if I needed medical attention.  I told him I would let him know.  I asked him if he was the manager and he said no he'd send him over.  Again, no one came.  Nothing else was done and I had to take the medication to keep from anaphylaxis.  When this happens in any restaurant, my experience has been that the manager falls over himself or herself, comps the meal and offers something to like a gift card for a return visit and a second chance.  The arrogance of this place is astounding.  Do they not realize a lawsuit could destroy their business.  They do not deserve my money and will never see it again.  I hope that you read this and choose another place for dinner.  SF has incredible restaurants who treat their customers with respect.  In addition, I told many friends who used to go there often and will never return now.", "author": "Carl G."}

With a disappointed heart, I tried to be open and order something else, but at that point...my appetite has turned bias.\n\nFor a party of two, we made a reservation 3 weeks in advance (I was determined to try this place once and for all!). Parking was surprisingly easy for that particular Saturday night, but only street parking is available. Seating was a breeze since we had the reservation, but it does seem like the restaurant is packed so expect to wait if you're a walk in party.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nLobster Bisque - 3/5 stars: individual sized (espresso shot), my husband said it didn't have enough lobster essence assuming it was be very concentrated since it's such a small cup. However there was a small piece of lobster in there.\n\nMushroom Tempura - 4/5 stars: light and fragrant, easy to eat and almost didn't want to share.\n\nBrussel Sprouts - 3.5/5 stars: pack with flavors. Love how it's paired with some sunflower seeds for a bit of texture. The slight bitterness from the brussel sprouts and the honey was infused perfectly. However, it starts to feel overly salted if indulged.\n\nThe infamous duck burger - 3/5 stars: didn't live up to the hype.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-11", "description": "The food scene in SF is lacking and pretty much a lot of restaurants I've tried, especially 4+ star places on Yelp, were very underwhelming and lacking in taste and variety so I had low expectations coming in and boy was I pleasantly surprised.\n\nMy boyfriend made a reservation for 9pm on a Friday and it was still packed and lively. Here is what we ordered:\n\n1) Hamachi Crudo - Four slices of hamachi soaked in a delicious white soy sauce and oil. The sauce was so good that I soaked as much as I could with the fish and then dipped my spoon in just to finish up the sauce (yes, that's what I did!). The best way to eat this dish is not with a fork but with a spoon so you can scoop up more of the sauce when you eat the fish. \n\n2) Sea Scallops - Only comes with four scallops but definitely quality over quantity with this dish. The scallops had a perfect, flavorful char on it that was cooked just right and therefore, did not come out rubbery. The best scallops I've had to date. The rainbow chard was tangy and was a nice balance to the flavor of the scallops. Eat the scallops with all the cauliflower puree! I don't like cauliflower but there was no hint of the actual taste of the veggie in this puree.\n\n3) Fried Duck Sandwich - I expected the duck to some out completely fried but only the outside was lightly fried and the inside left to remain moist and bursting with delectable flavors. The spicy aioli gave it a nice creamy flavor and texture to the duck. Definitely the most filling dish. \n\n4) Lobster Risotto - My least favorite dish. The rice was a little too al dente to my liking and tasted just okay with no variety of flavor like the previous dishes. I've had better risotto at Ruth Chris and Gary Danko. However, it did had a generous amount of lobster and for $32 it better have!!\n\nOverall, AMAZING food, great atmosphere and ambience, and attentive service.

The food here is absolutely amazing, each dish was so flavorful and delicious!\n\nLobster ceviche: 5/5: delicious! I loved the combination of coconut lime sauce with the lobster. It was a perfectly light combination to start off with. The portion size just sucks cause it's so small. But it's so delicious!\n\nUni bucatini: 5/5: so heavy, flavorful and tasty. It had a nice cream sauce that wasn't too heavy. The breadcrumbs, cheese and uni together were a perfect combination. A bit on the oily side but this was delicious! Another plus was that the uni didn't taste like the ocean, it was fresh and tasty!\n\nBBQ pork belly: 5/5: the best dish of the night! It was a new dish on the menu. The pork belly had the perfect fat to meat ratio. It  had plenty of meat, that was cooked to perfection. It pretty much cut apart without a lot of effort. It was intensely flavorful and went so well with the Swiss chard, mustard seeds and sauce. I wish this dish was bigger, it was amazing!\n\nOctopus paella: 5/5: it was super tasty, oddly I didn't like the crispy octopus pieces as much as I liked the lime infused octopus and when you eat it with a little paella it was so good. Wish this was also a bigger portion as well. So damm tasty!\n\nFried duck burger: 5/5: almost had no room for this. Wow this was better than what I had expected. The crispy fried duck, the aioli, bread and slaw worked together magically. Even with the duck being heavy, the slaw cut down the fatty taste of it and made it more delicious. Even though we didn't finish it the quarter that I ate was delicious.\n\nGreen tea dessert: 4/5: it was a decent dessert. I'm picky when it comes to green tea desserts, I like it with a really strong green tea flavor and this was not strong enough for me. The cake was tasty, it was layered with raspberry, cream and green tea. It was tasty. They raspberry jelly on the side was a bit too tart for me but the green tea ice cream was ok, just not enough green tea flavor. \n\nA very delicious meal, it's a must try!

The Della Frattoria Bread is perfect if you like eating things like patte. Has a similar texture but the onions they add to the dish give it a nice crunch and savory flavor. \n\nBut OMG the dish that completely won me over was their White Truffle. We had second thoughts about ordering an appetizer sized dish that was $50 but it was so worth it! This was hands down, one of the best things I've ever ate. It has a 63 degree egg which was very creamy, mushrooms, white truffle, all in a parmesan emulsion. I think I died and went to heaven when I ate that dish.

It was seasoned will and quite tasty..munched on most of the plate on my own.\n\nBeef Tartare - I actually like this dish a lot.  The beef was super fresh and had a really clean beefy taste.   \n\nBrussel Sprouts - Another delicious plate that utilizes the flavor of its main vegetable perfectly.  There was creamy sauce drizzeled over it that tasted amazing.\n\nPumpkin Ravioli - I wasn't expecting too much out of this one, but it turned out to be quited delicious.  The sweetness of the pumpkin was really highlighted here and the ravioli had a good chew consistency.\n\nLow Lights:\nSisig - hmmm, this just didn't belong.  It sounded good on the menu, but wasn't well executed.  I felt the pork itself didn't have too much flavor, and the sauces and toppings took more away from the flavor itself.  \n\nCrab Oil Congee - Hmm, this didn't even feel like Congee, more like grits...was hoping for something a bit more soupy.\n\nDuck Burger - The biggest complaint here was that the Duck was grounded beyond recognition, then fried dried.  Even with it being highly processed, it still tasted gamey.\n\nService was good, we were able to consistently keep the drinks coming.  We had a lot of drinks, and here is where it gets prices.  Specialty drinks start at $14, which is more than most of the specialty bars in the city.

The presentation is great, and food combination is interesting too. However, the scallop dish my husband ordered was Luke warm, and lamb steak was bland. We ordered three other appetizers, and the results were not any better. For the price of these dishes, we were dismay about how bland most of our dishes were. \n\nAtmosphere - 4 stars.

The Uni Bucatini were to-die for in my opinion! It's one of those special dishes in the city kind of like Seven Hills' or Cotogna's \"Raviolo.\" Everything else was solid - we ordered several dishes and shared between the two of us. My other favorites included the lobster, the caviar & uni spoons, and the pork belly. The pork belly was insanely tender and exploding in flavor - I like that it had a charred exterior to it.\n\n1760 probably is one of my favorite Nob Hill restaurants at the moment.

The fairly simple decor with more muted grays found around the restaurant (aside from the wooden table and bar tops) certainly helps focus attention on the vibrant food when it arrives. The large windows catch plenty of the setting sunlight, adding a wonderful warm glow to many of the dishes. Silverware rests in containers at your table, giving this minimalism more of a casual vibe.\n\nFood:\nLollipop kale - interesting, slightly asian-flavored dish that works best with the red currant sauce paired with it. However, I found it a little too salty after a while, either due to the amount of what I think is soy sauce on the bottom, or perhaps the guanciale lending its own salt. Canela in Duboce does a better lollipop kale in my opinion, but good effort here!\n\nHamachi crudo - beautifully presented, and an excellent combination of ingredients. This was easily my favorite of the savory items we shared. First time I've seen pluot paired with hamachi, and it was an excellent match.\n\nDungeness Crab - The cantaloupe-serrano sorbet was the best addition to crab in this dish. It added a nice refreshing little spicy kick to your bites. It also had a very fun presentation. Only quibble is that the cantaloupe flavors from the broth and and sorbet eventually drown out the crab near the end, so it ends as a mostly crab-textured cantaloupe flavor.\n\nfried duck sandwich - sorry yelpers, you led me very astray here. Sounds fun on paper, but in practice I found it missing more of a duck flavor than I would have preferred, replaced with too much salt instead. Don't bother filling yourself up with this one.\n\nStrawberry & Cream Bavarian with a lemon basil gelato and basil sponge cake  - their menu leaves out mention of jellied strawberries and a milk-powder based crumble, both yummy additions that help make this dessert amazing (not to mention a few other touches). The Bavarian is a slightly foamy cream item, sort of like a light mousse. The basil sponge cake is a little denser than what normal sponge cake is like, but all the flavors and textures work wonderfully well together. This and the hamachi were my favorite presentations.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention that they also start a little amuse bouche (that day was pink lady apples with a raspberry jam) and end with a mignardise (cocoa powdered marshmallow - yum).\n\nAll of the above ran about $80 pre-tip, but the food shares well between two and filled us up. This would easily be a 5 star in my book if it weren't due to some items overdoing it on the salt and the disappointing duck sandwich, along with somewhat slower service in taking our follow-on orders, as we did not order all the dishes at once. The cocktails also look very intriguing, whose names could easily be mistaken for another tasting menu (to try at another time ;). Not a place my wallet can comfortably come to on a regular basis, but rest assured I will be back with wide eyes and an adventurous appetite!", "author": "Linus W."}

And that's where 1760 peaked.\n\nThe tuna crudo was acceptable -- you could even say it was topped with an interesting aioli but some might say it was nothing more than mayo with a big ego.\n\nThe summer salad was wilted and pedestrian. Come to my house and R will make you a better salad any day of the week.\n\nI decided to be adventurous and ordered the Uni bucatini. Big mistake. Fishy, sloppy, and greasy. The kind of restaurant dish that R will finish because he knows he paid a lot of mi eye for it. \n\nThe corn-coconut ravioli was someone's half-baked idea of Thai-Italian fusion. You're never heard of that combo and with good reason. The dish was overly sweet and soupy and none of the flavors meshed together. Shoutout to Calabrian chiles -- the only redeeming feature. Thank you to my ancestors.\n\nR ordered a second cocktail, the \"Salt and Punsch\", with hopes that the misplaced \"s\" was a portent of masterful mixology but it was another humdrum affair. Come over and R will mix you a better cocktail and you can stay in your pjs.\n\nWe decided to skip dessert and eat the Alter Eco chocolate bar and a leftover scone from Arizmendi's. Sad but true: dessert was the highlight of the evening.\n\nMaybe we ordered the wrong things but a restaurant should not have so many wrong things.", "author": "M G."}

The focaccia was forgettable and a waste for paid bread.\n\nThe Corn-Coconut Ravioli was tasty and light. I'd get again.\n\nThe pork sisig was a refined version of the Filipino dish but ultimately disappointing.\n\nThe Calamarata Pasta had a nice kick but was also didn't have us wishing for more.

But the servings here at 1760 weren't small at all.\n\nThey were tiny.\n\nThe LOBSTER CEVICHE ($17) had a few small pieces of meat and was served with a piece of lime so tiny that I could not even hold it in my fingers to squeeze it.  The presentation was absolutely beautiful which made you feel like you are presented with a piece of art.  You feel ecstatic - until you realize that you just paid $17 for literally 2 bites of meat.  To give them credit though, there was a good contrast of flavors and it was good that the flavorings did not overwhelm the natural taste of the lobster meat.\n\nThe BABY RED ROMAINE ($11) consisted of 3 small pieces of tiny romaine hearts in a lemon vinaigrette that was very tasty.  The romaine tasted fresh and sweet and you can tell it's top notch quality.\n\nThe BURRATA ($14) was a piece of grilled bread topped with Burrata (a creamy mozzarella cheese) and garnished with paper-thin slices of Asian pear.  The Asian pear was juicy and sweet which enhanced the flavor of the Burrata, and in that sense, I liked the pairing of the flavors.  The presentation was again awesome and artsy - absolutely pleasing to the eyes, albeit that it may not satisfy the stomach.\n\nThe FRIED DUCK SANDWICH ($16) was a slight disappointment.  Firstly, it was not a filet of duck breast, but a patty of ground duck meat.  Think: duck burger.  Secondly, the slaw, although very tasty, overwhelmed the flavor of the duck and there were so much slaw that made it a very messy sandwich.  Thirdly, the duck was overly salty, although this could just be my personal taste.\n\nSERVICE has been top notch throughout our meal.  Wine recommendation was on point.  The food came out in the proper order - lobster ceviche first, then romaine, Burrata and lastly, the duck sandwich.  The pacing was good, although a bit faster than I would like; but again this is just my personal preference as I would like to have a break of at least a few minutes between dishes.  Our server and his assistants have been friendly, cool and efficient throughout.\n\nWhen we visited San Francisco about 3 months ago we went to NOPA and were completely blown away.  I was so impressed that I left my heart in San Francisco - NOPA, San Francisco.  Therefore, I can't help but compare 1760 with NOPA in terms of menu execution, presentation, flavors, prices and portion sizes.\n \nAnd in that respect, 1760 is 3.5 stars.  But until Yelp has a half-star rating system, I'll just be nice and click on 4.", "author": "Rob L."}

Awesome food, excellent service, and extremely easy to get reservations. I hate how now I have to plan months in advanced if I want to eat somewhere good, with 1760 I made a reservation just a couple days in advanced. Score. \n\nIt's recommend each person order 2-3 plates and share. Now the food:\n\n- Caviar w/ Uni and Scallop tartare - Everything amazing served in one bite. The moment you put the spoon in your mouth, you get the bold flavors of uni and everything just melts in your mouth. A must order and a great way to start the meal. \n\n- Lobster Ceviche - The coconut cream served on the side was genius. I thought the lobster ceviche was a bit on the salty side, but the coconut helped balance out the saltiness and tanginess of the dish.\n\n- Corn-Coconut Ravioli - OMG. SO. GOOD. The corn in the ravioli was rich and full of flavor and paired perfectly with the thick coconut curry sauce.\n\n- Grilled Pork Ribs  - These succulent ribs are doused in Hoisin sauce. They are nice and crispy with the perfect amount of sweetness. Be prepared to walk away with some dirty fingers. \n\n- Fried Duck Sandwich - I can't remember the details of the sandwich, but I do remember it was excellent. \n\n- Coconut cake w/ ube ice cream white chocolate and hazelnut - Anytime I see ube ice cream, I'm going to order it. There were so many strong flavors in this dish and it all worked together perfectly. \n\nFor two people the bill came out to be around $180 (including $30 corkage fee) and we walked away super stuffed. It's a great place for a date or to come with a group of friends. Will definitely be back.", "author": "Cindy A."}

The earliest reservation she could get on a Tuesday night was 8:15, a good sign that the food would be good. \n\nFor appetizers, we got the shishito peppers with yuzu-miso, bonito and sesame ($9). Good, but nothing too creative. The fingerling potatoes with charred avocado, cilantro, and roasted peanuts ($10) were delicious.\n\nFor entr\u00e9es, I went with the grilled pork ribs, hoisin bbq sauce, peanuts, radish ($18). The ribs were absolutely delicious. Tender and falling right off the bone with just that right amount of tug. I would put these ribs in my top 10, maybe my top 5. My co-worker opted for the  1/2 roasted chicken, aji verde, pickled green onion, and garlic croutons for $24 (You can get the whole bird for $42). My other co-worker trusted what my fellow Yelpers had to say and ordered the fried duck sandwich with slaw, pickles, and spicy aioli ($19). For the entr\u00e9e round, everyone was happy.\n\nFor dessert, none of us really cared for the plantain with goat cheese-vanilla semifreddo. rum caramel and granola ($10). I'm not sure if it was the granola, but something about this was off-putting. The milk chocolate ganache, hickory ice cream, bourbon caramel and marshmallow ($12) looked like a roller coaster. Nice and rich but I couldn't get into the presentation.\n\nThe espresso here is super bitter. If you order it and don't like it, it's not because of the cup or the machine. It's the beans they use, which the server admitted were \"not for everyone.\"\n\nThe ribs and polite service were really the saving graces for my experience.", "author": "Adam D."}

The ambiance is also very nice. \n\nThe food was mostly meh and overpriced to me. We ordered a plate of stuffed olives, which was basically the green olives with the pepper in them that you can buy in any grocery store. We spent $8 on olives that we could have gotten in a large jar from the store for $3. Lame. They could have at least had one type of olive that was stuffed with feta or something! The duck burger was really strange. Duck is usually served sweet to offset the greasiness of the meat, and the sauerkraut was not a good addition. The sandwich dripped, fell apart, and was unappetizing. It did not form a comprehensive dish. The heirloom tomatoes were good, however, how difficult is it to cut up some tomatoes and pour balsamic on them? \n\nSeriously overpriced, mediocre food.\n\nJust come here for the drinks.", "author": "Samara J."}

Combined with a stormy night, I sort of just wanted someone else to do the hard work for Greg and I.  Greg forced me to pick a new place to go to for dinner, and we decided on 1760. A word to the wise: Make a reservation.  We saw people walk in and were turned away (on a Monday, no less!) because it was too crowded.\n\nWe decided on:\nBrussels Sprouts. crispy onion. aromatic herbs \nSRF Beef Tartare. marcona almond pur\u00e9e. herbs. Thai vinaigrette\nCavatelli. 48 hour lamb shoulder. green garlic. burnt rosemary oil  \nFried Duck Sandwich. slaw. pickles. spicy aioli  \n\nOut of everything, I most definitely thought the Cavatelli was the winner.  Greg thought everything he had was really an interesting and wonderful take on typically traditional things like beef tartare and a \"burger\".  The fried duck sandwich was messy, but the spicy aioli on the burger was to die for.  The brussels sprouts were definitely a deviation away from the traditional crispy with bacon, but this absolutely delicious.

Decor was very modern with clean lines. All the bottles at the bar were organized. We had to take a later reservation since the restaurant was pretty booked but when we came in there were plenty of tables. I assume people cancelled their reservations since it was pouring outside. That's probably the reason why our food came out so fast. Still didn't stop be from enjoying my food! \n\nLobster Ceviche- Had to try this upon recommendations from other people. It was very fresh and tasty. It did have an Asian flavor to it. A little lemongrass I believe. Nonetheless it was delicious.\n\nMonkfish Liver Mousse- reminded me a lot of Foie gras. It was a carefully crafted place with richness and smoothness to it. Definitely recommend this dish.\n\nBrussels Sprouts- Tasty but this kind of dish I've had at many places before. \n\nCrispy Octopus-  Grilled to perfection and very flavorful.\n\nBucatini- I am a big fan of Uni but this this dish lacked in flavor. I've had Uni pasta before at the Uni Club and that had more of a complete flavor profile. This one was a miss for me.\n\nBeef short Rib- By the time I got to this dish I was so full. The combination of the the celery root and the salsa was perfect. Not to mention the mean was cooked to perfections. Would recommend this dish as well.\n\nEven though I was utterly full at this point I always make a point to save that little space in my stomach for dessert.\n\nCinnamon Custard - the server recommended this since it was a favorite of the Chef but I didn't like it. The horchata sherbet lacked flavor and didn't go well with the cinnamon custard.\n\nMike Chocolate Ganche - This was quite a creation.

We went with :\n\nBrussels sprouts (light item) $8 - sauteed with onions, herbs and covered in cooked egg yolk (that's what the yellow stuff in the photos are). although this was at the top of the menu and considered to be a \"light\" item it ended up being VERY filling. Still, it was very very good and I would recommend it.\n\nCrispy octopus (medium but leaned more toward heavy) $18 - gorgeously cooked with a beautiful seared char on the outside that gave it the crisp. it came on top of a bed of roasted fingerling potatoes so this dish was pretty filling as well. \n\nthe bucatini (heavy) $19 - LOVE LOVE LOVE. Why don't more places have bucatini? And why don't more places serve it with uni? Why don't more people feed me this!? MAKE IT FOR ME NOW! Just kidding. I LOVED this so much. The uni in it was PERFECT. It was rich, but sweet and creamy and the bread crumbs and garlic made it crunchy and salty. Bucatini is fun. More places should do it. If you're an uni lover, well.. you have to get this.\n\nfried duck sandwich (very heavy) $16 -  fried duck with spicy slaw.. oh man. I was ready to throw in the towel after the bucatini. This sandwich is extremely filling and did me in. I was only able to take 2 bites and had to hand it off to ajusshi oppa. crispy and had a nice smoky aftertaste to teh spicy slaw. \n\nWe also had cocktails. I went with the peach buck because who doesn't like bourbon? Oh you? Okay we can't be friends. The peach buck was excellently crafted. I was a bit thrown off by the star of anise in it at first but thought what hell it will probably be good. Yup, it was. If you're a bourbon person that enjoys your bitters then go with this drink.\n\najusshi oppa had the garam-masala cardamom.

The better part of my 20 years in San Francisco, this part of Polk Street has been my 'hood. But it has never had especially good high end('ish) food. So I was happy when 1760 (related to the insane (2) Michelin-starred Acquerello) moved in -- I KNEW this was what I was waiting for...\n\nBut, I left both of my visits underwhelmed. With such a beautiful menu, with such impressive ingredients, with its Acquerello provenance, how could this not come together?! But nothing did -- despite the great ingredients, the flavors never seem to work together. And in this age of increasingly impressive presentation, the dishes all looked a little 'muddy' and just thrown together. (I am the king of 'food porn' photos, and not even I could make this stuff look good.)\n\nMy experiences:\n\nCrispy Octopus w/ carrot-tamarind, cauliflower, chicken skin -- Flavors, meh. Octopus, dry.\n\nBaby artichokes w/ pistachio, orange and basil -- Bland, boring \"salad\" that looked like it was just shot out of a Salad Shooter. \n\nBeef Tartare w/ marcona almonds, herbs, Thai vinaigrette -- I almost always order the steak tartare when on a menu, but this left me underwhelmed -- merely barely seasoned raw meat with a little Thai essence. \n\nBucatini (perfectly al dente) with uni (creamy!), garlic, red pepper and bread crumbs -- My best experience, but sadly, just one for four on the food wins.\n\nI have never had any of their cocktails, but it looks like a great menu. Their wine selection is top notch, and on both visits, the bartender made great recommendations. Sadly though, on my final visit, I found myself without wine and just a little remaining bit of my bucatini. I asked if I might have a half-glass to finish my meal off. Response: \"Sorry. We do not do that.\" Yes, a small nit. But very disappointing for a restaurant of this caliber.

I've been keeping this place on the radar since it opened and I finally had the chance to check it out. We had reservations but had to wait about 20 min for the table to be ready. I wasn't too annoyed by it since it was primetime Saturday night. The hostess checked on us a few times which was sweet of her and very professional.  \n\nIt's tapas style which I like since you can try a variety of dishes without going overboard. We opted for 5 dishes. The first 3 are on the smaller side and the pasta and sandwich were the main dishes. \n\nHamachi Crudo\nLobster Ceviche\nCrispy Octopus\nBucatini\nFried Duck Sandwich\n\nWhat was the best dish? Personally, it has to be the lobster ceviche. It's the only dish that I wanted more of and I scraped every ounce of that sauce out of that bowl. The coconut with lime sauce was refreshing and light but had a creamy texture that went with the lobster perfectly. \n\nThe one I could do without? Probably the Hamachi. It didn't do much, was overpriced and had shaved celery which didn't add anything other than texture. \n\nThe bucatini was good. It was a nice change from SPQR's version. I like both to be honest. SPQR is rich and smokey, however 1760 is surprisingly light and refreshing. \n\nOverall, I'd come back again for a dinner party or to check out some of the other dishes.

My mother and I came here for a ladies night, and I was very excited to order all of the items that friends had recommended. The cocktail list was very impressive and we both really enjoyed our drinks. \n\nWe ordered the squash blossom tempura, which was fantastic. It's hard to find squash blossoms on menus, so I always order them when I can. I'm not sure what they made the foam out of, but it was overpowering and left a bitter unpleasant taste in my mouth. The lobster ceviche (which everyone said was a must), was the most disappointing. The coconut sauce was yummy but didn't pair well with the lobster. The lobster ceviche itself seemed to have a lot in it besides lobster, which was a bit of a bummer. The crispy octopus was good, but a tad too burnt-tasting. The star dish of the night was definitely the cavatelli; the pasta was clearly made in-house and the mushrooms added such a rich, delicious flavor. \n\nThe vibe in the restaurant was pretty good. It was definitely louder than expected, seeing how close all of the tables were to each other. Our server was on the cold side, overall a fun time. I do think that if I had gone in blind (so to speak), I would have enjoyed the food more, but it's been so hyped up, I expected everything to blow my mind.", "author": "Regina L."}

Too late...\n\nOne of the most highly anticipated fall restaurant openings, Mr. NSS and I visited 1760 for the grand opening tonight. \n\nAfter celebrating my birthday two years ago at Acquerello, I knew 1760 would be very promising. They've consecutively held a Michelin star since 2007 after all. \n\nPromising was an understatement as 1760 was one of the best grand openings I've been to this year. Awesome food. Stiff cocktails. Stellar service. It's a triple threat. \n\nWhile Acquerello is very formal, 1760 is its casual sister restaurant serving Nouvelle American cuisine with Japanese, Italian, and Spanish influences.\n\nEverything on the menu is meant to be shared and it's recommend that you order 2-3 plates per a person. Currently, there's only 13 items on the menu and 3 desserts: http://bit.ly/1dXhV2V. Expect to spend about $60 a person (pre-tip) including one cocktail. \n\nWe left full with no room for dessert unlike another recent opening we attended last week (La Urbana) where we had to make a pit stop to McD afterwards because we were still hungry. \n\n~ * ~F O O D~ * ~ \n*Lobster Ceviche w/ Carmelized Coconut, Pineapple & Coriander ($16) - 5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1dXfgq3\nI'm usually not a fan of ceviche because I find it too acidic but the use of coconut and pineapple were genius as it added an exotic creaminess and touch of tangy sweetness to the fresh lobster chunks. \n\n*Sliced Hamachi w/ Pluots, Yuzu Kosho & Puffed Rice ($16) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1dXfNIt\nAs a sashimi feen, the buttery cuts of hamachi along with the plum and citrus-chili concoction was a nice twist to a Japanese classic. \n\n*Uni Bucatini w/ Garlic, Red Pepper & Bread Crumbs ($19) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/17SXFZX\nAs a huge uni fan, this Japanese-Italian fusion dish was done right; perfectly al-dente pasta gently caressed by a light cream sauce and topped with uni and deliciously crunchy bread crumbs for a texture contrast. \n\n*Grilled Pork Belly w/ Gigante Bean, Radicchio Slaw & Carrots ($20) - 5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1dXghyb\nLike pork butter, the pork belly was nicely crisp on the outside and uber tender on the inside. Loved the radicchio slaw which helped cut through the richness of the pork belly. \n\n*Hanger Steak w/ Carmelized Onion, Grapes & Arugula ($22) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1dXfjSw\nSous-vide before grilling, the steak was wonderfully tender and flavorful to boot. I only wished there was more of a char to give that smoky nuance.\n\n~ * ~S E R V I C E~ * ~ \nFor grand opening day, the staff was very polished, not to mention very knowledgable (about the menu) and attentive. Food service was very timely as well. \n\nOne of the owners came by to thank us for coming which is always a nice touch.\n\n~ * ~A M B I A N C E / D E C O R~ * ~ \nReminiscent of a typical Mission hot spot, 1760 was very minimalistic with a grey and brown color scheme, a communal table, leather booths, and open kitchen in the back. There's a long, narrow bar partitioned off from the main dining area. Make sure to order one of their stiff cocktails (the Yuzu-Shiso was my fav: http://bit.ly/17mCz7l).\n\n~ * ~P A R K I N G~ * ~\nFairly easy street parking before 6 pm.\n\nWhen I returned from the restroom, I found Mr. NSS bopping his head from side-to-side. \n\nMr. NSS: \"This is my jam...yea...this is my jam...they're playing Outkast!\"\n*Small fist pump*\nMe: \"Shhhh...we're not in a club.\"\n\nMr. NSS: \"4.5 STARS.\"\nMe: \"Huh?\"\n\nMr. NSS: \"Not only are they playing my jam, the food is really good here.

Read more here http://www.sfgate.com/restaurants/article/1760-opens-in-San-Francisco-4813196.php.\n\nWe started off with a round of cocktails. Jessica had a Strawberry Shrub which she loved and I enjoyed The Mango and Spice Cocktail with fresh Manila Mango, Long Pepper, Cayenne, Lime, and Rum, yum! The cocktails were fresh and flavorful but not too sweet and perfectly balanced.\n\nI am currently in a committed relationship with Ceviche. Tonight ceviche delivered in the form of 1760's Lobster Ceviche with caramelized coconut, pineapple, coriander, and a lime to squeeze on top. It was delish be sure to squeeze the lime before you consume. The citrus really brings out the flavor in the herbs. Mmm... Want more.\n\nThe Saut\u00e9ed peaches with Greek yogurt, mint, almond, and honey were perfect. At first I thought it would be too sweet but it was not and really balanced out the palate.\n\nHanger steak, caramelized onion, grape and arugula. Oh, those grapes? My goodness those grapes! To start the steak was served a perfect medium rare and the arugula and grape salad was so amazing I could eat it every day of my life.\n\nBefore we could even ask for a dessert menu our server Robert, who had been incredibly attentive came over with the menus and informed Jessica H. that her birthday dessert was on the house tonight. Wink. Score. Since dessert is the only reason Jessica agreed to try this place we went with the Angel food cake with strawberry and brown sugar whipped cream.\n\nOh my god! Yes, the whipped creme was beautifully whipped into shape and tasted like pure brown sugar decadence. The strawberry drizzle had basil seeds that gave it an intense strawberry basil flavor. It paired perfectly with Jessica's Strawberry Squash Cocktail.\n\nSide bar: the communal bar really needs some purse hooks. However it makes for excellent people watching.", "author": "Caro S."}

Make reservation always. Fried duck sandwich with my girl to share as the entree. Highly recommended. Between the steak and the duck, get the duck. Octopus had the same stylish presentation one would only find in Santorini, and it has been 8 months since I was there last and this brought me right back to the Greek isle where the only way to describe food was heavenly. So I'd get that if I were you. The peppers were done just perfect with yuzu and miso dressing with bonito flakes on top. One could not have asked for better presentation.\n\nShirley temple for the nearly 11 year old tween who is looking more like 16 and is as tall as I. She had two. The bartender served the second one and said, \"Double shot vodka with cranberry juice. Did anyone card you? Oh well, here you go.\" Clearly joking. The girl was confused (thankfully and rightfully so), and the mother was charmed. The drink was delicious and so fanciful. The sweetest wait staff was very nice to the two of us, often came to check on us to make sure water was filled and plates were clean. The bus boy came to take photos for us. So cool that he did that. I was doing my flashcard as I had an exam to prepare and the girl was reading on Kindle in between courses. We discussed her latest fave show which was called the Death Note, apparently popular around tweens and teens and a Japanese detective supernatural series. As we went about our chat while on our date, the waitstaff came over to clean up and set the table for the next course, all seamlessly.  Surprisingly they brought dessert for the birthday girl, complimentary of course. The girl was so happy.\n\nI've always been fond of Polk Street. Have been to Amelia bar, which is right next door many times over. Now there is another great dining locale to choose from.\n\nA perfect place to take your young one to dine.

Sat at the communal table with hooks beneath them to hold our jackets and purses - very convenient. The waiter was super friendly and helpful with recommendations. We all liked the dishes we were served, except the portions were a bit small but we left satisfied and not overly full. \n\nWe started off with beers all around - the white ale and trumer Pilsner were good. The white ale tasted very pretty! And we also tried the red rice ale which was very interesting as well - nothing like we have tried before but a good beer choice as well. We then got a complimentary egg salad on top of a chip for starters before our appetizers and it was delicious but the chip tasted like something we bought from the grocery store. \n\n-Lobster bisque: we were all a huge fan of this dish! delicious soft lobster bits and the creamy soup wasn't too thick like usual lobster bisques I've had are but he perfect texture - $6 per person and it's fairly small but delicious! \n- Beef tartare: came with nut pieces, Apple pieces and mint leaves. All tasted very delicious together, the top part of the tartare when first served is bit salty so mix it around before diving in; would definitely order again!\n- Brussels sprouts: usually a huge fan of Brussels sprouts so I had to order and it didn't let us down. There were full pieces and crispy pieces (my favorite) with a strong sauce on top which was a tad bit overpowering but the texture of the Brussels sprouts were perfect.\n- Paccheri: similar to a pasta dish but with octopus pieces. I liked this entree best - rich in tomato flavor and soft pasta pieces; would order again!\n- Cavatelli: little shell pieces that were chewy but a bit hard (which I didn't like) but it came with mushroom fennel and was a bit bland next to the Paccheri. Probably won't order again.\n- Baby back ribs: came with five pieces which were so soft that they fell off the bone. The but pieces on top was a good texture combination to give it a crunch with the soft ribs. However I'm not a huge fan of bbq items so it was alright to me. It was also a bit spicy.\n- Duck Sandwich: not as good as I expected it to be. The duck meat was soft but not rich in flavor at all - almost tasteless. Probably won't order again.\n- Macapuno: dessert was delicious! Loved the ube and coconut uber with soft cake under ganache :) would definitely order this again! Very good end to our meal.\n- Chai-Horchata: my friend ordered this and the Cognac in the hot drink was so strong in scent and taste that we didn't finish but if you're a fan of cognac, youd probably like it but we weren't a fan.\n\nOverall, would definitely come again if you want to splurge on a good meal!

We wanted to get a whole bunch of things since practically everything on the menu seemed to jump out at us!\n\nFood in order from most favorite to decent:\n1) Corn Ravioli. Not sure if you have been to Cotogna when they've done a corn triangoli pasta, but we had it once before, and these flavors tasted like almost a replica (in a good way)! The ravioli had a circular shape, filled with sweet corn sauce on the inside - it was melt in your mouth heaven. Think of the juice that's inside a Xiao Long Bao!\n\n2) Uni Bucatini. How wonderful! Uni from Santa Barbara, with pasta, one of the best combinations ever. 1760 definitely executed this dish well. \n\n3) Pork Belly. We unexpectedly ordered this one at the end since my bf was still hungry. We were blown away by how different the dish was from what we expected it to be. It did not resemble bacon at all, no distinct levels of fat. Instead, it was just a nice slab of fatty meat - yahoo! Definitely surprise of the night.\n\n4) Lobster Ceviche. Fresh lobster, fresh vegetables, sweet taste of everything combined. It was a very simple dish, but showcased how simplicity can also be sublime. It was the freshness of each ingredient that made this dish stand out.\n\n5) Duck sandwich. Although delicious, and very beautifully presented, it was a bit too heavy for my taste. My boyfriend really loved this dish though! \n\nWe also got the Milk Chocolate Ganache for dessert, which was beautiful and delicious too. With ganache the shape of a soft curly candy bar, and marshmallows that were slightly torched, it was delicious. The presentation was similar to what Dominique Crenn would do, aka, \"A walk through the forest.\"\n\nWe already made a second reservation for November...can't wait!", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

I was shocked at their lack of care to food prep when my friend communicated his severe nut allergy to the waiter, and the first dish out had nuts in it without his knowledge. Nut allergies are one of the more severe allergies, and while it did not kill him, it certainly could have. Mistakes happen, I get that, but it was the way the staff at 1760 handled the situation that left me compelled to write this review. Any other restaurant would be bending over backwards to make sure their restaurant goers don't die, are satisfied and leave wanting to come back. 1760's approach was more like, \"I'll comp the side salad, and... I mean... There's a Walgreen's a block away so you can go get Benadryl or an Epipen.\" Seriously? You almost kill my friend, and you're comping the side salad and telling him to take a walk??

Nothing stood out in particular and I left feeling uninspired. Food isn't bad -- just not amazing to justify the price point. Overhyped in my opinion. \n\nStarted off with their brussels sprouts -- loved the hazelnuts sprinkled throughout. The balsamic sauce was delicious. Then we had the steak tartare, which had chili, fresh basil, mint, and cilantro, and some Japanese seasoning salt. Unusual combo but it was good. Loved the kabocha ravioli in coconut broth and pepitas. This was my favorite dish. I sprinkled a bit of rock salt and it really brought out the flavors. We had the fried duck sandwich, which was really greasy and heavy. It was good, but I didn't get much of the duck flavor because it was overpowered by the sauce and slaw. We finished off the meal with their green tea dessert, which was awesome. It was like a deconstructed white chocolate raspberry almond cake with green tea ice cream. It was light and clean.\n\nOverall, I thought the food was beautiful and well balanced. Nothing really WOWed me except for the prices. Their portions are small. The service was good except at the end, the hostess rushed us out, maybe 10 minutes after we received our bill, saying people need to be seated.. Really?

I love caviar, and it looked like a decent amount when it arrived, but the other fish/flavors on the spoon completely overpowered the caviar so we couldn't taste it at all. I felt like I bought an expensive bite of salty fish....which could be fine...but I paid to taste the caviar. \n\nI still love the bar, and like the inventive menu quite a bit. It's just not worth the spend at the end of the day (the food that is, the bar is worth it).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-20", "description": "What we know about 1760:\n1760 was a leap year.\nMarch 20, 1760 - Great Fire of Boston\n1760 yards equals 1 mile.\nJune 10, 1760 - NY passes 1st effective law regulating practice of medicine (all you doctors and pharmacists out there didn't know that did you?)\n1760 on a hazardous placard lets you know inside contains a corrosive.\nOctober 25, 1760 George III became King of Great Britain.\n1760 was the start of the Road to Revolution where the 13 colonies here in the US severed ties from Great Britain.\n\nThose are old news I suppose so let's add a new one that's quite notable in my opinion.\n\n1760 restaurant established itself on the corner at 1760 Polk Street San Francisco California.\n\nYou can rest assure that this menu labeled 1760 has no corrosives involved.  Instead, you can always count on 1760 to use fresh and exotic ingredients to create beautiful contemporary dishes while retaining that feel of good honest food.\n\nI've been here over a handful of times and since then they have changed their menu a couple of times according to the ingredients they can get for the season. \n\nMy very first impression of this place came from that first delicate bite of Lobster Ceviche. I'm guessing it's how Jasmin felt back in 1992 when she catted off with Aladdin... 1760 took me to 'a whole new world' a dazzling place I never knew, and got me lifted like I was on a magic carpet ride... a whole new world indeed.  Lobster so fresh you can still hear Sebastian singing 'Under the Sea'. (Had to throw a couple of those in there for one of my favorite Elite yelpers Ringo M. aka food kid f.A.A.t city... you'll get it if you catch his lyrical reviews on IG ringomak). It was such an over the top preparation with soft bright flavors from coconut milk, fresh avocados, and a squeeze of lime to complement the light crisp crustacean flesh. A very generous portion for the price by the way.\n\nAnother dish that always blows me away with such mastery of ingredients is their Hamachi Crudo (hamachi aka yellowtail). It's like sashimi but contemporary style utilizing complementary flavors to create a whole new portrait on your palate.  The ingredients constantly change when it comes to this dish.  I've already had 3 different versions of this dish and they were all to die for.  The hamachi was always highlighted and contrasted delicately with a sweet fruit like melon, citrus lime foam, and/or salted avo puree topped with colorful little petals and flowers. If this dish could speak to us it would probably tell us, 'You can fully enjoy all of me... BUT FIRST LET ME TAKE A SELFIE.'\n\nThey have the spoon of caviar, uni (sea urchin that 1760 sometimes pick up from santa barbara or mendocino), and hokkaido scallops which get me every time.  I just can't help it.  That is a deadly combination that no seafood/sushi lover can ever resist.  In my opinion the natural brininess of the caviar and sauce over powers the delicate scallop and the mellow yet sweet uni just a bit.  \n\nThe bucatini, a classic dish, easily made exotic with uni.  Although their bucatini (a pasta resembling spaghetti but thicker with a hole running through the center of the entire string) is not made in house, it is still a treat dressed in a fresh creamy sauce made with top quality uni.  Uni lovers go nuts for this.\n\nThere are a few other dishes I love but I will let you explore this whole new world yourself.\n\nOn another note, the ones I would not care to order again.\nThe ribs because the hoisin sauce is way too overbearing and salty.  Furthermore, it was rather dry.  I was hoping for it to be tender and falling off the bones and less salty.\nThe duck sandwich. Not much personality in flavor to such a beautifully prepped sandwich.  I was sad.\nOctopus was tough.  A well prepped octopus needs to be tender.\n\nIf you don't like something they will gladly take it back for you so that is a plus.\n\nFor the most part their service is excellent from the servers to runners to bartender to sommelier to manager AS LONG AS:\nYou avoid the blondish female server that normally serves at the communal table.  She seems to rush us each time, and was quick to be irritated in her tone and manner whenever we had questions about the menu.  Also don't bother asking her for a taste of a particular wine because her response is always, 'Try this one first and if you want to change it you can order the other one later.' No... I want to taste it first or just grab the sommelier please... they do have a sommelier.  A very knowledgeable one by the way. \n\nKing George III might not be coming back anytime soon but I sure will. The overall experience is well worth the minor kinks here.\n\n4.5 stars for food - only a couple of things are a miss but overall spectacular.\n3.5 Service I really want to give them 5 but you are as strong as your weakest link.

Mind you we went on one of the busiest weekend on Mother's day without any reservation, but the staff was happy to seat us right away and provided us impeccable service throughout.  \n\nHad the honey-thyme toast, spring peas, mushroom tempura, fingerling potatoes, and rock shrimp.  The spring peas were a stand-out w/ perfectly-cooked soft egg, smoked ocean trout & buttermilk-wasabi.  We liked the tiny honey-thyme toast w/ house butter so much we had seconds.

We are both big eaters so I would probably recommend about 4 dishes for an average appetite. Here's the breakdown:\n\nHamachi crudo - At first I thought this was averagely good but then I took a second bite with those little yellow flowers and *blam* the dish made sense\n\nBurrata - Beautiful. Tasted like high class pizza. \n\nCrispy octopus - Great texture and served on a bed of rice with a kick of spice. Delicious!\n\nFried duck sandwich - I don't like duck but I tried this anyway and I was glad I did. Sooooo delicious!! Especially the slaw that comes with it. \n\nBBQ pork belly - I kid you not there was a guy sitting on the table next to me that turned around 4 times to look at our plate. He then proceeded to ask the server what it was. This was my favourite dish. The pork belly was not super fatty and melted in my mouth. The peaches complimented the flavours. \n\nEspresso panna cotta - Genius combination of flavor and texture. We had a small battle between spoons to get the last bit of it. \n\nPS I asked for a non-alcoholic beverage. They have a house special that is not on the menu. It was cucumber, ginger and seltzer.

The pork sisig was so so. The ravioli was great but the quantity couldn't satisfy a gerbil. We got excited when they brought out the fried duck sandwich because it actually looked like a sandwich, but alas it was another textbook example of a chef hoping to push the boundaries of culinary exploration when in reality they just created something that couldn't hold a candle to a plain and simple In-N-Out burger.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-14", "description": "*Dear reader, you are forewarned that the below content is going to be a bit wordy and kind of excessive... Sorry in advance*\n\nHello 1760, you may just be my new best friend....\n\n//& the discovery of 1760//\nA month prior, I took a visit to get my steak fix at HOPR on Van Ness and parked right across from 1760. I didn't recall the name of it but recalled it being a black building and was packed so *took note in my mind to research later*.\n\n//& the reservation//\nIt was my friend's birthday and a few days before, I was stressing over making reservations at a restaurant in the city for a weekend so last minute. Thankfully, I kept on refreshing and refreshing on open table and a 7:30pm conveniently opened up. SCORE! In the little note area, I mentioned that we were coming for a birthday celebration and if it was possible for them to write happy birthday on my friend's dessert if we were to order one so that I could surprise said friend. When I called 2 days before to confirm, they told me they couldn't write messages because it wouldn't go with the dessert but they would accommodate her birthday (so it was nice that they actually read the requests area).\n\n//& the menu//\nEverything on the menu is meant to be shared among 2-3 people. Communal-style.\nDish sizes range from smallest at the top to larger portions at the bottom.\n\n//& the food//\n*COMPLIMENTARY RYE CHIP WITH YOGURT & JAM (apricot?) - it produced an interesting flavor. The fusion of yogurt and a tart jam added a surprisingly nice touch.\n*MACHERRONI - I was devastated that uni bucatini wasn't on the menu but I was so glad I got this instead! The lemon juice infused into the pesto created a lighter pasta that was very refreshing. Bits of mint here and there with the pasta and pine nuts created a hearty meal. They weren't cheap on the shredded dungeness crab either! YUM.\n*BBQ PORK BELLY - countless and countless of times, I've been to restaurants that have not cooked pork belly to my liking at all. 1760's was solid. It had a bit of smoked flavor to it, was juicy and succulent, and had a spicy-kick to it after every bite. It sounded a bit odd that the pork belly laid on top of a bed of corn porridge but OMG I think I was in pork belly heaven when I combined the 2 items together. The peach bits were just there (I could do without them in this entree but I didn't dislike them).\n*BDAY ICE CREAM, compliments of the chef - remember how I said I made a request on open table and the waitress who answered my call said she couldn't write a message but said she'll try to do what she can to make it acknowledged? Well, she brought over this dessert which was an amazing and refreshing palate cleanser. I'm not sure what kind of ice cream it was but it was light and fluffy and the combo with the raspberry granita underneath it was great! Great way to end the meal.\n\n//& the service//\nThey were very attentive and nice. Our water bottle was changed constantly and our waters poured. Our dishes and utensils were changed after every dish we ate. I don't find that happening as often at other restaurants!\n\nI had a blast and so did my friend. Impeccable service. Great food. Great location. Great atmosphere. \n\nOnly downside I'd say is that 4% surcharge for the sf healthy workers program that they have all across sf but other than that, 1760, you've secured yourself a place in my heart!

After the meal, I remembered why I didn't remember. 1760 was a huge letdown and I probably had erased it from my memory a la \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\"\n\nI had forgotten at how small and expensive each dish was. The Shishito peppers & brussels sprouts were nothing to write home about, which actually worked out since I wouldn't even have enough change for a postage stamp after ordering two tiny dishes at $9 each. The coconut ravioli was a bit undercooked and the taste left much to be desired. And lastly, the calmarata pasta had very little octopus actually in it, and when I did manage to find a piece (I felt like Nicholas Cage in National Treasure), it was rubbery and tasteless.\n\nOn the bright side, the fried duck sandwich was 1760's only savior.

So we decided to go along to an early dinner on Friday.\n\nI think I would go with other Yelpers who rate this place 3.5 stars and here's why.  What made it 4 stars was out server - knowledgeable, attentive and friendly.  What took 1/2 star away was the OK wine selection.  Food wise...it was 3.5 stars.\n\nLike others have said, don't come here hungry otherwise you'll be looking at a hefty bill because the small plates are deceiving.  We had the brussels sprouts, the mushroom tempura and the short ribs taco to begin.  Sprouts were ok, tempura was good and the short ribs were alright.  \n\nBf went on to have the BBQ ribs which minus the usual BBQ sauce made the meat kinda dry although tender - if you catch the drift.  I had the scallops and they were good.\n\nNo dessert but 6 drinks between us, the bill came to shy of $200.  So like I said, not cheap and it was OK food.  If noise level is an issue with you, do come early because they tend to raise the level of music as the evening progresses and given it's full of concrete and hard corners...\n\nNow for the wine, we were not impressed by the flavor profiles of the wines that were featured and their price point.  One thing I noted was that they were serving pretty \"young\" wines that needed a few more years cellaring (2014 vintage).  I think most restaurants are serving 2012 vintages right now for $16 a glass.

This means you get to try a variety of delicious foods to learn how consistently yummy everything at 1760 is.\n\nSome of the dishes that are a MUST:\n\n- caviar - caviar has a snooty blegh stereotype that is not at all represented here! Yes it has fish eggs, but it also comes with uni and other delicious flavors that inspire me to order this every time I come to 1760.\n\n- corn ravioli - so sweet, so yum! You see ravioli with your eyes but in your mouth it's a sweet explosion of tastiness.\n\n- burrata - so it's just bread with stuff on top, but the stuff on top makes this amazing! Again, 1760 is great at taking a bunch of flavors, mixing them, and making you wish you could eat at 1760 every night.\n\n- octopus - I was wary of this one, since octopus doesn't always excite me, but I should have trusted 1760's skill, 'cuz this was amazing! It was octopus and paella - the paella was tasty and the octopus was cooked so it wasn't too chewy, and together they were beautiful.\n\n- chocolate dessert - don't remember the name, but the description might say something about s'mores. This is fantastic! Take marshmallows and caramel and graham cracker crumbs and giant tootsie-like twists of chocolate, and eat them all together and it's amazing!\n\nI could probably rave more about other amazing dishes at 1760, since they're all good, but I should also mention that the service is amazing and friendly.

All the other wait staff except our waiter were great.  The coat check guy, the sommelier/manager looking guy, and the hostess were very helpful.  There were some beautiful and well-dressed persons dining here.  \n\nI would have given 4 stars but for our waiter.  He was this tall, skinny white guy with shoulder length brown hair.  His hair was not tied and looked scraggly.  He asked after taking our order whether we had any allergies like gluten.  I smirked and said no and he went on to give me a lecture and berate me about how gluten allergies actually do exist in celiac persons and people can choke and die (even though he has never seen this for himself).  He takes himself way too seriously and it almost ruined the atmosphere of the dinner since he was cold, unfriendly and might has well been mute.  Waiting tables at a high end restaurant is not where you choose your podium for promoting celiac disease.  I'm just there to enjoy my food and company and not listen to another person in SF on their soapbox about their cause, in this case, celiac disease.  And if I had a gluten allergy, I would've TOLD YOU.  No need to fish around \"just to make sure\" any gluten allergies exist.  What an effing weirdo.  Then when our waiter changed to Sarah right before dessert came out, no one told us.  Even casual establishments like BJ's and Palomino's knows to tell the party that their wait staff is changing.  \n\nThe uni buccatini was a little dry but tasted good.  I liked the crunch but it needed more moisture since the pasta dried out as we were eating it.  The maccheroni (pretentious spelling but pronounced macaroni) was sour and different.  I probably would not order it again.  The burrata was average. I probably would order something else.  The amuse bouche was a slice of cucumber with red flakes and something else (looked simple and primitive but tasted great!).  The milk chocolate ganache was overpriced for what it was compared to the desserts of Aliment, Seven Hills, Mason Pacific, etc.  It was a curly piece of chocolate with two spoonfuls of cream, some breadcrumbs and caramel.

I had the 1760 cocktail, which was a perfect 10, and my wife had a Bloody Mary that she declared as one of the best she's ever had (and she is a big Bloody Mary fan).  Two of the three dishes we had were excellent as well.  The buttermilk biscuits with the applebutter were fantastic, and the pork belly/fried rice brunch dish was one of our favorite brunch dishes we've ever had.  We did not like the duck sandwich...at all...but we seem to be clearly in the minority here.  We felt it could have been any meat and there wasn't enough duck flavor there...and we love duck.\n\nOK that said, here is my issue.  The price point!  I could be persuaded to pay high prices for dinners here, but we went on a Saturday around 12:00ish and the restaurant was over half empty.  In this area, even a moderately decent brunch (and most of our brunch was an A+) has waits out the door, and our neighborhood could really use a truly great New American brunch.  We are pretty sure its the price...we paid over $90 for two drinks, two dishes, and the buttermilk biscuit.  That is INSANE.\n\nWe just had brunch at Zazie with similar orders (two alcoholic drinks, two mains, and a side) for $65 this weekend, and that is a legendary brunch spot.  The $40-$60 price point (for two with drinks) works in the vast majority of other places in our neighborhood.  $90?  It's just too high.  Especially considering the portions for the pork belly dish were very small.  The duck burger was fairly large, however.\n\nIf this place could knock everything down a price point (even for brunch only, like I said I am willing to pay for great dinners), this place would be overflowing for brunch and we'd be back monthly.  But I can't justify paying that much for brunch, when that same $90 could get us an excellent dinner somewhere else in the city.  And we aren't really the thrify kind either...we like to spend money on good food and good wine.", "author": "James S."}

Wonderful natural light and soothing colors serve to enhance the dining experience.\n\nThe eclectic menu is influenced by Italy (naturally, since the team is from Acquerello), Asia, and Latin America.  The team strives to find the best, natural ingredients and to skillfully treat them to allow the intrinsic quality, flavors, and textures to be expressed.\n\nThe shishito peppers ($9), with Castelvetrano olive oil, hazelnuts, and smoked sea salt, are a good way to awaken your taste buds.  With roasted peanuts, avocado, and potatoes, the octopus ($18) is grilled to a crispy goodness.  Celery root, salsa verde, and Meyer lemon complement the fall-off-the-bone tender beef short ribs ($24).  With slaw, pickles, and spicy aioli, the fried duck sandwich ($16) is all that a sandwich should be: crispy, spicy, salty, rich, and a little greasy--yum.\n\nThe service was friendly and prompt.  Dishes arrive quickly, but diners do not feel rushed.  There is a good selection of wines and cocktails, and with reasonable selections available by the bottle, 1760 does not forget beer aficionados.\n\nWorth a trip across The City, 1760 is on the verge of becoming a new classic.", "author": "CJ G."}

My friends and I made reservations for a Friday night at 7:30pm, and we ran half an hour late so they gave away our table. It took at least another 30 minutes to get another table, and the bar area was also packed, so we had to sit on the ledge area by one of the server stands. Although we could still order drinks where we were sitting, it took them a while to check in with us for our drink order and actually bring the drinks that we ordered. When we were finally seated (the booth seats are nice and comfy!), we ordered:\n\n-Complimentary Amuse Bouche (Compressed Pink Lady Apple w/Hibiscus, Meyer Lemon, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1760-san-francisco?select=ClqwDJf0ICOvfY5vtl43Ow#ClqwDJf0ICOvfY5vtl43Ow): Not amazing, but it was a good palate cleanser to kick off the meal.\n-Shishito Peppers (Castelvetrano Olive, Hazelnut, Smoked Sea Salt, $9, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1760-san-francisco?select=ClqwDJf0ICOvfY5vtl43Ow#6PKShrg7gq6t2AR7Kmiirw): I loved the sear they got on the actual shishito peppers, but didn't think the hazelnut worked with this dish. I would've preferred the peppers on their own, and am not sure I would order this again with the hazelnuts.\n-Burrata (Grilled Bread, Garbanzo Beans, Asian Pear, Walnuts, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1760-san-francisco?select=ClqwDJf0ICOvfY5vtl43Ow#9R5F8FUVr8He6RTzDZBfvQ): Good, but not amazing. I liked the grilled bread a lot, but wish there was more burrata. The Asian pear taste also overpowered the others, and I wouldn't order this dish again.\n-Bucatini (Uni, Garlic, Red Pepper, Bread Crumb, $21, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1760-san-francisco?select=ClqwDJf0ICOvfY5vtl43Ow#IBUhfwobGWTh2LCPz9tsIg): Yum, this is a must order! I loved the creaminess of the bucatini contrasted with the crunchiness of the bread crumb topping.\n-Crispy Octopus (Roasted Peanuts. Avocado, Potatoes, $18, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1760-san-francisco?select=ClqwDJf0ICOvfY5vtl43Ow#j0yu0PRMXCMaaJ1VVM8d4A): I loved the crispiness of the octopus, but didn't think all the components worked that well together. I'm not sure if I would get this dish again.\n-Beef Short Rib (Spring Onion, Peas, Peppercress, $26, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1760-san-francisco?select=ClqwDJf0ICOvfY5vtl43Ow#hNC1svolpZ-r0f4jPsyZCg): Yum, another must order dish! The beef short rib was cooked perfectly and super tender, and this dish overall was really flavorful. \n\nI thought the service was a little on the slow side here, and wish they sped things up a little here (it would also help turn over the tables a bit faster). Overall, some of the dishes were a bit uneven, but there was enough delicious food that I would come back to give other items a try.

We being my husband, his brother, and myself.\n\nWe looked at the menu, which seemed as interesting as the space was beautiful. We were informed by the very kind bartenders (as we sat at the bar, deciding whether we should decide to eat here instead) that the restau was only 2 months old. Perhaps it's come a long way since we were there in November. I very much hope so.\n\nMy glass of wine was delicious, so no fault there. The cocktails, similarly, looked divine.\n\nWe were brought an 'amuse bouche' that was basically just a slice of pear with some dollop of sauce on it.  It was not at all 'amusing.'\n\nHaving  tried beef tartar all over the US, France, and Czech Republic, this was decidedly THE worst I've ever had in my life.\n\nNot only was the meat fatty and extremely chewy, there was nothing pleasant about it's flavor profile - read - no real flavor at all.  While the greens were nice and tart, this did not make up for the main portion of this dish being nothing short of gross.

I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Our waitress was also very pleasant and service was good. They had a variety of specialty cocktails on the drink menu along with wines. I went with a glass of wine while some others in my group tried the more diverse cocktails. Everyone seemed to enjoy them. \n\nAs for the food, I honestly wasn't a huge fan, mainly because the tapas are very small and the prices are high. I understand that things are more expensive in San Francisco than in my neck of the woods on the east coast, but the prices just seemed way too high for the amount of food you actually got. Every dish was presented beautifully though. You could tell they pay attention to detail when plating the food. We ordered about 9 plates for our group, and literally we only got one, or maybe two bites from each plate, which was kind of disappointing. I'm not a huge fan of mixing that many things in one meal either. The only dish that stood out as awesome to me was the ravioli. I would have liked to just have a plate of that myself. Oh, and also the banana bread desert was pretty fabulous, but again, I wish I got more than one bite of it. \n\nOverall, a cool spot if you're into the tapas style of dining .Great atmosphere, but the food/price ratio missed the mark for me.", "author": "Maryclaire H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-15", "description": "I did the math. Between Jamie W. and me, we tried 35% of the menu. I'm depressed. I felt like Chris Christie at an IHOP. But that's what they told us to do - order 2-3 dishes per person, so that comes to six out of just 17 offerings on the compact but wholly enticing menu. How could it not be enticing since it's the same team behind Acquerello, one of our favorite fine dining establishments in the city (my review: http://bit.ly/16vSWPC)? But the vibe this time is urban casual from the Nopa/Bar Agricole oeuvre of SF dining. Whereas Acquerello is hidden away on Sacramento between Polk and Van Ness, 1760 is front and center on the busy corner of Polk and Washington where hipster looky-loos couldn't help but gawk through the windows on their way to their regular watering holes (photo: http://bit.ly/1eT6fgy).\n\nExecutive Chef Adam Tortosa may have come up with only 17 dishes (photo: http://bit.ly/18lhSFP), but judging from the six we had, he's nailed them. We were told that each dish was sharable and that the menu is intentionally ordered from lightest (Sliced Hamaichi) to richest (Fried Duck Sandwich). Tough choices so we needed libations to help us make up our minds. I ordered the $10 Peach Buck, a smooth-sweet mix of peach, Angostura bitters, star anise, nutmeg and bourbon (photo: http://bit.ly/17C0cJi). It made for a puckery-good refresher that complemented the amuse bouche, a couple of cubes of watermelon pressed with smoked paprika and wine (photo: http://bit.ly/15w8BON). They popped so easily into our mouths that our response was slightly delayed on the smokiness of the paprika.\n\nAt this point, Jamie decided to get his own Peach Buck, and we indulged on our first plate, the $15 Dungeness Crab which was artfully placed in a crescent shape in a bowl of cold watermelon gazpacho that had a bit of a kick. The sea grass made a lovely textural contrast laid on top of the crab like wild sagebrush on the plain (photo: http://bit.ly/17BZFa6). The next dish was making its debut that evening, the $8 Brussels Sprouts grilled and sprinkled with particles of egg yolk and mint (photo: http://bit.ly/1aD6zgK). It was just the right note before the heartier dishes to come. The third dish was likely our favorite of the evening, the $18 Corn Ravioli, a half-dozen pillows of joy filled with corn and baked potato and sprinkled with bits of potato chips and chive (photo: http://bit.ly/1945PxM). Apparently it's the menu favorite, and we were told to pop them in our mouths whole to get the full burst of flavor. They were downright amazing...sweet, savory, juicy and gone in a flash.\n\nI ordered a second drink, the $11 Garam Masala-Cardamom, an exotic treat with a garam masala spice blend, thyme, orange oil, toasted cardamom and bourbon (photo: http://bit.ly/18li7AY). Ed was feeling no pain. The main events came next. First came the $19 Grilled Pork Belly, four good-size slices grilled and placed atop a fresh radicchio slaw and topped with sliced baby carrots (photo: http://bit.ly/18lh43K). While I prefer pork belly braised because it ends up more moist that way, the grilling still worked, and my perpetual pork belly craving was satisfied. Finally came the $22 Hanger Steak, the most expensive dish on the menu offering eight slices of steak smoked and cooked to medium rare and accompanied by a mix of arugula, grape halves and caramelized onions (photo: http://bit.ly/14YA8VC). Tender and good though I have to admit this was the least creative dish of the quintet served.\n\nDinner was stellar, and clearly sampling one of the three desserts was inevitable. The choice was almost made for us since we were told they were not serving the Peach Panzarella that evening. In its place was a Peanut Butter and Jelly Panna Cotta which didn't get Jamie's motor running. We decided to try the $9 Milk Chocolate Ganache, which resembled a Michael Mina creation with a Playdoh-like log of ganache festooned with droplets of browned marshmallow, canelas of hickory ice cream (a smoked vanilla flavor), granulated milk chocolate and a bourbon caramel sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/167rumY). It made me dream of putting my mouth into the spigot from which the magical ganache came. By meal's end, we did feel like we ate 35% of the menu and in record time since we took the earliest reservation available (5PM). We weren't necessarily looking for an early bird special, although the service was extremely attentive at that juncture, a big plus.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...superb small plates with very few errors in execution\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...grab a table in the middle row to avoid the elbow wars that may occur at the banquette...love that the dining room is separated from the bar by a divider\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...very attentive and friendly with the daughter of one of the Acquerello co-owners serving us\nTOTAL - 5 stars...35% of the menu and worth every bite...an excellent addition to the local dining scene", "author": "Ed U."}

We ended up ordering 8 (including dessert). We also had one cocktail each (two total). The bill came out to $150 before tip. \n\nI don't mind dropping almost $200 on dinner but the food and experience has to match the price. For just a little more we could have went to their other restaurant, Acquerello, where food and service is way better. And even though it would cost slightly more, we wouldn't feel like we over paid.\n\nOur server was fine but she totally dropped the ball in terms of checking in on us. We saw her at the window people watching more than she was working.\n\nFood was good but nothing was great. The cavatelli ($17) was the worst dish of the night. The crab dish ($15) was the best. The bucatini with uni ($19) was a close second best.\n\nFor dessert we had the peanut butter panna cotta ($8) sounds better than it tasted. Milk chocolate ganache ($9) basically was a deconstructed smore.

I've been to Acquerello's hipper little sister probably 10 times since it opened in 2013. The drinks are herbaceous, expertly mixed and truly creative. The small-plated food is delightful, and while some dishes stay on the menu a long time, their preparation varies dramatically. One month crispy octopus will be paired with roasted peanuts, avocado and little potatoes, the next a jambalaya-like chorizo dressing.\n\nDishes are listed from lightest to heaviest, starting with the crudos and ceviches, which are expertly seasoned, effervescent little bites. Then come dishes like lollipop kale with guanciale and my favorite, the steak tartare spiked with Thai seasonings and Marcona almond puree. Rich plates such as uni bucatini slicked with breadcrumbs and hoisin glazed ribs round out the menu. A clear crowd favorite is the enormous fried duck sandwich - half of this could be my entire dinner.\n\nThe sweets are impressive but a little too contrived for me. They'll do like a basil sponge cake with strawberry mousse plated like a Lilliputian garden, or an impressively contorted log of chocolate ganache adorned with marshmallow droplets to evoke fancy s'mores. They always seem more like a display of technical skill than dessert, but it's a small quibble.

I'm a BIG fan of Acquarello, so I was very interested in trying out their new casual spot. Ultimately, the food leans toward \"asian fusion\" and while dishes are exquisitely plated and sound creative and intriguing, the flavors don't always come together. Taste is sometimes sacrificed for beauty and novelty. It wasn't a bad meal, but I wouldn't actively recommend it or go back and I think for the price there are many other really excellent places in SF to go to. \n\nI went with a group so we were able to try a bunch of dishes:\n\nWinners: \n- Carrots: Best dish of the night. Really. They were almost black in color but they were perfectly roasted and spiced. \n- Short rib: I always love short rib and they did a good job here of making it nice and crispy.\n- Burrata: can't really go wrong with burrata, ever. Good, though I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do with the pieces of asian pear that were beautifully leaning against the bread - put on top? eat after to cleanse the palate? but it was gorgeous\n\nMeh:\n- Shishito  peppers: I adore grilled shishito peppers, but for my taste these weren't quite done enough - they were still some that were a little raw and crunchy, not that soft, charred flesh. I also needed to add more salt. But I loved the excessive amount of hazelnuts on top\n- Crispy octopus: I found the avocado puree on this kinda weird, like with the ceviche. The portion of octopus was nice though, and it was very meaty. It was crispy, but that did mean the meat was a little dry and tough - but that's to be expected. Satsifying, but not a winner\n- Warm Banana Bread: Good but not great - I liked the chunky monkey ice cream, but the banana bread itself was just good. \n\nSkip:\n- Lobster Ceviche: the coconut and pineapple were just too sweet for the lobster, the subtle natural sweetness of the lobster was lost. Beautifully plated though.\n- Brussels Sprouts: I normally adore brussels sprouts, but I found these a little soggy with the fish sauce dressing. \n- Carrot Cake: This is a \"deconstructed\" carrot cake with carrot cake crumbs, strips of carrot, dots of meringue, carrot gelato, and a cream cheese mousse. If i had known, definitely wouldn't have ordered. The cream cheese mousse was nice, but the whole dessert  felt overly designed. \n\nOverall: 1760 has a very New York-y kind of vibe, which is unique in SF, so I can see why people like it. And many people probably appreciate the creativity in flavor combinations. The dishes certainly look impressive, I just wasn't all impressed by the taste (and price).", "author": "dana n."}

My friend and I came in for brunch.  It has not very busy, and we were very welcomed by the gentleman at the front.  The restaurant is very roomy and open, which I loved.  Our server, who was very personable, came to the table right away to see if she could get us something to drink, which was wonderful.  We decided on a bottle of Prosecco with OJ for mimosa's.  The OJ is brought in a mini pitcher, which is about half full.  The waitress explained the menu is setup to be shared, so we ordered the Brioche French Toast, Squash Blossom Tempura and the Fried Duck Sandwich.  She also confirmed that neither of us had any food allergies, which both my friend and I appreciated.  \n\nI must say that the first two dishes were absolutely amazing.  The flavors and the textures, all so good.  The Fried Duck Sandwich was beautifully presented, and it was good, it just didn't knock my socks off like the first two dishes did.  The food, the service, the restaurant all highly recommended.  The ONLY complaint I had about the entire meal, was that the tiny  1/2 full pitcher of OJ for our mimosa's was not very much at all.  We asked if we could please have some more OJ, which the server gladly brought us, and didn't realize until we received the bill that she also charged an additional $5 for the extra OJ.  This won't keep me from coming back, but I would hate for anyone else to be blindsided by the extra charge.", "author": "Jules J."}

There are endless options with varying degrees of inventiveness.  And you pay for it.  For the most part, if you want to try these places you simply need to accept that and I do. I understand that at times you pay for the creativity and the quality. \n\nThe city has pushed the limits in many ways, and one of them is pricing.  The continuous nudge upwards has made people accept it as the norm. The small plates/tapas style of dining starts feeling a little gimmicky and like a joke on us - like the fact that it is under $20 makes it reasonable for the childlike portions. By no means is this just something that happens at 1760. But even by SF standards, the last time I was here it was on the slightly insane side of the spectrum.  At $80 per person, we left feeling like we grazed a few tasty plates, rather than feeling satisfied by our experience dining out (though the service was decent and well-trained). But honestly, who thinks anymore that our reviews change anything? ;)", "author": "whatever I."}

So I'll start by saying that we had a rather erratic experience, largely because they had some staff issues that night, so our first dish didn't come out for 45-50 minutes after we ordered, they served us the wrong dish, then didn't remember to serve us another dish that we had actually ordered because their expediter got confused.   Having said that, I think they did a great job making  it up to us because the chef (pretty new chef to 1760 I think) came out twice to greet us personally and apologize for the logistical issues, our server was genuinely apologetic, plus they comped us on a dish or two.  So all in all, I really appreciated their recognition of our bizarre experience and thought they did a great job making us feel special.  More importantly, I thought the food was excellent.  \n\nThe first dish was Caviar, which was a bit of caviar on a hokkaido scallop with a bit of uni and chives.  Given that each portion fit on less than half of a porcelain spoon, this was $9 apiece and we had been patiently waiting for 45-50 minutes already getting increasingly hungry, we were a bit nervous that we wouldnt have enough food.  Luckily, that didn't turn out to be the case.    Next up were the spring peas, which were delicious and served with a smoked ocean trout, egg, and buttermilk wasabi sauce.  We also got the fried duck sandwich, which was an entree sized course with brioche bun, slaw, pickles and a picy aioli.  We also got the grilled pork ribs, which was delicious, and came with hoisin bbq sauce, peanuts and radish.  Everything was presented beautifully, the flavors were all fantastic, and it really would have been a 5 star meal if it weren't for all the hiccups.  And finally the Willet manhattans  were good. Great date place.  \n\nAll in all, I would love to go back.", "author": "Vivian W."}

I wasn't in love with the menu and the idea of small plates before tentatively coming in, but was completely blown away with the depth of flavor and deliciousness of everything we ordered.\n\nSo much that I had to return with my boyfriend two nights later to do it all again. Perhaps I was a little tipsy the first time (or someone threw a flavor-enhancing roofie into my cocktail), as everything was just a NOTCH less good on my second visit (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). Not to say I wouldn't return, but it wasn't as mind blowingly amazing as it was the first time.\n\nFirst, let's talk service. Everyone's super friendly, perhaps a little distant and slow, but overall very nice and helpful.\n\nFood:\n\n--the corn ravioli: OUT OF THIS WORLD. If you order one thing at 1760, order this. It will  blow your mind. In fact, I'm not going to give you any further details so you can experience the magic for yourself.\n\n--the ribs: I must say I am NOT a huge rib person but these totally impressed me. The flavor was addicting: a semi-spicy Thai sauce topped with chopped peanuts. The meat: tender and flavorful, so soft it fell off the bone at first touch.\n\n--the pork belly: outrageously flavorful and juicy. I have never had pork belly so juicy and delicious.\n\n--the fried duck sandwich: oh heavens this was wonderful. I don't LOVE duck so was kinda wishing the whole time I ate this that it was chicken, but regardless, it was killer. Flavorful, crispy, and doused in a creamy aioli with crunchy cole slaw.\n\n--the Hangar steak: while perhaps the least exciting thing we ordered, it was perfectly cooked and delicious. Just not nearly as unique as our other dishes.\n\nI would also highly recommend the blackberry cocktail (forget the exact name) and the decomposed s'mores dessert.\n\nAll in all, 1760 is a trendy and equally delicious spot to check out with a well-dressed date or group of friends.

Loved the art-deco inspired d\u00e9cor and really attentive service. Sat in a booth by the window, and liked that the menu, from top to bottom, started out with more simple items (seasonal fruit ($5) for example) to more savory items like a fried duck sandwich ($18) with slaw, pickles and spicy aioli. \n\nThe dishes are meant to be shared, so think of this like brunch tapas, minus the hot Spanish waiter. Avocado toast with pickled onions, radish and lime ($7) was expertly grilled and cut into several pieces, which was appreciated for my brunch companion and myself. Mushroom tempura was one of the best items on the menu, with a celery root, Meyer lemon and fennel frond frothy mousse for dipping. Along with the mushrooms, the fingerling potatoes with charred avocado, cilantro, and roasted peanuts was also outstanding ($9). I had an egg added on top as I was pretty hungry, so that added an extra two dollars to our bill. The one-eyed jacks were also incredible, of course it was simply a snazzier version of toast with a hole (and egg inside) with the chef using a quail's egg, crumbled bacon bits and a delicate lemon-mustard sauce drizzled over the entire dish. I liked the sweetness of the brioche bread. The accompanying side salad added green flair to the dish, but I didn't partake of its fibrous goodness. \n\nConvinced I needed dessert, and since they were out of the cardamom beignets with Thai-basil chocolate sauce ($8), I opted instead for the cinnamon Babka with vanilla cream cheese mousse and apple chutney ($7). Loved the old-world cinnamon goodness and the mousse wasn't too cheesy, which I liked. \n\nThey have a full bar, so in addition to the copious amounts of water I drank (our waiter did an amazing job of refilling our water glasses) I ordered a black iced tea with a shot of Cointreau (an extra $7 for a glass of iced tea that was $5). Service was, as mentioned earlier, really outstanding. In addition to changing plates throughout the meal, there were many times while ordering the waiter suggested various dishes to try, without being overly pushy.

We were excited to be out and about, but also starving and exhausted from flying all day, so the 9pm reservation couldn't come soon enough. When we started looking at photos of the food on Yelp, we got nervous about how hungry we would still be after the meal here. We were also a little worried that we were out of our element going to what seemed like it would be an uncomfortably upscale restaurant. Luckily, the wait was worth it and the food was not only delicious, but sufficient. Also, while being just fancy enough, this place was pretty relaxed. \n\nThere were four of us and the waitress explained that the idea was to share the plates. That's always a wonderful idea to me, because I have so much trouble deciding all the time. We started with the lobster ceviche, which was fantastic! There was only a little bit, but the proportions were perfect for all of us to get a taste and still be hungry and even more excited for the rest of our meal. I had my sights set on the corn ravioli, but they were all out of that as well as the, crispy octopus, burrata, and bucatini. We settled on the grilled pork ribs, cavatelli, fried duck sandwich, and the hangar steak. \n\nThe cavatelli came first and I was enamored with the lobster mushrooms. I need to get my hands on some of those. The pasta itself was OK, but nothing too crazy for us. Then came the duck and ribs. I don't eat either of these meats generally, but I can say that they were prepared perfectly. This didn't change the fact that I am not a duck or pork fan, but I can say that I wasn't upset for having eaten my 1/4 of the dishes. Then, surprisingly, the octopus came out! Apparently, they had some extra floating around and I'm SO INCREDIBLY THANKFUL for that because that octopus was a dream. It's been a week since I ate it and I can't stop thinking about it. The hangar steak was also perfectly prepared and flavorful, but nothing will overshadow the octopus and lobster mushrooms. We had the milk chocolate ganache for dessert and were equally impressed with the presentation as well as the taste. Overall a perfect meal.\n\nI had the sugar snap pea cocktail, and wow, was it a strange experience! I loved it! \n\nThe service was fantastic. Our server was enthusiastic and everyone that came by our table was incredibly nice without being annoying or pushy.

The place was stylish and abuzz with lively energy from the guests, hosts, servers and bartenders.  The music was playful and soulful; I recall hearing Tom Waits, Talking Heads and a long-forgotten song called Walking in the Rain by Oran \"Juice\" Jones. The server was knowledgeable, friendly and  attentive. As I watched plates being served to other tables, the food looked good.  When my first plates arrived - Shishito Peppers, Hamachi Crudo and Burrata, they were well-presented and tasty.  This is exactly what I expected.  A solid 3 stars.\n\nBut then, something unexpected happened.  The Grilled Pork Ribs arrived.   They were better than delicious.  They were delectable.  Tender. Juicy.  Perfectly Spiced.  PERFECTION.  I was born in the south and I'm a snob about ribs.  I have never had ribs this good in San Francisco and I have tried them nearly everywhere and I'm usually disappointed but, not this time.\n\nThen the BBQ Pork Belly arrived and I thought I'd died and gone to (hog) heaven.  The corn porridge, peaches and frisee accompaniment put this dish over the top.  \n\nThese final dishes - the Ribs and Pork Belly - will make me a repeat customer.

Yes, we could have sat down after 40 minutes, when we were offered a spot at the community table, but it was my birthday and we wanted our own table. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a table to ourselves at the agreed-upon reservation time.\n\nSo we sit down finally, and we order, seeing as how we had plenty of time to look at the menu. 1760 does a lot of shared plates, so we ordered some items, and asked if it would be enough for us. The server said she thought so, but if we wanted we could always add more. Two minutes later she returned to the table and said \"The kitchen is closing, so if there's anything else you want, or if you think you'll want dessert later, you'll have to order now.\" We didn't order anything else.\n\nDuring dinner, we were given a complimentary order of the fingerling potatoes, which were delicious. By the end of the meal, we were stuffed, and even left a few bites on the table. And then we were given two desserts that we hadn't ordered, also complementary. Of course, we were full, so they were partially eaten. While the gesture was appreciated, it seemed it would have made more sense to comp either the cocktails we ordered while we waited, or the corkage fee for the wine we brought, or any one of the items that we actually ordered, rather than offering us something we didn't order to begin with, or couldn't finish at the end of the meal.\n\nIn the end, the food was great, particularly the uni pasta.

I just tend to over order and rarely get to dessert. Enjoy! See u again soon 1760!!", "author": "Marilyn N."}

I would have to say, everything was good.  Here the breakdown:\n\nMust Order Items (excellent):\nCaviar - it's just one small spoonful of deliciousness\nLobster Ceviche (so good, we ordered 4 of these)\nFried Duck Sandwich - my husband and brother in law don't like duck but they loved the sandwich.  Similar to a pulled pork sandwich but with duck.  Excellent.\nPork Belly - very tender and tasty.  I liked the fact there wasn't an excess amount of fat that a lot a pork belly dishes have.\nCorn Ravioli - as recommended by our waiter, you have to put the whole thing in your mouth to really experience the filling.  Yummy.\nCrispy Octopus - very tender and tasty\nHamachi crudo\nDella Fattoria Bread with whipped pork fat (perfect alternative to butter)\n\nMust try at least once (good to try):\nPork ribs\nBeef tartar\nshishito peppers\nartichoke hearts\nburratta\nfingerling potatoes\nmaccheroni with crab\nbucatini (wish they would use a different pasta with this dish to soak up the sauce)\nwhole roasted chicken - I typically never order chicken but this was pretty good.  very smooth and delicate with a really tasty dipping sauce.\n\nAs for desserts, they were all good.  None blew me away but they were good.  Intermezzo was light and refreshing.  The chocolate ganache was good.  The strawberries and cream was my least favorite since the basil ice cream and sponge cake overwhelmed the delicate dessert.  The banana bread with chunky monkey ice cream was a surprising favorite.", "author": "Shelly W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-04-14", "description": "2.5 stars\n\n**Long story short**:\nDon't come here for tapas. But get the duck burger, and only the duck burger if you insist upon eating here even after reading my review. The octopus is worth trying too if you're feeling adventurous and must have an appetizer. \n\n**Full story**:\nI love tapas. They're fun and whimsical and great for conversations with friends because you share everything. You get a chance to talk about the cool flavors that are introduced to your palate with everyone. So, I was really looking forward to a great experience at 1760 which unfortunately did not occur foodwise. \n\nOur group of 4 was seated at the communal table after about a 10-15 minute wait with no reservation on a Saturday night (which I gave an extra half star for). \n\nOur overly eager waitress recommended us to order around 7-9 plates to ensure our satisifaction by the end of the meal and kept badgering us to order more, which I honestly did not appreciate. I understand that maybe she didn't want us to wait on the  kitchen by waiting to gauge our appetites after the first few tapas but she was pretty persistent to the point of annoyance. \n\nAnyway, I could've overlooked the service for a better rating had the food been worth it but sadly for the price that 1760 charged, I don't really recommend this place at all. \n\nWe ordered the octopus, nori-roasted potatoes, burrata on grilled toast, short ribs, duck sandwich and carrot cake. The octopus was tasty and had interesting seasonings. The nori-roasted potatoes were nothing special. Just slightly crispy potatoes with an avocado mousse sauce that was very lacking in flavor. The burrata was one of the better tapas although it didn't wow me either. The short ribs fell short for me as well. Yes, they were tender and falling apart but there was so little sauce on the plate and it was all centered around the roasted veggies so I didn't really get to marry the two as much as I wanted. \n\nThe most interesting dish that I think would be worth getting if you decided to come here was the fried duck sandwich which was more of a burger. It is a large portion and worth your money. The fried duck is rich and succulent and juicy when you cut into it. However, the slaw was overly acidic for me. It didn't pair that well with the duck but it did help cut the richness. \n\nAlso, the pink lady apple in some sort of hibiscus concoction that we received before the rest of our tapas at the beginning of our meal from the kitchen was a joke. It literally tasted just like a plain pink lady apple. There was no contrast in flavors or textures or anything. That should have already been a huge indicator to me but I decided to overlook it since it was free.\n\nThe carrot cake dessert was also such a horrendous dessert. The carrot gelato was good but should be renamed pumpkin pie gelato because that's exactly what it tasted like. I did not appreciate the bland, unseasoned, shaved carrot in the dessert at all. The cake portion was kind of like what I'd imagine eating hamster bedding would be like. I was eating shreds of moist and unflavored cake. \n\nAll in all, 1760 had all the right fixings to be a great tapas restaurant. The drinks menu is 3x longer than the actual menu. The decor is hip and trendy yet still very classy, perfect for pulling in both the younger and older crowd. And the restaurant is situated in a popular street and neighborhood of SF. However, when I come to a tapas restaurant, I expect the food to be explosive in flavor to make up for the small portions and high cost. 1760 just did not fare well in this category. The food was not exquisite. My expectations for tapas bar jumped to the roof after dining at The Playground in Santa Ana just about a month ago and 1760 was the unfortunate first victim for comparison. \n\nIn my opinion, you would be better off dining anywhere else in SF.", "author": "Jenny L."}

I was smitten and will definitely be back for more. \n\nNow let's dive into the good stuff - the food and cocktails. When I head to a somewhat upscale restaurant, I usually prefer to stick to wine instead of cocktails. However, don't make that mistake and miss out on these divinely concocted delicious drinks. Each cocktail is made with such effort and specific ingredients to cater to your mood. I asked for something refreshing to remove the stress of a tough day and the waiter recommended a Black Current Bramble - wowza! And for my second drink, I asked for something with a bit more pizzazz yet refreshing Kumquat-Coconut - also wowza! My friend got the 1760 and the Pear-Ginger and loved them as well. \n\nAs for the food, I highly recommend ordering ~ 3 items per person (1 heavy one and 2 lighter ones). Our favorites were: Brussel Sprouts (this isn't your everyday brussel sprouts with bacon... the texture alone makes this dish worth trying!), Cavatelli (one of the best pastas I've had with tender pork cheek meat!), the Fried Duck Sandwich (tender duck meat with a plethora of spices and delicious spicy aioli), and the Lobster Ceviche (it's actually not raw unlike most ceviches. It's slightly cooked and very yummy).\n\nMy friend had dined here before and also recommended the Octopus and the Hamachi Crudo. \n\nSo on your next stroll on Polk Street, if you're looking for a delicious and classy dinner without any pretentiousness, definitely check out 1760!\n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

I get that they are new and trying to find a rhythm that works but they will need to find it soon. For example, my friend who ordered the fried duck sandwich was patiently waiting for her meal while i got the Uni pasta first. As we sat at the table with the Uni pasta dish in front of me, no server stopped to ask if they would like for us to bring out the sandwich.

Here's what we ordered and what I thought:\n\nTo Drink:\n-Pear-Ginger \n-The 1760 \n-Mango And Spice \n\nHow were the drinks?\n-Pear-Ginger: This was my drink and I really liked it. I think they infused the pear with the ice cube so as it melts, it doesn't water down the drink but more pear flavor is released. Really refreshing!\n-The 1760: My bf had this *i think?* It was ok. Mezcal always has a band-aid like taste to me. This was ok as it was more of that \"smokey\" flavor mezcal has and the mint helped lightened this flavor up.\n-Mango And Spice: My friend had this and it he said it was good. I only had a sip and it tasted sweet and mango-y.\n\nTo Eat:\n-Lobster Ceviche caramelized coconut, pineapple, coriander\n-Brussels Sprouts crispy onion, aromatic herbs\n-SRF Beef Tartare marcona almond, herbs, chile\n-Grilled Pork Belly gigante bean, radicchio slaw, carrots\n-Fried Duck Sandwich slaw, pickles, spicy aioli\n\nHow was the Food! 0_0\n-Lobster Ceviche: really good! Although the portions seem like its more for 2 people? We had 4 ppl fighting for bits of lobster but it had lots of that good creamy coconut flavor.\n-Brussels Sprouts: I love brussel sprouts by default but these were really good! Something about those aromatic herbs made these taste heartier, I would go back for these sprouts!\n-SRF Beef Tartare: Very delicate flavors but so yum! Again a little bit hard to share with 4 ppl but we all had one bite and it was delish.\n-Grilled Pork Belly: Was highly anticipated but I think this was just ok? I didn't care for the bean mixture the pork belly was sitting on. \n-Fried Duck Sandwich: HIGHLIGHT of the dinner. We ordered two of these so us couples can share. Honestly I think I could have ate 2 of these myself. the duck was savory and soooo good. I would go back again and again just for this! \n\nOverall, nice place to catch up on drinks and sharing plates. It is a little pricey, I think we tried like half the menu but if you stick to the duck sandwich and one appetizer and one cocktail its not that bad price-wise.", "author": "Christine W."}

Crab Maccheroni, and the Warm Banana Bread with Chunkey Monkey ice cream. All standout dishes. Service was attentive, and the sommelier was helpful. They sell 375 ml bottles, which are perfect for sharing between two. \n\nA tip: like at many establishments, the dishes are listed in order of \"lightest\" to \"heaviest,\" however, it can be deceiving. The Brussels Sprouts were actually quite large, and could be considered an entree size even though they are one of the least expensive items on the menu and considered a small plate. It's worth asking your server to give you a size estimation of dishes, versus blindly following the \"2 sides, 1 entree per person\" scale.", "author": "Marie F."}

Layout was great: long bar, communal table, dining area, additional wash station OUTside of bathrooms.\n- Noise level was fantastic.  My friend and I could hear each other without having to shout and/or lean in for the whole meal.  You can hear the excited hum or the other diners (pretty busy for a Monday night) without it being a deafening roar.\n- Attentive waitstaff.\n- Full bar.\n- Good-sized wine menu, including half bottles.\n- THE FOOD.  Amazing!  \n\nSliced Hamachi. pluots. yuzu kosho. puffed rice: Hamachi was fresh and was an interesting pair with the thinly sliced sweet pluots.  Not sure that the yuzu kosho or the puffed rice really added anything to the plate.\n\nDungeness crab. watermelon gazpacho.  finger lime. sea grass: Fresh crab, slightly spicy, not too sweet.\n\nHanger steak. caramelized onion. grape. arugula: One of my favorite dishes of the evening.\n\nRavioli with sweet potato and brown butter sauce: The other favorite.\n\nCONS\n- Each shared plate probably had (at most) about 6 small bites of food.  The server recommended 4-5 dishes for the 2 of us.  Thank goodness we had eaten full meals throughout the day.  Otherwise, we could've left still starving at the end of the meal.\n- Small list of available wines by the glass.\n- Dessert menu was... meh.  Nothing really tickled our fancy, but we ordered the milk chocolate ganache.  It was a deconstructed milk chocolate s'more.  Meh.\n- Our (young) server spoke to us like we were 5-year-old children (slow and kind of patronizing).  Perhaps she thought we had never eaten out at a fine dining establishment?  \n\nTIPS\n- Take a cab/Uber/Lyfft/etc.  Parking in this part of town SUCKS ASS.  \n- They only serve espresso drinks.", "author": "Anonymouse C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-18", "description": "This place offers one of the hippest experiences you would expect from a new San Francisco establishment. They offer a lot of creative (and delicious) cocktails, and the decor while minimalist is very modern and not caught up in the cliches of Edison Bulbs, Mason Jars, and Rag Napkins.\n\nWhat really sets this place apart from the rest is their treatment of flavors. While other restaurants seem to be drawing inspiration from the same playbook, 1760 is offering something new kind of like how the Read Option was a new offense that took the NFL by surprise. The other restaurants all seem to be offering similar takes on the new \"it\" proteins (Braised Short Rib much? for example), while 1760 isn't afraid to take an ingredient and prepare it in a more interesting way.\n\nHere I feel like they are a lot more experimental with their flavors, which might be a little bit of a shock at first and dare i say, maybe a little offputting. But this is where I'll defend it as a place that \"underground\" foodies should go. Where a place like NOPA might be upfront and obvious with its use of flavors, so that even a diner who only goes out for special occasions can appreciate the use of new and interesting ingredients, a place like 1760 might be more suited for someone who understands subtlety and unconventional combinations a little more. (No knock to NOPA, I think that place is fantastic but I think might be for a different audience)\n\nFor example, for our complementary bite, we received a slice of apple that had been prepared with a dash of tamarind sauce. In my mind, I thought that this would have gone down the tart direction. But instead they flipped it around and actually highlighted the sweetness of the apple. If blindfolded and not told what I was eating, I could've sworn I was eating persimmon. That really got me on my toes and prepared me for the rest of the meal. The short rib I had was so tender, but at the same time browned to create a nice almost crisped texture. The last time I had something like that was at Benu.\n\nThe prevalent theme I discovered across all the dishes we tried (the Scallops, the Fried Octopus, the Short Rib, Ravioli Uovo) is that they were all elegantly plated and their treatment was more of an approach to flavors that homogenized them instead of having certain ingredients dominate as the overarching flavor. It was a subtle approach that challenged me as a diner and left me wanting more. I will certainly go back and recommend this place to anyone who is sort of jaded by some of the other dining options that are out there, but still looking for that cool and upbeat city vibe.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

We will definitely be back.  As one of the most anticipated restaurant openings in fall of 2013, it has the potential to be comparable to other great  New American/Californian Cuisine  restaurants in this city. As my boyfriend being a Chef who works and knows this industry VERY well, and being a food enthusiast at heart, we both combined have VERY high expectations when it comes to our dining experience.  \n\n   The menu opening night started with lighter more refreshing dishes then moved into more savory options.  He and I had about 9 dishes total, out of 16 dishes and maybe would of ordered the whole menu if they didn't run out of some of the options. All of them were great as a whole. \n\n   Cocktails were great, we both had Old Fashioneds  but were disappointed to see ice machine(small) ice cubes that watered down the cocktail. \nOther great cocktails we tried were The Garam Masala and Cardamom Cocktail, and the The Yuzu Shiso Cocktail both were distinctive in flavor, and unique in their components. \n\n\nSliced Hamachi; with Granny Smith apple, fennel and radish - was very light and refreshing dish. The ingredients blended well together and both the granny smith apple and fennel were light flavors that didn't overpower the taste of the Hamachi.\n \nLobster ceviche with caramelized coconut, pineapple, corriender:   Probably the least of my favorites, it's a very testy dish if you love coconut and fruity flavors. \n\nBeef tartare, Marcona almond, herbs and chile- a very unique twist on tartare, the different herbs in this dish packed transparent and well paired flavoring with every bite of beef. Although the dish said it had almonds, the almonds were butted and not as flavorful as anticipated. \n\nCorn Ravioli, baked potato, potato chips chives-  Overall winning dish. Executed well and can definitely  taste the sweetness  corn in the ravioli, the corn was sweet , smooth and savory. \n\nGrilled Pork Belly with gitante bean, radicchio slaw. and carrots : Delicious dish , raddiccho slaw seemed to be the prominent  flavor in this dish. Didn't really catch the gigante beans . As for the pork, you can never go wrong with ordering a pork belly!  \n\nWarm potato salad with  pickled cucumber, apple and marinated soft boiled duck egg- I have never had warm potato salad, and the ingredients in this dish fused well together. No ingredient over powered another. Balanced, savory and delectable. \n\nBucatini with uni, garlic, and red pepper bread crumbs: - Pasta had a great bite to it, but the taste of the Uni was over powering the rest of the ingredients. But still delicious. \n\nFried duck sandwich with  slaw,pickles and spicy aioli  -THE BEST DISH OF THE NIGHT!! Duck was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The bun for this sandwich was toasted to the right consistency. The slaw, pickles and aioli packed a punch of strong flavor with every bite. Mouthwatering, and over all my  favorite dish! \n\nMilk chocolate ganache, hickory ice cream, bourbon caramel and marshmallow- Perfect for the chocolate lover, hickory ice cream was smooth, delectable and married all the other components of the dish to compliment one another. \n\n\n\nOverall, I really like this place!

We ordered a total of 8 dishes (including 2 desserts) for 3 people. None of us being overly famished, this was the right amount of food. \n\nNow granted conversation was so good, it does become hard to concentrate on the food. But I will say nothing really stood out to me. There never was a pause of...\"Wow, that was amazing!\" As a matter of fact the opposite in 2 cases. But I am still giving 4 stars for good reason, and I do recommend this restaurant. \n\nI wasn't a fan of 2 dishes: The brussel sprouts were a little too drenched in soy sauce and became soggy. Although good flavors were there, they need to work on the sogginess factor. \n\nThe second dish that no one at the table enjoyed was the Bucatini uni. I ordered this because I read good reviews for it on Yelp, but I must say it was excessively fishy and really lacking another other flavor besides the ocean. Maybe we had a bad batch of sea urchin, I don't know. \n\nWe also had the smoked pork belly, which was very good. The hanger steak with arugula and grapes, which was probably my favorite for the night. Whatever that brown puree was (caramelized onion maybe?) with the steak was phenomenal. And the grapes were a nice way to freshen up a traditional steak dish.  \n\nWe also had the hamachi dish, also good. The steak tartar, although not my favorite steak tartar in the city (Wayfare Tavern holds that record), it was still delicious. \n\nWe couldn't decided on desserts so we ordered whatever the chocolate option was and the panna cotta take on PB & J. Both were good. \n\nWine selection (by the glass) was limited, but the options were enough. Service was on point all night. The staff there really know what they're doing, I appreciate that. \n\nOverall, I had a good experience. None of the dishes really blew me away, but I will come back after they have been open for awhile. Give them some time to get into a groove and perfect the dishes.", "author": "Carlynn A."}

We had a reservation at 5:30 PM last night and we arrived a couple minutes after to check in for our reservation. Unfortunately one person in our party was running 20 minutes late so after we checked in told the hostess we'd just stand outside and wait. So there we were, standing right outside the big glass door, in front of the hostess, in broad daylight until our friend arrived. When we walked inside a different girl walked up to greet us and told us our reservation was \"marked as lost\" because we didn't show up. After explaining to her what happened, she was very accommodating and found us a table. The girl who helped ended up being our server and she was fantastic. Very attentive and knowledgable about the menu and different wine pairings. When it came to the food I can say it was very good, but I wasn't blown away by anything I tried other than the Fried Duck Sandwich. The duck was incredible and I'd highly recommend it. This was a business meeting of sorts, and we'd built up quite a tab by the time was all said and done. When we paid it came out to around $300.00 for 3 people. Not excessive, but it definitely wasn't cheap. What really topped off the whole night... Right when we paid, the hostess who checked us in and \"no-showed\" our reservation walked to our table and said \"If you guys would like to move I have a community table open but I'm going to need to seat my next reservation here.\" I mean I'm sorry but I was still drinking my glass of wine and just paid nearly $100 per-person to sit here and eat and now I was being rushed out of my chair. I understanding keeping to a schedule but overall the hostess at this place last night was just terrible. Zero patience and people skills. I really hope it's not this places vision to move her up to being a server. The service was actually really good and I'd hate to see someone like her helping tables.", "author": "Joshua S."}

We ordered Tuna Sashimi, Brussel Sprouts and the Duck Sandwich. The waitress brought over a silverware holder with tons of forks, spoons and knives...that's weird...why not just bring us 1 each??\n\nThe Tuna Sashimi was really good! It was super fresh and seasoned perfectly with a little salt, citrus and shredded radish.(I think it was radish)\n\nThe Brussels were good but good if you like really salty, oily, very brown Brussel sprouts. Which for some reason I really liked. My bf hated them and said we make them better at home, which I had to agree with. His point was, this is a high end restaurant and they are relying on too much grease and salt to make it good. Makes sense. I recommended the Brussel sprouts from Park Tavern instead!\n\nThe Duck sandwich was sooo good! It definitely was overpriced though. I mean it tasted like really good food truck food, greasy and salty and delicious but $15?

Boy was that a mistake! The plates are meant to be shared and we could have ended the meal happy and content. Everything was delicious! The charcuterie plate on the other hand was not. For 22$ we expected something more than tiny pieces of saucisson, breakfast sausages, and fried pancetta.  At that price at Spruce you get pate, rillettes, bread etc. This was a major disappointment especially at their high price point.

I could have knocked back five of these. They can make them in an equally (okay, *almost* equally) tasty non-alcoholic version. It's hard to get a table here, but if you arrive early enough on a weeknight they may still be able to help you, or possibly seat you at the community table.

Our waitress was fantastic and was always around but never over-bearing. She offered some helpful and honest suggestions on drinks and food. \n\nThe food: some dishes were world-class, while others fell very flat, especially for the high price. What we loved: the Caviar, the Lobster Ceviche, and the Crispy Octopus. The Caviar came in a spoon and melts in your mouth. The Lobster Ceviche was a very light and fresh dish and was a great transition into the rest of our meal. The Crispy Octopus was tender and crispy, not tough at all, and came with what I would describe as a mildly spicy jumbalaya filler. \n\nWhat we would avoid if we came again: the Buccatini and the Hangar Steak. The Buccatini just tasted like glorified mac and cheese and the uni really didn't go well with it. The cheese was very over-powering. Hangar Steak was probably the most disappointing dish. You only get 6 thin pieces of steak with a side of arugula. And the steak was a bit overcooked in my opinion. \n\nThe price: This is my problem with the place. It's very over-priced. I'm ok with spending some extra money on caviar and lobster because I know that doesn't exactly come easy or cheap for a restaurant. But what really sent me over the top was the $28 for the Hangar Steak. 1760 are you really going to charge us that much for 6 slices of mediocre beef and then only give slightly-dressed arugula as a side? Either replace the steak with Kobe Beef or give me some more caviar with it if you're going to charge $28. \n\nOur meal for these dishes and 2 drinks came out to be $160 before tip. In my mind it should have been about $50 cheaper for the food that we got. \n\nWe both decided that we would come back for drinks and maybe a quick bite if we lived in the neighborhood, but wouldn't go out of our way to spend that type of money again.", "author": "Jeff S."}

We tried pretty much the entire cocktail menu and decided that the basil,  yuzu shiso and peach buck were the best of them all. \n\nAs far as food goes, I challenge anyone to find Brussels sprouts as delicious as these ones. Heads up to vegetarians that fish sauce is used in them, so they're not entirely veggie (also the case with most of their vegetable dishes so make sure to ask your server what's safe)\n\nThe lobster crudo was the surprise hit and paired so well with the coconut cream it was served on. Super clean and fresh. Crispy octopus was a knockout and the steak tartare and Dungeness crab were tasty too but a bit more conventional.\n\nMy only negative comment might be about the amuse bouche of compressed honeydew with raspberry vinegar...I've had some pretty ridiculous amuses in my lifetime (i.e wee smatterings of ingredients tossed on to a smear of sauce and served in unreasonably massive bowls) but let me just say that 1 tiny piece of honeydew melon for each of us served on a massive plate and without anything else on the plate does not make an amuse bouche. Come on now.\n\nOtherwise, there is an almost clinically precise execution of the food and flavors that I can imagine some would not be into, but when presented in such a low key fashion with top notch service, I find it hard to not love.\n\nI don't often find myself hanging out around Polk, but I would absolutely come back here time and again to frequent this spot.", "author": "Clarissa S."}

The Uni and pasta ratio could be improved by adding just a little more uni so you are not left with plain bucatini - albeit cooked perfectly. Wouldn't expect any less from Acquerello's new gem.\n\nDessert - Milk chocolate ganache - this dish was basically a play on deconstructed S'mores but with caramel and bourbon ice cream.

They all had a really good sense of humor while maintaining super high standard of professionalism without being super stuffy and snooty. The drinks were bomb too (although they were not cheap). \n\nThey bring out a pallet starter (can't remember the exact term they used for it) beforehand. Can't remember exactly what it entailed, but i remember there being an edible flower involved, so I was all about that. Actually, a lot of dishes had edible flowers, which, like i said, are super cool to me personally. \n\nWe ordered: lobster ceviche (omg just saying it makes me emotional/nostalgic), brussel sprouts (super noms), artichoke hearts (ughh yes please), the crab (double ughhh yes so lemongrassy and flavorful), burrata (super good, but then again, I've never been disappointed with burrata before), and finally the asparagus ravioli. I feel like I'm forgetting something important here. Oh well, whatever it was, I know it was great because nothing I ate was just \"oh this is pretty good\" it was all \"WTF IS HAPPENING TO MY MOUTH IT FEELS LIKE A SUNRISE.\"\n\nActually, we didn't order the asparagus ravioli, but I think because they weren't ready at 8pm on the dot (they were only like 5 or 10 minutes late to seat us though)/it was my birthday/the chef was feeling \"generous\" we got it anyway. That was probably the best thing besides the ceviche. It was like a soup dumpling, except ravioli. You put the whole piece in your mouth, you bite down, and ravioli explodes (not violently or messy or anything, but in the best way possible) in your mouth and every corner of your tongue is covered with the creamy, yet light flavor. \n\nAnywho, my father, my sister and I are definitely coming back here again, but next time we're bringing my snooty foody sister from NYC because she saw all our pictures on instagram and facebook and got really jealous and requested a visit. We're also bringing our cousin from NYC, but I don't really know his standard for food so I guess that's an insignificant detail. \n\nOverall, it's a high ranker in my personal top 5 favorite places I've eaten at in SF.", "author": "Deborah R."}

We enjoyed ourselves but the food was hit and miss. I'll start by saying I really liked the vibe in the restaurant. A lively and diverse crowd gave the place a fun energy. Our waitress was very helpful too.\n\nWe came with a group of four and started with drinks and beer. The cocktails were fresh and different, we thought they were really great and a good way to start the meal. The wine list is great but many of the wines are pretty expensive, at least 75$, which seems outrageous I would not expect that going to a small plates restaurant. Way overpriced. Oh the tech boom in SF. \n\nAs for food, the lobster ceviche was outstanding and probably the best thing we ordered all night. The peppers were a huge disappointment, so bad we sent them back, something I haven't done in years. We also shared the corn ravioli, ribs, duck sandwich, octopus, and baby artichokes. Everything besides the baby artichokes I'd rate as 4 stars. Nothing really to knock your socks off but good flavors, and I'd probably order all again. A little strange they put peanuts on so many dishes here, like peppers and ribs, didn't care for the peanuts at all, very bizarre.\n\nOverall I'd say it was a solid 4 stars. The food was unique (almost to a fault) and the cocktails were great. If we go back I'd just be a bit more conscious of the alcohol tab, it got a bit overboard.", "author": "Kate N."}

I go to Bell Tower so much that I don't even have to look at the menu.  I used to watch sports at Parilla all the time because no one was ever there.  My hood needs another restaurant that serves good food and a stiff drink at a good prices.  I was hoping for a \"Nopa\" type spot.  That is not 1760.\n\nBring your wallet, but not your appetite guys.  This place is tailor made for foodies.  All the food and drinks are flavorful, but you'll pay for it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-26", "description": "Before I went, I read through some of the Yelp reviews and it seems that the most complaints come from the price/portion ratio.  This made ordering difficult: should we order 2 plates each and starve, or 3 plates each and cry over the bill later? \n\nWell, here is what I found out: first off, a party of four is the optimal size.  We ordered about 8 dishes plus one dessert, allowing ourselves to try most of the items on the menu.  We were pretty full by the end, but no one died from hunger or starvation.\n\nNothing was disappointing. To start with amuse buche - a slice of summery peach - was genius.   Nothing heavy, nothing complicated, simply sweet and divine. \n\nThen we shared the lighter dishes: octopus, ceviche, crab gazpacho, shishito peppers.  Everything was good and well balanced, but I loved the octopus the most.  Really tender, really flavorful. \n\nNow save some room for the heavier dishes: bucatini with uni, squash ravioli, pork belly and duck sandwich.  Everyone agreed that the bucatini with uni was amazing.  Pork belly was really awesome too.  Not dry, not too fat, just perfectly cooked. \n\nBy comparison, I wasn't that crazy about the chocolate ganache we had for dessert.  The plate presentation was gorgeous, but the burnt marshmallow made me feel like I was eating a candle.  (I know, weird, but it had that scent.)\n\nIn the end, we paid 55 each after tax, tips, and a few drinks.  Not bad, considering the quality of the food.  It felt like going through a well thought-out tasting menu without paying the high prices.  We were able to try a little bit of everything without stuffing ourselves silly.  \n\nJudging from the crazy wait on a random weeknight, I predict getting reservation here will become harder and harder.", "author": "Candice B."}

When we first arrived we were seated right away (we had reservations) however the hostess forgot menus. We sat there for about 5 minutes with no menus and no silverware. I ended up asking one of the bar backs for a menu. When our server finally came we ordered 2 specialty drinks. I got the Strawberry shrub and my boyfriend got The Garam Masala and Cardamom Cocktail. The Strawberry shrub was NOT good. Super sugary and just not pleasant. The server ended up comping it but no one order it. My boyfriend enjoyed his drink though. \n\nFor our meal we started with the Shisitos peppers which were good but kind of a pointless appetizer I think. They have some strong entrees but appetizers I think they can do better with. I know there \"tapas\" style but still if your going to have something on the menu like small quarter size peppers you can think of a better app.  Then we got Corn ravioli which was my favorite. The corn filling is incredible but please give us more. For $18 dollars there about 5 maybe 6 small little ones. Either make them bigger or cut the $18 dollars. Next we got the Hanger steak. Phenomenal. Lastly we got the Cavatelli. vinegar-braised pork. This is a pasta dish in case no one knows what Cavatelli is. Its pretty good as well. \n\nFor dessert we got the angel food cake. It was good but I herd the table next me to raving about the Milk chocolate Ganach so next time I'm trying that.", "author": "Jess O."}

First of all, parking is going to be an issue so maybe carpool if you don't live in the city.  There's been a lot of talk about how the cocktails are amazing but the one we ordered, 1760, did not work at all.  \n\nWe ordered a bunch of plates since they are for sharing.  Uni bucatini, cavatelli, pork belly, short rib, beef tartare, grilled octopus, fried duck sandwich and green tea bavarian.  The uni bucatini was the best dish, it did have enough uni and flavor but the rest of the dishes were disappointments.  The cavatelli had too much acid in there, the fried duck sandwich, you could not taste the duck, the pork belly tasted too much like pork from a Chinese deli market, the tartare was not memorable.  The worst dish we tried was the green tea bavarian.  The dish had too many notes, had such an awkward taste, it was not good at all.\n\nWait staff started out okay although because I was circling around, and ended up being a bit late while my wife waited, the hostess came over and told my wife we had to give them the table back at 8pm.  That started the meal on a somewhat negative note because I was never told when making the reservation we have to give the table back at 8pm and it's not like I didn't want to park my car.

We came here last night as a belated Christmas present and I couldn't have been more satisfied with my choice! Everything we tasted was EXCELLENT! I appreciate the level of attention our waiter gave us (including remembering to ask if either one of us had a food allergy). We started the meal with a couple cocktails and then immediately dove into some small plates. \n\nFor \"not dessert\" we split the tartare, crudo, maccheroni, carrots, and lobster ceviche and for later we each ate or own sweet (ganache for me, and warm banana bread for him). Honestly, the flavors were so complex and delicious my mouth was watering after every bite. I would say the chef has a strong affinity for citrus in each dish so if you are not keen of lime/lemon I would urge you to try a different restaurant.\n\nMy personal favorite plate was the maccheroni; my god, the intensity of the crab and lime was tongue tingling; I literally cannot stop thinking about this dish. Plate to skip would unfortunately be the tartare; while I feel like it was good, I don't believe it brought anything to the table I hadn't tried before (but don't get me wrong, still delicious). \n\nPrice point wise, I thought it was a tad on the expensive side for a 23 year old who is not making 6 figures in San Francisco but still completely reasonable. 7 plates, 4 drinks, and tip coming to just under $200 really isn't that bad.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-06", "description": "Wow a great new American restaurant in the Nob Hill area. Came here to catch up with a friend on a Thursday night, and this place was packed. Be sure to make a reservation in advance. But, if you are planning to do walk-in, there looked to be a large communal table at the front of the restaurant, which helps your chances.\n\n1760 suggests sharing dishes family style and for my party, they suggested doing around 4 plates. That being said for two people, unless you have extremely large appetites, I think you will be quite satisfied with 3. \n\nWe started with the lobster ceviche. This dish had a good size helping of lobster, perfect to share between two people. Nice acidic flavoring, but could have used a little more spice. Overall a nice light dish to begin the evening. Following, we had the crispy octopus. This was my favorite dish of the evening. It helps that I love octopus, but the portion-size was perfect. We were given a good amount of octopus in addition to a nice pad of rice underneath. If you are familiar with grilled octopus, this is the flavor and type of dish you should expect when ordering this item. It is not truly a crispy octopus (suggesting fried). Next, we had the uni. This was an interesting dish for me. It is very rich, and was a bit much for my palate. However, the first couple of bites were excellent, but the quantity is so large that after a while it lost its appeal and became overwhelming. We ended the night with the fried duck sandwich. This was supposedly the fan favorite dish, but I must stick to my guns and say that the octopus was the best. The fried duck sandwich was good, and reminded me of a crab cake sandwich. However, if I had one critique, I wish that the duck flavor came through a little more as it was a bit overpowered by the slaw. \n\nOverall, the food had great taste, but 4 stars as there are some improvements on flavoring that could be made. The environment is awesome, modern and chic, but you may find it a little loud, so don't plan on having an intimate quiet night out here. I will definitely add this to my list of places to revisit. I enjoyed the menu composition and saw a lot more dishes I hope to try. 1760 looks like it will be sticking around for a while.", "author": "Alex L."}

First off, the space is fantastic with high ceilings, lots of natural light, and comfortable seating.  The servers are also excellent, knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive to every detail.  The drink menu is relatively short but seems well put together - love the Gavroche being offered. \n\nHowever, the food seems pretty hit or miss - some dishes just blew us away with the flavors and creativity while others just seemed like a muddled mess.  We started out on a high note with the Lobster Ceviche, which is the best dish I've had in a long time - very fresh tasting, great mixture of flavors, and excellent presentation.  This was accompanied by the roasted Shishito Peppers an enjoyable but unremarkable dish - you generally can't go wrong with Shishito Peppers but I'm not sure the hazelnuts and olives did anything to enhance the dish.  The Fried Squid was an interesting dish, soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside - I really enjoyed the flavors but would of preferred if it was more chewy instead of soft like scallops.  \n\nFinally, the two disappointing dishes were the Hamachi Kama and Crab Macaroni.  The Hamachi Kama was a large portion but not strangely seasoned - the flavors generally didn't seem to compliment the fish and overall gave it a very \"fishy\" taste.  The Crab Macaroni was far too rich without much complexity - think white sauce with crab.  I could see some people enjoying this but it didn't work for me - I would skip both of these in the future.  \n\nAll in all a promising restaurant.

Our plates  had remnants of the first courses and chicken bones and of course we said yes.  The bus boy picked up our dirty plates and our bread plate, which we asked to keep.  The bread is $4 for a tiny loaf of 4 slices.  We were not finished with our bread and would have it with the pasta.  Food and crumbs were  on the table, but they put clean plates on it then wiped around it.  Not a big deal, but not professional.  \n\nAfter having the luke warm pasta, my husband spoke to Chelsea very nicely about how it is not her fault as to sequence, but the kitchen or manager should be aware of it.  I asked if there was a manager on duty and she said yes 2 of them were there.  She went about her buisness and never seemed to care.  After appetizers, usually pastas would follow and ending with the entree.  We were told the chicken would take 35 minutes, but figured the kitchen would time the meal accordingly.

However keep in mind that this is SF, and the culinary experience you undergo while visiting 1760 is reason enough for defending their price point.  I took someone on a date here and would gladly come back to celebrate a special occasion.  We started with the Lobster Bisque, which was aromatic and creamy, but not overpowering with flavor.  We then ordered four dishes to split,  the Brussel Sprouts, Pork Sisiq, Octopus Pasta, and Half Roasted Chicken.  The Octopus Pasta was my favorite, and the Burssel Sprouts were flaky and not too salty.  I'm not a huge pork fan, but the Pork Sisig definitely has me reconsidering my stance as it wasn't too fatty and possessed a delicate texture with each bite.  The Half Roasted Chicken was what you would expect so take that as you may.  We were given generous pours of Bedrock Zinfandels, which was recommended by our waiter/bartender after I expressed my love for Zins.  The dishes were well-portioned, and my date and I left without feeling the need to carry ourselves out in a wheel barrel.  Beyond enjoying the food, I appreciated the the attention to detail and presentation of the dishes being served.  The decor is modern and not too flashy; the pace and layout of the restaurant makes you feel relaxed and not too crowded; and the noise level is comfortable and does not require you to speak or yell over anyone to have an intimate conversation with your company.

I learned this from another fine-dining experience, but in case you didn't notice, \"raviolo\" means you are only getting one piece of \"ravioli.\" Yes, it's a larger piece of pasta, but just don't be surprised if you order it. The pasta itself is gray (Charcoal?) and filled with a nice, runny egg yolk. While it was very satisfying to break into the raviolo to get to the runnyness inside, I have to say that the pasta itself was a bit too 'al dente' for my liking. Another friend got the raviolo, and mentioned it was her least-favorite plate. The meat-eaters in my group got everything from ceviche to tartare and the duck sandwich, which they all seemed to enjoy.\n\nWe also split 2 desserts, which was another mixed bag. We all loved the Brown Butter Cake, but felt that the Peanut Butter Panna Cotte was a bit weird, texturally. (It's served with Jam and white chocolate, so almost like a PB&J?) \n\nThe service was decent, and we weren't made to feel rushed, as we were able to sit around and have conversation, even after the check was all paid. Overall, it was a satisfying meal. I didn't leave feeling hungry (as others had mentioned) but in all honesty, nothing wowed me enough to necessarily say I would go back, unless it was for a cocktail.", "author": "Bryan B."}

First, the menu is very small-- there is a burger in the picture here on yelp, but no burger on the menu. Second, the portions are shockingly small and overpriced. Third, we were placed at a community table which was awkward and uncomfortable. Despite all of that, the food was just not very good.

Palette was treated to an explosion of flavors. Watch out, though, cuz you may get a really hot one (like I did). Be sure to have your beer or water nearby.\n\nBrussels Sprouts in black vinegar with hazelnuts and prosciutto was just OK. I've had much better ones. The sprouts were not roasted enough for me. They were more like steamed/boiled. I prefer them roasted with the outer leaves caramelized and crispy.\n\nThe Kabocha Ravioli in a light coconut broth was deeelish! Pop the entire ravioli in your mouth with the broth and be treated to a mouthful of creamy sweet kabocha that tastes nutritious, fresh and light. (Ravioli flavor changes with seasonal vegetable)\n\nRoasted Baby Carrots were nicely caramelized and sweet. \n\nThe Grilled Pork Ribs in hoisin bbq sauce came right off the bones and melted in our mouths with a very slight kick at the end...nice.\n\nFavorite dish of the evening was the Grilled Pork Belly...melted in our mouths with the right amount of lean and fat. So flavorful. Wish I knew how to make this dish. Just thought portion was small compared to price.\n\nThe strawberries with charcoal cake was...well, not sure what to say except the cake actually had ground up charcoal in it that tasted gritty.\n\nThe cocktail menu is quite eclectic. I had the Pear-Ginger which boasted an enormous Campari ice cube that slowly melted. It was like 2 drinks in one. If you like ginger and grapefruit flavors, you must get this one. I may drop by just to enjoy another one, or two, of these when I'm in the city.\n\nOur server was superb! She explained all the menu items and made sure we had all that we needed throughout the evening.\n\nTip: \nEverything is meant to be shared.

I'm an octopus snob and this was delicious. Perfectly tender on the inside and the smoky char on the outside was wonderful.\n\nUni Buccatini -- 4 stars.  Neither of us are huge pasta fans, but the reviews on yelp had me sold for this dish. I also NEVER order uni out at sushi restaurants, so my boyfriend was really surprised when I wanted this dish.

We both love the very refined and romantic sister-restaurant Acquerello, and we were eager to check out their take on a casual spot.  Unfortunately, we were very disappointed.  The bottom line is that for the $185 we spent on dinner for two, including the tip, we could have had an exceptional meal at many other restaurants in the City instead of the mediocre one we got at 1760.\n\nThe restaurant had an upbeat vibe and was decorated okay, though it veered too much toward bare and unfinished, rather than chic minimalism. The music was super loud, like a club, so conversation was almost impossible.  The service was very good, and our server was friendly, attentive, and helpful with making choices.  The real weakness, and it is a major one for a restaurant, was the food.  The menu is made up of small plates, and we tried 6 (it seems like a lot of food, but most of the portions are very small), and not a single dish was a stand-out.  Even worse, four of the dishes were barely edible.  The chef seems to love putting huge quantities of sugar, salt, or vinegar (and sometimes all three) on nearly every dish.  Some dishes were cloyingly sweet, others were terribly salty, and a couple were drowning in vinegar.  I love sugar, salt and vinegar, but I don't want my meal to be overpowered with those ingredients.  Even the cocktails we tried were heavy on the sugar. Surprisingly, the dessert was the only thing that wasn't too sweet, but sadly the sponge cake I had was bland and mushy.  The goat cheese plate was pretty good, but you can't really mess up good cheese you bought from someone else.\n\nEven if the bill had been less, it still would not have been a value for the poor quality of food we got.

I love the small seasonal / local plates + artisan mixology. \n\nThe menu isn't separated into sections per se, but dishes get more substantial as you go. Sharing family style is a great way to go, and they recommended 2-3 dishes per person. The 2 of us ended up with 6 dishes, a dessert, and some cocktails, which ended up being a good amount. \n\nDrinks: \n- Meyer Lemon Fresno Chile: tart from the sauvignon blanc vinegar and lemon, slightly spicy\n- Mango and Spice: not as spicy as I had hoped with the long pepper, black pepper, and cayenne, but it wasn't too syrupy\n- Cucumber/grape: great for summer or in between courses as a palate cleanser\n- Pear and Ginger: love the red campari ice cube, which is a beautiful color. It has pretty pungent ginger flavor\n\nFood: \n- Amuse bouche: hot and sour celery with blue cheese, eaten in one bite with your fingers, tasted exactly as it was described. I love blue cheese, so for me, it was a good way to get my appetite going \n- Warm pears: initially sounded a bit generic, but we gave it a try anyway, and it turned out to be the BEST dish of the night.  The pears were cooked just to the right texture, the goat cheese on the side of the bowl was just the right amount, and the smoked pomegranate and lightly dressed fris\u00e9e helped to lighten it a bit\n- Lobster ceviche: it came with a good amount of fresh lobster meat, accompanied by avocado, pineapple, kaffir lime. I prefer the lobster unadulterated, so I could have done without the cream underneath, but overall, it was a nice take on lobster\n- Duck egg: fried, runny yolk, served on top of smoked salmon with Meyer lemon creme fraiche and perfectly textured croutons. You really do need to get each component in each bite to make the dish, and I wish it could have somehow come with more runny egg yolk \n- Pork belly: creative, served like a southern BBQ theme. There was a coleslaw pur\u00e9e underneath and a purple potato salad (great colors, fancy version of picnic and BBQ foods). The flavor on the pork belly was great, and it wasn't completely fatty, which was nice. The berry gelee on the side also went well with the pork\n- Cavatelli: we debated between this and the uni pasta, but as it was the first colder / rainy night, we went with the more Italian comfort food style dish.  The pasta was fresh, cooked al Dante, and the vinegar braised pork was interesting. Still, I would have preferred a pork ragu, since the dish became pretty acidic in combination with the tomatoes\n- Fried duck sandwich: essentially a duck burger. I like that they didn't just use a rich brioche or else it would have been too much.  The slaw was just ok, remoulade was also ok, but I loved the pickles.  Sadly, it did not come with fries \n\nFor dessert, the peanut butter panna cotta was a very unique creation. With the fruit and berries, you would expect a PB+J kind of taste, but the panna cotta itself was light, and the peanut butter taste was subtle. However, once you add the white crunchy bits on top, you get not only texture but a good peanut butter kick. This is definitely one of the more unique and memorable desserts I've had lately.\n\nOur server was so pleasant and attentive, and when cocktails took a while, he took care of the delayed drinks for us. He also kept checking into see if we liked our selections, and he changed our plates multiple times as we progressed through the meal.  Pacing of food was good, and they've definitely gotten the hang of things there. \n\nEven though 1760 is located supposedly in nob hill, it's not impossible to park around here, especially as it gets later on a weeknight.  It's definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and it's perfect either for a small group or a date.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-19", "description": "3.5 stars.\nI was a little wary after reading some of the reviews, but was generally pretty pleased with our early Wednesday night dinner at the bar of 1760.\nI think the criticisms of portion size vs. price are a bit unfounded (if you think the value at 1760 is bad, don't go to Waiheke!).  Sizes were not huge but they were far from small.  We are big eaters, and we were full after 6 items between us, each around $10-$15 (tapas style, but larger than tapas servings).  \nWe'd read raves about the corn ravioli and were a bit disappointed with it - filling was heavenly but the pasta was thick, chewy and cold.  Our favorite thing was probably the duck burger - delicious and quite large ($15).  The steak tartare was a mixed bag - the almond spread was pretty yucky and threatened to ruin the fabulous meat and salad.  Speaking of salad - all the little salad accompaniments were fantastic. Do not ignore them! Some fabulous things happening there. Besides the duck burger all the dishes we tried had some high and low points.  None were bad, but all needed a tweak or two.  \nDrinks were delicious but didn't go so well with the food.  If possible, I'd suggest waiting to eat until after cocktails are done.  I was concerned when I saw the very short and largely foreign wines by glass list, but was very pleasantly surprised after tasting a couple - great picks.\nService was exceptionally friendly and attentive if a touch confused at times.  There were a lot of people behind the bar with big variations in training and menu knowledge.  Our service didn't really suffer too much, but it was obvious that a couple of the people weren't quite ready for prime time.  Hopefully they'll get their legs quickly, as the crowds were piling in when we left around 7pm. \nAtmosphere is casual, modern and airy - liked it.", "author": "Ellen H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-03", "description": "We arrived a little early and ordered drinks at the bar while waiting to be seated.  The restaurant is gorgeous and ambience very conducive to chatting over a cocktail with friends. We took advantage of the community style seating at the front of the restaurant looking out onto Washington Street. The pear-ginger cocktail with Campari ice cube was perfect - not too sweet, refreshing, and not at all syrupy. It being Negroni week, they also had an impressive menu of variations on and including the classic Negroni.  There was a slight wait to be seated, but the staff were friendly, very attentive and seated us as soon as our table was ready.  We ordered the hamachi, mushroom cavatelli, roasted chicken, fingerling potatoes, and spring peas.  The hamachi was of course gone in a second, and we enjoyed the additional ceviche dish for the wait on our table.  What stood out the most to me was the texture of the cavatelli that matched the mushrooms perfectly.  The lightness of the accompanying sauce was a perfect complement to the cavatelli.  The whole roasted chicken was done well and again, the sauce provided a perfect complement with its creamy but somewhat tart flavor.  Both fingerling potatoes and spring pea dishes were also done well - combining the inherent flavors of the ingredients with light seasoning for a just right taste - but my mind kept turning back to the flavoring of those sauces....sooo good but not quite traditional.  We had a great meal, and I left wishing I could have tried a little of everything else on the menu.  Clearly, I would definitely come back for more.", "author": "Christine T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-16", "description": "in three words, our experience was: Overpriced. Lackluster. Disappointing.\n\nMy husband and I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. It's always been too busy for us to get a reservation at a reasonable hour on a night we've decided to go out. We've figured that, because it's always busy, it must be good. The menu usually looks pretty appealing. We finally went last night because my brother was in town visiting. Given the overall rating, I was hopeful that it was be a great meal... we were sorely disappointed.\n\nAfter telling the waiter it was our first time at the restaurant, he urged us to order \"two or three items per person,\" which seemed ridiculous to us, given the prices on the menu ranging from $9 - $42 a plate. We ended up ordering three items -- the lobster ceviche, the fried duck sandwich, and the pork belly (plus the $5 bread and whipped pork fat, which was 5 small slices of bread). My husband ordered a cocktail.\n\nWhen the lobster ceviche arrived, we understood why he told us to order more food. The proportion was miniscule.. and for $19... ridiculous. I was also turned off that the menu didn't indicate that the ceviche had cilantro in it--some people (including me) have a major aversion to cilantro--and it turned me off of the dish completely. It's one word. Add it to your menu if it's in a dish you're serving. While the duck sandwich and pork belly were more reasonable entree proportions, they were not worth the price tag. Pork belly is a hot menu item right now, and a place with prices like this should nail it....but it was off--like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a few too many minutes. It was room temperature when it arrived at our table. The duck sandwich was good, but not great. Our bill was over $100, and we left hungry--ending up going elsewhere for more food that didn't cost an arm and a leg.\n\nOur service was as lackluster as the food. Once our waiter realized we wouldn't be racking up a $500 bill (just a $100 one, as it turned out), our service felt rushed. We had multiple, different people delivering food and bussing our table. My husband told our waiter not to take his unfinished drink, and moments later, another man walked by the table and snagged his unfinished cocktail without asking. The only kudos I can give our waiter is keeping our water glasses full--considering that was the only thing my brother and I were drinking. \n\nThere are way too many choices in the city for a place like this to survive. Maybe there's a market out there of clientele that can afford it, but it certainly isn't \"affordable\" by any means, and I don't think it belongs in the neighborhood. Sad to say, we will NOT be returning to 1760.", "author": "Allyson U."}

My dessert, a chocolate ganache, was decent, if not at the same level as the pastas.\n\nOther aspects of the dinner experience were fantastic as well.  The restaurant is spacious, the bar area and its noise is separated from the main dining area, and the service is top notch.  Would definitely return to try all the other options on the menu.", "author": "Josh Q."}

But in its effort to be innovative, it lost the most important thing- to actually have decently tasting food. We had the goat cheese, ribs, and hanger steak. 1) I have never had goat cheese that I did not like- outside of this restaurant. 2) the ribs were a bad take on some Thai food- they should have left it to the Thai restaurants, 3) my mom had her first bite of the steak  and just said, \"it's so chewy.\" The steak is paired with a tomatoes and green onions that are cold, so not only was it chewy, it was also cold. I rarely write reviews, but I just felt it was a crime to take out $90 for such horrible food. Please don't waste your money.", "author": "Meagan C."}

The entire service staff was extraordinarily helpful and personable. It was an especially nice touch to have Gianpaolo,the friendly and charismatic owner pour our wine and stay for a bit of conversation toward the end of the meal.

He seems to have it all under control.\n\n  The ambience is spare, sophisticated and chic, with perfect music and lighting for contemporary city dining. Polk Street has never looked so good as it does from the inside of the tall, curved windows that comprise the front wall.\n\nEvery dish was outstanding,beautifully presented, and very generous portions...The octopus was a favorite...but so was the hamachi, beef tartare, the peppers, brussels sprouts...The chocolate reinvention of s'mores was  sublime. All the basics had been turned on edge just enough to make them new and remarkable.\n\nThere were dishes I would still like to try ,an extensive wine list,...and I won't forget  about  the enticing  cocktails that might draw me in some evening.\n We are so lucky to live in the neighborhood...we will certainly go back! \n\nWe are long time clients of Acquerello, with great affection and respect for their  enduring example of Italian food  and  service at its finest. \nWe have to give a nod to Giancarlo Paterlini and Suzette,the owners of  Acquerello for their great influences.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-10-22", "description": "Let me start by saying that I have been to 1760 twice and I have noticed a sharp decilne in the overall food experience. Our party was composed by four european adults, and we all had similar negative feedbacks by the end of dinner: 1760 is rapidly becoming more focused on its appearance than its substance. Example: a waitress hired to decant food like a muse becomes a joke when the menu itself doesn't support (for either quality/quantity) her effort. \"Folks, our menu is family-style (a phrase I can't stand anyway since it reminds me of the Olive Garden's Tv ads) and I'll recommend to order a few plates to share among the four of you\". To start, we decided to share a Lobster Ceviche and a Burrata. The Ceviche arrived in a plate the size of Texas. Imagine looking at the map of Texas and locate the city of Dallas in the center: all in proportion, that was our micro Ceviche! With a renewed \"spirit of family\", we asked for a magnifier lens and we split it in four! Next the Burrata. With great joy, Burrata is becoming more and more popular nowadays. Burrata is a delicate and simple milk product from the Puglia region of Italy. The beauty of some of the simplest italian food is its genuine flavor. The dish presented at 1760 was everything but simplicity: the poor Burrata was hidden under a quarter pound of yellow/red peppers, and trapped with some mint on top of a Pugliese bread slice. Few more unidentified objects layed on top of it. Don't get me wrong, not a bad appetizer, but don't call it Burrata, since you couldn't taste it at all. Instead, call it Peperonata (which is a real italian dish made with peppers)! Our group at this point decided to abandon the decanted \"family style concept\" and move on as hungry individuals to attack the main entrees: incredibly enough we all ordered the same. Cavatelli pasta with smoked lobster mushroom drowned in tomato sauce! Not complaining about the quantity on this occasion (it would have been different if we had to share this again) we focused on the quality: 2 stars at the most! The ingredients per-se weren't bad, but they didn't blend well as a whole. In other words, we could taste every single ingredient without being able to appreciate the final product. The sauce didn't stick to the pasta, just like going to a concert where the acoustic is bad. Sure, the band is famous, you can hear the electric guitar, the drummer is explosive but you can't understand the singer and the result is not harmonius. This is how we felt when we left. In such a food-competitive environment, good luck to 1760.", "author": "Giorgio E."}

I've already been twice in the first week and I've been remarkably impressed with how well things are going given the recent opening. Let's get down to the details:\n\nSliced Hamachi - Delicious, fresh, great raw fish dish.\nShishito Peppers - you can find these on many a menu, but the inclusion of ground hazelnuts sprinkled atop the peppers was a welcome addition\nBeef Tartare - With marcona almonds and chilis. One of the best dishes on the menu. As someone who rarely orders beef tartare, not only was I pleasantly surprised, but I would absolutely order it again. A signature dish to be sure.\nCorn Ravioli - YOU MUST ORDER. This dish will take you back to your childhood. Home cooking comfort food in a sophisticated modern dish. \nWarm Potato Salad - Again, ORDER THIS. It's something I'd never think of ordering at a restaurant but it was DELICIOUS. Smoked egg is a perfect complement to the potatoes. Do it.\nFried Duck Sandwich - THE SIGNATURE DISH. IF YOU ORDER NOTHING ELSE, ORDER THIS SANDWICH. It's perfect. Slaw, pickles, spicy aoili.

I didn't enjoy the potatoes as much as the person I was dining with; I thought they were a bit dry and bland.  The cavatelli, one of the larger dishes on the menu, was flavorful, rich and creamy.  I'd get it again, for sure.  I also tried a cocktail, the 1760, which I really enjoyed!  Our server explained it as similar to a mojito but with mescal, which I thought was pretty spot on.

I was excited to try out this new restaurant, but underwhelmed by every aspect of the experience. The staff was eager to smile, but fell short when it came to describing the menu. A standard script was given by each waitress (we cycled through two) and the food runner when we asked about their favorite dishes. The brussel sprouts were cooked beyond recognition, over salted, and flavored with an excessive about of oil. The duck sandwich was tasty, but also dripped grease and left my mouth dry from salt. The one saving grace was the tuna sashimi. My visit made me miss the days of La Parilla. A cheap and dirty mexican restaurant that delivered tasty food without the contrived grey paint job and the over priced food.", "author": "Marc U."}

The first few bites of the sandwich was rich and heavy also pickles that were topped on the duck confit patty was too sour and over powering.\n\nBUT what was amazing was the cocktails and dessert! \nI had the mango and spice and pear and ginger cocktails, both very refreshing and has an interesting  after taste. So cocktails are highly recommend. \nWe decided to try the dessert since we still had space for something sweet. \nWe ordered the carrot cake and milk chocolate ganache. Both very well\nPlated and presented, very cool form of deconstructed desserts and has many different components and textures which made both desserts very Interested impressive. \n I would say the desserts probably made up for the over salty courses and small portions of the savoury courses.\nWhether to return to this restaurant is debatably, as I feel the price we paid for this dinner would have given me a five star dinner elsewhere.", "author": "Rania H."}

Found this place on Eater app, and decided to give it a try and so glad we did. Reservation is a must. Everything was fantastic. The service was great, our waiter was friendly, helpful, and attentive. The manager came by a few times to check on us and answered the few questions that we had. The food and the cocktails were even better if that's possible. We started with two cocktails, The 1760 and the Pear Ginger. They were perfect drinks to get the night started. After the drink, we ordered a bottle of red wine per recommendation of the manager and it paired perfect with the rest of our dinner. So glad we asked for his opinion on the wine list, which was almost too overwhelming to say the least. Now, we need to talk about the food. Between the two of us, we had 5 entrees total and we still wish our stomachs were bigger so we  could try more. The food were mean to be shared, so the portions were perfect, not too small but not big which still left some room in our stomach for the next entree. We got the hamachi crudo, Shishito peppers, crispy octopus,  BBQ pork belly, and fried duck sandwich. Everything was just amazing. If there was one complaint, at least on my part, was that the duck was a bit on the salty side. However I would over look that since the rest of the meal was phenomenal.", "author": "Hai T."}

Mostly I am annoyed that my waitress suggested my dining companion and I order FIVE dishes with 4 of them in the \"medium to heavy\" range, one of which was their famous duck sandwich which is entirely massive and would have been enough with just TWO other dishes (not four other dishes!!!!).  It was WAY too much food, we paid WAY too much money, we returned the entire duck sandwich to the kitchen in its entirely after I ate one single bite (she was too full to even try it).  I felt queasy when I realized how wrong our waitress had steered us (and we had asked for guidance!!!) and paid the tab ($175 for two people including tip!!!) and ran out the door feeling, frankly, totally robbed.  The time before this visit we didn't realize the dishes we were ordering were minuscule and not nearly enough food.  Overall this place is confusing and chaotic to dine at in my opinion.  Will never come back and am disappointed this can't be one of a my favorite new neighborhood places (as this is my neighborhood).  It is also very, very expensive in my opinion.

They really did a good job of incorporating the Uni. The lobster ceviche was delectable as well, it was an interactive dish. We nearly had half of their menu. The lollipop kale was fun and a little off the beaten path of kale dishes. Nice use of the soy sauce with this dish. The one dish that was not as impressive was the Uni macaroni. They dish was way too heavy to be paired with Uni. Uni is so buttery and unique by itself, the cream sauce in this dish drowned out the lightness of the Uni, this dish made me sad, I felt like I wasted the uni. We also had the bucatini but that dish didn't stand out. The octopus was highly recommended but I wasn't impressed by it. It was fried, a little on the dry side and nothing to write home about in my opinion. We had the chocolate ganache caramel dessert which looked more like a piece of art than food. I had the pear ginger campari cocktail that was surprisingly on the sweet side... I usually love sweet girlie drinks. next I got the Disaronno cocktail (when was the last time I saw disaronno!!!) and it was alright. I agree with a previous post, the interior reminds me of NOPA without the top floor, the bar and glass partition is very similar. Maybe I'll be back for the fried duck sandwich and the monk fish liver which they were out of. Top service and unique casual attire on the servers.

The balance between the pear and burrata was delicious! Definitely a must.\nMaccheroni- Good, but nothing too special? \nMilk Chocolate Ganache - The server described this as \"Deconstructed Smore\", and I have to say that this was one of the best desserts that I've had. The combination of textures and different tastes with the ganache was delicious. My friend and I actually contemplated ordering a second round before we thought about our New Year's Resolutions.\n\nThe 1760 - I was worried about the Mezcal in the drink as I'm not a huge fan, but it was a pleasant and mild kick to the cocktail.\nMango and Spice - Great balance of sweet and spicy.\nGaram Masala-Cardamom - Definitely an interesting cocktail, but I think that the spices were a little much for me in the drink.\n\nOn the whole, I thought that the space was nice and enjoyed the service; however, I think that the food was definitely not up to par with the reviews and comments that I've heard.

I understand that tapas style dishes are intended to be shared, but the way they were brought to us didn't really make sense.  After at least 30 minutes they brought both veggie dishes, then 30 minutes later the octopus and another 30 minutes later the pork.  I would have like to have a bite of this and a bite of that, but it wasn't possible - and the huge gaps between having food available to eat  was just ridiculous.
