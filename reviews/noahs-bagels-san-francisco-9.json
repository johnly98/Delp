I look at my other choices and There were dark roast no flavor coffee, medium roast vanilla hazelnut, and a medium roast decaf. I notified the staff and they said they could make a new pot, great!, right? So she kindly fills my cup from the brewing coffee system and hands it to me, however there are tons of coffee grinds in it. I bring it back to her and she give me a new cup, YAY, I thank her and sit down to enjoy my garlic bagel with garden vegetable schmeer, and it was fantastic. They were out of most bagels, so if you are picky, get there early. My biggest complaint is that they never did put out the freshly brewed coffee, so for every cup I wanted to refill, I had to ask them to do it, which wouldn't be a problem if they weren't so focused on their closing duties. By The recycling bins were covered with paper bags when I arrived at 2, we could only throw our trash into one garbage can. I asked what time they close and was told they were \"typically out by 5\" another customer asked the same question, so it wasn't just me that noticed the closing duties being done so early. I also noted that the dark roast was empty a few minutes after the medium roast and that was not put back out either, even though they still had 3 hours til close.", "author": "A L."}

She thought I wanted a different bagel so put the bagel back and asked me which flavor I wanted instead. I explained to her again that she had just handled the raw eggs without changing gloves so I wanted her to change gloves before making my bagel. She said ok and then grabbed the same bagel and started making it again without changing gloves. I tried to clarify again and then decided to cut my losses and walk out.

Maybe flying a bald eagle during the Fleet Week Air Show, crushing a bud-heavy, and singing \"Party in the USA\" while wearing your 'star spangled and hammered' frat mason tank top...just maybe.\n\nThere is nothing I crave more on a weekend morning in the 94123 than a delicious Sausage Egg and cheese sandwich. So I figured why not review all of them within my non-uberX and non-dirty 30 walking distance bubble from my apartment? It is the least I can do as a \"K\" parking sticker displaying patriot of the neighborhood.\n\nNoah's Bagels: Everyone at one point has walked into Noah's and been overwhelmed by the massive bagel selection. Seems like there is everything from wheat, to jalape\u00f1o cheddar, to butter-beer bagels that you can choose to put your breakfast sandwich between. In the past, I have tried the \"Sante Fe Bagel Sandwich\" which includes a sausage patty, sant\u00e9 fe sauce, and pepper jack cheese. What it does not include is a packet of \"tums\". If you are not like me and can handle a fire bomb to the gut at 9am, then I recommend the sant\u00e9 fe sandwich all the way. It gives you a kick of spice while also including the three main food groups: Sausage, Cheese, and heartburn.\n\nIf you are like me and want something that will not keep you out of commission for the next six hours I recommend the Egg White \"thintastic\" Sandwich with turkey Sausage. It was fairly light on the grease and isn't quite the gut bomb since you get the egg whites. The only interesting thing was that half of my sandwich had cream cheese on it too? Maybe it was a mistake, or maybe they don't like Redheads. Either way, it was a decent sandwich and I give the sandwich itself 4 stars. The rest of the Noah's experience brought down the review to 3 stars due to the fact that there were a large amount of sticky kids that were in Noah's at the same time as my girlfriend and I. They also messed up her coffee, and if you mess up her order, well then, that is going to cost you a star.\n\nUntil next time Noah's!", "author": "Matt E."}

Remember the part in the beginning where she goes to the diner with Harry and requests all these different options for her salad and apple pie?\n\nI walked into Noah's with my friend, who was visiting from Boston.  We were looking for a quick bite to eat, preferably outside, since we had my dog with me.  We took turns going into Noah's to order, and I decided that what I really wanted was to be moderately healthy, so I decided on a breakfast sandwich.\n\nThe breakfast category had sandwiches, paninis and wraps.  I wanted the Swiss, Spinach and Mushroom sandwich ($4.65), but I could already tell that the ingredients would probably squish out from between the bread, so I told her I wanted it in the whole wheat wrap instead.  The following language-barrier-riddled conversation ensued:\n\nCashier: Ok, your total is $6.87.\nMe: What??  The sandwich is only $4.65, plus tax it can't be that amount.\nC: Veggie wrap $5.95.\nM: Where does it say on the menu that it's $5.95?  Clearly it says $4.65 *points to menu*\nC: No, you ordered veggie wrap.\nM: No, I wanted the SANDWICH but in a wrap.\nC: No no there are panini.\nM: Okay, look.  I want THAT ONE.  $4.65.  In a wrap instead of on bread.\nC: Yeah so you order veggie wrap.  $5.95.\nM: Forget it.\n\nThe difference was really like a dollar, so I let it go, but it's the principle behind it.  Sorry Asian woman, there goes the dollar in your tip jar.\n\nWhen my wrap came, it was insanely hot and I couldn't eat it right away.  It was filled with egg, tomatoes, a bit of spinach and potatoes.  Not entirely exciting, but not bad either.

On the rare occasions they do actually toast it, it seems that the toaster conveyor is still on super-sonic speed and they just crank up the heat.  The result is a burned outside and barely warm interior.  I'd be happy to wait the extra 2-3 minutes it would take to slow down the toaster conveyor and get a nice evenly browned bagel.  \n\nI always double check with the girl (or guy) that hands me the finished product by asking \"double toasted?\"  They smile and dubiously answer \"yes\".  I'm sitting here right now with a horrid bagel - scorched black on the outside and not even warm inside.  How to do they manage to screw something up so badly?\n\nPerhaps the worst part of this location (I would easily manage to overlook this if they properly toasted my bagel) is the horrible manager (or so I believe her to be so....).

So I called the Chestnut store in SF at 6:30 am the next morning to order the boxes to be prepared so that I could PICK IT UP in time for a meeting at 7:30 am.  The woman at Chestnut Street said she could not prepare the bagel boxes for me because the stores get too busy.  I'd need to buy their pre-made bagel boxes.  I wasn't happy, but what could I do.  I asked for one container of OJ.  She said she could not give me more than 1 cup,  because there were events in SF that weekend and they expected crowds.  She said I needed to order the 2 qts of OJ a few days earlier.  I told her about the mess that Catering had caused for me, and that I did order earlier, but she said no.  To save time, I requested to prepay for the order over the phone, but she refused because she expected crowds at any minute (this is before 7 am on a Sunday) and that it was against company policy.  When we drove by the store at 7:15 am, Noah's was empty.  \n\nI felt like I was in the Twilight Zone. I've ordered and pre-payed for bagel boxes from this branch before with no problem.  I told her this and reminded her of the mess Catering had caused for me.  She wasn't interested and said if she found out who the employee was who let me prepay and preorder bagel boxes, she'd make sure they were reprimanded!   At this point I was exasperated/livid.  This woman didn't care about the customer and did not seem to have a concept of service. \n \nI ended up not purchasing anything from Noah's and went to Peet's Coffee across the street instead.   Their staff were incredibly professional.  My pre-ordered coffee tubs were waiting for me at the counter with the receipts attached.  Their staff even helped carry everything to the car.  Noah's needs to learn customer service skills from Peets.  I'll never order from them again for my events/meetings even though I've been a customer for 10+ years.   To add insult to injury, my credit card was charged for the order I never received.  I called to ask for a refund which they promised to make.  It's been 10 days, and I still have not received the refund.  What a nightmare.", "author": "DJ Y."}

I used to love Noahs years ago, but after living in NY for the past 8 years and having \"real\" bagels every day, I was pretty disappointed when I returned to Noahs. I don't think the bagels changed, I think I just found out what a real bagel should be. What I don't like about Noah's is that they are just too doughy and not crispy enough on the outer shell of the bagel. They're also just too big.They do have good cream cheese though.", "author": "Mary C."}

Noah's bagels are yummy, cheesy toasted bread goodness.  They serve them with eggs if you'd like.  It's up to you. You can even have a bagel wrapped around a hot dog here.  How clever.  People who hate Noah's because they do not make real NY bagels need to learn to open their hearts to a wider variety of bagel options.  After all, when it comes down to it, they're all made of yeast, flour, and water.  And some other stuff.", "author": "Amanda B."}

Their sandwiches are really good and it used to have outstanding service which wold explain the long but fast moving lines.  However, it has really gone downhill in the last month or so.  Two visits ago I ordered a hot sandwich that was never heated.  This last time I got a bagel and cream cheese but there was hardly any cream cheese on it.  If you pay nearly $5.00 for a cup of coffee, a bagel and cream cheese, shouldn't you get a fair amount of cream cheese?  Shouldn't it look remotely like the picture?  Both times I was shoved out the door as fast as they could get me out of there.  It looks to me like an outstanding manager of the place has moved on and now there are all new people working there that are still learning their jobs.  I get that  people do need time to learn their job but I'm just saying this place isn't the fabulous place it used to be.", "author": "Chris W."}

Fortunately, an order this simple is hard to screw up and as a result they hardly ever do screw it up (the rare error being barely any butter).

I love Noah's bagels and have been going there in each of the 3 different cities I've lived in the past 10 years. I normally like the Marina Noah's. This morning, however was different. I came in at 9am but it wasn't completely packed; ordered a large coffee only to find out that each of the 5 coffee containers was out of coffee. Ended up making a mix of everything as they didn't seem to be too concerned about refilling them. Whatever. Then I get my bagel, go home, open up the paper, and nearly 1/4 of it is burned to a crisp -- literally, it is black, and there is a whole burned through the top. Any normal food establishment would not serve a burned piece of food; but apparently they saw nothing wrong with this.
