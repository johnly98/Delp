My only gripe is that they took down the pricing on their wall menu so you get hit by a number where the toast costs closer to a meal than a snack. SF at its finest. However, I would come back. It makes me savor each bite. The quality in here feels high so the price matches. Simple yet good quality items. I've tried also the avocado toast and the matcha chai (why didn't I think of this before? My two favorite drinks in one!) and then the Milk and Honey. All were very great.\n\n-1 Star for the pricing.

This place was always packed on the weekends so I assumed that it would be amazingly delicious.  That being said, it was not quite up to my expectations.  I ordered the following:\n\nSalmon Toast: smoked salmon on a dill cream spread with sprouts\nPROS:\n- dill spread did not overwhelm me with the taste of ... all herb.  Dill in particular, can be very strong so the balance needs to be just right.\n- toast was not soggy meaning it was fresh made and came out quick\n- side salad was a nice refreshing touch given that the toast itself was on the heavier end of the meal\nCONS: \n- it'd be nice to have a little more salmon.  I realize smoked salmon is expensive, but even the bagels in NYC have more salmon and that's a staple for the city.  Not to mention, the price for this salmon toast was equivalent if not more than what I would get for a similar item.  \n\nThe one thing that I didn't quite like was the limited seating.  Inside had one large table with wall seats (as in a bench built into the window).  Private seating was located outside with maybe three small tables.  If the weather is bad which, can actually happen in the Bay, it doesn't bode well for eating in (or out rather).  Given that I live across the street, my toast probably would be able to survive the soggy-test had I decided to take my order to-go.  \n\nOverall, it's nice but I wouldn't wait in line here on the weekend for this.", "author": "Vera L."}

That's San Francisco for you.\n\nAfter reading about the small interior and long lines I thought it best to just order the food to-go and eat in our room.  I tried to call but got only a recording, so I walked over to place an order there.\n\nThe inside is as small inside as everyone says, one four-top table with seating for six (figure that out).  So while I stood in line next to the table, in the only walkway there was, directly in the way of the server bringing food out to the folks outside, I didn't see the appeal.  It's cramped, small, and you're always in the way of someone...but they had some good looking breakfast options and gluten-free bread, so in line, I stood.\n\nThe guys working the counter were nice enough, though it's obvious it's a small space and they have to work to make it all work, which would drive me nuts.\n\nI got the Daily Toast for my fiance, and it looked really good.  Not quite as good in the to-go box as it does on a plate (based on other Yelp photos) but she said it was really good nonetheless.\n\nI had the salmon toast, which is essentially an open-faced sandwich with some cream cheese, salmon, onions and a side of arugula.  It was okay, but nothing I feel I need to get again or recommend you get.  I know gluten-free bread isn't the same, and I get that, it was fine, but I am glad I only waited about 10 minutes to get it.  I'd have been way bummed if we waited longer, or ate there, as I hate being in the way while I eat.  \n\nWhen I got my boxes, the guy realized I had too much to carry and offered to get me a bag, which I accepted and he paced everything in for me which was a big help.\n\nSo if you get the food to-go, eat somewhere cozy, you'll be happy with your choice.  I can't speak to standing and waiting and sitting there and eating.  I think I'd just go somewhere else instead.\n\nWe also had americanos, which were served in tiny paper cups, maybe the size of a Tall from Starbucks, too small for me, but it was better than drip from the hotel.\n\nAll in all, I think the food was good, not great, though my fiance said hers was great, I would be willing to try something else in the future, though to be fair, most of those things involve croissants, which I don't eat, so I'll probably not be back.", "author": "Luke W."}

I stopped in for coffee and the daily toast (before yoga, naturally). The toast was a huge slice of brioche with a whipped marscapone topping and a variety of fruit. Each one seems different; I saw a few go out and I think mine was the only one with grapefruit. I would have preferred to know in advance what my topping would be, but I guess that's part of the fun. Coffee was ok, if a little burnt-tasting. A cheaper and similar alternative exists at Starbucks. \n\nInterior is tiny with just one communal table and a cream/sugar bar. There are a few tables and a window bar outside but this place is made for food and coffee on the go. \n\nWorth a try for a light but filling breakfast.", "author": "Kate D."}

The restaurant is so tiny to the point of being uncomfortable. You are always in someone's way and the large communal table takes up most of the floor space indoors. I can enjoy the quirkiness of a small space making do, but it honestly just felt annoying as there's no real counter and whoever is cashier has to step in or out of the kitchen to the restaurant at any given time depending on delivery of food. \n\nThe menu is pretty straightforward but it's only written on the wall and boards so you can study it ahead of time (again without being in the way) and additionally, there are NO PRICES. We got two toasts, a drink, and a tart (its quiche) for $50. Are you kidding me? I respect that this is an expensive city but honestly it was not worth it. \n\nThe famed daily toast that I see tons of photos of was good, salmon toast  was so so. The tart was ordered vegetarian but we got a bacon slice - when I brought this the their attention they were gracious and gave us a veggie slice. However when I ate the salad on my salmon toast, it didn't have dressing... its like the entire experience was if you get one thing right, there will be another thing wrong to cancel it out. It was a slightly exhausting experience because additionally, the staff were having their own conversations that were totally fine, but given their high volume and slightly less professional subject matter, i would have preferred to just have my orders right and not have to hear it. I think they could have had their conversations quieter or maybe out of the line of customers being able to hear. \n\nI know this all sounds harsh but I just did not love anything about the visit. I couldn't wait to leave because the whole experience felt like a hassle. \n2 stars for the food being good and them correcting whatever mistakes were made in the process, but overall, not worth going back again (or arguably, visiting in the first place)", "author": "Ashley G."}

The guys behind the counter are friendly and positive. The menu is simple and easy however the food itself is anything but. This is not boring and bland. The items are fantastic and will absolutely bring your taste buds alive!!\n\nLet's start with the Daily Toast! Sounds like a show or some theme music  should accompany the presentation and delivery of this side dish.  I ordered mine with fruit. This was not just fruit! The mascarpone cream on the toast is absolutely scrumptious and an incredible complement to the toast that is about 1.5-2 inches in height. Thick toast here! Also, the toast has a nice and complementary sweetness to it which is great with the cream and fruits. Ah, the fruits... grapes, berries, mandarin oranges, granola, and thinly sliced apples oh my!! What a presentation!\n\nI also enjoyed the croissant egg  sandwich based on another yelper that had both and was very happy with the choice. This sandwich has delicious ham (not just any ham), mixed greens, hard boiled egg (halved) and some delicious spread on it that was simply tangy and something I'd want to bottle and take home to the family! BTW, this sandwich is not huge and while i went for the gusto with my order the sandwich alone might not have done it for me. I feel a little on the full side now but that's ok. I'm only here for a super short trip and wanted to experience these two fantastic menu items!!\n\nThe latte!!  while at most places, this drink costs a latte I would say in SF this is a fair price! I had the mocha which has a local chocolate  cocoa to it. This was great and so was the design. I sipped before taking the picture... sorry! \n\nGreat job to the gang at Farm to Table!! Loving your concept and menu!! We will be back!! Cheers!!", "author": "LouCindy A."}

It did not disappoint -- food was scrumptious, prices were reasonable, quite a variety of food and and coffees to choose from and good conversations with strangers at the farm table. \n\n- Food: Of course, I have to start off with the Daily Toast (Pain de Mie topped with a houseblende flavored marscapone topped with a variety of marker fruits and pistachios) ($7.95). It seems like this is one of Farm Table's most popular items, and it certainly did not disappoint. \n\nIt comes on a thick slice of toast and is filling. Love the light sweetness that the marscapone adds, which compliments the fresh and tasty fruit atop it. If this is your first time visiting Farm Table, certainly get the Daily Toast. \n\nThe other item I ordered was the Egg on Croissant (Petulma Cheese, Farmer's Market Boiled Egg, Topped with Market Greens, homemade creme fraiche and avocados) ($7.95). This was also absolutely delicious! It was a smaller portion, but the the Croissant and buttery, flaky and warm, and everything inside of it blended very well. \n\nThis wasn't as filling as the Daily Toast, but definately recommend it nonetheless. Would recommend getting a latte or a complimentary item if you're going to order this. \n\n- Coffee: Farm Table has a good variety of coffees. I decided to go with the Matcha Tea Latte, which was came beautifully adorned with a design atop it, as well as a very large cup/ portion. I do have to say that it was a bit underwhelming and slightly bitter, however not bad. If I have a chance to go back, I might order the Nutella Latte or another drink next time. \n\n- Atmosphere: This place is tiny! However we went on a weekday for brunch so we found seating outside initially and then moved it when folks left. The only seating inside is a farm table, essentially one large table that sits about eight people. It seems like it's supposed to facilitate strangers sitting together for a meal, which happened with us. We got to meet two other groups of travelers during our meal and had a pleasant conversation. \n\nThere's also seating outside with about two tables, as well as an artsy structure which I guess you can eat on as well. The staff were also friendly. \n\nI'd definitely like to go back to Farm Table, loved loved the food and it's fresh quality!", "author": "Amit J."}

We ended up getting an egg sandwich ($8.25, no meat, really?), a $10 tuna melt (actually pretty decent!), a matcha chai (the one other stand-out item) and a rosemary iced tea (more watery than anything else).

The pictures all looked really cute so I was excited to try it out. I walked here from the Powell Bart station which took around 10-15 minutes. What I didn't realize about this place before I came is that it is SUPER TINY. When you walk inside, there is a huge communal table in the cafe and the cashier counter and that is it. Other than seating around the communal table, there are a couple bar stools and 2 little tables outside the venue, so seating is extremely limited. I think they could make use of their space a little better indoors in order to accommodate more people. Fortunately, on a weekday at 11AM, there weren't too many people here and there was no line so we could sit comfortable and enjoy our food. That is likely not the case on the weekends.\n\nThe food here is very pricey for the portion size. My friend ordered a daily toast, which was pretty loaded with fruits and nuts. I ordered the egg on a croissant which was however very tiny. For an $8 sandwich, I expected the croissant to be larger at least, but it was super small. The sandwich consisted of 2 hardboiled eggs that were cold (I would've preferred warm eggs and softboiled), mixed greens, some sauce, ham, and cheese. It tasted okay but definitely wasn't worth it.

There's also a square communal table inside which fits 6 people comfortably if you don't mind sharing. On nice days, there's few \"seats\" (and I say that loosely) on the sidewalk. The hipster vibe fits well with the feel of San Francisco. \n\nThey don't have a large variety of items for breakfast which was ok with me because it is a tiny kitchen in the back. We ordered what most customers get, but we weren't blown-away by the breakfast items. I felt for the price, I should've gotten something that I couldn't made at home myself. That's probably my only gripe, but other than that, it's a cute place to grab a quick bite. Maybe I'll try the Daily Toast next time. \n\nEgg on Croissant : The sandwich on the whole was good and filling for breakfast. It has a hard-boiled egg inside. (i would prefer soft-boiled.) I would order this again if I was hungry. \n\nTuna Melt : This was ok. It doesn't look very pleasant, but my guy thought it was good. After all, it's just tuna, tomato, and cheese on toast. Not really worth the price though.", "author": "Julie W."}

I used to love getting this egg biscuit dish, but realized it is no longer available =(  I ordered the salmon toast and for $13.50, I don't think it is worth how much it is priced at. It had at max 3 ingredients on the slice of bread. It was good bread, but all in all not worth the $13.50.

The table can fit about 8 people all around. If you plan on dining in, you must arrive early. We arrived about five minutes before open time during a non-busy week day and we were the first customers. A few more customers trickled in shortly after. There are seats outdoor as well but not a whole lot.\n- Portions are tiny. I ordered the Empanada which suppose to be a meal but the portion resembles half an appetizer. I ended up adding a ham and egg croissant to my order which toppled my breakfast bill over the $20 mark (tip included). To be fair though, the food here is locally sourced so it makes the price a bit higher. \n\nThe overall experience was good. Everyone had a good time and enjoyed their meal. Two out of the four people in my group ordered an extra meal because of how small the portion is for the Empanada. You should just know what to expect before coming here. Its not filling unless you don't eat much and don't care about protein intake as much either.\n\nI recommend ordering the toast with fruit on it (Daily Toast).", "author": "Danny L."}

Ok... maybe comfortably 5 total customers, though when we went there were 7 customers inside (I'm including the line people) and it was crazy cramped and I felt like we were all just breathing down each others neck. \n\nIt's priiiiiiiiiiiicy.\n+ But it is good and I want to assume it's all quality ingredients and that they bake everything in house since they run out so quickly. \n\nService is mehhhhhh.\n+ You just order at the counter and it's not a long interaction but for a place that has quite a few coffee drinks with strange names and no descriptions, you'd think they'd either be a little less non-plussed when people asked them questions or maybe just add some ingredients or detials about the drink to their menu.\n\nSmall portions, considerable price tag. \n+ Aaah San Francisco style plates. If you're looking for a lighter portion, this is great. If you're looking to have the hearty breakfast your midwestern heart is used to, well... maybe order one of everything because these orders come equal to or less than the portion size of a Hot Pocket. \n\nI'm not in LOVE with farm : table but friends keep dragging me back 'because it's quick and easy' (it never is) and they have something for everyone (if you get there 10 minutes before they open so they haven't run out) but I have enjoyed everything I've tried and I really do like their coffee beverage menu even if I never know what I'm ordering.", "author": "Candice G."}

While there were no lines running out the door when we visited, it was a pretty bustling Sunday. They have a bench/table inside that could probably squeeze at most 5-6 but have more seating available outdoors--some small patio tables, a few bar stools along the ledge, a standing table, and a wooden terrace/garden area for sitting. \n\nWe ordered two savory tarts--one with broccoli and bacon and the other with tomato and spinach-- and the egg on croissant. At first, I read the menu and had no idea what a \"savory tart\" was. They're just slices of quiche.

I wish I could tell you myself but cannot since we were kicked to the curb with smokers and pee smell.\n\nMy opinion: Never be rude to a customer. Be polite. I am not a very smart person but I do know you never make a lady wait..especially an 8 year old little girl. My review will not matter much with your popularity on yelp. It will matter even less than  the $20 I would've spent.\n\nWe bookmarked your restaurant on Yelp  from Orange County and trying your daily toast was part of our itinerary.. We walked from our hotel at 730am. We arrived and were told we couldn't come in because it was 7:53 and you open at 8. Outside your shop,  the street smells like piss and people are smoking. At 8:01 am (by my phone) we left.\n\nWe arn't important enough to let us have a seat inside. If it were my business, I would simply say \"we are not ready yet but please come inside.\" You upset an 8 year old and put us on the street to wait. In my book that is terrible service. \n\nYou ruined a little girls morning and that means you ruined mine. I am sorry we got there 7 minutes early. It's your business decision and this is my opinion.  We had crummy customer service. We have had better.", "author": "Nick H."}

Just take a look at this beauty:\n\nDaily (aka Everyday) Toast -- http://bit.ly/1Gj2lY7\nToasted brioche, spread with mascarpone cheese, topped with seasonal fruit and pistachios\nIt's pretty and tasted delicious!   Yeah I know, it's just fruit on toast, but I was pretty impressed with the presentation.  I'll say it's the most artistically impressive toast I've ever seen and eaten.  Granted, I could probably make this at home, but if you see the ingredients, I'd say it'll cost a lot of time and effort for me to gather up all that fruit, cheese, and other ingredients just to assemble it.  It's not something I'd make everyday so I'd gladly spend the $8 to get this at farm:table.\n\nThe place itself is really small.  They have one communal table inside that takes up most of the space, a couple of small tables outside, and a parklet.  I thought Merica and I were pretty lucky that we got space on the communal table inside.\n\nFarm:table is not exactly a spot I'd go out of my way for, but I know if I'm in the area, I could stop by for some true farm to table fresh food.

If you're not a huge dairy person, you can substitute for almond (made in house). The honey is also made in house and it's not as concentrated as regular honey (more syrup-y), so it blends nicely with the milk, as opposed to being a huge glob at the bottom of the drink. The touch of cardamom on top adds that beautiful smell. Iced on a hot day...it's pure perfection.\n\nI was lured in the same day by a pic of their daily toast, which was a fruit masterpiece on a beautiful brick of bread. We were their last customers of the day, so not sure if we missed the stone fruit stash because our toast was mostly berries. Don't get me wrong...I love me some berries, but the ingredient that sold me on the pic, was the ripe peaches and that was definitely absent from ours. Still delightful, nonetheless!\n\nWe also got a savory tart and if we had eaten it on the spot, I think it would have been a red, hot winner.

Only in SF can you find food so extravagantly unique and indulgent with a designer brand price tags (perhaps NY will soon have $10 toast).\n\nRidiculously overpriced though it may seem, their sandos are surprisingly addicting. The menu changes daily according to what is fresh, seasonal, and local, so every visit is a surprise. (Thankfully farm:table is out of the way for us so we've only been once; otherwise my wallet would be bleeding organic, recycled twenty-dollar bills.) (Sorry I am having too much fun trolling... let me get to the review).\n\nThe DAILY TOAST is something you could make at home, but you do have to give them credit for the beautiful presentation and thoughtful combination of fresh fruit, mascarpone / some devilishly delicious spread, and a sprinkle of pistachio crumbs atop perfectly toasted focaccia. \n\nThe EGG SANDWICH is also way more tasty than you'd expect from the banal name, but the soft-boiled runny egg in a buttery, flaky croissant is better than any stereotypical brunch fare. However I think they could have done better on presentation. The eggs look out of place in the middle of the coronal cross-section of the croissant, and a simple plate would have done wonders in comparison to the paper boat it's currently served in.\n\nThe richness of the croissant brings forth a dilemma; it is extremely filling, so I would recommend also ordering the daily toast and splitting half-and-half to simultaneously satisfy cravings for brunch food and a healthy (ish) fruit dish.\n\nSeating can also be problematic because it's small and gets crowded quickly, so I suggest coming before 9 on weekends (or even earlier/on weekdays if you want to snag indoors for ideal food pictures, which is mandatory if you are paying this much).\n\nIt came out to ~$20 for a breakfast for 2, with no drinks or extras. Pastries look amazing and judging from the bombness of the croissant I would trust them to have serious baking skills, but the $20 had definitely evaporated my breakfast allowance for awhile.", "author": "Edna C."}

The name itself is intriguing because you can expect some really fresh ingredients. We parked on the street a block down (SF you know, what else would ya expect?!) and we walked on over to find that this place is tiny. TINY. Like barely any standing room for 4 or so people and a small COMMUNAL table that takes up most of the rooms space. There's also some interesting bench area thing in front to fit some people and soak up some sun and 1 actual 2 person table in front as well, but that area was packed like crazy. Being my awkward self I kind of wanted to take our food to go, but at the same time I didn't want to walk down the block to our car with my egg sandwich thing in hand, taunting me to take a bite, but having to fight my urges for fear of spilling all over myself.

The menu is VERY small but honestly, that's what's expected in farm to table type of places-it's about the quality not the quantity.

My friends daily toast tasted awesome and looked beautifully instagram worthy, but NO DOUBT my plainer looking egg croissant was totally better, oh my goodness.

Matcha Chai Latte: This is a must!! I am a big fan of chai and this drink brings out the perfect blend in taste between matcha and chai. The matcha taste doesn't overtake the chai and vice versa. The drink was not super sweet as I had expected and overall, a really special drink that I am willing to come back again just for this. Rating: 5/5\n\n2. Daily Toast: Really special and super fresh!

But it's fabulous.\n\nIn case you don't know, farm:table is a adorable little (very little) breakfast spot a hop, skip, and jump away from Union Square.  Did I mention that it was small?  Well, it is.  There's nothing more than a breakfast pastry display, a cashier, and a communal table that technically seats 8 but eliminates all pretense of personal space.  Be prepared to rub elbows with strangers.\n\nI came in around 8:30am on a Sunday morning and there was already a line.  Luckily it moved quickly and gave me an opportunity to browse the mouthwatering menu.  I opted for a berry muffin, their \"daily toast\" (with raspberries, blueberries, peaches, strawberries, and cherries on mascarpone cheese), and a glass of their daily juice blend.  \n\nEvery single item was outstanding.  The toast was simply stunning to look at, and it tasted heavenly too, with lots of fresh berries in every bite.  And the muffin?  Warm, soft, sweet (but not too sweet!), and very flavorful.  The juice was the perfect thing to wash it down with.\n\nAt first, I was a little apprehensive about the cramped communal seating, but it ended up not being a big deal at all.  Everyone had a good sense of humor about having their breakfast on top of everyone else, and it seems like an easy environment to make some new friends...or just eavesdrop on some randoms.\n\nFarm:table proves that amazing things can come in the smallest of packages.", "author": "David G."}

I mean, the food was average and the place has an SF vibe which is pretty cool. One thing that was kind of a turn off was the savory tart that I ordered. I am very sensitive to the taste and smell of goat cheese and they did not list goat cheese in the description which has all the ingredients for the savory tart. I just couldn't eat the savory tart.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-06-21", "description": "Oh SF health department, I think you dropped the ball on this place. If cleanliness was my only complaint, I would perhaps just leave it alone, but when you pay a nice amount of money for a sandwich that is supposed to be heated, and it is STONE COLD in the middle, with congealed bechamel sauce, and you have rude workers and an owner (??) that thinks space for her dogs is more important than paying customers, you have a serious problem here. The owner certainly sets the stage for the rude, dirty behavior of her employees. \n\nSix weeks or so ago (I actually wrote this review the day of, and Yelp said I did not publish it, so here is it) I wandered upon this hole in the wall and they have a croque monsieur on their menu. That sounded good and I always like to see how it is done. This one said it had turkey and ham with melted cheese. Sounded good enough that I forked over $14 post tip to take my sandwich a few blocks to eat. \n\nFirst I ordered, the guy did not welcome me, he did was not polite and pretty much was ready to end his day as he called out after my order \"Only 15 more minutes.\" I should have known then I might have a problem. I sat down on the bench, at the very small table. In comes a woman with her two dogs, I am bad at dog types but it was something kind of puggish looking, one tan and one smaller one that was black. One was a badly behaved dog, so I rolled my eyes at the entitled woman who seemed to think her dogs deserved more space than actual humans. Then this woman starts to say \"Bring your cameras early tomorrow and be ready to post on your social media. I will be in early and prep. I ordered a new square today.\" You can see why I thought she was the owner. AT this point her dog barks, another example of a bad dog owner. The bad dog owner then says to the employee \"Don't give him anything Mr. So and so lost his right to get a treat because of his behavior.\" Ok, I was too fast to judge her as a bad dog owner, she is actually disciplining her dog, way to go. Woman owner with dog is still talking, fast and pressured (too much of one of the \"Cs\"...just not sure which one). Then the counter person is getting a piece of ham out...note, it is HAM. Of course, my first impression of this dog owner is correct as she says \"Oh hand it to me and I will feed them as they take my fingers off as I do it.\" Ok woman, you just said your dog does not get anything, now you are giving some to it while you cry out and make a big deal that the dog nipped you. Really??!! In front of customers? I truly hope you never had human children as we don't need parents around like you. \n\nSo all of this I would have ignored, not writing a Yelp review about it but the next move as just so unsanitary that I almost demanded my money back (and should have). An employee was holding metal utensils, and went to put the dogs. Hand runs from nose to butt. Then he walks over and uses THE SAME HAND to put the silverware in the container, touching all the parts we put into our mouth. Gross. No one was washing their hands, the person handling money was handling food with no gloves and not washing his hands, which is in violation of health codes. \n\nI take my sandwich back to the office. First of all there is about 1  ounce of meat on it and NO HAM. The damn dog got my ham. The cheese is cold and not melted, the meat cold (at least they chill their meat), and the bechamel sauce was stone cold and coagulated. The sides of the sandwich were burnt. Too hot, too fast. Gross. The whole thing got thrown away, what I waste of money. \n\nGo to this place if you want dog nose and butt germs on your food. Go if you want rude humans interacting with you. Go if you want cold food that is missing half the meat. Go if you want to walk away shaking your head and realizing you have to Yelp a 1-star review.", "author": "Theresa S."}

The place is small so try not to come here with a big party unless you come really early and grab the one communal table that's available inside (probably fits 12 skinny ppl). Otherwise they have small outdoor seating (for 2-3 ppl) and even a small standing area. \n\nI am obsessed with their daily toast - the vanilla mascarpone cheese is one of the creamiest and best I've had and topped with fresh fruits like grapes, orange, apple, pomelo, kiwi and pistachios. Just absolutely delicious. The fruit varies seasonally so you'll always get something fresh. The toast was sourdough-y which wasn't my favorite but didn't affect my love for the toast (clearly).

An ever changing menu with locally sourced fresh ingredients? How can you go wrong with that? On this Thursday morning, I ventured through the tenderloin to find out what this place was all about.\n\nAlas, so many things about this place were not just not good, but noticeably disappointing that I most certainly will not be going back.\n\nI'll start with the stuff that was only mildly disheartening. The menu is not really a menu at all. They offer a toast option, which is really just butter toast with some cream spread on it and fruit/nuts dumped on top. The other option is an egg sandwich. Aside from that all that they offer is some pastries and a salad or some vegetarian dish I can't recall. So we have a subpar menu with almost no options to start.\n\nNext I will point out that there is all of one table for all of their customers to share in this tiny spot. And it's not like you're going to be getting take out when your meal consists of a carefully balanced fruit arrangement on your fancy $8 toast. Ok, whatever, I can deal with that and squeezed myself into a seat on the table being shared with four other parties.\n\nI ordered the toast, because the other option is the egg sandwich and could see from the other people eating it that it was nothing special, basically just a soft boiled egg on a croissant. The toast was average at best. I saw them preparing it and it was literally something you might make for yourself at home with whatever ingredients you have lying around. \n\nThe service though... I don't even know what to say. All that I ordered was the toast and it took them THIRTY MINUTES to bring it out. When I asked the server what was taking so long she nonchalantly said \"oh right, I was supposed to make your toast huh?\" So she pulled out one slice, smeared some cream on it and put the fruit and nuts on top. Why did she not do that thirty minutes earlier when I ordered from her? No idea. \n\nWhat a terribly run operation. Hopefully the owner realizes that like many of the other reviews state, their employees have a bad attitude and provide poor service.

The spread on the toast was delicious. \n\nWe also ordered coffee a cappuccino and macchiato. They were alright, not bad but nothing special. \n\nIt took us a while to wait for someone to leave to get a seat. There is only 1 table inside which fits about 8 people which was full. Outside there were a few seating options but not much at all. We seat outside at a little table on its own. Be careful of when you place your food and coffee on the table. It is a very light table my friend barely hit it with her leg....and we definitely had coffee everywhere within the minute of sitting there. \n\nYou may not be able to find anywhere to sit but I would highly suggest to just take your food to go and take it with you to a park instead. \n\nGreat to stop by once to see what it's all about.

Not everything is a winner, however, 2 out of 3 choices we tried were great. We ordered the fruit on toast with walnuts, Kale Salad, and Ham n Eggs on croissant sandwich. Here's the verdict on those:  \nFruit on toast: delicious, but wish there was a more generous serving of that yogurty spread to balance out all that bread, it's the thickest n fluffiest Texas toast ever. By the time you get through half the toast you're tired of all the bread \nAnd will probably jus lick the fruit off and be happy with that. \nKale salad: the downer in the menu. Kale part of it was inedible due to it not being washed properly still having dirt stuck in it. It was gritty on the first bite. To properly wash kale you have to submerge it rather than just tu it under the faucet. They probably didn't realize it was still dirty.  The rest isn't much better, kinda boring in flavor compared to all the other beautiful ways they plate other items. \nIt's also the only gluten free option :(\nHam and eggs.

SUCCESS! The restaurant is very small and seats a total of eight inside and can seat a few people out side on their little platform. On Tuesday I ordered the daily toast and the macchiato. I am extremely impressed on how simple yet delicious their food is. The fruits on the toast were extremely fresh and crisp and you can tell that the fruit are sliced as orders come in.

It was Delicious!!\n\nSo you might wonder, why 4 starts and not 5? And this is solely for price.

If you followed up with which breakfast meal was your favorite? I'd answer with my meal at farm:table.\n\nNow, I couldn't give it a full five stars because part of me was sad about their prices:portion ratio. And a little annoying voice in my head told me I could make these breakfast meals at home at a fraction of the cost. But I was in San Francisco, and really small-annoying-voice-in-my-brain, where would you have time to gather all these ingredients and make a daily toast for yourself? Exactly. So suck it up and give them four stars because no matter how much emptier they made your wallet, you still enjoyed a darn good meal.\n\nHusband and I ordered an egg croissant, the daily toast, and a cup of their coffee. Loved all three things we ordered. I started eating the daily toast and really enjoyed all the different kinds of fresh fruits they piled on it. Then I looked across the table and saw my husband munching on the egg croissant and I had a strong sense of food envy. We switch plates half way through and I finished of that egg croissant because I hadn't realized that a hard boiled egg on a croissant was the best tasting breakfast ever. They I reached across the table and snagged the last bite of the daily toast out from right under my husband's fork. He retaliated by downing the rest of the coffee.

Maybe because the place is small so it  can get crowded easily. We waited in line for a while, which only built up the anticipation. I ordered the lavender latte (I've recently been obsessed with lavender anything) and the daily toast with fruit. The lavender latte was really good - not too sweet or lavender-y. The toast with fruit was also very good and I like that they use seasonal fruit so its fresh. For extra crunch, they add pistachios on top, which I love. While the toast was delicious, it wasn't very filling. I was hungry a couple of hours later, which usually doesn't happen after a brunch. Also, the prices aren't the cheapest so I kind of wish there was more to the toast. Maybe next time I'll get the toast with egg, which should be more filling. \n\nThere isn't a lot of sitting room so be prepared to either a) glare at people who are done to give up their table or b) eat standing up.

On the road, we get to our breakfast, and discover ham on the sandwich, with no avocado.  As vegetarians, it's unfortunate that after specifying no meat on the sandwich, and waiting so long in the line, then after waiting for our food, and no time to go back to get the order corrected, that we had to find an alternate solution.  \n\nThe reason for the 3 stars is exactly that.

After seeing the other pictures and the price for what it is, we were sold and took a nice walk to this place.\n\nI had the Egg on Croissant which was absolutely amazing. The portion is a little small, but the ratio of each ingredient put into it was a perfect blend. My friend had the quiche which was also delicious, and the slice was pretty large as well if you're skeptical about how satisfied your stomach will be. Something I do wish I had tried was the daily toasts -- so maybe next time! We both got the Seasonal House Juice which at the time was a blend of Apples, Oranges, and Grapefruit I believe (I could be wrong... I vaguely remember), but it was super refreshing! \n\nSomething about this place also is that it's a little bit small -- just something to look out for if you were looking for more of your standard sit-down, dine-in place; there might not be enough seating for you depending on when you go. They have one large square table inside and some outdoor seating.", "author": "Brian T."}

My friend ordered the daily toast and a matcha latte. She really enjoyed them too. I think the service was mediocre. Not extremely good or bad. But the wait for the food is absolutely insane. We waited 1 hour for our daily toast to come and when the order came only one of the daily toasts came. And I finished it all before my friend even got her daily toast. The drinks came out extremely fast but I was hoping to enjoy the drink with the toast but nope. I finished  the drink before the food even came. I would not come back if I was in a rush or want to wait that long and there was no one before us either. The toast isn't even hard to make. It's a slice of toast with cream cheese and some fruits on the top. That is definitely not worth an one hour wait. Overall I would just come back for the drinks.\n--------------------------------------------------\nI came here again with my friend and this time it was on point. The servers were friendly and the food did not take forever however i liked the fruits on the daily toast last time more. They had raspberries, blackberries, peaches, strawberries but this time they had apples, blackberries not as exciting or pretty. I got a milk and honey and so did my friend and we really enjoyed it.

Emphasis on \"little\" and \"quaint\". They have one table inside that takes up the entire place, which I assume is family style if there are multiple parties of two rather than one solid group of 6. There was a small bar outside looking into the restaurant's open window with about 2 or three stools, and then a peculiar planter box set up across from the front door that probably wasn't meant for seating but people sit on it anyways because there is essentially nowhere to sit. \nWe arrived late morning, probably about 10 am, with a line out the door -- to be expected. The place only holds about four people in line on the inside. The menu had a good variety -- breakfast sandwiches, classic pastries, classic and unique coffee/tea/lemonade drinks, and the like. \nWe had the infamous breakfast toast. I was hesitant because I prefer savory in the morning, but it was raved about so much I had to try it, and it did not disappoint. They load seasonal fruit onto a thick, soft white bread with a mascarpone cream in the middle. While this won't fill you up for the entire day (at least not for me), it's definitely worth trying. The prices are decent per item but if you were to order multiple things for yourself, that's where it gets more expensive. \nThe service was good; it seemed like they had one guy bussing, taking orders, and serving orders all at once with everyone else cooking or working as baristas behind the counter. I want to say they were most likely understaffed but it would be hard to staff such a small place properly. There's no room. \nI think if you're into the farm to table type fare and love seeing tiny cute coffee shops with good, fair portioned food -- check this place out. I don't think I will run right back the next time I'm in the city, but they had a line out the door for a good reason.", "author": "Marissa B."}

Kind of tasted as strong as Vietnamese coffee, but without the condensed milky feel.\n- Mocha - Dark and dry, 60% TCHO chocolate ($5.00). My absolute favorite. Didn't think I cared for it, but on this cold windy day it sure gave me a little bit of a kick and warmed me up.\n- Pickled egg sandwich with bacon jam, cr\u00e9me fraiche, and pea shoots ($7.00). The egg was purple, but tasted sweet and the bread was soft and crunchy at the same time. \n- Pulled pork sandwich with pickled beets, carrots, and herbs ($9.00).

The cereal, egg over croissant, toast with fresh fruit, and the quiche. The quiche was good but nothing stood out for me. 3.5 stars. The boiled eggs on croissant with dill was delicious. 5 stars. The cereal with home made almond milk. Had jam mixed in and gave it extra flavor. 4 stars. The toast with mascarpone cheese and fresh sliced fruit was also delicious. 5 stars. They have some pastries on the side. Muffin and croissant were quite good.\n\nI tried the mocha and it was fantastic. 5 stars!! Smooth, chocolatey but not too sweet.\n\nOnly drawback is the lack of space. They have a small table inside that can seat ~8 people. One other small round table outside that can seat 3-4. Have some cute \"green\" space outside where you can also sit but the \"seats\" are not horizontal, all angulated so you can't sit straight. I don't mind that at all, but beware if you have kids.

They have a few egg-based dishes for brunch, in addition to a yogurt/granola bowl, and several other pastry items (pound cakes, croissants, etc.) that are dense and absolutely delicious. Nice selection of coffees and espresso drinks as well.\n\nFYI: The only reason my rating isn't a 5 is because there's a limited selection of cooked brunch items (i.e. 3-5 plates?), which makes sense if the establishment is positioned as a coffee/dessert place, but not so much as a brunch spot.\n\nAmbiance - interesting place: there's a single communal table indoors and it forces you to sit next to people you don't know, which is not all that bad (or good if zero conversation takes place), so it just depends on your preference.  Interior design evokes bucolic sentiment as the name of the restaurant suggests, and do note that there is outside seating if you prefer to not eat by the communal table.\n\nService - The employees are extremely nice and seem very passionate about what they do though, which is awesome!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-08", "description": "When I was in San Francisco last, I made an intentional trip to Farm:Table before my flight out because sometimes you need just one human moment when you travel for a reason that is not VACATION.\n\nAs is true for most big cities, San Francisco has strong neighborhood identities. Farm:Table is in the Lower Nob Hill neighborhood, where Tenderloin meets Nob Hill. (They have a coffee called Tender Nob, which is a nickname for this particular part of this neighborhood and which I think is funny. They also have a coffee called Verve, which could have nothing to do with the neighborhood, but could awesomely be a reference to The Verve Pipe. Remember those guys? No? Ok, moving on.)\n\nOh gosh. This place is so, so tiny. When I stepped out of my car, I gasped. No kidding. This should be a definite expectation reset for many of you. If you are expecting to do brunch here with a group of six, you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to have a little moment for your self and one other person, that could maybe possibly sometimes work. There is one community table inside (implying: make friends!), a ledge (do I put my coffee there? Or my bag? Or...?), and a couple of small tables outside. Essentially, you are (1) grabbing food and going or (2) you are making new friends because you are sitting on top of these strangers while eating something crumbly or (3) you are about to passive aggressively battle to the end with people you have never met before because you all just want to eat your delightful breakfast food in a little of your own personal space. Don't you want to find out which group you fall into? I did, so I decided to stick around.\n\nI placed my order with a kind of slightly frazzled woman, who seemed to care less about me and my order than whatever was on her screen. There weren't many people in line waiting to order, but she seemed flustered and the kitchen was busy, so I ordered multiple things out of something akin to stress-and-judgment-laden-creativity (that's a thing, right?) and headed outside.\n\nThe first thing I ordered that came out was an almond milk latte. They use HOUSEMADE almond milk, which is gritty and very almond-y compared to mass-produced almond milk- and they seem capital-P proud of it. I imagine some guy spends his Tuesdays soaking almonds and using cheesecloth made from Tibetan monks to strain this mindful and special almond milk the right way. Whatever the backstory, this was not expensive for a latte. Really, everything here is not expensive (all of the food items are under $8). Yes, there are a small number of offerings on the total menu, but what they do (excuse where this is so obviously going), they do well.\n\nAs I was enjoying my HOUSEMADE almond milk latte, I started to really take a look at the food that was coming to the communal table and the tiny tables outside and it looked awesome. Ridiculously awesome. It was at this point that I praised my excellent (if not stress-and-judgment-laden-creativity) in ordering multiple breakfasts just for me. I definitely have self-congratulatory moments throughout my day and this was a big time smirking-and-head-nodding one. Multiple orders is the WAY in some places. Multiple orders is not the same as second breakfast, which is more of a time reference; as in: you eat second breakfast later in the day (a 10-10:30am situation, if you will). Ordering a second breakfast at the same time as the first one is a different situation completely. It is actually pretty baller, if you think about it.\n\nAs I was HOUSEMADE-almond-milk-latte-toasting-my-own-greatness, my first food order came out: The (Holy) Daily Toast.\n\nThe Daily Toast is a sea salt foccacia topped with sweetened mascarpone cheese, seasonal fruit and pistachio nut meat. It is like the best fruit pizza you've ever had. The mascarpone is sweet and the focaccia is crunchy and the fruit design is like art. Spectacular.\n\nThe Daily Toast was so good and filling- and I needed to head to the airport- so I had my second order, the Egg on Croissant, wrapped to go. The Egg on Croissant is a hard cooked egg with ham and Havarti on a toasted croissant with greens and fruit. It is a flaky croissant that is somehow substantial enough to hold the ham and eggs. The crumbly eggs and the tree-trunk like ham make for the right balance of tastes. Even when I ate it cold an hour later at my gate, it was still incredibly good.\n\nI could call Farm:Table a \"little gem\", a \"hole-in-the-wall\", or give you some extended metaphor highlighting that great things come in small packages, but instead, I'll say that this is a lovely red-paneled place that, in the morning, has the most beautiful light and I'll say that you should definitely order a few breakfasts here for yourself just because. Whether you find a seat or not, you'll enjoy it.", "author": "Erica G."}

The guy taking our order says \"we're out\" and then proceeds to shake the coffee container and says \" I might be able to get you a cup\". Ok, no problem. It's strange to me that a place that claims to be a breakfast and coffee shop wouldn't offer to make more coffee. Later, I go outside to put some cream and sugar in my coffee and the cream was empty. The same guy walks by and I tell him and he replies and tells me to go inside there's more there. Why not just refill the creamer. So next in line my friend orders a cappuccino from this guy. She asks if they have any flavoring. He replies and says no they don't have that and if that's what she wants then she can  go to Starbucks. Wow, so rude! Next in line is my friend who has a slight accent but speaks 100% perfect english, has lived in this country for 20+ years. She asks for an Americano. He so rudely says he cant understand her and she repeats her order, she says its an espresso. He then proceeds to turn around and grab someone to \"translate\" for him. She was the most upset out of the 4 of us because he treated her like garbage. He was delivering everyones food, except for ours.

There's only one table inside (which fits about 8 people) and the front of the store is an open window that has a bar style standing area outside. There's also some futuristic seating area that is really cool but totally dysfunctional (especially for my 7-month pregnant coworker). I got the toast which was good, but not $7 good. It was a thick slice of bread with mascarpone and a bunch of fruit on top. I also got the juice that they make which was good, but not $7 for a 10oz cup. I probably won't be back, but I adore the whole concept of the place.", "author": "Kyle D."}

While the service was good and the simple food straightforward and tasty, I found the place to be too TINY and the wait too be too long. I am pretty sure I waited over twenty minutes for 1. an iced coffee and 2. some toast with fruit. \n\nThe communal ONE table in the place had an assortment of hip folks on each side -- a gal reading a book on a tablet, a canoodling couple (male with requisite hipster mustache), two single non-associated females, and a family of three which included a baby. Two small tables outdoors were occupied, but there were also two tall counter areas from which to eat (while standing...) and a miniature park (called a parklet) with which to somehow situate yourself to juggle your food and drink I suppose. If a place could be described as borderline tritely San Franciscan, it would be farm:table.\n\nAnyhow, the daily toast had a nice mix of salty (from the bread) and sweet from the mascarpone and fruit. The sprinkled pistachio bits were a nice touch ($7). The iced coffee was delicious - not too sweet or creamy and strong ($4).\n\nGood, if you called your takeout order in advance while starting your walk on over...from 4+ blocks away.", "author": "Jan P."}

We are staying at the Ritz so this place was only about a 10 minute walk. \n\nWe walked in and were pretty disappointed that there was only one communal table in this itty bitty place. I think there were two two tops outside but it was raining so that wouldn't work. My boyfriend and I were almost out the door but decided to order coffee to go. I ordered a chai latte and he got a mocha. His mocha was good and my chai latte was alright- it had a little bit more spice than I like. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our coffee a couple got up from the table opening up some space to sit. After we saw the food that some customers were eating we decided to just order and eat anyway and I am SO glad we did! \n\nI ordered the croissant sandwich which came with hard boiled egg, prosciutto, Creme fraiche and baby arugula. It was just perfect. The combination worked. My boyfriend and I shared and I really could have gone for another. We also ordered mushroom and zucchini frittata. WOW. Was not expecting that! The aioli it came with was just delicious. I asked for an extra side that I slapped on my croissant also. (Hehe). Both items were light but filled us up. I didn't have a heavy full feeling. I was thoroughly satisfied with all elements of the food. \n\nI know that the setting of the place is what makes this place and works for others but would be nice if there was more room. Since it's a quick bite I guess it really doesn't matter that you share a table. Overall I would definitely recommend and would absolutely go back.", "author": "Ida A."}

There's a communal space inside that consists of one table with benches all around.  It seats about 6-8 people max.  The place is a quarter of the size of a regular coffee shop and unbearably hot inside.  \n\nWe opted to eat outside just to cool off from the warm interior.  I ordered the wheat toast with mascarpone, apples, and caramel.  The toast was more like slices of wheat sourdough, chewy in texture.  The mascarpone was perfectly flavored with maple and the apples were a lovely touch.  The caramel was a failure.  I expected gooey but was met with hard candy.  I didn't like the caramel at all.  Overall, it was good and healthy.  \n\nI also ordered a decaf latte.  They were unable to make me an iced decaf latte.  Judging from the size of the kitchen, the chef had to deal with, I don't blame her.  I'm glad I ordered the hot latte instead because after a few minutes of sitting outdoors, it became chilly again and having something warm to drink was most welcome.  The coffee seemed to be made with a French press and there were a few grounds at the bottom of my cup, not so much that it was gross, but enough to make note of.  They had raw sugar available and their food is made with fresh locally derived ingredients, hence the name farm:table.  They also offer almond milk as a substitute if you're lactose-intolerant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-11-13", "description": "I got the toast of the day and the braised pork with a soft boiled egg. The toast was a brioche with a smear of mascarpone and \"dark caramel sauce\" topped with apples and pomegranates. The sauce didn't taste nor looked all that caramel-y, but it had nice flavor to it. The pork was tender, but the best part was the rapini (had to look it up, it's some sort of green of the mustard family).\n\nI'm a little conflicted about the place. The food was good, but they charge way too much for the portion size and the service was basically nonexistent. I can pay around the same amount and get similar quality of food at a nice sit down place. I admire what they do -- simple food and concept with quality ingredients, but it's simply not worth it.

It's the smallest croissant ever ): I was still pretty hungry afterwards. For breakfast, I think it's fine. For lunch? Good luck not chewing your hand off after. I had to go for pho afterwards.\n\nTwo of my friends tried the Daily Toast and it had a bunch of different sliced fruits on it...looked really colorful! There is also a sweetened cheese spread beneath the fruits. My friends seemed to like it and thought it was pretty good! \n\nTwo of my other friends tried the Savory Tart but were not impressed at all. It basically felt like eating a giant quiche or basically just steamed egg with crust underneath it and some cauliflower mixed in. There's some pieces of lettuce on the side for their \"salad\" that had an olive oil based dressing. I don't think it's worth it at all...\n\nNote: There is only one table at farm:table so keep that in mind!

Yeah $3 for a small cup (smaller than a \"tall\" at SBucks) but the quality of the drink cannot even be compared with anything available at SBucks. So milky, perfectly sweetened, was just the perfect drink to start off my morning. \n\n\nWe tried two items- meatloaf sandwich and beef and butternut squash stew. At first we looked at the food and was a bit skeptical but it was love at first bite. Beef stew perfectly flavored, butternut squash and brown rice paired perfectly in the dish.

We were starving and needed nourishment, so trusty ol' yelp pointed us to farm:table.  Four stars can't be bad right?\n\nWell, the food wasn't bad, I really just think it is way over-priced.  I have no problem with the one table, stand outside and eat concept.  I appreciate the use of local, organic ingredients, but really, after eating what we had, I couldnt justify dishing out $26 for the experience.\n\nWe had:\n1.  Hard boiled egg Brioche with a tomato and herbed marscapone:  There was really nothing wrong with it, but if the highlight for a $6.75, tiny sandwich served on a tea cup plate was the yummy seasoned tomato, then that is not cool.  The brioche was ok, nothing earth shattering.  It took me 3 bites to eat this.  \n2.  Arugula, goat cheese, roasted root veggies (added bacon):  With the addition of bacon, this cost $13.  No way in hell will I ever pay $13 again for a tiny dish of roasted roots and some arugula with drizzles of goat cheese.  Again, the dish wasn't bad, but no way does it justify a $13 price tag.  \n\nThe tea pot we shared was good.\n\nOverall, I probably will not come back here, just because the the prices do not justify what you get.

They act like they think they are working at some hip, uber-Parisian cafe, and funny thing is that the baristas at the cafes in Paris I have encounterred are way more polite and customer-friendly that these two! \n\nThe first time I was there, I walked in and the bearded guy said with attitude that they were still closed. Cool. No problem. But two things: 1. you might want to keep the door shut to let people know that you're still closed, and 2. you might at least pretend to be a little friendly, given that I am the customer and you are the worker-yep you ARE the worker.\n\nThe second time I was there, there were maybe two other customers sitting at the community table, and three people working behind the counter. I went up to try and order a latte, and the uptight lady told me (yes TOLD me, but with a slight attitude) \"it will be a few minutes\"...umm....there's hardly anyone here and there are three people behind the counter! If it's an issue of timing-that they are still opening up, then you may want to come in EARLIER so you can start the opening process EARLIER.\n\nOther times I have walked past the place, I would look as I am walking past, and the employees seem to not have much experience working in a cafe establishment in a big city-they seem to be moving soooooo slowwwwww...OMG.

My friend was happy to go here for lunch and leave the corporate feel of financial district by going just a few blocks away. She said \"I feel so Californian\" and I felt the same: local ingredients, a simple and healthy menu, and relaxed looking diners (mostly in the hipster/ biker crowd). You share a large wooden table inside with other diners, or can people watch on the tables along the sidewalk.\n- We got a nice sampler with a half salad, soup, and sandwich for $12 thanks to a BlackBoardEats deal.\n- The people working there were super friendly. They brought each of our dishes out to us. And my friend left her wallet on the seat and the girl behind the counter ran after us down half a block to give it back.\n- The ingredients were SO fresh. Like literally just pulled out of the ground.\n- MUST HAVES: Green garlic soup!\n\nOVERALL CONS:\n- I wish there was just maybe one more option for sandwiches and soups so we could get a little more variety. Now I have to come back to try a different sandwich!\n\nTHE FOOD:\n\n* Mixed baby greens w/ baby carrots radish balsamic vinaigrette - The dressing on this was well balanced and light. However there was too much arugula which made it a little too bitter. There were too few carrots/radish, though everything was incredibly fresh. My friend liked the salad overall, I'm just not a fan of too much arugula.\n\n* Green garlic soup - This was so great! Immensely tasty flavor, not overpowering. I took one sip and immediately perked up, amazed that a simple garlic soup good taste so good.\n\n* Feta chive egg salad sandwich on pan de mie - The bread was buttery & slightly hard, yet filling and delicious. I liked the concept of this sandwich but I couldn't taste the feta as it was overpowered by mayo in egg salad. It came with this cute little radish on the side that was delicious (I never knew I liked radish!).", "author": "Ziyan C."}

When my bf and I arrived, we were surprised with how tiny the cafe was, there's one communal table that sits about 8 people tightly. It was about the size of a small living room and there was barely any space to move around, but the decor was rustic and very very charming. Without the crowds of people waiting to order food, it would actually feel very cozy and quite nice. \n\nI tried:\n   Daily toast - toasted bread with a mascarpone+honey spread topped with seasonal fruits. The bread was hot and toasty, the mascarpone+honey spread was lightly sweetened, and the fruits were very fresh. It was beautiful and pretty darn delicious, but maybe a tad too expensive for what it was (two pieces of bread, spread, and sliced fruit).\n\n  Iced milk coffee - it comes default as a milk coffee that is very lightly sweetened (you can customize). There's also a house-made almond milk option (+$1)! The coffee was aromatic, strong, and I loved that it was barely sweetened, it was very nice.\n\n\nThere is very limited seating, so don't come here expecting to have your own table, there's one communal table indoors and 2 single tables outdoor. However, there is a parklet right in front of the coffee shop where you can lounge and sit, but no table space there..\n\nThe service was okay. The staff was friendly and nice, but the wait for food was very long. Not sure if they were understaffed that day or not, but we waiting quite a long time for our toast and coffee. I read a few other reviews from yelpers that experienced the same problem - there's definitely room for improvement on their food preparation time. The coffee arrived about 10 minutes after ordering and the toast probably took from around 30-40 mins. After our meal, my bf thought the daily toast was so delicious that he wanted to order another one to-go, but because we feared the wait would be another 40 mins, we decided not to order more food. In the end, we just left farm:table still hungry and sad (we wanted more daily toast) ; (\n\nOverall, I liked mostly everything about this little cafe, but the long wait made our experience less enjoyable. Maybe we'll give farm:table another try on a less crowded day.", "author": "Monica T."}

What a rush, what a thrill...and how did I come upon this presumption? Well, I actually went to the place that is rated \"hottest\" on this site at the moment, farm:table. It actually isn't that far away from me, but it does require me to steel myself to take the 19 Polk, the passenger list of which would not be mistaken for the guest stars on an episode of \"The Love Boat\".

There is a distinct Gallic feeling to the decor with the red outlines, and it actually does consist of a French farm table, fully occupied when I got there. Their ever-changing menu is on a chalkboard column, so you pretty much get what they have. I was there for a late lunch, so I went for both the $8.50 Prosciutto and Pesto Sandwich on a crunchy baguette and the $5.50 Cream of Tomato Soup (see photos). Fresh-tasting for sure. The baguette was just the right texture. The soup had a dollop of olive oil, a bit on the lukewarm side but still a treat for the clean flavor of it.\n\nSince I really couldn't sit inside, I secured one of the two petite tea tables outside in the bitter cold. I did get self-conscious slurping soup as derelicts would slow heir pace to stare at me. However, I don't fault the staff who were nothing short of  attentive and cordial through my entire experience there.

Now don't get me wrong, I like limitations, too many options can be just as cruel as too few, but 3?! And all of them were bizarre, like salmon and lockes, or croissant with creme fraiche (basically sour cream). I thought it was a ok. Too hipster for me, but not necessarily a bad experience.\n\nWorth a shot. Hopefully their specials on the day you go are better than when I went.", "author": "Brittini S."}

A friend got the same sandwich with ham and a capacchino.  First, the croissant came out WITH A HAIR.  I went back to kitchen to notify them and came to realize they all had hair and no hair nets in the kitchen.  Got a new one, but with ham.  The lady didn't believe I had ordered one without ham.  Hair was gross enough, but they messed the order twice.  Concept is good and food is good but potions are small for price.  Layout and decor is nice as well, which is the only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1.  They only have 1 medium sized communal table inside.", "author": "Diana M."}

This place is within walking district from Union Square.  It was about brunch time and I was craving something SF.  This place definitely hit the spot.  \n\nSeating:\nIt is a quaint sized place with approximately 8 seats at a communal table to sit in.  There is a open kitchen style window  with a window sill where people standing outside can also set their food or drinks.  There was one table with two chairs outside of the door.  There is also a modern wooden bench directly in front of the door curbside.\n\nFor those of you who are not used to sharing tables and want a more intimate setting to eat at, I would highly suggest walking over to Union Square and enjoying your meal on the grass.  I am not the biggest fan of sharing space however I actually enjoyed meeting other patrons and enjoying our meals.  I felt that is what the point is of having a quaint coffee shop - neighborhood shop with your neighbors and the farm is brought to the table.  I love it!  It provided a very friendly and casual ambiance that many coffee shops are lacking these days.\n\nFood:\nI ate the croissant sandwich which was to die for!  I also had an iced mocha.  They carry other pastries there as well.  Everything on their menu is delicious.  You really cannot go wrong with whatever you choose to devour.  \n\nHours:\nMake sure you come for breakfast or lunch.  They are closed in the late afternoon.\n\nGo and enjoy their food folks!  It's worth the wait if there is a line out the door.  And if there isn't seating available, you can always take the food to go and enjoy else where.", "author": "Arlyn M."}

Went once when I first arrived at my hotel in San Francisco and it was very busy, so not much was expected for customer service. We ordered 2 latte's and an almond croissant no problem. The next day I wanted to get a latte with a little less milk, or even a cortado, but wasn't sure about the coffee culture and their menu considering some spots in SF don't know and it wasn't on their menu. So I ordered a double short latte (all their lattes come in one size and I didn't know) and he rang me up for a latte at $6.75, which is ridiculous so I asked him why it was so much for a double short and he said \"I thought you said a double\" and I explained what drink I wanted and he was telling me what I wanted was not a latte so I told him I wanted a cortado and he yelled out \"there you go!\" And I told him how I just didn't know their menu because it was a little confusing and he just kept belittling me instead of just helping me out so I asked him to cancel the transaction and left. It's really frustrating for someone who doesn't frequent there to go in and order and if I explain what I want he should then explain to me what they call it and how much it is because even just a double 12 oz latte shouldn't be 6.75, I went in the day before and got 2 lattes one with almond milk and it was less than 8 dollars so I don't know what's going on there.", "author": "Annabelle M."}

Now that we've gotten over the fact that it's a shoebox, let's first dicuss the food. \n\nOk, maybe it's coming directly from a farm to their singular table, but I'll tell you what it isn't, made to order!

The scone was ROCK hard. The egg situation was a SITUATION. But I think what made this place a numero uno offender and reason for me to actually LOG back on to yelp 2 years after my last review and scream some reason into the nothingness of the internet was the price point/service.\n\nYou gonna pay for some seriously boring shit here and you are going to wait A LONG TIME FOR IT TO BE REHEATED FOR YOU, and when you get it, you will get it at their leisure, with zero friendly vibe.

DEFINITELY DON'T ask for things like 'no sugar' in your coffee. \n\nOn their chalk board they tout their \"VERY SPECIAL\" iced coffee, which is just an imitation of Blue Bottles New Orleans situation. A now overly familiar cold brew with sugar. I asked for it with no sugar please. \n\nI grabbed a scone. My partner waited 40 minutes for his reheated egg situation. AFTER his eggs, came my iced coffee, SATURATED in simple syrup. I muscle my way through the crowd (why it's crowded I have no idea) to return it politely. The acid victim looks confused. Her thinning grey hair gently falling into various plates of food. \n\nAcid Spirit: \"You want sugar in your coffee?\"\n\nme: \"No thank you, I told you no sugar please\"\n\nAcid Spirit: \"So you want iced coffee with sugar, which is our specialty\"\n\nme: \"No thank you, I'd like iced coffee without sugar, is that possible?\"\n\nAcid Spirit: \"I guess so although that's not our specialty\"\n(meanwhile I had already had a bafflingly long conversation the FIRST time I ordered it about the EASIEST of requests, no sugar. \n\n20 minutes later....LITERALLY she comes stumbling out like a zombie and then out of nowhere this 60s spirit decides to dish up some serious passive agressive bay area righteousness to me. \n\nAcid Spirit: \"Here's your iced coffee without sugar\"\n\nme: \"thank you!\"\n\nAcid Spirit:  \"let me stand here and watch you take the first sip to make sure you like it!\" said with exaggeratted smile and barely veiled annoyance\n\nI'm too cold and bored and over it to even ice her bullshit back so I just say \"yup!

We walked here for breakfast on Sunday before going to walk around the city and were able to enjoy the nice weather and good food that filled us up until early evening.  Tiny little gem of a place that is nicely tucked away.  Located in Downtown/Civic Center area or what many lovingly refer to as Tendernob/ Lower Nob Hill this place brings a new life to the neighborhood.  Farm: Table is clearly owned by a very sweet family that care about their restaurant and customers and provides a homey and welcoming feel from when you walk in. \n\n    Together two of us shared the frittata, Hard boiled egg croissant, and the special a sausage on a baguette, with two coffees.  Total about $30 and it was well worth it, the servings are smaller than most people are accustomed to receiving at brunch, but I equate that with the simple fact you are not getting all the sides such as hash browns or bacon or toast with each entree you get what you order and that allows the flavors of each item to really be highlighted and enjoyed.  Keeping the concept simple local food for customers to enjoy while being filing and giving you a unique atmosphere. \n\n    I only wish they were open Monday's so I could go and try more food this morning before heading off to work!

The place is just like everyone mentions-it's tiny! With only 2 tables outside and a communal table inside, this place is like Harry Potter's room. Apparently they change their menu every day and today they only had a quiche, toast topped with fruits and oatmeal. I'll admit it, I was a bit disappointed. The menu sounded boring but the guy who greeted us said everything was really good. So I took the seat outside and shared a quiche and a toast topped with fruits as well as the tcho chocolate mocha. The mocha was delicious and you could taste the tcho chocolate. It wasn't too strong nor was it too light. The mocha was perfect even with no latte art. The toast was what I was looking forward to most. There were strawberries, apples, grapes, oranges and pistachios on top. No berries, no fig, nothing fancy like the other reviewers posted here on Yelp. The toast was this semi thick toasted brown bread, I'm not sure what it was but I highly doubt it was focaccia bread. The sweet cinnamon-ey cheese was lightly spread on top-I secretly wish they added just a little more. The toast itself was about $8. Was it worth it? I'm really not sure... The drive itself from where I live was pretty far and this location is really out of the way. This place is right in the TL area which is really sketch. Parking is definitely tough. Would I come back? Only if someone wanted to go, otherwise I would not crave for this. \n\nHowever, I would like to try their boiled egg that everyone has been raving about.", "author": "Laura T."}

Yes, farm:table is TINY but it's charming and I'm kind of glad it doesn't seat 100 people just because it would take away from the aura that farm:table is trying to achieve (and wonderfully executes).  Then again, I tend to get lucky and I came in here without waiting for long and snagged the table after I placed my order.  LOVE the decor, friendly service, and GREAT(!), fresh food.\n\nI love their soft egg and green onion on brioche bread with braised pulled pork (also comes with coffee, but I opt for the milk and honey since I'm not a fan of coffee).  Their brioche is delicious bread! It is rich, creamy, and tender. Their over easy eggs... oh, my, gosh. It is easily the best easy eggs I've ever had. The egg white was fully cooked and it fully encased a runny yolk that was just... perfect. Pureed green onion is smothered over the eggs, while the eggs are sitting on a bed of tender pulled pork... and ALL of this is layered on top of the creamy brioche. You bring your spoon in, break the yolk, get some pulled pork and slice through some brioche and you've got an amazing combination.  It is a hearty fulfilling breakfast and it doesn't leave you feeling bloated. Ah-ma-zing.\n\nTheir milk and honey is light and well, just right. It's simply warmed milk with a bit of honey.  Simplicity is good for the soul... very good. I also tried their citrus apple juice and it is DEE-LISH. It's light, refreshing, sweet, and just a teeny weeny bit sour... made up of grapefruit, blood orange, apple, orange, and another fruit (I forget). Nonetheless, you've got to try it if you're not a coffee enthusiast! Although I did have their iced coffee and it was also very, very good... Lastly, their vanilla latte -- yum! Foamy, creamy, and silky. I recommend ALL of their drinks here. \n\nMy friends like the whole wheat bread with honey mascarpone spread and green apple bits (they change the fruit topping -- sometimes they use pear). It's also really good but I think the soft egg on brioche is more bang for your buck.\n\nThe last time I was here, I came with five other people and we took up the whole (one) table inside. We had breakfast and we were overlooking the cars and pedestrians going by through a windowless opening.  This place is quaint and charismatic, for sure.  Anyway, they change their menus slightly from day to day and from am to pm so go in for a surprise. farm:table holds a special place in my heart and I would recommend it to anyone in SF!\n\n**Cash only**\n**Be prepared to order, pick up, and eat elsewhere most of the time.", "author": "Jenny O."}

Although I love me some powdered sugar dusted battered french toast, fried eggs, sausage links, hash browns, and all that good stuff, farm:table is a nice break from that. The experience here is fresh, healthy, and cozy. Between my friend and I, we shared two dishes: the hard boiled eggs persimmon tomatoes bacon baguette and the 3 cheese & rooftop herb quiche. We paired our meal with lattes, a regular one for myself, and a latte with almond milk for my friend. We took a seat at the communal table inside amongst other farm:table patrons. \n\nThe cashier was friendly and we didn't wait long for our food. Both lattes were pretty good with my friend's latte being quite tart (still good) from the almond milk. I did not know how to eat the baguette dish. With the boiled eggs being to one side, the bacon and tomatoes in the center, and the baguette drizzled with oil on the other side, I attempted to place the egg/bacon/tomatoes onto the baguette to eat it like a pizza which was semi-successful. Regardless of how I ate this dish, the baguette was crunchy and fresh, boiled eggs + bacon served as the perfect proteins, and the persimmon tomatoes were deliciously sweet. As for the quiche, the cheese, the eggs, the crust = all perfect. I could have eaten a whole quiche dish here. It was paired with a side salad with what I think was composed of butter lettuce and more of those delicious persimmon tomatoes and cherry tomatoes as well. \n\nIn the end, our plates and cups were empty. Portions here are smaller than your average but so am I so it was a perfect serving size for me. Because of these smaller portions, prices may seem on the high end but you are paying for fresh and local ingredients while eating in our fine city of SF. Plus, during my visit, surprisingly, they played good current R&B tunes.", "author": "Maya S."}

It was easy to find, and immediately I was worried that it was one of those 2-hour-wait brunch places. It was a beautiful day and somewhere between five and ten parties were hanging around outside, but luckily for us, there were only a few people actually in line. We were easily able to order (we had some sort of sausage special, he had a mocha, and I had the chai latte) and quickly found a spot in the sun to wait for our drinks.\n\nFor what I thought was a crowd, we got our drinks quickly. My latte was pretty good! It had a great amount of spice with every sip. We easily found someone to help us get a knife to cut our sandwich in half. The place was pretty small--probably hard to be a sit-down place when the weather isn't as nice, but we lucked out.\n\nOverall it was a pretty simple spot. I enjoyed my drink, had an easy time understanding the setup, the employees were very nice, and service was quick.

I had one of their three ever-changing specials: the bacon chedder quiche, with a small salad.  The quiche was amazing, my only complaint was that it went too fast!  I could have eaten a whole second piece :)  I also had a latte with almond milk.  Loved the heart shape of the foam.  It was delicious.\n\nIt is perhaps the smallest place I've ever been to (inside, one communal table that seats about 6 people, and two tables outside that seat 3 each).  Because it was 8 am on a Saturday I was able to grab one of the tables outside.  Otherwise, you should be prepared to take your meal to go.  \n\nI took some pastries to go to share with my boyfriend and friend: got one plain Kouign Amann, one pear one, and one apple pastry.  The Kouign Amanns lived up to the hype here.  They are probably most similar to baklava, but much, much better.  \n\nThe place wasn't exactly cheap: it was about $35 for my slice of quiche, a latte and three pastries to go.  Also beware it's cash only.  \n\nIf you are a picky eater, check out their daily specials online before going here.  You really only have three choices for an entree.", "author": "Wendy L."}

That was really nice of you!  We will give it another go when we are in the city.)\nWhat a BUMMER.  So it gets a star because the guy who took our order was really nice, and because the food was good.  And it gets nothing else because of the woman who insisted on berating us from the kitchen (head chef, owner, manager ????? Not sure exactly), was such a strangely unwarranted jerk that it took us from awesome mood to truly terrible mood in the blink of an eye. \nWe got to the front of the line and asked a question about the yogurt. Now I know what you're thinking  - \"oh this guy is a hold up the line 1000 question pain in the butt\".  Nope, I promise. Asked one EASY to answer question. Guy behind the counter answers it right away, lady behind him jumps in with a truly confusing onslaught of breakfast hostility. Weird and a big fat bummer. \nEverything people say about it that is inconvenient is true. Long line, nowhere to sit, very limited menu (three items and some pastries that were really tasty).  It is inexpensive, it is cute, the food is good..... But to be honest, the food would have to be five star great if you wanna act like the \"breakfast nazi\" while I'm ordering.  Good, but nowhere near the hype. And I gotta give it a low rating because a little kindness goes a long way.... And so does a little hostile unkindness.", "author": "Aaron H."}

It is literally one table--one table pressed into a tight corner and a chalk board menu of three, maybe four breakfast/brunch options. An array of baked goods looked good, but I'm glad we didn't waste the calories. SF has better pastries; of this I am sure.\n\nOne plus of the small table is that we could see every dish come out--each dainty and just too small. Too small because they were actually tasty and we wanted more; too small because breakfast for two without coffee was over $18 gosh darn it, and for that price you should get a hearty, filling start to your day. The food is good, but sparse, and on teeny plates that works for only the mousiest of appetites.

Really small spot so on weekends especially there isn't much space to leisurely go about your morning routine w/o glaring eyes and people hovering your table or seat, so get comfortable on the oddly designed Parklet out front.", "author": "Asia L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-12", "description": "Came here for a light brunch on a Sunday and had a great experience. Farm table is a tiny hole in the wall in Lower Nob. They serve a couple coffee drinks, several tea's, three main entrees (at least when I went) and a couple pastries. We arrived just as they opened so we didn't have to fuss with a line but this place quickly filled up and there was a line going out the door in no time.\n\nThe food was great, right sized portions, great ingredients and good prices. We ordered the daily toast, which is what Farm Table is known for so this is a must get, and an egg sandwich on a croissant. The daily toast switches up so it doens't make a lot of sense to review my particular version of the order but generally the daily toast is literally toast with fresh fruit. Doesn't sound like much but I was pretty pleased. Ours was foccaccio bread with homemade marscapone attoped with strawberries, apple slices, kiwi, and orange. The egg sandwich was your standard egg sandwich but still good. \n\nService was good a little bit better than your standard coffee shop but don't think you're going to get world class service here. There just honestly isn't enough space for that. Which brings me to my next point. Farm table is a tiny establishment with one communal table inside and a couple tables/chairs outside. Your best bet is to carry and go. \n\nOverall, great place and a nice little find in lower nob. Definitely pick up a coffee/tea and a pastry if you're looking for a little treat. Otherwise treat yourself to the daily toast if you've got a couple minutes and they've got an empty seat for you. Enjoy!", "author": "Ken C."}

With only one table, and a tiny one outside, it can make it super hard to snag a table. Thankfully my friend and I came right at the end of breakfast, so we were able to eat with only one other person at the table. It's cool how they switch out their menu every day, but that also makes it hard for a picky eater like myself to decide when to come or what to order. I finally settled on pears on rye minus the cream cheese. Unfortunately the pears were softer then I like, and even if it had the cream cheese, I felt the concept was kind of simple for a $7-8 dish. I also tried some of my friend's almond milk latte, but I wasn't really a fan. Especially considering its almost $5 for a tiny cup. \n\nDespite my lack of enthusiasm for the food, the service was impeccable, and the guy who took our order was really patient and helpful in helping us decide what to order. He even anticipated that I would want some butter with my bread which was nice. And I like the coziness of the place, and staring out the window. Maybe next time I'll just stop in for a coffee though.", "author": "Sarah S."}

I think that everything at this establishment was accidentally scaled down by 40% average human size. The food, the tables, the interior, the menu- all were too small for comfort. \n\nThe plus 1 star was for the croissant sandwich, which was tasty, but not satisfying. It could be though, for someone that eats 7 meals a day. But not for average me. \n\nAlso, I trusted Yelp and came to this place with my 2 visiting Aussie cousins. One of which was upset over the attitude and rudeness of an employee here. Her croissant sandwich had yet to show even after I was done with mine (she ordered one Aussie cousin behind me), so she inquired at the register. The employee then insisted that her order had already been carried out. Which it hadn't, obviously. My cousin finally got her darn croissant after what became a sort of heated customer-to-employee confrontation. \n\nIn fear of bad customer service and tight spaces, I wouldn't come back here again.", "author": "An L."}

The menu is very limited and changes daily.  During my visit they had a baguette topped with eggs, cereal, and bread pudding. They also had a pastry case with a few items (Meyer lemon bread, breakfast bread, 2 types of cookies) and one tart (coffee pecan) on a cake pedestal. You can buy bags of coffee ($10 and up) and Firebrand baguettes.\n\n* Rangur lime & cardamom cookie ($1): Thin, crispy, the right amount of sugar and salt, divinely scented, truly delicious\n* Baguette w/ hard-boiled eggs ($6.50):  There were three small slices of baguette, three halves of hard boiled eggs, saut\u00e9ed cold mushrooms and onions and a sprinkling of feta cheese crumbles.  The flavors were nice (and simple) but the stack of bread and egg was too tall to bite into simultaneously (very annoying), the portion was small...and the food was cold.  The crust of the bread was so chewy that you had to bite into it sideways.  For $6.50, I expect a little more effort, including not offering something so tall that you can't bite into it (and/or they baked the bread, they raised the hens that laid the eggs, they heat up the food, they add a side salad).\n\nI don't understand places like farm:table that don't make espresso drinks with non-fat or lowfat milk. That COMPLETELY annoys me.  Non-fat milk doesn't ruin a good cup of coffee and I actually don't like full fat milk.  They're not customer friendly in other ways including how they only accept cash and you have to get your own cookie from the pastry case.  Uhh, would it be too much effort for them to get my cookie for me?  For those prices, they should get my cookie and wrap it up with a bow.  Don't expect to find a seat - there's one big communal table and two small tables outside.\n\nEven considering the quality of their offerings, it's overpriced and customer unfriendly.\n\nCash only.", "author": "Lolia S."}

Now, I'm a detail Nazi when it comes to food; the slightest imperfection, it's game over.  So, when I got my plate of hard-boiled eggs on toast, I had to check for that ever-looming sign of miscalculation: the green ring around the yolk.  I don't mean to sound like an egg connoisseur, but I like my hard-boiled eggs just boiled enough, without the ammonia-taste that naturally accompanies an egg gone for too long of a soak.  The bacon bits were also a bit on the cold side...  I guess bacon has to be cooled down in order to be broken?  =\\  Everything else was grand.  The toast was warm and moist, perfect amount of melt-in-your-mouth avocado slices, all topped off with caramelized onions.\n\nFor something that I can make in the morning for much less without freezing my ass off coming here early in hopes of beating the crowd, I'd rather stay home.\nLove the concept, the ingredients, the table, but the food...  not so much.", "author": "Chase C."}

Anyway, the point is.. farm:table is SMALLER. There's a large table inside for seating, so you'll definitely share with strangers (or rather friends you haven't met yet). There are also some tables outdoors. I thought it was smart for them to cover the left wall with a mirror, b/c it gives the illusion that the room is bigger than it really is. I mean, it got me at first, I thought whoa, this place is bigger than I anticipated and then I realize that person I'm looking at looks exactly like me.. and uh, hello mirror reflection. \n\nAlthough the place is small, the food comes with big, bold, and strong flavors. I ordered their bread pudding with fresh strawberries and cream ($8) and iced coffee for ($4). Now, you're thinking, whoa, kind of pricey there.. and yes, I guess so. However, it was one of the best bread pudding I've had.. the flavors are rich and concentrated. Every single bite was satisfying. I also like that they use fresh farmer's market.. yay for supporting local businesses! In terms of coffee, they serve coffee from Verve, which is from Santa Cruz (and apparently, a well-received coffee joint). I think it's another plus that a couple of the baristas used to work at Blue Bottle, which gives them extra credibility. \n\nAnyway, it looks like their menu changes quite often (if not, daily), so farm:table tweets their menu via Twitter.

We came here for breakfast pretty regularly but after moving to a different neighborhood its been a while.\n\nWent back today for lunch. We ordered both lunch plates (beef sandwich & frittata)  because in the past everything has been very delicious. My heart sank when the plates were brought out because the portions have decreased quite a bit. Their previous ratios were spot on and combined with the pricing made it a very affordable option. The food itself seems to have lost some of its creativity. It wasn't as tasty as it used to be. They've always used good quality bread but the bread that came on my sandwich did not have enough integrity for the filling. The side salad was little more than a wilted garnish. The frittata was... fine, with the exception of egg shell.\n\nCustomer service is always good here, that's not the problem. Although it was strange to see the used plate/cutlery box overflowing - that can only take 30 seconds to bring inside.\n\nMaybe this place is better for breakfast but I don't think I will make a trip out there any time soon.", "author": "Marie J."}

What did not go unnoticed was the friendly/sweet staff. They really seem to enjoy what they do and I can appreciate that.\n\nThe brioche bread with eggs was just way too difficult to eat. The bread was too thick and hard to cut into which made sawing it with my knife a task alone, not to mention all the nibbles on top of it fell onto the table because the plate was too small. I also wish they made the eggs over easy so the runny yolk could soften the bread underneath or perhaps a light drizzle of sauce at LEAST.

I would recommend a Sunday brunch here to locals and tourists in the area. \n\nSERVICE: Quick & efficient. The first woman who took our order was friendly and helped us pick our a flavor of coffee. The woman busing the tables was just doing her job, not to social (minus 1/2 a star)\n\nFOOD: Now to the important stuff. The food here is fantastic! We had the mocha-java blend coffee. It was rich, sweet, and a perfect blend for breakfast. I ordered the brioche with braised pork and a poached egg ($9). The brioche is buttery with a crunchy crust. It was perfect for sopping up all the egg yolk. :) The braised pork was tender and flavorful. The best part is the perfectly poached egg on top (EVERYTHING is better with an egg on top!), cut open to let the golden yolk drip over the pork and brioche. It is also delicately topped with a small handful of rocket and chopped green onions. Perfect savory brunch for a busy day of shopping (or after a busy night of drinking...). My boyfriends choice for brunch was equally as good. He ordered the whole wheat toast topped with mascarpone, fresh sliced bananas, toasted hazelnuts, toasted pecans, and drizzled with a caramel sauce. It was sweet, filling, delicious! I could even imagine having this for dessert, it is that good! I would recommend ordering what ever sounds good, and then sharing this tasty treat for a sweet finale! \n\nATMOSPHERE: TINY!!!!! I can not express that enough. There is 1 (ONE) communal table inside that could seat max 8. There are also 2 smaller cafe-style tables outside to seat 2-3 (minus 1/2 a star, I like to be able to rely on having a seat.). They also are a CASH ONLY establishment, so be prepared.

They were buttery, flaky, just slightly doughy with the perfect amount of texture and thickness. These buttery buscuits were topped with thinly sliced fresh-from-the-garden Heirloom tomatoes which were lightly salted and picked at the peak of perfection. The next layer was, no joke, the best tasting smoked salmon I've tasted in a long while. Thinly sliced and just melted in your mouth. Next was one perfectly poached egg with a fluffy yet thick consistency and cut about a quarter of the way through - just enough so the yolk could spill out on to your buscuit. Their homemade hollandaise sauce was salty and savory and the perfect flavor combination to the salmon and tomatoes. \n\nNot only was this this best tasting benedict I've had in a long time it was also the most beautiful presentation I've seen. Complete with little purple and orange flower (edible) petals.

To be honest, bums are much more interesting than the normal Joe to observe. From them hacking their phlegm on the side of my car (boo) to their unique monologues, its never a dull day in the TL. When you walk up, it reminds me of a European Cafe with seating in the outside for people watching. Equipped with red doors, very French of them. The interior is small with one table that seats about 5. \n\nThe brunch menu is limited to one thing per day. Follow on twitter to find out what it is today. I was hoping they'd have soft eggs instead of hard boil eggs that day but none the less, it was a pretty tasty breakfast. Complimented with goat cheese, buttered baguette, country ham and arugula. If this is what farm people eat every day, sign me up for country livin'. So I gave them 3 stars because their brunch plate. \n\nThe coffee. Oh coffee. It's the core of my mornings. It started this morning with the Tender-nob similar to the Gibraltar at Blue Bottle for $2.75. The morning started out right. But then I needed more, so I got their latte with almond milk. And this is what made me demote its ratings. I've never been so unhappy post coffee consumption as I was that day. I need my coffee strong and its the taste that gives me a fake illusion that its keeping me up. This latte had NO coffee taste to it. None. I don't like it. I think it was the almond milk that muted the aromas and taste of caffeine. Hence, I learned I'm not a fan of almond milk. The ground almonds bothered my throat. It tasted like water. \n\nConclusion: In fairness, I can't say that I can make a fair judgment on their coffee just because I made the conscious decision to mess it with almond milk (something I don't like). Based on their Tender-nob, I do believe they serve a proper grade of coffee. So I'm going to come back and try it without the almond milk to see how it goes. The food was pretty good but yet to rate this place a 4.5 stars, I feel like its over-rated.

After paying $25 for more of a snack rather than a breakfast, they charge another dollar just for some more of their terrible, lukewarm, bitter coffee.

Very meat-y and gave me a horrible food coma afterwards.\n\n\nVery cute place with cute furnishing and cute graphics etc. but CROWDED. TINIEST PLACE EVER.

Yes, it is definitely small, maybe 10' x 10'.  There's one table with a couple of chairs and a bench.  But I don't pay for petite or small, I pay for food and service.\n\nThe service was pretty good, the two folks working the counter were quite nice, answered questions amicably and were otherwise attentive enough.  As for the food, it was fairly good, emphasizing fresh ingredients.  From the quite limited menu, I selected the:\n\n  Apple & Clothbound Cheddar Sandwich\n  Citrus - Cornmeal Cake\n  Cafe Latte\n\nThe sandwich was served open-faced [cheese not quite completely melted on half the sandwich], two small slices of bread, sliced apples covered in melted cheese served on a small plate. The bread was very good and the sandwich overall was tasty. The citrus cake was quite nice, a nice breakfast cake which went great with the coffee.\n\nSo, what's my beef, why just two stars?  Well, for $8.50 I was expecting a bit more -- at least a decent sized sandwich, or maybe a small, even tiny, side salad to garnish the plate, or piece of fruit or, well, you get the picture. The citrus-cornmeal cake was $4.75. The single latte wasn't cheap either at $3.50.  And there you have it.  With tax my little lunch added up to $18!  \n\nSorry farm:table, I don't care if you are fresh or cute or whatever, your price-performance ratio is way out of whack.", "author": "Tom Y."}

No, I didn't wake up there and no this was not the result of a tragic Saturday night I don't remember.  I went there to check out biscuit Sunday at farm:table.\n\nThis is my 130th review, and only my 15th 5 star.  The whole experience was wonderful.  We sat at one of the little tables outside on the sidewalk, and it was sunny and pleasant.  The staff was friendly and the service was great.  It was even prompt which surprised me considering the number of people there and the size of the kitchen.  \n\nAnd the biscuits, oh the biscuits...  the devilish love child of butter and flour... were wickedly delicious.  I had the biscuit with poached egg and greens with mustard butter - absolutely amazing.  Everything was fresh, the egg was perfectly poached (in the shell) and yolk tied together the the buttery biscuits, the bitter greens, and the spicy mustard perfectly.  It was served with a little pickled carrot, which was also wonderful.  \n\nI kept seeing out of the corner of my eye that several people were getting the biscuits with strawberries and honey ricotta.  Now,  one of the ways I am trying to make a difference in the world is by trying to start a trend of eating dessert after breakfast.  So of course, for the cause, and because I couldn't resist the call of those juicy, sexy, red strawberries, we ordered one of those too.  It was wonderful, and the dollop of rhubarb jam was a lovely touch. \n\nCoffee is usually pretty important for me at brunch because it counteracts the food coma that brunch usually induces.  But you can just come and enjoy the coffee for its deliciousness because they don't supersize the food portions here.  I guess you *can* have brunch and not feel the need to chase it with a nap.\n\nfarm:table represents a perfect execution of all the wonderful food/culture ideals so quintessential to San Francisco - the ingredients are seasonal, local, and farm fresh; the flavors are clean and refined; the one farm table fosters community around food; and they tweet their menu twice daily.  it's like eating everything great about San Francisco in every bite!", "author": "Linda L."}

Even for the boyfriend--a Starbucks zealot--the coffee here definitely impressed him if not reopened his eyes to the world of REAL coffee (he always forgets its existence). \n\nFor 4.80 they make a mean mocha. Gritty, not too sweet, milk just hot enough, it was perrrfection. Their food/breakfast alike are actually average in price. Try the boiled eggs served on top of a baguette with asparagus and shaved Parmesan. I personally enjoyed eating my breakfast at the community table, sharing newspapers with others, and writing over an already completed Sudoku puzzle, but if you like your space take your order to go. There is maybe one more table outside that seats two, but that concludes the seating provided here. \n\nThe friendly barrister gave me a sample of the dark chocolate he used to make my coffee and happily shared facts about their beans, though my short-term memory has failed me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-24", "description": "Ah, the new darling of Yelp. It was because of its high-rating that caused me to visit farm:table in first place. You know, time to see what everyone was talking about.\n\nWhat I found was a tiny space with one semi-large indoor table, and two outdoor tables. A cafe that could sit a maximum of a dozen people. The idea itself sounds challenging, especially in a world of Starbucks and Peets that house multiple tables and are created with the mindset that the coffee shop should be your third \"home\" (after your real home and work, of course.) So how could farm:table do the same thing with such a small space?\n\nI'm not sure if I have the answer, but I will say that my first visit turned out to be pleasant and quaint. As my friend and I sat at the table, a rotation of about 6 others joined and left the table. It wasn't a lounge spot, but you never felt pressured to gulp down your coffee to avoid the leering stares of people waiting for a seat. It simply was a place to be, for a moment, in a moment of tranquility.\n\nWhat works to its advantage is its locale. It is a bit out of the way for many people, unless they live in the Tendernob hill area. I honestly can't see myself making the trip on MUNI simply to have a coffee and sit at this table. So perhaps it will always be a place in flux.\n\nBut to its product: the iced coffee was served in a mason jar and was quite delicious. The menu changes daily, and consists of only two or three things. The food was adequate, although a bit small for my liking. The service was quite amazing and you could tell that even though this place was a bit new to the neighborhood, its owners were establishing good rapport with some consistent customers.\n\nA good cup of coffee and a nice change of pace, but honestly, not going to make a special trip to go here. It will be a good place to visit whenever I'm visiting the neighborhood.", "author": "Bryan B."}

We went for breakfast this morning and I had the daily toast with homemade almond butter, coconut flakes and sliced bananas. My companera had hard-boiled eggs served over toasted bread with habanero chutney and feta cheese. Both dishes were really yummy (even though I preferred mine) and just right in the portion size for a breakfast that doesn't leave one full and bloated. \n\nThe food here is super duper fresh and they way they juxtapose the contrasting flavors shows a real flair and knowledge of pairing. The coffee drinks are tasty and rich. You even get little designs in the crema of the cappuccinos and caffe lattes :) \n\nI had read about the one communal table in the place and I somehow envisioned a long banquet table accommodating several people. But the place is so tiny that the actual table is only about four feet by four feet. Yeah, you might be asked to get up and move over a couple times to let others sit with you but it's really not that big of a deal. It's actually quite intimate and even lends to conversation amongst strangers, which is what a big city like San Francisco can use more of now and then. There are also a couple of small two-tops outside. \n\nI will make an effort to go back here and try this place again the next time I am in the city. I'm anticipating they will eventually move to another location to accommodate the growing number of fans.

(But after posting this it says I only have 760 reviews? wtf)\n\nI admire this place but I cannot vouch for their drinks. Their drinks look really good; unfortunately, I already had my sugar and caffeine medication for the day (brownie/coffee). The drink menu hosts a comfortable amount of different coffees and other non-caffeinated drinks such as apple cider. Along with drinks they have a modest selection of cookies and pastries available.\n\nTheir food menu consisted of three dishes that change daily. On this particular day it consisted of a sandwich, a salad, and a soup. They all sounded really good. I choose the beef sandwich with grilled onions and horseradish gorgonzola.\n\nThe sandwich is yummy. The bread is super cashmere soft with chewy crust. The beef is surprisingly tender. Everything else in the sandwich works just great. They also give you a mini apple that is super sweet. The sandwich was really good but it doesn't justify the near $9 price tag. I think $6 would be more appropriate. Some chips or fries and a pickle on the side would have been a great addition as well. I guess this is downtown pricing?\n\nThe interior is just what the name suggests, a communal farm table with a jug of water. The table seats 8-10 people in the center of the room. That's basically it for the dining room. The rest is a small kitchen where they churn out all the food and beverages. The chalkboard menu is along the front of the cashier wall. Everything is minimal but done with a tasteful eye. Keep in mind that there isn't a bathroom. Not a place for groups or business meetings.\n\nThe staff is very friendly. There were two women and one bearded Elijah Woods looking fellow, all working the kitchen/cashier. You don't even have to pay until you're done. They clearly have a devoted following because each customer would hash up a conversation like they were old pals. This place became crazy busy in the afternoon.\n\nThe customer base looks just like the staff. Middle-aged seldom arm tattooed folk that could only originate from the Bay Area or Seattle. I witnessed: a lot of iPhone texters, a group of girlfriends complementing one's ass, a Bape-wearing couple, and a long haired skater-looking dude giving the staff tupperware for them to put his food in.

With the small space and good reviews, I expected the experience to be characterized by good food, but with a little bit of a struggle for space, etc., especially because we had a reasonably large group for the size of the place.  But aside from a really minor wait and squeeze in the beginning, it was wonderful.  Some lovely people at the common table moved over a bit so that we could sit together and not be super-cramped, and we had a brief, fun conversation with them.  The people working there were equally awesome; they were really friendly. The ambiance of the place, at least in our experience, was really cozy and friendly -- as opposed to cramped.  It doesn't hurt that it's a lovely space.\n\nAs for the food, I thought it was simple, fresh and really good.  I had the toast with cherry tomatoes and egg, as did two others in our group; the toast was a good consistency and the egg was perfectly done.  (I didn't share others' experiences of the bread being really thick or tough.)  We also had the bread pudding, which was unusual -- the texture wasn't as homogeneous as other bread pudding that I've had, but it actually really enhanced the dish, in my view.  The iced coffee was so good that two others in the group had it after they tasted mine -- even though we each had already had a coffee.

It's incredibly drinkable coffee that is, in my opinion, better than Blue Bottle: sweet, clean, and smooth... Yes, this is your cue to go there NOW and try it!!\n\nThe table space inside is limited to one large community table (love this idea) and a few small tables out on the sidewalk.

The frittata was perfection as well, a light almost creamy puff of eggs with the saltiness of the ham and asparagus, and it was served with an absolutely glorious aioli.

We had to poke our reflections in the mirrorred wall to make sure there was no dining room, and what we were looking at was our own reflection. However, it is not the point.\nI tried hard to find the menu, but I failed. So asked the person taking the order where I could look at the options. He pointed at the wall on my left where I found 2 items: bread pudding and a toast with mascarpone, hazelnuts, bananas, etc. \nREALLY?  I would never imagine myself coming to SF from the East Coast to a place with two items on the menu!!\nI decided to be rude and ask for eggs. Oh, ran out...\nO-K...\nSo, my friends and I grabbed the table. LITERALLY, THE TABLE, as there is only one, and it is really small...and decided to try both menu items...you know, just for the hell of it!\nThe bread pudding was runny and gross. I can make better pudding with saltine crackers and water. \nThe toasts came out with a 20 min interval: the first one had a ton of mascarpone and honey. I had to catch the pieces of banana sliding of the bread  all over THE table. The second toast had no nuts on it, although the recipe was promising hazelnuts and pecans. They must have run out of nuts...and had to come up with a quick substitute- pecan shells! By the way, both \"toasts\" were not toasted...\n\nThe latte I ordered tasted pretty good though- two stars for that, but I have to take one back for CASH ONLY policy.\n\nOh, to all yelpers who gave the place and its food  5 stars: even a 5 year-old can pull off an egg on pork and leafy greens or an untoasted toast with mascarpone and sliced banana for $8.

The second thing I noticed is that the restaurant has an extremely limited menu.  I soon realized that the chef chose to focus on just a few dishes each day -- and to do them well.\n\nOn the day I arrived, there was just 1 sandwich, 1 soup, and 1 type of oatmeal to choose from, along with a few pastries, coffees and house-made drinks.  I ordered the bbq pork shoulder sandwich and the white bean and ham hock stew.  The sandwich was delicious -- tender, flavorful bbq pork, topped with coleslaw and paprika aioli, and complemented nicely with a pickled carrot and pepper.  Smoky, tangy, and spicy!  The white bean and ham hock stew came with a poached egg (with runny yolk) floating on top and was pretty good, but a little bland.  But it wasn't something that a dash of salt and pepper couldn't fix!  After that, the soup was great.  \n\nI arrived 5 minutes before closing, so it was pretty empty inside.  I could see how the experience might have been frustrating, if I came during a busy meal time.   \n\nI noticed that they have a trail of giant ant stickers on the wall leading up to the pastry area.  It's not the most appetizing thing to look at, while you're sitting there eating . . . \n\nOverall, I had a very good dining experience.  The staff was so nice.", "author": "Candice J."}

They serve Verve Roasters coffee and it's excellent, definitely a break from the typical \"cup o' joe\" you get at most of the neighborhood coffee shops. Considering that I've probably tasted the worst cafe coffee at other joints in the neighborhood, I'll pay extra for this quality brew. \n\nI had a delicious breakfast, toasted baguette with almond butter, bosc pears, and dried currants. It was a bit pricey but for the size of their space (VERY SMALL) I understand why. It's a cut above. \n\nSitting in the space was a bit like sitting in someone else's kitchen. Everyone seemed to know everyone else...except me. It got crowded quickly (maybe 8 people) but that's part of the ambiance. I'm going to keep it in mind and go back when I don't have to be at work right at 8 so I can see what else they cook up. I like that the menu changes regularly and it's always imaginative.

It's not (as the staff member I said this to said) that the portions are on the the small side. It's that the food itself is so different. \n\nThe English language is inadequate to describe their dishes in the space allowed by the menu chalkboard.\n\nTake the pear cardamom bread pudding (don't you dare -- it's mine, all mine). Okay, what you might expect is a bunch of tiny, soft pieces of bread in pears cooked to a pudding-y mush. What you actually get is slices of baguette in an scrambled-egg-pieces-of-diced-pear such that the edges of the bread is soft and the juice has soaked in a bit but the bread retains it's crusty chewyness. Five stars, and the trip to France is included.  After two visits, five stars for the food is not out of the routine for this place.\n\nAlas, beverages have been a two-star experience for me. The house juice, while interesting, was slightly bitter. And the hot chocolate, while creamily-dreamily smooth, seems to this spoiled-by-Mexican-hot-chocolate hot chocolate lover to suffer from a near-absence of chocolate. \n\nSo, I will definitely go back for the food. But, as I don't drink coffee and rarely drink tea, I suspect my potential drink choices will get fewer to non-existant.\n\nBTW, I'm cool with the communal table (or turning the outside tables into one with a polite request if they're really busy). Just emphasizes that French experience.\n\n(Full disclosure: I've never been to France and rarely set foot inside a French restaurant, so any transporting or allusions to French cooking is purely in my imagination.)", "author": "Charles B."}

The perfect hang-out: warm hosts who are so connected with what they do, inventive simple meals using sublimely fresh ingredients, casually creative ambience reminiscent of NY before the 2000s boom - with poetry books, Marx, New Yorker, etc. - and the urbanity of spontaneous communality. I do find the portion size to be small for the price, and I'm not a big eater, but the drinks are reasonably priced. Note: If one isn't in the mood for strangers asking questions, it might then be better to skip farm: table. I twinge with embarrassed guilt about my cold demeanor towards a man with whom I was sharing a small bench; at that hour I just felt like reading, not chatting about the book I had in front of me - unrealistic of me to expect a modicum of personal space in such a tiny restaurant.", "author": "Eliza S."}

A morsel of strawberries in one dish and an egg-and-a-half in the other - with loads of white bread as filler.\n\nIt may have been good white bread, but lots of people aren't eating wheat, and certainly white bread is one of our more unhealthy habits. Plus, it just looks cheap.\n\nAgain, nice idea, but especially in the tenderloin there should be some healthy food involved at a reasonable price.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-09", "description": "This place is great.  I live fairly close, and I love that they twitter their daily AM and PM menus so I always consider their menu before thinking about my other options.  The food that I have had so far has been amazing.  The portions are a great size, and the prices are a bit expensive for my budget, but not for what you get in terms of quality food.  I'm the type of person who loves to find a favorite item at every restaurant I go to, and stick with that one dish.  Farm:Table isn't really a place where I can do that, but I'm ok with it because their food never lets me down.  The coffee is REALLY good too, however, it's expensive so I don't get it regularly.", "author": "Lizzy G."}

The atmosphere of this small, intimate and friendly place was quite nice.  The food (green pea and english leek quiche, poached eggs, ham and toasted bread) were good, though not great.  Chiefly, $60 for breakfast for four seemed a bit steep for the quantity and quality of the food.  To be fair, the meatloaf sandwich for the lunch menu looked generous and superb.

The food is tasty and worth stopping in for.  Always creative, healthy and satisfying.  I stopped in the other day and got a latte and a chocolate cardamon cookie- the latte was not as good as when guy is doing his thing.  The cookie was too hard and dry, more like a dog biscuit texture than what they were aiming for.  My friend had the \"morning toast\" and loved it.  I still remember a piece of Lemon Meringue pie someone brought me from there last year, will that come back again? and then there were those tiny chocolate shortbread cookies in a jar...  I have also had the various soups, super delicious.  Most sandwiches made here I would drive out of my way to have.  In the past I had a most delicious chocolate layer cake and some tasty breakfast cakes, I have the feeling the owner is not baking these any longer. Overall, so super worthwhile.", "author": "margot R."}

There is no coffee service with a scowl or 'f*#! you' for trying to get something to eat here (you know that attitude that seems to poison so many san francisco coffee houses). The service is always pleasant. The cloth napkins. The food. The coffee. The community table. Everything just seems to work. Making a leisurely mid-day visit to farm:table is like getting a massage, going to therapy, and returning home to the excited greeting of a loved one all wrapped up in one. The prices seem just right for the quality of the food and drink. I wish I could visit daily.", "author": "David H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-13", "description": "Truly what I'd like to give them is 3.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't let you do halfies just yet.   In any case, this review is really just a partial review, as I haven't had a meal there just yet, just coffee and a breakfast cake/muffin, etc.  I stopped by a few times in the last week or so to get a cup of Americano to go, which is very very good.  Their coffee is delicious, and I love the little fixin's bar just outside the door where I can add my splash of housemade almond milk.  The orange olive oil (?) breakfast cake slice I had was incredible also.  Why only 3 stars? 1) $2.50 for a tiny cup of Americano and $3 for a  2 x 3\" slice of sweetened bread? Pricey!  2) staff has a little attitude and my only chance for a smile is when I actually hand over my money; 3) it's super duper small in there, so if there's one or two people before me, the wait is long and unpleasant because I'm standing over other people who are sitting and eating at a large corner table.  I do plan to go back and try the food though, because it looks very good and if the quality is even close to that of the coffee, it's worth a shot.", "author": "Kate C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-13", "description": "I'll admit that I was a bit weary going into farm:table.  It seems as though the expression farm to table is giving gastropub a run for its money as the most abused term in the food industry.  Regardless, I was curious to see why farm:table was so hot on SF Yelp.  I was quite surprised to see how small the space was.  The dining room consists of one large table.  They also have two small bistro tables outside the front door - and since the inside was overrun with hostellers and the SF chilly winter morning feels practically tropical in comparison to Denver's winters, we were happy to sit outside.  The kitchen is also tiny - and very crowded with three employees busting out food and drinks.  The coffee menu is standard, with high quality coffee served just about any way you want it.  The presentation of the coffee is fab, with mason jars, beautiful mugs and heart shapes carved into the milk foam.  The food menu is simple.  They don't serve gut busting, food coma inducing, greasy breakfast here.  Just simple variations of toast with super fresh ingredients.  We got the daily toast topped with hard boiled eggs, mushrooms, and chevre.  It was simple, but it exploded with fresh flavors.  We also split their breakfast sandwich of the day, a mix of eggs, ham, and pesto sandwiched between a crusty baguette.  Double yum!  Powered by coffee and a light breakfast, we were ready to rumble around SF for the day.", "author": "Thomas S."}

So I turned to my Yelp iphone app of course and fell in love with the picture of that boiled egg sandwich at farm:table. So I strolled two blocks uphill (always achy calves in SF) to this little gem. It's tiny. I mean tiny - one table tiny. But it's a farm table so you all sit together. Cute. The guy and gal working there were so nice and cool. I was alone and I'm a little shy but felt really welcomed. They made me up that egg sandwich with shaved asparagus, parm and olive oil. Oh man! It's heaven. The baguette is toasted and it's a little hard to maneuver - I bent the fork trying to cut into it. It's a beautiful dish, totally form over function but once you get all the right stuff on your fork - and you actually get it into your mouth, it's bliss. I was alone so I couldn't get all \"Mmmmmm,\" you know?  My farm table neighbor had the toast with mascarpone and strawberries - hello, I loved my dish AND had food envy. I took a pound of their coffee home so when I attempt to make that mascarpone toast in my Brooklyn kitchen, I'll have their coffee to bring me right back to that little table in California.", "author": "Modemme X."}

I don't normally write reviews but due to the fact I have gradually lost interest in going, to the point I no longer desire my daily coffee here, I feel the need to write about how sad I am they are no longer what they used to be. I used to love the same familiar faces which included the awesome owner, Kate. Super friendly down to earth people who knew how to perfectly craft coffee/espresso and make deliciously salivating food. As time went on, farm:table started getting more and more crowded as it seemed more people discovered just how great this place was. Things began to change. It started with the constant meatloaf sandwiches on the menu, smothered in ketchup. I could somewhat deal with that by just not ordering it but then a whole new staff came in, only to see the faces I knew so well only here and there. I'd order a coffee I would always order on a warm day in the past only to be told they had something else instead. Even my usual latte is not as silky sweet as it once was. I've stopped going but the past two times my boyfriend has gone, he has left feeling sick from the overtly rich and oddly spiced soup. Perhaps the soup doesn't suit his stomach, regardless, I'm sad to say, the new chef is not so great. And I really don't understand why this meatloaf deserves it's very own day.
