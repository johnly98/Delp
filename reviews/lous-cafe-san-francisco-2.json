Even one year later, my parents still love the roast beef sandwich, and I still love the delicious veggie-licious sandwich on Dutch crunch. Happy to support a small local business!\n\nSolid sandwich shop with the best Dutch crunch. I ordered a roast beef mushroom sandwich for my dad. He absolutely loved it, especially with all the meat and flavors, and he's pretty difficult to please. I ordered a veggie delish on Dutch crunch and also loved all the packed veggies (avocado and roasted red peppers!!!) and special sauce, which paired well with the crunchiness of the bread.

I saw a \"eat 24 / pick up\" sign at their counter. I figured, why not just order online instead of waiting in their long line. It turns out I actually placed the order at their Taraval location & that their Geary location doesn't even accept orders online via Eat 24.

My go to is the Veggie-which is loaded with sprouts, tomatoes, lettuce, roasted red peppers, avocado and Swiss cheese (I sometimes leave the cheese off.) It comes on a multi grain roll and when toasted is sheer perfection! Every visit has yielded fresh ingredients, fairly quick service and a nice clean and spacious seating area.\nThe Lou's sauce is not to be skipped-that adds a not to spicey but just enough flavor of a kick. They're also very accommodating with changing ingredients on the set menu items-once in a while I sub in Dutch Crunch. Don't forget to ask for your stamp card-10 stamps and then you get a free sandwich. \nThere is metered street parking on Taraval but if you drive up the hill a few blocks there is ample free street parking as well.

I've been going to the Richmond District location on 14th and Geary for as long as I can remember when I lived there, but as of a year and a half ago, I moved to the Sunset District and was not able to go there as much. Now that there's a Lou's Cafe in the Sunset District, I find myself going often once again. What can I say, this place is addictive. May I even say some of the best sandwiches in the city are made here? I think so. Easily.\n\nThis spot has a very diverse menu. I'm talking 30+ sandwiches to chose from, and every single one is delicious. You really can't go wrong with any selection and could end up coming here for months and still not trying all that they have to offer. My personal favorite is the BBQ Chicken sandwich. While it may be a bit saucy and can get your hands sticky, it's well worth it. Another personal favorite is Roma's Club. That's the one I got on my last visit (see the picture I took). It's absolutely crisp, fresh and the flavor is top notch. Another thing that's so great about Lou's is the stamp cards they offer. By no means an original trend, but considering this place is already addictive, there's no doubt you'll eventually reach a free sandwich. \n\nPro tip: NEVER turn down the jalape\u00f1o sauce. It's a gem and one of the best sauces I've ever had.", "author": "Alex B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-29", "description": "With over twenty different sandwich styles to choose from, Lou's surely doesn't disappoint when it comes to balancing flavors and offering a great deal for portion size. Sandwiches are huge and filling, averaging $8 or $9.\n\nSo far, I've tried their Chicken Pesto, Ami-cado, and Risky Business. The Chicken Pesto has a nice and creamy pesto aioli that isn't too rich or heavy. There's just enough spread to moisten the soft and fluffy sweet roll without it becoming too soggy. Lou's Ami-cado (pastrami, salami, avocado, and cheese) is one of their most popular sandwiches, with smokey pastrami and salty salami meats balanced with the buttery and creamy fresh avocado. The Risky Business (pastrami brisket, imitation crab salad, bacon, avocado, pepperoncini, cheese) gets a little messy with all those ingredients, yet it's deliciously salty from the meats, creamy from the crab salad, and buttery from the avocado. If you're in for sandwich adventure, try the Risky Business.\n\nLou's jalape\u00f1o spread has a mild kick to it, but it's not too spicy and definitely doesn't linger. All sandwiches can be altered to your liking, ie: eliminating or adding extra ingredients, swapping one bread roll for another, etc.\n\nThe original Lou's is in the Inner Richmond, but I'm glad they opened a second location in Parkside. It makes a great addition to the heavily-residential neighborhood. Lou's is definitely one of my new go-to shop to satisfy my deli-meat style sandwich cravings.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

They have fresh quality ingredients, a killer secret sauce, and creative combinations that'll make your head spin. Their sammies and menu concept are similar in style to Ike's. \n\nTheir new location has capitalized on all the uncontrollable downsides their sister shop on Geary has. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only person who was annoyed by the cash register being literally feet from the door, creating an instant line and a road block for people trying to get out. The chips are also visible before you order, instead of hiding on the other side of the counter, and there is more parking, seating, and space at the Taraval location. Diggin' the cheerful orange walls too! \n\nI've never met a sandwich I didn't like here. Honestly, just order whatever strikes your fancy from their giant menu, and you won't be disappointed. But if you're still having trouble, here are some of my favorites: \n\n1) Risky Business \n2) Hot Pastrami \n3) Lou-Ben\n4) Ami-Cado\n\nThe first time I was here, they forgot to switch my requested bread to dutch crunch, and the second time, they ran out of torpedo bread for my breakfast omelette sandwich, but their sandwiches are so yummy that all is forgiven. The staff are always super chill and friendly and they have punchcards if you're a frequent fatty sandwich eater.

I've had the Geary location bookmarked for awhile, but glad to see that they've opened up in the Sunset.  \n\nIt was a hard choice since everything looks so good, but I went with the Hot & Sweet.  The hot & sweet comes with hot links, pineapple slices, cheese, teriyaki sauce, alongside the usual Lou's fixings (I omitted pickles and the jalapeno sauce).  He went with the chicken pesto.  The chicken pesto came with chicken breast slices, cheese, avocado, and pesto sauce (with the usual Lou's fixings, omitted pickles)  Both were listed on the menu as under different breads but we both love Dutch Crunch so we asked for it that way.  It only took a few minutes to make and they were hefty!\n\nMy sandwich was so messy, but so tasty!  Hot links weren't really spicy but plump and juicy.  The teriyaki and pineapple worked well with the Lou's sauce.  The dutch crunch was nice and chewy.  The quality in the sandwich is here.  His chicken pesto was great too; as the pesto wasn't too strong.  I liked the little subtleness of the jalapeno sauce.  \n\nWe still love Little Lucca's but Lou's Cafe is a great deli and affordable in the area (sammies under $8), so 5 stars for location, quality ingredients, affordable prices and tastiness!

It also comes with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, red onions, and jalape\u00f1o spread.  The sandwich is flavorful, but the pastrami and salami makes it a bit too salty.  Good thing Lou's special sauce and the jalape\u00f1o spread kicks the flavor up a notch as it has just the right amount of spice. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed my sandwich, I wished they gave me dutch crunch, which was noted when I placed the order.

My personal go-to's are the breakfast sandwiches but I've been trying their other sandwiches for lunches. One time, I ordered the Ami-Cado and thought there was jalapenos in them, which I prefer not to have. I didn't realize it was only the spread and almost missed out. Mark gave me a side of spread and that's when I realized that that stuff is like crack. The Lou's special sauce is delicious too. \n\nAlso, don't miss out on the clam chowder. It's heavy on the potatoes but I think that's okay too cuz there's still a good mix of clammy stuff but what reallyyyy tops it off is the little cheesy bread they give you for the soup. OMG it's like a little amuse bouche but not. \n\nIf you find yourself coming here often, don't forget your stamp card. I think we've already scored 2 or 3 free sandwiches from me and the bf combined. \n\nIn terms of costs, the breakfast sandwiches are a good size for the $5.50-$6.50 you spend. In regards to the larger sandwiches, I am able to split the sandwich for lunch 1 day and lunch the next day with a side of chowder for day 1 and a bag of chips for day 2 and am happy with my meal. I would say the prices are very worth it.\n\nI'm happy they changed their hours just a little as it's very hard for me to grab a sandwich before 6pm after work and they open later than I start in the morning so this is a good adjustment for me.", "author": "Clarizeyale R."}

There was only a few people there, so I got my sandwich pretty fast, in and out in around 10 mins. The workers seem a little confused because the lady that took my order didn't give me my number/receipt, therefore I didn't know when to pick up my sandwich. However I do understand that the place is new and I guess they're still getting the hang of it and working out the kinks.\n\nI loved the sandwich! I got the ami-cado on dutch crunch instead of the soft and sweet roll, and the dutch crunch was delicious!! Didn't cut up my mouth either, like some sandwich places do. The jalapeno spread added a small kick to it while the creamy avo cooled my mouth down. :D The only disappointing thing was that my sandwich wasn't as big as I expected from the pictures I've seen on yelp! It wasn't stuffed with meat/veggies, instead it was pretty flat. I was impressed by the taste but definitely let down by the size. Maybe next time the sizes will be more consistent /:\n\nLou's is a 3.5 for me but hopefully it'll increase to a 4 the next time I visit!

They were really nice about it, no extra charges or anything.

Freshly baked and perfectly toasted bread with Boars head meat (the highest quality), lettuce, tomato, red onion, and a uniquely spicy jalape\u00f1o spread. The sandwich is HUGE and can easily be split into two portions. I had one half for lunch and the second came in handy a few hours later on the long drive back. My bf got the sausage link sandwich with some of the creamiest New England chowder I've tasted which could easily rival a Boston original.

I usually design my own sandwiches (I'm a little picky and don't eat cheese) and their ingredients never disappoint. Hot pastrami, Roma's club, ami-cado, and the tuna melt are some of the ones I tried back when I did eat cheese and those were all yummy. All their meats are Boar's Head brand which is top-shelf in my opinion, and the bread is always fresh. The breakfast sandwiches are also great, whoever came up with the idea to put a big hashbrown on a bacon & egg sammie AND on ciabatta is a genius.

The Roma Club, with the Dutch Crunch bread, was definitely the yummiest.  The sandwiches are definitely large enough to share.  There were 3 of us and we each ordered our own sandwich so we had leftovers we brought home.  I think pretty much any sandwich there would be good.

A large menu featuring some of the most disturbing sando combinations on any planet, many would be illegal back east and fairly fast service.  The amount of food is reasonable and the quality is ok, they use Boars Head meat, a \"chain\" service that many places use.  There soup is out of the box and passable.  \n\n   Yeah, I got it, I'm not hip.  I still believe a pastrami sando should be served on rye beard with yellow mustard and that's it.  I don't think seafood and deli meat should be in anyone's mouth at the same time and a sando, drink and chips should not cost 10 bucks.  I am going to have to get used to a changing world.

The ingredients speak for themselves ~ amazing! The veggie-licious was also just as it's name describes it. But it took over 30 mins to come in, order two sandwiches, and leave! Some people ahead of us must have been ordering a dozen sandwiches because they were standing at the cashier forever, three people cut the line (one was a to-go order), and another person who phoned in an order was able to jump in-front of the line as well. After a long wait to order, the wait for the sandwiches to be made was also looong. In addition to the long wait, me being super hungry probably contributed to my impatience and sour attitude towards my experience. On the positive side, the food tastes good, the store is clean, they have stamp cards, and the workers are not rude.

This location is way bigger than the Geary location and has way more parking options. I'm like a broken record in my reviews because I always stick to one item from a restaurant but when I like something, I LIKE IT. And in this case, it's the tuna melt on a wheat roll (hold the pickles, bleh). I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food, but the jalapeno spread is more tasty than spicy. If I can handle the subtle heat, anyone can believe me. The sandwiches are a pretty decent size, so when I'm hungry, it does it's thing filling me up.

I enjoyed the hot link, a friend enjoyed the Roma's Club, and the hot pastrami might be the best, most unique I've ever had.  Fresh dutch crunch roll, lean brisket, tasty veggies and cheese, and the combination of jalape\u00f1o spread and Lou's Special Sauce (trust them, you want them together on your sandwich!) give it a great kick!  There's a nice selection of drinks and kettle-cooked chips to round out your meal.  Salads, soups, and breakfast also available, though I haven't had those.\n\nWhat a great new find.  Thanks Yelp!  The newer Lou's is just a short drive from pretty much anywhere in the southwestern corner of the City or Daly City.  Go once, get a stamp card (10th sandwich is free) and go back often!  But heed the street signs and meters -- SF DPT are vultures around there!", "author": "Howard S."}

(both sandwiches) everything on the sandwich was on point, but i really wish the sandwich was a bit more toasted for the amount of time i waited.  the cheese wasn't all that melted either.  next time, i'll probably tell them to toast it longer?  not sure if it's the style for them to jus lightly toast it, but i just prefer the nice crunch.\n\ni will be back!!!  i'm excited to try other things on the menu and also the choice to make your own sandwich!", "author": "Josie L."}

The combo of their sauce and spread gives a nice kick at the end. The ingredients blended in together nicely. The only downfall is to eat it shortly after ordering. I took it back to my office immediately to eat and the bread was already beginning to soak in the juices from the eggplant / peppers / tomatoes. But it was still soooooo good!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-18", "description": "The sandwiches are pretty good here. My boyfriend ordered his sandwich on the sourdough roll and he said it was really dry and lacked sauce even though we ordered the sandwich with \"everything on it\" which comes with special sauce and jalape\u00f1o spread AND we added pesto aioli. He said the sandwich was really dry and almost inedible because of the amount of bread. My sandwich was on Dutch crunch and I didn't seem to have any problems as it was pretty tasty but definitely had noticeably less bread than my boyfriend's sandwich. The sandwiches were okay but there are definitely better places in the area to pick up a solid sandwich (like the Submarine Center in West Portal). The location on Taraval is definitely roomier than the one on Geary and it's easier to find parking but the service here isn't that great.... I came in and ordered a whole bunch of food (4 sandwiches, 2 soups, a bunch of drinks, chips, salad, and coffee) and spent a good amount of money and I ended up leaving without half the items I paid for! After requesting a paper receipt on the iPad they have for check out, I didn't receive a receipt... I went and had a seat to wait for my items. About 15 mins later my sandwiches were ready and they called my name to pick up my order. Now, I understand it is my responsibility to check and make sure that I receive all the items I ordered, but after waiting for 15 minutes it slipped my mind and to be honest when they call your name for an order and hand you a few bags, you expect them to be handing you your entire order... Right?! Anyway, we left with only the sandwiches, salad, and the drinks I had already put in my bag. Only after driving home and stepping outside into the cold did I realize that I WASN'T HOLDING A HOT COFFEE! I called the shop to let them know I was coming back for the coffee that I had forgotten and they were very nice about it and told me they would make it right away. Luckily I only live 10 blocks away so it wasn't the end of the world. After driving back to the store, and waiting for my coffee I realized... HEY I DIDN'T GET MY SOUPS! I informed the girl who took my order and she seemed very confused about the situation. They reprinted my receipt only to tell me that they had only charged me for one soup! Overall it was a pretty big headache and not exactly what I would call exceptional customer service.... Like I said before I know I should have noticed the missing items but I mean, shouldn't they have given me my complete order....? So 4 stars for the food because all of our \"design your own\" sandwiches were made just as we ordered them but weren't necessarily the tastiest and the soup of the day (chicken noodle) was absolutely delicious but the service gets a solid 2 stars because.... Really? This was my first time at this location so I'll give them another try.

Is it just not on?  This has happened before so I ask for it EXTRA toasted.  No dice.  Still like it was just taken out of the store bought package.  My dining partners sandwich wasn't toasted either.  Maybe because it was Dutch Crunch?  I don't have this problem at the Geary location.  Perfect every time.
