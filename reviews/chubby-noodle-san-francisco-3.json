Essentially, you get a 90-minute slot with bottomless dim sum/menu drinks. There is usually some wiggle room for the previous party leaving and your party wrapping up - so it ends up being almost 2 hours. We called for a reservation a few days in advance and could only get bar seats for a party of 3, so plan ahead! The meal includes 15 mix & match dim sum from the menu, and different items are continuously brought out (it's kinda interesting to not be in charge of what you are going to eat - I discovered a lot of things that I wouldn't have otherwise tried!). Although portions don't seem big, they are very very filling. We couldn't make it to all 15; even 8 was an overwhelming amount of food. I highly recommend the shrimp, noodles, and the cucumber salad (trust me!). Enjoy!!", "author": "Margarita F."}

The music was so loud it felt like we were eating in a night club.\nWe ordered the garlic noodles with fried chicken. Which was pretty good. And also the Korean tacos, which was ok. \nI thought the prices were high, and the portions were small for the price.\nThe plating was nothing fancy, it was average.\nThey do have a nice beer selection.

The service and the concept was A+ but the food and drink were all consistently lacking for me.\n\nWe came here on a Sunday at their 12 pm brunch session. For those that of you that don't know, on Sundays, you need to generally make a reservation and they have 2 hour intervals where you can get unlimited drinks and dim sum. On the drinks list, they have 3 - a mimosa, sangria, and a light beer, and for the food, they have a variety of about 14-15 dishes, all varieties of fusion food influenced from Korea, China, Taiwan, etc. We walked in and they gave us a menu and told us (after looking at the menu) that all they would need is our dietary restrictions and they would give us food as they recommend. Dish by dish they came, super izakaya style. It was a totally hands-off approach and really accommodated for one of those in our group who was vegetarian.\n\nBecause I am relatively well versed in Asian food, I have a basis of all the foods that came out and was excited by the familiarity yet creative nature in the food. But all of the dishes were just slightly lacking in refinement. The drinks were (probably purposely) watered down, a bit underwhelmed overall - and the choice of a Sapporo served in a can is underwhelming. The garlic green beans, I wished could be just slightly more al dente to bring back the spring and crunchiness of the bean - and would be great to reduce the sweetness of the dish so to bring back the garlic. The jook was a bit weird too. Most jook is cooked in broth, at least the Chinese variety, and this was cooked in water served with a runny egg and crispy bacon. The flavors didn't come well together. The Korean noodles was severely lacking in noodles, although the beef was tender. The salt and pepper shrimp was tastleless unless you dipped it in the mayo, wishing for larger shrimp, less batter. The wontons my friend loved, but lacked variety in the batter, fell apart before the dish even came, and was too big of a bite. The chicken taco was certainly a remake on the Beijing duck, served on a skin similar to an onion pancake - which was creative but lacking in the hoisin sauce to bring it home for me. \n\nAn A+ experience and great service overall but the food and drink can definitely be better. I see this restaurant as a good place to get millennials unfamiliar with Asian food introduced to the various Asian cuisines but certainly not enough for those raised on this stuff.", "author": "Tinaa W."}

Cool and hip place though its really small and a little crowded. It plays music from the background a little bit blasted that people tend to talk louder than usual. It feels like you are in an afternoon-disco/club. So this is not your place to be if you want something more downcast atmosphere. This is basically more of millenial's hub since it is $45 per person for an unlimited drinks and food. Mimosas, sakes and other drinks are bottomless. They give you these little rubber duckies for every drink you order so you can also track your drinks. Isn't that fun!?! You can keep them as souvenirs if you want. So now you know what I mean, right?...;+)...Food are great and fantastic since I love plate-sharing as well and you get to taste so many of their \"tapa style\" servings. \nWhen you get there, you better have a game plan since there is a 90-minute time limit. Check their menu ahead of time and as soon as you get your seat, be ready to order however you can. Though they come in smaller portions, beware though, cause once they start pouring in, you can get overwhelmed easily lol! We ordered pretty much everything and everything is so good, so you will have no regrets whatever you will be ordering. I love it here. I think it's fun.

If you do not have a preference they will bring you whatever is ready which works well for timing.

We were seated and ordered our food, and literally waited an entire hour to get our main courses. Every other table around us arrived later than us and got their food before us. The restaurant also seemed to be prioritizing takeout orders over our in-person restaurant orders. We were assured multiple times that our orders would be out quickly but the only thing we got was more time spent waiting. Additionally, the music in the restaurant seemed to get louder over the course of the night. \n\nThe food was pretty okay in general. The portions are SO small and expensive (which is expected for SF food in the Marina), but still, $7 for a taco?! It was a good taco, but definitely not worth that price tag. The garlic noodles were pretty basic and I finished my portion within 5 minutes of getting it. My friends ordered the pad thai and chow mein, and reported that they were fine but nothing to call home about. We also ordered the poke which was just not good and a pretty poor value for the price. \n\nGood thing for us, the waitress apologized for the wait and offered to take some things off our bill, because I would have not paid that much for a sub-par experience and okay food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-28", "description": "Not long ago, a startup called Leap offered blinged-out $6 shuttles from the Marina to FiDi, complete with a snack bar serving yogurt, energy bars, $7 fresh-pressed juices, and Blue Bottle iced coffee. Among other things, Leap claimed that there was an underserved market for transit in the Marina. Never mind the fact that it's already served by the MUNI 30, 30X, 41, and 45 lines which all run through Chinatown. Notably, Leap riders interviewed by the press often expressed an aversion to MUNI buses, saying that they couldn't deal with all the crowds. Translation: that trip through Chinatown was beneath them, and they just couldn't bother to mingle with folks of ethnic ilk.\n\nA similar dynamic is at play with Chubby Noodle, even if the setting is less blingy and more douchey - complete with a logo that - dude! - is a blatant Asian caricature. In a city whose population is one-third Asian, there are plenty of places for authentic, down-home Asian fare. For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would prefer the bland and often sad offerings here over the real thing - unless you just don't want to burst your neighborhood bubble on a weekend morning and prefer a deafening, brotastic atmosphere with some cultural appropriation served on the side. \n\nPerhaps the best thing about the brunch experience is that it's AYCE, including some fairly weak drinks. To start, a bowl of breakfast jook tried to gussy up a Chinese staple with a dash of toppings like smoked bacon, but the actual congee itself was utterly bland and watery. While Chinese folks do indeed use whatever toppings they want, the underlying congee should hold its own without them - in the same vein that, say, oatmeal should. Then again, how many patrons here have actually gone to Chinatown, the Richmond, or the Sunset for a proper bowl of congee? Cue the sound of crickets.\n\nVeggies like the Szechuan green beans and the bok choy with mushrooms were more acceptable, although these are items that are hard to screw up. Of course, the fact that they're listed as \"wok tossed\" on the menu (itself quite a piece of work) must really impress folks who have never touched a wok before. Sure must conjure up exotic images of, say, Bruce Lee going all kung fu fighting. Meanwhile, the pork wontons and pork buns were passable, although I've had similar results from frozen fare. Similarly, the chubby chicken chow mein must be a good enough mess if you're simply not used to eating at real Chinese restaurants that prepare pan-fried noodles to crispy perfection.\n\nLook, I get it. For many people, heading into Chinese or Asian neighborhoods means straying too far from their comfort zones. If a fundamental lack of understanding of the cuisine doesn't already impede optimum menu choices from the get-go, brusque service and language barriers at many hole-in-the-wall Asian joints don't help either. So it's far less of an assault on the untrained psyche to sanitize, if not bastardize, the cuisine for non-Asian tastes and eliminate Asians from customer-facing positions - and the entire staff altogether.\n\nAdd in an utterly boorish, obnoxious crowd and some deafening overhead music - \"what better way to eat noodles than with R. Kelly singing in the background?\" as the web site suggests - and you've got a douchetastic venue perfectly suited to the neighborhood. And you don't even have to expose yourself to those folks on the 30-Stockton? Now that's hashtag winning, bro! \n\nIn the end, maybe it's a good thing that there are places like this to soak up the kind of folks who would gravitate to them anyway. Leave good places elsewhere in the city for folks who can truly appreciate, understand, and enjoy them. But beware - many of the fawning reviews here look like paid reviews.", "author": "Vincent L."}

All of us were so happily stuffed at the end of this. Also shout out to the bomb drink man who kept the cantelope mimosas going. \n\nFood // \n-Hot & Sour Soup = probably my favorite thing on the menu. \n-Pickled things = the cucumbers weren't too flavorful but it had a refreshing crunch. \n-pork buns = delicious, the bread is soo good\n-salt and pepper shrimp= extremely flavorful \n-chubby chicken chow mein = basic chow mein \n-- we definitely had some other dishes come our way thats not on our list, because there was just so much food! \n\nOverall // The brunch price is perfect if you are going for the bottomless drinks. I don't really drink so I probably wouldn't pay 40 bucks for their brunch since the food is on the heavier side. I definitely recommend this as a place to have a good time with friends, but not so much for a romantic date, since the music is pretty loud. Can't really hear people talk.", "author": "Emily T."}

Servers were polite and the space was nice though I wasn't a fan of the small tables in the back where we were seated. My bigger issue was the music which in terms of selection was great but in terms of volume was absolutely deafening. My friend and I felt like we were shouting across our tiny 2 foot table.\n\nFor our meal we got the tuna poke, the korean pork tacos, and the spicy garlic noodles.\n\n-Tuna Poke: One of the worst tuna pokes I've ever had but I see raw fish and I want it. The quality of the tuna was pretty bad. Really mushy with little to no flavor. Or maybe that's just because it was soaked half a bottle of soy sauce so I couldn't taste anything else besides salt. Either way, definitely skip this (1/5)\n\n-Korean Pork Tacos: The only good item of the day but was overpriced at $6 per taco. The meat was a bit salty though the flavors were good. The best part was definitely the tortilla. Everything was balanced and delicious but also something you can easily make at home for a fraction of the price (with the exception of the tortilla).\n\n-Spicy Garlic Noodles: I love garlic noodles so damn much. I want garlic infused into every last bite of it so I can die and go to garlic heaven. This got me to garlic purgatory. It's nowhere near garlic-y enough. The flavors weren't bad otherwise though I found the noodles to be a bit overcooked. Price is alright for the portion.\n\nOverall, I left extremely disappointed. Definitely will pass on the dinner menu in the future. Though I am still slightly tempted by their brunch menu...", "author": "Vivian C."}

Our order arrived via Caviar on Friday, June 16th a little before 12 noon.\n\nI ended up with an order of Spicy Garlic Noodles: House made egg noodles, garlic, jalapeno ($11). I've had them before from the North Beach location, so I knew I adored these noodles. Chewy, garlicky, and delicious! Plus, it was a hefty portion. The only thing that left me wanting was the lack of spiciness. I remember the noodles having sliced jalapenos and more of a kick. These were rather mild and I didn't see much jalapeno. I couldn't finish the order, so I gave the rest to a coworker. I think I was able to eat a good third of the box. They were that good. Plus, I had already had a bunch of food from anther spot a little earlier.\n\nGood place for garlic noodles. If you want some kick though, I'd note extra spicy with your order.

I ended up in this place with loud popping hiphop music with a yuppy crowd. I was even treated to a scene of grinding and gyrating. Forget about the food! The party is here! Well, i was still hungry so I ended up getting the Curry Lemongrass Vermicelli. The server was very sweet and helpful. Her name was Katia. I told her I was looking for something with noodles and meat/protein but also with lots of veggies.  She cheerfully told me she would ask the chefs. I love people who say it is possible...She came back with a list of different veggies red bell pepper spinach scallion bean sprouts mint and basil to add to my noodle dish. It was delish! I approved!  The roasted chicken was well marinated and perfectly tender. The dish was just lightly flavored with coconut that lent a little richness to the dish. Overall it was a really balanced dish that had a little chilly pepper heat. I really liked sitting at the high table, looking over to the kitchen at the busy all Latino cooks. By the end of my meal I dot know what is louder, the music, the clanking of dishes being cleaned up, or the ringing in my ears.

The people are very nice, but kind of aloof (which I don't mind). The ambiance is nice, but the seats are fairly small and parties of more than 6 are really not doable. \n\nI like the concept of their pricing a lot. $39 for an all you can eat/drink brunch with a fair amount of options. Our hostess suggested a tasting of everything, and we couldn't resist. There was a ton of food, and we all ate until they had to roll us out. You have a total of 1.5 hours to eat/drink all you can, but that's plenty of time. \n\nI have to say for an AYCE type of place, I really thought the food flavors were on point for the most part. There were a few misses, but definitely more hits. For me some of the hits were the green beans, the chicken wraps and the dumplings. The fried rice and the veggie platter (bok choi and mushrooms) were the most disappointing. \n\nOne thing I would have liked to see was better drinks. It tastes like they're not using the best champagne for their drinks... which I guess is to be expected, but the flavors really didn't do it for me for the drinks. \n\nNow, I also have to disclose that whoever was preparing the drinks while I was there was kinda dropping the ball. The first round of drinks we got were mimosas. I was drinking mine when a friend noticed some pulp in my glass... I thought it was OJ, but then pulled out a wad of paper from the bottom of my cup :x (another friend found one in hers as well). The waitress apologized and brought us a round of sake shots to make up for it, which was super cool. We all got a second round of drinks, and I opted for the sangria that time. When it arrived it had a little rubber ducky in it (all the drinks do) and the rubber ducky had a dead fly on it. The waitress apologized again, but I gotta say it kinda put me off of the drinks. \n\nOverall the deal you get here is great, and the food is mostly delicious, but the preparation of the drinks really had me questioning the cleanliness of what was happening behind the curtains. I'd still recommend this place for a good brunch spot, but some improvements could be made. \n\nStay Cheerful ;)", "author": "Garen A."}

I never imagined eating dimsum/using chopsticks with Bodak Yellow playing the background but it happened. haha. \n\nIt's around $40 for bottomless mimosas + food. Basically they come around with 1 of each dish on their menu so it's easy to try a little of everything. Things are served family style so be sure to eat & drink a lot to make your money worth. \n\nMy fave dishes were definitely the baos. The pork buns and peking duck were so tasty! They pair the baos with plenty of meat so it pairs well to soak up all the alcohol you're drinking. \n\nWe also tried the \n\n+ Salt & Pepper Shrimp - Not too salty and it pairs well with the sauce they give you.\n\n+ Shrimp Fried Rice - My least favorite. The flavors were lacking and it tasted like the rice was just made vs day old.\n\n+ Chow Mein - I like that they had the regular noodles with crunchy noodles as well. It was tasty and not too oily.\n\n+ Breakfast Porridge - Yum! They don't really give that many spoons so be sure to ask for extra ones. I like the addition of bacon and it's a great feel good option especially when you're drinking. \n\n+ Green Beans - I enjoyed this dish! They were sauteed in a nice sauce that wasn't too overpowering that made the beans feel overcooked. \n\n+ Bok Choy & Mushrooms - nothing too special but it was a nice contrast to all the savory flavors.\n\n+ Fried Chicken - not the best in my opinion. There was definitely a small amount of meat for what it was.\n\nThe drinks here are meh. The sangria tasted watered down and more like punch. I would definitely recommend the cantaloupe over the sangria. \n\nService is pretty attentive to coming around often to fill up your cups w/ their little ducks, but they are strict on time so be sure to listen to how much time you have left. The place is loud so I found myself having to raise my voice to chat with the people around me. It's also a small place so it does get warm.

I'll break it down: \n\nFOOD: \nI really enjoyed the food. Obviously not authentic Chinese food, but who on earth would come to Chubby Noodle expecting it to be \"authentic\" anyways? Doesn't matter. What matters is that it tasted delicious. They started just bringing dishes out without us having to order anything, which I really liked because it gave us a taste of everything on their menu. Only downside is a lot of my friends don't eat pork and many of the dishes here had pork. If I came again, I would specify which dishes to bring out so that nothing goes to waste. I LOVED the buns, the shrimp fried rice, and the Chubby Noodles. I also loved that we could order as much as we wanted of anything. \n\nDRINKS:\nPrepare yourselves because I have a lot of horrible things to say about the drinks here. I have been to a lot of bottomless mimsoa places, and I don't think I've ever been so blatantly jipped by a restaurant when it comes to drinks than we were here. The strawberry mimosas were SO SO SO watered down. They tasted like maybe they made the mimosas yesterday, let it sit in a shit ton of melting ice, and then decided to serve it to us the next day. It didn't even taste like there was champagne in there, just watered down strawberry juice. Since we only had 90 mins, we ended up drinking at least 7-10 of these each because they weren't really doing the trick. My friend ordered the sangria, which just tasted like a bad vodka cranberry. You could really taste the vodka in there which I found strange because.... it's Sangria. Finally, when the waiter came around to re-fill our drinks, we had 10 minutes left of eating/drinking time. I know this because I was keeping track very carefully. When he poured our drinks, he said \"this is last call for the drinks\". I'm sorry, we still had 10 minutes left and we are paying customers, who are you to tell me that this is going to be my last glass? Again, I've never been to a bottomless mimosa place where they enforced the time limit so much that they cut you off before the 90-minute mark. And no we were not being rowdy/overly drunk, they were just being cheap. \n\nAnyways, definitely an experience, definitely recommend checking it out but definitely not my favorite brunch place.", "author": "Zoe B."}

The amount of times I've been to Chubby Noodle Brunch is probably 20+ in my two years in San Francisco, and it simply never gets old. $40 per person for bottomless mimosas or sangria + food--this is an SF deal you simply can't beat. \n\nSecond to the food is the atmosphere!

You can request your desired level of spice, and either way they're always delicious. \n\n4) Green beans--I don't even like green beans that much but YUMMM do they put a delicious teriyaki sauce on them. A must-get in my opinion!

The pork was red, sweet and tender, the way it is supposed to be.  The rib appetizer fell off the bone the right way and had great seasoning.  The garlic noodles with the fried chicken added to it had the right blend of spice and crunch.

It's a little pricey for me, but I guess near the average amount one would spend in the city (came out to be about $53 a person). \n\nWe did the bottomless mimosas and dim sum on a Saturday morning. I made reservations for 10 am because my party was of 8 people. I highly recommend making reservations because they get very busy, very fast. Even though I got there at exactly 10 it was already getting pretty crowded. \n\nThey have two servers going around, one for food and one for drinks. \n\nThe food server was great. Since our party was so large, he asked if he could order the dishes for us and asked if there was anything in particular we wanted. I think the portions were a good size. Each plate wasn't an over-abundance of food, and one dish had enough for everyone to try. The food was very Americanized for being dim sum but we went in knowing that. With that being said, everything was decent in taste. My favorite dish was the garlic green beans. Most of the plates were also a little spicy. Personally I cannot handle spicy, but my party enjoyed it. \n\nMy only complaint is regarding the refill of the drinks. We went there with high hopes of stacking up the rubber duckies that our drinks came with, but they were not given with our drink refills. The drink server kept saying he would come back with them but he didn't. It also took a little while for our drinks to be refilled. They were pretty busy so we tried to be understanding of the situation. \n\nI would probably still go back because it was filling and their pineapple mimosa was pretty good.", "author": "Melissa C."}

The plates can run small, but you can reorder anything you liked. \n\nFood highlights: garlic and pepper shrimp (you're gonna want to order the sauce by the gallon), green beans, noodles.\nFood to skip: Soup courses. The only liquids you should be consuming here are the bottomless mimosas/tea drinks.\n\nAtmosphere: awesome loud pregame-y 90s/early 2000's music, but very crowded and hot inside.

The shrimp was bursting with juiciness and flavor, but the outside fried batter provided a good crispy texture. The shrimp was served with a light peanut sauce which was delightful. \nIf I had to give constructive criticism, I'd say the music was a bit too loud for my liking.

I don't even think I have a super picky palate or anything but I just felt really deceived from the reviews. \n\nI went here for their weekend AYCE brunch on a Sunday with my boyfriend. We were really excited since this place seemed really cool. Who wouldn't get excited for AYCE/AYCD? It's AYCE dim sum in the sense that all the dishes come in small portions, and the drink selection included Sapporo beer, watermelon mimosas, sangria, and cold tea. It seems like a cool little hip place, and it seems cool to bring a bunch of your friends here to have a good time.\n\nFirst off, I loved the idea of having unlimited drinks, and it made the price of $39/person slightly more agreeable. I got the mimosa and the combo with watermelon was gross. Sangria also wasn't great. They had plain watermelon juice if you wanted, but since it was the same (not fresh) watermelon juice used in the mimosa, NO THANK YOU. Just get the canned Sapporo if you were to come here (I hope you don't). \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small. They play such a unique selection of music which you wouldn't hear at other lunch spots which I liked. However, it was just way too loud- I couldn't have a proper conversation since it was so difficult to talk over the music.\n\nAll the food on the menu (14 items) were foods I was interested in, but after trying almost all the items, all of them were honestly pretty bad. None of them were spectacular. They had a decent selection and all the food came out pretty fast, but all of the food was just that- subpar. \n-Roast duck buns: wasn't moist at all and the skin in most parts were hard to bite\n-Pork won tons: the skin was super thick and the inside just tasted like gross meatballs\n-Breakfast jook: I took a couple of sips but it was way too salty!!! It isn't even hard to make jook since it's a simple dish with simple ingredients.... \n\nThe food that I would say was okay would just be the salt and pepper shrimp, chow mein, and shrimp fried rice. On the real though.... how would you mess these up, these are pretty standard dishes. \n\nAgain, I've never been a super critical person when it comes to food. However, it just angered my boyfriend and I with how popular this spot is. The total came out to be around $106 for the two of us. I also didn't like how they automatically charged us for 20% tip for our small party. I would much rather go to a nice dim sum place (or even anywhere else) and get a decent amount of quality food for this price or even less! \n\nRestaurant had a good concept, but everything was not executed well.", "author": "Sydney E."}

I also have an egg allergy so I could not eat the dishes with egg noodles (which is large amount of menu) and they would not sub for a different noodle (even tho they have rice noodle and sweet potato on menu). I thought that was odd.\n\nThe food was kinda greasy and mostly fried.. it was still decent but it is just bar food, and for that it is far too expensive. I came here with a friend and we had a lot to catch up on, but this is definitely a place where they want to rush you out. I get that they are busy, but I felt pretty rushed through my meal. For dinner I'd pass coming here, and in general I'm kind of a slow eater so I don't know if I'd want to try out the ever-popular brunch menu either.", "author": "Mariam P."}

The music was very loud, and while the food was flavorful, our noodles were a bit overcooked. The tacos were pretty decent, but Kogi does this better and is much cheaper. \n\nI have to say it's not quite what I was expecting given the prices. I get it, San Francisco is an expensive city - and this is one of the more expensive neighborhoods there. But in a way that makes it worse - a room full of well-heeled white people listening to loud (uncensored) hip-hop while eating slightly above-average Asian fusion is not really my idea of a great time. \n\nI'd be willing to try the place again if I am in the area though.", "author": "Michael G."}

Great food, great service, and an amazing vibe. \n\nThe food is all served family style. I usually go with a big group of people, so what the waiter does is plan out the menu for us. We can put in requests if we want more of something but otherwise the food keeps coming out every few minutes and you get to sample a little bit of everything. \n\nThe drinks are bottomless and I would definitely recommend the cold tea. It is a wine cocktail that's really light (not on the alcohol) and isn't too sweet. They have a different special mimosa every week. \n\nA few things you HAVE to try if you're here: salt and pepper shrimp, green beans, breakfast juk, and Peking duck. \n\nIt's on the pricey side (it's exactly $53.22 a person w/ tax and gratuity included) but both the food and drinks are bottomless so it's well worth it.", "author": "Nick D."}

It's a great concept with a limited menu and plenty of flavorful options. Really though, the flavors coming out of the kitchen are really good! My suggestion... avoid the health warning pop up when looking into this place because it's worth the \"risk\".\n\nIn my most recent visit (I've been numerous times), I had the following: \n\n- Pad Thai - solid. not my favorite of the bunch but, nice to have a noodle on board. I think the garlic noodles are a superior order.\n- Papaya Salad - also a bit underwhelming but, it was nice to have some freshness in the meal. \n- Pork Tacos - I mean, these are probably the best thing on the menu. Without a doubt. \n- Spicy Wings - A very close second and a must order for anyone that's a fan of wings. \n\nAmongst all of this, my friend and I misheard the server and ordered 1L of house sake which was more than sufficient for the two of us. Seriously, it's a lot of sake for two. We didn't finish it (thank god) and gave it to our friendly neighbors :)\n\nOur server that evening was more than attentive but, not overwhelming.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-05", "description": "While in town, I stopped in at Chubby Noodle for Sunday brunch-bottomless food and drinks for 90 mins. It was fun to eat on Lombard in the Marina district (not to be confused with their other location) with some girlfriends I was excited to catch up with. However the extremely loud music was a huge turn off, and I would not recommend eating here if you want a nice catch up session with your party- you'll be frustrated to not hear what they are saying, and leave with a horse voice from all the yelling. I appreciate that C.N. wants to make it a fun atmosphere, but turning the music down a few decibels would probably benefit all without ruining the \"cool\" vibe. \n\nA few tips for brunch- Your time starts when the reservations starts, and they wont seat you without your party so make sure slow Susie knows to hurry her butt up and not be late as she usually is- she'll waste some of your precious eating and drinking time. The drinks flow at a normal pace that the servers check on you, so that means ~4, unless you are aggressively flagging down the waitress. Their website and menu states they have the right to \"slow your roll\" on eating and drinking, so there's that as well!\n\nFoodwise, I actually enjoyed most of the selections they brought out. They pretty much just pick what your table is going to get, and it is all served family style. The small tables are not the greatest to have a lot of plates with a larger party- there is simply not enough room. Be prepared to shovel food onto your small plate (and mouths) and try to get rid of the serving dish. Standout dishes to me were the green beans, fried chow mein, fried shrimp, and the peking duck with bun. For the 9 of us, we probably tried 10+ dishes...the food just kept coming. We had so much food we didn't end up re-ordering anything! \n\nThe 90 mins passed in a flash and then we were kicked to the curb, tipsy and overly full. I think with proper expectations (not trying to meet with friends you haven't seen in years and yell over the music) Chubby Noodle is making fantastic food and I like the idea of AYCE drinks and food when the food is actually quality and not some buffet line of stale Chinese.

I'm adding a note to my restaurant reviews about serving food.  Many restaurants don't train their staff not to cup or grip plates and bowls with their fingers..which results in the server's fingers being less than an inch proximity to your food, or in your food.  Try not to think about when they used the bathroom and if washed their hands or not.  There is a way to serve without gripping fingers over the edge of a bowl.", "author": "Wendy W."}

It can probably have a softer touch to it.  Music had some profanity, not sure if that is family friendly, but hey! It does cater to the \"younger\" crowd.

I didn't even get to try the food, though it doesn't look very special.\n\nChubby Noodle needs to be better at managing expectations with walk-in reservations. We went on a Sunday at around noon to see if we could get a seat. I understand that the weekend is difficult because of the brunch rush (most of the restaurant is reserved for large groups), but if you know you can't seat us, JUST TELL US AND WE WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. When we arrived, they told us they could probably seat us in 45 minutes and would call us around then. We walked around Lombard Street for an hour without hearing back and called to inquire about getting a table. They said they could probably accommodate us in around 30 more minutes. \n\nAfter 30 more minutes, we walked back. They told us 20 more minutes - just wait 20 more minutes. After 20 more minutes, they said to wait for their 2:00 PM seating even though they couldn't guarantee a seat, and you know what, actually, it was unlikely we would get a seat, sorry. But they did recommend for a tequila brunch bar down the street and to tell the restaurant we sent them! The host could not care less and gave me a warm smile as we walked out. At 2:30 PM, almost 2.5 hours after we had arrived, we decided to go to the Dorian instead (which was great, for the record).\n\nChubby Noodle isn't worth any of your time or money.

I complied but told him there was no reason for this, since I had order a beer while sitting at the bar; what if I just wanted to go there for drinks? He offered a reply that was  both condescending and patronizing. If a customer politely tells you they feel wronged by your attitude, the first thing you do is apologize, not tell them they're wrong.\n\nWhen I told the hostess about it, she just awkwardly stared back at me and said that there was nothing she could do. Before I left with the food I asked the hostess if there was a manager I could speak to. She said that there was a manager, but he was very busy. If a patron asks to speak to the manager, and there's one on staff at the moment, the only acceptable reply is \"yes, right away\".\n\nIn terms of food, the Spicy Noodles with Char Siu pork are quite good.

To be fair, $39 for bottomless mimosas and all you can eat dim sum is really not bad. If you are coming for the experience and want to get drunk and have a good time with the food as a side, then I'd say this place is for you. However, if you're like me and place a high emphasis on the food, you may be disappointed.\n\nStarting with the drinks; they had a few options, I tried the sangria and mimosa, both were pretty good. I thought it was really cute how they added a tiny rubber ducky to each of the drinks! Each table has two servers, a drink server and a food server. Our drink server was very on top of keeping our glasses filled.\n\nNow onto the food: mediocre at best. We tried every single item on the AYCE brunch menu, and the only dish I was really impressed with was the Szechuan string beans and pork buns. The rest of the dishes were honestly like a level or two above Panda Express. Also, it just really bothered me that they tried to pass off roasted duck with buns as Peking duck and didn't bother to remove the bones before serving the meat to us. \n\nAlso, the music was WAY too loud. They blast tunes here like it's a club or something. You know it's a problem when your server has to ask repeatedly what you are saying. My friends and I basically yelled at each other throughout the entire meal and just decided to kind of give up talking altogether because it was just so much effort. I honestly think it kind of ruined my dining experience, and when I asked the server if they could turn it down a little, they said the best they could do was lower it by a notch. I thought that perhaps it was because my group was seated kind of close to the speaker, but while in line for the bathroom, I spoke to other parties who also agreed that it was way too loud to be enjoyable.

There was an assortment of 4 drink choices, which were pretty tasty, and the servers were great with the refills. I'm happy that I tried this place out once for the experience, but I probably wouldn't come back.", "author": "Cynthia M."}

Tam, on our way back into the city due to construction changes, we wanted to grab dinner in the Marina. Saw the good reviews for Chubby Noodle and got a thumbs up from another member of our party. \n\nWe got there around 6 on Sunday and it had a crowd but there was no wait. Got seated right by the door, and our server/manager was fantastic. Friendly, polite, willing to explain the family-style ordering, and willing to answer any questions. I had some about the on tap sake and the Yona Yona Beer, and while he didn't know he asked the bartender and provided the answer. \n\nWe ended up getting a few items for the table. We were hungry, but not ravenous from the hike, so we got in order of delivery:\n\nPork and Shrimp Wontons: probably the weakest of the items, but not bad by any means. The  spicy soy sauce seeps in and gives it a wonderful kick that we all noticed. 8 pieces per bowl gave us each two, so enough to enjoy.\n\nPapaya Salad: this was really good, really light, and really refreshing. Yummy papaya, bean sprouts, mint, basil in a light vinegar dressing. Everyone got a huge amount.\n\nKimchee: this was definitely my suggestion, and I did end up killing it as it was great. Some of the Korean spots in San Jose make a pretty tame kimchee. This had a great little kick that wasn't overpowering. \n\nSpicy Garlic Noodles: not as spicy as I expected, but perfectly tender and did have some good flavor. Unfortunately I didn't know you could get char siu pork added to it, but it was great on it's own for the carb.\n\nTuna Poke: a nice-sized portion of cubed tuna that comes with those Chinese Shrimp Chips, so you can make your own little tuna poke nachos. Fantastic flavor on these, I think we were all being polite just not stealing the whole plate.\n\nDuck Tacos: generally when you see something like \"available until sold out\" you know it is going to be good. It exceeded expectations. By far the best item we tried, and we all mumbling suggested getting another order despite being full. Only one tortilla, so not purely authentic, but the duck is delicious and the bit of yogurt really does add to the flavor.\n\nAfter the meal but before the bill, I talked with our server/manager and one of the bartenders - as the garlic noodles were delicious, I asked if they ever did dandan noodles. Neither had heard of the dish, but they did start to scramble to find their own dinner for the night. But they did tell me about SO and PPQ doing so.\n\nI loved everything here, but I realize that timing was a big factor (the neighborhood was practically empty) and that not all patrons would experience this. But I definitely recommend it.", "author": "Michael C."}

I'm not really the type to get too turned off but something like this (especially for a restaurant that's pretty highly rated), so I decided to give it a shot anyways.\n\nA friend and I went to their endless dim sum brunch on a Sunday pretty close to opening, and there were already quite a few people seated. Be warned that the space is very small and I don't think they take brunch reservations, so coming early is definitely recommended. Also, beware that even with the size they still allow larger groups inside, which in our case was a bit annoying because there was a group of at least 10 that didn't have enough seats, so a lot of them were standing in the way of everything.\n\nThe endless brunch includes unlimited pick of 15 or so items, along with 4 glasses of one of their brunch cocktails. Although there's a drink max, they're actually pretty strong after you have a couple, so it wasn't as disappointing that there wasn't a bottomless option. We also had a great waitress who kept bringing us sake shots so that didn't hurt either!\n\nIt's definitely hard to not go over board when ordering since it's unlimited, and I definitely went a little crazy. I started off with the breakfast jook, a breakfast porridge with egg and bacon that was delicious and soothing. I also ordered the pork and shrimp dumpling, duck steam buns (which are huge and filling and I definitely recommend sharing!), kung pao wings (not my favorite from the menu), chow mein, and green beans. \n\nEverything overall was amazing, I just wish I had paced myself a little more, because believe me you'll get full fast. I will say with the size and the amount of people that were there that day, and the fact that there was only one waitress, the service was kind of slow. And I did notice that tables that were seated after us got some of the same dishes we ordered before we did, but again our waitress was really nice so it didn't really effect our overall experience.\n\nI highly recommend coming here if you're looking for a fresh take on a dim sum brunch. If you're worried about the health warning, just know I didn't get sick after eating here and I didn't see anything weird in the food, so don't let it stop you from trying it out!", "author": "Jaymie S."}

Chubby Noodle was down the street from my hotel.  It was close to closing time and I asked the server what he recommended. He said the Chubby Noodle is known for their pork tacos and their BBQ beef rice.  So I ordered it and when my tacos arrived,  my first thought was \"I am going to order more, because this is not enough\"  there were two of us and not sure if we would have enough good for both of us.\nNot only were the tacos delicious,  they are loaded with pork. One taco was more than enough for me.  We also had the BBQ beef fried rice and that too was delicious and it was a generous serving.\nWe were very hungry as we traveled all day and worked for a few hours as soon as we got it the city. \nThe music was bumpin' - rap.

It was greatly appreciated by me and I want everyone to know that these guys give great service on top of already great and tasty food.\n\nThe Food:\nI had the garlic noodles with prawns... holy geez that was super tasty, you got the garlic and the nice texture from the egg noodles mixed with the slightly sweet meat from the shrimp, finished off with just the right amount of heat from the jalape\u00f1os (not too hot but very tasty)\n\nI also had the Korean Pork Tacos.  I was getting full by this point but I managed to make more room for these tasty delectables.  The pork has a nice char / crispy outside yet was juicy and melted in my mouth.  The nice creamy sauce and sweet cucumbers added depth to the already maxing pork, not to be overshadowed by the crisp yet maliable home made tortilla which brought the flavors all together.\n\nAll of this was washed down with their smooth, ice cold house sake.\n\nThis was a fantastic meal by a fantastic staff in a fantastic location.

Sometimes they are mediocrely cool and way overpriced and you feel like you're paying solely for Instagram popularity. Chubby Noodle was unfortunately the latter -_- \n\nDespite the name, there is nothing chubby about their noodles; on the contrary, the portions are TINY! We paid ~$15 per person and ate burgers at Super Duper afterwards. \n\nThe server recommended Korean pork tacos and spicy garlic noodles. The tacos are essentially the only thing unique enough to be worth getting, in my opinion, but taking into account the $$$ I'm not sure I would recommend. Everything else is overpriced mediocre Asian food plated in hipster fashion (e.g. + runny fried egg).\n\nTUNA POKE ($13) sesame, soy, sambal, macadamia | Not bad and I liked the kick of spice sauteed into the edamame However the fish was a little too mushy, and the portion size was wayyyy tiny... so tiny I felt like it impaired my ability to accurately assess it.\n\nKOREAN PORK TACO ($11 for 2) house made flour tortilla, chili yogurt, cucumber | Fusion masterpiece! The tortilla is very similar to that delicious savory wrap they use for TW beef/green onion pancake. The Korean BBQ pork was on point with the fatteningly delicious chili sesame oil marinade, and the addition of the cucumber and yogurt made it a bit reminiscent of time-tested Greek kebab wraps. Perfect in every respect until you realize it's a $5 taco -_-\n\nBBQ PORK FRIED RICE ($10+$2) Chinese pork, egg, scallions / add fried egg | We expected a creative spin but it was really just your typical BBQ fried rice that you could get for half the price at any decent Chinese restaurant. (Plus runny fried egg for the Instagram)\n\nCHICKEN CHOW MEIN ($11) house made noodles, vegetables | Nothing special. It's regular chow mein with a topping of chubby rice noodles for the Chubby Noodle namesake, but I feel like it doesn't actually go well with the chow mein. Fried rice noodles are not used this way in Chinese cooking... noodles as a topping for noodles hardly makes sense, aiyah!\n\nKUNG PAO WINGS ($10) arbol chilies, garlic, ginger | A little zingier than your average kung pao, but nothing mind-blowing (especially if you've had the famous San Tung wings)\n\nSPICY GARLIC NOODLES ($10) house made egg noodles, garlic, jalapeno | Definitely not the best garlic noodles I've had, but likely the smallest portion I've had -_-\n\nThe verdict: I would give Chubby Noodle a try if you are super into Asian fusion, have excessive dispensable income, or go die-hard on finding the best possible Instagrams. A la carte is expensive, so I would suggest trying the weekend bottomless brunch--ACYE might actually make you chubby :3", "author": "Edna C."}

They let me know that the charge for no-show-no-call would be $25/person, so I made sure everyone in my party would show. They also called me roughly two hours beforehand to confirm. If you have a bigger group, I highly recommend making a reservation. But, be careful, because they are quite strict about their policies...\n\nThis is another one of those places that won't seat you until you entire party is seated. I get that, but it just stinks that we can't sit first (read: spend more money on drinks and appetizers) while we wait for the rest of our party. Only when we literally told them that the last person was looking for parking (again, we went on Saturday night) and had the text messages to prove it, did they agree to seat the five of us. That just kind of bugs me in general about the more chill places like this one. For a very high-end, dress-code place, I understand. But it seemed to be a little overkill here because they were such sticklers about it.\n\nWe ordered the Chubby Noodle sake, which we were told was the \"signature.\" It was nice and mild, so it paired well with the flavorful food. Food-wise, we got the Lettuce Wraps, Korean Pork Tacos, Garlic Noodles with BBQ Pork, and Chow Mein. Personally, I thought the Lettuce Wraps were just okay. I liked that they gave you the carrots, cucumber, and radish on the side, but I thought this was a little too greasy. Same thing with the Korean Pork Tacos, but those were better in terms of flavor. The Garlic Noodles were delicious~ but a little too spicy for my taste. Still, I liked that dish the best. The Chow Mein was also good, especially the texture. So they're definitely noodle masters here!\n\nService, aside from the seating part of the night, was great. They constantly came by to ask us if we needed anything and refilled our drinks.\n\nMy friend noticed that by the time we finished our meal, the table next to us, who had been waiting even before we got there, was just then getting seated. Making a reservation was clutch!\n\nCouple of minor details: music playlist was bomb, but a little too loud. Also, it can get stuffy if you're seated close to the kitchen. Lastly, they have a limit on the number of cards they take, so take that into account if you have a bigger group and want to split.", "author": "Eryn H."}

Not quite sure if it was an actual tortilla or not. But it was pretty good. The fried chicken was boneless and the dipping sauce set off the chicken.

The tea came in a cute mug but I wasn't a huge fan of the tea itself. \n- Shrimp dumplings - Out of all the different types of dumplings we tried, this was my favorite. \n- Peking duck - Fatty and delicious\n- Porridge (Jook) - Great comfort food\n- Salt and Pepper Shrimp - Salty, flavorful and came with a mayo-like dipping sauce.\n- Wings - Sweet and salty\n- Wonton Soup - This was my favorite in the last round of dishes that came out of the kitchen. It was hot and comforting. \n\nI would recommend sharing your meal with at least three people so you can try everything!", "author": "Karen L."}

The food was decent but the service was sub par, which I understand on a busy day. The reason for this review is the aftermath. After getting home I realized that we were over charged by $50 for brunch. I called chubby noodle the day after and was told they would look into it. No call back. I follow up in a week and they said their finance person was on vacation and they promised they would get back to me the same day. Still it's been 2 days and no call back, so I'm writing this review. I find it absurd that I continue to have to follow up and also that it takes a finance person to issue a credit for us being over charged. Wish I could give negative stars. While the food was decent, I won't be going back because in the event something goes wrong it's a full-time job for me to remedy it. Terrible customer service.", "author": "Jordana W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-07", "description": "2.5 STARS\n\nI really struggled with writing this review.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe staff rocked! They were so nice, attentive, and efficient but the food was so not the business. I was a fan of their North Beach location but it seems like they have shifted to more Americanized Pan Asian which IMO is hard to pull off well.\n\nOver the weekend, we went to Chubby Noodle for their $37 Bottomless Dim Sum Brunch with a max of 4 boozy drinks (90 min max). Reservations accepted. I wasn't expecting stellar nor authentic dim sum given the area and because it's AYCE but for the $37 price tag, I at least expected it to be decent. Maybe dinner is a better reflection of the restaurant than their weekend brunch?\n\nOf the 12 items offered on their bottomless weekend dim sum brunch menu, only two were good. The other two were mediocre, and the rest of the dishes were PF Chang and Elephant Bar-ish; commercialized, over-sauced, and super salty. The two guys I went with love salty foods but even they were complaining that it was so salty. And, sadly the dim sum and dumplings were worse than the Asian buffets in the Peninsula like Kome, Moonstar, and Beijing that charge $12-$15 for lunch. \n\nB O O Z Y  D R I N K S (4 max)\nYou get a choice of Cold tea (w/ nigori), Hoang mimosa (w/ Asian pear), or Rose sangria. I tried the Hoang mimosa: http://bit.ly/1xEXcdH which was nice and fruity but watered down from the ice. \n\nS O U P S  &  P O R R I D G E\n*Breakfast Jook (http://bit.ly/1BB4SfW): GET THIS! You can never go wrong  with bacon and an egg with a runny yolk. Jook had a nice, creamy consistency.\n*Hot & Sour Soup (http://bit.ly/1HAv7Ho): Too much white vinegar and not enough heat with an overload of white pepper.\n*Wonton Soup (http://bit.ly/1tDyLYG): Wontons were nice and meaty but lukewarm broth was like sweet pho broth.\n\nN O O D L E S\n*Chilled Ramen (http://bit.ly/1xL8qPw): GET THIS TOO! Like a rendition of bibim naengmyeon (spicy korean cold noodles), it was refreshing and had great textures from the crisp veggies and kimchi. The runny yolk cut through the heat perfectly. \n*Chubby Chicken Chow Mein (http://bit.ly/1Ih4OV0): Nice presentation. Noodles were perfectly al-dente but too much soy so it was really salty. \n*Rice Cake in XO (http://bit.ly/14q6PBK): XO is a really pungent sauce made from fried fish and shrimp so it should be used sparingly. Again, too much sauce so it was really salty but noodle rolls were firm and tender.\n\nD U M P L I N G S\n*Sui [sic] Mai (http://bit.ly/1tK8AVY): Reminds me of the kind you get from TJ's freezer aisle. Wrapper fell apart upon picking up.\n*Shrimp Dumpling (http://bit.ly/14q6kaW): Filling was ok but wrapper was thick and gummy. Wrapper fell apart upon picking up.\n*Shanghai Dumplings (http://bit.ly/1FbsyOd): Mini baozi filled with over-sauced shredded BBQ chicken. Sorry, but this was a fusion fail. \n\nD I M  S U M\n*Peking Duck: This pic says it all:  http://bit.ly/1tK8sWw.  I have a feeling they buy the ducks from a Chinatown and throw them in the deep fryer before serving.\n*Salt & Pepper Shrimp (http://bit.ly/13TIkvJ): Undercooked and tasted like a salt and white pepper lick. \n*Kung Pao Wings (http://bit.ly/1Ih532q): Too salty and wings were not crispy. \n\nAgain, the staff was great. Our young Asian waiter was a sweetheart. It was packed he and the other staff managed to quickly turn around orders and clear empty plates.\n\nThe ambiance is great for people in their young 20s: very \"lively\". For those over that scene, it was way too loud (music was blaring) and rowdy. Dude in the booth in back of us kept elbowing me in the neck. \n\nThe space is good for groups as there were more communal tables and booths than two tops but space is cramped. \n\nFinding street parking can be hard so good luck. \n\nSo who's down to go to Kome and clothesline poh pohs for their XLBs?

I really liked the salt and pepper shrimp, the breakfast jook, and the Peking duck buns. All the dumplings were really good as well but they pretty much ran out after we put our orders in. It's just such a good deal for delicious food and drinks. The mimosa of the day was made with cantaloupe juice which I didn't think I would like but it didn't have an overpowering melon flavor and I ended up with 1837392 refills.

Unfortunately the atmosphere was so abrasive and uncomfortable that I need to drop it down to a 3/5. The music is obnoxiously loud and was just non stop low quality hip-hop. I'm not sure if they think they're a club or something, but they should definitely take note that if you're almost empty at closing time on a Saturday night, you're not pulling off the club/bar vibe.

We actually went to their other location at first, but couldn't even find parking so we decided to try this one instead. When we were seated, we actually started out at the bar. This place is super crowded (we didn't have to wait at all, thank goodness), blasting with top 40's music, and very good vibe. I actually felt like I was at a day club because people were dancing and just having a good time. \n\nWe didn't know that for brunch, they only have an option to pay $37 for 15 dim sum items (two of you means 30 items), and 4 drinks. We were very hesitant and almost didn't want to do that because that's A LOT, but we ended up going for it anyway. When I emphasize A LOT, it's not a joke! We probably got 17 dim sum items out of 30 and I honestly felt like I was pregnant eating so much but no doubt, their quality of food is top notch. The only thing I didn't really like were their dumplings but everything else was sooooo good. We ordered the rice cakes with X.O. sauce but they never brought it out to us. By the end, we were so full we didn't even want it anymore.\n\nOverall, I think this place is so worth it for the price. $37 might sound a little too much when you look at the menu, but honestly, if you think about it and if you can eat a lot, $37 is REALLY good for the price. You get both food and drinks! \n\nSize wise, this place is pretty small so either go really early or later before they close for brunch at 3pm.

But hey, I don't have any other Asian fusion nightclub wanna be restaurants within walking distance of my house, so why not give it a try.\n\nGlad I did! There were two of us, and the waitress kindly explained that everything was family style and that for 2 people she recommended 3-4 dishes. Being the hungry fatties that we were, we went with 4:\n\n1. Chinese chicken salad: this was not my choice, had it not been for my dinner date I never would have ordered it. But so glad be did! It was delicious! The chicken was so fresh and tender, the sauce so perfect, the lettuce so tasty, I sacked every bite! I'd order this again in a heartbeat. \n\n2 spicy garlic noodles: despite the name, these are not, in fact, spicy. But they are full of flavor. So yum! A must for sure!\n\n3. Chile prawn noodles: we were actually debating between this and the spicy garlic noodles when ordering, but when the waitress described them both to us we just had I order both. Glad we did! This dish is the chubby flat rice noodles that grace their sign, and so tasty. Delicious sauce. Amazing prawns. The waitress said it was quite spicy but we didn't think so. Very very good. \n\n4. Last but not least, the flounder. The fish itself was quite good, but the best part was actually the mushrooms and veggies that topped it.

That being said, you probably won't be able to hold a conversation here because the music is so loud. Initially I could have done without it, but then they 'Drunk in Love' twice and we were way too happy (and drunk) about it. \n\nThe deal is all you can eat and all you can drink for $37. There are three cocktails and sapporo to choose from, and you can do sake for $5 (?) extra. We got two (or three? four?) rounds of free sake because it was our server's last day and she just DGAF. Shout out to you, you small, Asian spitfire. I alternated between the mimosa and the sangria--don't ask how many I had because I couldn't tell you. The drinks kept coming, even when they weren't requested, so we kept ordering more food. Overall nothing was too special. The rice cakes with XO sauce were spicy and sweet; a little too sweet for my taste. The best dish was the wontons, which come in a garlicky sauce. We essentially tried everything on the brunch menu and it was the only one that stood out. \n\nAtmosphere is A+ if you're looking to get Sunday funday ratchet.

They have a pretty simple menu, and both locations seem to always be packed. I stopped into the Marina location for a to-go order last night. The music is loud but it's good music so that really shouldn't be a problem? Why are people complaining? You go out to eat, not talk the entire meal LOL.\n\n-The popular Spicy Garlic noodles weren't actually that spicy :/ so don't be fooled. I think a lot of these people leaving high reviews just don't know what spicy is. Nonetheless, the noodles were still good. I was complaining about them costing 10 dollars but of course come to find out I couldn't even finish the whole carton in one sitting LOL so that's good. \n\n-The Chubby Chicken entree is also 10 dollars. That price is actually pretty steep for the amount of chicken you end up getting, but at least the chicken was good paired with the sauce. The pieces had little to no fat which is what I like. And yes they are boneless. I also got the cucumber salad which was just okay. \n\nHowever, it was a big disappointment (and the reason this review is 3 stars instead of 4) to find out at the last minute that there are no forks, only chopsticks. Or maybe there are no to-go forks. Either way it's disappointing and annoying, being how clearly not everyone in America knows how to use chopsticks. So I'm supposed to just up and immediately learn how to use chopsticks in less than 2 mins when I'm starving?? What are we, in Kill Bill vol. 2?  I debated going to one of the hotels nearby and asking for a fork but I thought that would be tacky so, lucky for Chubby Noodle I managed quite well with the chopsticks. \n\nI'll be back, but I guess I'll come prepared with FORKS.

Not exactly for the carb (or waistline) conscious, but it's so worth it! \n\nI came here after a run with my friend and we worked up quite the appetite. We ordered the green papaya salad, the poke, the fried rice and spicy garlic noodles. Everything really hit the spot, especially the noodles. It's a very simple dish, but the combination of the chewy noodles, the spice and slight sweetness just rounds out the dish. \n\nI also tried their tea cooler, which is the house special cocktail and liked it.

The associate left a voice message letting me know that the spot for my party is available and to call back to confirm. I called back immediately, only to be greeted with a voicemail that was too full to accept any more messages. I called them again later that day but the next associate told me he wasn't in charge of reservations and to call back between 10-2pm. I decided to submit another reservation inquiry. I got a call back today letting me know they are fully booked for the Marina location. When I explained my frustration and the situation with the reservation guy, there was no apology for the inconvenience and he chuckled when I asked to put my name down in case they had any cancellation.

We were supposed to be a party of 7 but were instead six; however we were seated at a table that could comfortably seat 4. The cramped seating and music that was 50% beyond too loud made for a very uncomfortable experience. The food was nothing to write home about. The standouts were the szechuan green beans, the chicken wraps, and the chubby chow mein. All the other food (we tried everything on the brunch menu) was mediocre at best. Food service was okay; we had empty plates sit for a while before being swapped out but they were busy so I understand that. What Is incomprehensible is how poor the beverage service was. We were given one waiter for food who was sociable and competent, but our separate waiter for drinks was truly abysmal. He started out on the wrong foot by bringing a whole slew of wrong drinks to our first round, and continued to bring incorrect drinks when asked for drinks beyond the \"mimosa\" and \"sangria\" that were fifty percent melted ice and served from pitchers he would tote around and spill from (side note, don't wear white shoes, my friend who was sitting on the end of the had his feet stepped on repeatedly due to the cramped table, and since the servers didn't care when the plates they were toting were dripping sauce onto the floor, which I saw happen multiple times, his shoes were filthy by the end of the brunch). On the drink front, the cold tea is actually decent and the only thing that tastes like it has actual booze in it. All in all a very disappointing experience when you consider you could have spent the fifty and change dollars this experience will run you on any of the many unlimited brunch options available to you.", "author": "Ethan N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-01", "description": "I've been curious about Chubby Noodle since we arrived in SF. Besides the cute name and extremely close proximity to our hotel, the reviews and pictures of the food appealed to me. We didn't get a chance to try it until our final night in the city but I am so glad we tried it and made it our last meal in SF.  It was delicious and I will come back again on our next trip. \n\nInitially we wanted to eat in the restaurant but the heat from the kitchen and the lateness of the hour didn't agreed with our baby.  The restaurant is long and skinny with a handful of high top tables, a bar, booths, and a handful of low top tables in the very back. We chose a booth so we could sit by the window and let the baby look at traffic. I'm going to get real - folks with a little more girth would do well to consider the tables. The booths are just a little too narrow and squished for my taste but this may be because I had my baby on my lap. Between the two of us, he was just a few inches away from the table so it felt uncomfortable. Just an observation - I am well aware of the space limitations on everything in this city. \n\nOur very nice and accommodating server provided us with some water while we waited. My husband chose the Kobe beef chow menu and I chose the spicy garlic noodles with an addition of fried chicken at our server's suggestion. The wait for our food was about 10-15 mins, pretty reasonable with it being made to order right in front of me. I loved all the smells in the kitchen - it took me right to my dad's kitchen (he's a Cantonese chef). Even my husband commented it smelled just like my parents' kitchen. Once we got everything back to the hotel (extra sambal requested), time to dig in.  I am a fan of chili-spicy so I usually request additional spice to tune the dish to my taste after I've had a first bite. The fried chicken was delicious - salty, Asian spices with a hint of sweet. I expected just a few pieces in my meal but there were at least 8-10 pieces, about 1 x .5 inches - decent sizes!  The breaking makes me think of Taiwanese popcorn chicken so that may be their inspiration. Either way, they were yummy (more so dipped in sambal but that is based on your own preference). Finally got to my noodles and they also were very good - love the combination of peppers, garlic, soy sauce, and egg noodles any day and this did not disappoint. I will say I would found the dish to be a little bit more bland without the addition of the chicken. It wasn't quite to my spice level so I had to add sambal but that's me.  I would say on a scale of 1 - 10 with 10 being burn your face off spicy, this was more like a 2 or 3. \n\nI tried my husband's kobe beef noodles and liked those as well - especially the Szechuan paste. It was a little sweet which made me think they must incorporate soy sauce and mirin in it as well.  I used to think chili ran in my veins but it probably is more soy sauce. I found the piece of beef I tasted to be slightly chewy but that doesn't bother me. \n\nMy husband and I are chopstick users so it was nice to see chopsticks on every table (forks only by request) and when I asked for chopsticks to-go, they were already in the bag - no forks included. I feel like in such a diverse city not offering forks/spoons/knives right always encourages patrons to eat the meals with the preferred utensils. \n\nOverall the meal was delicious, even as take out. Next time we're in town I'd like to try their stir fried green beans (they smelled AMAZING) and the AYCE dim sum on the weekends.", "author": "Julie W."}

Great house sauce. \n\nPeking Duck Steam Bun - Comes with four, with very lean meat (which I like, even if that's not how peking duck should be). I ate all of them. Slightly oily.

We weren't seated by order; the servers let a family of 4 cut us for a booth... when literally all of their seats were by booths. Just by instinct, this was a bad sign.\n\nWhen we were seated, it was around 6, and a nice waitress came, recommended some wines and we went with a red from Peju winery, as well as their in-house sake.

It was a rip off being mostly spice and soy sauce. C'mon. \n\n(++++) Spicy Garlic Noodles\n\nThis was perhaps the only dish that saved them from a 1 star review. These noodles were well-seasoned and lightly saucy, really hittin' the spot by a stream of flavors in every bite.\n\n(-) Korean Pork Tacos\n\nOur waitress was for some reason, overtly excited, maybe perhaps cause she was Caucasian, on how we had to try the Korean Pork Tacos... which were a big let down.

For $11, you aren't getting your money's worth here either.\n\nI noticed as we finished our table, and the restaurant began to fill, it's more of a place to get shit-faced and not care about the food....

I got the BBQ pork fried rice which was pretty good but nothing amazing. Just tasted like any other typical fried rice? They were really generous with their BBQ pork servings though so I liked that. It was also pretty decently priced--I think it was probably only about $9 or so and it was a completely full take out box so in terms of how filling it was and good it was, it was pretty solid. Wouldn't necessarily ever crave this, but it's good. \n\nThe fried chicken take-out portion is pretty small, fyi\n\ntldr; okay Chinese food from Caviar, nothing special", "author": "Jasmine X."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-04", "description": "I saw in my feed the other day about Chubby Noodle launching their bottomless dim sum brunch this weekend for $37 pp.  I wasn't expecting much, but I thought why not, so I booked a table for yesterday at 10:30 for us through Yelp's SeatMe.  The first available reservations were for 10:15, & we arrived then & two other parties but were told to sit at the bar while they finish getting ready.  Boozy drinks were also included and you can order up to 4.  We started off the hoang mimosa.  It was refreshing but not sweet nor tart nor overly boozy.  Loved the cute mini rubber ducky floating in it.  Later on we also sampled a rose sangria.  I usually don't enjoy rose wine but this was light and not too floraly, with a hint of the fruit as well. \n\nWe were seated at a small table a few minutes before our reservation.  There were 15 dishes on the menu and 4 included boozy drinks and about 3 other wines you can pay an additional fee for.  We started off with orderinf the breakfast jook, hot & sour soup, Peking duck, shrimp dumpling & chicken Shanghai dumpling.  It seems that our waitress got mixed up & put in an order of the wonton soup instead of hot & sour, which was actually ok with me since I'm not a fan of hot & sour, sorry dear!  The broth was very light and had bean sprouts in it, kind of reminded me of pho thought it was a light duck broth.  There were also bok choy and three delicious delicate wontons.  Next came the star of the meal, the breakfast jook!  I always love a good bowl of traditional plain jook, but this was by far the best bowl of jook ever (sorry grandparents!).  Everyone has their jook consistency preference, but I like mine slightly chunky with enough broth (so not just chunks of the rice but not that liquidy either), and this one was this.  Plus the over easy egg, smoked bacon & fried bits of onion - HEAVENLY!  I was so tempted to get another bowl.  They paced the dishes well and we were always able to order more though there were a couple snafus but it's understandable as this was their first day of rolling this out.  After a little bit came the Peking duck buns.  The buns were so fluffy!  The duck was roasted though was way more fatty than meat but was a good attempt on a traditional dish.  Some of the skin was a little more soggy than crispy.  Half way during the meal they told us that they were out of the shrimp dumpling but asked if we wanted to order the pork and beef siu Mai instead and we agreed.  Next up: the salt and pepper shrimp.  I liked how it wasn't overly fried like it typically is in most Chinese restaurants but a teeny bit on the bland side.  The chicken chow mein was hot with chilies and jalape\u00f1os in it.  We liked how they put the fried onion strings in there and there was plenty of chicken in it as well.  The Shanghai chicken dumpling was my least favorite, I think due to the ginger and thick wrapper.  The pork and beef siu Mai, though the wrapper was very thin (filling fell out after first bite), this was excellent.  Great flavor from the meat combo & I would take this over the traditional shrimp, pork and mushroom filling.  Wrapping up the meal, we were told that the shrimp dumplings were now available and asked if we wanted them and we said sure.    We ordered their popular kung pao wings.  They were crisply fried and were covered in this spicy sauce.  Spiciest second to the chow mein actually.  I think it's just that they still needed time to prep some of the dumplings after opening.  The shrimp dumplings were shaped differently than the normal ha gaw, they were shaped like the scallop dumplings you normally see.  Again, thin wrapper, plump bits of shrimps formed together.  Lastly we closed it out with the shrimp fried rice.  Our waitress accidentally put in for the XO sauce rice cakes, but the she and the staff were very apologetic and got our fried rice out to us shortly.  The fried rice had lots of big shrimps and was simple with eggs, rice and some green onions.  We also liked how it wasn't greasy.  What I really like about CN too is their assortment of sauces they give you - a green onion soy sesame oil blend, the chili sauce and what I think was a very mild version of their hot mustard sauce.  \n\nI don't think everything that our stomachs allowed us to sample was amazing, but the brunch deal was a great deal especially with the four alcoholic drinks included.  I would definitely come back and try to sample some things that I didn't get to and some of our favorites like the breakfast jook, wings & siu mai!  We were pleasantly surprised by Chubby Noodle and I know that after this weekend, the bottomless dim sum brunch will be running so smoothly.  I would be open to coming back to trying their dinner menu as well.  Friendly staff, comforting eats, cute minimal decor, & good wine based cocktails.  CN staff- Can you please have the breakfast jook available all day?  It's foodgasmic!  3.5 but rounded up to 4 stars, better than some other fusion restaurants.", "author": "Cat C."}

We had heard great things about Chubby Noodle and tried to walk in sans-reservation.  The wait was going to be 45+min, so we went elsewhere.  That said, my interest was definitely piqued.\n\nI came back with my wife on a slower Sunday - again without reservation.  Luckily, we were seated immediately.  The restaurant is very stylish with dim lighting and lots of wood-grain decor.  The music was loud in an enjoyable way and not in an \"I-can't-hear-what-others-at-my-table-are-saying\" sort of way.  That evening, they were playing some early 2000's R&B and Hip Hop (think JA Rule featuring Ashanti) that brought my wife and I back to high school / college and smiles to our faces.\n\nFood wise, we initially ordered the Tuna Poke, Salmon Sashimi, and Spicy Garlic Noodles. We asked the waiter whether this was enough food, so after playing the \"how hungry are you?\" game, he politely suggested that we hang on to a menu.  It turns out that we were, in fact, HECKA hungry, so we added the Kung Pao Chicken Wings later on.\n\nThe food was excellent.  It was tough to pick a favorite among the dishes that we had.  I really liked the Spicy Garlic Noodles given the spice and texture.  The Kung Pao Chicken Wings reminded me of the Indo-Chinese Hakka staple, Chili Chicken, which I'm really fond of.  The Salmon Sashimi, with it's chilled avocado sauce, was great too.  Man, it really is hard to pick a favorite - trussss me!\n\nI'm looking forward to going back and trying more dishes.", "author": "Sebastian N."}

Thankfully, Chubby Noodle FAR exceeds expectations.\n\nI went for brunch this past weekend with a friend, and we ordered the entire menu (less the two soups) and four drinks each.  The food was awesome.  I really enjoyed every dish on the menu and was very pleased that everything came out piping hot and obviously very fresh.  My favorite dishes were the Breakfast Jook, the Shanghai Dumplings, the Peking Duck Steam Bun, and the Salt & Pepper Prawns - but, honestly, I really would eat every dish again.  \n\nFor cocktails, we tried the cold tea and the sangria, and we preferred the sangria.  I love that the drinks come with tiny neon ducks in them, and the waitstaff let us take ours home (in fact, they even gave us an extra one on the way out).  \n\nFor all that we ate and drank, I still can't believe it was only $35/person.  This is a great, great deal.  And the environment is so fun!  There were a couple of big groups celebrating various occasions and they made the atmosphere so upbeat.\n\nChubby Noodle loses a star because (a) the music is WAY too loud (we were screaming the entire time) and (b) the service was very slow and apathetic.  Our waitress forgot a number of items in our order and rarely came back to check on us, meaning that we had to keep chasing her or someone else down in order to get drinks or more food and make good use of our 90 minute bottomless brunch.", "author": "Tay H."}

It's also a shared plate experience with a solid Japanese beer and soju collection. \n\nTop picks in the Marina:\nSPICY GARLIC NOODLES - pile on the noodles! What's not to like about charred garlic and jalapeno? It reminded me of SO's black bean noodle dish, sans black beans. \nSALT & PEPPER SHRIMP - sure, it's a modest serving but every bite is worth it.\nGARLIC GREEN BEANS - these were stupid good. Almost better than the meat dishes which sounds silly. They caramelize it perfectly so it's smoky, garlicky and sticky delicious. \n\nThe BBQ pork fried rice and Kung Pao Wings were decent but not remarkable enough to make much of an impression. \n\nTop picks in North Beach:\nCHUBBY FRIED CHICKEN - that buttermilk brine though. It's a beast to do at home (multi day process = agonizing). I always appreciate those who go an extra mile to create juicy chicken. These are bone-free so have at it!\n\nMy primary gripe is the pounding music they blast at major decibels (at both locations mind you) and then crank up even further as soon as it becomes dinner hour.

Who would have thought bacon and egg on porridge could be so delicious. My favorite dish in the entire menu. Add a little bit of hot sauce and it's the best thing in the world. \n\nDumplings. - Great! Really flavorful and was surprised that dumplings that weren't really made from a Chinese restaurant would even be on par. Their Shanghai dumplings weren't traditional Chinese dumplings but they were still good. \n\nChilled ramen - Good! Mix everything in the bowl and you got a really good chill ramen. The taste was nice and clean and you could taste every ingredient. Noodles were cooked pretty well so they weren't too chewy or soft. \n\nPork and shrimp wonton - Great! full flavored and wasn't heavy with the salt like normal dim sum places. Could definitely taste the shrimp and pork. \n\nMimosa - Yum. They were giving out cups of mimosas and they were good. Made perfectly so you tasted just a hint of the alcohol. The duck floating in there was fun. \n\nThe Okay. \n\nWonton soup - Not bad. Very light flavored and the wontons were juicy but not much flavor to them itself. The bok choy had absolutely no flavor. Maybe the soup was too light. I still liked it however. \n\nSalt and Pepper shrimp - Not bad. The shrimp was seasoned nicely and the sauce gave it a nice kick. Would order this again but it seemed too plain. \n\nThe not so good\n\nChubby Chicken Chow Mein - Bad. All I taste is oil and soy sauce. Way too much soy sauce. Totally masked any flavor the dish had and just. soy. sauce. everywhere. \n\nHot and sour soup - Weak. It wasn't sour nor hot and it seemed like there was just too much going on in there. Too bland and not enough of the bold sour nor spicy taste. \n\nPekin Duck steam bun - Now the taste actually wasn't bad but it's the set up is weird. Usually, the duck is cut in slices so you can just pick up the meat and put it on the bun. This dish, you had to cut it yourself and it was just a mess trying to get the fat off. Could have been better presented. \n\nRice cake in XO sauce - This is in between the Okay and bad rankings. I liked it the first time I tried one but after the second and third one, it was just way too sweet. The sweetness overtook the peppers and just left it tasting like soft candy. \n\nKung pao chicken wings - These looked better than it tasted. Well, there wasn't much taste to it. It looked spicy and full of flavor but when I bit into it, it was a let down. I love chicken wings so I was pretty disappointed in this dish. \n\nOverall the place has a great atmosphere and awesome for dinner parties. The staff was all really friendly and quick to bring out the dishes. The food here is pretty good. Some better then others as you can see in my review above. I'd come here again for the porridge alone.", "author": "Will C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-29", "description": "My biggest complaint about Chubby Noodle is the confusing logo on the sign outside. First of all, only one of the noodles has a face. It's sort of disturbing. Second of all, that one noodle with the face is very wide (or flat), but definitely not chubby. Third of all, the colors of the sign really clash, and being super lit at night doesn't help at all either. \n\nAll logos aside, I loved the food at Chubby Noodle. I ordered the spicy garlic noodles with fried chicken (you have your choice of meat), Korean pork tacos, BBQ pork fried rice (+ egg), salt & pepper shrimp, and garlic green beans. The pork tacos run out, so be sure to order those if still available. I definitely advise adding an egg if you order the BBQ pork fried rice. Everything tastes better with an egg. The garlic green beans were actually the tastiest of all the dishes with the garlic noodles being a close second. The salt & pepper shrimp were a bit of a miss, but still decent with the provided sauce.\n\nService was a bit slow as our waiter repeatedly forgot to refill our water. However, he was super helpful in describing each dish and even asked questions about our preferences and reasons for selecting certain dishes in order to give us better recommendations. This location has reservations so it makes it a bit easier to visit, compared to the North Beach location.", "author": "Daniel S."}

The chicken comes in thick, moist cube pieces. The dipping sauce is to die for! However, ask for EXTRA sauce. They give you one small container of sauce with 30 piece of chicken. Come on, really??!!! The sauce is what sets off your taste buds! The container should be bigger to accommodate the amount of chicken given. Overall, this dish isn't to be missed. You will be in heaven with every bite! \n\nThe BBQ Pork Fried Rice is tasty. The pork is marinated to PERFECTION! What more to say, the rice is always a winner!\n\nCucumber Salad a must. Just cucumbers in rice vinegar with sesame seeds. You can't go wrong.\n\nThe Korean Pork Tacos were extremely greasy. The tortilla shells are drenched with oil. Almost too greasy to hold. Mostly importantly, too greasy and oily to eat. The pork is mediocre. It's flavorless and dry. I would have preferred the bbq pork used in the fried rice.The yogurt chilli sauce is pretty good. Nice flavor and texture. The best part of the dish. Definitely wouldn't buy the tacos again.\n\nThe Pork Ribs are EXTREMELY SALTY! The ribs are marinated in vinegar soy glaze. It sounds delicious on the menu, however, it taste horrible. Your given three ribs. MOSTLY BONE. Which isn't enough for the 15 dollar price tag. The soy flavor is overpowering and pugent which distracts you from enjoying the meal. I would suggest adding brown sugar to offset and compliment the salty element. I would never ever buy these ribs again. Complete waste of money!  \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty laid back. They have music playing in the background. Great playlist! However the music is so loud, you find yourself yelling. Not cool! The employees are always welcoming and friendly. A plus! No one like to spend money at an establishment that doesn't recognize them once they walk in the door!\n\nThe restrooms need to be cleaned on more of a consistent basis. The restrooms are unisex. With that being said, it frustrating going to a  restaurant with good food but horrible restrooms. They need to attend to the restrooms every 2 hours. If a restaurant has a nasty restroom it pretty much determines if I will come back. Please work on the janitorial aspect of the restaurant. I strongly urge that! \n\nOverall, good experience. I would come back. Forgot to mention, ordered food in December 2016. I've only ordered take-out. Phone orders take about 20 - 25 mins. Pretty curious about there dine-in service. \n\nP.S.

So we did!\n\nOnce we got there we got our drinks and everything all good. The waitress said that its family style. Not quite. Well, coming from NY family style to us is massive plates so i don't know about California family style.. She recommended ordering 5-6 different things on the menu but we  got 4 and it was plenty (for 2). \nEverything was very good. The pork/shrimp wontons were a tad toooo spicy for my liking and the pork tacos, which were delicious, only came as 2 tacos (clearly not family style).\n\nOverall, food and service was very good.

I think that the concept is cool, but ultimately it falls short from the hype that is created by the cool concept. In general, dim sum is cheap enough to eat to your heart's content for less than the AYCE price offered by Chubby Noodle ($37). While the food was good, it was also not very memorable.  The variety of food and cost of food don't live up to the hype. They also don't have non-alcholic beverages other than water.\n\nI do think the quality of the food is good, the service was awesome, and I was satisfied.

Fail if they wanted to be anything else.\n\nService was good, though I'm confused why we had to wait (not for too long) when there were open tables. We grabbed drinks while I wondered, but the music was loud enough to stamp out my thoughts. With music that loud you'd assume they'd have a full bar, and no, you won't think it's loud if you're a lush and used to screaming to have a conversation. Wasn't Chris Brown on an alcohol fueled rage when committing his crimes? If your entire playlist is Chris Brown's hits (ba dap ch), you might as well round out honoring his doucheness by having a liquor license. \n\nI digress. The spicy garlic noodles were indeed garlicky and really only spicy if you bit into a jalape\u00f1o. Yummy! But I couldn't help but think for the same $10 I could've had 10x as much if I just went to an Asian grocery, bought ramen, and added garlic and jalape\u00f1os.\n\nThe Korean tacos didn't taste Korean at all. The kimchi was more sweet than spicy. I've had much, much better wings (they were flavorful, but too soggy for my liking). The one cocktail they offer (Cold Tea) was reminiscent of a bad home remedy my mom would make me drink and make my throat burn if I was sick.\n\nDo not go here with a date expecting to have a conversation, unless you're used to leaning into each other's faces and screaming.

The String Beans were amazing. The sauce they used had good amount of flavor, mixed well with the string bean's crunch to create a good multi-dimensional dish. The garlic noodles were also good. This is very similar to the noodles you'd get in a Cantonese banquet style restaurant (usually served with lobster) but not as heavy as the lobster noodles. The pork bun however, wasn't as amazing. I wasn't overly wowed by it and if I came back, I'd probably not get that again. The sashimi had a very unique flavor profile to it. They had an avocado puree/cream on it and when it mixed with the fish, it created this flavor profile that closely resembles yogurt drink (the korean/japanese/asian kind that you'd find in Asian supermarkets) and that was very off putting. I personally don't like it but other members of my party did.\nService: 7/10\n The service here is pretty standard, nothing special. It was a Thursday night in SF and they managed to seat us fairly quickly. Their servers knew what they were talking about and were pretty attentive. Nothing bad to say about the service here.\nOverall: 8/10\nAdditional Notes: This place has good food and a great atmosphere. What's amazing about it was the music they were playing. They played 2000s musics but not too loud (like in clubs/bars) that you can't have a decent conversation, but just enough to get you wanting to start moving.

This one star review is strictly for the rude server, and the inability for Chubby Noodle to accommodate my food allergy and take it seriously. I was treated as a nuisance instead of a paying customer. Not only that but they told me they would accommodate my allergy and didn't, so I got extremely ill.\n\nWhen we ordered, I told our server that I have a severe allergy to wheat and products that contain gluten. She literally said this: \"Nothing on the menu is gluten free and we don't do any substitutions. Do you even know what gluten is? No one does. Didn't you see that Jimmy Kimmel skit?\"\n\nTwo things about this statement:\n1- NOTHING on menu is gluten free? Fine. I understand if your chef doesn't want to undermine the integrity of his food with substitutions, but when it comes to your customers' health, I would think they would be willing to make a compromise.  \n2- The Jimmy Kimmel skit she is talking about it actually completely hilarious. He asks random gluten-free people what gluten is and they have no idea. However, i DO know what gluten is. I spent thousands of dollars in medial research and endoscopies earlier this year to figure out what was wrong with my stomach. I was finally diagnosed with a severe gluten allergy. So this is not a joke as this woman clearly thinks.\n\nSince I couldn't eat anything at Chubby Noodle, our table was going to finish our drinks and leave. Then the hostess (who may also be a manager or owner?) came over and assured me that they could make a flounder dish for me without the soy sauce (which contains wheat) and the flour they typically use. \n\nSo we stayed and the atmosphere is really fun! They were playing great music like Juvenile's Back Yo Ass Up (the original twerk). The food is also pretty good. I could only eat the \"special\" flounder, but I definitely liked it.\n\nFast forward to 3 am. I got SO SICK all night and then all day today. This is what typically happens when I eat gluten, so I know that whoever put my order in did not tell the chef to make it gluten free. Its really disappointing and upsetting that a restaurant would be so adverse to accommodating people with allergies. If I was allergic to peanuts would you have still put peanuts in the dish?? Its so rude to treat people like they're lying and that I *wouldn't notice* if some gluten was put into my dish. \n\nMy whole day was shot. Had to call in sick to work.

The reason for the low rating was the lame, negative and sarcastic attitude of the manager after sending a bad glass of wine back. The wines they have to offer there aren't bad, but the keg tap system they use to store and pour them must allow for too much oxygen ingress so the red wines go bad quickly is my guess. 3 different glasses of wine and they were all pretty bad. Bad wine doesn't at all deter me from coming back - I couldn't care less and would go with a beer next time.

We then had the BBQ pork fried rice, which had really authentic flavors and wasn't too greasy at all. My favorite dish of the night was the garlic noodles.

However, the atmosphere was really bad and I can't overlook it. To preface, the server was really nice and had recommendations and made us feel welcome.  I had read before going that there was loud music and that's not a huge deal to me. The music was up pretty high and was early '00s hits, which I can usually dig. However, about 2/3 of the restaurant was apparently a large party and they were screaming and dancing and singing in this very tiny space. It was really rude and disrupting. Normally I wouldn't blame this on the restaurant, it's not their fault that some people over do it, but no one ever asked them to tone it down and at one point they even turned up the already loud music to try to cover up the sound of the party, which made it impossible to talk to anyone else at our table. \n\nIn a scenario like this when a large rowdy party is taking up the majority of the restaurant I think the restaurant should have required them to book out the whole thing. I saw one table walk out because of it and we definitely won't be going back.", "author": "Petra M."}

Did I mention LOuD music? As in, you have to SHOUT into the person across the table's ear to have a chance to be heard. It was ridiculous and strangely amusing, especially when I embodied Will Farrell and let myself be engulfed by the chaos. \n\nOh, and they also serve food so I should mention that.. Actually, even though our waitress messed up the order because the noise interceded, she was awesome at friendliness and patience. Like a warm angel accepting her probable lot in life to be deaf by 35. Other staff were also handling things like a champ, and the manager seemed like a good man. \n\nOn to the food: basically avoid the salads but the $10 chicken chow mein was actually pretty good and I'd even order it again.

If you ask me, I'd have to admit they failed to impress me with their Americanized rendition of a Pan Asian menu. My two friends and I came in just after 6pm and luckily swooped one of the last booths before the entire restaurant really filled up. We ordered the garlic noodle (and add $3 for BBQ pork, seriously?!!?), the kung pao chicken, and the salmon sashimi. Each dish ranged from $11-$14 or so. It is meant to be served family style. We first started with the garlic noodles and I swear there was a funky garlic taste to the noodles, like it was spoiled? It had a sour smell to it and it was displeasing. The BBQ pork add on was mediocre. The sashimi was one of my favorites, fresh in taste and lightly dipped into soy sauce base. The kung pao chicken was beyond spicy. It was perfectly fried but the peppers overpowered the entire dish and we couldn't even finish the measly 8 or so pieces. \n\nSuch a bummer that my experience was below my expectations because I had really high hopes for this place.

Found this out after sitting down and opening the menu, unfortunately... my bad for not checking in advance, I guess, but still -- it's strange to co-brand it and not keep some of the key elements of what made the original location popular (i.e., garlic noodles, ramen...), as I don't think I'm the first to make this mistake. The menu is organized by themes (noodles, meat, seafood, dim sum), and it's a mish-mash of Japanese (hamachi), Korean (japchae), and Chinese (dim sum items, cumin lamb) dishes -- does that make it Asian fusion? Unclear. But it made me confused as to what was going on.\n\nWe ordered:\nHAMACHI - the only standout of the entire meal. would i come back for it? no, but if i were forced to eat here again, i would order this.\nSHRIMP SHUMAI - came with 5 pieces, which I found weird since i've never seen this serving size in any chinese restaurant i've been to, usually it's in portions of 3-4. For our party of two, this was especially awkward. also it wasn't that good.\nSCALLION BREAD - i don't remember much about this dish either way.\nCHICKEN NOODLE SOUP - this came recommended, but was terrible. underseasoned, overcooked noodles that did not taste fresh, lots of salt but still managed to be extremely bland. very small portions of fried chicken. did not finish this.\n\nService was very friendly, since we went the first week the owner came and introduced the menu. My one piece of feedback here would be that w/o even asking us what we wanted to order (which we did, after studying the menu on our own), he proceeded to launch into a detailed explanation of both the drink and food menu, which we were forced to listen to politely for over 5 minutes. I think this would have been perfectly okay had we asked him for recommendations, but we didn't, we were hungry and ready to order. Totally understand that it was the first week and he's proud of the menu and the thought / detail that's gone into it, but the customer's needs still come first.\n\nStill think the place had a nice, laid back vibe and it has potential if they work on their menu and take a page out of their North Beach sister restaurant's notebook in terms of menu offerings.", "author": "Jessica W."}

Hes only 7 months old but he sat up well propped next to me in the booth. \nIt didn't appear they had high chairs and the seating was mostly fixed so just an FYI for you parents out there. Now for what matters, the food.\n\nWe began with the tuna poke and the chicken wings. The tuna was excellent and came out in 3 minutes flat. The wings were awesome but did take 20 minutes to get. We were told this is because they are double fried. We also had the bbq pork rice which beat the wings to the table. I could have used a little more seasoning in the rice itself but the pork was oh so good! Adding to the carb load we opted for the garlic noodles next. They were delish! I had hopes they wold be spicy but I think the chicken wings blew my spice sensor off the scale. Not like the wings were so crazy spicy or anything but the noodles werent even close to the same heat level so its hard to say. We finished the meal with the Korean tacos. These were good but not as great as I had hoped. I did enjoy the sauce on them though, it almost had this shawarma thing going on that I found very interesting. \n\nThe service was spectacular and attentive. I had a Pine Street Pale Ale beer that I had never had before so that was cool. The beer was very easy on the palate, almost more of a light beer than a typical Cali pale ale but oh well as it washed the food down nicely.\n\nI'm looking forward to going back, thanks Chubby Noodle!", "author": "Michael B."}

I had the garlic noodles, ceviche, beef tacos, and sliced salmon. The ceviche was very disappointing, the taste was odd and not what I was expecting. It comes in 2 bowl shaped chips, and did not taste like any ceviche I've had before. The avacado threw me off. Was looking forward to a vinegar taste, but it was almost too sweet. Could hardly taste the fish in it. The slice salmon was OK, nothing spectacular. The garlic noodles are a hit on Yelp, and I was really looking forward to it. It was good, but imo a little too spicy. The best dish was definitely the beef tacos. It was the salvation of the entire meal. Great taste, and whatever sauce they used was spectacular. \n\nI enjoyed the music, the 90's hiphop is right up my alley. Some people are saying that it was too loud, but I didn't feel like it was.\n\nOne glaring thing that took away from the experience was when a dish was \"lost on the ticket\" or something, and my friend had to wait until after everyone had finished eating before being brought his ramen noodles. It was taken off the check but the waittress had brought up ramen noodles like 3 times and how \"they were on their way\". But clearly they were not. Overall, the Chubby Noodle falls slightly below what my expectations were based on the reviews here. I would probably not dine here again.", "author": "D B."}

I live in the neighborhood and wanted to try something new.  I walked in on a Tuesday evening, meeting a friend, she was walking down from her place.  I was told to stand in the bar area until my friend arrived.  The place is small so it felt awkward to stand in the bar area since it isn't really removed from the rest of the place.  I just wanted to sit down and both servers told me to wait. So my friend arrives and the server chooses to put us at some tiny table with 2 stools in the corner near some boxes of restaurant supplies.  There is a booth wide open, has been vacant for 10 minutes at least.  She rudely states that she wants to keep the table for 4 people, while every other booth in the place is occupied by only 2 people.  I walked out. I get the 4 people thing but I wasn't going to sit at the kid table and there was another table vacant that 6 people could have sat at easily.  Why keep a paying customer standing looking at a vacant table?  I wanted to sit down and order something and get my dinner started.  This is poor business sense in my opinion so you can keep your asian fusion hipster spot...plenty plenty other places to eat asian in SF without the attitude...and by the way I've been in the restaurant biz my whole life there's no substitute for treating people with respect, don't care how good the food is.", "author": "Hip P."}

The first thing we noticed when we walked in is that we are the only Asians in this \"Asian\" restaurant.  The place is small, if you are 40 years old, you are the oldest person in this place, the music was blasting really loud, so loud that every time the phone rings, the manager had to walk outside to take togo orders.  Back to the music, like I said, if you are 40 years old, you are too old, if your child is under 12, they are too young because blasting out of their speakers is nothing but \"f*ck this b*tch\", \"f*ck that b*tch\", \"I want mo money for hookers and p*ssy\" and this sh*t goes on for hours.  How's the food? Well I lied about it being salty because their duck lettuce wrap was just bland and dried, and to make to make it worst, the meat is shredded sitting on a hot iron flat top, so it dries out further as you eat it.  The \"Korean\" tacos was nothing to write home about, the meat, once again was dried, and damn salty.  What's missing is some kind of Kimchi or pickle, something sweet and sour to add to the tacos, instead of a couple of salty pieces of meat and a salty dressing on top.  The most disappointed item was the \"ribs\", you figured since it is sitting in a pool of soy sauce and vinegar, it should be moist, instead, once again, its dried and salty. The rest was just average, the Papayi Salad, the Garlic Noodle ($10 for a small bowl of nothing but noodle?), the 7UP from the bottle was good.

So without wasting any more of your precious time, I'm going to break my experience down for you.\n\n1) Very \"hot\" spot for that late night snack crave.\n(\"Hot\" as in popular and also in the sense that some items really do have serious kick.)\n\n2) Environmentally friendy although also unorthodox to a country boy like me.\n- Best ambient music I've ever had while chewing my food. \n(If you're into Pac, Bone Thugz, and Snoop D O double G)\n- Even though quite small (what else would you expect in SF?) enough for one with claustrophobia to handle with ease on a packed night. Hopefully.\n\n3) Unquestionably the best service I've ever had by a dude named Mark?\n(Couldn't hear very well while I was rapping in my head along with Pac's Dear Mama in the BG)\n\n4) Price is ok? Portion's pretty personal. Is it worth it to go out of your way here? If you're in a mile radius... or if your pregnant wife is nagging you senseless that she's craving the salt and peppered prawns, then you better get your ass over here pronto.\n\n5) Would I recommend this place? Yes but only if you got money to blow and it's the only thing open @ 10:30p.m.\n\nThank you for making it to the end of my review. I hope it helped you out with making your decisions. lol", "author": "Jester C."}

All kinds of Asian fusion food with a bunch of items to satisfy anyone. Arrived at around 7 pm on a Monday and were seated immediately. Dishes were meant to share and we were very full with three dishes for two people although our appetites are def on the small side. \n\nFood wise we ordered:\n-Tuna poke ($13) which was a great appetizer. Fish tasted fresh and had a tasty soy garlic sauce. It also came with shrimp chips which was a nice surprise for me. Maybe a little small but it was good enough to offset the price.\n-Kung pow wings ($8) to satisfy the wing craving. They looked like San Tung wings but weren't as good (what wings are though...?). Order came with 6 small saucy wings. They had great flavor and the meat was moist inside. One of the better Asian inspired chicken wings I've tasted and they definitely hit the spot. \n-chile prawn noodles to fulfill our noodle requirement. It looked and smelled amazing. It had wide flat noodles with a dark yellow curry similar to Thai curry. Our server warned us that it was pretty spicy, but I was ready. It doesn't look spicy at all and after the first bite it wasn't spicy at all and I thought tasted a little bland. Oh man was I wrong about both things. Each bite tasted better and better and spicier and spicier! I could not stop eating it, even after my mouth was on fire and my nose was running. You need to try this. My friend agreed that it tasted better and better as you keep eating but she didn't think it was that spicy... No ragrets after eating the dish.\nI would definitely come back to try the garlic noodles which were said to be the most popular dish. The Peking duck looked quite tasty. They have a selection of beer and sake as well that looked interesting but we didn't try any since it was a Monday. \n\nThe restaurant itself is small and I could see how there could be a wait. Good luck with parking. Service was A+ as our server, mark, was super friendly and helpful and probably laughed when he saw how much water I drank... Also, I  was jamming to that 90s hip hop playing. Nothing better than having biggie or Btnh rap while you eat.", "author": "Andy W."}

One evening with their standard menu we had an excellent choice of small plates to share and they did not miss a beat on anything. Every single plate was excellent, service was great and the waitperson was very helpful in guiding us through the menu and the sake choices. Based upon this experience I returned on a Sunday for lunch. We were notified it was a prie fixe menu at a set price. Not a good choice! The plates were limited, came out randomly and  the preparation was quite standard. The lure of 'all you can eat' was actually limited. I would not return for a Sunday meal.\nI do give kudos for the regular evening menu .\nThe space is rather cramped like a diner which is ok and part of the experience.\nService is much better during the week.\nAs the space is limited the noise factor is high and you cannot expect to being part of the next table over conversation.

It was almost like they were treating this as a multi-course meal at a nice restaurant. Hopefully when they get busier they'll just bring all the food so you can eat it. We were starving and awkwardly eating small portions then waiting 15 minutes for the next dish. Dinner lasted at least an hour and a half.\n\nIf I had it to do over, I'd come here with a friend and sit at the bar, until they figure out the service. I hope they tweak the menu but that seems to be a disappointment that won't go away.\n\nAll this said, the options near here are so limited that I will likely be back, and hopefully have a better experience!", "author": "Robbie K."}

Poke, Salmon sashimi, pork tacos, house made kimchi, and green beans.  I love trying different kimchi, and I have to say this was the best I have ever had.  They were not busy, with only one other table, but the service was lightning fast.  The pricing is very fair as well.
