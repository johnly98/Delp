Pro tip: order ahead of time here on Yelp before you make your way here so that you can skip the line and pick up your order upon arrival.\n\nThe Italian combo sandwich on Dutch crunch has been one of my go-tos: a huge heap of meats embedded in some really nice, fresh, delicious bread. When I'm not in the mood for so many calories (or processed meat), the falafel pita sandwich has also been a dependable go-to, although here I order a larger size to compensate for the fact that it's not meaty.\n\nThe owner who mans the premises is a super cool guy, and in addition to the sandwiches, you can grab sodas, chips, or other snacks. It's basically your urban neighborhood corner store with a deli that punches far beyond its weight. Thanks Yelpers for an exceptional find!", "author": "Vincent L."}

They mentioned it was a staple sandwich spot in the city and we had to try. \n\nIt's a really small shop that looks like it hasn't changed in many years, not a bad thing at all. They had many different options for sub sandwiches, a small deli fridge with some salads and a large selection of drinks, chips and candy. \n\nThe staff isn't super friendly or outgoing, but work with a purpose and bang out sandwiches relatively quickly. \n\nI ordered the Italian combo sandwich that had salami, ham, cotto and cheese on soft sourdough.

Yeah, sure, touristy stuff is always fun to do, but when you see a line out the door for an unassuming eatery, you knew I had to ditch whatever lunch plans I'd made, and stop in. \n\nFreddie's Sandwiches has been around since 1926, and walking into this sandwich shop will time warp you to that era.  Old wood shelving, a simple counter top and deli meat display case, weathered menu and an old school register. Place your order, stand to the side and wait (not long) for the hard working sandwich makers to put together your sandwich.\n\nI went with the turkey pastrami (hot) and was not disappointed.  It was stacked high, tender and juicy, and perhaps the best part was it didn't have the stringy pieces traditional pastrami normally has (oh, and I could swear I was eating regular beef pastrami the whole time).  They also cut the sandwiches in half, and individually wrap the pieces, because these sandwiches are PACKED and you'll have trouble eating the whole thing.\n\nAfter spending two days in San Francisco, my wallet was starting to yell at me every time I opened it up to spend money (stuff is expensive here).  Not at Freddie's. The price I paid for my enormous sandwich and soda (around $12) wasn't bad at all.", "author": "Rafael A."}

This beats having to go down to Trader Joe's for lunch, and it definitely beats overpaying for a sandwich down in the Financial District. I spent less than $10 here and walked away stuffed, so this is definitely a good lunch choice.\n\nI went for a small Italian sub with small side of potato salad. The Italian sub was delicious and the meat bountiful. Their salame and salame cotto are special standouts, while ham is a reliable, salty addition. All the fixings here includes pickles, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and mustard. Some add-ons are free, such as their garlic spread, which is a little similar to the one at Little Lucca down south. If you're coming with another person, you could theoretically buy two sandwiches and swap, as they come wrapped as two halves.  For $6.95, this is a San Francisco steal.\n\nThe potato salad was sadly not what I expected. This tasted like a mishmash of egg salad and potato salad, and I don't really like egg salad. However, the portion was quite good for $2 more. \n\nThe other sides, like pasta salad and potato chips, are also relatively affordable. There are also many drink options if you're craving something sweet. From Mexican Coke to guava Fanta, there's bound to be something from your childhood that you desperately want to have. And if anyone gets a chance to try what looks like homemade baklava on their counters, let me know how it goes, 'cause I'm craving.", "author": "Gwen W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-15", "description": "90 years is a great run.  Think about it, when this place got started, Calvin Coolidge was the President.  Silent Cal.  I kid you not.  The Depression was years away, Franklin Roosevelt wasn't even the Governor of New York yet.  It was Prohibition.  Several of my grandparents weren't even born.  There was no such thing as Mickey Mouse.  No Golden Gate or Bay Bridges.  30 years away from the Giants and Dodgers coming to California.  Don't even think about TV, Computers, or Cell Phones.  Or, Smart Phones.  We are talking seriously back in the day.  Old School.  And, my friends, there is a reason Freddie's remains:  \n\nFreddie's makes a damn good sandwich.  It is not the most novel sandwich.  It is not a foodie adventure.  There are many fine sandwiches around but I'll tell you that this is my Desert Island place if I could only have one place because they do things right.  \n\nI was first exposed to Freddie's several years ago on Nob Hill.  Freddie's #2 was located on Pine Street, between Polk and Larkin.  They had the exact same menu.  The first several times I passed by I thought little of it.  Then I tried the Italian Combo.  I don't remember how I struck up the conversation exactly, but the proprietor recommended the Pepperoncini Spread on the sandwich.  From there, it was on like Donkey Kong.    At any rate, Freddie's #2 became Ti Ti Cafe (same menu, new owners, who I believe were former employees).  That lasted only so long.  Now the location is occupied by Cookie Love.  I am very sad that it is gone.  It had been a while.  Finally, I decided to venture over to the OG Freddie's in North Beach which dates way back.  \n\nThis is a stout sandwich.  They slice the meat to order and put a lot of meat on your sandwich.  The fixings seem to work just right.  The bread is delicious.  I'd love to tell you what makes this place special, but I feel very confident in telling you that they just have the mojo, vibe or quintessence that is intangible.  The echoes of a 90 year-old shop live on.  It's no frills, you have to go out of your way, and they aren't open late.  I have literally gone out of my way to grab a sandwich to take home for dinner.  So good.  \n\nHere are some things to note:\n\n1.  The Italian Combo.  This is the signature sub.  They would recommend it on Soft Sourdough.  It's Salame, Ham, Cotto, Pressed Ham and Cheese.  I always go with regular fixings, no mustard or pickles, add oil and vinegar and the vaunted Pepperoncini Spread.  Oddly, this is the cheapest sandwich.\n2.  The Bread.  All of the bread is delicious.  They have multiple versions of Sourdough, as well as Wheat, and Dutch Crunch.  BTW - If you are not a SF-ista, you may not know what Dutch Crunch is.  Check out the Wikipedia article.  It's great bread.  The bread at Freddie's is an attraction unto itself.  I will say that the Semi-Hard Sourdough is a bit chewy, but it is SO tasty.\n3.  They slice it fresh to order.  They have a full selection of great deli meats.  They can make them hot or cold.  I have a hard time going with anything other than the Italian Combo, but there are so many others.  The sandwiches are meat driven.  No cutesy sandwiches.  \n4.  Spreads.  The have Pepperoncini (mild), Jalepeno (hot) and a terrific Garlic Spread.  Delicious.\n5.  The Size.  They have Small 6\", Large 8\", Half Loaf 12\" and Whole Loaf \"24 Inch.  A Half Loaf is a heck of a Sandwich.    \n6.  Old School Factor.  You can't emphasize this enough.  This is one of those great old school places that simply are not going to be duplicated.  You think a winning formula can never die.  What I'm about to say is sad but true:  It will.  Great old school places always cease to be what they used to be.  I urge you not to miss out on this one.  \n\nTruly, this is one of my favorite places in San Francisco.  I wish that #2 was still a block away, but that ship sailed.  If you haven't been to Freddie's, go soon.  It is a terrific spot and one I will go to at least every other week for as long as I remain in SF.", "author": "Adam S."}

There's something great about family-owned eateries with a lot of heart and local flair. Freddie's is one of those.\n\nIn what looks from the outside like a small convenience store are perhaps the best sandwiches in North Beach. That being said, though, they're still not worth going out of your way for.\n\nThe best part of Freddie's is the incredible number of fresh breads they offer. Want dutch crunch? You got it. Like onion rolls? Bingo? How about sourdough? They've got three varieties for you. You can get your sandwich your way and enjoy it on some great, hearty bread.\n\nThe condiments for the sandwiches are also solid. The cheeses aren't soggy, the veggies are fresh, and the spreads are pungent and flavorful. If you don't like heat, I would still recommend you go with the pepperoncini spread. For the spice fiends: jalapeno spread. It's worth adding on to your sandwich (at no additional cost).\n\nUnfortunately, I find the meats a bit lacking in Freddie's Sandwiches. They're just somewhat standard deli offerings. Sure, there may be some fancier-sounding Italian offerings, but they're still not excellent. A good Italian combo has high-quality meats, often cured in-house. Mine here mostly just tasted like over-hydrated ham. Perhaps the pastrami would be a better option.\n\nThere are better places to dine in North Beach/Telegraph Hill, but if you're particularly feeling like a sandwich, this is a good place to go.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

Everything was fresh, they put in a lot of Turkey and the bread nice and soft. It was also cut in half and wrapped separately which I really liked as I often only eat half and save the rest for later so it made things a little easier for me. The only disappointment was that I asked for it to be toasted and it wasn't.\n\nThe Sandwiches are in varying sizes from 6 inch all the way to 25 inches which are a very reasonable $24 and they also have a few baked goods (Muffins, Cookies and Baklava). They don't have tables to eat your food at but they do have a few plastic chairs stacked outside that you can sit at if you mind eating off of your lap.\n\n*NOTE* Had I got my Sandwich toasted like I asked and an apology for giving my order to someone else this would have been closer to a 4 star review.", "author": "Emmalouise B."}

This establishment has been open for 89 years and counting... Eddie took over the place over 30 years ago and has been running the counter and taking orders since then. He always has a friendly demeanor and is a pleasure to speak with. \n\nThere are specials available to the kids attending Francisco Middle School across the street. When they hear the final bell releasing them from the grind of a hard day of school, (ahhh... the good ol' days without a bill in your name) they come running over and line up to get their after school fix.\n\nThere are over 25 different sandwich combos for you to choose from. Last count I think there are 9 different breads including and not limited to sour dough, wheat oat and soft rolls to the best sweet dutch crunch this side of the Mission as well as sliced breads as well. \n\nThere are plenty of cheese options available as well from cheddar to pepper-jack and don't forget the spreads! Garlic, Pepperoncini and the spreads of all spreads... The Jalapeno spread, it's a must have! Even if it's a light slathering... \n\nEddie also stocks egg, tuna and carrot and raisin salads pre packed and ready to go as well as plenty of drinks, chips and candy so this place is a true definition of a one stop shop. \n\n***Office catering or family outing tip***\n\nIf you are in a crunch for a quick place to feed an army.. Okay maybe a lunch meeting, order a whole loaf sandwich and have Eddie and the ladies cut it into triangles! You will be surprised how filling and what a value it is. \n\nSnag a loaf and hop on a boat to Alcatraz and have a picnic that is fit for a king. \n\nKeep up the great work gang! We truly appreciate you all and this jewel of a sandwich shop. See ya soon!", "author": "Josh H."}

The reason was that it's freakin' delicious, that's why.  After our little adventure at the Ferry Building, Emmalouise and I were ready for lunch.  Emmalouise isn't picky so she let me decide.  I then allowed Yelp to navigate us here...\n\nA small little sandwich joint about a 5 minute walk from Pier 39 that seems to be a convenience store as well.  No seating indoors but there are chairs outside so you can sit and use your lap as a table.  Unfortunately, I ate standing up because I was feeding the little one and I had to chase after him from time to time.  He's young and I can't imagine being in the stroller for hours so I let him be free during the duration of our meal.  \n\nThe guy at the counter isn't much of a customer service-y type of person and the wait for the sandwiches about 10 minutes (if toasted), more if there is a crowd however, if you want your sandwich cold then it'll be slightly shorter.  One thing I will note is that you should memorize what you order because they don't call your name when your sandwich is ready, they call out what you order.  Poor Emmalouise's sandwich got cold because some lady grabbed her sandwich even though the type of bread she ordered wasn't whole wheat... she held onto that thing for over 5 minutes.  The guy at the counter switched the sandwich after realizing the lady's dumb mistake but I did not hear him apologize to Emmalouise.\n\nI ordered the small (6\") corned beef, no tomatoes, no cheese on Dutch Crunch (can't have it any other way).  The bread was toasted just right w/ a slight crunch at first then deconstructed in my mouth awesomely.  The corned beef was sliced thinly and evenly but boy did they pile it up.  I loved it!  I'm a carnivore... the more meat, the better!  The lettuce was crisp and fresh and I love the mustard that eventually got into my hair.  What I love most was that the sandwich came out already cut and wrapped separately so for those trying to eat sensibly, this hella works!\n\n\nThe sandwich was great and I enjoyed our San Francisco trip together.  \n\nI was FULL afterwards even though I only had half of it.  It was because Emmalouise baked and gave me some of the brownies (triple chocolate, yo).  It was moist, chewy, chocolaty, and delicious.  I'm trying to talk her into having her own baking business and/or have a bake date.", "author": "Tram N."}

It goes far beyond some boring-ass deli sandwich, hold the meat.  There's also a falafel option.\n\nA tip for my girls who is always on diets:  the small (6\") sandwich is just the right size for keister control.\n\nTo the adventurous eater posse:  there's herbs in the mustard that add a delicious brightness to your sammy.  There's also a freshly-baked sweet onion roll bread option, and you can add jalape\u00f1o or mild pepper spreads, garlic spread or even cranberry sauce to any sandwich. And of course, there's a wide variety of Italian cured meats.\n\nWord up to children of the 70's and 80's:  they serve carrot and raisin salad.  No, I don't want to eat it!

If their sandwich doesn't fill you up, I don't know what will. \n\nThe things about their sandwiches that I like a lot is that they're clean and easy to eat (Keep in mind, their hard sourdough is REALLY hard, if you're not a fan of hard crusted breads, then go with the semi-hard or even the soft). And by clean I mean you won't have that sandwich-tomato-mayo-mustard-meat-juice dripping all over the place like many other large sandwiches do. \n\nI recommend the Smoked Turkey on Semi-Hard Sourdough with everything and Garlic Spread (I omit mayo since I'm not a fan).\n\nAaaand if you like getting a light buzz with your sandwich, they also sell canned/bottled beers.\n\nCheers.", "author": "Vencenza S."}

But once I navigated through the complex menu, it was well worth it when I got my sandwich tidily wrapped up in halves. \n\nI ended up getting the small Italian combo on whole wheat roll. The wheat roll was soft, light, and had just the right consistency- not too hard but not stale either.

Didn't see all the positive reviews so I tried it with an open mind. First off, this is the kind of place I love to go to - local store, chill and friendly vibe, people seemed friendly and nice.\n\nGot the club on onion bread for me and a turkey on wheat roll for my wife. Both sandwiches were huge, stuffed to the gills with meat. The meat seemed fresh and the bread seemed pretty good; but both didn't wow me like it has others. There wasn't any special sauce or anything out of the ordinary; they didn't have any special meat from a hidden source or flown in from out of town anywhere; nor did the bread tasted like it was from a special bakery somewhere. It was two decent sandwiches made to fill you up. \n\nLater on I noticed they do have other types of spreads (garlic/jalapeno, etc) and many seemed to recommend the italian combo. I'll definitely try it next time. That reminds me, for someone who was going for the first time, the menu seemed a bit large and intimidating. And I even looked at the menu for a long time. \n\nWill try again when I'm in the area, hopefully I'll pick something better that might wow me.", "author": "Dom L."}

It's all about the bread!\n\nFew issues keep it out of 5-star territory:\n\nFirst, seating. Benches and plastic chairs outside. Small plastic \"coffee tables\" too, but no proper tables, and nowhere to sit inside. In that regard, I prefer Subway or Togo's.\n\nSecond, Menu. It's too complicated. Ask for a turkey sandwich, and he'll ask \"which kind?\". Look, I'm a simple guy. How about the TURKEY kind of turkey sandwich? (note to the uninitiated: the \"Deli Turkey\" is the cheapest).\n\nThird, when he asks \"Any cheese?\", it feels like an upsell, which I don't like. First time, I heard it as \"And the cheese?\"--as if the sandwich comes with cheese; the only decision being the kind I'd prefer (again, this is how Subway and Togo's work). But no, he's saying \"any cheese?\", which really means: \"That sandwich doesn't come with cheese (although some of our other sandwiches do); would you like to pay extra to get some?\". Some might see this as kind guidance to build the perfect sandwich; I see it as a way to get another 43 cents out of me. Look, you're the sandwich maker here, not me. If you think cheese is good on that sandwich, how about including it in the sandwich and adjusting the price accordingly? Can I please just get a yummy sandwich without doing a cost-benefit analysis?

Thankfully, due to my girlfriends past experience with Freddie's Sandwiches, I gave it a shot.\n\nThey did not let me down.\n\nThe minute you walk in, you see a great selection if sandwiches to order from. The notion of it being just any old deli was dismissed. It was a LEGIT deli store committed to it's Sandwiches. \n\nYou have the option of a small, medium, large sandwich or even a monster sized length. The small size itself is quite large despite it's \"small\" label.\n\n Various options of bread are available from my favorite Dutch crunch, to sourdough, French, soft sourdough, etc. You can choose from one of several meats and have the sandwich engineered to your own likings. \n\nFreddie's is a fantastic spot and reasonably priced. The only downside is there is no real dedicated eating area with only a bench out in front or setting up your own table from provided chairs and table. This is the only reason I couldn't rank it a 5 star spot. Maybe in the near future it'll be possible to install some sort of eating area or tables around the deli, but since it's North Beach it wouldn't hurt to walk to a nice area to eat.\n\nOverall, great taste, good prices, wide selection and located in s nice, chill area.

My sandwich order would be typically:\n\n25 cent salami\n10 cent cheese\n15 cent bread \n\nThen they would slice the meat, slice the cheese and the bread and hand it to you on the butcher paper and you would take it over to the table and build your sandwich.  Bread....with a spread of mustard and the Salami.  Wrap it up and bag it and take it to school!!  This was the place to get a sandwich back in the days.\n\nToday, sandwiches are made to your order.  They have fresh bread to chose from, various meats and cheese....of course the lettuce and tomatoes and pickles.  Large selection of drinks and it is only $5.00 and up for a sandwich.  The best part of the sandwich is that the bread comes in daily so it's nice and fresh.  \n\nI had the French Roll Salami Sandwich yesterday.  Fresh French Roll, nice and crunchy on the outside, nice and soft on the inside.  Lots of Salami with a touch of mustard and to top it off with a couple of slices of Pepper Jack Cheese.\n\nStill taste good as back in the days!!  Of course it's a little more than 50 cents.\n\nIf your visiting Pier 39 or in the area....you might want to drop by this place for a sandwich.", "author": "Alan L."}

He's like a sandwich Czar while the 3 ladies next to him are busy making the sandwiches.  I guess they taste good enough that regulars keep coming back. He greets them with a tone that tells you he knows them but unlike other small businesses, most of the regulars usually hang around and chat.  He doesn't have customers who do that.

So I settled to this North Beach Deli to fill up my empty tank, which is also close to my crib. \n\nThis deli is located right across the street from a middle school, but fortunately, the deli is off-limits for the youngsters during midday. The menu selection is pretty selective and standard like most delis. I was so hungry that I bought \"three\" sandwiches; all for me. Selfish, am I?\n\nMy first sandwich is a tuna salad on a wheat bread. My second was a Vegetarian with a Provolone cheese on a Dutch Crunch (Just the usual fillings with sprouts, cucumbers, avocado and cheese without the meat). And my final one is a Falafel sandwich (bunch of falafels halves with a scoop of Tahini and Tiboulli). My three sandwiches including a bottle of Lemonade Snapple totalled to $22.00. Cash is all they accept, but there is an ATM Machine inside with a fee charged. \n\nThe friendly lady that prepared my sandwiches saying that, \"you must have some hungry people?\"\n\nI replied, \"Yeah, me!\" \n\n(She looked at me shockingly)\n\nShe asked, \"Are you going to eat \"all three\" sandwiches?\"\n\nI replied hurriedly, \"You bet I am!\"\n\nI drove home quickly, locked the doors and ate and enjoyed all three sandwiches in one-hour. \n\n(You can tell I was extremely hungry).", "author": "Matt G."}

Freddie's sandwiches is a hidden gem.  I went to Francisco Middle school ('98-'01 )which was across the street from this sandwich shop.

The student discount were only for students who were enrolled at the school at the time.  \n\nWhat brought me to write this review was the sandwich I had earlier at Sourdough in San Jose.

They toasted the sandwich without her asking which she didn't mind. But it was a little too toasted which made the bread dry and the ham made it a bit too salty for her.\n\nIf you work near the Wharf and given the incredible lunch selection we have here, I'm pretty sure I'll come back here again.", "author": "Winnie A."}

The current proprietor has been here for more than a decade.  Its main clientele is the school across the street.  I hear that people who grew up in the neihgorhood and moved away still come back for their fixes.  I was curious enough and made the trek to this little corner store.  There's nothing fancy about this North Beach establishment and it does show its age.  I didn't seek out the traditional turkey or roast beef sandwich.  I went for the large Italian Combo ($8.50).  Although its a little pricer than Subway, but its a hundred times better.  Pound for pound, I think the amount of meat in it actually makes it a bargain and tastier than the $5 Subway.  I usually don't (or can't) consume a large sandwich at one sitting.  On this occasion, when I started, I couldn't stop and broke my own record.  This is not the best sandwich in the Bay Area, but its on my short list.", "author": "Jean T."}

I definitely love to read about those who use to come here during their middle school days at Francisco. My favorite memories and stories however, are those of my parents who both attended Francisco back in the 60s. And while they didn't know each other back in middle school, they both agree on this one simple fact: lunch at Freddies.  I'm glad to hear it has pretty much stayed the same over the years.  \n\nI love their Italian Combo, on both Dutch Crunch and Soft Sourdough.  I always get the whole loaf to share and it's great that you can chose from a variety of different breads instead of getting the same one just because you ordered a whole loaf.  For the best deal, get a whole loaf and mix up the breads.  \n\nSandwiches are huge and Freddies is very generous with their meats, and sides like shredded lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, etc.  I love adding jalapenos to my sandwiches for that extra zing.  I also have this little weird quick about my sandwiches from Freddies...buying a bag of chips and putting them inside my sandwich. The crunch is a great addition to the sandwich in my weird opinion. Give it a try next time =D  \n\nSimply said, Freddie's is one of the best local deli's in S.F.

Anyway.........the business was then sold to one of  the workers( I love these types of stories).  The worker then took over this business and made it to what it is today.......  A great deli in the North Beach district that still keeps the integrity and culture of Freddie's sandwiches.  This sandwich is not toasted nor does it have any fancy dressing on it.  I order my sandwich freddies way. It's a soft sour, mayo, mustard, your choice of meat and that's it.  This is as simple and as good as it gets.\n\nI use to go here for lunch when I went to middle school across the street.  They have a huge array of candies back then.  This use to be a place where you bought now and later, jolly ranchers, lemon heads, Alexander the grape..........all of those old school candies.

Lucky for him, I Yelp more than he does and was determined to find the place he kept raving about. I love me a good sandwich! I typed in \"sandwich with spreads\" and WALA, showed him a pic to see if it was the place he talked about and we went for lunch yesterday. :)\n\nLemme tell ya, this place was absolutely AMAZING. The sandwiches here are definitely out of this world! I got a small peppered turkey on sourdough sliced, no mayo, everything else on it, pepper jack cheese and jalape\u00f1o spread. SO DELICIOUS...I savored every bite and didn't leave a single crumb! \n\nYou can't eat inside, but no biggie. There are benches outside and chairs w/some small tables. I went around 1pm yesterday and this place was still poppin'. The staff here are friendly too. Even though this place gets busy, they don't take long to make a sandwich.

Didn't care for it as much since the first bite there was a HUGE turkey gamy smell. Tip: reheat in the toaster oven and the smell of the turkey will dissipate to make it more edible :)\n\nNow here's my regular ADULT price sandwich $6.95 - Mortadella & Hot Coppa served on the same bread as above - 4 layers of Mortadella, 4 layers of Hot Coppa (they FORGOT to remove the NON-EDIBLE CASING on every slice, so how can you possibly expect me to give them 5 stars!!!) lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions, jalapeno spread with MOZZARELLA Cheese (highly recommend) - MY CREATION was YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM after removing all the casing myself; definitely taste the hot spice from the Coppa & Jalapeno spread (not suitable for kids / peeps that cannot handle their spice :P) heheeeee....just sayin'", "author": "Katy N."}

Granted, the wait can be a pain the ass sometimes, but it's definitely worth it for a sandwich from Freddie's. Simply put, this deli is, by far, the best sandwich shop in the the city (this coming from a guy who absolutely loves his sammies and has been to most, if not all, of the delis spread throughout San Francisco). My usual order, as I'm sure is the case for most frequenters, is the Italian Combo; their signature sammie. They're incredibly generous with the meat cuts, and the breads used are very fresh and extremely flavorful. The jalape\u00f1o spread, in my humble opinion, is a must; adding that extra little dimension of flavor which causes an orgasmic explosion of taste within your mouth as you bite into it; fucking mind-blowing. Freddie's sandwiches make life seem absolutely trouble-free during those fifteen heavenly minutes in which you and your sandwich get completely lost in your own little euphoric world.", "author": "Bryan H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-02-06", "description": "An outstanding sandwich shop for the past 25+ years I've been a customer.  I think it should almost be an institution in San Francisco, it's so good.  The freshness and simplicity of the sandwich are the key factors.   The soft sourdough bread hasn't been replicated elsewhere to my knowledge.  The perfectly cut meats are delectable.  The minimal construction of bread, mustard/mayo and meat lets one enjoy every facet of the sandwich.  The uncomplicated meal also lends itself well to saving as leftovers or re-heating.   What more can one ask for in a family-run eatery?", "author": "Michael W."}

Seriously, $5 for a small sandwich (which is actually not small at all) is easily the best lunch deal in the area. The sweet dutch roll is perfect and doesn't cut the roof of you mouth like virtually every piece of stale bread at Molinari's. Sure they have good meat, but they need to walk over to Freddie's to see what a real sandwich is...", "author": "Nicolas H."}

Boy, do I ever miss those days...\n\nSandwiches are now about half as large and not quite as tasty as in those days but still very good.

I really can't say it's the best I've had because I usually like my sandwiches toasty and hot.  This place brings back memories.  Growing up in North Beach, I went to Francisco Middle School, which is literally right next to this place.  I remember coming here for a sandwich when we werent' suppose to leave campus, but I couldn't resist getting one of their sandwiches for lunch!\n\nAnd of course while I was preggers, I craved for a good sandwich and I actually walked (more like waddled) all the way there from fidi to get one.

Well, after 8 years of those crummy sammies, today I did find Freddies, and I'll never eat another janky Safeway sammie again.  \nThe bread selection is fresh and good.  The meats and cheese, also high-quality and fresh tasting.  They have a great selection of drinks as Kettle chips..not to mention a delicious italian cole slaw that could stand alone as a high end salad!   \nWhat else could I ask for except to rewind 8 years of my life, and do it all over again.. with my Freddies.", "author": "G.

My biggest complaint about the place is the wait. Last time I went in, I had to wait 20 minutes for my sandwich, and another customer who came in 15 minutes after me got her sandwich before me. I use to frequent it more but 20 minutes is often 15 minutes too long....", "author": "Hoppie B."}

So on the days that I feel like eating it's great to know that Freddies is a short 3 blocks away. I usually go for the large Italian Combo on Rye with no mayo, avacado, toasted and with provolone. I generally save the second half for later. My advice is to call in before you leave because it usually takes about ten minutes. I believe they toast the bread on a panini press. Eat the first half on bench outside with a beer and save the second half for later.", "author": "Steve Q."}

Just take it down to the water and enjoy your damn lunch!\nAnd what's this about the owner not being friendly? Eddie (owner of Freddie's) is as nice a guy as you can meet.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-26", "description": "I love this place. Totally not pretentious. Just a good, old fashioned neighborhood sandwich shop and it doesn't pretend to be anything else but that. No skimping on the meats and a nice selection of breads.  The Italian combo is the best deal and one small will feed two easily. At first I was a little wary about ordering the garlic spread, but then I found out it was mixed with parsley which helps to counteract the \"garlic breath\". It adds that little special something, that other sandwich places would probably charge $2 for. The jalape\u00f1o spread is good, too, when you're in that spicy mood. It is sometimes a bit of a wait, but the trick is to just call your order in. Enjoy.", "author": "Lucie F."}
