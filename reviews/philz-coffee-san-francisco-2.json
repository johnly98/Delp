There are several locations around the city and one really close to our Airbnb in the Castro. My boyfriend and I stopped in while wandering around the neighborhood. I ordered the mint mojito and he got an iced Mocha Tesora. Each had different ways to customize them including the level of sweetness and creaminess. We both ordered them as-is and sat down to people watch while our drinks were being made. The girl at the counter taking orders and making drinks was really nice and patient which made for a great first experience. The menu is a bit overwhelming as it's pretty large and there's a lot of info there to take in.\n\nWe got our drinks fairly quickly and let me tell you\u00a0-\u00a0they were amazing. The mint mojito sounded so strange to me but it was creamy, minty, and refreshing without being overly sweet. It was super cooling and perfect for the warm afternoon. The Mocha Tesora was like the best hot chocolate you've ever had - it seriously tasted like a melted chocolate bar with a bit of coffee. These aren't serious coffee drinks but they are really fun for a special treat. They also offer (of course) plenty of coffee and tea options.", "author": "Katy C."}

I will be back for a mint mojito coffee soon even though it sounds like something I will not like because that is what everyone else ordered and they all had enormous smiles on their faces. And it was packed! The line was long but moved quickly.\n\nI love the way you order at Philz because you go right up to your own personal barista, explain to them what you would like, and then you walk over to the cashier and pay. Somehow this seems like the best possible way because you know your barista will understand what you want rather than a potential miscommunication with the person taking your order that might not also be making your coffee.\n\nThe coffee shop was packed and there was nowhere to sit if I had wanted to sit down, but thankfully I was on the go! The flavor of the iced coffee was great! Strong and refreshing - you could really get the notes from the beans they use. They had yummy looking treats, toasts, etc. at the front as well if you are looking for something to eat.", "author": "Bri T."}

And of course the Mint Mojito and kouign is a must try!! The mint mojito is an iced coffee with crushed mint in it and topped with a mint leaf.  Such a refreshing drink and the mint is not too over powering - you can still taste the nice strong flavor of the coffee. The kouign was really nice and flakey and it was even better that they offered to have it heated up. Great place for a quick pick me up!", "author": "Paula C."}

Yes, my review was in dire need of updating since my original review was referring to the location on 18th and Sanchez when it was next to the laundromat. Funny how I thought $2.50 for a Large was quite pricey back then. A decade later, it's up the block on Castro looking all modern and cookie-cutter like the rest of the Philz chain. I don't mind the change or the relocation since this block of Castro is relatively quiet even on the weekends. Enter and the purple unicorn and rainbow decor touches tell you that you're in the Castro.\n\nThere's a community table up front and a counter with seats as well, but most people like to hang out on the bench against the side wall where all the little cafe tables are (photo: http://bit.ly/2pMiIN5). Most of the time I've ordered a now $4.50 Large Silken Splendor with its mellow flavor mix of dark cocoa, nuts and butter with just a hint of milk. And a $2.50 Chocolate Chip Cookie with Coconut was an impulsive purchase for a lifetime on the thighs (photo: http://bit.ly/2oosOma). However, Jamie W. and I turned our own corner on our most recent visit.\n\nHe ordered a Philz Iced Tea, while I went for the Herbal Mint Tea with real mint leaves thrown in for good measure (photo: http://bit.ly/2pcsMlV). No sweeteners, no milk, not even a cookie. We were so good it hurt as we watched others devour pastries with abandon. They'll be sorry someday...if there is a God. Anyhow, I like this newish location and only wish there was a bit more seating space just to hang for a while. The Castro has changed quite a bit over the years and not necessarily for the better, but I like seeing the rainbow regalia in here to remind me what a great 'hood it could truly be.\n\nCOFFEE/TEA - 4 stars...still a grand cup of coffee and also a satisfying cuppa tea\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...Castro casual, only wish it was more spacious\nSERVICE - 4 stars...they know what they're doing here\nTOTAL - 4 stars...just around the corner and up the street", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-02", "description": "This is one of my favorite Philz Coffee locations. It's still got that neighborhood vibe like the Mission one and not too crowded. Newer ones like the Front St or downtown ones have a more polished, commercial, and less soul. The Castro one has a little bit of flavor decorated with rainbow chalk drawing, plush My Little Pony dolls, Harvey Milk poster lining the waiting area. The line hasn't been too crazy unless it's a weekend mid morning right before lunch time. Like the other Philz, you wait in line, go up the next open barista to place your order, then exit the line to the cashier to check out and go back to wait until your coffee is called.\n\nA modest and small interior, I mostly grab it to go but it's comfy enough and possible to hang out. There are a few small tables with a long bench in the ordering area, some working tables close the front, and outdoor seating. Toast, pastries from Starter bakery, yogurt, and granola for quick bites.\n\nAh yes, but what really makes it is the coffee, which is consistent across all locations. Philz is what made me realize drip coffee could be good and distinctly flavorful. So strong, but so great and flavorful. The baristas add cream and sugar for you (not self serve) so you can't calibrate it yourself but if you tell them how you want it (light, medium, heavy) they err on the conservative side and can adjust.\n\nMy favorites:\nPhiltered Soul - Rich and chocolately, hazelnut flavor. My favorite of the Philz, I get this as a special treat.\nJacob's Wonderbar - Dark roast, nutty, full-bodied, it's my daily morning coffee at my office.\nTesora - Mild, slightly acidic, a neutral crowd pleaser.\nPhilharmonic - Fruity medium roast, slight cardamom but not overwhelming.\nMint Mojito Iced Coffee - Refreshing, cool, slightly sweet and creamy.

My friend wanted to grab a cup of coffee and suggested Starbucks, I suggested we go to Philz as I was craving a Gingersnap Iced coffee. It was empty apart from a few lingering customers endlessly typing on their laptops. I greeted my friend then made my way to the ordering area and waited patiently for either of the two employees to greet me and call me over. Let me state that I was the only person waiting in line and the only person standing in the middle of the room so I highly doubt they could've missed me. One of the employees was a young girl with whitish highlights and the other was a tall dark haired guy. \n\nAt first I thought they might be busy finishing other people's drinks, but after a good five minutes it dawned on me that they were avoiding directing their sight towards me. A girl with a ponytail stood by the restroom and was witnessing me waiting patiently. She kept looking at me and back at the two employees behind the counter. \n\nI finally decided to sit down to join my friend. When the girl got out of the restroom, she made her way behind the counter. Oh, so she works there! Instead of alerting her fellow coworkers to attend me, she followed suit and ignored me as well even though she also saw I was clearly waiting to be attended. As I continued talking to my friend, one of the employees drops off a coffee to a gentleman working on his laptop a few feet away from my friend and I. Nice! I'm glad he got to enjoy his coffee. None of the employees approached me to ask me I still wanted to order. Sure, I could've gone up to them, but it's their responsibility as employees to provide customers with the proper attention they expect to receive when making a purchase. Next thing I know, the girl with the ponytail makes her way towards our table and tells us they're closing in ten minutes. \n\nI work at a restaurant and no matter what, I give customers the proper attention they deserve even if it towards the end of my shift and I just want to get out of there. I'm absolutely shocked that I was treated this way, more so when the guy next to me got his coffee. I highly doubt it required two people to make it and don't understand why I couldn't be attended. \n\nSo...! I walked out of there without my iced coffee I was oh so eagerly craving and a sour mood.

After listening to what other patrons were ordering, it seemed like this mint mojito coffee was the must have, so I followed in their footsteps and ordered myself a small cup to go.\n\nI like that there aren't a ton of options to choose from and they stick by the ones they offer. When you order, you place your request directly with your barista and proceed to a register to pay your bill. Super easy and really streamlined. Plus, it gives you a chance to converse with your coffee person before settling on a specific blend or beverage. After talking through my cup of mint magic, I went with soy and saw him stick a huge amount of mint into a cup that he was preparing. Didn't see that coming.\n\nWhen I got my drink, I was surprised when the cold versions still end up in a hot cup. That's okay, still tasted amazing. Just as everyone had proclaimed before me, it's super refreshing and a fantastic caffeinated drink to have on a warm day. When it's cold, I'm sure the hot version is just as delightful and I'll have to consider that when I make my way back to these parts from another coffee outing with friends!\n\nThey're really proud of their neighborhood and the locals that come in. You'll see a ton of peeps studying, working or just perusing social sites on their laptops, but I really love the community photos placed all over the walls.

So for this reason, I am bumping my two stars to three and hope that Philz remain true to their mission which says:  \n\n---- \"Our Mission is to better people's day. We take this seriously and believe we have a very important job. Customers take time out of their day to visit us; this is very valuable to us and we are humbled by it. This gives us the opportunity to make a positive impact on our customer's day. We do this by serving an amazing cup of coffee and delivering really great customer service. When this happens, our hope is that customers leave the Philz experience happier. We believe happy people are contagious, and the more happy people in the world the happier the world is. While we may not be able to make the world happy at once, we are determined to do it one community, one cup at a time.\"", "author": "Edwin R."}

(http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wwsTBKSWhtE2rc1alEkyJA) for introducing me to Philz Coffee in San Francisco.  I'm no coffee connoisseur, but I can tell this place serves some great coffee.  Not only that, but the service is phenomenal.  I was originally going to rate this shop four stars, but Jerry's outstanding service bumped it up to five.\n\nPhilz Coffee has over a dozen locations in the Bay Area including one at Facebook's headquarters.  The original Philz Coffee location is in the Mission.  This location in the Castro is, oddly enough, connected to a laundromat.\n\nEach cup at Philz is individually hand-prepared using hot water and coffee that's filtered directly into each cup.  The coffee at this small chain is the result of many years of research by Phil himself.  At the Castro location, I counted six dark roasts, eight medium roasts, four light roasts, and five decaf coffee blends on the menu.  There are also other caffeinated beverages and tea (e.g. black, green, chamomile, etc.).  The coffee cups come in two sizes: small ($3) and large ($4).  You can also buy a pound of bagged coffee for $16.\n\nThere are a multitude of coffee variations.  Fortunately, the menu is easy to read.  The blends have creative, sometimes funky names, but the descriptions are spot on, so I'd start there (at the descriptions).  If you're still having trouble deciding on what cup of coffee to get, the workers are very good at asking you questions to find your personal preferences/tastes and then recommending you an appropriate coffee.\n\nI was recommended the SwissWater Peru, the flavors of which are described as cedar, earthy, and smoky.  It fit the bill and was enjoyable and refreshing.  I was happy.\n\nAt one point, someone in our party accidentally burnt themselves with spilt coffee.  Jerry came over and offered some burn cream/ointment, the same one the employees use.  That was really nice of him.\n\nPhilz is a small, hippie coffee shop with very limited seating inside and out.  I estimate there's only enough seating inside for 10 people, maybe less outside on the sidewalk patio.  Free Wi-Fi is available.  The coffee shop shares a restroom with the attached laundromat.  If you want to use the restroom, you have to pick up a plastic flower watering can that looks like an elephant.  The restroom key is attached to it.  It's funny and awkward, which is the point.\n\nSo, many thanks to Jerry and roommate Matthew (I hope I didn't get them mixed up) for being such cool and friendly hosts and welcoming us into the shop.", "author": "Daniel B."}

(Late post: 06/07/15)\n\nI'd like to add though, over my shoulder, a snooty stranger, wannabe coffee drinker, blurted out that light brew has more caffeine.  Apparently he hasn't done his homework.\n\nCommon Misconception:\n\nLight Roasted coffee has more/less caffeine than Dark Roasted coffee.\n\nThere are a couple of dueling misconceptions about light roasted coffee concerning the caffeine content. Coffee drinkers weened on the specialty coffee of the 1970's and the famous oily black beans of the era, tend to believe that Dark Roasted coffee packs more punch. Indeed it may from a perspective of pure intensity, but that doesn't mean it carries more caffeine. Then there are those who have come of age in the Third Wave of coffee and are happy to report that in fact Light Roasted coffee has more caffeine since dark roasting burns out all the go-juice. The truth is, however, that the caffeine content in one coffee \"bean\" is the same no matter if it is Light or Dark roasted. The difference in caffeine content comes from the volume of coffee used when brewing. Light Roasted beans are SMALLER than their Dark Roasted counterparts because their cellular fibers haven't been blown apart and expanded. So if you measure your coffee using a scoop, then yes, you're getting more caffeine when you used a Light Roast because more beans can fit in that scoop. However, if you weigh your coffee (like most coffee pros) the caffeine content should be the same.", "author": "Mia Z."}

I got served an ice cold burrito one time!! Lol. They were mortified and offered me free pastries.   I didn't want to write about this but they keep dropping the ball every time after this!  Lately the mint in the mint mojito looks bruised and dirty.  One barista took a handful of tiny, bruised mint leaves and threw them in my coffee, instead of using a sprig.  The problem with this is every sip I took I was picking mint out of my teeth.  He also forgot to put sugar in the coffee.  I've also been noticing a ton of flies and fruit flies lately.   I loved\nPhilz when I first started going there but lately they keep dropping the ball and turning off my appetite!\nI don't think this is a problem with individual associates.

I work in the same block where the old location was and it was quite convenient and neighborly to stop by and head to work in an instant. I had the worst customer service on a mid-weekday when I walked in to this place. The new place is designed like a techie heaven (like not all the places cater to their appetite all over SF nowadays) \nLaptop size tables that look like work stations with tons of outlets and hubs. Charging cables are dominating the entire floor already...\nBack to my story, I proceeded to order at this ginormous marble bar, there was one guy in front of me, he ordered something else at the cashier all the way at the end of the cafe. I waited, waited and waited. The hipster baristas were singing and dancing on the Kelly Rowland song \"when love takes over\" and talking about guys as if they are doing something back there. I asked the cashier girl which she was eating cookies and I waited for her to swallow her bite so I can ask a question. How does \"ordering\" work here? She said go back at the coffee bar and wait for them until they are ready to take your order! FML. I am in a total dilemma whether I should leave or not. All of a sudden the hipster queen Asian barista yells \"get in line, Sirrrrrr!\" I am in fucking line, obviously I am the head of the line since people are lining up behind me but you don't stop singing and dancing to notice a customer! I explained the situation and he scolded \"what do you want?\" As if I have done something wrong. 12 minutes of shock and disbelief for a cup of coffee? Where did you get these people from, the owner of Philz? What happened to those nice baristas you have in all other locations who say hi to people and they take great care of everyone? Save yourselves some attitude and go to Reveille Coffee instead where they will welcome anyone with genuine attention and care.", "author": "Emre T."}

I ordered the Mint Mojito Coffee (it does not actually have alcohol) from a very friendly barista.\n\nI really enjoyed the coffee! The mint was fresh and added wonderful flavour to the sweet, creamy coffee.

It's slightly hidden, which makes it a tad bit more special.\n\nWhat I love about this specific location is that every single barista here is SUPER duper nice and just makes your day a lot better. I'm not much of a morning person, but every single time I walk in here, the baristas are always slinging the sweet nectar of Earth. \n\nI always get the Philtered Soul - some people swear by Ambrosia.

It also happens to be about 3 blocks from my church, so this is the coffee shop i go to occasionally on Sunday mornings before service to read, reflect, have a great cup of coffee, and puppy watch all of the dogs in the area on their morning strolls. \n\nLike all Philz, you go to the barista bar, request what you want and then shift over to the casier and pay. This isn't the biggest Philz in town, so lines can get blurred and sometimes you don't know where to go and stand without misleading the next customer into thinking you are ordering and paying when you actually are just waiting for your drink to be done.

But and I got the Tesoro Mocha drink, because I like chocolate and sweets in my coffee cus I'm into that stuff. The drink is different than Starbucks or any typical coffee you would but at a cafe. It will have a strong taste if coffee, so if that's your tijng, definitely come here. I'm more of a sweet coffee kind of person so I would probably prefer a mocha drink at Starbucks because it is sweeter, but thats just me. Other than that, it seemed like a really chili place to talk about life or do some schoolwork. I would  recommend Philz if you like drinks that actually taste like coffee.", "author": "Bryant D."}

Being an aficionado of coffee and everything free, I had to trek out of my comfort zone in Pac Hts and to one of the many Philz's locations to utilize the gift card. I decided at random to go to the one in Castro. \n\nI walked in to the Castro location yesterday and took a look at the menu. Despite being busy accommodating a couple of patrons before me, a cute male barista noticed me and said he will be right with me. I was already liking this place. I asked whether they had any blended coffee as I wasn't used to their drink monikers and couldn't tell what was what. The said cute male barista kindly asked how I liked my coffee. I told him sweet, chocolatey sweet. He offered to make me an iced mocha, medium sweet. I said ok. \n\nWhen it was time to pay, I realized I left the gift card in my other bag. Grrr... So I had to pay with cash. But the iced mocha was so damn good, I didn't really care that I paid $3.50 for it. In LA, I would've paid close to $5 for non-starbucks coffee that was this good anyways. One sip of the drink and I was hit with a wave of inexplicable happiness. I loved how he even put a couple of mint leaves to complement the chocolatey flavor. Mmmm.

Ordered an Istanbul Cream Tea with Mint Leaves! Their menu was quite extensive & their coffee's looked really lovely. I'd like to try them sometime. What I liked about Philz Coffee was how happy every customer seemed with their Drinks. Everyone seemed pleasantly surprised and left with a bit of spark in their eye which a nice change of pace from the likes of Starbucks & Peet's. Philz seems more like a place you want to have coffee and sit down with someone and have a nice conversation or read a book or do some writing. It feels more about taking time out to enjoy every sip and not rush in and out. Their pastries are self serve and in a case of their own which was great too!

The way they brew the coffee here make for a really strong cup but they use manufacturing cream to cut the acidity. \n\nManufacturing cream has higher fat content than whipping cream so it's like drinking a melted milkshake. If that's what you're in the mood for then it's great but if you want coffee that is good without adding things to it I suggest blue bottle or ritual. Also If you're looking for an awesome iced coffee don't get it at Philz unless you want the top of your mouth to feel like you just ate a stick of butter.

In my first year, I heavily ingested large quantities of Starbucks.  Starbucks, however, always tastes watered down to me, and there is a very assembly-line quality to it.  Don't get me wrong, I know several who prefer Starbucks, so I don't want to be libelous, but it's never quite worked out for me.\n\nIn my second year of law school, I switched to Peet's Coffee.  This is certainly a step up in my mind, as it was tastier, smoother and altogether a better cup of joe.  Still, it, like Starbucks, lacks any sense of individuality, as I again felt as though every cup I had was subject to a wide variety of flavors, consistencies and/or quality.  If I ever needed a quick jolt, I'd go here.\n\nIn my third year of law school, I discovered Blue Bottle! What a rush.  It certainly does the job to get you hammered, so I give it credit for that.  However, as law school has dwindled down, my dependence on coffee has given way to a deeper appreciation for the habit that is coffee drinking.  More often than not, I now prefer coffee for the experience, more than for the rush.  Though enjoyable, I find that Blue Bottle cannot provide me a genuine, relaxed happiness in this manner, and on a consistent basis.  Alas, I moved on.\n\nThen I discovered Philz.  Now I had heard of Philz, quite often actually, for years before I finally tried it.  I can safely say now that I drive out of my way to get a cup on almost a daily basis.  The rest of the reviews in this section touch on way this is so:\n\n1.  They will make your coffee individually, filtered only for you, and they will ice the coffee as you prefer.\n2.  They ask you how much creme and sweetener you want, and are consistent with these additions EVERY SINGLE TIME (cough, ahem, Starbucks fail).\n3.  They ask you to taste your coffee before taking it, so as to make sure that you are 100% satisfied.\n4.  They put a mint leaf in the coffee for ambiance, as well as taste. \n\nI am never, ever disappointed with Philz.  Ever.\n\nI highly suggest the #3 Philharmonic, Iced, Medium/Medium Sweet.  it is a good, relaxed, lighter coffee.  I only wish Philz had a frequent buyer card.

Each cup is brewed individually and the staff is super knowledgeable about all of the options.  I've had the Tesora and the Silken Splendor, both of which were delicious.  Philz is even a favorite for my roommate, who usually despises coffee but is obsessed with the mint mojito iced coffee.\n\nI'd suggest taking the coffee to go as it is usually packed and has limited seating.  The separate lines for ordering and paying can also get a big chaotic.  They don't have an espresso machine and may make you feel a little stupid for asking for a latte.  \n\nPhilz really is the best coffee in SF.", "author": "Lauren R."}

I still like it.  I get a: \"I want to jump on a trampoline and save the world!\" kinda coffee high when I order this.  Not sure if that's a good/bad thing though lol.  \n\nTo those who compare this place to other coffee stops such as Blue Bottle or Ritual, don't.  It's like comparing apples to oranges.  Or an Italian Pastry Shop to an Asian Pastry Shop, they're just different.  \n\nWhat I also like is that there are several locations throughout the city:  Van Ness, Mission, and the Ball Park.  Always only a couple minutes away once you're in SF....but parking at all of them is tough.  Make sure you have quarters to pay the parking meters if it's before 6pm.

Lucky bastards.\n\nHe ordered the Philharmonic for both of us and yes it was an orchestra of flavor.   (Sorry, I had to.)   Strong dark coffee, sweet sugar and cardamom... one of my favorite spices ever... all lovingly prepared by hand.   I was instantly head over heels. \n\nMy cranberry bread with rosemary was unique enough that I had to try it but left something to be desired.  Moist in some spots and a little dry and crumbly in others.   Not their fault.. it is an outside bakery that makes it.. but just as an FYI.  YMMV.  \n\nThe organic mini donuts were cute, and a \"quesadilla\" breakfast tart of cornbread crust and sweetened cheese filling was also intriguing so maybe I'll give one of those a go next time. \n\nTiny little place and yes, there's a chaotic ordering system but the end result is worth it.

It is only slightly more pricey than a daily grind-o-starbucks coffee (2.75 for a small) but you will taste starbucks after this and want to scrape it off your tongue!\n\nStaff is very nice and helpful. Pastries are kept in a glass case that has door so flies won't get in. Nice detail, and something that annoys me greatly is flies on food, so they win there too. All pastries were reasonably priced (2.00 each, 1.00 for \"vintage\" or day-old), and looked good, but we went for the scones which were very good, especially dipped in the wonderful coffee. I had \"vintage\" both days, and since they are freshly delivered every day, one day does not really make too much of a difference, tasted fine to me!\n\nGo. Just go. \nYou will not be dissappointed. \nThey will not let you be disappointed. \nThey even ask you to taste your coffee right when they give it to you, just to get your OK on it. If it's not to your liking, they will work to make sure you are happy, and you will be.\n\nParking was available easily both days we went there (weekdays before 12 noon), and seating, although limited, was available both days too, since most people who came in, buy their coffee and then go walking away with it instead of sitting.", "author": "Shindy P."}

Philz is a real coffee lover's coffee, and has a ton of options for anyone to find a favorite and become a regular.  Just make sure you've had a good look at the big board menu and are ready to order by the time you're at the counter, because the staff tends to get a bit...testy...if you don't move quickly.  And then be prepared to wait a bit for your coffee. The Tesora Mocha and the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee are our top choices.\n\nOur opinions differ with regards to the donuts.  Philz has a decent selection of pastries off to the side of the ordering counter, including a few (unlabeled) flavors of donuts.  We picked up a bunch of them for the road, and while one of us thought they were great, the other was unimpressed.

That's right, ALL I WANT TO DO IS BUY MY BEANS.  There is no organization to the patrons in regards to ordering/paying, and the coffee makers are so focused on making coffee, they become oblivious to the fact that not everyone is in there in order to purchase a cup of coffee to go.  Would a salutation or greeting kill you?  This is a local business, make people want to support you.\n\nThe register is never attended, leaving me unsure as to what line I should stand in, without other people thinking I'm cutting in front of them.  Instead, I'm left in purgatory, unsure as to where to stand, and have to listen to you all behind the counter tell your patrons they are ruining their coffee when they order Splenda.

Finally I just went for it and asked the un-intimidating cashier what he would recommend.\n\nHe asked me what roast I usually prefer.  I said medium.  He suggested the Tesora, the house blend, but then asked if I like cardamom.  I do not.  So I got a Tesora, black.  He asked me if I wanted mint in it.  What?  Did I hear right?  \"yeah, it's kinda our thing\"  \"oh!  okay sure!\"  Down for everybody's unique \"thing\".  Saw the other guy pinch off some fresh mint and got a little excited and nervous.\n\nTurned out to be amazing.  Loved the warmth of Tesora on a winter's day roaming the streets of the Castro.  The mint was very subtle but definitely there.  And being wired for 7+ hours?  Can't beat that.  Can the one in Berkeley open already?", "author": "Lydia W."}

The first was downtown somewhere, and I have to say...both were very consistent with their coffee and service.\n\nThe one in the Castro was much smaller to the one downtown of course, but they were just as friendly and comfortable to talk to. And the coffee of course.... smooth and toasty. I always order the Tesora, medium sweet, and I'm always satisfied with it.\n\nIt's a little pricier than a regular cup of coffee, for sure, but it's a nice indulgence every so often.

We were looking for a place to relax during a morning of exploring on foot, and after reading the reviews of this place, I had to try the mint mojito. It was as good as advertised! Creamy and refreshing, flavored not with some industrial green syrup, but with copious sprigs of fresh mint leaves! It's counterintuitive but delicious - the kind of drink that only a real coffee genius would dream up, and that only a shop totally committed to quality could execute properly. Hint: don't try drinking it with a straw - it needs to be sipped through the ice for full appreciation. \n\nMy BF is a fan of dark roasts, but he's trying to stay away from caffeine - so he was excited by the decaf options at Philz.  He tried the decaf French and Ethiopian roasts on the two trips we made here - he reported both were excellent, and tasted nothing like decaf. I tried a sip of the Ethiopian - smoky and complex, great flavor. \n\nA word on seating: limited.

My neighbor had recommended it, so when recently walking by I decided to give it a try. My \"mistake\" was to ask for a latte. The barista literally turned to another employee and laughed at me. I s%!t you not. Then, the barista says: \"Sorry, you can't have a latte.\" So there I stand, gobsmacked, feeling like an a$$, with no idea why. The barista goes on and mumbles something about making something better than a latte, blah blah blah, which is what I hear because they've already lost me, and my embarrassment turns to anger as I realize this is one of those places where things are done \"differently\" and if you don't know the secret handshake it's an opportunity for you to be made fun of.\n\nWhile waiting for whatever it was I ordered, I looked around for something that could have warned me ahead of time, like a poster for n00bs or some other sort of indication that I deserved the ridicule and should have known what I was doing ahead of time. I didn't see anything, although I did see that lattes weren't on their menu board, but honestly I don't remember the last time I looked at a coffee shop's menu before I ordered. Regardless, I'm not sure I would have done it differently anyway, as my hope would have been that my asking for a latte would indicate I was a new customer, and I'd be informed of the situation in a respectful way, possibly with the goal of selling me on the benefits that the Philz difference has over other local coffee shops.\n\nUnfortunately, left to my own, my take away was that the Philz difference was something to stay away from.", "author": "Tad W."}

You still get specialised, high-quality coffee (and that \"Toto, I don't think we're in Starbucks anymore\" type of feeling), but with much less of a snobby/intimidating vibe than the other places. I won't name names, but I'm sure other San Franciscans can think of the places to which I am alluding. \n\nI've only been to this branch, but if I were to visit any others, this would still be my top choice because I've become quite attached to it; I don't go multiple times a week, like a certain caffeine-fiend friend of mine, but the baristas always treat me as warmly as if I were a regular- no matter how busy the line. This is the perfect \"home base\" to wind down after a crazy day (but do remember that the shop closes at 8:30) or to take a breather before some Castro-centred high jinks. What makes it even more homelike is that you can even plan mundane tasks around this place - stop by after shopping down the street, or load your clothes at the laundromat next door and pop back into Philz for some coffee and homework/project time/online-bill-paying/blogging/life-planning/existential ruminations.\n\nHowever, seating is limited, so unless you are doing laundry next door or need the outlets to charge your cell phone/laptop/other electronic device, you might want to consider taking the coffee (or tea) to Dolores Park a few blocks down. The weather is usually good enough in the Mission-Castro (Mastro?) to sit outside, you get an amazing view of the city with your amazing drink, and there will be free seats at Philz for people who need it!

It was an overcast Sunday morning and my mother was talking on the telephone to a lifelong family friend who lived a couple of miles down the road from us. This being my mother and her friend talking, well, I knew that they'd be talking forever. At least, it seemed that way to me at the tender young age of 8.\n\nAs my mother was talking on the phone, I smelled the familiar smells of freshly brewing coffee wafting from room to room. I'd always appreciated coffees unique aroma, but alas, each time I tried to have a cup my mother would interfere, saying things like \"You wouldn't like it\" or \"It's not for children, Adam.\" Not this time though. This time was different. I deftly picked up the cup she had set down earlier and had my first sip.\n\n12 years after that, when I was about 20 years old, I had finally hit rock bottom. I had gone from drinking just 1 cup of coffee daily to guzzling down 3 or 4 cups an hour. I'd have to drink one cup after the other to even feel sober. It got to the point where I'd shoplift Folgers Instant Coffee and snort it in the back alley. My arms are still pockmarked and scarred from injecting pure Guatemala Huehuetenango, back when my supplier could still get it, at least. \n\nYou don't want to know how I paid for it.\n\nIt was after an all night Jamaican Blue Mountain binge that I awoke in an over-caffeinated stupor, right outside the door of Philz Coffee in The Castro. I went inside, took out my wallet and said \"Make me something that will make my head stop spinning.\" \n\nAnd they did. \n\nEver since that day, the only coffee I've been putting in my  body has been from Philz Coffee shops and I'm never going back to how it was. This is the best, well made cup of coffee my world has ever known. Even though it isn't consistently flavored, it is consistently the best, and that's the most important thing.", "author": "Adam M."}

I have ruined another shirt!\n\nAlthough this problem could easily be solved by asking for room for cream and then not adding the cream, no. Just...no.\n\nThe first time I went to Philz, I ordered a coffee and, as usual, insisted on no additives. Unlike usual, the barista seemed truly hurt by this. I think Philz takes as much pride in blending cream, sugar, and other spices with coffee as I take in not doing that shit.\n\nThe black coffee was tasty.

Since then I have been back almost every day, including weekends. Sometimes I even come twice. I drive all the way from my home to the 24th location and then double back to work in the morning so that I can get my Philz fix.

I am partial to the \"So Good\" coffee, which more than lives up to its name. Coffee is served with a sprig of mint, which smooths the acidity and adds to the overall deliciousness. \n\nAlso, they have huge samples of pastry and this weekend there were trays of free baklava both days.

As I noted in the other review, the barista does make a difference even if the coffee making system is essentially the same but it's the small things that separate good from great. \n\nIf Phil's son is working at 18th that day, you can expect a pretty solid cup but for example, I got an iced coffee the other day, served by a woman, which was surprisingly bad. Usually, they make the coffee hot, sugar and cream it, THEN pour it over ice. She sugared the coffee cold and as you might imagine, the sugar all fell to the bottom so that the top sips were bitter and the end of the cup was far too sweet.

I get the cream and sugar (they do have Splenda for those of you who are into that) and end up with a sweet, frothy cup of some of the strongest coffee I've had, so strong it may be perhaps a worthy \"stepdown\" for any of the circuit boys in the neighborhood looking for ways to wean off \"Tina\" but still feel perky.\r\n\r\nI've tried a number of the brews they offer, and wanted to add a  special mention to the \"Philharmonic Wow\" as I noticed that a sprinkling of herbs was added to the grounds.  I asked what the herbs were and was told that they were the \"wow.\"  Well, OK! They did add a nice enhanced flavor to the brew, as does the fresh mint sprig topped on the cup at the end (just don't look at the sprig later as the heat wilts it away). \r\n\r\nThe ambience of the small shop, while a major step up from when this location was a pathetic \"Royal Ground\" for a month, is still a little uneven.   There are a number of comfy couches, though not a lot of tables.  The music is all right, but repeats after an hour.  And they should really turn off the two fluorescent lamps in the back corner.

If you go in and just speak your mind - \"I am in a light and happy mood and just need a little caffeine to top of my day\" - the experts who man the counter will find a coffee for you. And ask if you like it, and I have witnessed them make a different coffee if what they have served up isn't to the taster's liking.\n\nI don't think it's expensive for the quality of coffee, excellent service, individually brewed and a lovely piece of fresh organic mint on top.

The store is typical of a coffee shop in San Francisco with a hippie hipster feel. The corner the store sits on provides some good people watching in a busy part of the Mission. The staff is friendly and wants to ensure that your coffee is too your liking requesting that you take a sip before leaving their station. All this attention does have a downfall, in that it is not a grab and go type of place, and often the ordering can be a little hectic. The coffee is not the cheapest either, but sometimes you got to treat yourself and I imagine is comparable to a \"gourmet\" chain like $tarbucks. But if you really enjoy coffee and have some time to kill it is a great place.\n\nThe food ranges form breakfast burritos, scones, muffins and the like. The guy  preparing the food when I happened to go there a few times is not look the cleanest, but then again it is Sam Francisco so what  else is new. I will say that the original location is much less pretentious than the Berkley location and has a better vibe, but both locations make an excellent cup o' joe.", "author": "m p."}

Only down side is you get a little attitude sometimes when your new and don't know what or how or order if there is any line at all, but not always, I am at 50% of my visits on this, but not any worse than StarBucks for saying the order or temperature, size and drink out of order and their  coffee sucks on top of it so I will only deal with any attitude for something this good.

Phil himself was there and he made our drinks even more amazing than I can remember. I told her she'd be awake till thursday. She tasted the Philharmonic without the mint leaf at first, then Phil demanded she give it back and then he poured 'love', literally, into her coffee then he dropped the mint leaf into it and she tasted again.

Phil used to be a kind of nice guy, although he never really fit in with the neighborhood and the fag culture around here -- I mean he is not the type who's gonna be singing with the drag queens as far as I have seen.  For a couple years I used to get coffee from him in his old location at Sanchez just because he's not a chain (and the only reason he gets one star in this review is because he is NOT NOT NOT McStarbucks, where no self-respecting San Franciscan should buy their coffee).\n\nAlas, since Phil moved up the street things have gotten totally gross.  The place is always filled with straight people with attitude these days and the whole stumping-for-Gavin thing Phil did was totally bizarre.  What business does a local coffee shop have signing on to an uncontested mayoral campaign?  Weird.  And now he has a little certificate from the mayor in posted on his wall.  I mean come on.\n\nA few specific problems:\n\n1) The staff are rude and out of it, and too busy to chitchat or pay attention to you.\n\n2) Pastries are foul and taste like vegetable oil.\n\n3) Sources of the coffee are not identified.  Fair trade?  Organic?  Forget it at Philz!  Seriously, this guy gets all these props for his 40 unique blends but he doesn't tell us where the coffee is from or who farmed it.  These days, I want to know that my coffee isn't laden with pesticides or the blood of serfs to some global corporation.\n\n3) Too many straight people for the Castro.  Gay people don't get to be the majority in much of the world -- can't we at least have gay coffeeshops in the one neighborhood we can call our own???\n\nPhil, you need to hire more homo cuties and queerdos, you need to identify the sources of your coffee, and more than anything else, you need to be nice to people.\n\nEveryone else ... try Spike's on 19th Street.

Their coffee is expensive per cup but it's handmade and so freakin' delicious. The beans smell and taste amazing if you make coffee at home. I love the mismatched chairs and tables and how laidback it is, the line moves fast if you're waiting to order and get your coffee. The servers are really nice and friendly so if they're making anything fancy for you make sure to tip well. I like the Philharmonic and the Greater Alarm if you need to kickstart your day through coffee.  The Arabic coffee is good too.

A large selection of coffee for me to choose, so it can satisfy my curiosity! Service is very friendly. \n\nThe bad: \nI went there in a Sat afternoon, my friends and I were the only customers when we got there, and it took us more than 10 mins for 4 drinks. Its not because of \"one cup at a time\"; it's simply because there were only one guy working on that afternoon, and after we got there, couple customers came after, and he was trying to help them at the same time, and he mass up the order and we ended up waiting a long time. \nInconsistency: thats right! Their coffee \"bean\" may be consistently good quality, but a good cup of coffee also has other elements, such as sugar and cream, which Philz likes to put for us, and this is the problem. Even they asked me before they put the sugar and cream, I still got different taste each time from Philz, because its actually really hard to measure for us what is \"light sugar\" and what is \"light cream\". I also feel sad for my friends, it was her first time, and she doesnt have good experience. She ordered 2 ice coffee, and they tasted completely different, one is perfect, and one is super sweet.  \n\nconclusion: \nI probably will go try couple more times, but I have to say my sanctification drops every time after I go.", "author": "Kevin T."}

Not knowing anything about Philz the first time I wondered in I asked for an espresso, as this is not an option at Philz the barista was very nice about explaining what they're all about: They specialize in blends (not single origins beans) and brew each cup to serve. As a black coffee fan I tried a small cup of one of the darker roasts. After it brews the barista tosses the liquid from cup to cup to aerate it and get the temperature down a bit, I don't know how much this ultimately does, but it was a great tasting coffee. Even though I don't like milk or sugar in my coffee after tasting Abby's I realized that cream and sugar are the way to go at Philz. They adjust the sugar exactly to your liking, stir in some hand shaken cream, and top it off with a fresh spring of mint. I know its got to be bad for you, but its freaking delicious.

For example - Starbucks?  Its crap.  Seriously, the coffee itself is not quality enough to charge what they do but sometimes you need a double shot espresso in a jiffy and that's the only place around.  Where was I?  So I checked out Philz yesterday and I'm not gonna lie, I walked in with full judgmental guard up.  I hate trying something after too many people have told me, \"you gotta try it, you'll love it\"  ... sets the expectations way too high.  Anyhow, the hottie behind the counter must've picked up on my simmering bitchiness and could not have melted me faster with his charming smooth talk.   Jacob?  you're absolutely yum-licious.  Anyhow, he whipped up a fantastic cup of something and there it was, I became a believer.  Now, I don't think I'll ever wake up at \"3am dreaming about our coffee\" like the cute boy promised but I certainly will take another lazy-day stroll down there for their solid coffee.  Oh and p.s., if you're sensitive to caffeine, be careful here ... I am utterly immune and by that I mean, i can follow a 6-pack of red bull with a nap which I recognize is odd ... but this cup at Philz had me more than a tad jittery and saying to my friend, \"um, i need to eat now ... i think I'm having a seizure.\"  Do with that what you will.

The folks working there are equally great. When I told them it was my first time, they slowly explained all the steps involved in preparation  and helped me pick out the perfect blend.

I've tried several times in the last few weeks -- hot coffees, iced coffees, dark blends, light. While I do like the independent neighborhood feel of the place (and free Wifi) they just don't understand what \"very little\" or a \"tiny bit\" of cream means. Part of the whole gimick (I mean experience) of Philz is that they blend your cup of coffee to order so you don't have much control over how much sugar and/or cream you get.  Yesterday I said \"just a tiny bit of cream, no sugar.\" As I watched the employee make my drink, I cringed when I saw her put in --I swear -- probably 1/3 cup of cream. The result: warm creamy coffee-like beverage. I'm also over their whole pretentious mixing of the coffee: water in, then take the cup it flowed into and pour it into another and back and forth. It literally takes at least 5 minutes to get a cup of coffee there.", "author": "Mark V."}

Upon hearing such a statement, and due to the fact that I need to have my peets every morning, I decided to try it out (hence I was already biased towards peets...). Anyhow, getting there, it was cool that they make your coffee personally (i.e. grind, filter etc etc). Knowing that all this hard work goes into a cup of coffee is great, you feel like you're an A-list celebrity. Logistically it does not make sense whatsoever (yes the coffee is good, but when you want your cup right away, would you want to spend 40minutes waiting for them to make it for all of the other customers before you get yours???). Anyhow, we were the few who entered so such a predicament did not happen. Getting to the coffee. It was good, mine was actually too sweet, but it sufficed (i ordered mine with cream and sugar). (it almost reminded me of the days when i couldn't handle legit coffee, and I would go to Cumberland farms and get incredibly super sweet/fake cappuccinos from the machine).

I'm not a coffee snob, but I've been to Ritual Roasters and other similarly popular places, and Philz beats them hands down.\n\nThe baristas at Philz also work really hard to satisfy their customers. They take their time and give lots of TLC to each beverage.\n\nWhy did I only give them 3 stars? Because while they all do a superb job, some of the baristas there have a serious *attitude* problem.\n\nI happen to really like iced coffee, and while they have many delicious coffee blends, only one of them is pre-made in iced form. I tried it and it was wonderful, so when I went back I asked if I could get one of the other blends iced. The barista said that I could but it would take a bit longer. I said that was fine. So while the guy was making my iced coffee I got a lengthy reprimand about how inconvenient it was for him to make iced coffee beverages per customer, and how much longer people would have to wait if everybody ordered one. The next time I went there I ordered another blend on ice, and I got the same kind of flack from a different barista. When she was done she gave me a dirty look and said sarcastically, \"I told you it would take a long time.\" Frankly I didn't mind the wait, as I'm a firm believer in the old maxim that \"quality takes time.\" What I did mind was the extra sass that I got on the side.\n\nIMHO if it's inconvenient for them to serve other blends on ice then they should just charge more money or say that they don't offer that service. Making your customers feel guilty for ordering a time-consuming beverage is a crappy way to do business.\n\n3 stars out of 5 for good coffee with a bad attitude.", "author": "Jay L."}
