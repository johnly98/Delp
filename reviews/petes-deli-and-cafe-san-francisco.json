I got the regular breakfast burrito (eggs, cheese, sausage) which hit the spot, and my dad ordered the 2 egg breakfast. Delish diner food and some of the best home fries my Dad has ever eaten (his words)!

I had stopped patronizing this deli because this man would ignore me; I asked a male co-worker to come with me to see if things changed in regards to service, sure enough things were different and the HSM suddenly acknowledged me. Crappy, huh? I gave the HSM the benefit of the doubt and started going here on my own and things were ok. HSM never smiles, but whatever I was being acknowledged. Today, I go in to replay my winning lotto ticket, he says \"Winning ticket?\" Me: \"Yes.\" I place it on the counter, he's counting dollar bills out of the tip jar, and counting, and counting, and taking more out and counting. I'm thinking \"you've got to be kidding me, HSM!\" One of the cooks comes over and hands him a wrapped sandwich: lemon chicken. He takes the sandwich and for the next 30 seconds tries to get the attention of a woman by the door ignoring HIM! Payback I guess, but it doesn't satisfy me because I'm not dishing it out - grrr. So I say \"She's obviously ignoring you, can you help me?\" But he doesn't. She finally looks up and says, \"No, I ordered a  burger.\" So I figure, ok HSM is going to help me now...but he doesn't. He starts putting the lemon chicken in a bag very slowly, selecting a napkin very slowy...and at that point I just can't anymore, so I slam my hand on the counter and grab my lotto ticket and leave. You know? If you don't want my business, guess what? Success! I'm not stepping foot in your deli ever again and I will tell as many of my UCSF co-workers to boycott you as well, you rude Heavy Set Man!\nPS: I went to the store on the corner of Sutter and Pierce got my lotto tickets and some baklava!", "author": "yoshi w."}

But the past few times I've been here has been shitty service. This morning I ordered through Eat 24 while I was on the way to work @ 6:45am. Through the app, Pete's has a pre-order system so I said to myself \"why not\" & ordered myself some breakfast because I, & a lot of other people, don't have the time to make myself some in the morning. So I get a text from eat 24 saying that they open at 7am so give them 15-30 mins to prep my food. I was completely okay with it. I head out of my department to get some coffee first then head to Pete's so I can get there around 7:30am. The moment the man working the cashier gets to me, he tries to give me shit for ordering at 6:45am when they have a pre-order system set through Eat 24. He tells me \"so just to let you know that we open at 7am\". I'm like yeah I know that obviously. Then says \"if I get a call at 6:30 in the morning from yelp, I am not going to answer it.\" \"So remember, we open at 7am.\" Like oh fucking kay, I don't care at this point on what you tell me. Just give me my food because I obviously see that your staff has already made it & I came at the right time to pick it up too.

As a result of the time, we happened to see their closing procedures.  Let me tell you, the place may not look brand new or fancy in any way, but it is CLEAN.  They were going to town on the grill!  I would eat there again any time.\n\nHubby had the club, which he was very happy with, and I had the falafel plate, which I have to say was really unusually tasty.  The falafel has something different (in a good way) about it - extra sesame?  I don't know, but it was really fresh, the tabbuleh had everything in the right proportions, and the hummos wasn't overly garlicky.\n\nAlso, I know how annoying it is when someone walks in 15 minutes before closing but they were very gracious about it and really went above and beyond - my falafel was extremely crispy (to be honest, I was expecting it to be pre-done, but it was hot and fresh) and they toasted my husband's club to perfection.\n\nRecommended!", "author": "Amy L."}

He gives me my receipt, then my $4.03 change and then I go back and wait.  My meter was running so I was in a hurry.  I then get the sandwiches and ask for a bag, and then he asks me if I paid for them then I replied, \"Yes, you took my $20\".   He gives me the bag, and as I walk out he calls me back and says I never paid for them.\n\nKnowing my meter was running I said, \"If I have $4.03 in my pocket with a receipt, you owe me an apology, plus you should give me the sandwiches free.\"  People were watching and not only was it embarassing, I pulled out the receipt and the $4.03 chane (he gave me).

Most of their food is just about average and their prices are a little on the high side considering there's really nothing special or gourmet about their food.  They are really popular at lunch time and the place is pretty crowded most of the time.  I guess it's because their customers like the fact that the service is fast and friendly.    \n\nSo far, I've tried the following items: \n\nTurkey sandwich with cranberry sauce: Turkey is cold.  The soft roll is blah. There's not much on the sandwich but the cranberry sauce.  Not worth the price.  \n\nBreakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches:  These are pretty good.  You get your sandwich or burrito piping hot.  For both, you get your choice of ham, bacon or sausage and it comes with egg and cheese.  If you get the \"special breakfast burrito\" it comes with hashbrowned potatoes and salsa too, for about a dollar extra.  I think the sandwiches are more worth the price because the burritos are pretty small whether or not you get the regular or the special.\n\nMediterranean Plate: Comes with hummus, tabouleh, two medium size falafel, diced cucumber and tomatoes and a pita sliced into 4 wedges.  The taste of everything was fairly well seasoned and fresh.  I would say that this plate is worth the price (around $6 or $7) and is a good option for when you feel like having a light or vegetarian lunch.", "author": "Danielle O."}

They have THE BEST breakfast burritos in the city. Not too big, not too small with potatoes, eggs, cheese, and your choice of bacon, steak, or chorizo. I get it with chorizo every time. Ask for spicy and special too! Made to perfection every time. Another favorite of mine is their breakfast sandwich. Get it with bacon on an english muffin. I'm not normally a fan of american cheese, but in this sandwich, it has the perfect melted consistency and brings the b-fast sandwich together. I sometimes go here for lunch too. The tuna melt is made the right way by frying the tuna on the grill before sandwiching it between the bread and cheese. Also, their Reuben is delicious. They don't overstuff it, so it doesn't fall apart while you eat it. Perfect proportions of pastrami, sauerkraut, and thousand island. So good. Remember to bring cash since they don't accept card. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. My favorite place for a quick breakfast! :D", "author": "Gina I."}

If nothing else make a tasty turkey & cranberry sauce on a hard roll, but if you can manage that your other sandwiches will probably be good too.\n2. Open across the street from hospitals and doctors offices. People in healthcare are busy and like to be able to walk across the street and get a tasty sandwich.\n3. Have your sandwich people work fast. Busy people like doctors and nurses like it when they don't have to wait 30 minutes to get some meat and produce put between slices of bread. \n5.

Their breakfasts are large but nothing to write home about .  Go there for the cheese steak (!) during lunchtime and say hi to Pete- he's been there since 69 or something.  He's one percent guido-ish but 99% cool old guy.", "author": "yvette l."}

When we were looking for a place to eat, the surgical staff recommended Pete's.  Even though we were a bit anxious about my husbands surgery down the street, we felt comfortable, welcomed and appreciated as soon as we walked in the Deli.  Pete had just made the hummas and encouraged me to try it which I did.  We had the turkey burger, chicken pesto sandwich and the falafel sandwich.  They even warmed up the pita bread to go with the hummas.  Everything was great.  I didn't notice any cracked wheat in the tabouli so the majority of it was vegetables.  I knew everything was very fresh so it was really flavorful.  I enjoyed the coffee (I had the medium roast).  It wasn't bitter but still had a nice flavor.\nThe cafe was busy (about 1:30) but we were served quickly and the food looked good.\nIf I'm in that part of the city, I'll be sure to stop by again.", "author": "Diane G."}

King of Falafel happened to be closed today and so I was left wandering aimlessly looking for a meal and ended up at Pete's Deli & Cafe.\n\nThe first time I went to Pete's I tried the Reuben sandwich, and it was delicious.  This time around though I was looking for a healthy alternative that ideally didn't involve buckwheat, kale, or almond butter.  On a side note, sorry Cafe Gratitude if I just inadvertently put down your entire menu.  Pete's offered a grilled lemon chicken sandwich that I figured wouldn't be nearly as good as the Reuben but at least it would be healthy and didn't involve getting into the flax seed revolution.  I was expecting a simple chicken sandwich but was pleasantly surprised at how good the lemon chicken sandwich was at Pete's Deli & Cafe.   I ordered the sandwich without mayonnaise and it isn't necessary since the lemon gave the chicken a nice added flavorful.  It was a delicious thin piece of chicken spread out on a sourdough roll.  I was expecting some cheapo roll, maybe Safeway brand or something, but the roll at Pete's was really good.\n\nThe combo of the roll, lemon flavoring, and quality chicken made me a fan of the sandwich and at $5.99, I might just order it again next December 27th if King of Falafel is closed.", "author": "Josh K."}

The place is nothing fancy--your typical deli/greasy-ish spoon. Clean though. I had a totally edible eggs with bacon. The potatoes were a little too close to the pre-frozen variety, but all-in-all it was a decent meal. Not a destination meal, to be sure, but it certainly did the trick for the time and place.", "author": "Chris O."}

Gross gross gross.  Hey owner go eat at Art's Cafe on 9th ave if you want to see how a real meal is made.  Plus I got something so simple my 7 year old niece makes it at home.  A BLT, well mine came with NO Tomato????  UMMMMM that's not a BLT that's a BL. The bread was soggy the lettuce wilted and I got someone else's grilled cheese which was also not edible.

I went in there once to buy candy but didnt eat there because it just didnt look ummm friendly to eat at. Dont expect a nice place its really a mom and pop deli place/store. Anyways, I was not disappointed whatsoever. The sandwiches were made to order and they sell more then just sandwiches. It was really good, reasonably priced and service was cool. I defn eat there again. There was quite a variety that I had a hard time making a decision of what I wanted. They even sold beer there, hahaha. They only accept cash and line gets pretty long during lunch so try to avoid peak hours. Parking is hard in this area period.", "author": "J L."}

The chicken pesto sandwich is excellent, as is the hot roast beef sandwich and their tuna salad.  The turkey sandwiches always seemed a bit bland, so I gave up on those, but most everything else is solid.  Despite the small size of the \"kitchen\" (you can hardly call it that), Pete's has a very comprehensive menu for both breakfast and lunch.  The only thing that's not very good there is the coffee, and the seating/atmoshpere is strictly functional - I usually get my grub to go.", "author": "Green T."}
