My crew loaded up on their prepared foods and I got the coconut cold brew because apparently being an adult means you're exhausted if you get to bed after 9pm. The coffee was incredible and unique. The coconut flavor cake through heroically; not overpowering the coffee but shining bright like a diamond. It was just sweet enough and gave me the kick in the pants I needed to hike up to Bernal Heights Park. We stopped right as wen entered and split one of the burritos because my husband was hungover and crumpling like ball of foil and I had no excuse. The burrito was fantastic: all the ingredients tasted fresh and even though it was pre-made it wasn't soggy. We hiked a bit more and hit up the two salads we bought, curried chicken salad and Greek. The ingredients were so fresh, the greens were super flavorful and fresh, they both were really filling with lots of protein, bright flavors, and various textures. I was really impressed and can't wait to go back to hit on some of those baked goods.", "author": "Marcy H."}

I no longer go to the Starbucks nearby and come here instead for mainly two reasons: 1.  Starbucks does not carry sugar-free hazelnut syrup for coffees; I need to watch my sugar intake so I was super happy when I found out Martha's carries it.  2.  My Americano order comes to me steaming hot (how I like it!). Even after I add cream, I still have a hot cup of coffee, opposed to a warm cup like at Starbucks.  They must heat their water to a higher temperature or something.  They have an AWESOME selection of really great pastries and breads; I usually get the banana bread.

It's a smaller location, but still plenty of seating. Saw lots of people with their laptops; guess this is still a great place to come to! After glancing at the menu, I decided to try their Mate Latte, small size. For those who don't know what Mate is, Mate is a type of infused beverage that comes from the Yerba Mate plant in South America mixed with many other herbs, veggies, whatever you want! I really liked the Mate blend they use because it was the right amount of sweet and the essence of the Yerba Mate plant was there. My sister got the Frappe Latte which is an iced blended white chocolate espresso drink. You could definitely taste the espresso; at least it wasn't all sugar and no caffeine! Total was $7 for our drinks. Not bad for good quality.\n\nAt least I know where to find Mate drinks! I don't see it very much in other cafes or coffee shops so that's a plus for here!

(I'm sure it's frustrating, until you discover that you can sell your tiny house for $3 million and move anywhere you want.)\n\nGetting work done:  Probably the fastest wifi in the city and one of the few places for a secure connection.  Lots of plugs too; they're hidden but most tables have them.\n\nFinding a clean restroom not already occupied by a vagabond of questionable sobriety:  It's also hidden but quite a tranquil place for a pit stop.\n\nThe drip coffee tends toward the industrial side of the spectrum, the sort of drink that can be taken in quantity on a daily basis, rather than a fancy pour-over to be analyzed and discussed.  The blend on tap daily is \"Martha's Blend\", which has a unique, strong flavor, and is available in a variety of dry forms for brewing at home.  It's pretty much the only coffee I drink anymore.  Addictive taste and fairly easy on the stomach.\n\nThe pastry selection is unusually diverse, sourced from many local bakers, both large and small.  The best selections are the dessert breads (lemon, pumpkin chocolate chip, chocolate almond).  There is also a basket of gluten-free options that tends to sell out very quickly.\n\nAnd, yes, Martha is a real person.  Even though this is now something of a coffee dynasty with four locations, Martha still works at least one shift most weeks, though you'd never know she was the boss unless you'd seen pictures.

I will post pictures as well and you will see how severe was my burn.\n\nDetails of story:\nIt was 2013 January, I went to this store after work hoping to get some tea. There was a young women at the counter and young man towards the back. I ordered my tea, the woman filled the cup and put on the counter. Everything seems normal until this point. \n\nI reached over to get the overfilled cup that was LACKING a sleeve and a cap, only touched my hand to the sides of the cup and hop, the overheated water spilled all over my hand. I was able to shake of some of the liquid but the area that remained under my cardigan got severely burnt. I screamed with pain. The rest of the story is even more disturbing. The woman at the counter started laughing, looked at the man and said something, and he started laughing as well. THEY OFFERED NO HELP WHATSOEVER, THEY LAUGHED AT ME AND HUMILIATED ME. I asked them to call the owner of the shop, they did not. I HAD TO LEAVE CRYING. By the time I got to the nearest pharmacy, the area had been severely hurting, the skin had bubbled, the bubble had lifted off and popped. I was crying at the pharmacy, and they gave me some first aid stuff. AGAIN, PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THE SHOP DID NOTHING other than laugh at me. \n\nI returned to the coffee shop and asked for the owner's number, they gave me some number, I went out and called, it was the coffee shop itself and the nasty young man hung up on me. I returned once again, finally, the owner arrived. I told her the story. She was extremely sorry, offered me ice, told me I'll never see that guy again serving there (I have no idea what happened, because I never went back) She apologized over and over again. \n\nBut today I saw this story of the woman that got burnt at McDonald's, and remembered how nasty it was and how horrible and disgusting people's reaction was (making fun of me, not helping etc), so I decided to write here.\nhttp://ed.ted.com/featured/noVRnZ7N\n\nNobody deserves to be burnt by insanely hot liquids (it was served WAAAY hotter than I could even think of drinking) and nobody deserves to be humiliated because they're in pain. Those two losers did both of these things to me, and I was their customer. So I think this story deserves to be here. Like I said, I will also post pictures of the burn.\n\nA year later (and hundreds of dollars in burn and scar creams, my previously flawless wrist still has a scar and that area gets red every time I shower (thin skin- heat sensitivity problem).

And last time I checked preparation is pretty much exactly the same (cow or soy) for your latte.\n\nSo Stocking costs less, not more, and Preparation is a wash. The question is how much more Soy Milk costs for Starbucks mega-corp to buy. For us individuals, the best pricing I could find is around $5.00 per gallon. For comparable milk, $3.50. Let's say the Stocking costs are around 50 cents less per gallon for Soy. So there's a net $1 additional cost per gallon, spread over approximately 40 servings per gallon, or 2.5 cents extra. Starbucks charges 40 cents, or almost 94% margin.\n\nSo how about some truth from Starbucks - \"We charge extra for soy milk because we can. Its an option that healthy, more affluent people prefer.\"\n\nIts value-based pricing & has nothing to do with costs. Come clean about what you're doing - and profit without a guilty corporate conscience. Don't blame it on Procurement.\n\n\nFinally:\n\ni stand by my assertion that overall costs are less for serving soy vs. milk & that Starbucks is pricing due to what the market will bear and enjoys large margins on this \"soy tax\". I prefer not to think of my post as whining, though... :) it's a simple request for Starbucks to be honest and not come up with fake reasons for the surcharge. let's just call a spade a spade...\n\nby your logic they should introduce different pricing schemes for non-fat, 2% and whole milk since each of these requires different containers and approaches.", "author": "A.

When I went to receive my coffee I noticed that it surely was not the smallest size, it was in fact a size larger...This size being the standard smallest that you would find at other coffee shops.  When I asked if this was in fact the smallest size, the barista lady responded with \"we're phasing out the smallest size, this is the new small, so that's what I charged you for.\"  As she said this to me she showed me the smallest size cup that I was expecting...There were plenty of those cups to go around.  And did she apologize for her mistake and offer a reimbursement?  No, she didn't.  Great service would have been offering an apology for the mistake and a reimbursement for the size I did not want to pay for.  Great service would have been paying what I wanted to pay, but getting the cup she prepared.  And great service would have certainly been abiding by what was currently written on the menu of available sizes, not by what WILL be happening...If that was in fact true.\n\nNo apology, nothing...Just moving on.  I know it's a matter of dollars and cents, but it is a matter and one that matters to me.\n\nI was so excited to have found a cute coffee spot within walking distance of my new home...But now I'm just turned off.  I'll walk a little further for the service I'm accustomed to.  \n\nThey do have quite an assortment of pastries...But they are definitely nothing to chat about.

Peets is a consistently good cup as well. The other thing I really like Martha's for is their espresso drinks. Having spent many a year being a barista back in the day when it was not such a glam job by any means, I feel as tho finding a well-made, properly frothed, unscalded latte is impossible anymore. Lattes these days seem to be a cup of scalded steamed milk and a shot of weak espresso. Awful. But Martha's lattes are half milk and half foam, NOT SCALDED, with really strong espresso shots. Mmmm.\nOne thing I did hear, however, from an ex-fan of Martha's, is that they are pouring whole milk into the half and half containers on the counter. She said she saw it happen consistently. That's pretty darn cheap and snakey if you ask me. However, still the best cup of coffee and latte you can find in the city.\nOh, and excellent staff. Fast and efficient.

I walked right past, catching the faint smell of coffee, and made it all of ten feet beyond the property line before my senses kicked in and turned me back around.  Inside wasn't crowded at all (in fact there was no line at all).  Staff was helpful in helping me figure out what I needed.\n\nI had their mochalatte with an extra shot (this is a blended drink with ice).  Unlike most places that just blend the extra shot in, they poured the extra shot in with the top 1/4 of the drink.  It also looks like the chocolate they're using is Ghiardelli, which is one step shy of crack cocaine for an addict like myself.\n\nThe result of this subtle difference over the green-aproned competition is remarkable: you get a drink that goes from bitter to sweet as you drink it (and as the dark espresso flows down through the frozen drink), literally good to the last drop and amazing for a drive out of the city on a hot day.\n\nSadly, as I live further down the bay in San Carlos, I probably won't get back here as often as I like -- but since my partner has a regular appointment in this area...it may mean one more good reason to take the drive in to \"be nice\".", "author": "Dan M."}

Show up at eight and you'll find a little slice of Noe Valley seated on  the outdoor benches facing 24th Street.  Some people read the paper, some chat, and some just smile and soak up the morning sun while gazing southbound towards the San Bruno Mountains as their eyes convey a state of of blissful trance. Around nine things get crowded, and the bench area gets log-jammed with cantankerous codgers, doting parents, rambunctious toddlers,  and bagel-stealing dogs. Patrons run from young to old, and political views range from that of old-guard Socialists to Rush-quoting Reaganites.  Diverse opinions coexist peacefully for the most part...but when arguments heat up, it's fun to sit back and watch the sparks fly.  After 10AM or so the morning crowd moves out, but lunchtime brings a crowd of retirees and the conversation rages anew...\r\n\r\nStandard issue pastries and muffins grace the indoor counter, and pre-made sandwiches make for a quick snack. Bagels and egg-based sandwiches are available just two doors down.  The coffee is a pleasant compromise between the watery blandness of Starbucks and the overpowering might of Peet's.  The creme-and-sugar stations is oddly located, but well stocked and rarely if ever runs out of half-and-half.
