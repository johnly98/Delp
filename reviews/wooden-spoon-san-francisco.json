Like any great brunch spot if you come on a weekend expect at least an hour wait. My friends and I tried coming on a Sunday and we ended up leaving because of the wait. So I randomly came by myself on a weekday morning, and it was so quiet I had to first ask if they were opened. \n\nI sat at their marbled bar and ordered their smoothie bowl. Smoothie bowls are the new craze. And honestly they're simple but delicious and light. I love their vibrant colors and various healthy toppings, but for their smoothie bowl I feel like it needed a bit more smoothie.

I can never quite get them right at home; the smoked tomatoes, thick-cut bacon and more importantly the biscuit instead of a traditional English muffin really helped put this benedict over the top for me. The potatoes that accompanied the benedict were crispy af, and that's something I almost never get so A+ there! As a finishing note to the meal, it comes with a small fruit bowl as well and it balances it out perfectly. Other members in my party also were satisfied with their food (morning bowl & huevos divorciados). \n\nThe prices weren't as outrageous as other places I've had in SD or LA; $14 for the Benedict and a base of $10 for the morning bowl with $3 add-ons for eggs, avo and bacon. \n\nParking around the area is hit-or-miss since it really just depends on your luck with st parking. I would advise going on a Sunday morning (~9am is when I went), parking around the area is superb. \n\nOne caveat is that their service can be a bit slowed once the brunch time really gets into full swing, took us an additional 15 min to get flag someone down to get our check once we were done.", "author": "Matthew L."}

The food is delicious, and the environment is very Instagram worthy.\" I mean at least the last part was true. \n\n-The wait is crazy. We arrived around 12:30pm, and were told someone would be right with us when they had time. My brother found the sign-in sheet, and independently did the host's job. By the time we waited for the host, we would've probably lost some major wait time. Flying in from New York and experiencing the superb customer service and Instagram worthiness of brunch spots, I asked the host if we should drop our cell phone number or if we'd receive a text, and to my dismay she said, \"We'll just come out and call you.\" Instead of making people wait outside bored out of their minds, maybe giving customers the freedom of roaming around the neighborhood and coming back when they receive some point of contact would make everyone's lives more efficient.\n\n-The food is alright. A-OK. There honestly wasn't much that impressed me. The food was just food that you eat for nourishment, and not really for enjoyment.\n\nEven though the food was lacking, what really lacked and left a bad taste in my mouth was the service and the waitstaff. We started off with my brother ordering a drink, and by the time our food arrived, the bartender asked if we needed anything else. Yes, the drink we ordered at the beginning, it'd be nice if we could get that. In particular, I felt very uncomfortable under the quizzical looks given from the Caucasian hostess. I caught her staring at me, and being the character I am, I looked back at her, and then she looked back wondering why I was doing the same as her. Maybe because of my age, but it felt like she was wondering what I was doing there. Regardless, it just left me with a bad impression of the Wooden Spoon.

We put our names on the waitlist, and right when we did, we were actually able to get seated right away! Of course, since it was the 2 of us, it was easier to seat us, but there were plenty of parties that were 2+ so the wait might be longer (but honestly, in SF, when ISN'T there a line/wait for brunch??) My friend got the hash, which was a great savory and hearty dish. I got the granola french toast, and a side of potatoes. The french toast was great, especially the whipped cream, since you can tell it was hand-whipped and had real vanilla in it! The potatoes were awesome, crispy on the outside and cooked perfectly on the inside. The potatoes came with a ranch-like dipping sauce which was equally as delicious.

They seemed fairly well attuned to healthy appetites who want to keep healthful. This restaurant comes from the MacNiven brothers, Dylan and Rowan, who previously opened the lobster roll haven of Woodhouse Fish Company, and their partner, chef August Schuchman, who had been running the kitchen at Woodhouse. They've come up with an all-day breakfast menu that they serve until 3PM which they supplemented with a smaller sandwich and salad selection at lunchtime. I was here for breakfast after my workout at the gym with my youthful trainer. Yes, I really worked out.\n\nEven though the House Hash and the Granola Crunch French Toast both looked tempting, I decided to go for the $10 Morning Bowl, a savory creation which combined quinoa and cauliflower rice with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, pickled carrots and red onions, arugula, and spinach (photo: http://bit.ly/2Myvla9). Quite healthy and delicious. Now I could have also gone for the $12 Blue Green Smoothie Bowl with algae, chia seeds, granola, and fresh fruit, or the $8 Granola with Greek yogurt and fresh berries. My point is that they provided gluten-free choices that went well beyond bacon, eggs, and pancakes, which they offered as well.\n\nI felt like something sweet, so I also ordered the $7 Mixed Berry Bowl which was a straightforward mix of fresh blueberries, blackberries, and cut strawberries (photo: http://bit.ly/2KISDZd). That was the perfect chaser to the Morning Bowl. Their $4 Drip Coffee comes from Sightglass, so it was most satisfying (photo: http://bit.ly/2OWFVt8). Izabella was a terrific server and she made my morning with her infectiously attentive manner.

I was tempted by several of the menu items but decided on: \n\nFRIED CHICKEN & BISCUIT (5/5) -- fried chicken thigh, black pepper-cheddar gravy $15: I did not find the gravy bland as another Yelper did; I found it super tasty, peppery and savory. Chicken thigh was boneless, cooked perfectly, and had to be at least 6 oz. Serious protein, nom nom! Breading was also excellent. Biscuit was spread with a tomato onion jam (?), I think, also very good, and biscuit itself was good. Came with plentiful dressed arugula greens and about a 1/4 cup steel ramekin filled with fresh strawberries and blueberries. I didn't try arugula (looked very fresh), but everything else was YUM. Two thumbs up!\n\nSTONE GROVE cocktail (5+ Bonus/5)-- gin, peaches, apricot jam & yogurt $10: REALLY good. Who knew gin would go so well with freaking yogurt? Maybe too good, if you know what I'm saying. Server asked if I would like another but I demurred as it was before 10 AM ;-) If possible, I'd say three thumbs up for this \"healthy\" breakfast cocktail. Served in highball glass and garnished with what appeared to be a dried apricot on top of ice cubes.\n\nDRIP COFFEE by Sightglass $4 (3/5): I think I've had Sightglass before, but not sure. I get all these fancy SF coffee brands mixed up, between Blue Bottle, Ritual, Four Barrel, Flywheel, etc., etc. I love coffee but this was too acidic for me. I added most of the cream I had and it was okay, but no great shakes. I left most of it behind in the cool diner-style mug. Cute creamer in shape of mini milk bottle with hemp tie around rim.\n\nSERVICE: Friendly, professional, thorough. \n\nTABLE: Clean, minimalist, no flowers this morning, brown paper napkin.\n\nOVERALL: Win, would return with husband and other hungry people.

The mimosa wasn't necessarily memorable, but I remember a decent balance of alcohol and juice.\n\nWe shared the French Toast, which was the highlight of brunch. The brioche was fluffy with just a bit of crunch on the edges, topped with a very light whipped cream. The cream was a delightful addition as it was just slightly sweet and very refreshing. I'm generally not a fan of whipped cream, so this took me by surprise. Dusted on top were toasted granola and fresh strawberries and blueberries. There's maple syrup on the side if you want things even sweeter.\n\nFor something savory, I had the Huevos Divorciados.

Not the right flavor profile at all. Underwhelmed. Sent back and then awkwardly had a person that never identified himself challenge us about what was wrong. Not a friendly \"hey! we're new, would you mind explaining what was off so we can fix it?\" Rather \"Hey. What was your problem with the spritzer?\" Uh. YOUR problem is that it was nasty. It was just barely fizzy water with lemon in it. Not a fizzy lemonade, not refreshing or appetizing. How does someone get a lemon water type beverage wrong? Not sure, but they succeeded at doing it.\n\n- Scone - gross. They said they were baked in-house but something off. Perhaps baked previously then rebaked or reheated. Too crumbly, slightly burnt taste, too dry. Also, they brought us the almond scone initially even though we ordered the lemon. No apology for that, just an eye roll.\n\n- Service weak - 20 minutes in and sill no utensils or napkins - even though starters and drinks served.\n\n- Benedict not good - watery because of tomato, couldn't taste hollandaise at all, bacon overcooked, biscuit mushy - would be better with a traditional English muffin. \n\n- French toast basic, soggy (but best thing we had)\n\n- Fried potatoes good\n\n- Fruit had little fruit bugs on it. Likely just not rinsed.\n\n- It was telling that they just brought us the check and didn't ask how anything was.\n\nOne and done.

The space initially seemed small, but the restaurant extended as we kept on being led further into the space. There is bar seating, and plenty of table seating. And the interior design is lovely! I can see this place being super popular. It was already semi-crowded for breakfast on a weekday, so was already pretty impressed.\n\nThey serve Sightglass coffee for a slightly steep price of $4. My friend and I split the Swedish society pancakes with huckleberries and a lemon, and the house hash with eggs, short ribs, potatoes, pickled vegetables, and mustard cream. The food was really good! I enjoyed the swedish society pancakes more. It was the perfect balance of sweet and savory. I also enjoyed the house hash and the mustard cream sauce was delicious! My only suggestion was to have the short ribs made a bit more tender. But overall, a really great breakfast and would def come back! And pricing was pretty reasonable apart from the coffee!", "author": "Jackie C."}

I ordered the eggs Benedict with a side of chicken apple sausage. The Benedict plate was a lot of food and well balanced with a side of arugula, potatoes, and fruit. I asked for a side of the mustard creme fraiche with the potatoes, as well. I highly recommend asking for that as it goes really well with the potatoes. My dislikes were that the English muffins weren't toasted and the hollandaise was a little too lemony. The chicken apple sausage is very, very good so if you like breakfast sausage - get it! The space itself is pretty small, very loud, and has little airflow so it was really warm inside. The adult beverages looked reasonably sized but I had the lemonade spritz which, at $5, was in a tall skinny glass with a lot of ice so it was roughly two drinks-worth and not worth it.", "author": "Alissa H."}

Once was on a date; he said this place would be his new go-to brunch in SF, and we hadn't even sat down yet! Shame it didn't work out, cause he's clearly got great taste.\n\nWooden Spoon is beauty and brains. A truly gorgeous space -- modern, fresh flowers everywhere, lots of light, impeccable yet minimalistic decoration. Airy and open and even when busy never feels crowded. \n\nThe experience is only enhanced by the food. Soft scrambled eggs were packed with large chunks of crab and was so smooth and tasty. Shared the French toast both times I was here, which is also divine -- crunchy, just the right amount of sweet. Cici T. in her review called me out for double fisting a regular coffee (Sightglass, yum) and a Irish coffee (appropriately boozy!), which I'd do again, and you should too.\n\nThe staff are all lovely, incredibly attentive, infinitely patient, and felt like friends at the end of the meal.\n\nOverall a great experience every time, and the reasonable price point ($$) and wait (20-30 min on a weekend) are the cherry on top. Get in here now though before it reaches Zazie-esque levels of fame (though IMO it has surpassed the former as the King of Brunch in SF) and the wait inevitably explodes.", "author": "Nami T."}

My bestie and I found Wooden Spoon on Yelp and after taking a look at the photos of their food, we decided this would be the place that we enjoyed brunch. We walked over, put our name on the list, and relaxed outside until our name was called. \n\nEventually we took a seat next to the window in their main dining area. It was bright, the window was open and there were little wooden kitchen utensils up on the wall. It was all very cute and inviting. Our server came over right away and we knew instantly that we needed mimosas. While he worked on the drinks, we explored the menu. Everything looked good but I settled on the Blue Green Smoothie Bowl and my friend ordered the Market St. Benedict with a side of sausage. We also agreed to split the pancake, you know... for dessert! My smoothie bowl was vegan and gluten free (score!) and included banana, pineapple, hemp seeds, and seasonal fruit. It was so freakin' fresh and colorful, I loved it! The flavors were strong but it wasn't too sweet at all. I would definitely get it again. Once I was done with the smoothie bowl I enjoyed a few bites of the pancakes. I didn't indulge too much but I can say that they were really fluffy and the syrup was a perfect pairing. They were certainly a dessert to the meal I had. \n\nMy friend and I really enjoyed our time here at the Wooden Spoon and if I lived nearby I could definitely see myself coming here more often.

This is a newly started San Francisco treasure that is quickly picking up in popularity and for good reasons too!\n\nFirst off the decor in the place is very tasteful. Modern and simple. Open and inviting. Just the right touch of greenery gives the place a sense of elegance that really leaves you shocked to see how inexpensive the food is priced.\n\nThe food is beautifully displayed. Everything is well thought out. When you have your first bite of anything (I have been twice now and tried 5 entrees amongst friends), you are surprised out how well spiced and balanced the food is. I am used to dousing hot sauce and condiments on everything and this is one of the first places where that is just not necessary. Again the price scale for such freshly made great dance of ingredients is shocking.\n\nLastly, the service is unforgettable. Everyone is charming and welcoming. You feel so at home, like you are having brunch at someone's house. Kat has been my server for both visits, and is exceptionally sweet, thoughtful, and friendly. She remembered my name coming in the second time and even remembered all my weekend plans with my friends (which was weeks back!). \n\nThe only thing you need to be wary of is for some reason it can be abnormally hot in there.

And the eggs Benedict. Don't get me started. The hollandaise is second to none. Service was fantastic. The atmosphere is modern but homey and the exposed kitchen highlights the talent of the chef's.

Both of our meals came with a small cup of berries, which really rounded out the meal. I felt I was getting allllllllll the food groups. Iced coffee was tasty, and we didn't have to wait for a table.

I get that this place is small but be considerate of your guests and try not to cram people into the bar or community table. \n\nLast time I was there they tried to jam us at the community table.  Finally 5 people left out of frustration. My friend and I were not thrilled being jammed in. \n\nToday while they were busy their staff looked like they were deer in headlights.  I had to ask someone to finally take my order.  The Big Spoon.  Asked for eggs to be scrambled light.  Order comes. Eggs scrambled hard, rock hard toast with glopped on butter, no butter for pancakes no salt or pepper.  When asking for butter it was cold and hard.  \n\nThe owner saw I was pretty unhappy and did comp me which was the right thing to do (and appreciated).  Nice guy however I do hope he will work to get his staff on board better.  \n\nThis is the new hotspot with a lot of young people who will wait for an hour but is this really worth it?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-09-13", "description": "My wife and I wanted to check this place out because it's in our neighborhood, and one thing that the Church & Market area lacks is an abundance of decent food. I immediately noticed that the price of coffee was high: $4 for a cup of coffee, and $6 for a latte. I get it -- brunch is inherently a luxury, rents are high, and employees need to be paid well. If you can't afford it, then don't go, right? But here's the issue: the coffee here is not good. And one thing my neighborhood does have is a wealth of excellent coffee options. If you're going to charge the highest price for coffee in this area, then you also, therefore, better have the best coffee, or at least coffee comparable to what other local venues serve. Both my wife's coffee and the expresso in my latte were sour, and tasted low-grade. They need to find a better source for their brew, and they also need to pay attention to its preparation. Their food was okay; no big surprises or big disappointments, but it certainly wasn't memorable. Again, SF offers some fierce brunch competition, and a restaurant can't survive by being fair-to-middling (note how the owner of Tangerine on 16th and Sanchez re-conceived that unremarkable restaurant to become the very popular Kitchen Story). Wooden Spoon's space is very pleasant, offering a sort of cozy minimalism, and a brunch joint is a good addition to this spot. The service was good and hostesses and staff were attentive. So please up your game, Wooden Spoon! I'd like to see you succeed.", "author": "Allen W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-08", "description": "I'm a visitor in SF with curiosity to taste traditional American breakfast/brunch. It's my first time using yelp and I saw this restaurant with 4 and a half stars so I watch the picture reviews and want to make my decision through the netizens recommendation.\n----------------\nI can't decide between house hash and that one with crab. One waitress says that both are her favorite and the ribs are heavier. Since I'm really hungry and have a plan to have seafood on the next day, I order the house hash.\n----\nthe moment it get served, the smell attracts me soooo much!(I'm hungry to death in late 11 o'clock) After having the first taste on the rib----wow! that's fantastic! Not only the ribs, but also the potatoes, the corns and especially the 3 kind of sauces with mustard, pepper and cream are awesome. All those things make a prefect match together, making the whole course a total enjoyment.\nthe egg is perfectly cooked as well, soft and half liquid.\n--------\nI thought the amount would be even or too little since It's breakfast and I'm really staring, but actually It's perfectly enough for me as a lunch cuz there're plenty of ribs and potatoes. Only if there could be more vegetables or salad!\n\nThat's really  a nice experience!", "author": "Fiona Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-08-26", "description": "OVERALL: The ambience is bright, clean, and gives the impression that it doesn't know exactly what it's trying to be, so it tries to be a little bit of everything. The result is that while the casual atmosphere and fair-priced fare should attract easily placated customers, the tax is on those who expect innovation to result in something better. Overall, the food and feel can be summed up by one word: Simple. Unfortunately, while simple can be the secret to otherworldly pleasures, in can also be the recipe for another word: Meh.\n\nFOOD: The lackluster crab and bacon scramble could have used more crab, and was certainly short on bacon, while the included greens left much to desire, slightly aided by a small ramekin of fruit. Potatoes were somewhat dry, so I recommend adding sauce of your choice. The Big Spoon is filling (pancakes and toast for carb-loaders). Someone mentioned on Yelp that they use real maple syrup, but I am doubtful. Theirs is not viscous and tasty like real maple syrup. The best I can say about the food is that it wasn't bad and it was healthy.\n\nDRINKS: For cocktails, the Blackberry Bramble might be a popular hit, since they were out of ingredients to make it, unless it is anything like the watered down and undrinkably bland Breakfast Spritz, in which case I would steer you towards the Strawberry Margarita for sweet Tequila in the morning. Coffee is hard to get wrong, but they really got it right by going with Sightglass.\n\nSERVICE: I am hesitant to even begin to describe the deluge of poor service I received, but I cannot discount the experience. Service, when it is really good or really bad, is elevated in importance. So I must say that the begrudged long hair tatted guy behind the bar must have been pulled off the street because he had no clue what was going on. His deadbeat demeanor and incompetence makes me wonder how he got hired, and whether he seemed so disinterested and hungover at the time of his interview. He was so quiet and mumbly I gave up trying to understand him by the time we left. Didn't offer cream/sugar with my coffee, said he gave me half-and-half when it was soy milk, gave me no spoon. Asked how I wanted my eggs when I ordered an item that has \"Scramble\" in the name, asked what kind of toast I wanted but didn't know what kind was available, never gave me the toast, did not offer any condiments including butter for toast/pancakes or ketchup for potatoes. Never checked in with me about food or cocktails, even after making one of them twice and having it sent back, tried charging me for the drink that was sent back. I am probably missing something, but not as much as he was missing.\n\nSUMMARY: The simplicity offered by Wooden Spoon is a good idea, but the portions and flavor need to be re-examined to get it right. It is still a healthy option and fairly inexpensive (it can't afford not to be, with the service I received).\n\nSide-rant: if your only location is in SF, don't tack on a 3% surcharge for \"SF Mandates.\" You are only in SF, so that is part of the cost of doing business, and should be factored into the price of the items listed on the menu. It is your responsibility as an employer -- if you must pass the cost along to the consumer, do so in an upfront, transparent, socially responsible way, rather than sneaking it in at the end as a hidden cost.", "author": "James C."}

I walked in, they were very busy as expected but I could see at least two seats in between that were free and I was a party of one. Two hosts were at the door. One greeted me female), the other didn't (male). She pointed out the two seats, said it might be a bit of a squeeze but if I'd wait for 20mns she could get me a spot. Why fit in all those seats if you don't actually want to seat someone when there's a free spot? But fine, no problem. Then another single diner got up on the end and she (hostess) said she was going to put me there, hold on while it's cleaned up. I hold on, it gets cleaned up.  Hostess seems to get very busy so I keep waiting. Another lone diner walks in, sees the free spot that they just cleared supposedly for me, asks the other host who has yet to acknowledge me if it's free. Host says yes, sets him up with a menu. I look at him (host) and he just looks back at me, expressionless. I keep looking for hostess who can see me but still seems busy. Eventually I ask the host what's going on, weren't they clearing that spot for me, wasn't I here before this guy? Host, again expressionless, tells me I need to wait. I wait. Eventually I ask again what's going on. He points to one lone seat in between a very crowded bar and tells me they'll seat me there if I wait for the other parties to leave first.

The variety in the menu, the perfection of the eggs (everyone must try the soft scramble with crab and marscapone!), the design vibe and fresh cocktails (with fresh grapefruit juice!)will definitely have me coming back. The service was great and attentive which was icing on the cake.  Will definitely be back for more!", "author": "Christine K."}
