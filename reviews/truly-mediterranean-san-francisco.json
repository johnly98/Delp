It was wrapped in foil to keep it warm and still tasted warm when it arrived. There was a lot of hummus and fresh veggies on it and it tasted quite good it was also large enough to share between two people.\n\nThat's a bully salad was packaged well and had a good portion size for the price paid however I wasn't too impressed with the taste of the tabouli salad which I have had quite a bit of times for some reason it just tasted like it was missing something maybe not enough lemon or something of that sort but it definitely didn't taste like what typical to political they taste like so that was slightly disappointing. I wish I was able to eat all of the tabouli salad but I didn't like the taste enough to be able to do that.\n\nLastly I don't know if it was the delivery individuals fault or the restaurant fault but we had to find silverware to be able to use because there is none in the package which was not too easy to find because we are not from the area and we're staying at a very small hotel that luckily was able to find us some.\n\nAnyways I will definitely order the wrap again if I was in the area it was large tasty with this like crunchy on the outside of the wrap and was packaged well. However I would definitely not order the tabouli salad just because I didn't like the taste of it maybe that's just how they make their tabouli salad but I personally would not order that again\n\nAs always, go vegan ( or at least try )!", "author": "Peyton C."}

Since I had $20 to play with, I decided to order a wrap from Truly Mediterranean. Our delivery order arrived via Caviar on Friday, February 9th around 12:30pm.\n\n*Hummus Wrap: Garbanzo dip, tomatoes, parsley, onions, olive oil, and tahini sauce, served on lavash, Vegetarian ($7.15), add Tabuleh (+$1.10)\n*Kefta Kabab Plate: Seasoned ground lamb and sirloin, charbroiled to perfection, served with rice, hummus, and tabouleh ($13.20)\n\nI got the hummus wrap, but a coworker was nice enough to share his kebab plate. The wrap was actually huge! A good amount of hummus filling. Though it was a little thinner than I prefer. Kinda runny with all the ingredients mixed together. And messy to eat. Definitely a knife and fork situation. I had added tabbouleh, but unfortunately, I never got it. Good thing I had the plate since it came with tabbouleh. I love the freshness it adds to Mediterranean food. The tried the kofta which was okay. A bit dry, but the hummus helped with that when I ate them together.\n\nDecent Mediterranean food. Though I'm bummed they forgot my tabbouleh. A waste of $1+. Not sure if it was Caviar or the restaurant's fault, but at least I had that back up plate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-02", "description": "Tuesdays in the Mission mean Taco Tuesdays (obviously) and Truly Mediterranean chicken shwarma (less obviously). Truly Med's famous chicken is only available on Tuesdays and Fridays, building hype as expected per basic supply-demand economics. \n\nTruly Med is a hole-in-the-wall, but the open kitchen in the small space allows you to see that their cooking methods are in fact truly Mediterranean. You can see shwarma carved from chunks of meat from a spit, a row of falafels encircling a large pan for made-to-order frying, and a grill where you can see them toast your wraps resulting in schmexy grill marks.\n\n1) Lamb shwarma wrap ($10): While there is most anticipation for their chicken, there was a posted Zagat article introducing the lamb shwarma. I got it spicy according to the owner's suggestion, but the tabasco sauce seemed to dominate and overpower everything else. There was a surprisingly generous amount of meat, and the ample yogurty garlic sauce kept it nice and moist. Overall the wrap was a bold statement--densely filled with meat and drenched in a sharp sauce. Personally I would have liked it better balanced with more onions, but it was quite satisfying.\n\n2) Chicken shwarma wrap ($10): This time I asked for non-spicy, and I liked it better because you could better taste the complexities sans tabasco. The chicken was succulent and umami, with a strong chicken-y essence reminiscent of chicken broth. The chicken-ness synergized with the garlicky peppery sauce and onions very well; the flavors and textures were on point.\n\n3) Falafel: This piqued my interest, and I tried one while waiting for my wrap on the grill. Although it seems you can never really go wrong with falafel, Truly Med does make remarkably tasty ones. I think fava beans are a major constituent, since the cross-section is green and it tastes distinct from chickpea falafel. It seems that a lot of thought was put into the creation of this falafel, with its blend of herbs and spices for more dimension and the topping of tahini sauce for additional flavor and prophylaxis against being too dry as falafel often is. The coarse grainy texture makes it taste especially homemade. Falafel essentially always makes happy, but it's safe to say that this is one of the best falafel I've ever had.\n\nPrices range a bit higher than your typical wrap place, but it's worthwhile for the quality. The owner is also very friendly with helpful suggestions and even gave me the falafel for free when I asked to order one. \n\nTruly Mediterranean Tuesdays... doesn't have as nice of a ring to it, but it should definitely be on your radar P:", "author": "Edna C."}

I've tried both the falafel and lamb shawarma wraps, and I thought both were quite satisfying.  I will have to go there on a day when they serve the chicken shawarma to round out my experience.

It's the kind that has a crunchy, sesame seed packed exterior, with a slightly crumbly, green colored interior. Savory, crunchy, rich deliciousness!  It didn't feel too heavy or too fried either - a hard balance for falafel to maintain! \n\nI'm SO pleased to say that the falafel plate is vegan friendly, if you omit the Schwarma. It is a lot of food though, so be prepared to take a doggy dish home with ya. \n\nAlso, just a heads up, this little spot in the mission is more of a grab-and-go situation than anything. They have some outdoor seating out front, but TBH it's not the most ideal spot to dine. The tables are fine and the neighborhood is cool - but it is a busy street and attracts a rowdy crowd. \n\n\nI'd recommend taking the food to go!", "author": "Jackie K."}

I called both the day before and the day of my office lunch to confirm our order for 30 people (but did not make any changes to the order) and apparently the employees do not communicate with each other (\"it wasn't in the catering notes\").    \n\nThe delivery was 25 minutes late, was missing an entire platter (approximately 1/4 of the entire order) and was not delivered until over an hour after it should've been delivered when most people were \"done\" eating. The manager insisted that I still pay for the entire order, even for the items that did not arrive.  Instead, he offered to include the missing platter on my next order.  I told him that was unacceptable as we were halfway through a lunch without enough food and I didn't need a discount on a future order but rather needed the food that was paid for.  People were still hungry and some had not eaten any food, which was aggravated by the fact the meat was improperly packaged. \nThey had told me that they typically package the individually-priced meat skewers in individual containers over a bed of cucumber salad and I received multiple confirmations that the meat would be packaged this way.  Instead, they dumped all the meat pieces into giant tins and I had to ration out the servings instead. \n\nDespite several phone calls to arrange the replacement delivery, almost half our falafel order was missing (18 pieces of falafel were not delivered) and we were never reimbursed.  All my interactions with Truly Mediterranean and the delivery person were cordial but a more accurate name for them might be Truly Incompetent.  I wouldn't risk organizing a delivered workplace lunch with Truly Mediterranean again.  \n\nLast but not least, the prices advertised for their platters on their website are inaccurate.

I would definitely put this in the fast food category since you get the food really quickly.  I had the lamb Shawarma (on the receipt it was spelled \"Shawerma\"),  and it was pretty awesome.  \n\nFor the uninformed Shawarma or Shawurma is a Levantine Arab meat preparation, where lamb, chicken, turkey, beef, or veal are placed on a spit (commonly a vertical spit in restaurants), and may be grilled for as long as a day. Shavings are cut off the block of meat for serving, and the remainder of the block of meat is kept heated on the rotating spit. Shawarma can be served on a plate (generally with accompaniments), or as a sandwich or wrap.  Shawarma is usually eaten with tabbouleh, fattoush, taboon bread, tomato, and cucumber. Toppings include tahini, hummus, pickled turnips, and amba.\n\nI ordered the spicy version in a wrap and the lamb was definitely cooked on a spit (to the right when you walk through the entrance).", "author": "Bevin H."}

Town.\n\nIt'd been awhile since I'd eaten food from Truly Mediterranean, for no clear reason other than I'd forgotten about it. Gave it another go yesterday and am pleased to say I will definitely be back.\n\nFirstly, the place is very small, with two outside tables and a small counter with about 4 stools inside as far as seating goes. Highly recommend getting your food to go (and with Dolores Park so close by, you're not exactly hard pressed for a locale to eat it). \n\nYesterday I ordered the regular falafel wrap (the deluxe one comes with potato and eggplant, for $1.75 more). It was a little over $8, very large for your typical wrap, and contained the most enormous and green falafel I've ever seen. Typically when I think falafel, I think of a ball about the size of a baby's fist. This falafel was closer to the size of MY fist, and had such great flavor, not to mention a bright green color on the inside, indicating freshness and a homemade quality. The wrap also came with cucumber yogurt sauce and tahini. Very simple ingredients but such a pleasure to consume.

They also have really yummy falafel and you can get it plain or in s wrap as well. The wrap comes with a hot sauce option that isn't very hot so I always get it.\n\nWarning - these wraps are huge. Definitely big enough for two hungry people to share. They can cut it in half for you so you can easily enjoy it. They don't have any seating really, just a little table outside so most people take the wraps over to Dolores park if it's a nice day.\n\nGreat neighborhood spot to get some fresh, healthy, Mediterranean food. It's also very quick to pick items up all of the time and the service is always wonderful.", "author": "Juliet S."}

Ali Baba's Cave \"changed\"--heavy scare quotes mine and intentional as all hell--into Al-Fanoose (RIP), but the super falafel didn't change.  Al-Fanoose closed.  I was sad.\n\nI went to King of Falafil/Falafel, and I love that place, but its super falafel isn't as good as Ali Baba's Cave's/Al-Fanoose's was, plus it's in no way convenient for me to stop there on the way home from work, unless I intentionally get off BART too early, take a 38R, and walk UP A HILL and IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION from my place.\n\nI went to the original Ali Baba's Cave a couple of times after that, but it's just not that convenient either, despite how flat the Mission generally is.  Then I remembered long-forgotten Truly Med.\n\nYes, Truly Med of the days when plain-wrap mechanic's garages had design studios hidden in them but before the days of said hidden design studios advertising their existence as design studios and, thus, blowing their cover and jacking up their and the nearby rents and pushing out mom-and-pop stores and poor people of color because what San Francisco needs is more white people who make too much money and don't pay enough taxes or attention to the rich history of where they now live, let alone to their surroundings, right?\n\nYes, I walked into Truly Mediterranean and ordered a super falafel, and you know what the guy said?\n\n\"A what?\"\n\nMe:  \"A super falafel.\"\n\nHim:  \"We only have one size of falafel.

Consuming just one of these wraps it looked as though I was going to hit my daily calorie intake on this one sitting.

I did make an internal note to opt put of the eggplant next time (it was way smooshy and I didn't enjoy it) and request for non-spicy. Not because I can't handle spicy but because I didn't really care for the wrap to be as spicy as it was. But I was pleasantly surprised that my wrap had fries. Does this make the wrap not as \"truly Mediterranean\" as their name suggests? I don't know but I also don't care - it was good! \n\nWarning: it can get quite messy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-25", "description": "All I can say is that this place is amazing. We've been here a couple of times and I made sure that I get to visit the place every time I am in town. This place located at the very heart of Mission, place of food, art, music and basically anything that will keep you coming back. Mission is one of the places I like to visit when there's an available parking in the area. Lol! Yes, tight street parking and some road sign were  more of a suggestion really. \n\nI found Truly Meditteranean when I was in search of what to bring back home to my husband when I first visit San Francisco. I know he wouldn't ask for anything else other than I bring him some good food. I know that he can't say no to shawarma. With  reputation when it comes to food I know I was on the right track. The place is small mainly for take-out but they have a stool for sitting down for people who don't mind smelling like a lamb like I do. If you know what you want or don't, you can simply ask the guy gentleman there and you won't be sorry. Instinctively, I ordered the lamb shawarma. He asked if we're a resident of the area. I said my family lives here but I am from Des Moines, IA. He was a little surprise but I'll bet he didn't where is that. Yes, most of the people I know would ask me where I live and will always be a surprise of my answer. Anyway, I told him that if my husband was here, he would definitely be a regular. The roaster keeps me entertained in this place, well aside from the people. There's nothing better than watching a rotisserie grill roaster with a juicy lamb being sliced into smaller pieces. The place is always busy as the usual but they really make every order in a timely manner so you won't be waiting there for too long. Again, there's not much parking in the area, so someone typically drops me off there and pick-up after 10-15 minute. For first timers, finding this place might be a little tricky. The place is right by the bus stop on a busy road. By any chance you get lost, just follow to smell, it'll lead you right to their doorstep. The one time that we came here, the guy actually gave us a sample coz I was curious about the falafel and told him I didn't like it. Theirs was nothing like anything that I've tried.  We also tried their baklava which is probably one of my favorite. It's the right amount of sugar that I need for that day. The lamb shawarma is just like how I like it. All the condiments that the put on it perfectly compliments that distinctive taste of lamb. Lamb meat taste is something earthy taste that I like especially the one that they use. That taste that one will truly love or hate.  \n\nI love coming back in this place! I would spend a lot in this place. Every time we come here, people are always nice, smiling and very welcoming. For me, this is one of the best places I've been to get a traditional shawarma. San Francisco is known to always make everything taste better, very cheap or cost an arm and a leg kind of dining. From anything small, the most extraordinary, outrageous, modern and the traditional cooking made better. I think Truly Meditteranean falls under this category which is affordable which do not compromise the taste at all. Now that we've moved in the area, I can be certain that I'll be a regular here. I highly recommend Truly Meditteranean!", "author": "Marvic R."}

The lamb shawerma had thin slices of lamb and beef with broiled tomatoes, onions, and tahini sauce. The lamb kabab was charbroiled marinated cubes of lamb leg with tomatoes, onions, salad, and tahini sauce. Although the two sound exactly the same, they were distinguishable. For all of the spicy food lovers out there, the hot sauce here is not a joke; it is spicy. I also ordered a falafel and two dolma, which were all delicious.

Lamb cubes, tomato, onions, pepper, parsley, salad, and tahini on lavash. It takes about 15 min to grill the lamb evenly and thoroughly, which I will give them credit for. The thing that bothered me is that the lamb wasn't marinated at all. You could see from the moment they put it on the grill that it's just pure lamb meat and veggies, without any seasoning or preparation. The ingredients in the wrap didn't really help the lack of flavor. \n\nPlus they throw tahini sauce in here like crazy, so your whole wrap begins dripping halfway in. Not impressed at all.

I mean chicken is one of the easier meats to cook.. can't be too hard to make it juicy unless it was cooked hours ago and was just sitting around in a cold metal bin.. Too bad the chicken was in fact sitting in one of those metal bins. \n\nMy shawerma was incredibly dry, room temperature, and bland.. the only thing saving it from my cutting the innards of mouth open were the tomatoes and barely there shawerma sauce. The guys working the counter also didn't want to be there - customer service wasn't obviously on their minds. For $10 and crappy service, I expect to have a decent takeaway meal, especially with so many options nearby in the Mission. How is this place still around?", "author": "Henry W."}

Usually the service is so poor I would rather go some place a bit more friendly--Zaytoon.  \n\nI have had one problem after another.  Recently I was just going in to get hummus-- I know it is a tricky and high service item to order.  I was trying to order when the service person asked the person behind for their order.  I then thought I would ask the cashier and she simply laughed and said that I had to get back in line.  The cashier laughing and smirking was the final straw.\n\nI have had experiences of phoning in an order and the order is completely wrong.  I ordered chicken and got lamb.  I didn't want to walk all the way back as I had gotten home.  I am not sure how chicken and lamb can be confused and it was the same cashier.\n\nI'll not go back--there are other choices.", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

I work on the go so it's important for me to be able to get decent food that isn't a mess to eat and that doesn't leave me feeling bloated or tired for the rest of the day.\n\nEnter the falafel wrap; your run of the mill, most basic of basic item.  How does Truly Mediterranean do it better?  Well the falafels are put into the lavash bread and then just ever so slightly smushed.  Why is this great?  You ever eat an entire falafel  in one bite? yeah probably not so the slightly flattened, perfectly proportioned falafel is much better.  Not to mention they put in the perfect amount of sauce and everything is so perfectly packaged that it's difficult to tear apart that aluminum foil.\n\nBut really, the thing that seals the deal for me is that they can add french fries to your wrap.  Move aside california burrito...\n\nThe people working behind the counter are also super friendly and watching them work is like watching... well, there's nothing quite like watching a cook make perfect falafels individually over a hundred times.", "author": "Bobby Y."}

My girlfriend and I typically split the Lamb Shawerma and Mediterranean Combo Plate, it's the perfect mix of flavors and textures for two people.

Everyone here is so nice and helpful.  I can't  do raw tomatoes, so I asked for them left off... the counter man very nicely offered my choice of something else to replace them!  So.... I took the hummus.  GOOD CHOICE!  I also saw one of the guys pulling out freshly made falafel.  They looked SO GOOD I wished I'd ordered a few to take away.  Next time for sure.... Mmmm a 'doggy bag' of falafel to munch throughout the afternoon!  I'm drooling.  And that hummus... definitely will need to see if I can get a take out container to bring home next time!!\n\nIt's more a Levant restaurant, so don't go there thinking it's Greek.  And yes, the shawerma are on toasted lavash.  I thought the lavash was relatively light and flaky, unlike at some other Med restaurants I've tried in the city.  \n\nThe owners could make a slam dunk if they also owned a little Med/Mid-East grocery right next door :-)  Speaking of... I definitely need a good rec for a Greek/Mid-East grocer.  Why is it so hard to find decent dolmas, fresh baklava, and all those luscious spices in SF?\n\nThis place is great for a quick bite, whether a midday pick-me-up or a drunken night out snack.  If you find yourself in the Mission and jonesing for some good Middle-Eastern food, stop in.  You'll be glad you did.\n\nPrices were very reasonable, and I was pleasantly surprised that the posted prices INCLUDED the sales tax!  And the portion is spot on.  Actually, I was pleasantly surprised that there was so much lamb inside!  C'mon let's face it... when you order lamb shawerma, you wanna taste the LAMB.  And this place delivers, in spades.  \n\nTruly Med, you have a new fan, and I can't wait to go back!  Fortunately, it's right near the 16th/Mission BART station, so it's convenient to get to, coming from the East Bay (or even walking up from work in downtown SF, then catch the BART home from there).\n\nNow I can't wait to go back to have the falafel... and more of that AMAZING hummus!  Not too garlicky, and with bright citrus notes.  It was great on the shawerma, and it'll be great on falafel, salad, pita, fingers.... whatever is handy!  I'm usually a dyed-in-the-wool tzatziki fan (and always will be), but the tahini and hummus together were delicious.", "author": "Scott T."}

The falafel sandwich was rich and nutty with sesame aspects. They also use fava beans in their falafel, in addition to chickpeas, which added more complexity. The 'deluxe' falafel has eggplant and potatoes added, which makes it very rich and filling. The lamb was very good, too with nice seasoning and not too fatty. \n\nAll in all, we we're very happy and it was reasonably priced. Very much of a takeout place.

We can't really figure out what to eat and someone says \"Doner\" (they probably said something else and all I heard was Doner) and then my interest is peaked. I bust out the phone and risk running down the remaining 2% of battery I have to navigate us to some shawarmas. Lucky for us, we were 70 feet away from Truly Med. \n\nThe ladies got the falafel wraps, Seb got the chicken wrap and I the lamb. The three of them said it tasted delish but that their food was dripping all over the place. I don't personally see a problem with this. In fact I think it is the way drunk food should be. My lamb shawarma was drippy too but I know how to eat and not make a mess and growing up, burritos were my favorite food item. So I know to not unwrap the bottom because then all the juice spills on your pants. (truly unprofessional)\n\nThe lamb was so good, I wanted to take it into the alley. \n\nI also ordered a side of hummus and pita bread. the table thought the hummus was perfect. it had the right amount of garlic. i'm sure it was not made in house but still credit for picking a good brand instead of something that helps your profit margin. \n\nI'm sorry for my friends in the Bay Area and my gf because whenever I got up there and hang in the Mission, we're going to have to eat Doners from Truly Med. every single meal.", "author": "Alex F."}

The chicken and lamb kebab wraps are both tasty, nice big chunks of meat in their wonderfully spicy sauce and crunchy cucumbers. Only ask for onions if you can handle it - they put a LOT in - and to top it all off, they grill the lavash to ensure a hot, solid wrap to contain the juicy deliciousness in. All items are made to order, so expect a bit of a wait.\n\nBut I'm giving them 4 stars, and here's why: when I came 2 years ago Truly Med was somewhere around $8 for a wrap. It's a big wrap, so I figured $8 was decent. However, they're now (as of June 2011) up to $9.30 for a wrap! At that price I can be getting something better than street food. I know the restaurant's gotta survive but I do too! I'd consider going to Truly Med only as a rewarding splurge nowadays rather than going to them for a busy-night dinner.

We didn't stay more than 20 minutes and over that time period three different people came up to us asking for food or money - less than a peaceful dining experience. \n\nMaybe it was the fact that it was 7:30 pm on a Sunday night and that's why the food was less than tasty.  If I'm in the area and don't have time to explore any of the Mission's culinary havens, I guess...maybe...I would start to consider giving Truly Mediterranean a second try.", "author": "Kimya P."}

It's made in a hole-in-the-wall and it even resembles a carne asada burrito but there's something about the sauce and the skin that really set it apart.  They grill the meat, then wrap it up, and grill the wrap to make it warm and crispy.  The meat is lean and flavorful.  They stuff some big tomato slices in it as well.\n\nSpicy or non-spicy?  Your choice but it doesn't make that big of a difference.

This meat is actually not pure lamb, but a combination of lamb and beef - which is fine with me.  I guess its hard to predict demand as the meat cooks on the spit, so they cook it, slice it off as its ready, and cook it again on a flat grill.  Then its stored in an oven.  Just too much cooking!  The best lamb shawarma I've had was when its still crispy fresh off the spit, maybe grilled a bit.  Mush sucks!", "author": "Richard R."}

Unfortunately Tuesday they have chicken shawarma instead.  Since I was in the mood for a little lamby, I tried the Kefta Kebab.  We were advised at the time of ordering that it would take 10 minutes so we split a falafel to hold us over.   Holy Falafel was that good.  Crispy outside and moist soft parsley filled inside.  The best falafel I have ever had!  And only 45 cents!  When the Kefta arrived it was worth the wait. The Kefta was gigantic, a spicy combo of lamb and beef sausage wrapped with tomato, cucumber and tahini sauce in a pita wrap.    More than enough to satisfy this hungry window shopper.  My only constructive criticism is the tahini sauce could have been a little saltier.\n\nNow i just will have to come back on a non-Tuesday or Friday to get the lamb shawarma.", "author": "Nicole R."}

Make sure you order it spicy (unless you're a spice-wimp) as their red spicy spread works magic on the rolls.\n\nMy personal preference is to throw in another 50c or a dollar for the extras of french-fries and roasted aubergines to be included in my wrap. The thick wrap with the warm succulent chicken, cold crunchy salad, mouth-watering hot spicy spread, the signature tahini spread, and the simple yet unmistakable flavors of the french fries and grilled eggplant work their own blend of magic on your taste-palate as they tug, tease, and grab your tastebuds, and yank them every which way none of which were displeasurable in the least bit!\n\nI have also had the pleasure of digging into their fresh-off-the-wok falafel. The crunchy grainy texture of the outer layer smeared in the goodness of decadent hummus-and-extra-virgin-olive-oil, with the moist green fragrant body are sure to, I would wager, send you into raptures and do a small hop-skip-step-jump on the sidewalks of the mission; just make sure you don't make a fool of yourself. \n\nScratch that --- you're in the mission, anything goes ! :-)", "author": "Umesh T."}

The falafel itself was actually quite good. A nice crunchy outside with a moist nuclear green inside. The hot sauce gets an honoable mention for having a nice flavor without overpowering the wrap. That's where the positive part ends. The lavash bread was way too dry. I like my wrap toasted but this was more day old than toasted. There wasn't enough hummus or tahini to make up for it. I ordered the \"deluxe\" which comes with potatoes & eggplant. This choice actually made it worse. The potatoes were dry and flavorless. Taco Bell makes better crispy potatoes. I saved the eggplant for last since it was the worst offender in the wrap. Slimy, slimy, slimy! The worst part was the taste. Difficult to describe but if I didn't pluck 'em out, we would be talking about a 1 star review here. If this is the first time somebody ate eggplant they would probably never eat it again.

Truly Med is an unassuming hole in the wall gyro and shawerma spot serving up some seriously good Mediterranean fare.  \n\nWhile I was eager to try their falafel, I wanted to stick to the list and got with the lamb shawerma.  They serve this bad boy up with thin lamb slices cut right off the spit, soft broiled tomatoes, parsley, onions, and tahini all wrapped up in a Lavash.  I opted out of the onions (bleck!) and added hummus instead (I love hummus!!)  After they wrap everything up in the lavash, they put it on the grill and fire it up for you, leaving these perfect grill marks on the wrap.  \n\nThis was really good wrap.  I usually enjoy shawermas and gyros, and this place was no exception. Every bite was packed with flavor; I was in heaven.  The meat was tender and juicy.  Every bite I took oozed out hummus from the bottom.  The hot lavash played will with the cold tahini.  Fantastic!  And thing is huge!  I was so stuffed.

I've seen the recommendation for the chicken shawerma but the first time I went, it wasn't a tuesday nor a friday so I ended up going with the lamb shawerma.  It was delicious, especially with the spicy sauce and the yogurt sauce with cucumbers and onions.\n\nI did end up trying the chicken shawerma on a future visit as well as the lamb kabob and I found that the lamb wraps were more enjoyable.

So juicy, not dry at all and tons of it! They don't skimp and I love that. Second, they toast the wrap. I've never seen that done before. After they put all the fillings in, they put it on the grill so that when you bite in, they're hot and slightly crispy and that adds SO much to the presentation and flavor!

Since then, I vowed not to eat the crap that they serve, in search of something more authentic and with fewer than a million locations. \n\nThanks to yelp, I discovered Truly Mediterranean. What caught my eye was the chicken and lamb shawerma in the pictures that looked more like a burrito. \n\nI could not believe. How could these hipster DSLRs make a shawerma look like a big burrito? (insert inappropiate dirty jokes here...) True to form, they are very burrito-like. They have a schedule where they serve either chicken or lamb shawermas on certain days. The owners/workers were incredibly patient as I decided which of the 5 menu items to eat.  Make sure to check out the beverages as well. They stock one of my favorite ginger ales.\n\nParking can be tough in the area and if it's a cold day the only viable seating is the counter which can seat only 5 or 6.", "author": "Dennis L."}

The lamb is shredded pretty finely, their hot sauce burns pleasantly, and the wrap itself is thrown on the grill for a nice crisp exterior.

I won't be going back because of short sided business views over a Groupon. I went in today with a Groupon that expired yesterday but of course the face value is still usable at $12. However, it was refused even when I showed in black and white that the voucher NEVER EXPIRES. I explained this and was told \"I understand\" but clearly this is not the case. I was ready to spend the usual $25-30 less the 12 but this meant nothing. It actually behooves a business when a Groupon expires. So the fact that I was willing to spend more, had been going here for 21 years and the Groupon still had value didn't matter and I was simply told \"I'm sorry.\" But I'm actually sorry that the value of $6 was more than the hundreds and hundreds I would spend if you stayed open another 21 years. There was no financial loss to you today but you couldn't see that. For that I am sorry for you because I have to think there will be more like me with Groupons and what will you do when other things in business pop up? Always take the short view?

A tease. Blasphemy! Not expecting smoking hot as the food was a to-go order, the meat was barely luke warm and had quite a bit of chew to it. Seems as though this pan atop the grill was merely a vessel rather than a means for keeps the meat hot, juicy, and delicious. Re-heating the meat at this point yielded only a slight improvement but was mostly a lost cause. The lamb's accompaniments added bulk (and the glorious onion breath we all desire) to the meal but not much else.\n\nTo scoop up smooth, but not overly creamy, and yes, quite flavorful hummus, we received oodles of heated pitas. Quantity does not make up for quality though and while the hummus hit the spot, the rest of the meal left me longing.

Fine, chicken it is.  Taken off skewers after being grilled and slapped with some sauce, veggies and then wrapped with love.  \"Warmed up\", he asked.  \"Yes please\", and he lays it on the grill.   When you take a bite, you get a little bit of a toasted crunch on the wrap and then, and then. . . .paradise.  Haha, it was delicious.

The service is quick and friendly, the ingredients are fresh, it's huge and filling, and I like the grilled wrap, but I am a little disappointed with the flavor. However, I will give them another chance - they offer a vegetarian plate with babaganoush, falafel and other goodies, which might be better.

Soggy-assed tahini and lettuce filled \"wraps\" is what we keep getting.  Limp dissapointments incapable of producing anticipation or cravings.\n\nI actually bring a huge sheet of heavy duty foil, go to truly med to stare longingly at my \"lamb burro\" being grilled (insert soft harp music here), wrap it tight in the foil, mad dash to post up at the marin headlands overlooking a foggy GG.... and rehash the \"...take me now\" feelings that magically combine with the harmony of culinary artistry and  ambience.\n\n*** edit 12/11/09...  the mystical red spice that dusts the grilled onions and tomatoes has been positively IDd (with noted fervor by the Truly Med crew I might add... thanks for the tip, appreciated!)  as \"sumac\" \n\nCourtesy SpiceDepot.com  - \"The sumac dried berry is not the poison sumac tree leaf, of course, but instead is a berry on a shrub that has grown wild in the Middle East since Neolithic times. It's sold as a reddish dried fruit that found in many Middle Eastern and Greek groceries in the form of a brick.\"\n\n**** Chicken Shawerma: first blood II\n\nPulled the rare \"back-to-backer\" with madre y padre in town, Thursday featured the usual suspect... an ode to spicy lamb shawerma bliss (1st time asking for it \"extra spicy\" which produced a tongue salivating pleasure-to-pain ratio of about 4-1, perfect) that delighted all but the Stagecoach inn maid. Friday was the dreaded day of reckoning... \n\nMuch like an understood mistress, I'd always known that there was this \"other\" shawerma,  yet I had always found myself inescapably blinded to variety by my craving for their grilledlamb. I had hoped  against hope that these poultry \"infidels\" were merely an option on tuesdays and fridays.... negative ghostrider. \n\nIt's pollo time.... shiznit.... woe is me.... \nBut wait, it has a \"garlic yogurt\" sauce replacing the tahini.... very interesting... hope springs eternal.\n\nVerdict: while a breezy, almost sultry afternoon on Treasure Island sprung for extremely complimentary ambiance, the chicken shawerma failed to live up to the limited hype I had bestowed upon it. Even with the always appreciated extra red sauce, the lack of flavor depth in the chicken (through no fault of Truly Med) even as enhanced with garlic, could not hold a candle to its Baa Baa Black Sheep compatriot. \n\nlesson learned: while variety is indeed the spice of life, habitual use of sumac applied to a lamb burrito from the gods can make everyday remarkable.", "author": "Roadtrip B."}

I came on Friday so I ordered the lone shawarma option, chicken. I watched as they made the wrap.. onions, and a whole lot of em; chicken, tomatoes and parsley, and a few squeezes of tahini sauce. \n\nWell the tahini was pretty bland, so even the heavy handed squeeze didn't do much for the wrap. The chicken pieces, while moist, weren't very flavorful either. I did like the textural contrast from toasting the wrap, as well as the fresh tomatoes and parsley. The onions though, didn't seem to meld in the wrap, and I typically love onions. They seemed underseasoned, and overwhelmed the wrap as a whole. \n\nI got hot sauce on the side, and was surprised to find out it tasted like Korean gochucaru flakes made into a paste. House of Falafels in Santa Clara uses Asian chili paste for their hot sauce too, go figure.\n\nAnyhow, I wasn't too impressed and didn't finish the wrap. Maybe the lamb shawarma is better?", "author": "Derrick V."}

I totally agree with the comment \"I have driven with my knees to scarf down this meal.\"  In fact, I also add a little improvised placemat to catch any drippings that may seep out the bottom of the foil wrapper.

So, I dragged my fellow foodie date with me across town to try it out. \n\nAnd I kinda felt guilty afterwards making him walk so far because the place was not as cool as I hopped it would be -- perhaps Yelp hyped it up too much =(.\n\nFOOD: We ordered the combo plate (falafel + hummus + baba ganoosh + tabolleh + dolma + warm pita) and chicken gyro (extra spicy).  Pretty tasty and decently portioned considering the cheap price (about $15 total for both dishes), but I can definitely say I've had better. \n\nAMBIANCE/STAFF: Mmm...I'll have to be completely blunt: I was pretty appalled when one of the staff started feelin up on one of his customers/good friends. They were probably just playing around or maybe drunk, but uh....yea. Hard to enjoy the food when immature/crude activity is going on about 2 feet behind you. Not cool.\n\nHowever, the elder staff member who wasn't so busy squeezing boobs on the side was pretty nice -- he was kind enough to cut our wrap in half seeing that we were going to share. One of the two stars goes just to him!\n\nAnyway, over all...I'd have to say this is the first time Yelp reviews has failed me. \n\nFor those of you who truly want to discover some REAL tucked away Mediterranean food places, Wally's in Emervyille is the place to go!

Credits go to the BF who have been frequenting here for quite some time. \n\nThe first time there, I ordered a lamb shawerma and chose to eat it there--on the cushioned stools, facing the mirror. Being a complete newbie, I didn't realize that there was only one correct end to open the tin foil. I opened mine from the bottom (wrong side).  Just when I was about the dive in, the cashier quickly caught my attention, and rushed over to re-wrap my shawerma with tin foil. The top (correct end) is open, you see, and had the cashier not saved me, I would have been left with bits of lamb, yogurt sauce, onions, etc. falling onto on my lap. Great service--even from behind the counter! The shawerma was delicious with just the right amount of seasoning and tenderness of the meat. \n\nThe second time, I got the lamb shawerma again. Opened it up from the top end. No mishaps there except the mess I made from devouring the thing.\n\nYesterday, my third time, I was lucky enough to go on a chicken day (Tuesdays and Fridays). Got the chicken shawerma (with hot sauce, of course). Once again, lived up to expectations..and in fact, I like the chicken more than the lamb. Need to make a mental note to visit more frequently on chicken days. \n\nMake sure to get the hot sauce!

The storied Mamouns by NYU in NYC has great falafel, and it is almost half the price ($2.95 before tax). Let's not condemn prematurely though. As the 'chef' was preparing my falafel, I understood why there is high entry price. This isn't your regular falafel pita- it is wrapped in a burrito-large lavash pita with falafel balls, hot sauce (by request), the usual vegetable medley, and plenty of tahini sauce. So consider it a burrito of sorts - one falafel from Truly Med is at least 1.5 Mamoun's falafels.\n\nSo how did it taste? It was good but didn't bowl me over.  The falafels were not greasy but were a bit bland, and though the hot sauce added some kick, the tahini was not as savory as I liked it. The vegetable medley was great though - the cucumbers, onions, etc., added a fresh crunchiness. I also must commend the structural integrity of the falafel sandwich. Most of the time I have major problems keeping my lap clean when eating a falafel sandwich - the combination of drippy tahini and crumbliness of the falafel balls usually spells doom. Not so with with 'falafel burrito' - the experience was generally clean, and while there was of course some dripping and flinging, the falafel did not collapse until the latter portions of my meal. All in all, not a bad meal, but I've had better falafel in SFC (try Kan Zaman in the Haight).", "author": "Susheel D."}

This is absolutely my go-to place when I'm ravenous and in no mood to wait more than a couple minutes.  I always get the falafel regular, extra spicy, because it's not really that hot.  They wrap it in lavash and then grill it which makes their falafel wrap superior to others.  \n\nKabobs take a while because they grill them fresh to order.  I always see people in there waiting for kebabs.  The shawerma always looks and smells awesome, whether its chicken or lamb (it depends on the day.) I tried the garlic, yogurt & mint drink last time I was there.  It was great, not salty (I just don't dig the salty ones) but it was pretty garlicy.

Also, I asked for it to be extra spicy and it definitely wasn't up to my spice par, but I always take an extra side of chili sauce at Mediterranean restaurants because it usually is never spicy enough for me. I also ordered some hummus which was amazing! No complaints about that. A little more pita bread would've been nice, but I can just pick some up at the store and have a midnight snack later. Food was awesome and to go service was decent. Only complaint about service was I asked for to-go silverware on the way out to which she assured me there was some in the bag already.

The shawarma was tender and juicy, but not as flavorful as I'm used to.  Maybe I'm just spoiled after eating the chicken shawarma plate for 5 years at Mediterranean Cafe in Pasadena before moving up here.  The same $8 would've gotten me a plate full of juicy, tender, super flavorful chicken served over rice pilaf, accompanied by greek salad, humus, and pita bread.  Of course, I'm sure their rent is cheaper too, this place being in the middle of Mission, so the $8 price tag is understandable.\n\nI will be back to try the falafel and vegetarian offerings.  According to the other reviews, those seem to be the standouts.", "author": "Chris C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-19", "description": "OK all you fellow falafephiles, I have to say that Truly Mediterranean is really growing on me......that's not really doing it justice, I'm actually starting to love this place.  \n\nSo a little background:  Before I moved to San Francisco, I felt pretty familiar with the Middle Eastern culinary arts, particularly Lebanese and Syrian cuisine.  I went to college in Montreal, Canadia where you're literally tripping over Lebanese fast food joints.  All you Habitants know what I'm talking about.  Falafel, shish taouk, shawarma, kafta kebabs with rice pilaf and roasted potatoes and creamy garlic mayo and delicate, flaky baklava oozing with honey and pistachios and................ excuse me, I'm having a moment..............\n\n........... talk amongst yourselves.\n\n............OK, I'm done.  Anyway all of these wonderful things were our lunches, our dinners and our late-night, post-clubbing, drunken food orgies (along with Madonna Pizza but that's another story:).  So I have a very clear picture of what a falafel sandwich for example should look like, smell like and  taste like, i.e. deep fried nuggets of delicious chickpea meal, with humus, fresh lettuce, tomato, pickled turnip (dyed an ungodly hot pink for some reason) and garlic mayo, all wrapped up in a pita and grilled on a sandwich press.  That's how we kicked it La Metropole style.\n\nSo imagine my skepticism going to Truly Mediterranean for the first time and ordering a falafel and seeing the guy whip out a giant sheet of lavash, smear it with hot sauce (hot sauce??), onions, and diced cucumber salad (the humanity!!), falafel balls and yogurt sauce???  I wanted to say \"Dude, you're doing it wrong!!  Haven't you ever been to Montreal?\"  Well despite my consternation at having my falafel world-view turned on it's ass (we can say ass on Yelp right?) it turned out that it was actually DELICIOUS!  I continued investigating this newly discovered bizzaro world of Middle Eastern food with the lamb shawarma (equally delicious, with tender morsels of lamb shaved off the rotating meat thingy, marinated onions, parsley, roasted tomatoes, and hot sauce (tastes like harissa) and wrapped in lavash bread).  I'm totally sold.  I now crave this stuff on a daily basis.  I'm looking forward to venturing further and sampling the \"deluxe\" falafel (which adds pickled eggplant and fried potatoes into the mix) and some of the chicken and lamb kebabs.  The garlic and mint yogurt drink is also intriguing.\n\nTurns out that the owners of the restaurant are Jordanian and not Lebanese or Syrian. Perhaps there are regional differences in some of these dishes? \n\nIn any event, I've come around and am now a very big fan of Truly Mediterranean despite my preconceived notions of what \"real\" Middle Eastern cuisine should be. Can't we all just get along?", "author": "Alexander J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-20", "description": "The spicy sauce \"dries out\" the shawerma a bit, because it is more pasty than a thick chili liquid, which on the plus side doesn't soak through the wrap and therefore holds well when taking out, but I think next time I'll ask for extra yogurt sauce, which was divine. The meat was succulent--you can see them carve it out of a heaping mound on their rotating spit; just watching it and absorbing all the aroma... mouth watering! The rest of the filling is standard and very complementary; I love what they use for the wrap. Versus a pita or tortilla-esque wrap like some other places, they put it on lavash, a first for me. Awesome, perfect wrapping material.\nReasonable pricing for dinner fare, about $8 for a lamb shawerma; service is speedy and very friendly, and the place is immaculate for an over-the-counter eatery.\nI agree with Giedon K. that this is a Take-Out only place; the stool and bar for \"seating\" are far too few and cramped to be able to truly enjoy your meal (plus it's a little weird to stare into a mirror and watch yourself scarf down food... it's almost like you're having an eating contest with yourself?).\nFood a-plenty, I will be back for sure, especially to try out the chicken shawerma which is only served twice a week and therefore, makes it mysterious and worthy of my curiosity.", "author": "Jessica L."}

I love watching the guys skillfully assemble everything at lightning speed--from spreading the harissa and smooshing the falafels to the final drizzling of tahini and wrapping everything up, each person has his own flourishes.  Then, the whole shebang gets some time on the grill so it comes to you hot, with the edges of the lavosh a little crisp.  I love the Middle Eastern dance music they play, too.

Those are fine dining prices and this is a spot with a grill, employees, and a bench with four or so seats......c'mon now.

Anyways, the FALAFEL here is VERY VERY good, I like how they put sesame seeds on the outside so it doesn't lose that crispy texture even when it's been sitting there for a little bit (as we all know Falafel is best eaten fresh out of the fryer). The babaghanoush was good, hummus was good, but wasn't that huge of a fan of their tabbouleh or dolma. I got the chicken shawerma - the hot sauce was great, but the chicken wasn't that strong on their seasonings (I just wanted to put more & more & more hot sauce on). I liked how they grilled their pita, but if I was going to force rank this mediterranean cheap eats, I'd say it wasn't the top of my list.", "author": "Jeannette L."}

For those of you not familiar with this culinary masterpiece, it's kind of like the burrito of the Mediterranean, but you don't feel completely gross after eating it. Filled with cooked tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, yogurt sauce and spicy, but not hot, chicken, for fast food, this may be the best option in town.", "author": "Brian B."}

Their bread is not good though (that lavash whatever), but they manage to cover that fact by grilling the sandwich for a minute.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-03", "description": "I dropped by before a movie at the Roxie and ordered a Lamb Shwerma and my girlfriend order a Falafel Deluxe wrap. The guy behind the counter asked her how hot she wanted it and she told him. I then ordered mine and told the guy medium hot and no onions. When we got our food, we sat outside and after 1 bite I realized that mine had onions. I went inside and nicely  told them that I had asked for no onions. Instead of apologizing and offering to make it correct, they argued with me repeatedly and refused to offer a replacement. I threw mine in the garbage (the lamb sucked anyways...) My girlfriend ate hers and even though she is fine with onions, by the end of the movie, she was pretty ill from the overwhelming portion of onions.\nThese guys are super rude and the food is \"low-grade gog food\". If you want a good gyro, falafel or shwerma, try Balladie on Kearny near downtown. Ali Baba's cave in lower Haight is also a big thumbs up! Oh yeah, the food here is about $1 over priced compared to other places.", "author": "Eric D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-06-12", "description": "Does not live up to the hype.  The mediterranean food is mediocre at best; there is much better mediterranean food available in the bay area.  The meat was bland, the veggies were bland, the selection was limited, and, very importantly, the bread was sad.  Just a plain old lavash bread.  The mediterranean / babalous in SF / concord / walnut creek runs circles around this place and it's just good, not great.  If the food were good, then I could forgive the rest, but since the food is sad, then the fact that it's dirty (filthy actually), seating is poor just add to the disappointment.
