We were seated quickly at one of the few outside tables. Waiters were brief but very kind and smiling the entire time. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 got the avocado toast 3 ways and was happy with his choice. It came with sunny side up egg, bacon and heirloom tomatoes. I got the bagel two ways and went with the first two options. You can choose two options from a group of 5 that was a good mix of savory and sweet options. 1 was cream cheese with blueberries, strawberries and honey drizzled on top (tasted as good as it sounds). Choice 2 was mayo with scrambled eggs and shredded cheese on top. Both our dishes came with fresh fruit cups that were actually filled with decent portions of perfectly ripe fruits including kiwi, raspberries, blackberries, pineapple, strawberries, blueberries, honey dew and cantaloupe. Latte was also perfectly done. Everyone around us had delicious looking dishes so I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything. \n\nWe were very very happy with our breakfast! I usually leave brunches feeling greasy and overfilled but this was perfect. Highly recommend this place when in town. A great start to the day!", "author": "Nikkee A."}

There was a very short line, which is usually a good sign. It is a unassuming little breakfast place but clean. The staff was courteous and attentive.\n\nI got the French toast with caramelized bananas and caramel sauce and my coworker had the banana waffle. They were absolutely amazing. It wasn't your basic French toast and you could totally tell that they took some extra steps to make it a special experience. It was honestly one of the best breakfast I've had in a long time.\n\nMy only complaint was the coffee was subpar. And it wasn't cheap either, if I'm going to pay that kind of price for coffee I would expect it to be good.

Based in San Francisco,  Eight AM is a small place that is busy if you do not go early.  We arrived at 9 am and we had to wait about 30 minutes.  The restaurant has no air conditioning so opt to sit outside if you are a small party.  I only tried one thing since I was by myself but that one thing could've fed two people.  The service is good, they get busy so be patient.  Here is what I had:\n\nFresh squeezed orange juice\n\nAvocado toast 3 ways with fresh fruit:\n\nAvocado toast with fried egg: toasted multigrain bread topped with mashed avocado and a fried egg\n\nAvocado toast with heirloom tomato: toasted sweet baguette topped with mashed avocado and a large slice of heirloom tomato.  Add a little lemon and salt, it tastes amazing\n\nAvocado toast with bacon: toasted sourdough bread with crispy fried bacon\n\nAll these were amazing and the avocado was super fresh.  I could barely finish the fruit which   had the perfect sweetness and tanginess to it.\n\nI will definitely come back to try the other things and i would recommend this place to you too.

My favorite bites of avocado toast, by far, were the ones I popped my sunny side up egg over, and allowed yolk to soak into.

There were some things I loved and others I wasn't impressed with.\n\nPros:\nReally great fruit cup with berries in it, not just grapes and cantaloupe.\nNice service.\nHealthier food offerings than many breakfast places.\nFairly good food when seasoning was added.\nFresh foods which were generously portioned.\n\nCons:\nPut receipt paper directly on my food (receipt paper often has toxic chemicals in it).\nServed under cooked eggs on the avo toast where the whites weren't set.\nEverything lacked seasoning at different cooking intervals.\nMealy potatoes which were under cooked and lukecool in spots.\nNot given any drinks or menus for well over 10 minutes after being seated.\n\nWe ordered the Avocado Toasts and a Frittata plate. Both came with a fruit cup and my frittata came with a side of country style potatoes which had bell peppers and onions in them. Everything on my plate lacked seasoning, aside from the fruit cup. My husband's avocado toast had an egg on it where the whites weren't set. He didn't have a problem with it but I'd have had to send that back if it was mine.\n\nThe cooks choose to put the paper that the waiters take your order on beneath the food. They could have chosen to put it under the plate or under the fruit bowl but for whatever reason stuck it under my frittata directly. Thermal and pressure sensitive paper often has toxic chemicals including BPA so I wasn't pleased to see that at all. \n\nMy frittata needed seasoning mixed into the egg mixture. Salting and peppering the top wasn't really \"enough\" to make the seasoning penetrate the food. The potatoes also lacked seasoning and were oddly mealy. I don't quite know how they got the potatoes to have a mealy texture while they were also somewhat undercooked and firm to the bite. I enjoyed that they had peppers and onions but I really would have enjoyed them more if they had some seasoning added.\n\nMy husband enjoyed his avocado toasts while I thought they were mildly bland. I use a lot of herbs and spices in my cooking so my palate is definitely accustomed to more flavor. To others I'm sure the simple flavors are appealing in their own right. \n\nThe latte we ordered came without vanilla. The gentleman taking our order must not have heard that part but he kindly brought a side of it and didn't seem to charge us. That's the type of customer service I appreciate. \n\nSide note: While we were waiting a, presumably homeless, fellow was trying to give himself some salt from one of the tables and a server came out and spoke to him with dignity and asked him to please stop because the server was offering him a \"side\" of salt. I really appreciated that. Treating other humans with dignity regardless of their circumstances is very heartwarming. \n\nThis place has a lot of potential so I hope it continues to do well. There was always a small wait for tables from the time we arrived to wrapping up so I feel confident they will last a long time in the area.", "author": "Nika T."}

We asked to sit by the window and were told that he had to leave it open for larger parties.... ok... there were 3 other four-tops and lunch was winding down but ... whatever.  The coffee was fine with little pods of cream and regular sugar.  Our items arrived and the 3 avocado toasts looked beautiful.  The egg was totally cold by the time I took a bite, so that was a bummer, but they were interesting, tasty and fresh.  My friends ordered a scramble and asked for a side of sour cream...   sorry we don't have any.  I would have loved a fresh cracked pepper or sea sat on my dish, but alas, only a old little salt and pepper shaker.  So, while good, it would have been much better with a few little condiment type items.  Not overly friendly or upbeat service.  Very dirty bathroom which always makes me nervous.

Decent spot, got the two way bagel with sunny egg over avocado and then cream cheese with the berries and honey on the side. My only complaint and it's significant is they don't bother using real Jewish style bagels (which are boiled if you don't know what that means) and is how they are supposed to be made because well, their bagels are JEWISH. A bit over priced for what it is but they do make the food look fantastic for pics and offer quite a few healthier and lighter items.

No frills or thrills but you get someone to prepare a decent meal without any fuss. \n\nI ordered the avocado toast three ways (fried egg, bacon, and heirloom tomato) and fruit salad. The bread itself was nice and toasted and they used two different types of breads. I'm really glad they didn't use just plain sandwich bread so that was good. Egg was fried sunny side up, two slices of crunchy bacon and a juicy heirloom tomato accompanied the avocado toast. It didn't seem like they seasoned anything so I added some salt and pepper which went a long way. Between the three slices of toast (yay carbs) and fruit it was a filling meal. My boyfriend had the bagel fix-ups (half with nutella, banana, rice crispies and the other with peanut butter, bacon, apple) and fruit salad.

We arrived at 9a and there was no wait, which is quite surprising because anything on Yelp in SF with more than 4-stars demands respect and anticipation of a wait time.  I guess we got in right before the rush!\n\nThe service was one of the most pleasant experiences during our weekend visit.  The food was also great!  Everything was minimally seasoned, so that you can dial it in to your own liking.\n\nWe ordered the Fisherman's Egg Benedict and the 1PM.  Eight AM provides beautiful plate presentation and quality.  You will not be disappointed.\n\nJust as we were leaving, like clockwork, there was a 20 minute wait and it began to drizzle as well.  Not a problem with the rain as it has been patchy all weekend.  \n\nThank you for that bit of sunshine on Saturday, Eight AM!

My wife had the bacon and cheddar Russian Hill frittata which she enjoyed. The orange juice is fresh squeezed.

Each toast is different, one topped with bacon, another with egg, and a third with tomato. My favorite had to be the tomato! It was delicious and very filling.

Not too bad in comparison to most brunch/breakfast places all around the city especially for the area it was in. Service was really good and it didn't take long to get our food.

Love the art, too.\n\nWe totally over-ordered because there were so many great things on the menu. We ordered three things...\n\n* Avocado Toast Three Ways - This comes with three pieces of toast with three different types of toppings. I think Nina and I could have split JUST this and we would have been content. These were not my favorite, but still very home made.\n\n* Castro Frittata - The frittata was a little on the dry side but still tasty and fresh, not with all the frills of other $20 San Francisco omeletes. It was nice to have a frittata instead of an omelete!\n\n* Chia Seed Pudding - This was my favorite menu item. SO healthy and fresh and tasty. Would recommend this! Having this with a side of toast or an egg is just the right amount of food for a light breakfast to start your day.\n\nIf you have exhausted all of your San Francisco breakfast and brunch options, add Eight AM to your list.

I'll come back again! \n\nGot the haight ashbury frittata which was pretty big and had a gooey cheesy filling.

Wow! \n\nThe \"blueberry shortcake\" is really good: tons of blueberries with cream and vanilla pudding on a buttery flaky croissant. \n\nAlmost every plate comes with a bowl of fresh fruit! Usually restaurants skimp when it comes to fresh fruit, berries, or smoked salmon but this place absolutely does not. \n\nCute turtle decor inside. It looks like a family run business and the chef / owner came out and told us to take our time even though we were their last customer.\n\nThe service was highly attentive and +1 for seating us right when you closed!

We stood in line like dumb dumbs thinking there was actually a line.  There isn't.  For some reason, people just like to stand in line.  Everything we had for breakfast was fantastic.  I had the avocado toast 3 ways (well, two for me because I don't eat eggs).  They did not charge me extra for the substitution of extra bacon instead of the egg AND they brought me extra slices of this beautiful heirloom tomato for no additional charge as well.  The fruit cup was so fresh and delicious.  My husband had one of the frittatas and it came with breakfast potatoes.  I had food envy for every plate that went by.  The portions are VERY generous and we are hearty eaters.  The guys working in the restaurant were hustling!  I was amazed at the speed at which they moved.  Be forewarned, the restaurant is long and narrow inside, so accommodating parties of more than 4 during the rush will be a challenge.  They also have 4 tables outside that they can push together if needed.  One more note about the restaurant - it is really warm inside, so dress in layers so you can peel something off if they seat you in the main dining room.  AND FINALLY, THE FOOD IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT!  We were going to go back a second day to try the waffles or French toast but decided we would try the other top rated restaurant in the area, Hollywood Cafe.  What a disappointment!

Also very patient when we were still trying to figure out what we wanted and kept making adjustments to our orders.\n\nFood: I ordered the soy chia seed pudding, which was pretty good, but in hindsight, for $8, I could have probably just made it at home. I also got a couple egg whites to replenish my muscle stores. My bf got the avocado toast three ways, which comes with an egg, bacon, and a tomato. It also came with a generous side of fruit. They were as expected, but nothing amazing. I think they needed a bit more seasoning to be honest. They have some other, more carb heavy items like waffles and french toast that may be more mind-blowing, but while this place didn't necessarily WOW me, I do respect the fact that they use such wholesome ingredients, so I feel like I'm eating clean.

You just need to tell the waiter! I recommend all 3 though so you get the best of all 3 worlds!! The bread for all 3 are different as well which makes it unique. I love the variety. My favorite would be the egg one since it's a runny sunny side egg :) The one with tomato on top was normal but refreshing! The bacon one is unique because it's a mix of salty and savory. This also comes with a side of fresh fruit. Every single bite of the fruit was so fresh & sweet. It came with cantelope, honeydew, banana, strawberry, blueberries & kiwi!

I ordered the peanut butter, granny smith apple, and bacon; and i ordered the black forest ham with avocado and an egg sunny. I liked the sweeter bagel because the touch of maple syrup really made it for me. \n\nI think that all four of the avocado toasts lacked salt and flavor but that's fine because they have salt on the table for you. it's hard to go wrong because it's enjoyable no matter what. \n\ni'm quite impressed by their fruit cup though. it seems that no matter the season, they stay very consistent with the selection. It was good, especially for winter time. but it's still a cup of fruit :P \n\nThe potatoes were good, cooked thoroughly and seasoned. I obviously ate it with ketchup. I wished that they could have made it extra crispy like a hash instead of a roast, but that's fine. I won't be picky.

It's just a little hike up from Fishermans Warf and has a much more neighborhood than tourist-y feel. \n\nThere's nothing I like more than choices - and this place has it figured out. Want a bagel? But can't decide on sweet or savory? No problem, you can go in halves and get both! Want Avocado toast but can't decide on toppings? No worries! They serve avo toast three ways, and you can get all three on one dish! What?! Yeah I know hu? \n\nBe advised, other people like to have choices too, so the wait can be a little crazy. Even after 9am on a weekday there were only two outside tables available and I felt lucky to have snagged one as the one next to us filled up right after we sat down too. \n\nMy dining pal has a ham and cheese crepe - I got a bite and it was super good. I went for the sweeter berry options and holy berries. I never thought I'd say this, but there were more berries than I could handle on this crepe! The fresh cream was sinfully good. I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs which were served in typical diner fashion - nothing fancy, but a good size for the price and I needed the protein. \n\nWhen in the city, take a moment to plan breakfast here - you'll love it!

Tons of wait staff around working hard as it was pretty busy and there was a line. Still - not greeted by a single employee! I obviously looked very confused and was hoping to find a host to be put on the list for a table. I awkwardly waited, tried to make eye contact. Finally I stopped an employee and asked how long the wait was. He asked me if I had written down my name on the list. He then suggested that it would be 45min-1 hour for the wait and sped off. I understand being very busy as I used to work in restaurants. Still - I think that greeting a confused customer is very important.

After looking up different breakfast/brunch places, we chose Eight AM because we figured we hadn't been to a restaurant with their kind of menu down in SJ. After looking at the photos, I think it's safe to say this restaurant is on the healthy side haha, which is what we needed after eating junk the night before.\n\nIt's a small little place with a few outdoor tables. We were able to snag a table without waiting. \n\nAs much as I wanted an orange juice, after reading Yelp reviews and seeing the $6 price tag on it, I stuck with water. (I also saw how small the glass was and felt it wasn't worth $6, even if it was so-called freshly hand squeezed.)\n\nI ordered the blueberry shortcake, which is a huge butter croissant with blueberries and vanilla pudding inside, with a side of a bowl of fruit. My boyfriend ordered the avocado toast 3 ways (2 bacons, one egg... he felt the tomato was too boring) and we both wanted to try what was so great about the chia seed pudding.\nI thought I wasn't going to be full from the blueberry shortcake, but it seemed to fill me up. And surprisingly, they don't skimp you with the fruit in the fruit bowl!! The bowl is full of pineapples, melons, honeydew, grapes, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries. The chia seed pudding LOOKED sooo good and sweet, however, it was extremely bland. Maybe that's really how it was supposed to taste, but I was expecting it to be sweet and flavorful. My bf said his avocado toast was bland as well. He ended up not eating all three pieces of toast. He, too, was full from other stuff we ordered. \n\nThe service is fast and they're all pretty friendly/attentive. But the price tags on the food... not too great about it. The taste of some of the food wasn't worth the hefty price. I know the prices are appropriate for a San Francisco restaurant, but ehh. I mean, portions are great.

We called ahead to get our name on the list and then just waited 15min.\n\nI ordered the \"Bagel Two Ways\" ($13) - (1) with avocado and egg (over medium) and (2) with scrambled eggs, mayo, and cheese. On a croissant instead of a bagel ($1 extra) both were very delicious and it was served with fresh fruit (also yummy). I was slightly apprehensive about the mayo but it was soooo good! Thought the bagel two ways was kinda expensive at $14 for what it was but it was good. \n\nThe other two people ordered the \"Castro\" frittata and the \"Haight Asbury\" frittata. No complaints from either, except that one wished there was less cheese on it. \n\nOverall the food tastes great and the service was awesome - they were very quick in trying to get us seated, including last minute changes to our order without being annoyed, and accommodating changes to what was written in the menu. \n\nIt's really close to fisherman's wharf with 2hr street parking nearby so check it out if you are in the area.", "author": "Dipika S."}

Sometimes I'll be honest and I don't even truly remember what we talked about for the hours we hang out together. \n\nWe decided on this place the week before heading here because it was a couple places on brunch spots in the the City. So we trekked all the way from Castro here. Seeing lots of tourists on the way of course. \n\nWe ended up ordering 3 things: chia seed pudding, avocado toast, and the castro frittata. \n\nThe Chia seed pudding was okay. I think the last time I had chia seed pudding it was made with coconut milk and coconut pieces so it gave the pudding a bit more flavor. It was okay with the fruit and nuts on top. \n\nAvocado toast comes 3 ways (tomato, fried egg, and bacon). I do love the egg one because I love a good runny sunnyside up egg. The bacon was also good, but now I do wonder what it would taste like with both the egg and bacon...hmmm. \n\nThe final dish was the Castro frittata. The frittata was really just okay. Honestly, I expected a bit more and the eggs were rubbery. Not great. The potatoes that came with it were just average too. \n\nOverall, we got great service, but the food was up and down. \n\nProtip: avocado toast!", "author": "Nina Y."}

I could've come here for many meals and not been bored! Since we had a long day ahead, we opted for a more protein-fortified option. I got the frittata with apple sausage and manchego cheese in it, which comes with potatoes and a fruit bowl.\n\nThe frittata was delicious! It had a good amount of sausage in it, and you could really taste the unique flavor to it. The potatoes were plentiful, well seasoned, and hot. And the fruit bowl??

Almost there, but you can see why its not MBC.\n\nThat being said, their presentation is on point with prices well below that of places like MBC and fruit bowls with something other than honeydew and cantaloupe?

It comes with a large fruit cup, which was not skimpy and very fresh.\n\n2. 12pm crepe: This was also delicious. They have various times of day for the various crepes.

Everything else was so good, I fully suggest coming here!! \n\nOne other thing that wasn't the greatest was their bathroom. An employee was using it before me, so you would have thought he'd clean it up a bit.

I and the hubster don't usually go to touristy spots - food there usually aren't as good but are even more expensive than other areas. San Franciscans would know to not go for anything pricier than SF standards - coz SF pricing standards are already so much higher that the national average *rolling of the eyes begin* :D.\n\nDecided to try it yesterday with a friend since our original brunch destination was closed. My friend ordered the 3-way Avocado Toast and coffee, while I ordered the San Francisco Frittata with sausage. My frittata comes with a fruit bowl (that was a lot of fruits!) and house potatoes. The frittata was kind of too dry and the house potatoes were not charred enough for my liking. Despite the big fruit bowl - I think $13 (before tax & service) for the dish was a bit too steep. While I do understand how expensive rent might be in that area - I must say for that price, I have had a lot better brunch dishes elsewhere.\n\nService for great though. I would give an added 1/2 star for the service itself. Our server (who seems to be the owner's son) was extremely friendly and fast. He kept on checking on our drinks to see if we needed refills.\n\nThere aren't a lot of good food in Fisherman's Wharf in my opinion - so this place might worth the try when you're in the area.", "author": "Priscillia I."}

Definitely recommend this place if you're in the Fisherman's Wharf area.  We'll definitely come back when we're in The City.", "author": "George T."}

Then, when I took a look at top reviews, I just found I chose a popular and good one.\n\nIt turns out this avocado toast is so good,  I started with the piece with tomato, which looks good and light. Then, I go for the piece with egg. For me, that's better to have some black pepper. For the piece that has bacon, it's amazing. \n\nI highly recommend this one.

On a Friday morning, we waited for about 20 minutes as a party of 4, and they allow you to put your name on the list when we arrive. \n\nEach of us ordered some variation of a frittata. The eggs were fluffy and the cheese and other ingredients were well balanced. Each came with a side of potatoes that were well-seasoned and not overly greasy. The main appeal was the ample side of fruit that came with each dish. The mix of berries, banana, and melon was fresh and filling. \n\nService is where this place takes a small hit. There were only two people working on the floor, which was not sufficient. They could certainly use an extra hand especially with setting and clearing tables. Overall though, a nice, pleasant brunch spot.", "author": "Aaron C."}

We also ordered the toast 3 ways- three different avacado toasts! What more could you ask for. My favorite was the sourdough baguette topped with avacado and fresh ripe tomato. The other two included bacon on top, and the other with an egg. Finally, my table ordered the Haight frittata, SO GOOD. It came with fried potatoes and fresh fruit cup. \n\nThis place would easily be 5 star, the wait time was only 10 minutes and was very efficient. The only reason I gave it 4 was because of the price. \n\nWith all the food listed and only hot green tea and coffee, our total was over $50.

However, once we got in, service was really quick. They took drink orders right away and food orders soon after.\n\nFood: Husband had a (Diamond Heights) frittata with ham and cheese and a side of sourdough toast. Frittata came with potatoes and a bowl of fruit. I had the bagel two ways. One with scrambled egg and cheese (2) and one with peanut butter, bacon, and apple (6). That came with fruit as well. We both thought the food was good, clean, and simple. Fresh squeezed orange juice is extremely expensive for the size.\n\nEnvironment: I don't know if they normally keep it warm, as this was my first time there, but I was uncomfortably hot. Air conditioning was not on at all. I don't know if it was broken, but they didn't mention anything. We were also sat at a table right across from the kitchen. Normally not a problem, but the aisle is so small, I felt like I was in the way constantly as waiters walked behind me and got food from the kitchen.\n\nAll in all, it was a quick and easy breakfast, tasty enough. But nothing particularly exciting or special. And it was way too warm inside.

Server says, well they don't like to make custom orders.  But I can ask. Server asks amd cook says no. Server comes back to tell us no, but just pick a sandwich and remove what you don't want.  Decided they didn't really want our business.  Server was nice enough. Prices too high for omitting half the items on the $14 sandwich.  Walked down to Joannies Happy Days Diner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-02", "description": "I struggled between giving this a 3 and 4 star review. Ultimately, the fresh fruit boats here are what pushed me into 4 territory.\n\nService\nThe place was packed and we had a bit of a wait. Once we were seated though (after about a ten minute wait), there was no messing around. Service was pretty quick and efficient.\n\nDecor\nThe restaurant it mostly a diner. Somehow, on a not-so-hot day in SF, the inside of this place is boiling. Maybe from the ovens? We've been to a few other diner-ish places in the area, and none felt quite this hot to me.\n\nFood + Drinks\nTo start, there was no iced tea, only hot tea. This is usually fine for me, but as stated above, the restaurant itself was hot! I could've asked for a cup of ice, but didn't feel like having the potential spillage and making my own makeshift drink at the table that morning. \n\nTo eat, my husband and I split the avocado toast three ways (I don't like fried egg, so we asked for scrambled and we don't eat bacon, so we were allowed two toasts with scrambled egg and one topped with tomato with no problems) and the Haight Frittata, cheese on the side. The toast was likely some of the worst avocado toast we ever had. Serving size was good but bread wasn't crunchy or too thick and the avocado had no salt, chili flakes, any kind of topping. The egg on top of the toast was plentiful but, again, flavorless. The tomato toast had a very dark tomato on it. It was good and you could taste the sweetness of the tomato, but I'd say again it needed more. The Haight Frittata had mushrooms, tomato, onion and maybe one other veggie. The eggs were dry. We get an omelette with cheese on the side at our favorite local diner (Swingers in LA) regularly, and it still comes with plenty of herby and delicious flavor. This frittata tasted dry, and that was even including the taste of the vegetables. Again, needed some salt and pepper at the very least. The frittata was fluffy, though. Our dining companion got the same frittata, but he got the cheese on it, and he did seem to enjoy it just fine. So maybe the lesson is, don't remove the cheese here!\n\nI mentioned the side of fruit, which every dish comes with. It's a great side of fruit - very fresh, lots of diversity (pineapple, grape, kiwi, apple, banana, melon), and a pretty generous portion. The egg dishes both came with potatoes too (again, a pretty good helping), but I was getting full without them, and my husband isn't a big potato fan.\n\nOverall, a surprisingly solid option for the usually chain-entrenched tourist area. Not my favorite breakfast place in SF by any means, but certainly not the worst either. The menu offers a great deal of variety and options if nothing else.", "author": "Jackie W."}

We ordered the Castro Fritatta and your traditional eggs and bacon.  Both came with a hefty cup of fresh fruits and home-style potatoes.\n\nThe Castro Fritatta contained chicken-apple sausage.  It wasn't mind blowing or life changing but it did the job.  \n\nAs far as the traditional breakfast, you can't really go wrong with bacon and eggs.  Though EightAM didn't go wrong, it wasn't right either.  The eggs we alright and cooked to order but the home-style potatoes could definitely use a little more effort.  The potatoes were a bit on the soft and soggy side and reminiscent of hospital food.  The fresh fruit bowl, on the other hand, was perfection--fresh berries and melons, both at the peak of ripeness.  \n\nAgain, if you're looking for a quick go-to for breakfast, EightAM is the place.", "author": "Lex And Tee R."}

We apologized to the bus guy about to bring us water and walked over to Eight AM. Wow what a gem! We both ordered the Pacific Frittata with a side of bacon. They said it came with potatoes and a side of fruit. The frittata was cooked into a cute little circle with my favorite cheese on top, Manchego.  The fruit was a beautiful bowl of artistically prepped bananas, blueberries, strawberries, can't elope and honey dew. Their coffee was amazing and the service awesome.

Let's start with my experience! We come in and there's a 25 min wait we decide to wait because of such awesome reviews. After being seated we look at the menu and gathered our thoughts and we're ready to order, nobody at the table eats pork. Let's ask the server if they have turkey or can sub for anything else, oh they don't have turkey or anything they can sub for but our server thinks it's funny that we don't eat pork and have to sub for something different. How disrespectful let's sit there and laugh at your customers  for not eating a certain something. We continue to order and we would like to sub fruit for potatoes oh no we don't do any substitutes on anything on the menu. Okay that's unusual let me get a side of potatoes then and waste this fruit that you don't want to sub. We all order but the server is just extremely rude. Oh yeah we will take some drinks. I'll remind you since I'm a server and I work here, NOT! Waters all around. Some orange juice. Oh no we are out of orange juice, Apple Juice for two of us and grapefruit juice for me. Comes back after getting all the waters and juices oh I'm sorry we are out of grapefruit juice. But is extremely rude the whole time. So about 15 mins goes by our server comes over and says they're out of French toast, first thing is it took you 15 mins to come & tell us, second is when i asked are you guys out of everything he replies rudely you guys did come late, is 1pm on news years day late! Lol so we switch it for a different item on the menu. When we get the receipt French toast is still on there and not the new item we ordered. So we get another server and explain the situation cause the new item we switched was cheaper. She then tells our server and he says aren't they the same price she says no and he just laughs right in front of us. Very rude and disrespectful!\n\nTips for my fellow yelpers: They're out of everything, they really need to stock a lot better. The servers & staff are extremely rude. It seems like it's everyone's first day! And the food is just mediocre won't be coming back!", "author": "Mo T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-06", "description": "TL/DR - AMAZING food, long waits but that's ok, friendly but frustratingly inefficient service\n\nI'm just going to start by saying their food is perfect. Perfect! So freaking delicious, and it is worth allllll the waiting in the world. \n\nWe showed up at 11am on a Sunday, and expected to wait. We waited about 45 minutes for a table, and I'm actually not taking any stars off for that because there really isn't anything they can do about it. What was frustrating was that even though we had a party of only 3 people, groups that arrived long after we did were seated before us. We also noticed that tables sat empty for quite a long time before people were seated, even though there was a very long line. \n\nOnce we got our table, we asked for coffee, OJ, and a diet coke. The coffee came, but no cream, and a glass of ice. We assumed they were going to come back with the OJ and diet coke, but they never did. We got up after a while to ask for it, and it still never came. We had to grab our own diet coke from the fridge. By the time someone came to take our order, our coffee was gone. Since it was after noon now, we asked for sandwiches, but they said that they weren't serving lunch yet. We placed our order and asked for OJ again, and coffee refills. None came. Our food came up pretty quickly, and when it was delivered we had to ask again for OJ and coffee. This time the server brought coffee but said they were out of OJ. That was the last time anyone came to the table. We gave up trying to get refills on anything. When our plates were empty and our cups were empty we continued to wait for our tab, feeling awkward because the line of people outside were eyeing our table with more and more hostility. We finally went up to the counter and had to list off all the things we had in order to pay. \n\nHonestly, I would go back again because it just seemed like they were busy and off balance, but it was frustrating because we had to chase people down in order to get basic service. I almost felt like I needed to be more assertive in order to get anyone's attention, but I didn't want to be rude when it was obvious they were all working so hard.  It just seemed inefficient and frustrating for everyone involved. Freaking amazing food, though.", "author": "Erica T."}

The French toast with glazed bananas was very sweet but exceptionally good because the thick slice was perfectly prepared with a great mouth feel because of the crunchy and chewy edges. The inside was not mushy nor soggy. I don't think it could've been better as far as cafes, or eating out, goes. Both friends really liked their respective frittatas; I had a traditional bacon and eggs. The three breakfasts came with fried potatoes and a very full fruit cup (a mix of kiwi, cantaloupe, pineapple, blueberries, raspberries, boysenberries, strawberries, and banana). Service was efficient and friendly with frequent visits to our table offering coffee. Because I love potatoes, I was really disappointed by theirs which were bland and prepared too far in advance.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-18", "description": "My family stopped in for breakfast and we loved it. They also offer lunch. The menu is mostly breakfast items, presented very attractively. We enjoyed a Croque Monsieur, a frittata with ham and gruyere plus a fruit side, and a delicious crepe full of berries, each costing $12. Also, a crepe with bananas and peanut butter for $10. The crepes are named after hours of the day, for example the crepe with berries is called the 8 AM, hence the name of the restaurant. \n\nThe server was enthusiastic, and the chef came out to ask us how our food was.\n\nThis is a small place where they obviously care very much about the food, its appearance, and the customer. We are so glad that we came here instead of a chain restaurant known for breakfast, which is easy to find nearby. The location is near Fisherman's wharf, so it is well situated for tourists like us staying in the nearby hotels.", "author": "John G."}

Their menu has a great balance of trendy items (avocado toast, chia seed pudding) and more traditional choices (frittatas, bacon & eggs, waffles). The service was friendly, attentive, and quick. Probably the best I've had in San Francisco. Why wait in a long line when you could come here and have a peaceful dining experience?", "author": "Shaun E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-20", "description": "While searching for a breakfast place near Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, my husband asked a hotel doorman for a recommendation. He suggested Eight AM and we set off in search of breakfast. After checking with the inside staff, we seated ourselves at the outside tables that have a nice view of Joseph Conrad Park. After perusing the large breakfast menu, I decided on the Avocado Toast three ways with the side of fruit and my husband got the Crepes Suzette with a side of sausage. After hearing my concern over runny fried eggs, the server said I could have the toast with scrambled eggs. Our coffee was hot, fresh and delicious and breakfast was served about midway through our second cup. The Avocado Toast done three ways was amazing. The mashed avocado was spread atop three generous-size baguette slices and then topped with bacon, scrambled eggs and an heirloom tomato slice, respectively.  The fruit bowl that accompanied it was a nice surprise - small chunks of honey melon, cantaloupe, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries and kiwi. My husband's Crepe Suzette was flavorful and he quickly devoured it and the sausage. He also had to help me finish my toast and ate most of the toast topped with tomato because I was so full. The breakfast was reasonably priced. The service was really good and the servers were very nice. I would suggest this restaurant who enjoys delicious food with a twist.", "author": "Sherri K."}
