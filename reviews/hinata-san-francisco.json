Came here for an anniversary.\n\nVenue / Service: located on Van Ness, the best way to describe the interior design of Hinata is \"modern industrial\", with its blotched grey walls, steel grey supports, and light wood accents.  The dining areas are brightly lit enough that you almost forget the grey color scheme.  The waiters are pretty on top of things- they clear dishes and fill drinks quickly.  There are 3 sushi chefs and I found the pace of the food good - we were served by Gavin.  Some chefs are more talkative / engaging than others, but I thought Gavin was pretty professional.  \n\nFood: the main omakaze is $78 per person (quite a reasonable price for SF and for 12 pieces of nigiri), with a $35 supplement of additional pieces (usually includes toro, uni, and tamago).  We went with the regular omakaze (4-piece appetizer, 12 nigiri, owan, and dessert) and were pretty full by the end.  You can also order a-la-carte at the end of the omakaze.  I'd say our favorites were the baby red snapper w/ dehydrated egg yolk, Spanish mackeral, barracuda, ju-toro marinated in soy, and the Kaisui uni (this one is a-la-carte).   \n\nThe owan (fish broth, miso, nameko, mitsuba) is a great way to warm your belly after the sushi- I can appreciate a well-made broth and one was on the higher end of favorite broths I've tasted.  \nYou have a choice of dessert; we got the matcha panna cotta w/ Okinawa black sugar syrup.  Luckily the panna cotta is not too sweet and has a great texture.  Even the syrup is not super sweet with a slight bitter undertone to mellow it all out.  \n\nGreat quality sushi and service for only $78 per person?  I'd take that any day!  Not my absolute absolute favorite sushi place in the Bay area, but it ranks high up there, especially when I don't want to have to spend big bucks for omakaze.  I'd personally give this place a Michelin star over some other ones.", "author": "Audrey H."}

When my yelp peeps say this is the best omakase value in the bay with a cool vibe, I hafta agree. I'm not going to make this a long review because it's really simple.

Clean, unctuous, smoky, sweet, briny, silky, bright, umami are just a few of the adjectives that I can remember. It was a blur. A full 2 hours of pallets popping entertainment for you eyes, ears, nose, taste buds and stomach. \n\nWalking out totally satisfied... what just happened?  I feel like I got a work out, a spiritual experience, we were exhausted at constant anticipation of what's next after having just tasted something extraordinary and how are they possibly gonna top that!  \n\nCraftsman given the best ingredients, let those ingredients shine manifesting the best possible essence of its being, presented to you and a couple dozen other lucky souls in a loving, passionate, artistic way. \n\nI'm not sure this can ever be duplicated or bested.

There are two options for omakase (and you can add on supplements to your tasting), we opted for the 70ish one (that ends up being nearly 100 after tip/tax said and done). \n\nThe fish was fresh, sitting by the sushi bar was great. Honestly, my sole complaint and the reason I can't give Hinata 5 stars is because some pieces were just overwhelmingly wasabi-y and took away from my ability to discern the taste of the fish (during the nigiri portion). I also would recommend not being in the corner at the sushi bar because it made it more difficult to interact with the sushi chef.

It's crazy that they were even able to mask the deep taste of sardine with a nice gentle topping of ginger. I absolutely dislike sardines but it was actually pretty good here. Most of the fishes were complimented well with the light sauces that were gently brushed on the top of each fish.

My boyfriend took me here for my 25th Birthday! i've never heard of this place, prior to him telling me. Apparently there's only 3 time slots per day. You need to make reservations and cancellations have to be 48hrs in advance. \n\nThe atmosphere is really nice! Decided to choose the counter, which i highly recommend!! We got really lucky to sit up front and center where the Master Chef is preparing the courses. If you're a lady, you would appreciate the under the counter hook for your purses( the little things haha). \n\nFirst off, it is a set Omakase menu. There are 4 appetizers to start. i was amazed by the presentation and the chef noted to eat them in a specific order. Then, one by one- the courses come out and it could not be any fresher. he explains each fish and where it was shipped from (knowledgeable). The chef described the small details from the texture to when you should eat it (to wait for it to cool down or asap). after the chef special of 12 piece omakase, you think that you're full. hahaha. we ended up ordering the exclusive supplements (I recommend going for one of them/ some of the a la cartes). I'd list a bunch of fish.. but to be honest, I could not remember 90% of them and where they are from haha. All the pieces have their own little touch to it, whether it's lemon/ lime/ salt/ etc. My favorite was definitely the snow crab and truffle, 1 hr of cardio because of the butter that's inside haha. Another would definitely be the eel. I know it's simple, but it was done so well!! It does come hot, i just couldn't wait and burnt my tongue. hey it was worth it. I'm definitely not a fan of Uni, but it's slowly growing on me. We got to try two different pieces on the supplemental menu. One was a hokkaido uni and the other was placed on top of a toro (which is like a 'remix' on your usual sushi). I really enjoyed how each piece had its own unique twist, but kept its simplicity. \n\nafter allll the sushi, they provide a fish broth miso mushroom soup. i don't like miso soup.. but it was so good. it tasted really refreshing and not the extra MSG. \n\nAlso, if it's your birthdayyyy. like mine! the boyfriend requested it with the server and it was nicely set up in a birthday presentation. Each gets to select between 3 desserts. We went with the black sesame and the matcha panna cotta with hokkaido black sugar syrup. omgg i've had a lot of sesame ice cream, but for some reason it is even better! maybe it's because i haven't had ice cream in a while hahaha. the panna cotta is definitely unique and so good. the flavor is very vibrant and strong, but subtle. \n\nCould not be happier. it was definitely an experience that I am impressed with! They really cater to you and ensure that you are enjoying the dinner. \n\nTips:\n- reservations \n- sit at the counter\n- all you can eat ginger hahaha \n- get the supplemental \n- enjoy the experience!", "author": "Audrey K."}

Omakase is the only way to go and no one will convince me otherwise. Add the supplement. Everything was incredible and unique. Dining here truly is a wonderful sensory experience", "author": "Chris J."}

High ceilings and open space.  It's not too crowded - you can hear your friends speaking.   They also have a waiting area in the front of the restaurant, so you're not awkwardly hovering if your seat isn't ready.   \n\nThe service is good but not intrusive.  The hostess and servers knew the sake offerings and the menu very well, and were able to give us a good recommendation on sake and uni.  The restaurant encourages you to eat with your hands, so that was fun.  \n\nThe fish was fresh and well prepared. Similar to what others wrote, I do feel that they rely too much on the blow torch.  I did like the last piece - Toro - they torched on end and not the other was really good and interesting.  Love that they have 3 kinds of uni.", "author": "Holly P."}

Hinata is a traditional sushi bar that serves full course omakase (18 items), composing of appetizers (4), Chef's choice of nigiri (12), owan (broth), and a choice of dessert (could be sherbet, ice cream, or panna cotta). You can also order supplements or individual items to your meal to enhance the experience. Expect the full course meal to be about 1.5 hours. I especially enjoyed watching the sushi-making experience and how engaging our chef was. Definitely an affordable and memorable experience worth trying!\n\nIn terms of the food, Hinata has great quality fish, but after awhile, the nigiri started tasting pretty similar even after eating ginger with every bite. I particularly liked the: Chu Toro, Kasugodai (baby red snapper), Hon Maguro (blue fin tuna), and Sawara (Spanish mackerel smoked w/ cherry wood). I also recommend the Kinka \"Gold Blossom\" sake which has a refreshing taste of sweetness and tart in every sip. \n\nOverall, my best friend and I had a really great experience. We enjoyed how knowledgeable the waitress was about sake and appreciated how she folded our napkins every time we went to the bathroom. It was also a pleasure interacting with the chef and learning details about each nigiri.\n\nRecommend coming here with a reservation for bar seats. Really love the trendy vibe and enjoyed the overall omakase experience.", "author": "Michelle L."}

I made a reservation two days in advance for my boyfriend and I and we were able to sit at the bar. I've read others say that booking in advance can help your chances of bar seating but I'm not so sure since I reserved only two days prior. Anyway... \n\nWe arrived a half an hour early which wasn't a big deal. They had a waiting area and we ordered a few drinks as we waited. The restaurant is beautiful. Very simple and clean. There's about 25 seats available and we were lucky enough to sit at the bar. Our chef was Gavin who was amazing. Attentive, friendly and informative. Gavin and I actually had mutual friends so that was cool! \n\nNow on to the food. The standard omakase for 18 pieces was $78 which was an awesome price. The appetizers were just okay, my favorite was the scallop. The nigiri course was delicious. From red snapper to trout to tuna. Every piece melted in your mouth and was super tasty. We opted for the extra supplement which included uni, wagyu, fresh water eel and a few of chef's choice. I highly recommend this! I did feel full after the standard omakase but you might as well go for that extra add-on. You won't regret it. The wagyu was my favorite of the night.\n\nI've been to other omakase places in the city and Hinata by far has been my favorite. The atmosphere is more laid back, the food was delicious and the service was on point but not over the top. \n\nAt the end we received our dessert with a cute little \"Happy Anniversary\" sign which was just the perfect way to end a wonderful dinner. \n\nReally looking forward to the next time I can come back! \n\nSide note: the meal took over two hours. If you're wanting to go there to eat right away and really fast, it's not the place for you. From preparation to actually eating the food, takes time and there will be pauses in between each course.", "author": "Melissa M."}

We dined at Hinata on a last minute whim as one of my college buddies was visiting from out of town and he needed the Omakase experience in SF.  I remember telling him good luck finding a place so last minute, but low and behold with a bit of luck and timing, Hinata was able to squeeze the 4 of us in on a weekend no less!\n\nWe arrived right at our reservation time (I believe they do 21 seatings at night, the first starting at 6:00 PM).  We were warmly greeted by the host and seated right at opening time.  It wasn't long before our Omakase experience began; a 12 course meal taking us on a wonderful journey throughout the night.\n\nTo keep it short and sweet, the entire experience was absolutely amazing.  Our group LOVED the Hotate (Hokkaido scallop) so much that we ended up ordering that same piece a la carte (additional $6), which is a good price IMO.  If you're into something tasteful and fatty, you will definitely love this piece.  I forget which item it was on the menu, but the one \"miss\" was the Umi masu (ocean trout) which wasn't anything special.  \n\nOmakase in SF at a price for $78 is an absolute steal, and Hinata is one place you'll definitely want to take advantage of!!", "author": "Kevin C."}

It pairs amazing with the omakase without the overpowering alcohol taste. \n\nMy favorite was the baby firefly squid (only served twice a year). This squid melts in your mouth and didn't have that strong ocean salt taste..\nMy second favorite was the Spanish mackerel smoked with cherry wood. The smoke and cherry wood gave this fish such a flavorful and unique taste.\n\nAfter the nigiri is all served, you get a chance to order more sushi. I highly recommend ordering the A5 BMS scale 12 wagyu.

We had dinner reservations for 8:30pm and were seated almost immediately after we checked in. If you are driving, be sure to give yourself enough time to find street parking in the area. The restaurant is rather small and has a very intimate atmosphere. Minimalistic modern decor with wooden accents surrounds the restaurant and creates an upscale feel without any hint of pretentiousness. \n\nTheir omakase starts at $78 per person for 18 items which includes 4 appetizer items, 12 pieces of nigiri (chef's selection), owan (fish miso soup), and dessert. There are also supplement options available or you may order a la carte. \n\nFor the appetizers, my absolute favorite was the Hokkaido Scallop. It was so soft and buttery with the perfect hint of citrus! The nigiri came out in pairs and were very thoughtfully curated indeed--all of the selections complemented each other perfectly. My favorites were the Cherry Blossom Trout, Spanish Smoked Mackerel with Cherrywood, and Soy Sauce Cured Seared Toro. Quality was phenomenal and everything just melts in your mouth! There were so many moments where I just had no words for how incredibly fresh the fish was and I could only mutter out incomprehensible \"mmmmmms\". \n\nRight before our last nigiri pair came out, our hostess asked if we wanted to order anything a la carte and we couldn't say no because everything on the menu sounded delightful! We ended up getting the Kaisui Uni ($13.00) which we were told has a more ocean-y taste compared to the Bafun Uni, which has a sweeter taste. We also got the O-Toro ($12.00), and Shirayaki (fresh water eel, $8.00). The eel was soft yet crispy and perfectly cooked. I wish we had gotten the A5 Wagyu but we overlooked it and will have to come back for it next time! \n\nOnce we were done with our a la carte items, we had the Owan (fish broth with red miso, nameko, and mitsuba). For dessert, we got to choose from either the Yuzu Sherbet, Black Sesame Ice Cream, or Matcha Panna Cotta. We went for the Black Sesame Ice Cream and Matcha Panna Cotta--both were excellent choices! Our hostess knew we were celebrating my belated birthday so our desserts arrived on a beautifully arranged plate with an adorable \"Happy Birthday\" sign from Hinata--very sweet and thoughtful! \n\nOur hostesses, Cynthia and Jasmine, were extremely attentive, informative, and engaging throughout our entire meal.

The tomago was also really interesting since it had ground shrimp in it (which I've never had before). Normally very sweet, but this was more of the savory side, which through me off tbh.\n\nIf you really want to cut back some costs, I would just eat a little before you come here, pass on the supplement and stick to the normal omakase.

The crab was covered in miso butter, and butter on crab is nothing special (it was tasty tho)\n\nAnother thing is if you like chatting with your chef, this was a great place for that. Very nice ambiance and yet very classy too.", "author": "Victor D."}

Only thing I would've changed was the fact it was pretty loud when we dined due to a group of 17 people celebrating a party. But hey I totally understand it so I don't mind it at all!\n\nWe got omakase with supplement order and each ordered the two different types of tea (sen Cha and Kuki Cha) personally I liked the kuki Cha better, it was very light but tasteful, wasn't as strong as sen Cha in my opinion.\n\nTo be honest, I don't remember the Nigiris however! I do remember that my favorite one was the cherry blossom trout superrrrr yummy and melts in your mouth!  The whole experience came with 4 small appetizers, 12 pieces of nigiri, fish soup and choice of dessert and additional 5 nigiri from supplement additions. I was stuffed after this experience. I posted some pictures of the nigiri and what their names were back when we went (2 weeks ago). I wish I had posted sooner so I can go into more details about the nigiri! \n\nCustomer service was fantastic! They did a great job explaining the different nigiris and were engaging throughout our meal. Kept refilling our teapots (a huge plus - I realllly liked the tea so I drank a lot of it). Also, they were very attentive throughout the night.\n\nI definitely would recommend this spot for any celebration!", "author": "Stacy W."}

TL;DR - sit at the bar and order the Supplement menu after the $78 Omakase\n\nI came to Hinata to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday on a Sunday night. We sat at the bar and our meal was prepared by Chef Weida. $78 for 18 courses is more than reasonable compared to other omakase options in the area.\n\nBefore we reached the Owan/soup course, one of the servers approached us and asked if we wanted to order from the Supplement/\u00c0 la carte menu. Even though we were pretty full at this point, we knew there were some items on the menu we wanted to try. We both ordered the $38 supplement (seaweed, king salmon belly, sea urchin, o-toro remix, eel). We both agreed that the O-Toro Remix (with uni) was the star of the meal.\n\nWhen it came time for dessert, we were brought all 3 dessert items (sorbet, ice cream, and panna cotta) with a birthday candle.

Her pick. Omakase seatings were listed on their site as 530 and 830, so we chose 830. SO it came as a bit of a surprise to me when we were seated at a table, and not the bar, when we got there. Had I known, I would've suggested to go elsewhere. \n\nBUT I will say, the food was the savior to the whole experience! The wait staff was very well trained on the knowledge of the menu - I was impressed. I realize a majority (if not all) of the staff is Chinese, and not Japanese...but they knew their stuff, and that's all you can really ask for. They were speaking fairly quickly, but I caught most of it. It was a nice touch to leave the menu at the table to keep track of what's what too. \n\nFor $78, the entire omakase experience is pretty affordable, in comparison to others. They have an additional $35 a la carte add-on for 5 more pieces, but I opted to choose my own. All three uni options! Which were simply divine. Would I come back? Absolutely!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-06", "description": "Delicious birthday dinner! My boyfriend made reservations for the 6pm seating a month in advance & requested bar seating for the full, Kaiseki style, omakase experience. Another condition for bar seating is to make sure you're on time as much as possible. You will have to provide credit card info in order to complete the reservation because they automatically charge $90 pp for any cancellations within 48 hrs before the reservation & no-shows. For parking, I'd have to advise against parking on Willow St. because it's a very dirty, sketchy alley. Luckily our car remained safe but it's not a guarantee for everyone. We arrived quite early & the hostess/servers were kind enough to let us sit/wait inside & provided refreshments until they finished up preparations.\n\nOur chef for the evening was Chef Gavin & he was friendly, interactive & informative. The appetizer course was light, refreshing & palette cleansing but the standout for me was definitely the scallops. The nigiri courses were AMAZING & some of the best I've ever had, if not the best. The proportion of fish to rice was perfection. My boyfriend enjoyed their sushi rice so much that he wished that he could order a whole bowl of it! Their menu changes daily according to what's available & what's in season but if you're a true sushi enthusiast, trust, you'll most likely enjoy whatever they serve you. During the omakase, some of my favorites included Kanpachi (Amberjack), Hon Maguro (Blue Fin Tuna), Shima Aji (Striped Jack), & Chu-toro (Medium Fat Blue Fin Tuna). Although these were my favorites, every piece was delicious & there wasn't a single piece I didn't like. If I had to choose pieces that were my least favorite, it might be the nigiri's that were seared/slightly torched. The taste was smoky, well prepared & not overly done but personally, I prefer sushi that is light, fresh & raw. We were nervous about not having soy sauce & wasabi but we didn't need them at all as everything was flavorful & prepared meticulously well. \n\nTowards the end of the 12 courses of nigiri, they'll ask if you'd like to opt for either of the two Supplements or anything a la carte. As we were still decently hungry, we decided to go all out & ordered the Exclusive Supplement ($58 for 7 additional pieces) & I am sooo happy that we did. Most of the a la carte items I wanted to try were included in the supplement so it worked out very well. The first 2 pieces aren't named on the menu as they were the chef's choices, Muki Hotate (Hokkaido Scallop) & Zuwaigani (Hokkaido Snow Crab with Miso Butter).These 2 were probably my absolute favorites from the entire meal & I could've eaten like 5x more orders of them. At the end of the entire meal, we felt content but not disgustingly full even after the initial 18 & then the 7 added on.\n\nOverall, the meal & service was exquisite. The restaurant has nice, modern decor & the ambiance was lovely. The only complaint that my boyfriend & I had was that the pace of our meal, along with the other patrons that were served by Chef Gavin, was going quite slowly. The meal of patrons that were served by the other chefs were going much quicker than ours. By the time we were starting the optional Supplemental courses, all the other patrons were on dessert. When we got our dessert, the people who were doing the 8:30 seating had already arrived & were waiting for us to finish up so they could get seated. As a result, I couldn't really eat my dessert at my leisure & felt incredibly rushed. I don't think I would've minded as much if the pace of the meal was matched with the other chefs/patrons so we wouldn't be awkwardly remaining. Most Kaiseki style, omakase meals do run at a fairly slow pace & lasts about 2 hrs but that's a part of the experience so patience is key!", "author": "Sarah C."}

The chef serving us took at least 5 shots/drinks of alcohol while serving us with other guests.  If you believe that fine motor skills are not affected after alcohol consumption, then this review will be of no value to you.  After reading previous lower rated reviews, it seems to not be an uncommon occurrence.\n\nFew things bother me more than someone putting down their competitors to bring themselves up.  Our chef began to brag about his previous work experience at Michelin Star restaurants.  Subsequently, he began to downplay the significance of these rated restaurants, how they are overpriced, and mostly hype.  Whether that's true or not may be a matter of personal opinion, but there is no need to express these feelings in that manner. Hinata should really let their service, food, and dining experience speak for itself.  \n\nThe decor, interior design, and cleanliness of Hinata is top notch.

It's also very generous and reasonably priced (for now): $78 gets you 18 (!!) courses! The experience is also lovely: most of the seating is at a bar where you're served by what feels to be your personal chef (one chef per four guests), if you order sake you get to pick your own sake glass (oh and by the way, when you order a bottle of sake...it's wine bottle sized! If you're ambitious you can even get a magnum), and even the chopsticks are monogrammed with their logo. There is clearly a lot of thought put into the little nuances of the restaurant.\n\nSo now the sushi!\n- appetizer of tofu, scallop, snow crab, and seaweed pur\u00e9e. Scallop and snow crab were standouts.\n- 12 nigiri courses. Kampachi, butterfish, maguro, cherry blossom trout, firefly squid, baby red snapper, striped jack, ocean trout, Spanish mackerel, kinmedai, chopped fatty tuna, soy sauce cured seared fatty tuna. Standouts for me were maguro, cherry blossom trout, baby red snapper, striped jack, ocean trout, kinmedai, and the last fatty tuna, but everything was amazing.\n- add ons: wagyu and deep sea Hokkaido sea urchin. Both expensive, both oh so worth it (especially the uni. Splurge and get the Hokkaido one!)\n- surprise! Free tamago. Very cakey like real tamago should be.\n- fish broth with miso and mushroom\n- matcha panna cotta with black sugar glaze. Nice heavy matcha flavor without being too sweet.\n- surprise! Free yuzu sorbet to share. So incredibly refreshing and clearly made in house.\n\nThe other absolute joy was watching our sushi chef Master (yes, that is his name) hard at work. He was funny, energetic, and oh so good at what he does. Being able to be so close and able to see everything really made the experience even more special. \n\nAmazing fish, great dining experience, and good value.

Reservations, seating, menu explanation - all seamless. Our group of 6 sat at the bar, so we got some nice narrative from the chef. To me, food always taste better when you get to enjoy a little knowledge infused into it. \n\nThe interior space was simplistic and relaxing. I couldn't locate the waving Maneki-neko and Daruma doll so I knew this was going to be an extraordinary kinda place. Bar seating for 12 and another 12 in tables. Two seatings (6pm & 8:30pm) per night Tuesday through Sunday. \n\nThe majority of the seafood comes from Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market. The rice is short grain from Sacramento Valley. The variety & uniqueness of fish from Tsukiji really made the meal stand out. Not exactly omakase in the true sense, because you're given an evening's menu as you're seated, so if you want to be surprised by what's being served, simply flip it around. \n\nThe seafood was very fresh (except for things fermented obviously) and intricately woven with rice, delectable garnishes & shoyu. With the pieces placed in front of you, take a moment to feast with the eyes, pick it up and pop it into your mouth to enjoy. If the 18 pieces of yumminess don't satisfy your belly, there's the Supplement menu and/or \u00c0 la carte menu to help fill in the gaps. Also, highly recommend the Kokuryu Kuzuryu Junmai \"Nine-Headed Dragon\" & Tedorigawa Kinka \"Gold Blossom\" sakes.

The braised octopus was my favorite because it was super tender and delicious. The nigiri fish selection was super fresh and prepared well, just that nothing blew me away. They used the same soy sauce for all the nigiris. It was just okay. There were 2 highlights of the night and both were on the additional a la carte menu, Kegani and O-Toro Remix. The Kegani is the Hokkaido horse hair crab meat with miso crab butter. The richness of the miso crab butter enhanced the salty sweetness of the crab meat. The O-Toro Remix is pure decadence.

I'm so confused after seeing all the awesome reviews from other Yelpers for Hinata. I'm not sure if this means if my palate is off, or that I've just been too spoiled from my time in Japan. My friend made reservations a few weeks in advance, and we came for the early seating on a Saturday night. They only have one option now, which is the Omakase ($78/person, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JV15FXf1lLRU25NEyOjibw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg)- You receive 4 small \"appetizers\" (more like bites), 12 pieces of nigiri, and a choice from 3 different desserts. They also have a supplemental menu that you can order additional pieces of nigiri from (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bX81SW-5oVj_qWWohvow2g&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg), but you don't get much fish on the nigiri. My friend and I were both still hungry after our meal.\n\nOur omakase consisted of:\n\nAppetizers\n-Hokkaido Tofu w/Ginger, Wasabi, Salmon Roe / Seared Hokkaido Scallop w/Miso Aioli / Ice Fish w/Wakame, Cucumber / Vinegar Cured Fresh Okinawa Silky Seaweed (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nUfgkEjLkEX5tHAsi-4YXA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The tofu was solid, but the seared scallop was definitely the most delicious bite here. It was creamy, and perfectly cooked- I wish we had more than one piece! The ice fish was just ok, but the vinegar seaweed was way too tart and very difficult to eat.\n\nSushi\n[https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CeTSbVTjdOBBTuUtLSDr_Q&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]\n-Kanpachi/Amber Jack: Fresh, but nothing special.\n Hirame/Flounder: I didn't like this since it had shiso in it and was very lean.\n-Hon Maguro: Very lean, but this is one of the better versions I've had since it actually had flavor.\n-Bincho/Albacore Tuna: I liked the sear on this\n-Ebodai/Japanese Butter Fish: Great sear and flavor.\n-Kasugodai/Baby Red Snapper: Good flavor.\n[https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JTkU5yrT52gYAUGB4OvjsQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]\n-Shima Aji/Stripe Jack: Very smooth and clean tasting.\n-Umi Masu/Ocean Trout: Nice and buttery.\n-Sawara/Spanish Mackerel Smoked w/Cherry Wood: Had an interesting smoke flavor and not fishy for mackerel.\n-Kamasu: Japanese Barracuda: Super smoky, and had a nice sear.\n-Negitoro: Fatty Blue Fin Tuna w/Pickle Daikon: The pickled daikon gave this an interesting flavor and texture. The blue fin was nice and fatty.\n-Chu Toro: Medium Fatty Blue Fin Tuna: Yum, nice and fatty.\n\n-A la carte: Santa Barbara Uni Nigiri ($9, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=55f_eZ6caZkJ_Mkp1RqYPA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The uni was very sweet, but they don't give you much of it.\n\n-Owan: Fish Broth w/Red Miso, Nameko, Mitsuba (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RQQdG7DdOgzPSuN0fy2R5w&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok- I'm not a fan of red miso since the flavor is too strong.\n\nDessert\n-Matcha Panna Cotta w/Okinawa Black Sugar Syrup (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WbaJ4VfpQLsbyPAmBr8dAQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- this dessert was one of my favorites dishes from the meal.

Dinner was a bit awkward since our sushi chef spent most of the time trying to flirt with the girls sitting next to us. Since you can overhear everything your neighbors are saying, it was like being third wheel on a bad date that you had to pay over $100 for. Based on this experience, I won't be back to Hinata.

You step onto the sidewalk and notice 2 dark, tinted doors with a small sign. Its easy to pass by and you would never think twice about what's inside because of its plain facade. When I opened the door, I was immediately taken by its classic, sleek, and modern look. Picture walking into a closet full of clothes and shoes all in your size. Every girl's dream. Only, I was walking into a closet full of sushi. My type of dream.\n\nMy boyfriend made reservations at the bar to celebrate our 2 year anniversary and after surprising me with dinner here, it reminded me that I had a keeper on my hands lol. It was a special occasion, so we wanted to get sake. The chef recommended the Kinka/\"Golden Blossom\" because it's in between a dry and sweet sake. It was really easy to drink. My boyfriend was trying to take shots of sake with me. Please don't be that guy.\n\nWe had the honor of having Chef Master (yes, that is his real name, I totally asked him) serve us. He made us really comfortable and explained everything. I like to ask alot of questions because I love sushi and he was very kind and personable. \n\nOut of all the omakase's I've had, Hinata takes 1st place. Usually there are 1 or 2 pieces I don't enjoy, but at Hinata, I seriously fell in love with every piece of nigiri. Literally everything melts in your mouth with exceptional fish quality. Every piece of nigiri is made with perfection and you can witness the process of how its made right in front of you. The general omakase menu starts at $78, which is one of the best deals I've ever heard of. The supplemental menu and a la carte are additional. We opted for trying some things on the *a la carte menu. \n\nMy personal favorites:\n-Seared hokkaido scallop\n-*Wagyu A5MBS\n-*Bafun Uni\n-Bincho\n-Zuke Chu Toro\n-Sawara\n-Kanpachi\n-I liked the black sea same ice cream waaay better than the panna cotta\n\nThe menu changes constantly, so these items may not be in season. Trust me, everything is amazing!\n\n***PRO TIP***: place the fish side of the nigiri on your tongue. Basically, flip it upside down so the fish lands on your palate. It's a better experience because you taste more of the fish rather than the rice. \n\nHappy eating!", "author": "Rachelle Y."}

After getting seated, we were handed warm towels for a quick cleanser for your hands and serviced pretty quickly. We did make reservations a month or two back, and got a seat at the chef's table. \n\nEveryone was pretty friendly, and our chef was nice. We felt very comfortable, and treated well. The omakase was delicious! It is on the cheaper end, but the quality was still pretty good - definitely a bargain. Each dish was explained, and well made. We went with the standard course without any additions - we're not huge eaters, so we were decently full by the end of the course. It's hard to pick which part of the meal I enjoyed most, everything was wonderful and I had a great experience overall. \n\nThe restaurant isn't huge, but there are a few tables if you'd like to just stop by for dinner (it was pretty full when we got there at 6pm). Decor was nicely themed, and everything looked clean. \n\nLocation-wise, we didn't drive there so I'm not sure about parking (it's SF after all), but it's on a pretty major road so you could get there by public transportation with no issues.", "author": "Alice K."}

It's soo worth it.\n\nDrink - we ordered a big sake bottle that was $100. \n\nOur bill came out to be $600ish, pretty expensive but that's because each of us got the supplement and ordered that big bottle of sake too.

In fact, none really like this so maybe I'm reviewing high because I don't have a whole ton to compare. The other place I've tried is Sushi Sam's in San Mateo, but the ambiance and service is nowhere like Hinata. If you're not a complete sushi snob and have not had a whole ton of omakases to reflect on, I think you'd have an amazing time here as I did! \n\nWent on a girls' night out with fellow Yelp Elite Yue L. because we were in search of good sushi! We had actually wanted to check out Yume in Alameda but there were many rumors of it still being closed :( Sad day. So, we stumbled upon Hinata through Yelp. What a good thing too because we had such a wonderful dinner!\n\nThe ambiance is modern and clean/simple. But look out for the address because the entrance is very non-obtrusive and we walked right past it! It was like...in Harry Potter when all the muggles walk past Platform 9 and 3/4 without a second thought and couldn't see the magical world on the other side!\n\nService was phenomenal, as all the servers are great and the hostess Cynthia especially was good at explaining and answering all our questions. We always had full water glasses and they kept swapping out our tea with hot mugs. We were even given a little taste test of sakes because we could not decide which one we wanted to order. And good thing too because the one the waitress was recommending ended up being the one we didn't like as much! We got the nine-dragon which went very smoothly and I didn't think it was dry at all. It had just the right amount of that rice wine flavor to round it out. $20 for an 8 oz which was perfect to share between two of us who don't drink that much. The sake shot glasses were beautiful colorful glasses!\n\nThe 18 course omakase is $78 and starts off with 4 appetizers (my fav was the oyster and Hokkaido scallop...and note: I don't normally like oysters.) Then the nigiri sets start with 2 pieces at a time, with descriptions from the servers and even the head chef sometimes would come by to explain. I felt like the service was so warm and friendly and intimate. Though we wanted a bar seat, I didn't realize that we couldn't choose when we got there. Perhaps next time I'll book through calling instead of the Yelp Reservations? But the table was still nice and I didn't feel cramped or too close to my neighbors which can sometimes be a problem.\n\nALL the fish was good and I think the only one I didn't like as much was the Iwashi which was the only piece I actually felt like it was fishy and had some soft bones in it. My friend enjoyed it but it just wasn't my cup of tea. Everything else was bomb, including the kampachi, the blue fin tuna, the chu toro, and one of the fish had a yuzu zest/juice that was fantastic.\n\nI like that they don't push the supplement on you until the end when you actually can gauge how full you are. We opted to go for the extra $36 supplement because I really wanted the O-toro (different than chu-toro) and the wagyu BMS grade 10. Uni was also something I was contemplating. I think I agreed with our hostess that I like Santa Barbara uni better than the Bara Uni from Russia which is way creamier. But it was good regardless. I could have done without the started seaweed shot. The supplement can be a good deal if you are able to eat more and want the o-toro and wagyu. Or else you can order it a la carte. \n\nFor dessert I had the matcha panna cotta and my friend had the black sesame ice cream. Both were good but I think I would love to try the yuzu sherbet next time! \n\nWe had a great time at the 6pm seating and I would love to come back another time! 24 seats each seating and 2 times each night. I would say if you are an earlier sleepier, definitely choose the earlier seating as our meal ran over 2.5 hours. The 8:30 seating may have to wait a little for the 6pm seating to finish up.

Since I went with two people, we ordered all three desserts so that we did not need to make a decision--matcha panna cotta, black sesame ice cream and yuzu sorbet. I really liked the matcha panna cotta--super strong matcha taste and not overly sweet. Really refreshing and clean up your pallet. My boyfriend and his sister loved the black sesame ice cream--again, strong sesame taste and pretty rich but don't feel overwhelming or fatty.

Of course, there a few here and there we were indifferent with. Favorites were the sawara, kamasu and chu toro. The nigiris are pre-seasoned, so no soy sauce needed, and served two at a time (or one by one if you're at the bar). \n\nWe also opted for supplements ($20) at the end. Supplement B included o-toro and Bafun uni which where both a m a z i n g. I used to dislike uni but I've been exposed to some pretty darn good uni lately. My only gripe was that Joanne Y. got Supplement A and the timing to serve was off and one person would always wait a while for the other's to come out. \n\nI was a fan of both the black sesame ice cream and matcha panna cotta desserts.

I was bummed because interacting with the chefs is the best part - an omakase experience would feel incomplete without this.

After checking out the website, I made my reservation through Yelp for an 8:30 PM seating on a Friday night.\n \nWe arrived a few minutes early, so we sat in the lobby.  The hostess offered us hot tea, as well as the sake menu.  We accepted the tea graciously while we perused the sake menu.  When the waitress came to take us to our table, she wished us a happy anniversary (always make sure to mention any special occasions when making a reservation).\n \nWe sat at a table in the back, away from the rest of the patrons.  Hinata is quite intimate, with seating for about 20 or 25.  Our menus were already on our table (and our mouths started watering in anticipation after perusing it), and we ordered hot tea and cold sake.\n \nShortly, our food arrived in stages.  Each course was explained in detail by the server or chef.  The appetizers were served all together (4 on the plate), then the nigiri two at a time.  Before the soup course ended the savory dishes, we were offered the a la carte menu, if we wanted to order any additional dishes.  Finally, we had a choice of 3 desserts.  The highlights for that night were:\n \n*  The shoyu braised octopus appetizer had a texture unlike any other octopus dish I've ever had.  Instead of the expected chewy consistency , it had a more pleasant mouthfeel, softer and easy to bite through.  It was surprisingly delightful, especially for my wife, who doesn't prefer octopus or squid.\n\n*  The Spanish mackerel and Japanese barracuda were served together, making for a perfect pairing.  These were the best two bites of the evening, tasting like the sea, stronger than most of the other nigiri, but not too overpowering.\n\n*  Off the a la carte menu, we shared Supplement A.  She enjoyed the Bafun uni (sea urchin), while I was treated to Satsuma Wagyu beef.  In their own unique ways, these bites were luxurious and decadent.  \n\n*  The soup course (served at the end of the meal) was really refreshing, especially after all the seafood we consumed.\n\n*  Lastly, we ordered the black sesame ice cream (for me) and the matcha panna cotta with okinawa black sugar syrup (for her).  The ice cream was really dense, while the panna cotta was light, but not overly sweet, even with the syrup.  The desserts came on a tray with a cute Happy Anniversary card, accompanied with 2 glasses of sparkling wine (on the house).  \n \nThroughout the evening, the service was very attentive, but not too intrusive.  The servers came by regularly, offering fresh cups of hot tea to replace our empty ones.  The evening was perfect, a cool 2 hours of wonderfully exquisite (mostly seafood) courses.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

Sushi bar is by when you make the reservation so if you want to sit at the sushi bar try to make reservations early. \n\nService: (5 stars) our sushi was prepared by Gavin. His technique with preparation of all our dishes were fantastic. Beautiful plating and impressive knife skills.\n\nFood: (4 stars) if I had to do it again I would say stick to the regular $78 omakase (18 item). I Think this was good value but the added dishes I thought were not worth it. My sister and I added the ($35) supplement. Came with Uni, snow crab, o-toro remix (o-toro with added uni on top), shirayaki-eel, and Tamago. \n\nOverall good experience. Fish was fresh but just with a lot of the fishes getting seared, they all started to taste a bit the same.", "author": "Mel S."}

Yes, Amami has an omakase set for cheaper but it does not come with the experience and the special crafting by the chefs. We did end up ordering the supplements (5 pieces each) so we ended up spending close to $150/person.\n\nQuality: Good\nI am not a huge fan of seared fish; some chefs overdo the searing. However, the Seared O Toro w/ Uni was AMAZING. It totally melts in your mouth. I highly recommend trying some of their items on the supplement list. The fish is a little smaller than most places but the price is cheaper too. \n\nService: The sushi chef was attentive and very generous. He did take the time to converse with us when he had the time.

Sat at the sushi bar (make sure to request it when you book online) and Chef Master (yes, Master is his name) was our sushi chef. He was so much fun and super friendly. It was a nice change of ambiance from other omakase restaurants where its so quiet you could hear a pin drop.\n\nWe opted for the $78 omakase and then my bf and I each got one of the supplement menus.  Highlights were the cherry trout, ocean trout, blue fin tuna, spanish mackerel, chu toro. The toro remix from the supplement menu was the best bite of the night (chu toro topped with seared uni and gold flakes).

The waitress offered no remorse and simply said that the bar is fully reserved and assured us that we'd be able to see the action from our seats. Unfortunately, the table she sat us at was behind a giant pillar so you couldn't even see any of chefs and left the table extremely dark. \n\n- We ordered the Omakase set with an extra order of wagyu and tamago and we still left hungry. The food was pretty good but the portions were definitely tiny! I get that this is sushi but I hate paying $100+ per person (with tip) and still leaving unsatisfied.

It is at tenderloin which was a bit scary walking in the dark with a dress on.\nThe omakase menu however is quite good for the price. Fish is fresh ( many white fish), and you can see chef is trying to innovate, but still space for improvement.\nI love the uni but it was not part of the omakase, but the add on menu which had Wagyu uni crab and toro I believe.

MUST MUST ORDER.\n\nOmakase:\n-4 bite size appetizers.. ocean trout was my fave here.\n-12 pieces nigiri - amberjack, flounder, Bluefin tuna, Fujisan trout, sweet fish, Spanish mackerel smoked, baby red snapper, striped jack, golden snapper, Japanese barracuda, cured chu toro\n-fish broth\n-choice of 3 desserts. I had the black sesame ice cream which was so good and my bf had the matcha panna cotta which was good too but we both preferred the black sesame ice cream over it.\n\nDownside? The nigiri that came with the omakase didn't include some of the heavier fish that I like at the end of the course, like otoro, uni, sea eel, etc. Their finale was chu toro, which essentially forces you to order extra pieces! Also, much of the fish had a smoked flavor to it. Maybe it was just the day I went, or maybe it was chef's preferences (Chef David did seem to love that blow torch), but I actually thought there was a little too much smokiness to the meal, and a little under seasoned for some of our fish. Also, I didn't really like that one chef was preparing fish for 6 people at once. He would torch them all at the same time, and it just felt a little less personalized compared to those who will serve one party only (of 2 or maybe 4 max).. I came with 1 other, so the other 4 people he served with us were strangers. \n\nExtra pieces: We didn't do a supplement ($32), but we had 3 extra pieces of our choice instead ($13-14 each). They... were..... OUT OF THIS WORLD....\n-o toro remix: torched fatty o toro with uni on top.. melt in your mouth deliciousness.\n-kama toro: a limited special kind of fatty tuna topped with sturgeon caviar and gold flakes (so fancy!) .. I actually liked this even better than the o toro remix.\n-wagyu a5: a marbled fatty piece of wagyu torched in some wagyu fat.. seasoned with sea salt, pepper, and topped with shaved truffle.. MUST MUST MUST MUST ORDER THIS. So heavenly. I'm drooling just thinking about this.\n\nFor two people-- omakase, 3 extra pieces each, and some house sake, the total came out to $274 not including tip. We left REALLY full and we both can eat a lot too. \n\nCall ahead to guarantee bar seating with your reservation.. because omakase can't be done any other way.", "author": "Lucille L."}

You may scoff, but I've been told I need to get help by some close friends.  Of course, some of those friends are enablers, going with me to these restaurants or taking my reservations when I can't make it. On my latest reservation mishap, I forgot I made a reservation for Hinata about six weeks in advance, and was reminded when I got a text message to confirm.  The main problem - my husband's schedule changed so he wouldn't be able to make it.  After being unable to find a friend to take his place, my daughter stepped in to go with me. Lucky me, or actually, lucky her.\n\nUpon arriving for the 5:30 PM seating, we checked in and took a seat in the waiting area.  The place has a dark, but minimalist style, which was quietly comforting.  We felt at ease and appreciated the casualness of the place.  Weida was our chef and he was very friendly and entertaining.  Since this was my daughter's first omakase experience, she was excited and took a ton of pictures.  Weida was good at helping set up some of the pictures, even using the crab body shell as a backdrop for her.  We went with the regular omakase menu for $78, which felt like a bargain for the 18 piece menu.  A person next to us ordered the grand omakase, which I would probably order next time.  Each piece that was served to us was so fresh and delicious.  I anticipated the taste of each piece so much that while my daughter was taking her pictures, I was picking up my nigiri to devour.  It was that good!  \n\nThis is a great place for date night or for a small gathering of friends.  I'm still not sure if I would order the grand omakase or just stick with the regular as there is an a la carte menu provided right before dessert. You can order any of the additions, or order one of your favorites from the regular menu.    Many thanks to Weida for making our experience fantastic.  I hope to come back again soon!", "author": "Maria S."}

It's a small Omakase sushi restaurant that only has two seatings a night. 5:30 pm and 8 pm Hinata is located near the corner of Eddy and Van Ness. Reservations are harder to come by as the popularity and 5 star reviews grow. The space decor is very simple and clean with high ceilings. The daily Omakase starts at $78 and there are two options of additions $25 and $35 along with individual fish items.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-03", "description": "This place was so excellent; possibly one of my favorite omakases in the city right now. It's got the perfect balance of a reasonable price point ($78!! you just don't find that in the city) with really well executed nigiri pieces. I was also really impressed at how Hinata served quite a number of fish that I hadn't tried across the other omakases that I've been to in the city. Hats off to the main chef (didn't catch his name :( ) but he was super nice, really friendly, and just a joy to talk to. \n\nHinata starts off with a few small appetizer dishes that were pretty good. I don't normally like appetizer dishes with omakase but these were more of the sashimi variety so I didn't mind it at all. Then there's a reasonable omakase list and you can add more fish as you desire. \n\nI don't see the point in going into every single fish that I had, but I'll do an overview of the ones that were really memorable for me:\n1. Firefly squid -- I've never had this before, but this was delicious. It looks a little weird as a dish since you can see the little squids that you're eating, but so good. \n2. Ocean trout -- I was really impressed with the umi masu here because chef prepares it a bit differently than other restaurants -- he sears half the fish so you have a nice touch of both the raw flavor of the salmon trout as well as a seared flavor. Really nice contrast. \n3. Mackeral -- this one I mention more out of interest. So unlike most people, I love the fishy taste of mackeral though I know that most people don't. Somehow chef's preparation of it removes the fishy taste. Depends on if you think it's good or not?\n\nOverall, every piece of nigiri was so simply and thoughtfully composed that I really loved every piece. The rice was just right, the fish pieces were generous, and the portion is delightful for the price. One of the my favorite omakases in the city.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

We walked into the modern, high ceiling establishment and our group of four sat at a table, not the bar. We all elected the 18 course meal which was pretty easy to get thru portion wise and ordered some supplements after. \n\nThe highlights were the uni with caviar and hokkaido scallops. The scallop was probably the best I've tasted as the texture was smooth and cleanly broke as I chewed. Interesting but not my fave were the braised octopus which was chewy like meat and the baby squids which had a surprisingly sweet flavor. On the flip side, I didn't like how they seared the chu toro. \n\nI would definitely come here again and sit at the bar next time.", "author": "Young Y."}

The initial omakase is pretty filling for an average stomach capacity already. But for the big fat greedy person I am, I added the supplements at the end plus a few extra essentials, such as the uni+ikura bowl. I was so full and satisfied in the end. \n\nPrice:\nVery reasonable. The omakase itself was only $78. Adding all the supplements and extra stuff, probably around $120-150 per person total including tips and tax. It's literally the cheapest Omakase that's both high quality and filling.

Laverne N. made an impromptu dinner reservation for a Saturday night. Unfortunately, we weren't able to sit at the bar which was a real bummer. Apparently, bar seating is available to customers in order of who makes their reservations the earliest. \n\nThe omakase for the night encompassed 18 items (listed in order below):\n\n1. Appetizers - shoyu braised octopus, ocean trout with shiso/myoga/kizami wasabi, seared hokkaido scallop with miso aioli, and snow crab leg with Japanese cucumber and kumquat\n\n2. Kanpachi (amber jack) and tai (red snapper)\n\n3. Hon maguro (blue fin tuna) and kasugodai (baby red snapper with pan-fried egg yolk)\n\n4. Hotaru ika (baby firefly squid) and sakura masu (cherry trout) \n\n5. Hirame (flounder) and ayu (sweet fish)\n\n6. Sawara (Spanish mackerel, cherry wood smoked) and kamasu (Japanese barracuda)\n\n7. Chu toro (medium fatty blue fin tuna) and shoyu ikura (cured salmon roe with rice) \n\n8. Owan (fish broth with red miso and nameko mushroom) \n\n9. Dessert - you choose one between yuzu sorbet, black sesame ice cream, or matcha panna cotta with Okinawa black sugar syrup (Laverne N. and I chose the latter two) \n\nWe also decided to order both Supplements A and B for our meals. I personally tried Supplement A, which included: kegani (hokkaido horse hair crab with miso crab butter) and satsuma wagyu a5 bms, which was served with gold flakes.\n\nPersonal favorites: wagyu a5, chu toro, sakura masu, hon maguro, kanpachi, ocean trout, and the seared hokkaido scallop! \n\nMy only gripes about my experience here (besides not being able to sit at the bar) would be the size of the nigiri and the awkward, long timing in between the dishes.

I was not allowed to sit at the counter, so I sat at the chairs near the front door. When le bf showed up around 5:55pm, we were seated at the counter. While waiting to sit, it seemed like the 3 sushi chefs were still preparing for the meal. \n\nWhat was different at this omakase place, compared to all the ones that I have been to before, was that the prep for your meal was more of an assembly line and the chef we sat in front of, didn't interact much with us at all. I could barely hear what kind of nigiri was placed in front of me. I was really taken aback because this was such a vastly different experience.\n\nThe interaction and prep aside, the variety of fish you got, was all very high quality and tasted really, really good.

Oh how I wish I came here when the omakase was $78 instead of $90 now!).\n\nI don't believe there was a sign on the storefront, so the restaurant might be easy to miss if you're not looking straight into the glass doors. Entering the restaurant, it gave me a classy homely feel: comfy sofa chairs, digital fireplace, cozy waiting area. We got there at 5:30 and got seated approximately 5:45. \n\nThe hostess asked us for food restrictions beforehand, and they were very mindful of that (I'm grateful!). Once seated, we ordered our sake and she gave us her recommendations and input (she was knowledgeable all around). Throughout the night, our hostess would check up on us and we also had great conversation. She took excellent care of us. Five stars for service!  \n\nThe first plate that came out was the appetizer: can I just say how much I LOVED the fresh scallop! I have never cared for scallop but absolutely fell in love with this small piece of deliciousness. I won't go into detail about every piece of sushi we ate (and I honestly can't remember either), but I would rate the sushi here a 7/10. A step higher than average, but nothing amazing. Oh, I would also like to add that I thought the amount of wasabi that they had in each piece was perfect. The meal ended with miso soup (nothing spectacular either) and dessert. Black sesame ice cream.....mm mm mmm....yum.\n\nThe chef came to our table in the end and introduced himself to us so we were appreciative of that as well. \n\nI think Hinata would be a solid choice for date night/hanging with the girls based on the atmosphere and service.

I love the interior decor which is modern Japanese. Definitely is a plus to pull you into the ambiance of the restaurant from the busy bustle of Van Ness St.\n\nI wanted to enjoy a nice bottle of champagne and I picked a moderately priced bottle and unfortunately it tasted like a cheap safeway bottle that was way too overpriced. I think good sushi should accompany sake or wine selection that can bring your experience to another level but the poor selection of drinks brought the initiation of my experience down a level and fully disappointed. \n\nSo I went with the $78 omakase - I think my experience was not consistent. There a few outstanding sushi that I absolutely enjoyed but others were mediocre. \n\nThe chefs were super fun and accommodating though and dessert was amazing. \n\nI don't think I would go back unfortunately.", "author": "Sarah K."}

We are both on the lookout for the omakase, and this place did not disappoint us. \nThey have two seating times 6 pm and 8:30 pm, dinner took about 2 hours for the standard omakase meal + 5 sushi course supplement. We usually don't drink any alcohol as it affects our taste perception. \nThe entrance is unassuming, on Van Ness street, no parking, so uber/bus/scooter here. \nIt's very spacious place inside, with very high ceilings, so a tip for my future visit is to wear warm clothes and layer, it gets cold inside too. \nWe sat at the sushi bar, as always if you go for omakase, make sure you seat close to the distribution center. \nThe chef we had was entertaining and chatty, we were not into small talk and ignored his conversation attempts and he spent the evening talking to other 4 people he was serving on his serving corner. \nNow the food - we started off with 4-course appetizers, which were ok, I will give it 3 stars, nothing that impressed me or stayed in my memory. \nSushi though courses, were great. I hate when people say \"fish was fresh!\" yeah you don't want super fresh fish, it has to relax a bit, get a bit of aging going to really open up all the flavors. Which here they do right.\nFollowed up with the red miso soup, and a small dessert selection. \nat $140 including tip per person, I think it is a good value, and I would put it on my I will visit again list on par with Wako, yet this place is much closer to my home", "author": "Anelya S."}

You will not regret sitting by the sushi bar and get entertained by conversing and laughing with them. \n\nI was never a fan of uni until i tried this place.

You bet she was ecstatic and practically bouncing off the walls in joy. To top it off - our dinner at Hinata was very satisfying and service was of course excellent. Extra props to Chef Gavin (originally from j\u016b-ni) because he made our experience so enjoyable, was compliant with my mom's demanding requests, and most importantly prepared our fish in a timely manner. I've experienced waiting for more than 25 minutes between each serving, but Chef Gavin managed to serve 4 people without any delays. My family and I were actually pretty amazed at how quickly he was able to serve each dish.\n\nNow onto the food - we opted for the Grand Omakase which was 23 courses for $108 and Supplement A for $20. Sounds like a sweet deal to me! It's actually probably the best priced omakase in SF in my opinion. I listed a few of my favorites below:\n\n1. Kampachi (white fish)\n2. Red Snapper\n3. Cherry Blossom Trout - butter and creamy. One of my favs!\n4. Spanish Mackerel - an interesting smoky taste to it.\n5. Spanish Barracuda w/ sesame oil\n6. Chu Toro - 1/2 seared and 1/2 raw. Another one of my favorites - I loved the mixture of hot and cold with the smokiness taste from the fish being torched.\n7. Shoyu Ikura - so fresh and so good!\n\nThe only part of my experience I was eh about was the fact that the same fish was served for multiple dishes (out of 23). In a way I did love it because I was able to eat some of my favorites and more of the expensive stuff like the uni, salmon belly, fatty tuna, caviar, and gold flakes. However we also opted for the 23 course menu because we wanted to try more variety and more unique fish. Maybe this was because the selection of fish they had for the day? Not sure, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that this was the case.\n\nOther than that, I know that every individual person in my family loved their experience!

After learning their recent opening, we made reservation for 5:30pm on a Saturday for an early Valentine's day dinner. Requested to be seated at the bar where we can watch the chef prepare our dinner one piece at the time. \n\nOn the day of our reservation, we arrived just about 5pm; we were early. We walked around Van Ness and checked out some of the car dealers. Around 5:25pm, we returned and was greeted by the host who happened to be one of our waitress as well. We were still a bit early, so we were seated in a waiting area close to the door. It was nice and spacious and looking out to the dining area. Keep in mind, this is a small restaurant. \n\nFew more minutes, we were invited to the bar. Excited as it could be, the first thing I noticed,  the two chefs are preparing the appetizers, and the head chef had already making his cut of the fish for the first few courses of the nigiri and it continues to the second, third and final nigiri courses. I wish they would just cut it at the time of serving. I know this save them time, but this is the first Omakase experience that I have been to that did not cut the fish at the time of serving. This made me a little bit worry of the taste due to the time that has been out sitting around. We also opted for supplement A $38.\n\nThe entire dinner took around 2.5 hours+. What I walked out from Hinata is....I had better, but for the price this is affordable. Give or take, this is a great deal if you are seeking an Omakase experience with no prior expectation. I recommended this place to my co-worker who never had Omakase before and he and his family loved it.", "author": "Maria H."}

Never thought toro and uni would go together, but somehow they do and don't compete for attention, highly recommend.  The A5 has a generous shaving of black truffle, but if you are expecting melt in your mouth beef, look elsewhere, H believes a lower marbling, BS8 is a better rendition, so it was more like a really good rare steak, I am partial to BS12.  \n\nThe O-toro was as expected, basically dissolved on my tongue.  The kaisui uni, so briney, clean and tasted of the ocean.  \n\nHopefully when the price goes up in the next month, they will incorporate some of these premium selections into the omakase, because they all really stood out.  \n\nThe music leant a casual vibe to the dining experience, which I was not opposed to, although I preferred the pre-open Fetty Wap over Third Eye Blind, Hootie and Backstreet Boys.

She da real MVP.\n\nWe were paired with Gavin, who used to work at Ju-Ni, and after doing a little research on him, I was expecting to go for an adventure in flavor, blending a fusion of new tastes on traditional style sushi/sashimi/nigiri. \n\nFor a whopping $78/pp (CHEAP by SF omakase standards), we were treated to 19 offerings. No soy sauce or wasabi will be provided for you (it's better this way, trust me), only ginger. Seeing as there were so many bites of fish to eat that night, I will just list the ones that stood out to me: \n\n- Kanisu: NOT because the snow crab tasted pristine and fresh, but because of the fresh seaweed. The silky texture served as a great opener to the rest of the ensuing offerings. \n\n- Ankimo: *low key otaku mode* I have made it a goal to try ankimo after watching one of the characters in the anime \"Shokugeki no Soma\" (Tadokoro Megumi, for those who know what I'm talking about) cut one up from a hanging hook for her Clay Pot Monk Fish Soup in a school competition. Anyway, I liked the slight burnt after-taste and the soft texture as well.\n\n- Tako: The soy sauce braised octopus. Very soft and slight salty taste to it. \n\n- Mozuku seaweed with sweet vinegar: This was essentially a palate cleanser in between the nigiri portion of the session. Pleasantly surprised at not only the presence of strawberries, but how well its sweetness clashed with the seaweed. \n\n- Sawara: I can't really explain why, I just like Spanish mackerel personally hahah.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the night. Every single offering was fresh, Gavin gave perfect insight into each offering, and he was precise with his food preparation. The waitresses were attentive with refilling the tea and I like how they provided a warm towel at the beginning of the 2.5-3 hour session. \n\nOh, and to each their own on the 90s music playlist, but I can definitely get down to eating sushi while Destiny's Child \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\" is playing in the background. \n\nIt's fun, it's different, and there's nothing wrong with that.

I dined at the bar with my friend Jackie D. and her boyfriend. We were served by Chef Master who was knowledgeable, funny, and skilled. \n\nEach Omakase course was like beautiful artwork. Each fish was glistening and gleaming like fine jewels. The appetizer course consisted 4 mini bites of Hokkaido tofu, braised octopus, king salmon, and a seared scallop. What a way to start!\n\nThe nigiri courses followed with amberjack, ocean trout, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, ayu, baby red snapper, three line grunt, Spanish mackerel, goldeneye snapper, Japanese barracuda, and chutoro.\n\nIt was followed with a small bowl of cured salmon roe and another bowl of light fish broth. Dessert had 3 selections upon which I chose the matcha panna cotta w/ Okinawa black sugar syrup. \n\nBut it didn't end there. I went for the supplement menu to try a few more items. 5 to be exact. Chef Master then delivered a bowl of sweet vinegar, strawberries, cucumber, and seaweed. A refreshing palate cleanser for what was to come. The king salmon belly was next. So buttery good. Then a heaping amount of uni wrapped in seaweed. The Hokkaido horse hair crab w/ miso crab butter followed. Chef Master passed around the Hokkaido horse hair crab shell to accentuate the photo opp. The supplement menu was capped off with a nigiri of seared otoro w/ wagyu tartare and shaved truffle. Magnificent. I couldn't end there though. Ordering from the a la carte side, I chose the nigiri of A5 wagyu and added shaved truffle with that. Now I was truly finished.\n\nI had to take one star off because of billing issues. The supplement menu wasn't added to my receipt. Being the kind-hearted, honest guy that I am, I reported it to Chef Master who had one of the wait staff correct it. When I got the new receipt, they charged me for 2 supplement menus. No bueno. So I had them correct that error. Although I was patient, it took a little too long to my liking. They had to call up the credit card company to get it fixed. It kind of put a downer on the end of the meal. But food-wise, Hinata is truly one of the omakase gems in SF.", "author": "Randy T."}

My favorite pieces were definitely the Wagyu beef piece with truffle and gold flakes. This piece was unreal; I still dream about it when I think of Omakase. The desert was great as well as a finishing piece, I had the Black Sesame Ice Cream and the Yuzu Sorbet that they kindly gave to us for free. \n\n[Sake]\nWe had a sake tasting as well as a couple bottles that my group brought as well.

So I'm gonna make a comparison.\n\nPORTION SIZE: Compare to KENZO in Napa @$255++/person and Morimoto@ $150++ per person, also with my recent trip to Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo Japan, Hinata's portion size was unbelievably tiny-microscopic, would not even be considered a kid size. \nAmaebi with a dash of sea urchin for $12/pc. was a joke!!! $78 ++ will leave you still hungry, which is wrong. My previous Omakases (Kenzo &Morimoto) left me without any room for dessert. The serving size in Hinata had not enough portions to leave your belly satisfied. You would want more but you'll have to pay min. of $8/pc of nigiri with size of about an inch long. \n\nTASTE: It seems like they were going for Kaiseki style. So compare to Kenzo in Napa, the supposedly clean and distinguishable ingredients of each item was not very palpable. However, if they're trying to convey fusion just like Morimoto, Hinata lacks ingenuity, creativity and imagination. \n\nSTAFF SERVICE: The girls were all great. Of course japanese are known for being polite and excellent customer service. \n  \nDo not come here if you're very hungry. Omakase is not for the hungry and impatient people. If you fancy pretty, petite and pricey food, this is the best place to bring a girl you're trying to impress.\n\nI'm sorry to say but Hinata will not get a Michelin star for simply having a very nice and elegant dining room.", "author": "Hazel C."}

The space, while not physically super small, has limited seating and does only set Omakase menus, so they have just a 6pm and an 8:30pm seating.  The value for money is tremendous - $78/person for 18 \"dishes,\" which is a much better value than Kusakabe and I'd argue that the food is pretty comparable.\n\nWe arrived promptly and, at first, were a bit worried that service wouldn't be good....it took us until just before 9pm to receive any food and the waitress seemed to have forgotten about our hot tea order.  However, our initial concerns were quickly proved wrong once service got started at 9pm.\n\nFrom 9:00-10:30pm, we received a pretty steady stream of food, albeit with adequate breaks between each plate to allow room for breathing.  We were also given constant refreshes on hot tea - in fact, each time they came around (pretty much with every \"course\"), they would give us a brand new cup of hot tea and take the old one away.\n\nI enjoyed literally everything I ate.  You get all the appetizers at one time, then you get the 12 pieces of nigiri in six \"courses\" of two, then you get an opportunity to order a la carte, then you get your soup, and then you have dessert.\n\nMy favorite Omakase nigiri items were the Shima Aji (striped Jack), Umi Masu (ocean trout), Hon Maguro (blue fin tuna), Kasugodai (baby red snapper), Ayu (sweet fish), Sawara (smoked Spanish mackerel), and Chu Toro (medium fatty blue fin tuna).  \n\nAfter we got through the Omakase nigiri, we did opt to order a la carte.  I would have been fine with just the Omakase menu, but my boyfriend was still a little hungry.  He did the $32 supplement, whereas I just ordered three more pieces of nigiri...Toro (blue fin tuna belly), Sake Toro (king salmon belly), and Kinmedai (golden eye snapper).  Of these, my favorite was by far the Sake Toro.\n\nThe soup was nice and light, and we really enjoyed all the desserts - they actually brought us out all three!  My favorite, however, was the matcha panna cotta.\n\nThe waitresses were SUPER friendly.  They explained everything in detail and were incredibly attentive.  Next time we go, I'd like to sit at the sushi counter, however, and see them make the food in more detail.\n\nTo the folks bashing this place because the chefs supposedly aren't Japanese.  I didn't ask anyone to pull out their passport, so I really don't know how you could \"know\" this, but more importantly.......does it matter?  Everything we ate was really good, super fresh, and nicely plated.  I personally haven't had much better high-end sushi, whether here, Seattle, New York, etc.  Seems like a really odd and potentially baseless criticism.", "author": "Tay H."}

Then, the kind waitress brought me a complimentary glass of bubbly and it was history. \n\nTwo small sake servings later, I offered our remaining dessert to the guy next to us and said in a \"whispering\" voice, \"Don't worry, we're STD free!\" \n\n*FACE PALM*\n\nAnd, you know damn well  \"whispering when drunk\" is like speaking with a phuckin' megaphone because I remember the sheer terror on my sober friend's face. Yah, you can't take me anywhere.\n\nOk, nobody cares about my drunken shenanigans...how was Hinata?\n\nSushi lovers know the best omakase deal in the Bay Area is Alan's $33 Omakase at one of the super casual Amami locations. Like Amami, Hinata is offering the best Omakase deal in the SF Bay Area but in a fine dining setting. For a mere $78 pp, you receive: Salad, Sashimi Course, Nigiri Course, Owan (soup), and dessert. There's also an a la carte menu with premium selections like A5 Wagyu, Otoro, Hokkaido Uni, etc. The menu and style is very similar to j\u016b-ni, and I recognized Chef Gavin that use to work there so it all made sense. Beer and sake only, and I like that you're able to order a 3 oz tasting of the sakes. \n\nReservations are a must. There's only two seatings: 5:30-5:45 pm and 8:15-8:30 pm, and there's only 12 seats at the sushi bar. There's also table seating but they weren't utilized. I was luckily enough to snag reservations for soft opening week. Now that word is getting out, Hinata seems to be fully booked until next year. \n\nO  M  A  K  A  S  E\n*Course #1 - Kanisu - Snow crab leg w/ cucumber & seaweed: http://bit.ly/2gsDnR7\n*Course #2 - Kusshi oyster, Soy braised tako, Suzuki: http://bit.ly/2gEureC \n*Course #3 - Chef's choice nigari: http://bit.ly/2gRGX8l\n--Kanpachi: Amberjack\n--Katsuo: Japanese bonito\n--Sawara: Spanish mackerel smoked w/ cherrywood\n--Muki hotate: Fresh scallop\n--Tsuri Aji: Horse mackerel\n--Zuke Chu Toro: Aged, marinated medium fat Bluefin tuna\n--Mozuku: Seaweed w/ sweet vinegar (pic not shown)\n--Hirame: Kombu cured flounder\n--Umi Masu: Ocean trout\n--Kamasu: Seared barracuda w/ sesame oil\n--Kasugodai: Baby red snapper cured w/ kaishiki wood paper\n--Shoyu Ikura: Housecured salmon roe w/ uni\n*Course #4 - Owan: Fish Broth Miso Soup w/ shaved black truffle: http://bit.ly/2gRIX0a\n*Course #5 - Dessert\n--Black Sesame Ice Cream: http://bit.ly/2gwPOAp\n--Matcha Panna Cotta: http://bit.ly/2gsTjmm\n\nSince the menu may change based on seasonality and what they receive from Tsukiji Market, I won't get into the nitty gritty. However, I can say that the ingredients were top-notch, meticulously handled and prepared, and almost everything was perfectly seasoned and garnished. Although, Hinata doesn't seem to be Japanese operated, the young, skilled sushi chefs captured the essence of true Japanese cuisine and sushi making. \n\nMy favorite course was the Nigiri course which showcased 12 beautiful nigiris. Each one had the perfect sized shari topped with a nicely cut neta that was adorned with various accoutrements like their housemade aged soy, crumbled cured egg yolk, yuzu or was aged, cured, smoked, or torched to bring a surprising and different taste and texture from course to course. One monumental flaw: the shari (sushi rice) was overcooked, mushy, and underseasoned. \n\nI've never had miso soup with shaved black truffle and it was the perfect warm, luxurious finisher.\n\nDefinitely add the $36 supplement: Kegani, Hokkaido Uni, and Wagyu A5. You save $7 compared to ordering it individually. I only ordered the A5 Wagyu w/ shaved black truffles ($17): http://bit.ly/2hlRqw8. It's totally worth the splurge since you get a thick cut of A5 compared to Akiko, KUSAKABE, j\u016b-ni, etc. It's lightly torched which melts all the delicious marbling creating a slab of lush beef butter in your mouth. \n\nChef David was kind enough to provide us with complimentary piece of Tamago: http://bit.ly/2gx8WxS which was fantastic. It was like a moist sponge cake with pops of saltiness from the blue shrimp.\n\nService was warm, polite, and attentive. Everything was well paced and expect to spend about 2 hours for the omakase. \n\nThe sushi bar seats were comfy but they need to add purse hooks. 90s throwback music was playing which had everyone at the sushi bar jamming to. \n\nOnce they work out their soft opening kinks (i.e. sushi rice), Hinata has potential to be a 5 star omakase place for the reasonable price point. \n\nSaturday night was fun times (once the sake started pouring) and we made friends with the Santa Con peeps at the sushi bar. One fellow drunkee suggested to Chef David that they add sake pairings to the omakase. \n\nMy eyes lit up. \n\nThis has bad idea written all over it. \n\nWho's down?!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

There were three chefs and though the restaurant has tables, only counter were seated when we were there. Chefs were friendly and the atmosphere relaxed. I was sad the omakase did not include any uni, but you can add that as extras, along with many other options, as add-ons at the end. The only weird bit was that we decided not to add any extra pieces, yet still had to wait for the rest of the other parties to finish their extras to be served the last course, the soup and dessert. \n\nGet yourself there before price increases, which I suspect it will.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

I've been hearing a lot of good and the reservation is a must for this place. I did try to call earlier on the same day after they open to make a last min reservation since it was a last min plan but unfortunately, they were fully booked. However, we still gave a shot to walk in and we were super lucky to be taken in as walk-in. Definitely no walk-in recommended, I was told by the sweetest manager [Cynthia] that the sushi chef boss gave her an eye signal to take these two ladies. We just happened to be that lucky. ^_^ Note: I didn't realize they only do two seating rounds, first is 6-6:30 and second is 8-8:30! We walked in at 7:30, really just that lucky and thankful for it!\n\nOk... onto the service!  Definitely props to the manager [Cynthia] I was super amazed. The Hinata team definitely got the littlest details down. \nFrom:\n- pushing chairs for you\n- pouring you wine \n- explaining courses \n- refolding your cloth before you come back to your seat from the restroom \n- changing a brand new whole cup of hot tea for you whenever it's halfway to empty\n- lots and lots of wine and sake tasting \n- kneeing down to your height of view when talking to you and not standing looking down to you\nNote: I'm not sure about the manager [Cynthia] working schedule but I would highly recommend you ask for her for those of you who are going to try this place!\n\nOmakase | Food | Supplement | A La Carte:\nOMG where else can you find omakase at $78 and with 18 courses ?! It's definitely an amazing deal! Typically nowadays, you can't walk out eating an omakase without $$$ starting 3 digit price! \nThe omakase was great, not to the point where I had to wow about yet the ikura did stand my friend and me out, super sweet taste! The fish broth was hot to the point that I really enjoyed especially after drinking wine and sake because there are places out there that has their broth to lukewarm where it really throws me off. We also ordered supplement at $36 with 5 items, another amazing deal! As long as some a la carte: engawa, bafun uni + cavier, satsuma wagyu! Everything definitely lived off to its price! \nNote: Supplement and A La Carte are only allowed after you're almost done with your omakase which is understandable!\n\nAll for two ladies was only 327 before tax and tips! ^o^ Highly recommended and will be back soon with my friend and self!", "author": "Joey L."}

The chefs are younger and friendly. No stern looks or instructions during the meal. The fish was absolutely fresh and simply prepared with a few ingredients (sauce, cold smoked, torched), as opposed to excess toppings (gold flakes or truffle) that spike up the prices but don't necessarily add to the original flavors of the fish. The value is also right as Hinata is one of the more affordable omakase menus on the market, even with 4-5 additional add-on's, while serving high-quality fish from the very same markets as the other restaurants. \n\nChef Gavin really served up a fantastic meal and made the experience very enjoyable.", "author": "K.

We were seated at a table instead of the bar, which I prefer for a more personal dinner with my SO, but I think we'll try to be seated at the bar next time for a more social experience!  \n\nPrice wise, it was 78 per person for appetizer, 12 nigiri pieces, soup, and dessert. Towards the end of the nigiri part of the omakase, they will offer a supplemental menu that costs 35 for 5 additional pieces or you can pick from the a la carte menu. My favorites were the scallop in the appetizer and seasonal cherry blossom trout. Also absolutely loved the matcha panna cotta! We chose to order one set of the supplemental menu and split it. From this, the kaisui uni was a definite stand out. Each course was well-paced- not rushed and did not take too long for the next to arrive which allowed for a relaxing, special dinner. \n\nIn addition to the absolutely divine food, they offer Japanese beer and a wide selection of sake.

The earliest I could get was for Christmas Day, and since we had no dinner plans...score! \n\nI was nervous the day of because I didn't realize there's not only bar seating, but tables as well and didn't want to be stuck at a table. Luckily, the two tops weren't utilized during our dinner, but I saw they were used at the second seating. So make sure to request sitting at the bar! As of now, there's 2 seatings (5:30-5:45 and 8:15-8:30). We got there around 5:25 and waited in the sitting area before being seated. \n\nOur Chef for the night was Gavin, who we recognized from our dinner at Ju-Ni so we were pleasantly surprised! He was talkative and kept the flow moving nicely. \n\nThere's a good selection of sakes. So with the help of both the chef and waitress, we decided on a nice dry one for the night. Loved it! \n\nAs for the food, delish!!! The first taste was the kanisu which got our palettes ready. \n\nLoved the sashimi course! The Tai was a decent size piece of fish topped with red miso. The soy sauce braised octopus was super tender. And I've never had seated ankimo before but it was so so good.  \n\nAs for the nigiris, I enjoyed them all! I thought the pieces were a good size (I couldn't help compare to ju-ni which had incredibly small shari). \n\nThere's an optional supplement at the end as well as a menu to choose from a la carte. The bf got o-toro and wagyu while I got the Santa Barbra uni with caviar. We both ordered tamago as well. Highly recommend all of these!! \n\nThe soup at the end was savory yet light. \n\nFor dessert, I chose the matcha panna cotta and bf got the yuzu sherbet. The panna cotta had a strong matcha taste which I LOVE but bf wasn't a fan. His sherbet was incredibly refreshing. Both were the perfect way to end the dinner! \n\nService was attentive and friendly. \n\nFor the price ($78) you really can't beat it, especially in SF where the norm for omakase is getting to be around $120+.

I stuck with the $78 Omakase and did not leave feeling full, but definitely satisfied. Our chef was great at explaining and describing each nigiri piece, really telling you what flavors you'll get out of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the snappers I had that night (total of 3 different ones). I believe they menu changes every day depending on what they get in from the market. \n\nAlso, there's NO soy sauce provided here because you don't need it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-26", "description": "Solid 4 Stars. It's not 5 Stars and don't be fooled by the other reviews claiming so because I think that's a bit of a reach for this restaurant.  It's definitely good quality sushi, not run of the mill neighborhood sushi that's for sure but it's not in the same league as some of the more acclaimed SF or NYC joints.  A few points worth mentioning. \n\n1) Don't be fooled by the $78 price tag comparison and all the raves on how affordable this is for omakase.  Needless to say you must compare apples to apples. For $78 there is no UNI, no mirugai, no fancy prepared ikura, no O-Toro, no freshly sharkskin-grated wasabi. You get quality staples like regular blue fin tuna, amberjack, mackerel etc albeit these varieties no doubt taste imported and the seaweed is first rate. The higher price points of other establishments are easily matched at Hinata when you add in the supplements which I feel most people will. So net net its only marginally less expensive, if not even-Steven, in my opinion.  \n\n2) There is a lot to be said about technique and execution when it comes to finer dining.  While the gents behind the counter are good fellas with a bright future, they haven't been around the block all that long and it becomes apparent rather quickly.  The O Toro was a bit \"fiber-y\", the uni was short on portion and presentation, the torch was a bit wayward in application and the Wagyu...not melt in your mouth as I was expecting...not sure what others were experiencing. Again, better than average but I guess I'm looking for a bit more than better than average....go ahead call me demanding.\n\n3) Service was good, attentive but not overly intrusive but could use some polish.  Needed to ask for ginger multiple times, serveware left in place before next course arrived. \n\nBottom line, Hinata serves good quality sushi. The $78 Omakase is a well priced menu and will satisfy those who are looking for quality fish at a reasonable price point.  For the more discriminate sushi diner, I would temper expectations. \n\nHinata is a solid choice and the chefs, hostesses and staff have a bright future as they gain more experience with their restaurant.", "author": "Rich I."}

But it's almost impossible because it's like a new one pops up every month (as if that's the only reason why it's impossible lulz $$$$)! I don't know how I stumbled upon Hinata, but when I heard it was a chef from Ju-Ni who opened it, I had to give it a try. Plus the $78 pp was also a huge draw (even though we went for the pricier option). \n\nThe decor at Hinata is very modern, sleek and welcoming. There's a small seating area, and then a few tables they actually use to serve people. The atmosphere was lively and warm since it's not buttoned-up like traditional omakase restaurants are. We had Chef David, who was so hilarious and entertaining! He was also very knowledgeable and happy to answer all of our questions. \n\nAnd now, on to the food! The bf and I were deciding between the Omakase ($78 pp) and the Grand Omakase ($108) and decided, YOLO and got the Grand. DEFINITELY worth it as it include a lot of the more interesting and/or expensive nigiri (the squid, ootoro, uni nigiri are some that aren't part of the regular menu). One of the couples next to us got the regular, and ordered many of the things they saw us eat a la carte at the end. For $108, it's definitely worth it. One of the downsides to Hinata was that their a la carte menu was...limited? They had the typical wagyu, uni, ootoro, and some of the nigiri already offered in the omakase. Perhaps the fish weren't in season *shrug*\n\nThe Grand Omakase ($108 pp) of the night:\n- Kumamoto oyster topped with toro and caviar, hirame with wasabi salt: \n- Hokkaido scallop cooked in miso, soy sauce-cured octopus, ankimo with 7 spice: \n- Kasugodai: The citrus was perfect with this! The fish was extremely soft, and the powdered egg yolk on top was interesting though I'm not sure it added anything distinguishable\n- Sakura salmon: The neta was marinated in dashi broth and oh so creamy\n- Toyama Bay Squid: Very crunch with a nice pop when you bit into it. I think this is what people mean when they say \"umami\" :P\n- Ayu\n- Belt fish\n- Umimasu: YUM! The lime zest on top was the perfect pairing\n- Kamasu: This was so interesting! The neta was salt-marinated and ther coated with sesame oil before the chef seared it. You could smell the smoky sesame, yum.\n- Cured seaweed with strawberries: Sour, but the sweetness of the strawberries cuts through it. Wasn't a huge fan of it, but it was interesting.\n- Hon maguro with roasted seaweed: I've never had nigiri handed to me wrapped in seaweed, but I'm not complaining! The roastedness was perfect with the light flavor of the tuna.\n- Chu Toro: The chef half-seared this and then put wasabi on top.\n- Ootoro: Super creamy!\n- Hokkaido uni: Also very creamy!\n- Wagyu with Santa Barbara uni on top: The bf had this because he doesn't like uni. The chef made this instead, to ease him into the uni :P\n- Uni, ikura and some type of special seaweed: Ikura was delicious, sweet and not too salty\n- Kohada (ordered this a la carte)\n- Wagyu (I think we ordered this a la carte too)\n- Tamago: Cooked for 2 hours, mixed in with shrimp!\n- Miso soup with baby mushrooms\n- Yuzu sherbert: So smooth and citrusy!\n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Hinata, it doesn't top Omakase or Ju-Ni because nothing really blew my mind. However, the prices are unbeatable and it's such a steal for omakase. At Omakase and Ju-Ni, the omakase menus START at $150ish!

We arrived for our 8:30PM seating at 8:20PM, and there were already a few other groups there. I wasn't sure how they arrange seating; it seemed to me that they seated people in the order they arrived, but they told us it was by reservation order. We were finally seated at our table at 9PM and I was starving after watching every other group get seated one by one. I was already pretty upset at this point because a) i'm freakin' hungry and b) we ended up getting a table seat (the last bar seats were taken up by the group right before us)\n\nThings that were good: Appetizers (3/4 were pretty good. The scallops that everyone talks about were worth the hype, crab + any type of citrus-acid is a good starter), Baby Red Snapper, Black Sesame Ice Cream (Interesting ice cream flavor. But I felt that it wasn't the best way to end the meal. Yuzu sorbet was good though.)\n\nThe reason I use the word 'comical' to describe my experience was due to a few things. For some reason, the tea they serve is boiling hot - so hot you can't touch the cup without burning yourself. Once the tea cooled down to the point where it was drinkable, they waiters came around and switched out the cup with another cup of boiling hot tea. This continued on for the entire night, even though on multiple occasions we said we would NOT like more tea (they didn't hear us or something?) It was so stupid I could only laugh.\n\nOn top of that, most of the fish was pretty average, and the rice was not cooked properly. It was slightly hard, as most other people have mentioned in their reviews. The wasabi that was used was also pretty strong, and I feel like that cut the flavor of the fish rather than enhance it.\n\nWhen the waiter came to serve each course, at certain times she forgot what fish she was serving, so she effectively read off the menu on the table. The small talk was awkward and unnatural. At one point she asked me in the middle of the meal if this was the best omakase I've ever had? uhhhhh... In general the service tried hard, but still fell short.\n\nIf you're expecting a great meal, I would hold off. This experience was not one I would have again.", "author": "Albert C."}

Most of the courses we had were followed by a verbal \"OMYGOD\" and wanting more. Should've gotten the upgraded Omakase for $108! Every flavor and dressing they put on each piece melded so well together, and you could really taste the flavors of each fish. They have fish from Japan, Korea, the east coast, etc., and they really care about the quality of what they're serving.\n\nThroughout the meal the servers kept giving us fresh hot tea, and checking on us to make sure we were getting everything we needed. We got the yuzu sherbet and matcha panna cotta for dessert, and they brought out a black sesame ice cream with a candle to sing happy birthday for my boyfriend. So sweet! All the desserts were amazing tasting, definitely flavors I have not tasted before.\n\nThis was my first omakase, but my boyfriend is an omakase veteran, and we both agreed this meal was one of the top meals we've ever had.

Service was excellent, all of the staff were very professional and polite.We had the omakase (90pp) and added on the supplement menu as well. All of the sashimi was extremely fresh and it was overall a very interactive experience with the sushi chefs. Definitely a bit on the pricier side but if you're okay with splurging a bit I'd highly recommend coming here!", "author": "Angela K."}

One of the better experience in the Bay Area.  \n\nBut the quality of sushi is really not up to par.\n\nFor the price-  Kusakabe and Wako are far superior.  \n\nAppetizer\nScallop-  quiet small in size, lacks flavor and sweetness.\nCrab with crab miso- very dry and burnt\nMonk fish liver-  steamed but lacks flavor-  needs to be marinated instead of just dip in sauce right before serving.\n\nGinger slices-  too sweet and lacks kick.\n\nNigiri\nBasic skills-\nRice is too sweet\nToo much pressure used to form nigiri shape\nQuality of fish is no where close to likes of Kusakabe and Wako (same price range), all of them lacks flavor and fat.  \nThe portion is quiet small\n\nKampanchi- the fish was served little too cold and lacks flavor.\nTuna- no flavor, just slightly better than frozen one.\nScallop- smaller than typical high end sushi place, even with addition of sea salt-  the scallop was flavorless and not sweet.\nBaby Redsnapper- edible. No flavor\nFirefly squid- edible. But the seaweed was soggy.\nSawara- overly smoked, the fish is extremely dry. A good sawara is very fatty and flavorful.  This one is just dry and smoke.\nJapanese Barracuda- same issue as above.  Overly smoked, slightly burnt, and just dry.  Really deserve a 0.\nHirame- edible, no flavor\nOcean trout- edible, no flavor\nKinmendai- the fish quality is extremely low, lacks flavor and fat. Skin was seared but it was over done and the fish were cooked through.  Another 0 dish\nChu Toro- the marinade was good.  A dish that is finally acceptable.\n\n\nSupplement B-$32\nMafun uni-so so quality but too stingy on uni.  The ratio of uni to rice is off.\nDry Aged Toro- the Toro was good.  But the cutting was bad.  Did not cut in right direction hence the fat tendon made it hard to eat.\nIn shell uni-  this was a perfect dish and one that I would eat again.\n\nEgg finish-  texture was good but way too much shrimp flavor.\n\nOverall-  won't repeat.  Really not an up to par as compare to other high end sushi.  There are so many other choices that is truly authentic and higher quality place in SF.", "author": "Jerry W."}

We had Gavin as our chef and he was fun to talk to and very knowledgeable about each fish and drinks. A majority of the fish they serve is from Japan, which is a huge plus! Each piece was delicately and precisely served which was fun to watch. You can tell that all the sushi chefs genuinely cared about their work of art. \n\nAs for the taste, all the ingredients were very tasty and fresh! The presentation was on point -- Gavin made sure each ingredient was where it was suppose to be and placed it on the wooden plate with care. \n\nAfter the omakase, we were able to order from the a la carte menu. We ordered the wagyu and it was the best way to end the sushi experience! It melted in our mouths and we were tempted to order more.. but we stopped ourselves in order to save room for their dessert. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the black sesame ice cream and I ordered the matcha panna cotta. The sweetness of the panna cotta was perfect, and my boyfriend is a huge fan of black sesame and loved his ice cream. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience and will be coming back soon!

Chef Master (Kevin) mainly served us, and he squeezed in a few table orders in between us enjoying our delicious items.  It was a full house; so, definitely make reservation!  The timing between items were perfectly spaced out, and we didn't feel rushed at all.  Chef Master was funny and carried a great conversation.  Usually my wife likes to eat in peace, but she enjoyed chatting with Chef Master; unless, it was the sake!  Some items were our first attempts, and Chef Master was eager to explain to us what they were and how they were made.  We learned the difference between Hokkaido and Santa Barbara uni : p \n\nFirst Chef Master prepared our appetizers: hotate (scallop), Tako (octopus), ankimo (monk fish liver), and mozuku (seaweed).  The scallop was the best; especially, we watched Chef Master torched them right in front of us! \n\nThen Chef Master moved on to fish: kanpachi (amber jack), hon maguro (blue fin tuna), kasugodai (red snapper), Sakura masu (cherry salmon), hotaru Ika (firefly squid), sawara (mackerel), kaki (oyster), Umi masu (trout), bincho (albacore tuna), kamasu (barracuda), kinmedai (golden snapper), toro (fatty tuna), ikura (roe w uni), and tamago (omelette).  Most of these were really good!!!  Our top 3 were ikura, hotaru Ika, and toro ; p My wife didn't like the tamago, cuz it tasted like sponge cake.  Perhaps the restaurant should consider replacing this item. \n\nHeads up... When you have about 2 items left, the waitress will present you a second menu with additional items you can order.  This is the dangerous part!!!  Most items on the second menu sound so yummy, and my wife wanted to order more food even tho she was already 9/10 full.  By this time, my wife finished her second 8oz bottle of sake.  You have to be discipline here and not over eat, cuz that might ruin your overall experience.  Good thing she listened and not order more. \n\nThen it was dessert time.  I got the black sesame ice cream, and it was so flavorful!  My wife got the matcha panna cotta w syrup, and she loved hers.  We traded, but preferred our dessert.  \n\nWe loved the experience so much that we've made our next reservation directly with Chef Master!!! : ). We've been to some omakase, and our favorite before Hinata was Morimoto in Napa.  After this meal with Hinata, it's a toss up.  Once we factored in the price for food and drink, we have to say Hinata ($240) might be our new favorite over Morimoto ($475).\n\nI normally don't Yelp review, but this was definitely worth my time ; p", "author": "Steven S."}

There were 3 chefs behind the bar and I had the pleasure of getting paired with David. He's the man!\n\nI chose the $78 omakase and was surprised at the price point for the amount of pieces of sushi that came with it (13 + appetizer + soup + dessert). Everything that David served was amazing. See below for a recap:\n\nAppetizer\nHotate seared Hokkaido scallop with miso aioli\nTako shoyu braised octopus\nAnkimo shiro shoyu braised monkfish liver\n\nSushi\nKanpachi - amberjack\nHon Maguro - blue fin tuna\n*Kasugodai - baby red snapper\n*Sakura Masu - cherry salmon\n*Hotaru Ika - firefly squid\n*Sawara - spanish mackerel\nMozuku - okinawa seaweed / sweet vinegar\nHirame - flounder\n*Umi Masu - ocean trout\n*Kinmedai - golden eye snapper\nKamasu- japanese barracuda\n*Chu Toro - medium fatty tuna (soy marinated)\nShoyu Ikura - cured salmon roe with uni (from maine)\n\nThe asterisk marks my favorite pieces is sushi. Again, every single thing I had was really delicious, but the kasugodai (baby red snapper), sakura masu (cherry salmon), sawara (spanish mackerel), umi  masu (ocean trout), and soy marinated chu toro were amazing. I've never had cherry salmon and apparently it's only available for a limited of time during the year. The firefly squid was another new one for me. The flavor was subtle and had an amazing texture. The ocean trout was salty and delicious. It might have been my favorite piece of the night! Last but not least, the chu toro was really good. I've had chu toro before, but never have I had it marinated in soy sauce. It took on a completely different flavor and I honestly loved it more than the otoro that I had later that night.\n\nAfter the sushi course there is a supplemental menu that is available. Honestly, I was pretty full at this point, but I wanted to try more since everything up to this point was so good!\n\nA la carte\nKohada - gizzard shad\nUni from Hokkaido\nOtoro - fatty tuna\n\nOwan\nFish broth with red miso, nameko mushroom\n\nDessert\n*Matcha panna cotta w/ Okinawa black sugar syrup\n\nThe experience here was phenomenal. David was a funny guy dishing out amazing food. The atmosphere was laid back and welcoming which is nice change from the often times quiet settings of other restaurants serving omakase courses in SF.\n\nAt $78, you cannot beat the amount food that you get at Hinata in addition to the quality of ingredients.\n\nI've found my new go-to spot when I'm craving sushi in SF (which is almost always)!", "author": "Kevin C."}

Most of the fish has origins at the famous Tsujiki fish market in Tokyo (which is kind of a big deal) and you can really taste the difference. The nigiri selection shows complex flavors in many beautiful whitefish, beyond just the typical tuna and salmon many people are used to. \n\nThe servers who took care of our drinks were sweet and attentive, and we never waited a minute for more champagne or Japanese craft beer.

However, after I tasted the miracle from Mr Master's hand, I will definitely come back for their sawara. I changed my mind for the mackerel cuz It tasted damn delicious! Mr Master told me they smoked with cherry wood and then salt cured to take down the moisture from the fish for two freaking hours! \n\nThe tamago is the best tamago that I have ever tried. It have strong blue shrimp favor and came back with little sweetened. \n\nMost of reviews recommend the supplement, so I tried, supplement A come with Bafun uni from Hokkaido, Otoro that aged for two weeks and A5 Wagyu, what a combination!

I want to start off by saying that every single thing we ate was delicious. All the fish tasted fresh and didn't have that fishyness to it. We tried some things that you can never find at your average sushi restaurant, like the sawara, a Spanish mackerel smoked in cherry wood. \n\nAs you get closer to finishing your omakase, they bring you the a la carte menu. We each got a supplement which came with five items as well as an order of the Satsuma A5 wagyu nigiri with truffle each. The wagyu was super tender. I would come and order just the wagyu if I could. \n\nThe service was exceptional. Our server explained every item that came out to us. She also noticed that I am left handed so she let the chef know to put the first item on my dominant side. Our server was very friendly and easy to talk to.

The wait between sets (usually 2 pieces of nigiri at a time) was way too long - sometimes we waited a solid 10 minutes. We were seated at a table and it was clear to see that the service at the bar was 10x better because the chefs were very engaging with their customers. I think that might have taken away from our experience from the table because those were the same chefs preparing our food. We also noticed the chefs and waitresses were having multiple drinks with the customers at the bar. \n\nOverall, I was disappointed by the price we had to pay for the low quality of food and the slow service.

Fun to watch, and great to chat with. \n\nThe meal started with the salads, moved onto the sashimi (hokkaido scallop, yes please!) and into the nigiris. \n\nThe meal at Hinata moves slowly - we realized we had been sitting there for 3 hours by the time dessert came around!! - but we enjoyed every second of it!

Omakase is such a good way to try out different types of fish and different ways of preparing it. My favorites are probably O-Toro (fatty tuna) and Albacore.\n\nThe atmosphere here is a lot different than I imagined. It's more of a upscale modern industrial look than the intimate vibe I was thinking of. My friends and I were seated at a table instead of the counter in front of the Chefs. So we weren't able to watch things being made or chat with the Chefs, which were a total disappointment :| But other than that, everything was great. The wait staffs here are super friendly, they even paid attention that one of my friends is left-handed and catered the intro of each wave to him as soon as they figured it out. The entire meal took about 3 hours. I was getting very tired at the end (we started at 8:30pm). I'm not sure if I have the patience to sit through something like this. Or maybe I just heed to start earlier next time.\n\nThe base price of Omakase here is $90.

It goes without saying that my bar is pretty high, but I can say without a doubt that this spot has what it takes to hold their own against the variety of omakase spots you could choose from in SF. \n\n*Ambience*\nThe decor inside Hinata is carefully laid out, but are still working on perfecting the ambience during the soft open. Chef Gavin mentioned that he really wants to focus on talking to his customers which I really appreciated, so many of the tables in the back may be removed. Overall I loved the decor, which carried a very modern yet traditional finish. It wasn't overwhelming and sterile feel that many restaurants have these days.\n\n*Personality*\nChef Gavin, David, and Master all carried charismatic personalities which really played to the 1x1 conversations that you would want to have during your omakase. I really enjoyed how genuine all of them were and out of all the chefs I've encountered, they were the most enjoyable to chat with. You can also tell that each and every one of them are passionate about their work, taking each piece that they delivered seriously. For us our chef was Chef Gavin and he is awesome! Attitude, personality, warmness, etc. you name it! He's got it all.\n\n*Menu and Taste*\nOne thing I loved about Hinata was that emphasis on diversity and nigiri. If you are a nigiri lover like me, you'll for sure dig this place. Each piece of nigiri was made to perfection and the set menu was phenomenal. I believe they had more pieces of fish than most places do and we ordered an additional 3 afterwards before we hit our miso soup and dessert. The menu changes quite often according to the chefs, so you never know what you are going to get. However I our menu came with 2 starters (one starter which had 3 different pieces), 13 pieces of nigiri, 1 bowl of miso soup, and a dessert which you can choose from a choice of 3 different kinds. I'm pretty picky with the taste of my nigiri ranging from rice, seasoning, texture, etc. but they definitely nailed it. I hope they keep up the quality throughout their launch. \n\nOverall this place was amazing and will definitely come back again.

IMO no other Japanese restaurant in SF has suppassed it yet, not even Hinata.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the decor of the restaurant is very nice. However, if you want personalized treatment, the best seats to get are at the sushi bar, where there are only 8 seats available in front and 4 on the side. \n\nMy GF made a point of getting us a seat in front of Gavin (one of the owners) who works at the station on the right side of the sushi bar. It is a very good location.\n\nWe each had the omakase and a couple of items off the supplemental menu.  There were 18 pieces of sushi in all.  Each was fresh and delicious but after awhile there was a certain sameness to them, such that I had difficulty remembering what I had eaten. \n\nWe also had a bottle of sake.

All she could say is that next time we would get better service (not sure how that helps). In a normal situation if I had made the reservation online or something that could cause confusion I would understand, however when I call in and specifically ask multiple times on the call to confirm that it would be at the sushi bar, that is not something that makes sense to me. It's a deceptive move that left us in an unfortunate position on what was supposed to be a special night. As our dinner was ending, we found out that a couple of friends of the staff were given seats at the bar during our seating. Hopefully unrelated, but at this point it's hard to be sure.\n\nFood-wise, the sushi was only alright. I have definitely had better (especially for the price). The descriptions of the items were very short and rushed as well.\n\nI waited a while to post this because I wanted to process the experience and make sure it was not just frustration from a ruined evening. After a couple of months, I realize that I will always remember this terrible experience and definitely discourage anyone from visiting, especially for a special occassion. There are plenty of other great sushi restaurants in the city and Bay Area as a whole.", "author": "Daryl L."}

Taking into consideration the price point, ease of making a reservation, and quality of food, Hinata is pretty nice. I would classify it as a medium-end omakase restaurant. It's fun and laid back with easy going chefs but with the pampered service of high-end joint. I say laid back sushi chef because I overheard the table beside us throw down a list of stuff he didn't like to eat and was accommodated. I think in most other high-end sushi joints they'll just tell you to deal with it LOL. As for pricing, the standard menu ($80) gets you an appetizer plate, a decent range of sushi, AND dessert. Then before they bring you your finishing soup, you have the option to add $35 for supplemental omakase or order bits and pieces from the a la carte menu. You can end the night happy and satisfied for $200 or belly up and tipsy for less than $300. (This is a great deal considering high-end omakase usually starts at $120 per person.)\n \nThere were some things that could have been executed better like the snotty seaweed shot or overly peppered Wagyu, but these are to be expected due to caliber of chefs. But that doesn't mean its not good, just not perfect. Over all the experience was great, the service was great, and the food was above average. Happy bellies and only $300 poorer.\n\nTL;DR: Recommended for the sushi-snob on a budget. Not really recommended if you are sushi connoisseur with a very high expectation.

From the moment I entered the restaurant, I was greeted by the waiter. She was extremely attentive and made sure I was taken good care of. My reservation was 5:30pm and the dinner started promptly at 5:45pm. The bar seating sat 12 people. Three sushi chefs and I was lucky enough to be served by Chef Gavin who used to be a chef at Ju-ni. Chef Gavin is now one of the two owners of Hinata. \n\nChef Gavin provided an excellent service. The way he handles each dish was with extreme care and precision. He was great at explaining each fish and the details of their taste and texture. The whole omakase took almost 3 hours which was pretty long for an Omakase, but we ended up ordering the supplements which took up some time. \n\nIt's amazing how young each chef was. I can't wait to see their growth and watch Hinata grow as the next best Omakase. We spent three bills, but it included a poop load of drinks and supplements. However, without it, $78 pp is a great deal! \n\nHinata is probably my third favorite Omakase. The fish is really fresh and I love the presentation. The different selection of fish was intriguing as I've never tried some of them before (Barracuda). However, the majority of the fish were very salty and strong in flavor. I would have loved if some didn't have too much extra toppings on top of them. I wasn't a fan of the smoked and marinated fish, but I appreciate their effort and style. Nevertheless, I loved them all. Hands down my favorite was the baby salt water eel and ocean trout. They change their menu on a daily basis, so keep a lookout.\n\nBecause the restaurant only seats a limited number of people, the service is on point. Napkins were always folded and drinks were never empty. As a wonderful gesture, they gave my boyfriend and I complimentary champagne to celebrate our anniversary! \n\nFifi had a wonderful and fun time. Hinata is still relatively new so reservations aren't filling up yet, but once word of mouth comes out, it's gonna get packed.", "author": "Fiona L."}

Don't get me wrong, the fish is good, but if you've had enough omakase you'll realize this is a mediocre version at best.\n\n The fish to rice ratio of the nigiri is too high and not balanced. It made me feel like they we're baiting me into buying the supplement at the end, but even then I don't think I'd want more of the same. I complement them on experimenting with adding different zests (lime, lemon) to the sushi, but I couldn't help but notice the delicious fish underneath wanting to come through.\n\nThe atmosphere is more fun and laid back for sure, as the chefs were conversing and taking shots of sake with the customers, but don't market yourself as \"authentic omakase\" if this is what you deliver.", "author": "Nick M."}

There were several tables and many of them looked like it was for parties of two. Definitely an emphasis on a one on one experience here. The decorating is sparse but I think it really adjusts the focus onto the food. We spent less time staring at the decorations and more time really interacting with each other and talking about what we were eating. \n18 courses is a lot, especially for less than $100 before tax and tip. \nThe appetizers included tofu and small samples of fish. The tako (octopus) was the least liked but that didn't throw off our meal in any way. Each of the fish came in groups of two, stationed beautifully on dark wood plates with the words Hinata inscribed on the bottom left hand corner. R felt that the two pieces basically goes less fatty and then fatty. Our waitress provided a good amount of detail about each piece, a few sentences more than what was written on the menu. They weren't pushy and didn't pick up the dishes before we finished eating, which was good. It was a very well paced dinner. \nAbout a few courses before the end, basically the second to the last pairing of fish, the hostess will bring a supplementary menu. For $32, there's about 4 more pieces of fish, I believe. We were decently full so we opted to skip it. Maybe next time, we'll get the supplementary. \nOverall, we had a good time, especially since it was R's first omakase! The hostess was super nice and helped us take a photo. I definitely recommend this for a first omakase experience because it's very evenly paced and comfortable. Remember to reserve beforehand!", "author": "Michelle R."}

In fact, it's one of the best dining experiences of my life. I enjoyed it so much I went back 3 weeks later! \n\nThey offer two seatings a night. The first used to be 5:30 but they moved it back to 6:00pm due to how much prep is required for their popular items outside their omakase line-up. So that means you'll have two opportunities each night (6pm and 8:30pm) to witness and sit through a terrific dining experience. \n\nOMAKASE:\nSeasonal, so it'll change. Even between my two visits, three weeks apart, the menu changed a bit. However, the food was just as good. I wasn't disappointed with any of the 26 items I had during my last visit (22 the first time). They make a strong effort to ensure each item will compliment the next one. It's not up and down like other omakase experiences. It's a journey, and a damn good one. Fresh ingredients. Elegant execution. Top-notch flavor. \n\nSERVICE:\nI sat on the left side of the bar both times, right in front of Chef Master and Chef Gavin. They're both awesome and add a fun element to the whole experience. I fed them sake all night and we talked about everything from food to music to movies to where we're from to, to, to anything you can think of. The rest of the staff is very attentive and accommodating. It's obvious they put a lot of care into taking care of their customers - it was on full display all night. \n\nI've highly recommended Hinata to multiple friends and family.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-10", "description": "I've had the chance to dine with chef David Chen previously when he was at Sushi Ran. I think his skills and techniques have definitely elevated since then (a few years back). Like other reviewers are saying, since they are still \"soft opening\", prices are a bargain at $78. \n\nFood is excellent at that price point. I think if they go up to $100-120 that would still be acceptable and competitive against other omakase in the city (honestly, I probably wouldn't come back if it was over $100). \n\nI really liked the first course with cucumber seaweed salad. The dressing was nice and refreshing, similar to what chef Chen served us at Sushi Ran years ago. In the sashimi course, the mustard addition to the tako was a nice touch, although I would like to see it braised a little longer. \n\nSushi course was great. There was a lot of creativity that I have not seen elsewhere (strawberry in the seaweed shot and egg yolk on the striped bass). Every piece was prepared nicely, with the exception of the hotate being a little bit over salted and the kinmedai too lemon-y. Maybe that's just my taste. Overall, I expect that everything will continue to get better. Also, the seaweed at the end used for my uni was stored in a ziplock, instead of the traditional tin container :( Would also love to see the seaweed get toasted beforehand to add the extra crunch. I have to say, the toro and daikon handroll was exceptional, though. Good call on the pickled daikon vs. scallion!\n\nOne thing I do have to say is currently they only have 3 chefs at the counter, servicing approx 6 people per chef. I guess this causes dinner to be slightly longer than usual, which is fine unless you have somewhere to be. After reading some other reviews, it seems that the 2nd seating of the night can get screwed if timing is off and if lots of customers order supplements or gasp-different supplements, causing dinner to go way over time. I hope they figure this out soon, but regardless it was a great experience and very cool to see chefs break out and make something on their own. \n\nChef walked us to the door when we left which was very nice.

Best to go during the first/earlier seating at 530pm, otherwise you may have wait a little bit for patrons to finish if you choose the later seating (830pm-ish). \n\nReserve online. Add a note in the comments that you'd like to sit at the sushi bar. It's the best way to experience the food. The owners/chefs are quite chatty and provide extra commentary on each course. I love hearing about how and why he prepares each piece so that it enhances the flavor and texture. So much attention is paid to the details for each course. Each garnish or granule of rock salt is precisely placed. The temperature of the fish and rice is just right. And knife skills on point. \n\nThere is an option to eat nigiri with your hands; wet nap is available if you choose to do so. Only ginger is provided. No soy sauce, no wasabi. This is omakase, after all. \n\nOnce you finish the nigiri portion of the menu, there is also an option to order more off of the supplemental and a la carte menu. \n\nNot once was I disappointed nor underwhelmed. \n\nDesserts were the perfect ending. Black sesame ice cream had just the right texture with strong black sesame flavor.  Perhaps the best I ever had.

You usually get paired up with other parties, so depending on what they order, your order timeline changes. We were paired up with a party that ordered the Grand Omakase. At certain points, it felt like Gavin was more attentive to the other party (maybe it's because they're paying more lol) while he was lethargic in giving us our course.

Our first visit was during their soft opening and the second was yesterday, 10 months later. \n\nOn one hand, Hinata is one of the few omakase restaurants in SF that has an under $100 price tag. The food is beautiful and delicious, and the chefs are friendly. However, a few of things stood out to me that probably won't make me go again.\n\n- The first time, we were seated next to a group of three - two women who were taking photos of the food, and one man who would scarf the pieces down right away. I noticed that our sushi chef would always evaluate the pieces of sushi and give the man the worst cut or the worst looking piece. I understand that this was to make sure whatever gets posted online looks good, but is it not better practice to make sure every piece you're making comes out looking amazing? It didn't feel like the chef was taking pride in his work.\n- Yesterday, we, and everyone else who booked the 8:30PM slot, ended up waiting 30 mins to be seated, and we started eating slightly after 9PM. The excuse was that people from the previous seating had issues with traffic. And because the chefs serve all their guests at the same time, the entire 6PM block started and ended late. Other than a couple of apologies, there were no other gestures to make up for it, like complimentary champagne. 30 minutes is a long time to wait idly around, and people looked pissed off. I think they should reconsider their late policy or try to hurry things along during the meal for the people who were late - why should everyone else have to put up with the consequences?\n- They ran out of Kasui Hakkaido uni yesterday. My boyfriend and I ended up having to share one spoonful of uni nigiri after ordering two a la cart. Again, this makes me think the restaurant has poor planning because this should NOT happen. Either the servers and chefs should communicate better so the servers know what the cutoff is before people do the damn ordering, or they should order enough ingredients for the night! They've been open for close to 11 months! It takes a lot of balls to just hope your patrons are okay with sharing one spoon. (Yes, I take my uni very seriously).\n- On top of that, they charged us for 2 of the uni nigiri so we had to send the check back.\n\nThe sushi chef serving the people next to us said pretty loudly that \"We don't want Michelin stars\". Well, you sure ain't getting one with this sorta service, buddy.", "author": "Katie M."}

It's a small place, so make reservations ahead of time if you want to sit at the sushi bar. They only take seatings at 6 pm and 8:30 pm. I made last minute, day-of-reservations and was able to grab a table and we had a fantastic meal. We missed out on the sushi bar experience but the service was great and the waitresses were super friendly.\n\nWe did the $78 omakase which includes an appetizer dish (3 small things), 12 pieces of nigiri, salmon roe with uni over rice, a fish broth with miso, and a dessert (you can pick between 3 options). \n\nAppetizer - You get a seared scallop, 2 small pieces of monkfish liver, and 2 small slices of octopus. The best was the seared scallop, the other 2 were okay.\n\nNigiri - The nigiri was fabulous and the fish selection rotates depending on what is fresh. This is what we had for our dinner - yellowtail, blue fin tuna, baby red snapper, cherry salmon, firefly squid, Spanish mackerel, flounder, ocean trout, albacore tuna, Japanese barracuda, golden eye snapper, medium fat blue fin tuna. They end with the cured salmon roe with uni over rice. All the pieces of fish were fresh, melted in my mouth, had just the right touch of wasabi (it sucks when there's so much wasabi that it ruins the taste of the fish and goes right up your nose). Some pieces were seared, some had a little bit of lime zest or a hint of yuzu, and it was just subtle enough that it enhanced the fish but didn't mask the flavor. Some of my favorites were the blue fin tuna, cherry salmon, and Japanese barracuda, but I loved all of them and was sad when there were no pieces of fish left to come.\n\nDessert - I don't normally care for desserts at Japanese restaurants but these were fabulous. I got the matcha green tea pannacotta and it was light, refreshing, and didn't have a cloying artificial taste of matcha. My fiance got the black sesame ice cream and this was actually my favorite. Lots of flavor, creamy, and different from what you can get elsewhere. They make their desserts in house! We wanted to lick the bowl of the ice cream when it was done, that's how much we loved it.\n\nWe already made reservations for a month from now when we are back in town to eat at the sushi bar. We love this place and it's our new favorite sushi place in the city! Totally worth the money spent.", "author": "Christina L."}

Smoked Spanish mackerel was interesting though the smoke almost overwhelmed it. snow crab wasn't one whole piece which as a downer. Maine uni lacks in sweetness and texture just one level down compared to sb uni.  I would put the Hokkaido uni on the same level as the sb uni.

The food is very comparable to other similar styled restaurants - with each dish/nigiri meticulously prepared, explained and presented. The fish is flown in, the desserts, garnishes and prep all done in-house. The menu is extremely well priced for the number of items on the tasting menu and the a la carte menu also provides several additional options outside of the omakase menu (3 different kinds of uni!). \n\nI've dined twice now within two weeks and liked the fact that even within that short time, the menu had changed slightly to offer what was fresh and in season. What stands out the most for me with Hinata versus the other omakase spots (and I've visited almost all of them) is that the chefs and waitstaff are extremely engaging and conversational. The environment overall is very lively and fun as compared to the quiet calm of the other comparable restaurants. The music is certainly bumpin here and if you're sitting at the bar, you will surely be having a fantastic time! The chefs have previously worked at many of the well known establishments and are very well versed in what they do.

Only thing that made me really mad that I almost lost my temper is the sushi chef is too \"cool\". Because the waitress says that we can tell the chef what we prefer, so we did tell him we like white fish more. Then he started to explain red fish is more expensive and people should know how to taste red fish. Ok, I understand, I'm just saying I PREFER. Then he started making some sushi, and I asked what that is. He said \" don't worry, it's not for you, you don't like red fish anyways.\" WTF? Is this some thing you should say to your customer? I might not be the expert on Omakase, but I thought the chef should give out things for customers to try and educate their customers as well. He's not even Japanese.

His skillful sushi making was intriguing to watch. The menu was generous with 18 courses for only $78 with a $36 supplemental for another 5 courses.  We didn't go for the supplemental but instead,  we add a few more pieces with choices that weren't available from the supplemental menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-02", "description": "So I have to preface this review by saying - I was really excited to try Hinata. I know the pedigree of the chefs there, and I am a big fan of Sushi Ran, Juni, Akiko's, etc. That being said, Hinata falls just short of what they're trying to accomplish. \n\nWe arrived at 5:25 for our 5:30 seating. Upon entering, there was no hostess to greet us. I understand that they just opened, but I assume that restaurants begin prepping far in advance of the first seating. \n\nThe decor was more \"wannabe trendy hotel lobby\" than the goal of sophisticated Japanese minimalism. I will say, I don't generally care about decor as long as it is in line with the price point. I regularly go to Geta sushi in Oakland - pretty much weekly - and they have zero decor. However, if you're trying to sell a premium experience, I expect all the details to be in place. There were exposed wires, the ceiling paint was uneven, everything just looked slightly off.\n\nUpon being seated, we ordered a bottle of sake. The waitress who delivered it was very nice, knowledgeable, and impeccably dressed. We started to feel a little relieved... Until someone from the kitchen came out and rolled out a doormat. OK... Again, these things should be in place prior to service.\n\nAfter we received our sake, we waited for an additional 20 minutes before we could flag down the other waitress for water. This waitress, unlike the prior, was wearing torn jeans, an informal shirt, and TOMS. Now I love me some distressed jeans, and I am literally living in my TOMS - but not at work! And not if I'm in the service industry. Strange and inconsistent...\n\nWe didn't receive our first course until 30 minutes after seating. At this point, I was really hungry, so I was just excited to eat! Casual Cathy (that's her name now) came to deliver our appetizers. As she was struggling to describe the dishes, we both realized that she was reading the menu on our table, and filling in the blanks with \"umms\", non-sensical rambling, and improper terminology. It's my understanding that the menu at Hinata doesn't change often, so I'm not sure why she didn't know the courses. \n\nNext came the nigiri. So, sushi rice is very important. In Japan, apprentices spend years learning how to perfect the rice. I know we're not in Japan, but I'm trying to emphasize how important the rice is. We took our first bite - kampachi. The fish was fine - not spectacular, but I love kampachi so I won't complain. The rice... I'm still confused as to how rice can simultaneously be sticky but also dry. Maybe it was day-old rice - it certainly seemed to be... \n\nThe rest of the meal was the same - the fish was fine (not spectacular) but the rice was odd. Casual Cathy continued to struggle with identifying the courses. Actually, at one point, the menu was not visible and it was the most awkward description ever - complete with several \"umms\", a story about firefly squid that glow green and blue, and nervous rambling. The disparity between she and the other waitress was extremely apparent. \n\nWe ordered the uni supplement - these were the highlight of our meal. It seemed that they had a fresh batch of rice prepared for the 8:30 service, because these pieces DID live up to expectation. \n\nOur last piece was tamago, which the chef presented personally. \n\nChef: \"Have you ever had tamago?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes.\"\n\nChef: \"Where?\"\n\nMe: \"... Japan\"\n\nChef: \"Oh, well this isn't like traditional tamago - because that's really hard to make. This is different.\"\n\nMe: \"... Yeah, this looks like Japanese cheesecake.\"\n\nThat exchange is pretty much a summation of the Hinata experience. If it's difficult to do correctly, they just create their own version. I have absolutely no problem with a departure from tradition. I just think that a restaurant that's presenting itself as a premium omakase experience should be more refined. I know that they're still in the early stages, so perhaps these are growing pains. I will say - the rice MUST be fixed if they ever want to elevate beyond \"beginner sushi\".", "author": "Joanne T."}

Like, really young.  Like, can they be masters of sushi if they look younger than myself?\n\nMy skepticism was quickly put to ease when the food started coming in.  Ingredients were fresh, some interesting, some I have never had before.  the treatment were amazing.  some had a light citrus-y yuzu hint, while others retained its natural buttery flavors.   Some of our favorite include red snapper and sakura salmon.\n\nunfortunately, the service was not as professional as I'd expect from a restaurant with this caliber.  The dishes came slow, which was okay, but the waitresses must have felt compelled to come to fill in the breaks with uncomfortable small talks.  \n\nBoth came to ask us which sushi restaurants in SF we liked.  When we were like \"um, we like a lot of them; we are always trying new restaurants,\" we were hoping to end that topic and not be pressed with \"okay, but like, which one do you like?\"  I get your Ira Glass-esque enthusiasm to get to the bottom of a story, but you are totally missing the his finesses, and perhaps hanging onto a story not worth following. \n\nThen more awkward moments followed.  \n\nAs I returned from the bathroom, our waitress asked me if I lived in the same neighborhood as my dining companion.  I was so startled I blurted out \"we have kids together!\"  as if there was a law that says if you have kids together, you must at least live in the same neighborhood.  I happen to eat with my husband that night, but the probing--- I mean, you don't know if your clients are conducting their clandestine meetings while their spouses are away.  Just don't go there!\n\nThen pause. \n\nThen she asked what color my husband's eyes are.  I don't know how that relates to sushi, but he answered honestly that they were blue. \n\n\"they are beautiful!\"  she remarks. Then proceed to presume that I'd feel left out of this strange string of praises, she tells me I am pretty too.  \n\nAt this point, we resigned to hoping that they'd return less frequently and not pick up on any other new topics to chit chat about. Or ask us \"at this point, what has been your favorite fish?\"  Maybe even, a little bit of \"okay, let's just wrap up the dinner and relish the thoughts of the good food we just had in the privacy of our home.\"\n\nThen we got the dessert.  I should say, I got THE dessert.  My husband just got an ice cream.  I got the awesome panna cotta with Okinawa syrup.  Holy donut!  That Okinawa black sugar is no joke.  It's sweet. but it's more than just sweet.  It is a special kind of sweet.  Rarely am I able to say that the dessert was not a low note in an Omakase meal.  \n\nAll in all, it's worth returning for the food.  Next time, I will just have to be prepared to come armed with an alter ego and a list of answers ready to be fired off.", "author": "Candice B."}

After seeing Hinata on almost every social media account, my boyfriend decided we had to go. We made reservations online for the first seating at 6pm on my birthday. Our friend advised us to request for bar seating as he said it was an experience. I called a week before our reservation and the hostess advised me there was only 1 seat left at the bar and since there were 2 of us, we would need a pull-up chair. She said the chair wasn't as comfortable as the regular ones but also that no one has complained about it either. I told her it was fine. However, when we arrived we were seated right in the middle of the sushi bar and we both had regular comfortable chairs. I guess we were lucky! Every piece of nigiri melted in our mouths. For $78 a person and 18 items, it is definitely worth it. After the 18 items, they bring you a menu that offers a $32 add-on supplement where you can have 5 more pieces of nigiri as well as single orders of other nigiri. Our chef, Kevin was super friendly. He explained what everything was every time he placed an item in front of us and even made a couple of jokes. The sushi bar is hands-down the best experience. If you go to Hinata, do not sit at the regular table. Trust me. It's a huge difference. At the end of our meal, they brought out 3 desserts for us to share with a small \"Happy Birthday\" note and a candle. This was a really nice touch! I would love to come back.", "author": "Laura T."}

Attention to deal from the chef was very apparent and appreciated. While the price point is still affordable for a nice omakase, nothing blew my mind. I was disappointed in the add ons because I didn't think it was good value. \n\nAt $12 each for a tiny dime sized Hokkaido un\u00ed that was barely a bite and $12 for one piece of toro, it was good but not worth the price and you can get the same quality elsewhere at a better price. \n\nI didn't like the taste of tamago at $5 for a small block. \n\nService was attentive and satisfactory. Nice atmosphere and ambience.", "author": "Emily L."}

We ended up waiting almost an hour past our reservation time by the food started, but the experience with him was better than the week prior.  Because of the wait, he also gave us some special pieces at the end. \n\nWe tried two 3 oz pours of different sakes, but I ended up going with the same bottle I had the week prior. \n\nSALAD:\nSame snow crab salad with seaweed and cucumber, but the crab seemed sweeter this week \n\nSASHIMI: \n1.

I had the opportunity to be served by Chef Master twice. The food on both occasions were amazing. The only complaint I have was the first seating was a bit slow. Chef Master was serving 4 people at the sushi bar and a large table behind us. You can tell they were still working out the kinks and staffing for a new restaurant but the taste WAS NOT jeopardized at all. When I got home I immediately booked another reservation. :)\n\nMy 2nd experience was even better. The menu changed which I liked. I love trying new dishes and they kept my favorites which was awesome. My friend (who can be a critic) really enjoyed the food and Chef Master as well.

When making a reservation, make sure you mention bar seating so you could get the full experience. The first time I went we got seated at the bar and had a really good conversation with Chef David the entire time. He was friendly and full of information about everything I asked. Our omakase that night was $90 for 20 pieces and added the supplement A for another $32. Our supplement came with Uni, Wagyu with truffle slices and Otoro! The extra $5 for the truffle is well worth it, especially when feeding your eyes ;) As a person that's not usually a fan of uni, I really liked the uni here - sweet and creamy and not as fishy as it would taste at regular restaurants. I love the red snapper in the omakase, especially with the bits of lemon on top. It was my boyfriend's birthday & our anniversary that week so we got a nice plate with both our desserts on it for him to blow his candle. I am a lover of matcha, but the sesame ice cream has got to be my favorite dessert here. The sesame ice cream is so rich in the flavor of real sesame that it makes me crave for more! The second time around I went with my sister and mother, but didn't get seated at the bar - bummer! However, we still had exceptional service, the servers knew their stuff and the chef stopped by to introduce himself near the end of the meal. This time our dinner was cut down to $78 for 18 pieces with a supplement that had 2 items for $20. My sister and I didn't want the supplement choices so we opted for the Wagyu & Bafun Uni to wrap up our omakase. My mother had the horsehair butter crab and wagyu a5 10. My mother loved her buttery crab, which when I went with my boyfriend it was part of our appetizer. The way the tako (octopus) was cooked in the appetizer the second time I came, it was delicious with perfect texture. The meal with my family was a lot cheaper than when I had dinner with my boyfriend. Depending on the night, they have a different menu - I personally would love to return with the more expensive menu because of more nigiri pieces and a better supplement menu. My top favorite pieces in order of favorite would be the wagyu, otoro, chu toro, uni, red snapper, seared scallops (in appetizer), baby firefly squid (hotaru ika, which is seasonal) and sakura (cherry trout). Would definitely return, but onto the next omakase to try in the city before I determine my favorite one :) Parking isn't too hard if you are eating at the 6pm seating. I spent $427 (including tips & tax) for 3 people and $355 (incuding tips & tax) for two people with the larger menu. Worth trying for sure :) They also always try to better their restaurant which is awesome because I already see the decor difference from the first time I came :)", "author": "Amanda C."}

We came early to our reservation but were seated 10 minutes after our time. Typically, I wouldn't care too much but it was 8:30PM (and ya girl was hungry).\n\nThe omakase was delicious - the fish was fresh and each nigiri tasted unique. Our chef was Gavin was quite enthusiastic and skilled at his craft. \n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is the service was a bit awkward and lengthy. I definitely wouldn't come here with a big appetite -- the food isn't too filling especially as the service is spread out for almost an hour and a half. My boyfriend and I got the \"omakase\" as opposed to the \"grand omakase\" which means that we get 5 less pieces of fish. Gavin was serving us and three other couples that got the \"grand omakase.\" Though the difference is only 5 pieces of fish, we had to wait a lot longer to get each piece. While I understand that omakase is about an experience of knowing where each fish comes from and so on, the lengthy explanations were a little tedious when it meant that our food was coming out later. Gavin was also working on food for other parties outside of the 4 couples seated in his section, which made the food take even longer. It may make more sense to seat \"omakase\" guests together and the \"grand omakase\" guests together so that no party is kept waiting! Oh, and definitely turn down the music so that we can hear the chef a bit better.\n\nOther than that, the food was delicious and the service amazing!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-12", "description": "I was told Hinata is only doing a \"soft opening\". Omakase style @ $80 per person is way too low. I was also informed the price will be adjusted in Feb. during the official opening. \n\nHinata is run by 3 young itamae who are all very enthusiastic about Japanese culinary culture. None of them are Japanese doesn't border me a one bit. I just want to be served authentic, and quality Japanese food as long as they are well trained, and have their hearts in the right place. In that regard, they did pretty well.\n\nThe best way I can describe Hinata, is that, eating at Hinata feels much less intimidating than most other high-end Japanese restaurants in SF. Usually that is due a super formal modern deco or the temperament /attitude of the itamae. (note: please read my other reviews). All three chefs are very personable. And I got the sense they are trying to demystify the Omakase experience -- while other Japanese itamae would probably not telling you a lot of their trade secret or how they were trained in the past. \n\nGavin is our itamae, and we ended up exchanging ideas on foodie places that we liked to eat, of course he asked us about other omakase places we've been to (and like) in SF. We were honest with him on the highs and lows of different places and at times he would / would not reply or just share a smile. We also discussed Kansai vs Kanto food culture of Japan. \n\nFood-wise, it lives up to Omakase standard. Very tasty, and very fresh. One criticism I had, is that, out of the 19 courses of the meal, not single one nigiri is a true stand out, or would get me to say, \"you gotta try that\". Instead, the overall total experience is very good. I am *not* saying the food is average though. \"Even\" is the best way I can describe the whole experience. \n\nAreas that can be worked on (are actually not food related): \n\n1). gotta fix the background music. Not only that's too loud. 90s' rock / pop from the likes of Green Day, Oasis, and Alanis Morissette are not going to cut it. Put on some classical music, or Jazz, or just new age ambient soundtrack would do wonders to the evironment. Leave the 90s' rock / pop to Taco joint or Sports Bar. \n\n2). While the waitress are super attentive and helpful they seems to be under dressed for a \"fancy restaurants\". I know it's a tricky: hostress / waitress IMHO should never over dress for the job but I also feel they need to put some thoughts around how they represent Hinata. (Note: maybe because this is due to \"soft-opening\"?)...\n\nHope these feedback they will find useful, and I look forward to return after their official opening.\n\nNote: Maybe Hinata is intended to be a \"casual Omakase\"? If that's the case, I will have to re-factor my criticisms... but overall, I feel there are a lot of area for them to be discipline but without being too stuffy. Right now, it feels just a little *too* loosey goosey. Lot of potential with this place though.", "author": "George C."}

I have tried a lot Japanese cuisines in different cities including Bay Area, Hawaii, also Tokyo Osaka. However, I have to say HINATA is the best Omakase sushi I experienced so far!  The Omakase menu come with 19 different courses for only $78 dollars. All of these dishes are incredible delicious!!! My wife and me are so surprised the fish they serve are  extremely fresh and high quality. The chef told us all fish are air delivered from Tsukuji Tokyo.  No wonder Those fish taste different than other Japanese restaurant. All customers admired the chefs for their skillful performance.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-02", "description": "Overall, hinata has excellent sushi with amazing service! I would highly highly recommend it. \n\nI've been to a few omakase places in the city for comparison. I've been to Wako, Kusakabe, and Omakase. In terms of quality of fish, I would say that wako was the best of the three and that Hinata is on a similar level. So the quality of fish is definitely there. My brother and I were at a table instead of the bar so I'm sure it would be even better! I won't comment on individual pieces since they'll likely change as seasons change, but I have to emphasize just how great everything tasted. There wasn't a single piece that I thought was mediocre or just ok. \n\nIt has less appetizers than at the other omakase places, but I'll be honest, I'm there for sushi so if the sushi is good and worth it, then that's all that matters to me. And their sushi was really really good. They have a regular omakase that was around $80 and a supplemental menu of additional interesting pieces for an additional $35. I would highly recommend getting at least the supplemental. So even with both the omakase and supplemental, it still comes at a much cheaper price than at other omakase style places. \n\nWe also got a couple a la carte pieces (basically whatever wasn't on the omakase or supplemental). One of which was an A5 wagyu piece that was absolutely amazing. And extremely well hyped by our waitress, Melanie!\n\nOn the topic of service, we were helped by Melanie and Cynthia, both of whom were amazingly friendly, fun and knowledgeable. They were always prompt and around to help with whatever we needed. At the end of the night, they came over to chat for a bit, as well. My brother and I were initially a little disappointed we couldn't get bar seating, but Melanie and Cynthia were absolutely amazing and treated us so well!\n\nThe only \"negative\" I can give it is that it is much more casual than other omakase places. I personally like that it's more casual, laid back and down to earth, but some people want the feeling of a super fancy decor and whatnot. \n\nAs I said earlier, Melanie and Cynthia were both willing to chat for a bit with every table essentially, which isn't very common and made the place seem much livelier and friendly. The decor is more casual as well. My brother and I walked in with t-shirts and jeans and didn't feel overly out of place or anything. It simply doesn't present itself as some overly serious high class place. It lets the fish speak for itself; and the fish does a damn good job of it. \n\n\nIn the end, I would absolutely come back next time I visit the bay area. I think that's a testament to how good it is since there's still so many other places I'd like to try when I visit. But even disregarding price, the fish quality was incredible and the service was impeccable. Factoring in the value of how much you get for how much cheaper it is, Hinata has become my favorite omakase spot in SF.", "author": "Randolf S."}

I made a 6pm reservation but was running half an hour late with all the city traffic. I called to notify them which they said wasn't a problem at all. This was my sisters first time having omakase. This place is reasonably priced for $78 for omakase in sf. The fish in my opinion was just alright. I guess since it's only $78 you get what you pay for. I've definitely had better elsewhere.. There was only one thing that made me say omg this is good which was the Japanese barracuda which melted in my mouth! I would've gave a 4 stars but I'm taking one whole star off because of their uni. We ordered uni from their supplement menu and it was such a disappointment! I love uni and I was expecting it to be soo good! But instead it tasted just like sea water.... It was so nasty that I had to eat multiple ginger slices to get the taste out my mouth! Overall this place is alright and this was a first and last time I'd be eat here.", "author": "Cat F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-01-16", "description": "I was really, really rooting for this place to be amazing and to become a potential semi-regular haunt, especially given the price point of their soft opening and convenient location - but sadly, they've missed the mark by a longshot (the preponderance of positive reviews is shocking to me - I encourage you to read Sam K's review from 12/08).  I don't really write reviews, but I hope the management of this place reads this and takes feedback to heart.  Our party of 4 dined here on Thursday 1/12.\n\nSERVICE (1 star):   \n- Their front of house is criminally understaffed with just 2 servers for the entire restaurant and only one of whom could speak to the menu.  This became less of an issue after the meal got underway, but it proved a complete disaster at 8:30pm when we were seated at our table. \n- From what we could tell, the 5:15/5:30p seating had run way over, so when we first entered the restaurant we stood around for several minutes until someone finally greeted us.  As soon as we sat down, the servers' attentions then became diverted to closing out the checks at the bar, turning the tables, and then seating the later seating bar customers (a good 20+ minutes after their reservation time).  No one brought us menus or took drink orders for over 15 minutes (only after several attempts at flagging), and even after that it took several minutes for the actual drinks to arrive.  Our first course didn't come out until probably 40 minutes after we'd sat down, and then only after we asked if they could start bringing our food.\n- Lastly, the servers just both seemed to lack experience - if you told me they're friends/relatives of the founders and this is their first time working in a restaurant, I wouldn't be surprised.  They dressed in what looked like street clothes (jeans, button up shirt) and had trouble articulating the differences between sakes in any meaningful way when my friend asked for a recommendation. \n\nAMBIANCE (2 stars): \n- Way too brightly-lit. As my friend remarked, between the lighting and decor this place looks like a god-damned furniture store.\n- Unironically playing a bad 90s top 40 playlist for the duration of our 2.5 meal.  Never in my adult life has the music of a restaurant been so out of place as to grab my attention mid-bite like some bad stench rising suddenly from the floor and then lingering in the air.  I didn't want to hear Duncan Shiek's \"Barely Breathing\" or all the Goo Goo Dolls hits when I was 13, I surely don't want to hear that hot musical garbage while dropping $100+ as a grown man at what's supposed to be a nice restaurant.\n\nFOOD (3 stars):\n- After visiting Tokyo last year and also dining at the sushi bar at Sushi Nakazawa in NYC, my eyes have been opened to what sushi could be.  I wasn't expecting Hinata to be the same caliber, surely, but maybe at least fall in the same zip code. \n- Cold rice. Most bites tasted under-seasoned / lacked complexity.  I think there were at least 1 or 2 duplicate preparations for certain pieces of fish (using the sear gun, for example).

The restaurant was nice and they took us in quickly because we had a reservation. The food was fresh and the waitresses were very attentive. However, I did not have a great experience because of the sushi chef. I ordered the omikase so I was seated at the sushi bar area where I could watch the chefs prepare the sushi. A group of 4 guys came in and ordered a lot of sake and kept giving it to the sushi chef who did not reject it. He soon became very drunk and loud. The chef next to him had to serve us sometimes because our chef wasn't very focused on what he was doing. It was difficult to have a conversation with my date because of how loud him and the other guys were being. I expected a lot more from an expensive restaurant like this. Obviously I can't control the situation with the boys next to us, but I think it was unprofessional for the chef to get drunk. After dinner we called UBER and the chef stumbled outside the restaurant to apologize that he was \"f'd up\". Very unprofessional. Overall, the food was good but it wasn't worth the annoying environment.", "author": "Erin M."}

Working out service kinks but otherwise, solid place. \n\nLong Review: Went soft opening weekend so they are still working out service kinks. Pacing of the meal was pretty off for high end omakase IMO, which from my experience is pretty evenly and quickly paced with no large gaps between courses. This was my biggest gripe of the evening, as at some points we just sat awkwardly for quite a bit of time. We were not seated for 30 min then meal took 2.5+ hours which is exceptional long for edomae omakase (I think? Don't take my word, but this is my 9th omakase meal). First three course appetizer sat out for a little too long before being served, for instance the oyster was pretty warm. Once the nigiri started coming out I was blown away by the quality of fish and cuts, they were phenomenal for the value ($78 per person without supplements). I wanted to order more la carte but was way too immensely full! Favorite course of the night was the ikura and uni. I regret not having the supplement and A5 Wagyu, it looked amazing. \n\nOne suggestion is that the quality of the fish and skill of the chef are of very high quality and I felt some nigiri were slightly over salted/too much zest that overpowered the true flavor of the fish. Chefs - let the fish and your skill shine! Also the rice was slightly overlooked and mushy, so this is an area of improvement that can really elevate the restaurant from others. \n\nIf Hinata can provide the exceptional service it aims for (such as Kusakabe, Wako, Ijji, Ju-Ni) it will be a real contender if it wants to make a name for itself and attract repeat customers in the increasingly crowded omakase field. But alas, I'm sure at some point the prices will rise as it's way too good of a deal at the moment. Hands down should at least get a Michelin Bib Gourmand nod next year. Get here fast before prices go up and you can't make a reservation!", "author": "Cathy B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-18", "description": "After a disappointing meal at Kinjo last Sunday, Hinata was a pleasant pick-me-up. \nI guess I came after their price increase; its now $90 instead of $78, but still a good deal. \n\nSitting at the bar, I was served by chef Sam, who answered any and all my questions and told me some interesting stuff about the sushi business. They use California rice with red vinegar, but I found that it doesn't have the same punch as Sasaki's. But! it was still good and their rice was that perfect al dente texture, clumped perfectly, and was at the appropriate temperature. \nTheir fish was very good; Sam was telling me how all/most sushi places share the same vendor so the fish quality uniform, but the preparation between places are what provides the difference.  Most of the dressings were pretty standard; soy sauce, lemon and sea salt, chive and shiso, but they did have very interesting whole wheat miso they use! Very unique and interesting flavor. Their cherry wood smoked Sawara and Kinmedai were also perfect; a thin penetrance of the smoke flavor that wasn't too overwhelming into the realms of a charcoal/burnt taste. The only piece that I wasn't particularly fond of was their zuke chu-toro that they seared! Totally overkill on a premium piece that should be enjoyed simply. They have a pretty premium ala carte menu which included 3 types of uni, o-toro, toro, and wagyu! One interesting selection is seared toro and uni which was a pretty good combination that both held their own flavor and didn't compete! The searing gave the uni a slightly nutty flavor as well. \n\nService was good! No complaints there, although it must be tough with only 2 servers managing the whole place. They also have a pretty good sake selection; a full page of Daiginjos, and some interesting Ginjos, and Namas. They also have 3oz pours, which makes it easy to sample more sake at an affordable ~$10 range. \n\nOverall, Hinata is great for the price. The only downsides are that the experience is slow as many mention; 2.5 hours, and the lack of hot dishes due to their lack of a kitchen. The flavor/garnishes also weren't too innovative, but they did capture fine simplicity. For $90 you get 20 courses; 12 of which were nigiri and this includes dessert. For $100 you only get 8 Nigiri at Wako/Kusakabe for their cheaper menu, so overall Hinata is great value for what it does. I'll probably be back after I finish trying some other places!", "author": "Chad S."}

This is not the best omakase I've had, but at $78, the quality and attentiveness is far better than anything else you can get for less than $100.\n\nI was impressed by the variety of fish and flavors. A majority of the nigiri had toppings, more than most places I've been to. While a few of the toppings interfered with the fish too much for my preference, they were never over the top. The chef presented some good examples of seared, smoked, or marinated fish without falling into the trap of relying too heavily on any one of these specific techniques, like some places do. I especially appreciated the lack of reliance on excessive wasabi, which even some very expensive places use too freely.\n\nBased solely on the dining, Hinata merits five stars, but the experience of entering and waiting was definitely suboptimal. This is also the main reason I'm writing the review. I want them to improve this so that everyone can agree that Hinata is great. \n\nWhen we came in, we stood directly next to the door and the reception podium for ten to fifteen minutes without so much as a greeting, much less anyone checking us in or directing us to wait somewhere. When that eventually happened, we were directed to some chairs to wait in. The process was very disappointing from the time we entered to the time we were seated at the bar, after which the service (from both the chef and the waitress) became attentive. There was a large party standing around a table and people from the first seating were still finishing up, so I understand that it was busy, but acknowledging the entrance of diners is a basic requirement of all restaurants, and one that is especially emphasized in Japanese dining culture. Similar issues have been noted by other reviewers, so it seems like a consistent problem that must be addressed.", "author": "Scott D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-04-01", "description": "TLDR: Sushi chefs got drunk with other customers. One of the chefs came to our table and apologized for that behavior. Yet again, he proceeded to take another shot after that. The place got obnoxiously loud to the point where we couldn't hear the server's voice when she was speaking into our ears. The customers were rowdy and the people working there further enabled them.\n\nFor my birthday, my girlfriend booked a reservation to Hinata for a special omakase dinner. Our foodie friend highly recommended this restaurant after dining at other San Francisco restaurants. We generally don't spend more than $25 per person on dinner, but based on recent events, my girlfriend called for a celebration.\n\nWhen we arrived, the host seated us at our table and a server immediately greeted us with the menu for the night. As each dish arrived, our server briefly explained what we were eating. We were extremely impressed by the service and the quality of the nigiri dishes, so much that we decided to order from the supplement menu. We had finished over half of the meal at that point.\n\nThat's when things went wrong.\n\nAt the bar a few feet over, small parties were getting a little too friendly with the sushi chefs. Funny enough, my girlfriend had mentioned earlier in the night that she would have liked to sit at the bar and watch the chefs make our food. However, we both agreed that a private table felt more intimate and appropriate to enjoy our full courses.\n\nAs we waited for the next courses of the dinner, the chefs began cheering toasts and taking shots with some of the patrons at the bar. Our server could barely explain our next nigiri dishes as it was inaudible. As the noise level increased, I asked our server if she could kindly ask the guests at the bar to decrease the volume. The noise was much more apparent as we were patiently waiting for the next courses. I also mentioned that it was unprofessional for the chefs to drink on the job and enable inconsiderate behavior from the loud guests. Smiling, she gave me her word that she would try to tone down the noise. A few minutes later, our host apologized for the volume and told us she had tried to calm them down but to no avail. We thought that was strange considering we saw her laughing and joking around with the guests at the bar. After, one of the sushi chefs apologized for the noise and the wait and offered to pay for a dish on the supplement menu.\n\nI usually don't mind noise as I, myself, can talk a little too loudly. However, I don't condone drinking on the job. I grew more annoyed as guests were yelling across the room to each other and the chefs to take their shots of liquor.\n\nWhen we were paying our check, one of the other sushi chefs approached us and apologized for the noise. We gave our appreciation for his apology but again, we voiced our concern over drinking on the job and causing this disruption. The chef, visibly intoxicated, assured us that the restaurant environment was never as loud as this, but tonight was different because every party was celebrating someone's birthday. When I pressed him if it was appropriate to drink with patrons, he said \"it depends.\" We proceeded to describe how the uncontrolled noise and unprofessionalism turned our great experience sour because we could barely hear ourselves but it didn't seem like he understood our perspective. At the price we were paying for our meals, we expected not only quality service and food but also overall experience. Because the volume was still not maintained, my girlfriend and I actually had to raise our voices to be heard as if the restaurant had suddenly turned into a nightclub. A little defeated, we told the chef that \"we hope future patrons don't have to deal with this noise and we hope that they learn for the future.\"\n\nA few minutes later, another sushi chef approached us and apologized for our complaint. Again, we found ourselves lecturing to another intoxicated chef, perhaps the owner, on professionalism and customer experience. He replied that it was a special occasion that returning customers dine for a birthday celebration, and they couldn't \"refuse drinks from guests.\"\n\nAll in all, the food was delicious (except towards the end when the drinking took effect), but I was so turned off by the volume and professionalism that I don't think I could recommend this to anyone I know. I'm sure some restaurants allow their chefs to drink on the job, but hopefully not when charging their guests $90+ per person for a unfavorable experience.", "author": "Himal S."}

[yes, from a new batch]. 3) the seasoning is way out of balance. when combined with your soy sauce & garnishes i could barely enjoy the fish. after asking for no more garnish & soy sauce, the rice seasoning on its own was still a tad too much. \n\nindividual items of note: 1) hon maguro - excellent. 2) uni w/ salmon roe - could barely taste the uni. uni/roe/rice ratio needs adjustment. 3) seaweed for the toro hand roll lacked crunch. almost too soggy to bite through. the toro was also practically liquid. they need to be mindful of over chopping and drawing out too much fat. 4) miso soup had good flavor, but(!) it was room temp.. which lead to no flavor being drawn out of the truffles.\n\nambience: 1) there's no other way to say it... it's too bright! if hinata is supposed to mean 'sunny place', why not let your food & flavors be the 'sun'. the 'staring into the sun' brightness of the lights gave me jr. high school cafeteria flashbacks. sushi bar stools are comfortable enough. 2) itamae's area was kept very clean.\n\ntiming & pace: it was borderline slow. i hope it does not become a problem once you open up the tables. \n\nprofessionalism: 1) had to ask for new tea cup every time i wanted more tea, because topping up my cold tea with hot tea does not help the tea. 2) the place is casual so un-uniformed foh staff is normal, but, all boh staff should be wearing a kitchen uniform of some sort. it's an unclean/unsanitary feeling watching someone restock flatware/stemware/etc. in street clothes, and also thinking 'they're washing my dishes?'\n\nall in all not a bad start. i hope my next visit shows improvement because i live less than 5 minutes away.", "author": "Sam K."}

He gave us information on what kind of fish he is serving. And the food is great! We'll definitely come back again for another Omakase Dining experience. Price is reasonable for the quality of food they serve.", "author": "Liezl C."}
