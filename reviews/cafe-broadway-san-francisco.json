The local merchant recommended this place and warned us of the wait. Yes, the place was packed on a Friday afternoon. Luckily, we scored the last table for two within 5 minutes upon arrival.\nAfter seated, we were asked about what tea we would like to have. Do note that hot tea is automatically charged (per person) whether you drink it or not.\nWe ordered five items from the menu; three savory and two desserts.\nThe pan fried lotus roots and pork was the star. It was tasty and the combination of the lotus root & the ground pork matched up so well. Enjoyed every bite of it. The dried scallops and egg white fried rice was OK. The dried scallops were chopped so fine that they were hardly seen or tasted. The steamed beef balls were good. Unfortunately, they might have forgotten this dish as we didn't get them until they served the sweet desserts.\nFor the desserts, we had the durian rice dumplings and the steamed black sesame balls. The durian rice dumplings actually came with real durian meat inside. Unfortunately, the gooey dumpling did not compliment the durian well. The steamed black sesame balls were good. They just came too early (way before our steamed beef balls showed up). \nOverall, it was OK. If we have to wait in line for this place though, we might choose another place.", "author": "Andrew L."}

While we were looking at the menu posted in the window, the owner stepped out and tried to get us to come in. I was reluctant because they didn't have my fave roast duck jook on the menu. He said they could do that for us, so we thought we'd give it a try.\n\nWe're glad we did. We ordered a bowl of plain jook and a small plate each of roast duck and BBQ pork. The jook was as good as that at old Hing Lung: a hint of salt, a few shreds of ginger, substantial and comforting. \n\nWe ordered sesame balls for dessert. Honestly, they were the best we'd ever eaten: crispy, generously filled, and not a bit greasy. The owner stopped by a couple times to check on us, and he seemed to like that we once lived in China and spoke some Chinese. We liked him and his food enough to take a pic with him.\n\nI'm so happy we gave this place a try; it'll be my go-to jook joint next time I'm in town.", "author": "Patti I."}

I did appreciate the staff for warning me the price difference instead of being surprised with the final bill. We opted to get one of our go-to dish (roast duck noodle soup) to taste if there's a difference. The noodles taste the same but the style of duck they offer is much different. Also, disappointingly, their well known fried donut sticks are far from their previous quality. One of the staff revealed they changed most of their kitchen staff to cater to their new dim sum style menu. We did try two of their dim sum dishes and to my surprise the quality is pretty good. \n\nWhat did get me with their new cost structure is that because I'm currently pregnant I've been avoiding caffeine. I asked for hot water in lieu of tea but I was charged the same $1.25 per person tea fee.

The ratio of meat & shrimp was 5:1 (as in after the fifth wonton I finally found a piece of shrimp)?!?!? Also, the portion is very big, as in TOO MUCH NOODLE and not enough soup.... very disappointed in this HK style cafe joint.\n\n-Chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle (1/5): Why is the Chinese donut so damn big and not crunchy whatsoever? It was not satisfying to eat at all, one piece and I was scared to have another. Chewing time was about 10-15 chews to break down the flour-filled donut... \n\n-HK style Milk Tea (5/5): I really enjoyed this, I thought it had a good balance between the condensed milk and the tea.

After we checked out the menu, we placed our orders when she returned.  As we waited for our food, we were never brought place settings or tea.  Had to flag her down and ask for it. \n\nOur food:\nBeef stew with daikon over rice lunch special. Beef stew had good flavor, but felt the portion of stew was on the small side.  The soup that came with the special was bland.\n\nWon ton noodles. One of my party wanted wide noodles but they were out, so both received the thin noodles.

There's a lot to like about Cafe Broadway if you play to its strengths. Otherwise, this may just be another Chinese restaurant in Chinatown.\n\nTheir porridge is pretty good here, it's like dense, filling, and there's a buttery-rich flavor about it- maybe they put animal fat in it, I don't know, I'm not an expert on making porridge. I think every table gets an order of Chinese donuts regardless of what you order. I could be wrong, but they bring it out well before the food. I usually order the porridge with intestines and organs and it's pretty good and reminds me of a nice home cooked meal.\n\nTheir beef brisket with wonton noodle soup is so filling. The flavor is very tame and safe, be prepared to put some kind of sauce or seasoning in it. The noodle texture was good, but the heartiness of the brisket is lacking. The wontons were fine, serviceable.\n\nWhat I would recommend against is ordering their lunch specials. $8 will get you Kung Pao Chicken (or an array of other generic dishes), a serving of rice, and some questionably murky soup that is served lukewarm.

However, the food did come quickly, which I was happy about.\n\n~ Food:\n\nWhere Cafe Broadway fell flat for me. I was really hoping for an awesome experience here given how busy this place was (it MUST be good, I thought).\n\nWhat we ordered....\n\n- Baked Portuguese Chicken w/ Rice: One of my favourite Hong Kong style dishes. They really skimped on the sauce so it was a really bland dish, but they then tried to make it up by putting a layer of baked cheese over everything. I kid you not, there was more of a cheese flavour than a rich sauce flavour.\n\n- Ho Fun: Again, one of my favourite dishes that ultimately fell flat. The ho fun has the same exact problem as the Portuguese chicken; there was very little flavour. Usually ho fun is supposed to be rich and packed full of flavour, but here I just got a light taste of sweet soy sauce.\n\n---\n\nTo be fair, everything was edible.

It was simply average. \n          \n       After being seated we were quick to notice that two plates were missing. We tried flagging down a waiter multiple times, but decided to get the plates are selves from a nearby table. We came during lunch hour and it wasn't very busy. However the waitress failed to fill our water cups. The servers were able to communicate with us in Chinese and English which is a plus.\n\nThe Atmosphere:\n\n      Cleaner than most restaurants in Chinatown.\n\n       This place is newly remodeled so the decor seems fairly new. The chairs were comfortable and the bathrooms were very clean. I really enjoyed the open kitchen where you saw the food being prepared. If you aren't paying attention this place could easily be missed. \n\nAll and All:\n\n       Unless you like salt and grease or just have a knack for Hong Kong style food, I don't recommend this place. If you wanted a clean bathroom to use just come here.\n\nWhy Three Stars?:\n\nAverage food, Average Service, Above Average cleanliness.\n\nI gave Cafe Broadway 3 stars mostly because of the cleanliness. In San Francisco's Chinatown where the places to get asian style food are endless. This place manages to keep a high standard of cleanliness. In and of itself that is worthy of 2 stars. As for the food it's not the worst or the best so 3 stars is average.", "author": "Camryn L."}

Luckily we got here fairly early, at least before the waiting area filled up completely (seating and standing room both). Service is of course pretty bad, but that's partly because of how full the place is--you have to flag down a person for everything. But the food is actually quite good, in my opinion better than the one next door. The Chinese fried donut is tasty and not too greasy when wrapped in the rice roll, while their house special rice rolls has flavorful duck and pork pieces inside. I also enjoyed the beef brisket wonton noodle, which was super filling but not too heavy. Hopefully they keep it up and improve their organization--food is on point already.", "author": "Tony D."}

She told me to pay for white rice if I wanted to. I explained to her it is not because the fried rice was not enough to eat, it is all sauce and paste, absolutely disgusting. Why would I pay over $13 for fried rice and then having to pay for a bowl of white rice to dilute their grossed out all sauce fried rice ??

It was alright. \n\nWe ordered two bowls of the same congee with an order of the two donuts, seafood thin rice noodles, and a smooth egg with beef flat rice noodles.

The brisket was undercooked, and most parts of it that included tendon was very hard and chewy.

I ordered the wonton noodle soup and the noodles were hard. It was DISGUSTING!!!! The drinks were EXPENSIVE!!! I ordered a iced lemon tea and I couldn't believe how small the portion was. It was the size of the teacup they gave us and it cost $3.75. Then when the bill came, I found out it was $4.05? WTF??? For that small portion!!!  I asked the waitresses and they each told me a different price for the drink. Eventually the manager showed up and told us it was including tax. What?? Seriously??? Then I looked at the end of the bill and they charged the rest of the tax for the food. Wow!!! If I would 've known the drink was that small and expensive, I wouldn't have ordered it. the only thing I liked about this place would be the interior design. That's probably it.\n\nTIP: They do NOT accept credit cards. CASH ONLY!!!\nDO NOT order the wonton noodle soup or any drinks. Not worth the price. Can get twice the portion at a local boba place", "author": "Natalie G."}

When we get into this restaurant, no one served you. You have to stand and stare at them. There are people fooling around, not doing anything. The really short hair guy took my order, saying i want to order black pepper chicken steak sizzling platter. He say \"no sizzling platter, oh, i can TRY to get you one.\"  My friend order Portuguese Style Baked Chicken Over rice. He say \"no baked\". FINE. We ordered both and chicken sizzling platter DIDN'T came with sizzling platter and portions are half. TASTE AWFUL! I HAVEN\"T TRY ANYTHING THAT TASTE LIKE SHIT. Worst customer service.\n\nThey also mess up the bill. wrong price and they try to steal your money by getting something you didn't order on the receipt. PLEASE LOOK AT THE RECEIPT BEFORE PAYING!!!!!!!!\n\n\nPerhaps I should wear my fancy shirts and pants or suits in this little cafe in CHINATOWN!!!!\n\n\nNO NEXT TIME. FUCK YOU ALL!!!", "author": "Sandra C."}

I emphasized I want \"Taiwanese\" milk tea for 3 times, but the waitress gave me a Thai milk tea instead. And the steak was really small, that steak was restructured beef. Moreover, the price of the steak was almost 14 bucks. The waitress was also trying to get higher price steak as well, glad I didn't do it. I got 17 bucks as total, this is a very disappointing restaurant. Highly \"not\" recommended!!!", "author": "Ho Jui C."}

The porridge came out very bland and watery. Very disappointing. They still serve You Tiao (fried breadstick) and Cow Tongue (Fried sweet donut) ($1.50 and $2.00 each!!!) The sweet donut was the only item that was consistent from the previous restaurant.\n\nFinal thoughts: Customer service was horrible. The servers absolutely do not cater to elderly people, or anyone for that matter. To put it simply, they are slow to take your order but fast to give you the check. We had 4 servers at each corner of our long  table, and each server was having a casual conversation while there were people waiting to be seated, have their orders taken, you get the idea. Word of advice, if you open a restaurant in chinatown, take care of the natives first, especially the elderly. Will not be back here again. I paid cash, not sure if they take card. Porridge was $6.95  a fried donut $2.00 so breakfast would be around $8.95 before tax. Will not be back for mediocre food, the service was the biggest turn off, the porridge was very bland and watery, and the portions for regular food (beef chow fun) looked like it had been eaten before they brought it out.", "author": "David W."}

In particular, I like their variety and prices on the lunch specials. I tried their tofu with fish rice plate for under $9. While it's obvious that it's just tilapia, the portion sizes are huge and filling. I also shared the Wonton noodles and their eggplant stir fried noodles, average but filling Chinese food in a clean setting.", "author": "Nancy Y."}

This is cafe in Chinatown with BBQ menu which mean most of the food already precooked. It took me more than an hour to get BBQ pork Lo Mein, which nothing on this dish has to be cooked. When I sat down already bad feeling when the waiter served the customer who came after me.  After almost 15 min I have to call her to get my order.  And overall it took 2 hrs from I sat down to getting my bill.  Nobody refill our tea.  They are not even full.  Avoid this place unless you have the whole day free. Service horrible, food just so so.  I can't believe this place getting 3 star. Maybe family and friends review :)", "author": "Gloria N."}

The chicken was fine but the beef was cold so we told the waitress. 10 mins later she came back with the exact same plate of beef that they fucking MICROWAVED. Like uhm excuse you?? I told you my food was cold and u couldn't even have the decency to just remake it but u microwaved it??? What kind of fucking restaurant is that? If u can't cook don't be a chef. We got the bill and we have $1 tip Bc of the bad service but the waitress asked us for another $1. Wtf??? Really? You're going to ask for tip when u gave us cold food??!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-16", "description": "I had the peanut & dried fish porridge & steamed shrimp rolls.  The porridge is sizzling hot and has lots of peanuts which is how I like it .  However, the consistency is a bit watery to my liking and there is not enough dried fish, which is supposed to give the porridge it's signature taste.  So one star deducted.  The steamed shrimp rolls are perfect.  The softness of the wrapping compliments well with the crunchiness of the shrimps.  Plus the sweetened soy sauce, I can't ask for anything more.  I wish I had room for the Chinese fried donuts which should go very well with the porridge...maybe next time!", "author": "Angela Y."}

So the waitress told me that I have to spend a minimum of \uff0430, so I was shocked and asking her \"really, minimum \uff0430?\" how does she expect one person to spend over \uff0430 for one person meal, right? Her instant reply was that something like well, you don't have money, then don't eat here. I was pissed and said \" not that I don't have money\" come on, do you expect someone who's only 90 lbs to order over 3 or 4 dishes and eat by herself? She can literally tell how small and skinny I am! And, How can she say such things like I can't eat there because of my financial status? Plus how can you tell how much money I have on my card? I was dressed properly and clean. I feel strongly offended, feeling the discrimination just for asking for clarification of price  against me Moments later, she's like ok fine, since you're by yourself, you still need to spend at least \uff0410 something(it actually means roughly \uff0410-15ish around that amount (\u5341\u51e0\u868a\uff09from this you can tell that she's not trying to be nice and help me out, but trying to squeeze every penny that she can. I can literally go to the store right next store, but I chose here just because the food there is decent, but I would never go back there because of the horrible customer service!", "author": "Lisa H."}
