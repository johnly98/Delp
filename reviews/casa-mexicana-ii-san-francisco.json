Normally at Mexican places I don't feel comfortable varying my orders too much, but everything from here is usually good. My wife has indicated that there has been once she got unexpected shells on shrimp, but otherwise we usually are happy to go here. Reason I don't go 5 stars is because I never left saying \"Wow, that was the best I have ever eaten.\"\n\nI go with the chimichanga, super burrito, or enchiladas and never complain. Like many mexican places, you can see everything right in front of you, so if the refried beans aren't up to your standards today then just skip it. I like the refried beans and the guacamole is usually pretty good, too. \n\nThere is plenty of variation in spiciness, but I would venture to say people more mild or medium in their salsa preferences probably like it more than the extreme spicy customers.\n\nI only once saw a customer get into an argument with the staff and that was 5 years ago. It was over the fact that she wanted a kids menu shrimp taco which wasn't really a choice for adults. That has since been corrected and I have observed several customers getting the single shrimp taco for $4.50 in the last few months. \n\nAnother place we have no problem sitting and eating at, but usually bring our grub home or to one of the local bars.", "author": "David A."}

Our lowered expectations were not even met.\n\nI ordered a Cochinita Super Burrito sans Sour Cream while the boyfriend had a Carne Asada Super Burrito. With our BOGO coupon plus 2 drinks, the meal came to ~$12. The order came with free chips and salsa which is also nice. The issue is not the price, clearly, but the food quality. Both of our burritos were so bland that they were a drag to eat. Like other reviewers mentioned, they were also super messy/watery but heavy at the same time. Each bite was a struggle. The salsas were also distinctly terrible. One of them tasted like it had cleaning fluid in it. Plus, the final straw, the place was dirty. Clearly none of the tables had been wiped down recently which is just nasty, especially considering the volume of customers.\n\nI would not come back, even if i had such a big craving for a burrito.

But it was the best option for a quick bite. I looked at the menu, at first thinking tacos. Then I saw they had sopes and that sounded good. And THEN, I saw they had breakfast all day... very intrigued.... huevos rancheros sounds yummy right now! \n\nIt was 3:30, so I thought maybe I should just get a sope.. kinda a snack. I ordered the sope to a grumpyesque looking woman, she said they were all out. I quickly decided that it was a sign that I was meant to get the huevos rancheros. And without hesitation I said \"I'll get the huevos rancheros then.\" \n\nStrangely, the woman's face lit up. She seemed absolutely delighted by my ordering huevos rancheros. Not sure if she likes making huevos rancheros, or she likes to eat them herself, or surprised I ordered it. She got crackin on frying up the tortillas right away. \n\nI got a lemonade fresca and some chips with salsa verde and started my late lunch. Everything was delicious! I always tell myself I want to go to mexican breakfast, but we never do. The ranchero sauce was perfect. I had gotten refried beans which were really good... very flavorful. The perfect bite is getting some of that yolk with that ranchero sauce and tortilla and a little rice and beans all mushed together. What a simple and satisfying dish!\n\nI could tell just by looking at the salsa verde that it was going to be good. Some places you look at the salsa and it looks watered down - but this place it's thick and flavorful with a really good kick. \n\nAs I sat there, I was very happy with my choice. I myself was delighted by being able to walk into some place by chance and getting a great mexican breakfast at 3:30 in the afternoon. This is the life!\n\nThis is my first time being here so I can't vouch for any other food. I'm surprised I came on yelp to find it was only 3 stars. Everything I saw looked really fresh and delicious. I probably wouldn't come all the way down there for a burrito. But breakfast all day? Hells yeah!

I dont know the history of ownership, but the place changed radically maybe 10 years ago when they seemed to expand the menu and streamline the operation. Quality of ingredients suffered or maybe everyone else just does a much better job preparing the fillings to make it interesting. My steak super burrito was more like steak soup in an tortilla. The quac and black beans were a runny mess. None of that would have mattered much if the ingredients had real flavor. I wish the place the best because 24th doesn't need another Nail shop.

It's not bad at all - and in many cases, it's pretty good.\n\nHowever....\n\nTacos - generally, you're supposed to pick up the corn tortillas with your hands to eat tacos.  Yes, sometimes it's messy.  But here at Casa Mexicana, they put SO MUCH on the tortillas, they really are on the plate just for show.  You cannot pick up the tacos to eat them - must be done with a SPOON (no, really).  And when you're done, you have a wet, soggy, nasty set of what could have been tasty corn tortillas.  That's not a taco - that's a pile of meat, beans, and rice with a corn tortilla garnish.  Yuck.\n\nThe burritos suffer from a similar problem - because they don't take the time to make sure the beans are properly drained, nor do they take the time to WRAP the burrito properly, after a couple bites it just falls apart into a pile of - wait for it - WET SOGGY NASTY MESS.  Again, here comes the spoon.  \n\nThe people are nice, service is fine, food tastes OK, but the prep is TERRIBLE.", "author": "Michael D."}

It has a little bit of everything for everyone. Walked into Casa Mexicana because it was one of the only restaurants open late in the neighborhood and all the locals were pouring in to grab a bite. \n\nThe menu was overwhelming and I wasn't sure exactly what to order. I like Mexican food but I'm not a die-hard mexcian food lover, i just like the food from time to time. Keeping simple as I'm exploring a new restaurant is always the best strategy to give it a try.\n\nCHORIZO TACO ($3) \nAL PASTOR TACO ($3)\n\nI'm not sure what lead me to try these to tacos, but its something new my palate hasn't tried. I almost ordered the TOFU TACO but switched up last minute.The preparation took a few minutes because they cook fresh on the spot so the wait is not my worry. Meat, veggies, flour tortilla all fresh.\n\nCHORIZO TACO - mexcian sausage with salsa. I went ahead with the rice, black beans, mozerella, cilantro and pico de galla on the side to add in. I've never had a chorizo taco and was pleased of the abundance of flavor and the crispiness of the burnt sections of the chorizo. And the flour tortilla was great by itself. \n\nAL PASTOR TACO - bbq pork with salsa. I went ahead with the rice, blackbeans, mozerella, cilantro, and pico de galla on the side to add in. the tenderness of bbq was succulant - those can be hard to find. I think i enjoyed the Al Pastor Taco over the Chorizo Taco. \n\nMaybe having the rice and black beans was a little too much for this tacos. I'm not a fan for their pico de galla, i'm use to chunky pico de galla but there pico de galla was kind of mushy. I was full after eating just one taco and when i had 2 tacos it covered the entire plate with food to eat. Definately portions are generous so do come here with an empty stomach, you get your money's worth. \n\n* Ambiance - clean and spacious\n* Prices - affordable\n* Service - great service and everyone was friendly\n* Portions - ALOT\n\nWill i be back?

And we were so excited to see such a promising Mexican restaurant in Noe Valley!  We had reluctantly given up our desire to eat Mexican in Mission because we did not see a single place to park after circling for about 20 minutes.  We should have kept circling down there.\n\nThe food took forever even though the restaurant was not particularly busy.  When the tamale platter finally arrived, the tamales were literally cold-- not room temperature, but chilly in the middle, and they the wrong type of beans were on the plate.  (Why ask the customer what kind they prefer if you are not going to make sure to give it to them?)\n\nThe pico de gallo had no jalapeno in it, so to me it was just a mushy tomato relish.  The tomatoes they used had that force-ripened flavor and texture, too.  We were given zero salsa on either platter and everything was bland.  The guacamole was totally ordinary.\n\nThe steak fajita was ok, but not particularly memorable.\n\nThis may be a place to go if you are hungry, not picky and are not in a hurry, but pass it by if you want really good Mexican flavors.", "author": "Donna K."}

It's nice to see how it's done.\n\nThere are more options available than most taqueria's I have frequented prior (for both carnivores and vegetarians alike) which is a huge plus in my opinion.

They don't charge for their fresh made chips, prices are real good and they have Mexican beers in the fridge. \n\nMy favorite thing here is the Azteca burrito - It's a super burrito with just rice, beans and meat inside, topped with enchilada sauce and melted cheese, and then topped with sour cream, salsa and guacamole.

I like how you can pick what type of tortilla (flour, wheat, or spinach) you want went your order a burrito/quesadilla. I often just get a regular burrito which is pretty big for about 4 dollars. The carnitas and grilled chicken are always safe bets. I feel like their food is slightly less greasy than at other Mexican places which is plus. They also give you free chips and salsa if you ask. I wish their spicy salsa had more of a kick though. \n\nThe one thing I would not recommend is the fish tacos.

Since then, I've broken up, made friends, annoyed my boyfriend, and even fallen in love... all because of CM dos. \n\nI first visited with my ex who used to frequent the dos when he lived in SF. He said it was the best place to eat because if you're poor you can buy a burrito for 5 bucks or so and spread it out over two meals. This was hardly the glowing review I wanted to hear of the restaurant where I would be having the first lunch of my SF vacation. My snobbery was quickly dismantled when a burrito the size of my calf appeared on my plate. Sold!\n\nWhen I moved to the city, I did exactly as my ex suggested. Some might say \"oh, how the mighty have fallen\" in a snarky tone, but they probably don't have many friends. \n\nNow, I can't consider any friendship valid unless it meets one of two requirements: I've introduced them to CM dos, or they already love it. Naysayers need not apply for my affection. \n\nPerhaps CM dos had something to do with my taste for latino men, perhaps it didn't; we'll never know for sure. But I now have a Mexican boyfriend, and CM dos is a site of contention for us. It's not that he dislikes the food (see aforementioned passage on friendship validity), but he rather dislikes how I pronounce the name of the restaurant: using a hard x sound instead of the more correct h sound. I don't remember if I was embarrassed or angered by this observation, but it probably didn't end well, so I'll let sleeping dogs lie. \n\nBut alas, should he ever leave me, I have a backup plan. Yelpers, I have fallen in kinda-love!... with the lady who works in the CM dos serving line. Her hoop earrings were just picante enough to catch my eyes, and I have a hunch that her nimble hands and knowledge of how to make my chili relleno burrito juuuust right would satisfy me to the end of my days. To be honest, I would probably love her mole chicken and chili rellenos more than her, but all relationships have their muddy areas. \n\nI'm not sure what else Casa MeXicana Dos has in store for me, but its track record is astounding.
