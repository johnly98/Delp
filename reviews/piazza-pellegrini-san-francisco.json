I had met my friend in the city for lunch, but didn't have anywhere in mind and ended up choosing this place because it had outdoor seating and it was a lively day. this place wasn't terrible, but it wasn't exactly very good. \nWe were seated immediately, and someone filled up our waters. The server seemed like he did NOT wanna be there. Kind of just hovered and looked at us expectantly for our orders and not really asking for it. We wrote it off as he was having a bad day, but it was seriously annoying when he just was being rude and there wasn't a single good interaction. \nYou do get complimentary bread, but that's something every Italian place should have anyway. I ordered some pasta and the noodles came out way over cooked and the sauce wasn't anything out of the ordinary. The portion sizes were pretty large though, so that was a sorta a plus. I just expected waaaaaaay more with the prices that they set their food at. I could get better service and quality of food at Olive Garden for cheaper. \nHonestly, wasn't really impressed and when I'm in down again I probably won't go out of my way to come eat here again.", "author": "Judy L."}

Everything else was okay - it was tasty, but nothing THAT special. At $19 each, I felt like it wasn't great value for money - but there were no real complaints. \nWe shared profiteroles for dessert - which were filled with gelato instead of the traditional whipped cream.

Definitely a good spot to chill and enjoy a sunny day.\n\nThe menu is limited, but it is a cafe. They do have my favorite staples though: pizza, gelato, desserts, and more. Portion size was refreshingly on point. I ordered one scoop of gelato and I must say it was quite the hefty scoop (See exhibit A in the pictures).\n\nThe ambience is serene, partially due to outdoor setting and the no smoking rules. The live music on the other hand... at first I thought: \"Great, who doesn't like music!\". Once I started listening, I thought \"This guy! He hates music! What is he doing to that song???\". I didn't know such public mutilation was legal.\n\nOnly other downside was that this is a hotspot for older homeless people. Two separate older homeless ladies came by to eat leftover pizza around us and ask for empty bottles. It's SF. It is what it is. One of the trade offs for an outdoor location I guess.\n\nProtip: Come for the gelato. Stay for the people watching.", "author": "Joel L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-30", "description": "We were deeply disappointed with our experience at this restaurant. Arriving for a late lunch at approximately for 4:00PM, we were informed there were no available tables in the dining room. We thus receded to two seats at the bar in the back of the restaurant. The first course consisted of a putative Caesar salad. The lettuce used for the salad was bagged and browning. No leaves were used in preparing the dish; rather, we were served only the brown stalks. The dressing was heavy and appeared lumpy and devoid of flavor. We then ordered a margheritta pizza with arugula, increasing the price of the pie an additional $2. The dish arrived as a margherrita pizza, which appeared to have a family-sized bag of arugula unloaded on the top. We then ordered gnocchi, which was nearly drowned in pesto. \n\nUnderpinning all of this was an environment which seemed to disintegrate before us. Half-opened boxes of supplies populated the bar, bread pulled hastily out of an aluminum crate was re-circulated to customers, children would screech and wail, making the environment unsettling and impossible to hold a conversation.  As a gesture of apology, our server gifted us a bottle of wine upon our prompt exit.", "author": "A L."}

I actually discovered it with the SO on UberEats, and then we walked by one day and decided that we had to come in, sit down and give it a try. \n\nI'm fond of the venue because it reminds me a lot of Italy with the open / outdoor tables. Admittedly, it's not super optimally located because when the cable car runs by (which it does), it can be kind of loud outside, but beyond that, on a nice SF day, it's really lovely to sit outside at this place. \n\nMy favorite dish here is the conchigliette with salsiccia and broccolini. It's so delicious on both eats and in person. I will say the most impressive thing about this dish it that it tastes just as good delivered as it does in the store. It's got a super addicting and tasty sauce, and the size is quite generous as well. \n\nMy only quip with this place is the prices, but I supposed that's the reality of SF these days. It's close to $20 for a bowl of pasta, which I know is SF prices. I do like the conchilgliette a lot, but it doesn't strike me as craft pasta like Cotogna or Central Kitchen, which is why I have an issue with the high price point. but it does taste good. \n\nOverall, service when we were in the restaurant itself was fine, nothing outstanding to report.

We had a server, whom we had not ever seen before. He told us he was French, when I asked for some bubbly to celebrate my birthday with my mom and tried to school me on the origins of champagne (which I'm quite familiar with) explaining to us that this is an Italian restaurant not a French one so they don't have champagne. So I brushed it off and corrected myself, asking for sparkling wine instead.... He continued to act like an ass and was rude and aggressive to the point that we had to ask for another server and I actually CRIED out of frustration. After which, the service was wonderful as usually, if not better. However, the French server continued to walk around us and make weird comments under his breath, throw things around while cleaning up tables, and just stand there staring at us. Our new server and the rest of the staff apologized to us many times and tried to make us feel better...

Locals don't much dine here as confirmed by the dearth of Bay Area yelp friends who've reviewed the place.  \n\nBut then...\n\nThe last time I tried to park for free in North Beach on a Saturday night I wound up parking on Lombard, west of Franklin and if you just said \"that's not in North Beach\" you're exactly right.  Neither was a parking spot.  Shortly after being alerted to where I'd be dining another text came through:  \"complimentary parking behind the restaurant, on Filbert\".  \n\nI arrived half disbelieving the offer of free parking but there it was:  A small unmanned lot with a handful of spaces reserved for patrons.  The Golden Unicorn.  \n\nDinner for four here (4 glasses of house wine, fried calamari appetizer, 2 pizzas, gnocchi, eggplant parmesan, and free parking) ran $30 apiece including tip.  The food was decent, the value superb.  We all walked out with doggie bags.  \n\nAt the end of our meal and desiring a nightcap elsewhere we briefly discussed moving our cars to the pay parking lot (next door on Filbert), asking our waiter if it'd be okay to leave the cars, and leaving the cars but saying nothing.  Risking the final option we returned a couple hours later relieved to find our cars right where we'd left them.  \n\nIf you're looking for ease of parking rather than evidence of your foodie pedigree Piazza Pellegrini is a worthy choice.  That they're not policing your post-meal whereabouts is a bonus, but let's just keep that little secret between you and me.", "author": "Tracey A."}

The food was exceptionally tasty. I had the Risotto Fruiti Di Mare and it was heavenly! It was cooked perfectly and had a generous amount of mussels, clams, and salmon.

I could not get enough, slightly sweet sauce but creamy and just amazing.\n\nThen for mains we ordered:\n- spinach ravioli with pesto\n- gnocchi\n- lamb shank\n- sausage and mushroom\n\nI took a (more like several) bites of each and I was glad I did. I don't usually eat pesto outside of my family's kitchen because my nonno's recipe is the best I've tasted. But this one passed my test! The pizza was very good also. Our server gave us this sort of spicy olive oil and according to my brother and dad, it was very yummy. The gnocchi was amazing. The lamb shank was seriously tender and the sauce paired with the palenta was brilliant. \n\nLastly, I had just a sip of the wines. The moscato was like alcoholic apple juice but even better.

One of the stuffing had fallen out of ravioli, swimming in the most unappetizing looking meat sauce. How is that acceptable in any restaurant I do not know. I would have sent it back but my friend was hungry and didn't want to wait any longer. As for me, I ordered a shrimp appetizer and the whole thing was so salty that I couldn't finish. The only thing that was decent that night was the wait staff was very pleasant. It was his fault that the food was horrific so we still tipped accordingly.\n\nIt's amazing to see such drastic differences in reviews here. Consistency is the key to a successful restaurant.

The shrimp seemed good quality, so why they marinated it in a saline solution overnight is a mystery.\n\nFinally, and worst of all was the meat ravioli.

He rudely pointed at the curb and barked, \"wait there.\" We both thought it was rude but we gave him the benefit of the doubt since we could tell he was really busy. We stood there for few minutes and the host eventually came back and told us it would be a 20 minute wait for a table. That seemed reasonable given how busy everything was so we agreed to wait. This is where it gets ridiculous. I asked the host if it was possible for me to use the restroom while we waited, and he told me that I should go and use the public restrooms in the park across the street. At that point, we turned and walked away.

I was really full after the meal and the ragu was flavorful and you can tell it had stewed for a long time. My only small criticism is that I wish the noodles were slightly slightly thinner.\n\nMy friends ordered the carbonara and the seafood linguine. They enjoyed the food a lot.

Their billboard outside claimed they have the best pasta and pizza, so we thought of giving it a try. We read that margherita pizza is not great, so we tried their anchovies and tomato pizza. It was unique. Maybe add little bit more anchovies. It wouldn't hurt to put basil on it. We also had their steamed clams and mussels appetizer. It came out good portion for appetizer. Tasty, but a little bit salty. There were about 15-20 clams n mussels. Combination of both dishes we ordered, goes well together. The disappointment was the bread they serve, which was cold.

Unfortuantely, it was Easter, so there were quite a number of closed restaurants, but we did remember having some good gnocchi here when we lived in the area, so we decided to come back in and have some more.\n\nSo we both ordered the gnocchi. We also ordered a bottle of wine and an order of mussels and clams to share to start with. The wine was corked, so they offered us another bottle which was alright, but probably wouldn't have been a bottle we would have chosen. Apparently they were redoing their wine list and only had a small selection of wine available.\n\nThe mussels were okay. Some were gritty, and I wasn't really wowed by them. The gnocchi also weren't as good as I remember. I remember more blue cheese flavor. But they were still nice.\n\nAll in all, the experience was fine, but my memories are either better than the reality, or things aren't as good as they used to be.

I agree with the poster who said it was a 3.5 but not quite a 4. \n\n I had the Chicken Parmesean and it was very tasty and generously sized. The pasta with it was alright, but I my chicken was perfectly fried and there was only a slight taste of olive oil, which I found appetizing. I split a prawn appetizer with my boyfriend, and it was light and perfect for a starter (although rather small with only 4 prawns). \n\nOur service was consistent and attentive. We never had plates stacking up on our table and everything we ordered came out in a timely manner. This cute little place is a good spot for a date as it feels intimate and rather cozy without being homey or divey. Nicely decorated. Our table was way too close to the table next to us, as the man right behind me had his chair up against mine. When busy, this place could get rather cramped. \n\nMy one complaint is the dessert. I ordered the Torta Cabrese and it was a real dud. The menu listed it as a flourless chocolate torte with raspberry coulis. It tasted more like a bitter chocolate brownie that had been made using really cheap cocoa. I've had this dessert before at many other restaurants, and it's usually a very dense cake with a drizzle of berry sauce. Here it was rather slimey and there were nuts in it, which is really odd--a cake of this sort never has nuts in it. The raspberry sauce was really tart. In the end I left most of it uneaten, and that says a lot for a sweet tooth like me.\n\nI'd come back, but would probably skip dessert.", "author": "Bianca U."}

It is a basic Italian joint, nothing fancy, which is fine with us. Our table was uneven and rocked back and forth the entire meal which was annoying and the waiter was indifferent to our plight. My wife had to send here salad back because all the lettuce was rotten. My antipasto salad was not much of a salad for $18. The half bottle of red wine with a twist off cap was not very good and was $22. Everything was mediocre at best and at those prices I would not return.", "author": "Eric N."}

When visiting Frisco, you can't help but notice this one of a kind authentic Italian joint when walking the beautiful streets of north beach. The outdoor seating area is relatively spacious and bodes well with the laid back atmosphere of San Francisco. Reservations aren't always necessary, but large groups seem to be welcome at this joint, so on weekends it might be a good idea.\nOn to the food... wow. Growing up in an Italian household, I find myself consistently disappointed by places calling themselves \"authentic\", but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The eggplant is especially exquisite, the pasta is perfectly al dente, and the meats are succulent. Order a peroni, park yourself outside in the cool north beach air and watch the city go by your table. A definite must try if in the city by the bay.", "author": "VJ W."}

The pizza was ok but not the great. \n\nGrilled Scallops w/ Risotto ($26.95) - The scallops were too salty and the rice was too soft.. \n\nAlso the complimentary bread was not good.

After driving around for what felt like hours, we finally just pulled in to the first open street parking we could find. By chance, that stall happened to be right across the street from Piazza Pellegrini. \n\nBy the end of our meal our party of five were all stuffed. We were seriously happy to have stumbled across this place. We all sampled each others dishes and I can honestly say that I enjoyed everything. I can't remember what the name of my dish was, but I know it was angel hair pasta with a light tomato-basil sauce. It was awesome. The portion size was pretty deceiving, in a good way, though! When it first arrived at our table, I thought, \"Oh, this looks kind of small, I might still be hungry.\"  The joke was on me because the bowl apparently has a lot of depth, (it looked like just a regular plate) so when I began mixing my sauce in, the portion literally seemed to grow right in front of my eyes. It was definitely a good portion to price ratio! I got about halfway through it before I started forcing myself to eat more simply because it was that good. \n\nFor dessert we tried the Hazelnut gelatto filled cream puffs and the Creme Brulee. Both were awesome. The Creme Brulee has a lemony taste to it, so not everyone will like it, though.\n\nAll of the servers were friendly and quick. Mix that with great food and you've got yourself a winning combo. I would definitely come back if I'm ever in SF again!", "author": "Skye T."}

I asked our waiter if we could cancel the meal. He then yelled at me, drawing the attention of other diners, then went to my guest ad yelled at them. \n\nOverall, this was shocking and the worst service I've ever had.

We waited 40 mins to be seated, but we didn't mind thinking the food would be worth it. Waiting outside, we got glimpses of the food of those dining outside & it all looked delicious.\n\nThe food here smells and looks better than it tastes. The pasta is bland, flavorless, and slightly over cooked. The pizza is just as bland. The only good thing I was able to try here was their lentil soup. Though it was very thick, the soup was the best thing that came to our table because it was seasoned at least. \n\nI ordered their angel hair pasta which was supposed to come with basil, garlic, and tomatoes.  Basil and garlic are quite strong flavors and somehow they managed to deliver watery tomato pasta to my plate. It was absolutely bland and disappointing. I thought it was just my plate thinking I ordered the wrong item off the menu, but was told by the rest of my party how disappointing their food was as well. The main issue seemed to be a lack of flavor. One of my friends ordered their shrimp pasta & was given a plate full of pasta and only 4 shrimps. Not worth the $25 price tag. We ordered their Margherita pizza to share & it was just as flavorless as everything else we ordered. Only one of my friends enjoyed his meal saying the meatballs were good and generously sized. I did like that their ingredients tasted fresh. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone as its waaaay overpriced for the quality food they prepare.

Excellent, attentive service (which resulted in an uber-tip). \n\nTHE SITCH: My companion ordered the Farfallette al Salmone ($18) and was extremely happy with the creamy, salmony sauce that generously covered a large bowl of little farfallette bows. I was ridiculously happy with my half order of Spaghetti alla Carbonara ($17) that I split with my other dining companion.

Again pricey at $25.\n\nIf the food came out in a timely manner and the portions were more satisfying, I would have been ok with things. I would have accepted the SF/touristy pricing.

But this was different.  We were greeted quickly, sat outside (nice, but there was broken glass all around the table) and ordered a $35 bottle of Syrah. Our server told us it was a house special, a good bottle, and were were thrilled.  Twenty minutes later he came back with the wine and took our order. Way too long when there were multiple servers and 4 bussers for the small-ish restaurant. After we ordered we had hoped we'd get some bread (like other tables had) but didn't see a server, or the bread, for 20 minutes or so. They brought the bread out with the food, weird and poorly timed but at this point I'm still not super upset. The pasta (house-made they say) was so overcooked it literally just fell apart into mush. It was poorly flavored, and was the most boring pasta with short-rib ragu I've ever had. It was the most boring pasta, period, I've ever had, actually. My friend's food was ok, but looked like it came from Olive Garden.\n\nNow lets get to the really terrible part, the stuff that makes me give them one star. While I was sitting there I twice saw and heard the owner (who is also the host) turn away a dark-skinned person then seat the next walk-up within minutes. He told a black woman they wait was \"very long and she should try somewhere else\" and he ignored a man (who was maybe Indian?) Both of those people and their group talked about how they were treated as they walked away (hence, by me) and noted that other people seemed to be getting much friendlier service. Seriously, I couldn't believe it, I've never witness anything like it, but it made me eager to get the hell outta that place. He was seating many people during our meal and the difference between how he treated these two individuals, and other people was staggering.  He was all jokes and smiles with everyone else and on these two occasions he was flat-out rude. \n\nAfter me and my friend paid the bill we were taking turns using the restroom and while I was away from the table our server told my friend he should get up and leave because he needed that table. We weren't sitting there for more than 10 minutes after the bill came so this was totally unexpected and completely rude.

After rounds of getting lost trying to look for this one restaurant only to find that we needed reservations, we stumbled across the closest, most attractive dining place we could find - Pellegrini. It had beautiful lights strung across the front and seemed to have a good amount of people waiting outside for seats. So Pelligrini it was. \n\nThe first person to greet us was really kind and told us that we would be seated in roughly 5-10 minutes. BUT, we ended up waiting an hour! I don't think I would've minded as much if we were given seats before the others that came. All the tables were the same size, just some had 2 seats and others had 3. I was really disappointed to find that people who came in 3's later during the night were seated right away when we'd been waiting outside in the cold for an hour. But at least the lady was kind enough to offer us temporary indoor seating for the wait.\n\nThe waiter we had was really sweet. He definitely made the night a little better, which was needed because I had twisted my ankle 3 times during the search for the other restaurant (downside of heels!) and was hungry and cold. The food was alright, and each was a bit different:\n\n          Appetizer: We ordered from the special menu and got the non-fried calamari, which was a BIG mistake b/c the calamari tasted really raw. We unfortunately ended up masking the taste with the lemons they provided :/ I guess when life gives you lemons, squeeze them all! (Or just get the fried calamari ;D )\n\n          Pasta: We ordered the penne arrabiata w/ spicy tomato sauce and the shell pasta with spicy italian sausage (yes we're a fan of spice!). I liked my pasta - it had the perfect spiciness level to keep my nose intact, but I liked the shell pasta dish more. The only downside to the shell pasta was that it wasn't left to boil long enough so it came out a little harder than expected. But it was nonetheless good when mixed with the veggies and sausage.\n\n         Dessert: Dessert was (and always is) the best part of the meal. I can still taste the apple pie - just thinking of it makes my mouth water! It wasn't called apple pie on the menu, but it consisted of glazed apple cuts on a really yummy pastry. So apple pie-like.

Service was fine and we were seated right away on a Sunday night even though we were a party of 8. Needless to say, 18% gratuity was already added at the end. The bill ended up being roughly $30 per person with tip included because we divided it evenly.\n\nIn my opinion, the food is fine but it's not worth the prices. I didn't feel like eating a lot so I ordered minestrone soup and a cup of tea. The soup was more like a bowl with tons of vegetables tossed in. I was hoping for more soup in there but there was hardly any. The tea was hot water with a tea bag for $4.95. Are you serious? They took away my cup of water and tea bag when I asked for more water and let me choose another tea but I honestly would have been fine with just more hot water added. \n\nWe split a bruschetta as an appetizer. Everyone ended up getting their own pasta dish (except me) and even though the portions looked small, everyone was full enough.

When we arrived this time, the place was packed. I asked if we could eat on the side patio and the maitre d', said yes, thereby getting a table immediately. After we sat down, all of the tables on the patio were occupied within minutes. The patio turned out to be very pleasant, once the heaters were ignited. We were not on the sidewalk but next to it, so that people watching was quite entertaining and the Pelligrini cable car and multicolored lights strung over our heads added to the North Beach effect. \n\nThe food was delicious and excellently prepared. The daily menu is handwritten and extensive.  On this visit we were starving and ordered two appetizers with wine. A  fried calamari and the melon wrapped in prosciutto with fresh basil and a light drizzling of olive oil.   I can not believe we ate all of it!  We then were sensible and shared the risotto pescatore, meaning risotto with clams, mussels, octopus  and shrimp. Perfectly done! \n\nThe Italian waiter was also excellent and made the dining experience unique and special. He was extremely busy but was always there at the right time.  When I ordered decaf coffee (okay, I'm a wimp), the busboy said there was no decaf. When our waiter discovered this, he personally searched and did whatever, because minutes later, a decaf coffee, brewed perfectly was before me. That is great service! \n\nDinner was followed by a stroll up Columbus Avenue in all its colorful splendor.  Crowded with people enjoying a meal along the bustling sidewalks, cafes and Gelato shops brimming with happy customers.

As for the food, well...its more than a little uninspired, and reminds me of frozen food with some canned spaghetti sauce.  The fritto misto was tasteless.  The veal was pounded and fried within an inch of its life.  The risotto was missing the texture and the taste was bland. The vegetables were either boiled or steamed with butter with no spices.

It looks great and is in a great location but sadly does not live up to how it looks.  I've never been somewhere as overpriced as this place. The caprese salad was 14.95... 15 dollars for 4 tomato slices and 4 pieces of mozzarella.  I still can't believe that.  The other salads on the menu were all around 9 dollars.  For 15 I would've thought there'd be a huge portion but no, just barely enough for two people, let alone our party of 4.  The chicken caesar salads we got were good but not amazing. I got ravioli while my girlfriend and grandmother got minestrone soup.  My dad got some pork chops dish.  My grandmother and dad liked what they got but my girlfriend and I weren't too impressed.  There wasn't a lot of ravioli and it tasted a little weird, as if the meat wasn't fresh.  The minestrone was good but didn't have noodles or beans, so it was barely minestrone.  We also got two orders of garlic bread which were 6.95 per order and only came with 7-8 pieces of bread.  Bread is cheap and so is garlic so I'd expect a little more, not as over priced as the caprese though.  My dad also got a lemonade, and we got an appetizer of prosciutto with cantaloupe.  The prosciutto was actually pretty good, and the portion was great!   I felt like we actually got our 15 dollars worth.  Our meal altogether was around 150 dollars, which is ridiculous.  Do not go here unless you have serious money.  Seriously, please don't go here.", "author": "Joe C."}

After all, how bad can it be?  Well...pretty bad.  We were seated right away, and the service was fine.  The problems with the food began right away.  The bread was tasteless and chewy - more like Safeway bakery bread, than Italian bread.  We ordered the \"special\" \"homemade\" crabcakes to start.  They may have been made on premises, but the crab was definitely not fresh.  They were flabby, thin, oily, and consisted primarily of Progresso breadcrumbs.  \nOn to the pasta.  I make a pretty good Carbonara at home, and was curious to see what a good restaurant version would be like.  I guess I should have waited until we were at a good restaurant. Here, it was absolutely disgusting.  The spaghetti was drowned in a watery, oily, eggy substance, which tasted primarily of raw garlic and green onions.  I have only ever wanted to send back any restaurant dish once before, and if it weren't for our upcoming show, this would have been the second.  It was practically inedible.  I ate it only because I was starving and in a rush to get to the show.  The best part was the semi-cooked bacon, which I picked at to get some protein out of the meal.  I can't recall ever leaving a dish of pasta half-eaten, but I couldn't bear to finish it.\nMy partner had the Fettuccine all\u00b4 Amatriciana billed as \"Saut\u00e9ed onion, pancetta and Gino's meatballs (Winner of 2009 Boss of the Sauce). The sauce had no discernable evidence of pancetta or onion, it did have a distinct metallic taste of canned tomatoes (generic brand, not San Marzano). The fettucine was harshly over cooked, allowing him to only eat about an inch of pasta at a time.  The meatballs had a passable consistency, but the flavor was hidden by the boss of the sauce. All dishes were garnished with what may be finely chopped (dried?) parsley (see other people's photos). \nThe $8 chianti was a decent pour and tasty.\nWe chose not to even bother with desserts, because there was just no hope after 3 fails and bad bread.  \nI hate writing bad reviews of places, but this one is well-deserved.  The prices they charge for such mediocre food is criminal.\nService was friendly and we have no complaints in that regard.", "author": "L. S."}

I've tried a lot of Italian at a lot of places all over, but this one was disappointing.  I think this store is a bit more Americanized and catered for tourists.

I ordered the shell pasta with broccoli and spicy sausages (remember I don't like spicy) and it was delicious. The taste was great with garlic. Sis had her usual italian restaurant dish of spaghetti and the meatballs were HUGE and obviously hand-made! She had a dessert though I don't know which one but she described it as four round puff-balls filled with ice cream, covered with poured strips of chocolate, while I settled for a latte espresso. The only bad of this location was that after ten minutes of sitting there initially, I got up and cornered the waiter next to the kitchen to say we were ready to order; he followed me to the table and took our orders. Otherwise, very delicious food and great smells. No parking, only street parking and a garage around the corner....  it was half filled when we entered and when we left it was packed.

The scallops where huge, plump, and cooked perfectly.  I would of liked at least one more scallop on the plate.

I ordered the Insalata Greca (Greek salad) with prawns and my beau ordered the Conchiglie con Broccoli e Salsicce (shell pasta with broccoli and sausage; the waiter was very helpful with our pronunciation). We had to wait a little while, but we could hear the food being prepared in the kitchen right behind us; I could smell the aromas coming from the window! We soaked up the beautiful summer weather while we waited.\n\nMy salad was a bit small, but very tasty. It had romaine lettuce with cucumbers, tomatoes, red and yellow peppers, olives, and feta cheese. It came with three grilled prawns on a skewer. I enjoyed it, but wished there had been more! Also, the prawns were a bit oily for my taste, but they were well-flavored. The Conchiglie dish was \"stupendous,\" said my boyfriend. It was classic Italian cooking--simple, but rich in flavor. The hostess had also said that the pasta was homemade, which makes it extra special.\n\nWhile we were eating, a tour bus passed by, and the driver announced on his PA that this was his favorite restaurant in the North Beach area, with delicious homecooked food and a \"bella donna\" (the hostess) in front. She blushed, and we nodded in agreement.\n\nUsually we don't order dessert after lunch, but we were curious. The hostess recommended the tiramis\u00fa (she said it was the best she had ever had), but we went with the Macedonia di Frutta, which was just fruit salad with a scoop of vanilla bean gelato on top.

We had not received any bread or drinks, unlike many of the other tables that had arrived after us. When our server, Rosario, did finally arrive, he took our orders and rushed off. The rest of the night we saw our server only when the food came out, and when he wanted the check. When he brought the food out, he offered some pepper for the top. When we said yes, he gave one careless twist, barely putting on any pepper, and walked off (not asking how much we wanted). When my girlfriend asked for some Parmesan for her main dish, he gave her a rude look, and, after a two minute wait, he came back to give a quick two swipes of grated cheese, putting on very little, before turning his back and walking away (again not asking if she would like more). Additionally, I was forced to ask one of the bus boys for a refill on my diet coke because our server, Rosario, was too busy flirting for a good 5 minutes with women at all his other tables. \n\nDisregarding the terrible and disrespectful service, the food each time has been excellent. The bruschetta is a fantastic appetizer, with four slices (two with tomatoes and two with mushroom and mozzarella). Additonaly, the entrees are well presented and delicious.

The second time I ordered Chicken Saltimboca alla Piemontese and my girlfriend ordered the Conchiglie con Broccoli e Salsicce. All of them I would highly recommend.

This was the first restaurant we stopped to read the menu at and quickly made a decision to stay.  Man, were we lucky.  \n\nWe had a great meal!  We all had pasta, I had the puttanesca, my dad an alfredo with prawns, and my mom the frutti di mare.  The portions were generous and each dish was so flavorful.  We were shocked at the amount of seafood in my moms dish.  Some restaurants tend to skimp on the amount of mussels/clams in the dish.  Not this place.  We counted something like 12 bivavles in her dish, plus the giant prawns and fish pieces.  \n\nFor dessert, we had the tiramisu and the apple crostata.  Both were diet-breaking deliciousness! \n\nOur waiter was so attentive and personable.  He made beer and wine recommendations for my dad, and my dad was very pleased with what was served.  We were very impressed with the flavor of the food, the staff and the atmosphere of the place.  The hostess was very warm and sat us immediately.

(2) Buy bread more than twice a week - my roll was so stale and dry it was falling apart. (3) Roast the lamb for your roast-lamb \"panini\" more than once a week. When it starts to turn bad, no amount of cucumber relish can hide the sour taste of taint.  (4) Spend more time in the kitchen, less time yelling your specials to passing tourists on the double-decker bus.\n\nTo sum up, I think I may have found the worst excuse for an Italian restaurant in North Beach.

What else do you need to know?\n\nWe were feeling lazy and hungry a few weeks ago, and this place is 1 block from our apartment, so we decided to give it another try, although we weren't overly impressed in the past.\n\nIt was a Sunday evening, but just to be sure, we called to see if we could be seated if we came right by. Sure, the man on the phone said. I have a table ready.\n\nOnce we arrived, we had to try to convey this to the (new) (English-challenged) hostess.  After conferring with someone inside a few times, she came back to say to it would be 10-15 minutes.  We're irritated, but she's charming, and instead of walking away, we take a seat outside as she suggested.\n\nAfter a bit, a waiter came by with menus. We explained we were just waiting for a table inside. He said, oh, you can't sit here.  Wait at the bar.  Are there 2 seats at the bar? we ask.  Yes, sure, he says. \n\nAre there? Of course not.  We really should have left at this point, but we see an empty table for 2 waiting to be set.  So I take the one seat at the bar and order a glass of wine.  We watch the table, watch the waiters come and go, and nothing happens.  No one looks at us, and no one sets the table. The wine?  $9/glass, it's a horrible cheap Pinot.  That is the final straw.  We pay for the untouched wine and walk out.\n\nDown the street, we had a perfectly lovely, delicious meal with superb service at Pinoccho.  Morale of the story:  don't be so damn lazy.  There are much better restaurants than this within a a few blocks or less.", "author": "Martha M."}

I have to give it a 5 to offset all the negative reviews.\n\nFirst, if you come to a real Italian restaurant, don't expect the most attentive service.  They'll ignore you for a bit, and then treat you like you're family.  It's just the way it is.  Get over it, and be more aggressive when you need something.\n\nOnly order:  \n- Bruschetta.  They usually put truffle oil on the mushrooms, but they haven't been doing so the last few times.\n- Caprese salad.  This is tomato, mozzarella, and basil salad.  Something about the mozzarella cheese brine gives it a slightly salty flavor to it.  It might not be for everyone, but it's a total homerun for me.  \n- Ravioli with homemade pesto sauce.  I've gone here with a group of 5.  We ordered 5 raviolis.  See my pictures.  Enough said.\n\nEverything else, I don't know.  I haven't strayed from my normal.", "author": "Steve A."}

I got the calzone and I think it was the best I've had, the dough was very crispy on the inside so that when you bite into it there is a nice crunch sound. On the inside, the dough was really tender so it wasn't like you had a difficult time biting and eating it at all. They were very generous with the stuffing, a lot of vegetables that were also crisp, which is surprising because its really easy to overcook the vegetables in the calzone because the vegetables get cooked much faster than the dough. So when the vegetables were crisp and not mushy, I think it made me really appreciate the dish. The meat was very flavorable and tender. It was a great dish and you got a lot of food for what you paid for, which I do not think is a lot for good Italian food. I have paid a lot more for much worse quality food.\n\nI loved that all the servers had Italian accents, just makes the whole place seem more authentic. They would say, Chao Bella, to all the ladies as they left and who doesn't want to be called a bella after a lovely dinner. \n\nTo top this place off, it is also a favorite of local SF celebrities. The night I went, Santana, yes the great latin guitar legend was dining there as well. Everyone chatted with him and it was very peaceful, and he seemed to be really good friends with the owners. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place, it was my first stop on my SF vacation and if I ever head back to SF I know I will stop by this place again.", "author": "sherry w."}

I have never eaten here and cannot include the food.\n\n**********************************************************\n\nAfter dinner at one of my favorite restaurants (1550 Hyde) and then watching Jeanine Garofalo at Cobb's Comedy Club, we took a stroll up the block to find a place for desserts when we fell upon a cute restaurant with outdoor seating and heat lamps.\n \nWe peeked in and asked a random waiter (who was through and through Italian) if we could be seated just for desserts.  He was SO pleasant in welcoming us and told us to take any seat we wanted as he brought us dessert menus.  We opted for the affogado and tiramisu, and ordered two Cafe Americanos.  Our waiter would often come by to check on us, chit chat, and basically made this short visit memorable.  In fact, every waiter we dealt with while here was #1 Italian (which always helps making a place feel authentic) and #2 - SO FRIENDLY.\n \nThe AFFOGADO blew us away.  Excellent!!\nThe Tiramisu was OK - - I've had much, much better elsewhere, including House of Prime Rib (oddly enough) or Antica.\nThe coffee was spectacular... and spectacularly STRONG, just the way I like it.\n \nAfter about 40 minutes, we paid the bill and were about to leave when I spotted a waiter out on the street watching us.  As we got up, he asked us if we needed a cab and when we answered to the affirmative, he proceeded to run into the street to hail us one himself.  \nWow.\nSure, we tipped him, but after he hailed us one, he was already walking away telling us to have a wonderful night, obviously not even expecting a tip.\n \nI love places like this.\n \nMind you - after dinner, a show and sitting at this adorable restaurant, it was nearing midnight.  This means I drank an awesome cup of espresso and hot water at 11:30 PM.\n \n....\n............\n.....................\n.............................\n \nI was up until 6:45 AM the next morning, laying awake in my bed, blinking at the ceiling, processing all sorts of random thoughts, and pondering the meaning of life.  \n \nThis is downside #4232622 of getting older - caffeine actually works when I don't want it to, and doesn't work when I need it to work.\n \nThank you, Pellegrini-men!", "author": "Grace K."}

I will never be the first black US President.  I will never menstruate.  I will never find \"The Hills\" or \"The City\" of even marginal value.\n\nAnd the food of Piazza Pellegrini just isn't good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-22", "description": "Huh.\n\nAfter a Friday night of browsing Open Table for a last-minute Saturday night reservation for four, I decided on Piazza Pellegrini as it seemed most perfectly to meet my necessary criteria: Italian, central, interesting menu with lots of options, good atmosphere, moderately priced. Check, check, check, check, check.\n\nAt crunch time, we were pleasantly surprised by the hustle and bustle, and the fact that we'd been given a pretty good table. The specials menu also looked great (although obviously had already decided what I was having 24 hour prior via online menu. Roasted chicken.)\n\nI was a little disappointed that, after a warm welcome from the host, it took them a good 15+ minutes to take our drinks orders, and another 10 or so to take our meal orders. There was also no bread on the table, and after requesting some to accompany our antipasto dish, it came rather stale and unappetizing. But bread alone maketh not a meal, and so I continue...\n\nThe wine list is pretty pricey, and we ordered a bottle of Prosecco because it was the cheapest option and I'm classy like that. As far as Prosecco goes it was pretty nice: slightly sweet, clean refreshing taste. The aforementioned antipasto selection was simple yet nice, and the bruschetta dish was tasty. Promising start.\n\nWhen the main dish arrived, however, I was sadly disappointed. I was expecting a gloriously juicy half-chicken and a plate of fresh vegetables. What I got was a rather small half-chicken where the preparation emphasis had clearly been on the skin, which I wasn't too interested in eating. As birds go, it offered very little meat, and the breast was really, really dry. The vegetables had a strong butter taste that detracted from their flavors, and the potatoes were a little mealy.\n\nAs we pitched in for the menu, I calculated that my meal had cost me $50, AND I grabbed a snack later that evening as that mealy bird was less than filling. Bottom line: good atmosphere, waiters are very nice but perhaps less attentive than they might be, and the food was pretty mediocre. I probably could have done a better job at home for much cheaper.\n\nAnd FYI, offering your customers good bread from the get-go is a pretty cheap way to raise the bar a little, AND it covers your bases for your meagre chicken meal.

The gorgonzola was very smooth and light, however, and that's a plus.  I liked the cheese even though I'm not a cheese fan generally.\n\nWe then had the sausage and mushroom pizza.  The sausage was spicy and added a lot of kick to the pizza's flavor.  The crust was thin, which we liked also.  While not spectacularly tasty, it was a decent job I thought.\n\nWe also split the ravioli with meat sauce.  We read somewhere that Piazza Pellegrini is famous for its home-made ravioli and lasagna.  The ravioli itself was very smooth, soft, and palatable, but the meat sauce was very plain -- too plain in fact.  \n\nIf I have to think of one word to describe their food, it would be \"ordinary.\"  Not terrible in any way, just not special.  Given the so-so quality of the food, we skipped dessert and went elsewhere for ice-cream instead.\n\nThe other thing that kinda bugged me about the place was that it's too small.  They had many tables outside on the sidewalk, but there was a LOT of pedestrian traffic and also many people who were waiting to get in, so it just looked very uncomfortable to be eating outside.  The restaurant inside was also very small -- they had an open kitchen, but the ventilation wasn't great.  At one point they made something smokey, and I just wanted to finish the meal and get out.

This was the best \"Cioppino\" ever, exceptionally fresh, prepared authentically with high-quality ingredients and tons of crab, muscles, clams and fish served in a huge bowl. \n\nHe also recommended the best \"red\" wine from Southern Italy, forgot the name (sorry), which blended extremely well with the \"Cioppino\". Excellent service, our waiter and waitress made sure we didn't lack anything e.g. bread, olive oil, water, and they replaced five times the big plate to discard the shells from the \"Cioppino\".

While the ribbon pasta and short rib were indeed tasty, there was definitely something wrong with the carrots that they added. I love carrots but these carrots must have been soaked in vinegar or something because it immediately gave me that weird tang in my mouth which told my brain that something wrong.  Unfortunately, my belly screamed hunger and so I continued eating a couple more until . . . I realized that there was definitely something wrong with the way the carrots were cooked.

Yes, you can try to put your name down when you enter, but the place is small and you may not get your pick of seats.

They also have seats outside, but I didn't see any heat lamps, so if beware if you wanna brave it outside.\n\nMenu: good choices. Major kudos for not sticking patrons with the Valentine's Day prix fixe menu. I know some of you like it, but sometimes it's nice to have a dinner with choices and not 4-6 courses. Good vegetarian options, as my gf ordered the eggplant parmagiana, which she loved. I ordered the linguine with chicken over pesto. I rarely eat pesto but I think this might have gotten me hooked.  Went well with the spinach salad and paired well with the chianti.\n\nWe shared the ice cream with espresso. Tasty, but after a few minutes, it pretty much turned into an iced coffee. Next time, with a bigger appetite we're having the tiramisu.\n\nOverall, I had a great time. You always gotta deal with parking in North Beach, so be prepared. Get there early, take a cab if you take the BART, or cough up $20 at the lot next door.  Very romantic North Beach spot, for all the guys looking for places to take your lady in North Beach, I'd recommend here, Panta Rei, or Steps of Rome.

The seafood in the cioppino was very fresh and the tomato broth they used was delicious. With that said, I've never had cioppino before, so I have no point of reference.

It came with oil and balsamic vinegar which was in a small, very small dish.  Oil and  vinegar don't mix so if you put it in a small dish the oil is on top and the vinegar is on the bottom, making it impossible to get both on the bread.

When we ordered, he repeated everything in Italian. Then, when one of us asked to take the food home in a bag, he said \"Cosa?\" I think because he didn't hear. Then upon returning with the doggie bag, he said, \"Ecca la cassa\" (Here is the box). Really funny. REALLY ITALIANOOO yeah this place was good. I would go here again.

There were lots of enticing choices, but I ended up going with something that I usually don't get.  I was glad I did, because it turned out to be pretty darn good.  The meat was juicy and literally fell off the bone.  It came with roasted vegetables, but I was too busy chowing down on the meat to care too much.  \n\nTo finish off the meal, I got profiteroles for dessert.

Having tried many Italian restaurants in North Beach and being disappointed, Piazza Pellegrini was a pleasant surprise. Have walked by this place dozens of times not giving it much interest. I am pretty hard to please when it comes to Italian food, mostly because it's really not that hard to make, and shouldn't cost a fortune.\n\nThe bread brought out before the meal was quite good. Having foccacia in there was a nice change. The oil and vinegar combo was really tasty for some reason -- they must have used some really good balsamic vinegar. Although it was nice to have some foccacia included in the bread basket, Piazza Pellegrini should think about walking up the block to Liguria to get some REAL focaccia to serve to customers.\n\nHad the gnocchi with sausage, peas, and asparagus, and was very happy overall with the taste and the size of the portion. \n\nYes, it is in a strange location. The intersection of Columbus and Filbert is a little funky and doesn't lend itself well to corner restaurants or shops, so you don't get the same sidewalk cafe feel that you would further up the hill on Columbus.

A good friend from college lives in the city, so I asked her for advice on where to get some good Italian food. She suggested North Beach and said I could go into any of the restaurants (she promised there'd be tons along Columbus!) and I was guaranteed something to write home about.\n\nSo Peter and I ventured from our hotel on Fisherman's Wharf (what a tourist trap!) and drove over to the North Beach area (I would've walked if I had the clothes to withstand the wind -- no one told me SF gets so windy at night!). Piazza Pellegrini was one of the first restaurants we saw, and we couldn't miss it with the twinkle lights on the awning.\n\nWe parked right nearby (there was one open parking space right next to the restaurant) and quickly got a table inside.\n\nThere were tables right outside, and they had a heat lamp so it was tempting to sit inside -- but like I said, I wasn't dressed for colder weather, so we decided to snag a table indoors. We got a table for two in their crowded dining room (really liked that it was crowded -- kind of gave it a homey atmosphere). It was too brightly lit, which I thought gave the place a sense of intimacy. All the tables had white tablecloths and the place was definitely clean, with a good ambience.\n\nThe bread that came out was actually good -- moist and soft. That's always my biggest qualm with bread. I hate the kind that cuts up your mouth when you eat it, so this bread was enjoyable (as was the dipping oil that came with it).\n\nI decided on Cappellini con Pomodorini (angel hair pasta with fresh cherry tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and basil, in a light tomato sauce). Peter got the Fusilli con Pollo (fusilli pasta with fresh chicken breast and basil, in tomato sauce).\n\nWe got our dishes pretty quickly, and our waiter was quite amiable. He gave us quick service and wasn't too overbearing nor inattentive. He had a slight accent, which always helps you feel the food is more authentic (hey, not trying to sound ignorant there -- I'd say the same about Chinese restaurants, too).\n\nMy Cappellini con Pomodorini was delicious! There's a place back in Houston that makes the same dish, but it has this weird Chinese takeout aftertaste to it. But nooooo... this dish was absolutely fabulous! I could taste the garlic (I love garlic!) subtly, and there wasn't too much olive oil or tomato sauce. I think I liked how light the sauce was, too -- and angel hair pasta is always fun to wind around your fork.\n\nPeter's Fusilli con Pollo wasn't quite up to par, hence my taking a star off. The chicken was a bit dry, I'd say, and I didn't like the taste of his tomato sauce as much as my own. (Pete definitely took forkfuls of my pasta off my plate, which is how I also knew his wasn't quite up to par...)\n\nAll in all, the visit was a success -- we were famished and I got my fill of yummy Italian food (although Pete's dish was lacking...) and a pleasant atmosphere (with easy parking!).", "author": "Helen C."}

So accommodating, in fact, that they presented us with a delicious plate of free appetizers due to the fact that we couldn't be seated for our 8:30 reservation on time because of a table of lingering diners.

By the time we reached Powell and Columbus we were so famished that we jumped into the first place we saw, which happened to be PP.\n\nFrom the time we got there I was not impressed.  To sum it up, the servers barely acknowledged the outside crowd (The guys next to us sat there for almost 15 minutes before someone actually came to take their order and bring them water).  We had to ask three different people to bring us our check, I actually had to get up to go inside and ask for our check. NO ONE checked on us at all throughout the course of our meal, we had to flag down a busboy to refill our empty water glasses, and the food was, as my other-half put it \"entry-level\" for Italian at best.  I was seriously ticked off by the time we left.

The wife and I went there for the first time the other day and overall it is a four star place, based on the strength of the main events: the appetizers, salads and the main courses.\n\nThey started off with a mixed bag: bad bread (tasteless) with excellent olive oil/balsamic vinegar dip. The wife loved the balsamic vinegar so much we bought a bottle. Speaking of bottles, we brought our own bottle of wine, which the waiter gladly opened and poured (we had him bring an extra glass so that he could have a taste too).\n\nWe started with the Timballo di Verdura appetizer, which consists of layers of grilled vegetables, tomatoes and mozzarella. It was great - we could have had two or three of these. She had the Insalta Mista while I had the spinach salad. She loved hers and I liked mine (I've had better, but this was good). For the main course she had the Farfallette al Salmone Affumicato (bowtie pasta with smoked salmon, peas, dill and vodka, in light cream tomato sauce) while I had the crab ravioli with pesto sauce. Both of these were perfectly done and tasted excellent. My raviolis were stuffed with great tasting crab, and the blend of ingredients in her dinner worked perfectly.\n\nSo after starting off on a sour note with the bad bread (but excellent dip) and then having an excellent meal we finished with the desserts. Neither one (my Torta Caprese - light flourless chocolate cake served with raspberry sauce - and her Crostata di Mele - crisp short pastry crust topped with apples and apricot glaze served with vanilla gelato) matched the excellence of the meal.\n\nOne minor quibble on service is that our waiter never offered fresh ground pepper or fresh ground parmesan cheese (both of which we saw used at other tables after our need for them was gone).\n\nThe biggest negative point for me was the music. Whatever it was, it was unrecognizable and unpleasant. This is an Italian bistro. Play some nice Italian music or opera or something. Or some really nice dinner jazz. Something that is pleasant to eat a wonderful meal with. This is a bit of a deal-breaker with me, so hopefully they read this and modify their sound mix before my next visit!\n\nSo like I said up front: great food, with room for improvement.", "author": "Jerry P."}

I visited the city by the bay for business this winter and dined at Piazza Pellegrini for lunch.  Off the bat I was captivated by the friendliness of the waiter greeting everyone and trying to get people into the restaurant.  Thankfully my business group chose this place.\nIn keeping with the genuine aspect of the restaurant, of course, our waiter and all the staff was of obvious italian decent.  Our waiter in particular resembled a short, italian version of Robert Downey Jr with the voice of Mario from the classic nintendo games.  They were quick to get our drink orders and put out some bread and oil and vinegar.  I never thought I would ever say this - but that was the best vinegar I have ever had.  It had a sweet taste to it that kept my tastebuds wanting more.  And more.\nNow for the entrees - I ordered the salmon pizza.  I wish it hadnt looked so delicious so I  could have taken a picture.  It was incredible.  The dough had been baked crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - they somehow didnt over bake the salmon either.  It was of perfect consistency.  The taste was something I had never experienced.  This was my first fish pizza - amazing.  If you like salmon I totally recommend this dish.\nThe restaurant had a food delivery while we waited for our check.  It came to us late because our server decided to banter with the italian delivery guy who towered at easily 6'5\".  It was very entertaining to hear them talk.\nAll in all - a classic experience.  I highly recommend this place.  Dont be a chump - visit Piazza Pellegrini and order the salmon pizza.", "author": "Joe E."}

From the decor to the exquisite wait service, we love everything about Pellegrini's, especially the food. The experience is almost like going to an Italian friend's house and eating really good food and being taken care of. Most of the staff speaks Italian, so the accent is an added delight and certainly adds to the ambiance. We have sat outside on warmer days and inside on cooler ones. Both venues are quaint and inviting. The service is top notch regardless of where you are seated. Your water glass will never be empty. \n\nThe food is amazing - rich, saucy, al dente pasta, fresh fish selections with saffron risottto and fresh crisp-tender vegetables. Honestly, I have dreams about the food because it tastes so good. My favorite for lunch is the Italian sausage sandwich. Spicy and rich on a crusty roll. For dinner, I favor the spinach salad with beets and goat cheese, simply dressed with olive oil vinagarette and fresh pepper. This followed by pasta shells in garlic butter sauce served with chunks of broccoli and Italian sausage. My husband likes the giant sea scallops dish with the saffron risotto and veggies and our son enjoys any of the delicious ravioli's on the menu - his favorite is the butternut squash ravioli with fried sage leaves. We usually enjoy wine with our dinner meal and take whatever recommendation the waiter makes for us. Be sure to save room for dessert, even if you share. The apple tart with vanilla gelato goes nicely with their rich, fresh brewed coffee. Our son prefers the extra-generous helping of creme brulee with thick, crunchy caramel coating on top. \n\nDon't let the fancy look fool you into not trying it - yes, the wait staff is dressed nicely and the tables look pretty with all the stem ware and place settings, but it's really a casual place.

The salmon tasted very fresh, though, and the barbecued prawn on the top was a nice touch.

Ordered a salad to start/split which I should have know wouldn't be very good because it had fontina cheese on it.  Whatever.  When it came out it was over-dressed spinach with strange candied walnuts and big big hunks (I mean like little bricks) of cold fontina cheese.  YUCK.\n\nThen my friend ordered the salmon bowtie and I ordered the ricotta gnocchi.  I think she liked hers, I personally am not a fan of smoked salmon in my pasta.  But mine was pretty horrid.  I noticed a few bites into it that it was missing the second ingredient-- sausage.  When I brought it to the attention of a nearby server he said he would let our server know.  5 minutes later our server came by and I pointed out the problem.  He says in his oh-too-cute Italian accent, \"Oh, the kitchen messed it up and they're cooking up some sausage now.\"\n\nUh, whaaaa?  It comes out on a little plate.  This pile of sausage.  I dump it into my pasta and proceed to try and salvage the meal.  Two mins later I bite into a big fat gnocchi and realize, uhoh!  It's Doughy.  Floury.  Thick.  Dense.  Heavy.  Yuck.  Tried a few more of the larger ones, same deal.\n\nI gave Pellegrini's TWO stars only because our server was accomodating and took it off our bill and seemed genuinely sorry that it had happened and offered to substitute something else.  But the Kims of Comedy were waiting.  \n\nKinda left a bad taste in my mouth overall.  Probably will never again revisit.

To use one of my favorite phrases: \"If you like Italian food, you'll like this place, a lot.\" It's a tiny little place, but don't let that fool you. We were walking by on our way somewhere else. I smelled something extraordinary. Being on a time schedule, we didn't have time to stop. I took a picture, so I would remember the name/address. Boy, am I glad I did. Anyplace that smells that good, is worth trying. The restaurant is very nice inside. Not upscale, but quite comfortable and a big open floor plan, for a tiny place. Seating is limited. We sat at a four person table with another party. They moved the tables apart 1\" to designate they were two tables, funny. But at a place like this, who cares? Had the gnocchi, which was to die for. Very light and fluffy with a tangy cream sauce, asparagus, peas and spicy sausage. Good eats. I don't even like asparagus. Also had the sausage and mushroom pizza. Very good, reminds me of thin crust pizza from the east coast. A little touch too much sauce for me, but I hate sauce. The sauce was a little spicy and sweet at the same time. Good stuff. Crust could have been a touch thinner, but most will think it's quite thin. Anyway, everything balanced out on the pizza for an extraordinary meal. I also loved the fresh fococcia bread, which I am sure I misspelled. Service was quick and attentive. They obviously have a lot of regulars here. I'd come here again and again and again. Wouldn't think twice about recommending it. I loved the wood wine cases on display. Gives it a great 'Italian' feeling. Highly recommended.

He had crab ravioli and i had linguini with tomatoes and asked for mushrooms as well since there were so few vegetarian dishes (nothing on the special menu was vegetarian).  Two baskets of bread later the meal came.  About 6 raviolis and a small bowl of linguini - no mushrooms - just linguini, tomatoes, and garlic.  He cleared the plates quickly and left us for a while.  About 10 minutes.  When he finally came back to our empty table he asked if we were interested in dessert.  Hell no!  We got the check and a nonfunctional pen.  I was so ready to leave by now and this was almost comical.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-03-29", "description": "Update: (6/18):\nOk, I have to revise my earlier review. After my last (positive) experience here, I took my friend here who was visiting here from Germany.  It took us 25 minutes to get seated, even though we had reservations. Then we were seated in an awkward configuration where they pulled two tables together, leaving my other friend sitting off by himself.  The part that didn't make sense was that they seated a table of two that came in AFTER us at a table for three in the corner next to the window before creating our awkward table. No explanation was offered for the delay nor any apology. This would have all been forgiven had the food made up for it. Unfortunately this was not the case.  My friend started with the bruchetta, which was odd and flavorless (cold mushrooms and tomatoes with cold blocks of cheese -nothing toasted- on slices of bread).  Both of them then had pizzas, both of which had soggy crust that tasted undercooked and a bit like styrofoam. It is unfathomable how bad both of the pizzas were. My vegetable platter was fine, but the rest was just too bad to warrant a return visit. I'm giving it two stars because the waiter was at least friendly and happily accomodated a special request I made regarding my salad. I'll definitely be heading to Cafe Delucchi instead next time I'm in the neighborhood.\n\nThis place was DELISH! I'm only knocking a star off because the wine we had wasn't so great (we tried 3 different kinds, so we didn't just get unlucky).  The food, however, was fabulous! Being vegetarian, as you know, we can often get the shaft at many restaurants, with most \"chef's choice vegetarian options\" seeming more like an afterthought than anything else. Not so here. Not only did they have numerous veggie pasta options, they also had a full fledged vegetarian platter.  And, even better, you almost feel like you're in Italy when you're eating here..untll you get slapped in the face by that cold SF fog as soon as you walk out the door.", "author": "SL N."}

Not once did the waiter ask how we were doing or if we needed anything at all and the Resotto was crunchy. We complained about it and the employee didn't even care. As we exited there was a friendly older waiter that we both commented to each other that could of made our experience a little better. The tip we left for the waiter reflected the service we got  which is 38 cent and that was being generous.  For good service this is not the place to go to and the food was okay.", "author": "Lisa M."}

I was pleased with the atmosphere and table by the window.  The food and service, however, could be improved upon.  I felt the eggplant and pepper topping for the salmon was far too overpowering and could hardly get past the smell of the Gorgonzola cheese coating the pork chop to enjoy it.  They never once offered to refill our water or wine glasses when they ran low and they only have one bathroom for all the patrons.  I had to leave my date alone for a ridiculous amount of time while I waited in line and saw another woman sitting alone for what seemed to be an eternity waiting on her date to return from the facilities as well.", "author": "Cristina S."}

Strolled up the hill on Columbus looking for a place for dinner and decided to step into this restaurant with no reservation on a busy Saturday night. They were able to seat us immediately. The place was packed with large parties and couples sitting outside under the heat lamps. They have a large specials menu that we ordered from. I had the capellini with fresh crab meat and my dinner mate had the ravioli with fresh pancetta, peas in a cream sauce. Absolutely delicious. The wait staff is very friendly and there to make sure you have a great meal. Even the house table bread with oil and balsamic vinegar was excellent. Ordered a half bottle of merlot that went down very easily and ended our meal with Afogato dessert (gelato with hazelnuts and espresso poured over the top). Piazza Pellegrini certainly did not disappoint and I always love finding new places on a whim. Bellisima !", "author": "Meredith O."}

That space happens to be in front of Pellegrini. It's late at night and half empty, so we're seated immediately by the extremely gracious and warm waiter. I have the salmon and the featured cabernet, my husband has the chicken parmagiana and a Moretti-- we skip the antipasto and dessert, as what we had was quite filling for so late at night. This came to $60, which is a tad pricey to have gone without soup, salad or dessert, as well as having only gone for what was actually the house wine and beer. But the food was pleasant enough (my husband's parmagiana tastier than my salmon, my spinach tastier than his plate's side pasta) and the portions were not at all skimpy. I wouldn't recommend it for a foodie, however, as it's only pretty good not amazing-- and the bread was colder than room temperature, their balsamic vinegar was peculiarly loaded with sugar, when we both would have preferred more olive oil, a drop of balsamic, a dash of pepper and rosemary. At any rate, we weren't tempted to stuff on bread and wine, which is trivial a point enough. We were certainly satisfied with the atmosphere, the excellent service, and the romantic vibe of low chatter, low lights (beautiful light fixtures), and the rain pattering outside. The evening was 5 star largely because of our mood, the service at least 4 and a half if not 5 star, and the food 3 stars as it's A-OK for the price. Again, the portions are generous. Would I go back? I'm not really a creature of habit, it's not crazy wildly delicious, and so I can't really say Yay, I'm a fan. Next time I'll try something else in the plethora of great spots on Columbus. I say it's well worth it when convenient.  I wouldn't wait for a table here, but I'm impatient when hungry so this last comment is no harsh reflection on the establishment.", "author": "Kali D."}

Our waiter met us with a champagne bucket and two glasses and corked our bottle immediately.  The heat lamp was fired up and we were cozy sipping champagne and people watching.  We ordered a grilled veggie and mozzarella stack for an appetizer, it was amazing!  The pesto drizzled on this really added to the flavor.  I have since created my own version at home (thanks for idea!)  For entrees, I had the crab ravioli and it was really the best I have had, ever.   I can tell it was homemade, not frozen or prefab pasta. My husband got the osso-bucco which he enjoyed although I did not sample it as this is not my favorite type of dish. What I really liked about this place is the service, location and the fact that everything was served really HOT- nothing worse than lukewarm Italian food.

And yet they were attentive and cordial, did not laugh in our faces, and invited us to sit at the bar while we waited for a table. Now we're sitting there, the three of us, perusing the menu and constantly changing our opinion on what each one wanted to order. There were too many attractive things on the menu. The sausage must have been great, but I didn't get to try it. The pizza looked amazing, but I didn't get to try that either. Because what I REALLY wanted that pork ragu.  Not a bad choice at all, I must add. My friend's pork chops with polenta apparently were very good also, or maybe she was just very hungry. In any case, the guys serving were very friendly (as nobu points out, no waitresses...), and the place itself is nicely laid out with an open kitchen and big bar in the back. However, there's still something about it that makes it look cheaper than it is. Most places on Columbus have this thing going where they try to lure people into their restaurant. I don't remember a thick layer of makeup at the door, but there was a larger-than-life menu outside, and other attention-grabbing devices. I'm always a bit hesitant about going into a place like that, it makes me feel like I'm walking into a tourist trap and it lowers my expectations for the food. Wait a moment, is that why I liked the food so much?", "author": "Cris L."}

He went away for a while, then came back and said it would be no problem. Since we thought the coupon was a good deal, we ordered extra appetizers and drinks in addition to our main courses. Then, AFTER we were already served our appetizers and our main courses were on the way, the manager comes up to us and says the coupon is INVALID? Even though we explained our waiter told us it was ok, he said in a hushed voice that because it was an \"older coupon\" he would not honor it then left us just like that. No apologies. No compensation whatsoever. Some manager!! He was lucky we are not the type of people to make a scene or walk out without paying because we surely thought about it. We finished our meal, paid the full price, and left. To their only credit, the food was decent, but the manager's attitude completely ruined my appetite.

However, the execution seems a bit off as if the combinations of flavors clash a bit. We had the parpadelle with beef ragu and the dungeness ravioli. The beef ragu was tasty although a tad bit on the salty side. The dish would have done better with a different pasta or perhaps even a rice. The pasta was also a bit overcooked and would have fared better in an al dente fashion in my opinion. The dungeness crab didn't seem too fresh and the green spinach ravioli again didn't seem to pare well with the crab. Overall, I would venture back there to try some of the other menu items and give this place another chance. There isn't really much good italian food in north beach anyway.", "author": "Luke F."}
