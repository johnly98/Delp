They make their pizza slices by cutting out the shape of the slice from dough before putting toppings on which is my favourite way to make slices tbh. Gives me more crust to dip.

By the time I got back to the office and took my first bite, it was still cheesy and delicious! I loved the savory, juiciness of the sausage, the crunch of the bell pepper, and stringy cheese that melted away with each bite. Love it! Now this was a giant slice that could easily be two meals for me so price-point wise, it was really good. \n\nOverall, I know there are mixed reviews about this place, but as for me and my co-workers we are sold and this will probably be our go-to lunch pizza joint.", "author": "Melissa N."}

There slices are big and it's really good.  However they are a little sloppy, but that's normal in a small place like this.  The last few times I got 2 pieces of pizza.  Given they are cut the 2 slides after cooking (being cooked as one double slide, there were toppings spilled onto the other piece.  I don't mind usually as it's my husband and I and have no intolerances.\n\nHowever this evening, my dining companion can't have Garlic, but I LOVE Garlic.  I ordered 2 pieces of pizza and handed over my card.  As they were charging it I mentioned my friends intolerance.  I ordered 2 pieces of pizza for 4.60 and 5.10 = 10.10.  Not a quarter, half, but 2 separate slices.  I was told they WOULD NOT separate them they would only make and cook the 2 slices as 1, together.\n\nI said the person who is eating the other piece can't have garlic and I was told there was nothing you would do to prevent this from happening other than being careful.  BUT given that the pizza is not cut until it leave the oven, the toppings tend to over spill there really was no way to prevent this, except like I asked, before putting on the garlic, separate the slices.  I was told you were too busy...\n \nBasically if I walked in and asked for 1 piece of pizza there would have been no issue.  I would have paid $5.10.  If someone else, my friend who was sitting in the car, had walked in she would have paid $4.60 and been cooked a separate slice. \n\nI hope it was worth it to lose a customer because you couldn't cut the 2 slice into single slices before putting the garlic on, literally an extra 15 seconds to prevent a customer from eating a food they are intolerant to.", "author": "Jennifer D."}

They load so much of the good stuff (i.e. sauce and toppings) that it makes the pizza really heavy and the bottom can get a little soggy. The sogginess by no means makes the pizza less good but if you're a messy eater like I am you'll appreciate the extra sturdiness, otherwise your shirt might meet your toppings.\n\nAlso try the pesto pizzas with pineapple - yum.\n\nHappy eating!", "author": "Kimberly D."}

Other pizza places normally have a whole pizza sitting under a lamp and sell them by slices. Serrano's Pizza bakes each slice to order, fresh out of the oven. I always order a slice of San Franciscan with BBQ chicken as an extra topping, and it's a huge slice every time I order. The crust always stays the perfect texture, not too crispy, not too soft. Outstanding!\n\nBecause each slice is freshly made to order, it takes about 15 mins to get your pizza slice. If you don't have time to wait or don't wanna wait, call in your order over the phone and then go pick it up, since they do take phone orders. Serrano's is a small place, there are only 3 or 4 seats at the counter and the 1 table they have can fit 2 or 3 people.

You will need to be patient because your big little custom slice is going to take a while to bake. Be ready to wait at least 15 minutes for the pizza to be ready and then maybe 5 for it to cool down enough to stuff your face with it. It is worth the wait though. Seriously.

Most recently I had takeout from Goat Hill, and while it was delicious, I can't afford to spend quite that much on pizza all the time.\n\nSo I looked on GrubHub and found Serrano's.  An $8 minimum for free delivery??  Yes, please!  (Most other places it was at least $15, if not $25!)  I ordered a make-your-own deep dish pizza online, and the delivery estimate was about an hour, however, they showed up roughly 30 minutes earlier, YAY!  +1 star for this hungry girl!\n\nAnyway, I open the box, and it's not exactly your typical deep dish, like the Chicago-style.  It's more like regular pizza with HUGE crusts filled with mozzarella.  It's sort of like the stuffed crust pizzas that I think Domino's used to sell, but of course MUCH better quality.  So don't order this deep dish and expect Little Star or Zachary's style.\n\nHowever, being a major carb-lover, I enjoyed every bite of that cheese-filled crust!  Delish.\n\nI had to stop myself before I devoured the entire pizza, it was just amazing.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

Calzone was hot and crispy with flavorful crust. But tomato sauce has overpowering oregano flavor and not much else. It could, however, be easily improved. \n\nThey used Virginia ham in a ham calzone and the ricotta filling had overall sweetish flavor, so it definitely didn't taste like the classic Italian calzone. Plus the sauce was on the inside. I asked for some sauce on the side, and it was cold. \n\nDining surfaces were grimy.

The crust  was doughy and thick, cheese was rubbery, the zucchini was undercooked, garlic undercooked and the spinach looked like prepackaged chopped frozen spinach that was carelessly laid over in chunks. I think the most unattractive part was the chicken.. which looked very processed. You know chicken is processed when it's texture is in comparison of McDonald's chicken nuggets.The good old spongey blended and molded chicken. Yum!

Actually, more accurately, San Francisco is obsessed with adding their own unique twist to the classic recipe, instead creating variations that almost classify as the original but more closely resemble a close cousin. A16, Flour and Water, Ragazza, Delfina Pizzeria, Beretta, Una Pizza Napoletana, Tony's Pizza Napoletana, Zero Zero...the list goes on. It's so prolific that, other than a few, well-known deep-dish pizzerias I began thinking that this was practically the only non-chain type of pizza available in this city.\n\nMy problem is that, frankly, it's just not my favorite style of pizza. Yes, of course a panna and prosciutto pie can be magically delicious, and yes being presented with pizza menus that actually change depending on the season keeps things interesting. Hell, I've even been to Naples and had the real thing! And you know what? I just didn't understand what the craze is all about. I understand that the perfect Neapolitan pizza has a special place in the hearts of many SF inhabitants, but you know what I have to say? F*** Neapolitan pizza.\n\nSometimes I just want a big, thick, overly-mozzarella-cheesed, greasy slice of heaven. So you can imagine my excitement to find my very own neighborhood version of Round Table Pizza just around the corner from my house in the Mission. \n\nSerrano's Pizza serves up just what I like: incomparable slices of hot, chewy, pepperoni-covered pizza large enough to feed a small family. Actually, a large is so large that I was able to feed two people a satisfying lunch and dinner for two days straight. Of course, those two days were so spectacular that I thought, \"Why stop at just two?\" and kept going for a full four days in a row.\n\nAnd no, I'm not ashamed.", "author": "Kelsey E."}

My stomach started talking to me, my brain listened and my nose sniffed out the right spot for my hunger games. I stepped foot into this joint and the smell of cheesy goodness engulfed my nostrils.  My mouth instantly began to salivate such as a dog that has been classically conditioned. I looked up at the menu and pondered for a brief minute, b/c I knew my first choice would have to be a good one since it was my first time. First impressions always stick. So , after many minutes I decided to get a classic pepperoni and a hawaiian slice. \n\nI have had NYC style slices before, and I figured one would not be enough. How wrong I was. To my bewildered amazement, the slices were basically 4. I had anticipated the pizza so much while it cooked, I didn't even bother to leave, and scarfed down the pepperoni slice right there on the spot.  (for a mental image...think of a rabid wolverine) The workers pry thought I was Takuri Kobiyashi...u know, the asian dude that dominated the nathans hotdog eating contest for years. \n\nAfter that sad display of public eating, I ventured out with my other slice...hand in cheese walking merrily down the road.

It's one of the most consistent pizza delivery joints in the area, and I can always count on Serrano's delivery late at night.  The $8 minimum is pretty huge, too.\n\nDecent pizza. Not great in my opinion, but It's good for a cheap pie in San Francisco. Traditional slightly sweet thin crust, fresh pizza sauce, good cheese and generous toppings. It has always been cooked perfectly for me, never too doughy or cold, and never overcooked and burnt. The \"Deep Dish\" is what I've always known as Stuffed Crust, usually when I think deep-dish I think chicago-style, but apparently around here It's thin crust with cheese-filled thick outer crust. \n\nThe pasta is pretty good as well, but some are very oily. The Green Ravioli is my usual - Raviolis filled with ricotta, mozzarella, spinach and herbs - with the pesto sauce. Usually the pesto is good and not too heavy, but rarely it can be very oily and a bit much.\n\nMy order has always gotten to me on time, they usually say 45-60 minutes, which is repeatedly accurate.

Of course this takes a few minutes, but it's worth it to not get an hours old slice of congealed cheese.\n\nWhat's not so great is that the pizza is very average.\n\nToppings are toppings, so it's mainly the quality and relative ratios of crust, sauce, and cheese that differentiate pizzas from one another. Serrano's crust is of the flat-bread type, by this I mean that the dough is either not well yeasted or the yeast is past its expansion stage, so the crust comes out dense and flat. Ideally one would bake the dough at the height of yeast activity such that the expanding CO2 will form a light and springy crust, but in a mom and pop operation this isn't always possible, and I saw that Serrano's raw dough was very flat, suggesting no yeast activity. (Then again, it's always possible that you might order a pizza at exactly the right time and get a much better crust than I got.)\n\nTheir sauce is typical, and fortunately they did not over-cheese, which is a sin of many a pizza joint.\n\nAll in all, since I don't mind flat crusts, a good solid average pizza.", "author": "Rob C."}

With the sour taste of my most recent experience still on my palate, I was honestly praying that Serrano's would deliver something to make me forget all about that horrible pizza place from the other day.\n\nStill craving pizza, I researched Serrano's and decided that their reviews were almost all fairly good and their prices were reasonable. I ordered my typical comfort food (buffalo wings and Hawaiian pizza with a soda). Predicted delivery time was an hour, they made it here before that, so kudos on the timing, especially for a Saturday night. The delivery guy wasn't a douche and didn't act like he was rushed, and he showed up with a smile, which is always nice.\n\nI gave them four stars due to the pizza being a little bit too doughy. It was good though, as were the buffalo wings, which were a generous portion of about 10-12 wings and TWO sides of ranch (in the plastic tubs!). Both items were nice and hot, and the soda nice and cold, which tells me that my food wasn't just sitting there in a window waiting for half an hour before getting shuttled out. \n\nSomeone at this place obviously knows how to run their kitchen. Definitely will be hitting up Serrano's when my pizza craving returns.", "author": "Eyva Kid C."}

The pizzas however were VERY SALTY had THICK BURNT CRUST and topped with the CHEWiest of CHEESES. Nothing flowed together. Every layer was on it's own and they were all struggling. I was seriously trying to break the cheese down in my mouth until my jaws hurt. There was no love put into our pies yo.

At first I attempted to order through the automated system, but with only about 3 minutes to go before they closed, my friend suggested I just call them. He's smert.\n\nAnd so I dialed and received the following sad news, \"Oh sorry, we aren't delivering any more tonight. We are closed.\" \n\nTo which I pleaded, \"But there's still 2 minutes....\"\n\nPause. \"Okay, I'll deliver it to you on my way home :)\"\n\nYaaaay! That alone is worth the 5-stars, but the pizza was super tasty and the bacon salad was yummy too.

The slices are actually made from a triangular pizza dough, is quite huge and is cut in half. They also have a great selection of pizza toppings and the prices are from $3-7 per slice.  I'm a big eater and one slice is almost too much for me to eat, but I do it anyway.\n\nI love white pizza with no sauce, just ricotta and mozzarella cheese (add American bacon for an extra tastiness). This isn't on the menu, but they will make if for me for just $3.50!!! They have no problems with building any type of pizza that you can dream up! Another pizza topping that I want to try is Iinguica (portuguese sausage). I'll update later.\n\nUnfortunately, the pesto pizza is no good because the pesto doesn't have much flavor. Avoid!!!\n\nThey do take-out and the wait is about 10 minutes per slice on a normal night.  They also do full pizzas and it seems like I've seen delivery guys coming and going.

We usually order to pick up. I haven't noticed a particularly long wait when I ordered it to my house when I am too lazy to walk the two blocks. But whatever. I'll wait. The pizza here is really, really good. It's not gourmet. That's fine with me. Gourmet pizza kinda irritates me. Serrano's pizza is the real deal. I never cared at all it was the only pizza place in the hood, and I really dig pizza. Serrano's was enough.\n\nEscape From New York... GAWD! Why are you doing this to me??? I'm not surprised you moved next to ultra-hipster cafe on 22nd street which I also never go to  -  now that whole block is a disaster.\n\nI'm a fairly PC chick, but if some chain has amazing product, hell, I'll patronize it.

They take a piece of dough and smoosh it into a triangle and make you an individual small triangle pizza. You might think that sounds good but YOU\"D BE WRONG!!! Serrano's whole pizzas can't be beaten but those individual slices don't bake right. They push the dough too thin and try to compensate by over cooking it so that your slice won't collapse before you get it too your mouth. The crust comes out hard and gritty. Also instead of cheese covering the slice they put it in little globs, I assume to keep it from running off the pizza during baking since there is no real crust.

My fingers are somewhat slippery at the moment because I'm currently devouring a slice.\r\n\r\nSerrano's is unique because each 'slice' is actually baked from scratch. You tell them exactly what you want and they throw on all the toppings on a slice-shaped piece of dough, and bake it right then and there. It takes a little time -- about 7-10 mins -- but is amazingly fresh and yummy. Even the mixed green salad is crisp and tasty with actual romaine and yummy Italian dressing; no wimpy iceberg lettuce here! \r\n\r\nOne word of caution: make sure to note their closing times. I've been turned away twice for showing up 5 minutes too late... They stop taking orders for their slices about 20-30 mins before they close since they take the baking time into account.

And that choice is called: Serrano's.  And Serrano's is d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s (my g.f. says it best).  The slices are served hot with any type of toppings you can think of and get this novel idea...they serve it up in a box or bag to go.\n\nNo cheesy (pun intended) wax paper and no guy with perm juice dripping on your pepperoni & cheese.  Plus, the slices are large, and by large I mean like personal pan pizza size.  \n\nThere's limited seating and the joint is usually pretty hot, so plan on eating outside or on your walk to one of the watering holes or home.  Yes, I said \"to\" the watering hole...Serrano's is better than late-night drunk food so you don't need to numb your taste buds before eating it.  In fact, I recommend a slice before heading out.  Serrano's uses a magical formula in their crust which soaks up just enough of the alcohol so you don't get belligerent.\n\nSerrano's thank you for making good pizza.  Thank you for serving it in a to-go box or bag.

He had no idea where we live, was unintelligible given poor cell reception, and finally just said that he was not going to deliver the pizza. We called serranos back to inform them & confirm that the credit card would not be charged. The cashier apologized & said they had a new person who was unfamiliar with their delivery area. Hung up. Five mins later, they called back & said that there was a problem - they already made our pizza and tried to insist on delivering it anyway.

The last time I ordered I was told 60 minutes at 7pm- okay that's fine. At 8:30 I called to check and they told me it was on the way. At 8:50, I start to cook and called to cancel. At 8:56 the driver shows up and is arguing that they told us it would be longer than the usual delivery time and that it wasn't that much longer claiming it was really only took an hour & fifty minutes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-13", "description": "There's really only one thing to say about Serrano's:  they make their slices to order.  Let me make that more clear:  if you order a single slice, they will stretch out the uncooked dough, spread sauce, cheese and your topping(s) of choice on the slice, and then cook it in their pizza oven.  \n\nThis makes their slices fresh and a step up from any other pizza by the slice in SF.  The thin(ish) crust is crispy, the cheese is melty, it's a fresh slice of pizza (mmm good).  That's it.  Not re-cooked (ehhh bad).\n\nIt should be elaborated that the aforementioned (fresh) slice is also quite large.  Approaching the size of two slices anywhere else.  And they cut it in half, so it really is a lot like having two slices.  So at 3.35 for a one-topping, you're getting a lot for your money.  Because they are making it fresh, it takes a little while.  Expect to wait 15 minutes for a slice.  \n\nBeyond that, this is an unspectacular pizza.  But it doesn't try to be something it's not.  It's just a good, fresh slice of pizza.  Nothing fancy.  If this turns you on, go get it.  If not, there are several other Mission pizza outlets.  As for me, I value freshness and simplicity, and so when I go to Serrano's, I am always happy.", "author": "Gabriel G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-03-05", "description": "Reviewing perfection seems superfluous and definitely necessitates no more than the bare bones. Serrano's is astoundingly good. They both bake and sell by the slice so rather than getting a withered piece of congealed grease that's been sitting on the counter forever you get a fresh chewy triangle of freshly baked delight. Be warned thin crust fans: this is not the stuff for you. I respect your choices but Serrano's is for the serious pizza eater. Here are my top three: the Meat Special: It is a sinker, so be forewarned. I don't even know what all the meats are on this thing but there are many. I would prefer if it were a bit spicier, but a small quibble. The Americana: given my ardent affection for bacon one might expect this to be my number one, but it comes in at second place. Topped with green onions, fresh tomatoes and crisp pieces of bacon, it is a stunning beacon of near pizza perfection. My top choice at Serrano's, however, is the Pesto Delight. Pesto sauce covered in spinach, sun dried tomatoes, feta and broccoli. Eat the whole thing at once, pick each individual topping off for maximum savoring, consume it however you desire. Be aware that your wait might be longer than you deem acceptable but just remember that it is only because they are cooking you your own personal slice of joy so a bit of patience is more than worth the reward.", "author": "Tory S."}

If ordering with coworkers, we'd get 4 identical slices instead of a pie, the slice being a better deal and somehow always tastier.  \nTonite I ordered a pie delivered, and I have to wonder if they farmed it out:  dry, leathery pizza, bland crust.

HOORAY!!!!!\n     Serrano's is open for my trip to SF this weekend!!!!\n     I consider myself to be a pizza connoisseur - I lived in NYC for 10 years, and have been to the best, most tastiest pizza shops in all of the boroughs.  Imagine my dismay when I landed in San Diego, NYC's antithesis when it comes to pizza (and most other things!)  So I make do with the meager selection of half-decent pizza joints here in SD in exchange for the endless sunny days.  (Though there are a couple of more than halfway decent shops out here - keep tuned for later reviews.....) \n     So - onto Serrano's.  My sister (who lives in the Mission) turned me on to Serrano's during one of my visits.  WOW!!!!!  As everyone else has written, they make each slice fresh for your enjoyment  And it is truly for your enjoyment - delicious sauce!  Awesome topping selection, and they're generous w/them!!!  Yummy cheese!!!  AND IT'S CHEAP!!!  And the slices are huge!!!  And holy eff it's friggin delicious!!!!\nYes, you may have to wait a little while for your order, but I'd rather wait for perfection than have someone reheat a 3 hour old slice.  Yuck.\n     So Serrano's - I love you.  See you this weekend.", "author": "Liz R."}

YUM!", "author": "Jon C."}
