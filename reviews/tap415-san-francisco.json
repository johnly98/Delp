We originally planned on lunch but instead came for happy hour between lunch and dinner and had a few appetizers and snacks along with drinks to celebrate July 4th. With the happy hour pricing, we wound up with delicious food and some good beer and all for an amazing price!\n\nThe large open concept makes it easy to see if the place is busy just as you get there. Seating is pick your own spot, so grab a spot at the bar or a table on the floor, whatever suits you best. Our waiter took our food and drink order and someone else brought it out pretty quickly. We decided on the pretzel bites with fondue, along with the fried cheese curds with chipotle marinara sauce (what can I say, we do love our cheese!) I inquired about the specials for the beer, which I was really pleased with, as they have one of my favourite local breweries on a regularly rotating basis for flavours while my partner ordered a stout from another California brewery. \n\nWhile the service was a bit slow due to the holiday, we still had a great experience, delicious food and wonderful drinks. We found so many things on the menu, we're excited to come back for a full meal or even another hour of appetizers and drinks. This is definitely worth stopping at while you're in the mall, or even making a trip to check out.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

The food is pretty decent here and the ambience is casual and friendly. The staff are quick and welcoming and have knowledge about the food on the menu. The hot dog was served on a pretzel bun with this good cheese/mayo sauce with grilled onions. It was served with house made good chips. The food was excellent but for the price of 13, it is a little expensive. The Cobb salad was on the lighter side and was still very good. They give a big portion of toppings and chicken.  The milkshake was also good. A little thinner than Normal milkshakes so if you like that, this one's for you. They top it off with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.

It's large open restaurant resembling a modern beer garden.  The tables are in twos and fours, but they are close together, which gives a communal feeling.  Decide if you want an outer table with a view of the Dome, an interior table or a seat at the bar, as you seat yourself at Tap415. \n\nThe restaurant was crowded and we found a table in the middle of the dining room. We checked out the drink menu first, which had 11 craft beers on tap, wines, cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks.  Our server, who appears to be the manager, greeted us and took our drinks orders. The food menu is simple with four choices each of burgers, sandwiches, soups and salads, beer bites / appetizers and five sides and two desserts.\n\nOur orders:\nCesar Salad with flat iron steak. Our server asked if we were sharing and he had the order split into two for us, which was nice. Ordered rare, the steak was cooked perfectly and the salad was topped with fresh mozzarella. \n\nForaged Mushroom burger with burrata, arugula, and tomatillo ketchup. The burger was cooked medium as ordered as it was tasty with melted burrata and foraged mushrooms. Nice touch with the use of an onion and sesame seed focaccia bun. \n\nFried Fish sandwich with black garlic aioli, baby spinach, pickled red onions and cucumbers. The sandwich was on toasted sourdough bread. Had a taste of the sandwich and the fish was flaky and well prepared. \n\nService was friendly as our server answered our questions about the menu items and their happy hour.  Service was efficient until it was time for the bill. We waited for a while and had to flag down a worker for it.  While we were there, we did notice two parties walk out due to slow service. A couple never had a server come take their order. We were fortunate our service was in most part very good.  But can see that it could be a hit or miss.", "author": "Al L."}

Although the mall was busy with holiday shoppers, the place was not as busy. We decided to give it a try because the basement food court didn't appeal to us. \n\nWe seated ourselves and the menu was on the table already. We were immediately greeted and waters were brought to us promptly. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n1) Blackened Spice Chicken Sandwich\nThis was really flavorful. It was plated nicely. I think the portion size could be bigger for the price though. \n\n2) Tuna Tartare\nThese came plated on BBQ potato chips. Since I'm not a big fan of raw onions, I was afraid I wouldn't like them as much. However, they didn't bother me at all! I thought the chips and the avocado mousse were a bit too salty. I kind of wished they would serve them on regular tortilla chips. \n\n3) Fish Taco \nI actually wanted the Sweet Shrimp Taco but they ran out of shrimp. The fish was not fried, which in my opinion is the best way to taste if the fish is good or not. It was flaky and flavorful. It also had the same avocado mousse as the tartare. So it was a bit too salty for my taste. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed dining at this place. It's inside a mall so the price is understandably a bit higher than  normal.

First, there was the problem with service: When I sat at the bar, I didn't get acknowledged for more than five minutes, even though I was the only customer at the bar. Then another guy sat a few seats down, and a server saw he was unserved, asked if he'd like to see menus, and gave him some. Did he ask the equally menuless me? No - as he was off like a rocket, so I couldn't grab his attention to ask him for a menu, either. When I finally got service, the guy behind the bar was nice, but maybe a little too much so: He was fond of making suggestions about how he liked to have the food to all three patrons who sat at the bar while I was there. \"Would you like to try such-and-such my way?\" No, dude - just let me eat what I ordered. I don't mean to be harsh, actually - he was a nice guy, but after three people in a row, this began to seem less like friendliness and more like a bad habit. I could be more sanguine about the place if the food was good, but... it wasn't great. I had the fried chicken sandwich, which was decidedly underwhelming. The chicken itself was extremely thin and overpowered by the bacon and especially the pickled jalape\u00f1os (which I knew I should've asked to have removed). In the end, it tasted of so many things that it didn't taste of anything at all. The fries, which cost extra to add on instead of potato chips, were little wedges with no additional seasoning, and they had the hard texture, dark color, and oiliness that indicated they were 1) overcooked, 2) last night's fries that had been recooked, or 3) both. Either way, they weren't good. I liked my beer, at least, and I guess watching a shoplifter argue with mall security counts as entertainment, which is good since the dark, empty, cavernous room feels downright sepulchral on a weekday lunch.\n\nIf (theoretically, since I live in L.A.)

We took the elevator up and it was very easy to find, in a quiet area of the Westfield Mall. \n\nWe were able to seat ourselves pretty easily since it was a Wednesday night and we arrived just as happy hour was ending. We were immediately greeted by the busboy and he took away a chair so we could park our stroller under the table. He also gave us a children's menu for our at 3YO. \n\nOur waiter arrived and asked if we were ready to order (I was not, and I regret that! ) and we each ordered a beer and got a chocolate shake for our son. We also ordered the pretzel bites as an appetizer. They were served right away by a manager (I was a little put off that he quickly hurried away and I didn't even have a chance to ask for mustard) and our drinks arrived shortly thereafter. \n\nOur waiter was pretty busy and it was nearly impossible to get his attention to place our orders for our meals. It appeared that he was covering most of the restaurant. I went with the Dungeness Crab Roll, my fianc\u00e9 ordered the Pulled Pork \"Reuben,\" and we ordered the hot dog for our son. Again, our food arrived quickly and was served by the manager. Again, we had to flag down our waiter so my fianc\u00e9 could order another beer. I actually had to ask the manager for a glass of water when he brought the beer (it was not offered even though we were just starting our entrees and I was just about done with my beer! ). \n\nThe Dungeness Crab Roll's bun was softer than I expected. The sandwich was not dressed but it was served with clarified butter. On the plus side, dipping the bread into the butter was delicious! For $24, I would have expected much more crab, and actual chunks of crab meat rather than just shredded white crab meat! The sandwich was priced higher than most lobster rolls in the Bay Area and didn't even have enough crab meat to cover the length of the bread. Oh yeah, the sandwich was actually $26 since we were charged an additional $2 for fries instead of chips. My fianc\u00e9's Reuben had a LOT of cheese on it. He said it was just \"ok\" and he ended up skipping the top bun and just used a knife and fork to eat it. He ended up getting really bad heartburn from it, too. \n\nI don't quite know how other reviewers said TAP415 wasn't pricey. Our bill was $100 and not worth it at all. Next time, we will just stick with the Nordstrom bistro, which has great food and excellent customer service.", "author": "Melanie E."}

Here's a play by play of what happened today. \n\nI walk in the restaurant and seat myself, As I'm a taking off my sweater right before I sit down on my chair I notice the server starring at me as if he really didn't want to serve me or even be there! right off the bat I get a weird vibe.... Anyways the server asks if I wanted anything to drink so I asked him for \"a glass of water with lemon\" he replies with a \"So you want lemon in your water?\" with an attitude as if I had asked him for something out of the ordinary. Anyways he comes back with the water and I had told him that i was ready to order he replies with a \"what can i get you today?\" [Now pause for a second there, I've been here about 7-10 different times and I've always, and i mean ALWAYS asked for a cheeseburger.] I replied with a \"May i just get a regular cheeseburger with no onions or pickle?\"......Again the reaction on this guys face like as if i had asked to chop off his fingers and put them on my burger. The server then leaves. As I'm sitting down waiting for my food I notice that all eyes are on me literally!!!! Every where my head turned there was an employee staring at me and thats when I noticed that the staff probably thought I was going to leave without paying my bill. I hadn't even receive my burger yet. I had called my friend who was in the mall and asked him if he could come upstairs to the restaurant. I finally receive my burger which did not take long at all which was good. as I'm eating my friend finally shows up after sitting with me for about 5 minutes he whispers \"Is it just me or is everyone here sort of monitoring us?\" at that very moment he made everything that i was feeling true. So at that moment I asked for my check. The server comes back with my check and right away i gave him my card so he could pay me out. This is where my heart drops... server is walking back to the table with my card and the check in hand, turns to his fellow co worker and says \"We are all good\" while lifting the checkbook. He drops off my check and doesn't even say a word. I grabbed my card, signed my name and got up. One of the staff must've not got the memo that \"We are all good\"  so as I'm starting to walk she rushed from the doorway of the kitchen and asked if were all ready and set for the bill. She then realized that I did pay and gave me a \"Have a good day\". Never will I comeback to this establishment. I myself am a server (3+years) and understand that there are people sometimes who look fishy or suspicious but come on you guys at least if you were going to keep an eye on me lets at least keep it discreet, among the staff, Don't project it on the floor. It makes us honest customers feel terrible. You guys managed to make me feel as if I did something wrong. Sucks being blatantly discriminated against. I do apoligize for not tipping my server but from server to another you did not deserve it.", "author": "Luis M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-08", "description": "TAP415 you are so sexy and cool, just why oh why can't your food match the ambiance that you put forth on the fourth level at the Westfield SF Centre. Don't get me wrong, I love that TAP415 is even here and thriving in the tourist mecca that is \"under the dome\" in what was once Cocola Bakery. In fact, since opening ten years ago, nothing on the fourth floor of the Westfield Centre is there anymore. What a changing business landscape we truly live in.\n\nThis was my first time to TAP415, as it has been open for over three years. I came with friends during the holiday season after we hung out at the nearby United VIP Lounge in the old Lark Creek Steak restaurant. (Another moon for the misbegotten) A simple walk across the mall and we were easily able to seat ourselves at a table in the open table area. TV's line the upper walls on the mall exterior side and the bar and the open kitchen line the interior side with all the tables from four tops to two tops with the menus right on them right in the center of the restaurant. It's like you're already ready to be served and fed in one sitting! \n\nThe menu isn't too deep at TAP415 nor should it be. A lot of the same burgers, sandwiches, soups, salads and small bar bites. On the other side of the menu they highlighted their cocktails on their beer and wine menu. On top to not a single person in my party never having been here before, we came to enjoy their Happy Hour menu. With a handful of decently priced bites and drinks, I ordered the Daily Special Cocktail which was a ginger and pear infused gin cocktail. My dining mates got the Happy Tap Beer and the Happy Tap Wine for a very nice 5 & 6 dollars respectively. To eat while sipped, we went with the Tuna Tartare with Ahi Tuna on top of four Barbecue Potato Chips. (Which I think were actually regular potato chips but that's griping) The drinks were great but the appetizer even though at a very affordable $4.15 was lacking in kick and quite frankly decent flavor, not to mention there wasn't food to nosh on especially for Happy Hour. \n\nWhen it came to select our main dishes everyone seemed to crave their burgers from their Tap Burger with tempura bacon, cheddar, bacon, lettuce, pickled red onion and togorashi remoulade and the Smoked Barbecue Burger with Pt. Reyes blue cheese and crispy onions. Both burgers came with chips, but if you wanted fries it was additional two dollars on top of the 14 dollar price tag which seemed excessive for a dish that should always have fries accompanying it. I however was intrigued by the Pulled Pork \"Reuben\" with sauerkraut, Swiss Cheese, Russian dressing served on a caraway roll. This dish's price point was 15 dollars and again it cost an extra 2 dollars for the fries, which were shoe string fries rather than steak fries. I can't speak about the burgers which my friends seemed to love, but my \"Reuben\" was a wee bit disappointing as it dry and lacking a lot of flavor which made me sad because I am always down for both a pulled pork sandwich and pastrami Reuben but when combined here it was simply lackluster. (Although it was presented really well as it come on clean wooden plank).\n\nThe good news is there is a lot of potential at TAP415. I loved my light cocktail of the day and at 7 dollars it was very affordable. Of what I had of the food, nothing really stood out, which might mean I just didn't order correctly. Some of the other dishes on the menu sounded great but who knows how they tasted. The price points at TAP415 are not the lowest which makes sense since it's located in the mall in the center of San Francisco's biggest tourist mecca. The service is really solid and the bar/ cocktail program seems really fun. I'm willing to give it a second chance since as of late 2016 there are only two dining options \"Under the Dome\" at Westfield. Hopefully in the new year more dining options arrive in this beautiful shopping center that is so desperately in need of them.", "author": "Jason F."}

My fiance and I had some time to kill before seeing a movie recently so we decided to grab some drinks at Tap415.\n\nTap 415 has an open seating area, not sure if it was because of the odd time of the day, but just a 'seat yourself' sign out front.  It was pretty empty so we grabbed two seats at the bar for some drinks. There is a nice selection of craft beer (and wine!) on tap.  My fiance chose the rotating porter and I went for a cocktail - the 'El Matador' which has tequila, lime, cucumber and Serrano pepper.  The drink was good, mostly just a margarita with cucumber, didn't taste the pepper too much, but oh, well. \n\nThe only gripe I have with this place was the bartender.  He was a bit standoff-ish, seemed absolutely miserable and has this incredibly gross and greasy hair that he kept running his fingers through while making drinks.  I am a huge clean freak and when it comes to dining out I usually expect some form of hygiene from the service staff.  I've spent my fair share of time behind the bar and was always taught never to touch your hair or even rub your hands on your face without washing in between.

A whole different atmosphere from the food hall downstairs in the basement (where less expensive fare can be found).\n\nTap415 is casual, comfortable and quite open plan with rows of high tables and stool type seating.  I feels like a beer hall (tap!).\n\nI came mid afternoon,  around 2:30, and the receptionist was gracious enough to offer a table or the bar as I was alone.  I chose the table, usually my preferred seating although sometimes on rare occasions the counter/bar can be fun.\n\nThe menu is basically burgers, sandwiches, salads but all billed as wholesome and healthy fare, which I do believe is the case; including using high quality breads.\nI opted for a smoked portobello mushroom sandwich, with a side of salad and vinaigrette dressing.  The salad is a $2. substitution from chips (not so healthy standard side offering).\n\nFor a drink I got a mocktail, called a Root and Cuke which was utterly refreshing and delicious.  Try it, if you like the taste of cucumber,  lime and ginger beer. \n\nMy sandwich was exceptional,  delicious, well prepared, and big enough. The bread roll was terrific.  And the side salad rocked high grades. How many times have you seen radish used in a side salad? Almost never, but this one did...that alone pleased me so much it gained an extra star.  \n\nMost of all the service was outstanding.  Friendly,  courteous, attentive.   Someone was always sure to accommodate and be sure you had what you needed.  And these folks work darn hard.  Since I was alone I could watch the staff, and it was amazingly efficient (from my vantage point) and moving steadily.  Bravo!  \nWhen I sat down they told me the kitchen was backing up some, which was nice to know, but my food came in good time without delay; as did the diners around me.\n\nOk, for mall food this place gets high energy stars for quality and service.\nUnless you're an old lady (sorry old ladies)  or old man (sorry too) who can't take sitting on a stool skip the Nordstrom cafe and come here.\nI'm a \"Boomer\" and felt like a \"Millennial\" here.", "author": "Tom B."}

Nice soft bun made the burger easy to bite through and you get this nice texture from the crispy crunch of the tempura bacon. The only thing. It was just soooo salty. You'd definitely need a few beers to wash it down. The beef patty was on the skinny side, reminded me of the patty at in-n-out, just super thin and with everything going on the beef flavor got lost.

I know that goes against everything your mama said, but yo mama so fat she sat on an iPhone and turned it into an iPad. Yo mama so fat she has two watches one for each time zone she's in. Yo mama so fat she blocks the WiFi signal. Oh dear, I could just go on, but this is about my recent experience at TAP415 when Jamie W. and I decided to stop by after we took in an early afternoon showing of \"Grandma\" at the Century Theaters. We were feeling rather peckish since we didn't have a bucket of popcorn during the movie, so I thought it wouldn't hurt to have some bar bites to hold us over until dinner.\n\nI've passed by this expansive space before, usually when it's crowded with the youth of America or the tourists of the Far East, so it was with surprising ease that we sidled up to a high-top table for two. There's a small Happy Hour menu from 3-6PM, so that's where we perused. We started with a couple of $7 John Daly Cocktails, which if you didn't know, are Arnold Palmers with vodka (photo: http://bit.ly/1NUfcba). While they were undeniably refreshing, we were missing the kick we were hoping to feel when they went down our respective gullets. We decided to share three dishes, the first being the small $6 Cezar Kale Salad, which mixed baby kale with Parmesan, parsley and lemon gremolata (photo: http://bit.ly/1WqiAxx).\n\nIt was a light salad suitable for a tea party at your Aunt Rose's condo. We segued into the $4.15 Cornmeal Battered Onion Rings with Blue Cheese Sauce, which sounded like a good deal until we saw just the four rings on the plate (photo: http://bit.ly/1VgyE7T). Tasty though as we did our best to stretch them out. The last of our order was the same-priced Bacon Wrapped Little Dogs with Beer Mustard (photo: http://bit.ly/1MR5gk9). Good also but barely four bites to be had. The Lilliputian portions presumably reflect what the owners felt were commensurate with a Happy Hour appetite, but we felt they should have sprung for more vodka in order to make the small plates look larger than they were. And yes, you do feel like you're in the middle of a shopping mall.\n\nFOOD/DRINKS - 3 stars...Happy Hour portions didn't satisfy as much as I had hoped, cocktails need more kick\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...clean, open space but you never forget you're in a mall\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...OK, little more than that\nTOTAL - 3 stars...acceptable enough as a respite, not sure whether I'm motivated enough to come back for a full meal", "author": "Ed U."}

The restaurant is one of the highest floors in the shopping mall, right next to an upscale Chinese restaurant, movie theater, and spa. \n\nWhen you walk in, the entire restaurant is open seating. All of the tables are communal, high top tables. Very casual & clean setting. They serve happy hour from 3-6 PM, offering some drink & food options. Drinks were good. Nothing out of the ordinary. As far as the food goes:\n\nPrezel Bites: Very good and the pretzel bites were poofy and perfectly salted. Also came with a yummy cheese fondue dipping sauce.\nSteak Fries: Good portion size for happy hour and came with ketchup and a green chili sauce for dipping.\nGuacamole: Guac was good but needs more spice. I think the tortilla chips were fresh which we liked.\nMini Hot Dog: I think it's $4 for one mini hot dog which was a bit of a rip off in my opinion because you'll only get 3 bites out of it (2 bites if you're a guy). This was very small.\nTuna Tartare: Sad to say this is the worst tuna tartare I've ever had. If you are going to be an American tap room, stick to what you are good at, such as burgers, wings, etc. This tuna tartare was, interesting. It included 4 bites. Each was a spoonful of dry tuna tartare, mixed with red grapes & olives, which was on top of a potato chip. Honestly, it did not taste good, at all. It was dry and the combination of ingredients was strange.\n\nI liked the location because it was inside the mall. And our server was very friendly and attentive. As far as the food goes....it wasn't anything memorable. If I come back, it might just be for drinks and pretzel bites.", "author": "Chisholm T."}

We usually go to the food court and have a great experience but never have tried the upstairs restaurants so happy hour at Tap415 was going to happen! \n\nSuper nice place. The black white and red colors show a super hip contrast and makes the place look modern. I love the light fixtures around the place, offers a ton of light! There's a super clean bar area with tons of glasses to ensure the crowds. Our server at the bar was alright. They were going through a shift change and seemed to focus more on that. \n\nFor HH, we kept it simple and went with the BBQ chips for $1 and bacon wrapped little dogs with beer mustard for $4.15. The chips were dusted with a BBQ flavoring and was your average BBQ chips, worth the $1 price. The dogs were not. (4) very little dogs over a bed of mustard, the bacon was so dried out and so were the dogs. Kind of a let down. Because of that, we decided not to continue with dinner. \n\nI feel bad giving a rating like this but I'll certainly give them another chance to change my mind.

Second time- great service at the bar from a woman. Third time, not at the bar- I have been sitting here for over 20 minutes waiting to order something else, ended up getting another drink at the bar because I had no one to order from. Maybe it is if you sit on the side table? That is where I am, as a single diner...perhaps a forgotten corner. I don't know, I don't think that should not be an issue as it is behind the host station. I ended up having to tip more because I gave the server 10% and slipped the busboy who helped out a $5.\n\nFood is OK, nothing too crazy, but they do have a great vegan truffle corn soup and I do fancy how they serve their tartar with potato chips- that was super rando but delicious. \n\nIt was a shock to get my bill when I stayed for a but at the bar m y second time. I ordered a cup of soup, a tuna tartar app and a 2 WELL martinis which racked up a bill to over $50... for one person. They charge $12 for their well Smirinoff martinis which is about the price for a fifth of Smirinoff vodka at the store. So \"splurge\" a couple dollars more (you are already paying oner $10 for a well drink) and don't bother with well here. \n\nThe woman bartender is my favorite place about TAP415, though that chip/ahi combo comes in for a close second.

It's a great spot for meeting with friends and having some pretty good gastropub fare.\n\nI've only been here one time for food service, so I've only had a short sampling of their menu.  I've had their Tap Burger and ordered their Mac n Cheese for my side dish.\n\nTap Burger  --  http://bit.ly/1GmiwXF\nTempura Bacon, Cheddar, Lettuce, Onion, Togarashi Remoulade\nThe Tap Burger wasn't too bad but it's not one that I'd come back again and again for.  The Tempura Bacon does give it an interesting twist but in the end it gets lost with the all the veggies.   Overall it tasted just like regular burger, which isn't a bad thing though.  One caveat for me was that it doesn't come with fries, but it does come with a nice assortment of pickled veggies.\n\nAged Cheddar Mac 'n Cheese --  http://bit.ly/1Kzke9H\nInstead of ordering fries to compliment the Tap Burger, I decided on the getting the Aged Cheddar Mac 'n Cheese.  This was good too, a little dry, but a solid side dish..  The cheddar cheese was still intact and wasn't absorbed into the macaroni.\n\nService here has been okay for the most part.  I came here once with a few friends for drinks and apps and the server was nice and attentive.  The other time I came for food, my server got everything I needed but she didn't seem that enthusiastic.  It was late in the day though and she was probably fatigued.\n\nI'd recommend TAP415 for a nice bite to eat if you're shopping inside the shopping center.  It's definitely one of the more affordable options from the Restaurant Collection.  I haven't been there during peak hours or games, but I'm betting that it does get crowded on those occasions, especially since they have a dedicated room for watching games.

I wish I got her name but she's blonde with the red bandana. Shout out to her for being awesome!!! Their computers were down and we could tell she was pretty flustered with t all but she handled it and was still super accommodating and friendly. \n\nI wouldn't mind coming back for their happy hour to grab lunch. It's really chill environment and a nice option other than the food court food.", "author": "Melissa M."}

The daily happy hour offers a dollar off on drafts and select apps. After sitting ourselves, we waited a while before a waitress came and introduced herself and took our request for waters.\n\nOnce our waters were served, we ordered chips, onion rings and 2 shrimp tacos, all of which were happy hour items. Our waitress seemed a little surprised that that's all we were ordering, but we were just here to kill some time and maybe find a new place to dine before a movie upstairs. Appetizers didn't take too long to come out with the BBQ chips coming out first, followed by the onion rings and shrimp tacos. \n\nHowever, after our waitress took our order, she never came back and checked in with us, but did in fact check in with surrounding tables. At one point, we began asking various food runners for more water and condiments. Although the BBQ chips and onion rings were tasty; the shrimp tacos not so much, we were left with a bad taste due to the bad service. Had we committed to cocktails or beers or a burger and fries, would we of gotten better service?\n\nOur experience wasn't great, but the concept of TAP415 and the food we tried weren't bad. I did like the open atmosphere of TAP415 and the fact that it can be a place you can get a drink at Westfield or a sit down experience with a friend or co-worker. I'm open to giving TAP415 another try (not anytime soon) and hoping my first experience was a fluke.\n\nAmbiance/Decor: 3/5\nFood: 3/5 \nService: 1/5\nPrice: $$\nOverall: 2/5\n\nPros:\n+ Daily Happy Hour program (3-6 pm daily)\n+ Tasty onion rings\n+ Rotating local beers \n\nCons:\n- Pricey burgers and toppings\n- Shrimp tacos a little small and not very flavorful\n- Service can vary", "author": "Alexander E."}

Great ambiance and atmosphere, such a great dining experience!!!!\n\nTo start off, the manager Nathan was plain awesome. Me and my boyfriend ordered their ribs (which weren't on the menu because it was a special) to go. As me and my boyfriend were enjoying our shots of alcohol and beer, the manager comes over to us and tells us that he was going to pack the ribs to go unheated, because they were already fully cooked and that we just had to hear them up; if they heated them up there and we got home later on and heated them up again then they would be way too dry. He gAve us the run down on the ribs and what would make them taste better at home without making them dry. He also stayed and chatted with us for about 10 minutes about other things, which me and my boyfriend really liked! The manager Nathan definitely made our first experience here very impressive. \n\nThe food was also awesome! The ribs were really tender and chewy, they gave us an order of fries on the house, and we enjoyed our meal with some alcohol, which always makes things that much better :) \n\nI would definitely recommend this establish to anyone who is in the mall, hungry, and wants to enjoy some good food and alcohol for some fueling energy to go shopping afterwards lol.

We sat ourselves and within a few minutes, Cameron reappeared to take our drink order. He was also great at helping us make a beer selection. Cameron returned with our drinks and proceeded to take our order.  We reviewed the menu and decided on a couple of things. He made a few suggestions because we were undecided on a few of the menu items. His suggestions were spot on - particularly the Fried Jack Cheese Curds. They were perfectly fried and so tasty that we didn't even need the accompanying dipping sauce. We also shared the Flat Iron Steak Frites; and the temperature of the meat and crispiness of the steak fries were perfect. Cameron checked in on our table a few times without being intrusive. Almost nearing the end of our meal, Alex the manager, also checked in on us. Food and service had been great so far. We had room for one more thing so Alex suggested that we had to try their namesake burger.

I saw a few burgers and thought \"Looks good\" so I gave up my search for Chipotle and had dinner here.\n\nIt's a good mix of sports bar/casual spot. You seat yourself and then a waiter comes over.  I went with the Double Bacon Burger.  I wanted to substitute the BBQ chips for onion rings but they don't allow that.  If I wanted onion rings I had to order a regular side of them. So I stuck with the chips. The burger was decent. Had a \"smokiness\" to it that initially I liked but towards the end of the meal, became a bit much. The bacon was more like diced pork belly. It wasn't bad but the \"cubed\" bacon was a bit different. I liked how they serve the burgers on wood planks though. Service was a little lacking. I would have appreciated my waiter checking in on me at least once during the meal and refilling my soda. TAP415 is better than average mall restaurant.", "author": "Steve S."}

Located on the top floor of the Westfield Center and opened on Tuesday, November 11th, this modern beer open space- garden like tap room was met by accident.  I was driven by the tv screens and remembered that my friend Alan had posted his meal from here today. Figured that it was either here or In and Out on the way home. Decided to check out what type of grinds this place offered. Walk in and noticed a small sign that says to seat yourself, so we did. \n\nMenu already on the tables and everything looked creative and interesting, the execution on the other hand was a bit lacking. The winner of everything that was selected this evening outside of our drinks was the pastrami sandwich. The pastrami sandwich was beautifully plated on a wooden chopping board and easily can share for four.  Bread was the perfect texture and each bite was full of flavor.\n\nOn the other items that were tried for the night: The sauce for the pretzels (some were soft others were hard) were mild and and a bit runny but was easily made up for the shrimp corn dog sauce which offered an extra bite and texture that complimented the bread. \n\nThe Gulf prawn corn dog was a bit underwhelming, it would have more of a creative approach if they minced up the shrimp and had a slightly thicker batter. Also, the price for the appetizer it would have been better to just order two burgers. Lastly, I love and almost always look forward to a good house charcuterie - the one that was offered here was okay but the toast that came with it did not compliment it well. The dry toast looked like cut up wedges of sliced bread coming from a toaster. I hope they do change the type of bread being offered with the platter.\n\nAmbience was awesome (love the surrounding tvs), team was attentive on the first Saturday evening from opening. Mocktails were well executed and beer on tap is awesome! I may give this place another go in the future with more beers, burgers and dessert. \n\nSo if you happen to be shopping at Nordstrom's and need to take a break, this place would be just a few steps away.\n\nNote: I think price for beverages are reasonable but some of the appetizers are priced more than it should be.", "author": "Jess N."}

Apparently, a lot of people had a similar idea, as the place was packed. After waiting for about 15 minutes, we were seated in the dining room.\n\nSide note: \nWhen we arrived, I guess we must have come through the back entrance and noticed a sign that said \"Please seat yourself.\" After seating ourselves we were asked to go and wait at the front as they said the sign was there in error. After heading to the front, we were seated right away by the wait staff at the kiosk, only to be told that we had to get up once again and wait for a table (after we had just been told we could be seated). I don't know why the staff was so confused, but this didn't start us off on the right foot for our dining experience.\n\nAnyways, we ordered several things, mostly from the happy hour menu:\n\nDrinks\nBourbon mule (4 stars): I started off with this drink and really enjoyed it--nice ginger flavor and easy on the palette.\n\nArnold Palmer with vodka (3 stars): Though this was easy to drink, I was a little less impressed with the flavor and felt like it was light on alcohol.\n\nFood\nBBQ Chips (4 stars): These was a steal for $1 and have a nice, intense BBQ flavor to them that borders on spicy.\n\nPork Slider (3 stars): I had high hopes for the pork sliders. I don't know if it is because I was expecting pulled pork, but these were pretty small and very underwhelming.\n\nTuna tartare (3 stars): This dish has some potential as the flavor of the tartare is good. However, the small portions and having it served over a BBQ chip really takes away from the flavor of the tuna, which is disappointing.\n\nShrimp taco (3 stars): Again this dish has some potential, but the flavors were really overpowered by the guacamole and the shrimp was lost in the shuffle. However, unlike some of the other dishes, this was a decent size for the price.\n\nRegular burger (3 stars): This was the sole dish we ordered off of the regular menu. This was a decent size, but I found myself craving a little more seasoning and flavor in the meat.\n\nOverall, we found this place after looking for a good happy hour spot near Union Square. Needless to say, I think they were a bit overwhelmed on the day that we visited and their service and food suffered. In addition, though on paper it seems like they have some good value with their happy hour menu, most of the portions are minuscule and not even worth the cheaper price--as evidenced by other patrons ordering dishes off the regular menu that were also featured on the happy hour menu.\n\nJust a quick word of advice: If you are going to have a happy hour menu, make it worthwhile. Don't just knock down prices and then cut down portion sizes--sadly, most dishes weren't even worth the happy hour pricing in my opinion.", "author": "Ryan R."}

The portions were much bigger than we expected and this ended up being our dinner instead of a \"snack\" before dinner!\nAn added bonus is that they have televisions along pretty much every wall and they showed sports games.

It did not disappoint.  I love a good burger, and this was legitimately one of the best burgers I've ever had.  It turns out that putting fried tempura bacon on a perfectly cooked burger is delicious - who knew?* I really didn't check out the rest of the menu, as the only thing I came here for was the Tap Burger, so I can't really comment on the other offerings. But if they're anything like the Tap Burger, I think I've found my new go-to lunch splurge near work.  Note: they also have a nice selection of beers on tap, so this would be an excellent happy hour spot.   \n\n*Yes, it may seem obvious that this would be delicious, but trust me, it's even more delicious than you might think.  The secret here, I think, is an understated sweetness in the tempura - they must include some sugar in the batter or they add it into the curing blend for the bacon - which really makes everything pop that much more.  So, so good.", "author": "Andrew E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-20", "description": "I wasn't expecting much of TAP 415 due to the slew of mixed reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised.  This is from the owners of 25 Lusk, and although I did enjoy my dinner/happy hour there years ago, I didn't think it was anything extraordinary.  TAP serves standard bar grub such as burgers, sandwiches, sausages, bar appetizers and some heartier plates such as schnitzel and porchetta.  And of course being a mod style bar/tavern, etc. they have an attractive drink menu for the beer enthusiast (including local brews), wines, and cocktails.  Next time I'm going to order their white sangria!   \n\nWe arrived around 12ish the other Saturday and seated ourselves without any trouble.  The space is quite large and there weren't too many tables occupied.  A lot of the tables seem like they're for larger groups though, but since they weren't busy, we chose a 6 seater by the mall walkway.  \n\nThey seem to change up a few things on their menu from time to time.  I asked about the shrimp corndogs because it sounded so interesting, but unfortunately they were taken off and not available, no secret menu ordering here!  I went with the French Dip and he went with the Tap Burger.  Both came with some housemade bbq chips.  We also were intrigued by the buttermilk biscuits with pork butter, so we ordered that as a starter.  The buttermilk biscuits were golden brown and moist and buttery.  There were three of them and the pork butter was not too porky but a great idea!  The pepper jelly wasn't spicy like I thought it would be and the two mixed on the biscuit was delectable!  Genius!  But even more genius, was the tempura bacon in his burger!  The burger had a slight asian slant to it, with the tempura bacon and torigashi remoulade.  Came with cheese and the standard toppings too.  It was cooked perfectly medium and juicy and messy.  That tempura bacon we both loved..but it's bacon + fried goodness, how can you hate on that?  My french dip was one of the better if not best I've had.  The beef was so moist that I didn't even need the au ju.  The cheese was all melted and gooey and the carmelized onions hit the spot too.  I liked how the bbq chips were still \"normal\" colored potato chips but had some bbq spice flavor.  Fresh homemade chips are always great, albeit they were a little greasy.  Wish they gave a little more of those chips though.\n\nWaitstaff was friendly and the place has a good vibe.  I couldn't help but think it sort of reminded me of the ESPN restaurant that used to be in Vegas, but not over the top with TVs and cheesiness like ESPN was.  Happy Hour is from 3-6.  It's a teeny bit pricey, but it's expected because it is Westfield in downtown after all.  We'd come back for a drink and some lunch when the mood strikes.  Yay for another solid restaurant in Westfield.", "author": "Cat C."}

It had to be the worst burger and service experience in my 40 years.\n\nOur first follies were when both of our meals came out incorrectly.  Hers had cheese (requested no cheese), and mine was missing the onion rings and sauce.  The service and management team were either on break or hiding because it took 16 minutes to get this partially corrected..  Only partially because they didn't correct our kid's meal.  I guess they don't get that when a kid says no cheese they mean it.\n\nI decided to 86 the kids burger after realizing they hadn't made another one and share my medium well burger.  I give one star because the burger had a good flavor, but then tragedy happened.  I looked down at my lettuce and wooden board to see fresh blood (not from my tanned meat).  My server had no explanation and brought me my bill ($27.00 for a burger, onion rings, lemonade and sparkling water).  I asked to speak to a manger, paid the bill and waited...  I saw the manger in his plaid hipster shirt hanging at the furthest point from our table.\n\nAs I was leaving, I asked the women upfront for the owners contact information.  As a fellow restaurant owner, I would want to know the \"mishappenings\" of my team.  Kat, is the General Manager, and her explanation of blood was that they line up all the blocks and it was from a rare burger..  Not a good explanation of lack of details.  \n\nHer resolution for me- \"send me an email, and I'll buy your next burger\".  First, I'm not confident that this place will be open next time I'm at Westfield.  Second, you didn't fix my horrible experience..  Never again.", "author": "k s."}

The manager Nathan stopped by to ask how things tasted etc - I was straight forward - cheese dip with the pretzel bites needs to be thicker and give me MORE & this sandwich was a bit salty.  He was super receptive and the next time we were in remembered us and had us check out the updated version of the pretzel bites. Pretty Cool - \n\nWe've been back a bunch of times since - the service has been stellar every time but once and  - then it wasn't bad.  The burger is so very good. They'll even cook it a real medium rare - which is AWESOME-sauce. The GRILLED ALBACORE TUNA is my lighter meal go-to. The octopus salad - is a bit of both for me - the octopus and grapefruit were spectacular - I've never had octopus so tender - but the beans not my favorite. I don't think that's the dishes fault, I'm just not generally a huge bean person even though I keep trying. The meat board - large and in charge and perfect for sharing - same with the CHARCUTERIE AND CHEESE. The beer soup to the hummus - to burgers and salad - it's all tasty.   \n\nWe also showed up randomly the other night - with 11 people after a good bye work happy hour - that was very happy (think tequila shots) and no food.  They re-opened up the back section for us and Kathy took super duper care of us and was kind and patient with a couple of drunk-ish peeps, even organizing the bill so we could pay in whatever group formations we wanted/needed without us even needing to ask.   Props to Greg and Tiara who seem to end up waiting on us often - and are always on point. \n\nMy only complaint - is I think they could do a better job showcasing how much effort they put into sourcing their food/ingredients. I thought the prices skewed a little high until I realized most ingredients are pretty darn local & menu items are made in-house.  No jugs of dressings in this joint.", "author": "Laura M."}

It took him awhile to come around to take our orders, but not long to give us our beers. Hmm.. Here's where it gets shitty. It took LITERALLY 1 HOUR, maybe even a little longer for us to get our burgers. We got the side of fries we order shortly after the beers, so I assumed that the burgers were next. WRONG! Other parties who arrived after us got there meal first, some even finished before us and left. Mind you, I constantly got the attention of the server asking where our food was or how much longer and he kept saying it'll be out soon. NOT UNTIL, I got a hold of the manager who was currently running for FOH & BOH.  -___- then and only then did our meal come out 5 minutes later.

Our waiter Evan recommended some beers for my wife and myself and we then ordered the tap burger (well done) and the smoked BBQ burger (medium). We also ordered a side of onion rings. The onion rings were battered perfectly and came with a fantastic ranch dipping sauce. When the burgers came out first thing I noticed was both were cooked PERFECTLY. I usually have to order medium at most places in the hopes of getting medium well if not completely well. As for my wife she likes hers well, but not burned like again most places do. Hers came out still super juicy and moist, not dry at all with great tempura bacon. The chips mine came with were lite and not over cooked. Wife got fries which again came out to her liking. Little too salty for her but I like mine that way and enjoyed the few I stole. Presentation was nice also. Both meals came out on small wood slabs which added to the rustic, simplistic nature of the food. Everything came out tasting fresh, with great flavors and did not taste processed like most restaurants nowadays. We had the wonderful opportunity to speak with Steve the manager who took the time to explain the dedication Tap 415 takes on their food. As we complemented how fresh the food tasted he told us how they freshly make almost everything. We finished our meal off with a strawberry shake and again we could taste the freshness in it. It wasn't sickly sweet and over processed, but creamy and smooth with a great fresh strawberry taste. I understand in this day and age people want everything fast and now, right this moment, but places like Tap 415 make you want to slow down and enjoy.", "author": "Jason B."}

They really do not accept cash, card only...\n\nIt got really awkward from there even though she was understanding. I thought to myself each server or bartender will have to announce cash only at the very beginning of meeting the customer. That is a great start to your experience (sarcasm font) \n\nFirst off, cash not accepted! Not acceptable! I understand in the day of Apple pay, bitcoins, and PayPal, people tend to only carry plastic but cash not accepted...WTF? \n\nSecond, I was told by the bartender they focus on local beer. There were only five out of 12 beers that were based in SF. Local my ass! Magnolia and 21st Amendment are a city standard for a solid beer bar but Tap 415 had the worst selection from SF, to surrounding Bay Area breweries and as far as NY. If you have the word \"Tap\" in your establishment name, you better live up to that. From the beer selection alone, the place should be called \"Mediocre SF Beer: Not All Local\" \n\nThe place itself is in a prime location inside the Westfield mall. The actual establishment is awesome, great seating, and good ambiance. \nI understand it's Westfield mall and 90 percent of people there are tourist but you simply cannot skimp on beer selection. Another person next to me complained about another beer that was flat. Again a place called Tap 415 should not even attempt to sell let alone sample flat beer, especially during a grand opening. It was late noon when I tried the flat stout so this tells me nobody is regulating the beers, it's almost as if they were selling the beer knowing it was flat. \n\nIf you are a beer snob like me, Mikkeller Bar is one block over on Market in between 5th and 6th street. And they have amazing food. Seriously go to Mikkeller Bar, the only other Mikkeller Bars are in Copenhagen, Bangkok, and Stockholm. It's beer heaven! \n\nI thought maybe I'll be back for the food but I have such a bad taste in my mouth Tap 415 is figment of my imagination! End rant....", "author": "Nick L."}

Tap 415 should stick to what it does best -- burgers and related items -- and leave the more esoteric dishes to others. \n\nThe delicious tap burger ($14) is garnished with tempura bacon (How do you make bacon better? Deep fry it in tempura batter.), cheddar, lettuce, pickled red onion, and togarashi remoulade. Served precisely medium, as ordered, it was juicy and satisfying. The accompanying barbecue chips were a disappointment, as they were a little on the soggy side. Served on ciabatta with lime aioli, cilantro, and queso fresco, the blackened spiced chicken ($13) was slightly dry. \n\nService was crisp and efficient. The kitchen also has its act together, as dishes arrived quickly. \n\nIn addition to wines and beers on tap, Tap 415 has a full bar. The S.F. Yacht Club ($11) is a new take on the standard greyhound, adding cucumber, lemon, lime, and mint to the usual vodka and grapefruit juice. The refreshing 415 Fizz ($11) up levels a traditional gin fizz with the addition of lemon and raspberries.\n\nIf you are downtown and get an arbitrary burger craving, Tap 415 can definitely help you out.", "author": "CJ G."}

My fianc\u00e9 & I tried the pork sliders & the shrimp tacos & it was mediocre at its finest. The setting of the restaurant being on the 4th floor, under the cool dome of the Westfield Mall downtown & the presentation of the food is impressive but in this case, looks are very deceiving. We walked to the front to see the host, the manager & a server all talking at the stand. We had to greet them before they even acknowledged us. \"Can I help you?\" the host asked...um? We would like to be seated? So I laughed & said we'd like a table for two. The three of them just looked at us & the host replied after a long pause, \"Oh, it's open seating.\" Ok, fine, we'll help ourselves? How were we supposed to know, it was our first time trying this place out. I guess this place gets a bunch of regulars because we saw a lot of 9-5 people sitting & having their drinks/meal alone & the server did talk to all of them like she personally knew them all. The irony of it being open seating, which I saw coming, was that of course, my fianc\u00e9 & I were neglected for quite some time. I had to keep looking & staring at the people working at the restaurant for them to notice we haven't even been given water yet. When we finally got a server she was very nice, the food however was not.\n\nThe shrimp tacos tasted like a cup of salt was poured on top of it. My fianc\u00e9 & I love salty food but dang, this wasn't even salty food, this was just pure salt with chewy texture that was supposed to be shrimp. The pork sliders were just ok but my fianc\u00e9 & I didn't even finish our meal & we ALWAYS do everywhere we go. Being avid Happy Hour goers, my fianc\u00e9 & I were disappointed. She even wanted to see if we could trade out our dishes for their pretzel bites because there's no way a restaurant can ruin that recipe (unless they poured a cup of salt on that too). The people who were having the actual dinner menu looked pleased with their meals so I'll give Tap 415 the benefit of the doubt when it comes to that but their Happy Hour was just not good.

I probably won't make any effort to come back here again, especially not by myself, but if I had to, I'd probably just stick to drinks.\n\nOn my last visit, our server pulled a disappearing act after we got our food, and didn't come back to check if we needed or wanted more drinks.  I was empty and wanted to order another beer, and literally had to flag her down to order.  Then it took a while to even get said beer.  Thank goodness I had my own water bottle because I was practically choking from being parched.  Enough meh experiences to not care about coming back.  Not bad or horrible, just not good enough to keep in the rotation.", "author": "Riza A."}

Other than the food court, there aren't many restaurant options for such a huge mall. My girlfriends and I decided to try Tap415 because they had the fastest seating available. The service was good, however the food was the most tasteless food I've ever had. I ordered the \"blackened spice chicken sandwich\" and upon ordering the waiter warned me this dish was spicy, so I was surprised when I bit into it and got a mouth full of cabbage and aioli with a hint of saltless, tasteless chicken. One of my friends ordered the \"fried chicken sandwich\" (which was stuffed with bacon) and had the same issue with lack of flavor and salt. My other friend ordered fish and chips and was letdown with the flavor as well. If you want fast service and don't mind if the food is tasteless, then come here, otherwise you're better off finding something at the food court.", "author": "Jazz S."}

We literally saw them just wilting in front of our eyes. Had I known that they were our salads, I would have just grabbed them. One of us ordered a medium burger and it was a bloody mess. After joking about how the burger was still mooing, we sent it back. The manager even came over and apologized for the wait but didn't offer us a discount or free appetizers. I'm glad that he acknowledged that service was slower than usual but an apology doesn't get us anywhere. Some of us in the group had to leave before the meal was over since we had been waiting for so long. Our entire lunch took over 2 hours when we had anticipated to be there for an hour or so.\n\nThe only reason I gave 2 stars was because their appetizers were amazing.

Therefore, we decided to go the spirit route and ordered adult Arnold Palmer's instead. It tasted good, but was a bit weak. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered some onion rings and hot dog bites wrapped in bacon. The onion rings were good, served with a blue cheese sauce. The hot dog bites; however, tasted like Oscar Mayer.  For 4.50, you get 4 small bites of nasty. Not even a full hot dogs worth!\n\nWe ordered burgers, which was the highlight of our meal. The artisan buns were tasty and the meat was juicy. Instead of french fries, the burgers come with BBQ chips, no substitutions allowed. They were good, most were crispy with a nice peppering of spice. \n\nMy burger came out initially with the wrong cheese, which was promptly corrected.  I didn't really mind, but we received a free onion ring and pretzel appetizer for the wait.  I'm not really a pretzel guy, but my friends liked the sauce.  This was a nice gesture and the manager also checked in to make sure we enjoyed the experience. \n\nOverall, for being a mall restaurant, this is a safe bet for burgers and a drink.

Ok.\"  He took a long pause while staring at me then asked.  \"What name is it under?\"\n\nI responded.\n\nHe responded flippantly with \"Did you read to the end of your reservation?\"\n\nWho does that.  It is a reservation in a mall restaurant.  How hard can it be to walk over and show up on time.  I, the maker of the reservation for our party of six, responded, \"No.\"\n\nHe snapped, \"What's wrong with you guys.\"  I guess he has a chip on his shoulder about customers or some other category that we fit into.....\n\nHe embarked on a 5 minute lecture on why we should read, which included how we needed to read it all the way to the end.

Also, please note that the maximum size group we can accommodate is 12 total guests. When making reservations, always account for children if applicable. Thank you and we look forward to welcoming you!\n\nMe again. Get you seated promptly is not what he did.  To top it off the service was extra slooooow.  Our waitress was extra nice.  I guess she knows her manager is a tool and knows she needs to make up for it.\n\nI hope he read this review to the end.\n\nA word of advise to the manager.  Shut up.  Be polite.  Do your job.  You set the tone for your team.  If you don't like customers, find yourself a new job.  Or maybe that is why you ended up as the manager of a mall restaurant.", "author": "George P."}

After our drinks were ordered, simple ice teas, he didn't come back for a while. At least not in the usual reasonable time that it would normally take. Mind you the restaurant was kind of dead. It would have been nice if he could've taken our order for starters down so we didn't have to wait all over again. But of course after our drinks he didn't come back again to take our order. The manager had to come and take our order after seeing how long we waited. He never came back to check on us.

Who would have thought their restaurant collection would include a bar with TVs?\n\nLet's be honest here, how many husbands and boyfriends were dreading shopping with their wives and girlfriends and feeling there isn't enough lounge space at every store, and that sales associates begin to tell them that they can't sit on the table where clothes are neatly folded for shoppers? How wonderful is it for them to just drink their pain away as they wait hours and hours for their significant other to stop swiping their credit cards? \n\nI think having TAP415 in the shopping center is a brilliant idea. Not only do you get to sit down, and you get to drink your beer, and there are TVs all around so perfect to watch your favorite sports. The only thing lacking is their TVs are on mute. Just do your silent cheerleading chants. They have happy hour everyday from 3-6, got beers on draft, house wine, oyster shooters, shrimp tacos, chips, etc. Many of you might like it here more so than sitting at La Boulange right outside, there's greater entertainment value! Their beer selection is pretty local, got your Firestone, Lagunitas, 21st Amendment, Anchor Steam. Average pricing, $6-8 regularly, $5 for happy hour.\n\nBut really, their food menu isn't all that impressive. I've had their seafood creole hot dog, had their shooters, had their chips. Best thing ever on the menu would be their chips. Few bucks for a bar snack during happy hour is totally worth it. Usually that comes with your burgers and sandwiches too. Got the texture of your favorite kettle chips. I'm not a big fan of their oyster shooters, too many shells in the oysters, too much watered down bloody Mary mix, just gives you a weird aftertaste. The hot dog was alright, flavors pretty good, got a bit of a bang. Texture was a bit lacking, shrimp sausage isn't the best thing to stay together. Oddly enough, mine was served with the plastic or cellophane wrapper with sauce over the wrapper. Their response was that the sausage would fall apart without the wrapper. Didn't seem to see it on other people's picture of the same dish. However they did offer to fix up the dish without the wrapper if I preferred that way. Definitely easier to eat without the wrapper choking me halfway, but not something I would go out of my way to order again.", "author": "Connie C."}

They have over a dozen taps of nearby craft beer and were very willing to give samples. \n\nOverall a surprisingly excellent experience in a very convenient location.

This preparation was on the drier side, allowing for the smokiness of the aged cheddar to really shine. Ask for a side of their habanero chili sauce and it's the perfect compliment to this dish. \n\n-Tap fries in parmesan & basil with side of roasted garlic aioli: Perfectly crisp and the ideal dipping sauce \n\nPretty good:\n-Wild mushroom sandwich,  smoked burrata, tomato, olive, nettle pesto, ciabatta: not my #1 choice for a sandwich, but my vegetarian best friend really liked it. The smoked burrata was a nice touch and the mushroom sandwich was really meaty. \n\n-Tap burger, tempura bacon, cheddar, lettuce, onion, togarashi remoulade: pretty tasty burger, but it felt on the heavy/greasy side, I suppose that was a function of the grease from the burger, tempura bacon, and cheddar\n\nOkay, but I would pass: \n-Reuben tator tots with russian dressing: good in concept, lackluster in execution. The tots themselves were good, but the bits of pastrami and the dipping sauce felt disconnected from the tots. \n\nA decent option if you're looking for something to eat while you're in the mall, but I wouldn't go out of the way to dine here.", "author": "Monelle A."}

This isn't some destination micro brewery or a Michelin recommended place.  For what it is, it's awesome!!  \n\nIt's a place to leave your whining children with your glazed over husband where they can eat fried foods without guilt since its made with high quality ingredients and drown their boredom in milk shakes and beer while you get some alone time to shop.  \n\nThe Reuben tater tots are a creation by someone who was toking one some serious MJ.  Brilliant.  Fancy stoner food always wins!  The crab sandwich and Reuben were surprising light and both had just the right amount of dressing.  \n\nThe service is attentive and helpful but most of all efficient.

On the Fourth Floor of this 9-story mall, it is the perfect respite while shopping from bottom to top.  I've stopped in several times over the last few months and today's meal prompted this good review.  As the name implies, the well-designed space has a plethora of beer choices as well as cocktails and wine.  Its menu has a number of options but I've typically stuck with a beer and a burger during our mid-day shopping trips. Today my eye caught the Smoked Mushroom Sandwich and I don't think it could have tasted any better.  Before even starting her Caesar Salad, my daughter asked for a bite of my sandwich and a few minutes later half of it was gone.  The Caesar Salad wasn't special but it was what it was supposed to be. Also have to mention what appeared to be their seasoned potato chips made in-house.  Delicious..\nFive stars because the place over-delivered on its value proposition: very good food and beer, properly priced and an attentive wait staff.

The doughnut's served with chocolate dip, were extremely tasteless and a total waste of money.  The small green salad was served with dressing but you could not tell and have to ask for more.  The service was also very scattered.

Two of us ordered beer and two of us ordered coke.\nFirst the drinks. The coke is not regular coke. It's some fancy stuff that they put in a glass that's almost as a small as a shot glass (I'm being dramatic, but it is seriously small), and it's $3.50. Really? No. It tasted fine but not good enough to be almost four bucks without refills. Can't say about the beer, they seemed to enjoy it. \nNow the food. The monte cristo was served on a wooden plank and the chicken sandwiches were served on rectangular white plates. Both dishes had some disgusting pickled mixture of pickles, beets, and cauliflower on the side. For $12 this shit better come with fries. Nope. The waiter asked us if we wanted to share an order of fries and we said yes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-05-23", "description": "Sadly this was my second visit to this restaurant and overall it was similar to my last unfortunate experience there:\n\n* Service:  lacks coordination.  There looked to be an adequate number of team members between the host, servers and bartender and yet they are often wandering around while you wait for one of them to acknowledge you and ask if you need anything.  The space is so big, maybe they get lost.\n* Food:  mediocre at best.  Even for pub grub (and the prices are way higher than that) the food is nothing to get excited about.  In fact, some items are just bad.  Another poster mentioned that they are trying to be \"high end\" which the prices certainly reflect; unfortunately the quality of the food does not.\n* Bar:  they still don't know how to make a decent martini.\n\n95% of bartenders know that the majority of people who enjoy them want their Martini very dry.  Why do the other 5% insist upon drowning the gin or vodka in vermouth.  I asked for olives in my martini and they made it with lemon.  The replacement cocktail had the olives but the vermouth was pretty intense.  I did finish the replacement cocktail (glass empty and placed on edge of table) and had my food in front of me and sat there for a good 6 minutes (while two waiters whizzed by) before I got up and asked the bartender for another drink (without vermouth) and the ice water that I had requested when I initially sat down.  This exact same thing happened on my last visit.\n\nI ordered the Hamburger (and paid the additional $2 for cheese) and Onion Rings (all four of them).  The burger comes with a really big bun and a really small hamburger patty. There may have been cheese hidden in there somewhere but I had a hard time locating it.  They provide no ketchup or mustard unless you ask (and good luck getting anyone to assist you).\n\nThe Ranch Dressing with the Onion Rings was completely watered down which made it the consistency and taste of water.  Same with the mustard.  They seem to be trying to cut corners by diluting the condiments which quite honestly is shocking.  The onion rings were, like the burger, without any real flavor.  I think they were home-made but the only taste sensation was that of lingering flour.  The watery ranch dressing did not help.\n\nI ordered the Salted Caramel Brownie in Cr\u00e8me Anglaise for desert.  It was completely bland.  No chocolate or vanilla flavor; just a big nothing on the taste meter.  I left two thirds of it on the plate and no one bothered to ask me why.\n\nWhen the bill came, they had charged me for the \"wrong\" martini which they remade.  Again, it took five minutes (with the check open on the table and me sitting there with my coat on) for someone to look at me so I could flag them down to get the check corrected.  I was informed that they \"would look into it.\"  The check was fixed far more easily than the service here will ever be.\n\nIt truly pains me to say that this restaurant is showing very big distress signs.  They are scrimping on the food which is lackluster to start with.  They have been open for a year and a half and the service is still amateur hour.  The prices are impossible to justify given the quality of the food and service.

When we got our food all the burgers were cut in half and we could see it was all raw. We ordered either medium or medium well. We were over waiting and just wanted to eat. Well after awhile we just couldn't eat the raw burgers. We got the managers attention to let them know that our burgers were beyond raw. The manager recooked the burger and took 50% off the bill. For the price of the burgers, wait times and the taste I won't come here again.

They are listening, folks, and they seem committed to making this great space and idea really work. Chad thanked me for my feedback, noted that he and the team agreed with what I'd shared, and let me know that they were already working on modifying their menu. I am definitely going back, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the next experience is outstanding. If they have a kid-friendly mac and cheese next time we visit, they could end up being our home base for every shopping trip.\n\nThank you, Chad. Added back a star for your reaching out to me and am hoping to add more once we stop by again.\n\nSee you in the new year, Tap415.\n\n-------\n\nMy wife, our 7-year old, and I were headed to Lark Creek Steak when we spotted Tap415. It looked wonderful, so we decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, it disappointed.\n\nI got the bratwurst, which was fine but certainly not what you'd call a generous serving. Wife got a burger sans bun, which she liked. Kiddo got the kid's mac and cheese, which was a huge mistake. It came with toasted breadcrumbs sprinkled on the top, \"green things\" (chopped leafy stuff) mixed in to it, and made use of some taste-challenging cheeses. No way is this a kid's dish. I took a bite, I didn't like it either (and I like cheese). He ate his fries, and he and I both left hungry and wanting another shot at a decent lunch. The above-average price just added a bit of insult to a thoroughly mediocre meal.\n\nThere were also TONS of service staff wandering around, yet we somehow couldn't get anyone's attention until it was time to clear our plates and get the check.\n\nIt's a beautiful space and a neat idea, I really hope they get it together. Next time, though, we're not stopping until we're enjoying a meal in Lark Creek!", "author": "Scott D."}

Coming out I wonder how much Tap415 damages the brand of 25 Lusk. They have a big problem here.\n\nSeat yourself. Ok. It was fairly crowded but we walked up to an unoccupied 2-top. There were two glasses of water, each with a cover over the top. As we began to sit down, the waiter told us that both of the people sitting there had gone to the bathroom. Hmm. Ok. We shoehorn ourselves into another shared table. Ten minutes later, nobody sitting at that table. Fifteen minutes. Twenty minutes. It was simply a waiter saving a table for a friend that never showed up. This is supposed to be a first come, first serve place. That kind of game is really frustrating.\n\nWe order. Our beers arrive. Then all five plates...pickles, appetizers and entrees all arrive together. At the wrong table. The other diners start eating our dinner. Quickly we call the waiter over and grabs four of the as-yet untouched plates and moves them to our table. We jettison the pickles and let the other table go to town.  (As it turns out, their order was later screwed up three times.) First up is the mac and cheese. They should rename the dish mac and watery cheese. Apparently the elbow noodles hadn't been properly drained of the water they were boiled in. The dish is, a word, disgusting. The tater tots were served with a truly unfortunate aioli-sauerkraut melange. The chicken schnitzel was a massive plane of flavorless fried chicken served over some tough, green spaetzle and a lackluster, flavorless sauce. A complete miss. The bratwurst sandwich was poorly designed and difficult to eat though it tasted fine.\n\nThe service was a disaster. The food was a disaster. The beer was fine.

The food is on the saltier side - I guess that goes along with beer. The service is inconsistent - some are super friendly, others are pushing you to get out of the restaurant. I think I'm confused about what they are trying to do - the number of TVs on sports channels made me believe that this was like a sports bar, but you feel pressured to leave once you're done with your food even when the place is half empty. The food is fine but seems a bit overpriced.", "author": "Jane L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-29", "description": "First, it's relatively new so I *might* give them a second chance. It's a good concept, for a shopping mall location. Open space to grab a drink, while taking a break from shopping and/or waiting to meet up with a friend. My advice, drinks are good, but skip the food. I ordered the burger and fries, small portions/over-priced and mediocre flavors. Also, while the service staff seemed well intentioned, they didn't have it nailed down by section so it was a lengthy wait to put in my order or ask for follow-up items. Very inefficient. Again, it's still relatively new so I can give them the benefit of the doubt about possibly working out a few kinks in the kitchen and service.", "author": "Tim M."}

We sat directly by the hostess counter where employees visited frequently to put in orders, however no one checked in with us and we had to finally ask the guy stacking glasses for our check. Maybe not a bad place to go if you're stuck at the mall, but there are certainly better options for a glass of wine and a snack within walking distance.

If you go to Umami Burger, you'd pay just as much.  The Tap Burger is AMAZING. The selection of beers is FANTASTIC. The service is EXCELLENT. And BART makes it a breeze to get there with no parking issues.  They are truly dedicated to providing an oustanding experience--as I learned reacently when placing an order to go for a friend who couldn't join due to some studying. Right before they were bringing out the food--we got a text from the friend saying he was on his way (needed a break from studying).  When we asked our server to just hold the food and bring it out on a plate when our friend arrived, she hesitated but agreed.  Then, the manager showed up at the table and said he couldn't allow our friend to eat something that had been sitting there and insisted that they cook it fresh after he arrived--at no charge.", "author": "Denice A."}

I'd definitely return to eat here again, but I'm not particularly craving it, a day after.  Everything was really well presented as a sort of fancy diner, with the prices to match.  The Tap Burger was good, the fries were good, but neither really stood out.  The coffee shake that I got was really disappointing and seemed to follow the standard San Francisco trend of adding booze to things for the sake of novelty.  I'm sure there's a lot of marketing appeal to a city full of burgeoning alcoholics, but the scotch completely overpowered whatever flavors came from the coffee and hazelnut.\n\nI think the total was $28 without tax and tip, which seemed pretty expensive for, again, what is pretty much just fancy diner food, but about half of that was the kinda underwhelming shake, which I'd avoid in the future.  Maybe their regular shakes were good, though.", "author": "Norman S."}

I did medium/medium rare/ some pink- he said that they do tend to cook a little under norm so I asked for medium. The burger came out (almost too) fast- and was cooked with some pink- very nice. But otherwise he burger lacked flavor. The tempura bacon which was the draw was ok- underwhelming. I waited for my tots- no tots. It took 15 minutes for the waiter to circle back to ask how the burger was and I said \"tots?\"  He quickly corrected his mistake. The tots were great! But by the time I got them, I had eaten half of my burger (very slowly) the other half was cold and by the time I asked for ketchup (another 10 minutes later) I was kind of over it. The waiter was super nice and gave me a beer on the house which was very appreciated. So overall, below average burger, above average tots, slow service but a free beer- so we land on 3 stars.

The fries were men, the tots were good but not very many of them. Prices were fairly high. There were more staff than customers, 2pm on a Saturday.

The fries were little bits of potato that to me at least are the dregs of a batch of french fries.  I don't know if this is just their style or they just were not good.

The reason I'm giving them 2 stars is cause of the service we got we got to Tap415 and sat our selfs it took a bit for the server to come to us, once she did she took our orders for our drinks we ordered two lemonades one for my self and for my partner and my friend ordered a beer, mind you I've never worked at a restaurant and who knows If they where short staffed that night but it took them like 15 min to bring out me and my partners drinks and even longer for my friend to get his beer. When the waitress came to let us know his beer was gonna be right out she never asked if he would like any water while he waited (just as courtesy ) anyway finally they bring his beer out and they brought our food shortly after. The food was great I really liked it, they had a yummy blackened chicken sandwich that I loved and we ordered a side of Mac and cheese, that was delicious until my partner found a stay hair in it. I'm not the kind of person to complain if the food is not good but a hair yuk I can't let that slide so we grabbed what looked like a supervisor and she was super nice about it and took it off our bill and was apologetic. That just kinda killed the appetite and we asked for the check if give this place another try for sure but hope they can be a little more attentive with the service.", "author": "Josh R."}

I came here once before and had a great time, but this time was just worth it. Came for happy hour, and ordered a Stone beer, a Prohibition beer, bbq chips, and an oyster shot. Oyster shot never came during my time there, but whatevs I forgot about it and so did Tiara. Once the bill came the beers were listed as $5 and the oyster shot was on the receipt as well. I told Tiara that the oyster shot never came and she was able to take it off the new bill. BUT! when the bill came the beers were $8 and $6 respectively. Granted, she didn't tell me that the beers I ordered weren't on the happy hour menu, and the bill she originally gave me belonged to the gentleman who sat behind me because he just so happened to order the exact same things as me (which is some ol booshit), the new bill she gave me ended up costing more. I really hate to give this 1 star and a terrible review, but Tiara was just serving up some booshit by upcharging me when I know you could have given me the happy hour prices for the beers, because I'm sure the gentleman who sat behind me is getting that kind of service.
