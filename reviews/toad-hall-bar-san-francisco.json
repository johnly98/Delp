Close behind is Temple, but Toad Hall beats it for a couple reasons.\n\n1. You will never find cheaper drinks. They have $5 well cocktails, and when I say cocktails I mean a cup full of liquor with a splash of mixer. They do not taste good, but they do the job.\n\n2. The music is really fun (90s/throwbacks + newer dance music + music to sing along to), and they play music videos which is a cool addition. \n\n3. I rarely feel like it's too crowded. The dance floor isn't big, but there's usually enough space to dance without getting annoyed.\n\nNotes:\n- if you're a girl this place is great because it's a gay bar, so you won't have to deal w guys hitting on/touching you\n- if you're a guy you may have to deal w guys hitting on/touching you if you don't come with a group of girls. If you come w a couple girls you should be good.", "author": "Elena K."}

It's now airier and brighter, and sports a good sized dance floor, big bar, a few high tops, and a small back room which I peeked into.  It's the most \"clubby\" vibe I've experienced in the Castro so far, better than Badlands IMO.  The room was also perfectly lit, not dark and shady like at other places.  The crowd was a mix of ages and personalities, dancing to a blend of pop, dance, and R&B.\n\nSERVICE:\nWe sat at the bar and received fast and friendly service from the male bartender.  He kept the bar top clean and drinks flowing.  Beer prices were average.\n\nOVERALL:\nNice new digs, friendly staff and patrons, great place to dance.", "author": "Vince N."}

Sure, and thank you Google Maps.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was there was no bouncer carding. Maybe the Castro is more laid back like that? But ran into my friend and some of his friends in the main bar area - typical layout with bar on one side, a counter by the windows, some booths on the far wall from the bar, and a large open area for dancing in between, with TVs playing music videos everywhere. \n\nNot sure if it's like this every night, but they had $3 well drinks. My friend joked how it was like cheap drinking in college again. It definitely tasted cheap and mistake-y, just like college. The drink was vile, but you get what you pay for. Seriously, pay the extra $3 for Jack or just power through.\n\nThere is also an outdoor patio with its own bar, but that bar closes a bit early. Plenty of heat lamps outside. In either area it wasn't cramped.\n\nSome observations\n-everyone knows everyone else\n-casual, positive vibe in both rooms. Considering the view from just walking past the Badlands, I'm glad my friend picked here.\n-I didn't realize how hardcore the drag queen scene is. I know, Castro, Duh! But it's another thing to have an Empress hopeful come in with fliers, fans, and stickers. To Deena Cartier, Imperial Crown Princess to the 22nd reign, Imperial Star Empire of Alameda - you have my vote.\n-Trying to explain Rifftrax and Mystery Science Theater 3000 was more difficult than powering through the cheap drink.", "author": "Michael C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-04-01", "description": "Let me begin by saying that I have been to this bar many times since I have lived in SF, and have always had a wonderful experience. However, tonight was different. Tonight I was treated very disrespectfully by the staff, and neither I nor my friends will ever by giving this bar our business in the future. About a half hour ago, I went to meet my friends, showed my ID to a man named Toby (or Tony) working the line, and then went to pay the cover. When I realized I didn't have enough cash, I texted my friends who were inside to come out to spot me for the cover. The man working the cash register politely told me where I could find an ATM close by. Toby curtly asked me to step aside while I waited for my friends, which is fair. I stood on the sidewalk for a few moments while waiting for my friend, when he asked me with a very rude tone to move over so I wasn't blocking the sidewalk. I waited, and my friend came out and gave me the two dollars I needed. I hopped back in line, and offered the men my cash, at which point \"Toby\" told me I could not go inside, because I was \"too intoxicated.\" I informed him that I was not intoxicated, and he responded by mocking my body language, which is completely inappropriate and culturally insensitive, and telling me that it didn't matter what I said or did, I wasn't going to be let into the bar. I am a woman in my mid 20s, I had three drinks throughout the night, beginning at 7:30pm. It was 1:00am when I was going into the bar (I am writing this a half hour later). I was obviously not intoxicated. Certainly less intoxicated than most of the other people in line for the bar. I tried to reason with \"Toby\" seeking an explanation as to why I was not being allowed into the bar, as a patron who has given that bar my services for several years. Instead of treating me with respect and having a reasoned conversation with me, he threatened to call \"Castro Patrol\" and forced me to leave the premises. I have never been treated with such disrespect in my life, and I will be contacting Toad Hall to ensure that the manager knows his rude bouncer has cost the bar a lifelong patron. I am very disappointed, and feel that I was discriminated against as a woman, particularly when \"Toby\" mocked my body language, which was extremely offensive and unprofessional. When I politely asked why I wasn't being allowed in, and what I could do differently in the future, he told me to \"look less drunk.\" Obviously the person writing this review is not \"drunk.\" He had the nerve to say that to my face as I stood in front of him calmly asking him what the problem was, and what I could do differently. Needless to say, I will never be returning to Toad Hall. I have never been subjected to this kind of treatment in my life. I have never been mocked in this way in my life. And as an influential professional woman in SF I will make sure my friends and social circles choose other bars in the area. Your loss, Toad Hall. I suggest you reconsider your employees.", "author": "Alex D."}

The music is horrible (same electro remix beats all night long) , but the drinks are okay. Big patio in the back. No cover before a certain time (usually like 9pm-ish), and even then it's cheap.\n\nHowever I almost had to put the bartender in check; first a couple kept walking past me and my friend (probably because they didn't think we were \"cute enough\"), and then the one who did finally help us still didn't look pleased to serve us. Well, F you too dude. You wish you were all that but you're not. I really should have gotten his name. \n\nThere was the happy hour special still going on, get 1 drink and the other one is only like a $1, so I ordered two strawberry cosmos. And the bartender stupidly asks \"One or two sets?\" I didn't understand what he meant at first so I just repeated myself with \"No, 2 strawberry cosmos please\" and he rudely ROLLED HIS EYES at me and was like \"Yeah, but do you want 1 or two sets??\" with a snobby attitude. Um HELLO?? Do you see four people standing in front of you? When I first made the order I pointed to me and my friend next to me, the ONLY TWO GUYS in front of you, and I said TWO  COSMOS. NOT TWO SETS OF COSMOS. \n\nSo of course I only tipped him one lousy dollar, and I made sure to stand there at the same spot and wait for him to be even more disappointed when he picked it up. I don't know what's up with the snobby SF bars I've been having to deal with lately.\nHere's the thing, it wouldn't even have been much of a big deal if he didn't have such a messed up attitude while talking to me.

When I got the worst service I've ever gotten at a bar.  ESPECiALLY at a gay bar. In the midst of Sunday drinking with friends we wondered over to Toad Hall around 4pm because we all remembered having these amazing Baileys jello pudding shots. To our disappointment they weren't available so we had to come up with some other options to continue tying on a tight one. I approached the bar and noticed some signage for a bottle of champagne for $15 and thought it would be nice just to buy a bottle for my friends and myself.  So, (because it was ridiculously cheap and I knew it was not likely to be a #1 option I asked the bartender what kind of champagne) he immediately snapped back with \"I don't know it's cheap. There's a line\" ummm excuse the fuck out of me but you are in the service industry dude! And I did not say any of the following: \"is that $15 champagne as cheap as the Tijuana facelift you evidently had.. Because they missed your turkey gobble\"  \"Is that $15 champagne as aged as you are\"  \"which is a bigger joke that $15 champagne or the fact that you're 60 and in a muscle tee?\"  Immaterial superficialities aside.. I knew that  I was not getting a bottle of Krug or Tattinger or fucking Cristal but this is San Francisco.  Sue me because I ambitiously and evidently very stupidly hoped to pay a 400% markup for possible bottle of trader joes  featured cremant. I was elated at the prospect actually.. And my  \nelation turned to intrigue And God forbid my intrigue turn into an inquiry. I am a bartender as well and I would be told to leave immediately if  my boss heard me speak to a guest that way and as well I should. In conclusion I surmise that the amazing times had at this bar were due to the company I kept. Maybe the service was good before and maybe not so good but it fell to the background and allowed me to enjoy the experience I was having with my friends where as this experience in particular, drew all of my attention to the fact that I was being spoken to an unthinkable manner in the context of \"service\" I hope the bartender puts the 50 cent tip I left him towards a shirt with sleeves.", "author": "Ryan J."}

They were having a special event 3 weeks ago on a Sunday when I went after having an already awesome day. My friend and I went in and here and they had a sign up that said free girls and beer HAHA funny. So went inside and they had leaning tower of jello shots. 10 for 3 bucks! well i had that and my friend got the free bottomless beer. \n\nI have to say the shots were enough for me. The vibe was really mellow. The bathrooms were gross. The back outdoor patio was full so we couldn't even sit outside but it looked really nice.

Some friends suggested that we try Toad Hall for a change. Cool, we like checking out new places, and the Castro usually does not disappoint.\n\nThe drinks were cheap and STRONG (typical of Castro bars). The Long Island's were quite deadly. I marveled over how spacious Toad Hall is. I couldn't tell if it's because the venue is larger than other bars, or if it's because fewer people come here. Either way, I was happy. Then things started to go horribly wrong...\n\nOne of our friends made the mistake of throwing an empty, plastic liquor bottle into the trash can near the bar. You know, one of those little liquor bottles you get on the plane. The bartender immediately escorted him out. Something about putting their liquor license at risk. It was stupid of our friend to do that right under the bartender's nose. Very stupid. I get that the bar has to follow certain rules and regulations, uphold certain standards, etc. What I don't get is why the bartender was so rude to the rest of us.\n\nThere were about 15 people in our group. Most people had no idea what had just happened or why it had happened. We asked the bartender, very politely, what was going on. Instead of just answering the question in a reasonable manner, he immediately snapped at us, accused us of wanting to cause trouble and threatened to call the police. Uhh, wow. It all makes sense now. This is why this place is so empty. Rude bartenders. Our group, of course, took off immediately to another bar.", "author": "Waz W."}

I don't have any objection to hanging out at gay bars. I generally prefer having the illusion, even if unlikely, that it's possibly to meet women when I'm out drinking.\n\nThis is either a short bus ride from the Mission, 33 Stanyan, or a longish uphill walk; I got lucky and barely caught the bus.\n\nI didn't immediately notice that there was a patio in the back so when I walked in and didn't see my friends I thought I might have gone to the wrong place. Once I walked around a bit I figured it out. The patio is a little small but very nice with a separate bar so you don't have to walk back in every time you drink.\n\nThere are flyers stuck to the walls promoting the drink specials, each one had a different drink with the description and the price and they were tacked up all over in no order or pattern. I don't have a crippling OCD, just enough for something like this to bug me. to be honest I was a little overwhelmed. I sat and talked to my friends a little at first without getting a drink but they weren't having it and berated me until I went up to the bar.\n\nI tried the drink specials called a \"strawberry cosmo\" listed for $5. That alone is a good deal. When the bartender started making two I was confused and asked him if he'd heard that I just wanted one, his reply was \" It's two for one\". On top of that they were both doubles. What I'm getting at is that you get giant cocktails here for $2.50 each.\n\nI was reading a text on our way out and walking kind of slow so my friends accused me of cruising the bar.

The outside area has a smaller bar.\n\nThe place was fairly packed.  Wait at the bar was pretty reasonable - while the bar was pretty full, I didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes to get my drink order in.  Prices were cheap too - 5 or 6 bucks for a Jack and Coke.  Like a lot of gay bars, they don't go chinzy on the alcohol so the drinks were strong.  \n\nMusic was pretty standard - they were playing 80's at first - Michael Jackson, Madonna, etc. and then switched over to mainstream hip hop/club music.  \n\nOverall, I'll probably be back - it wasn't a standout or crappy place.  I'm always down for no cover and cheap drinks though :)", "author": "Laura C."}

And it is definitely Badlands-lite.   Same concept without a big dance space.  \n\nThe one thing I feel obligated to report, however, is that the resident DJ there seems more concerned with seasonal decorations than the bar's patrons....and is possibly a little crazy.\n\nMy friend and I went there one night not too long after New Year's Eve, and they still had balloon decorations up.  You know, those long ones that people twist into animals.  So I reached up and twisted one for a bit.  Didn't harm it at all.  But so someone (old) taps me and is like, \"If you don't stop doing that you'll have to leave.\"  And I thought he was a random (old) schmoe making a joke and trying to hit on me , so I just laughed and was all \"good one!\"  and just kept twiddling.  At which point his (old) eyes got all crazy, he lost touch with reality and SHOVED me!  And screamed, \"That's it! You're out!\"  But then he just hi-tailed it back to the DJ booth, leaving me and my friend stunned.  What gives, buddy? Cracked out?  Had a bad day? Obsessed with the safety of your balloons that have been up for over a week?  \n\nRegardless of the fact that, okay, I admit that I probably shouldn't have been messing with the decorations, I have difficulty thinking of circumstances in which it's okay to SHOVE customers.  We left, cause he was obviously NUTS! and kinda scary (old). and I avoid the bar now when he's there.  Creepy!!!!  So take that (old) man!

Toad Hall is Badlands without the dancing.  I mean, really.  It is.  In fact, im under the impression that the owners of Badlands (SF and Sac) also own Toad Hall, which would explain a lot.\n\nRegardless of who owns Toad Hall, its actually a nice place to get drinks.  Good bar space and plenty of seating inside and a nice heated patio in the back with its own bar.  The heated element is very nice because it really does make the patio comfortable during colder nights, which are often in SF.\n\nPrices are good and the music is good too.  More mix of hip hop and dance music compared to Badlands.  Which makes sense to me because i feel Toad Hall is more of a bar than a club, meaning its a place to grab drinks and hang out and listen to music vs. go and dance.\n\nMy only critique is one for the majority of Castro: When will Castro embrace the beauty of plastic.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-11", "description": "I'm so hoping this place finds it's groove, because there is a lot to like about it.  The decor is definitely a bit more upscale than your average Castro bar, but is not overdone.  The back patio is very well designed and my fav spot of the place (even though I don't smoke).  And like the owner's other bars the drinks are strong, reasonably priced, and the staff is attractive (without being clone-y), reasonably diverse, and ridiculously nice.  Admittedly I'm a bit biased towards the staff because three good friends work either here or across the street at the owner's other property - but they really are gold.\n\nNow, since I actually do care about a place like this having success, I'm going to put on my marketing hat and talk about what seriously needs to be fixed to avoid failure.  I am not the first one that refers to this place in its current state as \"Baby Badlands\" or \"Badlands' Waiting Room\" - and that's, unfortunately, a recipe for failure.  Badlands is a unique success and I do not think it is capable of becoming a franchise for many reasons.  This place needs to find its own groove, its own regulars, and come into its own as completely independent from Badlands, or it will most definitely fail.  Here's what needs to be fixed (in order of priority):\n\n1) Get good independent DJ's from across San Francisco spinning there on either regular or random nights, let them bring their own playlists and their own style, and just turn 'em loose and let 'em go.  On nights when you can't get a live DJ, get your DJs to make pre-mixed sessions to run through the night - don't play the same video tracks played over at Badlands.  Or heck - let your staff program a playlist on non-DJ nights.  Admittedly, it seems the owner has gotten part of this message - last Saturday the DJ was really moving with the crowd and it was quite good.  The hip-hop seemed a bit forced at the end, but, in general, it felt like the DJ was being let loose, which often doesn't happen at Badlands.\n\n2) Take that damn dance floor OUT.  It is too small and looks absolutely ridiculous in that space.  This place seriously needs to be a lounge bar.  The dance floor makes it obvious there's an attempt to replicate Badlands - and that will be its undoing.\n\n3) Turn the volume down on the music to about half of what it is now.  Again, there is a sore lack of a truly nice, upscale, friendly LOUNGE bar in the Castro.  The rest of San Francisco is full of these types of bars and they do very well - but they ain't gay.  Why can't WE have one, too???!!!\n\n4) NO MORE MUSIC VIDEOS.  Use the video screens to play cool loungey visuals or visuals chosen by the DJ.  The best use of this I saw was on girls night at the Lookout on a Thursday - lots of cool old movies and foreign films (even some TV shows) playing in the background to go with the really eclectic music.  It created a totally cool and hip vibe - and so very different than Badlands or any other typical 'stro bar.\n\n5) Take out the tables, put in banquettes, sofas, etc. along the walls.  Again, this place seriously needs to be an upscale lounge.  It has so much potential as this given the quality of the staff and the great space - and especially how miserably Trigger delivers on what \"upscale\" should mean in the 'stro.\n\n6) Upgrade the alcohol behind the bar.  Get some higher end liquors.  Yes, you will need to diversify your stock and that will increase costs and you might have to increase drink costs to be a bit higher than Badlands, but you won't have to overprice them (like Trigger or Lookout) and you'll satisfy what a lounge crowd is going to want - to call their drinks.\n\nI really don't want to see this place fail.  It has so much potential and I do love the staff and, in general, the crowd here.  But this place should not be only 3/4 full on a weekend because everyone would really prefer to be at Badlands.  This place needs to get its own devotees.  I hope to become one.  And if the owner reads this and wants to pick my marketing brain a bit further on how to make this place a bang up success, feel free to e-mail me :).", "author": "Chris P."}

The outdoors has wooden tables and stools, and really feels like The Mix with plastic surgery. It's covered by a retractable awning to make it usable even when it rains. Most of my friends smoke, so that's where we hang out -- but as a nonsmoker, it's one of the better ventilated areas for me to be able to hang out with my friends when they smoke.\n\nSurprisingly, the cocktail hour goes relatively late (2 for 1 until 8:30), and the prices are pretty competitive (wells are around $4.50, depending what you get).\n\nMy issues with Badlands has always been that it's too dark and hard to see, and too many guys cop an attitude there that I don't see when I see them elsewhere.

My only complaint is it tends to get way too warm inside, and they often have the outdoor heaters on when they're not needed, so there's no escaping the warmth! All in all, take your happy hour over to Toad Hall first, you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Brian B."}

I like the lay out and the front bar back drop.  The patio is awesome.  I don't like where the coat check is though.   I also do not think the bar is big enough to have a dance floor and that D.J. booth has to go.  Maybe they should spruce up the patio area with some plants and do something with that back bar decor.", "author": "Roddster V."}

We've become happy-hour regulars, (not late-night clubbers), and really like the clean, comfortable design, the easy-on-the-eyes and friendly bar staff, the music and, most of all, the great rear patio.  \n\nTrue, there is nothing particularly creative or unique about Toad Hall.  But, then again, so many of the Castro watering holes feel shabby and are filled with depressed drunks, these days, so I suppose it IS unique that the place is fresh and happy.\n\nThere are a few \"pet peeves,\" I'm afraid.  We've been ordering the same drinks, several times a week, for several months.  They are almost ALWAYS out of our preferred fruit, (nothing fancy, just a lemon twist or, failing that, a lemon wedge), and often out of our preferred liquor, (again, nothing fancy, Sky, Bacardi).  You'd think someone would mention that this happens daily and that they would fix it.  (Business Hint:  If you're constantly running out of something, it probably means you're selling a lot.  Maybe you should stock a little more).\n\nAnd, who ever heard of a bar that doesn't have coffee?  On these cold winter days, it would be so nice to have an Irish, or Kahlua Coffee but, while they have the liquors, they don't have the coffee.  (The bartender suggested I run down to Starbucks, once, and that they would add the liquor when I came back!).\n\nAnyway, despite the pet peeves, we really enjoy the bar, staff (although it would be nice if they could remember what the regulars drink), and the crowd.  A perfect after-work stop off.", "author": "Sebastian T."}

Kinda reminds me of Badlands crossed with Hunters in Palm Springs, with the patio of Mix thrown in at the back. So far, I've seen quite a varied crowd there. I think a lot of people are checking it out. On my three occasions there, there seem to be more guys in their thirties and forties than at Badlands. To me, that is a nice change. I hope the music changes though. I do like Badlands for music occasionally, but I'll go there for that.

This place is just like badlands except smaller, cleaner, and with a cute little patio out back. Someone else said that this place is like the badlands/mix offspring and I cant agree more!!\nThe +++'s: \nDrinks were super duper cheap! was here on a Thursday night and they had happy hour til 10pm (if theres one thing i like more than happy hour its happy hour that goes late!). Ordered a ketel and soda for myself and my friend....got 4 of them all for $13!! That's like the price of one at a bar in any other city! Kudos to Mr Toad for the cheap libations. \nAlso, who doesn't love a bar with an outdoor patio?? I mean sure, the weather in SF may not be ideal for such a concept, but toad hall has heat lamps on they're patio for us to all huddle around. There's also a bar on the patio so you don't have to venture allllllll the way back inside for a cocktail ;) \nThe music....again, think badlands. Lots of pop, dance and euro trash type stuff....twas fine.  \nAll in all, i will def return to toad hall. Its a nice (yet oh so very similar)alternative to the mess that is sadlands.

For starters, their patio is great, and you can always seem to find a friendly face there.  Secondly, the dance floor, albeit tiny, is fun (when you have the right partner of course).  And lastly the service.  At most bars in Castro you can always find a welcoming smile from many of the bartenders, however at this establishment I found one who is a cut above the rest!  I was out on a thursday evening, and after throwing back a couple Vodka Tonics (extra lime of course) I noticed (to my horror) a friend had threw up on herself, the working bartender, and the man next to her.  I, however, was not in this line of fire.  Imagine for a moment being thrown up on...... I would be a little peeved, however, the bartender working was a complete and total gentleman.  He helped my friend clean herself up as well as going the extra mile to make sure she was comfortable, and reassured her to not be embarrassed about said situation.  Anyways, I made sure to get this bartenders name, as well as to yelp him, because even after this whole debacle he's always had that smile, and that great genuine attitude.  I believe his name is Nathan, and not that i go to Castro too often, you can see him working here.  He always says hello, and makes marvelous drinks! He is a great asset to this place, and probably the main reason i go back! He's awesome, and and great! When you  see him, make sure to smile, and tip well  =)", "author": "Brendan D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-07-25", "description": "I'm very sorry to say that my experience of Toad Hall the second time round was extremely disappointing, at best. I returned because the first time I went, the music was so much fun to dance to, and I've been hard pressed to find good dance music that isn't entirely repetitive in San Francisco, save for live bands. This place is like Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde! The bar staff was wonderful during serving hours, but as soon the staff began kicking us all out of there, everything changed. It was only 15 until 2, and without even waiting for a fight, the staff kicked immediately into nazi mode to get everyone out the door! I politely told the fat bouncer (yes, fat, not muscles) that I needed to use the toilette first, please, and he barked at me to hurry. I went inside, and this disgusting guy came inside, whacked out on god knows what, told me he was going to jack off, so I left and went into the other one. It was full, so after a moment, I went back to the first one to see if jack off had finished, but he was still in there. At this point, fat ass bouncer came to me to tell me to leave again, and standing next to me, he interrupted my calm explanation about the jack off guy with absolutely NO provocation on my part, NO movement on my part, and no touching on my part, by barking \"Don't touch me!!\" It was so bizarre! I overlooked it, and decided he was tripping out on something, and proceeded to finish my explanation of why I was still there, which was that I was waiting for jack off to finish. I was so unnerved by the harshness this fat bouncer exhibited toward me, so on the way out, I said in my defense, \"I had no intention of ever touching you!\"  to which he yelled something crass back at me, couldn't make it out, but I know it was hostile. Meanwhile, my friend had been literally physically forced outside the bar, even though he had no drink and hadn't drank alcohol all night - in fact, that was why they told him he had to leave! They said if he had a drink, he could stay! He was stunned, having been a barman/bar manager for several years in Europe, that this is how they treat the sober people who are responsible enough to drive and not wreak havoc on the streets or with innocent ladies in the toilette, such as my jack off guy, for that matter. He tried to keep an eye on me from the outside, so they saw this, and came by and shut the shade in his face! It was very obviously a hostile act. (Is this because he was straight and not into them all night? Can't help but wonder!) The music was ok if you like top 40 crap. But fat ass guy clearly has a deep seated anger toward females - no respect whatsoever. I don't care if this is a gay bar, per se, fatt ass needs to get with the times and remember what the rainbow flag originally intended before the gay community glommed onto its magnanimous meaning and claimed it their own - the multi colours stood for all orientations, all walks of Life, all ethnicities, all genders and identities thereby, to come together and Unite under one flag. It's natural that the gay community grasped onto this concept the quickest, being's how we have been so ostracised by the world at large, but its time to relinquish sole hold on that flag and share its True meaning once again. Being new to the bay area, I was shocked at such obvious display of masoginy in the gay community, since I had otherwise experienced most of San Fran as being really cool about mixed crowds. Especially this kind of treatment from a bouncer, with whom I have never, in my Life, experienced problems, let alone been bullied by males like this. Neither my Friend nor I were harmful to anyone in there. We minded our own business, made some friends, even, and had a good time being out, for the most part - until we had to deal with fat ass' childhood issues rearing their ugly head.  This guy really needs to sort out his mother issues - either that or get another job. They are looking for bouncers there, we noted. Huh, wonder why?", "author": "Thomas C."}

He was screaming at me!  When I told him that he was going to be awhile with the other group, he insisted he could multi-task and I underestimate him.  He then proceeded to scream at the new bartender.\nWhen the beers arrived, the new bartender profusely apologized and I told him that it's obvious at Toad Hall that they are all about the customer experience (very sarcastically).  I asked to speak to the manager and he told me that the first bartender is the manager.\n\nSum it all up - the Asian-American guy at the first bar inside the front door is also the manager, so he's allowed to scream at customers and get away with it and scream at the staff and get away with it.
