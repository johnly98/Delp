The MC shamed us constantly on the mic for not tipping, even though we were.

I get that drag queens are suppose to be funny and play with the audience, but we were literally being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable the entire time we were there. As a member of the LGBT family it was sad to see a place like this, in San Fran of all places, representing us in such a shitty light. Also, the drinks are cheap, yes, but you are most likely not getting what you pay for. We ordered Tito's and soda all night and it definitely tasted like the shittiest vodka you could find in a gas station for $4.99 a bottle.", "author": "Rue H."}

During the weekend drag shows it is a more mixed crowd of straights/gays/locals/tourists/bridal parties, etc. Everyone has a good time.  The drinks are strong and cheap.  A mixed drink is $4.75 with lots of booze.  That same drink a block over is $12! Friendly bartender and one I am told who works afternoons who is 91.  Don't let the area put you off.  It's gritty but not \"unsafe.\"\n\nGo early (5 PM to 7:30 PM ish) and there is a really kind, sweet guy (Michael) to the left of the front door a bit with a charcoal grill...fresh BBQ sausages on a bun with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, ribs, half chickens, ribeye steaks and various other grilled treats at amazingly low prices.  Sooooo tasty and only $3 or $2 for sausages depending on the type.  Support his business--he's super cool, does not drink, do drugs, etc. and this is his only source of income.  He takes tremendous pride in being able to serve the community fresh grilled meals.  If anything is left unsold he generously shares it with those in need at no cost.  \nGreat guy!

To clarify, the show was entertaining, but mostly because of the randomness associated with the dual responsibilities that the entertainers take on.\n\nOne of the queens is not only 3rd in the show, but also acts as waitress and bar back when the bar is low on ice. Another girl follows her and doubles as DJ (read: has a Discman or older iPod that connects to the bar's speakers). She was a trip because none of her songs were recognizable by the largely gay male and straight fruit flies that were cheering this mess on throughout the night. At one point I swear she was lip synching about bugs (presumably roaches).\n\nThe saving grace was that everyone seemed to acknowledge that this was a high-in-the-wall bar with a drag show that would start when they felt like starting. No intermingling with the entertainers behind the screen that separated the public bathrooms with their dressing room.\n\nCash only and definitely a good place to see some authentic San Francisco grime and myrrh all in one place.", "author": "David K."}

Yes, this place is in the TL, but I wouldn't say you absolutely need to take a cab. I wouldn't feel comfortable walking there alone, but it wasn't a terrible walk in a small group. The bar is tiny. Definitely make reservations. I was expecting at least a stage of some sort and more tables. Instead, it's just a rectangular room with a bar, a few tables, some benches against the wall, and a curtain at one end. \n\nInteresting mix of people. Quite a few straight girls, a few younger gays, and the back of the bar was full of older-skewing gay men who our cocktail waitress pointed out were \"only drinking water\"\n\nCover was only 5 bucks. Drinks were CHEAP. 2 well drinks, a shot of whiskey, and a PBR came out to 14 bucks. So you can get drunk off your ass for basically nothing. \n\nThe Hot Boxx girls were hit or miss, but mostly amazing. There were four of them (but based on their website they must rotate?) Ronnie was freaking fabulous. She knew every lyric and paused appropriately, she had an amazing body, and could dance her ass off. I'll admit I only recognized 25% of the songs, but it was still a good time. One queen (I forgot her name but she was also the DJ) picked some strange songs and seemed a little out of it.

The ex-boss went on a hideous drunk one night, resulting in a one-after-the-other string of alcohol induced atrocities.  The crowning offense of the evening was when the psychotic boss \"Went to a transvestite bar in the Tenderloin that opens at six in the morning\".  The final mention sparked my interest, and another seedy bar was added to my must-check-out list...\r\n\r\nAnd check it out I did one weekend day, when myself and a ladyfreind were in search of \"hidden charm within the Tenderloin\".  After several hours of searching we came up empty handed.  To commiserate, I suggested a quick round at Aunt Charlie's.  Myself and this lady  had a bad habit of getting comfy in a bar and extending one round into three.  This time, we didn't have that problem....\r\n\r\nTo say Aunt Charlie's was dimly lit would be an understatement.  Sunlight blared in through the entrance, but farther back in the bar it became flat-out dark....the only illumination in the place was a net of miniature Christmas lights tangled in a mesh on the ceiling.  I had a beer, but my sidekick ordered a glass of wine. The bartender, a neurotic cross-dresser who looked like Uncle Fester in a Bra, practically had to dust off the one bottle of white wine they had in the place.  Finding a corkscrew was a problem, and someone had to enlist the help of a patron-derelict to get the bottle open. \r\n\r\nI was nice to the bartender, but some of the other patrons weren't.  This was NOT your typical gay bar.  A collection of aging misfits at the end of the bar were making all sorts of comments to the bartender....comments that weren't funny, weren't nice, and bordered on psychological sadism. The bartender was clearly upset, and the patrons seemed to take an eerie satisfaction in this.  Two stools down towards the door, a couple more crusty drifters  were eyeballing the two of us.  One was flashing us a dated \"Hey babe, my place or yours\" smile, while the other looked like a connection for anything from a  .45 automatic to a dime-bag of China White.\r\n\r\nI've been in quite a few dive bars during my time, and I don't say this about too many of them....this one creeped me out.  It didn't feel dangerous...but it had an *extremely* bad vibe about it.  There was seediness without charm....dysfunction without humor....and bad grunginess without a sense of tradition or history.  Even though it was daytime, I expected something along the lines of a \"Trannyshack\" type crowd where a drag queen would share her secrets of controlling facial hair, making a size 14 dress fit someone with a 34 inch waist, and the best places to find a set of mens size 11 pumps.  Instead, we found a dead-end alley of urban decay, a shallow trench of mental anguish  in which we were unwilling to participate, and anxious to leave...\r\n\r\nHidden Charm within the Tenderloin?

I was thoroughly impressed, especially with the \"lady\" who is pushing 70. Many of these lovely \"women\" are great dancers, and their costumes are definitely fabulous. They are really nice, too! Gina LaDivina said I had \"lovely B/Cs\". It was such a nice compliment, especially coming from a woman with breasts as nice as hers. Check out Emily's review for some good tips, such as calling ahead for a table, and how to use the bathroom (at Aunt Charlie's, not in general).\n\nMy husband and Emily's fiance (Jac C.) are both straight and extremely manly, and they loved the show, too. My husband was a wee bit skeptical, but he ended up being very impressed with the show-woman-ship and the costumes. He said he would definitely be interested in going again. A few of the \"girls\" were giving him the eye, which I liked. I like it when another woman compliments my cute shoes, so why not my cute husband? (But, it has to be in a similar way, e.g. you could ask me where I got my shoes or tell me how adorable/sexy/versatile they are, but you wouldn't ask if you could make out with them sometime, and if you knew me, you certainly would not ask to borrow them.)\n\nI plan to return with my mother and Emily J. and her mother for a mother night.\n\nMinus half a star for the obnoxious girls who asked if they could squeeze in next to me, then sat down before I could say no, and then blocked my view.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-23", "description": "I love, love, LOVE Aunt Charlie's.  It is one of my favorite bars, not only in San Francisco, but anywhere.  Yes, it's a dive bar.  That is part of it's charm.  You can get cheap, stiff drinks and sit at the bar or high top cocktail table, grab some popcorn and shoot the shit with a friend, talk to the bartender or just let your mind wander.  The weekend drag shows are an interesting mix of old-skool queens, members of the Imperial Court and gorgeous radical faerie phenoms like Jupiter.  \n\nThursday nights are the province of DJ Bus Station John's long-running Tubesteak Connection (now in its 6th year).  Celebrating and reviving \"bath house disco,\" Bus Station plays little known gems that were all the rage in the underground disco scene of the 1970's but have been largely eclipsed by played out disco tunes by crossover stars like Donna Summer.  Moreover, his party celebrates a time before the internet and other forms of alienating communication, a time when you had to leave the comfort of your home to meet people.  Tubesteak invites you to get sweaty, get on the cramped dance floor and let the music move you.  \n\nIn response to Aaron T's one-star review, of Aunt Charlie's based on his visit to Tubesteak... Well, what do you say in response to such a narrow-minded perspective?  The ban on cell phones is - as far as I know - Bus Station John's policy (not the bar's), and it is specifically an attempt to keep some aspect of life and culture free from the double-edged, ubiquitous edge of non-stop social networking.  The party is something Bus Station John demands that you be PRESENT for.  I have spent plenty of time outside the bar, and it's only dangerous if you're a sophomoric douche bag who thinks the world should totally accede to his privileged expectations.  Tubesteak and Aunt Charlie's welcome a wide variety of people, but if you want to be coddled then stick to the Castro and SOMA bars you reference in your review.  You're right.  Tubesteak isn't for you, and you're not welcome.  And just because it's not your scene doesn't mean that you should wish it out of business.  \n\nLike the performance artist Penny Arcade says... \"People used to come to New York to reinvent themselves.  Now they want New York to be like where they come from.\"  You're in an effing CITY man... the diversity is part of the dynamism of urban life.  You don't have to like it, but don't condemn it just because it's not your thing.  Your opinion reeks of entitlement, narrow thinking and a sheltered life.  Penny has also observed that in the battle between New York and San Francisco, SF won.  Somehow a bohemian culture has managed to weather the dot-com boom and that in San Francisco there still manages to be pockets of thriving underground culture.  That is something to be celebrated.", "author": "Earl D."}

Yeah, Aunt Charlie's is in a bit of a rough area in the Tenderloin, but that's part of the charm!  When we walked in, several of the locals, kindly showed us where the best seats for the show were.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-01-20", "description": "Nestled grimily on a block that is Genuinely Sketch, Aunt Charlie's Lounge warmly opens its door to all who stumble in. Dimly lit to the point of squinting even in daylight, once your eyes adjust, you'll discover that you've entered a narrow railroad car of a space. A metaphysical layer of dust fondly rests on fixtures and furniture that have not been updated in decades. Yes, fellow lushes, this is a true dive bar. And with this neighborhood, one that actually smells less bad inside than outside the door. I can't believe I've been coming to this place for years now already. And each and everytime, from the patches of memory left preserved post-binge, I've always had a colorful good time.\n\nThe main man behind the bar is Joe: a grizzled, gravelly-voiced sweetheart, with a shock of white/gray hair. Joe pours my vodka crans strong. (The cranberry juice is just an obligatory cough of an afterthought into the glass.) Needless to say, the drinks are not only blindingly stiff: they are cheap cheap cheap. I especially like coming here after work, when it's relatively quiet and sparsely populated. And despite the occasional whiff of desperation from the tragic-appearing crowd of elderly gay men who like their cheap daytime booze, there is still a vibe of fun chattiness. Without a doubt, Joe goes out of his way in decorating the place for holidays and special events, which makes it often cheerier. (The upside-down Christmas village - complete with lights and trees - that suspended from the low ceiling this past year was a terrifically elaborate enterprise.)\n\nThursday nights are time for the very popular \"Tubesteak Connection\", spun by DJ Bus Station John. Vintage gay porn magazine pages cover the length of the bar. And since all objects seem to be a tad sticky at Aunt Charlie's, most every other surface as well. Curtains of glam album covers hang from above. Not only is he a genius at fleshing out the cruisy 70's/early 80's homo bathhouse era of electro-disco and funk, Bus Station John's pastiche flyer art is dead-on as well. Creatively executed and successfully in keeping with the overall 'retro urban manwhore' theme. Odd chestnuts playing on the tv screens might be \"Eyes of Laura Mars\", \"Body Rock\" or just your standard 'classic' porn flick. The bar demographic changes significantly, as the art fag thrift store crowd starts to pack the place. (It really doesn't get going til around 11:30-ish btw.) As the evening progresses and the well drinks take their toll, the vibe gets increasingly slutty and rowdy (in a good way).\n\nFriday and Saturday nights are the utterly fantastic \"Hot Boxxx Girls\" drag shows, hosted by the gracious Gina LaDivina (\"The $65,000 Silicone Wonder\"). If you at all cherish San Francisco for its often surreal gay glamour, you owe it to yourself to check it out. With a performance roster that often resembles former NFL players decked out in sloppy drag than your stereotypically glossed 'gender illusionists', these ladies work hard for those dollar bills. Squeezing their broad-shouldered way through the narrow path that separates the bar from the mirrored wall, they have ample opportunity to grope for the cash. Parts David Lynch, John Waters and genuine flawed professionalism, I die and go to heaven at some point during any show.\n\nI've actually turned on several of my (straight) coworkers to this place and they've fallen for it too. We try to schedule an \"Auntie's Outing\" every couple of months. It's a rally call we only periodically make - since there's no way any of us have ever set foot in this place without getting really really messy. It's also a great place to go to pre-Warfield show, if you wanna get your drink on (I'll say it again: cheap!) since it's right around the corner. With its melancholy regulars, riotous atmosphere - not to mention, community fundraising drives - it truly is that inviting neighborhood dive bar kinda place. Its location might probably scare off many folks from ever stepping in. Or returning. But selfishly, I'll keep it that way.", "author": "Sean C."}

I would go to this Tenderloin dive bar in the early afternoon with my laptop and work on articles over an Irish coffee, while older men chattered away at the bar as cooking shows played on their TV's. Then, after a disco nap, I'd return for one of their more \"underground\" nighttime events such as their Hot Boxxx Girls drag show, hosted by the magnificent Gina La Divina or their bathhouse disco night Tubesteak.  I can't even remember all the hipster clubs that came and went that I showed up at each week. It was a wild time, filled with electrifying music; wigs, boas and glitter; and incredibly stiff Tequila Sunrises, poured by Joe, one of the best bartenders ever.  I guess at some point I had come and gone (maybe because everyone else started going there or maybe I had already gotten my fill) and moved on to greener pastures.
