First burrito we had here was excellent, but just visited today and gave them not one but TWO attempts at a steak burrito and they blew it. First one had next to no meat in it (see pics), I brought to counter and she acknowledged the problem and had them remake it. \n\nSecond attempt was barely any better. Basically their \"steak\" burrito is essentially a bean and rice burrito with a little steak salsa. I was curious so I tore apart the second one and separated out the beef- it was about a salsa cup's worth of meat. And, it was seasoned terribly, tasted and felt close to shoe leather. Maybe 2pm customers get the leftovers from noon. \n\nWas really gung-ho on this place after our first visit, thankfully waited until a second visit to judge. If a $10 \"steak\" burrito only contains a quarter's worth of badly seasoned meat, might as well get an honest vegetarian burrito. Salsas here weren't very good either, though I liked the corn chips. \n\nSecond time is the last time here.", "author": "T J."}

Pasilla is one of those restaurants where if they were located almost anywhere else, nobody would eat there. In the FiDi, now that El Faro has closed , there's almost no other Mexican fare. After my meal today though I'm definitely walking a couple blocks further to Chipotle for my Americanized sterilized tacos. \n\nThere's this guy who always works at the register, he acts very bothered by all of the customers no matter how polite I am to him, he never smiles or talks politely to me, no eye contact, leaning on the counter like he can't stand his job. Today, even though it was the same degree of busy as it usually is during lunch- less than 5 minute line wait and less than 5 minute food wait, he was SCREAMING at the top of his lungs the order numbers and then what the order was, \"NUMBER 135!!!!!! THREE CHICKEN TACOS WITH NO CHEESE AND CHIPS AND SALSA!!!!! 135!!! 135!!!!! NUMBER 136 PASILLA BOWL WITH EXTRA SOUR CREEEEAAAMMMM!!!!!!!!\" So loud that I wanted to plug my ears. I have never seen him do that before and I have been in there when it was busier. \n\nAs for the food, it is ridiculous that Pasilla cannot package the tacos in a better way for to-go orders, I mean come on it's 2014! ;) they slop three tacos in a piece of parchment that gets all soggy and FUBAR then wrap the whole thing in foil with no regard for what's happening to the taco integrity inside the aluminum wrap. Then they toss that ball of \"have an effed up lunch\" in a tiny paper lunch bag that they charge u 10 cents for, cuz it would really mess up their profit margin to get decent bags.\n\nI can say that the fish tacos are good, they smelled a little extra fishy whn I got them but I didn't get sick- score! And I've had chicken pork and steal tacos that were decent. They offer soft corn, flour or crunchy tacos- they take us for fools by offering crunchy- a soft tortilla barely survives the abuse of their packaging, a crunchy taco might as well be put in the blender and poured in a glass. \n\nToday I got three tacos one chicken one steak and one pork. I took a bite of the pork, it tasted like the cooked it in water with not even a pinch of salt much less seasoning. So I moved on to the chicken, dry dry dry and just as flavorless, then I moved to the steak, a tiny bit better but still barely edible.\nSee my photo that shows their stupid packaging method and each taco having bites taken but not finished. That pic was right before they went dumpster diving. \n\nAnother tip- they have what I call \"fake chips\" which means they are Tostitos or some store bought crap-not cool, a taqueria or restaurant will never get 5 stars from me no matter how good if they have fake chips!! Those chips have to be ridiculously cheap to be more cost effective than tortillas and oil. \n\nWhatever Pasilla, get it together.", "author": "Emma H."}

There's minimal room to sit and they don't really have a good way of separating people waiting to order from people waiting for food, so it can feel cramped and chaotic during the lunch rush.\n- In the midst of the lunch rush, the staff was pretty bad about getting people their food. Orders were piling up on the counter and one guy was hyper-focused on taking someone's order, and couldn't take the single second necessary to call out a number. If he can't multitask, they should assign someone to handle distribution. One of the people in our group ended up standing there for 5 minutes just waiting without realizing her food had been sitting 2 feet away from her the whole time. 5 minutes is usually not a lot but in in a cramped, loud lunch place, it's an era.\n\nPros:\n+ The food here is GREAT. The portions are huge and delicious. \n+ They also have a great salsa bar with tons of little to-go cups, so you can load up on salsa and jicama salad to your heart's desire.\n+ Prices are really reasonable and you could easily have leftovers for a second day of lunch. \n\n Overall, I think it was worth the 10-minute walk from our office to grab lunch here, but I would want to come on a nice sunny day when I could take a long lunch and find an outdoor table in the neighborhood.", "author": "Rachel A."}

Finally, they generously pile on the lettuce, pico de gallo, and chicken. The grilled chicken is extremely flavorful and you really get the grill taste in every bite.

It was tasty, although not remarkably so, and not very spicy.  The one thing they do that bugs me is put lettuce on their burritos -- mixed with sour cream, it just gets soggy.  (Plus, I don't like lettuce on burritos. What's that about? It's not a salad or a sandwich.)  \n\nThe guy at the counter was super nice and helpful, though.  Not a bad experience overall -- will be back to try my other meat delivery options, on those days when I can settle into a nice relaxing mexi-food coma without worrying about passing out in a pesky meeting.", "author": "Rob W."}

From the looks of her chicken quesadilla, I wanted to go get one for myself today.\n\nI ordered the spicy chicken quesadilla $5.95 with a a side of guac $1.50...and got some of their jicama salsa at the bar.  Those who know me well know that I have a pretty large appetite for a girl my size.  I'm known to eat larger quantities of food than the men I date =)  Is that something to be proud of?  Not sure.  Well, I was full with just eating 2/3 of my meal.  I'd say it was pretty filling.\n\nThe quesadilla is packed with tasty chicken and wasn't super greasy as many typical Mexican places have a ton of.  I thought their style of quesadilla was on the healthier side...it also had cilantro, tomato and some other Mexican seasonings.  Unfortunately, they failed to include a little container of sour cream (which my co-worker seems to receive every time with her order of quesadilla [yeah, she ordered the same thing....two days in a row]).  The guac was so-so.  It was indeed fresh, but it wasn't anything special in taste.  \n\nI'd be back there to try their other items.  I really liked how the dishes I've seen them prepare appear to be on the healthier side.", "author": "Michelle N."}

Rice is prepared Spanish style, so it it is fairly tasty.\n- Chicken was tasty. Marinated and had a nice zing to it.\n- Guac was good to pretty good. No complaints.\n- Pinto beans - I think Chipotle cooks their Pintos with a bit of bacon which is what makes them so awesome. I don't think they attempt to replicate this feat here, so they are just ok.\n- Salsas: they do have a fresh salsa bar so that you can help yourself.

The 'hot' salsa was anything but, and we waited quite a while for a burrito despite the fact that the place was empty.  Probably would not go out of my way to try this place, but if you work nearby Kearney, have a burrito fixation, and have only a few bucks, I guess it's worth a try.", "author": "James S."}
