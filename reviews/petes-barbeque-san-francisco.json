There were only 5 tables (with 4 chairs each) inside their tight small restaurant, but you could smell the fragrant bbq aroma and actually see real ribs and chicken raw and cooked coming out of the oven!  \n\nI grabbed a combo dinner (1/4 chicken and spare ribs) which came with a baked potato with melted butter, a bread roll with butter, and a salad of your choice(macaroni, potato, bean, or lettuce/tomato).  I also bought 2 cans of coke.  The total came to nearly $19.  BRING CASH!!! it's all over their restaurant to BRING CASH ONLY!!  \n\nI'd say it was a bargain- I was in a food coma!! -  I hadn't eaten anything all morning but my tummy was full to the brim and I could barely get up and leave my table!! :-)  The chicken was sooooo tender and tasted great with the bbq sauce.  The 2 spare ribs were big and they were tender too with lots of meat and tasted just as well with the bbq sauce!!  The baked potato and salad were great with the meat.  If you're ever in the Mission or nearby 20th St/Mission St. and LOVE tender tasty BBQ, come to Pete's BBQ - you will NOT regret it!!  It's certainly a good alternative to burritos/tacos/enchiladas/quesadillas/pupusas in the Mission District.  And if you don't think there's room for you to sit down to eat, for sure, take out is the best way to eat it!!\n\nI didn't see a restroom but that's easily fixable.  Go across the street to Laundre at 2401 Mission St.(cafe in front, laundry in back), pay for a drink of coffee, tea, juice, etc. with your CC and you can use their restroom in back of their cafe.  You may have to ask for the restroom password number.  Laundre is very clean, very spacious with lots of comfortable chairs and sofas & tables and lots of space available and they have great iced cafe latte!!  They even have wi-fi for 2 hour period of time which seemed very slow to me but I was just there to drink their great iced cafe latte, use their bathroom, and hail an uber to my next destination :-)\n\nAs far as getting here, from BART, you can take the 14 Mission or 14R Mission or the 49 Van Ness at 24th St BART or 16th St BART since there's hardly any parking. Or take uber or lyft!!", "author": "Frugal C."}

The \"BBQ\" sauce they put on, was more like a salty BBQ-esque flavor rather than the sweeter sauce I'm used to. It was also quite cartilage heavy and don't as juicy and tender as I'd normally like.\n\nThe side items were like cafeteria food. The bread was super tough, and not even the ton of butter they put on it could help. The baked potato was fine, and it did benefit quite a bit from the slab of butter thrown on it, but it was nothing special. And the salad was drenched in their Italian like dressing, and was not all that great.\n\nOverall a big disappointment considering this place looked like it would be so good.", "author": "Tyler T."}

I think the best time to come is during standard meal hours, as the food is going to be fresher due to the demand.  \n\nI've probably been here about 4-5 times now. Only once would I say that the meal wasn't what I expected/hoped. Almost always opt for the dinner meal, which comes with a baked potato and bread roll in addition to the meat and salad selection. Honestly don't think I've finished it in one sitting, usually have some to save for another meal. \n\nThe first time I came here I was lucky enough to show up right when the ribs came out from being cooked. Delicious and fell right off the bone. \n\nMy only gripe is they aren't open on Sundays or past 7:30 but I respect that they respect their employees time. It's a shame because it's typically Sundays that I'm craving it!\n\nAlso not sure that I'd actually call this a BBQ joint, as only the ribs that I got felt like actually BBQ but the meat and meals are still tasty for what they are.", "author": "Rajeev S."}

Cafeteria style serving. Spaghetti (?!). Rotisserie chicken looks good, but... this place is not a BBQ place. The sauce is just the worst. Bland. Feels like it's the stuff at the bottom of a Spaghetti-Os can. Runny. No kick to speak of. Just awful. \n\nSides were ok, had a lame Mac side - some sort of weird chickpea based slaw? Bleh.

Even Austin's fabled Franklin BBQ had a two-night pop-up at Smokestack earlier this year that apparently made \"Soylent Green\" look like a country club dance. I guess it doesn't really matter because Pete's is not really a barbecue place despite the name because there's no smoker or rotating rotisserie rack that I could see. Everything's presented cafeteria-style like a Luby's, and frankly that ain't a bad thing if you're not picky about how you want your barbecue. It's solid, finger-sucking eatin' for sure, and I'm pretty sure that's Pete himself carving up the ribs at the beginning of the line.\n\nJamie W. and I had been hanging out at the revitalized north side of Dolores Park when we felt an urge for ribs but nothing that would force us to wait for hipsters to finish their plates. I've never tried Pete's before, but I figured this might do the trick on a Saturday evening where every other eatery was crawling with high-octane twenty-somethings. Pete's definitely doesn't attract them. The target customer base consists of large families who huddle around the chipped formica tables and large guys who order big bags of meat to go. Jamie and I both ordered the $10.79 Spare Rib Dinner where Pete chops up five ribs a plate and ladles on the not-quite barbecue sauce. We pushed our trays down the line where the ladies take over.\n\nWe each got a baked potato and a big roll with a scoop of butter. Too bad the roll was cold as the butter looked like wallpaper paste when we slathered it on. We each got our own side. Jamie got the bean salad, but I apparently felt I needed more taters since I went for a scoop of potato salad (photo: http://bit.ly/1K8NyTa). The ribs were decent enough and quite meaty, more than enough for the price if you ask me (photo: http://bit.ly/1NyAGM5). The baked potato was a little harder to dig into than I wanted, but it was nothing that a dollop of butter couldn't resolve, while the potato salad was Sunday picnic-good. We were surprised we secured a table since the big families were pretty territorial, but it all worked out. Like I said, it was finger-sucking good.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...not really barbecue in the smokehouse sense but a rib-sticking cafeteria for sure\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...chaos at dinner time, grab a seat the moment someone gets up\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...the staff knows what they're doing\nTOTAL - 3 stars...you better be hungry...and not all that picky", "author": "Ed U."}

The sauce (which to me is always BOSS!) is completely bland and uninspired tomato soup. Best to just go with the rotisserie chicken in my view and forget the sauce. There's no tang, smoke, or spice detectable in the flavor which should be a staple of traditional BBQ - at least coming from someone who grew up much of his life in bbq havens and having visited the great BBQ meccas of America (Memphis, Texas, Kansas City and St. Louis to name a few). The ribs looked almost steamed and not smoked or grilled. And the sides were likewise subpar - for example, the spaghetti (spaghetti?!!!!! In a bbq joint?!!!) looked straight out of a chef boy r dee can. Needless to say my entire family, despite our great anticipation, left the place somewhat crest-fallen and we had to console ourselves at a local tacqueria to feel better about our outing. \n\nI suppose to each his own but I gotta say Yelp reviews really let me down on this one.

I can't believe the place actually got a 90+ score from the health department, but that's what the sign says.   They did not let even customers use their bathroom.   Everything served cafeteria style, kind of like dorm food.  I ordered half a roast chicken.   It comes with two sides: a mandatory baked potato and a salad of your choice.   The chicken was unfortunately way overcooked and very dry, which is a common problem for roasting chicken.   It cost $10.50 which I thought was a little high given the neighborhood and the lack of decor and bathroom.   I have no desire to return.", "author": "Will T."}

Meat was tender and delicious. Came with a baked potato, a choice of salad, and a roll. I got cole slaw and paid for an extra side of potato salad, both of which were good.

This is also one of Lieutenant Mike Stone (Karl Malden...RIP!) and Inspector Steve Keller's (Michael Douglas) favorite place to eat on the show. I wish Yelp was around in the 1970's, so they can type up a review of the places they ate or investigate.\n\nWell, I have carried my dad's torch and took my daughter to this \"Old School\" Barbeque place for a early dinner. We split an order of the Chicken and Rib combo. For $10.99, you get a quarter of a Rottiserie-cooked Chicken (Leg and Thigh) four tender Pork Ribs, a side (we got potato-salad), baked potato, and a roll. All the meats and the Russet Potatoes are cooked in the rottiserie cooker and making the meats very delicate and tender. \n\nBut despite having friendly service and tasty meats, our potato salad was too watery with a soup-like texture. Also, they spread \"way\" too much butter on our baked potato and roll. The lady actually scooped the butter to our sides, like scooping Ice Cream to a cone. The amount of butter is over-exceedingly too much for us. We may enjoy butter, but save the butter for Paula Deen's show. \n\nCash only, ya'll!", "author": "Matt G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-20", "description": "In reviewing George's B.B.Q. on 24th recently I came across other reviewers who had stated similarities between George's and Pete's.  Since I liked George's I had to check out Pete's for myself.  \n\nThe first two things I noticed when I walked into Pete's Barbeque is its popularity and its old school diner d\u00e9cor.  The place was packed during a late weekday afternoon.  I'm not certain how long Pete's has been around but judging by its interior I'd have to guess it's been a long time.  The place just has a rundown feel to it with its faded walls, formica table tops, vinyl chairs and foot mouldings that are literally peeling off of the wall.  Don't look up on the ceiling because the black dust cobwebs that have adhered itself to the flourescent lights just might make you think twice before ordering your food to eat in.\n\nThe food spread looked nearly identical to George's with all of the hot rotisserie meats laid out, spaghetti with Polish sausages arranged across the top and pan after pan of chilled side salads for your choosing.  They have slices of cheesecakes and pies on individual plates displayed just like George's too.\n\nFor my initial visit to Pete's I duplicated my initial visit to George's by ordering the Roast Beef dinner served au jus.  The lady doing the carving asked me how I preferred my beef.  I told her I liked my beef medium then she proceeded to carve up some of the rarest slices I've come across.  She sliced the beef thin too, but she did take the time to trim away any excess fat.  It turned out to be a monster portion of rare and medium rare slices along with the buttered bake potato (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gKaBgL0FS7JBjBAKU69foA?select=V_0Az5S95lOlXrOsw6jdrw), roll and butter and the macaroni side salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gKaBgL0FS7JBjBAKU69foA?select=Dw_dChXZHfnh5YW66bWRjQ).  The pool of juice actually made the super thin slices of meat cold as I noticed hot steam from the beef during the carving process.  \n\nIn addition to being cold the beef was tough too.  I guess I should have expected that with some of the raw beef that was carved up.  The overly-buttered bake potato was very good as was the creamy macaroni salad which I liked a bit more than the one at George's because it was properly chilled. \n\nI returned for a second visit days later and ordered a Chicken dinner.  Pete's does very good rotisserie chicken too.  Tender, moist meat is encased under a crispy, flavorful skin.  I enjoyed the chicken much more than I did the roast beef.\n\nPete's menu doesn't offer pastrami, brisket or combination plates and his prices are slightly higher.  Since both Pete's and George's had hits and misses with their meats I'd rather stick to George's for a cleaner, less-crowded environment and lower prices.  Pete's does deserve a solid 3.5 stars however.  If you're a meat and potatoes type person like I am you probably can't go wrong at either restaurant.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

It really didn't have much flavor. The portions are large. I usually don't eat white bread but the roll seemed to be homemade and actually had texture and flavor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-27", "description": "A no frills place with friendly employees and solid food. We ordered 2 dinners, which was more than enough food for two people - one half chicken and one spare ribs. They each came with a baked potato and side dish, as well as a piece of dutch crunch bread (slathered with way more butter than necessary). We had the pasta salad and the potato salad, which exceeded my (low) expectations. They're both pretty bland but not at all bad - I thought the pasta was pretty far overcooked but the potatoes were nicely cooked and cut into little chunks. \n\nBut, that's not the reason you come here. Both types of meat were just excellently cooked. The chicken was succulent in all parts. The ribs were pretty fatty, but the meat itself was tender and tasty, especially on the crispy edges. The bbq sauce that can be slathered on everything was inoffensive but didn't add much. I liked my baked potato fine but wasn't as impressed with the drippings it had been roasted under as I expected to be.", "author": "Lisa K."}

Located in the heart of the mission. The area is literally infested with  Five 0 pigs literally riding on the backs of vehicles like it's Rosarito in full battle rattle. Parking is an unfixed female dog. Forcing you to drop about 4 bucks an hour, that's literally 16 quarters. in my book thats Ricockulous. If you park make sure you park within an eye's reach of your vehicle. Broken windshield glass in broad day is no stranger in this part of town, and can easily be a welcome to your beamer if you roll 30k and up. People are hungry out here and will not hesitate to feed off the overprivileged. \n\nPresentation and Service: On the outside it look fine i guess. A building with the resturaunts name heading the top. A big window with food turning in a rotisserie. Strange for a que joint but whateves. I walk in.  Food looks disgusting, and the place is devilishly filthy. one of the options is literally , I kid you not, spaghetti with full sausages just laying right on top of the noodles. And the noodles looked like they were just swimming in that pool of red sauce. completely unappetizing.  The servers handle the food with complete lack of care. Hairy armed men, without gloves handle your meat and chop it up on a bent tin tray filled in a shallow pool of orange colored juice. It almost wanted to make me want to gag. But i stayed strong.. I'm trying a new place.. I swallow my foreign disgust, and try to see why yelp's panties are so damp for this place that they had to give it 4 stars. The line is long and I'm waiting to take my order... when i finally get through to order The dude reveals very unfriendly, in the thickest of thick eastern European accents that it's \"KOSHUNLEY\" (cash only). I'm like wtf?  \nSo you tellin me.. that in 2014, in one of the most populated and recognized cities in America, on one of the most broad and traffic filled streets you don't accept plastic? once again.. whatevs.. I walk out and go across the street to this shady looking western uniony-type of store with an ATM that had a 2 dollar fee to use. Back in line waiting again and this time store workers are moving in crates full of stuff from a back of a van to the catery trays.. at first i'm like.. what are they doing. And then I pay attention.. It's food. .. ALREADY COOKED FOOD. they're taking already cooked food and chopping it up on the serving trays and giving it to people! THEN WHERE THE CRAP IS THE FOOD COMING FROM!??!  Are they just buying food from Costco and reserving it to people? Does that mean the rotisserie is only for show? Is it even on? Once again...  i'm gagging in my mouth... and swallowing my comfort.. \"i'm trying something new, I'm trying something new\" By the time we get the food the place is full of locals and isn't very large. there is no place to sit. It's a shame that the there is no outside seating either. they definitely have the sidewalk space. \n\nQuality: I order for two, half a chicken and ribs. a baked potato and some bread.. the bread and the potato aren't part of a deal you have to pay more for them.. They have this weird option of adding butter, but they do it for you.. you can't add the butter yourself. and they don't even spread it in your bread, they just pop a butter square in the center of it. Stale to boot. The potato they put in a plastic tin. by the time you open it there is a little pool of melted butter swirling around under the potato, yellow as piss. The chicken taste like a flavorless, grocery store rotisserie chicken you can pick up for under ten bucks. nothing special. and they give it to you in a little heater bag instead of a more practical box or container. The ribs are horrible. bland, and very chewy. I've actually had better Safeway ribs. nothing is tender.. The sauce is horrible. ANYONE can make better sauce than this.. Heed this warning if you deceid to go to this place anyways.. DO NOT INGEST THE SAUCE. It makes everything worse. \n\nOverall: If you want cancer, trichinella spiralis, bird flu, or food poisoning to some degree I highly recommend this place. That being said this place is disgusting. there is nothing barbeque about this place.  avoid at all costs. 1 Star. oh. and I did a little research. Everyone that gives this place 5 stars generally gives everything they review 5 stars.. Like everything is the best that ever had.. check their profiles.. Just people five staring everything.

For Yelpers who give high marks because of great childhood memories, might I remind them that children have horrible palates and prefer dishes like Kraft Mac & Cheese, Ellio's Pizza and Tyson Chicken Fingers.  I couldn't buy into the hype of Pete's, the food here is just ok.  A retro experience to remember, but nowhere near my top list of repeats in the Mission.\n\nRotisserie Chicken: Like most standard rotisserie chicken you'd find at supermarkets and restaurants.  The amazing differentiating factor is the warm BBQ sauce!  Love getting it on the side and dousing my tender chicken with it.  Not award winning, but leaps and bounds ahead of K.C. Masterpiece.  Comfort.\n\nRibs: Not a fan.  Very tough, like bad Chinatown spareribs.\n\nPotato: The surprising star of this joint!  The bottom half of this tater is full of crunchy fatty delight.  I'm content just eating the skin and the surrounding 1/4 inch of baked potato.   I think they get this way be sitting below the rotating chickens when cooking to catch all the drippings.  The metallic bottom and the greasy drippings must then have a light slow fry reaction.  The top half is unremarkable though.\n\nSpaghetti: Way softer than al dente.  The meat sauce reminded me of a school cafeteria.  Maybe a tad trailer, but decent when paired with the chicken.\n\nPasta Salad: Too soft pasta rounds in a mostly mayo sauce.

The reviews don't lie.\n\nI got the quarter chicken and ribs combo to go.  Why to go?  Partially because they don't have a bathroom, and I would much rather prefer not to leave a sticky mess on my hands after my meal.  \n\nI believe there were about 5 ribs.  The combo also came with your choice of salad and a baked potato.  They slather butter on your potato for you, so ask them not to if prefer to do it yourself.  For the salad, I chose macaroni.  The other two choices were cole slaw and potato salad.\n\nThe ribs were.. amazing.. but it was my first time so I don't really have anything to compare them to, but they were definitely better than meatless ribs!  I also didn't know they were going to be so fatty, but the fat can easily be removed.  The meat was very tender and slid off the bone.  Yumm.\n\nI thought the chicken was even better than the ribs, although it was VERY close.  The flavor was just right, and it was EXTREMELY juicy.   If I were to come to Pete's again, I wouldn't be able to choose between the ribs and chicken combo, or just the chicken.\n\nA baked potato is a baked potato, and the macaroni salad was okay.

Nothing more and nothing less. I was  accommodating when the server apologized that it was a little over a pound. No problem, I can handle that. Sauce? Yes, please. The rest of the offerings looked good, I'm told the chicken is excellent, but this trip was just abut the ribs. \nI made it home and was delighted with the moist, tender, meaty ribs. I can understand the comments about the sauce, but it is not bad at all. It is very mild, but very good nonetheless. Add a little cayenne if you want a kick. Reviews that say Pete's is not BBQ, don't know what BBQ is- regional. BBQ is different, the sauce is different depending on which part of the country. By that logic, a Memphis dude could say that Texas grills good meat but its not BBQ. Yeah, whatever, the ribs were so good, who cares?  I'd be proud to call Pete's SF Style BBQ! \nI am so happy I stopped in today and will definitely be back to try the other offerings.

You can have your meat with or without bbq sauce, I opted for sauce. The ribs were a little cold but still good, and the chicken was VERY tender. The sauce didn't really \"wow\" me though. \n\nFor $12, I walked out full and satisfied. They even acknowledged my exiting the place. They really need to offer some wet naps or something though.", "author": "Eyva Kid C."}

When you first walk in you are greeted with a delicious looking display of baked potatoes and meats, which tugs at your inner soul. Then you move down the line, 8th grade cafeteria style and tell the nice men in orange shirts (similar to county lock up gear, or hip hop clothing) what you want. They offer spaghetti here, and I went with that and some sausage. With a potato for good measure.\n\nThe portions are hefty, and at $7.25 I was filled to the top with a lot left over. Part of that was my stomach, and another part was the food itself. Greasy and slightly undercooked, my spaghetti was about 3rd grade science project level.

Couple minutes later a guy asked if he could sit with me. Sure, sit down.

He also recognized my lack of understanding and we just smiled at each other for the rest of the meal.\n\nHe had to work to get the meat off his ribs.

They use the freshest rolls and produce in their finished product. I have gone back many, many times and have ventured to try what they claim to have BBQ. I must say it's really good for what it is. It's not the traditional BBQ but done on the rotisserie...everything is done on the rotisserie and the juices flow from one meat down to the next, even the potatoes. I can't say that I have never tried anything that wasn't good.  Even the wife who's  a very picky eater likes the roast beef. Plus met the owner \"Pete \" and he's a very nice guy.  Once I didn't have enough cash since this place is cash only Pete told me to just pay him back next time I came in...who still does that? Needless to say I have done that and will continue to show my support of this awesome place. It's not much from the outside or even the inside but I must say the people are really nice and I have never had anything bad.

The roomie and I had previously walked by it quite a few times, but this Sunday was the day.  The day I would eat some ribs, their juicy juices dribbling down my chin and not getting into my facial hair as I had just shaved...  The day I would gnaw some rotisserie chicken bones... The day I would devour a baked potato the size of a blimp.  \n\nIt was that day.  True to my dreams, I ordered the ribs, got a blimp sized potato, and convinced my friend to order the chicken so I could gnaw the bones.  The flame's friend got the Turkey, which also seemed like a solid choice just from the looks of it.  As there was no free seating inside, we dragged everything to Dolores park, where in true hipster fashion we proceeded to eat.    \n\nMy ribs were tasty.  They were juicy, meaty, and the bbq sauce did not overpower their flavor, as sometimes can happen.  If I had just eaten the ribs the place would have gotten a four stars.  My blimp size potato, contrary to its adjective, was actually not full of air, but rather, was solid and filling, crispy and soft in all the right places.  Unfortunately, that was where the tastiness ended.  The rotisserie chicken tasted much like its Costco counterpart, which, my grandpas adoration aside, is just not that good.  The Turkey was even worse, ending up being super dry despite the sauce it was liberally covered with. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the ribs were yummie, and everything else is skippable.

For under $10 I got a BIG portion of pasta, a side and a soda. It also comes with bread and butter, but I didn't want any. Their version of spaghetti sort of tasted like bay leaf and something else I can't put my finger on - maybe a hint of cinnamon or nutmeg? I got a side of tomato and cucumber salad. It came dressed in  white vinegar and oil, with raw onions and specked with pepper. I enjoyed it, nothing fancy but very satisfying. \n\nSERVICE:\nThese guys know how to cut up meat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-23", "description": "I had the spare ribs dinner today.  Just over $10 for 3 big pork spare ribs, a baked potato, your choice of salad (macaroni, potato, 3-bean, others I didn't pay attention to), and a big buttered roll.  This review reflects that particular dish.\n\nThe reviews of Pete's BBQ have proven to me that most Yelpers have terrible taste.  I can't even fathom how anybody could call this the best BBQ they've ever eaten.\n\n1)  This is not BBQ.  The meat is not smoked.\n\n2)  The sauce is salty, anemic, and sad.\n\nThe texture of the ribs was good.  It could've used a little more time, but was sufficiently tender and moist.  Better than being overcooked and mushy (ribs are NOT supposed to \"fall off the bone\").\n\nThe rub tastes more or less like salt and pepper, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I could tell by the color that there's some other spice(s) in there, but the flavor didn't come through.\n\nThe baked potato was good, supplemented only by a big slab of butter.  The skin was seasoned and possibly lightly basted in the sorry sauce before baked, which gave it a bit of a gooey crus that I liked.  A bit of salt and pepper to taste and it was good eatin.  It's possible this was accidental as my friend's potato skin looked plain and dry.\n\nThe macaroni salad was a typical mayonnaise based concoction with a healthy dose of black pepper and a little chopped parsley.  Slightly sweet, but mostly mayo-ey.\n\nI liked the roll.  Soft and moist inside with a chewy crust.  Fairly substantial and not too light and pillowy or spongy.  It was like a good mini-sized sandwich roll.  Perfect for making a little sandwich out of the meat, in fact!\n\nOn taste alone I would give it 2.5 stars, but it is a lot of food for relatively little money that is certainly edible and can really hit the spot, so +1 star for that.  It's also very fast, cafeteria style service.  Good for lunch, if you don't have to go through the trouble of finding parking.\n\nDo not come here expecting soul-soothing, spirit-lifting, divine smoked 'que.  Do come here if you want something cheap, filling, meaty, and real (not processed, fast food).  I'm a discerning eater, but not picky so I'll probably be coming back here from time to time.", "author": "Eugene L."}

Then, there are frequently long lines. That must be because it's so good, right???  Well, the prices seem to be none too low, perhaps higher than the Chick N Coop. I paid over $4 for just two ribs.

If  hearing of my having a couple ribs as a snack floors you, congratulations, you'll find kindred spirits in the staff, whose reactions  (facial, verbal and activity)are a cross between if you said \"I'm a Martian, and I'm asking you to do rocket science\" and a most proper Victorian lady who has received a most improper suggestion, when you ask for anything individually, and not as part of the whole meal. (Maybe, they hire the mentally & emotionally challenged.) Also, I get similar reactions when I (heaven forbid) ask for them not to put mustard on my sandwich, or not to chop up my Polish sausage, which by the way, is flavorless. (Street kiosks actually sell some halfway decent Polish, they don't.) While the spaghetti at the Chick N Coop actually tastes fresh, and like it has some spices in it,  Pete's spaghetti is flavorless. I guess the chicken is as good as the next place, but it is no less expensive, for all the drawbacks of this place, and may be even more expensive.
