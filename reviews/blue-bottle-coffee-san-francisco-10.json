Blue bottle has been one of my favorites for the longest time and this location is a nice one! There's no seating or outlets/wifi for you to make yourself cozy, but it's in the ferry building! Such a beautiful location and the view of the bay bridge from the back is always nice. This is where I love taking visitors to. You get a beautiful view and you get to sip on some great coffee at the same time. \n\nI always go for the ice coffee here. Always high quality and it never disappoints. But really, try everything on their menu, it's all good. The only thing is that I tend to stay away from their cookies and things. It's alright, but not nearly as great as their coffees and it's pretty pricey too.", "author": "Julie L."}

However, through the years, with its expansion to other cities and with many other coffee roasters opening, I don't find them that great anymore.  My palate for my espresso may have change but I now realize I don't like sour espresso which is what I get from Blue Bottle Coffee!\n\nI prefer my espresso to be bold and smooth so we asked the cashier's recommendation and she said get the Hayes Valley Espresso.  Just for kicks, I also ordered the Single Origin Espresso to compare.  The Single Origin was too sour and the Hayes Valley Espresso was only just a bit better and less sour.\n\nIt seems like I only make it a habit of going to Blue Bottle Coffee when I am In San Francisco, not because it is good, but because of the nostalgia of what it used to mean to me and what I thought was good before.\n\nThe staff at this location also wasn't too nice when I asked all my questions.  They were short with me and expressionless.  I didn't appreciate it, especially when they are located in an area where there are tons of tourists!", "author": "Johnny N."}

I was forced to buy a cup of coffee and half a pound of beans. No, I'm just kidding. I wanted to make the purchase. The first time I went to a BB I believe I got a cold brew, and I recall it being really good. Today, I went with a regular drip coffee. I went with the cheaper option, and that was a very full bodies coffee! I had to add a good amount of creamer and simple syrup to help tame it down. That's usually a morning type brew, not a middle of the day! Lol. \n\nWhat I liked about this location is that it had 2 ordering locations. One in the main walkway and one off to the side, which basically no one was ordering from. So of course I went to that ordering location. I even had a chance to talk to the cashier for a bit to figure out what beverage I wanted before the next guest even walked up. \n\nI'll be back for more! I gotta work my way up to the $10 cup of drip coffee. Supposedly a rare bean!", "author": "Antonio L."}

It's hella good, but you pay for what you get: A quality coffee shop in the Ferry Building. Hey, I don't mind paying up for quality, but no chairs or tables or even an inside, instead an order counter and counter you may enjoy your drink. Of course, at the Ferry Building many spots to sit and enjoy. \n\nI'm cruising the waterfront and in the area so decide to drop by. It's my first time at Blue Bottle Coffee, I've had it before, but it was at a restaurant. I just recall it was happiness to my taste buds. I locate this location at the furthest left side of the building (if looking at the bay). I am enthusiastically greeted... I order a Latt\u00e9 and good vibes with that, please. The two barista's working were professional and cheery which is always a good thing to encounter. And before you know it.. \"Latt\u00e9 for Eric!\" \n\nMy Latt\u00e9 was a work of art and filled to the lip. First sip was all I needed to remind me how good Blue Bottle Coffee is. I walkout and find a bench facing the Bay Bridge - I sip and savor every sip and savor. Ahh a reminder how good coffee is when made perfect. I question myself is this the best Latt\u00e9 ever? That's hard to answer since I've had the best coffees worldwide, but just entertaining the question should indicate that it's pretty darn good! \n\nIn the end, I recommend Blue Bottle Coffee. You should try it at least twice and see if you consider it one of the best ever. It's up there. Just pay up. In fairness to Blue Bottle Coffee they do have actual coffee shops with cafe chairs throughout the city, but my experience was with this little one with pleasant baristas and zero chairs. Hey, grab a bench outside and share it with the city pigeons... hope it gives you super powers 'til the next time!", "author": "Eric R."}

They have enough of a reputation so that I knew I'd get a good cup of coffee.\n\nIt was almost frantically busy, but the order taker was someone at the top of his game. Two macchiatos in \"to-stay\" cups. My wife waited in the tiny seating area on the side, while I waited for my drinks.\n\n...And waited. Finally, the barista's assistant asked me if I was waiting for something, and, when I told her, she said they were already delivered to my wife out of sight through the side window. I fumed a bit at my wife, but realized I'd been the victim of very sloppy service. The cups were paper, not the china I asked for, and the barista had somehow assumed that the drinks were for the woman by the window. Fine coffee, but lukewarm in a soggy cup.\n\nIf all you serve is coffee, a few at a time, and make two mistakes in an order, I'd say there was a staffing problem.

While they have been expanding to SoCal, Blue Bottle Coffee is still incredibly well-known in SF. Their coffee is really good that it justifies the wait in line. \n\nTheir menu is pretty simple - I've only tried three things from Blue Bottle, and both I really enjoyed. Prices are also pretty decent considering the fact that you are paying for high quality coffee. I'm not a big coffee person, but I've been learning to enjoy it more as I become older. \n\nOut of all the drinks that I've tried, I definitely recommend the New Orleans cold brew if you are into smooth and not too sweet coffee. This drink was incredibly smooth and not too bitter yet not too sweet. I could really taste the quality of the ingredients that were used to make it. I've also tried both the cappuccino and the macchiato. I love how they always top off the drink with coffee art - definitely makes for a pretty Instagram picture. The macchiato is always a bit too bitter for my liking (but still - flavor is top quality), but the cappuccino is a favorite - subtle, not too overwhelming, and definitely hits the spot on a cold SF day. You can pretty much walk outside and enjoy the view with a cup of Blue Bottle Coffee in your hand. It's amazing! \n\nThe workers are super friendly and eager to help you out if you need a minute or two to decide. Drinks don't take too long to make, so hopefully you'll be in and out of line within ten minutes. \n\ntl;dr - A must try if you love coffee and decide to walk around the Marketplace.

What makes this even more special is the fact that they use Humphry Slocombe ice cream. The world has never seen a more delicious love child. The contrasting flavors, textures, and temperatures provided a much needed wake up call to our tastebuds. The sharp bitterness of the freshly pulled espresso shot was instantly tempered by the sweet floral vanilla ice cream. When fresh, the liquid espresso is best scooped up with a spoonful of solid ice cream, but after everything melts a bit, the slurry becomes the yummiest espresso drink ever.

There's a couple of dedicated blue bottle locations and some other retail places/cafes that'll serve it but this review is for the main location inside the ferry building(not the walk up outside facing Embarcadero.\n\nParking is typical for SF which means that you'll be coming here by some way which does not involve driving. The good news here is that the ferry building is kind of a hub for non car transportation options. There's literally a dozen ways to get here that do not involve driving. \n\nThe coffee products here are splendid perfection. The drip coffee is magnificent, and the espresso is the best I've had in America. Ditto for the latte's. The pastries are also extraordinarily tasty. To summarize pretty much anything you order here will be awesome.\n\nNow for the slightly negative news. There is always a line here. It's not always very organized. Upon occasion people who really should know better will just run up and grab whatever coffee is yelled out regardless of what they ordered. That's happened twice to me, and I regret to say I was less then gracious when it occurred the second time. the staff are really awesome, and another coffee was made w/o issue from the staff both for me, and the other guy who came back to complain that he didn't order a latte. Typically the line in front is for people who are not in a hurry, want a pastry/food option, or don't really know what they want.\n\nThere is another way to get coffee in a flash and bypass that line however. Around the corner-the one on the way to the ocean facing exit and bathrooms-there is a little walk up window for basic orders.This is not to be confused with the walk up in another part of the building, this one is attached to the main cafe. Perfect for an espresso to go, or a coffee and a danish. This window has much much less of a line, and serves the same coffee. There is no menu board so you need to know what you want. Serving time tends to be quicker as well, but if you need to take the selfie to prove you were here do it with the main front in the background as the walk up counter is not as an attractive setting.\n\nNot the most cost effective option as just coffee and a sweet can run close to ten bucks, depending on what you order, but the quality is much better then average.", "author": "Steven W."}

Oh and I only drink black/plain coffee - hot or cold.\n\nTheir coffee (drip) of the day only offered things with citrus note and i know that's probably a more hipster thing to drink, but I just can't. So, i opted to get an americano. It was strong - a good pull, i guess. But i didn't think it was amazing. It was alright. Wasn't bad at all - but with all the hype, i expected it to be mouth dropping, knee weakening, wow good. I think i had that experience when i had intelligentia (i remember cursing a bit under my breath at the price for a tiny cup of americano - then the first sip took away all my shock and anger about the price).

In order to avoid feeling broke and diabetic, I would recommend getting ONE item at any one visit.\n\nIf you have not picked up the sarcasm in my reviews yet, no I am neither broke nor diabetic, everything is quite pricey and sweet.  I can't assess the coffee quality because it was masked by the predominant and scrumptious TCHO chocolate, but from the caffeine jolt it was decent.  Even though the caramelization was predominant and scrumptious, it did not fully mask the waffle, which was thick, fresh, and masterfully tuned to a crispiness-to-softness ratio.\n\nThe ambiance is exactly what you would expect for a popular shop at the ferry building: impossibly long lines, a tiny bar seating area with tiny table space, hipster-looking coffee brewing equipment, and a mixture of an authentic SF ambiance (where locals spend $$$ on fancy coffee) with an overhanging touristy vibe (where tourists spend $$$ on fancy coffee).\n\nUseless anecdote: I came here on a weekday morning with my dSLR hoping to get artsy shots (the reason I ordered the waffle and the mocha against my health-conscious judgment).  I even managed to snag one of the rare coveted seating spots at the coffee bar!  Unfortunately the fire alarm randomly went off in the ferry building so I had to use plastic Starbucks tables as my backdrop instead of the wooden Blue Bottle tables.

In San Francisco for an afternoon, I stopped by their Ferry Building location for a sample. Bracing myself for long lines, my timing was serendipitous, because there were only a few people in front of me (not long thereafter the hordes returned!).\n\nBlue Bottle's menu is spartan to say the least. No need to worry about in-the-know names for small, medium and large - at Blue Bottle one-size-fits-all.  Prices are reasonable. \n\nI'm an iced coffee fan, so I was looking forward to trying their New Orleans Iced Coffee, which a lot of people rave about.  I ordered that and a waffle, another yelp recommendation. I stood and waited for my order; this is essentially a coffee bar, very small,  no tables, and only five stools next to a short counter in front.\n\nThe iced coffee came right away, the waffle shortly thereafter. A few sips of the New Orleans and I quickly realized it was not what I expected. The website describes it as \"sweet, creamy\", so I'm thinking something like Philz's Iced Mint Mojito. But only a black coffee drinker could describe this as \"sweet\" - if there was any sweetness it was not easy to detect. I thought about adding some Splenda (heresy, I know, but I had some in my pack), but there were no stirrers (not green?). Maybe a knife? There were two silverware slots, one for clean, the other \"used\" (plastic utensils also not green I guess).  But I had visions of a rushed customer putting their utensils in the wrong slot, a less than appetizing thought.  I drank the coffee as is.\n\nThe waffle had a very subtle sweetness, bordering on plain.  Not sure if there are optional toppings available - didn't see any signs to that effect,  I forgot to ask, and no one volunteered anything.  The waffle wasn't bad, and helped offset the coffee taste for me, but it was like eating pancakes without syrup.\n\nBlue Bottle appears geared for coffee purists, and they serve this market well.  But if you have any kind of a sweet tooth in your coffee tastes, you may be disappointed here.  Perhaps the Caffe Mocha is more \"sweet\", but even if that's the case, Blue Bottle's flavored coffee choices are much more limited than many other coffee shops.", "author": "David F."}

I don't mind the aromas and flavors of coffee, but I'd much rather have iced tea instead. \n\nWith that said, I was absolutely amazed at how awesome Blue Bottle's New Orleans iced coffee was. I was able to have it nearly every single day, for about a week, for breakfast after getting off the Larkspur ferry and looked forward to it every single time.\n\nWith that said, the lines are very long and the service is a bit slow. But then again the reason the line is so long is because it's so good. I'm definitely a fan and can only hope that this small chain expands into Boston at some point in my lifetime so I can get more of that delicious drink.\n\nAs far as service goes, they're friendly and pretty quick. The stand itself doesn't offer much besides coffee and a few coffee-themed knick knacks. There's a few pastries available but nothing that great or worthwhile. There's no seating on the premise either, but you should be able to snag a spot around the Ferry Building if you walk around.", "author": "Jeremy K."}

This is just 20 feet from the main line but a lot of people don't notice it.

I recently made a trip to SF to eat at Hog Island and after my meal, I decided that it was time for me to try Blue Bottle since I've walked past it so many times.

I narrowed it down to either the Affogato or New Orleans iced coffee. \n\nWhen it was my turn to order, I asked the cashier which one she recommended and she said both are really good and popular and then she proceeded to tell me that the New Orleans iced coffee was already pre-brewed. After she said that, I caught myself wondering \"How good can pre-brewed coffee be? Seems less fresh.. But then again I'm not a coffee expert nor do I drink it religiously so I guess I will have to see what the hype is about.\" I decided to go with the New Orleans iced coffee instead of the Affogato (espresso over ice cream) since my friend and I were already going to grab ice cream from Humphry Slocombe after. Since the New Orleans iced coffee is pre-brewed, my drink was ready by the time I finished paying. I took a sip of it, not expecting much, and WOW it blew me away!!! It was the perfect blend of creaminess and smoothness and had no hint of the bitterness of coffee that I don't like. \n\nI'll definitely be stopping to get Blue Bottle every time I come visit SF.

After two visits to BB, I'm thinking that list writer doesn't get out too much. Not that it's bad coffee, oh no. In fact, it's great. But is it really worth going outta your way for?\n\nThe sexy Yelp n00b (Ms. SYN) I was with, suggested we get one soy latte from both Blue Bottle, and one from Peet's to compare. The verdict? It's a good thing I don't work for consumer reports. After taste testing both, I had a hard time choosing which one is \"better\". They were different enough, with Peet's being stronger flavored & much hotter in temperature, while BB was more balanced and you could tell it was made with care. The Peet's latte looked like a hot mess when sitting next to the artfully crafted Blue Bottle cup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-bottle-coffee-co-san-francisco-8?select=9oC8_Fq3Nt6VVglqpLsOCg#w0MkmQpoPiWPnHOviXJ1Tg If that's worth paying an extra .20 cents, I can't blame you. In fact, I would choose Blue Bottle for the simple fact that they don't charge extra for soy. It's a flat $3.75 for a latte. Even if they are more expensive overall, it's the principal. At least if I'm getting robbed for my caffeine addiction, so is everyone else.\n\nMy only complaint about Blue Bottle would be consistency. Ms. SYN & I had been here once before, and we both remember it being a better cup 'o Joe. Then again, that time was a drizzly SF night around Christmas time so maybe it was just the nostalgia of the moment uplifting the entire experience. However, I can see how things could get a little wonky with the barista cranking out shot after shot for the ceaseless line of tourists. \n\npro tip: OK, more of a realization that I'm a total n00b.

I'm from Southern California so I asked someone I know from the Sacramento area who has been to SF a lot. He told me about Philz, Contraband, and Blue Bottle. I really just came here because there's one at the Ferry Building and we were nearby. \n\nMy brother and I ordered for us and his girlfriend who was waiting outside the Ferry building with our puppy. I almost couldn't decide what I wanted but me and my brother's girlfriend went with a mocha, and my brother got a black coffee (the Guatemala one?). I also got a double chocolate cookie. I didn't know what to expect because 1. I don't usually get mochas and 2. I'm more of a iced coffee girl (but I was really cold, so decided to go for a hot beverage).\n\nI was pretty impressed. We had waited maybe almost ten minutes for our drinks (there were a decent amount of people waiting for almost 6pm). They had given us one mocha and the black coffee, so we asked about our other mocha. I think the guy realized they had forgotten it or messed up because he looked a little surprised but said, \"Oh yeah that'll be right out!\" So I knew he was gonna do us right. I think I heard him say to one of the baristas to \"fluff that one up.\" I'm not sure if that's what he said, but he had given some special orders to her. I was excited to get my drink because from the reviews I saw they did a cute design (I've never gotten a coffee with a design), but I think because they were kinda backed up they weren't doing that, which made me sad when I got my normal drink with no cute design. When they had called us for our second mocha, I was happy to see the cute design so I think that's what his special orders were. It was one of those nice extra touches that make your experience that much better ya know?\n\nAs for the taste, my mocha was pretty good. It was like liquid dark chocolate coffee, which might not be for everyone. The one thing I could complain about is that it wasn't as hot as I would've liked so it got cold somewhat quick. My brother's black coffee was definitely hotter, but he said he really enjoyed his too. Oh also, the cookie was yummy! I'm not giving it a 5 star just because it wasn't the best coffee I've ever had, but still really good and I was impressed with their service for being pretty busy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-10", "description": "Well Blue Bottle is great, of course.  Today was my first visit to the Ferry Building location.  Three quick tips:\n\n1. There are two lines for this booth -- one in front of the booth and one off to the side, near the restrooms.  The second line seems to be less noticed than the first.  For example, I didn't realize it was there until I had finished my purchase.\n\n2. My purchase: it was an affogato made with a Humphry Slocombe honey-infused ice cream.  Great stuff!!  As far as I understand, the BBCC affogato is offered only at this location.\n\n3. Although most people get their drinks (and affogatos...) \"to go\" in paper, you can get glass or ceramic if you ask for it.  I got my affogato in a big white ceramic bowl with a metal spoon.  Oh, by the way, the affogato costs $6.02 (including tax) but features two generous scoops of ice cream and a double espresso.  It's definitely worth trying.\n\nOn this bright warm Friday in June, the Ferry Building was teeming with tourists and local office workers who were forming long lines in front of places like Gott's Roadside.  Those lines looked like they weren't moving very fast.  By contrast, BBCC did a good job of getting people served.  I probably didn't wait more than 10 minutes between my arrival at the booth and the delivery of my purchase.", "author": "Kenneth R."}

Maybe it's me not knowing what to look for as a self proclaimed non-coffee afficiando. But having a plain Starbucks hours before, I was hoping to have that \"ah ha\" moment. That one moment where I regret the consistent loading of my gold Starbucks card, or the rare times I chose Peet's, Philz, Coffee Bean, and Dutch Bros. But alas, that moment never came. Maybe Ritual or Sightglass will do it for me. \n\nBut the biggest issue I have it with my experience was surrounding the Liege Waffle. To preface, I had a tiny piece of this snack in the past and remember it quite fondly. Now was my chance to have my own. When I ordered it, the cashier responded that they no longer sold the waffle after 2PM. Please correct me if I did not see it, but there was no sign in sight that announced that fact. Couple that with the customer 2 ahead of me delightfully devouring his waffle, I was clearly confused at the cashier's \"we don't serve it anymore.\" Tell me you ran out. Tell me the waffle maker broke and you're burning every single one. Tell me you don't like me and like there other customer better.

Not bad, not bad at all.  I wanted this to be as \"blind\" as possible.  I didn't ask about the origin of the bean, or anything else.  I simply wanted to taste what they had to offer to see what the hoopla was all about.  So I simply ordered whatever they were offering - standard drip coffee of the day.  It came out as a medium roast with a decent body and minimal/slight acidity.  Not sour, not bitter.\n\nMind you, this was only one sampling of the multiple beans/blends/roasts that they have.\n\nI am more than willing to come back to try their other beans and roasts, since what I had was pretty decent.", "author": "Herman E."}

That's not real coffee,\" let me explain my evolutionary journey through Blue Bottle. Be warned, I may be the only San Franciscan that doesn't believe that this is the greatest coffee that money can buy.\n\nI have heard, more often than not, that Blue Bottle is the best coffee in San Francisco. Um, okay. All right. I'll play along. After being told this and seeing multiple pictures of the infamous latte art, I decided to finally give this place a try. I have gone twice and have had two different experiences, so listen up.\n\nThe first time I went, I had recently discovered the gem that is the Ferry Building. How have I lived here and not discovered it? I really don't know, but it was discovered late in the game. Once inside, I searched tirelessly for that sign that would lead me to the \"best coffee ever.\" Okay, found it! Now, I wait in line, but the line doesn't bother me, because I think I am in for the best caffeine experience of my life. Suddenly, I'm next and I didn't decide what I wanted... Uh-oh. Um, drip coffee sounds good, right? I mean, they make each cup individually, so what could go wrong?\n\nOh, it was wrong. I don't know if it was because I have been coffee-washed by Starbucks, but this simple, black coffee had an average taste-- not too flavorful and kind of, dare I say, stale? I had to find my Splenda (at Peet's-- shhh!), because, HEADS UP, they don't have artificial sweeteners (only raw and simple sugars for those coffee purists). I finished the cup of coffee (mainly because it was over $2 for about 16 ounces), but I left feeling deceived and empty. I thought I was about to have the most wonderfully caffeinated beverage of my 22-years of existence and... I didn't.\n\nThat being said, I kept wondering if I just had hit them on an off-day. Maybe if I got a latte? A mocha? Would that be different? Well, I went yesterday and, while I didn't have THE BEST coffee ever, I had a pretty good and aesthetically pleasing latte. I even Instagram'd it to prove that I went and actually enjoyed Blue Bottle. However, I could probably have bought the same exact thing at any other coffee shop. It was nothing special. It was... Just coffee.\n\nSo, in short, I would go with the handcrafted beverages rather than the drip coffee... Then again, maybe that's just me. Maybe the beans weren't burned enough for me.\n\nBack to Starbucks, with my Gold Card, I go.", "author": "Gabriela K."}

Some cafes can produce lattes that are as good, but not every barista they have on duty can do that and even the ones that are the best can't do it consistently.  There are alot of variables involved.  The machine has to be in top notch condition.  The grinder needs to be cleaned and calibrated.  The coffee needs to be very fresh, like roasted the same day or before fresh.  The milk has to be of the highest quality (and preferably whole).  The barista has to attempt to pull the \"God\" shot every single time.  That is exactly what Blue Bottle goes for, they go for perfection with every cup they give and it shows.

I know the relationship between SF and LA is shaky and fraught with rivalries (don't tell anyone in the City of Angels that I'm a diehard Giants fan and take pleasure in watches The Dodgers choke), but couldn't you have shown your fellow Californians some love before you sent your delicious coffee off to New York?

It was fine but I waited about 20-25 mins for it which didn't seem worth it. And the guy at the counter was fairly surly and really disinterested in helping; the busy holiday crowd probably did him in but tough shit really. But everything is pretty cheap which is nice.\n\nAlso, this isn't something I penalized for but it's worth mentioning that the coffee here follows the recent trends of over-extracting.

Blue Bottle is right across from Ciao Bella Gelato, which i also love.  There was a line to Blue Bottle but I didnt mind! \n\nI saw that they have the Affogato!

The ice cream was fluffy and sweet, but unlike the ones you get from Safeway or something.  The espresso itself is way too strong to drink.  It is  too bitter.

You don't go to Blue Bottle to stay awake, you go to Blue Bottle to get Blue Bottle and savor the rich warm aromatic coffee crack-y goodness, perhaps further enhanced by the crack-chocolate that is Recchiuti's. Mm mocha latte... How amazing is it that they have a Rechiutti's latte and Rechiutti's itself a few feet away? Perhaps they should consider a Recchiuti's salted caramel latte? I'm getting distracted. Affogato still wins though.\n\nWhat is an affogato? \n\nIt's 2 scoops of the amazingly decadent Humphrey Slocombe's bourbon ice cream, a shot of espresso, mixed with cornflakes. This might sound odd at first, but it's... crack. The bitterness and unique Blue Bottle flavor of the espresso plays off the perfect sweetness of the ice cream, and the corn flakes add an interesting yet wonderfully complimentary texture. Even when it melts it's still delicious. I always end up scraping the bowl. I've never felt it to be a rip off at $5.50, I only wish I could have it more often... \n\nI have brought as many of my friends as possible here, coffee lovers and non lovers alike, and they've always loved the affogato.

They still speak fondly of Blue Bottle.\n\nThis isn't to say the rest of their offerings aren't great. However this is one of the few Blue Bottle locations that offers an affogato, which should definitely be taken advantage of.

Pow!\n\nI find it sooooooooo delightfully interesting that I've been the brunt of many a date question and the obvious dumbfounded looks received on my end.  Why?  Because I can't really say no but I can't really say yes either.  This conundrum has put many phrases to the test, especially when they are coming from men.\n\nI have not reached that level yet.  You know, the level where the screen turns slightly fuzzy to let you know a checkpoint has been reached in Gears of War.  The level where accumulating vacation hours increase from the standard 8 hours to 10 hours based on tenure.  The level where a room rating jumps from a 2-star to 4-star AAA scale.  Getting charged $35 for ribs as opposed to the $3 McRib from McDs.    \n\nSo in saying, at least I know that whenever I'm out and about with my friend there are no checkpoints or levels to attain: he is the quality control when it comes to coffee and I've never been disappointed.  Today he mentioned Blue Bottle and although I'm not much of a convert to frou frou preparations, it was something different.  This location is Spartan in design, something I was much enthused about, pure black and modern embellishments.  The menu, the same.  Nothing more than coffee, tea, lattes and espresso drinks.  Don't expect anything fancy other than the paid privilege of watching your coffee drip into that little cup.\n\nIt was good coffee and we took it out to the benches on the other side and propped ourselves for a good two hours of conversation, advice and welcomed comments from an adept observer such as my friend.  Who has been able to get a date in with you?  What? That's what men are like nowadays?  Ah, I see.\n\nThen again, with good coffee and good friends, who needs a distraction?", "author": "Miika M."}

Being a farmer's market day, around 11:00 a.m., there was already a line of about 10 people; but I didn't mind because the line moved fairly quickly.  The location is fairly small, unlike their Mint St. location; there isn't any seating and it's more of a to-go place.  (They also sell some goodies/gear, including tote bags, coffee makers, etc).\n\nThe menu is pretty standard as a coffee shop, but what I really love about Blue Bottle is their New Orleans style Iced Coffee ($3.75).  It is really flavorful and very refreshing.  Plus, I like that this drink is made for you instantly, you don't have to wait, as with the drip coffee or latte (but even if you do have to wait for your drink, they never take more than a few minutes to make it, which is great.  They even add beautiful coffee art to the top of the drink.)  The New Orleans style Iced Coffee is about half coffee and half milk.  It's pretty easy to drink, even for a non-coffee drinker, in my opinion.  \n\nThis location also has a variety of baked goodies.  There is a case below the cash register counter, so you can't really see the options until you get to the register, but they have a lot of variety, and everything is fairly priced, at about the $2 range.  They have cookies, muffins, coffee cake, everything you would expect.  Another thing that I love about Blue Bottle is their waffle.  Made fresh when ordered, these waffles are flavorful, warm, and have a little bit of crisp to them.  There is some sort of caramelized/sugary glaze on top which makes the waffle a little bit sweet, and it goes great with coffee.  They serve it in an easy-to-hold, coffee filter, so you can eat it on the go.  All of my friends loved the waffle.\n\nOverall, I would suggest that every one try Blue Bottle if they get a chance.  I've always been impressed by the quality of the product, and the service.  They are quick, helpful, and take pride in the product that they serve.\n\nNotes:\n-They don't have tables/seating (but you'll probably want to walk around the ferry building anyway)\n-Try the waffle!", "author": "Samantha L."}

It's good coffee!  But hey, for those of you who don't like their coffee strong - this probably would not be the place.  As for me... I like my coffee strong so I am a fan!  Tried the drip coffee - each cup freshly brewed.  And my friend got the iced coffee.  I don't know what they put in the Iced Coffee but it was some good shiznats!

I will certainly append the review and post a follow up if I can muster up the courage to go out of my way, plop down my money and hope for the best.\n\nI've read about the place many times, perhaps my expectations were too high. Perhaps there was a conspiracy to try to pass off some half hearted drinks to us, thinking we were tourists or something, that must be it right? There's gotta be an explanation, all these BB lovers can't be wrong.\n\nGlands watering, tastebuds revved up with anticipation, I stepped up to the plate and asked the guy \"what drinks are a must have for a first timer?\" He said without hesitation, \"if you like mochas, you definitely should have one, or a latte\" say no more, that's what I want then. So we ordered accordingly.....\n\nMocha \n\nMe: took a sip...\"hmmmm....umm try this\"\nHer: \"Is this supposed to be a mocha?\"\nMe: \"umm it should be, that's what I ordered\"\nHer: \"is there actually coffee in it?\"\nMe: \"yeah, well, it has espresso in it\"\nHer: \"uhh well if there is it sure doesn't taste like it, can't really taste any chocolate and only a hint of coffee, this sucks\"\n\nLatte\n\nMe: took a sip...\"hmmmm....\"\nHer: \"Is this their latte?\"\nMe: \"yeah\"\nHer: \"ok if you say so, I don't see what the big deal is, in fact these are just not good at all, what a let down\"\n\nBottom line is there is 1000% more coffee flavor in Starbucks coffee ice cream than we could taste in OUR drinks. I was having severe buyers remorse and should have followed my instincts and ordered a drip coffee, which is what I'm going to order next time. A cup of redemption is in order, I hate to give poor reviews but I couldn't hold it in any longer.\n\nI want to like BB, it'll have to wait until next time.", "author": "William S."}

I'm not a coffee connoisseur (in fact, I used to hate coffee a few years ago), but you could taste the quality!\n\nThe line was pretty long and it doesn't move particularly fast, but there's another window on the other side of the main opening that had a shorter line (we later realized). It's definitely worth a try if you want some good coffee, and you'll likely walk a way a fan!\n\nNOTE: There's also a small little counter area you can sit at and drink your coffee out of a real cup (and not one of those to-go cups).

The history of coffee is meant to be a community experience of caring for and sharing the beauty of the bean, and they have unfortunately turned it into a hipster consumeristic idea with no care for the product.\n\nI first asked the cashier about the 'new orleans coffee' that everyone raves about, and he couldn't tell me anything about it except that people tend to like it.  I ordered a cappuccino, then my barista slapped down my cappuccino that had the thinnest layer of foam i've every seen.  There was no consideration to the traditional way of cappuccino of a clean foam top with a beautiful shot of espresso under.  This was a mess.  \n\nFrom someone who really appreciates a beautiful coffee experience, this had me truly disappointed.

Bryan works at this one - he's the charming cute brown guy in glasses (um, yeah - I'm brown and all ethnical, too) who sometimes is dressed pretty dapper as well. He'll definitely take the time to make your coffee right, yet he can keep that line moving all efficient like and still hold a long enough genuine conversation to charm a good tip out of your pocket. Don't let his perfect foam art fool you. Under that cute heart is coffee that will wake the dead, but not because it's insanely strong or bitter, but because nobody roasted and pulled coffee this good before Blue Bottle existed. If I have any say, I will make sure I am re-incarnated wherever BB is available.\n\nHaving said that, I don't think of myself as a coffee snob in that on any given day you might catch me drinking coffee that isn't shade-grown, organic, fair trade, single origin, locally roasted, or from a civet cat's butt; however, I know insanely good, addictive coffee when I taste it, and Blue Bottle is it. I have found that if I leave the city for a few days and especially end up in a place with bad coffee, one of the first places I go to when I get back is to have some palate cleansing BB coffee. \n\nOnly downsides of this location (minus half star) are the pastries are just ok in comparison to other places that serve BB, and while I'm usually a very patient person and lines don't really bug me (you can't rush good food, drinks, or coffee or sex, but I don't stand in line for that last one), standing in line with cranky people fiending for coffee, especially a line that sometimes gets disorganized on semi-busy to busy days has tried my patience. I've also had someone with a similar name try to steal my drip at the farmer's market cart.

I went to the restroom, looked at the pastries and cakes at Miette;  went over and bought bread at Acme, and perused the olive oil McEvoy ranch, and M was still in line, waiting.  Normally we don't do status lines, and certainly don't wait in long lines for something that is sold elsewhere in the area, in this case, within the building.\n\nFinally though, the coffee.\n\nI took two sips and was about to dump it in the gutter when M said to give it to him.  He then walked about, maybe twenty feet down the Embarcadero with two cups, sipping from one, before he did what I've only seen him do once, ever:  Dumped both cups, still full, into the gutter.\n\nBlue Bottle has to be one of the most over rated products in the Bay Area, possibly tied with Philz.   A light bodied coffee, it reminded me of the brown water my parents made from corporate tins, two of which were roasted just down the Embarcadero, in a different age.  The after taste, an astringent bitterness, stuck to my throat like that free sample of Starbucks Instant I also dumped.  \n\nNo thank you.   It may be trendy to stand in line for this sort of thing, but it's a lot like listening to your iPhone without ear pods:  You think it's cool, everyone over thirty thinks their dad's transistor radio had better sound.  This coffee tastes like canned coffee from the past, under roasted and bitter.\n\nBut don't listen to me, keep waiting, drink on...", "author": "Paul T."}

It's very unique - I appreciate the Heath ceramics for espresso demitasses that you don't see other places, and that they offer little found home espresso machines like The Ponte Vecchio lever.\n\nWith that said, I've found the espresso to be not quite as good as their other locations.

These drinks are always presented so nicely with designs drawn on the top with the foam. I've seen a few variations of leaves and sometimes hearts.

They use Tcho semi sweet chocolate which makes the it not as sweet, and I love it. I don't feel as bad drinking a mocha because I know this one isn't loaded with sugar. \n\nI've came here at different times during the day, but found that I have to wait in line just about everytime.

Its damn good, but then again, I make my coffee at home with a conical burr grinder and press, so is my life changed? Maybe.

It was so delicious. The affogato was served in a bowl so the ratio between ice cream sweetness and bitter coffee flavor can be adjusted according to how you eat it, which is convenient as well since some people serve it in a cup to have the ice cream melt into the espresso and the drink just gets sweeter over time. In this case, you could eat how you like it!

Why pour it out?!  I'll take the extra chocolaty goodness or just pour it back into the pitcher - it has not been contaminated in any way, why waste it??\n\nThen as the espresso is just at its crema stage (which everyone knows is the tastiest part of the espresso shot), she pulls the cup away - again, wasting a lot of espresso that continued to come out of the Espresso Pull.\n\nThe milk was not hot, not even warm, & I'd go so far as to say it was still cool...had to pop my Mocha in the microwave when I got to work\n\nThere's only 1 cup size (12 oz) & prices are way steep.  This could not be a daily ritual for me or I'd be bankrupt in no time flat.  W/ prices of $4.50 for the Mocha & another $4.50 for a small Brioche - of which I did not partake (think basic, average-sized cupcake), you'll still be hungry, thirsty & incompletely caffeinated.  Good thing I had my HUGE, honkin slab of delicious Apple Turnover at Acme for $2.80 instead!\n\nWhile not enough espresso to satisfy my morning requirements, I'd recommend coming here for an after lunch / after work / after dinner indulgence.

What're you going to get?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I need something warm.\"  That's what I said anyway.  After having sparkling wine and loads of oysters at Hog Island, my group and I went over to blue bottle.  Shivering, I read the menu and one friend agreed that we needed something warm.  We read the menu and came upon the affogato.  Espresso with ice cream?  Who thought of such a genius combination?  Forget logic, forget what I had just said.  This \"affogato\" sounded intriguing.  I HAD to investigate.\n\n\"Go figure you would want the most expensive thing on the menu,\" fourth person remarked.  IGNORED!\n\nAfter waiting about ten minutes (seriously, long wait), we reached the front, and I got to ask the barista if he recommended the affogato.  He said it was \"delicious.\"  Sold, total order: an iced coffee, a mocha, and TWO affogatos (one for same friend that said she needed something warm).\n\nWhen our order was delivered, the presentation wasn't the grandest, but all was compensated in flavor.  The affogatos came in paper bowls, two scoops of vanilla ice cream were popped in and rich espresso poured over them in front of our awe stricken eyes.  We grabbed spoons and took a dive.  The creamy ice cream balanced with the strong espresso danced upon our tongues, and as a coffee elitist, I was totally enchanted.  My co-affogato orderer took in a delighted breath after her first bite and we agreed with a nod that we had made the right decision.  \n\nWhile I put lids on the mocha and ice coffee, a stranger from the end of the line approached my friend and asked, \"What is that and where do I get it?\"  We were officially the envy of the line.\n\nWell, obviously, you get it right here, journal.

You will see BBC on your left hand side. \n\nThe space is small, yet the layout is open so you don't feel crowded. \n\nI ordered the soy latte. The barista asked if I wanted something else. I hate being asked that because I start questioning myself. \"do I want something else?\" \"should I get something else?\" \"are other people getting something else and am I going to be judged if I only get the latte?\" so I asked the barista if they had vegan pastries. He suggested the arborio rice cake. It was baked in it's own mini cardboard loaf pan. So cute! I loved that when the barista handed it to me, he had placed it inside a coffee filter. It was a clever little detail and the filter doubles as a napkin. \n\nI can see what all the hype is about. The latte was so smooth and slightly sweet. It was pretty much perfect. I appreciated that it was ready to drink since I don't like waiting for my drinks to cool down. \n\nThe arborio rice cake is unforgettable. I'm going to be telling my grandchildren about it- after the Alzheimer's kicks in this might be the only thing I'll tell them about. The cake is moist and sweet and firm but soft and perfectly cooked through. There are almonds in there too for a nice surprise (sorry for spoiling it for you). The best comparison I have is that it tastes like corn cake. Oh and there is a slight hint of lemon flavor in there too. \n\nSoy latte + vegan arborio rice cake was heavenly. \n\nOnly thing that didn't leave a good taste in my mouth was that the cashier and the barista were carrying on a conversation and were speaking in code.

Eleven ninjas standing by for security and the occasional \"joke of the day\" and conversation. So why would I still live in an apartment if I was a bazillionaire?

While the \"secret window line\" USED to be faster, as toursits assumed it was cash-only, this is no longer the case. AVOID THE WINDOW LINE unless there are only 2 people in line. It will always look shorter than the mainline, but as there is only one person doing every order and manning the cashier simultaneously, it is unbelievably slow. \n\n2. Therefore, always rely on the real line. No, it won't be fast, but it will be worth it, and it has one thing going for it: it's faster than the other line. However, BEWARE line cutters. Almost every time I have stood in the line I have witnessed people cutting - some have been completely shameless.

This place definitely did it for me, but I'm glad that it did! Essentially, you get two scoops of Humphrey Slocombe's Honey Ice Cream that gets topped with Blue Bottle's Espresso. It's so strange... as the Espresso meets the cold ice cream, it creates a barrier-like force field of deliciousness that surrounds it with each bite. Humphrey Slocombe's rich & creamy textured ice cream when paired with the Affogato is something out of this world! Don't be shy and scoop more of that Espresso from on the bottom to the top of your ice cream.... This... drink? Nah, BEAUTY... is something that you should try at least once when you come here!\n\nTheir New Orleans Iced Coffee has a rich, smooth taste, and shouldn't be taken lightly for an iced coffee.

Of course, it's because we entered right by the Blue Bottle Coffee Co.  I saw people sitting around and ordering their drinks, and my first thought was \"wow those are small cups\".  I'd become used to the larger drink sizes offered by most of the chain coffee shops.  Regardless, I wanted to give the place a try because a quick yelp check showed that there were lots of reviews.  \n\nThe first clue I got that the baristas here took coffee seriously was the care and effort they took in making just the drip coffee. Instead of asking who was ordering lattes, they asked who was in line to get drip coffee. Each cup is prepared individually with their own filter and grinds.  I got a regular latte, mainly because I wanted the cool latte art.\n\nWhen I got my drink (made with whole milk unless otherwise told), I was a little disappointed in the small cup. However, one sip and I didn't care. This was an AMAZING cup of coffee. Period. The latte was incredibly smooth; none of that burnt tasting crud you'd get at other coffee places.  The whole milk also made the entire drink extremely filling.  While drinking the latte, I was careful to not mar the design on the top because it was just so cute.  I also had some of the drip coffee which was very robust and rich.  The closest I've had to coffee like that is the French press coffee from Griddle Cafe in LA.\n\nOne latte and one drip coffee cost $6.", "author": "Janet P."}

A seriously long line. And the first question that pops in to your head is,\n\n\"How long is this line REALLY going to take?\"\n\nDon't you wish someone had some data on how long the line actually takes, given that you have 18 groups in front of you? Well, you data junkie, you supposedly cool-cat with a secret statistics fetish*, here's your satisfaction.\n\nI made it through the line last Saturday just after 8am. I took out my iPhone. Unlike the other people on their iPhones (if you are in line reading this on your iPhone---ahem---take a look around; you are in good company), I decided to do something useful for everyone. I busted out my stopwatch app.\n\nSo, without further ado, the wait time: on average, a group gets through the line every 1 minute and 21 seconds.  \n\nThis is the time from when a group arrives at the front of the line to when they walk away with the receipt. I've got 18 data points, and the standard deviation (oh, you nerds are getting excited now, aren't you) is 31.4 seconds.  \n\nSo, you want to know about how long it is going to take you to get through the line? Well, count the number of groups. I don't mean individuals; people usually order as a group, you keen observer of human nature. So take a minute (you'll have plenty of time) and see who is socializing, holding hands, making out, etc. These are groups. \n\nTake the number of groups and multiply it by 1.35. That is your approximate wait time on a Saturday morning, in minutes. If you can't do that in your head, your phone has a calculator---now is the time to use it.\n\nBut why not multiply by 1.21? Because that is wrong. Take a deep breath if you made this mistake---you haven't had your coffee yet---1.21 minutes is 1 minute and 13 seconds, not 1 minute and 21 seconds.\n\nA couple caveats.  First, they hadn't opened the secret window yet. I have no idea how this affects the wait time. Second, I've only timed the wait once and (obviously) they could have been particularly fast or slow that day. \n\nAs your financial advisor is fond of saying, past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\n(Oh, and for the record, the coffee is really good, and worth even a 30-minute wait. They lose 1/2 point because it isn't the best cup I've had and 1/2 point because of the ridiculous wait.)\n\n(*) 1 in 7 have it. You like that, don't you.", "author": "Mike M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-04", "description": "The Product: One of the best cups of coffee I've ever tasted, though not by much (a cafe in Seattle called Migliore's still has my heart); and yes, I've tried many different kinds of coffee. I take my coffee as it is handed to me (no cream, no sugar, or rarely a little soy). Blue Bottle's coffee has a variety of blends, and at this location you need to go to the side window for the wider coffee selection. I suggest tasting it black before putting in any milk, cream, or sugar.\n\nThe Venue: It's next to the ocean, so drinking your cup of coffee there, I think, changes the flavor. Sipping on coffee and breathing in the ocean air makes this coffee more an experience than just your afternoon caffeine. Beware of long lines and lack of \"cafe-style\" seating.\n\nOverall: Everything is great except there isn't really a place to sit and maybe read the paper. I understand Blue Bottle is a place where you grab your coffee and go on your lunch break, but if that's the philosophy, then why isn't the \"grabbing\" process expedited? If there were more seating, or if the serving process were faster than 10, 15, 20 minutes, then I'd give it 5 stars. Til then, it's a solid 4/5 stars.", "author": "Gun-Ik P."}

This review is NOT (really) about Blue Bottle's coffee (although I've had their iced coffee and regular Gibraltar and stuff-- all of which are good, but I'm not really one to judge).  No, this review is mainly about affogato, one of the items on the Blue Bottle menu that isn't strictly coffee.\n\nWhy am I not a coffee drinker?  Let's see if this story explains:  I had (stupidly) a latte at 4pm last week.  NOT a good idea.  I was wired until 3 am.  And because I'm used to waking at 7:30 am on a regular basis, my body woke me up after four hours of sleep, and I was a zombie the rest of the day.  In other words: I have zero caffeine tolerance.  \n\nSo what is this review about?  Because if not coffee, then what?\n\nAFFOGATO!\n\nTwo scoops of Humphrey Slocombe ice cream (Maple Sugar Pecan or something decadent like that) plus an espresso poured over it.  Can you say HEAVEN?  My old roommate from college was in town visiting, and I took her and our other high school friend (who lives in the area now) to have Blue Bottle.  Affogato-- do it.  If you don't drink coffee (like me), do it.  If you drink coffee.  Do it.  If you drink tea.  Do it.  Do it do it!  It's coffee ice cream, but . . . not.\n\nIt's really sweet, and the portion isn't huge, but because it's so sweet,  it's actually perfect as an after-meal dessert.", "author": "Jeanne Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-30", "description": "I was really excited to try Blue Bottle after seeing the great reviews on Yelp and from hearing great things about it from my friends. Last week, it was a beautiful day in SF and I got off work early, so I thought it was a perfect time to try it out. \n\nIt took me ~35 minutes to get my coffee, and 20-25 minutes of that time was waiting for them to make it after I ordered and paid. I waited so long because since it was my first time here I was thinking that it just might take longer here than other coffee places. I was in no rush to go anywhere so waiting didn't bother me. However, it was getting to be a really long wait and I noticed that it was me and another girl waiting about the same time, but multiple people that got there after us were getting their coffee. Eventually we decided to ask the barista about it in case our orders had been overlooked. When we asked we got a short response - \"Well that wasn't on my list\" um... Ok. And then he says \"Well I\"m suuure you have been waiting 25 minutes but it wasn't on my list. But I'll make your coffee anyways\". He made it feel like it was our fault for not having the coffee... how dare I ask for the coffee that I paid for and that I've been waiting for right? (by the way, I am not exaggerating the waiting time... I checked to see what time I checked in on foursquare, and the other girl checked what time she had made a call when we first started waiting...). I'm sure he deals with rude people all day long but that is not an excuse to be rude to us when they made a mistake...\n\nThe girl working the cash register was extremely nice the entire time and gave us a refund. If I only dealt with her, my review would be higher... I understand mistakes happen, and she dealt with it perfectly. Oh yeah, the coffee was good I guess.... honestly I was still kind of shocked at that point about how rude that guy was to us, so it didn't taste as good as it could have.... definitely was not worth the wait and experience.\n\nI would try Blue Bottle again, but I don't think I'll be going back to this location.", "author": "Alison B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-20", "description": "I've recently become a convert to Blue Bottle's coffee after Happy Girl Kitchen back at home in Pacific Grove started serving their drip coffee about six months ago now. I was thrilled to try Blue Bottle straight from the source when I was up in the city a couple weekends ago. \n\nAs I'd feared, there was quite a line to get coffee at this location--even with Blue Bottle's Saturday farmers market stand open outside, there was still a considerable wait for coffee. Between the farmers market crowds and the line of coffee-craving hipsters, Blue Bottle gets a little cramped. But it was definitely worth the crowds and the wait for a good, strong cup of coffee to keep me going through the afternoon.\n\nIt was a nice day, so I decided to get an iced coffee, choosing the New Orleans-style iced coffee to mix things up. The roasted chicories gave a subtle twist to a classic iced coffee. Sure, the iced coffee was a little pricey at $3.75 for a small cup, but it was worth every penny! It was a great pick-me-up for the afternoon ahead shopping the Ferry Building, then heading over to the Legion of Honor to check out their new Pulp Fashion exhibition. (Great exhibition, by the way!) I was tempted to order one of their Belgian waffles too, but considering we'd just had lunch a couple doors down at Sidekick, I simply didn't have room for anymore food.\n\nYes, some of the other Blue Bottle locations in the city are probably more conducive to grabbing a cup of coffee to go, especially considering the traffic on the waterfront on the weekends. But if you're already in the Ferry Building for lunch or farmers market, this Blue Bottle shop is mighty convenient for a great cup of coffee.", "author": "Raul N."}

Interestingly, nearly every 4- and 5-star reviewer here mentions the long lines and slow service - but still 4 or 5 stars? People, there's a better way! Or do we somehow stay attached to something because it is hard?\n\nMy girlfriend - a hospitality professional and emerging operations guru - diagnosed this swiftly yesterday. I quote: \n\n\"The place to order is too close to the place to pick up the coffee. Consequently, confused customers all gather in the same (too small) place. This is one thing they could (and should) learn from Starbucks (or Disney, for that matter).  \n\nThe other problem is that the \"barristas\" are too slow  - partly since\nthey often start running around to do other things, and partly since there is no truly efficient way to sequence the coffee orders: the manual order slips may be cute and retro, but they lack sequence numbers or times. \n\nAll of the above can easily be fixed if they use a straight counter and move people from order to pick-up, just like their neighbor ACME bread does. Instead, they're wasting space displaying retail items (which nobody buys because they are overpriced) in a dead corner.\"\n\nIn short, good operations support good service and a good customer experience.

For some reasons, I never had a chance to try their coffee until the other day.\n\nI'm a huge coffee lover. I travel miles for good coffee. I also do not mind standing in a long line for good coffee as long as I have enough time. Besides, the line wasn't really that bad on that day. I normally don't drink latte or anything that has lots of milk because I believe it kills the taste of good coffee. But what can I say? I'm a girl that likes cute stuff... I wanted to see a cute foamy heart floating in my coffee cup. So I ordered latte.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nFirst, the guy who was at the espresso machine forgot my order. I had enough time so I waited, waited, and waited. Nothing was happening. Meanwhile, everybody else was served and drinking their coffee. Uh.. hello?\n\nSo, I told him I'm still waiting for my latte. No apology. And he did a lousy job making it. How do I know that? It's because he was talking with his friend entire time and was not paying attention to my drink at all.\n\nAnd then, my latte finally came out. Sure, it did have the cute foamy heart I wanted. So I was thinking, \"well, at least it looks good, and if this tastes good, I could easily forget about the fact he forgot my order\".\n\nI knew they don't serve their beverages super hot. I knew it. But this latte was not even close to be considered as a \"hot beverage\". And hello? where is the espresso? I couldn't even taste it. It simply tasted like a coffee flavored lukewarm milk. It was too bland to taste anything distinguishable. \n\nWith all the expectation I had, what a disappointment it turned out to be. At least the guy who took my order, who was also running around to take care of the cashier and the drip coffee was very nice. I should have just ordered the drip coffee and I'm sure it would have tasted way better.\n\nI figure being a tourist spot, people who work at Ferry Building location probably have less expectation to meet their customers' satisfaction.

I go almost exclusively for the soy lattes and cappuccinos, but haven't been back as often nowadays because I'm too bushed after work and the lever machines are usually shut down by the time I drag my butt downtown.

I don't bother with the snacks or pastries as they're predictably overpriced and nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nI'm definitely in the minority in that I don't mind the long lines at all, but only because I'm a budding coffee geek myself and I spend that time observing the baristas' techniques from the extraction to the pour (I'm pretty decent at latte art but I don't hold a candle to these guys) as they unflappingly crank out drink after drink for the endless barrage of tourists. \n\nThe baristas aren't the friendliest sometimes, but that's probably from having to be endless workhorses that in turn doesn't allow them to interact with customers that much. I know the feeling; I used to work mornings at a Peet's and it was like an assembly line and not being able to really interact with guests sucked. Best to go in the evening when it's much slower and they're more relaxed if you're feeling particularly talkative. \n\nThe downside: They've since stopped using Sunrich soymilk - the best I've ever tasted - and switched over to the more \"meh\" Pacific (which Peet's uses). \n\nGrab a cap for yourself and then wander around the Ferry Building looking at all the wares that you can't afford.", "author": "Jon A."}

Sure, I'm lucky, healthy, happy, even content... but excited? REALLY excited? Meh.\n\nIt's even more depressing to admit that food is one of few things that provide excitement. My mind everyday: God, I'm bored- day full of stress- pay that parking ticket- hold mail for old apartment- worry about dog- don't forget to workout- muse about direction of life- fear I'm making the wrong choices at 24- contemplate running away to a foreign country- oh, wait, no, my dog couldn't come with me... what's for lunch?\n\nLunch?! Such a welcome and delightful thought! \n\nIt's along these lines that I love Blue Bottle. It may be absolutely NO different than any other cup of coffee; I'm happy to admit that. It's definitely too expensive. The pastries are okay, but $4.50 for brioche? Is it gold-filled? In general, Blue Bottle may absolutely be 98% hype.\n\nBut in a boring day full of rumination on the many worries of my life, Blue Bottle gives me something to look forward to. I can pretend it's special. When I start off my morning with Blue Bottle's New Orleans Iced Coffee or Drip, I can feel like maybe today IS special. Maybe there is something to be excited about, afterall. \n\nIf I'm paying $3-10 for an illusion- bring it on. \n\n\nBTW, the yogurt parfait is terrific, albeit expensive.

Other than that, it's a definite winner.  Blue Bottle serves of the best lattes I've ever had, hands down.  I've got an espresso machine at home, and I can only wish I had the equipment or the skills to create an espresso drink so frothy and rich.\n\nI've also been to the kiosk and the siphon station on Mint.  I've reviewed both, and while I thought they were alright, I think I like this location the most.  There are just a ton of other things to do while you're at the ferry building, and a blue bottle drink is the perfect compliment for a casual bay-side stroll.  What pushes Blue Bottle over the top is the fact that the espresso drinks here are virtually the same price you'd pay at Starbucks or Peets, only the quality is helluvalot better.\n\nAs my girlfriend and I made our way back to the parking lot after a fine morning at the ferry building, I found myself savoring every last frothy sip of our Blue Bottle latte.

The coffee then drips out of the filter and into a cup. Check out my photo below and you'll see what I mean.\n\nThe food:\n\nDrinks aren't that cheap in Blue Bottle. You still have to pay anywhere between $3-5 for a cup of coffee/espresso.\n\nLatte - The lattes are so beautiful.

I've refrained from writing about it, but today was the last straw. I went to the booth at the Tue Ferry Building Market and I asked for a Gibraltar. Then, I told him I'd be right back, as I'd run to get cash b/c I was in a hurry to get to a meeting. He refused to make the Gibraltar and told me I'd have to wait in line and start again. After I got the cash, I waited in line again. He saw me there. He ignored me the whole time. I waited for 20 minutes, and then, all my free time was finished, and I had to leave to get to a meeting.

I had heard they had built one here but had never seen it.  Amidst the crowds with their biobags bursting with peaches, blueberries and apricots I decided to brave the longish line.  I've braved the line at the BBC in Linden Alley on many occasion, so why not?\n\nIt only took about 15 minutes to get to the front and I made the mistake of ordering an ice coffee which had surprise dairy in it (is this what makes it New Orleans Style?  There was no trace of chicory in it at all, which is what I thought gave NOLA style coffee their distinctive taste).\n\nWith the mob of people behind me, I decided to pick and choose my battles wisely and accepted my cup o' cold coffee and milk and went on my way.  I'm just glad there were no residual after effects from the beverage.  I haven't had milk in anything since the beginning of this year. Yay for avoiding dairy fallout!\n\nWith the reappearance of coffee back into my life i am realizing I can no longer go el cheapo on the stuff.  I will admit it.

I tried to deal with it, but after two sips I had to go back and ask for them to please remake it as it was just not enjoyable.\n\nHere is where they started to lose me as a customer:  \n\nAs I was standing there waiting to ask for a new coffee a woman was standing next to me waiting for her drink and she asked me what I wanted to ask them.  I told her that my cappuccino was more of a latte and more importantly it was cold.  She told me that this has happened with her drinks 3 times so far and she is also disappointed in the new blue bottle.  NOT A GOOD START.\n\nHere is where they lost me as a customer, the guy who was there making the coffee, i did not get his name, if I did I would post it here, but he was kind of stand-offish.\n\nI pointed out that it was luke warm and that for a cappuccino there was very little foam and I would like a cappuccino and not a latte.  I asked him if he could remake it and his response to me was and I am not making this up.\n\"yeah, we make our coffees not hot and only luke warm here, I only steam the milk to 135, that way customers can drink it right down.\"\n\nwell, I personally like a hot cup of coffee, and so did the woman next to me.\n\nanyhow, he made me a new one, which was hot enough...but still NO FOAM...again just a latte.  if you want a latte, blue bottle Embarcadero may be a good bet for you, but be sure to ask for it hot.\n\nif I want a cappuccino I will go to Peet's instead from now on if I am in the Ferry Building.\n\nSorry Blue bottle.", "author": "Greg F."}

I'm pretty much over the line though now, especially on Saturday morning's at the Farmer's Market.  \n\nI like the Gibraltar in a glass if you have time to hang out for a bit (after the wait).  I always get my espresso drinks extra hot because I think that they are a little tepid for my taste.  The drip coffee is excellent but strong, so be prepared.  \n\nI swung by earlier today ( much better on weekdays at odd times as far as the line is concerned ) and just found out that they serve food for lunch now.

The residents of North Beach are burning fires to warm their hearths and the smell of wood smoke wafts around the pedestrians beckoning them to remember that it's fall.  I thought of the leaves changing back home in the South. All the reds, yellows, browns and pinks splattered across the mountain I grew up on. I thought of the pumpkin patches, plastic spiderwebs and the cool nights. The smell of rotting leaves mixed with fire is a scent I wish I could bottle and wear around my neck for the rest of my life. \n\nThe golden light and echoing sounds of the Ferry Building greeted me as I stepped through the doors. Blue Bottle Coffee Company's simple stall beckoned to me. I was so close to relief from the brisk outside breeze and the fix I desperately needed. Caffeine. Caffeine. Caffeine. I was vulnerable and willing like an alcoholic standing outside of the door to their favorite bar. \n\nI strolled up to the front of the line to a kind-faced employee. \"Do you have something called a Gibraltar?\" I asked. She nodded, \"Is that what you want?\" \"Yes.\" The counter girl scrawled my name on a small notebook with \"Gilly\" next to it. Even coffee cannot escape endearments.\n\nI listened to the violent sounds of the baristas as I waited for my undiscovered beverage. They hit the espresso handles against the rubber discard bin. They clinked together the coffee cups. They unapologetically cranked the screaming steam. They slammed the metal milk carafes on the hard granite.  The most succulent espresso drinks are born out of violence. \n\nA tall boy with dirty blonde hair called my name as he held a shot glass with the most beautiful, caramel-colored concoction. So this was Gilly. I watched as the liquid morphed down the sides of the cup leaving a layer of shiny foam on the top. It was almost too entrancing to drink. Almost.\n\nThe first hit of warm, bitter coffee hit the back of my tongue with an intoxicating punch. I'm not a black coffee person. I like sugar and cream. However, this luscious little drink could very well turn me to the dark side. It felt dangerous. Rich. Wrong. It was all the best parts of an affair in a glass.\n\nI felt a sense of longing for my second dose before the first was even finished. The last and most bitter sip slipped down my throat. It was good. It was gone. The coffee-stained  container looked betrayed, defiled and guilty. \n\nAs I walked away from the amber-lit interior of the Ferry Building, the dark delight lingered in my mouth and the pungent flavor of coffee rested contently on the back of my tongue. The Gibraltar's sinewy strength snaked its way into my bloodstream warming my body from the inside out. I felt Gilly as she gingerly coaxed my eyelids into opening and I thanked her for the gesture.

It was served iced, with milk, and contained a chicory flavor. It was rich, delicious, and enjoyable. I had a baked good (something involving liquor) that was so dense the moisture seeped though the to-go bag and onto my hand. \n\nWe did not stay, but I really had wanted to. The inside gives the vibe of being a white atmosphere that is modern traditional.

Plus it had a unique name, which I forgot to ask what it meant.\n\nNot knowing what to expect, the shop and the stores around it seemed to be getting ready to close up. Even though they seemed to be rather busy with cleaning, they still took my order. Not quite the most friendliest service but its nothing I should complain about. Their menu was very simple and and didn't carry a variety of drinks but their Mocha sound rather unique. I always love it when coffee shops make neat designs on top of the lattes and the one they gave me made me smile =]. The mocha was SOOO delicious and smooth. It was not extremely hot either so I was able to drink it right away.\n\nIf I ever come back to The Embarcadero, I will definitely stop by the Blue Bottle Coffee again. I only gave it a 4 star because they did not seem to be the most friendliest and charming baristas from what I am use to. Maybe the next time I come back I will get a better experience =].", "author": "Daniel L."}

I don't know if this is common, but my cup was the perfect temperature - I could drink it right away.  It tasted like good quality, very dark chocolate.  It wasn't very creamy or rich (fyi, in case that is your thing), but had a great flavor.

I love coffee, but if you've ever read my other reviews, you'll know that the overall picture is very important to me. \n\nI've been to several Blue Bottle locations and as an amateur connoisseur (with a little bit of coffee industry study under her belt), I do not see how the flavor of their coffee merits the wait time or price. Even their espresso drinks - which should be quick to make by nature - take forever to get. To be fair, I've had their drip, specialty iced, and cappuccinos. I will never have an espresso drink here again because it is ridiculous to do so when they hang their hat on drip coffee and when there is so much better to be had elsewhere. Their specialty iced coffee is inconsistent between locations and not worth the price. I've had their drip coffee, but it was ok. I do not think their method of brewing does anything for the flavor. It's a lot of show that promises a big finale but is very disappointing.\n\nI have not had the much commented about waffles, but I have had their pastries in different locations. Once again, very over priced for the quality and flavor. It makes me wonder if my fellow San Franciscans are just suckers for a high price tag and hot-spots. I'm not saying the coffee is bad, mind you. Just that it is not worth the ridiculous wait. \n\nFor those of you who drink espresso drinks, I would recommend Bao Necci in North Beach. They are masters of their craft and have a properly maintained machine - as evidenced by what you see in the bottom of your cup afterwards... few, if any grounds! In addition, their coffee is outstanding and is the closest to Italian coffee as any other place I've found. You don't have to wait 20 minutes, there are places to sit and the price is appropriate.", "author": "Maria Y."}

I come here with co workers for morning coffee and I've tried their lattes, drip coffee, cappuccino and mocha.  All of them are nicely strong and flavorful with nice creamy milk froth on top.  On product alone, this is a must taste.\n\nThe drawback is the wait.  The staff are very friendly but the service is sloooow.  Even when there are only 3 or 4 people in line, it can take 25 minutes to get your drinks.  The drinks are also often not very hot when served. \n\nSo the flavor is excellent, but BB loses one star for slow service and one for often serving lukewarm espresso.", "author": "Bryce M."}

It might be the best coffee I have ever had, although there was this one cup in NYC, but that's another story.  The 2 star, possibly 1 star comes from the service at the Ferry building outpost.

I will temper this with the fact that I have in fact received stellar service here before, probably 50% of the time.  It really just depends on who it is at the register.

You looked at me again, and you went on to another cup.  And when I finally got directly in front of your window, you said you were closed.  Um...  There was nobody in line after me; you really could have made an exception.  Or at the very lest, a \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you ten minutes ago when I first saw you in line that I am closed already.\"  Instead, you were very short with me, and I was extremely surprised by your curtness.

I've tried ordering New Orleans style iced coffee at places that serve Blue Bottle Coffee (like Fra\u00eeche in Palo Alto), but they don't  turn out even half as good. My parents both went with a caffe latte and they kept praising the smoothness of the coffee. One concern they had, however, was the fact that their coffees were lukewarm at most. The barista said the milk steamer wasn't working. If hot beverages are a must for you, make sure you check that the milk steamer is working when you get your beverage! Otherwise, you may be slightly disappointed.\n\nThis location seems to be centered around to-go orders. It's in the Ferry Building, so the setting isn't as relaxed and laid-back as the Mint Plaza location. There isn't as much seating either (just a few seats by the bar). Macchiatos can't be taken to-go, so keep that in mind as well.", "author": "Josh W."}

The macchiato is excellent, and on a warm day the New Orleans iced coffee is unbeatable.", "author": "Don N."}

It is the best damn coffee I have ever had in my life. \nI heard they make the coffee the night before and let it soak overnight with all the special ingredients and that's why it tastes so amazing. Trust me man when I say you have to order one, it will change your life!\" \n\nSo I ordered one and although it was good it did not change my life. \nI'm not the biggest coffee drinker so maybe an avid coffee drinker would like it a little more then I did. It was a little strong for my taste but when I added some raw sugar to it I thought it was good. It was about $3 dollars or so and I thought that was not too bad. \n\nRandom sane woman in line at Blue Bottle day 2 \n\n\"I love their mocha made with Rechutti chocolate, it is my drink of all time.\" \n\nSo I went back to BB the next day because I really wanted to love this place because of all the great reviews I read and because so many people told me I had to check it out. I decided to go with this sane woman's recommendation, and I'm so pleased I did. This mocha was phenomenal. It tasted like a melted down piece of dark chocolate. This was by far the best mocha I have ever had in my life. I also thought it was really cool how they make designs on the top of the drink, it was almost to pretty to drink. The mocha is not served as hot as other ones I have had but that didn't bother me at all. This drink was a little high priced ($4.50) but since it was so good, and because I won't get the chance to have one again any time soon I did not mind paying that price. If I lived in SF (which I hope will happen some day) I would probably only get one of these delicious high priced drinks once a week.", "author": "Craig R."}

Those stars went over to Peet's, which was about 50 yards away, got great coffees (mediums for $1.80, BTW), and sipped their coffees while watching the Blue Bottle line move ever so slowly, and they wondered, \"Why do humans love to queue up so much?\" They also thought, \"Hey, this Peet's is really good coffee.\"", "author": "Jesse C."}

Blue Bottle is rich.  Blue Bottle is coffee at its best.  \nI will say that I can do without the attitude that several locations have, but for coffee like that, I'll let it slide.\nMy all time favorite is a simple Latte.  I remember the exact day, years ago.  I ventured into Velo Rouge and ordered a Latte.  I thought it was weird that it only came in one size, but there was a pretty foamy leaf designed on top and the weirdness left me.  Instead, a strong, rich and bold flavor was introduced to me:  I don't know if I can go back to regular coffee again.  Starbucks who?  Something wonderfully dangerous happened...I became a coffee snob.  Ahhh...It was love at first sip!  \nYou simply can't mistake the distinct taste of quality Organic Coffee at the measly price of $3.50 per cup.  It's only \"measly\" if you love designer coffee :)\nToday, I tried the recommended Gibralter according to 7X7 as the 27th must eat or drink before you die at the Ferry Building.  Yes, it's worth having before you die...The two shots of the Hayes Valley Blend and milk gently poured over with a sweet heart-shaped design served in a Gibralter glass makes it a must to enjoy on Blue Bottle premises.  To Go?  No.  It wouldn't be a Gibralter!  Very good, a bit on the bitter side, but I loved it, nonetheless!  \nI had a vision of how awesome it would be to have a Gibralter served in bed, first thing in the morning...It would make definitely make my morning routine a lot more enjoyable!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

I had been eagerly awaiting its opening and was not at all disappointed. There was a line on the side open to the main hallway, but no one waiting at the window just around the corner. I got my usual latte and it was fast, cheap (I think maybe either accidentally or some sort of just about to close the window discount) and then I got to enjoy the beautiful sunshine outside while I drank up the yummy goodness. SF has a lot of good things going for it, but it really lacks a lot of really great coffee places. Happy to see there's hope yet!", "author": "Emily F."}

That's what latte or coffee drink should taste.

My poor mother, who only knew about mediocre coffee, Starbuck's style, was ruined.  Ruined by my high falooting friend's taste in coffee.  I hang around enough foodies to be exposed to amazing coffee.  Plus I was working across the street from the Ferry Building at the time so I was close to the coffee crack.  So I bring home a bag to my mother.  I smell the coffee.  I instantly realize, and recognize that if I was ever to become a coffee drinker and lover, this would have been my first and one true love.  Over the top?  I dunno.  My mother had one taste of this coffee and she immediately couldn't go back to any other coffee.  She reluctantly did start drinking other coffee when she ran out of the bag.  Her palate is ruined forever.  She can't go back.  It's all my fault really.  I was her supplier and I let her taste one time of the crack coffee.  She was hooked.", "author": "Mary Ann K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-06-07", "description": "The coffee at Blue Bottle is very good and beautifully designed, but it's more a coffee stand than a coffee shop. There are very few places to sit in the Ferry building around it, so most of the coffee has to be \"to go.\" This is fine for most, but I saw a man recently who was jostled and spilled his coffee, and they were so busy it took some time to even notice. When they did, they were good about cleaning up, but the servers seemed more sarcastic than helpful, and there was no effort to help the man replace the coffee, or even ask if he wanted to ordered a new cup.\n\nI know it's busy in the Embarcadero, and it is just coffee, but it was almost as if they couldn't be bothered.\n\nAs I said, the coffee's beautiful, but don't expect much more than that.", "author": "J K."}

So it is with disappointment that I give them 3 stars (this location in particular). Part of the pleasure in consuming a good cup of coffee for me is the excitement (or at least graciousness) that the purveyor has about the product. The people working here are purposefully lethargic, snap at innocent questions and are generally giving off the stink of snobbishness. The new Jack London Square Oakland location, recently opened, seems more friendly. So I'll try to stick with it... but not at the Ferry Bldg.", "author": "thats neat o."}

After waiting in the long 30min line I order a mocha and a latte for myself and my mother who was visiting from out of town.  Finally, I put in my order and the d!@khead who made our drinks, failed.  I took a sip of my mocha and it was luke warm at best and then I took a sip of my mothers latte which was piping hot like it should be.  No big deal I thought, I'll just have him warm it up.  So I go back to ask him if he would mind heating it up and his reply was, \"This isn't starbucks, we don't scald our coffee\". Clearly, I know how coffee should be prepared, I've been drinking it for 15 yrs and was once a barista!  I was so pissed and should have given him a piece of my mind, but I didn't want to make a scene in front of my mother.  Thus, hence forth, I shall NEVER drink BBC again!!!!", "author": "Mary W."}
