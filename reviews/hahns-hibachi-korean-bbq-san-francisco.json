{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-24", "description": "First impression- friendly service and squeaky clean bathrooms. Yikes, Ali Wong would not approve. But given the location, the customers are mainly non-Asians looking for Korean BBQ where you can get for KBBQ fix without needing to dry clean your entire outfit immediately after the meal. Hence they need to cater to the nice people/clean bathroom kinda crowd, which I definitely don't mind myself! Must admit, my expectations were low considering this place is called \"hibachi,\" which is a form of japanese (not korean) grilling that you can find in anywhere (unlike other forms of japanese grilling like yakitori, yakiniku, and binchotan). \n\nFOOD\nThe menu format is mostly bbq protein + rice + salad for a set price, but if you ask for banchan, they will bring you kimchi and lightly seasoned namul (probably a type of Korean). My friend got the pork bulgogi, which I found to be much too sweet and sauce-heavy but she liked it. \nI personally would not get kBBQ at a place that cooks it for you unless it comes on a hot sizzling stone plate. But if waiting in line at YakiniQ (Japantown) or traveling to the East Bay just to wait in line at any of the delicious \"all you can eat\" KBBQ spots in Oakland does not appeal to you, I'm sure Hahn's would be just fine. \n\nRather than risk being underwhelmed by the bbq, I opted for the traditional menu and got the \"sizzling\" dolsot (stone bowl) bibimbap. I was chock full of fresh Korean veggies and gogi. The gojuchang (spicy red pepper paste) was excessively mild though. \n\nALCOHOL\nSoju prices are relatively low at $9.95 for a bottle of chamisul rich, and $9.50ish for a large glass bottle of Hite or Sapporo. \n\nFood gets 3.5 stars, but the lack of lines considering its location on Polk, cheap alcohol prices, far-too-clean bathrooms, and nice people make it a 4. I will most definitely come back because despite the underwhelming menu, it's easy to find seats for a group, the experience is comfortable for those unaccustomed to Korean food, and the alcohol is cheaper than other spots in SF.", "author": "Christine K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-28", "description": "Marin, for a long time had a Hahn's Hibachi.  I never went there and then they closed and I regretted that.  It seemed the least I could do was support the only Korean joint in the county given how frequently I bemoan the lack of ethnic eats here.  Live and learn.\n\nSan Francisco doesn't have a lack of Korean joints but they do still have Hahn's and that right there seems sort of amazing.  I'm surprised that folks would go here over someplace more authentic but convenience might be a factor.  It was for me.  \n\nAfter a single visit I can report that Hahn's will fill you up without killing your wallet but the experience will feel most akin to fast food Korean both in ambiance and taste.  There was nothing wrong with my Sizzling Beef Bebimbop (sic, $11.95) but it also fell short of the more flavorful, authentic version I've had at, say, Manna (on Irving).  A Korean Beer accompaniment ($3.50) helped take me out of fast food territory but not by much.  \n\nI chuckled a bit reading some reviews which mention that Hahn's is not a good place for a date.  One yelper described it as \"starkly unromantic\" which is spot-on.  It also left me thinking \"plastic\",  perhaps owing to the furnishings.  So yeah, not a date place.  Don't even think about it.    \n\nHahn's fare brings to mind another chain Korean place, Sorabol, which is often found in food courts.  If the two were side-by-side I'd choose Sorabol over Hahn's every time but if this was my only option?  Well, it was my only option in Marin for quite a while and while it likely would've satisfied my Korean cravings I doubt it would've kept me out of SF, searching for flavors a bit more authentic.\n\nAnd:\n*  A \"Health Score\" of 71/100 is teetering a little too close to D+ range for my tastes.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Please take this review into consideration next time you contemplate giving Hahn's Hibachi your business.\n\nI've been to Hahn's Hibachi many times before without incident - but after yesterday's (05/03/14, ~5PM) experience, this business will NEVER earn another $1 of my hard earned money.  Here is what happened...(if you want the abridged version of this review, read the part below the line)\n\nMy friend and I were hungry so we both agreed to place a pick-up order over the phone.  My friend wanted the bibimbap, one of his favorites, so I placed the order for him.  This is the conversation that ensued over the phone with the gentlemen at Hahn's Hibachi:\n\nMe: \"Hello, can I please place an order for pickup?\"\nHahn's Hibachi Employee (HHE): \"Yes, what would you like?\"\nMe: \"Can I please get the steak bibimbap?\"\nHHE: In a very annoyed/rude voice - \"WE DON'T HAVE STEAK, WE ONLY HAVE BEEF\"\nMe: \"Ok, so we can't get steak instead of beef?\"\nHHE: Continues to be extremely disrespectful \"SIR, LIKE I TOLD YOU, WE DON'T HAVE STEAK, ONLY BEEF\"\n\nAt this point I was completely blown away with how rude and unprofessional this gentlemen was being over the phone.  I didn't say another word, hoping he would come to his senses, relax, and hopefully apologize.  Unfortunately, he didn't...\n___________________________________________________________________\n(Context: Placing a bibimbap order over the phone, employee being extremely rude saying that they don't have steak, only beef)\n\nHere is what happened next, and the reason why I will NEVER go back to Hahn's Hibachi:\n\nMe: \"I would appreciate some better customer service, I don't understand why you're being so rude\"\nHahn's Hibachi Employee (HHE): \"I TOLD YOU, WE DON'T HAVE STEAK, WE HAVE ONLY BEEF\"\nME:  \"You know what, I don't think I want to place an order anymore\"\nHHE: \"FINE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE YOUR ORDER ANYWAYS, FUCK-OFF\"\n\nThe employee literally told me to FUCK OFF...are you kidding me?  I understand people have bad days, but this is absolutely NO WAY TO TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS.  \n\nI'm disgusted, angry, and distraught.  No one deserves to be treated like this, especially a customer.

You coulda knocked us over with a paper towel, single ply. \n\nWell, begrudgingly with our heads lowered to the sidewalk, we tried Hahn's, and it turned out to be like a pistil in my scheinel ponnum. We both had the same thing, the $10.50 \"Beboppin' Bi-bim-bop\" served in a cast iron pot just like we were on an episode of M*A*S*H in a rice patty (see photo). It was chock full of deliciousness with chunks of barbecue pork and a whole lot of vegetables with a sunny-side egg in the mix. It's all on top of a mound of crackling rice that gets all brown and crunchy since that pot is frickin' hot to the touch. \n\nWe were both blowing our pots for about five minutes before we could dive in. Jamie, however, had the foresight to order the $5.95 Steak-Stuffed Jalapenos, all tempura-fried and yet still crunchy despite the oil drenching (see photo). They were good in that bulimic crack-pipe sort of way. It's comfort food on a cold holiday evening and may be worth passing up some pastrami for...if Miller's is closed, for sure anyway. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...old-school bi-bim-bop done to cracking satisfaction \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...clean, just a bit sterile \nSERVICE - 4 stars...very courteous and responsive \nTOTAL - 4 stars...Korean food on the fly...good stuff", "author": "Ed U."}

Some people can live off of delicious lumpia and bottled beer, but I felt the need to soak up some of my alcohol intake with something more filling.  I wanted rice, but the first place I thought of was super crowded.  Hahn's was busy too, but at least there was seating available.  The only waitress there had me take a seat and peruse the menu while she cleared off a small table just for me.\n\nThe menu appears much larger than I remembered.  They've added quite a few menu items.  I wanted rice though plus some meat.  Oh decisions, decisions.  I'd never tried their kabobs so I went with the Chicken, Beef and Shrimp Kabob Combo which is served with steamed rice, a green salad and bean sprout salad.  Considering how busy the kitchen was I was surprised that the wait for my food wasn't too long.\n\nSix skewers were featured on the long oval platter, two with teriyaki chicken thighs, two with four small shrimp on each, one with marinated flank steak and a veggie one with grilled mushroom, carrot, zucchini, broccoli and onion.  Although the shrimp was slightly overcooked I enjoyed all of the skewers.  The portion of steamed rice was perfect for my appetite and while I'm not a big fan of bean sprout salad I find myself eating it often because I love the flavor of sesame seed oil.\n\nI felt so good after the big meal that I went back to work and cleared all my paper work so I could start out fresh the next day.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

It can be a little loud upon RARE occasion as this is a family restaurant but, for the most part it's fairly quiet. It's really clean and you can tell the waiter takes great pride in his job - tables are cleaned immediately after a customer departs, the floors are clean, he's friendly, he's prompt to take your order and checks on you afterwards without being annoying (not to mention the appetizers come out before your meal and the meal comes when your appetizer is finished - I LOVE THAT and that is how it SHOULD be done). The food is incredible! I almost ALWAYS get the Pile Of Beef which comes with a GIANT rib with an awesome amount of meat on it, a skewer of tender beef that has been ribboned on it from top to bottom, sliced beef and 1 - 2 thin cut (small bone in) steaks and comes with a side of sticky rice (perfectly cooked - not to sticky and not to loose) and a little dash of salad with a sweet dressing......... DELICIOUS! It's a lot of food and I usually have to take half of it home with me and relish in delight that I have more for lunch. Dinner normally costs around $40 - $50 for two people including tip (I also get the tempura appetizer and 2 sodas). All entrees are VERY healthy portions so, if you like meat (and lots of it) at a reasonable, non-tourist price then I suggest going here.

Hard worker and very nice. \n\nThe street view of this place does not give the food justice at all! Very good food for pretty cheap price. A must go!", "author": "Marisa B."}

What drew me in is their bold sign that reads: \"Unquestionably the best Korean BBQ in town.\"\n\nThat's like saying: \"Hey Yelpers! Bring it on, bitches.\" To me, at least. So I gave it a try with my equally hungry buddy one day.\n\nLet's just say it was not \"unquestionably\" the best KBBQ I've had, but it does hold up a fight.\n\nThe dinner combos are an amazing deal: Tempura, pot stickers, rice, vegetables, and a pile of meat. Yum! Their BBQs are over-done though, and the quality of the meat leaves much to be desired. Again, awesome for the price ($10 meal!).\n\nWhat I don't seem to grasp though is the reason they charge an extra $0.50 for spicy meals. I've never seen such a thing before.

I have tried it at least 3 times and ordered something different every time to be fair. It's horrendous. First, let me say this is not Korean food. They give you meat that is just smothered in gravy. They could have gotten away with calling it Asian Fusion. You cannot taste the Korean flavors, nor does the gravy that they use to smother everything taste good. I've been disappointed every time and can't bother trying anymore at this point. I've even tried another location. Because so many people suggested it to me, I couldn't give up. But it's official, I'm throwing the towel in.\n\nIf you have never had Korean food you might like this.

I originally had my mind set on getting some BBQ but was distracted when I saw a picture of tofu soup, my absolute go-to food for cold days and days when I can feel a cold coming on. I got the beef tofu soup ($10) in \"medium\" spice and my friend ordered bulgogi.\n\n* Beef tofu soup: Terrible. I'm not Korean so I can't say whether this was more authentic than the ones I used to have in Atlanta. I just know that, comparatively, this tofu soup was super watery, barely flavored, lukewarm, not one bit spicy (usually medium would set my mouth on fire - just the way I like it), and had more tofu and zucchini than beef. The beef tofu soups in Atlanta are usually 50-50 in tofu and beef, a couple bucks cheaper, AND it comes bubbling hot with a raw egg you can crack into the soup yourself! The raw egg was definitely the best part. Anyway, my fault for ordering this on impulse.\n\n* Bulgogi: Eh, slightly below average. There's not much meat and it comes with a ton of onions and glass noodles in it (as fillers I guess?). The sauce also had entirely too much sugar in it.\n\n* Bi bim bop: I ordered this to-go after my disappointing tofu soup because I figured I should at least try the Yelper-recommended dish before I completely write off this restaurant in my book. I just had half of it for lunch and it was SOOO GOOOD! Despite being the smelliest to-go food my zipcar and my fridge have ever experienced, the rice and egg reheated nicely and, when stirred together with the rest of the cold veges and hot sauce, had my neighbors commenting on how delicious the hallway smelled a half hour later!\n\nIf I make a return trip, I'll be sticking with the bibimbop. It's $8.50 if you get it all cold and $10.50 if you get it \"sizzling\". Seems a bit much to charge for a heated version of the same dish but that's definitely the way to go if you're dining in.\n\nDon't be adventurous like me and order something that isn't officially recommended on here.

Hahn's Hibachi on Polk Street is by far the most disgusting Korean restaurant I've ever been to. I've pretty much been to all of them in SF, e.g., Brother's, Han II Kwan, Muguboka, and even the one at Stonestown Mall and this one's got to be the most disgusting.  \n\nWhen they brought me my food I thought I was at a school cafeteria!  Swear to God, that sh*t looked nasty, yo!  The BBQ pork was undercooked and didn't even look BBQed.  The chicken was mediocre at best -- it was swimming in a puddle of tasteless/flavorless terriyaki sauce.  How can an Asian restaurant fuck up their terriyaki sauce?  Isn't it just sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil?  You can buy that shit at Trader Joe's!  It was all watery and full of corn starch or glutinous clumps -- bland to say the least. \n\nThe food wasn't accompanied by the customary Napa cabbage \"kimchi.\" All Korean restaurants are well known for this preserved veg.  It a \"must\" to serve kimchi with Korean food.  I know that this is a dive and getting twenty little dishes of kimchi condiments would be an over stretched expectation...but come on, just don't forget the one that is a must!  \n\nThis place missed out on everything that was suppose to be Korean.  OMFG, the food was so nasty but I had just gone to the gym and was starving to death so you can imagine how bad it must have been for me to even say this.  Anyways, this place \"was\" my old hangout spot 10 years ago.  I frequented it so often back then that the cashier/owner knew exactly what I wanted to order.  But now, that has all changed for the worse and the conclusion I draw is that restaurants in the back drop of my memory lane is like old tossed out relationships, it is better to just not visit them, EVER...\n\nI seriously don't understand how some people could rate this dump a 4 and 5 stars!

An insider tip is to not scrape the rice off the edge, as this rice can cook for a long time and will serve as a nice, crispy texture.\n\nNeedless to say, after my tutorial, I thought the dish was pretty delicious.

My new roommates and I finish a long day of moving our crap in.  The heavy lifting required to haul all of my Ikea Dorphenschurgendunkenbergen's up three flights of stairs gave me a mean appetite for some meat on a stick.  \r\n\r\nI had no job at the time, so Hahn's was a quick and cheap fix for my carnivorous inclinations.  I made the offer to my new roommates and their boyfriends' to get them something if they so desired, but wisely they declined.  I picked up my food, went back to the new pad and scarfed that shit down.  I went to bed.  I woke up three hours later to:  1.  The sounds of one of my new roommates getting some meat stick of her own, if you know what I mean, and 2.  the sound of my other roommate, her boyfriend, and now one of his friends sitting up watching a movie in the living room, and 3.  the feeling that I was going to give birth to a warm chunky demon child via my mouth. \r\n\r\nHowever, being the tiny shoebox of an apartment that it was, the bathroom was shared by all, and happened to be in the very center, or hub, of the house, so that all rooms somehow were adjoined to said bathroom.  Therefore I opted to pull a black trash bag full of personal effects (I had run out of boxes, OK?), barely having time to remove its contents, and wrapped it around my head and sealed it off around my neck to then heave up what I believed to be everything I had eaten since I was I was a small child.

If I'm having BBQ, I expect a big bottle of BBQ sauce on the table. If I'm having authentic English Fish and Chips, I expect a bottle of malt vinegar on the table. Hahn's must be trying to appeal to us Americans who, in their perception, have not mastered or even reached the advanced level of chopstick technology. That was a disappointment. I had to ask for them. \n\nI ordered the \"Bi Bim Bop\". I had no earthly idea what I was getting and that's how I like, Culinary discoveries!

Personally, I'm not Korean. But I have a knack for being able to tell if a restaurant is authentic or not. Hahn's is total bullshit. Each of their menu items is completely generic and watered down (so they can make sure to serve the same dish at every location). There's nothing good about the meat, they just slop the sauce on. I've been to neighborhood Korean BBQ places that could run circles around this place.\n\nThis location is particularly lame. There's absolutely no room inside. You have to sit elbow to elbow with the other customers and the employees are constantly standing 2 feet away from you (which makes it difficult to talk shit while you're there).\n\nI don't what it is, hypnotism or hysteria, but most people seem to love these places.

Both of my visits were when I really needed some Asian-ish comfort food. First visit was for dinner -- I got the eel bowl to go. There was waaay too much teriyaki, glaze-type sauce ( it was NOT unagi sauce).  So on the second visit I thought that maybe I had aimed too high -- I should just stick with the meat. The same teriyaki, glaze type sauce smothered my meat. The meat wasn't too tough. I plan on rinsing off the sauce and using leftover meat in my udon.  Maybe if you ask for the sauce on the side?", "author": "Lisa M."}

Forks instead of chopsticks, though admittedly this benefits me immensely.  The menu contains only English words, and there is no panchan (the numerous small plates)!\n\nI ordered kalbi (or, as the menu descriptively called it, \"BBQ Short Ribs\") for 11.95$.  It tasted um a little like bulgogi?  I wasn't quite sure, but it didn't quite have the \"kalbi\" taste.  The plate was HUGE, 3 enormous strips of kalbi, rice, marinated bean sprouts, and I replaced the salad with kimchi.  Seriously, who eats salad at a Korean restaurant?\n\nIt's not the best Korean food I've ever had, but it's the only Korean place even reasonably close by, so I will probably be coming here a ton.  They do take out, accept credit cards, and my roommate likes their lunch specials.", "author": "emilie k."}

Not too crazy about the pork here. I was a bit surprised at the Squid & Vegetable Tempura, the tempura was actually sweet, thus making the squid taste very much like a seafood donut.

Not the best Korean food ever but decent. I guess my favorite part about getting Korean bbq are the little dishes of kimchee and other savory goodness, which this place lacked bc its more of a take out place. The chicken bi bim bop was ok. It lacked flavor which I quickly remedied by adding copious amounts of the special chili sauce that came with the dish. The \"mountain of meat\" which was an assortment of kalbi, bbq chicken and other meats was very flavorful and awesome. The spicy tofu soup was also very yummy, but what cracked me up the most was that the menu described tofu as a \"low-fat asian cheese.\" Having grown up eating tofu, I found this hilarious bc tofu is absolutely nothing like cheese. Oh well. I will prob return here sometime for take out when I can't make it to Korea House.", "author": "Lauren Y."}
