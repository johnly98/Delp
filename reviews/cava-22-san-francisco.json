We were actually waiting for our dinner reservation since we had more than an hour. Now we were considering the Latin American Club, but I wasn't feeling particularly edgy, disingenuous or young enough to fit in with the crowd there. We took a pass and decided to sit among the proletarians at the high-top table at Cava 22. There was only one table occupied and a few people at the bar watching the soccer game on the overhead screens. Yes, this was the vibe we wanted.\n\nThe margaritas are $7 at Happy Hour, and they're big goblets of party-time guzzling. We both got Strawberry Margaritas (photo: http://bit.ly/1Q4BgRT) because we lacked imagination to try anything else despite the allure of Watermelon, Peach and Lime options. We went for blended because that's my memory of what I used to get at Chevy's during my twenties. Tasty and pretty darn refreshing. We were getting a buzz, which may explain why we ordered the $5.50 Guacamole with Chips (photo: http://bit.ly/1Ms1urG) before a four-course dinner at Aster. Oh what the hell, it was my birthday after all and I needed avocado with my margarita. No need for me to explain.\n\nA month later, after enjoying the three-hour San Francisco Movie Tour, we were feeling a bit parched, so off we went to Cava 22 just as they opened at 5PM. Rather than viewing such a move as a sure sign of alcoholism, we decided to partake with their margaritas again. Still refreshing, their refreshing sweetness required us to order the $7.50 Regular Nachos with Chicken (photo: http://bit.ly/1RnAY72). They weren't the best nachos ever, but who cares? They were there to munch on while we gulped our two margaritas in a row. Now I'm thinking Sharetea should offer a tequila chaser to their Coffee Ice Blended boba drink.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...here for the margaritas, the food is decent enough but incidental\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...pretty spacious for the Mission\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...server was quite nice and accommodating\nTOTAL - 3 stars...I'm not wasting away in Margaritaville, honest", "author": "Ed U."}

It's a good place to watch a sporting event or to have a nice sit down dinner. Not that many places in SF have that. Their food is delicious and authentically Mexican (sorry abuelita but their food is almost as good as yours ) Their nachos and enchiladas are bomb-dot-com! And the ceviche OMG!!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-04", "description": "This review is based on the bar and the restaurant. \nThe bar alone would have put this at 4 stars. The strength of the drinks is 5 stars, but the service definitely takes it down a peg. You have to make your presence known, regardless if you are sitting down or at the bar. The drinks are pretty strong and for an average of 7 bucks per drink, that's pretty great. \n\nI had the fish tacos for dinner and they were DELICIOUS.  I was absolutely surprised by how fresh the fish tacos tasted. I loved that the fish was not batter- fried (which in my opinion is a ploy to make old fish edible in some cases) and they put the slaw on the  side, as oppose to loading my tacos with a bunch of stuff I didn't want. The tacos were nicely filled w/ a lot of fish and a little chipotle/spiced mayo on top. The fish was moist, tender, and melted in my mouth. I got two sides with my dish. I chose vegetables and black beans. The black beans were above average, but a little heavy on the salt. The vegetables were pretty good but they were only distinct because of the use of garlic. \n\nOverall, Cava 22 gets 3 stars because of the service for both drink and food. If they had more servers, or could better explain which areas were closed versus open, I would definitely give them more stars. For the pricing, this place is decent!", "author": "Jocelyn M."}

But let me explain:\n\nThe service is so frazzled (maybe only during busy happy hours?). I was at a table with a group of friends; we had a waitress, but she wouldn't stop at our table for more than five milliseconds before running off to tend to something else. We wound up ordering drinks from the bar. Upon trying to pay at the bar, though, the bartender shooed us away, saying it would be put on our table's tab.\n\nCut to the end of happy hour. We're all tipsy, full of chips, ready to pay up and move on to the next adventure. We were waiting a FULL 45 MINUTES for our bill that never arrived. We asked our waitress repeatedly. We talked to the bartender. We pleaded to other servers. We were literally waving our money around in the air, wandering around the restaurant, and no one would take it. \n\nSo, we put what we thought our bill amounted to (sans tip) and left. There was some debate about whether or not this was a good idea because there were a couple weirdos next to us, well-aware of the situation and eyeing our notes. And given that no one had paid attention to us the entire night, it was safe to assume those weirdos might pocket our cash before our waitress would think to grab it. I'm not into the idea of paying for someone's meth, but I'm also not keen on the whole dine and dash thing, so we hid our money under a basket of chips and bounced.\n\nI still feel awkward about the whole experience and have thus voluntarily 86'd myself, but I might work up the courage to come back soon - those margaritas are seriously killer.", "author": "Rebecca P."}

Based on the reviews I am reading here, I don't think I would ever come for food.  We stopped in, first time, prior to dinner down the street.  As a tequila lover, I am always looking for another place to wet my whistle.\n\nTheir tequila selection is decent.  It's not Tommy's or Tres in its quantity of choices, but it covers all the bases with a decent selection.  I have no idea why they use Cuervo as the well tequila for drinks, I didn't know any bar was still doing that.\n\nWe asked for an upgrade on the tequila and picked Espolon, which added $2 to the $6 (not Happy Hour, more below), and was still a good price.  Although it's not made like the \"San Francisco margarita\" pioneered by Julio at Tommy's, it isn't super-sweet.  I would prefer fresh lime juice squeezed in and agave syrup to sweeten, but like I said, it's still good.\n\nI really liked the atmosphere.  It reminded me of Mexico - just a hodge-podge of tables, the bar, TVs.  The crowd didn't just come from their button-down job around the corner.  It's not the least bit trendy.\n\nThere's a lot of posts about happy hour, and it's supposed to be 4-7 and $4 margaritas, but there was no happy hour pricing.  It would be nice to know, and also to see if the tequila upgrade could apply to the happy hour price.  We usually go downtown for happy hour margaritas at Tropisueno, which has a really good happy hour food menu also at happy hour.", "author": "Spike S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-05-13", "description": "I came here with a friend because I had a restaurant. com gift certificate. The only caveat: we had to order $50 of food - which is A LOT at this place for two people, but I was up for the challenge!\n\nRight when we sat down our server gave us a basket of chips and salsa (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cG-txGXNcZzxYSYkV99b2A?select=8uTQH72yqFaEPSOIa8PMEQ). The salsa was great and had some kick to it, but I wasn't a big fan of the too-thick chips. I only ate two (so as to leave room for the impending feast!) and they were both loaded with salsa.\n\nTo reach our target of $50, we ordered mostly small plates and one entr\u00e9e to share. There were some hits, but definitely a few big misses too:\n\nTOSTADA DE CEVICHE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cG-txGXNcZzxYSYkV99b2A?select=gjG5RCzwlq4yD_XQoM25Qg) - Yummy! I loved how refreshing this was with the lime. The creaminess of the avocado went well with the acidity.\n\nTOSTADA DE CAMARON (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cG-txGXNcZzxYSYkV99b2A?select=iys-m1yryeV7ADCZDf2Y9w) - Not as good as the ceviche. It had a different flavour profile (even though they're both \"lime marinated\") - I thought it tasted like Thousand Island dressing...\n\nSEAFOOD STEW (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cG-txGXNcZzxYSYkV99b2A?select=WOq_xmM5wnjn8f8XHR3aJQ) - My favourite dish! There was so much seafood - white fish, prawns, clams, mussels - and the broth was delicious. Only complaint was the way-overcooked mussels.\n\nROASTED GARLIC (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cG-txGXNcZzxYSYkV99b2A?select=VdT5pgQZ_PqLd7VA7rN9TQ) - I expected a dish called \"Roasted Garlic\" to be predominantly garlic. Nope - there were only about 8 cloves and the majority of the plate was taken up by the bread, cambozola, and fig compote. I smushed the garlic on the toast and ate it with the fig compote. Shortage of garlic aside, this was pretty good... except for the RANCID cheese. I normally love blue cheeses, but this was absolutely disgusting. I couldn't get the taste of the rotten cheese out of my mouth fast enough. \n\nPLANTANO FRITO (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cG-txGXNcZzxYSYkV99b2A?select=_IAOLXxsm8SfhElUGhN6JQ) - Delicious! Loved the cinnamon sugar with the plantains and that they weren't too greasy. A few of them were a little hard though :(\n\nBBQ RIBS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cG-txGXNcZzxYSYkV99b2A?select=u44hKTLT_MrvOye6O-y-ow) - Usually, fatty meat = tender meat, but they managed to eff this up. These were some of the fattiest and toughest ribs I've ever had. My friend only ate one and I ate the other three. If it wasn't for my inability to waste food, I would've stopped after the first one too.\n\nSKIRT STEAK (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cG-txGXNcZzxYSYkV99b2A?select=C-3u3gVEArWaHsfJgaiBAg) - Biggest disappointment of the night. One of my restaurant pet peeves is when the menu description doesn't match the actual dish. Where was the arugula (replaced by a heaping pile of spinach) and radish? Argh! Also missing? Salt and pepper on the potatoes (one of the cardinal culinary sins according to Top Chef!) I had to add my own salt from the shaker they were so bland. Double Argh!! The worst part was the actual steak. It was tough, dry, and more well-done than the medium I ordered. Triple Argh!!!\n\nI was impressed with the service though. Our server came to check on us several times during our meal (often enough so we didn't feel ignored but not too often that we felt pestered) and made sure our water glasses were always full.", "author": "Steph L."}

Definitely a wonderful weekend place to go with out-of-towners because it possesses a very lively atmosphere with a live mariachi band and large tables occupied by friends and families.\n\nMy favorite part of Cava 22 (minus the live mariachi band) was definitely the food....delicious! We had overflowing baskets of chips and salsa, a few orders of delicious ceviche tostadas which were incredibly fresh and tasty. I ordered the chicken fajitas which were really good as well. This dish could easily be shared between two people, FYI. My bf had the fish tacos which were also really good and just really fresh. \n\nMy only gripe about this place is that it's loud, I mean really loud, which just makes it a little hard to talk to people that you just met, much less talk to other people at your table besides the person sitting next to you. But I think if it were quieter, it would probably take away from the fun atmosphere.

However, there are plenty of great items.  Skirt steak is very good.  Lime-orange cilantro is a great touch.  Goes very well w/ potatoes and arugula.  Also try the ceviche tostadas.  Very good!  Almost as good as mom's.  Add tapatio and you're solid.   The rest of the menu is so-so (main reason for 4 stars)  \n\n\nDrinks-\nMargaritas!  $4 in happy hour.  Pretty good selection of different tequilas.  cheap tecates!  and they have the classics on tap.  \n\n\nPeople-\nAlways meet great people at this spot.  mix of young crowd and older cats but it def works.  meet people from all over LatAm, Europe, and locals from SF.  a lot of interesting stories.  bartenders are very cool.  Amado is one of the best at his craft.  \n\n\nFootball/sports-\nonly 2 TV's but cool spots to watch giants games and world cup soccer (mexico games!).  Saw Mexico/Argy.  Result sucked but the atmosphere was amazing.  packed.  dancing/singing/chanting...it was awesome.  not known for sports though.  closed on Sunday's during NFL games.  good place to watch SNF or MNF is you want to avoid big crowds.  Saw Game 7 of NBA Finals last year here and the place was jumpin'.  \n\n\nAtmosphere-\nMariachis Thu-Sat starting at 9:30pm.  2 songs for $20.  Outside of Mariachi it gets pretty loud on nights.  very good atmosphere.  cool people to meet. \n\nService is a bit weak if you sit in the tables.  they take too long.  best option is sit at the bar and have Amado take care of you.

For Valentine's Day my husband and I decided to try it out. We walked into the restaurant and it was almost empty. There were 3 people at the bar and 3 tables being served. \n\nWe got our menu late. There was only 2 servers and 1 cook for the WHOLE restaurant. We got Calamari for an appetizer, a Surf and Turf for dinner and a Caesar Salad as well. When we got the calamari the batter was falling of the calamari and the other weird vegetables they put on our plate. We then waited for 45 minutes until our entrees came out by this point the restaurant was full. When my husband got his Surf and Turf it looked like something I could've whipped up at home and not paid for at a restaurant NO GOOD. When I got my Caesar Salad it was drenched in dressing.\n\nWe ate our food and we're eager to leave since it was gettin too loud and obnoxious in the restaurant. We then waited 45 more minutes for our check. During this time 3 tables walked out because our server couldn't keep up with all of his tables. Overall, I wouldn't come here again. Shitty service and Mediocre food. Not a good combo.", "author": "Stephanie N."}

The inside is surprisingly spacious, with a variety of seating options: long friends' tables, small intimate tables, countertops with high stools, and of course, the bar.  Unfortunately, all surfaces are hard, rendering the live music (which otherwise was quite good) a perfect cacophony of blaring voices and instruments.  I was here with 6 girlfriends and our aim was to catch up, talk speech therapy and other hot items, but the music was so bloody loud that we could only talk (yell) to our nearest neighbor, still conscious of the vocal damage we were doing.  (Hey, at least we're keeping ourselves in business!)  We ended up leaving earlier than we normally would have.\n\nThe food was sub-par, I'd say.  Shrimp Diablo was appropriately spicy, though that was the only \"flavor\" coming through.  Side veggies had a suspicious look and taste of having been frozen.  (It's SPRING people!  In California, no less.  Fresh veggies are so easy and abundant around here.  No frozen veggies please.)  Service was so-so.  We were there to catch up and chat, so normally wouldn't have minded the absent staff.  However, when we started to imagine blood dripping out of our ears from the noise, we began to get restless.\n\nAll in all, this is probably a better place for after work cocktails (and before the music starts).  They do have a decent Tequila selection and it is a pleasant atmosphere until the live music comes and blasts everyone away.  I'd be back for happy hour perhaps, but would head a block away to the delectable Velvet Cantina for dinner.", "author": "Ravena F."}

Cava 22 is a pretty nice bar, and huge hang out places for Hispanics. $ 3 Happy Hour is at 4 PM to 7 PM.\n\nI happen to walk in with my lady at 7:30 PM and miss it. No worries, cause there was going to be live music. NO, not really it's seems like we came on the wrong day. It was Wednesday, and the Mariachi band doesn't perform that day. Only on Thursday, Friday, and Saturdays. The music they had, was pretty loud enough. So what else could me do. We were just going to drink a little, but we end up drinking way way too much. It's like going to a grocery store hungry. Talking about hungry. We had the muchies for some odd reason, and this place is known for it's Seafood. You see food, and you eat it. Cheesy, yes, but I saw Fried Calamari for $ 10. Expensive for one person, but for two.... Awesome!!! It's come with Zucchini sticks that didn't have much favor to it. The Calamari dish came with Cocktail sause. If you want to be cheap, you can just buy drinks, and they will served you chips with salsa. I will warn you, it's not like the healthy kind, it's rather pretty HOT!!!!!! That's why they give you water. The chips can be refill if empty if you ask.\n\nNow to the drinks and Mr. HAPPY HOUR!!! Tequilas and Margaritas are $6 outside happy hour.  The beer are $3. I got a Bud Light, but they accidently served me a Miller Light. I got what I wanted by the end up of the night. Sodas are $1.50 and you can get one free refill with that. \n\nThe service was so-so, our waiteress was not into serving as at all. She look like she was tired or something.\n\nThe bathroom were kinda bad, there was a lot of water. Only one person can go in at one time. I doubt I saw any locks.\n\nOverall: I will come back even if there was one part of the evening I hate, but it's not due to the place.", "author": "Ivy V."}

This is Mexican restaurant.  They do not have Sangria or Tapas.  Tapas are Spanish, this place just has small plates/appetizers and salads.\n\nTuesday, Thursday and Saturdays is when they have live performances.  I went on a Saturday and there was a Mariachi band.\n\nThe food was pretty good, however, don't expect an authentic Mexcian menu.  The menu is somewhat embarrassing American food; chicken fingers with french fries, Barbeque Ribs, Buffalo Wings with ranch dressing and celery etc...\n\nWe weren't sure if the menu had been abbreviated because it was after 10pm- but after reviewing the menu online, this seems to be the normal menu.  \n\nHowever, some things you ABSOLUTELY should try are the empanadas and the ceviche tostadas.  The ceviche is quite possibly the best I have ever had in my life.  Also the Caesar salad is quite good.  The strawberry and lime caipirinhas (kai-per-een-yas) are delicious as well (once again caipirinhas are not Spanish nor are they Mexican- they are Brazilian)!\n\nI feel like this place should be renamed and re-themed as a Latin fusion restaurant.  \n\nOverall this place was nice, however, I just wish it hadn't caught me by surprise boasting that it was a Tapas place on restaurant.com or in it's name \"Cava,\" which is a type of Spanish sparkling wine.\n\nI would go again, but only for the caipirinhas and ceviche.

One day over the course of the game three people sat next to me ordering three different dishes, and at one point each of them would lean over and tell me, \"The fish here is so fresh! You've got to try the fish!\" Well, I figured, there's gotta be truth to it if three complete strangers felt the need to pass it on. The next time I came, I ordered the seafood stew (the $10 one on the small plates menu) and my head exploded completely and has never been the same again.\n\n(For the record, I've since tried a bunch of other things here and never been disappointed. The black beans are delicious and the fried snapper in the chili lime sauce is outstanding. The lime in the ceviche tostada will take your head off.

I have tried to find similar tasting stew somewhere else in the city, since I no longer live around the corner from Cava 22 and want other options if the mood strikes me in, say, downtown. Well, no dice. (Funnily enough, the closest imitator I've found was in Livermore at an Italian cafe called Strings, for any fellow East-Bayers.)

Still it tasted good and it wasn't too crowded at all on a Thursday so you dont have to worry about getting a waiters attention. Parking, like everywhere in SF sucks like a vacuum.

Most importantly, the food came out really fast (we were starving). \nOur appetizer was the best part of the meal: roasted garlic, cambazola cheese, and a fig compote, all to be spread on grilled bread. Can't go wrong with that! For my main course, I got the prawns grilled with peppers, onions, and bacon, with a side of roasted vegetables, and a side of roasted potatoes. Although the food was tasty, it was missing some pizazz, it could have used a bit more seasoning.

I have almost nothing good to say about it.\n\nThe service was friendly but rough around the edges -- drinks took forever to show up; my 7 companions complained about theirs being weak. (I ordered a manhattan, which was slightly too bitter, but really impossible to make weak.)  \n\nBut the most damning thing was that the food verged on terrible, particularly at that price range ($20 per main, $8 per appetizer / side). The bread was cold and its crust was soft; it tasted like those Italian batards that you can pick up at any produce mart or at Whole Foods. They gave us plates of olive oil for dipping, but with no vinegar, salt, pepper, or herbs, and there weren't even enough olive oil dishes for the table. \n\nThe rest of the menu was sadly lacking. I'm [recently] vegan, and while I understand that it's a niche diet and I don't expect to eat lavishly at most restaurants in the city, I've always been able to cobble together a reasonably filling, nutritionally complete meal at most places. That said, this IS san francisco, and it's kind of annoying to go to a restaurant that clearly has not thought at ALL about its vegetarian / vegan customers. It only takes one bean dish and refraining from adding ham to the veggies, people.\n\nAt Cava 22, the only veggie options were fried glycemic carbs (empanadas with a dull corn filling; polenta sticks with tomato sauce; plantains with yogurt sauce;  and some of the most dreary french fries i've ever paid $8 for, mealy and soft without even the dignity of being greasy and salty). I tried them all and none were particularly good. \n\nI skipped the sauteed greens that were on the menu as side dishes.\n\nI also ordered the one salad without cheese -- a mixed greens salad with almonds. (Hello? Perhaps some olives or roasted red peppers would be appropriate here?) It was almost inedible. Each leaf tasted as if it had been marinated in distilled vinegar. The whole thing was dreadfully oversalted. Had they applied the salt and vinegar to the french fries and left the damn salad alone, they may have come out ahead of the game, but alas. \n\nEven more tiresome: I ordered my 3 appetizer dishes. A few minutes later the waiter came back to point out that I had not ordered a main dish. I said that I didn't eat animal products. He asked had I seen the vegetarian options. I said yes, and that I had ordered three of them. He then got confused about what I had ordered and the person next to me had ordered (shrimp, oysters, and a different salad), and we each had to repeat our orders back to him twice. \n\nWhat a mess. The decor was trite; the cocktail menu was limited, unoriginal, and all over the map; and now I'm out $40 that I could have used to buy 10 infinitely more satisfying veggie burritos.", "author": "Ellen B."}

I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact that NO ONE was there at 4 pm on a Sunday afternoon, (who doesn't want to drink expensive tequila at 4pm on Sunday?)\n\nMy dear friend James proceeded to order 3 shots of $20 dollar tequila.  When the server brought them over he put one in front of each of us.  I started to move the shot towards James, I assumed he had bought the 3 shots for himself.  (He's been drinking a lot lately.)  He kindly handed the shot back to me.  sweet.    The shots came with these little citrus-y bloody Mary type chasers.   I also had a margarita, another shot, and something that was on the house that also had tequila in it.

I noticed on Yelp that this establishment was in the Latin American category and was really in the mood for delicious cuisine. Imagine my disappointment when we arrived at the place and it turned out to be a bar and a semi-restaurant. The majority of the wooden tables were long, rectangular, and picnic style. However, they do have regular sized tables for smaller parties.\n\nI ordered the Tostada de Ceviche. It was served as ceviche on top of avocado slices on top of a flat, hard tortilla shell. There was a little too much lime on this dish for me. I didn't think that there was anything special about this dish. The Platano Frito was interesting. I've never had fried plantain served with a side of sour cream before. It was served as an appetizer but since the plantains were covered in cinnamon and sugar, I feel that it's more appropriate as a dessert or a snack by itself. For my entree, I had the Seafood Paella. I did not like this dish at all. It was under-seasoned with the mussels and clams being overcooked. The rice was also soupy. \n\nAs a restaurant, I don't recommend this place at all. I would say that it's more of a drinks and snacks place and because I was there mainly for dinner, I can't say anything about that aspect of the establishment.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

The chicken fingers that came with fries were cold and hard, the fried calamari tasted like rubber and could hardly be chewed, and the chicken in the cheese enchiladas tasted as if it had been sitting around all day.

We were there at an odd time and it was deserted, although other places in the neighborhood were full . It was nice that we could get all 10 around a big table, and the tables, paint, and fixtures are nice. Overall, the space just seems huge and empty, which I might not have noticed if it hadn't been INCREDIBLY COLD inside. I was freezing with my coat on, colder than outside even. The food was pretty good but arrived lukewarm even though we were the only people in the restaurant, I guess because it was so damn cold inside. The service was nice and attentive.

I had a pork chop that was nicely seasoned and with good sides but I am still trying to figure out why they paired the shrimp with mushrooms.  A salad we had was fine but a stewed pork was just dull.  I expected more from a cook who hails from Coco500.\n\nThe wine list is short and, except for a couple of interesting spanish wines, really uninspired (if I want to drink Columbia Crest I can buy it at any corner marker).  Maybe the drinks and tequila are interesting, but we never saw a drinks menu.\n\nThere were not very many people in the restaurant so my guess is that others who have tried it are similarly unethused.\n\nSFD", "author": "Peter H."}

We watched it's trasformation from the Bahia Club to Cava 22 with interest, and it seems like it hasn't really caught on yet.  I think the menu is pretty good, but there are so many good tapas restaurants within a 3-block radius that are as good and less expensive.  For example, Esperpento, Cha3, Limon Rotisserie, etc.  \n\nWhat really annoyed me about this place is that there was a street barker (I think he may be the owner) who stood out in front goading you inside.  At least, the first month or two that was the case, and it was a real turnoff.  We actually avoided it at first because of it.  But then we thought we should give the restau a shot because it always looks so empty and forlorn, and the menu looked pretty good.  So we finally went and the dishes were rather tasty.  \n\nWe had the truffled raviolis, which are good but not really big enough to share, and the strip steak with fries.   I think we had some other things but their margaritas were good and probably contribute to my lack of memory.   I thought the portions were 20% too small and 20% too expensive.

We were short on time so we told the host that we needed to be quick. We were told this wouldn't be a problem. 15 min later we're still waiting for some one to come take our drink order, bring us water, something! Finally a gentleman rushes over and we tell him we're in a hurry, can we order everything now. He takes our order, leaves, and then we don't see him for another 15 min. I have to flag down the host  to ask where our drinks are and can we please get some water? Finally the drinks show up, followed 2 min later by the food (at least the food came \"on time\"). Not that it was worth the wait; skip the empanadas and the pork all together - both were barely edible). The plantains were good but I would avoid the side sauce (a creamy side with chives and herbs - whose ever heard of such an accompaniment to plantains?!) The oysters were decent, along with the grilled rib eye, which was a good value. Overall the food was just ehhh at best. After we were thru eating, our server came over and apologized for the bad service and offered us a round of drinks on the house. At least they tried to make up for it some what. And the bill was pretty reasonable - 4 people with a round of drinks and 6 plates for less than $100... not really going to find that kind of value at many places, especially in the \"hip\" mission these days. So 1 star because we didn't drain our wallets on bad food and 1 star for the free drinks. If that's enough for you, then head on over. If not, then go to one of the hundred other mission eateries that seemed to have popped up every where.", "author": "Lisa W."}

Soon after that the busboy brought us a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.  Warning: the Salsa is  somewhat hot and spicy.  You want to have some ice water handy before you dip.   We didn't and suffered for it.  We ordered a pitcher of margaritas to start.  They took a little too long to bring the drinks and water, otherwise the service was top notch.  For dinner I ordered the Seafood Paella.  Someone else ordered the Red Snapper and got the whole fish, head and tail included.  Fajitas were ordered, one beef  the other chicken.  Everyone said they really liked their food and drink.  The waitress was friendly, efficient and very dignified.  At one point the jukebox got too loud but the staff rushed to remedy the situation.  There was no Mariachi band that night but I saw that as a blessing since we had just done the audience thing for two hours at the Marsh and really just wanted to talk and interact with each other.  In the middle of our dinner some guy in costume wandered into the restaurant carrying a guitar.  Although the digital jukebox was playing he sat on a stool in the middle of the room noodling quietly on his axe.  I was worried that he would walk up to our table and serenade us but that never happened.  Next time I looked up he was gone.  For SF this restaurant is very reasonably priced.  I would come here again and recommend it to my friends.  Parking is difficult/expensive but there is a BART station not too far away.  After dinner as we were walking to the parking garage on 21st  Street a homeless guy with a shopping cart stepped in front of the six of us and asked for 75 cents.  Two of the women started digging in their purses while one of men shook his head and stated firmly,\"It's going straight for booze!  Straight to booze!\"  All in all a very San Francisco experience.", "author": "Tom M."}

We got there around 6PM on a Monday, and the place is almost empty.  The only bartender is also the only waiter (till about 7 PM).  Since most of everyone sits at the bar, we kindda have to wait for services to drink and everything else.\nWe had a certificate from restaurant.com which stated it is valid if you order more than $35 or more.  After the waiter checked with the owner, he informed us that the term has changed and we have to order more than $50 to use the certificate.  I found that to be very odd as the terms are stated on the certificate, but not a big deal.  We proceed to order the short ribs and the seafood paella.  The paella was great, and the short ribs were good, but the mushroom that came as the dish of the short ribs were a little plain.  \nI did enjoy the drinks very much, but the after dinner dessert was definitely a disappointment.  I wanted the flan, and it came looking like the surface of the moon.  With lots of holes and tasted dense and plain.\nBecause of the $25 off, we had a good meal at a reasonable price, but otherwise I think their food is overpriced for the quality.\nI would recommend for drinks, especially if you like tequilla.", "author": "Cynthia C."}
