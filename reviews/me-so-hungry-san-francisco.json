As you can probably guess, I'm not much of a food truck connoisseur, but even I've heard good things about Me So Hungry from people who follow the Off the Grid markets. I don't mind them, I just don't seek them out, but this one landed on my doorstep, or at least in front of the office building where I work. Since I was tired of getting my daily vegetarian sandwich that particular day, I decided to go for broke and ordered the relatively bargain priced Cali Sliders at $8. You get two with an order, nice little Angus beef patties stacked with smoked Applewood bacon, balsamic sauteed onions, mixed greens and Gorgonzola cheese, encased in a freshly baked bun.\n\nI also went for a $4 order of the Garlic Parmesan Fries with little regard for my colleagues back at the office who had to sit next to me at a staff meeting (photo: http://bit.ly/1NeZZRi). There were plenty of other sliders to consider (though they appear to run out quickly judging from the number of crossed lines on the menu) and regular-size temptations like the $9 Monster Burger that featured cheddar and Asian BBQ sauce, the $10 Duke that included onion rings and cheese bread, and the obligatory Garden Burger for $9. But for $12, I got a pretty decent amount of food that was well prepared for a truck. The sliders were devoured pretty quickly, but that was just as well since I was eating at my desk and didn't feel like being interrogated over how good they were. Yes, they're good, now go back to your computer please!\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...better sliders and fries than you would think you would get from a food truck\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...uhhh, it's a truck...what ambiance?\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...the food is prepared pretty quickly considering the growing queue\nTOTAL - 4 stars...burgers from a truck?

I've visited a few trucks that specialize in Sliders and they usually aren't very good.  But theirs are actually done pretty well, very reasonable portion sizes, and taste pretty good.\n\nThey have 3 kinds of sliders:\n\nCali Sliders --  http://bit.ly/U2AbsB\nAngus beef, Smoked Apple-Wood Bacon, Balsamic Sauteed Onions, Gorgonzola Cheese Sauce\n\nKTM Sliders -- http://bit.ly/Ui1boq\nMarinated Short Ribs, PepperJack Cheese, Crispy Onions, Spicy Creme Fraiche\n\nFlyin' Hawaiian Sliders w/ Garlic Parmesean Shoe String Fries  --  http://bit.ly/TYaAXQ\nChicken, Crispy Maui Onions, Chipotle Aioli\n\nMy favorite out the the three is definitely the KTM Sliders with their marinated short ribs.  They're so packed with flavor.  The Cali burgers are okay and the Chicken Hawaiian sliders also have a nice tangy flavor to them.\n\nIt's pretty cool that their sliders and burgers are fresh and made to order, but sometimes the wait can be pretty long.  After a few visits, it seems to take about 15 minutes to get your food on average.  Luckily I'm a patient customer so it doesn't bother me too much, especially when they're really busy outside of a bar or other food truck gathering sites.\n\nOverall, despite the long wait times,  I think MeSoHungry is a good truck, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice if I had to choose from several trucks at Off The Grid or SOMA Streat Food Park.  I'll still pay them a visit if I have a good craving for their KTM Sliders.", "author": "Rodney H."}

There were four people in front of us and to get up to order took about 20 mins. We ordered again and the wait to get our food was another 20 mins. Forty minutes total and my stomache was ready to eat itself.\n\nWhat we swallowed:\n\nSLIDER SAMPLER:\nCALI SLIDER (ANGUS BEEF WITH SMOKED APPLE WOOD BACON, BALSAMIC SAUTEED ONIONS MINUS THE GORGONZOLA CHEESE): This was a pretty good burger. The meets was cooked well done (as requested) and this was tasty.\n\nKTM SLIDER (SHORT RIBS WITH PEPPER JACK CHEESE, CRISPY ONIONS MINUS THE CREME FRAICHE): Other than the fact that I had a huge chunk of short rib (It was seriously the size of half my fist) in between this little tiny slider bun, the meat had a good flavor although the crispy onions were very limp.\n\nFLYIN HAWAIIAN SLIDER (SHREDDED CHICKEN WITH CRISPY MAUI ONIONS AND CHIPOTLE AIOLI): The chicken was very sweet but what's worse was it was COLD! Ugh! Cold shredded chicken! Yuck! One bite and I was done with it!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/me-so-hungry-san-francisco?select=wRhtEfnYkJ68L9URt9nuIg#yC94fYHeToHTTT7Khtvyhw\n\nMONSTER BURGER (ANGUS, BACON, CHEDDAR CHEESE, LETTUCE AND ASIAN BBQ SAUCE): This burger was a MONSTER indeed! HUGE! It looked promising but we ordered ours well done (hello? I'm pregnant!) and we pretty much got it rare. Soooo pink in the middle it was almost gross, even if you liked it medium rare, it was wayy pink! There was no way I could eat it.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/me-so-hungry-san-francisco?select=wRhtEfnYkJ68L9URt9nuIg#JwZ9f4fKqeNBiAhq09B0Sw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/me-so-hungry-san-francisco?select=wRhtEfnYkJ68L9URt9nuIg#wRhtEfnYkJ68L9URt9nuIg\n\nSHOE STRING FRENCH FRIES: Really? Shoe string? Look how thick those fries are! Mind you, they are up against a MONSTER BURGER but those are steak fries people!\n\nSWEET POTATO FRIES seasoned with Garlic and Parmesan & Parsley: You can't really mess up sweet potato fries and I'm so glad they didn't. It was the best thing that came off that truck. Good flavors and wasn't sopping in grease. THESE fries were cut thin. How'd they go from shoe string sweet potato to shoe-string/steak fries? These were the best thing that came off that truck.\n\nI'm glad I got to experience their truck but I wasn't impressed if the best thing that came off it was the Sweet Potato fries following by the KTM Slider. It's a little discerning when you ask for a well-done burger and get something not even remotely close (I said 'Well-done\" please, not \"Mooing\"). I don't think I would hit them up again but if someone around me ordered from their truck, I would take a bite to see if they can redeem themselves but this one is a definite pass.", "author": "Vivian A."}

Tasty and perfectly charred on the inside, this is one of the best parts about their food.\n\nThe burgers, in my opinion, are not worth getting. While filling, not much stands out to me about them. The same goes for the cali slider, which uses the same patties.\n\nThe hawaiian sliders are very poor as well. The only good part about these are the chipotle aioli and the buns.\n\nMy favorite dish here is the KTM slider. The marinated short ribs are very tasty and soft. Together with the pepperjack cheese, crispy onion strings and creme fraiche sauce, this just melts in your mouth. I order this every time now.\n\nTheir parmesan sweet potato fries are a nice side dish to go with the KTM sliders. It also uses the creme fraiche sauce as well as parmesan and parsley. Since it is sweet potato instead of regular fries it is slightly more health as well, although not much.\n\nOverall this is one of the better trucks out there, although it is somewhat pricey.", "author": "Mark O."}

They should just throw kimchi in there. \n\nI thought the best one was the Cali Slider. The ground beef patty was salty enough and was cooked pretty well; it had a nice pink color on the inside.

Took it back to them and asked if they could cook it a little more. They told me that it was correctly cooked as medium rare and that I must have wanted medium. If they had cooked it any less it would've been essentially a pile of raw meat, but whatever, maybe I'm wrong. I'm willing to be wrong so long as they fix the problem. \n\nTo solve the problem, they took the two halves of the burger and placed them face down on the grill for about 30 seconds. The result is that the greens got soggy and weird, while the centers of each side were still pretty raw. I threw it away.

Slowly roasted duck or pork on anything taste good, but here at \"Me So Hungry\" - which probably comes from the original phrase \"Me so horny\" {Pause for laughter}.\n\nThe cali sliders was a perfect blend of meat and cheese. Ill admit that the patty were on the thinner side, but i'm fine with that. The thick bacon and cheese added a nice touch to it. I wish they offered it in a normal size burger. LIke offer two sizes - slider and burger size. I eat fast, so it took me a total of 8 bites to finish both sliders. \n\nThe Free parmesan fries did not impress me at all tho. Although they were perfectly cooked, it was a unbalance taste of lots of garlic on some fries and a hit of cheese on the other fries. I would just get normal fries. \n\nAll in all - I'm a fan. If i saw this truck again i would go back if i was craving for burgers!", "author": "Ryan R."}

I usually get something when it's there and I usually enjoy the food. \n\nI've tried both fries (garlic parm & garlic parm sweet potato). Both are awesome and I normally never eat too many fries at once. My boyfriend loves them too and he ate my leftovers. I do notice that they give less fries when their venue is on campus compared to if they were at an Off the Grid event which I do not like. That alone made me not want to buy their food on campus as much.\n\nI've had all the sliders because I usually get slider samplers (i like variety). I think I liked the Cali sliders the most but wasn't too sure about the gorgonzola. The KTM and the Hawaiian are great too but definitely different flavors. \n\nI've also tried the banana caramel bread brioche (or something) which were also good, just very heavy and a big portion. It also sucks when the whipped cream melts off when you let it sit to eat your savory food first. \n\nOverall, great food. Good service. Bold flavors.", "author": "Sofia R."}

We lined up at noon and by the time I got my food it was 1:15.  Can't believe I waited in line so long.  Not only was the line long but they ran out of some food.  I ordered the Cali Slider and KTM Slider but then when my order was near being ready, they told me they ran out of KTM sliders.  Apparently they don't keep good track of their inventory to know how many burgers they have.  So I switched to 2 Cali Sliders and a side of sweet potato fries.  I was surprised to find my fries cool and sort of limp.  My first Cali burger wasn't hot either.  It was room temperature.  It tasted OK.  The meat didn't have any char to it so it was sort of bland but the bacon helped add flavor.  After I bit into my 2nd Cali burger, I saw it was raw in the middle (I'm posting a picture).  I had already swallowed the first bite so I'm hoping I don't get sick.  I can't believe the burger is raw in the middle.

Just too many things going on, and I couldn't pick out any specific flavor. The occasional crunchy onion was nice, but in general there was something icky about it, the way that pasta salad made by someone else's mom is icky. \n\nChicken slider:  Very similar experience to the pork slider. The toppings all sounded amazing on the menu, but in the end it was like eating a slightly spicy coleslaw made with warm chicken instead of cabbage.\n\nBeef slider (burger): Nice beef but overwhelmed by blue cheese (gorganzola?) sauce. There wasn't that much sauce, it was just really strong. I could occasionally taste the bacon, but not often. Didn't notice the onions. Again...Too many things going on at once.\n\nWhat I was really looking forward to were the sweet potato fries with the spicy cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.

I waited in line for about 20 minutes then waited for my order for another 15. Upon receiving my order, the employee handed it down to me and then quickly turned away to get more orders- no \"thank you\", no \"napkins are right here\" or \"enjoy\", nothing. I had to stand there and wait for him to come back so I could complete my order because  they gave no dipping sauce with the garlic fries. When I asked for some the guy looked stressed out by me and said \"50 cents\" to which I responded \"k I'll go get 50 cents for you and come back\" to that he just impatiently shrugged and handed me the ketchup. \n\nAs for the food- no dice. The fries were OKAY, crispy but very dry and very little garlic on them. The Flyin Hawaiian chicken sliders were AWFUL. They didn't seem to have anything on them except this shredded chicken that was drenched in the most cloyingly sweet sauce imaginable. The sauce had no other flavor aside from sugar. How is this a Hawaiian slider? The way I imagine they made this slider is they shredded some dry over-baked chicken and then let it swim in a tub of simple syrup for a few hours then put it on some mediocre buns and send it out. It wasn't even warm. Seriously bad. \nWhen you're making 3 diff types of slider, one of which u are sold out of, and sweet potato and regular fries and that's it, there's no excuse for taking as long as these guys did tonight.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-01-26", "description": "Me So Hungry was at Drake's Brewery on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Staff was friendly at ordering and at food pick-up. A trio of sliders and a couple sweet potato fries were ordered - the sampler was the chicken and double on beef since the KTM was out of stock - I wasn't intrigued by the vegetarian option but also, didn't notice it since it wasn't on the picture menu, only the left side written menu with the event specific prices. The yam frites are a great option and much preferred over onion rings and potatoes but they were clearly a) frozen and b) lukewarm although there was a steady supply of customers. I picked up the food immediately when they called my name as my party was hungry after riding 30+ miles to the destination. \n\nThe two sauces provided to customers, were also required, for both the sliders and frites, one was a ketchup like sauce and the other was a mayonnaise heavy thousand island type. There were little nutrients by way of greens in the meal, both of which could have enhanced the texture, flavor, appearance and depth of the offerings.  That I remember the sauces more than the substance of the main food should reveal why I've experienced plenty better. I saw a Duke come out which appeared more substantial at least visually. On that, perhaps avoiding the sliders for the full sandwiches is a better route. \n\nI was glad the truck was at the brewery (although there were a number of restaurants in the nearby vicinity that could have been optioned instead). Credit card was accepted. Pricing was typical, expected for the food truck experience - $22 for one slider sampler and two sweet potato fries - just shy of a comparable meal recently enjoyed at Gott's SF which provided seating, water, condiments, and warmth - all with the overhead of the most prime retail space in SF. Come to think of it, the pricing then was too high. Total wait time, prep, and delivery took 45 minutes. The saving grace was the company, great people to hang out with while in line and great people to hang out with while waiting for the food.", "author": "Wilson T."}

They served up some of the tastiest food truck eats I've had yet (20 trucks and counting!). \n\nI ordered a trio of the Cali/short rib/Hawaiian sliders and enjoyed all three of them. The Hawaiian slider caught me off guard (in the best way possible) by the sweet intensity of the chicken & sauce coupled with the tangy-ness of the crispy onion strips. \n\nNext up, the Cali slider brought some balsamic-sauteed onions into the mix to create a fresh flavor profile. Since I don't do gorganzola, I swapped that out for the Asian bbq sauce, which made for a great switcheroo. My only gripe with the Cali was the burger meat was a little on the well side (**but I hadn't requested my preference; I'd recommend going medium rare though). \n\nLast up was the short rib slider and, hot damn, I haven't had short rib meat that tender in my life. The sweet Asian bbq sauce went perfectly with it. All in all, $11 is steep for sliders off a truck but, given that their ingredients are legit (grass fed beef ftw), and that each slider is crafted on a spongy, but fresh brioche-like bun, it's at least worth a try, but I warn you...you could get hooked.\n\nI also ordered some garlic/parm fries. I liked the seasoning but wasn't crazy for the spuds themselves; overall it was good, but the fries were a little tough for that cut (they're not quite the crispy shoe string fries, more like a thin cut). If you go with someone, I recommend getting 2 or 3 sliders each and then splitting fries or onion rings. \n\nKudos to them for coming out to Geng Rd, and kudos to them for their awesome, speedy service.", "author": "Nick P."}

The ribs were yummy, nice flavor, perfectly cooked and a nice texture that while tender did have a little tooth feel so it was rather nice. They are nicely presented on a high sided rectangular paper plate which is almost a rectangular bowl. I like his because it holds the burgers in place and captures any escaping ingredients. I also like the thrive cat toothpick that hold the rather soft burger together while I eat it (I ate arid the toothpick to the very end and everything stayed together). On the downside, the burgers only had a think slice of pepper jack that when tasted alone did not have any significant flavor, only a very faint pepperiness. The pepper jack I get att he local supermarket has more flavor and pepperiness than this one did. If there was any creme fraiche in our sliders, we could not taste them nor after taking the slider apart could we find any trace of it. The line had built up so I really did not want to wait all that time to complain then it again for that many sliders to be made for us again. They actually tasted good (the ribs were very good) and just needed a bit more to form a complete flavor experience.\n\nThe staff is good, professional and took the order accurately and quickly. I can't believe that they are still dangling a tablet out he window for people to do a credit card transaction, I hope they ordered the brand new ApplePay reader for Square so we can just wave our iPhone in front of the window and not have to deal with a dangling tablet (I really don't like to touch something the everyone else has touched, moment before eating gourmet sliders.\n\nThe price was high for how much for you got, its proved like a gourmet meal and they have gourmet ingredients but I did not find it to be a gourmet flavor profile and the excessively soft bread does not offer a gourmet texture.\n\nI would try them again the next time they come around.

The garlic/parm is a complaint here a lot in yelp, the problem is it drops to the bottom of the plate so it seems like you don't get much of it, but you do, it's just not on the fries, instead it sits on the plate.\n\nCons\n-Pricing is a big high.  I'm usually OK with food trucks pricing ~$15 for a lunch sized portion, but this pricing is more restaurant sit down $4 fries etc..\n\n-Burger was way over cooked.  I was asked how I wanted it cooked and said medium.  It came back well-done, maybe over-done.  It was a slider size so I know those are hard to keep track of, but if you ask me how I want it cooked, and then ignore the fact that it's not even close...\n\n-Chicken also seemed over cooked.  A bit tough/chewy for pulled chicken\n\n-Brioche buns.  Seems like every truck is doing brioche buns now.  They look great in photos, but more often then not they are tough, somewhat stale, flavorless and way too bulky.\n\n-Sweet potato fries were way overcooked.  They looked way dark, and tasted burnt.\n\nThis truck is run out of L.A. so it could vary by location, but the one here in S.F. overall I'd just say it was ok.

The food came out sizzling, so I knew it was freshly cooked and not microwaved. The Angus beef had some nice grill marks as well. \n\nBut, I have to say I was a little disappointed by the Cali Sliders. The Gorgonzola Cheese sauce, although not smothered on, overpowered the overall  the sliders, especially the bacon and beer, which usually overpowers food in general when mixed. The bacon was hidden under the beef and onions that I rarely got a taste of it. The Angus Beef was cooked just right, but its flavor was hidden under the sauces overpowering flavor. \n\nOverall, the Cali Sliders were good, but the sauce overpowered any other flavors that might have been in the slider. I would recommend the slider if you're a huge Gorgonzola fan, but if you're not, then choose something else, like the Duke.", "author": "Marco M."}

It was raining, so not many people in line (glad they had an awning/tent to keep me dry). The food came quickly, but clearly they are cooked to order so it took about 10 minutes--maybe a bit less. No complaints from me. I'd rather wait for something fresh and hot than have it prepared ahead of time.   It was cooked perfectly for my taste--I ordered it medium and it came pink-to-light red and juicy.  Just the way I like it.  Next time, I might switch out the bacon for the crispy onions. The Asian BBQ sauce was a little on the sweeter side.  My only surprise was that an order of fries (either shoestring or sweet) were $5. Seems a bit steep for a side dish, so I skipped them. Also, they didn't have their bacon brioche donuts--I was going to take them home for dessert after dinner, so I was bummed about that.", "author": "Greg R."}

Very unprepared as clearly food was not prepped ahead of time. Showed up at 11:45am at San Bruno location and ran out of a lot of things by 12:10pm (sweet potato & onion rings). Clearly do not know what they are doing here.", "author": "Kendric O."}

Not phased I then asked to just get some sweet potato fries when he informed me that there's an $8 minimum on using cards. I said \"even though you ran out of my burger\"? He said my least favorite human expression \"it is what it is\" and I took my card back. As I walked away he said \"I was going to let it go but then you said it like that.\" Guys... It's easy to get a big head and forget your serving people. However, when you run out of an item (although it is to be expected) you should make sure that the person who stood in your line isn't then further inconvenienced by a bad attitude or a silly policy that you made for optimal purchasing moments. It isn't my fault you ran out of the item. It is your fault for not marking it as being out and then getting an attitude with someone who used to be a fan of your stinkin' burger. Skip this one guys. They forgot how to treat people.", "author": "Curtis M."}

He also handed me my food with all this stuff stuck to his hands. Nevertheless, I finished my food cause my mom taught me to never waste food or money.

Flyin' Hawaiian with shredded chicken, creme fraiche,  and siracha sauce (with toasted onions) had some flavor but still not much else. Both sliders would be improved with more vegetables. Biroche bread was good, but on the whole not worth the high prices. They were out of KTM sliders. Given this truck a fair try, and not certain will return.", "author": "Matt R."}

So I wander into this foodtruck zone and go to the only burger and fries place. They don't have just the classic cheese burger it was hoping for, and not being picky I get a sampler and get two short rib sliders and a angus bacon slider with gorgonzola cheese with garlic Parmesan fries. When I go to pay the total was ridiculous, it was $23 something for three sliders and fries no drink. My food came quick and looked good so I was going to ignore the steep price if the food was delicious. Which it wasn't... The burger was super dry with no bacon to speak of and the cheese was in sauce form and not even real. As for my other two sliders they were better but not by much. The cheese in these was suppose to be pepper jack but it came as some type of pink paste (fake cheese again), but the pulled short rib was really good I'll hand them that. It was all meat not to much else. Now for the fries they were alright but needed a lot of salt. Overall I'm really disappointed and if it had cost me 10 bucks I wouldn't have cared so much, but it was almost 30 bucks for this. I could have gotten a crap load of McDonald's and been 10x happier.", "author": "Elayna M."}

Ordered the slider sampler, then waited at least another 15 minutes for my order to be ready.  Finally got my food and found a table and sat down to eat.  Bulgogi and chicken sliders were cold...COLD!  And what the hell possessed the crew to think that I wanted the veggie burger slider instead of the angus beef with bacon slider???  And it was a half a veggie burger, charred (burnt) super crispy thrown on a slider roll...LAME.  Why would I order a sampler of sliders, all with meat, but decide I want one with the veggie burger patty instead of the one with angus beef and bacon...BACON?  I mean, really?

A friend of mine that works in the area told me about me so hungry. A slider truck, and I thought yum. I have tried curry up now while they went to oracle, chairman bao when at the mint plaza. The line when I got their was about 10 in front, so I thought it must be good. Took about 10 minutes to order but that gave my husband time to check out their menu. We ordered the sampler, 2 shortribs, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. We had to drop of food for the friend that let us know about it. First off the sliders were great and the sweet potato fries were amazing. They give you a pretty good amount of fries and they are good compared to other sweet potato places I've tried. All in all I will go back to them again if they are in the same location on Tuesday because that is my day off. For the other people that said it took them 1and 1/2 hours to get their food, that's some b.s. I went on my day off, so knowing that they would be in front of some office, I went at 12 to make sure I was in the somewhat front of the lunch break line. I got my food in 15 minutes and was grubbing away in my friend's work parking lot at 1100 bay hill.", "author": "Lillian K."}
