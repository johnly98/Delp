The salmon was lightly seasoned and was not too undercooked nor over cooked. It was just right. However, the crunchy tortilla bowl was very brittle and I expected something with a more crunch factor to it and the dressing didn't seem to compliment the salad and salmon that well. Maybe my experience would have different for the tri-tip too.

The clam chowder was pretty standard, but a little on the soupy side. I liked the one at Lord George (well durr, they are at very different price points). The clam chowder at Basa Seafood Express is good too. The veggies were pretty undercooked-- my squash was fairly raw. The tri-tip was good as always, if a bit salty and less meaty flavor than desired. The mashed potatoes here are very dependable and creamy (when are they not).

The salad was humongous!! But I was starving, so I pretty much finished it. There was such a great variety of vegetables (corn, beans, guac, radish, etc) in there and in large amounts as well to where there was no overpowering of either veggies sides or lettuce. The vinaigrette paired along with it was very tasty as well. I think my favorite part was the taco shell...it was so crispy and flaky like a pastry and it held it's shape really well up until I was done and it never really got too soggy. \n\nThe steak wrap burrito was really good as well.

I used to get the Krispy Chicken Avocado (sometimes add tri-tip, definitely extra dressing) but I've converted to getting the Cabo chopped (no beans, add crispy chicken, add tri-tip, extra dressing). Adding double meat gets the salad to around... $17.50 but this place has Yelp cash back and if you check in on Yelp you get a dollar off. Every Buckhorn also has a rewards program but they're specific to the location... which is kind of sad and it's a fairly archaic system, you have to tell them your phone number each time.\n\nThe lime dressing they put on the salad is out of this world, I've been scouring the internet trying to find a copycat recipe but I've yet to succeed. \n\nThe staff here is super nice. The only thing I would caution anyone getting to go and not eating at the mall is to check your order... thoroughly.

There were only 2 people ahead of my friend and I in line but what we didn't realize was there were a number of people waiting for their meals (I'm talking at least 15 people). We both ordered chicken tenders from the side menu thinking it couldn't take more than 10 minutes to make and boy was I wrong. It took nearly 40 minutes!!!! And I'm pretty sure it would have taken longer if we didn't ask for our order at least 3x before they started making it. Apparently they \"forgot\" the first 2 times. I was livid and made it clear to the owner who was trying to help with the orders that we had been waiting a significant amount of time for what we were told would be ready in about  minutes. His response was basically that it was unacceptable but also that they were new and still trying to figure it out. Well advice to you Mr Owner, these things should be thought of beforehand. No one in FiDi on their lunchtime wants to be waiting 40 minutes for what ended up being greasy chicken that was not even good. \n\nWould NOT recommend coming here.

This salad has a good mix of chopped romaine, avocado, black beans, corn, jicama, radishes, and tomatoes.\n\nMy new favorite is the trip tip flatbread wrap minus the blue cheese again. It seems like a whole wheat wrap with romaine, red onion, tomatoes, celery, mushrooms and ranch dressing.

I love the crispy chicken and avocado salad here, but the last time I got it I paid $13 for a plate full of lettuce! They must be cutting costs or something, because my salad had only a few pieces of the chicken, a few grape tomatoes, and most disappointing at all, TINY and pathetic chunks of avocado that might not have even been from half an avocado! Many of the pieces were also browning! After eating only half of the salad, I had run out of all toppings and had nothing to eat along with the lettuce.\n\nThe cashier wasn't friendly and was forgetful. She asked me what my order was again right after I had just told her a second ago. I also asked for water, but of course, I didn't get it and had to ask another server for it. Something else that has also bugged me about this Buckhorn is that they charge a \"SF mandated fee\" to your bill, a fee I have never seen anywhere else in SF. \n\nNow I have to get 20 of their free samples just to make up for the disappointing meal I received.", "author": "Enari L."}

The platter was the grilled chicken with potatoes and veggies. I substituted more potatoes instead of the veggies. Their were 2 pieces of chicken on the thinner side but seasoned really really good. I think I was expecting more of a store bought size but again they tasted good and it was plenty. Maybe they pounded it?\n\nMy friend got the flatbread chicken salad. It turned out to be a wrap and he loved it. \n\nAnother friend ordered a sandwich combo with mashers and a drink. I just remembered, the drink didn't arrive. Let's say it rolled out of the bag in the Grubhub dudes car?

And by nice, I mean a meal that looks like a steak dinner.\n\nSo I met up with my sis and aunt for lunch and here's what we shared:\n\nPOUTINE - $7.99\nAs soon as I saw this in the display I had to order it.  I don't often see poutine with pieces of steak.  Also, we were holding up the line because of our indecisiveness.  Yeah its one of those layouts where you better know what you're getting by the time you get to the cash register, otherwise you'll get the stink eye!  ANYWHO, yes, the poutine not only has the gravy and cheese curds (which wasn't much) but it was topped with a load of rare steak!  That was the best part! There's also some green onions on top but I think we ended up just eating the steak.  It was so tender and flavorful.  I think the gravy only made the whole dish a little saltier than I liked.  Poutine is the kind of dish you should eat fast unless you prefer your fries soggy and swimming in gravy.\n\nSIRLOIN PLATTER - $15.99\n2 thin slabs of Sirloin steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, cornbread, tiny corn on the cob, and grilled vegetables ( sweet potato, red bell pepper, zucchini, and potato, and meat juice).\nYou know, I was quite impressed when I saw this plate.  The sirloin is quite tender and tasty...everyone is quite decent.  My only complain is the corn on the cobb was dry and over cooked.  But besides that, for that price, it was a good amount of food!  It did take awhile though but hey, its not fast food right?  I know its not cooked to order but still.  Not too shabbeh is what I say!\n\nWe ended up with leftovers, and I overall enjoyed my meal.

That's what happened to us when we were wandering around Westfield's food court, looking for lunch.  As soon as we tried Buckhorn Grill's steak, we made a U-turn and got in line.  The restaurant was busy.\n\nBuckhorn specializes in char-roasted tri-tip steak.  Tri-tip is a cut of bottom sirloin which was originally marketed in Oakland.  Buckhorn uses Angus beef and ages it for 21 days.  The seasoned and marinated meat is charred over a wood fire and finished in a wood-smoked oven.  To me, it tastes like a very good cut of sirloin: savory, tender, and juicy.  For a food court, the meat quality is great.  Try a sample for yourself and see.\n\nThe restaurant sells tri-tip in multiple forms: sandwiches, salads, and by itself.  You can even take home a whole tri-tip for $24.95 ($5 off on Sundays) -- one feeds 5-6 people.  All tri-tip is cooked to medium rare unless otherwise specified.  For steak, prices are reasonable.  Sandwiches and salads are generally $8-9 each.  Platters are around 15 bucks each.\n\nI tried Buckhorn's \"Yik Yak\" ($7.99), which is one of the restaurant's most popular salads.  It consists of mixed greens, cabbage, jicama (Mexican turnip), red bell pepper, crispy pasta, snow peas, cilantro, celery, green onion, and slices of tri-tip tossed with a sweet sesame dressing and topped with toasted almonds.  The salad is served inside a soft tortilla.\n\nThe portion size is generous.  This salad will leave most people feeling full and satisfied.  The salad I had was fresh and crisp.  I liked the pear-like texture of the jicama.  The slices of tri-tip were cold.  The salad was a healthy choice, but if I were to eat here again, I'd probably order a hot tri-tip sandwich or entree.  The \"Little Buck\" sandwich looks great as the tri-tip is served with caramelized onions and au jus.\n\nService was speedy.  The staff have their SOPs down to a T.\n\nBuckhorn Grill currently has 12 locations: 10 in California and 2 in New York.  Several locations are in shopping centers.  One is in a train station (NY's Grand Central Station).  This location at Westfield San Francisco Centre has an open kitchen where you can see all the high-paced, feverish action.", "author": "Daniel B."}

Lots of blue cheese that drowned out the beans and lime dressing.\nRoadhouse buck ($8.99) - Delicious tri tip sandwich, seasoned well, medium rare, and stuffed to the max. The sauce provided was good standalone. Potato strings complementing this felt like they weren't made to order, something you can sometimes taste from a large chain like Outback/Chilis.

I can understand if someone orders a side of salad with their steak, but a full-sized salad for a meal instead? Sounds so silly! However, I'll admit that I'm one of those strangely odd people that eat meal-sized salads at Buckhorn Grill.\n\nBuckhorn makes a delicious and satisfying Krispy Chicken Salad. $9.50 is a bit expensive for a salad, but I assure you that Buckhorn's Krispy Chicken Salad is worth the hefty price tag. This salad includes fried chicken breast, chopped romaine lettuce, grape tomatoes, fresh avocado, and blue cheese crumbles, all tossed in a yummy honey lime vinaigrette that's to die for! The chicken isn't crispy; it's a bit dry, but overall it's still decent. The avocado is fresh and tomatoes are plump and juicy. The proportion of blue cheese crumbles is just right, not too much, which is important because blue cheese is very pungent. But the vinaigrette is the real star in this salad: it's tangy, sweet, and creamy, yet not too heavy. If Buckhorn sold this dressing in prepackaged bottled form, I would buy a bunch.\n\nBut of course I've also tried Buckhorn's main specialty -- their sirloin tri-tip. The doneness varies, but most of the time it's cooked medium rare. It's charred nicely on the outside and well-seasoned. The inside is juicy, moist, and so so so delicious. They often give out small samples dipped in au jus sauce.\n\nOverall, Buckhorn serves some good, though pricey food. The salads and tri-tip platters are large enough to share between two people (or maybe even one hungry person). But if you're looking for smaller options, the sandwiches will suffice. San Francisco's Westfield Shopping Center's food court definitely has good food selection. This puts other malls' food courts to shame.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

The green salad was pre-tossed with its own dressing before placing all the rest of the ingredients on top.  The thing that made this dressing stand out (besides all of the awesome ingredients)  was the dressing.  \n\nWe meant to ask them what kind of dressing it was but forgot to stop by before we left.

The flatbread was firm yet chewy. I chose a Caesar dressing because I didn't want the dressing to fight with the flavor of the Tri tip, and that turned out to be an excellent choice. \n\nOne complaint though. I couldn't believe they only had the dullest butter knives in the planet for us diners to eat this lovely steak salad. I get that we're in a food court and it might not be cool to have super sharp steak knives lying around for random people to grab.

He was working across the street at Moscone West so he took me to lunch at Buckhorn Grill.\n\nI ordered the Portabella Buck Sandwich which seemed pretty safe to me without the cheese and Romesco sauce (which contains mayo.) I even asked to add avocado. Sounds cool, right? Except that when my order came out, it was on a bun. I guess I assumed it would be on a toasted roll since their meat sandwiches came on a roll. The BF offered to take it back and exchange it for a roll but instead came back with this excessively large flatbread. He said that the guy couldn't put that sandwich on a roll for unexplained reasons. Ok, weird. But just as I was about to take a bite, we realized that they forgot to add avocado. So he brought it back for a second time. In my head I could feel myself drafting this review and deducting stars.\n\nThen I took a bite. OMG! The Portabella had this amazing flavor to it. I kinda hate to say it but it reminds me of back when I used to eat steak, there would be that bite of fat that you're not really supposed to eat but it taste so good. Disgusting, I know. But this mushroom somehow captured that essence in both flavor and texture. There's also this super smokey delicious BBQ sauce that is super addicting. I dipped my fries in that sauce and also added it to my \"sandwich.\" Yum!\n\nNeedless to say, I'm torn. Service was a bit spazzy but the food was pretty amazing.

And, about nine times out of ten, I go with the Tri-Tip Flatbread Wrap.  Hint - it is usually on special at $8.50 instead of $11 on Thursdays and Fridays.  \n\nThe Tri-Tip Flatbread is full of sliced tri-tip (usually very good - but some consistency issues - stay tuned), as well as blue cheese crumbles, lettuce, fresh mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and red onion.  The flatbread itself is somewhat like a soft pita, with whole wheat flour - very soft and chewy, but it usually holds up well.  If executed correctly, this is a delicious lunch.  I've never tried the salads, but they look very good with lots of good, fresh ingredients.   \n\nWhy three stars?  Well - about one out of every three times, the food looks like it's been put together indifferently, which for a wrap (noun, verb and adjective) is important.  There is a swing from visit to visit in terms of quality.  Sometimes, the meat serving is not particularly generous.  I've had a few occasions where the sliced cherry tomatoes are basically a bit frozen.  I tried the Hunter's Stew on my last visit (which, was tasty) but about a third of the meat was basically grizzle - which, for a $13 bowl of stew in a mall food court, is not acceptable.  I've also tried the Chicken Caesar Flatberead, and while it is an alright item for $8.50, it is definitely not work the $11 full price.  I'll also add - the Roadhouse Onions (basically a very long micro-thin jumble of onion strings in batter that do not seperate) are not good.  No flavor, all grease.  (And, I'm not a health nut who hates greasy food.)  I would never order them again.\n\nOverall - for a chain restaurant in a mall food court, it is pretty good.  Not great.  Not cheap for what it is.  I like the staff at this location, and visit consistently - I'm not one to complain at a restaurant.  But, just a bit too much of a quality swing, and the full price cost for the items I order the most are over-priced.", "author": "Adam S."}

I've been to a few of their locations so I know what to expect. Most recently, I tried an incredible gourmet burger topped with tri-tip at their Bay Street location and was hoping to experience the same here.  I've only been to Westfield a handful of times, so I have no real opinion of their food court other than its much larger than Metreon's. This particular Buckhorn is much smaller than some of their other locations such as Metreon, Emeryville, and Walnut Creek.\n\nThere's uniformity in Buckhorn's menu and its the same layout at all locations. I didn't see the burger topped with tri-tip, so I asked the cashier and sad to say, they do no have it at this location but she referred me down the street to Metreon. Hmm. Interesting. A bit disappointed but nonetheless, I ordered the Big Buck which is 6 oz. of their delicious angus beef smoked to a medium-rare finish. I skipped on the cheese and topped off my sando with caramelized onions. \n\nBuckhorn has reasonable prices with a Big Buck going for $8 plus tax with no drink or side included, but you can make it a meal for a few more bucks. Less than 10 minutes later, my pager was ringing and I had a Big Buck in front of me. The roll isn't toasted but is warm, yet I do wish they had the option to toast them. Nevertheless, the meat is what's important here and it always comes through. The tri-tip was smoked to a perfect medium-rare and was incredibly tender, all of which was topped with caramelized onions and BBQ sauce.\n\nI do like the consistency in food quality at every Buckhorn but I do wish they had all the items at every location. Given this prime location, Buckhorn should make every effort to carry all their special menu items, but I understand they're working within a tight space and may not be able to offer everything their counterparts offer. For what it's worth, a delicious tri-tip sandwich in downtown San Francisco for $8 simply can't be beat and is a must try. \n\nAmbiance/Decor: 3/5\nFood: 4/5\nService: N/A\nPrice: $$\nOverall: 3/5\n\nPros:\n+ Tri-tip is the name of the game\n+ Salads, sandwiches, burgers, all featuring tri-tip\n+ New items include flatbread salads w/ tri-tip\n+ Special menu items at various locations\n+ Big portions\n+ Beer and wine\n+ Reasonable prices\n+ Rewards program \n\nCons:\n- Menu specials not available at every location", "author": "Alexander E."}

Not this time though; not with paid for food chits sitting in my pocket.  \n\nHere's how it went down:\n\n1.  We sampled a few pieces of crack, er, tri-tip.\n\n2.  Jammer ordered up some sort of tri-tip and chicken combo surrounded by a sea of fresh roasted vegetables.  He polished it off with a beer and then had to untuck his shirt so that he could unbutton his pants.  Oink, oink.  \n\n3.  Weffster ordered up some sort of tri-tip sandwich with those shoestring thin fried onions, blue cheese, and a side of mashed potatoes with gravy.  He got through the mashers and was too full to eat much of the sandwich.  Mmmm... leftovers!\n\n4.  I got myself a salad that was piled so high with shoestring thin fried onions, blue cheese, tri-tip, walnuts, and lettuce, that it sat a good 6-inches off the plate.  Honest; the people we sat down beside felt compelled to comment on its size.  And I, dear Yelper, POLISHED THAT BABY OFF!!  It was dee-lish-ous!!!\n\nAnd, thanks to those Groupons, we got all of that for $20.\n\nBuckhorn may not be the fanciest joint around (it's in a food court, after all), but the food is solid, filling, reasonably priced, cheap with Groupons, and really, really good.  Also, take note, if you eat here often, they offer some sort of $10 gift certificate for every $100 spent. \n\nThey even sell bottles of wine for $13.99.  Where you gonna find a deal like that?", "author": "Tracey A."}

My bf and I always order the small plate to share because their portions are decent.  For $8.99, you get 4 slices (1/2\" thick, 2-3\" diameter) of deliciously flavored meat.  The cashier always ask me if medium-rare is alright and I want to shout \"It better be!\"  PLEASE do not get it cooked anymore than medium-rare!  The slices are served atop a generous helping of thin fried \"Roadhouse\" onions with a cup of hot au-jus and creamy horseradish for dipping.  I normally have a hard time with horseradish sauce but the Buckhorn version is mild enough that I can see how this enhances the flavor of tri-tip.  \n\nThe reason we order the small plate is so we have stomach room to try other items.  Their clam chowder is satisfying and comes with a nice little roll and butter.  Sometimes we make a mini tri-tip roll with this. \n\nRecently, I tried the Bacon Cheddar Buck, which is a sandwich with thinly-sliced tri-tip, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese and red ranch sauce tucked into a sweet french roll.  It was delicious, especially dipped in the au jus.  \n\nBonus - I get emails about the monthly specials and November's deal was a burger for $5.99.  However, the Buckhorn located in the Westfield San Francisco Centre Food Emporium does not serve burger sand was offering any sandwich instead for  $5.99.  The Bacon Cheddar Buck is def. worth this, but I wouldn't pay full price ($7.99).\n\nThe tri-tip is never anything short of delicious and is always a must when I eat at this food court. =D", "author": "Jennifer T."}

The tri-tip sample was juicy and tasty... Maybe a little too salty? Oh well, it was free!\n\nI opted to get the Cabo Chop salad ($7.99) and added grilled chicken ($2.50). I ordered it to-go just in case I had leftovers. After paying, they gave me a pager for when my food would be ready. Since my sister had already gotten her food (from Coriander Thai), we went to go hunt down a table. On a Sunday evening, it was pretty busy, but we didn't have to go table-stalking and pounce once a table opened up. We found a nice clean table for two and then my pager went off!\n\nMy order was all ready to go in a plastic container put inside a Buckhorn Grill baggy. However, when I went to the table, I noticed they didn't put any utensils in there! So, I got up and went to go get some silverware from the counter. Trying to be healthy, I asked for the dressing on the side and drizzled a bit over my salad. The honey-lime dressing was slightly sweet and nicely refreshing. For the price (of course, food-court fare in this mall is slightly inflated), the serving size was fair. It was a massive entree-sized portion of romaine lettuce, jicama sticks, slices of radish, black beans, corn, baby tomatoes, crumbled blue cheese, and half an avocado!\n\nThe chicken was tasty, nicely seasoned, and moist (not dry like some other places)! Everything else looked and tasted fresh!

YES, YES, YES; YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!!!\n\nBuckhorn is one of the best options at the Westfield Food Court in terms of quality, pricing, and taste. I frequent Buckhorn about once a week and the food has ALWAYS been consistent. \n\nMy Go-Tos are the following:\n\n*Cabo Chop Salad w/ Tri-Tip (Romaine lettuce with avocado, black beans, corn, jicama, radishes, tomatoes and blue cheese dressed in a honey-lime dressing and placed in a crispy tortilla bowl): MY FAV!!!  The romaine is lightly dressed and then the remaining ingredients are piled up high. The ingredients are always fresh and vibrant in color. The tri-tip is tender and very well-seasoned. The blue cheese and honey-lime dressing work well in adding a savory, sweet, and tangy flavor which I love! Break off a piece of the tortilla bowl for that *CRUNCH*!\n\n*Roadhouse Salad w/ Tri-Tip (Mixed greens with crispy Roadhouse onions, string beans, tomatoes, bleu cheese crumbles & sweet Mariani walnuts tossed w/ honey basil vinaigrette): Although it's probably one of the most unhealthiest salads you can probably eat, it's also one of the most YUMMIEST! It has all the combination of flavors and textures you can ask for. The savory and salty from the Tri-Tip, the crisp from the Roadhouse onions (yummy shoe string onions), the tang from blue cheese and the sweet from the candied walnuts and honey vinaigrette. \n\nFor the salads, request that the tri-tip be sliced into cubes and not strips b/c it will make it a whole lot easier to eat! BTW, they don't skimp on the meat portions!\n\n*Roadhouse Buck (Tri-tip with Roadhouse Onions & Red Ranch sauce topped with bleu cheese crumbles). HOLY MOLY!!! This is one of the BEST tasting sandwiches EVER!!!! The 6 oz. tri-tip is sliced thick, cooked medium rare, tender and very well-seasoned. As you bite into it, you can taste all the juices still flowing out of it (no au jus needed). Ahhhhh!!! I love blue cheese esp with red meat....and in this case it adds a tangy, creaminess to the sandwich while the Roadhouse onions add that crisp and the red ranch a spicy kick. \n\nThey normally prepare the tri-tip medium rare, but you can always request it to be cooked further to a medium, medium-well, and well. \n\nPRICES: Very reasonable considering the massive portions. \n*Sandwiches are about $6.95. For an additional $2.45 you can get fries, mashers, Roadhouse Onions, or a salad and a drink. \n*Salads are about $7-9 and you can add chicken or tri-tip for $2.50 or salmon for $3.00.\n*Platters (meat and sides) are about $13.\n*Whole tri-tip to take home is $19.95!!!!\n\nSERVICE: Fast and friendly. They give you a pager while they're preparing your food, so take this time to find seating. During peak hours, it takes about 5-7 minutes to get your food.\n\nNothing can come between this girl and a good piece of red meat, so I will be back AGAIN, AGAIN, and AGAIN!!!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I've had just about everything up and down Powell Street over the years (Pizza, Mexican, Thai, American) and decided to stop by the Westfield Food Court since I don't come to downtown that often anymore and there are plenty of food choices down there. \n\nOne of the first places that caught my eye was Buckhorn Grill.   I took a sample of the tri-tip and was impressed.  After scoping out my other options, I decided Buckhorn Grill would be my choice.   \n\nAs I was in a bit of rush, I ordered a Philly Buck, with Red Mashers and a drink.  That set me back about $12 or so.  I took the order to go just in case I couldn't find a place to sit.   Alas, if anyone knows Westfield, it is PACKED and since I was by myself, trying to find a quiet place for yourself to eat was a little difficult.  I ultimately decide to take my order to my destination (about a 10 minute walk away from Westfield) and ate my order there. \n\nSo while my order wasn't as fresh as it could have been, I had no qualms about that aspect.  From a taste perspective,  I was a little disappointed in my Philly Buck.  The sandwich was a little saltier than I expected.  This may be due to the fact they were busy and tons of orders  were coming in and the cooks didn't have time to measure the right amount of salt.   The meat, onions and peppers were alright but I may have to eat the sandwich as soon as it's done instead of waiting to give it a true measurement. \n\nThe one pleasant surprise was the \"Red Mashers\" (or mashed potatoes).  Due to waiting for a few minutes before I ate, the gravy wasn't quite as good as it could have been.  But the mashed potatoes still rated high in my book.  It was lumpy and that's how I like my mashed potatoes.  \n\nOverall, I'll give Buckhorn Grill 3 Stars.  The sandwich wasn't great but I'll definitely give it another shot in the future to see if my initial taste was an aberration.  Of course, I'll be adding a side of mashed potatoes to that order!  :)", "author": "Donald L."}

I had a craving for steak and onion rings, so I decided to try the small plate char-roasted sirloin tri-tip at Buckhorn Grill. It most definitely exceeded my expectations. It was the perfect amount of steak, roasted to tender, juicy perfection. They looked a bit too red, but to my surprise, I didn't find them to be too rare at all- just super soft and flavorful. It came served on a plate of crispy shoe-string onions and this AMAZING creamy horseradish dip. Totally hit the spot AND for less than 9 bucks. Crazy. \n\nSo far, I've never gone wrong with anything from the Westfield food court (waaay beyond any normal mall food court), and my experience at Buckhorn Grill completely reinforced my enthusiasm for this place.", "author": "Jessie C."}

The total comes out to about $11.\n\nThe reason why I am giving this place only a 3 star is because they have dramatically DECREASED their salad portions to almost half what it used to be and kept the same prices. I feel unjustified to pay $11 for a plate of veggies that no longer fills you up as a meal. Even for san francisco this is expensive for mall food, given the portion. I've heard from other people that they have been testing out portion sizes so you get less food for more money. I really hope that they go back to their previous portion sizes or else I will never come here again when there are so many cheaper options around.", "author": "Cecile S."}

The beef is juicy, somewhat tender, and and has good flavor.  Portions are pretty big too. I would even go as far to say that their food quality can be compared to some lower end restaurants.  However, you may pay more than most other food options in the Metreon or Westfield food courts.  As a result, I eat here sparingly.\n\nThey have burgers and sandwhiches too which I hope to try next time as well as main salad options that are a little cheaper than the plates.  \n\nGive them a shot and see if the price is worth it.

I like her because the last half of her name is my name, how could I not?  We had a very nice time at lunch in the busy food court at Westfield.  \n\nI had the Roadhouse Buck ($6.45) which is \"thick sliced tri-tip with Roadhouse Onions & Red Ranch sauce topped with bleu cheese crumbles\".  The onions are very thinly sliced, battered and fried onion rings.  The sauce, yummy.  The cheese, perfect compliment.  The onions, well I ordered a \"combo\" and had more than enough for two people!  With the drink, it was $11 and change.  Like I said before, it is a bit pricey for lunch out everyday at this food court.  The sandwich is messy, very messy...but oh so good.  \n\nCan you say food coma?

Seriously, it is fast food, but it is quite hefty price wise and portion wise.  For the combo platter (chicken & tri-tip), I paid $13.95.  The soda was 1.95 on top of that.  So, in essence, I paid as much for lunch as I would at a sit-down restaurant.  Yet, after collecting my meal, I had to bum-rush a girl for a table.  How inelegant?

It was a sort of tangy yet citrusy dressing that went well with the grilled chicken. There were pieces of tomatoes, blue cheese and avocados. My bf's sandwich wasn't too great.

They're known for tri-tip sandwiches. Other branches guarantee your food will be ready 5 minutes after you order it. I didn't see any of those signs here, and I think that guarantee would bankrupt this one quickly. In fact, they give you a beeper when you order so you'll know when it's ready.\n\nThe tri-tip is tasty. So is their bacon. The fried onion strings are good only if they've just been cooked; otherwise, they're lifeless and flavorless, but still really, really bad for you.", "author": "Timothy O."}

Mexican? Thai?  Japanese?  Italian?  With a veritable United Nations of food available, you can't help but keep circling back and forth, looking at what everyone is eating and trying to decide what your meal should be.  Buckhorn makes it easy by actually giving you a fairly large sample of their tri-tip and thin oinion rings.   And so, that was how I was seduced into trying out their sandwiches, because their tri-tip was surprisingly good\n\nI tried their Bacon Cheddar Buck, which is their tri-tip with bacon and cheddar.  At $6.95 for the sandwich alone, it is a little pricey.  The sandwich is kinda on the small side, though it does make a good mouthful.  I really liked the tri-tip and their savory mayonnaise, but the bacon was hard, rather than being crisp.  The tri-tip is cooked medium to medium-well, so its not as tender as it could be.  It is sliced thinly for the sandwiches, so it doesn't really get all up in your teeth.  I think that next time, I'm going for their regular tri-tip sandwich.\n\nFor an extra $2.22, you can make the meal a combo and get a drink and a side.  I tried out their Roadhouse onions, which are the thin onion rings.  Very tasty, but some of the onions were pretty oily and limp.  They're great with some ranch dressing and BBQ sauce, but I think I might blot them with some paper napkins first the next time I eat them.\n\nOverall, a good pick for lunch in the Food Emporium.  At just under $10 for the meal, its comparable to the other available food options.", "author": "Angela H."}

I live near Westfield and it is incredibly convenient to grab a dinner salad at Buckhorn Grill and head home.  The salads are amazing.  I've had the Roadhouse (ask for mixed greens with the tri tip) and the Yik Yak with salmon.  The Roadhouse is by no means healthy, its the best thing when you feel like you should order a salad but you really want a burger.  Yik Yak is perfect when you want the crispness and coolness of a good, veggie packed salad.  Generally, I am not a fan of iceburg lettuce but it works in this salad because of the cabbage and the crunch. The portions of these salads are large and filling, well worth the $10.  The ingredients are fresh and the dressings are really good.  \n\nI have to deduct one star for the one time I ordered a sandwich instead of a salad.  I ordered the philly sandwich and added mushrooms. The sandwich was quite small and the bread did not really seem fresh.

We were just around the corner from the Westfield Mall, so I suggested the food court there because they have some pretty good options. At 8:30pm, the food court was still very busy, but we didn't have to look around for a table. We passed by a women who was having a giant chicken salad in what looked like a tostada shell. It was large enough for 2 of us to share, so we asked her where she got it from. She directed us to Buckhorn Grill and told us to order the Yik Yak salad. The menu listed the ingredients as: An oriental salad with south of the border flair; a crisp mix of greens, cabbages, jicama, snow peas, water chestnuts, tossed with sweet sesame dressing & topped with toasted almonds. It sounded delicious, so we ordered it and added chopped chicken. For $10, it was the perfect light meal for 2. What we thought was a tostada was actually a tomato flour tortilla, which was good to wrap the salad in. \r\n\r\nYesterday, I stopped by again and had the Roadhouse Buck sandwich, which is a thick sliced tri-tip sandwich with onions, ranch and bleu cheese for $7. It was a generous portion of steak and fried onion strings were pouring out of the sandwich. The sandwich was just as delicious as the Yik Yak salad, so it seems like most of the items here are pretty good.", "author": "Connie C."}

The service here is fast the line moved rather quickly...we ordered the Roadhouse Salad to share, the salads are huge!! I don't think one person can finish it, its stacked piled high.. the roadhouse salad had a nice vinaigrette, so tasty and it was piled high with their roadhouse onions.. I ordered a small plate of their char-roasted sirloin tri-tip with au jus and hore radish ssauce on the side.. it was a perfect size for me, I finished it all.. and I must say it was soo delish, the tri tip was nice and tender and really went well with horseradish sauce..(i love horse radish sauce!!! My mouth is just watering right now as I think about their tri-tip.) My bf ordered the same altho the larger portion, which comes with mash potatoes, veggies, bread, and of course tri-tip, and our friend ordered the same. We were in the very pleased with our food, so tasty and fulfilling!! I just found my new fav. spot at the food court!! Drinks here are free refill so that is a major plus!

A miix of greens, cabbages, jicama, red peppers, snow peas, tossed with sweet sesame dressing (there is a little spice to it!) & topped with toasted almonds all inside a tortilla wrap in a bowl ($6.95 + $2.50 for tri tip or chicken).

We ended up getting a tri-tip dad's cut which was 10oz of beef that came with mashed potatoes, fire roasted veggies and bread.  It was a huge portion and we both split it.  We also had a order of their large fries.  The food was delicious because it really was delicious or we were just really hungry from so much walking around in the city.  The food came out decently fast and you can help yourself to condiments.  The only negative....the ranch which I use for french fries was watered down.  I would for sure come back here again if I am in the area and feeling for some beef!", "author": "James T."}

Initially lured by the delicious tri tip samples, I decided to order the fruit and nut salad with honey lime dressing and blue cheese sprinkles with tri-tip. it was fantastic; the salad contained sliced strawberries, apples, and bits of dried apricots and plenty of finely sliced beef.

Its tossed in a nice subtle vinaigrette and served with a big mound of fried onion straws.  I actually cant finish this salad as its so massive.  The price is reasonable too!  It was $6.95 for the salad itself and an additional $3 for the tri-tip.  The tri-tip is very flavorful and succulent.  Its cooked correctly to a medium rare and really compliments the vinaigrette.  Their counter help was really polite and provided great service.  This is always a sure stop for me when I'm at the SF mall.", "author": "Henry S."}

I brought his up though and said, This is kinda fatty. That's all it took and boom they gave me a big, thick new slice for him. That was good.

I  went to the Buckhorn Grill prepared to try their Ultimate Veggie Sandwich, but when I placed my order, they told me that it would not be ready for another 15 minutes. I panicked because I didn't know what else to order. Hard to make decisions like that on the spot--and the line of people waiting behind me only added to the pressure. I was thinking of leaving for another place, but the person made me feel better by saying \"Take your time\". I eventually ordered the Roadhouse salad just because I had heard my friend order it--had no idea what I was ordering--just wanted to get some food and find a place to sit. Anyway, he ended up giving me a 70 cents off my order and a free drink for the inconvenience. That was smart customer service. 70 cents is not too much money, but the fact that he apologized and made an effort to correct the situation was impressive. The salad was huge and had onion rings on top. It was decent, but the dressing was a little sweeter than what I'm used to.  I am writing more to comment on their customer service.
