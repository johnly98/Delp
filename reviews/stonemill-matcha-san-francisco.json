Next time, I would probably get my drink to go.\n\nThough not all the food items have matcha added to them the drinks definitely do. It was hard choosing a drink, but I defaulted to my usual latte (iced). I also ended up getting a matcha croissant to share with friends.\n\nThe matcha latte had a nice rich matcha flavor. I could have one of these everyday of the year. The croissant looked beautifully made but was quite disappointing. All my friends agreed that we couldn't really taste the matcha flavor.

The tea itself is a smoked green that tastes similar to genmaicha, but so so smooth and tasty when mixed with the milk. Must try! \n\nIced matcha latte ($4.50) 5/5\nAgain, a delicious drink! They got the ratio of milk to matcha perfect! (Most places either too much or too little milk resulting in diluted tasteless mess).\n\nMatcha pie ($5.50/slice) 3.5/5\nThis slice had 2 layers: the matcha layer at the bottom half and the whipped cream layer on top. Similar to a meringue pie or a light whipped pie in texture. Bottom layer was deliciously matcha flavored with good amount of sweetness. However, the top layer, which we thought had a hint of yuzu and some other fruit, was waaay too sweet and ruined the composition of the pie for us...\n\nKatsu sando ($14) 2.5/5\nTo say the least-expensive for 3 small halves served in a cute basket. The tonkatsu was not as tender as we'd hoped, and the sauce a little overpowering. Not a bad sandwich, but your experience here would not be diminished without! \n\nWould probably come here to catch up with friends/hang out but too crowded and pricey to make it a daily routine.", "author": "Robin Y."}

When you get inside you have to queue again and (there's a sign that says this) you order, find a seat and put your number on the table. No savesies for tables before ordering. Thank goodness a lot of people were doing takeout so after we ordered we were able to get a table right away.\n\nWe ordered so much that it was almost comical to see two girls with ALL these dishes but what can I say? We were hungry and wanted to try everything! We had:\n\nHojicha Latte (hojita, milk and cane sugar): I tried this and this was refreshing (she ordered it cold).\n\nGinger Matcha Latte (matcha, fresh ginger, fresh milk and cane sugar): I like matcha lattes but I think the ginger was slightly overpowering and could hardly taste the matcha. \n\nSesame Sponge Cake: I'd heard good things about the sponge cake and it did not disappoint. I'm not a fan of desserts or pastries but when I do eat them I like the Asian version, ie not so sweet. I could taste the slight sweetness and black sesame.\n\nMatcha Cream Pie: The pie was really good! The cream on top was amazing and the matcha underneath was slightly sweet which made everything perfect with the flaky crust.\n\nMatcha Croissant: Huge, flaky and buttery croissant with matcha flavor. This didn't quite work for me but I was glad I tried it.\n\nCheesecake: I am not a fan of cheesecake but tried this, to me this was just cheesecake but not as sweet as other cheesecakes.\n\nGoat cheese pizza: I guess in our excitement we wanted to try the pizza but it was just meh for us. It was heated up but it still lacked flavor and crunchiness that a pizza should have in the crust.\n\nKatsu Sando (pork cutlet, tonkatsu sauce and cabbage): This was my favorite thing on the menu. Crunchy pork cutlet and  cabbage in between two pieces of soft white bread with crusts cut off.....WOW.\n\nMatchazuke (rice, salmon, nori, green onion, chicken dashi and matcha):  When they bring this out they pour the matcha and chicken dashi over the rice and what happens is a bowl of comfort food. Salmon is perfectly cooked and goes really well with the rice and soup/matcha. I could taste the matcha and it went well with the whole dish.\n\nEverything was IG worthy so of course we had to take tons of pictures. That's what I love about Japanese food - sometimes it's so pretty I can't  bear to eat it.\n\nService was quick and efficient, they were hustling to get us our dishes as fast as possible so we could leave in a timely manner. They didn't rush us out of the cafe but we appreciated their attention to us whenever we needed anything and didn't have to wait around.\n\nI was definitely impressed at the quality of all the items we ordered.

Delicious, savory, and filling.\n\nNote to self - Must come back again because I skipped out on the many signature items like matcha items (duh), lattes (duh again), yuzu meringe tart, and hoji-cha.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-17", "description": "Around 4:00 pm on a Saturday, the line was out the door at Stonemill and the limited seating was completely full. Undeterred, I waited in the line (which the cashiers did a great job at working through very quickly) and ordered my food to eat-in, in the hopes that a table would open up.\n\nI went with the iced hojicha latte ($4.50), katsu sando ($14.00!), kinako butter chocolate chip cookie ($3.00), and hot matcha latte ($5.00). In an effort to combat people saving tables, Stonemill asks that guests dining in order first, receive a number, and then take the number to an open table. I got my number but had to wait at one of the standing counters until a table opened up and I swooped on it. Be prepared for this to be your reality, as well (unless you're lucky enough to drop by when it's not so busy), which I really don't care for. Seating anxiety isn't something I look forward to when I'm just trying to enjoy an afternoon snack. I will give Stonemill credit, though, for asking that guests not use laptops at tables from 10:00 am - 4:00 pm.\n\nMy order came out shortly after I landed a table. The hojicha latte was really good and not at all too sweet, which I was worried about. I appreciate that they offer an iced version. The cookie was TINY for $3.00, and while it was quite good it really didn't taste any different than any other salted chocolate chip cookie I've had, so I feel like the price wasn't justified here. And speaking of ridiculous prices, that katsu sandwich (because God, do I hate the word \"sando\") is NOT worth $14.00. The katsu is cooked well and coated in a delicious katsu sauce, but the ingredients consisted of simply white sandwich bread, katsu, and lettuce. For one person it would be just satisfying enough, but sharing between two people just kept our stomachs from rumbling as opposed to feeling full. I had no complaints about the sandwich itself, I'm just failing to see the reason for its price.\n\nI'm not a matcha fiend and don't totally get the hype around it (it's good but it feels like the hype is due to it being yet another food fad), but the latte was tasty and had a delicate flavor. But as my boyfriend got to the end he said the flavor became bitter, which he suspects may have been due to sediment settling at the bottom of the cup.\n\nOverall, everything about Stonemill, from their decor aesthetic to their food, is lovely, and it's clear that quality ingredients are being used, but this is a pricey place with a somewhat stressful seating situation that takes from the enjoyment of going to a cafe to get an afternoon latte and a snack. Everything was delicious and I'd order it all again, not to mention that there are a number of desserts and pastries I still want to try. Just be aware that if you're coming at a peak time you may be standing around waiting for a table to open up before you can sit down and enjoy your food and drink.", "author": "Angela M."}

Coming here on a Saturday afternoon only added to the frenzy of the crowd. I get it this place is the \"hot and new\" matcha place in SF. Firstly cause its new and secondly cause we don't really have any pure Matcha purpose shop in SF until this and Cafe Maiko opened. While our sister LA has been spoiled with such great Matcha stores for a while. \n\nAnyway back on target. The 1st time I came here we got Matcha and Hojicha Lattes and a matcha pastry and the item with rice drizzled in matcha sauce with salmon on top (sorry forgot the name). Both the matcha and hojicha lattes were terribly underwhelming. You couldn't taste any distinct taste from them. If you handed me either drink without telling me what it was, I wouldn't be able to guess Matcha or Hojicha. The rice bowl with salmon that was pretty good. I remember the salmon being nice and tender. The rice and matcha sauce didn't really have strong flavors but that salmon was gooood. \n\nSo recently I came back here on a Friday afternoon after doing light hiking at Corona Heights. I was nearby and thought hey I'll give Stonemill another try. I struggled with parking so parked across the street in the no parking zone and ran inside to find....a line! At 3pm on a friday theres a line! Don't these people have to be somewhere?? (though I could as myself the same thing :/ ) So this time I got a Matcha cream pie and Hojicha Latte again on my second visit. I thought second times a charm I'm sure it might be different than the first. Nope. The Hojicha latte tasted just as bland as the last time. The matcha cream pie had a great crispy texture but the matcha flavoring was horribly bland. The cream even tasted slightly like lemon which is strange cause cream should have a fluffy empty taste to it to compliment the pie. \n\nAnyways I've only been here two times and I've haven't experienced the whole menu so maybe theres something that regulars are experiencing that I'm not.

At the Newark, CA location, it cost $2.9 without any additional bells and whistles.\n- The Matcha Pie runs out fast. It's like you have to be here no later than 1pm to get a slice.

The cream puff had the harder crispier shell instead of the softer one that you get at like Beard Papa's, and the matcha cream comes allll the way out to give you extra matcha-lovin'! Very delicious and great for sharing as well. I definitely would recommend both the matcha latte and cream puff!", "author": "Jennifer W."}

That is a definite must order if you're here. We got here on Saturday around 12pm, so pretty much the prime time for brunch. There aren't many tables and seating considering the amount of people who come here, but don't sit down until you have ordered your food for dine in. The servers will ask you for your number that you place on the table. \n\nI also ordered the matcha iced drink and a honey roll. You can ask for varying sugar sweetness which is always a plus. They handed us a table number and we waited for about 5 minutes before a table cleared up. We had to sort of hoover just in case someone else swooped in. We combined two tables eventually for our group. The pie like I said was amazing! It was the perfect proportion of matcha cream and regular cream. The crust was very flaky almost like a croissant. The honey bun was actually pretty hard but also pretty tasty as well! SF ordered their kotsu sandwich after we tried our baked goods since he was still a bit hungry. He regretted doing that because that sandwich was so deceivingly filling! I took a couple bites and that chicken was thick. All it needed was a bit of sauce and it would have been perfect. Can't wait to come back for that slice of matcha pie!", "author": "Ada C."}

It was not very strongly matcha-flavored, though.\n\nOverall, we got 3 lattes (each with almond/oat milk for +$1), 2 matchazuke, 1 katsu sando, and 1 yuzu tart.

When my friend first recommended this matcha specialty shop to me, I knew I just had to go, and when I went not 3 days after hearing about it, I was not disappointed!\n\nFirst off, the drinks and food are all amazing (at least what I've tried so far). The Hojicha Latte is a bit on the thicker, heavier side, but is very aromatic and definitely made with freshly brewed tea. The Matcha Latte is great as either iced and hot and is naturally my go-to drink.\n\nMy friend and I had a brunch fest here some Sunday and ordered the Katsu Sando (Fried Pork Cutlet Sandwich), Matchatsuke, Matcha Cream Puff, as well as the Yuzu Matcha Meringue. Although all of them tasted great, I think the Katsu Sando was our favorite, as it just tasted very homemade, like something you would get for lunch as a child. The Matchatsuke was very unique and the flavor was very light. The salmon was cooked to perfection and peels right off with a light touch of the fork. The matcha broth was bitter but not overly so and complimented the salmon well. I have a terrible sweet tooth, so I loved the Yuzu Matcha for the tart flavor and the Matcha Cream Puff for the sweet matcha taste (beats Beard Papa's in my opinion)! I've also ordered their Matcha White Chocolate Cookie for the road and that cookie is very decadent and softly baked, just the way I like my cookies! They also top this cookie off with some dried crunchy rice grains, which surprisingly compliments the white chocolate and brings out the matcha flavor of the cookie as well.\n\nThe ambiance of this shop varies, depending on what day of the week or time you go-- It's very quiet and nice to work in during the wee morning hours, but the later in the day it gets, the more crowded and louder it usually becomes. The shop definitely tries to accommodate for this type of heavy customer traffic, but I think the seats could be spaced out a tiny bit more, especially at the bench table seats.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place to try and if you can, to come and enjoy the early morning ambiance before the crowds come in.", "author": "Victoria W."}

And surely at 11 am, there was already a small line forming in front of the door. While I was in line, I was worried we wouldn't get a table because there were a lot of people waiting for a seat. Luckily, my boyfriend found a seat outside.\nBecause this was our first time, we decided to order a little more than usual. My boyfriend wanted to try the katsu-sando (pork cutlet sandwich). He had some in Japan and wanted to compare. I wanted to know what the hype was for the matchazuke. For a side, I ordered a cream puff and we each ordered a drink: Hojicha latte and mizudashi (genmaicha). \n\nKatsu-sando: Sandwich was pretty good. There's three sandwich inside a basket. The ears on the bread are cut off and a pretty big katsu is used. The only thing I didn't like about it was that they used too much tonkatsu sauce. I don't really like the strong taste, but this is probably preference and I'm sure some people love it.\n\nMatchazuke: Pretty expensive for what you get. My boyfriend thought it would be bigger. There's salmon on top with nori and green onion on top. The waiter poured the matcha dashi on top for us and left some wasabi. Very comforting flavor and light compared to the katsu-sando. Good for light eaters, but not for someone who eats a lot. You can not to-go this.\n\nHojicha latte: Solid latte. It had the distinct hojicha flavor and it wasn't overly milky. It came in a nice cup. Next time I do want to take it out to-go. \n\nOur bill ended up being over 50$. It's a pricey place so I don't see myself going here a lot to eat. More like every now and then or on a special occasion. However, if I am around, I would pick up a latte. The struggles to find the table on the weekend was pretty bad and if it means to eat at the park, I wouldn't mind.", "author": "Kiyomi K."}

I couldnt taste the matcha. The croissant was just too soft, like not flaky enough.\n\nMatchazuke: Salmon, rice and matcha broth. Yes this sounds very weird, I admit. I thought so too. But my friend swore to me that it was worth a try so I went for it and I'm glad I did. It's a savory dish. The matcha broth is an interesting twist, in a good way.

My new weekday haven, where I can meditate and feel centered with some matcha before beginning the workday. Stonemill Matcha would appear designed to be a quiet intimate spot for reading, relaxing, or hanging out with a small number of people. But during peak hours, the cafe bustles with people squeezing to find standing room. It's a little jarring and definitely ruins the serenity one would typically associate with a delicate cup of matcha. \n\nThe Experience: You walk inside to be first invited in by a display of handcrafted ceramics atop a long bar. Along this bar sit lines of Matcha pastries, amongst them matcha croissants, cream puffs, soft and buttery matcha white-chocolate chip cookies, and matcha creme pie. The warm matcha-color glows against the slate colored bar, where you place an order and find a seat. There are a few tables outside as well, framed by a few plants and succulents, where you can sip on your latte and watch the eclectic locals of the Mission hurry by.\n\nThe Magic: It all comes down to the details that quietly shine through at Stonemill. Each item is served in a ceramic vessel designed for that particular dish -- a pleasant pairing of color and feel which culminates in a perfect tasting experience. And what stands out the most is how honest the cafe feels. The Matcha is whipped in front of you, the local artists behind the ceramics are showcased, you can purchase the traditional whisks and even the imported Matcha. Every ingredient to the final experience of sipping on that Matcha Latte feels transparent, which lends itself to a sense of security. Stonemill achieves its namesake: making its patrons feel at ease, grounded.\n\nThe Tips:\n-- Don't go during peak hours! I've heard weekends are a hot mess, though I've never dared venture here on the weekends. Many open tables on weekday mornings until 3pm.\n-- Matcha Creme Pie may actually be sent from the heavens. Typically creme pies are rich and sit heavy due to low quality cream. This feels like gently whipped custard -- like a fluffy French-style mousse -- that balances well in texture with the Matcha creme beneath. The crust is also absurd.\n-- Chicken oyaku is the perfect remedy for a cold (or hangover!) Order for take-out and ferry it to your lover for relationship bonus points ;P", "author": "Jessica M."}

While the main focus here is matcha, many of their items are also great as well.  The cafe itself surprisingly isn't too noisy, despite how busy it gets.  Seating can be difficult on weekends though as this place gets quite busy.  The hours here are a bit limited as they currently close at 6pm each day.  \n\nOn a Friday around 5pm, the crowd wasn't too bad here, getting a seat was pretty stress-free.  However, on a Saturday afternoon, this place had a pretty big line and given that it's free seating here, you might find yourself having trouble getting a table, especially with many parties sitting here well after they've finished eating.  If you're coming here with a party bigger than 2, you may find it difficult to get a table. \n\nOverall, I really loved the food here, it had a very authentic Japanese flavor with some unique twists.  I'll definitely be back for more!\n\nKatsu Sando:\nReally awesome to get a fresh pork cutlet sandwich.  The pork was very lean with little to no fat.  There was a bit of cabbage in it, overall it was a pretty traditional katsu sandwich.  The breading had a slight sweetness to it that was a little different but in a good way.  The tonkatsu sauce was on point as well.\n\nMatchazuke:\nThe most passable of the savory items I had here.  It was still great, but for the price, I'm not sure if I would get it again.  It came with a decent sized piece of salmon and the matcha dashi was great, but compared to the other two, it wasn't as impressive.  But don't get me wrong, this was a fantastic chazuke that is maybe worth trying if you're a fan of the dish.\n\nChicken Okayu:\nSuper flavorful, I only got to sample this one, but it was addictively good.  The egg was really runny and the porridge was very flavorful.  Everything about this dish was great, probably my favorite of the entree-like dishes.\n\nPork Chashu Danish:\nLooks can be deceiving, for those that eat more with their eyes, they'll probably pass on this one, but boy does this one pack a load of flavors into one pastry.  This was an incredible savory danish.  There was slightly fatty bacon like pieces of chashu along with some greens and onions.  If you're looking for a memorable pastry, this one is the one.\n\nStonemill Cake:\nThis cake was great if you like black sesame.  Like most things black sesame, the flavor is very potent.  The frosting layer is also a bit on the sweet side.  Overall, not bad if you have a sweet tooth or enjoy black sesame.\n\nSparking Yuzu Matcha:\nI preferred this over the more traditional matcha drinks.  It always surprises me how well citrus goes with matcha.  I also don't see yuzu used enough as an ingredient around the Bay Area so it was great to see it available here.  This drink is mildly carbonated with a really refreshing quality.\n\nMatcha Latte (iced):\nVery smooth.  Much better than your Starbucks matcha (obviously).  It was a solid matcha latte that was also very creamy.  \n\nReally a big fan of this place.  It hit the mark on pretty much everything in terms of food.

The bread was extra thick and very fluffy with the crust carefully cut off.  There seemed to be just the right amount of tonkatsu sauce since the sandwich was never dry, but never dripped either.  The meager bit of finely chopped cabbage was just right to add an accent, without dominating.\n\nMatcha Cream Pie: I actually started my meal with the pie since it was handed to me when I ordered.  Every meal should start with pie though!  It had the exact right texture of a good chocolate cream pie.  Except, of course, that the base was a very sweet and heavy umami matcha.  Paired especially well with the dense buttery crust (normally I'm not a big fan of pie crust).\n\nSparkling Matcha w/ Yuzu & Cane Sugar: Very refreshing.  Not chalky at all (despite the dark green cloudy appearance).  The sugar and yuzu almost made it feel like a Japanese Arnold Palmer.", "author": "Adam B."}

I only wish it was closer to SoMa or downtown. \n\nExpect a line and don't expect to get a table. There is no WiFi, but people still can work there--i used XFinity WiFi and saw hot spots. I heard some business deals going on at the table next to me, and some people stood and eat (there were some places where people could stand with no chairs.) \n\nThe menu is a bit pricey, but unique and good. I tried the Yuzu Meringue tart. I'm not sure if I would get it again--it was an interesting blend of flavors, and the meringue overwhelmed the matcha flavor. It is, however, very Instagrammable. I'd recommend the Sparkling Matcha with Yuzu--I've never seen something like that on any other matcha place's menu. It was cool and refreshing. \n\nOther reviews say the service was great, but I found them to be judgmental and not friendly.

Japanese wabi-sabi aesthetic was everywhere: from the cafe interior design to the presentation of the food. What Stonehill Matcha absolutely excels in is its mastery of the delicate balance of ingredients. We ordered the hojichata, matcha latte, katsu sando and matchazuke. \n\nHojichata - While its murky brown color is initially off-putting, once you take your first sip, there's no going back! Expected it to be some sort of rice pudding with too much cinnamon, but it was an excellent balance between hojicha, rice, cinnamon, vanilla, and agave. Not overpowering at all and actually a very light drink.\n\nHojicha Latte - Although I regret ordering this warm drink on a hot afternoon, it was excellent. Perfect amount of matcha - not too grassy or bitter, but not too sweet either. Would order again on a cooler day!\n\nKatsu Sando - That pork cutlet was SO tender. It was a touch under seasoned, but the textures of this sandwich was wonderful. You've got layers of soft white bread with crunchy cabbage, wet tonkotsu sauce, crispy breading, then juicy pork. Would definitely order again. \n\nMatchazuke - Server pours the chicken dashi and matcha in your bowl in front of you, although I'd prefer to do it myself for playful purposes. Salmon was perfectly cooked - extremely moist and tender, sort of a \"medium rare\" with light raw pink left in the middle. Excellent blend of textures again: silky salmon, crunchy nori and furikake, and soft rice.", "author": "Shirley C."}

Maybe the service (which is phenomenal and the only reason they're earning 3 stars) or the aesthetics and how Instagrammable everything is...\n\nThe matcha cream puffs are cute and extremely sweet (which is to be expected), but the actual matcha itself here is average and certainly nothing to write home about.

Sign me up! Matcha and ginger are two of my favorite flavors. Of course I had to order a MATCHA CROISSANT as well.  Latte was rich, creamy, with great matcha flavor and some heat from the fresh ginger. I was very happy with the drink! Croissant actually didn't have much matcha flavor at all, however the layers were well laminated (thanks Great British Bakeoff for gifting me knowledge of what makes a great croissant), with lots of flaky layers and crispy exterior. It was buttery but not oily at all.\n\nI can see the barista took care in making everyone's drinks. There weren't too many people in here on a Thursday morning but I still waited ~10 minutes or more for my drink. That's fine since it tasted well made! Just be aware if you're in a hurry.\n\nOverall I can see myself coming back here for their lattes as a #yolo treat!

They pour in the broth for you when they serve it (it would be nice if they just gave the teapot and let you pour it yourself so you can add however much you want, when you want...) which makes the rice a little bit salty and bitter but it is so good with the furikake and salmon!

I couldn't really taste the matcha, which was a bit disappointing. The concept is interesting and fun - something cool to try once, but I would not order it again since it is not worth the price.

It is located in a busy area of the Mission so I could see how parking might be difficult.\n\nWAIT: Came on a Thursday after lunch and it was pretty crowded! There were no seats when we were ordering so I was afraid we wouldn't find something but after waiting about 2 minutes a table opened up.  After ordering, it took about 5-10 minutes for us to get all of our pastries and drinks.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Love the minimalist, trendy, smooth wooden interior and atmosphere.  I could see it as a nice place for studying or catching up with friends and family.  There is a pretty large window area where it lets in light and on the side you can see them making the matcha and the stonemill.\n\nFOOD: Obviously they are famous for their stone milled matcha.  They have drinks, pastries and food that you can eat.  The pastries do run out (they ran out of the creme puffs and the matcha creme pie at about 3pm on that Thursday so come early!).  You can see everything in the display case but for some of the pastries they bring it to you after you order.\n\nHOJICHA LATTE - I'm not a fan of lattes because I don't really like milk, but I couldn't deny how pretty this drink looked cold.  You can get it cold or hot so if you want it in the pretty glass ask for it cold.  They have 2 milk alternatives (oat and almond milk) so I got it with oat milk.  Next time I'll ask for less milk as it was a little too milky for me.  It comes layered so you have to stir it to give you the milky tea taste.  The hojicha is very delicious, a good roasted tea taste and with the milk it helps sweeten it slightly but it isn't overly sweet.  The Hojicha is a very dark color so you know it's good!  Overall, I think I may have been converted to Hojicha lattes.\n\nBLACK SESAME CREME PUFF - unlike other places such as beard papa, their creme puff was very flaky and light and didn't taste stale or like the breading was tough or \"chewy.\"  It was very good and not overly sweet, with a great black sesame flavor.\n\nMATCHA CREME PIE - I'm not a huge fan of cream so I can't quite speak to this but the pie crust was similar to the creme puff in that it was very light and flaky.

One minute, I was talking like Mr. Testaverde, and the next I'm was Jessie Spano sing-crying \"I'm So Excited\". Then, I would be up all night because of the adrenaline rush. The next morning, I would down more coffee and the cycle would continue. \n\nI went to my doc and she recommended that I cut out caffeine because I was too sensitive to it. \n\nWhat?!\n\nHow am I supposed to get through those monologue meetings. You know what I'm talking about - there's always THAT one person at work who can spend the entire hour talking about themselves, what they ate for breakfast, and the color of their bowel movement...and you have to act like you care. \n\nEnter Matcha.\n\nIf the caffeine from coffee makes you act kinda crazy and you absolutely need caffeine to function, Matcha is the answer. It gives you that calm alertness (caffeine + L-theanine) to get through the work day without looking cray cray. I still try to avoid caffeine during the weekdays but when I do indulge, it's with matcha. \n\nWhen I read that Stonemill Matcha, a matcha caf\u00e9 was opening, I was excited to visit. Unfortunately, my visit was similar to Luna M. and Mei S., leaving me with mixed feelings about the place. \n\nI visited for an early lunch during a weekday and ordered the following (some for here and some to-go to bring back to work to share):\n\n*Matcha Latte w/ cane sugar ($5 + $1 sub oat milk): https://bit.ly/2x67bAE\n*Pork Katsu Sandwich: Fried pork cutlet, tonkatsu sauce, cabbage ($14): https://bit.ly/2Izdguy\n*Japanese Souffl\u00e9 Cheesecake ($6): https://bit.ly/2ID6pfK\n*Everything Furikake Croissant w/ cream cheese ($5): https://bit.ly/2rZRRQW\n*Chashu Pork Danish ($6): https://bit.ly/2KLQNHw\n*Japanese Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies ($3 each): https://bit.ly/2s3JqTU\n\n(+) Matcha Latte was on point and similar to Boba Guys. The matcha had a nice, vegetal bitterness and I liked the creaminess of the oat milk. It was lightly sweetened with cane sugar. \n(+) Pork Katsu Sandwich is a good example of something simple done right - crisp, tender tonkatsu cutlet between fresh, soft white bread with some shredded cabbage for texture. Could have used a touch more tonkatsu sauce though. \n(+) The souffl\u00e9 cheesecake was light and fluffy soft with a nice citrus essence. My co-worker loved this.\n\n(-) I love Tartine but the Tartine pastries were a HUGE disappointment. Perhaps, I went on an off day but the croissant was doughy, the danish was incredibly dry (the chashu was congealed fat), and the butter chocolate chip cookie was too salty with no texture to it. We didn't finish any of the pastries and cookies. \n\nAs for the service, it was a mixed bag as well (order at the counter, grab a number, and your order will be delivered to you). Lynn, one of the servers was awesome! She's genuinely warm and friendly to all the customers she interacted with. In a perfect world, every server would be like her.\n\nIt's a shame the rest of the staff didn't have the same positive vibes. The ladies behind the counter were unfriendly and I felt like a nuisance for even ordering anything at all (I didn't ask any questions and knew exactly what I wanted to order). \n\nMake sure to check your order because they forgot to give me the souffl\u00e9 cheesecake and Lynn was kind enough to pack it up to-go for me. \n\nMinimalist, zen vibe.

With unique and interesting food options, the nice decor and warm environment it's no surprise there's such high reviews and buzz about this place.\n\nMy only complaint is the seating situation could be improved, you can order food for eat-in but you are on your own to find a table. Sometimes the food may come out before you even get a table so the workers are either searching fruitlessly for your order number or they find you and you have to awkwardly hold your food and pressure people to leave as you stand closer and closer to someone's table.", "author": "Daniel C."}

(I make my own all the time and I saw no difference) \n\nThe desserts here were great! Not too sweet and there were great balance of flavors. The matcha cream pie is cream heavy but that's just how these pies are! The flavors were just right. Not too sweet or bitter. The crust was okay... but I guess you wouldn't want a super buttery crust since the filling is kind of heavy. The yuzu tart was great! Sweet and a bit tart with earthy flavors from the matcha. \n\nDidn't even bother with the food because I didn't think it was worth it. The matcha is the star here anyways! \n\nI came on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm and there was a line out the door. I probably waited about 20 mins? I felt like this would be a great place to chat with friends or get some work done but this place was filled with people since everyone wanted to try out this new matcha place!

You can tell the properly dressed staff in blue lab coats are very attentive to detail when making your drinks. The drink was perfect, not too sweet and not too bitter in some cases for matcha drinks. I noticed that was probably because they only have 1 person in charge pouring the already mixed matcha to help standardize the appropriate amount to balance flavor with precision.

There's salmon on a bed of rice with green onion and toasted rice sprinkled on it. The waitress poured the matcha dashi in at the table. Couldn't really taste the matcha in the dashi - just tasted like broth and rice to me. Comforting, but I'm not sure it's worth the price. Salmon was cooked well, texture was great and not dry at all.\n\nHojicha latte: Yum. I'm not a huge fan of lattes because it's usually too much milk, but this one was great iced. The hojicha flavor was distinct and it wasn't too much milk.\n\nI've tried a number of the pastries and each of them seem unique/worth a try, but nothing has blown me out of the water and they add up fairly quickly.

The cold brew genmatcha we ordered was super smooth with a bit of umami which was weird for me since it tasted a little like a cold seaweed soup. The matcha croissant was good, however nothing to rave about... But it had a good matcha flavor and was not greasy or heavy for a crossiant. It even had a slight chew or bounce to the dough which we liked a lot. Highly recommend to try the teas and enjoy! \n\nOH yeah... Only down side... it gets crowded and you might not get a table.

And the general uniqueness of Stonemill Matcha's offerings, pairing modern SF feels (a la morning buns and citrus tarts), with traditional flavors (yuzu, matcha, sesame, everything!). \n\nThe buds and I got there around 9am, an hour after opening. We waited roughly 25mins to get serviced. Overall, they had a fairly good rhythm going of pushing ppl down their bakery, hot foods, drink orders assembly line as quickly as possible. I'm sure it'll get even better with time. \n\nI did notice while I was waiting that they were having some issues with hot foods coming out too slow or going missing(?). But the waitstaff was extremely apologetic when that happened. And again, I'm sure they'll get better with time. \n\nAs for the order, I started with a matcha sparkling with yuzu and cane sugar. It was delicious. The hint of citrus from the yuzu, with the ever so light sweetness blended extremely well with the matcha. The pastries were shared among the group, and they were: (1) sesame cream puff - which I almost said no to bc I'm not a cream puff fan, but boy am I glad that I got outvoted. Sesame flavor game strong!; (2) everything croissant - my choice, and prob my least fav of the three pastries ordered. There was a cream cheese filling that I wasn't quite expecting. Not bad, but not great; (3) yuzu matcha tart - divine! If you're as much of a citrus dessert fan as I am, don't walk, RUN. All the lemon meringue tart feels, but really with yuzu and matcha uniqueness. This was by far the fav of the pastries. \n\nOkk and for the main. Oh man, the main. Got the Matchazuke. At first glance, I couldn't order this dish bc they have chicken dashi sprinkled on it...and I didn't want to be difficult. But after talking to the cashier, she said they could easily make this dish pescetarian friendly by swapping it out with fish dashi. Woot woot! And, OMG, this $16 dish was worth EVERY. PENNY. Okay, I've been a pescetarian for nearly 20yrs now. And I've had my fair share of salmon filets in my lifetime. But hands-down, the piece of salmon I got with this dish had to be one of the top 3, if not the top 1, pieces of salmon I've ever had. In my life. And on top of that, the matcha soup drizzle(?) seemed a bit questionable at first, but paired so beautifully with the salmon and rice, that it just all made perfect sense. Would 1000% come back for this dish alone. \n\nYes, they're new. And yes, their service wasn't perfect. But the food and drinks and overall ambiance of what they're trying to build was all there.

I'd like to say research while others would like to say stalking, lol! \n\nMy first visit was in and out. I circled Mission and Valencia for a couple of minutes to find parking. I arrived around 1:30pm or so, every table was busy. I got my order to go not wanting to wait for a table. I was super hot and sweaty from the walk. I couldn't imagine sitting down because I needed air. I looked at the menu well beforehand knowing I wanted a katsu sando, matcha latte, and matcha cream puff. \n\nWho am I kidding? It was all about the matcha cream puff that lured me in the first place! The woman at the register questioned my 2 orders of katsu sando because it comes with 3 sandwiches each. I share ..... when I want to. The bread on the katsu sando was incredibly soft, light, and airy. Anything and I mean anything you put in between those two slices would be heaven! Matcha latte was just okay for me, it did the trick which was to cool me down. The matcha cream puff, ohhhhh that filling was perfection. I easily would have eaten three of those but I kept it to one. \n\nI took a girlfriend with me the second time. We decided to brunch. This time around since there was open seating, I decided to get the matchazuke. I also ordered the hochija latte and the matcha cream pie. The matchazuke was delicious, salmon perfectly cooked sitting on a small bed of rice surrounded by chicken dashi and matcha topped with green onions and nori. Presentation was beautiful as it was delivered in a wooden tray and the dashi was poured by the server. I did not care for the matcha cream pie. It was overly sweet and I could only taste the whip cream, which I kept removing with my fork. I kept waiting for the earthy match taste to come through with each bite but it never came. I left the rest for my friend. The hochija latte may have been the culprit because it was sweet which may have altered my taste buds. However you'd think with the salmon it would reset. \n\nThis is getting long... It's a beautiful cafe and they do have specials so follow them and see what might entice you.

They sell matcha and cups/bowls that are locally made and some napkins and such. There was a short line for tartine pastries and drinks but no one had ordered traditional tea service (located across the room) while I was there.

My husband and I ordered a matcha latte, a ginger matcha latte, sesame cream puff and a chocolate butter cooker. The total came to $20. \n\nThe lattes were okay. I would agree with other reviewers that the matcha flavor is very very mild. You really don't taste the matcha much. In the ginger matcha latte, you don't taste the matcha at all because the ginger is just so overpowering. It just tasted like ginger + milk. The latte's were $5 and $5.50. Hard pass for taste and price especially when I make better lattes at home. \n\nPastries - the sesame cream puff was delicious but the butter cookie was okay. It just tasted like a regular chocolate chip cookie, and for $3, I would not say it was worth the price. \n\nOverall, this matcha cafe is a nice place to hang out but I can't see myself visiting again unless I was in the area and wanted a cream puff.", "author": "Serena L."}

No one else has nailed the simple fare Japanese food and drinks that are extremely high quality. This is my favorite place for authentic Japanese food, though it's a bit pricey.\n\nDrinks wise, the Hojicha Latte is quite good. The Yuzu Matcha drink is good but ends up just tasting like Yuzu tonic. Matcha latte is of course a classic, but the Hojicha Latte is a bit more special since less places have it. \n\nPastry wise - I'm a huge fan of their cheesecake. It's light, fluffy, very much like a souffley with a proper glaze finish on top. Most people don't serve cheesecake like this in the city. The yuzu meringue tart is also an excellent balance of tart and more neutral flavors. \n\nThe savory food is really what gets me here and keeps me coming back. Not only are the katsu sandos Instagram perfect, but they're actually delicious as well. Perfectly breaded, yet moist katsu sandwiches on delicious white bread. The Matchazuke is also a delicious take on ochazuke. The chicken oyako left a bit to be desired, but more because I'm not familiar with chicken porridge style. The pickled vegetables are excellent to add onto your meals as well, as they offer some distinction to the otherwise heavier flavors. \n\nThe biggest con of this place is that it's too popular and table space is really hard to get. They do churn through tables quickly, but you sometimes feel like a vulture waiting for a table to free up, and then you feel bad sitting here for too long. It's still a great cafe with wonderful food though, but maybe not a place to dawdle for too long in .", "author": "Jasmine X."}

As a study spot this place isn't ideal but it's not bad. There's good lighting and plenty of seats (this place was consistently busy the entire Friday afternoon we were here but there's enough turn over where it wasn't too hard to get a spot). However there doesn't seem to be any outlets and there's no free wifi. There's also servers that come around fairly often to see if you need anything to a point where it was slightly uncomfortable sticking around (they don't rush you out or anything but it's a bit awkward).\n\nFor our visit my friend and I got the following\n1) Yuzu Meringue Tart: More or less a lemon meringue pie with a twist. I can't even say the twist is the yuzu cause it's so close to lemon (usually I can taste a distinct difference but not so much here). The matcha base was alright but if it was stronger this item would've been more worth getting. The meringue on top was light but it's sat out for a while so the browned bits aren't that distinguishable from the rest. Not bad but not a must get (3.25/5)\n\n2) Matcha Cream Pie: Now THIS is the matcha goodness I've been looking for (despite the fact the matcha portion could actually be a bit stronger). I'm a cream pie person so the ratio of cream to matcha was fine (though like I said, stronger would be nice) especially since the cream was delicious. The fresh milk flavor comes out a lot and it almost has a citrusy undertone. The crust is very buttery and delicious too. (4.5/5)\n\n3) Sparkling Matcha w/ Yuzu and Cane Sugar: My drink. I got it at 1/2 sweetness which was nice and tart like I prefer. Very refreshing at first but like a lot of people said it's a lot of ice. The matcha flavor was noticeable at first but after a while the yuzu dominates the drink. (3.25/5) \n\n4) Iced Matcha Latte: Friend's drink. Enjoyable and the quality of the matcha is noticeable though once again wish it was stronger. \n\nOverall I like this spot, I'd say my most consistent complaint is that the matcha flavor just needs to be stronger in almost every item. It's there and the quality is good but the other ingredients mask it.\n\n---The Re-Return: Matcha Cream Pie---", "author": "Vivian C."}

The benefit here is that if you are seated, you will be happy by the spacious layout and people being comfortably more than an arm's length away from you.\n\nTheir matcha can be described as average. I ordered the matcha latte and one of their matcha pastries. I found the former to be watered down, and the latter to be too sweet. This spot is newly opened so they are popular at the moment, but if you come here for the food you may leave wanting.", "author": "Chris W."}

The ginger macha latte wasn't really my thing. It felt too gingery, and I normally real like my ginger.

Well, they were sold out of all the pastries I really wanted to try the first day I went, and after hearing a number of friends rave about the katsu sandwich later that day, had to have it in my belly ASAP.\n\nThe hits? Their chashu danish (preferably reheated in a toaster at home), the black sesame cream puff, and that katsu sando FOSHO, which, surprisingly, was even better than ones I had back in Tokyo.\n\nAs for misses, there seems to be pretty universal disappointment among friends with their drinks for being too bland, and I myself found the roll cake to be pretty unnoteworthy.\n\nThe place is pretty popping, so despite the high number of tables, finding an open seat can sometimes be a little difficult.

I ended up ordering the iced matcha latte with oat milk (they have almond and regular milk as well) and a matcha mochi (mochi is only available on weekends!)The latte was delicious and not overly sweet, a perfect complement to the matcha mochi, which had a creamy white chocolate matcha filling.

To me their standouts are their drinks- everything i've tried so far has been fantastic! Strong tea/matcha flavors but still smooth, and the best part is that in all of their lattes they don't go overboard on sweetener! There's just enough to balance out the bitterness of the matcha but not so much that you're left with a weird aftertaste from drinking it. The ginger matcha is my fav but I love the hojicha latte as well. I'm a huge fan of the chicken okayu bowl and the katsu sandwich, which has no right  being as tasty as it is. Both are perfect for lunch! The pastry case I feel like is a little more hit or miss. While I am obsessed with the matcha cream pie and some seasonal items like the homemade poptart, I think most of the pastries from Tartine are a bit of a let down. I've tried both the matcha croissant and kinako morning bun and while the pastry itself is great, the flavors for both don't come through at all - they just taste like plain croissants or morning buns, which i found pretty disappointing. \n\nThe line and availability for seating space can get a little hectic on the weekends towards lunch time, but if you go a little earlier it isn't too bad!

The crispy garlic and green onions added a nice crunch to the savory chicken and soy sauce flavors of the porridge. I really enjoyed the mushrooms as well as a nice additional texture and flavor. I added the togarashi (red pepper) to add some heat and I probably would've enjoyed a little more than just what they gave me.\n\nI also enjoyed ended up getting their matcha cookies which was a little pricey for $3/ea but I really liked to sweet/saltiness of the cookie which had some rice cake specs in it to add crunch and saltiness.

I love how creative all their pastries look, but overall, I will say that their menu is very focused and a little bit on the pricier side. Even though I'm a sweets person, it's very hard to control my sweet tooth once I'm around desserts and sweet food. So I decided to keep it simple and ordered a matchacano (plain Jane matcha with frothed water). For $5, the quality of the matcha was incredible. The baristas here definitely know how to whisk a cup of matcha, resulting in a smooth-tasting drink.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-28", "description": "When I heard about Stonemill Matcha's arrival earlier this year, I was excited but also skeptical when it opened--I had just returned from a vacation in Japan and the concept of a matcha-focused cafe seemed a bit gimmicky.\n\nThe verdict: it's not gimmicky at all. The matcha lattes are the closest quality to what I've had in Japan, and there's always a line (at least on the weekends). The ambience reminds me of an upscale living room, with Japanese accents. I've always found myself wanting to linger, but that's difficult when there's always people waiting for a table.\n\nWhen it comes to their matcha lattes, they're my favorite, hands-down. As opposed to Equator's, Asha's, or Boba Guys, Stonemill's lattes have an unmatched depth in their tea, and you can tell they truly care about their craft here when it comes to preparation and presentation. One caveat: their ice cubes are a little large for my taste.\n\nOver three visits I've also had a chance to sample some of their food offerings and sweets. The photos speak for themselves, but I'd highly recommend the Chicken Okayu. The rice porridge is hearty with a great mix of flavors and textures, and gives you a warm feeling in both your stomach and heart.\n\nQuick tip: if you're lactose intolerant choose oat milk for your matcha latte. Unlike other places that use honey or simple syrup, Stonemill uses cane sugar as their sweetener, and oat milk provides a creamier texture. A latte with almond milk might taste slightly watered down.", "author": "Aaron B."}

The first time we went was around noon on a Saturday, and suprisingly the line wasn't out the door. While we waited, we had time to look at the menu and see what we wanted to eat and drink. While the group ahead of us were ordering, we found a table for two that had just vacated, and so we figured my boyfriend could snatch that spot while I order. Side note: my bf had ankle surgery and wanted to sit asap to avoid some pressure on his ankle (he's in a walking boot and just got off crutches). An employee told him he couldn't sit there until he ordered, and he pointed out I was about to order, but they made him get up regardless. Right after we ordered, we looked over at the same table, hoping no one snatched it up, and a kid was sitting at it, holding the spot for his parent somewhere behind us in line. We thought it was a little unfair that the table was still being held, and that the parent was not told the same thing we were....\nBUT! After seeing what was happening, the manager(?) said that they would find us a table ASAP and once one opened up, made sure we could sit. They were super accommodating and sincerely apologetic, which we really appreciated. \n\nOnto the food and drinks!\n1) Katsu sando - get this. We're a little obsessed, so much so that we went back the next week and got it again! The bread was soft and perfect, going really well with the katsu that was nicely breaded too. The sandwich comes with 3 pieces, which was nice instead of the regular 2! \n2) Chicken okayu- I heard people thought the portions were small on this, but for the quality of ingredients, I honestly thought the portion was fit for the price, and I definitely wasn't still hungry afterward. It's served in a deeper bowl, which makes the portion seem smaller, I guess? We loved the poached egg and mushrooms, and the porridge was so flavorful!\n3) Iced Hojicha latte with oat milk - honestly, if you like black sesame, I think you'll like this drink. We were also obsessed with this drink...super addicting and had a nuttiness to it with the oat milk.\n4) Matcha latte with almond milk- your standard matcha latte; I wouldn't say it was anything special, but it was really good nonetheless\n5) black sesame angel cake- this was good!

I didn't try any pastries from here, maybe next time!\n\nFOOD/DRINK\n+ Katsu sando: wow, sooo good. Just like something you would get in Japan. The delicious white bread is soft and fluffy. The katsu was lightly fried with not a lot of grease. The mayo and veggie used had just the right amount of sweetness. All presented neatly in a fine wooden box. Dare me say it's perfect.\n+ Chicken okayu: rice porridge with pickled wakame, egg, mushroom and green onion. Texture of the porridge was very good and the accompaniments being a big salty made it tasty. The egg was soft cooked to perfection. I was so impressed by this dish as I was by the katsu sando, but this was beautifully executed nonetheless\n+ Miso soup: loaded with mushrooms!\n+ Side salad: greens served with sesame dressing. Not particularly special, but was a good cold side item to balance out the other food items\n+ Matcha almond latte: got this with zero sugar as you can customize!!! Very smooooth and simply delightful.\n\nAMBIANCE/DECOR\nClean and modern. There is an actual stonemill at the back of the cafe. Tea station in the back. Cashier counter where you order displays various baked goods. They were selling matcha croissants from Tartine, they also have kinako flavored cookies and buns. Seatings at tables and counters available. Due to a lot of customers, you may need to wait a little to get a seat. Nothing too crazy tho.\n\nSERVICE/STAFF\nVery good. Got seated, placed number on table. Drink arrived first, followed shortly by utensils and food items. Staff were polite and friendly, asked us if we needed anything else. Staff wore Stonemill Matcha uniform which was cool, too.\n\nIt hasn't been a week since my first visit and I already want to return.

We were there around 10am, hoping to snag a table and enjoy some hoji-cha lattes and katsu sandwiches. Unfortunately all of the tables were taken and we had to take everything to go.\n\nThe staff greeted us from behind the counter and they were all very expressionless and looked like they didn't want to be there. Felt like they had been hired solely for their looks rather than whether they can serve. We ordered quite a few items, several pastries to take home, a sandwich to take home, and two hoji-cha lattes, one iced, one hot. They immediately gave us 3 of 5 of the pastries we ordered and they took down our name for our drinks and the sandwich. We had to remind them about the other 2 pastries - if we didn't check, we probably would not have received them.\n\nBoth lattes were given to us hot, and I had to mention that I ordered an iced one, and the man had to remake it. Seems like a hassle for such an expensive drink, and I felt bad, but maybe they should have put the order in correctly.\n\nDRINKS: My mom's drink was lukewarm and unimpressive. My latte was good, I liked it, but as I kept drinking it, it started to taste just more and more like an oolong milk tea boba I get from down the street. I could tell the quality of the tea but it just wasn't anything special. Looked nice, so that's a point.\n\nPASTRIES: The pastries are what you should come for. These are ALL good. We got the yuzu tart, matcha cream pie, Japanese baked cheese cake (just like what my mom used to make when I was a kid!), matcha choux cream, and black sesame choux cream. They are all spectacular and well balanced. Not a great aftertaste, but it's expected when you're eating sweets with tea in it.\n\nKatsu Sand! So yummy. But probably not worth $14. I'd pay $12 at most for the portion. But I suppose in a bougie shop in a neighborhood-turning-bougie, $14 is appropriate. I'd buy this every time if I was willing to pay for it.\n\nOverall, uncomfortable, uninviting, unimpressive. But it was a nice drive over to try it out.", "author": "Luna M."}

Not to my surprised, the bf and I came on a sunny saturday and the line, as expected was super long.\n\nThe location is great, though, with the hustle and bustle of valencia, street parking is hard the find. The ambiance in the store is bright, great for natural lighting. Seating is limited and hard to find due to the influx fo new patrons checking out the goodies.

I was cool to look at..and a good tasting croissant, but matcha wise, this was substle.\n\nMatcha Crea Pie- This was probably the golden dish. Dear lord, I can eat an entire pie to myself (and i'm lactose intolerant). This, my friend, was amazing. The creaminess of the filling constrast perfectly with the crust. I must say that it was not overwhelming sweet and you definitely tasted the matcha incorporated in the cream filling. I wish I order 5 slices or more. I would definitely go back for this iteam alone.\n\nIce Matcha Latte regular and the one with Ginger: Great drinks, well made.

This cafe works a little like any bakery, you order and they give you a number and you have to find yourself a table. The food comes out pretty quick and they try to clear the tables as fast as possible. \n\nFOOD: \nAlthough, they have \"matcha\" in their name, they service other flavors. They have a selection of bake goods, pastries, drinks and savory plates.

Honestly, I could do without the cream, there was way too much I ended up just removing more than half my pie, and just ate the matcha cream with the thin crust. Flavor wise, the matcha could have been a tad stronger, but other wise a well balance in sugar taste and very smooth in texture! \n+ Matcha Cream Puff $5: the matcha cream in this choux was matcha perfection! A good balance between the bitterness and sweetness, without being too sweet. However, this is very pricey for a small choux.\n+ Goma Chocolate Tart $5.5:  This is a chocolate tart with a sesame crisp sheet at the bottom of the tart. I love tarts, and this one did not disappoint me! The texture of the tart held it's shape, was not greasy, the filling was decadent and very smooth. The sesame with a create addition for texture. The presentation was so pretty I felt bad eating it. \n+ Chasu Danish $5: This reminded me of something Baker Doe would make! Very flake and smelled so good! There isn't too much chasu in the middle, but the combo of all the meat, veggies and sauce made a pretty tasty danish! \n\nThey also have matcha bowls, whisk and other utensil for sale (pricey!)\n\nAMBIANCE:\nThe shop is medium size, with lots of tables for parties of 2 and some for parties of 4.

If you're looking for a good matcha / hojicha drink fix or you want an amazing matcha ice cream fixin, Cafe Maiko is your spot. Stonehill is a more elegant sit down cafe, where you can also get amazing drinks at, but their food selection is more vast. \n\nTo start with, the ambiance of this place is on point.

Perfect amount of ginger, not to spicy.\n* The matcha croissant- underwhelming. No matcha flavor, but the coloring inside was beautiful. It's not like the croissant was bad, I was just disappointed it had no matcha flavor. \n* Furikake croissant- this has cream cheese inside and was really good, although I do wish the croissant was heated up to compliment the cream cheese.\nMatchazuke- SO GOOD. If you want more of a meal, definitely go for this. I don't know how they made the matcha-y broth, but wow it was amazing. The little fried salmon chip on the top was also a cute and tasty touch. \n*Matcha cream pie- FAVORITE THING OF ALL. If you're a coconut cream pie fan, and you also love matcha, this is for you.

I haven't tried the other recently opened matcha cafe in Japantown yet, and will update my review after I try that one.\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared a ginger matcha latte, cold-brew matcha, and katsu sandwich. The cold-brew was so refreshing and smooth, and I love the strong flavor. It was surprisingly not too bitter. I like my drinks without sugar, but there are also options to add cane sugar.\n\nAll the items we ordered were delicious! They have pretty fast service despite the long lines too.\n\nSince this place is newly opened, it's still really crowded. I'd definitely come back again for their cold brew matcha :)", "author": "Alicia L."}

Must try if you're a fan of black sesame. Great flavor and cream puff is crispy!\n\nCheesecake = pretty good, super soft and fluffy. There was a bit of orange zest that made it interesting/different from other Japanese cheesecakes.\n\nYuzu meringue tart = really good, but tbh it just tasted like key lime pie (a really pretty dessert and instagrammable though)\n\nMatcha croissant = pass on this, it's a mediocre croissant that doesn't have any matcha flavor\n\nIced drinks are refreshing here but unfortunately 75% ice which is disappointing.", "author": "Madeline C."}

I loved the hojicha latte, as it was very flavorful and not too milky. I wanted to see how the sparkling matcha tasted plain, but I think it really needs some added sugar (ie: yuzu + sugar option). \n\nWe also ordered the katsu sando, matcha cream puff, and matcha croissant. The katsu sando was tasty, but pretty expensive for the portion size. My favorite was the matcha cream puff, because it had the perfect ratio of cream to pastry (I'm not a fan of cream puffs that are like 75% cream) and the choux dough was super tasty! Would highly recommend! The item I was actually most excited to try was the matcha croissant, but I found it to be disappointing.

To eat, we also had the pork katsu sando, a simple sandwich of uncrusted white bread with a perfectly breaded pork cutlet, tonkatsu sauce, and cabbage. Despite the good reviews about this dish, I found it extremely bland and not worth the price tag one bit. We also had the matchazuke, a bowl of rice with a matcha-based broth topped with a perfectly cooked chunk of salmon with crispy salmon skin on top.

Their pastries on display are all made by tartine but the flavors are specifically meant for Stonemill. They also have a variety of matcha drinks and hot cafe foods as well.\n\nFor their pastries, I tried their matcha croissant, kinako morning bun, and the matcha cream puff. I was slightly disappointed with the croissant and morning bun since there are high expectations when tartine is making these pastries. The matcha croissant didn't have much matcha flavor so it essentially ended up tasting like a typical tartine croissant that was green colored. The kinako morning bun had something lacking since it still had the strong orange flavor of a typical morning but but without that sugary exterior we've all grown to love. The matcha cream puff however was a real winner since they pipe the cream after you order it, keeping the cream puff crispy and flaky. Highly recommend eating it immediately after ordering it so it doesn't get soggy.\n\nFor their drinks, the ginger matcha latte sounded interesting since they use fresh ginger. I couldn't really taste the matcha since the ginger overpowered the flavor of a subtle matcha taste. The hojicha latte was a winner though since it had a nice deep roasted flavor.\n\nFor their cafe food, I tried the matchazuke. It was an interesting concept to use matcha in the dashi broth but ultimately I couldn't really find the matcha flavor much. The dashi broth was really tasty but I feel like adding the matcha didn't do much to add to the flavor of the broth.

There was no hojicha flavor in the pot de creme, but there was an alcohol flavor which is something I actually like. I was in Japan twice this year already and I visit a few times yearly, so I've been very spoiled when it comes to Japanese food.

Part of why I also can't give more than 4 stars is it says on Yelp there are gluten free options, however when I went in there was only one gluten free option. And I believe Yelp also says dairy free? But when I asked the staff they practically laughed said there were hardly any dairy free options. The place is super pretty but also sadly rather noisy even on a weekday. I wanted to love it here...so much potential! I'm hoping there can be more gluten free and vegan options so that folks don't get confused when they come here via Yelp.", "author": "Emily H."}

The place is pretty busy and seating space is limited, but the food is really good. We got the Matchazuke: the salmon was perfectly cooked, and the crisp on top added extra flavor to it. The rice simmered with matcha tastes pretty good too. The combination works out pretty well. For desserts, we got matcha cream puff and yuzu tart: I highly recommend both! The cream puff is big: super crispy crust filled with a ton of matcha cream. The yuzu tart has a light and fluffy layer of cream on top, yuzu jam in the middle and cookie crust at the bottom. Not overwhelmingly sweet and rich in flavors.", "author": "Zhihui H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-18", "description": "My wife is from Japan. She says this place is legit and is run by former employees of a well-known Japanese brewery. All I know is that it's the only place within a 400-mile radius to get a matcha latte and pastries in such a nice setting. Basically, you'd have to head down to Los Angeles, and even there most places are set up as fast casual for the youths. Here, it's a spacious, well-lit, modern Japanese experience in the former Bar Tartine. The headliner is the bright green matcha, which is made much differently than coffee or tea and can be observed at the counter in the back. My pick is the hojicha (roasted tea) latte, which has the flavor and consistency almost like very light hot cocoa. \n\nThe food menu is quite large for a cafe and my favorite so far is the tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlet) sandwich, which is made when you order and arrives hot in three sections. Great for sharing. In Japan, tonkatsu sandwiches are a very popular snack item and can be had a convenience stores and train stations, usually sold packaged in the refrigerated section. Stonemill's is the highest execution of this snack I've had so far, and it is likely the best example in the Bay Area: a fried, golden brown juicy pork cutlet is accompanied by a lightly-dressed cole slaw, all pressed between two slices of sturdy bread (crusts cut off) to which Bulldog sauce (a thicker, sweeter version of Worcestershire) has been generously applied. If you enjoy meat and have never had one of these, it will blow your freaking mind.\n\nI have also heard that the salmon over rice is very good, and look forward to trying it next time.\n\nAll in all, it's great to see another authentically modern Japanese place open up in San Francisco and provide a new experience to expand beyond the steadily improving ramen, yakitori, and sushi scenes.", "author": "E L."}

It lacked exactly what the space lacked itself, soul. The taste was so offensive I had to toss it out. We paid over $16 for 2 matchas and a cream puff and pretty much threw all of it out.

We ordered an original matcha latte, ginger matcha latte (cold), and shared a black sesame cream puff. The lattes were amazing and not overly sweetened while the texture and flavor of the black sesame cream filling complemented the matcha flavors well. It was a little difficult to split the cream puff pastry itself between the two of us -  it was a little too dry and crunchy for me (possibly from being on display too long?).

It's such a beautifully and tastefully designed space. It takes advantage of the layout while giving everyone room to take in the whole experience. \n\nAll the servers who helped us were very kind and patient. We also enjoyed the warm foods and sweets (Mikiko is a genius!). The katsu sando was a reminder of the time I spent in Japan. There was a good balance of bread to protein. However, we wished it came out a little hotter. The congee was warm and hearty. The balance of the egg, wakame, and mushrooms was very tasteful. I like adding the pickles because it brings a kick to the congee. The congee itself has a mild flavor. It reminds me of what I would eat for breakfast as a kid or for every meal when I am sick. The salmon with rice and matcha was a fun combination. The fish was so fresh and well-balanced. It wasn't raw or overcooked. As mentioned earlier, it would have been better for it to come out warmer.\n\nThe pastries were a class of their own. A must is the cheesecake. It just melts in your mouth. I never understood the hype of Pablo cheesecake in Japan. This cheesecake is miles better than any Pablo cheesecake you'll ever have. The creme puff with matcha and black sesame are also great options. The flavors are intense and hit the whole range from crunchy to melting in your mouth. Most people don't order the chocolate cake, but it's intense and not overly rich. It has sesame on the bottom. Totally worth ordering, especially for all the chocolate lovers! The mochis are also a must order. Mikiko works so hard daily to prepare the mochi by hand. It's truly a labor of love and you can taste it in every bite. The lemon meringue pie was a little too sweet for us.\n\nFor drinks, we got the matcha latte with ginger and oat milk as well as the regular matcha latte and the matcha spritzer with lime and mint. My favorite was the matcha latte with ginger and oat milk COLD. It's so refreshing and the ginger adds a subtle kick. They freshly squeeze ginger juice every day to make sure it's intense without being too bitter or spicy. The matcha spritzer with lime and mint was like a matcha mojito; really light and refreshing and a fun twist on a wonderful drink.\n\nI'm very excited to see all the avenues and roads Stonemill Matcha has ahead. And I look forward to going back many times to try more of the same treats and new treats. Best of luck!", "author": "Emma L."}

Unfortunately our experience was pretty lackluster, and we decided that we aren't coming back. Firstly, the prices are on the steep side, even for San Francisco - that would be understandable if the quality warranted it. 10$ for a handwhisked matcha (why would you pay a premium for ordering something the way it's made? I don't pay 10$ for a handmade latte or handshaken cocktail...) and 6$ for a latte. My partner and I found the latte decent but nothing to brag about, but the handwhisked matcha was so small it was a joke. We had to politely ask if they made a mistake but they said that's the traditional way. And the matcha tasted average. Certainly better than teavana or Starbucks but you can get a better matcha at the teahouses in japantown for 7$. Plus, you pay tax and mandate on top of it so our three sip matcha and latte came to 20$ with tip. Also there was no information or literature about the matcha, where it comes from, or even if it's organic. I run a tea company so that is something important for tea gnomes like me. The space and ceramics were beautiful, I'll give them that, but I believe that is what the customers are paying for. There also isn't enough seating. If you are trying to be the premier matcha cafe in a city such as SF, step up your game. Hopefully when they recoup the costs of renovating and opening they can make the prices more reasonable. Otherwise better fly to Japan for better matcha at a lower price", "author": "Vince F."}

Iced matcha latte, solid, nothing special.  Matcha white chocolate, incredibly sexy, faintly chewy and salty, would get again evem though it's 3$ a pop. Kakiguri (shaved ice) is Really sexy, squeeze in some lime halfway thru to spice it up a lil. U will never hve better shaved ice in ur life time. Treat urself right.", "author": "Tiffany X."}

The food came out in a timely fashion, the food was hot. Wish they left the dashi so I can pour it myself instead of pouring the whole thing onto my rice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-03", "description": "We also love this place. Everything is a bit pricey but very good and the presentation and setting are lovely. We especially like the hearty rice porridge and the sando to split between us for breakfast or lunch with a macha or hoji latte. We've tried several of the pastries and all were at least \"good\". We've been 4-5 times and the only real quibble has been that a few of the staff have seemed a bit lost at times, although all have been warm and welcoming. As mentioned the crowd/line can be daunting- especially on Saturday or at lunch time, at least for now.  Aesthetically it's a bit like going to one of Cory Lee's places for $15 a head rather than $150 +...", "author": "Jim F."}

The space is very nice - clean design with tables on one side of the restaurant where you try to grab a table after going to the counter to order your food.  We had the Matcha Latte (very toasty and excellent), Katsu sandwich (everything great about Japanese sandwiches if you like them - especially the tarty sweet kewpie mayo which might be house made), Salmon Matchazuke (poached salmon over white rice and a mocha dash broth - excellent) and a simple bowl of white rice (which I would return for - you have to be asian and a rice fan to understand that!)\n\nAfter lunch we grabbed a matcha cream puff - too dry, and the japanese cheesecake - ok but not exceptional.  They both looked beautiful but the taste and texture where it rates a 7 out of 10 if you have had excellent examples of it elsewhere.\n\nThe food overall has all the beautiful umami characteristics that I crave from Japanese food.  I would go back in a heart beat for the hot food, but would pass on the pastries next time.  This is the reverse of what I expected when I got there. Could be the food feels more authentic and the pastry feels more like fusion\n\nThe only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the seating system.  When I think of the Japanese doing experience I think of it as being calm and stress free.  Calming colors and soothing textures and service.  The challenge I found with Stonemill Matcha is you order your food at the counter and get your number.  After that you have to stand around trying to hawk a table not quite clear about the etiquette of what is your priority with the other people also waiting for a table with their number.  Did they get there before me?  What happens if my food comes before I get my table?  Am I going to eat salmon in dashi while standing up?  It creates a stress that really brings the experience down a notch.  The cafe and restaurant format where a bro is occupying a table drinking water and doing conference calls will have me thinking twice the next time I go and really prevent me from bringing a guest there in the future as I dont know if I can sit down and enjoy the absolutely exceptional food.   Could be a settling out period for a new restaurant - I hope thats what it is as Stonemill has created a new restaurant that is truly unique in a city where that is pretty hard.", "author": "Michael L."}
