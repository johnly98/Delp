I was in line when i heard the person behind me say \"faggot\" and of course I turned around and said \"don't say that\". I was immediately bombarded by the white tech bro's Latina girlfriend spouting off obscenities she didn't understand. She... wanted to fight me... ?\n\nAn Open Letter to People Who Still Use 'Faggot' as an Insult\nhttps://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/8011324\n\nBy Casey Cavanagh\n08/20/2015 12:20 PM ET\n\nUpdated Dec 06, 2017\nI understand that terms like \"fag\" and \"gay\" are often used in a \"joking\" manner. When you use them, you probably don't do so maliciously -- and certainly not in a way to purposely offend or insult homosexuals. You, like many, may use the words without even thinking twice about it. Sometimes it just slips -- it's an easy, long since accessible insult. It's almost a habit, right? Well, even if this is the case, it doesn't make it okay.\n\nFirst of all, let's start with the obvious fact that \"gay\" often doesn't even make sense in most contexts in which it is used to describe something or someone. Take for example when you are hanging around with your friends and you say something along the lines of, \"Why won't you come out tonight? Stop being gay.\" There is nothing gay about staying in. You mean stop being lazy? Anti-social? Lame? Is there really no better adjective you can find in your brain to use -- one that is not only more politically correct but also more accurate for the point you're trying to make?\n\nJustifying your use of these words by saying \"I didn't mean it offensively,\" doesn't make it okay. Not only does it show ignorance, but it also shows a concerning lack of intellect. Yes, context is important.\n\nBut it's the implication behind it that is the problem.\n\nIf you are calling someone a faggot or gay, you are still using the term in a condescending, demeaning and often insulting manner. You never say, \"This new guy I am dating is so fun and sweet! He always acts like such a faggot.\"\n\n\"But it's just a word!\" Some people argue that by rejecting the word you could potentially give it more power, making it taboo or more controversial, and that they choose to use it as a means of \"reclaiming\" it. I am not suggesting you ban these words from your vocabulary; I am suggesting you don't use them if you are doing so with the intent to insult.\n\nYou don't get to impose your own meaning on words and use them on, or against, other people... at least not while holding the ignorant belief it will go without ridicule -- that the context you're using it in is excusable. You can't reclaim something without a thorough understanding of where it came from and the problem surrounding it. And the fact that you use it so carelessly leads me to assume you don't have that thorough understanding.\n\nTo you, it may be \"just a word.\" If so, you are fortunate. A lot more fortunate than others who have a lot of pain and suffering tied to it. Sure, it's not a big deal to everyone, but just because it doesn't affect some people doesn't mean it isn't your obligation to care about who it may -- and why.\n\nThe best depiction of the problem with this word, and one that forever changed the way I view it, was a scene from comedian Louis C.K.'s show, Louie. The particular scene is of him and his friends playing poker, poking fun at their gay friend, and asking a number of questions about \"gay things.\"\n\nLouie asked him if he thought he shouldn't be using the word \"fag\" on stage during his routines. His friend responded by saying:\n\nI think you should use whatever words you want. When you use it on stage, I can see it's funny, and I don't care. But are you interested in what it might mean to gay men? Well, the word 'faggot' really means a bundle of sticks used for kindling in a fire. Now, in the middle ages, when they used to burn people they thought were witches? They used to burn homosexuals, too. And, they used to burn the witches at a stake, but they thought the homosexuals were too low and disgusting to be given a stake to be burnt on, so they used to just throw them in with the kindling, with the other faggots. So that's how you get 'flaming faggot.'\n\n... You might wanna know that every gay man in America has probably had that word shouted at them while they're being beaten up, sometimes many times, sometimes by a lot of people all at once. So, when you say it, it kind of brings that all back up. But, you know, by all means, use it. Get your laughs. But, you know, now you know what it means.\nBe responsible. Hold yourself accountable. Pay attention to the words you use, the way you articulate yourself, and be aware of how the things you say may affect people around you. At the very least, take the time to...\n\nhttps://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/8011324", "author": "Nikki E."}

They always seem somewhat annoyed to see customers arrive after 11, yet they diligently stay open far later. \n\nWhatever the reason, I'm glad they do. Their late night menu may not be as expansive during the day, but it is more than enough to blow you away with flavor and variety. Usually it seems to consist just of tacos and sausages, but unlike you might expect, quite a variety of meats are still available. \n\nMost noteworthy, cochanita pibil is still around. Let me tell you, after a later-than-I-probably-should-on-a-weeknight adventure, few things taste better than a delicious cochanita taco loaded up with spicy salsa. It's just the right amount of grease for a solid late night without being too harsh on the digestive system. \n\nI need to come back sometime at normal hours and get tlaiudas.

I don't know if it's the banana leaf or just their recipe, but something about it made it so rich and moist.  I feel like normally, the masa in the tamale tends to be a bit like dry cornbread, but this one was so buttery smooth and melted in your mouth.  The mole gave a nice velvety complement to the masa.\n\nAs bonus points, the friends I went out with were both vegetarians, and there were ample options for them to choose from.  I'm a pretty avid carnivore, but I would definitely go back to try their ratatouille-like banana leaf tamale.  More bonus points, we got coconut water which came in a full coconut, complete with a spoon to scoop out some of the coconut flesh!

Ox Penis, Durian, Pig Eye Balls, 1,000 Year Old Egg, Alligator, Blood Sausage....BRING IT ON!!! As long as it doesn't make me sick, I'm down for anything (well, almost).\n\nI HATE bugs and I normally get a bottle of hairspray to kill them just to avoid any contact. However, when I heard about the Grasshopper Tacos earlier this year on Yelp, something made me want to try them. \n\nOn Saturday, 12/4/10, I finally tried the Grasshopper Taco. My friend and I came to La Oaxaque\u00f1a Bakery and Restaurant at 11:50 AM and they were still in the midst of opening shop. \n\nDO NOTE: The business hours on Yelp are INCORRECT. On the weekends, they are open from 12 Noon to 3 AM and they have a food cart outside until 5 AM. \n\nF O O D:\n*GUAC & CHIPS ($5.95): I told the waitress that we wanted guac added to our tacos but we somehow managed to get guac & chips instead. The guac was made with ripen avocados with an ultra buttery texture. It was lacking heat, so I had to slather hot sauce on it. The chips tasted hard and stale. \n\n*GRASSHOPPER TACO ($2.75): Meh, salty and dry! Fellow Yelper Heather C. had previously tried it and she told me they were super salty and she was right. The friend I went with compared the grasshoppers to eating dried shrimp which was a good comparison. \n\nThe corn tortilla was dry, then to add fried overly salted grasshoppers that was equally dry tasted like I was eating the Morton Salt carton with prickly legs. I literally had to douse guac all over the tacos just to add some type of texture contrast. It really didn't do much b/c in the end it was still too dry to eat (comfortably that is). \n\n*CHICKEN MOLE CORN LEAF TAMALE ($2.75): DRY AND BLAND! We originally wanted the much hyped banana leaf tamale but the waitress said the wait was 2 hours! So instead, we got the corn leaf tamale. The edges of the masa were hard and crunchy and the chicken was dry and stringy. There was very little mole sauce and what little of it looked like it evaporated into the dry chicken. Hmmm, was the tamale from the previous night's batch?\n\n*PUPUSAS ($2.95 ea):\nThe thick corn tortillas was crisp on the outside and soft in the inside however the fillings were very skimpy. \n\n-Beans and Cheese: The beans were creamy and rich and the cheese added a savory saltiness. \n-Pork: Dry and stringy. \n\n*TRES LECHES CAKE ($3): OVERHYPED! Don't hate me, but I honestly don't understand the hype around this cake. The cake was a sponge cake filled and topped with a light buttercream frosting. It looked and tasted like any white cake I can get from Safeway except the bottom layer was soaking in evaporated milk. I guess I was expecting the cake to a have a distinct \"milky\" taste and to me the only distinctive taste was butter and sugar. \n\nS E R V I C E:\nThe waitress was very nice but the food took forever to come. At the time, we were the only one there and it took over 20 mins to get the tacos and another 10 mins for the papusas and the tamale. I can't imagine how long the wait would be if the restaurant was packed. \n\nP A R K I N G: \nDifficult metered parking on weekends but not impossible. \n\nAside from the Grasshopper Tacos satisfying my need for adventurous eating, the rest of the food items were meh. Maybe we came on an off day or at the wrong time, who knows but I can't justify coming back for mediocrity. HOWEVER, as much as I hate bugs esp spiders I DO want to try the Tarantula Tacos!

We were craving something sweet to top off the night and this place happened to be nearby. Unfortunately, the only dessert they had left was flan. The portion seemed a little small to split for our group, so I added a pitcher of what turned out to be the most insanely delicious Mexican hot chocolate you will ever drink. And of course, a fried grasshopper taco. \n\nThe taco wasn't the best and not because it had fried bugs in it. I've had grasshoppers and locusts before, so I'm not averse to eating creepy-crawlies. Unfortunately, the spicy sauce that accompanied the taco was one of those \"all we did was add pepper and no other flavor, so the sauce tastes like SPICY BURNING and nothing else\" kinds of sauces. Not a very good sauce in any context, but especially with a flavorless tortilla and crunchy, flavorless bugs (grasshoppers are really bland on their own). The upside was that my friends clearly trust me with their lives in agreeing to eat fried grasshoppers for the first time with me. You can't buy that kind of confidence! :D\n\nThe flan was really good: a firm yet soft texture, sweet without being sickeningly so, and the right amount of caramel flavor without tasting like burning (as flan sometimes tastes). \n\nBut the real winner here was the Mexican hot chocolate with spices and guajillo chili powder that I ordered on a whim. This hot chocolate deserves 10,000 stars. It is the most unique hot chocolate I have ever had across all cultures. It was thick but not viscous like American \"gourmet\" chocolate (cough*Ghirardelli*cough*), rich with the taste of natural cocoa, and most importantly, had a powerful \"smoky\" flavor that I've never had in a hot chocolate before. It was that smoky quality that had us pouring mug after mug, eyeing each other suspiciously while we tried to sneak in a little more for ourselves when we thought the others weren't looking. \n\nThe staff here, like everywhere else, were really nice and brought us the hot chocolate in a big, heat-retaining metal pitcher without being asked. I'm fairly certain they gave us extra too. :)", "author": "Josephine L."}

However, going back tonight, it seemed that things had changed since we'd been a few months before. The rice seemed worse, the tamales were not as well assembled, and although I'm not a stickler for stellar restaurant hygiene, there were so many fruit flies that we gave up trying to get rid of them. The service was also really slow - there was only one person working, it seemed, and although she was really nice, everything took a long time to come out, despite the fact that for most of the time, we were the only people in the restaurant.

We ordered at 8:15 and GrubHub said the order was expected to arrive between 9:15-9:25.  At 9:25 we called and they said our food was on it's way, it would be here in 15 minutes.... Well, we continued to call every 15 minutes for the next 2 hours and each time were told \"15 more minutes\".  The food finally arrived at 11pm.\n\nWhen the food arrived, we opened it up and it was ALL WRONG.  There were tacos and tamales in there, but not the ones we ordered.\n\nI called the restaurant to complain and was stuck on the phone for 25 minutes with a guy who said he couldn't really help me and he couldn't get a hold of his manager.  Finally he gave me his manager's number and told me to call him myself.\n\nI got a hold of the owner (Harry) on the phone.  I explained to him that we had waited 3 hours for our food, and that I had been waiting to speak to him for the last 25 minutes because the guy at the restaurant couldn't give me a refund.  \nHarry:  \"I will speak to my staff about this, not you.\"\nMe:  \"Well, will you at least promise me that you'll sort this out and give me a refund?\"\nHarry:  \"No, I'm not talking to you about this\"\nMe:  \"So you won't promise me a refund?\"\nHarry:  \"Did I say I wouldn't?!\"\nMe:  \"Well, you didn't say you would.\"\nHarry:  \"Well, I didn't say I wouldn't!  I'm not talking to you about this!\"\nMe:  \"Is this a f***ing joke?\"\nHarry (screaming, now):  \"YOU DON'T SAY F*** TO ME ON THE PHONE\".... more screaming...  he hangs up.\n\nMeanwhile, on my other phone I'm still on the line with the restaurant.  At this point, we hear the female chef from the restaurant on the phone with Harry.  She's speaking in Spanish, calling me a \"WHITE AMERICAN DEVIL\", and laughing about the fact that she knew she put the wrong food in the order, but didn't think it would be a big deal.\n\nI contacted GrubHub the next day for a refund and they contacted the restaurant.  Harry refused to give me a refund unless I apologize to HIM.  Really?  He's the one that called me a \"White American Devil\".  He's also the one who failed to provide the service that I paid over $100 for.  What a joke.\n\nI tried to contact Harry but of course a woman who answered the phone told me I wasn't allowed to talk to him.\n\nGrubHub offered me only $25 worth of free grub for this experience.  Hardly makes up for the $100+ order.  I would have expected GrubHub to be more helpful in this scenario as well, as clearly Harry knows my phone number and where I live, so I'd like to avoid any more direct contact with him if possible.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!", "author": "Michelle F."}

I'm always out for a good time, but last night's dinner was soooo yelp-worthy. Happy Birthday Olivia! \n\nI can see how you could not know of  La Oaxaque\u00f1a, it's a small place on Mission near 17th, not the greatest neighborhood to go exploring. It looks like one of those places you would just pass by, but I highly recommend you give it a try.\n\nThe prices are so reasonable, we managed to feed a party of 8 for under $80.00. That's just unheard of. The staff was very accommodating and went above and beyond our expectations.\n\nThe guacamole is great. Usually I have to doctor it up, a little lime, salt or hot sauce depending. Nothing was needed. \n\nI ordered the Crab Enchiladas, which were served with Rice and Beans with a green tomatillo sauce. They were a bit spicy, but I like it like that. The crab was fresh tasting and everyone wanted a bite. \n\nI usually have the Chicken Mole Tamale which is wrapped in a banana leaf and is under $5. It's a meal in itself. The masa is really good and the flavor of the mole is subtle yet delicious. I've been making tamales for years, so I would like to think that I know a good when when I have one.\n\nMy highlight of the night was that I had a bite of a grasshopper taco. Yes, real GRASSHOPPERS! For me, it was like an episode of Fear Factor, icky. One little girl in our party was taking bets for money to eat them and made up to $10. Haha, smart girl. They were pretty crunchy and a little too leggy for me. I needed to wash down the little feelers with a few Coronas.\n\nThey also have Vension and Ostrich Tacos, if that's your thing. I just can't. I'm surprised I had the grasshoppers! Do I have cooties now? LOL. \n\nWe had good times, lots of laughs and an excellent meal.

Al pastor should already be marinated with the pineapple so it became too sweet with the added pineapple. The revuelta pupusa was good.

We understood immediately why every review mentions the hot chocolate. \n\nThe hot chocolate came came as a pitcher of steamed chocolatey, cinnamon-infused warm goodness. The base is steamed milk--steamed milk as it's supposed to be but rarely is, with a creamy, foamy feel to the milk itself despite having only a moderate amount of foam on top, so the light, creamy, airy mouthfeel lasts till the very last drop. \n\nWe did not try anything else, and we took half the nachos home to eat the next day.

Me and the boyfriend met some friends at the restaurant. Parking wasn't too bad for a Saturday, we parked only a block away. The restaurant itself is pretty small, approximately about 6 tables. Thank goodness there weren't a lot of people when we went.\n\nThe lady who took our order was really nice but ordering was confusing, because we ordered so many different tacos. I ordered the grasshopper and ostrich taco, the boyfriend wanted to try the tarantula taco but they didn't have any. We also ordered the horchata and tres leches cake. As our orders started to come out, it got even more confusing because we didn't know which meat was which (we ordered 9 tacos all together)! \n\nNow onto the taste, the grasshoppers were super salty and I wasn't able to finish the whole thing! =[ On top of that they didn't have any ostrich meat, which was really disappointing. The horchata was really good and so was the tres leches cake (best tasting thing we ordered). I tried some of the tacos the bf ordered like the venison taco, which was the best one we ordered in my opinion.\n\nOverall every thing was pretty good (except for those salty grasshoppers) but I was disappointed that they didn't have ostrich and tarantula tacos. *sniff*", "author": "Heather C."}

Apparently driving around, celebrating & high fiving other fans really works up an appetite. I suggested the boys stop for a bacon wrapped hot dog since we were in the Mission & lo & behold, we drive right pass the cart (situated in front of La Oaxaquena.)\n\nI don't eat hot dogs (insert your own joke here) so while the guys were chomping away lovin' life, I was sipping on a Guava Jumex. (They let you eat your hot dogs in the restaurant.) There was nothing for me to do so I looked over their menu. Everything looked so good that I dragged the bf here for lunch the very next day.\n\nThe bf ordered tacos & I had:\n-- chicken mole corn leaf tamale ($2.75): I'm not usually a mole fan, but LO's is very edible, not at all overpowering. Chicken was a mix of white & dark meat & was juicy. Masa was flavorful.\n-- rajas corn leaf tamale ($2.50): tomatoes, jalapeno & cheese: slightly tangy & a little spicy. Get it!\n-- champurrados ($1.75): similar to the filipino version except in this warm horchata/chocolate drink, there are no pieces of rice; it is completely smooth, silky & foamy. Get it! \n\nI never noticed LO before but now that I've had it, I've been thinking about it constantly.

I had already checked out the menu on their website and I was so excited! Grasshopper tacos? Banana leaf tamales? Venison? Ostrich? Hellz yea! \n\nFirst if all, the staff here is wonderful & so accommodating. There were 6 of us & we tried cramming into a table for 4 but it just didn't work. The place is small so it's difficult if you have a large party. But the lovely waitress rearranged a bunch if tables just so we could all fit. How sweet! Then she helped up with out orders, letting us know if we were ordering too much or too little. \n\nI tried a bit of everything on the table (except for the grasshopper tacos, nope, just couldn't do it). The only thing that blew me away were the pupusas. I could've eaten 10 of them. Even the simple bean & cheese pupusa was amazing. The tofu mole banana leaf tamale was just OK. I guess I'm just not a fan of their mole sauce. The venison taco had good flavor but the meat was very chewy. It made if difficult to eat as a taco so I ate it open-faced. The guac was good & I liked the tri-colored tortilla chips. \n\nThey were nice enough to give us a slice of tres leches cake & flan on the house for dessert.  Sweet!", "author": "Erin S."}

Sure, they may advertise such crowd-drawing delicacies as venison, ostrich, and -- my favorite -- chapulines (grasshoppers). But they don't have these things and, from the sounds of it, haven't had them for ages. \n\nWhat's worse, they seem totally unaware that advertising such things and then not having them is problematic. When I asked the waitress why they don't seem to have any of the really cool menu items they so prominently highlight on the website, she said -- with no apparent irony -- \"Yeah, we get a lot of people who come in just because we say we have those things ...\" In other words, they're even totally aware that people come in specifically for things like chapulines and ostrich, and yet show no real concern for the fact that they don't have them or for the fact that the online menu says that they do. \n\nAnd besides, the food that we did have -- plainly traditional, wholly unremarkable, Mexican staples -- was certainly nothing special. Not particularly bad, but not particularly good, either. And nothing really at all that spoke to the place's supposed Oaxacan roots, except a smattering of mole dishes and a few tamales that were supposedly \"authentic Oaxacan\".  (The waitress didn't seem to know what made them so, and didn't seem to know very much about Mexican food more generally.)\n\nSo, why did we go here instead of to any of the other 100s of Mexican places in the Mission? Well, clearly because those other places aren't willing to lie about their offerings. That makes Oaxaquena more than a waste of time. It's also a wasted opportunity.", "author": "Ethan H."}

The walls are painted a bright cheery color and you instantly feel right at home!\n\nMy friend and I decided on the banana leaf tamale with chicken in a mole sauce, a grasshopper taco, a venison taco, and the Mexican hot chocolate. Can I just say that the hot chocolate was AMAZING?! It definitely IS one of the best I've tasted! HMMmmmm!! So delicious!\nThe venison taco was OK...kinda sparse on the meat; however, the grasshopper taco was pretty tasty! The grasshoppers were light, crispy, slightly salty, and lemony! Heck, I would buy a bag of them and eat that instead of chips!\nBanana leaf tamale = delicious! It's fun to unwrap it :) There was a choice of chicken or turkey, so I think next time I'll try turkey!\n\nThe only downside to the meal was the SUPER spicy side of onions and jalapeno peppers that they put on top of the tacos. Be warned! Even though I pushed them off to the side, the spicy-ness was still on part of the taco :( I was literally tearing up and perspiring.\n\nThe tacos were kinda expensive ($5.95 each!), but I mean, venison and grasshoppers?! They're so unique! The Mexican hot chocolate was definitely worth the price. There's A LOT...easy to share between 2, maybe even 3 people. The tamale was very reasonable too and it was a generous-sized portion!\n\nThe staff is very nice and helpful!

This place is a win in my book because it has some Oaxacan specialties like tlayuda.  So my experience here is about expanding my Mexican palate rather than comparing the upteenth-million carnitas (which I didn't even see on the menu).\n\nGuacamole: So it's not hand hacked at your table, but despite the lack of showmanship it still tastes extremely fresh.  I liked that it had chunks of avocado instead of that nasty baby food-style pur\u00e9e you get at some joints.\n\nTlayuda: I thought I knew Mexican, but this was a new treat for me.  The size of a medium pizza, this crispy double layer tortilla is topped with refried beans, non-melted cheese, lettuce, avocado and probably other goodies.  I think it's baked, not fried, so it has a really light texture which is a good thing considering the daunting size.  This could potentially be a meal for two non-obese people!\n\nTinga de Pollo: Hmm, so soft and so spicy!  This is a perfect topping for whatever dish you wish to consume it on.  Way better than that asado stuff.\n\nChicken Mole Enchiladas: Everyone raves about the mole sauce, but I wasn't a huge fan.  It didn't taste as complex as it should and had a weird funk to it.  The chicken inside was dry and boring... maybe I was spoiled by the tinga de pollo?\n\nCrab Enchiladas: Boo!  The salsa verde on top was awesome and pairs so well with shellfish, if only the crab was better.  This seemed to be the minced sort of crab from a can rather than fresh large chunks.  I would have gladly paid extra for the real deal...\n\nMango Lemonade: The lemonade base was both sweet and tangy, a nice balance.

There weren't too many places that were still open so we chose this place to grab some quick food. After walking through the poorer streets of SF (it is still not as bad as home), we walked inside the tiny store of La Oaxaquena. We ordered several kinds of tacos and oh my goodness, they were superb. Their sauce was spicy and sour (my favorite style) top with radishes. Their tacos taste different from the tacos I have ever had which makes me sad because it will probably be a while before I return to SF. I definitely recommend this place to taco lovers!", "author": "Thy T."}

That was the first thing I noticed as I scanned the menu at this classic hole-in-the wall taqueria.  Now most people would be freaked out by the bugs, but my reaction was different.  Immidiately I'm thinking, \"This place bleeds authenticity.\"  I was in the mood for a super burrito, \"wet,\" with pork, so that is what I opted for.  THIS WAS PORK PERFECTION!  This was bar-none, the best burrito with pork I've ever had.\n\n(+) The pork was cecina, a bit different than the standard carnitas I usually see.  If you are unfamiliar with cecina, look it up.  All I can say is dried, salted, cured, spiced, fatty perfection.  \n\n(+) The burrito was capped off with a perfect distrobution of classic \"super burrito fixins,\" like refried beans, rice, cheese, sour cream and guacamole, not to mention a healthy dose of fresh cilantro.\n\n(+) The mole was excellent as well.  Much better than the average taqueria\n\n(+) I also tried a side of guacamole to dip the complimentary tortilla chips, and that was very tasty too.  Again, no skimping on cilantro in the guac.\n\n(+) This place is SUPER CHEAP.  6 bucks for the burrito, and a couple more for the guac and a Mexican Coke.  Not surpising prices for a taqueria, but notable considering how great the food was.\n\n(-) The tortilla chips were a bit weak. They tasted store-bought.  \n\nI ENJOYED THE SERVICE.  I was not vigorously attended to, but the server was friendly, informative, and I easily got in and out fast enough to return to work on time.  I tend to enjoy places that don't nag you with service, and come on people: What kind of cheap taqueria has five star, super attentive service?  You don't go to taquerias for that.  In fact, I don't even expect or hope to converse in English.  Why, you ask?  Because there is no need to.  If you've ever been to a taqueria, the whole process is pretty damn simple.  I think a monkey could figure it.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:\n\n(+) An incredible taqueria, and one of the only spots to offer cecina.", "author": "Matthew S."}

I style myself a bit of a mole snob, and I've never been too excited about the mole options in this city.  La Oaxaquena does it right.  Try their mole chicken enchiladas -- these aren't your typical gross, gooey, cheesy enchiladas; they're just chicken wrapped in a corn tortilla with a bucket of mole sauce poured over it and a sprinkling of cotija cheese (served with mediocre beans and rice).  I'd mainline the mole sauce if I could.  It is rich, thick, and full of flavor.\n\nThe tlayuda with tinga de pollo was also a hit.  (Compare the tinga here versus anywhere else, like the burrito place in South Park -- night and day).  The tamales and sopes were perfectly good, but nothing to gush about.  Portions were substantial, and the prices ridiculously low.\n\nMy only nit -- and it's a significant one given that La Oaxaquena would otherwise be a sure fire 5 star wonder -- is that the cooks have a heavy hand with the salt.  Easily corrected, but it scares me a bit that the problem showed up in every dish we ordered...  I also wasn't a fan of the hot chile dust that seeps into the restaurant from their taco cart outside.  My eyes!", "author": "Laurence W."}

However they didn't pick up, it took five more times before I could order the tamales in Spanish but the tamales made my pre-thanksgiving dinner special.  They were moist and full of mole and chicken.  Just as others have claimed, the banana leaf tamale was large enough for two people to share.  They are 3.75 each so I brought four. \n\nThe restaurant itself is really small and hidden away.  I had to really look for it.   I liked the service as soon as I got there.  The restaurant had my tamales nicely packed up in boxes and a receipt by the time I got there.  They even gave me a small container of red chile sauce that went super with the tamales.  I will definitely ask for extra sauce next time.  The tamales are best eaten fresh but steam them if you have it the next day.  They are hard to microwave.

Yeah, I talked to the owner (Harry), and while I was picking my \"meat\" option, he said the City Health Dept would no longer allow them to serve bugs.  That sucks, I was looking forward to munching on an insect.  Government jag-offs!  \n\n[Note:  this was in April, hopefully it's still not the case.  I do see that tarantula is still a seasonal offering on their online menu.]\n\nOh well, La Oaxaque\u00f1a still had plenty to offer.  My mission in the Mission was to have a few tacos.  I went with:  Tequila Chicken, Coconut Chicken, Chipotle Chicken, and pastor (aka Pineapple Pork).  I washed it all down with the Mexican hot chocolate everyone raved about.\n\nMan o Man!  This was some tasty food!  Each of the tacos were distinct and exploded with flavor.  I sat and devoured each one like a ceremony, religiously.  The lubricant for this sustenance was excellent as well.  I would definitely come back here again for some grub (hopefully, I can get some bugs though---shh, shh, even if its on the down-low!).\n\nI chatted with a guy by the name of Harry (I believe he was the owner).  He filled me in on the restaurant (I believe he said they have three restaurants), and how business is going in the Mission (sadly, the economy is hitting them hard).  He was super nice though, and the food was excellent.  \n\nIf you want some tasty Mexican food with an extensive (and sometimes exotic) menu, this is a place to check out.  They also had some hippie options as well (non-meat).  Hmmm...I wonder if vegetarians can eat bugs?  Wait, I think I just answered my question.  A bug isn't a vegetable.

Some friends of mine and I decided to pop round the corner for a bit to eat and when in the Mission there is only one choice for a late night nibble, meat and lots of it.\n\nWith a variety of choices to be had within a 3 block radius, we listed out the variables which would help narrow our search.   \n1) No Street Meat\n2) No morning trots\n3) No Rickets\n4) No mystery Bay fish\n\nThrough a natural choice of the above, we selected La Oaxaque\u00f1a Bakery and Restaurant.  It was a cold night and almost did not go in as it was packed, but oddly enough it did not look, smell or feel like a typical Mission Tacoria.  La Oaxaque\u00f1a had a warmth that reminded me of the proper restaurants in San Pablo where locals would stay for hours ordering food constantly as new friends would leave and new friends would join them.\n\nAnyway, we were delighted at the variety of meat types ranging from roasted chicken to Grasshoppers.  Yes, you heard it, grasshoppers.  Moving on we chose the Mexican Hot Chocolate.  Since the whole table followed suit, the waiter brought us a cauldron of the dark brown liquid which exuded deep rich smells of exotic spices and coco.  It was a perfect starter as it warmed up our bodies and loosed our laughter lines.\n\nNext we moved to ordering a variety of tacos and enchiladas.  The thought was to try as many dishes so everyone had a chance to taste everything.  Needless to say, I ordered a grasshopper taco and an ostrich taco. I know I was showing off a bit, but to be fair I am a huge fan of ostrich as it is a meat that is liken to a cross between Filet Mignon and velvet.  It is quite hard to find in the city and is well worth the search.  This taco is worth eating open faced with a fork and a knife and it was mighty tasty to say the very least.\n\nAs for the grasshopper taco, it was actually quite unique.  What they did was toss organically raised grasshoppers with lime, onion and spices then they stir-fry them until they are crispy.  On the plate, that are unmistakably bugs, but they have the flavor of a summer fair.

The first time was in late August when my friend from Philly who has been living in Hong Kong visited me; he craved cheap Mexican because he couldn't get that as easily in Hong Kong. We arrived around 9pm on a Monday, ordered two pupusas and a pork-pineapple taco at the counter, and waited close to half an hour for our food. The food tasted like it's been reheated and was not hot enough. My friend's two pupusas also tasted the same although one was supposed to be chicken (just tasted like cheese) and the other was sundried tomatoes and goat cheese. The horchata was diluted too. My friend was intrigued by the grilled tarantula taco on the menu, but they said it's only available on weekends. I attributed the lackluster food to an off night since we were there late on a Monday night.\n\nI revisited last Thursday at 7p, and was greeted by a server who sat us and took our order at our table. I'm not sure if they've always had table service as every time I've been here previously I ordered at the counter. Anyway my boyfriend ordered a carne asada burrito ($8-9) and I ordered the turkey mole banana leaf tamale ($4-5). They gave us tortilla chips, spicy salsa and water while we waited. My tamale's masa arrived very hot but when I got to the turkey mole in the middle, the turkey was still cold. Our server came by to check on us, and reheated the tamale for me. The masa was good, but I found the dark mole too sweet. I've had dark mole homemade (with chocolate) by my friend from Mexico that was delicious and not as sweet.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-09", "description": "Horrible experience here. \n\nMy friend and I came here at 9pm. We ordered: guacamole, queso & loraco (sp?) pupusa, 2 chicken mole in banana leaf, Mexican hot chocolate. And water. The guy who took our order was very nice, initially. We sat there for 40 minutes and nothing came. We watched people who came in after us get their food. I'm timid and was not hungry so I would have waited forever more. My friend was hungry and started asking about the food, the water, the chips, anything?! \n\nWe start asking for our food. Maybe the water and chips? We asked someone who later turned out to be the owner. Others started bringing out food. They tried to give us rice&beans, sopas; not our food. They gave us a pupusa and 1 banana leaf. I looked at it and told my friend \"Touch the pupusa. Is it warm?\" It looks cold. We tried the tamale, it's ok but lukewarm.  The fact it's lukewarm and other people got their food before us means the problem is not with the kitchen. They're making the food fine but it's not getting brought out.\n\nWe remind them we are still waiting for chips and another tamale and hot chocolate. And where's our water? We watch the guy who took our order. He's already giving off vibes that he's angry with slamming of cups etc.  He fills 2 cups of water. Oh goody, our water. Nope, it's for another table. The hot chocolate comes, in a good-sized silver container with 2 mugs. Foamy on top. Our second tamale comes and it's steamy hot. The fact it's delicious because it's hot only highlights how poor the first one is.\n\nWe ask for water again. My friend goes to the counter to ask. That's when the guy who took our order snapped. He initially apologized, then he snaps. He says how they're very busy and he's doing his best and if we want service we \"should go to a four-star restaurant where they have 4 waiters waiting on you.\"  He's mad, slamming things. He fills the water cups and rather than handing it to my friend who standing at the counter, he walks around (behind a wall where we can't see him) and puts it on the table, angrily saying how they're doing the best they can for these prices. (The order of what happened may be reconstructed inaccurately, but he did say all of these things.)\n\nI am extremely uncomfortable now. As in, I-don't-want-to-eat-here-because-god-knows-what-they're-going-to-do-in-the-kitchen-with-our-food. You have to experience this yourself to understand why it was so horrible. I ask my friend if she wants to leave without paying as we have eaten 3 bites of our food and there's still food missing. She agrees to leave and goes to the counter to tell them we're leaving and want to pay. \n\nThen the owner comes out with the chips; the guacamole looks amazing. He says for us to stay and eat since he was planning to comp us anyway. She pulls out cash to pay but he says it's ok. He's the reason why they even get a second star; he was very nice and tried to address this issue. He said the guy is normally back of the house and had to be in the front. He said for us to come back and try it in the daytime when he, the owner, is there. \n\nHowever, I will NEVER come back here again for fear of what the kitchen would do to my food. Hey, I've watched \"Waiting\" with Ryan Reynolds; I know what goes on in the kitchen.  Whenever I've read reviews like this, I think \"God, you're such a baby. Stop whining about the service. Who cares?\" I learned something last night. I do expect one thing: the food! You can ignore us, you can leave my water glass bone-dry, you can throw our food on the table, the floors can be sticky and dirty, the walls can be covered in grease and graffiti, but first, you must bring the water and food. \n\nAnd the guy's reasoning is bullsh*t. There are plenty of eateries within walking distance whose food is just as good at similar prices and they don't yell at you for wanting a glass of water. And to tell us to eat somewhere else? I grew up working in a restaurant and when food took a long time or we forgot, we apologized/lied about how it was coming, how something was taking longer to cook etc. Sure, we would lie, make up excuses, whatever it took to appease the customer but we NEVER, ever told a customer that they were expecting too much. I definitely never told them to eat somewhere else. I thought it, but I never said it to the customer. Because they will take you up on this offer. \n\nIn SHORT, the hot food is tasty, pricing is good, sizes are large. If you sit for 40 minutes without anything coming, just leave so you don't end up getting scolded by the staff and unable to ever have a chance to try the food.", "author": "Yan E."}

Incredibly slow, but sweet.\n\nNow about the food:\n-Sat down and our order wasn't taken for a good 10-15 minutes.\n-We got guacamole to start. (20 minutes into the meal) I'm a huge lover of avocados, and usually that sh*t is all eaten up within minutes. But this guacamole? I don't even know if I could call it that. Reconstituted greenish mush would be closer than guacamole. It reminded me of when you buy huge bulk things of frozen guac at Costcos (did it once, never again), and then doctored it up with a bunch of junk like tomatoes and jalapenos, this would be the end-product. It was NOT GOOD. We did not eat it. Not even with the tri-colored chips (really? is it really neccicary to have vivid green and red chips?).\n-45 minutes in and we get our meal. Wait... I got MY meal. A Torta sandwich. My ladyfriend person? Nope, she didn't order the burrito. So we had to wait. My torta was meh/fine. Nothing to write home about. Had 3 measly slices of unripe avocado and gristly chicken. Bah humbug.\n-55 minutes in and her nachos arrive. Seriously 3 lbs of nachos. Huge. Rediculous. Unneccicary. They weren't bad, but like, its like 3 pounds of mediocre food. Super meh. \n\nAfter waiting a long time for the check, I decided it made more sense for me to just go up to the counter to get it done. At this point we had spent well over an hour in this semi-depressing joint. I have no doubt that people love this place- I mean- in the middle of our meal this crazy hipsterbilly chick came in and (IM NOT KIDDING) started CRYING about how these people closed up shop and how she could never find the perfect burrito and how COULD they have left her alone and tacoless. She was crying. She was on drugs, but still she was crying. So at least someone likes their food.\n\nI just figure if a place has like, 4 starts, its gonna be good.

We couldn't finish it: chips and guacomole,  some crispy quesadilla type pizza (it's HUGE), 1 regular chicken tamale, and 1 banana leaf tamale, and a burrito.   I like tamales and this one just satisfied my craving.  Too bad they didn't offer a wet tamale...that would have been the ultimate (used to get those somewhere in Sacramento)!  The banana leaf tamale was different for me because of the flavor and consistency.  I don't think I would order it again.  The burrito was good and huge, you can't go wrong with just your typical steak.  With all this food, we barely touched the quesadilla-like pizza.  However, I'm not that big of a fan because the quesadilla is crispy and a little bland.  The chips and guacomole was good...so much guacomole it felt like it would never end.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this place is the service.  I agree with other yelpers is the fact that the service is SLOW.  We waited at least 30 minutes for our chips and guacomole followed 10 minutes later with all of our entrees.  I don't know what took them so long...baking their colorful chips in the back??? There was one nice waiter who seated us, but the other guy seemed bitter at his job.  Unfortunately, we ended up with the bitter guy who was not attentive to his customers.", "author": "Lisa W."}

With each bite I took, I either said out loud (or in my mind) OH MY GOD. Amazing. The masa is usually a pretty boring part of a tamale, but that is not the case with this bad boy. The masa was so flavorful and moist. The tangy-ness of the green sauce worked well with the slightly sweet and salty masa. The chicken was tender and delish.\n\nOh my goodness, I almost forgot - the tamale is HUGE. I was nervous at first when my friend told me that one would be enough... I have a pretty healthy appetite, but luckily I took her advice. The tamale was literally the size of a magazine. Ok, maybe not EXACTLY that big, but one tamale is definitely a meal. I couldn't finish mine.\n\nI can't wait to try the tamale with mole next time.", "author": "Tatiana J."}

I love various Mexican dishes in green sauce, but I'm super picky about it, and this is one of the tastiest recipes I've had.  The first time I went, I had the enchiladas verdes with chicken, and cleaned the entire plate, which was not small.  The second time, they had crab enchiladas verdes, and being a huge crab fan, I had to try it.  Same fantastic green sauce, though the sweetness of the crab was a little weird with it.\n\nThey have some tasty mole as well, though my boyfriend (who is the real mole aficionado) has mentioned, the recipe seems to change a bit from trip to trip.  We inquired about this once, and our waiter said that they buy the mole at market in Mexico and it's a family recipe, so sometimes it might be made slightly differently.  WOW!\n\nThe enchiladas come with the requisite rice & beans, which I think are fantastic and not just garnish, the way they are at some Mexican places.  I mix them in with the green sauce & eat every last bite. :)\n\nThe horchatas are giant, and taste like melted cinnamon-and-nutmeg ice cream, so be forewarned if you don't like extra-sweet horchata.  You can also get Mexican hot chocolate, which is quite tasty, and comes in enormous quantities.  The next time I'm there, I want to get the made-fresh-on-the-spot guacamole, which the folks at the table next to us had on our last visit.", "author": "Angela B."}

A giant tamale the size of your head, plus rice and beans for less than $8?  A giant bowl of guacamole for $4?  The portions here are so generous and the prices are great to boot!\n\n#2.  The service is wonderful.  I'm so accustomed to counter service at taquerias that it was great having a waiter who actually HAD an opinion about the things we ordered.  He came back to our table when he noticed no one had ordered the mole and told us that they were famous for it.  We just promised him we'd come back to try it... and we definitely will!\n\n#3.  Mexican Hot Chocolate.  The last time I ordered Mexican Hot Chocolate in a taqueria, it was just Abuelita Cocoa crushed in a cup of warmed up milk.  This was SERIOUS hot chocolate... by far the best I've had in general in a long time.  It had cinnamon and almost maple syrup flavors that mixed together into a perfect symphony of chocolatey goodness.\n\n#4.  Convenience.  It's close to BART and within walking distance of a lot of bars.  They also have an outdoor taco stand if you want something to go.\n\n#5.  BAKERY.  Don't forget about that part in their title.  Their frig window next to the counter serves up some amazing looking Pastel de Tres Leches and Flan.  I was too full to indulge yesterday, but like I said before... I'll definitely be back!

I don't really like mole sauce. But if you like mole sauce, you will like their mole sauce. \n\nYou can also get tacos with one of two types of fish: talapia or salmon. I got both and preferred the talapia over the salmon. Talapia is a mild fish that does well with salsa and cilantro. Salmon is too strong to really go well with the spices. \n\nSave room for desserts. The desserts alone make it worth the trip. The have a full bakery and also have a kick-ass flan. The flan was my favorite part of the meal. It's distinct though. If you're one of those people who like your flan really eggy and jello-like, you will not like theirs.

My friend that lived in oaxaca (mx) for ethnic studies research told me everything was spot on compared to the traditional stuff he had there.\n\nIf you only get one dish here ever, make it their tamal de mole negro (chicken mole, black), steamed in a BANANA LEAF.  The inside was the corn meal paste (as usual), wrapping up a dark, chocolaty chicken mole', but the banana leaf took this tamal to a whole new level.  Kinda made it taste like southeast asian food to me.  really subtle and amazing.  AND CHEAP at like $3 or so for one huge tamal.\n  \nThe Tlayuda was like a mexican pizza.  but WAY better than taco bell's.  Nice crunchy flat \"tostada\" base, with lettuce, cheese, and meat of your choice on top.  And dthey ahve some great meats like the milanesa (breaded pork), cochinita pibil, and other meats that are traditional oaxacan.  Great for tacos too!\n\nThey also sell chapulines by the bag--though they will bring it out to you on a plate if you like.  These are grasshoppers, pan-fried with chili and limes.  Tip--don't eat the big hind legs. These are pretty good with beer, but definitely not for the faint of heart.\n\nthey also have a signature oaxacan drink called chamborrado--some kind of chocolate-rice-maybe corn starch drink.  a really viscous drink with chocolate flavor.\n\nAnd they have a dulce de leche that rocks pretty hard.  If you come on a birthday, they will make you a birthday cake ON THE HOUSE, and ON THE SPOT, and even write the birthday boy/girl's name on the cake.  Last time I was there for Don H's birthday, it was a dulce de leche cake soaked with coffee sauce instead of your typical sweet milk.  delicious, and quite nice of the place to give a birthday gift that awesome!  :)\n\nMy only complaint about the place is the tiny tiny size, and the service is sometimes slow, though always friendly.", "author": "Fong L."}

Don't mind as the portion of guacamole was large and it was probably the best thing about the meal.\n\nWe both got a Oaxacan chicken tamale and I also got a pupusa with \"revuelta\", pork.

The best mole I've had and it's right around the corner from me!!!\n\nSo, let me start this review by stating that I am a vegetarian and went with another of my kind.  As such, I can't rate a lot of the items here, but they do have a very good vegetarian selection and can make most things vegetarian.\n\nThe experience started with walking in and finding a surprisingly nice place for the block it's on and being welcomed by the very friendly folks that worked there.  Looking through the menu, we weren't sure what everything meant since only some things had an English translation, so we just asked the waiter to recommend something good vegetarian.  His first recommendation was to get the mole enchiladas without chicken.  Given that is one of my favorite dishes, I was ecstatic.  My friend got the spinach and cheese tamales.  We also got guacamole and chips for a starter (didn't see it on the menu but everyone was ordering it) along with a bottle of Mexican Coke.  There are more dishes there which I need to try on future visits, but let's limit this review to the above dishes for now.\n\nThe guac was pretty damn good.  Definitely not the best I had, as I prefer it a bit spicy, but overall, very flavorful and chunky which I do like.  The chips were so-so.  Not bad, but could use a bit more salt.  The tamale was decent.  Not the best I've had, but certainly very satisfying and, one was large enough to serve as a decent meal.\n\nBut, the mole, oh my goodness, the mole enchiladas.  I've had decent mole at Puerto Allegre on Valencia, but other than that, hadn't found great mole anywhere in the Bay Area but La Fiesta in Mountain View.  This, though, blew me away.  It was a bit spicy, but not too much.  A bit sweet, but not too much.  A bit smoky, but not too much.  Combine all that with the raw onions on top and the stuff was phenomenal.  The first few bites were an explosion of taste and it never let up after that.\n\nTo top all of it off, as we were paying our bill, the waiter gave us a slice of cake, on the house, to take with us for dessert later.  It was pretty good as well and given the entire dinner was $17, I felt like I was ripping them off somehow by getting this bonus.  I'm sure there's a cliche about a cake and eating in here somewhere.\n\nNot everything here is the best I've ever eaten, but it was all good, and the mole is what puts the food here into 5-star territory.  The service is at least 4 stars and quite possibly 5.  The ambience is not why you go to a place like this so don't bother if that's what you're looking for.  I just hope I have the will power to order something other than the mole enchiladas next time I go visit the restaurant.  Maybe I should just stick to their taco cart for some variety. :-)", "author": "Anand M."}

Served with roasted jalapenos and fresh chunky salsa, who could ask for more? The owner-- I should have gotten his name-- even hooked us up with some habanero salsa.\n\nOn the slight downside, the horchata was  not improved--not cinnamony enough for my taste-- and the chips a bit stale. That cost them a star. But if I lived in the area, I'd come here all the time. Will be back to try the pupusas --  aren't those salvadorean?

My to-go order took more than 25 min even when the place was relatively empty.

It did give more flavor, but there was just a tad too much on my taco, however its not a make or break thing. I also wasn't a fan of their carne asada (I tried my boyfriend's taco), and it wasn't too flavorful. But I am excited to take a trip back to eat more of their delicious food!", "author": "Lisa B."}

The wait staff is very friendly and willing to accomodate--typically Oaxacan!\n\nBut...\n\nThe tlayuda is not prepared fresh. The tostada underneath is premade, which makes it chewy, not crisp. They have quesillo, the distinctly-flavored Oaxacan cheese that helps give a tlayuda its unique taste, but the tlayuda we split (they're large) came with pinto refried beans, not the usual Oaxacan black beans, and they didn't taste like they'd been flavored with epazote.\n\nWe also split a Oaxacan-style tamal (chicken and mole wrapped in a banana leaf). It also tasted like it'd been made previously then heated before serving. It did not look or taste like a tamal that came out of a steamer.\n\nSo there's that. La Oaxaquena also serves tamal tortas, liquados, and, uh...some other Mexican food that isn't particularly Oaxaqueno. They had mojarra frito one night as a special, and advertise barbacoa de chivo on the weekends. They were out of chapulines when we were there; those things happen.\n\nI'm rooting for this place, but Number 1 on the to-do list is fresh tlayudas.", "author": "Suzanne C."}

Well worth the trip to the Mission. We'll be back again as soon as we can!  It's a very small storefornt. With a sidewalk vendor out front. Pretty much right across the street from Thrit Town. (Remember the 17 Reasons Why sign?) \n\nSadly, no chapulinas. But everything we had was wonderful. And the staff was delightful. We started with a gigantic mole banana leaf wrapped tamale and the salt cod fritters. (see photos.) We just ordered a bunch dishes & didn't know what to expect. These two dishes were really exceptional. We shared them and LOVED them! And the chef, Herbert, enjoyed with how much we enjoyed the food. We also had the papusas and huaraches and fajitas. For dessert, Herbert brought us a slice of his special cheese flan - made with Manchego & cheddar, rich and creamy and topped with the traditional caramel. Also enjoyed the hot chocolate.  Wish I could make it at home! And we also sampled another drink - I didn't catch the name - but it was a hot sweet rice drink something like horchata. And then we  took home a slice of creamy cake. We were happily stuffed. Wonderfully prepared food for a very modest price. Lost count of all the food, but I think we had 6 - 8 plates for about $50. A delicious assortment of unusual flavors. Buzzed with sugar and the excitement of a good meal. And we were ready for more again by breakfast - but we'll have to wait for our next trip.", "author": "Tara M."}

The place is small and the service not very fast, but it is quiet (except for the 7 or so tables of people laughing and enjoying themselves, even without alcohol) with no loud music, and the staff is very friendly.

But I saw that they had a number of mole dishes and lots of other tasty things.  The guy we ordered with who works the counter was ridiculously friendly and helpful with recommendations.  I asked him straight up if they could make a vegetarian cheese enchilada with mole sauce.  He thought for a moment, and then said sure, even though it wasn't really on the menu.  My friend got the Tlayuda with beef. It was quite a large and flat tortilla covered in tomatoes and cheese and avocado on a giant plate.  She said she was starving, but she still couldn't finish it.  You could share it for two people.  I let her taste my delectable mole dish and she was impressed as well.\n\nThe atmosphere is cheery, simple, friendly, and authentic, not fancy or cheesy with fake murals of cacti or anything.  At the end, I asked the dude (whose name I now wish I had asked) for a dessert recommendation.  They have a giant case full of yummy mexican pastries, and he pointed to those, but then he recommended the flan, and it was amazing!  I am not a flan connoisseur, but it was incredibly delicious, cold, creamy, and sweet.\n\nIf you haven't gone, go now! But go early cause it's small if you want a table.  And get their horchata to drink.", "author": "Kyle T."}

Completely fantastic, and very inexpensive!\nIt don't look like much on the outside (or really on the inside either - ah sweet fluorescent lighting, how I love you), but damn is the food amazing.\n\nThe mole negro is seriously The Shit.  Blacker than black, rich, intense, smokey, and with a great fiery kick.  I've never had mole like this before, so I am forced to assume this is seriously authentic.  It's available in many forms, like chicken mole enchiladas, which are most excellent, or the chicken mole negro tamale, wrapped in banana leaves, which is equally unique - the banana leaves give it a decidedly different, mellower flavor than the more common corn wrapping.\n\nOn weekends, you can get the barbacoa de chivo, which is crazy holy shit good.  The meat is fall-apart-tender, and the sauce has tremendous flavor (and tremendous kick as well - not for the faint of spice!).\n\nAguas Frescas are great, and served in what must be 32oz glasses.  Ridiculously large, in fact.  But who can turn down 32 delicious ounces of horchata?  Yeah, not me.\n\nIf that all wasn't enough, they also don't serve any alcohol, so you can BYO!\n\nThe only things to be forewarned about: the place is small - they can maybe seat 25 people max, and service can get a little distracted at times, so you have to be obvious when flagging them down.\nBut trust me - it's worth it!", "author": "Don H."}

I was planning on going to El Farolito, my usually go-to taco place, but i accidentally got off at 16th Street and Mission rather than 24th Street and Mission. So, i decided to go on an adventure and find a new place to satisfy my Taco cravings.\nI walked my  La Oaxaque\u00f1a and saw SFWeekly signs outside the door and decided to go in. I ordered a Lengua Taco and a Cabeza taco. I sat down and waited a good 25-30 minutes before my taco arrived. I was slightly peeved by how long this took, since my taco run was supposed to be only a \"quick\" bite and i was anxious to hurry home to finish some more work.  BUT, once i put this taco in my mouth, i realized that it was worth the wait. There was so much flavor in this taco. Not only was the meat very flavorful, but it was also very tender. They also added a lot of yummy veggies on top of this taco like grilled onions. \n\nWhile i had been waiting for the food, i looked around at the restaurant. It was then that i realized what restaurant i walked into. I saw the name \"La Oaxaque\u00f1a\" written on the wall and suddenly realized that i was sitting in the restaurant that SF Weekly named as having one of Sfoodie's 92 best things to eat/drink in San Francisco: The Mexican Hot Chocolate. \n\nOf course, i finished my delicious tacos and go up to the register to order a Mexican Hot Chocolate. As i was waiting for the waiter to make my delicious drink, he had to suddenly go to the back to pull out a dessert. When i asked him what he was making, he started talking to me about the desserts that they had and handed me a Chocolate Flan. He handed me a spoon and told me to try it. He told me that i could take it home. A few minutes later he handed me 2 cups of Mexican Hot Chocolate. In my confusion, i told him that i only ordered one. His Reaction: This IS one order. Oh my. \nThe hot chocolate had SO much flavor; i talked to my boyfriend about it and i tried to describe the taste, but it was indescribable. There was definitely some cinnamon and earthiness to it, but it was also not very sweet, which i really liked.\n\nI called my best friend after this meal and raved about the delicious hot chocolate and the complimentary flan.

The service was excellent and they have a lot of vegan options. We started with a banana leaf tofu tamale, which was huge and yummy. Then we had a selection of pupusas -- I would recommend the navy bean and pesto -- and my husband had shrimp fajitas. You can BYOB, too. It was all really excellent and the owner even brought me over some soy horchata, when he found out I was vegan, and gave my husband some mole to try.

Food was brought out quickly and efficiently.  Prices are not hole-in-the-wall cheap but the portions are generous and the quality of the food is so much better than CanCun's motor oil burritos.\n\nWe tried the chicken tamales with mole sauce in banana leaf, chicken with mole sauce, and a chapulines (grasshopper) taco.  The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender and the mole sauce was delicious.  The tamale was gigantic yet well cooked - the cornmeal was not rubbery but was firm and tasty on its own.  The grasshopper taco required some tortilla coverage to shield it from my wife so as not to gross her out while eating.  It was also flavorful and spicy, with clear chili and lime flavors - the texture was similar to dried shrimp and the taste was similar to pork, but they might be fried in pork fat.  If you do get the grasshopper tacos, make sure to get your own horchata to quench the burn afterwards - neighbors may frown upon you getting grasshopper legs in their beverages even if it is an emergency.  Our waiter even gave us a free slice of cake at the end of the night, which we could barely paw at after stuffing ourselves for $25.  The menu features many items that aren't available at other Mexican restaurants including venison tacos.  I will definitely come back here and eat my way through the rest of the menu.", "author": "Dave S."}

Not only him but all my friends (and father) think that this is as close as it gets to real Mexican street tacos.\n\nI, on the other hand,  am a vegetarian (sometimes vegan). Thus, I cannot credit or discredit this opinion. Yet, I have to say they do look delicious packed with lime wedges, radish slices, cilantro and  chopped onions. I have to confess it does make me want to eat me some tacos. :) I always just end up finishing the radishes off my guy's  plate.\n\nAnyway, for the veggie lovers out there I truly do recommend all their vegetarian tamales. The Oaxacan (cooked in a banana leaf instead of husk) style tamales with tofu, spinach and salsa verde are to die for. I also enjoy the spinach and cheese ones.  there is a third kind but they have tomatoes and I do not like those.\n\nThe drinks are great. Specially the horchata.\n\nThe place is colorful and fun. It invites to stay and hang out. At least, we always do. \n\nThe staff is very friendly, always joking with us. We like them a lot too.\n\nOne thing I have an issue with is the restroom. It could use more cleaning. A lot more cleaning.\n\nThe only other thing is to watch out when you get your tamales specially if  you are a strict vegetarian. one time I ordered the Tofu tamal and they gave me a chicken one. Of course, they apologized and gave the chicken tamal free of charge to my mother.  On a different occasion, we ordered one chicken  and one tofu tamal to go and when we arrived home we noticed two tofu tamales. So they get wacky! Watch it! :)\n\nStill I love the place.", "author": "Stephany K."}

In Mexico, Oaxaca is famous for good fresh (quesillo) and dry (oaxacan) cheeses.  Both are good here.\n\n - Great *tortas*, including the mysteriously-rare egg torta (common in mexico, rare here) which is thankfully $3 cheaper than the meat ones, and weekly specials like venado (venison!!!!) and avestruz (ostrich) from local boutiquey sources. a tad pricey and small, but the quality justifies it hands down!\n\n - Tamales! Their masa (and their black mole, while we're at it) are much more suited to the Southern-style banana-leaf tamal Oaxaca is known for than the corn-husk ones: make sure to specify.\n\n - Rare forms of meat!!! Chicken tingas (pulled like ropa vieja and slow-stewed in slow-burning red-chili!), mole, pibil (southern/Mayan blood-orange/annatto-seed stew), and even some stuff I've never heard of (who knew you could make Tingas out of salmon? i'm afraid to order it, someone else will have to weigh in).\n\n - Classy beverages all around: not-too-sweet tamarindo, cans of pellegrino aranciata, achampurado, free ice water, etc etc\n\nGo!\n\n***Glossary:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlayuda\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapulines\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quesillo\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torta", "author": "throw a."}

Black Mole - no more questions asked.  Chicken enchiladas - but my hands down fave is the chicken tamales in plantain leaves &3.75 r u f*in kiddin me?  They are moister than a normal tamale, and they store fantastically, so we stock up and keep them in the frige, still perfect 3-4 days later.  Another fave is the chicken pibil fajitas (I've only had pork).  We go back at least once a week or so.", "author": "Enzo L."}

It was one of the best meals I have ever eaten anywhere, including in my travels in Europe, Central and South America, etc.  It was perfectly succulent and tasty and more than I could eat.  The guacamole came in two gigantic mole mortars, which were overflowing with mouth-watering fresh guacamole.  \n\nTo top it off, when the waiter (owner?) found out my husband didn't bring a birthday cake, he asked the cook to make us one on the spot.  After dinner out came a beautiful cake decorated with fresh papaya and mango and the most melt-in-your mouth creamy frosting I've ever tasted.

It's nothing you've ever had in your life! Don't be shy! It's an amazing combination! One plate of Mole Negro con Pollo is going to fill you up! Share it with a friend. Their tamale is the bomb too! HUGE! They make it in big flat servings. HUGE! Again, share it with a friend. The prices are awesome for what you're getting: authentic honest-to-Mayan-gods-so-good Oaxacan food! Their mole negro beats Colibri by the whole 9 yards. The tres leche was standard. Nothing to go whooza about. But their flan! GOODNESS GRACIOUS! Their flan is a thing of perfection! SOOOO GOOOD! And they have authentic Oaxacan cheese strips too! GO GO GO!", "author": "Pamela L."}

Some sauces can be a little spicy if you are sensitive, but if you can handle a tingly tongue, the rewards are great.  The spices are melded perfectly so that the heat is definitely not overpowering.", "author": "sweaterhead x."}

We were really impressed. We had the guacamole appetiser with chips to start out. It came with tortilla chips that were yellow, red and black. It was tasty and a large quantity. We got some pupusas and a chicken tamale in a banana leaf. To drink we had horchata and limonada. The tamale was terrific and the whole bill was a mere 19 dollars. We also had leftovers and another meal.", "author": "James K."}

I seriously was brought to memories of the best hot chocolate I've ever had in a Chocolate Bar - wow! Of course this isn't the sole reason to go here - cheap food with great service - I mean these guys smile all day. No joke - they don't rush you out or stare you down - they enjoy your company. I will definitely be back for some tacos and tamales, but this time around we had the tlayudas and the chicken mole. Chicken mole was fantastic - perfectly tasty smoky flavor and really nice stewed chicken falling off the bone. Rice and beans were of course delicious. Wish we had more spicy salsa at the table, but not a big deal. I unfortunately wasn't as big of a fan of the tlayudas as others - was something wrong with mine? The thing holding it all together tasted very stale? O_o I figured it needed to be somewhat to hold the yummy toppings - got the pastores and chicken with tequila (DELICIOUS!). In other words, I'll be getting that stuff in a taco next time. Oh they also have this interesting rice drink with cinnamon and chocolate - that was also fantastic, but given I was too full I chose the thinner liquid drink to take home, drink to my heart's content, and pass out on the couch.\n\nOverall a great experience and when I have them cravings for Mexican food, and not to forget their pastries and hot chocolate I'll be back.", "author": "Jeannette L."}

Very, very tasty food.  Still thinking about a few days later.  Went there on a saturday for a quick dinner.  There was a three guitar mariachi band playing to a handful of tables.  Everything was very casual and the food portions are large with very reasonable prices.  Highly recommend this place.", "author": "Sanjiv B."}

DON\"T even try parking in this neighborhood unless you have good parking karma (which I DO have), they have about a half dozen small tables, seating comfy for 2, crowded for 3. More than 3 of you, and you'll need two tables or take it to go. \n\nWhen we arrived we greeted by the very friendly staff. Not too crowded, grabbed a window seat and started to look over the menu.  After living in SF for a number of years and having tried many of the burrito joints in the Mission and many other Mexican restaurants we were pleasantly surprised at finding some items we had never seen or even heard of before. Tlayudas?  What's that?   Turns out to be a crispy tortilla like item, 12 or 14 inches across. We ordered the Sin Carne version. First it has beans over the whole thing, some Quesillo cheese from Oaxaca, lettuce, salsa, YUMMMMMMMM.  Think AUTHENTIC Mexican pizza.  The tamale pollo con mole was not only the BEST tamale ever eaten by my dinner partner who is a big tamale afficianado, but also some of the best mole I have ever had. I had a few Sopes, the Longanzina a type of sausage diced up with potato and onion reminded me of a hash and it was okay, but the Tinga de Pollo, pulled chicken in a mildly spicy sauce on top of shredded lettuce and frijoles refritos, topped with the Oaxacan cheese was TO DIE FOR.  \nThe Oaxacan version of the tamale in a corn husk, a Chicken Mole Negri de Oaxaca en hoja de Platano (in a banana leaf) was freakin' amazing, I coulda, shoulda had 2 or 3 of them to bring home with me....so when I wake up in the middle of the night after dreaming about La Oaxaqena I could just go to the fridge and eat some more. \nEbverything we tried (there was a pupusa for the 5 year old) and some carne asada tacos (yummmmm also) was top notch in quality and flavor, plated nicely also. Tres leches cake for dessert was above average for this item, but I am not a big dessert fan, would prefer to leave room for more Pollo MoleNegro!\n \nLa Oaxaquena is on my short list and should be on yours as well. Dinner for 2 1/2 with a dessert and extra entree so we could try more variety was $33", "author": "Gary G."}

So much so that I followed the advice of another yelper and ordered some of the plantain-wrapped tamales with mole to-go. I also brought home some of the pan dulce, but I was disappointed with that. The breads were pretty stale and a bit of a disappointment. They still get 4 stars on the balance of their unique tastes, affordable prices, and great service.", "author": "Vernon S."}

Definitely get the chicken with mole plate (house special!) and the whole fried fish was surprisingly juice. The accompanying rice and beans with quesillo (Oaxacan cheese) was flavorful and satisfying. Even better, grab some pastries, have a hot chocolate, coffee or champurrado with one of their pastries and watch the people walk by....", "author": "chris k."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-22", "description": "I went with 3 other friends for lunch, the place was packed, so we decided to try it.  No one greeted us as we walked in, nor did they acknowledge us as we stood by the cash register with menus.  One of the tables got up, so we sat down and waited.  Finally a server/owner came by and cleared the plates (from the previous group of people), but we had to ask for someone to wipe the table down.  As we were waiting at the table, we saw some guacamole and chips pass by - it looked great! When the server came to take our order, I asked for the guac and chips to start.  The server said they were all out.  I was a little confused since it was only 1pm in the afternoon.  He said the chef's didn't have time to make more and there was no more available.  Sadly, we just proceeded to order our lunch.  Two of my friends ordered super burritos, but because there was no guacamole, only a regular burrito came.  After 25 minutes, all of our food came out - 2 burritos, 3 sopes and 1 fajita order.  The steak from both the sopes and fajitas was rubber, the burritos were only warm and lacked cilantro and sour cream (which was specifically ordered), no one checked on us throughout the meal and we had to seek someone out for sauce, drinks and the check.   I only saw 2 servers and 2 chef's and maybe 9 tables in the place, so either they weren't prepared for the busy lunch hour or they didn't have their shift together, but all in all, it was quite a disappointment for us.", "author": "Nicole S."}
