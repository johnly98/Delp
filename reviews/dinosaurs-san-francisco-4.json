For me as a construction company owner that has no time for lunch most of the days it has been a lifesaving experience, my system with these guys is calling 10 minutes ahead and my sandwich is ready, the best items on menu are grilled pork sandwich and fresh rolls with shrimp with a fabulous peanut butter dipping sauce. Now I have to tell you that these sandwiches are super addictive, if you try it, be ready to welcome Dinosaurs into  your daily life, sandwiches are fresh, perfectly balanced and unique. Best that Dinosaurs has to offer is its people, always smiling, always welcoming you and always deliver what they promise.\n\nGet your munch on with these crafters of deliciousness, it's worth it!", "author": "Erast B."}

I only ate half of each (and took the other halves home), and shaking beef was still delicious when reheating.\n\nI also appreciated the pork and shrimp fresh spring rolls. Didn't expect the green apple to be in there, but I thought it paired well, adding a light, crisp, sweetness to the roll.\n\nThough the price is a bit more than what I usually pay for banh mi's and spring rolls, for a good meal in the city (with reasonable portions), I think it's worth it.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

I think the 1st time I was there I got it with an Avocado Shake which was light, creamy, refreshing, and slightly sweet. I think I would prefer it being a little sweeter, but this was nice too. Then the other times I've tried the Thai Iced Tea (which was good), and my last time I tried the Mango Mint Smoothie which was delish! I think so far my fave would be the Mango Mint Smoothie. \n\nThey have other sandwiches selections, but I just can't get myself to try other ones yet. They also have spring rolls as well if you're into that. \n\nPretty cute little sandwich place with a few seatings inside and outside. There's a small little vintage-y arcade game with lots of chip options. It's also pretty hidden with not a very obvious signage. It seems like they get break-ins often because of the wooden plank to cover where the windows were. That's not good that they have to keep on dealing with that. \n\nBut yes, I'm a fan of this place.

It is a casual setting, reminds me of a teriyaki joint. The environment is young with its young staff and top 50 music. \n\nService: The staff are super friendly. The guy who rang my friend up saw that we had split a sandwich and that I was using a napkin for the sandwich. Without asking me, he got me an extra tray. \n\nOrder: Crispy Tofu Sandwich ($7.15): They shred the tofu into small pieces and used vegan mayo, perfect for those who can't / don't want to eat meat.\n\nVerdict: The sandwich was flavorable, and I have nothing to complain about in terms of taste. However, coming from San Jose, this sandwich was extremely overpriced for what it was.

But no, the ladies there are Chinese/malay/thai/Indonesian/Burmese?  Not 100% sure but they were playing Chinese music (mandarin) and I ordered their special which was kare kare Filipino ox tail beef stew.  But they didn't look Filipino...I will have to ask next time.\n\nAnyway, their non-traditional banh mi's were quite delicious, especially the kare kare with added pate.  At my normal establishments, I would get extra pate and jalapenos, but first time at dinosaur, I wanted to see their norm.  The sandos could of used more jalapeno, but the pate was a pretty good sloppy amount, a bit more would be merrier for me and I wouldn't mind.  Kare kare was sweet and melty in your mouth.  The bread had a very nice slight crust with soft interior and over all easy bite apart texture.  Sometimes when banh mi is too hard by toasting too much or just sitting a bit too long, you take a bite and its hard so it pushes all the ingredients all over the place and falling out sometimes too.  But not these sandos.  \n\nOh the other was The Special; roast pork, fancy pork, pate.  The roast pork tasted like Chinese roast pork that you get at the hanging duck/chicken roast spots.  It was warm and good.  Could have used a bit more mayo and pate, as the roast pork was abundant but a bit dry.\n\nSpring rolls with grilled chicken and shrimp, it was nice, broke apart easy but tasty and fresh especially with a surprise of apples!  Choice of sauces was a new thing for me.\n\nOverall, one of my favorite non real deal banh mi sandos unlike a dac biet you get at any huong lan.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-14", "description": "Urban Legend says that when the owner was a kid, he liked to think of himself as a dinosaur because he had to open his mouth very wide to eat banh mi. Hence the original, semi-hipster name of Dinosaurs. (I used to think they were remotely affiliated with Andytown, which features plastic dinos and succulents as table art.)\n\nThe style is a little similar to Wooly Pig because they have traditional banh mi as well as some unique, more fusiony creations. (Maybe one day they will form a collaboration called Wooly Dinosaurs??!) Both feature excellent quality, a nice setting, and expensive-ish sandwich at $7-$8ish, which is pricier than your typical banh mi, but less than Ike's which is usually $9ish.\n\nSandwiches come on a crispy baguette roll, cilantro, jalapeno, mayo, and a mountain of pickled carrots and daikon. The star is the baguette--fresh, decently crunchy, and thick enough that it doesn't get soggy with all the sauces. \n\n(+++) The most classic is THE SPECIAL ($7.49, slow roasted pork, fancy pork loaf, and pork pate). I highly recommend especially if you like traditional banh mi, since it's the best deal for pate (it's the only sandwich that comes with it; for everything else it's an add-on).\n\n(++) Although I'm not usually particularly enthusiastic about vegan things, the CRISPY TOFU ($7.15, fried shreds of tofu, taro, rice noodles, and jicama with vegenaise) is surprisingly good, making a refreshing (and arguably healthier) alternative. All the ingredients complement each other very well, and the extra crisp makes it even more interesting.\n\n(+++) I was blown away by the SPICY TUNA ($7.15, chunk light tuna with spicy mayo). After having underwhelming experiences with tuna sandwiches being too mayo-y or too bland, Dinosaurs' version restored my faith. There was just enough mayo for a light creaminess, and the spicy kick reminded me of spicy tuna rolls.\n\n(++) One of their most popular is the SHAKING BEEF ($7.49, sliced beef sauteed with onions and vinaigrette) . It's indeed delicious, though not earth-shakingly so (pun intended). I find it a bit too salty and heavy, so I would recommend if you have a dinosaur's appetite. They once had a Filipino inspired version with peanut sauce and bok choy, which I can't comment much about since they ran out of peanut sauce and for some reason there was no bok choy.\n\n(+) For more simple options, there are the GRILLED CHICKEN ($7.49) and GRILLED PORK ($7.15). I do prefer the grilled chicken since I find the grilled pork a bit dry (the Special with the pate or adding avo helps with this). I couldn't really taste the lemongrass, but these are good choices if you don't want anything too gimmicky or saucy.\n\n(+) The $1.50 extra for AVOCADO is quite worth it, since they give you a hefty half avocado. It's an indulgent addition, but I would suggest it only for the grilled chicken or grilled pork, since everything else is flavorful and filling already.\n\nYes, I've tried nearly everything on the menu :3 Like a dinosaur in an apocalypse :V I passed on the SPRING ROLLS, partly because they actually cost more than the sandwiches, and partly because I'm already so happy with the sandwiches. I've always been curious about the MEATBALL (it's supposed to be sui mai style like the Chinese dim sum).\n\n(++) The VIETNAMESE ICED COFFEE ($3.75, dark roast coffee and chicory with sweetened condensed milk) is great as well, not as caffeinated as Wooly Pig but I love the earthy notes from the chicory.\n\nOne thing I will rant about is their propensity to mess up orders. I usually order one sandwich without cilantro and jalapeno (for the boo, who is anti-cilantro and anti-spicy) and one sandwich with everything (for myself, since I'm an omnomnomivore). Once they realized they messed it up and redid it so it was a longer wait. Another time, they mixed up the no cilantro/jalapeno on the sandwiches, and also gave me a grilled pork instead of a meatball. They also forgot my extra avocado once, and in my dismay over my lost $1.50, I asked at my next visit if they could give me my avo. The lady was very nice and allowed it, but I do wish they were better about keeping orders straight. It's usually not too busy, and the special requests are not particularly complicated. (Cheers to Starbucks baristas who can put up with far worse nit-pickiness)\n\nOther tips:\n*Street parking in the area isn't too impossible\n*You can call in your order ahead of time!\n*Portion size is just right--satisfying but not so filling that you feel like a glutton\n*They charge $0.10 for a paper bag. I suggest bringing your own, because once they didn't wrap the sandwich well. I was being thrifty and passed on the bag, and there were carrots and daikon all over my car.\n\nDinosaurs.

I love adding pate to my sandwiches, but I wish there was more as there were just small smears throughout the baguette. The roommate got the pork banh mi and thought the same thing. Too much mayo. The addition of the green apples to the spring rolls was weird in my opinion. It added a tartness the rolls didn't need.

First of all, this Dinosaurs location is on the 16th St. side of the little neighborhood shopping plaza. If you enter this miniature mall from Market St., go down the stairs, and head straight towards the 16th St. exit, and you'll find a small, simple sandwich shop. The menu includes the usual items you'd find at a Vietnamese banh mi shop, including spring rolls. A couple of the sandwiches stand out, like the shaking beef or the one with pork meatballs.\n\n$7.39 The Special - roast pork, pate, pickled carrots & daikon, cucumber, cilantro, jalapenos, mayo on French baguette:\nThe baguette was wonderfully crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was stuffed to the brim with roast pork, the kind that looks like it was cooked with a red glaze. The sliced vegetables were crunchy, but not quite juicy. I would have liked to taste more pate on the sandwich, too. \n\nAlthough, the banh mi comes at quite a premium rice, it is still considered an affordable sandwich. Plus, the neighborhood doesn't really compete in the banh mi department. It was also a tasty sandwich, but this wouldn't be my first choice for a banh mi.

Yes it's reasonable for the area - but there are plenty of places in SF where you can get a meal just as affordably priced.\n\nFood wise, I've had my share of banh mis, and I'd rank the bread they use here as one of the worst. Traditionally, banh mis come with a soft and crunchy baguette, and this was nowhere close. It was more Dutch crunch than baguette and just fell apart as you're eating it. \n\nTheir shaking beef sandwich I don't even know why is called shaking beef because it's prepared way different than how the shaking beef is usually done if you're familiar with Vietnamese cuisine. They also went way overboard with mayo which is a big no no.\n\nOverall a sloppy and disappointing banh mi for the price. Some say it's pricy because it's better quality but I don't believe that obviously. If they aren't making the effort to create a flawless banh mi from the bread to every other component, what makes you think they're making the same effort to carefully select only the best ingredients?

I had heard that Stef had tried it and enjoyed it so I thought I'd try this place. \n\nI decided to go with the grilled pork sandwich - was on the list and honestly, it looked like one of the best to me. The location is SMALL though - only a few tables so I couldn't actually sit there and eat.  A few minutes later, my sandwich was done. \n\nI got home and finally dug into the sandwich.  The sandwich was FILLED with the meat though. Not necessarily worth the $8 I paid since I can get a sandwich for like $5 in FiDi or even less in some places. \n\nProtip: Don't plan on eating there.

I've heard from several people that's been here that they have created a special fusion sandwich called Kare-Kare Banh Mi.  The idea got me quite excited since this dish has been completely overlooked/avoided by many as it takes forever and intimidating to prepare, some would think peanut butter and beef mixed together is just completely gross to the foreign tongue, etc.\n\nKare-Kare is a famous slow-cooked Filipino oxtail stew complemented with vegetables that is prepared with thick savory peanut sauce.  (Note: There are not a lot of people that know how to properly make good/authentic Kare-Kare.  Try to delete in your mind beef that is just dipped in peanut butter--this is definitely NOT an accurate description of what the dish is per se.)  Unfortunately, Dinosaur's attempt to create a fusion sandwich completely misses to have the very basic taste of what Kare-Kare tastes like.  Their version somewhat tasted like liverwurst pat\u00e9 mixed with peanut sauce accompanied with your pickled vegetables, cilantro, mayo, pat\u00e9 and french baguette bread.  We also tried their Special Banh Mi and again, it's nothing amazing.  It lacks in taste and again the texture (there was WAY more liverwurst pat\u00e9 and very minimal serving of very thin slices of meat) is not like what I have eaten before from other Banh Mi spots.  The fresh rolls are okay but their peanut sauce could be improved as it tastes more like melted peanut butter with peanut bits.\n\nI am still debating whether to give this spot another chance to check out the other selections in their menu.  Many have raved about their avocado or mango smoothies but I did not get to try it.  Again, the place is decent; it's not horrible but maybe it's better to stick with solely the basic Vietnamese Banh Mi's and perfect that before trying to create fusion dishes.", "author": "Heidi S."}

The Special (roasted pork, fancy pork loaf and pork pate, $7.39) is as close as you can get to the traditional \"banh mi thit nguoi\" (my personal favorite), but it simply does not cut it for me in terms of taste. It's a good sandwich, but if you're looking for authenticity, you're better off looking elsewhere. \n\nThat avocado smoothie, on the other hand...is the best damn smoothie I have ever tasted outside of my home! Most places tend to make it too thick, too sweet, and/or too watery. Dinosaur's avocado shake (fresh avocado, vanilla rice milk and pure cane sugar, $4.50) is the most balanced and freshest avocado shake I've bought, ever! Rice milk is definitely a better ingredient to use in those kind of shakes than regular or even condensed milk, and going organic with the cane sugar was the best thing to do. \n\nSeriously, if I ever make the trek to that place again, it will only be for that damn good avocado smoothie.", "author": "Viet N."}

Let me just say that i'm usually someone that is not too keen on paying more than $3 for a banh mi. So when I saw that the \"special\" was close to $8, I had a mini heart attack. BUT i'll give it you. Their banh mis are bomb. The bread was perfectly toasty on the outside and soft on the inside. They did not skimp on the fillings, literally the pickled veggies and meats were overflowing. The flavors all melded well together, and my tastebuds were thoroughly satisfied.\n\nSurprisingly their tofu/taro spring rolls are pretty good too. Nice crunchy texture and very fresh. OH make sure you get their peanut sauce..seriously bomb.\n\nLike i said previously, i'm skeptical of good ethnic foods being jacked up in price but being mediocre in taste.

Also, the \"Shaking Beef\" is very delectable, all of the flavors pair really well together and the beef that is used is always juicy and tender. So, what are you waiting for? Go now and get yourself one of these sandwiches, but make sure that you grab an ice cold beer from their cooler, they have a great variety for cheap and they all pair well with any food item :)", "author": "Joseph A."}

There's not even an explanation. You'd think this is some hip, new, fusion bullshit, but that's not it at all. They keep it simple and tasty. Looking at the menu, you'd probably think this was a pricey Vietnamese sandwich. But considering all other lunch and dinner options, a $5 sandwich is a great deal. And these sandwiches are loaded quite nicely.\n\nThe special is what you'd expect, roasted pork, pate, cha lua, do chua, cilantro, and jalepeno in a crunchy french roll. They also have grilled chicken, pork, beef, and have you. On top of that, they have tofu and mushroom options as well. Same goes for the spring rolls. They have the more traditional shredded pork and shrimp, and chicken and shrimp. Then there's the veggie-friendly option, taro and tofu. I'm also a fan of their salads: shrimp papaya and chicken cabbage. They're a tad on the small side, but a nice refreshing alternative.

Until their prices drastically increased I slowly stopped coming here. Now for an $8 banh mi, it's way too pricey. Therefore I'm giving 1 star for price increase but 4 stars for the sandwich. Reason being, I love the fact that they are very generous with the meat and veggies. It always feels like a heavy log each time I pick up my order. I always get \"the Special\". It's loaded with pork and pate. My favorite out of all. Bread can be very hard so it hurts my jaws trying to bite into it. Their Vietnamese coffee doesn't taste like it's freshly brewed.

It's like you're eating Vietnam and SF, together! Let me break it down. The bread...is so good! It's not the traditional baguette, so it's different in that sense. The ingredients taste fresh, the daikon/carrots (do chua) are well pickled and meats well seasoned. \n\nMy recommendation is the \"Birds Nest\" (The Meatball + The Crispy Tofu). Secret menu item? Maybe? I was exposed to this from my old roommate and ever since then, always get it. I enjoy it because of the flavor textures between the two. They work alone, but together, and add a bit of sriracha for kick...flavor explosion! \n\nSome may say it's a bit pricey for banh mi, but hey, it's San Francisco, what do you expect?

Fortunately it was not very busy when I went so I was able to get a seat easily. The menu is basic they have bahn mi sandwiches, spring roll appetizers, and some drinks.\n\nThe bahn mi is very good and very inexpensive. For about $7.00 you can get a sandwich loaded with meat, picked carrot, pickled daikon, cucumber, and jalape\u00f1os. I had the special \"kare kare bahn mi\" which features Filipino style beef and a creamy peanut fish sauce and it was DELICIOUS! The bread was crunchy, the sauce was creamy, the jalape\u00f1os spicy, and the pickled carrots & daikon slightly acidic. This was one of the best bahn mi sandwiches I've had in the city and it only cost $7.49.

But I would expect the place to be more playful than it is - maybe a life-size Godzilla action figure that waves hello or at least a poster for \"Land of the Lost\", not the Will Ferrell version of course. No, it's just a nondescript space on the back-end of that mini-mall complex no one really knows is there except when I stop by Books Inc, or when maybe you go to that tiny sushi place I also forget is there inside. Dinosaurs is not really on Market either.\n\nIt flanks the 16th Street entrance to the mall, which I'm sure is the reason I never noticed it before. Six banh mi sandwiches are offered, as well as a few pre-packaged things like salad and spring rolls. Since this was my maiden voyage into prehistoric times, I thought I should give the sandwiches a try first. Like probably everyone else, I ordered the $5 Special, which has slices of roasted pork and \"fancy pork loaf\" and a smear of pate in between a crispy-crusted French roll with plenty of cilantro, shreds of pickled carrots and daikon, slices of chili peppers, and spears of cucumber (see photo).\n\nIn other words, it was prepared with nice authenticity and tasted quite delicious. I spared myself half the roll simply to avoid the carbs, but I couldn't help but also order the $4.75 Crispy Tofu as a chaser. In between the same type of French roll with the same toppings were fried tofu shards that reminded me of the French-fried onions you used to get in the cardboard cans, as well as rice noodles and a tofu-based mayo that was vegan-friendly (they call it \"vegenaise\") (see photo). This turned out to be quite good, too, though I have to say the oil content on the tofu was a bit overwhelming.\n\nGood thing I followed the tip of a fellow Yelper and ordered extra cucumbers to moisten the sandwich with a bit more fresh crunch. So here's the deal - they're about twice the price of the sandwiches at Saigon Sandwich on Larkin in Little Saigon where everyone is willing to wait in line and ignore the aggressive vagrants on the sidewalk. And honestly, those gems are the best deal in town because they are done right. On the other end of the spectrum are the more designer banh mi creations at Bun Mee (sic) on Fillmore where you end up paying $6.50 for their special combo. Dinosaurs falls right in the middle which is fine by me.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...authentic banh mis well turned and pretty satisfying\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...generic space in a mall with a few tables\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...very quiet and preparation is hidden from view\nTOTAL - 4 stars...nice ingredients and a fair price point make this outlier a worthwhile place to grab and go", "author": "Ed U."}

The roasted pork was dry and had no flavor except salty, the special loaf pork (cha in Vietnamese) was average but was sliced very thinly, and the pork p\u00e2t\u00e9 (spreadable ground meat) was good. I like my vietnamese sandwiches flavorful which usually means well cooked juicy meat with pickled daicons. Unfortunately the meat was just there and dry and I could barely tell the veggies were pickled. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because I think my expectations are too high. If you've never had a real Vietnamese sandwich, this place might be fine for you. But if you have, then this place is way overpriced for just a sandwich since Viet sandwiches are usually $4-5 for a good one.", "author": "Tiffany G."}

Without being hyperbolic, this place is home to the best sandwiches, Vietnamese or not, I have ever had in my life. The baguettes strike the perfect balance between a certain exuding soft freshness and crackling crispness along the outside layer, holding together the deliciousness of the ingredients within. \n\nThese are people who understand how each component of a sandwich complements the other, from the way the picked carrots balance out the light flavor of cucumbers, to the seasoned mayonnaise soaking into all the in-betweens, everything comes together with a delightfully fresh and tangy elegance.  \n\nThe sandwiches are consistently great, too. I've been coming here for awhile now and have yet to be disappointed. Their menu serves up traditional affair for what can go into a Vietnamese sandwich, along with some non-traditional stuff. I'm particularly partial to the mushroom sandwich, but you really can't go wrong here. Everything asides the sandwiches themselves (i.e., fresh spring rolls) are admittedly not as good, but I'll forgive them for it since that's not the focus here.\n\nOverall, a great sandwich shop that provides a delicious, innovative spin on an ethnic classic.

What a great find! I love Vietnamese sammies! And when I perused through the yelp photos, I found one of a toy from that old show Dinosaurs from the '90s! That was from my childhood, the one that was live action and it was about a family of dinosaurs. Nostalgic. Then I found another photo and it was of a little Domo wearing a dinosaur/godzilla costume and that sealed it. I was going to come to Dinosaurs for a banh mi sandwich. \n\nIt was actually a little hard for me to find - once you find the address, you'll have to go down the stairs and keep walking towards the back to find it. It's a small place with just a few tables on the inside, and some seating outside. There are a couple of sandwiches on the menu, including vegan options. They also have salads and spring rolls. \n\nI ordered The Special sandwich: roasted pork + pork loaf + pork pate. You can also add on extras to your sandwich. I was curious about the crispy tofu, so I added that on to my banh mi. I also ordered a Thai iced tea. The sammie was delicious. The bread was fresh and lightly toasted and the pickled veggies were so yummy. They packed in a good amount of meat and veggies and of course the jalapenos added that extra kick that I love. The fillings were spilling out as I was munching on my sammie. The crispy tofu was like fried pieces of shredded tofu - not sure if that's exactly what they were, but they weren't like slice of patties of tofu that were fried like I originally imagined. They were good and added a nice texture to the sandwich. Oooh, and the Thai iced tea was good too - went well with my sammie.  And I liked that they offered vegan options - my friends really liked the portobello banh mi and the crispy tofu banh mi. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in the Castro to try the grilled pork banh mi!", "author": "Sylvia K."}

Ever since I moved from NY (and away from Banh Mi Saigon in Chinatown) I have been on the search for a delicious substitute.  This quest has led me to Out the Door, Bun Mee, and now to Dinosaurs.  Here's the overview:\n\nRestaurant:  Small, divey, holl-in-the-wall.  I dig it.  4/5.  Nothing special, but I don't want anything special.  (Banh Mi Saigon is in the back of jewelry store).  Clean enough.  \n\nService:  Friendly, fast, offered suggestions.  Above average.  4/5.\n\nFood:  \nSpicy Tuna:  I guess I should have read the menu more closely.  In my mind I was thinking sushi style spicy tuna.  Not Tuna Salad Sandwich style.  I haven't eaten tuna like this since I was in college.  2/5\nThe Special:  The positives:  Bread is perfect for a Banh Mi.  Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  The pickled vegi's and cilantro was good.  The pork pate was okay.  Overall this was an average tasting sandwich.  3/5.  \nPork and Shrimp Spring Rolls:  4/5.  The best part of this was the peanut sauce.  \n\nOverall this place is a 3.5/5 for me.

When you do get there, it's really small - a few seats on the inside and a few tables on the street. Luckily, we were able to snag a table on the street since it was a nice day. I got The Special  which is 2 kinds of pork, pate, daikon, cucumbers, jalapenos, and mayo on a baguette roll. Considering how big and full it looked, I was really excited, but when I took a bite, I thought it was just ok. Since there wasn't much sauce (except for the mayo), it didn't have much flavor. The pork didn't have much flavor, but the veggies on top were pretty good. The bread was ok. I would have loved it if it was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, but it was just a normal roll. \n\nOverall, it's smaller than it looks. You can eat it all! I did it!

This led me on a mad search on Yelp for a banh mi place (other than Lee's) that doesn't close at 4 or 5 pm. Then comes Dinosaurs, 4 Stars on Yelp and closes at 10 PM! SCORE?\n\nMENU\n*BANH MI ($4.75): The Special (like a Combo), The Pork, The Chicken, The Meatball, The Spicy Tuna and The Crispy Tofu\n*STEAMED BUNS ($3): Pork and Chicken\n*SPRING ROLLS ($4.50): Pork w/ Shrimp, Chicken w/ Shrimp and Tofu\n\nThey also have a variety of snacks (chips and hi-chews) and drinks. CC's accepted. \n\nI couldn't decide between two sandwiches so I decided to get both, eat half from each and save the rest for later. At $4.75 each, there are about $1-$1.75 more than your banh mi in TL, but you have to remind yourself they have no competition in the Castro and rent is much higher.\n\nGiven the good reviews and the super friendly young man that works there, I really wanted to like Dinosaurs and was hoping to give nothing less than 4 stars; that's until I tasted the sandwiches...\n\nMY ORDER\nThe key to a solid banh mi is the bread. Dinosaurs uses a hearty French baguette that was perfectly crunchy with a chewy bite. However, the fillings and lack of authentic flavors (i.e. savory, salty, tangy and spicy) are where they lost major points with me.\n\n*CRISPY TOFU - Fried Tofu, Rice Noodles, Taro & Veganaise - 2 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yC5ATYRQah7MjeTiRsGcvA?select=QGLzxXzvamQ9Smcl15thMA\nAs recommended by Yelpers, this was rather a disappointing banh mi. The combination of fried tofu and taro strips and fried noodles made for an extremely dry, yet oily sandwich. The pickled carrots and daikon were sliced too thinly causing it to dry out. It also lacked acidity which didn't help cut through the richness. In short, the banh mi tasted like fried onion strings between two slabs of bread.\n\n*THE SPECIAL - Roasted Pork, Fancy Pork Loaf & Pate - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yC5ATYRQah7MjeTiRsGcvA?select=yKHsH3VjPl2L7sh7DtffIA\nInside The Special were roast pork and cha la (steamed pork) and a gentle smearing of pate; sans the headcheese which is normally in an authentic banh mi. The meat was sliced unusually thin as opposed to thicker slices. Again, I found this banh mi to be dry although not as dry as the crisp tofu one because of the pate. It was missing most of the essential flavor profiles I'm use to: tender, savory porkyness (roast pork was dry and bland), creaminess from the mayo (was used very sparingly), saltiness from the soy sauce (didn't detect any) and tanginess from the pickled carrots and daikon (was dried out).\n\nIt's a shame I can't RAWR over Dinosaurs. I guess it's back to the land of crackheads and pee infested sidewalks to get my Banh Mi \"Fix\".", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The temporary \"3 for 2\" offer (normally priced $4.50-$4.75 each, w/offer it's about $3 each) on Mon-Thu 4-7pm, is worthwhile. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Eaz95-XvgFHONk5GVvleyQ/l\n\nUpdate: ALL sandwiches are now $4.75 each.\n \nI still think that Saigon sandos and Y&Y Deli are the best in the city. But this is a good runner up, and the only banh mi shop in this area. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QhisfjBwBKxdSycfXyLtBQ/l The filling has the right balance between meat amount and pickled veggies. And sometimes they use long baguettes, instead of rolls. \n\nThe short menu includes 6 sandwiches: The pork, http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Go8pDygJ10R_Qhl5yynQHw/l meatball, http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FpEXMMuBbskFDqaTcjh4Ug/l and chicken sandwiches http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g_xNv09HQib1rzZhs6YTpw/l are typical good banh mi. But don't overlook the tuna, it's delicious. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9CbEIeSQh-lizXFHnWOsFA/l The special (aka. dac biet) has a generous amount of ham and cha lua, better than other shops. http://media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vmHF6GQCPD4xX-KumGiQzg/l And the crispy tofu is very unique, thin strands of taro, noodles and tofu are fried to resemble overcooked shredded meat (the first vegan SF banh mi I've ever seen). http://media2.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RP2nzIkCJh265gIpZ8aE9Q/l\n\nThe shop is somewhat hidden, so the 16th street entrance http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jpqWpOQs6cVnGskbUC1iGA/l doesn't have much foot traffic.

The staff was very nice and greeted my friend and I. We ordered the grilled pork and that sandwich was above average and I want more! The pork was very flavorful and the sandwich itself had the perfect balance of pickled veggies and mayo. What I particularly loved was the bread!

I just noticed a fat-ass long line that reached well past and beyond the auto body and detailing shop. \n\nAt the end of the long line and like five buildings away from Ike's is a brand new and little but cute Vietnamese deli.  Believe it or not, the line for tiny Ike's reached that far. This is the only Vietnamese Deli in the Castro and indeed a welcoming addition. For now, this little deli serves six kinds of Banh Mi sandwiches. \n\nI had one of the deli's six sandwiches; the Grilled Chicken Sandwich. For $4.50 (it appears to be the average price everywhere now), I get a slice of freshly cooked Grilled Chicken, julienned-slices carrots, daikon, cilantro and a couple slices of jalapeno in a warm crunchy roll. This tasty sandwich has all the fresh key-ingredients and a huge improvement from the last time I had a Banh Mi from Irving Street Deli. \n\nI also had a cool and refreshing Vita Chrysanthemum box drink for $1.00 with my sandwich. I like the fact that this is one of the very few places in the area that carries the Asian beverage. In my book, the Asian drink and Banh Mi is a great pair. This place also has Pepsi products as well.\n\nI've also noticed many people were buying the Steamed Pork Bun. Another item I'll check out, which will be undoubtedly very soon. I hope the deli will have more items when I return. \n\nI used my Mastercard for my lunch. The young and energetic girl, made my sandwich, was very nice with a sunshine smile. \n\nIf you have an empty stomach and have zero patient to wait in the long line for a sandwich from Ike's, this place makes a really good Banh Mi too.

They are large enough to sometime only eat half. \n\nGood bread. A lot of I believe lightly pickled carrots, cucumber, cilantro. Feels a pretty healthy option for what is available in the area on the quick (pizza, burger ...pizza, burrito, pizza burger...)\n\nNice spring rolls and stuff pre-rolled and ready to grab then go.\n\nVery high quality. CONSISTENT quality. Thats hard to do and they do it here seemingly easy. \n\nThis is probably where I would take someone unfamiliar with banh to try it out. The others might even be too bold for some. But personally I like getting kicked in the mouth with flavor the same way I was while in vietnam which none of these truly replicate (could someone PLZ put a fried egg on my banh already???)\n\n\nSo this is a great sandwich place! Come here and order an iced coffee and pork with pate. The coffees are large and not overly sweet. Not as heavy thick as some but a coffee that pleases me. \n\nI wish they had pho (hint hint) as there is a lack of offerings in the area that are affordable(I'm not paying 12$ at Slurp when at Turtle Towers its 7$ and the best) .\n\nI wish this place great success and hope they expand.

As far as the sandwiches they are OK, however the bread could be better.  The bread they use is on the hard side and I prefer a softer roll.  Si I stopped ordering the sandwiches and now when I go I just get the spring rolls.  The spring rolls are very good when they are on, but when they are off, the rice wrapper hardens and it feels like you are biting into plastic shrink wrap...and I don't like that.  A friend told me a trick to solve the spring roll problem.  Drop a few droplets of water onto the spring roll and put a paper towel over it and microwave it for 15 seconds or so.  This will re-moisten your spring roll and hopefully solve the problem.  However, when I place my order to eat in their restaurant, I don't have access to a microwave.  They have also raised their prices recently, but that seems to be a trend in this neighborhood.\n\nI do really like their outdoor seating option and is a nice way to catch some SF sun rays while on my lunch break.

Enough. Good. Things. About. These. Things.\n\nTheir tofu banh mi is pretty damn good, too. They are much better than Bun Mee's (which are waywayWAY too greasy). \n\nThe only negative is a minor one: the place is very hot inside, the seats are torn up and tables not always too clean. They could probably use another person cleaning up. But the place is seriously reasonable ($6-7 for three, meal-sized rolls, $5-6 for a banh mi) so they can be forgiven for cutting corners with the ambiance.", "author": "Jason M."}

Like many reviewers have mentioned, Little Saigon's tofu sandwich is NOT vegan. Dinosaurs vegan sandwich most certainly is, and it is good. I like to pair it up with the jalapeno kettle chips and coconut water. Soon I hope to be pairing it up with a coca-cola, as they have a brand new fountain machine.

Amidst the endless choices at these restaurants, the banh mi gets forgotten, relegated to the shadows of pho or bo luc lac. And it ultimately just isn't that good.\n\nThis is happily not the case at Dinosaurs. Here, they've gone with the tactic that simple is good, and they crank out delicious banh mi and refreshments with unbelievable focus. It's refreshing to see a small menu where everything is guaranteed to be delicious and fresh, and where every ingredient has received some thought.\n\nThe drinks are refreshing, and not overly sweet. If you like honeydew, I highly recommend the honeydew smoothie. Otherwise, the watermelon one is pretty good. \n\nThe spring rolls and chicken salad were also quite good, and tasted fresh. They do not skimp on the meat, and its nice that one order of spring rolls includes 3 of them, all with a good balance of meat, herbs (basil, i think?), and noodles. The dressing for the chicken salad was tangy and sweet, and went well with the cilantro and carrot.\n\nFinally, the sandwiches are very good. The bread is crispy, but soft, and the toppings are fresh. I enjoy the special, which has some pork and pate. The meat is good and they don't skimp on it, but its also not overwhelming, and strikes a nice balance with the toppings (and a little sriracha!). I have friends who don't eat pork, and some that don't eat meat at all, and they've told me that the chicken and tofu sandwiches are also delicious. \n\nFor a few bucks, you get a good amount of fresh food, and you can sit outside on a nice day! its definitely worth trying!", "author": "Zameer A."}

I know Dinosaurs is in a weird location for banh mi and most of the reviews talk about the \nspecial or tolu banh mi but in my mind it's the meatball that makes it worth eating at. The special is not as good as many other places (not enough pate) but the meatball, oh the meatballs! Warm, soft and tasty. Great stuffed inside a good french roll (soft bread and crunchy crust) with the pickled veg. I only wish there was more as my taste buds were craving it for a long time after I finished. Hubby and I agreed the meatball was the way to go.

They introduced a frequent buyer card (buy 9 get one free).\n\nThe banh mi prices ($4.25 - $4.75) are about $1.50 - $2 higher than usual but it's understandable given the location.  Plus they have some unusual options for substitutions - whole wheat baguette and vegenaise.  They also sell Asian snacks and drinks (yes, soy milk - the perfect drink to have with banh mi). I've also seen spring rolls and steamed buns there.\n\nThere are 6 kinds of banh mi: The Special, The Pork, The Chicken, The Cold Cut, The Meatball, The Crispy Tofu.  \n\n* The Special banh mi ($4.75): with roast pork, fancy pork loaf, pate, pickled carrots & daikon, cilantro, cucumber spear, jalapeno, soy sauce & mayo.  The sandwich was average to slightly smaller in size.  My first impression was that the flavors and textures were very good (chewy, crunchy, spicy, tangy).  The toasted bread was excellent - nice and chewy without being too hard.  The pate was great too.  Because the bread and pate were so good I didn't notice the flavorless, underseasoned meat right away. \n* Meatball sandwich - nice pickled, peppery carrots and daikon, the meatballs are soft but hold together, the meatball had more flavor than pork cuts though still on the underseasoned side\n* Giant steamed bun: I liked the peppery ground meat but the exterior bun was a bit soggy.  It didn't have Chinese sausage but it did have a hard-boiled egg, peas, onions, scallion, and silver noodles.  \n\nThe main weaknesses were (1) carrots and daikon too finely shredded so  they weren't crunchy enough though they seemed crunchier during my second visit, (2) meat sliced too thinly and (3) neither the roast pork or the fancy pork had much flavor.", "author": "Lolia S."}

Just enough cilantro and carrot, a decent amount of meat, and a nice fresh baguette. Really good.

Don't have buyer's remorse like I did, get two. Or bring a friend and split the extra sandwich.  \n\nWhen we went, they had a special where you get 10% off if you check-in on FB or Yelp.

Given it's in Castro or Mission Dolores area, it's hard to find a good and affordable banh mi sandwich that doesn't cost you more than $5. On top of that, the place is warm and welcoming, ingredients are fresh, and the pickles are perfectly preserved, I think it's time to finally give my first 5 star review. But after going there yesterday, I have changed my mind and actually subtract that 1.5 stars..\n\nIt's fine that they want to just specialize what they are good at and stick with just 5 or 6 sandwiches. But a spicy tuna banh mi?? Umm I don't think so. That's the -0.5 star for adding this weird sandwich. On top of that, they changed the way they make the spicy pork sandwich, my favorite! Now why would you do that? The pork they now use is this weird cured pork. It's almost like a salami and not the real grilled pork that they used to have.

The flavors are balanced and all meld together for one tasty sandwich, made even better by the...drumroll please...\n\nAVOCADO SHAKE! People! This should be mandatory with your sandwich order! It's just avocado blended with vanilla, rice milk and a little bit of sugar and put simply, it's kickass.

I turned to Yelp to help me find.  Came across this place and read that many people quite frankly enjoy this joint.  Since I was in the hood and it was close to Ike's while the hubby was waiting on his sandwich, I went for the go! \n\nPlace is tiny with maybe three small tables indoors and three small tables outdoors, kind of a cramped place.    You see a lot of people placing orders and grabbing it to go.  Friendly staff, and total fobby Vietnamese women working in the back making your sandwiches and drinks.  It seems the only people with perfect English are the guys that take your order at the front.  When I got there I ordered my sandwich, iced coffee and spring rolls in Vietnamese which took the guy by surprise cause he said he's so NOT used to people ordering in Vietnamese.  Reason being is that I think this place attracts more Caucasians than they do Asians.  Not a problem with that at all so long as the food is good.  \n\nI ordered the Special sandwich with no pate or mayo...not a big fan of either.  Meats were tender, bread was warm and crunchy, not your usual French baquette when you order a Banh Mi at any other Vietnamese Sandwich place, pickled carrots and daikon were seasoned just right with a hint of black pepper on top, jalapenos had the right amount of kick, but I did without them since they were too much of a kick for me.  I also ordered the Goi Cuon (Shrimp and Pork spring rolls) as listed on their menu.  These were huge, comes in 3 pieces with the Hoisin peanut butter dipping sauce...add some sriracha sauce to it and the sauce will taste even better.  I also ordered the Cafe Sua Da (Vietnamese Iced Coffee) a lil on the stronger side for me, but still tasty.  I came again the next day since we were in the area for Bay to Breakers and got the same thing without the iced coffee, but this time, got the chicken salad, it was OK, nothing special.  \n\nFood was legit, prices are a bit on the high side especially compared to what I'm used to.  I can go to Chinatown in Oakland and get 4 Vietnamese sandwiches for $8.25 (buy 3 get 1 free) whereas here, the sandwiches are $5 and above.  The only downfall about this place would be the price considering I know I can get these things for much cheaper and space.  Quality of food is good, people are friendly, and a nice location.  They don't have a large variety of sandwiches as you would see in a normal banh mi place that has a large selection such as fried fish cake (yum), grilled chicken, dac biet (which is a combination of everything), etc...but it will do.  Would love to come back and try their other sandwiches.  You know what the place is also missing, tapioca drinks of all sorts...now that would make this place bomb!!!  Just a suggestion! \n\nAs for the name, Dinosaurs...I have no clue where or how this came about...but I'm sure it must mean something to them.  So again, not your typical Vietnamese sandwich place which are normally called BC Deli, Banh Mi Ba Le, or something else of that nature.

It SAYS 2275 Market, and that's technically true, but what you will see from Market Street is a sort of stairwell, a couple of shops and a sign for a sushi place. What you have to do is head down the stairwell, and head towards the back. \n\nOnce you have located Dinosaurs, prepare for tasty goodness. The rolls are nice and crispy, a good texture contrast with the pork and pate. The sandwich is just the right amount of spicy--and for me, priced pretty decently. My husband and I both had a sandwich and a drink each for just over 10 bucks. My husband who had never had banh mi before found it pretty tasty and said we'd have to come back.

I am not accustomed to paying more than $3 for a good banh mi sandwich... \n\nRed light #2: This is a Chinese owned and operated Vietnamese sandwich shop...??\n\nRed light #3: No more bread?! It was about 2pm Saturday, and they had somehow ran out of bread and were waiting to be restocked...\n\nSkeptical of the operations going on here and the high prices... I ended up going for it anyway - to see if it was worth any of the current Yelp hype, and more so just to appease my BF's persistence in me trying his new great find, in combination with my previous 3-4 underwhelming visits with Ike's down the street... \n\nWe ended up sharing the last of the bread Dinosaur still had, and doing half spicy tuna and half grilled pork. I've never had or seen spicy tuna in banh mi, but the girl behind the counter recommended we go for it, and so we did. Out came two tiny little baguette ends that would make you feel like a giant dinosaur in comparison... hmmm, I guess the name \"Dinosaur\" didn't come from nowhere??? Expecting only dissappointment at this point, the grilled pork was actually not too bad and the spicy tuna was actually down out delicious. Served with fresh pickled daikon, jalapenos, and cilantro... these provided fresh takes on my once narrow view of a good banh mi. \n\nDespite Dinosaur's banh mi being a good $5 a piece and being TINIER than any sandwich/banh mi I've ever eaten - though possibly due to it being their last bits of bread, I find myself craving their (spicy tuna) banh mi more than any other sandwich I've ever had... I know, the blasphemy!!~ But really, Dinosaur may be on to something here... so if you're getting tired of Ike's, or even if you're not... come give this place a try! Dinosaur may not compare to the epic-sounding world of Ike's sandwiches - with their menu of hundred different calorie-bombing sandwich combos that range from $10-20, but Dinosaur does go beyond Ike's when it comes to overall taste, imo... and is still a great meal find for under $10!

I echo Shannon B in ordering the extra veggies to create the perfect sandwich, but you're good without... and invariably the team will throw in extra veggies at no charge if you ask politely.  The speed is phenomenal - I often wait 10-15 minutes downtown for my sandwich, but these guys turn orders around in less than five minutes.  Plus all staff members are super polite and friendly.\n\nDon't get me wrong - the sound of the pinball machine inside can drive me insane when trying to chat, but the quality of the food and the reasonable price point drown that out - besides, you can sit on the sidewalk, so all is good.

At $4.75, the sandwiches are a deal as it is, and I would definitely say it's a 5 bucks well spent. \n\nFirst off, yay for Dinosaurs cause they have crusty toasted bread that doesn't cut the top of your mouth when you're eating it - it's just the right ratio of soft to crisp! The sandwiches are warm and fully packed with goodness. I got the special and the pork. The special has roasted pork, fancy pork, and a pate spread (so yum) along with all the pickled veggies and jalapenos. Sweet, salty, tangy in every bite. The pork is grilled and lemongrass seasoned, just as good as the special! Each sandwich is served warm and though it may look petite and you may question if you'll be hungry after but it packs a punch and you'll be satisfied after your last bite.\n\nService was slow when I stopped by. Though there isn't a line, there is a constant flow of people coming in and ordering, and with only one person working the cashier and assembling sandwiches you can imagine that everything takes a while to happen. There are 4 tables inside though, and spring rolls you can get instantly - it did slightly bother me that the shrimp spring rolls were sitting outside of a coldbox during a hot day.\n\nOverall, Dinosaurs was great place to get a banh mi without having to brave walking through the Tenderloin.

I am constantly craving the food of my peope so I had to check it out immediately.  I went by for lunch last week.  The shop was empty and I had to double check that it was, in fact, the Dinosaur I was looking for (heh).  \n\nLike any respectable bahn mi shop, the menu is limited to 5 or 6 sandwiches, all of which were fairly recognizable combinations to me.  I ordered the pork special, which had roasted pork, pork pate, and pork terrine (gio).  They also had a nice selection of canned drinks that would be recognizable to anyone familiar with Vietnamese food (soy milk, grass jelly, chrysanthemem tea, etc.). \n\nI was going to get the sandwich to go but I felt bad seeing all the empty seats so I got it for here and plopped down in a chair by the window.  A few minutes later my sandwich came out.\n\nIt was fantastic.  First off, it was STUFFED to the brim with pork.  My mother would probably chastise them for using enough meat for four sandwiches in one.  But believe me, I wasn't complaining. The pork was flavorful and moist, the pate was tasty but not overwhelming (I actually usually ask bahn mi shops to hold the pate, but this was great), and the gio was a nice touch.  The pickled carrots and daikon were fresh and crunchy.  I usually like my pickles more tart but I think these were great for an American palate.  Add some mayo and jalapenos and a nicely toasted and crunchy roll, and it really was a fantastic sandwich.  I much prefer it to the bahn mi from Castro Tarts.\n\nI liked that the place was quiet (with some nice hipster music playing).  It was a pleasant refuge from the craziness of the Castro on a nice summer day.  And at $4.75, it's a deal that can't be beat.  I'll be back for sure.\n\nSo seriously, all you hipsters standing in line for 45 minutes waiting to shell out $11 for a sandwich the size of your head at Ike's*: Give Dinosaurs a try.  There really is enough room on that block for two awesome sandwich shops.\n\n* No knock. Believe me, I'm one of you.  Just a more impatient version.", "author": "Courtney N."}

Decent but not cheap like tenderloin's vietnamese sandwiches. Tofu is interesting pork is good, chicken is ok, meatball is boo boo. Service is friendly!\n\n\n-----\n\nI'd like to say I've been a fan of Bahn Mi's for quite sometime. I also respect the different types kind and variations in Bahn Mi's. I went to Dinosaurs to get a Scoutmob coupon (50% bill max $10, but actually turned out to be only $5) which turned out to be wrong (per the owner). \n\nThe lady at the counter was nice, and the owner was friendly, despite the misunderstanding on the Scoutmob deal.\n\nWhat I ordered and what I found out:\n\nTofu: Neat, never had a tofu bahn mi before. Crispy with pieces of taro root deep fried to round it out. Not bad at all. \n\nGrilled Pork: Slight hint of lemon gras, done cleanly, but not that flavorful.\n\nMeatball: Kinda iffy, It was sorta bland, wouldn't order it again. \n\nChicken: Good flavor, I didn't care for the texture of the chicken, sorta creamy slimy. The gf did however, like it. \n\nOverall sandwich: The bread was great, mayo, veggies were fresh. \n\nThe place is clean, and people are friendly. I kinda like the dinosaur theme, although weird for a Vietnamese sandwich place (you would think its hamburgers or bbq). \n\nThe price is more expensive than normal Vietnamese places, but its also not in the tenderloin with not as friendly service. Given that, parking is easier in the tenderloin than in Castro. Castro is 100x more clean though. Only problem is I always get Vietnamese sandwiches on the go. \n\nTo sum everything up, I wouldn't go out of your way for these, but if you're looking for a quite bite at a decent price its definitely worth it.", "author": "Steven C."}

The shop itself is on the small side, occupying a retrofitted basement like space, sparsely decorated with three or four tables, a \"Jurassic Park\" pinball machine, and a fridge stocked with the usual variety of cold, non-alcoholic beverages that you'd expect to find at most Vietnamese sandwich shops. The employees look to be in their twenties, and I've read recently that the owners are as well, so they could be one in the same.  Whatever the case, I've found them to be welcoming and friendly, creating a comfortable vibe in a space that is probably best suited for takeout orders, although I've always been lucky enough to find an open table awaiting me.  The menu is straight forward, consisting of about five or six styles of b\u00e1nh m\u00ec, and if my memory serves me right, one of those options is usually vegetarian.\n\nOn my most recent trip to Dinosaurs I had the special pork b\u00e1nh m\u00ec, which was  pork p\u00e2t\u00e9, slices of roast pork, and pork loaf (ch la: lean pork, potato starch, and fish sauce).  There was also a generous portion of the standard b\u00e1nh m\u00ec vegetables, namely thinly sliced (julienned) carrots, cilantro,  daikon, and jalape\u00f1o. The bread was warm and crunchy on the outside, while remaining soft inside, and it didn't distract from the balance of flavor.\n\nDinosaurs is an affordable, friendly, conveniently located spot to enjoy some freshly prepared b\u00e1nh m\u00ec when you're in San Francisco, and especially if you are near the Mission, in the Castro, or heading in the general vicinity of the lower Haight or Western Division.  If you are in San Jose,then I wouldn't recommend that you jump in your car and immediately head over to Dinosaurs so you can find out what b\u00e1nh m\u00ec is all about because the opposite is still true, but if you happen to be out in the city, then by all means give Dinosaurs a try.", "author": "Jay U."}

I've been to about a dozen Banh Mi places in SF and this place is my #1 favorite for fresh-tasting sandwiches, and second only to Saigon Sandwich in the Tenderloin overall.\n\nMy favorite thing to order is the BBQ Pork banh mi -- ask for pate.  IMO, this makes the sandwich and should be required.  They also started serving a shaking beef banh mi, which might not be \"authentic\", but it's awesome.\n\nThe spring rolls are also pretty good if you are looking for something light.  I don't eat shrimp, but the veg ones with tofu and taro are pretty tasty.  Spring rolls can get a little tough if sitting around for a while (they aren't typically made-to-order at Dinosaurs), so I could see how they might be hit-or-miss.  My fianc\u00e9, who doesn't eat meat, likes ordering the Spicy Tuna and shrimp spring rolls.\n\nThe one thing I've found annoying is that recently when you get a sandwich to-go they just wrap it in paper once, rather than wrapping it in paper, slicing it in half, and then wrapping it again, as to prevent you from making a hot-and-cold mess all over the place while eating the sandwich.", "author": "Eytan B."}

I think there might have been an ownership change, because the sandwiches now are much better than they were a few months back (like 2011). I've been twice in the past month now, and I'm pretty sure there has been a change in the recipe. In the past, the sandwiches were thin on meat, didn't have enough pickled veggies and jalapenos. Now, the Special actually tastes ethnic, albeit a bit more expensive than what you'd pay in Inner Richmond. Still,  it's fantastic for the Castro. I consider it the \"Chipotle\" of banh mi- it's tasty, clean, and more expensive. It's also a great option when you've got a hankering for ethnic food.

I recently went here to redeem a couple of Groupons my wife purchased and am glad I thought to call them cuz the address on the Groupon said 2275 Market.  You actually can walk in on 18th Street and you are right there or you can navigate a little mini mall and discover them in the rear.  Once I arrived I asked the counter person if I could redeem both coupons on one visit and he said that technically I couldn't.  I then asked it I could order two, leave, walk to the corner, come back, get in line and order two more.  He said that would work so I went for it.  I tipped on each order and he very graciously thanked me for understanding, that guy gets a star just for that touch.  As for the sandwiches, I am a vegetarian so I went with the crispy tofu and also the portobello and they were great.  Perfectly crunchy rolls, lots of fresh ingredients and a healthy dose of peppers that achieved a near perfect blend of spicy tanginess.  I also ordered the advocado shake on a whim and I will be back for that in no time.  Jamba Juice be damned all Dino's advocado version needed was a protein boost and I would be good to go.  I also loved the color and texture of the shake.  I do have one minor complaint, I drank this baby on my drive home and the multiple brain freezes could have caused a serious pile up.

SO glad that this is in my neighborhood now! The sandwiches were what I'd expect, I got the special because it sounded most like what I wanted out of my banh mi. The bread was great, the ingredients were definitely fresh, but the flavors of the mayo and the meat were maybe not as sweet/salty as I'm used to (more on the salty end of the spectrum). Still good though.\nThe fact that they have grass jelly and coconut drinks to accompany just makes my days in the Mission even better.\nThe evening I went the sandwiches took quite a while to be made, though, maybe a good twenty minutes or so during the heat wave in November; I'm used to Lee's where it comes out instantly like magic, but I think what it came down to was a severely under-staffed store. There was a large group order ahead of us, and there was only one person manning the entire store: the kitchen, the register, everything! Poor guy, he must have been exhausted! They need to help this guy out!!! Rooting for you Dinosaur!\nAs this is one of the few banh mi places in the neighborhood, and probably the tastiest and cleanest, I understand the prices can be a little more expensive but I do wish they were more competitively marked as they are in the South Bay where you can get banh mi for $2.50, maybe $3, but $4.75...? I was a little meh-ed by it, but not worth making a huge ruckus about (I mean, it's still a satisfying under $5 meal) but it is what it is, a comparatively more expensive place.\nOverall it was a good experience, I'm just glad there's an injection of this food-type into the neighborhood, but I'll admit it's not necessarily my favorite banh mi spot. Maybe I'll always just be a Lee's kind of girl; but, I'm definitely willing to give this place another shot and I think being fairly new, there's room for improvement so I'm conservatively rating it at a 3-star!\nDinosaurs, rah!", "author": "Jessica L."}

You're right!\"\n\n So one day I walk into this shop called Dinosaur's, a little sandwich spot with a red exterior, hoping to have some great Vietnamese sandwiches (Banh Mi). Now, I'm initally from San Jose and there are a lot of amazing places to get some great vietnamese sandwiches. But  I believe Dinosaur's tops them all, in terms of the service, the people, and most of all their sandwiches.\n\nI LOOOOOOOOOOVE Dinosaurs. and I come here as many times as I can in order to get my sandwich fix because any other sandwich places doesn't taste quite as good. It is a healthy alternative to the mess you get at some other sandwich spots. You can literally taste the freshness of the sandwich. The bread has a great crispness to it (unlike getting soggy breads at other places) and all of the meats have a very specific flavor that hits at different moments of the \"eating process.\" I can't necessarily describe it other than that it is definitely something that has to be experienced.  Everything on their menu is fresh with tastes that will tickle and embrace your taste buds. The menu is inventive yet traditional to Banh Mi and really constructs a great base to expand their business. (They're in the process of having a little fridge area where there is going to be the traditional spring rolls and other vietnamese staples you see at Banh Mi sandwich shops)\n\nI try to take new people here each and every time that I go (almost every Sunday and the occasional weekday) and every person that I've taken has always thanked me for taking them and comes back either on their own, or tells me that they want to go back and get more. Once you've had the sandwiches you become addicted. No joke.\n\nAlso, the people who have made this place happen are probably the most chill people you would ever meet. Don't be afraid to say what's up to Chris and AJ whenever they're working because they can strike up a conversation with you on anything and are very friendly.\n\nThe sandwich that I recommend is the BIG BANG (You would have to ask for it, it's a \"secret\", which is pretty much everything on the menu). However, don't be intimidated because the way that AJ makes it is very well balanced and will hit your taste buds in all the right places. Wash it down with a coconut juice and your taste buds will thank you! \n\nDEFINITELY SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THIS PLACE! They deserve it! and tip well!", "author": "Jonathan M."}

Tasty sandwiches (I'm vegetarian and had the tofu one - - very flavorful, get it with extra veggies, no extra charge, and I'd get it with extra spread next time). Really sweet, friendly people who offer friendly, genuine chat while working. Very modest folks, very different from the pretentious Ike's across the street. Great prices, under $5. Big, generous servings.", "author": "Ice Cream Truck I."}

So I passed by this little vietnamese sandwich joint close to Ike's, I thought, wow, this is sure gutsy for another sammy place to be such close proximity of the Ike's hype. I have to concur with the comment on the price of a sandwich in the Castro, $4.50, it's a great price and a good little spot for a snack such as a vietnamese sammy. Light, the bread is airy, the meat is tasty and the other fillings are tasty as well. I think there is room for improvement on the bread and the fillings such as just a tad more of it. \nThe people who worked there were great, they were super nice and that makes a big difference. I'm sorry but if I was waiting in line for a sammy at Ike's and there was some stranger that got in the front of the line just because they knew the owner or the person making the sammies, wtf, I would walk away from that shit. Just inconsiderate for that to happen, especially if I was famished. Perhaps it was a good idea to open this place up so close so that people like me would discover it and get hooked. Thanks for the option, Dinosaur.", "author": "Natasha C."}

I actually like their Bahn mi better than Saigon, which always seems to be dripping in some sticky soy sauce concoction, but I prefer the BBQ Pork at Two Tarts or, even better, the offerings from the Lil Green Cyclo food truck.
