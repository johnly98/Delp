We arrived at the party on Saturday, May 12th around 5pm.\n\nI was starving, so I dug into the Peking Duck Buns: Peking-style roasted duck wrapped in Chinese soft bun. They were room temp, but I didn't care. The duck had nice flavor, though I like my buns with more green onion and hoisin sauce. I later had another heated up and it helped with the hardness of the bun. Made if softer and fluffier. I went online to look at their menu and price wise, it looks like it's $12 for 4 buns? A little pricey for my taste. I'd rather just get a whole order. And give me the whole duck. Not just the outside part used for the buns. (I know it's not the norm, but we always ask for it at family dinners.)\n\nPretty good buns. Just a little too rich for my blood.", "author": "Elena N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-06", "description": "Overall - the dim sum options and the wor wonton soup are the stars of the menu, and the prices are reasonable. The last time I ordered delivery, they included an order of pot stickers for free, and their pot stickers are good.\n\nFood: I have mostly stuck to the dim sum/wonton options at the restaurant. The dumplings are hot, have a chewy wrapper that isn't too thick or thin, and a generous savory, tasty filling. The pot stickers have the expected delicate wrapper with a solid crunch on the pan-fried side. The wor wonton soup has a light but flavorful broth, shrimp and pork wontons, snow peas, and carrots. I appreciated that they are generous with the wontons in the soup. It bums me out when I order wor wonton and get like 4 dumplings. I think there were at least 8 or 10 in my serving.\n\nService: at the restaurant, the service is friendly and efficient. It's not notably great, but not notably poor either. It gets the job done, and is nothing to complain about. Delivery service is better than average. My order arrived a little early, was piping hot, the soup's plastic container was well-wrapped in a plastic bag and hadn't leaked at all. And, as I mentioned, it included a freebie which earns them extra points.\n\nAmbiance: the restaurant's ambiance is pretty basic, casual Chinese eatery. Not really a date place, but a great, casual place if you have a hankering for dumplings and don't want to go out to the avenues.\n\nPrice/Value: this place is reasonably priced, especially for the quality of the dim sum. An order of dumplings is $8 and comes with 6 or 8 dumplings I think. The serving sizes are relatively large, so go with a friend so you can share a couple items and you can probably get out of there for $15 each, including tax and tip.", "author": "Sara E."}

The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was savory and delicious.\n- Beef Chow Foon - Great staple.  A little oily...but that's the only way to keep the noodles separate!\n- Stir-Fried String Beans - These were alright.  Savory but maybe too limp?\n- Mapo Tofu - Spicy kick of flavor! Tasty.\n\nDefinitely a go-to for when I don't want to cook or need something quick to eat.

One of the worst Chinese food I've had in Sf, period.  \nSteamed Pork with chives dumplings - the only dish w decent taste decent but some of the wrappers were dark? Looks pre-cooked and reheated maybe.  \n\nThe fried spare ribs - the meat had a FOUL taste.  what the fuck.  I sniffed it after I took a bite. I plan to toss the rest out.  Don't feel safe eating it.  \n\nString beans - it was soggy and fried with preseved vegetables?  Zhai Cai for those who Speak Chinese.  It's like the spam of vegetables, loaded with preservatives.  I've never had string beans with this in China or anywhere in the U.S. I love the dried, black beans or garlic infused string beans common at Sichuan places.  This is the worst version I've seen.  \n\nBok Choy - okay, most Americans would not see this vegetable and tell you it's Bok Choy.  So I'd be careful with the labeling.  And also where's the FLAVOR?  It tastes like steamed vegetables with some garlic bits sprinkled over it.\n\nThe beef westlake soup - $11 for a not even a full cup of soup that has just egg white and some ground beef?  The broth is bland and worse than my canned Chicken broth.  You are kidding me?  This is worst than food in a food court and you charge $11 for that?  where's the vegetables in this soup?  the traditional recipe has usually watercress in it. \n\nThe fried pot stickers came for free.  I didn't order it but it was way over fried and tastes like frozen dumplings that were freezer burnt from my own freezer.

Pork gyoza were solid, complimentary with Yelp check-in.\n\nSweet and sour pork- my little boy's fav- was the right balance of sticky and savory/sweet. Chow fun noodles with BBQ pork, chicken and shrimp were slightly mushy and lacking in proteins. I wouldn't rush to order it again.

Jamie W. and I ended up here by accident after the Pride festivities in the Castro where we were celebrating the SCOTUS ruling on same-sex marriage. It appeared everyone else at the event was looking for places to eat, so we ducked into this low-key restaurant on the corner of 15th and Sanchez. I remember when this was the middling Daimaru Sushi before, but now it's a fairly standard Chinese restaurant among several in the general neighborhood like House of Chen and Red Jade.\n\nOur timing was good because only one other table was occupied, but it started to fill up quickly as our meal progressed. We noticed there was a lengthy list of dim sum options, so we ordered the $7 Green Chives and Pork Dumplings, a half-dozen of them steamed and filled with ground pork and chives (photo: http://bit.ly/1UDD82I). They were tender, piping hot and quite delicious with that burst-in-your-mouth savoriness we both liked. Continuing our dumpling theme, we shared an $8 bowl of the Wor Won Ton Soup, which turned out to be almost as good as Eric's, our favorite maker of won ton soup in the city. It contained pork and shrimp dumplings, snow peas and carrots in a light broth (photo: http://bit.ly/1IVnvx1).\n\nWe were pretty happy with our dinner so far, but our experience declined precipitously when the $11 Mu Shu Pork arrived. It had all the standard ingredients - stir-fried eggs, pork, cabbage, bamboo shoots, and shiitake mushrooms - but it was saturated in a heavy soy-hoisin sauce that made the entire mix too salty to eat with any satisfaction (photo: http://bit.ly/1NmPX2q). That was a shame since the crepes were prepared nicely with just enough give to allow easy wrapping of the mu shu mixture. We ended up eating a lot of our dollar bowls of Brown Rice to soak up the sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1JONfwK). In hindsight, we probably would have preferred a more predictably crunchier dish like General Tso's Chicken to fill our palates. But hey, two out of three ain't bad.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...starts out well with the dumplings and then falls down with the mu shu\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...nice enough inside if rather compact\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...our server was quite attentive and energetic\nTOTAL - 3 stars...stick with the dim sum and you will likely not be as disappointed as us", "author": "Ed U."}

I can't review all the dishes we ordered because I seem to have a few friends who don't understand what \"family style\" means and ate a whole dish and didn't share.  What I did get to eat was fairly good.  There seems to be a trend with Chinese eateries these days to pile on the minced garlic, none of that nice subtlety of flavors blended together.  Mongolian beef was good but somehow didn't taste all that much like Mongolian beef, and I really miss those little white skinny noodles we used to get when we ordered Mongolian beef, wasn't very spicy either (but I didn't ask for real spicy, thought Mb was supposed to be spicy to begin with).  Same for kung poa chicken (or however they spell it), good but didn't really taste like kung pao chicken I've had in the past.  I mean, what I did get to eat was fine, not too greasy, not too bland, not too salty, quite good in itself.  They did deliver right on time, points for that alone, gave the guy a good tip for driving all the way over to us but probably can't afford to do that much.  Wish they'd had Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce on the menu because I really do need more greens in my diet.  It's better than what I can get in my neighborhood now, too many Chinese restaurants have closed up and left.  We don't have Chinese all that often any more but it's good to know this place exists.  Now, whether they'll deliver NOT through Amazon is the question, some places won't, which I find odd since they will through Amazon.  Oh, yeah, got a point for being open in the middle of the day, far too many eating places seem to close after the lunch rush and don't reopen until dinner, but I always want food during the hours those places are closed, sigh.

The portions were ridiculously small. Maybe they are better when you eat in the restaurant, but the delivery portions were borderline comical. For example, we ordered honey walnut prawns, the box was about the size of a can of spam and it contained only 4 prawns. We ended up having to order 2 additional dishes at a closer Chinese restaurant to shore up the tiny amount of food we got. We spent 15 dollars at the other restaurant and got almost the same amount of food.\n\nI edited the review to 2 stars because the food was actually good.

The server couldn't have been more pleasant. Some dishes (soups, potstickers) were above average. The prices were really good for the lunch special. The entrees were just okay. The Mongolian beef my friend ordered was tasty, not amazing... the chow fun I ordered was totally not chow fun like I'm used to. Much more like Filipino pancit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-05-01", "description": "(TL;DR:  In the running for worst Chinese restaurant in San Francisco.)\n\nI have strong doubts about the veracity of the positive reviews for Makli, mostly because I am staring at our first order from this place, as I write this.  Here is the immediate truth:\n\n1.  The potstickers and dumplings are clearly packaged frozen potstickers, like you buy in bulk at Costco.  In fact, I suspect that these are literally Costco potstickers.  I could taste the freezer-burn, and they were not even re-fried.  The edges were untouched by oil or heat.  I have a strong suspicion that a microwave may have been involved, rather than a wok or fryer.\n\n2.  The sauce that comes with potsticker and dumplings is straight from a bottle.  It is highly acidic, but otherwise flavorless, and it does not in any way complement the frozen potstickers/dumplings.\n\n3.  The Kung Pao chicken is just plain off--it even smells bad.  The chicken has been over-\"velveted,\" so it tastes slimy (also suggests that it may not be fresh chicken).  The sauce looks and tastes like it was slopped straight out of a restaurant-supply vat, with no additional spicing except red pepper.  The vegetables are potentially also from frozen, given that they have little to no taste of their own.\n\nHow a Chinese restaurant this bad could possibly survive in San Francisco is beyond me, much less how it could average 4 stars here.  The food looks and tastes like every possible corner was cut, to make it as cheap as possible.  I would be disgusted if I saw this order arrive in a strip-mall Chinese restaurant in Nebraska.  \n\nI pray that you find your way to this review, before taking a risk on ordering from this bizarrely terrible place in the Castro.  I apologize for writing so much and so passionately, but it really was an appallingly terrible dining experience that I hope no one else ever has to share.", "author": "Badunc D."}

I came here for dinner and ordered the mapo tofu clay pot, cod fillets with black bean sauce, fried salt and pepper cod, and shrimp and pork dumplings. The entrees were all in the $10-13 range (yes, fish at that price), the dumplings were $6, and this all came with a heaping portion of white rice that never seemed to end. They also serve free oranges for dessert, which are cut nicely and super fresh!\n\nFood-wise, if I really had to pick at issues, I'd say the fried salt and pepper cod was a tad on the salty side, but it's no problem at all.\n\nLastly, the service is terrific and ambiance is not bad - standard for a Chinese restaurant and I'd say the seating is quite spacious, probably because there weren't many people around during dinner. Why this is, I have no idea since it's soooo awesome, but I'm planning to visit as many times as possible before it gets flooded with customers.", "author": "Amy G."}

We had two orders of the General Tso's Chicken thinking it'd be decent and we wanted there to be enough to go around but we had over one full container left because no one liked it. It was all mostly mushy breading with lots of pieces with no chicken inside. One guest even asked if it really was chicken because she swore it was fish because the inside was mushy in texture and fishy in flavor. The honey scallops were a joke...people laughed because there were like a total of 7 tiny gum-drop sized scallops swimming in soy sauce. The dish was like $12. Mongolian beef was crazy salty with thinly sliced green peppers that were so wilted from being drenched in soy sauce. Seafood clay pot had so many broken pieces of bean curd, it looked unappetizing and was overall not tasty...just seemed not freshly made compared to other restaurants. Had other unmemorable dishes like bok choy. Normally when we order Chinese takeout we have very little leftover but this time people didn't eat much. Won't be ordering again from here.

The dumplings were poorly made and it just felt like I was eating soggy potstickers. The Salt & Pepper Fried Cod Fillets ($9) made up for it, though. YUM! It's topped with jalapeno slices and goes well with the white rice ($1) which by the way is a good amount for 1 or 2 people.\n\nOur main entree was the Singapore Style Chow Fun with prawns, barbecued pork, and vegetables.

All in all the food was fine but I will try takeout from several other places before calling back.", "author": "Andrew F."}

I ordered food just as I walked out the door from work on my way home and exactly 45 minutes later, my food arrived at my door! My EAT24 app was solid. That's where the impressiveness ends.\n\nI ordered the Veggie Chow Fun, Walnut Prawns, and a side of rice (just to meet the $20 minimum). I didn't give it much thought when I ordered the Veggie Chow Fun because at every other place I've gone to (and from growing up eating home cooked Chinese food), chow fun entails thick cut flat rice noodles. However, at Makli, chow fun means thin rice noodles. Granted, they do have a description on their menu, but please rethink this and maybe change it to match the actual meaning of chow fun -- it might save some of your customers a bit of disappointment. The Veggie \"Chow Fun\" was average. Nothing special, with an assortment of water chestnuts, broccoli, and baby corn. The Walnut Prawns was also just okay. Nothing bad, but nothing impressive either. A solid serving of sweetened walnuts accompanied 10 lightly fried shrimp coated in a sweet mayo based sauce. The side of rice was a side of rice, as expected.\n\nWould I return?

Then why is it so hard to find decent (and here I mean edible) Chinese food in the United States. Most of the time despite my best efforts the food just fails. It's either overcooked, undercooked, or swimming in a greasy mess that is supposed to be called a sauce.\n\nIn comes, Makli in the Castro neighborhood. It's an unassuming place, and frankly you might walk right by this place without thinking twice. Pay attention people! This place is a gem for anyone who is craving a great Chinese meal. Best of all, this place gives you vegetarian options like you would not believe, including, vegetarian hot and sour soup. Yes, you read that correctly.\n\nOn my most recent trip to San Francisco, I was staying at a bed and breakfast just down the street from Makli. Hot and sour soup is a must no matter where I'm at and I have to say, Makli has the best. It's spicy hot and tantalizingly tart all at the same time. You won't find any better. The vegetarian lo-mein is just the opposite. It's warm with that faint smokiness you can only get with properly prepared lo-mein. The vegetables are seared and slightly charred and cooked to a tender-crisp perfection.\n\nThe next time you're in the mood for Chinese, get over to Makli. You won't regret it and you can bet my first meal back in the city will be here too. \n\nMy rating...4 Paws\n\nWith love from my dog bowl to yours....Happy eating.\nShatasdogbowl.", "author": "DJ S."}

Plus we wanted a quieter place to convo after the noisefest of the NY Giants/49ers game (GO GIANTS!).  I mentioned a craving for Chinese, and as we traveled just around the corner from Hi-Tops, the Makli sign popped up in our faces.  I'd never been.  WHAT A FIND!!!\n\nFirst off, the young wait staff was very pleasant and attentive.  We ordered pork & chive pot stickers -- they were quite good, and not *HEAVY*.  For entrees we ordered a staple, House fried rice (the quality of which I use as the benchmark to all Chinese restaurants).  We also ordered orange chicken, and beef with green beans.  The fried rice was phenomenal:  fresh, FLUFFY, and with just enough of all the requisite meats, NOT sopping in soy sauce and NOT greasy; it was practically perfect.  The orange chicken was delightful: crispy with a LIGHT batter crust (NOT a dough ball), decidedly chicken-dominent, and NOT soaked deep in the sweet and sour sauce and certainly not greasy; in fact, the sauce had a nice, spicy hot kick to it.  The beef dish was also very good; the generous amount of meat was fresh and tender, as were the accompanying greenbeans; the dish was prepared with a fish sauce, which while not a personal preference of mine, met with the approval of my friends.  For drinks, my friends had beers while I had a hot tea that came with a lovely blossom in the glass -- flavorful.\n\nFinally, a word about the staff:  we arrived for dinner late in the evening, and notwithstanding that, they were very kind and in no rush to close and pressure us out.  Adding to that, the cook staff prepared our meals with the care that could have easily come at the middle of the day, again not rushed and sloppy.\n\nI will DEFINITELY be back, and I know when my friends come back to SF, Makli will be a regular part of our routine enjoyment!", "author": "Gabe K."}

I ordered that, the shrimp dumplings, fried rice, and the veggie noodles (with an explicit callout to use a veggie broth, not meat). The egg tofu was good -- and if I'm craving it, I know where to get it now, but the rest was medicore at best. The shrimp dumplings were really tiny and not as flavorful as some other delivery dim sum I've had. The fried rice was cooked in consistently, and I got a chunk of something that I'm pretty sure was MSG.

They were mushy inside. \n\nOrange Chicken and General Tso's Chicken: Both similar but really good. I asked for extra spicy orange chicken and they gave me a side of this really spicy sauce which i loved. \n\nAll in all, I will probably only order this place from now on because it was very tasty and all of the other places in my area (mid market) suckkkkkkk", "author": "Jazmyn W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-21", "description": "I was compelled to write a review for Makli because their Lemon Chicken was the STRANGEST dish I've EVER tasted in a Chinese restaurant. The plain chicken breast is battered and deep-fried, then smothered in an intensely sweet, candy-like, bright yellow sauce. Sauce that seemed better suited atop ice cream, not meat. It didn't taste bad, per se, but it was certainly in no way typical Chinese cuisine.\n\nI think this dish can only be properly described as \"carnival fare.\" It's something I would expect to see served up next to some funnel cake, deep-fried Twinkies, and chocolate-covered bacon. Not with a side of rice in a Chinese restaurant! My friends and I were so confused (and intrigued) by this dish that we purposefully packed some of it up to take home and give to other people to try.\n\nEverything else we ordered was standard.\n\nOur party of three entered the empty restaurant around noon Sunday because Kitchen Story across the street was packed (as was probably every other brunch-serving establishment in the Castro). Our egg drop soup, pork dumplings, spring rolls, Yangzhou/House Special fried rice, and shrimp chow mein were all fine, though consistently underseasoned. Whether this reflects the chef's personal taste, or our fitness-conscious neighborhood's, I do not know.\n\nI give them three stars, because Yelp says that equates to \"A-OK,\" which describes my feelings perfectly. I was satisfied, and I got my money's worth ($8.95 lunch special).\n\nFINAL TIP: Be sure to laugh at the menu, which misspells \"Dumpling\" as \"Dumping,\" in every instance of the word. It's a tradition at this restaurant now: The couple that came in after us laughed at \"steamed dumping,\" too.", "author": "Andrew S."}

So we are calling Red Jade, our tried and true for dinned tonight.  BUYER BEWARE ON THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "author": "Chuck A."}

Best Chinese food in the neighborhood.  The veggies are cooked just right.  Still slightly crunchy and not overcooked like the other place that's close by.  The sauces are subtle and very tasty.  Everything seems fresh and tastes like the cook and ingredient buyer actually care about the quality.", "author": "J s."}

He thought it smelled of \"old dog.\"  The pot stickers I had were deep fried all around, rather than just on the bottom.  The kung pao chicken was pretty gross.  This is far from an exceptional restaurant.  It's so bad that they had a TV going as a way to distract you from how bad the food is.  A must miss.", "author": "chad H."}

The food is fresh and well-prepared, and the hot & sour soup is some of the best I can ever remember having. Since they're on a quiet corner, it may take a while for people to find it -- but I hope people do. Makli Restaurant (that's its official name) is new to the neighborhood, and I wish it all the best. (I'll be helping out by eating there regularly.)", "author": "Scott F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-21", "description": "i was here with a big group of people and we all agreed that makli's portion sizes were generous and the food tastes pretty good. compared to all the gazillion chinese restaurants in the city, the food is pretty standard but what you won't see is the place crawling with loud chinese families. what i liked about this place is that makli has a smaller, more intimate feel. it is a place where you can enjoy affordable chinese food and a conversation without having to scream over the table. all in all, makli isn't terribly memorable and i wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if i was in the area, i would definitely consider stopping by to pick up some of their yummy salt and pepper fish.", "author": "The Hangry Chef O."}

AMAZED. food was fresh, service was fast friendly, cute.  Sauces made the difference in tired old standbys like sweet/sour pork; ,chicken w cashews. wonton soup with noodles was HAPPENING. beautiful room, lovely family seems to run it. Low prices; appears there are even lower lunch specials.  we had to hurry, because of movie start time; everything came out fast, fresh.  I had out of town guest, who was thrilled. I, as an old, jaded, seen everything resident, was very pleasantly surprised. dumpling wontons in soup were amazing. hope this place doesn't get TOO much publicity.wont be able to get a seat.  Kicks ass over anything in the Castro or Mission IMHO.", "author": "William S."}

The five of us ordered two appetizers, four shared plates and one entree.  The spring rolls arrived almost immediately and were delicious.  That's when the good parts ended.  The one entree arrived quite a bit later, along with the rice and one shared dish.  It was another 15 minutes before we received two more shared dishes.  And another 10 minutes before the last one arrived.  That was the house special chow fun.  The noodles were thin rice noodles, nothing like chow fun.  We finally had to ask where the second appetizer was.  It was ready and delivered very quickly which showed that our server forgot it.  After we were finished eating it still took a good 20 minutes to get the check.   And wouldn't have gotten it then had we not asked for it.  There are lots of other options for Chinese food in the neighborhood.  Any one of them is better than this.  I won't go back.", "author": "Douglas A."}
