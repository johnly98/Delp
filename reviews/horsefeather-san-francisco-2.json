When we arrived we were told that we had a 30 minute wait for a food table, so we went to the bar to try one of their craft cocktails. My drink was by FAR the best. I tried the \"Mamajuana\" because strawberry just sounded refreshing, and it exceeded my expectations. The description is \"gin, strawberry compote, martini & rossi rubino, \"rainwater\" port, yuzu, guajillo\". \n\nPrice: \nExpect to pay $12-13 for a cocktail, and $15-$20 for a dinner entree.\n\nService: \nGood service for a small, busy restaurant.  \n\nThe only disappointing thing that happened was with dinner. We sat down to order, and it took a little time for the server to get our orders. We had been looking at the menu for about 10 minutes and so we had a pretty good idea of what we wanted. Two of the things my husband tried to order were sold out for the day (the burger and the tuna bowl) so he ordered pork tacos....only for the server to come back and say they were sold out of pork tacos. We ended up not staying for dinner because there wasn't anything else that he really wanted, and while in San Fran we wanted to eat GOOD. \n\nI would definitely go back to Horsefeather, and I can't blame them for being busy or sold out of items. It's a small, local, neighborhood bar with food on the side. The cocktails alone would bring me back every time.", "author": "Hillary S."}

It definitely got loud, especially inside.\n\nThe patio is adorable. Looks like a greenhouse with glass ceilings and I was able to see part of the sunset as I sipped my drink. The inside is cozy but much darker. I would not sit inside during the day. Service was also great. Our waitress was very friendly and the other gentleman always kept our water glass full. \n\nWe just had drinks (sparkling rose and beer) but next time I will definitely try the cocktails! I was surprised cocktails were only $11-13 for how good they looked--not bad for SF! The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was that my rose was served in a coup glass instead of a flute (personal preference, I'm not a fan of coup glasses as they spill too easily). So I'm wondering if I can request a flute next time. \n\nThe food also smelled amazing. Everyone was ordering burgers. Will come back soon!", "author": "Priyanka C."}

I'd been waiting all summer to visit Horsefeather, and I finally went during my last week in San Francisco! It was worth the wait for sure. Definitely a memorable experience.\n\nI'd say the best thing about Horsefeather is the cocktails! The menu is unique and every cocktail you get is even more refreshing than the last. I started with the Sun Country, which was probably my favorite. It was definitely reminiscent of driving through New Mexico at sunset during a roadtrip. I also loved the Mama Juana. If you like strawberry, this will be your ultimate refreshing cocktail!\n\nThe food was also pretty good, if a little bit expensive. We had the ceviche and the poke, both of which were light and went along well with the cocktails since the food was also refreshing. \n\nI have to mention that the atmosphere here is also great.

We ordered wine, sparkling rose and tequila shots, but will have to be back to try their extensive cocktail menu. \n\nExcellent place but probably not good for groups!", "author": "Kylie F."}

Our waitress was very friendly and nice, but I think it was only her working so it would take a while for most things. We got:\n\nMimosa: Heavier on the champagne : OJ ratio, just the way I like it! Lots of bubblies and refreshing good flavor!\n\nKale salad: My friend loved this--it's not massaged kale, so it's crispier. The veggies looked very fresh and tasty, but my friend said that he thought the dressing was a tad too salty from the pecorino cheese.\n\nBacon side: Very salty, but ultra crispy and delicious! I actually prefer my bacon less crispy, but it got many compliments from our neighbors around us.\n\nTrout scramble: The eggs were done nice and soft, and the trout actually tasted more like smoked salmon--not that I was complaining. It was a very tasty dish and the rye bread sopped up all the juices after I was done. Absolutely amazing! \n\nOverall, Horsefeather is a unique, nice spot for brunch, but just make sure you are patient as they are a bit understaffed.", "author": "Monica L."}

The kale salad was super good, reminded me of how I cook kale at home... EVOO, Himalayan salt, lightly saut\u00e9ed. Pumpkin seeds, apple slices, pomegranate seeds... a very fall dish. I really enjoyed the salad! The burger was very tasty as well! DOUBLE so it's definitely one to split- my friend and I added egg and avocado. The beef was juicy, the burger was saucy, the bread was toasted---- SO GOOD. Also they give you salt and vinegar chips no the side, we all need a break from fries every once and a while. The chips were nice since the burger was so heavy, I can't imagine having fries as well.\n\nSplitting 2 cocktails, kale salad, and burger with avocado and egg--- $35 each.

If I didn't have cocktails at Nopa, I can easily drink 3 of these ... before dinner.\n\nMad Dog is another great choice. The blended scotch is softened up by the port wine hibiscus syrup.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-23", "description": "My girlfriends and I do a ladies brunch every month or so. On Saturday, April 15th, my group of eight gathered for brunch at Horsefeather. They don't take reservations, so the plan was to meet at 11am. I arrived around 11:15am. Three in our party were already there, so we managed to grab a table for eight and everyone just filtered in afterwards. It wasn't very busy at the time.\n\n*Foraged Mushroom Scramble: with goat cheese, bagna caudo, brussel sprouts, toast ($15), add Bacon (+$3)\n*Chilaquiles: with two eggs over easy, salsa rojo y verde, cheese, avocado ($16), add Carnitas (+$3) x2\n*Breakfast Burrito: with housemade chorizo, home fries, scrambled eggs, cheese, arbol salsa ($15)\n*Pozole and Slow Cooked Eggs: with chili verde, tomatillo, hominy, curtido, avocado, tortillas ($16) x2\n*Almond Flour Waffles: with strawberry cream cheese, maple syrup, macerated berries ($14) x2\n*Kale Salad: percorino dressing, fuji apples, pomegranate, candied walnuts, avocado, cotija cheese ($14)\n*Halibut Ceviche: with charmoula, avocado, cucumber, tortilla chips ($16)\n*Double Cheeseburger: a blend of chuck, shortrib, brisket, housemade bun, special sauce, smoked onion, lettuce, beer chips ($16), add House Bacon ($3)\n*Sergeant Major: rye, cold brew, vanilla almond milk, maple syrup ($11)\n*Bloody Mary: tomato, horseradish, dijon, grapefruit, worcestershire, dill, garlic ($11)\n*Arrowhead: cocchi americano, grapefruit juice, diplomatico, bitter lemon soda ($12)\n*California Cooler: gin, celery juice, lime, thyme sauvignon blanc syrup and sparkling wine ($11) x3\n*Red Rooster: aperol, brown sugar, ancho reyes, pineapple riesling syrup and soda water ($12) x3\n*Sightglass Coffee: bottomless ($4) x5\n*Bailly Lapierre Brut, Sparkling Cremant: Burgundy, France ($11 glass) x2\n\nWe basically ordered the whole brunch menu. My favorite was the mushroom scramble. So savory and cheesy. And I adore mushrooms! The halibut ceviche was also very tasty. A nice fresh contrast to all the heavy breakfast food we ordered. Another favorite was the burger, but I didn't try it. My group loves bacon, but they don't offer it as a side, so we just added bacon to a couple dishes and asked that it be on the side. It's only two pieces as an add on, so order accordingly. I wasn't in the mood for cocktails, so I stuck to bubbly, but everyone seemed to enjoy their drinks.\n\nFun place for brunch. I always like trying new spots. (Well, new to me anyways.) And if you come with a bunch of people, you can basically try the whole menu. A great way to spend the afternoon with good company.", "author": "Elena N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-05-12", "description": "I'm horribly guilty of reacting too quickly and with my emotions. Last week, I got into a fight with a friend over something stupid (isn't this always the case?)\n\nThe hormone-charged, keyboard warrior in me wanted to send a text message to rip him a new one (or two) and end the friendship. So, I sent the text....to myself. I kept myself busy and the next day, I looked back at the text message. \n\nEgg on my face. How foolish of me - there's more important things in this world like Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna's baby-to-be. Geez, it's been like 3 months?! That is one smart girl. *Cha-ching*\n\nOk, I know...who the phuck cares? \n\nI read that Horsefeather was one of the most highly anticipated bar openings in 2016 (from former Bourbon & Branch, Local Edition, Foreign Cinema, and Blue Plate employees). At the time, I bought into the hype so I waited for a week to mill things over. \n\nThe conclusion? \n\nHorsefeather's cocktails and the app that we sampled were mediocre for San Francisco standards (sounded better on paper). Absolutely nothing wrong with that but true to what they're going for, it's more of a neighborhood bar. Even then, my favorite neighborhood bar: Holy Water in Bernal Heights has much superior craft cocktails: https://www.yelp.com/biz/holy-water-san-francisco. \n\nOn the cocktail front, Horsefeather have 10 cocktails on their menu divided by stirred and shaken. They're reasonably priced at $10-$12. \n\nFor my first cocktail, I tried the California Cooler - Celery juice, lime, thyme, sauvignon blanc, horseradish, sparkling wine, gin ($10): http://bit.ly/27gSByR. It was really refreshing but reminded me of a boozy juice detox drink. \n\nThe next cocktail I tried was the Sun Country - Lemon, vanilla, orange juice, chardonnay, mandarin napoleon, egg white, mezcal ($12): http://bit.ly/1UVYEnz. I love egg whites in my cocktails a la pisco sour and a gin fizz and this is the first time I've seen it served with ice. The ice cubes took away from the otherwise creamy egg white foam and the cocktail wasn't very well balanced. I had to force myself to finish this before we left. \n\nI tried a sip of my friend's Strawberry Hill - Strawberry, lemon juice, red wine, black pepper, cinnamon, gin ($10): http://bit.ly/24OdnUl which fared better than the cocktails I had ordered; refreshing and fruity with a nice kick from the black pepper.\n\nFor food, there's 9 items on the menu ($10-$16): quinoa salad, beet salad, spicy ravioli, halibut curry, pulled pork tacos, ceviche, chicken wings, burger, and fried chicken. The kitchen closes at 1 am. \n\nSince we had dinner reservations elsewhere, we only ordered the \"Claypot\" Chicken Wings w/ fish sauce, caramel, fried garlic, ginger, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro ($11): http://bit.ly/1OlfnPW. This was basically Chinese soy sauce chicken wings (similar to what you get at a Chinese deli) but with a hit of pungent saltiness from the fish sauce. I think I would have enjoyed it more had I not made a batch at home just days before. \n\nService was cordial but lacked that warm, neighborhood feel. There was only one server and bartender at the time so it did take some time for us to receive our drinks. \n\nSit at the enclosed front patio area as there's lots of natural light coming in and it's great for people watching. It's also dog-friendly (front patio only) which is a big plus. The bar area and the tables in the back area were stark and dark.\n\nParking wasn't an issue since we came for pre-dinner drinks at 5 pm but good luck after that. \n\nI know everyone is sick and tired of hearing about the Kardashian clan but am I the only one highly anticipating the name of Rob and Blac Chyna's future baby?\n\nI just hope it's not related to a compass....", "author": "Cherylynn N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-03-15", "description": "This place is the worst. I was rushing past a huge group of people to get out to get my cousin who was kicked out. When I returned I was told I wasn't allowed back in because I touched some girl with white hair that works there. Ha ha ha sorry basic girl I am not interested in anyone except my wife. All my friends thought I got in a fight cause that would be more my style. Obviously they singled me out not only because I was a minority but also because I'm gay. I was there the night before without any issues. If I looked like a basic gothere wouldn't be an issue but because I looked like a super lesbo I guess I am a predator. I have never had this issue and I'm sure I never will again. It's a sad day to see how this place is nothing but a bigotry establishment! Never in my entire existence have I have been accused of touching anyone inappropriately boy or basic girl.\n\nUPDATE 3/16/18  *A Feather For My Thoughts**\n\nI read how the business owner responded to this review and couldn't help but be offended and embarrassed for its blatant lack of any responsibility and failure to even vaguely address my review. As a business owner you really need to pay a little more attention to the words written. First off your generalization of how you normally would care, or normally would reach out to a genuine concern experienced by a patron pretty much reaffirms your bigotry. Lezzz be honest if I looked more feminine, or my skin was a lighter shade we both know it would have never been an issue for me to bump into a few people or push them to the side of the bar because I was distressed after learning my little cousin had been kicked out of your establishment and was intoxicated out in the middle of the street in a city he was not familiar with and did not even have his wallet. Firstly, I will admit I am sure I was probably rude and in a hurry to go make sure my cousin was ok. Even though it was apparent he was with my party in your establishment(mainly because we were the only people of color in the bar) you failed to let us know you had kicked him out because you felt he was too intoxicated. I admit I would have been upset but I still would have respected that you had the decency to let me know. So when I raced out to go check on him(without my phone, wallet, hoodie, or jacket) I have to admit I found your lack of concern and empathy extremely concerning, for any of your patrons. You kicked someone out of your bar extremely intoxicated without notifying his party, then when I became upset and ran out of the bar, you kicked me out and made false claims I inappropriately touched one of your staff. I have never and would never touch someone or grope them inappropriately, especially not in your bar. There is a huge difference between pushing by someone, and grabbing them or sexually groping them like you are accusing. I see that you are quick to casually be judge, jury and executioner in this half assed response to my review by claiming you have witnesses. Well quite frankly I had witnesses too and not a single one of them said that I inappropriately touched Malfoy, here's a little learning moment for the community, just because I look GAY and am GAY, does not mean I must want you.  You even overcharged us and illegally charged us for drinks we didn't have, probably thinking we were too drunk to notice. Just an FYI, this drunk/gay/brown woman checks her statement, and AMEX was just a phone call away. \nSan Francisco used to be a city of diversity, welcoming attitudes towards differing cultures and backgrounds, and that inclusive feeling of even though we are all different we are all in it together. Now as we begin to see the domination of $$ over ethics, assumptions over questions, and a general \"it's all about me\" attitude I can't help but think that this is a microcosm for everything that's wrong with America right now. Your treatment of a minority/lesbian woman regarding sexual conduct is unacceptable, your response to my review is condescending and unacceptable. So, in closing Horsefeather is everything that is ugly and wrong with San Francisco and our country as a whole. You might as well start selling hats that say, HORSE FEATHER, make America Straight and White again! Maybe you could put up a few Trump posters up in the front window and really let the neighborhood know your true political ideals. \n\nCHEERS \nYOUR FAVORITE LOCAL GAY aka HORSE OF A DIFFERENT FEATHER!", "author": "Eisa m."}

Definitely check out the drink menu and stick around for the food if you don't mind slower/distant service.\n\nWe went here on a Friday with a huge group to try all the noms and drinks Horsefeather has to offer. I mean, it has to be good right? Being from the same branch as Foreign Cinema (one of my all time fave places to eat).\n\nSetting- Almost a hole in the wall-ish vibe with minimal seating inside. There are indoor and outdoor seating areas but none of them will really accommodate groups bigger than 4-5. \n\nDrinks- All amazing. I had 2-3 and they were super creative and fun.\n\nFood- Pretty tasty, imagine Foreign Cinema but more bar-ish. Between everyone in the group, we tried all the dishes. Everyone loved the burger and the agnolotti. Note, I would pass on the chicken because I think there was a bit too much garlic or onion in the slaw for me. \n\nService- Yikes. This is where it kinda went downhill. We did have a pretty big group and without the organized seating, we were spread out around the bar area. We each ordered separately (but with the same tab) and things got strange. The servers were kind of rude when taking additional orders. The orders came out SLOWLY. I mean, we waited a good 30 minutes between getting each order for the two of us. In the end, we ordered a dessert and after 30 minutes, we asked the bartender(because we sat at the bar) if the order was going to take much longer because we had to leave soon. She came back and said that our server didn't even put in our order. The server came by and didn't even say sorry, she was just like oh, so do you want me to put it in then? I was irked because our group tab definitely went over 1K and she couldn't even feign a little remorse for not putting in a order?

So even though it came out only a little late, they comped it on the house. This was super nice and 10/10 will party here again", "author": "Kim P."}

They are really quite perfect. The Tuna poke bowl and ceviche are also delish with nice clean, fresh flavors. \n\nMy first drink was the Cisco. I enjoyed it but the Campari gave it a distinctly medicinal flavor. I tried the night train which was smooth. It had a good espresso and cacao nose but the flavor was more branca menta. My friends had the Champipple and loved it. After my Cisco I asked for a Penicillin they didn't have ginger syrup so they couldn't make it but the bartender came out to my table and talked with me about alternatives and I ended up with a great lemony bourbon drink that I liked so much I sucked down 2 of in 40 minutes (stop it!).\n\nThe ambiance is great. It's pretty has interesting, Art Deco accents, has the perfect dim lighting that makes everyone look more attractive and artistic than they are IRL and brings some added life into the mix with live plants, reclaimed wooden walls and an atrium style room. My only decor complaint is the tables in the front section are extremely close, but we can call that added intimacy. \n\nI'm a huge fan. If you are looking for a delicious and unpretentious meal, savory, satisfying cocktail with great ambiance, horsefeather is your place!", "author": "Katie M."}

Delicious! My friends got the Nightrain cocktail which was tasty too. Perfectly strong and flavorful. Once we were seated, we ordered a few dishes. My favorite was the one I picked, which was the Beet Green Mascarpone Ravioli. SO GOOD. It was a decent amount of food for a light dinner, and the flavors were on point.

Great for a date, or a quick bite before a show at the Independent.  Enclosed patio out front where they allow dogs ... greatest thing ever for you dog owners out there.", "author": "Jarrod H."}

I live in the neighborhood and have been giving the benefit of the doubt to servers/staff the past 4-5 times that I've visited. Clearly, there is a pattern. The service is terrible. Twice that I've gone for dinner/drinks our order was completely forgotten (twice!) \nToday I was there for 1 &1/2 hrs and never once had a server come back to ask if we wanted anything else... or refill out water. When I finally flagged someone down to ask for a beer it was slid down the communal table 1/4 poured and with attitude.  Not to mention that same server preceded to spill a glass of water on another patron without any sincere remorse.  This place is never busy because the service stinks.  And the food is... meh.\nDon't normally review but given the numerous bad experiences I had to speak some truth. Hopefully they will take these reviews in to consideration and instill some empathy and work ethic into the staff.", "author": "Sharon K."}

The bar is beautiful. Food-wise and service wise is where there was a downfall. \nI was content after going here the first time and ordering the kale salad which is doused in a creamy dressing. It was what I was in the mood for at the time but really a bit overdressed. \nSecond visit, I ordered the beef and broccoli which was rather salty, also very overdressed, and some\nof the scallions tasted like soap. My friend ordered the pastrami which was honestly terrible. Flavors were off and didn't meld well with one another. Portions were small given the price. I'll go back most likely as I enjoy the vibe, but might just stick to drinks or apps. \nOh, so the other thing was that our waitress was way out there during the second visit...her facial expressions and even little comments were so bizarre and made us a tad uncomfortable.

When our food was delivered, we'd finished our drinks and the bartender said \"do you want some water?\" We thought it was odd that he didn't ask if we wanted another round. We ended up ordering another round from a different bartender. The entire time we sort of felt like they just didn't want us there. They were clearly most interested in talking & joking around with each other over providing welcoming service. The only positive was the kitchen - they hustled and were quick to fire up the orders.
