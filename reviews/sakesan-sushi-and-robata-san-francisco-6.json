He lives around the area, so we walked over to Sakesan from his house. It was a random Thursday night, about 9pm, and the wait was going to be 45 minutes. This place sure is popular! We opted to sit at the bar since there was no wait time.\n\nWe ordered three special rolls - Cherry Blossom (salmon & avocado roll topped with tuna & tobiko), Deluxe California Roll (fresh snow crab with mayo, avocado, cucumber & tobiko), and the Kirin Roll (BBQ eel, avocado, tobiko, crab, and unagi sauce on top of a spider roll). Both rolls were really good, but I think I liked the Cherry Blossom the most. The Deluxe California was so-so and I would skip it next time.\n\nWe also ordered chicken gizzard robata and deep fried octopus. Both were good, but I'd recommend ordering more robata over the other appetizers. The flavor is really top notch.\n\nWe ended up staying for about 2 hours and no one rushed us out at all. They were also able to help us split the bill in the way that we wanted it. Servers were very attentive and super nice.", "author": "Michelle T."}

It was inedible and I had to spit it out.  The rolls didn't taste very fresh.  The gyoza was mushy inside.

The Phoenix roll, which I point out, was a modified version of the spider roll, my favorite roll.  Pieces of deep fried soft shell crab was what I find almost irresistible to my taste.\n\nHopefully, I may want to come back to try something different next time.

Their deal is all time round and not only happy hour like other restaurants. I was a huge fan of the umami but slightly sweet sauce that was included. \n\nAs for the rolls, we got the 49ers and the Giant rolls. 49er was a bit meh but got the job done. Giant roll was definitely the star out of the two, most likely due to the unagi sauce. I mean who can dislike a touch of unagi sauce on a simple roll of snow crab with salmon! \n\nSome tiny things that led to the dock of the one star was the initial service we received. When we first entered, the restaurant wasn't busy. However, we were neglected/not acknowledged by the servers for a fair 5-10 minutes even though I'm sure that they saw us waiting.

Literally, every Japanese dish you can imagine is transcribed onto a two page menu. This takes away from the quality and thoughtfulness that can go into preparing a couple of dishes really well as apposed to a bunch of dishes mediocrely.\n\nWith that said, the sushi was subpar, though the nigiri was the exception because it was fresh. The sushi rice on the specialty rolls was hard, with a stale quality, and the seaweed was chewy and almost inedible on the complementary tuna roll. The real kicker came when I shoved a whole piece of unagi into my mouth and found myself chewing on pin bones. I really think if they cut down the size of the menu, a greater focus could be spent where it really matters. \n\nAnother thing that should be worked on is the service. In a span of a couple of minutes, I was asked consecutively by FOUR different servers if I was ready to order after telling them I'm waiting on someone.

The uni was from Hokkaido, Japan, really fresh but really small tiny pieces(for $18). Always one of my favorite dishes to order from a Japanese restaurant.

So we just accepted our fate and sat there.  \nWe had also come here specially for oysters but they had run out by dinner time.  \n\nOur server had also never served us our plates, utensils or anything.. so when the food came out we had to just sit and stare at the food until the waitress finally noticed our raised hand. \n\nAnother thing is that we had spilled some water on our table and it kept dripping water on our laps when we lifted our tiny cups to drink. It was so uncomfortable.  We finally got napkins way later and then was able to wipe up the water but then had no napkins for the rest of the meal.  \n\n\nFood wise, we ordered rolls and some skewers.  The rolls were pretty good! Flavor wise, I enjoyed it a lot.  However, the rice was kinda dry.  A little sip of water was needed to swallow it.  \nHowever, I did not enjoy the skewers I ordered.  I got the beef tongue and chicken hearts.  The beef tongue pieces were thick and personally really really felt like I was chewing an actual tongue/making out with a cow.  My boyfriend and I could not stomach it.  Chicken hearts were alright, but did not enjoy the flavors. (Side note: chicken hearts and beef tongue are my favorites which is why I ordered these skewers in the first place. )\n\nThe whole time we were there we felt highly unwelcome and ignored by our server and when she did interact with us it was very short and curt.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I felt so uncomfortable by the whole dining experience so we left early instead of ordering more, which is disappointing because I had really waited forever to finally get a chance to try this place out. \n\nThe ambience of this place was nice and bustling though. \n\nAlso, in case y'all were wondering, I still tipped decently (19% in cash) even though the service was shitty and ruined our anniversary dinner date.", "author": "Daisy S."}

There are so many amazing things about this restaurant - I'll try my best listing them all (you all should really read my review as I absolutely love coming here)!\n\nMy mom, fianc\u00e9 and I literally stalked this place while it was being built out. We couldn't believe Sakesan was coming to my neighborhood (we used to go to the Clement location)! \n\nHere's what make this place:\n- The owner and staff. Barry, the owner, is awesome! No matter how busy this place gets, he always have a huge grin on his face and is continuously running around making sure all of his guests are happily taken care of. The sushi chefs and manager are also great. Thanks for taking such great care of us. \n- the happy hour (from 4pm-6pm daily) is ridiculously awesome. Try the tuna poke tacos and stock up on the $5 large sakes\n- the freshness of the food is also amazing. We have dined here so many times (and brought so many of my friends) and everyone has always been delighted with the food\n- try the fresh wasabi. Totally worth the $3. It'll give your food even more amazing flavor\n- the separate karaoke rooms are a blast and they'll even let you turn on your favorite sports team \n- they take reservations on yelp and always honor them \n- they are kid friendly! I have a daycare and many of my family have gone there and have raved about this place too\n- their grilled items and soups are delicious. Give them a try too. I love their sukiyaki soup. Perfect for a cold San Francisco day, with a side of hot sake \n\nI can go on and on about how awesome this Japanese restaurant is but honestly, the best part of it is the ambiance.

Still pretty packed for a Thursday at 9pm, but got seated at the island table area real quick. There's a mix of tables, a sushi bar, and rooms where you take off your shoes and sit down. Nice ambiance and great date place/hang out with friends. \n\nOverall, solid place and good price for sushi in Ingleside. We ordered the $1 oysters, which were really good and tiny. They were fresh and we ended up ordering 3 dozens. I would definitely come back for the oysters!\n\nWe also ordered the Gambler Roll and Cherry Blossom roll. The gambler definitely is IG worthy, they put 151 in the middle of the dish and light it on fire. One of the pieces out of eight are SUPER spicy and luckily i didn't get it! My friend said the spice lasted a long time, but it was really good. The rolls were solid and nothing too special, but the ingredients were definitely fresh.\n\nThe sashimi selection of 35 pieces for $64(?) and I would say that was the most disappointing. The fish were overall fresh, but the way they displayed it on ice (although looks really good), made some pieces of the sashimi really cold and more wet? If they can find a way to display the fish, but keep the sashimi not all tasting a different temperature, that would be great. That was just one thing I thought could really be improved.\n\nI would not get sashimi by itself next time, but most likely try the omakase nigiri (10 pieces) to see the chef's selection and decide about sashimi from there.\n\nOverall, solid and great service. There's also a TV so a good place to watch the game at. I would come back again and also want to try out their Karaoke room! There's a $250 minimum spent for their room, so gather your friends for some drinks and sushi and sing your heart out together :)", "author": "Josie L."}

Beautiful.\n* There's no paper towels in the restrooms, only hand dryers. Great, save the environment.\n* Food was great. They even serve fresh wasabi at the price of $3. Unfortunately, the fresh wasabi is mixed with green onions and garlic, and it looks very liquid. Other than that, it definitely tastes like real wasabi.\n* We got a floor table, but it's not really \"floor\". You'd have to take your shoes off (fantastic, love this), and they have space for you to put your feet down, so you actually feel like sitting on a chair. You don't have to cross your legs. I don't know how to best describe this, but yeah, I hope you get what I meant.\n* The hot green tea was good, but it's $1 per person. It's a good green tea though.\n* The Lion King (I think that's the baked salmon?) was great.\n* The chicken karaage is a bit different. It's in small pieces, but they're good.\n\nNow, let's talk about what I don't like (or I hope would change):\n\n* The sink for hand washing would be better with sensors. When I went there, one of them was still running and no one was there. Such a waste of water.\n* For the skewers, they should put the number of skewers that you'd get. I ordered \"2 Yakitori\" and \"3 Kawa (Chicken Skin)\". What I got was 4 skewers of yakitori and 6 skewers of chicken skin. We still ate them all, but on the menu, there are some items that end with \"... (2 pcs)\". Hence, I assumed that the ones without that would only be 1 piece. The server told us that each skewer order comes with 2 pcs. So, why would some menu have explicit \"(2 pcs)\" on it?\n* The chicken skin skewer is also very crispy, which I don't like very much. I like the skin to be soft. So, if you like super crispy skin, you'd definitely like this.\n* I was expecting the standard oyako donburi would be served, but they don't serve that. They serve other things like curry donburi or bbq eel. \n* I would love them to also have katsu curry though, I would definitely come there to get to-go order if they do (along with oyako donburi).\n\n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back to this place.

Tried this place out for the first time after it was recently opened and me and my cousin loved it so much. We ordered 4 robata, 2 rolls, deep fried squid and half dozen oyster (not everything is in the pictue because we couldn't wait lol) and the bill come out to be only $58! The price is soooo reasonable! They have $1 oyster ALL DAY EVERYDAY. This alone can keep me coming back here again and again. Their robata is DA BOMB, the meat was perfectly seasoned, good portion for a good price. Sushi rolls were on point too, fish was fresh and all the ingredients put together tasted absolutely delicious. I also really like the modern yet sophisticated design of the restaurant, they use Japanese wine bottles as decoration. They have various items on the menu, raging from udon to rice bowl to sushi. I will definitely come back here to try out other dishes and introduce this new gem in the neighborhood to my friends! I hope they will keep up the superb quality and friendly customer service :)", "author": "Bao Q."}

We were seated immediately when we arrived and our server was with us shortly after. We ordered lots of sake and lots of food; small plates made it easy for our group to share and try lots of different things. We started with some yummy oyster shooters and then moved on to food. The menu is large and no doubt serves a variety of tastes. All of the rolls we tried were delicious and fresh, we loved the OMG, lion king, lobster, and super dynamite roll (the latter probably being our favorite). We also tried the negima (another favorite), chicken skin, beef tongue, scallops, and the kake miso (all very delicious and flavorful). Overall great food, chic atmosphere, and friendly service!

The quality and freshness of their food, especially the sushi/sashimi is spot on!  The prices are little high but all worth it as they are not skimpy with their ingredients in their Sushi, cooked and Izakaya entree..Just Wonderful!!  The best part as the name of the restaurant suggest is the selection of their Sake, it is REALLY NICE!  I personally have expansive appreciation for Sake and I must admit they cut no corners with their selections.  I'm glad they opened this one in the Sunset District as I live close by but I still visit their sister place in the Richmond district on Clement which is the first Sakesan Bistro.

I've been waiting for a good sushi place to open up nearby and this place did not disappoint. We finally decided to try this new place out and made a reservation online for 6:45. Definitely make a reservation because when we left a lot of people were waiting to be seated. First of all, the menu is extensive and offers everything you could possibly want! We tried a lot of different items on the menu and I really went there to try the Robata items. We had half a dozen oysters which was just $1 each! Such a steal. It was good but definitely not as good as other seafood restaurants. We also had the tempura basket($13), sake sashimi, sake sushi, salmon roe, New York roll, Philly roll, dragon roll, baby abalone, gyutan (beef tongue), and beef with asparagus skewers. The abalone ($12) was delicious but you only get one skewer (2 pieces) for that. The rest came with two skewers. The beef tongue was tasty, had a great texture and sauce for it. The sake was sooo fresh and delicious, I couldn't stop complimenting it to my boyfriend. My boyfriend doesn't even like raw fish and he even said it was good! All the sushi was super fresh and definitely worth the try. They're all for a good piece as well. We definitely got a lot of food for two but we really wanted to see what this restaurant was about and we were definitely not disappointed. Also, we found out at dinner that they also have karaoke in the back. Apparently they have two rooms in the back and you have to request it with the staff for day and hours/ rate.

When the two gentlemen next to me received all of their four orders immediately even though they arrived a half hour behind us, I knew something was amiss. I asked another waitress if our order was coming as we had been waiting quite a while; she said \"it's coming soon\". In 5 minutes, the appetizer tuna tartare tacos (very good) arrived. We waited another 10 minutes and the waitress asked \"did you order anything else?\" and we said \"yes, 5 sushi rolls.\" Part of our order (dragon rolls) came 10 minutes later. I asked where my spider roll was, and the waitress looked confused. Ten minutes later, my order came from a male server with our waitress nowhere to be seen.
