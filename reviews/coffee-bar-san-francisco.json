It was one of the most sour tasting brews I have ever had, and definitely was not nearly as smooth as many other places I have been to. I must mention that, for $5 is was the most skimped cup of coffee I have ever been served. It was the size of a small plastic water cup you get at Burger King, and the pour was half foam. So I basically paid $5 for literally 3 sips of coffee. DO NOT ORDER NITRO BREW TO GO. BIGGEST RIP I HAVE EVER HAD! \n\nI thought I would give this place a try since the reviews seemed decent and the atmosphere is what really drew me into this place. The atmosphere and decor is definitely a 5 star, but doesn't make up for lack of coffee i received. They also have a very nice outdoor patio with succulents and nice greenery that make it very relaxing. Good spot to study.", "author": "Darren C."}

A cute coffee shop in the Mission that has good coffee and food options, fast and reliable WIFI, abundance of outlets, and high ceilings for a great study/work spot. Believe it or not, but this combination of basic coffee shop offerings is actually quite rare in SF - most likely because owners want high turnover in a frequently trafficked area.\n\nI got the havana latte (latte with condensed milk) for $5. A pretty average latte that was way too sweet.. even for condensed milk. But I'm willing to give them another shot because everything else about this place is great.\n\nThere's one bathroom here, but it's spacious and clean.\n\nPretty packed on the weekends, so come early to make sure you snag up a spot.

Over 1,000 reviews so far?  And here I was, thinking they were just a busy neighborhood spot!  Especially since it's easy to miss; if not for their red signage on the side of the building, I never would've known what this place was!\n\nFrom the outside, Coffee Bar looks like so many other nondescript warehouses in the neighborhood.  Inside though, the space is actually quite warm and welcoming.  Oh...and LOUD (read: noise cancelling headphones are your friend).  Still, it's a nice spot to get some work done, assuming you can find a seat.  What's more, though their menu isn't large, they have a tasty looking slate of food options to choose from.\n\n-- VIETNAMESE COLD BREW - Cold Brew, Sweetened Condensed Milk...$4.25\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coffee-bar-san-francisco?select=3yI8Niw-3GT9Bxd2cflVEw)\nGiven the warm weather, I figured this would be pretty refreshing, but it was also legitimately good!  Not only did it have a strong, deep flavor to it, but the condensed milk give it the perfect balance of creaminess and sweetness.  I'd come back for this alone!\n\n-- TURKEY CLUB SANDWICH - Diestel Ranch Turkey, Bacon, Tomato, Avocado, Red Onion, Romaine Lettuce, and Chipotle Aioli on Toasted Multigrain...$13\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coffee-bar-san-francisco?select=SwNz1vQjr8hVSDUpw97-7A)\nWhile I didn't expect this to be bad, I certainly didn't think it was going to be this good (or filling)!  The sandwich had a lot of veggies, a fair amount of meat, and some tasty bread (though the edges were a bit dry).  As for the salad, it wasn't all that remarkable, but still a welcome addition!\n\nDespite how good the food and coffee was, service here could use some work.  It was fine during my first trip, but flawed during the other two.  The second trip, they forgot to make one of our drinks (too busy socializing, I assume).  The third, the guy at the counter kept interrupting us after every item we ordered to give us our total and take our payment, even though we told him twice our group of five was ordering together.\n\nEven with their flaws in service though, Coffee Bar is still a solid spot to grab a bite, do some work, or to simply grab a cup of coffee (though I've only tried their Vietnamese cold brew so far.  And I'm not even a little bit sorry about that.\n\nFOUR AND A HALF STARS for the food rounded down for the service.", "author": "Mike L."}

Anything mixed with \"Horchata\" can quickly go into grainy territory, and although acceptable in actual horchata, the last thing I want is for my morning coffee to be grainy.  Fear not because coffee bar has somehow worked their magic and got all that delicious ricey-cinnamony goodness into their cold brew, without screwing up the smoothness of the coffee and the beans they are using tastes fantastic; the coffee flavor really shines through.  \n\nAlso a little shout out to their house avocado toast.  I don't really buy into the whole avocado toast fad ($$$ for avocado on bread is quite frankly retarded), so when we asked the barista which savory food item he recommended.. I cringed a little when he told me \"avocado toast.\"  But of course I was on a date, and I didn't want to sound too picky so I reluctantly accepted the toast recommendation.  When the toast came out, again my wallet cried a little (just kidding my date payed, but my wallet cried for his wallet) as I stared at the typical looking green slices on bread.  Thankfully upon first bite, I soon realized that the avocado toast wasn't that bad at all, and after a few more bites in, I realized hey.. this toast was actually pretty damn good.  Really fresh avocado placed over some really tasty homemade spread.. all on top of this really freaking delicious sesame bread.  I'm totally a fan and I'm so glad that we got it.

We stopped in to Coffee Bar on a Saturday afternoon, because of all the super high ratings... The overall appearance seems cool enough. It's attached to the artist building which we love to visit. Nice looking outdoor space, and cool two level interior. BUT, that is where it all ended for us. There were three people behind the counter (1 young boy, 1 young girl, and one older woman), and only 1 customer in front of us. We stepped up and ordered our two lattes. One decaf, and one regular. I am a person who cannot have caffeine (decaf is the max my body can tolerate). The girl did the register work, and told the boy what to make. Then she stood behind the counter, staring at her phone. The older woman stood by the caf\u00e9 machine and watched the boy... well, kind of do nothing for a really long time. He finally got the person who was in front of us, their coffee. Then, he stood around by the machine . . . and stood there, and stood there... We were sitting on the waiting bench right in front of the counter, doing just that.. WAITING. Oh, let's see too, there are a ton of dirty plates and such out in the patio area, just sitting, while the young girl stared at her phone (she was actually facing them if she would have looked up). We waited, and waited... Finally, the boy got ONE latte finished. He put it on the counter and we walked up and asked \"is this ours?\", \"yes\". \"Is this the decaf or the regular latte?\"... (long pause), \"decaf\". . . Ok, so we got one down... I swear to you, it was another 10 or more minutes, and quite honestly we were determined to see just how far this would go, when a new customer came in the door. The girl did not move from looking at her phone (and yes, she is standing right by the register). So, the boy came up to help the new customer. Oh, yeah, he STILL has not even started the second latte, and he is now helping this new customer. REALLY??? It was like we were on a hidden camera show to see if we would explode (remember Boiling Point?)...The older woman never budged the entire time. Just stood by the caf\u00e9 machine. I know this is a wordy review.. but stay with me, I have to finish this.\nSo, we have been here to get two lattes, for about 25 or more minutes, and the boy finally gets back to making the second latte. It comes up, and we have our drinks. . . what a flipping disaster of a business.\nNow to top of my afternoon...That \"decaf\" latte turned out to be a regular caffeine infused drink. . . my body was jacked up until the next day...

Coffee Bar was a good choice. I got there around 10ish so I was able to score one of the coveted counter seats that line the second level.\n\nI hadn't had breakfast yet so was hungrily looking over the menu. We're in SF so of course I see the Avocado toast ($4 - add $1 for egg, $2 for bacon bits). Other options are the very intriguing sounding espresso toast ($4 - you're mine next time), yogurt & granola ($5), and egg sandwich ($8). The breakfast burrito was tempting but I was being cheapsies so I opted for the ham and cheese croissant instead which did the job and paired nicely with my latte.\n\nThis place had a good amount of seating upstairs, and several large tables which were communal. I imagine this comes in handy as starting around noon this place gets crazy busy with the lunch crowd. Their menu is fairly expansive with decent sandwich and salad options available. Also available are pre-wrapped sandwiches, great for those on the go.\n\nSince my seat overlooked the first floor, I was distracted watching all the people come in but it didn't seem like an issue for my counterparts who all looked very focused and serious. A decent number stay here for hours upon hours and even take work calls from their laptop. Music selection consisted of a lot of new alternative and indie rock a la Modest Mouse which I found enjoyable. Self-service water was a plus.\n\nNo complaints about the Wifi although you have to re-agree to the terms every hour or so. Cafe is bright, airy, and spacious and was definitely an upgrade to studying at home.\n\nThe reason I can't give this place 5 stars is it's a little on the pricier side for the quality of food you get. You can easily rack up quite the bill if you're grabbing lunch, drinks, and a dessert here.\n\nAlso there is a perpetual line for the bathroom and their toilet is weaksauce! Some blonde lady in a cute cargo jacket and booties left me her #2 to deal with so I was in the bathroom for what felt like an interminably long time trying to get that sucker down and make the toilet presentable again. (What a nightmare!) I knew someone was waiting for me as I heard them jiggle the door open. So awkward. This definitely marred my experience some.

This Coffee Bar should be called some sort of Coffee Lounge or Library, because there are wide open tables, desks, chairs, couches and even gorgeous outdoor patio seating. There's nothing like seeing everyone pulled up on their laptops, headphones on and coffee in hand that makes you want to work, as well.\n\nNot a lot of cups of coffee can make me swoon as much as this, but I wandered in on here for a quick cup and decided to see what this Havana Latte was all about. For a 12oz cup for $5, it surprisingly made me swooooon. It made my mouth melt with every sip. I ordered it with soy milk, as is my usual, and was surprised at how creamy and sweet it was. It was like a deliciously perfect, warm cup of milky lightly-caramel-ly coffee... I can see why people would crave this over and over again as it's a rich and warm cup that easily fills your appetite. Damn smooth and light.\n\nOther peoples' eats seemed delicious, but they normally go from $8-13, so I didn't go for a plate. Their sandwiches and salads are made fresh in-store and delivered to your seat. Perfect spot for a good cup of coffee and sandwich to go with your midday work grind, coffee break with friend or chat.\n\nIf I'm ever in the area again, I'd LOVE to come back. This may easily become one of my favorite coffee shops in San Francisco... And it's not just the succulents, pretty red patio seating or lots of open space... Their coffee pulls really well!", "author": "Rachel Ann C."}

The Havana Latte is popular here and it is delicious, probably because of the condensed milk. They don't drown the latte in condensed milk so it's not overly sweet. The cold brew iced coffee is also on point (or 'on fleek' as the cool kids say). I generally don't drink black coffee but this is tasty without milk. \n\nTheir breakfast burrito was just aite. Maybe because it had chicken chorizo instead of pork, and I wanted a dirty burrito to kickstart my metabolism for the day. I've had better breakfast burritos but putting tapatio on it made it more flavorful. According to one guy's tip below he warns us Yelpers to not use the tapatio because homeless people drink it.

The decor of the split-level interior design with bar seating, concrete accents, plants potted in branded mugs, and interesting wall of hanging candles is rather Instagram-worthy. \n\nThe crowd mostly consists of people wired on coffee and intently wired on laptops, or people engaged in conversations that sound like start-up business deals. This is arguably my favorite study spot in the entire city because just by sitting here, you feel the brainpower and productivity exuding from everyone around you.\n\n[THE DRANKS]\n\nMy go-to is the Vietnamese iced coffee ($4) because it supplies a walloping dose of caffeine. I also like how sippable it is: still delicious after the ice melts and dilutes the drink somewhat. \n\nI've had a taste of the vanilla latte (on point) and caramel latte (tastes like toffee candy)--the coffee is good quality and makes Starbucks taste artificial and gross in comparison.\n\n[THE NOMS]\n\nThe almond toast bread (~$4) (it has some fancy Euro-sounding name which I forget) is a must-get if you are craving some dessert. It would have been much better if they could warm it up, but the pastry is soft, fluffy, and fresh (reminded us a lot of Taiwanese brick toast).\n\nLunch is pricey and not mind-blowing, but having a selection of real foood is better than being chronically sugar-high from pastries. The sandwiches (~$10) look nice but are not gigantic, so be warned if you are very hungry. The salads are rather gigantic and you can feel healthy while munching away on your mound of veggies. I've tried the Cobb and Napa ($12) which are tasty, though I would like for light dressing (especially on the Napa because it's very strong in acetic acid i.e. vinegar).\n\n[THE VERDICT]\n\nCoffee Bar... raising the bar.\n\nYou should expect to spend more money than your average cafe study session, as hipster usually entails $$; however, Coffee Bar is pricey but not overpriced.", "author": "Edna C."}

Upon ordering take out by phone with (apparently outdated) ONLINE menu, we were told \"menu changed\" and Kalifornia salad 'no longer had chicken' so we asked for tofu and in the end they said they had chicken from another menu item, and could put some on. Great. Birthday meal, 4 people complaining about the chickenless salad - boss complained that it cost $12 each w/out chicken. (Previous salad was $13). We called and complained and they offered chicken so someone went to get it. He asked for new menu for our lunch notebook, and they said they didn't have one so he took a photo of their posted one. Fast forward towards end of lunch, a couple  of us mentioned that our Turkey Club would have tasted much better with bacon. LOOK at photo of new menu and bacon IS listed, pretty essential to a Club sandwich no? So when I called and said that 'another 2 of the birthday lunch' were shorted, this time on bacon, the guy simply says \"we haven't had bacon in 3 days\". hmmmmmm. Can't go buy any at Gus's, down the street? Or at Safeway, also nearby? WTF?!?!?!? In a past incident they gave me the wrong sandwich and when I called they refused to offer a credit, and said I had to come in right away - but I had already walked all the way from work and all the way back to work, using half of my lunch time, so I didn't want to do this.

It came with a lightly dressed side salad with carrot shavings and cherry (or grape) tomatoes. It was a good sandwich - TONS of mushrooms, nice and warm, and very flavorful. It felt reasonably priced at $9. \n\nTwo things were not optimum for me. The first was the bathroom - it really needs a refresh. The whole thing just felt grimy.....including the hot air hand dryer....which was either simply streaked with some indiscernible dirt, or stained that way. Either way....ewwww. \n\nThe second was the atmosphere this time. Last time I just had a beer and was taking it all in so maybe that's why the \"university library\" atmosphere didn't bother me. This time it just felt clinical and cold. With every single person's head in their computer, and no interaction happening between humans, it really was interesting to see how it effects the overall environmental feel.

There's plenty of tables and seats, but it can get really busy at times, so you end up being limited to single bar seating, or a tight spot at one of the communal tables. If you're lucky though, you can snag a coveted spot on one of the comfy couches.\n\nThe drinks are amazing, the pastries are fresh, and the sandwiches boast fresh and unique ingredient combinations. I will admit though, many of the food items are a bit pricey. I absolutely love the Vanilla Bean, Caramel, and Havana Lattes here. They're not only delicious, well-portioned, and intense in flavor, but finished with beautiful latte art. If there's one drink that I would skip on the menu though, it's the Vietnamese Iced Coffee. I don't know if the barista was having an off day or what, but when I tried it, it was very bland and lacked that rich and creamy consistency that it's supposed to have from the condensed milk.\n\nWhite walls strung with icicle lights and an inviting outdoor patio add some additional character to the bright open space.

When you walk in, you're immediately drawn in to scanning the elevated, expansive seating area surrounding the ground-level register area. Almost everyone, sitting side by side in neat little rows, is on their laptop. 99% of those laptops were Macs. I had a PC. So in that grand sea of shiny white and silver Apples, I always felt a little dweeby with my black Dell Inspiron. But whatever, that's just kind of a silly story I associate with this place. And I think more recently the ratio has become a bit more balanced (maybe around 70% Mac, 30% PC?), so it's even less of a deal now than it might have been before.\n\nThe vibe is very fitting for the micro-neighborhood, i.e. the Outer Mission of the Inner Mission (aka something I just made up): hipsters and their artsy snobbery meet techies and their industrial minimalism. The result is the subtly affluent, but always cool, calm and collected caffeine buzz that binds much of the crowd in this nook of the city. It's a site to be scene (see what I did there?).

Coffee Bar has carved out a little piece of a very industrial neighborhood and created an oasis. Outside is a small patio with lots of plants and sun that makes you forget your surroundings. The small metal tables and chairs are not particularly comfortable or easy to sit at so I was surprised to see so many people on laptops looking camped out. There are umbrellas at some of the tables if it gets too bright.\n\nInside is a fairly large loft with lots of seating in a typical coffee shop atmosphere. It was a nice day so we chose to sit outside. As soon as you wind up the wheelchair-friendly ramp and into the restaurant, you're in line. The entry way is fairly small and I can see this getting crowded really quickly. We must have come after the rush because they were out of forks, out of glasses and were kind of scrambling. So it's an order at the counter kind of deal with a big written out menu on the wall. The prices are very reasonable and the food is good and the coffee even better.\n\nI got a turkey club for $10.50 and a coffee for $2. I'm not sure if there were refills for the coffee as I didn't ask but the cup is not very big. You put your number on the table and they bring your food out to you. It came fairly quickly. The waitstaff was nice and efficient but not overly so. I got a small to go box by getting the attention of someone behind the counter but it took a while.

Came in before a BAVC class and had a good 45 minutes to kill before I had to be there. Ordered an iced tea and avocado toast thinking I had plenty of time to enjoy it. Unfortunately my food order got lost in the shuffle somewhere, and by the time I got it I had already finished my iced tea and had to rush to eat because I was going to be late. There's nothing worse than watching other people who ordered way after you did get their food first and having to ask someone about yours. The avocado toast itself was OK but had the opportunity to be really good. Bread wasn't toasted enough in my opinion and the portions seemed small. Chipotle aioli and sesame seeds created a good flavor combination that would have been even better with that extra crunch. Iced tea was perfect but would've been even better if I could've actually drank it with my toast. I'd definitely give this place a second chance but I left my first experience feeling a little underwhelmed.", "author": "Alie C."}

After my last one several years ago, I thought I'd try it again & see if the service has gotten better. Sadly... for THEM! It's only gotten worse! Recap: I enter & there are 4 staffers working the counter & just 2 people in front of me. Seems like it's going to go off without a hitch, only I see 1 of the 3 talking on the phone now - assuming it's biz, so I'll give her that. The other ones manning the espresso machine & the 3rd is just sorta walking around scratching his head-literally  While the 4th is unloading baked goods. Meanwhile, customers are piling up. I'm ignored for a good 2 minutes while the chaos ensues, finally one staffer apologizes & said she'll be right with me. I tell her I want a croissant & a small coffee to go & she tells me they're just brewing TWO new pots of coffee, so they're out & it'll be a few more minutes to wait. WHO runs out of BOTH coffees at the same time, on a Sunday morning!!? So, the line is getting longer & the staff are visibly clueless about managing the mess or the coffee counter & I'm getting more frustrated the longer I wait. Just wait, it gets worse when the guy behind me has ordered & then HE gets HIS coffee before me! I'm standing right in front of the espresso machine, yet still overlooked for the guy behind me! I asked the staffer where's MY coffee & she apologizes for skipping me for the guy behind me first! This is why I'll never give Coffee Bad another chance. It's not too hard to monitor 2 coffee containers & realize you're getting near the end of one & to start brewing another, so that your customers aren't made to wait while two pots are brewing! And if you obviously mess up by serving others in front of another customer who was there first, COMP my order so I'll know you actually care about F----ING up!

For the first couple of years it was setting the standard for coffee houses and was a great place to hang out -- now, not so much. \n\nThe place is broken down, with furniture that looks filthy disgusting and \"enhancements\" that seem to be geared toward the owners, not the patrons -- the \"out of place\" shed that now takes over half the patio comes to mind. \n\nThe food used to be a point of pride here -- inventive, well presented, and tasty -- it's average now and certainly not a differentiator.  The beer and wine selection was pretty interesting, especially for a coffee bar; it's pedestrian now.  The coffee remains the same, although they've had a revolving door of baristas in the past few years, so getting a good pour is a mixed bag. \n\nWhat happened?  I trace these changes to a new owner. Once one of the original owners sold, the new owner must have thought, \"I'm not maximizing my profits.\"  Changes for the worse started, including a never-ending change of the staff and managers. Where once this place felt like a community, it now feels like any other business run by an owner who believes his mission is to maximize his profit rather than to create happy, loyal customers. \n\nI'll probably not return...well, at least not until the memory of how sad this place has become recedes and I want to stay in the neighborhood. But once again, I'm afraid, I'll see how far Coffee Bar has fallen in its years of regression to the mean of mediocrity.", "author": "Scott L."}

Even when calling ahead I've experienced wait times of more than 30 minutes. The food itself is relatively good. Prices are a little high, but not too crazy considering its San Francisco. Sandwiches and salads can run you around $10.\n\nThe only upside to coffee bar is that they do offer pre-made sandwiches and salads so that you can \"grab and go\" if you're in a hurry.

I was immediately met by the irate store manager, Jamila, who insisted I leave the bike outside on the street.

At this point, my GF arrived, so I had her watch it for the 40 seconds it took to order.\n\nSidebar: The food was adequate. Good coffee, and the breakfast burrito was satiating but lacked flavor. \n\nNext Occurrence: As I was eating, with my bike parked behind my chair leaning on the fence, a guy walked out of the cafe, kicks my front wheel, and goes sprawling face-down on the sidewalk, \u00e1 la Ronaldo in a World Cup. It was so obviously blatant that I was lost for words.

Still relatively \"new\" to San Francisco, I was confusingly walking down Bryant Street wondering where the heck I was going. In this part of the Mission, industrial buildings and unmarked storefronts surround me... I turn the corner and like a glimmering diamond hidden amid the concrete and plaster of the neighborhood is Coffee Bar. The building itself is \"large and in charge,\" but so is the welcoming front patio teeming with happy San Franciscans sipping away at their caffeine and pastries. A solid handful of bistro sets hug the front of Coffee Bar. If folks aren't chattering away, others are sitting with a book or laptop... some are quietly sunning themselves surveying the people on this busy corner. \n\nUpon entering, you are met with a wonderful display of industrial chicness. Huge loft-like windows provide fantastic natural sunlight. Minimal wall art surround the joint and there are a handful of large lighting fixtures above. The bottom floor is for ordering. Upstairs, there is plenty of seating. Wooden tables and up-against-the-wall benches and metal chairs predominate. There are several group tables as well. Much to my delight, there is a generous amount of outlets for your electronic devices. For those of you who plan on surfing the web, they provide free wifi (No password required! Double \"hurrah!\") I will advise, however, if you plan to do some work or linger to not go during lunch hour. There are many signs reminding patrons to not use the main tables between 11:30-2:30... and rightfully so! I too have been in situations where a friend and I would want to sit at a wifi-friendly cafe only to wait until a table clears and then we'd have to run to grab it. Very stressful indeed! (On a side note, I don't mind sharing tables with strangers. In fact, I quite like it. I don't feel as guilty sitting alone and if you're lucky, a perfect stranger with good energies will start a friendly chat.) In terms of the crowd, Coffee Bar attracts a diverse lot: hipsters, gay and lesbian couples, older couples, students, techies, young families, first dates, book club readers (I'm not being facetious. A book club was meeting in the corner hashing out what they liked about this month's juicy novel. I wonder if it was \"50 Shades of Grey...\" Hmm...).\n\nOnto the good stuff... and by that, I mean coffee. Not only is the space fantastic, but more importantly, so is the coffee. I ordered an iced espresso; very smooth and reasonably priced ($2.50). I also had an iced Vietnamese coffee. It's cold brewed for 24 hours and mixed with sweet condensed milk ($4.50); no sugar or milk needs to be added. The latter is a great choice if you're too lazy to mix in your own milk and sugar. The baristas are very friendly and the food runners are also quite pleasant. Based on my observations, the staff look pretty happy to work there. That's always a positive sign. \n\nLastly, why is Coffee Bar my new favorite coffeehouse? Upon my first visit, the \"DJ\" was serving up some late 90s/early 2000s rock realness. From The Verve's \"Bittersweet Symphony\"  to Goo Goo Dolls' \"Slide\" to Third Eye Blind's \"How's it Gonna Be?\" to Red Hot Chili Peppers to Vertical Horizon to Sugar Ray... talk about \"TRL\" throwback playlist! I was enthusiastically jamming out... and how could you not? I felt 15 again ready to dial in MTV's \"Total Request Live\" hoping Carson Daly would play Blink 182's latest song. \n\nCoffee Bar: Thank you for a nice introduction to your space. You've warmly embraced my presence. In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, \"I'll be back.\" Oh dear.

There's no room downstairs for sitting (it's only for ordering coffee), but upstairs there are tables and couches for you to sit down, plug in your MagSafe chargers, and type away to your heart's desire. Come early to nab a spot, or wait until someone rotates off of those couches. Some tables are designated as \"no WiFI zones\" during the afternoon, so if you're planning on a long day of work here then just find a different table. Take a look at their map!\n\nOne thing I didn't like? The music. It seemed to be more of a Pandora playlist and not tailored towards any specific working vibe, and the volume was much too loud to be considered work/focus friendly. I guess if Coffee Bar doesn't want that vibe, then they don't really need to play mellow music.\n\nDrinks and Food\nThe drinks range from pre-pressed juice to your standard coffee to green, black, and herbal teas. The chai isn't too overpowering, and neither are the teas. The coffee in the lattes isn't overpowering, and the dry cappuccino has just enough foam to make me happy.\n\nI can't speak too much for the food, but my friend got the avocado toast and it looked delicious. I'm also happy that this place serves decent lunch food, versus just pastries.\n\nIn the future, I'm going to bring a good pair of headphones, park myself on a couch, and look around at everyone's hipster Mac decals. For the meantime though, I'm happy with what Coffee Bar offers.", "author": "Kat P."}

I've mostly gotten iced drinks, but a large latte (16oz)  will run you ~$5. Kind of pricey versus getting the giant 24oz venti at Starbucks, but it is SO quality and good. The espresso isn't burnt or bland. \n\nFood: (4/5) Tuna melt Sandwich w/salad $12. Tasty, but it took awhile 15 min+ to get the food.  It's a healthier version of a tuna melt stuffed with lettuce, avocado, tomatoes on a multi grain bread. Deeeeelish!  I've had their tomato and cheese scone  ($3) and a raisin cinamon swirl croissant (that was a bit too sweet for my taste, $3) The pastries are a bit on the pricier side, without being completely mindblowing. \n\nStaff: The cashiers at the front are super nice and helpful if you're a first timer. \n\nAmbiance (4.5/5) : Various types of seating options: two sofas for relaxingl 4 large work tables (@capacity at least 6 people each) 2 long  tables with high stools (5 people each roughly) ; an outside patio area for eating mostly; and a sprinkling of tables that are LUNCH only from 11:30-2:30pm (no laptops allowed, 30 minutes max). It can get a bit crowded, so if you're with a group of friends, sometimes it comes down to just luck to get some space.  The patrons at this place are pretty polite - don't be scared to ask people if you can join their table, most people would gladly make space for you. \n\nWorkablility (4.5/5) Wifi for free! Pretty reliable wifi, except sometimes it randomly gets slow when there are too many people here.  Outlets everywhere! This is a major plus :)  I love coming here to do work. \n\nVerdict (5/5) :  One of my favorite coffee shops in the city, I wish I discovered this sooner.

I work up the block, and love their horchata cold brew, so I have been willing to overlook the attitude until today.  I walked in at 5:15 PM and was going to pick up one of their prepackaged meals from the fridge when the guy behind the counter yelled \"sorry miss, we're closed\" in a not-sorry tone of voice. Which, now that I see their hours, they were - though since the gate and the front door were propped open, there really wasn't a way to tell.  I think they could have sold me something from the grab-and-go that was about to be thrown out, even if they were technically closed, but in any case, the rude yelling is uncalled for.  So I'll take my custom across the street to Starbucks from now on, where the coffee is worse but the service is better.", "author": "Nina T."}

The baristas are very chill & friendly, even our servers and bussers exudes that feel-good relaxed vibe.\n\nLocated just a block from my friend's Bryant apartment in the Mission, this coffee bar is a a favorite amongst the locals. Always packed, with lots of people waiting around anxiously for an open table.\n\nCoffee bar is very laptop-friendly, particularly macbooks (YESSSS!!!). Every single patron here (with the exception of the to-go order customers) were busing tapping away at their laptops. I was told that this is where most of the locals call their \"workplace\" or \"my office\". During my visit, I witnessed a couple job interviews & 2 staff meetings.\n\nThere's outdoor seatings, but most of the action is indoors. The balcony overlooking the coffee bar and foyer is constantly occupied: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5a0deGsSdIP6gXl_On1kCw?select=CZ8Bdq4WiiQgSPh50X_F2w\n\nThere's a power outlet at every single table and free wifi. However, it's difficult to get onto the network when everyone's on it though. \n\nLot's of tables, including this communal table. The owners try to encourages a sense of community among patrons, forcing them out of their comfort zones to mingle with one another. Awesome!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5a0deGsSdIP6gXl_On1kCw?select=8k9bmCotLbSyXtrHQOtzuQ\n\nThere's also designated \"lap-top free\" zones during the hours of 11:30am-2:30pm. This is to accomodate people who stop in for a quick lunch or coffee break during the busy lunch hours. There's only a 30min time limit on these tables. \n\nOne dude decided to disregard the signs. But the staff was quick to act, by politely asking him to put his laptop away or move. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5a0deGsSdIP6gXl_On1kCw?select=eCX-C4rf_GGe_t6i8o9sXw\n\nThe only teas avail is from the Five Mountain Teas Co (http://www.five-mountains.com/fivemountainsori.html). \n\nI got the organic BERGOMAT BLACK TEA for $2.50:\n Rich, full-bodied and had a nice citrusy floral finish. \n\nGood selection of gourmet salads & sandwiches. Overpriced but tasty.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5a0deGsSdIP6gXl_On1kCw?select=mcSsY8dyvz5sfHlnZK0ZVA \n\nHOT SALAMI SANDWICH ($10):\n Menu stated that it was made with \"salami rosa\" but plain salami was used.

Simple but adequate menu (though $13 sandwiches and salads at a caf\u00e9 is on the expensive side honestly), plenty of seating, huge windows for natural light, plenty of outlets...that being said, if you sit at the upper bars where the hidden outlets are under the counter, they are on the near (lap) side instead of the far (knee) side of the bar so if you sit next to one and anything is plugged in, it will essentially be hanging in your crotch. I've had to rearrange seating and move a couple times when other folk want to plug their square apple chargers in and they hang directly over my lap. \n\nThere's also not a lot of air flowing through the caf\u00e9, so it's guaranteed to be 10+ degrees warmer than outside. (Its jacket temps outside right now and I'm almost breaking a sweat inside the building.)\n\nThe main downside to Coffee Bar is the less than reliable and slow internet.

Because I have lots of work to do and need changes in my environment in order to be my most productive and, well, I just like them!\nI look for 3 things in coffee shops: 1) wifi (ideally, free and functioning), 2) quality of their chai lattes (no coffee means tea tea tea), and 3) atmosphere (the most important criteria to me). In my opinion, coffee bar hits all 3 and VERY well. \nThere is free wifi and it works - yay! Their chai latte (esp iced) is delicious. And the atmosphere is A+++. There is plenty of seating, including outdoor seating. The lighting is superb. Noise level is just right (i.e. if you forget headphones, you're not screwed). I've only had a sampling of their menu, but the butter croissant I had this morning was killer and it was BIG too! It can get crowded to the point where you won't find a spot though, so I recommend coming before 11am on any given day if you're planning to stay a while. Also, certain tables don't \"allow\" laptop use from 11:30am - 2pm, but that didn't really stop me.... or anyone else ;).\nI will be back. In fact, I was/am back.

Coffee Bar is apparently the best hot spot for folks working on startups, which was apparently by the fact that 100% of the people there had laptops.\n\nWe were planning to spend some time there to work so I ordered a \"Connie Mac\" panini and a Vietnamese iced coffee to power me through the work day.  The panini was loaded with turkey, bacon, mozzarella, and pesto and more and came with a fresh spring salad.  For $10, the sandwich had awesome flavor but a bit expensive.  However, when you factor in that we were using the space to work for much of the day, it seemed like a bargain.  The Vietnamese iced coffee wasn't as good as the drip-style stuff in the authentic restaurants but not too shabby either.  I'm super sensitive to caffeine so having it at about 2pm was a bad idea and I expect to pay for it the rest of the night.\n\nAs a place to work on your startup projects, Coffee Bar seems made for the nomad.

Seating was upstairs and outside, and on a Saturday around noon, both choices were crammed with people. The outside was very dog-friendly, though crammed with bodies, tables, chairs, and the place seemed to attract lots of regulars. While people outside basked in the sun and the easiness of the mid-weekend, people inside sat diligently on their Macs (all with distinguishing decals, of course), frowning in concentration over some piece of work. In spite of the sheer number of people, the noise level was not at all disruptive; it seemed like a good place to get work done. The strike against this loveliness was how warm and stuffy the air inside was.\n\nUnfortunately, I showed up in the middle of a long line, and the kitchen--small, the barrista told us--was slammed and took about twenty minutes to get my food out. If you were the only one in line and expecting take-out or a quick bite or anything to drink (not prepared in the kitchen), this would probably not be an issue. If you are in a rush, expecting food and find yourself behind a few people, I might recommend seeking out somewhere else for the sake of time.\n\nAs for the food itself, I ordered a veggie burrito, which was brimming with yummy potential but was ultimately too heavy and not that tasty. The sweet potatoes, spinach, eggs, beans and rivers of butter just didn't come together that well. \n\nI'd return here with my own laptop to get some work done with a drink, with reservations about the temperature, but probably not with the focus of grabbing a meal.", "author": "Christina R."}

When I went to Seattle I had like 5 cups a day searching for the best coffee there was.  I'm impressed that this place meets the high standards of Seattle, the coffee capital of the U.S.\n\nI got my usual - a triple espresso over ice in a large cup.  Then I added my own sweetener and soymilk.  The espresso here is strong without being bitter.  It was brewed perfectly.  They have vanilla soymilk here so it really enhanced the taste of the espresso without that weird soy taste.  They also have the clover machine here!!  Try clover machine made coffee sometime, its the newest cult hit amongst coffee lovers.  I also saw them make cappuccinos for other customers and yes, they do that pretty leaf thing with their milk... skills~\n\nI asked a barista if iced coffee from the clover was possible and he explained to me that it would not taste good because iced coffee is better when it starts out cold brewed - if you hot brew coffee and then ice it, it makes the coffee bitter and not good - gosh, they really know what they're talking about here... I was impressed.\n\nThe ambiance is very artsy and modern.  I love that their menu is written on some sort of construction paper hanging on the wall.  This place is also two stories with a large outside patio so there's plenty of seating.  My only complaint is that there was NO AC on this hot San Francisco day... but luckily I was taking my coffee to go.", "author": "Angela C."}

There's no good soup in the area and when you're jonesing for a bowl slurpy warmth, nothing else will do. Chicken broth in a vegetable soup is a huge kick to the vegetarian ego.

The coffee's good, if a bit pricey, but my decaf iced mocha is reliably delicious, and less expensive than Ritual.  I don't buy the sandwiches, because they are around $9, and that's too much for a coffee shop sandwich, in my opinion.  The muffin I bought once was just okay, nothing special.  And the barristas are pretty unfriendly and act like they're too cool to speak to the likes of you.\n\nWHEELCHAIR ACCESS:  There IS a ramp into the front entrance so that you can go up and buy a sandwich or coffee, and while there's a BIG staircase to the upstairs where the vast majority of the seating is located, I've been tipped off that THERE IS AN ELEVATOR.  I haven't been to the bathroom here, so I don't know how accessible it is.\n\nSo why do I like this place?  I love the space.  I love that there's a big, fenced off outdoor space for sitting in the sun and chatting.  I love the open feeling of the upstairs, with plentiful seating and tables, comfortable but useful.  I like that I can plug my laptop in, enjoy my coffee, and still have a lot of natural light.  While I DO think it's rather cheesy to have oodles of signs all over the place telling people that they can't just drink a cup of coffee in some places unless they buy a sandwich too, I guess that's just part of the attitude that comes with this place.\n\nWhich is why I just like, not love, Coffee Bar.  And when I get fed up with the attitude or want a reasonably priced sanwich, I go one block up to the Starbucks, which has ample seating, super-friendly barristas, and doesn't give me crap for where I sit or how much I buy.

Parking in the area sucks, so if you're taking it to go just drop someone off to pick up the drinks and wait in your car. They take cash and card so you don't have to worry about having enough cash in your pocket. The latte itself was pretty tasty and it was lightly sweetened where it didn't overpower the flavor of the coffee beans itself but also gave it a refreshing twist.

Usually in the mornings, but the occasional lunch has happened here as well, especially when I need to grab something quick to bring back to the office.  The service is impeccable.  I love the barista.  She always knows my order, is super friendly, and she always puts a smile on my face...even on one of those grumpy mornings.  She also knew my name by the third time I visited.  Really...awesome.\n\nThe chai is wonderful.  Spicy.  Perfect. And great, hot or cold.  I have been told that the coffee is really good as well.  Strong and packs a punch.  Their bottled juices (especially the beet and the kale), makes me feel like I am drinking little bits of heaven.  And, there is booze.  Which, is always a plus for an alcoholic like myself.\n\nAs for the food, eh...it's ok.  I always try to make it there early before the lunch rush (if I decide to go to go there for lunch) so I can get one of the pre-made quinoa bowls.  With a little hot sauce, they are really good.  But, they sell out quickly.  And it is always a bummer when I don't get one.  The pre-made sandwiches are a bit bland and blah.  But, as I have stated before, I am not a fan of sandwiches.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-04-04", "description": "It pains me to have to write a less than glowing review for a place that used to be my favorite working and meeting spot in the city.  As I've mentioned in reviews of other cafes, I'm a 5-day a week cafe worker and so certain elements are critically important to my ability to be productive in an environment with good and reasonably priced food and drinks with accessibility to power.  I'll go down the list of how Coffee Bar now rates in each category.\n\n1.  Productivity Vibe = 5/5\nCoffee Bar is basically a coworking space without the monthly fees.  People all around you are working hard on their laptops writing dissertations, coding and designing websites, working on their startups, and having informal business meetings.   If you sit and check your email and Facebook all day you will likely feel like a loser, so I give the productivity vibe full points.\n\n2.  Ambiance/Comfort of Space = 3/5\nCoffee Bar gets points for having a variety of work stations to choose from: a high bar with stools, couches, small tables, and large communal tables.  The issue is that they often keep the front door open during the lunch hours and it's FREEZING.  It doesn't matter if it's 50 degrees out, you may often find the front door propped open and the ceiling fans spinning while you search your bag for a scarf and put on your coat.  On occasion I've had to leave because it was so uncomfortably chilly, and my friends that I've worked there with have noted the same thing.  However, they do get an extra point for having a nice patio where you can eat and work.  \n\n3.  Power Outlets = 5/5\nPlenty of outlets to work with, although I always bring a 3-pronged extension cord to share.\n\n4.  Free Wifi access = 3/5\nThe wifi is free, but the access is only 75%  reliable.  When it's working it's working fine, but there have been several occasions when the internet goes down and I have to leave.\n\n5.  Good, reasonably priced food and drinks = 3/5\nSeveral months ago Coffee Bar changed chefs and revamped their menu, and unfortunately it was not for the better.  Their food used to be something that I looked forward to, an incentive to get things done so that I could enjoy a yummy lunch.  Now I only eat there if I'm starving.  The \"grilled cheese\" is more like cheese melted on dry toast in a toaster oven with some cold spinach leaves thrown in, and the turkey club sandwich has a horrible ketchup-drenched lettuce-like concoction on it that ruins the sandwich.  The soups are \"meh\" (bread soup, aka chicken broth with pureed bread or something like it), and most of the sandwiches are disappointing considering you'll be forking over $9-10 for them.  I hope they bring back their old menu!", "author": "Yea A."}

There are 3 theatres on the same corner, but this place closes by 7pm, so you can't get a drink before the show.\n\nLaptops: Sigh. way to many of them, don't even think of being able to get a seat there.

I have been here many times as it is right next to my office, but the last straw has been reached and I will not return.\n\nTypical experience is as follows. Walk in and get in line behind 4-5 other people. There are 4 staff behind the counter, so you think it will move along. After being in line 10 minutes and only to have 2 people helped you remember where you are and it is going to be a long haul. Meanwhile staff is chatting and laughing it up the whole time. Finally you get to order, but have to wait while the person behind the counter finishes their conversation, then their personal phone rings and they actually have the balls to answer it. (This is where I walked out last time). Lets say you decide to stay though and wait again for the person to finish their conversation. Place order to go and they ask your name 3 times, \"it is JOHN\" damn it, come on, it is simple. Hopefully you do not have a unique name or they will openly make fun of your name in front of you, this happened to 2 co-workers.

While parking and seating can be a challenge, Coffee Bar saves some seats for diners by placing signage to notify laptop users that the tables are for lunch customers (no laptops) only (during lunch hours). You'll find a lot of people working remotely from Coffee Bar and a great selection of espresso beverages. There are salads, sandwiches, soups, and pastries on a daily basis.

Minus one because it's just always busy-- even if you place an order for pickup, you have to wait a good chunk of time to ring up and get out of there. Since I always run here on very limited breaks from work, I need it to move just a *little* faster.\n\nAnyway. I've never had a sandwich, salad, pastry, or beverage here that I didn't love. They've got creative and delicious menu options, and while they're a little pricey for an everyday thing, a Coffee Bar lunch is a good biweekly treat for me.  It's also really great for settling in for a day of work, with plenty of space and outlets all around.\n\nSo why originally only 3.5 stars? Because of two things: I called around 5 pm a few weeks ago to order a salad, and was told that they didn't have the lunch menu anymore that day, and they'd moved on to the tapas menu. And I really wanted the salad. More importantly, their website said nothing about a tapas menu, or about the salad/sandwich menu ending at any point of the day. Then the next week I called for a sandwich and was told that that sandwich was no longer on their regular menu. I picked another sandwich off the website menu, and THAT wasn't available either. Grrrr.\n\nBUT. Today I checked the website to see what I might want for lunch, and it's updated! Tapas menu, new lunch menu, hours of availability for each-- WOW! Way to go, Coffee Bar. Just move the lines a little faster and it would be 5 stars.", "author": "LC H."}

Even if you can find a seat, that doesn't mean you can use your laptop at it. Half of the area is reserved for laptops while the other is for non-laptop use. If you're a PC user prepare to get stares because you'll be the only one in here. I overheard a customer say \"Is this place sponsored by Apple?\"\n\nThe food is overpriced. The lunch items look like something I could throw together at home for a fraction of the price. The pastries are way overpriced. I tried their vanilla custard bun and it was borrring. I could literally count the amount of vanilla bean specks in the custard. They carry Dynamo Donuts but of course they push up the price even though they're located a few blocks away.\n\nOn the bright side the decor and music is nice.

Plus, it seems fair to compare places to others in town and not some kind of ideal. \n\nEven though there has been staff turn-over, they manage to produce consistently good espresso coffee without the long wait or attitude of some of the competition.  The limited lunch and breakfast menus contain tasty, good items.  Prices seem reasonable.\n\nThe place still looks quite nice.  The mid-day table situation seems to have improved with some spots now reserved for those eating during the lunch hour.   However, it still can be difficult to find a seat outside of those times (especially on a rainy day); there's still a problem with lingerers.\n----------------------------\n\nReally good coffee place.  \n\nThey make a proper cappuccino; I often find myself ordering a second when I'm there on a leisurely weekend morning.  Overall, very good espresso drinks.  The baristi (is that the proper plural?) seem to take pride in their work.  I've never ordered their filter coffee, but they do have a Clover machine (when it's not in the shop) and those are always fun to watch.\n\nGood selection of beer and wine make this a nice choice for afternoon hang out as well.  Breakfast pastries and oatmeal are good, as are the sandwiches.  I've not tried the Radio Africa dinners.\n\nThe minimalist decor is handsome and the staff is friendly.  My minor quibble is with the preponderance of people working on laptops on weekdays (makes the atmosphere both crowded and a bit glum).  However, on nice days the small sunny patio is the perfect alternative.\n\nIndoor can sometimes be too loud, especially on the afternoons when a dj is present (in my opinion, not a good idea with all the hard surfaces).  Again, the outdoor patio is a good escape.\n\nThe crowd is pretty mixed; it averages out to a slightly artsy 30 something.\n\nToo many people come here to work.  Even on a Saturday afternoon, many people are sitting alone staring at a computer screen; this detracts from the ambiance.  Weekend mornings seem to have a lower contingent of workers.\n\nA good addition to SF's cafe scene (which has greatly improved in the past 2 or 3 years).", "author": "Jice E."}

I thought it odd that my Marina friends would want to host a party in my old hood, generally considered BFE to them, but I quickly discovered why. This place is AWESOME. For starters, the espresso is excellent. It was smoky, and rich, and sweet with hints of blueberry and fruit and a little bitter on the finish. Yes, I'm talking about espresso! \n\nThe wine list was phenomenal and incredibly modestly priced.  Andrew, the sommelier, absolutely knows his stuff and was engaging and great to talk to. We didn't try anything on the tapas menu but it all looked delicious and we can't wait to go back and try it.  I'm also glad that Potrero is finally getting some of the credit it deserves for having cool/great places worth the trek across town, because as my neighborhood of three years, I'm sure my friends got tired of me talking about how under appreciated it was ad nauseum. My boyfriend did a double take when we saw a party bus rolling by outside and we realized what we should have when whole foods moved in: this isn't the sleepy little potrero of before.  \n\nAlso adorable was the little seating area outside with the potted cactus garden.

We do in fact ensure (as Barefoot does) that the growing conditions are acceptable  with the farmers that we purchase our coffee from.   My brother is our Roastmaster and he travels to origin 3 to 4 times a year to visit farms that we've purchased from for years.\n\nI've been in the specialty coffee business for 9 years and my brother for 30 years, we're both part of the family that owns Mr. Espresso in Oakland.  John (my brother) was one of the first green coffee buyers to bring in organic and fair trade certified coffees into the bay area on a consistent basis as early as 1999.\n\nMy point was simply that certifications aren't everything, but we still use them.  We judge the validity of a coffee based on specific set of circumstances within each country, because it varies, and in general, more responsible growing conditions produce better coffee.  The definition of \"Responsible\" growing conditions also varies from country to country.\n\nI didn't mean to imply that ONLY responsible growing conditions produce good coffee.  \n\nSorry to confuse and I should have been more careful with my words.\n\nThank you for stopping in and we look forward to your next visit.\n\nLuigi\"\n--------\n\nThank you Luigi, this clears things up and I really respect coffee businesses that have personal relationships with the bean growers.", "author": "Jeremy G."}

My rating for a perfect coffee shop follows:\n\n1. Free Wi-Fi - has become a personal necessity.\n\n2. Tables - there are a few big \"community\" tables and a \"laptop\" bar.  The laptop bar has outlets right underneath the table.  And yes, everyone sitting at the laptop bar and 95% of the patrons own a mac.  There is also a few outdoor tables - perfect for that one sunny day.  If you come alone, your bound to find a seat.  Not good for large groups as seating tends to be scattered.\n\n3. Abundance of outlets - except for the community tables.\n\n4. COFFEE - damn good coffee, nothing more to be said. Strong, robust, espressos. Lattes, perfectly concocted.\n\n4a Baristas - Friendly, informative. \n4b (side story, feel free to skip) I ordered a small almond based cake, a \"financier\" and I pronounced it: fie-nan-see-er.  The friendly barista, said in a \"careful not to embarrass the dumb American\" tone, \"oh it's a fie-nan-see-ay. It's called that because it's very affordable small french cake, and it's shaped like a gold bar.\"  Cooooool, learned something new.\n4c. BONUS: they have wine and beer. WHAT?!  Yes, it's true... they doooo. \n\n5. Food - sandwiches and salads made with TLC and they use fresh and quality ingredients. Made from SCRATCH.  Not the typical coffee shop with costco-bought foods. \n\n6. Parking - free street parking fairly easy to find.  During peak (12-3pm) may be a farther walk.\n\n7. Atmosphere - Big open space. Loft-style. I love the modern layout and the architectural\n\n8. Music - they play from barista's ipod hasn't been consistent. Usually not top 40's but I've heard hip-hop, r&b, oldies, to indie. Only thing is, sometimes they play it a tad too loud.\n\n9. People watching - Given the Mission district, there's an abundance of interesting subjects to spy on, uh, no creeper status though.  Also, heavy foot traffic at the entrance keeps me entertained when I get bored of my work.  Diverse crowd.  I love picking out the artsy hipsters to the med students to the environmentalists.\n\nThis about sums up what entails my perfect coffee shop, which Coffee Bar has done a fine job to meet.

Although it was a bit chilly, I was tempted to sit outside - it looked very inviting. I don't think my friends were particularly excited about sitting outside, so scratch that idea. \n\nAfter perusing the menu and ordering at the counter, we went upstairs to find a seat. The place looks like a giant loft because, well, it is. We found one small table in the middle of the room and borrowed a third chair. A girl working on her laptop has no problem surrendering the extra chair, as she was not expecting company. As a matter of fact, no one was. Everyone was typing away on their laptops, and most people had their headphones on. \"Don't bother me, I am typing.\" The three of us were the only people actually talking at Coffee Bar (I am not exaggerating). In fact, I believe the talking earned us a few dirty looks from the patrons. Sorry guys, it's NOT a library. \n\nMy friends ordered lattes which looked pretty, dusted with something in a shape of a heart. My regular coffee was very strong, but I wasn't excited that I had to carry my cup down the stairs to get some milk and sugar. Why wouldn't they put a milk/sugar/napkin station upstairs, where the majority of people sit? Did they need that space for yet another outlet for yet another laptop? \n\nThe gingerbread muffin I ordered was actually pretty good. It was very moist and not excessively sweet. I also made the mistake of ordering a bowl of oatmeal. When they say a bowl, they mean a bowl. It's a lot more oatmeal than an average person could eat. If you're not a big eater, I'd recommend ordering a cup. The oatmeal itself was pretty good, with dried cranberries and brown sugar. \n\nI almost feel bad giving Coffee Bar only three stars, but I feel like I have to. I have no problem with the Coffee part; it's the Bar part that's the problem. The place has a very cold and uninviting feel, not because of the industrial look or because of the mispositioned milk and sugar station, but because of the patrons. A bunch of people staring intently into the neon glow of their Macbooks does not exactly scream \"come on in, neighbor!\" \n\n4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the ambiance.", "author": "Yan G."}

I just needed a cup of coffee to finish my what turned out to be a 12 hr work day. I walked up to the brick building and into their double height ceiling space. It was a cold day but the sun was out and washed through the huge windows that covered about 80% of their wall. I love bright spaces, especially for a work environment. \n\nThe coffee bar sat at floor level with their menu written on brown paper at the upper right corner of the space. There were a few steps to get to the space that was 5' off ground level where all the laptops lived and their operators strongly focused on it with headphones jammed in each ear. The little bar area for the laptop users lined along the edge of the 2nd floor--it was like a barricade of soldiers protecting those dining/studying behind them.\n\nThey also had a special menu for the day's special drips. I was pleasantly surprised to see vietnamese coffee as one of their two specials. i was tempted to order it, but i decided against it and ordered their ice coffee. staff was very friendly and outgoing. i got my coffee and walked out sniffing it's intoxicating aroma. the coffee was alright, but i dont think i've acquired the taste of most coffees yet. it did it's job and i got through the day.\n\nthis was probably one of the first times i've felt like i'm missing on not living in the city.

Wide industrial space, wood slab seating- although it has a nice flowery patio out front for sunny, non-shitty days (not today.)

I like the atmosphere which one could describe as urban, lofty or industrial.  It seems to be frequented by SF web folk (or SF is populated with mainly web folk), which is a welcome change from New York's robust lack of any real coherence of a tech/web community.  It's comforting to over hear people's conversions at adjacent tables about wireframing and UX and conversion funnels (sorry for eavesdropping).  One time a guy sat next to me and conducted a noisy business lunch with an acquaintance of his.  Turned out the guy was Tim Ferriss.

There's a paucity of plugs so if you bring a power strip you're sure to make friends.  Sandwich/salad combos there are decent and a great deal.

When planning our reception we knew we wanted a three things 1) a taco truck  2) an outdoor patio space and 3) a casual but modern atmosphere. Coffee Bar fit the bill! \n\nWe met and worked with Nathan Downs, the Events and Development Manager, who was very laid back and receptive to our ideas. He assured us Coffee Bar would be happy to accommodate our party and bring our vision to life! And honestly, he did just that. Planning was a breeze. We told him what we wanted in terms of food, beverage and decor and, after discussing our budget, etc., he made it happen.\n\nMost notably, Nathan really rose the occasion when, a couple of weeks prior to the event we learned that on the night of our wedding there would be an art festival in the street outside Coffee Bar with 400 people likely wanting to eat tacos from our taco truck...he problem solved ways to prevent party crashers and even went so far as to set up a decoy taco stand on the corner where we could re-direct non-wedding guests to fill up on tacos! Genius. Nathan also put together a gorgeous menu of appetizers and salads to supplement the taco truck fare, and he did a fabulous job of taking care of all the details of the day, all while maintaining a relaxed attitude. As the bride, I honestly didn't have to think about and/or deal with a single thing at the reception because Nathan was on it. Service from other Coffee Bar staff was also excellent and guests were able to have all the complimentary tea and coffee they liked. \n\nI'm fairly certain Coffee Bar couldn't really give our wedding rave reviews as, with most weddings, it ended in a drunken mess (hopefully we weren't too obnoxious).

The Atrani sandwich is a personal favorite of mine: prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, basil, and balsamic vinegar on a warm & fluffy roll. The sandwich is light and tasty and comes with a nice side salad. Overall a very satisfying lunch.\n\nThe coffee here is also pretty good, although the restaurant does not have as extensive a selection of drinks as its name would suggest. However, Coffee Bar does earn bonus points for serving Dynamo donuts, the $3-a-piece greasy pieces of heaven that are so unbelievably delicious that you'll find them on countless SF-best lists (including 7x7's 100 foods you must try before you die). I had the orange ginger donut and it was fantastic. I have yet to try the bacon maple apple, salted caramel and spiced chocolate donuts, but those are definitely next on my list of things to try!\n\nAs for the intangibles, service is pretty good, there is a lot of space to eat/work/chat with friends upstairs and in the outside patio, and prices are reasonable.\n\nAll in all, I give Coffee Bar a B+.

There's not much around except for Circolo, Whisper and William Sonoma's corporate offices yet ironically, parking in the area (from what I can gather in my mid-week visit) is a b***h. Nonetheless, the place is worth the trek out. \n\nFirst off, the place has a streetside front patio with ample seating. On that particular sunny day, it was hard to resist sitting outside at least for a minute. Second, the place is huge and offers a variety of seating that can accommodate practically every arrangement / group size. It was slammed at 2pm on a Wednesday (what was up with that?), but I managed to score a small table that faced the all-window front of the cafe/restaurant. It was cool to get my \"work\" done while at the same time looking out at the peaks of warehouse smoke stacks and then seeing the fog rolling in over the hills even further beyond. That and it has free WIFI. Oddly enough, the stark neighborhood and feel of the place made me appreciate the stuff I was doing and the time I was wasting away. \n\nI had a large ice tea and their potato soup. The soup was great and a promising sign that the rest of the menu could also be well executed. The tea was alright but be warned, there are no free or discount refills... you gotta pay full price if you're going for seconds. As for price, it's averagely SF - meaning I think it could probably burn a hole through your wallet if you get carried away ordering. \n\nOverall, I thought it was time well spent and definitely a venue I will be checking in on again!", "author": "Jonny Bobby G."}

I'm old and boring, and I don't have a mac, skinny jeans, or jersey knit leggings, so it's really not the place for me.", "author": "Rebecca H."}

Seating is upstairs [wheelchair accessible!] and outside too. Free wireless. Lots of outlets along the wall. Big and small tables, plus a few couches. During the day, great natural lighting. At night, not so much. Studying at Coffee Bar in the evening is a strain on the eyes if you're not seated at the large table on the far left corner. I've not yet tried Coffee Bar's food [sandwiches and salads], but the iced tea and coffee are great. For coffee enthusiasts who might be interested in this tidbit, they serve Clover coffee. The wine and beer in the evenings puts the \"Bar\" in \"Coffee Bar.\" \n\nGreat Thursday/Friday spot! From 6 in the evening, delicious plates are served by Radio Africa & Kitchen [http://radioafricakitchen.com/], a nomadic restaurant. Chef Eskender Aseged often brings the dishes from the kitchen directly to your table himself, and there's a DJ mixing up some African music for the evening. The edamame hummus with green olive oil is a MUST TRY! \n\nLove is patient and forgiving. With an occasional missed order or a forgotten drink [they are totally wonderful and make up for it when they realize it], I am still forgiving and absolutely in love with this place and the people who work here. The owners are very cool - warm and inviting faces whenever I stop in. Everyone else working here is great too [*cough* eye candy *cough*]. The patrons sharing the space are friendly too. Aside from being a little closer to where I live [it's ~13 miles round trip] and longer hours [although their closing hours aren't too strict], it doesn't get better than this. \n\nCoffee Bar is my latest great find, and while I would like to keep it a secret, I'm all about sharing too.

It takes both its coffee and locally-sourced food very seriously, in that manner typical of SF gourmet establishments--so the attitude is familiar, but its benefits are clearly spelled out in the food and drink.  I went in the morning, so I'll reserve comment on the boozy goods for a later visit.\n\nI had a bacon-chive gougere (from Patisserie Phillipe on Townsend) and a latte:  the gougere had the appropriate contrast of soft and crisp textures and a complex richness that seemed more worthwhile than overindulgent (the small size helped).  I don't normally drink coffee (!), but seeing the serious equipment behind the bar (Clover, exotic espresso machine) I took a chance.  The latte had no trace of bitterness, sugar was unnecessary.  I'm no coffee expert, but this was several steps beyond the Starbucks down the street.\n\nCoffee Bar's particular seriousness of intent has been more common to date in restaurants, and it's welcome in a neighborhood (my neighborhood!) coffee shop/boozery.  That said, if SF restaurants are temples to food, then SF bars and coffee shops are temples to their guests:  their focus is more on creating social spaces than any particular beverage of choice.\n\nCoffee Bar hasn't done poorly there, but they do have some work to do for their ambiance to match their food and drink.  The concrete and steel industrial space is large and welcoming, but comes off a little spartan, especially on a rainy day with few customers.  I love minimalism as much as the next loft-dwelling yupster, but a bit more color, a bit more artwork, and a few more customers would go a long way towards making this cafe/bar feel less like a church/museum.

The patrons, however, can be a bit ridiculous with the all the laptops and cheesiness... for instance, some guy in line behind me referred to a ham sandwich as a \"ham sando\"... come on, does it make you feel cool to call a sandwich a \"sando\", WTH man?

The menu sounded fabulous and it is only a 5 min drive away from my house.  I thought I should try it.\n\nAs soon as we walked in we noticed the fabulous jazz music and a very chic warehouse feel.  It was very modern SOMA vibes entering the Mission.  As soon as we sat down we didn't really like how far the tables were between us.  It wasn't til we started eating we noticed that there were paper napkins and the cutlery wasn't very nice.  The last  entree was prime rib and the knives weren't particularly good for cutting.\n\nOn the food side of it.  We were very impressed with Alex Marsh's cuisine.  It was all very small plates and we could've eaten more.  We hope he opens up a restaurant with regular entrees.  The wine pairings on part of Coffee Bar were spectacular.\n\nFirst course.\n\nAvocado Gazpacho\nDungeness Crab and Tomato\n\nIt was very refreshing and delicious.\n\nSecond Course\n\nWinter Citrus Salad with crab, mache, and coriander fried meyer lemons\n\nThe meyer lemons were the best part of that salad and over it amazing.\n\nThird Course\n\nSpring roll with crab & minced bacon, cucumber, pickled carrot, and fava and a creme creme fraiche sauce\n\nThis one was my least favorite.  I thought it was bland and smokey but none the less I still consumed it as it was tasty.\n\nFourth Course\n\nWhite Corn Polenta \nArtichoke and crab spiced with ol' bay\n\nThis was by far my favorite after the next course.  I love white corn polenta and artichoke.  I could've eaten 3 bowls of this.\n\nThe Fifth course was prime rib, crab sauce, and collard greens.  The prime rib was really small.  I was also wondering if they are supposed to leave the fat on.  We both had to take out this big white chunk that was not very delightful to look at when the plate was empty.\n\nDessert were this amazingly fresh donut holes with an apricot sauce.\n\nMy favorite wine was the Semillon.  During the pairing I had a really nice Prosecco and Pinot Noir at the end from Russian River Valley.  \n\nFor dessert a very nice Sancerres.\n\nMy neighbor was still hungry after spending so much money and had to get a slice of pizza on 22nd.  \n\nIt was a very nice meal.  I would suggest the chef do it else where and add larger portions.  I like the fact that it felt like an Italian style meal in regards to length.  It took us 2.5 hrs and I think that's how a nice dinner should be enjoyed.", "author": "Sabrina A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-05-13", "description": "I am a coffee (and coffeehouse) snob. As a friend from Chicago who called me yesterday noted, I'm almost always in a cafe when he calls me. \n\nToday I have been working all afternoon from Coffee Bar and it is rapidly going to be one of my favorite cafes in the city, especially for productive afternoons working or meeting with people. My other favorite cafes - Ritual Roasters on Valencia and Blue Bottle Cafe on Mint have their appeal (though Blue Bottle which I think has by far the best coffee in the city and perhaps in the country, doesn't have wifi), Coffee Bar is probably the best of the three for being productive and especially for business meetings. \n\nI don't get the complaints of some Yelpers about the coffee or the prices - yes, these are not bargain prices, but neither are they particularly high (and the $3 for a Clover cup of coffee prepared quite well is actually a bargain). I had a cappuccino with a Madeline when I first got here - both were excellent and then now I'm enjoying a magnificent Clover coffee and one of their great small plates (anchovies over shaved fennel and oranges - a perfect afternoon light meal). \n\nWhen I see a new cafe beyond the coffee which is of course key, a personal measure of a place is the size of the tables. Small, traditional \"cafe\" tables usually create a space with few people sharing tables, are not conducive to laptop use or spreading out and working. In contrast a cafe with larger tables, easily shared, and with one or more great  big group tables is a cafe whih is designed with working in mind. And further, a cafe with tables than physically can accomodate groups is a cafe where people are that much more likely to talk with each other. \n\nCoffee Bar has by far the best and largest selection of shareable group tables I've seen in a very very long time. Three large tables each designed to easily accomodate 8-12 people around them on the large, comfortable benches, as well as a large couch seating area and a row of large tables along another wall which can easily also accommodate multiple groups. Plus two large bars along the edge of the balcony which are well designed for individuals with laptops to use and work at. \n\nOverall a space that also due to the very high ceilings is extremely well suited for groups to work together, while also working very well for individuals. Unlike Ritual Roasters which often suffers from a lack of available tables and tends to be very loud due to the relatively small space and cramped layout, Coffee Bar's two levels plus outside space (and I think a further private room) make for a much quieter space where multiple groups can be talking and working at nearby tables and I can still hear myself think, could even take a phone call if I needed to. \n\nIn terms of the crowd Coffee Bar seems to appeal to a slightly older crowd (I'm sure the wine and beer help here, as well as the location). I would guess that most of the people in the space a the moment (about 40 people or so) are in their mid-30's. A professional and graduate student crowd vs. the more hipster crowd at Ritual Roasters. And I don't know how the crowd changes on the weekends, but at the moment at least there are a lot of women working in groups or by themselves and about a 50/50 ratio of men to women.\n\nI don't live near Potrero Hill (I live in Noe Valley) but Coffee Bar is great enough that I fully plan on shifting my patterns to work here many afternoons.", "author": "Shannon C."}

In the evening, the space takes on a certain quiet San Francisco urban sexiness and becomes a fantastic place for a glass of wine, or even an intimate conversational dinner if it's a Thursday or Friday (when the Radio Africa Kitchen prepares a menu). It's a beautiful open loft space with abundant natural light, seating above and bar below.  There are plenty of large tables, but the wonderful long bars - made from the same glossy birch and with ample outlets underneath - are my favorite place to sit, looking down below to coffee preparation.  I adore the oversized prints of the Oakland ports, which only add to my Seattle nostalgia when I'm here.\n\nThe real source of my nostalgia (and, after all, the point of the bar), however, is the coffee, which is simply fantastic.  Forced to keep score, I'd say on an average day it's just below Blue Bottle and Four Barrel, and just above Ritual for my taste.  I've had Mr. Espresso elsewhere, but no where else seems to get it nearly as good as Coffee Bar.  This makes some sense in light of one of the owners also being a Mr. Espresso owner.  But honestly: it's *so much better* than Mr. Espresso coffee I've had at other cafes around town that I'm sort of amazed that it's the same stuff.  On a good day, their Neapolitan blend produces a cup of something that makes me immensely grateful for being alive, down to the very last sip.\n\nI tend not to order off of the lunch menu since it doesn't excite me much; the food seems well-prepared, just a bit unimaginative, but sometimes simple and well-prepared is something to be grateful for, especially when the ingredients are of high-quality (which they are).  I've tried a few of the small plates in the evening with a glass of wine (the artichokes, the tuna with cannellini beans); both were good, a better option than the lunch fare if you tire (as I do) of salads, soups, and sandwiches that you could make at home for less than half the cost.  The real food treat here, though, is the Radio Africa Kitchen, which I highly recommend checking out.", "author": "Lulu W."}

We love the lighting, high ceilings and clover coffee here. They also have seating outside, so, if the weather is nice, its fantastic. However, if there is too much sun, they have no umbrellas or anything.\n\nI always get a coffee from their \"clover\" machine. A pretty hefty cup is $3 and you choose from a selection of about 4 beans. I never feel rushed at Coffee Bar (if I can get a seat).

First off, the space is incredible. Take a moment to look around and appreciate the tiny little touches that add character to the place. Secondly, they utilize everything they got. They're an amazing cafe by day and transform into the Radio Africa Kitchen at night (Thurs and Fri only). I've heard a few different people throw private parties there and I think that's a fantastic idea. I'm just searching for a reason to reserve the space now. \n\nTips: Lattes and cappuccinos are perfection (don't ask for flavored syrup!). If you're hungry, get the turkey sandwich. If you're not hungry, grab one of those little blueberry thingamajigs. They are damn tasty! \n\nThe word is out and now it's always crowded.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-08-24", "description": "It pains me to write this but my love affair with Coffee Bar as the go-to place for home-based workaholics needing a daily escape to eat, drink, work, meet colleagues and socialize has come to an end. Yes,  I will miss the slightly edgy, urban, frenetic atmosphere that has well suited my mild ADD for months (or has it been years?), but alas, I can't patronize an establishment where my business means so little. Everyone has their tipping point. Mine wasn't the sudden policy change from low cost to full price refills on drinks, or the constant wireless access issues, or the oft rude baristas who'd sneer skeptically when asked to make up for the frequent-buyer-card stamp they'd overlooked or mention that your lunch order had come out wrong--no, I've accepted these customer faux pas as the standard operating procedure that comes with a business recognizing that they have you hooked and that you're bound to come back no matter what they throw your way. However, today the spell was broken: I came in mid-day and could find nowhere \"legal\" to sit. One staff person, seeing my dilemma and my computer, invited me to use one of the several coveted (yet empty) \"no-computers-during-lunch\" tables. I ordered my lunch and got down to work. Just as I settled in, another staff person approached and asked me to relocate, wagging his finger voraciously at the sign on the table (as if I should know better) while claiming he didn't make the rules. I explained that I'd been kindly invited to use the table by his colleague as there was no place else to sit. He persisted (grumbling under his breath a question about whether the invitation had come from \"kitchen staff\"-- note-- I won't even go into the blatant classism associated with that question); I mentioned the large amount of money I'd dropped on the place daily, and he invited me to spend my money elsewhere. My view: any self respecting business person that could muster even the smallest amount of appreciation for paying customers (regular or not) would simply, and graciously, have sucked it up, apologized for the inconvenience, and dealt with his frustration about exceptions to rules internally and behind the scenes at the next staff meeting.  \n\nSo, I figure now is a good time to take this guy up on his offer.  If the Coffee Bar people want to find me  (which I am sure they don't), at least in the short term, they can check out the not-quite-so-hip and politically incorrect Starbucks across the street where the baristas couldn't be nicer, there are plenty of comfy seats. AC outlets are plentiful, the wireless almost never goes down, I can get hot or cold drinks any way I want them for half the price of CB with close-to-free refills, the temperature is pleasant and constant, and a steady jazz rhythm plays at a reasonable volume to keep me entertained and awake. It is really too bad that a successful business can get so into itself that it stops seeing its paying customers as its greatest asset.", "author": "Tori S."}

Two characteristics, however, prevent me from giving it five stars: (1) drafty and (2) can get crowded pretty quickly. \n\nAs to the laptop outlets, they're all over the place.  They might as well have a statute out front with the inscription, \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning for electricity.\"  \n\nThere are huge windows that allow a flood of light in.  As someone who is often stuck indoors, the natural light makes me feel like I'm outdoors.  There's nothing wrong with pretending, right? \n\nThird, the people and coffee are good.  That's a plus. \n\nBut as to my concerns, they're admittedly not Coffee Bar's fault.  First off, the place is like a cold-blooded animal: if it's cold outside, it's cooler inside; and I assume that if it's warm outside, the same effect holds.  No big deal.  Just a warning for folks to bring their fleece.  Second, perhaps as a byproduct of the place's success, the place gets crowded quickly.  Was here on a Monday morning, and the place was pretty crowded by 9:30 a.m.  There were still spots, but get here early.  \n\nSolid place.  I'll be back.", "author": "Marc P."}

Walking in was like stepping into an Apple Store/Ikea/coffee shop//loft apartment with the soaring ceilings, white walls, blonde wood tables, bright light and multiple levels.  Frankly I was stunned they served wine... It seems that most places that serve alcohol keep the lights low.  We joked that they should put a dimmer on that light bulb sculpture on the wall.  I love the couple of big plants that soften it up (maybe they keep the lights up for the plants!)\n\nThe staff was very friendly and eager to help, maybe too much- it felt like they didn't quite have the confidence yet for their new place.  The wine list is nice- good selection by the glass and bottle.  I love when a place offers more than one bubbly by the glass!  I had an excellent Roederer Estate sparkling Rose which tasted better after sitting out for 20 minutes (coolers a tad cold for wine...)  \n\nI love the neighborhood and that place wasn't crazy full of the obnoxious wine bar crowd (I work near District and never go because I dislike that type of crowd).  It's close to some awesome restaurants (slow club, universal cafe, blowfish sushi) and you can always find parking. \n\nOne thing about this place was that all the patrons appeared to be there for a purpose, like they were conducting important work.

Let's talk about Coffee Bar.\n \nIt's obvious that there's something about this place seeing that I'm not an active Yelper, and I'm begrudgingly writing a review.  \n \nBut it's that awesome of a place.  I like the simplicity of the layout and design.  I'm all about high ceilings and space, so this place is perfect.  There's also massive amounts of sunlight that come through the industrial windows during the late afternoon.  \n\nIf they have good coffee, WINE, BEER, food, FREE wifi, good music...um, could you ask for anything more? I've only had coffee & tea but the food seems good too.  The owners are extremely friendly.  I'm definitely coming back...and I guess I can share it with everyone else.  And that about finishes my yearly Yelp review quota. \n \n \n**It's not really on Bryant Street; it's more like on Mariposa and Florida.

And, don't you hate it when all of those individual people take up an entire 4-person table with just them and their laptop?  Yeah, me too.\n\nMy buddy and I went to Coffee Bar today for lunch.  I'd never been there before, and it looked pretty cool.  The menu was small, but had some very creative sandwiches and salads.  I had the turkey sandwich on wheat, and we split the anchovy/fennel salad.\n\nThe salad was really good!  And, it was definitely big enough for two people.\n\nThe sandwich, however, was a joke.  Even if it had had fresh bread, the TWO thin slices of turkey, coupled with the ONE romaine leaf and the TWO TINY slices of roma tomato and tiny bit of avocado made this the weakest sandwich I'd had in quite a while. \n\nI mean, seriously, do you expect me to just fill up on the stale bread and not notice the lack of meat?  Plus, what about some condiments?  It was like they sprayed on a thin layer of mayo and mustard, and then tried to scrape it all back off.  \n\nPlus, for two sandwiches, a salad, and two drinks, it was over $29!  That's quite a bill for a very lackluster lunch.  \n\nOutside of the food, the place has a cool, industrial vibe.  And, the guy working the register and delivering the plates was pretty nice and friendly.  But, the place (today) was a haven for people with laptops.  So, while there was probably room for 50 people in the whole place, most laptoppers hogged a whole table for themselves.\n\nThere oughta be a rule that if you are by yourself and the restaurant/cafe is crowded, you should sit with another single person at a 4-top.

You have really high hopes for it and your desire to see the place/relationship succeed depends on how well you can make yourself look the other way and ignore the annoying traits, and on how persistent you are in telling yourself about all the amazing and wonderful and innovative things they bring into your life. \n\nCoffee Bar is amazing. The space itself is beautiful! The coffee they serve is wonderful, both the espresso and their Clover flavors are to die for. The tea brand and selection is fantastic.. In short, their coffee selection and preparation and experience are all on par with the best in the city. There is a huge amount of seating, parking is easy to find nearby, there are plenty of power outlets, and the staff is helpful with questions (see my comments on their wine selection later). In other words, as far as being a coffee shop, Coffee Bar gets six stars.\n\nBut I dock two of the six stars for the transformation that happens in the evening hours. In the evenings it becomes impossible to enjoy as much as in the daytime because the music seems to be a few decibels too loud; the place itself becomes very noisy when all the voices, the music, and the industrial, concrete feel coalesce into an orgy of reflected sounds that make holding a conversation harder than it needs to be. \n\nBut. the wine selections consists of vineyards and varietals that I have never heard of before and that has never disappointed me. However the food menu is extraordinarily yuppie and I feel like it could use some more reasonable options, especially when I work from home from here for a couple of hours in the afternoon and would like to get something to eat. \n\nThe DJ that I've seen a few times on the weekend afternoons is a nice touch, though.", "author": "Joe K."}

Outdoor seating is a huge plus, there are so few places in SF which provide comfortable not-on-the-sidewalk-or-in-the-middle-of-the-street tables.\n\nDrink menu is comprehensive, with both pick-me-up and mellow-me down options to suit your need or addiction.  I went with a latte which was very smooth and well balanced.  All too often many baristas either go overboard on the milk or get so absorbed in designing some Rorschach froth art they forget someones going to drink it in about 2 seconds.  \n\nSat at the little bar on the side of the counter, which was a great spot for watching preparation and just general comings and goings.  Upstairs seating looked very casual as well, with some spots looking down into the entry and out the huge glass wall.\n\nWhy go to Coffee Bar instead of the Starbucks across the street?  Simple..this place has SOUL.  You feel connected to the rest of the world in a way that Starbucks and Peets just can't reproduce.  \n\nGood drinks, mellow crowd and supporting a local business.  What more could you ask? Drink early and drink often...", "author": "Jason M."}

They just have to get the whole feel right;  People come to coffee bars to talk to friends, study, and surf the net (work).   This is not the ideal place to meet with people, unless sitting out on he patio.  The MUSIC is way too loud.  Yes, I'm old, but not old enough to turn down my hearing aid...so you just can't really read anything important without 'house music' bumping in your head.   The tables are also close enough, that you really can't talk without the person sitting next to you also involved in the conversation.   Strike 3, the parking.  Unless you work for MUNI or live in the area, good luck.  \n\nOh, the coffee and food are great.

Things like free-wifi, good food made to order, baristas who know how to pull a decent shot, a large, open space with plenty of natural light, beer/wine in the evening, etc. When I moved down to SF, I was surprised to find that these traits were pretty much impossible to find in a local cafe. That is, until coffee bar came around. \n\nI was thanking one of the owners the other day for creating such a great cafe in San Francisco and remarked on its similarities to my favorites in Seattle. It turns out that Seattle cafes were the inspiration for coffee bar, and in particular, Victrola. It's nice to see I'm not the only one who missed Seattle cafes down here! \n\nMy only complaint is that they use Mr Coffee espresso. If they switched to something lighter like blue bottle, stumptown or zoka, it'd be perfect.", "author": "matt m."}

Hours of my homework which would otherwise go undone until night, forcing me to stay up until my class time because I can't focus in my own cluttered desk and would rather spend money to buy a coffee (which I'm not keen on in general) as an excuse for me to take up approximately a 1 foot circumference of study space on their table. (Commence scathing comments from the internet criticizing why I spend money foolishly and emphasizing the importance of organization. Thanks, mom.). \n\nSo I thank you, Coffee Bar, for being my study space, and making my eyes slightly less bloodshot. I love you almost as much as I love sleep.\n\nAlso: One of the baristas was really nice.

Great cappuccino: dark, rich espresso, nice crema, properly sized cup (not huge). Friendly, attentive staff. \n\nMy only knock is that if you're really a \"coffee bar\", you should have sugar _on the bar_ as you would find in any proper cafe in Europe. Not all the condiments, just sugar, so that if I sit at the bar (as I did) and they slide my coffee down in front of me (as they did), I don't then have to get up and make my way over to the \"condiment bar\" just for a packet of sugar. It might sound like a minor point, but it puts a minor dent in the coffee bar experience. Going to the condiment bar is always a bit of a downer; makes me feel like Starbucks. Get a few proper sugar boats. \n\nOtherwise, I like the space and the feel, minus the assh**e on his iPhone speakerphone in line -- so lame. Good stuff.

I believe in second chances but they definitely need a little bit of an overhaul.  They need to work on first having more regular hours.  I like that they claim to be open late, but if they don't deliver like they did last time (they kicked us out at 10 even though they claimed to be open till 11 on the phone), it leaves a lot of customers (like myself) confused and frankly, disappointed!\n\nTheir coffee is excellent (a good deal if you ask me - it has enough caffeine in it to keep you wired for a whole week - you never have to sleep)! Their wine menu is decent.  But I get the feeling they don't know how to pull off both.  At this point they seem more like a coffee shop that just so happens to serve wine (kind of like Nook on Hyde).  Sugar Lounge on Sutter manages to pull of both quite well.  I believe that this place would be more attractive to me if they had decided how to pull off both BEFORE they opened.  \n\nThis place definitely has some potential - it's a beautiful space, their staff is friendly, and their coffee is EXCELLENT, their pastries are a nice touch (LOVE the donut holes!) ... but they do need a little bit of work, and a little more thought put into their concept wouldn't hurt either.

Since there were no cars parked at the end of Miraposa and Florida. I parked closer to the Coffee Bar than Starbucks. Whatever! I read somewhere that they had decent coffee. No line. Great. I'll be back on my way in a few. \n\nThe selection on the board was too much for me to process before I've been caffeinated, so I just ordered a Latte. It took a few minutes (longer that it takes when the coffee chains were backed up), but definitely worth the wait. Who am I kidding? I would have waited 10 minutes for a latte like this. It was beautiful. The perfect little back and forth swirl. I took a sip before I added anything and had to stop in my tracks. OMG! It tasted even better than it looked!

So Joe and I hit coffee bar, a small yet trendy cafe located somewhere in between Potrero and the Mission in rather industrial setting. Outside in the sunny patio there are a few tables and chairs where we found a smattering of locals enjoying a quick coffee/ meal during their lunch break. Inside the cafe is industrial as well- with a modern twist- there is an upstairs area too, but the counter and food ordering station is downstairs near the entrance. We ordered some delicious sounding vegetarian dishes- myself going for the butternut and chard soup while Joe opted for the tomato and roasted pepper sandwich. I also ordered a latte, Joe decidingly swearing off coffee for the afternoon (yeah right). The coffee came out first, a beautiful creation indeed made from Mr Espresso beans, keeping the same style of milk froth swirling artistry as my two other coffee producing favorites (aka Blue Bottle and Ritual). And what's more is that the taste lived up to the look. Our food arrived soon after, the soup was not what I expected in the least. Normally when I think of butternut squash soup, a puree comes in mind. However this soup had a clear and fragrant broth filled with chunks of sweet squash, carrots, and chard. Joe's sandwich was also a hit, served alongside a deliciously dressed green salad. All throughout the meal, Joe was eyeing my latte, and by the end of it decided to get an espresso (actually to be completely correct, a macchiato) for himself. And I was even more delighted to find that he had ordered two slices of a blueberry bread (they serve pastries from Patisserie Phillipe) as an accompaniment. What a great way to sop up the last bit of frothed milk in my nearly empty cup!\nMy only complaint is that the prices are a bit steep, but then again this is San Francisco, so it's practically a given.", "author": "Kate A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-01-22", "description": "My expectations and first impressions of Coffee Bar were in the 5 star range but after going a few times I have to put my heart in check and speak straight from the mind. I can't give it the 5 stars I want to--not yet. I give it 3 stars with lots of room to grow. \n\nCoffee Bar has a lot going for it. The coffee is top quality, food is decent and the space is luxuriously airy. The ambiance is modern and bare, strong and simple. The space makes me feel confident and hopeful in that way that only high ceilings, giant windows, and designerly flair can.\n\nBut Coffee Bar is very young and has a long way to go to reach its potential. While the coffee is nice and fancy in that Blue Bottle way, they have gotten someone in my party's order wrong almost every time. An extra hot latte was served tepid, a latte came instead of a mocha, orders were forgotten and delayed... that kind of inconsistency could push me into into the warm, welcoming arms of the green mermaid.\n\nThe food is made from quality ingredients but the minimalism of the decor carries over a bit too much onto the menu. For the highish-for-what-you're-getting prices a salad could be more exciting than organic baby greens and olive oil. I can make that at home. Give me something I can't find elsewhere.\n\nMy final gripe is the awkward metamorphosis that takes place at sundown. Coffee Bar transforms from a comfortable place to sit and read or chat over coffee into a wine bar with thumpy-bumpy music and a different menu. I'm not generally against the thumping and the bumping--it has it's place--but its a terrible characteristic of a cafe.\n\nSo what does Coffee bar want to be anyway, a cafe or a bar? The identity crisis can't be good for business. If I were a fancy consultant I would say: \"Pick one business model, make it work, then think about expanding. Quit shooting yourself in both feet by cultivating two different businesses under the same roof.\" (End digression)\n\nSo 5 first impression stars minus a faulty coffee service star and another for the simplistic menu and identity crisis. That leaves us with 3 very warm, constructive and hopeful stars. I hope Coffee Bar earns back the other two.", "author": "Sean D."}

I'm not sure if I like it better than ritual, but maybe. I'm more of a medium to light roast kind of espresso drinker, so the ritual has an edge there, but the espresso here has a much bigger body and a bolder flavor. The sandwich I ate was great. The turkey, avacado and mustard all blended nicely together. The toasted sourdough was great too. The salad that came with the sandwich was light and tasty as well.

I wanted to order one of everything to try, but after waffling about for a while I finally just got a cappuccino because a) it seemed like the easiest point of comparison (like how, whenever I try a new Thai place, whatever else I order, I get pad thai too despite the fact that I don't particularly love pad thai), b) it didn't force me to choose between the several amazing-sounding Clover coffees, and c) I was in need of serious caffeine.\n\nIt was excellent.

Local residents seem to populate the place, most of which are likely artists from the live-work lofts in the area. That makes sense because this cafe feels like an artist's loft. It generates a warm, sophisticated, \"arty\" feeling which is complete with magazines for browsing like ArtForum and Dwell. I walked in, ordered a cafe au lait, grabbed an ArtForum to peruse and sat on a couch in the sun like a cat. Heaven in SF.

The baristas, in addition to being experts, are all very friendly (despite being far cooler than you, which isn't their fault).\n\nThe space itself is (industrially) beautiful.   High ceilings and two-level seating, cool lighting fixtures and huge prints in arched window frames.  Lots of bar space (perfectly designed with outlets underneath) for lone laptop-luggers and plenty of tables of different sizes.  I also like the energy here, though I admit you can get blinded sometimes by the sea of Mac zombies (not hating, as I'm one of them).\n\nThe cafe food is tasty but overpriced; there's also a dinner menu on Thursdays and Fridays courtesy of Radio Africa Kitchen, though I've yet to try it.

This place drips of pretentiousness, from the layout of the floor plan to the idiotic attitude exuded by the employees.\n\nI wanted to like this place but it just wasn't possible. The food is okay, not great. The coffee is good but definitely not worth the abuse. \n\nHere's the deal, I ordered lunch (a lunch special--grilled sandwich) for take out. The attitude began. First, the grumpy cashier then the kitchen \"runner\" (I can't call him a waiter since all he did was deliver food and didn't take orders or help in anyway). My order was placed just before a large line formed therefore I thought that I was \"safe\" from having to wait long for my food. In and out with room to spare, I thought. Nope, I began to question the \"runner\" when a person who had ordered three people after me got his plate (of the same sandwich) before me. Okay, a mix up. I stopped the \"runner\" and asked if he had another order for the sandwich with my name on it in the back. He half acknowledged me and mumbled something about it coming up next. Okay great! Three more deliveries later (including a coworker who ordered after me) and still no sandwich! You've got to be kidding me. So, I stopped the \"runner\" again and inquired. This time I got a full rebuff! I admit I was P.O.'d at this point but I didn't yell at him or anything. He replied with \"I don't know!\" and \"Thanks for your patience!\" in the most sarcastic tone he could muster! \n\nUnbelievable, you work in a coffee house for god's sake!

The address is deceiving, Coffee Bar is actually on the corner of Florida and Mariposa, kitty-corner from Circolo.  It has been under construction for 6 months or so, and they've really done a nice job with the place.\n\nI can't give a detailed food review yet, as I've only had coffee there, but the coffee is quite good.  And the attitude of the people there is great! Friendly, proud of their coffee and food, they make you feel very welcome.  Contrast this to a lot of coffee places where you're treated like you're yuppie scum just because you can afford a $3 coffee by a barrista who would rather be on the dole than actually working for a living.  But I digress.\n\nLet's talk about the space:  There is a large outdoor garden in the front, probably a bit larger than Atlas's back yard; but it is open on 3 sides and feels very big and not like you're in an urban pit.\n\nThe decor inside is industrial chic, playing homage to the neighborhood with a huge photo mural (framed like a set of windows) of the muni bus yards a block away.  There are other large photo murals of the shipyards and other industrial settings in SF.\n\nThe layout is great; with plenty of room so you don't feel cramped, but done in a way where you don't feel like you're in isolation either.\n\nThe steel and concrete space felt surprisingly cozy; reminds me of Slow Club (also down the street).  \n\nCoffee Bar is located in the heart of NEMIZ, the North-East Mission Industrial Zone, and it's great to see how they've integrated themselves into the neighborhood.\n\nUPDATE: I've been there several times now, and every time the coffee is great, and the staff is really nice.\n\nThe food looked good, I'll be sure to update this review after I eat there a couple times.", "author": "Rusty H."}

You can read, write, work online, do everything with relaxation and serenity.  Lastly, the coffee is delicious.

They are a cross between a muffin and donut and are coated with sugar sprinkles, a fabulous accompaniment to the flawless coffee.  If I lived nearby, it would be a no-brainer to make this venue a regular haunt.", "author": "Dee C."}

The updated space is really nice, leather couches and tables upstairs, a share table that seats 12, a private room for small meetings. The coffee is great. It's Mr. Espresso (the coffee of choice of Chez Panisse), they offer two different roasts, and a small, artisan, delicious-sounding menu. And don't worry about the ARC vibe -- I was greeted three times by staff before I even hit the front door, and everyone is super-friendly. When I stopped in for coffee in the morning, I got a tour of the place from one of the two guys who owns it, met his wife, and felt the excitement of the first days of a new neighborhood place that people really care about. I went back for lunch and had a delicious cabbage and tangerine salad with sesame dressing. They will have wine/beer and small plates in the evening pretty soon too. Love this place. Love it.", "author": "wendy l."}

In my opinion, the food is mediocre at best. A tuna sandwich $8, a donut $3.25...Lunch bill $12. GIVE ME A BREAK! I don't mind paying 8 bucks for a sandwich, but jeez, if you're going to charge $8 for a tuna sandwich, make it worth the 8 bucks. The sandwich was dry, barely any tuna and two pieces of bread....boring and not worth it. This place gets 1 star for me for the atmosphere.", "author": "Joseph G."}

Coffee Bar lured from the street by it's beaming red sign.  I figured I have discovered all the coolest places by now.  I was surprised I had not been here sooner.  This is a highly stylized  palace for all things Java; I like the format and there are elements that tell you how the principals are engaged in their business; it is more than a business but a passion.  I like how there is a roll of shipping paper that cleanly depicts the days offering.  The art work was fantastic; the front coffee bar shows an homage to the bus park nearby.  The art work and the higher level seating transport you to a nice coffee house experience -- more like a coffee salon.  So nice; so needed and it feels like my out of the way secret coffee palais.", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

But there's a fine line between too loud, too close, bad wifi, and that perfect hum of music you like playing that's audible but not deafening; sitting companionably side by side to work or hearing every chew and sip of your equally deadline driven stranger/neighbor/workmate and actually ordering crappy coffee or actually something you want  to imbibe so you can enjoy the comfortable couch AND free wifi. Well, Coffee Bar just earned me as a regular today. I've been here before for a fine cappuccino pit-stop on what was, unbeknown to me, a sleepy weekend morning but today was like the office of my dreams. A sea of motivated people meeting, greeting, eating and web-surfing, afternoon Pellegrino, followed by yam soup and a, later still, a nice Pinot to transition and random copies of Art in American from afternoon rewrite session to happy hour chilling. Yeah I parked it for the afternoon when I needed to concentrate and got work done and coddling at the same time. Score! Clean, healthy, adult, light and life-filled. Yes, the owners seem to care.", "author": "Deborah C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-20", "description": "Unless most of the other reviewers, I've ONLY been to Coffee Bar for dinner on a Friday night with the Radio Africa kitchen. The hours listed said that they closed at 9pm, but we got there at 9:05 and the very friendly hostess agreed to seat us once a table opened up. The food was a little pricey ($15-$25 main dishes... not very much food), but I guess that's the case with most places in SF. Without knowing anything about Coffee Bar, or Radio Africa nights, our group of 6 was pleasantly surprised with the delicious scallop dish, edamame hummus, and mezze plates. I would go again if I lived nearby. The waiter was very friendly, our water was refilled often, and the wine was tasty. A great atmosphere for a dinner out with friends. Something about it was very fresh but also cozy.", "author": "S. C."}

And that is saying a lot because this isn't my neighborhood coffee spot so I need to drive each time.  Parking is really easy though.  I've gone twice for bkfast and once for early dinner wine & snacks.  The atmosphere in the morning is nice - full of natural light.  Great place to have your morning coffee (and it's very good coffee) and use their free internet.  But last night was my favorite experience so far.  We shared a couple of items on the menu (tonno w/ cannellini beans in a tomato sauce and their version of a salami plate) and it was awesome.  Everything was extremely tasty and it was great to be enjoying it all while lounging in one of their couches.  Pretty cool that they can transition from day to evening like that.  The guys working there seemed sincerely interested in how much we were enjoying our food/wine so that is sweet.  I am looking forward to going back on a sunny afternoon and enjoying their patio.", "author": "Piper B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-08", "description": "Coffee Bar is a nice alternative to the less spacious, often more crowded cafes in the mission (Ritual and Four Barrel, I'm looking at you!) if you still want quality coffee and reliably good music while you catch up with friend, read, or study (those signs that say no laptops on this table between 11:30 and 3 are purely decorative, so don't worry about those if you need to get work done, the tables are roomy and there are usually enough plugs to go around).  Tucked into a large industrial space, the windows are huge, so if you have to do work on a weekend, you don't have to feel like a mole person who doesn't get exposed to daylight.  And, the decor is clean and classy- nice array of succulents on the patio, cool light fixtures inside, and if you look long enough at the art above the bar, you'll realize it's a picture of the bus depot, who knew the bus depot could look so classy.  Also, a great spot for brunch on the weekends- they have only three things, but all are delicious, I especially recommend the potato madness because I haven't found another place that has the genius to combine roasted red potatoes, guacamole and egg (and bacon for the meat lovers).
