She was very gracious and met up with me when I needed to work and she found a place with vegan options that was laptop friendly. She actually did a very good job reviewing this place for the both of us, so I'll keep the rest short.\n\nYes, they don't offer vegan matcha lattes, they should consider adding these to their menu since match is exploding in popularity these days.

But I guess the current version is basically ham and cheese on a baguette, which was good, but not as much fun as an \"assemble it yourself\" situation.\n\nSo all in all it was fine, but nothing I am clamoring to get back to.

I also wanted a place that had at least some vegan food since I hadn't eaten breakfast yet. This place seemed to fit all of those criteria and had a high rating, so I recommended that we go here. \n\nThis place is located in Bernal Heights and street parking is free on Sundays, but you will likely still have to park a couple blocks away and walk. They don't have matcha lattes here if that is your drink and while they serve Stumptown Coffee, my mocha turned out so bad it was practically undrinkable. While they had clearly marked vegan options on their menu, most of them where on the sweeter side and I prefer savory vegan breakfast a lot more. \n\nFor food my friend ordered a vegan blueberry muffin and I ordered avocado toast and vegan banana bread (which they ran out of and I switched to chai coffee cake). My avocado toast was good, but nothing I would go out of my way to seek out again and the coffee cake was just okay too. \n\nReally if the coffee sucks, it's pretty much impossible for me to give higher than a 3 star review. The only thing keeping this review lower than 3 stars for me was their menu was vegan friendly with clearly marked options. \n\nI don't plan on coming back.", "author": "Regina W."}

They are pretty fast with the refills but you do need to bring the cup to the counter and they have different prices if you want bottomless coffee or just a cup of one which I thought was interesting. \n\nWe were both still hungry so we shared one of their toasts which was bigger than both our previous dishes. We got the banana almond butter toast. Their toasts and waffles are super photogenic as is the entire cafe itself. Super cute and lots to look at. They have art and merch for sale as well.

Here's what I thought: \n\n-Avocado Toast $6: Thick multigrain toast, lots of smashed avocado, lemon, and chili flakes. \n\nI loved the brightness of it (color and taste wise), but I didn't like the bread here. It wasn't toasted well enough which made the whole toast a little less appetizing. \n\n-Persimmon Toast $6: Thick multigrain toast, cream cheese, persimmon slices, granola, and honey. \n\nI initially wanted the Fig Toast (it's seasonal?), but this one was FANTASTIC! The bread was the same, but toasted better which was an overall better texture. There are lots of textures on the toast itself and flavors that danced well together. I would love to have this again!\n\n-Hot Chocolate $4ish: Quite good, but not sweetened much.

But first, let's talk about this Portuguese-inspired cafe in Bernal Heights. This was Nervous Dog, I remember, and playing in a much lower key back then, but now its refreshed identity appears to be percolating with life. It did remind me of the pastelerias of Lisbon where you get a cup of strong coffee and a pastel de nata, which is an egg custard tartlet similar to the ones at Golden Gate Bakery except with a slightly burnt topping that gives it a crunch. I would have been gobsmacked if they served them here but alas, I saw none. In fact, I saw little because it was pretty packed.\n\nSo when I got up to the counter, I just happened to notice on a little sign in the back that said they served a $6 Fig Toast. Oh my, sounded good and it was with honey date cream cheese spread on pan de mie bread, then covered with slices of fresh brown turkey figs, drizzled with honey, and sprinkled with fresh crushed pepper (photo: http://bit.ly/2boy1Hv). It was just terrific and something I've since replicated at home as I thought it was so good. I accompanied that confection with the $3.85 Gal\u00e3o which was well brewed and a smooth complement (photo: http://bit.ly/2byX5MB). If not for the relentless bustle on a Saturday afternoon, I'd definitely make it more of a habit to come for this touch of Lisbon. \n\nFOOD/COFFEE - 4.5 stars...that fig toast was a pure gem\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...frenzied but maybe this is a tribute to Lisbon, too\nSERVICE - 4 stars...good and solid\nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely a place to hang if you don't mind the crowds...and oh yes, that fig toast", "author": "Ed U."}

I ordered a regular cup of coffee and it's pretty good. Not amazing but that's what I expected getting something brewed in such a large quantity. The prices are a bit steep, but if you're willing to dish out ~$10 for a bowl of chia pudding then I'm sure you'd enjoy this place.\n\nOverall I'll probably be back. More for the convenience of the location and the comfy interior than for anything else.", "author": "Angelina H."}

You have your more traditional food like waffles, but then there's also grilled paninis, acai bowls, and delicious avocado toast. \n\nMost recently my husband and I stopped in and ordered the Goose is Loose (a grilled sandwich with ham, cheese, and banana...sooo good!), smoked salmon toast, and fresh pressed juice. They were out of the green juice, but the server recommended the juice with lemon, cayenne, ginger, and apple. I was a little skeptical, but took her advice and damn if it wasn't delicious. Totally hit the spot and made me feel pretty good. \n\nI appreciate that they don't let people have laptops out on weekends to keep the crowd moving. During the week it seems like a pretty sweet spot to set up shop. I always see a lot of people in here with kids, which is great. We need more places in SF that are kids friendly.", "author": "Casey S."}

I am saying that having visited Portugal for a week and tasting authentic food. The food here is very American with Portuguese inspiration. That being said, things were cooked spot on and were all tasty.\n\nCommenting on the price, things are definitely overpriced. The place did not have a sit-down feel, but charged rates matching that. If you wanted a coffee refill, you had to get up to get it.\n\nOn food - I really enjoyed the Baked Egg Breakfast Slider (I would order again if I came back). It was definitely smaller than expected though. I also ordered a Pasteis de Nata (famous in Portugal). This was a very tasty treat, but did not taste authentic at all. My husband ordered a Chia bowl and he was somewhat disappointed. It looked good, but not very filling. \n\n\nOn drinks - the coffee is a strong roast and has excellent flavor - would order again.

If you want to indulge in something comforting, you can find muffins, breads, homemade pop tarts, cookies, etc. or go the healthier route with chia bowls, avocado toast, smoothies, etc.\n\nThey also have Stumptown cold brew on tap or in cans, which is always delicious, or a variety of other coffee drinks, mochas, teas, etc. They have some seasonal drinks also, and for Fall/Winter 2016, they have a peppermint mocha on the menu.\n\nThey are probably more famous for their avocado toast, which is pretty reasonably priced at $5.95 for a slice of toast, mashed avocado with lemon and chili flakes -- and at a decent portion size. My favorite avocado toast of all time still stands with Jane on Fillmore or Jane on Larkin, but this is a top contender for top 3 in the city for the quality and the price.\n\nThe chia bowl that we had was delicious and healthy, with almond milk, cinnamon, freshly sliced fruit and dried figs and fruit. It is sweetened with agave, but it was not too sweet, and a good portion size.\n\nThe one drawback is that they only serve waffles until 2 pm (so go early / accordingly if this is what you want), and the food is not super quick to come out but that's probably because they are making each thing to order which is fine since it's fresher that way.\n\n4.5 stars (if I can give half star ratings) for a super cute coffee shop that is fairly crowded, but enough seating so that you can come have a nice lunch or hang out with friends, or do some work or read a book. They also have a stack of board games and books for you to peruse.

While the location is a bit random (in Bernal Heights off of Mission Street - a bit south of all the shops off of Mission/Valencia), it's definitely worth the walk over.  We live in the Mission, and it's only a short walk; but even if you don't live in the Mission, I'd still recommend popping in. \n\nA HUGE fan of avocado toast, I had to try that.  I also added on their garden salad as well, along with a cold brew on tap.  My husband tried the grilled ham and cheese with bananas.  \n\nAvocado Toast (4 stars) - This was such a unique twist on avocado toast; the bread looks really thick, but it's not dense, so not overly \"bready\".  The citrus with the spice of the pepper flakes was such a good balance - the lemon made it taste so fresh.  Oh, and the avocado - I really appreciated that they loaded that on; no skimping on ingredients here!\n\nGarden Salad (2.5 stars) - Nothing special.  But really, the main focus of my brunch was the avocado toast; I was just looking to add on something light to accompany my toast, and this worked just fine.\n\nCold Brew Coffee (4 stars) - Delicious - highly recommend.  Just a word of caution, as with any cold brew coffee, it's highly caffeinated.  So if you're susceptible to caffeine, just watch your amount of intake of this stuff ;)\n\nGrilled Ham, Cheese & Banana Sammy (5 stars) - Holy moly, this was excellent.  I, being a lover of sweet with savory...knew this would be delicious.  But my husband (as I imagine others would be) was a little skeptical, but decided to give it a go.  He couldn't get over how good it was - he was like, \"We are coming here all the time!!!\"  I had a couple of bites as well, and it was over the moon delicious.  Decadent without being too buttery/messy (as some grilled cheeses can be). Highly recommend.\n\nOverall, this place is SUCH a cute neighborhood stop.

I came here by myself, hoping to use my laptop and get something to eat at the same time. Unfortunately, they don't allow laptops at the tables from 9am-2pm. Ordered an avocado chili toast and a small coffee (I believe it was Stumptown). While paying, I noticed they have a bunch of baked goods at the counter and ended up getting a Portuguese egg tart. Got my number for my order and then sat at the counter near the front of the cafe. My toast took awhile to come out. I had to check up on it and then it finally came. They may have forgotten? Not sure, the server said it was ready right when he was about to ask the kitchen about it. The toast was good, perfect amount of spiciness from the chili.

A friend found St.Jorge on yelp after a yoga class in the Mission, and we decided to give it a try. St.Jorge is a decently sized cafe where the majority of people are on their laptops working away (they have free wifi), while also having a large menu to pick from. I asked the lady at the front (very friendly) what she recommends for a more filling meal, and she told me to try the Goose is Loose. The sandwich was a spin of a grilled cheese with some nice ham and bananas. As funny as that may sound, the bananas actually gave a nice sweet twist to the sandwich, without being overbearing. I also tried the matte, which was very fresh. My friend got the chia bowl, which is good for those avid fans of chia, granola, and fruits (too healthy for me).\n\nI will have to come back for the fig toast (which is unfortunately only there 3 months out of the year).", "author": "Nikita K."}

Not a far walk from Noe Valley! \n\nAtmosphere-- the place is definitely on the trendier side, has a pretty \"hipster\" feel. It's small but there are quite a few tables. I've only ever been on the earlier side (9:30ish am) and I always find a table. Wouldn't be surprised if the place filled up for the later brunch hours though. You can also take it to go I'm pretty sure, so that's something to consider if you live close by. \n\nFood/drinks-- The chia bowl (+ granola & coconut) is the way to go. Feels healthy but is also really filling. Expensive, but I love it so to me it's always worth it. I've also tried the baked egg breakfast sandwich and that's great as well. Would recommend. I've had the avocado toast, and it's great, but I always feel somewhat guilty ordering avocado toast as its so incredibly easy to make at home. But if you're set on ordering it, you won't be disappointed. The coffee is fantastic and they have almond milk! Always enjoy an iced almond milk latte here. They also have a huge selection of pastries/baked goods that also look very freshly made, although I've always been too full on other things to ever try.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend, especially as a more low key alternative to the weekend brunch scene. Not entirely sure-- but I think the food might only be offered on weekends, so anyone coming during the week should definitely call/look into that first!", "author": "Katey P."}

A bit overpriced and the quality doesn't quite match up but at least it's a nice study spot. I came on a weekday around 10am and the place was pretty packed but there were 2 tables open in the no outlet middle aisle of tables. There were outlets along some of the bench spots, a tiny nook on the side, a few high chair tables in the corner, and free wifi. Parking was also really easy. There's side streets with free street parking, otherwise there's a lot of 2 hour metered parking. You may be able to push your luck with the meters. I stayed in my car for half an hour after I left the cafe and didn't see anyone come by to ticket me until I was about to leave.\n\nThis place makes for a terrific study spot and the service is very nice though the prices are a bit steep. They serve a lot of \"modern\" cafe foods like avocado toast, smoothie bowls, and chia seed puddings. Honestly you could make a lot of the items yourself. I ended up getting the Savory Waffle and a Cold Brew. The Cold Brew was bright and mild. I really enjoyed it. The Savory Waffle was a bit strange. It was basically a waffle with a melted Portugese cheese called Ilha Azul + ham topped with arugula. It's served with maple syrup on the side. It had all the basic flavors to balance each other out and it kind of worked? The black pepper in the waffle could've stood out more but at least the arugula brought in some of that pepperiness and bitterness. The waffle itself was light and slightly crispy which was great. The cheese turns plastic-like pretty fast so you don't want to wait too long to eat it. Tt was kind of good but for $13, I wouldn't get it again.\n\nOverall, a good spot in the city to get some work done and have a light lunch or breakfast.

V means vegan, VO means there is a vegan options. Easy peasy lemon squeezy!\n\nOn my first visit, I tried the Orange Blossom Waffle topped with fruit. I didn't taste much orange nor blossom, but it had a crunchy exterior and soft interior, the way a proper waffle should be. I thought that the outside was perhaps a touch overcooked (i.e. a bit on the hard side), but I let the maple syrup soak in to soften it up.\n\nThe second time around, I wasn't feeling super hungry, so I just went with the avocado toast. It's $5.75, but you get a pretty generous slice of bread smothered with a ton of gorgeous, sexy, perfectly ripe avo and a sprinkling of chili flakes (I wanted more, more, more!). If not for the price tag, I think I could have devoured at least a couple more slices. Ironically, I don't think they toasted the toast, as it was served at room temp. Do they pre-toast the toast? Gosh, I hope not.  \n\nTheir lattes are unimpressive. On my last visit, it was way too foamy and lacked that bold, delicious espresso flavor I have come to expect. No latte art, either. They brew Stumptown Coffee, for you coffee aficionados. They also offer almond or rice milk for you dairy-free cuties. Maybe the cold brew tastes better?

It packs quite a zing!\n* apple oatmeal smoothie with agave instead of honey.  Good!\n* the avocado smoothie.  thick, and very unusual tasting. I liked it!\n* chocolate swirl coffee cake (good)\n* vegan and thankfully NOT gluten-free chocolate chip almond butter oatmeal cookie (very good!!!)\n* gluten-free chocolate brownies (gluten-free vegan baked goods are not generally good at all, but these had a very nice brownie texture and only a small amount of yucky aftertaste), \n* gluten-free ginger cookie (too crispy, but edible)\n\nI would give it 5 stars, except I don't go there very much now because they have \"no-laptop\" times now, and I can't remember when those times are.

A spacious, quaint, and naturally-lit spot in the midst of the Mission, Cafe St. Jorge allows one to take a break from all local taquerias (which are affordable and great - don't get me wrong!). I found this place on Yelp in surprise when in search for a brunch/lunch place nearby. I wasn't sure what to expect, and boy, this visit exceeded my satisfaction!\n\nThe decor of this place gives off an air of delicacy and cozy comfort. The blue/black bold yet intricate trimmings/text superimposed against a pure white background is a running theme in the cafe -- seen on their menus, their boards, postcards, etc. The white helps in creating an illusion of an open space, which is perfect for you to work, read, chat etc. Love it. The staff is also incredibly nice and hospitable. \n\nAs for the food -- I came here with two other friends on a Sunday afternoon. We found a table quite easily and went up to order our food. I got the Bimby sandwich, an iced mocha, and a plate of bread and olive oil to share. The Bimby was deliciously well done: the bread was perfectly toasted yet soft enough for your to contour your hands around so the contents don't fall out like a mess. The cheese and tomatoes were super fresh, and the olive oil added a nice touch. The bread was also superbly soft. As for my iced mocha, it was a perfect blend of chocolate and decaf -- both in perfect balance so that not one flavor was too overpowering. In general, there are a sprinkling of options on the menu -- not enough to make you too indecisive -- but just enough to keep you coming back for more! There are also gluten free options too, which is a big plus.\n\nI will definitely come back again next time for Sunday brunch or lunch. Love the atmosphere, food, and the people! What a find!

I waited through the long line once again and was told that there had been an issue but was then promptly provided with an iced coffee.\n\nThen, after waiting about 10 to 15 additional minutes we noticed that even though our food had not yet arrived, everyone who came in after us already had their orders. So then, again, I waited through the quite long line to get back to the register.\n\nI was told that there was some confusion and they had prepared our order to go and had been calling it out - even though they provided us with a number, deliver the food to tables with numbers, and we never heard our order called. But they assured us that the food would be ready shortly since the to-go order they had mistakenly prepared for us had since become cold.\n\nAt this point, it had been about an hour.\n\nI decided to leave and my partner stayed and waited another 10 to 15 minutes to get the food that we had paid for over an hour ago. During this period, he noted that multiple orders went out with our exact configuration - meaning they did not prioritize fixing the mistake over other later orders.\n\nThe food ended up being quite tasty, but nowhere near enough to justify the ridiculous wait and terrible experience.\n\nAll in all, this was a disastrous breakfast excursion that will prevent me from returning and encourage me to inform all of my friends that they should avoid this establishment.", "author": "Jonathon W."}

The d\u00e9cor and menu is Portuguese influenced though they also have non-Portuguese food (sandwiches, toast, smoothies, granola, bagels, waffles, etc.) and vegan/gluten free options. They were out of Portuguese pastries during my visit...so I went back and spotted a few Portugeuese cakes and cookies.\n\n* Avocado toast ($5.85): A thick slice of wheat bread with mashed avocado, chili flakes, salt, and olive oil. The toast was hearty. It wasn't toasted long enough and there wasn't much on top of it for a slice of toast that was over $5.\n* Portuguese lemon rice cake: Looks like a small muffin, soft slightly crusty top, dense and moist, different texture than the usual muffin, dense and heavy yet moist, bits of lemon rind, more moist in the center, yum \n* Spice cookie ($1.75): a pretty crescent shaped dry cookie, pale on the outside, spiced filling on the inside, soft and interesting, different spices, not super sweet, has a hint of anise\n* Latte: made with Stumptown was creamy and smooth, but had no foam art \n\nThe caf\u00e9 has a modern blue and white look with ceiling fans, a cluster of old photos, and vintage coffee cans.

Two specialties are homemade Vegan Banana Nut Bread, and Bolo de Arroz.  I could not tell the banana bread was vegan and was very good.  I have never tried Bolo de Arroz, and this was good as well.  A bit sweet with a hint of lemon.  Don't pass this up!\n\nThe coffee by Sumptown Roasters is also very good ... liquid gold!

We frequent this cafe twice a week Mondays and Fridays. This was one of our favorite spots in the Mission. I'm so sorry to say that the employees are treating people differently if they have children. Two weeks in a row we (my son and I ) have been treated differently as smiles are hand out to persons in front of us and behinds us in line ( last week with Kylie ). Today the counter gal (Alexia) lashed out at my son for playing with the business cards in front of the register. I explained that if an employee has a problem with a child you should address it with the parent. It was inappropriate behavior by a cafe clerk to reprimand anyones child. Especially a small nonverbal, special needs child that lacks in confidence and has anxiety issues. I am even more furious that the general manager Kevin made excuses as to the behavior of his staff and why the employee lashed out, writing it off as the employees having frustration with all the kids that come in that drop and break things and \"cause damages\" his words. My son touches the business cards and the tiny little scale that goes up and down in front of the register. Hardly the same as \"damages\". Only excuses were provided no one apologized for their action toward my child, or how we have been treated. BEWARE PEOPLE - children are not liked here by the current staff. I want to be clear here to this young staff at Cafe St Jorge that discrimination base on age, disabilities, etc.., toward any one person or group is unlawful ! Not only should you treat everyone equally, but working in a service based industry where you encounter customers face to face you put on your best and friendliest face everyday and use your good manners, please, thank you and I'm  sorry ! If I see one more face that looks at us with disgust and you treat us differently then the other customers as has happened the last two weeks because of my child ( special needs ) I will contact Disabilities Rights California and file a complaint with their Attorneys.", "author": "Margareta M."}

And while everyone is raving over Blue Bottle + Sightglass (which are also good) this little Portuguese Cafe is by far my favorites. The space is welcoming, its a nice place to sit + enjoy a cup of coffee or wine + the staff is always on point. Each time I've been here I've experience different staff members and they have all been great!\nOh and I almost forgot the food, coffee, + wine are all fantastic!\nI tend to get a soy cortado or soy flatwhite both are creamy and delicious. I've also had a handful of their pastries + some sandwiches which are all very nice. \nLike many of the other reviewers I have to touch on the pata de nata's. These little custard tarts are the closest thing I've found since being in Lisbon. While I wouldn't call them identical they are definitely tasty!", "author": "Nelli S."}

People are respectful and step outside to take calls and noise from talking duos and trios didn't reverberate loudly in the space.\n- Owners gracefully handled the crazies that pour in off Mission St\n\nBottom line: Great spot and I wish them lots of success!", "author": "Molly N."}

The people are super friendly, the coffee is delicious, and it's right down the block. What really makes this place awesome, though, is that it's the only place I can get almond butter and bananas on toast, instead of the usual peanut butter! Generally a great joint. Only reason for four stars instead of five is that it would be nice to have a few more vegetarian sandwiches on the menu.  :)", "author": "Laurel B."}

We just moved to Bernal Heights and we were really worried about finding good coffee. We walked into this place on a trip back from Cole Hardware. They've got Stumptown Coffee, which was delicious. They also have these amazing custard tarts. Seriously mind-blowing good, particuarly when they're still hot.", "author": "Jonah H."}

It seems like the owners here have taken note of everything that other coffee shops in the city and beyond do wrong and have corrected all of their errors in a space that just makes sense in every way. Unlike most coffee shops, they have really great food at reasonable prices (chia seed bowl, Portuguese-inspired pastries, green juices and avocado toast are highlights), well-priced coffee ($2 for 1 cup and $3.15 for unlimited), a nice beer and wine selection, really good music, GOOD wall art, and an incredibly friendly staff. They also don't stare you down if you're on your laptop for a few hours. Rather, they place little signs on your table that encourage other patrons to sit with you. The place is always full of people, a testament to how well-run and welcoming the space and the people who work there are.", "author": "Yana S."}

The Latte did not dissapoint, the Portuguese themed vegan pastries were phenominal, and the owner Andrea was a really welcoming host. \n\nIt was a little busy on Sunday, which is understandable for a cafe of this caliber, but stopping by on a Monday morning I found a seat open, enjoyed a tasty quiche, and muddled around on their free wifi. If you live in the area,are just passing by, or want to test Andrea on her Portuguese heritage, do yourself a favor and check this place out.", "author": "Rob C."}

Their coffee is very good and slightly cheaper than other hip cafes in the city. It gets a nice mixed crowd and not everybody is on the computer. Their food is healthy and delicious and the staff is very friendly.. I manged to knock over a big glass of water that got shattered on the floor and nobody got upset with me... on the contrary... they asked me not to touch the glass so i wouldn't hurt myself... I really have only good things to say about them.. i  also love the fact that they are Portuguese... and offer some Portuguese snacks like those little beans that taste like cheese... forgot the name but go ahead and try them!", "author": "ania w."}

It has a welcoming ambiance and lots of natural light. The chairs are hard - perhaps to deter you from spending the *whole day* there. Another thing to deter you is a local who frequents the place; she is *chatty* and eccentric. The quality of the coffee depends on the barista. I've had cups that range from meh to okay. \n\nwifi: Fast when it works. It works most of the time.\n\nkids: There is a little nook by the front window for kids to read an play. Seems like the local parents like it enough.\n\narriving with a group: You wouldn't want to meet up with more than 3 of your friends here.\n\nnote, the \"Thursday Game Night\" advertised with flyers does not really happen. No one plays games here on Thursday nights.", "author": "Claire B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-03", "description": "For a moment, putting aside the Azorean Portuguese food and angle, this is a really nice cafe to sit down and get your coffee. The coffee is very good, the owners are warm and friendly, and the interior is inviting and light filled. With the white and light blue Azorean paint scheme, the ambiance is a welcome break from the typically dark interiors of most cafes across the city. \n\nOn the food side, we sampled three pastries: Bolo de arroz (sweet rice muffin), the pastel de nata (custard tart), and the especie (anise filling cookie). Andrea has nailed them all. \n\nThe especies are spot on for authenticity. These rare treats are only found on the tiny island of Sao Jorge of the Azores (and maybe some of the neighboring islands), or from old lady Azorean immigrants in San Jose. You can't even find them in mainland Portugal. My wife and I hate anise flavored anything, but we love these. Andrea's taste exactly how you would find them on Sao Jorge, and you don't even have to travel 14 hours to get them.\n\nThe pastel de nata is a standard in mainland Portugal. I think these are tasty and I was happy to find them in San Francisco, if just for nostalgia's sake.\n\nThe Bolo de Arroz really shined. Andrea mentioned to me that she had altered the traditional recipe and I think she did a brilliant job with it. This muffin has a great balance of moistness, texture, and I think coconut milk? In the way that the pastel de nata is the signature pastry in Lisbon, I think Andrea has found her own for her cafe.\n\nAlthough I didn't sample the savory section of her menu, I hope what looks like to be successful launch will allow her to expand the lunch menu to include some more substantial Portuguese dishes, although I understand that this place is a cafe and not a restaurant. It would rock out to have a place where you could get a bifana (hint hint Andrea, give us a wine-garlic pork sandwich).", "author": "Michael C."}

However the time i went it was full of hipsters working on their imac. There was not a single table without an apple laptop. When i walked in i felt like getting in a conference room for some business meeting. Really sad. I believe coffee places should be for people to read, chat, enjoy food or coffee and not for a feeling like being at work. It would be 5 stars for the pastries and coffee but it gets only 2 because i really got a rejection to that kind of laptop environment.", "author": "Luca R."}
