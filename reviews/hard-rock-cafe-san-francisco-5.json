I've been Hard Rock Cafe in other locations, but unfortunately it was the most disappointed I've ever been. We were seated right away, but in the back in a dark area that reeked of weed. When my mom asked to move tables to front, the hostess first told us if she didn't know if there was enough space (the restaurant was nearly empty), but then hastily agreed to move us. I will say the waitress who took our order was a lot nicer though.\n\nWe waited nearly 30 minutes for a food, and the waitress kept assuring us it would be out shortly (like I said earlier, nearly EMPTY restaurant). \n\nWe ordered the Classic Waldorf Salad which came with kale/spinach, green apples, pomegranate seeds, grapes, celery, walnuts, and a herb ranch dressing on the side. It was okay, the pomegranate seeds were probably the best part of the dish. The chicken was cooked find but didn't have much flavor at all. \n\nWe also ordered the Black Bean and Quinoa Burger, which sounded yummy but was completely bland...zero flavor. The patty was also soggy and kept falling apart. The waitress offered to take it back, but we didn't have time to wait for a new dish to come out. The fries were good though. \n\nOverall, while our waitress was VERY nice and tried to offer us a free sundae as an apology, I was not impressed and probably would not come back to this particular location.", "author": "April L."}

He checked up on us regularly without becoming too intrusive and refilled drinks consistently. \n\nFood: We ordered The Big Cheeseburger and The Original Legendary Cheeseburger with french fries. While I was actually impressed that the burgers actually looked like the ones portrayed on the menu, the food was not that good. Both of the burgers were overcooked and lacked any flavor or taste. A burger from In-n-Out tasted better than the $20 burgers here. \n\nIt was a bit disturbing to see our waiter get into it with the hostess/host because of lack of communication. There was a table of 3 tourists who sat themselves at an empty table (there were at least 4 open tables during the afternoon) and our waiter proceeded to retrieve their drink and food orders. While the waiter left to put in the order, the host staff came over and kicked the three tourists out while sweeping up all the utensils and napkins from table. Imagine our waiter's surprise when he came back to an empty table without diners! They later sorted out the situation and sat the 3 tourists back at their same table.

However, we were allowed to choose our own table and the servers were friendly.\n\nI recalled ordering a pretty good vegeburger the last time I was here; however the waiter informed me that they no longer served that item...it had been replaced by a \"Cauliflower Burger\". The only other 'vegetarian' option was (wait for it) Cauliflower Wings...like buffalo wings but with cauliflower.\n\nMy girlfriend order the cauliflower wings (which she pronounced 'good' - but left mostly uneaten). She didn't enjoy the atmosphere; I got more of the vibe, but felt that it was not as 'hip and happening' as it was half a decade ago. Maybe I am growing old? I asked for French fries & onion rings (washed down with beer) and made the best of it; they were not bad.\n\nThe waiter (Ernesto) was a decent pleasant person. He disappeared for a while and returned with a delicious Sundae for my sweetheart (having heard that her birthday is a couple of days hence). \n\n4 stars because Ernesto is a star.", "author": "Jack W."}

I guess my main issue is how inconsistent and flighty the service is. \n\nNothing much wrong with the food but nothing remarkable either. Think comfort food that is what tourists expect typical American food is. Including the big portions. Think burgers, wings, steak, bbq and more. I had the hickory smoked pulled pork sandwich and it was decent. The meat was fall apart tender and while the you don't really get the hickory flavor, the bbq sauce keeps it moist albeit a little generic. It's a big serving for lunch though when you add in the heaping amount of fries. \n \nOur server was friendly when around but disappeared for over 15 mins after dropping off our check. We wanted to pay but nobody else would take our cards even though it was obvious we weren't being served and they weren't busy. Must be a managerial policy but absolutely flawed. They work on tourist time so don't expect speedy service if you need to have lunch on the clock.", "author": "Jon L."}

Once the server finally made it to us we gave her our food and drink order since we had been sitting there for sometime. It took forever to get our drinks. We asked for waters and never got them. Once our food was finally delivered it was room temp. Had to go find someone to give us napkins and silverware. The server never checked on us. Then ran out of drinks and never got our water so we went to the bar to order more drinks and get water.  We were there for close to two hours.

I was actually kind of impressed that we managed to order an appetizer that they had run out of followed by a beer they had run out of, followed by another beer they had run out of. \n\nOn the other hand, the waiter was friendly. \n\nI was expecting a menu more like BJs or Applebee's when I saw they were in those fancy binders. It appears, however, those are just classy decoys. They bamboozled us with a listing of only a handful of appetizers. When we made our selections we were informed they had run out of the ones we wanted. \n\nThey did take our drink orders right away so that's good. Although I think they may have forgotten they took them as I slowly died of dehydration. It worked out though, after an hour and asking a different waiter I realized I never wanted water in the first place. I don't know how they knew I never wanted water, when I specifically asked for it over and over and over, but they did, so kudos to them for being so in tune with me. \n\nOn to the food, it arrived after about 45 minutes. I ordered the big cheeseburger so when I got the hickory barbecue burger it was a little bit surprising. But hey, a burger is a burger. It was a bit soggy but with a little practice it will be as good as Carl's junior in no time. The fires were actually very good. In fact, if you come here consider ordering only the fries. And by consider I mean do that. Only get the fries! Or maybe just go to McDonald's those fries are better and significantly cheaper.  \n\n\nOverall, I would take a pass next time. That's not to say it didn't grow as a person being here.

Here's the deal, I wasn't trapped, tricked or fooled. Keep in mind that I had a motley group of diners who's only lunch consisted of clam chowder bread bowl then they toured all over Alcatraz in the wee moments of a sunset on the most perfect day to visit SF in over two months. Why tempt fate or the powers of the Underworld? I emailed HRC about two weeks before when I scouting possible locations for our dinner. Not only did Sean, the HRC manager email me but he followed up with a personal call. He was super informative, courteous, and very apologetic for all the remodeling that was going on. More on that later. At this point, I was super excited about visiting HRC and couldn't wait to spring it my guests. On to my motley group, my wife is a no carb carrying member, we also had three others in the group that were well done meat eaters and two more that prefer tortillas over bread or crust.  \nThe distance from the Alcatraz tour disembark to Pier 39 was a short 8 min walk and we entered HRC through the patio due to the remodel of the entrance of the HTC.  The interior looks great and all the memorabilia is all new. The bar is still under construction but they can make some drinks just ask your server. I was promptly greeted with, \" Hi Charles, is this everyone in your group?\"  I replied with a yes and we were seated. It was such a relief to be pampered after touring all day. This is exactly what this group needed. One in our group ordered a Mojito and there were a couple of other drinks which did not present an issue for the staff. Colby? was our server and he had a trainee in tow, Sal. They both were professional and accommodating since we did have some special ordering. The menu is paired down which is something that I applaud all restaurants to do. Don't worry there's plenty of choices from Grilled Wings, Burgers, Ribs to Fajitas and more. Several in our group ordered the fajitas and I ordered the wings. Upon ordering wings, you'll be asked with you want traditional or grilled and the sauce. I believe the sauces are Classic Rock, blah blah blah, and Heavy Metal. I was persuaded to go big or go home so I went with the Heavy Metal. The wings arrived with the rest of the order and they were grilled and personally attended to. It didn't look like they were spun in a bowl and slide on a plate. The presentation was excellent. We also ordered the Garlic Parmesan fries with a garlic aioli sauce. The sauce is most excellent my only complaint is that the two or three fries in the top of the pile were limp and not hot but those underneath were hot and fresh. After finishing the wings, we took a group photo and did some shopping. I want to thank Sean and staff for their personal attention and I would recommend HRC for lunch, snack, or dinner. As with any concert, grab a seat and enjoy the show the same is true for HRC SF. I'm ready for a encore.", "author": "Charles F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-05-18", "description": "My family and I came here after walking around the wharf - We were all in San Fran for a wedding and it was our last day in town. This was honestly the last choice of restaurants for us, but everything else was packed and had lines, so we decided to go here because it didn't look busy. We put our names in for a party of 9 and were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait. There were a lot of open tables, but I figured it had to do with the amount of staff they had at the time. Fine. \n\nWe went to the bar to get some drinks while we waited. There were probably five other people there, three bar tenders in total going in and out from behind the bar. No one came up to us immediately - We probably sat there for a good five minutes at first. Finally a bartender asked us what we wanted, and I asked him for a drink menu. He didn't say a word, just slammed (literally, slammed) five dirty/sticky drink menus down in front of me and walked away. My mom even commented on how rude it was. Off to a great start! We ordered our drinks and they were fine. I finished my glass of wine in about twenty minutes and sat at the bar with my empty glass on the table for the remainder of our time sitting there - Another 45 minutes. No one ever came to ask me if I wanted another drink. There were a few more rude encounters with the bar tenders - My sister was trying to pay the bill and was telling the bar tender what drinks to charge her for, to which the bar tender replied in a harsh tone that she already knew what she ordered. My mom tried to get the bar tenders attention several times for another drink and they were extremely rude and passive to her. Overall, worst bar service I have ever experienced. \n\nAfter 45 minutes at the bar, we started to see other parties being seated before us and inquired with the hostesses (plural). They told us it would be another 30 minutes. So that's 1 hour 15 minutes of a wait instead of the original 30-45 minutes. GREAT. At this point we are starving and thirsty. We had to inquire again after those 30 minutes went by to be seated - my sister wouldn't leave the host stand until they sat us. \n\nWe were finally seated and our waiter was actually fine. He was pleasant and not terribly slow. I did note that I was the only one who asked for a water and I was the only one who didn't get one... Anyways, the majority of my party enjoyed their meals (Mine was really gross - margarita flatbread. Couldn't even finish it). \n\nOverall, I have to say, this place is horrible. I didn't have that high of expectations going in because I never do with chains, so with that being said, this is the worst of the worst. Those bartenders should be fired. They were miserable. If they hate their jobs so much they should go do something that doesn't require people interaction and customer service, especially in a tourist area.", "author": "Erin C."}

As per usual, this is what I ordered and it was just as good as it always is. I'd recommend this dish to people who are pasta fans and lovers of comfort foods.\n\nWe skipped dessert since we wanted to try some other options found nearby on the pier. We also forgot to get our parking validated, but when we went back in, our server remembered us and was quick to help us out!\n\nOverall: A\nNot a bad place to pick up some grub and drinks while visiting the pier!", "author": "Stacy F."}

Went in with friends and waited 30 minutes for a table with open tables on both sides of the restaurant and tables in the bar. Even though we were waiting there were other people who came in and were seated first. My friends are of color. We were finally seated after my friend said something. The bar was overly loud. I'm not talking bar loud. I'm talking inside an echoing box loud. We ordered and got our drinks then our waitress disappeared. My friends were served their meals and mine was not. I literally was not served. My friend finally got the waitresses attention and it took another 10 minutes to get my meal, they obviously didn't make it. Again, waitress disappeared. No refills, no checking to see if we needed anything. We had to ask the bartender for ketchup, mustard, drinks. I ordered the Original Burger and it was just bad. No seasoning at all. Just a slab of meat. They do give you a side of hot dressing for the burger, but that's so hot you can't taste it. We did finally see our waitress when it was time to pay. Bad visit. Bad food.

Made reservations online since we thought there may be a long wait since it's a tourist spot. We finally got to the restaurant, of course you have high expectations since it's a \"high end restaurant\" the girls in the front didn't greet anyone with a smile or a hello. They just looked at customers coming in, never once did I hear them say hi or ask how many were in their party. There was one girl with colored hair and pig tails she had the worst attitude. Since our reservation was for 6:30 they asked us to come back around that time. So we decided to walk around a bit, we finally get a text saying our table is ready.  We head back over to the restaurant, asked the girls we received a text that our table is ready. They just looked at us and said oh let me check, what was the point of the text message?! She comes back and says they are still cleaning it and give it about 2mins. 15mins passed! We are waiting for someone for an update. Also the girls didn't apologize that our table wasn't ready yet. I don't know who hired these girls but they definitely need more training in this field. They obviously have no care for customers nor the restaurant.

However, with many other restaurants at Pier 39 and on the wharf, I'd look elsewhere.\n\nSince we haven't been in the Fisherman's Wharf area for a while, we decided to play tourist for the day and check out the area and finish off the day with dinner at Hard Rock.  At one time we used to make an effort to stop by a Hard Rock while traveling domestically and internationally to dine and/or buy a souvenir t-shirt.  But, I'm glad that phase of my life is history.  \n\nHard Rock's menu is standard American fare consisting of salads, fish/meat entrees, BBQ, sandwiches and burgers.  We opted for:\n\nNew York Strip Steak- a USDA choice 28-day aged 12-oz New York strip steak topped with ma\u00eetre d' butter and served with hash brown waffles and green beans.  Cooked medium rare as ordered, but felt the steak was not that tender. \n\nHickory-Smoked Barbecue Trio Combo - with chicken, pulled pork and beef brisket. The pulled pork was moist, but the chicken and beef brisket was on the dry side. \n\nThe restaurant had only about 12 patrons on a Friday evening, which was far from the crowded Hard Rocks as we remembered. Hence, service from our server was efficient and friendly.  Hard Rock will have its fans dining on standard American fare amidst music memorabilia and music videos.

I was bringing a friend in for the first time because I like the atmosphere and the food has always been decent. There was a bit of a wait, no problem. When we began giving our order, the waitress became very confused. I am a heart patient and on an extremely restricted diet. All I wanted was a hamburger in a lettuce wrap with onion and tomatoes, that's it...no cheese, no sauce, no fries...just the burger. I was served a burger with cheese, sauce in a cup on my plate, and fries. After informing the waitress, she took it back and said they would take care of it. Twenty minutes later, she brought it back along with the other items I didn't order. It was the same burger, they scraped off most of the cheese, it was cold and dry. After two bites, I saw a glob of cheese on the edge of the burger. By this time, my dinner companions had finished their meal. I scraped off the cheese and ate it anyway. Another order at the table was also incorrect, they had forgotten a side dish that came with her meal. I told the waitress that she didn't get everything, so she brought her the side, with no fork since she had already cleared their dishes. She was rude upon delivery, heavy sighs and a dismissive attitude. On the way out, I mentioned to the host that my meal and the experience were not good. The waitress and the manager were summoned to speak to me, no problem. After telling them of the issues, the manager began to argue with me. He said that he personally supervised the cook when my burger was brought back to the kitchen, and insisted that it was a fresh burger. I told him that I didn't believe that, because it was cold and they hadn't scraped all of the cheese off. He did comp us the meal, and he was most unpleasant about it. I simply wanted to inform him that if I were a person with a dairy allergy, that meal would have put me into the closest emergency room. So WARNING to those with a DAIRY ALLERGY, do not eat here, they're okay with putting you in danger. \n\nHad the staff been nicer about the entire experience, it's likely I may have gone back to give them another chance. I will not return. Oh, and the friend that was with me, his firm will not be calling for reservations for their weekly company lunch.

Even so, sometimes it's fun to be a tourist in your own city. That being said, we spent a good amount of time walking around the cheesy souvenir shops and horrible fast food kiosks that are scattered throughout the Warf. To end the night right, we decided to have dinner at the Hard Rock!\n\nUsually I do all I can to avoid chain restaurants; especially in a town like SF that is known for its amazing restaurants. Regardless, Hard Rock is my only exception. We showed up around 7pm on a Saturday night and were told there would be a 45 minute wait. Not surprisingly, there's a large gift shop to mosey around in while you kill time. Finally, the vibrating thingy they gave me started going crazy which meant our table was ready.\n\nWe were led to our table right next to one of many television screens playing live performances of the legendary rock stars mixed in with modern-day music videos. The music is also blaring through the speakers at all times. If you're sensitive, be sure to bring some ear plugs.\n\nThe menu at every Hard Rock is more or less exactly the same. It's filled with typical American food that any unadventurous tourist would be comfortable with. They also have many, many pictures of the food throughout the many, many pages of the menu. The portions are humungous so I landed on one of their entree sized appetizers. I got the Santa Fe spring rolls (with spinach, black beans, cilantro, corn, jalape\u00f1os, red peppers, jack cheese, salsa, guacamole-chipotle ranch dressing, and tortilla straws). This \"appetizer\" was absolutely huge and was more than enough for just me. These little rolls were nice and crispy on the outside and filled with cheesy goodness on the inside. My favorite part easily had to be the guac-chipotle ranch dipping sauce!\n\nHard Rock is your typical tourist trap selling artery clogging dishes in seemingly every city in the world.

It was honestly fine because people make mistakes sometimes. He quickly said sorry and replaced the food. We mentioned multiple times that we were on a time constraint because we needed to catch a specific train back home. I think because my group of girl friends and I were teenagers, he took advantage of us (not in that way!!). Paying between a group is always complicated, and some of us didn't have change to pay. My dish was around $11 but I only had a $20 bill. Even with tax and tip, the dish did not cost me anywhere near $20.

Terrible experience so far, hoping the food makes up for it but I don't have high hopes. We were a group of six and told the wait time would be 10-20 minutes, so we waited. After 20 minutes I went back to the hostess and she assured me that there was just one table they were waiting on to be bussed and it would take about 10 more minutes. After waiting ANOTHER 15 minutes I asked again and she just said she couldn't do anything and was going to get us in as soon as possible. About 10 minutes after that our pager finally went off and we were seated. Once inside, we noticed there were 10+ empty tables large enough to accommodate our party, and they seem to have more than enough staff just standing around, so not sure why we had to wait almost an hour to be seated. After no server addressed our table for 15 minutes, I physically had to go up to another worker and request that we get a server. Eventually someone came and now here I am 20 minutes later, writing this review while waiting for our food. Definitely never coming back here.\n\n\nUPDATE:\nFood came. It was not good. (Mac and cheese was pretty good, nothing special but no complaints about it). HOWEVER, my boyfriend ordered a burger, it came out practically raw (as was another burger that someone else in our party ordered) the cheese wasn't melted on, bacon looked unappetizing, and overall looked very very different from the menu. So neither person ate the burgers for fear of getting sick from consuming raw meat. It gets worse. My boyfriend was finishing off a fairly good salad that someone else has ordered, when he found something that looked strange. I guessed it was a stray piece of chicken, he thought it was weird lettuce. It turned out to be a very tightly crumpled up piece of a STRAW WRAPPER. That's right, a straw wrapper mixed into the salad. We had no straw wrappers at any point on our table, so this clearly came from the kitchen, based on how it was mixed so well into the salad. I'm just happy that he found it before eating it, I hope the person who was originally eating salad didn't accidentally ingest any non-food items that may have been present. After requesting the manager, he came to our table and apologized for our negative experience (and this is prior to the food even coming out). He ended up taking care of our entire meal, so at least we didn't have to pay for this absolutely appalling service, food, and overall awful experience.", "author": "Adriana E."}

So did the Legacy Burger (classic version, not the local version), which was rare, juicy, and decadant, exactly as ordered.  That was the best way to consume 2000 calories in one sitting that I've ever experienced! Now back to the DASH diet.\n\nMy partner had the barbecue sandwich, which was good but not spectacular.  The prices, overall, are unacceptably high, but our meals were prepared well and delivered promptly.  I've had terrible service here in the past, and when it's crowded, I can't stand it - it's noisy, chaotic, and haphazard. Makes you feel like a cheezy tourist just for showing up.  Another problem is that they make you wait when there are visible, empty tables.  They explain that this is because they try to maintain service quality by not overloading the servers, so they will only open up enough tables for the number of servers on duty.\n\nBut the bottom line is that we had a good experience despite the overpriced menu, because our server went above and beyond to make it happen.  I wish I got his name - it was late on a Sunday afternoon, and he was a very pleasant Hispanic man who was clearly a very advanced, sophisticated waiter. We sat right near the entrance.\n\nOther pros: Manager stopped by and genuinely inquired about how things were going. We let him know the men's room needed attention, and he had someone take care of it at once.\n\nCons: The greeting/hosting staff need training.  Once our buzzer went off, we had to endure a few minutes of shifting from one foot to another while they discussed where to seat us, bent over the hostess stand with their backs to us. We were then escorted to a table so casually that it was hard to follow where we were supposed to go, and it just wasn't a very courteous or alert experience.\n\nOther con: It's exploitative and greedy to leave prices off your drink menu.

First off, they could not seat our party of 9 at one table because pushing the table together would have been a fire hazard. However, they did have a table set up right in front of the glass doors that led to the outside area. That seemed like the real fire hazard. Secondly, the audio quality was awful. It was difficult to determine what song was playing, you mostly just heard bass. Also, there were not enough tv's to get a good view of the music videos.  \n\nOur food took a very long time to arrive and when it did it was cold as if it had been sitting around for a while. The restaurant wasn't even crowded.\n\nOn the positive side, our sever was very good and she had the manager visit us.

Me, being a local resident, not so much. But, I put away my disdain that day and took them anyway. Of course a trip to the Wharf means a boat ride to Alcatraz. Halfway through the Alcatraz tour, the 11 year old step-nephew started to throw a fit. He was hungry. If this kid doesn't get exactly what he wants (which is usually a plain hamburger, some sort of meat, or chicken tenders), he gets super cranky and awful.  An absolute nightmare. So, we quickly got on the boat and got back to the Wharf and started to walk. That's when we stumbled across this disaster of a restaurant. \n\nMy dad and the step-family said they loved Hard Rock. They ate at one in Pittsburgh that had the best ribs. Whatever you guys say. I am a vegetarian and usually ask to go somewhere more vegetarian friendly, but the 11 year old step-nephew was just being a horrible monster at this point so I agreed to go. We walked inside and immediately got seated. All is going well. We got the menus and I noticed the vegetarian options are very, very few. Even the salads are loaded with bacon and fried meat. The mushroom burger looked unappealing with it's special sauces and whatnot on top, so I special ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. I have done this at other restaurants with no problems because hey, seriously, how hard is it to make a grilled cheese? But doing it at this place was a HUGE mistake. At first the waitress brought out a chicken sandwich - sorry vegetarian only. She then brought out the grilled cheese sandwich and right as she put it in front of me she said, \"wow, this looks very burnt, are you ok with this?\" I took a look at it and noticed that one of the halves looked like they scorched it and then somehow managed to put the cheese on it. The other half looked ok - but seriously gross. So I said, \"yep, this is ok\". Mind you I didn't want to send something back a 3rd time and get my food spit on - which with the looks on how well this restaurant prepares food, you know it will happen. My meal did come with fries too so I thought those would fill me up somewhat. They were unsalted and tasted like they had been in the freezer for some time. My meal was just super disgusting.\n\nMy step-mom got the salad and it looked super gross and she barely ate it. She said it was one of the worst salads she has ever had. The kids got the ribs and they looked dry and after my dad tasted them, he said they were the most horrible ribs he has ever had. He said the food was a totally different experience from what they had at the Hard Rock in Pittsburgh. My dad was ok with his meal, which was the salad with fried meat and bacon on top. The waitress saw how little I ate and gave us the burnt grilled cheese meal for free, which was a nice gesture. But, my dad ended up paying $180 for some of the grossest food he had in a long time. He said he will never step foot in another Hard Rock again. \n\nIt's obvious this place doesn't care because they know tourists come and go.

Our waiter was apologetic and immediately corrected the situation by giving my wife a fresh new batch.  The manager came over only at behest of our server to apologize; however, nothing was comped not even the french fries with the hair.  Very disappointing.  Still gave a tip to our waiter who deserved it since he did everything in his power to make amends, but extremely disappointed the manager didn't do more on his end.", "author": "Steven W."}

I expect that when I order a drink I'm actually going to consume alcohol, not just throw away calories drinking a stupid soda. I ordered a Long Island ($10) which usually has the most bang for your buck and is sometimes even a little strong for my taste. Not here. Tasted nothing, felt nothing (on an empty stomach!) still not convinced the bartender actually put anything in it. I can only imagine what their other drinks are like. They would probably make you LESS drunk. \n\nI don't even know why they bother having a bar at all. What a tease.", "author": "Jaleh B."}

The lady says about 30 min so we are cool with that and we wait patiently. 40 min pass and we still aren't being sit. We see other people who came after us get seated before we do. I'm like are you fore real. So I go see the lady again how much longer. She says we are looking for a table. So I go back and sit down and then a few min later she comes back and says sir from a distance and says it's ready but with an attitude. She didn't even bother to ring the buzzer instead she came up to me and said it's ready like what the hell is the buzzer for then. Just for giggles or something. So we get to the table in the far back corner and she puts the menu on the table and says nothing  just walks away. I say thank you and she just ignores me and goes away. So we get our table and try to read the menu and our waiter comes and she just throws us the coasters instead of putting it on the table. She then tells us let me know when ur ready and didn't bother to ask us for our drinks. She passes by several times and doesn't say anything. Finally she comes by and we put in our order and then another waiting game happens. It was about 20-30 until we finally asked is the food ready then magically tada it was ready. But the food was probably definitely not worth the wait. Fries cold sandwiches cold food was decent but definitely not worth my time nor money. I am telling everyone my bad experience so everyone can be more aware of this awful place and hopefully will avoid this place. By the way I'm on vacation and I think so far this is the worst part so far. Never coming back. #hate this place", "author": "Chewy C."}

This one in San Fransisco, was pretty bad. After a bit of a wait finally getting to the hostess she said about a 45-an hour wait. Ok sure, not to bad. So after waiting an hour we asked the hostess again how much longer and she basically ignores us. Another 30 mins pass and we say something to a different host and he said \"dang, you have been waiting awhile.\" He finally sat us. Sat at the table for 20 minutes before someone came over and took our drink order. Wasn't off to a good start but our waiter, Flash, was pretty good. He is the reason we stayed. He took our orders as fast as he could. The food took FOREVER to finally get to us. Food was good but still can't get over the first hostess lady.

I kindly asked for a booth and they told me there was going to be a wait, which was no problem. They gave us a pager and about 2 minutes later, it went off and we had a booth.\n\nSat down and got our drinks. Waiter wasn't very smiley either. Food came out fairly quickly so no complaints there. I had the shredded BBQ chicken sandwich which left a lot to be desired. Tasted like boiled chicken put into a bun and then BBQ sauce poured over, it wasn't even coated in it. Husband had the steak with \"mixed veggies\". He says the steak was overcooked (even though he asked for medium) and under seasoned and the mixed veggies was just green beans.\n\nMy husband is quite clumsy and spilt an entire soda on our table. Yes, not their fault, it was ours/his but seconds after it was spilt, 3 waiters walked by. My husband said \"sir\" to get the attention of one of them to get us some towels, one of them looked straight into his eyes and they all walked passed, as if they didn't hear him.\n\nWe sat there for a good 5 minutes before anyone even came by our table so we could ask for some napkins.\n\nI told our waiter what happened and he told the manager who gave us 20% off our ticket.

After eating, my elderly mother stepped out of the restaurant to take a phone call, while my father remained at the table. Their waitress ran out of the restaurant and began verbally assaulting my mother, accusing her of trying to dine and ditch, yelling at her in a very crowded street, and profusely embarrassing her. (Again, my father was still at the table). After my mother responded that she wasn't a thief, and was just taking a phone call, the rude and apparently also blatantly racist waitress then brought out a Spanish speaking waiter to talk to my mother. Yes, my mom has an accent but she is a fluent native English speaker. My parents eventually resolved the error- that my dad was still in the restaurant!!!!- and paid the bill, but my mom was so rattled by the aggressive demeanor and accusations of the waitress she lost a bag of expensive gifts in the ensuing chaos. Don't eat at the Hard Rock, their wait staff are racists and had the audacity to charge my parents for their meal after accusing my parents of stealing and humiliating my mother.", "author": "Heather K."}

The twisted Mac and cheese was completely drenched in oil. The bread that came with it was stale. The fajita was really salty but their chicken was good. I liked that they put diced garlic on it.

Bartender was sour faced the entire time having to attend to 8 patrons with the assistance of another bartender. Finally kitchen opened and we were sat at a table that was in a breezy point of the dining room due to an open patio door. After an employee closed it at our request it was constantly propped open after that. Anger oozed out of me since my wife was under the weather.   Last thing. We ordered the souvenir glasses. Originally I ordered a drink to be served in the beer glass. Instead it came in the mason jar, and if you are following along the bill indicated a souvenir mason glass; this was after I explicitly indicated that I wanted the beer glass. When it came time to redeem the glasses the store clerk stated that the beer glass would cost an additional $1. Perplexed at this proposition.

I have been to several locations, with the exception of this one.  We happened to be in SF early in the day for the 4th of July fireworks and the prestart festivities of America's Cup.  We opted to eat here for an early lunch.  \n\nI want to premise this review by stating they were not busy when we arrived.  Having said that, let's start with the fact our waitress took 20 minutes to come take our order or offer drinks.  Meanwhile we watched two other wait staff not only wait on but bring appetizers and drink orders out to people who were seated after us.  We finally asked one of them and they went and got our waitress to get the ball rolling.  Not a good start!\n\nWhen she finally showed up, we ordered our food and drinks all the while feeling like she could not get away from our table fast enough.  Another 25 minutes went by and again after flagging down another employee (this time a busboy busing the table that arrived at the same time we did but apparently was in another waiter's section so they were leaving while we were still waiting for our drinks and food), our waitress appears with our drinks.  The gidgets' drinks were fine and they were happy to have something to sip on while listening to the live music playing on the pier near HRC.  Our drinks on the other hand not so much.  Apparently they had a new bartender. \n\nNo apologies for our wait time or the drinks being off or even acknowledgement that she had not checked in with us unless we had someone go drag her out to our table.  Again, while watching other wait staff efficiently and professionally handle and provide decent service to other people around us.  When we asked about our food, we were advised she would check on it.  20 minutes later she finally appears with it....basically about the time we were ready to walk.  Mind you we still had not gotten the water we asked for when we placed the original order 45 minutes prior, nor had we gotten the correct drinks she had supposedly gone to have the \"new bartender\" make.\n\nBy this point, I was ready to leave; but the kids were enjoying their drinks and food and of course listening to the live band....so against my better judgement we stayed.\n\nBoth my BFF and I had ordered our burgers well done.  What we got was just this side of not mooing.  I was too frustrated to even bother asking our waitress to have the kitchen cook the burger a little longer (that is if we could find another person to drag her back out to us).  When she finally showed up to present the check (not asking if we liked the food since our burgers remained on our plates with only a couple of bites out of them, still no apology for the shoddy service, etc), she waited impatiently as I checked the bill and pulled out my bank card to pay.  Luckily she had amended the check to show our \"mistake\" drinks were taken off.  Once I handed her my card and the check, she scampered off....again to leave us waiting another 10-15 minutes.  \n\nI finally just went and looked for her myself.  In doing so, I approached the hostess stand and had to ask three times for assistance to get someone's attention because they were too busy chatting amongst themselves.  Finally one waiter noticed my growing irritation and asked me what I needed.  I advised him at this point, I would like to see their manager.  He then scampered off to get him.  10 minutes later, our waitress walks over and advises me the manager was busy in the back and sent her to see what I needed.  Oh, and by the way....here is your receipt.  Can you sign it?\n\nNeedless to say, we will NEVER be back to this location.

We were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait, so we decided to kill some time by walking around and watching some of the street performers. \n\nAfter 30 minutes, we go back to check on the table, and we were told we still had a 20-25 minute wait. Definitely not within the time range that we were initially told. \nAfter waiting for close to an hour, we finally got seated at a high table near the bar area. To our surprise, the restaurant was not more than 40% full. One entire section of tables (about 20 tables) was available. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes of sitting down, we saw people entering from the side door - completely bypassing the hostess stand - and sitting down at the tables. Shortly after they sat down, they were brought menus and water and ended up getting their meal roughly around the same time that my husband and I did. On top of that, my husband's burger was flavorless (have had better at a home BBQ) and the fries were burnt. $30 not well spent. \n\nWill not be going back to this location any time soon.", "author": "Sonia D."}

The waiter brought my check I gave him my card. he returned and said that my card was declined, I called the bank who stated I had used my card too many time that day. the manager came to the table and stated that he would give me 50% off of my bill so that I could pay the bill. This had to be the most embarrassing day of my life. I wish I had the managers name he was a very nice & understanding man. He didn't have to do that so Thank you so much.

After a little more than thirty minutes we were seated and then promptly ignored for about ten minutes.\n\nThe waitress seemed absentminded and even downright lost at times. She passed our table at least three times without acknowledging our existence. She could have said \"Be right with you, or I'm sorry I'll be right back.\" Nope and nope.\n\nI got an iced tea and the bf got a beer. Five minutes later my iced tea appeared...no beer. Another five minutes go by when she comes over to take our order. We ask about the missing beer, and she giggles and says \"Oh yeah, right.\" So she leaves to retrieve it before taking our orderer. Nice.\n\nShe comes back with a flat beverage, don't feel like complaining tonight as we are on vacation, then takes our order without writing it down. Here is my problem, Ive been a server for years. Even if you have a good memory you should always write down someones order. Even just to double check or cross reference in case a guest says they order something else, to which you can see that no they did not order what they say because here look, I've written it down.\n\nOur appetizer  takes thirty minutes and then five minutes later the food arrives, lo and behold our order is wrong. AHHH! We have to flag her down for refills, nakpins, and silverware. Its just a disaster. NO sense of urgency from her, and she couldnt care less that we were visibly unhappy.\n\nI'm so irritated at this point that I just want to leave, the food was mediocre at best and then we had to wait forever for the check, and then forever to get change.\n\nMy advice....skip. Its SanFran, there are so many other great options, no need to get treated like crap here.\n\nEDIT**** I keep my review at two stars, as neither the food or service were satisfying. However, the general manager contacted me and apologized for my less than satisfactory visit. He really did try to make amends, and it is clear he cares about his guests. So I just want to say thank you, and also if you have an issue at a restaurant, ask to speak to the manager instead of going home angry and yelping about it later. It is possible your problem can be solved on the spot. Thank you for the consideration Barry.\n\nSECOND EDIT*** My above edit was written because I was witness to some sort of dedication by the general manager of this restaurant to try and make amends for a bad experience. I was promised a gift card in the mail, and although the gesture was nice and really not necessary, he did not follow through. I wrote this review in August and so far it is December and I have not received anything. I find it more rude than anything to promise something and not deliver, it really shows how little you care about the people who come and spend money at your establishment. For this I docked a star, and am seriously disappointed. I never wanted anything, just to voice my opinion, but when you tell someone you are going to do something and dont, that is not okay.", "author": "Sherry M."}

The overall taste was ok, but the meat was a little on the dry side, even though it was baked medium-rare and the fries were even worse, almost cardboard, a little like those you get at Mc Donald's. Without judging them, dry fries are often a sign that the fries aren't freshly baked and reheated.\n\nSo, the service was awesome and the taste of my food was good, but this place would've had at least one additional star if they manage to get quality meat on the patties and nicely baked crusty fries.

While we were seated, I mentioned to the hostess and later to our server that it was my Mom's birthday and I assumed that they would get the hint.\n\nThe Hard Rock Cafe offers a variety of food ranging from BBQ to seafood to burgers. My sister ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with onion rings, which she really enjoyed. My Mom ordered the beer-battered fish and chips and I ordered a cheeseburger with fries, cooked medium. Overall, we all really enjoyed our food but I wouldn't say there was anything about it that stood out. \n\nAfter we were done with lunch, I was expecting that our server would bring over some ice cream for my Mom but there was nothing. Instead, she asked if we would like to see a dessert menu. I was surprised because usually restaurants will bring over a small sundae for people who are celebrating their birthdays. Even at Red Robin they bring you some ice cream! \n\nService was okay - another server took over for our original one, who was going on break, but both didn't check up on us too much. I know we're not tourists, but we're still customers, and I would have appreciated a little more from them. \n\nOverall, if you are in the area or visiting Pier 39, the Hard Rock Cafe is an affordable option.

For some odd reason, the entree came before the appetizers. The twisted Mac and cheese with blackened chicken were barely grilled and not even blackened and didn't come close to what it looks like on the picture in the menu .  The hot chicken wings and twisted Mac and cheese were be supposed to be spicy and were warned by the waitress it was really spicy.  I am a person who doesn't eat spicy food often and I didn't even feel a thing.  More sour than spice.  The potato skins had so little bacon and cheese on it, it was more like a baked potato with cheese sprinkled on.  Waitress also took my plate before I was even done, but just let her take it because I was pretty much done with the place.\n\nFor dessert, ordered a hot fudge sundae.  Barely any fudge and the bottom of the glass was empty.  Manager or whoever, I don't care anymore, said it's supposed to be like that.  Funny because ghiradelli down the street doesn't do that. \n\nOnly came because I had a gift card.  Won't be coming here again and will not recommend visitors to come.

This place has so much memorabilia in it that it felt like I was in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame. Okay, I've never been to the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame but I can only imagine it looks like the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 minus the food, crying babies, and the cute waitresses. Because of this particular location and all the tourists in San Francisco, I was worried about a long wait but it was only about ten-minutes, which I thought was very good for a Saturday at Pier 39 and so the fun began...as we walked to our booth. I immediately recognized that the booth my friend and I sat in was huge. I mean this single booth could seat six people or a dozen midgets (OK that was wrong). \n\nSERVICE:\n\nWe had a waitress who had an attitude like she was about to crazy and throw onion rings if we asked for water with lemon instead of actual drinks but THANK GOD she went on her break and we got some guy who was great. He kept our waters (with lemon) filled to the rim and brought extra napkins and ketchup. I noticed the waiter who waited on our table was very social and sitting at random tables talking to customers. \n\nFOOD:\n\nI had the Turkey Burger with jerk mayo, lettuce, tomato, red onion rings and topped with pepper jack cheese and fresh avocado slices...is was to die for and then come back to life like a ZOMBIE! It was one of the BEST Turkey Burgers I've ever had besides Ford's in Sacramento.\n\nLOCATION:\n\nThis is a great location if you are spending the day at the Piers in San Francisco with family or friends. I would recommend sitting outside (I'll do that next time I go to this Hard Rock Caf\u00e9) to enjoy the lovely San Francisco weather to take in the entire experience of the day. If you want to get away for the heat or sunny (if out), then you'll want to relax inside and watch great music videos on flat screen TV's. It's pretty loud inside so if you plan to have a romantic date with plenty of intimate conversation, then this might not be the place as the music is blasting and you hear a lot of chatter.

We were excited because the burgers are amazing. The hostess team was amazingly sweet. They even sat us a little earlier than promised. Everything was great until we got seated at our table. Our server, Chris, was rude, inattentive and uneducated about his menu. I pointed out that my boyfriend and I had different menus. He tells me that it's due to them making upgrades to the restaurant but everything was the same, but it wasn't. The prices were different as well as the listings. Again, I pointed that out to him and he tells me the \"local legend\"burger was the same as the \"burger of the bay\" despite their listings being different and prices. During me pointing these things out he responded with an attitude and from there our service went downhill. My water was never refilled despite us being there for well over an hour, he never asked us how the meal was and when we pointed out the price on our check was wrong he responds \"I can have the dollar taken off\" and rolls his eyes. This is disappointing because every other hard rock I've been to has been amazing. I will never return to this one again.

I was at the Hard Rock Cafe with my parents and my sister who were visiting me over the holidays; they all have pretty strong accents. \n\nSo in the moment our waitress noticed that we were from Europe, she suddenly stopped giving us good service because at this location (it's located at Pier 39, the most touristy place in SF) they deal with a lot of European tourists and in Europe it just isn't common to give a high tip at restaurants. So she probably thought why make an effort when they won't tip anyway.\nHere's the deal though: along with our bill, we got a piece of paper on which it said in different languages that it is common courtesy to tip waiters here in the US. Furthermore, our waitress circled the gratuity suggestions on our bill with a neon highlighter, almost forcing us to tip at least 15% although the service was really bad. I  think this is behavior is just really rude. I get why they would advise foreign tourists to tip, but then I would like to have an appropriate reason for why I should tip 15-20% and not this kind of poor service! And I saw her being really nice and friendly next to us!\n\nSo if you're from the US, I can't speak for you; but if you have a foreign accent, I would advise you not to visit this place, they might just be rude to you and still demand a good tip.\n\nI would give this location 1 star, but the food was really good and the atmosphere is just wonderful!

We usually go to the HRC in Amsterdam because I crave their veggie burgers and they're the best I've ever had.\n\nNow, as for this HRC. The place is already small and crowded, so noise level is always going to be a problem but don't try to drown everything out with the music. The music is seriously so loud that you have to yell at your server and personally, I feel ashamed of myself and like a douche when I yell at a server. Even if it's only because of the loud music. My second problem with the music: the music. Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus are not, never have been and never will be in any way appropriate to play at the HRC. Seriously, you guys could learn something from the Amsterdam playlists.\n\nAs for the food goes, I figured I'd order something different for once and went with the twisted mac, no meat. Le boyfriend had the turkey burger and we shared the garlic fries and onion rings as sides. I have to say, the garlic fries really were garlic-y (yum!) but drowning in their own grease. The garlic toast that comes with the twisted mac, I wonder if even one molecule of garlic touched the toast. Le sad! I love garlic! The mac and cheese wasn't anything I'd recommend to anyone. Le boyfriend liked his turkey burger, so yay! As for the onion rings. They came out sloppy and slightly raw in the inside, so I sent them back and asked for superextramega crispy. The onion rings return, only slightly crispier. Fine, I liked our server, so I didn't want to be too much of an annoying customer so we kept the still floppy, slightly undercooked onion rings. Such a let down as they are always perfect and super crunchy in Amsterdam.\n\nOne thing that's universal: great drinks!\n\nAs for the service. We're used to the friendly international staff at the Amsterdam HRC. Our server was friendly enough, but others just seemed hurried, cranky and all over the place. Maybe work on some team building and customer service exercises guys? I remember when I worked at a caf\u00e9 that no matter how cranky I was, customers would always see me smiling. Even if I was on dish duty that night. So I think it's important to receive the same kind of service that I would give and it's what I always look for. Everywhere.", "author": "Bekkah R."}

The mac and cheese i ordered as a side for 6.75 was bland and very greasy. I was so disappointed. The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the waiter was attentive and also he talked to his manager about my food and we got it taken off the bill.

The Girlfriend and I have gone there only a few times - when we were pretending to be tourists - and I have to say... the nachos are pretty good, but that is about it. Drink-wise... it's overpriced, and if you're looking for a martini... go elsewhere. The bartender didn't know the difference when I said \"very dry.\" She loaded it with Olive juice and said she thought that I (ME!) didn't know what I wanted, and that I really wanted a dirty martini. If I wanted a dirty martini, I'd have ASKED for a dirty martini. \n\nSan Francisco has so much more in regard to restaurants... unless you really are a die hard fan of Hard Rock Cafes... you can do better than this place.", "author": "Eric P."}

There is just something about calling it the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 that doesn't seem right.  Plus, based on the music that they played when I was in the dinning area, there is not much about the place that is \"Hard Rock.\"\n\nEntering and exiting through the gift shop also sends the wrong message to me.  It's as if the restaurant is just there to supplement the merchandising.\n\nAnyway, onto the \"Hard Rock\"...  We were seated at a cramped little table in the main dining area.  I looked around at the spectacle of \"Hard Rock\" and found it to be a mixed bag.  On the one hand, I really enjoyed seeing guitars signed by guitar wizards such as B. B. King and Eddie Van Halen.  On the other hand, they are just guitars signed by those guys.  It's not as if they were actually used and, on top of that, I question the validity of the signatures.  Now, I have no evidence that they are not genuine, but I was once told that the items in Planet Hollywood were often just reproductions of originals, so why could the same be true in the \"Hard Rock\" Caf\u00e9.\n\nThe meal was priced as expected for a touristy eatery.  The food (a BBQ burger) was okay.  I've had better and at $15 should've been better.  Also, the drink prices were crazy!  It was $10 for a drink or $16 for one in a souvenir glass.  I just wanted a yummy alcoholic beverage.  For that price I could've bought an entire bottle of rum at CVS.\n\nThe service stuck out to me because I'm noticing this trend of waiters/waitresses NOT doing their job completely.  Our waitress introduced herself, then someone else took our drink order.  Our waitress brought the drinks and took our order, then someone else brought the food.  Finally our check was delivered by someone else, but our waitress brought back the credit card slips.  WTF?\n\nI'm in no rush to risk a repeat experience.", "author": "Nick M."}

What good is your food when I already have a bitter taste from your hostess? I've had better service at a MacDonald's drive-thru.\n\nI always knew Hardrock at the Pier was there, but thought it was just another cheesy tourist spot.  After a trip to NYC and eating at Hardrock Times Square (being a tourist, I decided to be cheesy),  I became a big fan.  Food was fantastic!  But, here? From the other reviews it seems as if the food isn't that great.   I wouldn't know.  I wish I could tell you, but I couldn't get pass the rude hostess.  \n\nI tried going here for my birthday.  I knew the wait would take a bit longer than 15 minutes considering it's on the wharf .

At this point, I was like whatever...bad day, chill, I just got here, WTF?  Then when I requested a high-chair for my 2 year old instead of a booster, she again goes \"OOOOH, that will take FORTY-FIVE minutes instead\" and looked (more like glared) at me weird.  45 min wait on a Tuesday early evening? Do you want me to eat here? I guess...NOT because - it wasn't the waiting time that got me, it was her stank attitude.  I was concerned that the rest of the staff would be like this, so I took my business (and their stupid buzzer) elsewhere....like at the end of the pier where they serve shrimp, not attitude.

We went this past Saturday 3/7/15. It was a busy day in the city, the Chinese New Years parade was that night, and the weather felt like a summer day, it was gorgeous. So of course the restaurant was pretty busy. We were told there was up a 20 minute wait. No prob, and we were also asked if we wanted to sit outside or inside, we didn't care we just wanted whatever was available first. There was only 3 of us, My husband, my 2 year old daughter, and me. We waited, and they sat us on the patio. We were partially in the sun, but we didn't care, we just needed to eat. By this time it's about 1pm. So we look over the menu, got my daughter situated. There were not many people on the patio, maybe 7 tables, one of which was a party of six, but the rest were 2 tops. We sat and waited, and waited, and waited. There were two servers working the patio, and neither one of them ever even acknowledged us. No one said, \"I'll be right with you\" or anything. It was literally like we were invisible! It was bizarre. After waiting 20 MINUTES, we left. I was so pissed, and hungry, and my poor daughter was starving! We ended up getting hot dogs right in front of the restaurant. We just needed to eat, and my daughter needed something. It was unbelievable. Like I said, I'm a server and I have a lot of patience and understanding, but this was ridiculous.

Waiting waiting waiting meanwhile my family has finished their entire meal. They even ate slow but what let their food get cold. 35 minutes later I received my steak. Really!!! I was so po\"d at this point I asked for a box. The manager came and gave lip service. Worst ever.

My image was that It's the kind of faux-trendy, noisy, overpriced place I hate.\n\nBut the day was GORGEOUS, we were hungry, and my friends wanted  to eat here.  \n\nAlthough the patio was 2/3 empty, we still had to put our names on a list and wait--god knows for what.   The staff seemed pretty disorganized despite Borg-like ear implants so the members of the hive could signal each other.   In fact, the inside was a LOT like a hive--dark, crowded, humming with the noise of harried worker bees servicing  the gaping maws of tourists.  Gave me the shivers.\n\nAs for our own gaping maws, 5-10 minutes later we were sunning ourselves and giving orders to the waitress.   The hamburgers are a ridiculous $15!!!  But then my friends produced their secret weapons: two-for-one hamburger coupons.  \n\nAnd you know what?  HRC serves a pretty damn fine tasty burger--excellent beef, perfectly grilled.   A good value for $7.50.   Because a $15 hamburger is a sin against nature.  \n\nNaturally we tipped the waitress 18% on the PRE-COUPON price (because tipping on the post-coupon price is a slimy thing to do). \n\nSo come on a nice day, eat on the patio, bring a coupon.

Worked there for a summer, made a shit-ton of cash in two and a half months at the expense of losing five years of my life to stress. \n\nI have been working in the restaurant business for most of college and never had i experienced such a work-place. The Hard Rock is a mega-chain, and they treat their employees AND customers as expendable assets rather than valued individuals.\n\nI am a slight foodee and i have a unique opportunity distributing food to customers. If i love the food, its easier to sell, and to recommend quality items. I had a bit of a tough time here. The food is fake, bland, and over portioned. The burgers however, are quite good, if you can fork out 15 bucks for 6 ounces of fury.\n\nTurn down the music also, few clients in that place speak english so taking their order is hard enough. No parking for employees of the Pier either. Its either a 1 1/2 hour muni ride, or 18 bones a day for parking. Thank goodness i was making over 150 dollars a day.\n\nI hate to bash the place so much, because i did enjoy the management, and my co-workers. Although the run an air-tight ship, they are pretty friendly. I don't mean to contradict myself when i made the comment about feeling expendable, but the managers have people to answer to which i understand. I just wish the share-holders focused a bit more on customer service, and a bit less on being money hungry.\n\nwell, looks like i just wrote a review based on corporate not this hard rock itself.", "author": "Peter T."}

After about 15 more minutes and nobody paying attention to us no drink refills no clearing dirty plates. We finally tracked down someone who had to write a new bill to charge us. I went up to the hostess station asked to speak to the manager. A very rude woman said \"what's the issue?\" I said first of all our food was horrible and no birthday wish which in my eyes is very rude......-and it's taken almost 30 minutes to get our bill. Lady said to me very rude \"that's all?\" \"I don't get the reason for you to complaints\" Finally a manager came out and was very nice and understanding but was to late.

There were only 3 instead of 5 chicken strips on a plate, telling us she dropped 2 on the floor and will bring 2 more.  OK, accidents happen.  She then apologized that my meal was not ready and asked me to refresh her memory on what I ordered.  I told her the club sandwich.  At that point I knew that my sandwich was not turned in with the others; that it was not even written down.  The others were half way through their meals when my lunch arrived.  The bacon on my sandwich was RAW - not limp and greasy, not undercooked - it was RAW!  At that point and knowing how long it takes the kitchen I just sent it back, saying that I didn't want it or anything else.  The manager did come over and it was taken off the bill.

Were delicious but maybe 4-6 oz of chicken tops - $21 which I thought was high for the amount of chicken.The kids meals were $7.50 each and were very generous in portion sizes, however. Loved the atmosphere and that is why we ate there - waitress was slow. Sat for 18 minutes with empty drinks and had to wait 10 minutes to tell her about the raw burger. So 2 stars for the Hard Rock Cafe.", "author": "mary a."}

Valerie was very cool and very informative. \nI then went to the dining area to get seated.  My waitress was Collette: friendly, very cute, and perky (but not to the point of making you want to puke).  I showed her the ad/coupon I received and printed.  She knew about it and said it wasn't limited to one type of burger, but to any burger in the menu.  I chose the mushroom swiss burger.  I kept myself busy watching the Lions/Raiders game while waiting for the food.  The wait wasn't bad.. only about 15 minutes, I think. \nA young Carlos Santana-looking server brought the order to me. \nThe burger was REALLY good.  Okay, honestly, I wouldn't say it was $15 good if I paid full price for it, but it was still good.  The fries were cooked just right without the over-abuse of a salt shaker.  And the Pepsi.. was a Pepsi. \nCollette approached a few times during my meal, quite politely each time, informing me of their 'Imagine' gift line and asking the usual  food okay?/need anything? walk-bys. \nThe total on the promo meal was $4.34 and I left a $5.00 tip.  Hey, it's Christmas time and Collette was very cool.  That plus restaurants usually want you to tip according to the regular price, anyway. \nLike I said, the food and drinks are good only if you don't mind splurging or got a deal like I did.", "author": "Paul V."}

We had just finished walking through the Aquarium of the Bay and decided on burgers and fries downstairs. I figured HRC would be simliar to TGIF or Chili's. *BUZZ!!* wrong answer.\n\nThe prices were much more steep than I would have thought. A Cheese burger was$14.00. An entree was between 20-24 dollars. Are you effin' kidding me.  You can get entrees for that price at 4 star restaurants. I got nachos for $11.95 and an added side of chicken was $4.50. I had about 14 cubes of chicken, which came out to be about .30 cents per cube of chicken, and the nachos weren't even all that good. \n\nOn top of the food and prices, we had to wait forever to get our entrees, and when they finally did arrive they were cold. My father-in-law almost went postal after receiving his club sandwich slathered with mayonnaise, after asking for NO mayo. The waiter kindly asked if he wanted the kitchen to make another sandwich, but he was so hungry, he ended up eating it.\n\nThe saving grace, if there really is one, are the drinks. Free refills of bloody mary for $13.99 + you can take the souvenir glass home. If I wasn't the D.D. for the day, oh my, I would have left HRC ten times happier.", "author": "Robin K."}

No problem just they dont have a speaker system to announce names. In fact the girl was kinda not doing much of her job. When we went back after half an hour to check the list because it seemed like barely anyone was waiting she said shed take us next since no one else was waiting.

I forgot his name but he did an AMAZING job. Got our drinks and food right away and perfect. We were half way done when we met our actual waitress who introduced herself.

It was easy enough to make the reservations online; everything was fine. They had a section to write notes or comments, like needing separate checks. We made the reservations at least 3 weeks ahead. We got there when it was our reservation time (on a side note: it was funny seeing all the tourists staring at us all dressed up). The hostess lady was not friendly when I approached her about my group arriving. She asked what the name was on the reservation in an snappy fashion, which we thought was quite odd, since you'd think a hostess would be a little more chipper. So she tells me to follow this guy to the table, but then he gave the menus to another lady without informing us, so I'm glad I was watching, because my group wasn't. So this new lady was nice, and directed us to the small round tables along the edge of the bar. Yes, the small round tables. Tables that could only sit 4 people each. We are a group of 14. Wouldn't you expect to be able to have everyone sit together at a long table? Apparently not here. If our party was too big to be accommodated as one group, we should have been called and alerted about this. They had other tables that would have been perfect to combine and accommodate our group. However, they said those tables were already reserved for other groups. Later, we saw another prom group sitting at those tables.\nEveryone in my group was standing around looking at each other confused, like what the heck is going on... To make it worse, it was my duty to make the reservation, so everyone was looking at me, wondering why it was set up this way. They did not inform me ahead of time this would be the dinner set up. If we knew, we definitely wouldn't have made a reservation here. Plus, we could have eaten better food that's reasonably priced somewhere else. Why would we wanna isolate ourselves from each other? Granted, you wouldn't be able to talk to everyone at a long table, but having everyone sit together has a better vibe. Our server came, and he wasn't much nicer than the hostess. He wasn't friendly, and he was rude when he was explaining the different types of burgers. I asked about the sizing, there are 6 oz and 10 oz sizes, but I didn't know that. How am I supposed to picture the sizing in my head based off ounces? Since I had no idea really what size to get (I wasn't even hungry at this point since I was in such a bad mood) I asked him what he suggested, since usually waiters are nice and recommend things, but he just said bluntly with attitude, \"Well, it depends on how hungry you are.\" K, thanks. Whatever. Also, one of my friends ordered a Shirley Temple, but it never arrived so she had to ask for it again.\n\nHe seemed stressed out. But come on, this is the Hard Rock on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. There are thousands of people coming and going. Our group didn't even ask for any odd food or drink requests. The only \"complicated\" thing was getting separate checks, but they had a good system down for that (each person of my group was a number on the receipt and we passed it along and paid the amount due.) I did not like that the tip was already calculated, since some of us agreed the service was mediocre at best.\n\nBut seriously, why would they separate our group? At least without notifying us ahead of time? I guess next time I plan to make a reservation here, I'll have to make a specific request, even though you shouldn't have to. But there won't be a next time for me so I won't have to worry for that.\nEating here started us off on the wrong foot, but thank god we all forgot about this place after we got to the dance.\nI don't like writing bad reviews, but this dinner fiasco pissed me and everyone else off.\n Definitely never going here again.", "author": "Nick B."}

My co-diner ordered a large Anchor Steam and a diet coke.\n\nTen minutes later, she returned with one beer and set it in front of my friend. \"Which one is this?\" I asked her...\"Umm, a Stella? No Anchor Steam? Umm I think its the Stella.\" What???\n\nAfter a taste test session to figure it out, I ask her for the other drinks. She informs me they do not carry Fernet. How does any bar survive in SF without at least a small stash of the goods?? SF is one of the largest Fernet markets in the nation!! So I got over it and ordered a shot of Jack.\n\n15 minutes later we got all the drinks right and promptly requested the check.\n\nMy message to the tourists...just stick to buying the T-shirt and heading elsewhere for food and drink.\n\nOur first waiter was great though, wish I remembered his name!!", "author": "Lynsey C."}

They were kind and let us know we there was a 15 minute wait for a party of five. No biggie, we decided to walk around and check out some of the memorabilia. \n\nOur 15 minutes was up, and then we followed a hostess to a table. Our server, Jason, greeted us shortly after being seated and got our drink order. He returned shortly with our drinks, and then proceeded to take our orders. He was exceptionally courteous, and very friendly with my little brother and sister. Our food took slightly longer then we had expected, but our server kept us entertained with some light conversation. He apologized for the wait for our food once it got to the table, and got us a few remaining items we wanted with our meal.\n\nThe food was overall very tasty. Everyone but myself had burgers and enjoyed them thoroughly. I had the mac and cheese with chicken, which was very tasty as well, but I felt as though I wouldn't fit through the exit when I left.\n\nOverall the experience was great, and when we leave on our trip we plan on checking to see if there's a Hard Rock cafe we can visit.", "author": "David M."}

I remember opening day of the 1st San Francisco Hard Rock at Van Ness and Clay when  the lines that formed daily for decades and still form, because what they do, they do extremely well.  Restaurants, single or multi unit, that last more than ten years are doing a lot of things right, and Hard Rock might be one of the best multi unit restaurants that has stayed true to their mission while innovating and developing products and ideas that attract and keep their enormous audience.\n\nSo let's get down to brass tacks, the burger.  I'm going to factor in the whole experience, not to justify what some call a pricy menu, because the Hard Rock is about entertainment that appeals to every age and demographic known to man.  So looking at the simple but hunger pain inducing menu was perfect accompaniment to the music, rock and roll artwork and authentic historic relics collected from so many great performers.  So we're having a great time already and our waitress appears and in her sexy way asks if we're ready for a drink.  I was going to order an Arnold Palmer Iced Tea but overheard a guy nearby order a Bobby Boemer so I asked what made it different and she said instead of lemonade, they added about 20% Cranberry juice to the tea and WOW, what a great, perfectly sweetened drink.  They've got a full bar with good wine and beer lists to boot and plenty of stuff that appeals to kids.\n\nBack to the burger, again!  I ordered their signature which is a 10 oz. patty of really good beef cooked to order with 2 slices of cheddar on a toasted, unseeded made to order bun.  Fries came with the burger and it was a generous portion that were hot and perfectly crisp on the outside and perfectly semi soft on the inside.  The fresh onion, tomato and lettuce with some sliced pickle chips were on the side of the open faced burger so they kindly leave the customer in charge of finishing the presentation to their own preferences.  Condiments were also on the side and all I wanted on this big, beautiful baby was some good mayo which they provided in a generous ramekin.  I put some mayo on the bun top and put it together for my 1st bite, and damn, it was so good.  Quality beef cooked perfectly in harmony with the cheese, bun, produce and condiments served with crisp, hot fries is almost the perfect meal for this burger guru, and the Hard Rock version really ROCKS...if you're searching for a really top notch burger, when was the last time you went for a Hard Rock burger?", "author": "Stu S."}

I don't need to get rip roaring drunk on one drink or end up staggering out of the place slurring about how much I love my friends, but seriously, these drinks were lame. \n\nWe had some burgers here that were okay. The nachos were cold and unpleasant. It's Hard Rock, should I really expect more? The only other Hard Rock I've been to was in Amsterdam and it was just as bad. There, I got smacked in the head by an unsecured window when a sudden gust of wind blew through the restaurant. Their idea of good customer service in that event was to move me & hubby to another table. They promptly sat some different tourists at the window table. I think it was a conspiracy to punish tourists who only go there because nothing else is open in the middle of the day. \n\nWell, I guess that Hard Rock is off my list of joints to try. If I'm going to do chain places I'll stick to Chili's.", "author": "Denise L."}

What is that entree, you ask?  It was the twisted mac'n cheese (which is listed as the twisted mac, cheese, and chicken, but since I do not mix meat with dairy, I always order it without the chicken).  A bit spicy the first time I ordered it, but it was really not that bad as long as I had enough lemonade to wash it down.  \n\nThis Hard Rock is located in Pier 39, one of my favorite places to go in San Francisco, so if the mood strikes, grab a bite at the Hard Rock and then walk off the calories around the pier :)", "author": "Dana B."}

SF doesn't strike me as a place that would be super excited to see a hard rock cafe (especially at pier 39. out of all places in the city to put one lol). \n\nit's pretty crowded in here. not that there are a bunch of people waiting to eat but you have the tourists wandering in and out of the store and restaurant. the hostess doesn't really facilitate the people to stay in one area (which she shouldn't i guess) so it gets really shuffle-ly when you're waiting to get seated or taking a look around. \n\ni really appreciated how they were really accomodating for my daughter. we had her in a stroller and they offered to keep our stroller off to the side in the front while we ate so we didn't have to lug it to our table. the service was fast and friendly too. as for the food.... a little pricey. i think the cheapest thing is 12.99 for a pulled pork sandwich. i dropped 15 dollars for their granny smith burger, TOTAL WIN! SOOO GOOD..... BUT my husband felt ripped off. his cajun burger wasn't phenomenal, not bad... but not 15 dollars good. he should have got what i got. freakin' apple burger..... mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\ni didn't use the restroom while i was there. looking around i actually couldn't see it from where i was sitting so i just held it in. lol. my husband went to the bathroom and was pissed... THERE WAS A LINE! when is there ever a line for the guys' bathroom?! he was upset. \n\nall in all... i guess i would come back. it's a pretty cool place, not the most comfortable though. my husband says he'll order the apple burger to go next time.", "author": "Abi U."}

Why would a burger cost so much in a not so upscale restaurant?? Our potato skins arrive about 15 minutes after we ordered it - which I guess isn't so bad in a semi busy restaurant. They were crispy, cheesy & lacking bacon - it had maybe a couple spinkles of bacon - I prefer more!! Anyway, so my SOB burger raved about a \"spicy chitpole\" sauce with gucamole. So can anyone tell me why my gucamole was brownish instead of the usual green? Ahh must be cuz they don't know how to throw some citrusy juice in it like typical gucamole? It's not rocket science! And another thing, why did  my spicy chitpole sauce lacking spice? Granted, I did have the roasted pepper taste, however no bite!

If it's out of your price range, then it's not the HRC for you. . . we had a great time here. The staff was busy but somehow was able to fit in all of our orders in a timely manner. They also knew we had a (less-than) 1 year old with us so they were able to fit a shaded area outside (under the cover) for us . . . we were coming down from a lot of activity just before so, although some of us were hungry, we were happy to have a nice shaded place to sit and so by the time the meal arrived it seemed like perfect timing. The views along the walk were great and the staff was attentive (considering the HUNDREDS of customers there, or so it seemed) to all of us . . . we got the bill, paid, and I was happy to leave an appreciative tip. I'd definitely patronize this HRC again (which was quite unlike the East coast HRC's I've visited before, from DC all the way down to FL) . .. HRC, An institution !", "author": "Mark W."}

I just want to say that I think the Hard Rock Cafe's drinks are too expensive, but they do have good bands there like Dazed and Confused, my friend's Led Zeppelin tribute band.", "author": "Sarah G."}

Two stars for our server because she was very friendly, outgoing, and made my friend's birthday dinner enjoyable. I wasn't in the mood for a burger,fries, grease, onion rings, or any of that fried stuff. The only other alternative was a salad or pasta. I ordered some sort of seafood pasta and it was around $24.00.  Of course, knowing me, I picked a dish that wasn't satisfying. The portion was tiny, and all I could remember were a lot of random vegetables and mushrooms which made up the bulk of the plate. I give them credit for giving me five pieces of shrimp, but still for $24.00, it was definitely not worth it. I can pay $25 for a rib eye steak with mashed potatoes at Tony's Steakhouse  for a DOLLAR more. I was quite dissapointed, and didn't really like the ambiance either. Obviously, this place is aimed towards tourists, so I didn't have high hopes going here. I don't understand why people go here when they could choose any other restaurant in the pier known for their fresh seafood entrees. After dinner was over, I had to eat a second meal because I was STILL hungry =(", "author": "leanna w."}

Any time my husband and I go out of town we search for the nearest one and try it out. Unfortunately this location did not meet up to other locations I have visited, which is quit a few. Don't get me wrong the food was great, it was the service that left a dissatisfying taste in my mouth. Our waitress treated us though we were taking up her time as though she had  better places to be. Not once did she ask us for a refill and when we asked for one it was as though we annoyed her. I don't think 1 refill is too annoying on a  $60 bill. Let just say after she took our order and huffed after we asked for a refill we never saw her again.", "author": "Faith H."}

I haven't been there for over a year now but when I did eat there Janis Joplin's guitar was at the entrance.  I was sold no matter how slow the service was.

It was hot and it was tasty!!! I highly recommend the nachos. The reason that I am giving this 3 stars is as follows: this employee who looked like a troll came to our table and tried to take our picture to sell us a photo and she got offended when we declined. she gave us a dirty look when we left. I do not like the set up of this place--its too dark, too cramped, music is way too loud. I miss the location on Van Ness all the time--for it was not cramped, well lit, and i loved the way they displayed the memorabillia. I will eat here again though", "author": "alexandria s."}

I usually don't check out Hard Rocks, as I think they are cheesy, touristy, and don't have good cuisine.  However, I came here for a Grammy Party, and it was a blast.  They had a great DJ, cool band, great service, and a fun atmosphere.  Now, I know that every day is not a Grammy party day (and especially not an open bar and free food event).  However, the food I had was actually tasty.  It was the usual bar food:  chicken tenders, chicken wings, taquitos, burgers, pulled pork sandwiches, ahi salad, etc.  Well, maybe the last two items are not typical bar food.  Anyhow, it was actually pretty darn good.  One server really stood out to me, his name is Ernie.  He was so friendly, helpful, happy, and provided amazing service.  So Ernie if you ever read this, thank you.  I did take a look at the menu, and I do think food here is way overpriced.  So... 3 stars for the restaurant itself, and 4 stars for the experience I had.

The marks that bring it down is the service.  They tend to take a long time to serve you.  It's such a busy place that you might as well have your order ready alongside any appetizers/drinks to save longer wait times.  Sometimes the waiters are in such a rush they don't listen to you.  The last waiter messed up my order (burger) in 2 ways - both on the same visit!  He ordered the wrong burger for me and he even didn't cook it to medium-well even though the menus are printed that all orders are cooked medium-well as default!  I ended up getting my burger well done - what a sad way to ruin decent meat.  I ended up eating the burger that I didn't even order because I didn't want the rest of the order we received to go cold while we wait for the new order.  I tip fairly but this one deserved the bad tip I gave him.", "author": "David D."}
