I got the Panang Curry Nuer (beef) and it was....wonderful!  Just like I remembered it from years back -- maybe even better.  Just the right flavor, spice, and even a perfect hint of mint.  Love the beef stew cubes, which don't contain a bit of fat.  Love that they use eggplant, an excellent complement.  They also use green bell pepper, but I'm not a fan of that so I asked them to leave that out.  It is hard to find my very favorite Thai curry that also uses stew beef chunks, Massaman, anywhere in the city, or at least made well (including here, because they have a permanent special, Massaman chicken, which I'm not a fan of), so the Panang here is definitely a great substitution.  The dish was truly satisfying.\n\nUnfortunately, still staying away from the items I didn't care much for in my very first review from 2014, I will definitely come back for my other two faves from last review, the Pad Himmaparn and Praram.\n\nWith these years passing, the old crew of servers have long gone.  The new fellows are nice, if not as personable.  Place was pretty empty for dinner but I'm sure has more people for lunch or when a convention is in town.", "author": "Merrick W."}

There was half a dozen vegetarian items on the lunch special & 9 vegetarian items on the regular menu that served the needs of this vegan.\n\nWe ordered family style sharing for an appetizer both the Golden Triangles & the Crispy Tofu. The Golden Triangles were stuffed w/ Thai yellow squash, potatoes, fresh corn, red yams, & Thai herbs served w/ a sweet & sour sauce. The Crispy Tofu was deep fried tofu served also w/ a sweet & sour sauce. \n\nI loved the Golden Triangles as were flavorful filled w/ an assortment of the above mentioned veggies. I would recommend them as an appetizer to share & the Crispy Tofu was quite alright.\n\nFor my entree I ordered off the regular menu the Pad-Hed-Ruam-Mit  Vegetarian which included Saut\u00e9ed fresh mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, deep-fried tofu, yellow onions, green onions, & vegetables with garlic & Thai herb sauce. I had this w/ a side order of brown rice.\n\nI requested some hot sauces on the side. I loved the visual aesthetic of the containers the hot sauces were stored in as they were unique vases as opposed to typical metal containers that most Thai restaurants have.\n\nMy entree was enjoyable as felt the unique mushrooms really made the dish. The dish wasn't particularly spicy as the flavor came mainly from the mushrooms. I did add some of the assortment of hot sauces to kick up the heat a bit. \n\nOne of my friends ordered the same entree I did & enjoyed it while my other friend ordered a vegan version of the Pad Thai coming w/ rice noodles with tofu, bean sprout, roasted ground peanuts and lime juice. I tried his Pad Thai & was quite alright.\n\nService was attentive. Our timing was perfect as just as we were leaving a business party of nearly 30 people showed up. They were enjoying the amenities of the full bar & preparing to sit down as the server joined countless tables together to prepare for the coming group. \n\nAs it was a Friday afternoon they were kicking their weekend off as they were a bit loud getting ready for a festive lunch to kick off their weekend.\n\nI look forward to returning here for lunch & will look to try one of the curries next time.", "author": "Shane S."}

I work in the hospitality industry so I can understand that sometimes, hotels, restaurants have bad days. Whether its due to being short staffed or being overly busy. I get it, because I've lived it and even poor experiences I try not to take to heart. But this place took the cake. I arrived to a very dead restaurant so hey that's fine maybe I won't have to wait so long. 4 tables being used in the entire restaurant with mine being one of them. Ordered an entree and a beer. Took over 20 mins to get the entire, but whatever its fine, maybe the kitchen is backed up. I start to notice that the tables they are being attentive to happen to have people in suits. I was not dressed in a suit, I wear one all day so I wanted to be super comfy and causal. I felt as if I was being treated like a second class citizen because of it. Entree finally comes but no beer, cool no worried maybe they forgot or the server didn't hear me. 5 minutes later flag them down and asked for the beer, beer comes I finish my entree and then the check comes. I wasn't done with my beer, I actually wanted another. I was even going to ask for dessert but bringing me the check this like this, means you want me to leave. OK fine, I'll go and never go back. No one checked in, no one bother to ask about anything. I leave incredibly upset. So please don't go here.

There are some really good food places there, but a lot of them then - and even more of them now - are high-priced new-American joints that are great for date night but just not my jam, nor a good option for a bachelor on a schedule to get a solid dinner. That's the other undoing of this neighborhood - a surprising number of places close earlyish, especially as you get north closer to FiDi. \n\nCha-Am is a wonderful exception to that. At the time, a younger, less-experienced me would call it the best thai food I've had. Now, I know that the truly delicious Thai is in the TL and out west, but Cha-Am surely fits the bill and definitely beats anywhere nearby. It's also one of the cheapest dinners in SOMA. \n\nLast time I was there, I had their red curry with flank steak (Pa-neang-neua) and OMG was it delicious. May've found a new addiction. Their Pad Thai is solid too, if not write-home-level. Will for sure be back when I'm in the neighborhood.", "author": "Chris S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-03", "description": "Not to be mean, but in a way, it feels like time (and SF) is starting to pass Cha-Am by.  The look of the restaurant is definitely more modern than some of the neighborhood spots in the Sunset and Richmond, but the vibe of the place feels like it's stuck in the late 90's/early 00's.  Especially with the 15 year old news articles and plaques on their walls and, despite having been around for so long, the surprisingly low number of reviews on Yelp.  If nothing else, I'm clearly on discovering Cha-Am!\n\nWalking in, it wasn't a shock to see that the restaurant was mostly empty.  For one, the ever popular Osha Thai has a location right across the street (which is usually busy).  Secondly, and perhaps more significantly, the menu (and the food) isn't particularly exciting.  Not bad, but not exciting.  Outside of what I assume is their specialties board, as well as a handful of entrees, the majority of the menu is made of your usual mix of starters, noodles, fried rice, curries, and entrees.\n\n-- CHICKEN WINGS - Deep Fried Chicken Wings Sauteed with Pepper Garlic Sauce and served with a Sweet & Sour Sauce...$7.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cha-am-san-francisco?select=KNP3AZrUFXI6EDNm1c6Emg)\nEasily the best thing we had.  They're kind of like Angel Wings, but slightly different.  The wings were slightly crispy, yet juicy through and through, but the pepper garlic sauce was what really stood out.  The mix of flavors was so good, I didn't even use the sweet & sour sauce!  That said, I could've used less of the garnishments and carrots there were thrown in.\n\n-- MASSAMAN CHICKEN - Housemade Massaman Curry with Chicken, Tomato, Onion, Peanut, Potato, Bell Pepper, and Coconut Milk...$15.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cha-am-san-francisco?select=rNfNVXrZgMDLNcaKu2QMKw)\nI was the most hopeful for this one (it's on their \"specials board\"), but it disappointed.  The chicken and veggies were more or less fine, though I wasn't a fan of the tomatoes.  However, the curry was more runny than creamy/rich and the taste of it wasn't that dynamic or intense, except for a lot of star anise, which I kept biting into.\n\n-- PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE with Pineapple, Cashew Nuts, Eggs, Onion, Garlic, and Thai Herbs with Choice of CHICKEN, Pork, Beef, or Prawns (+$1.00)...$12.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cha-am-san-francisco?select=SP-2qhW96-mdzlpKj89cvw)\nReally meh, to be honest.  While I appreciated all of the different components, there was a little too much going on.  Peas, carrots, cashews...everything just kind of muddled each other up and felt more like a stir-fried dish with rice than fried rice.  That said, I did like the acidity and sweetness that the pineapples added.\n\n-- PAD THAI - Stir-fried Sticky Rice Noodles with Tofu, Egg, Bean Sprouts, Roasted Ground Peanuts, and Lime Juice Palm Sugar Sauce with choice of PORK, Chicken, Beef, Veggie & Tofu, or Shrimp (+$1.00)...$10.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cha-am-san-francisco?select=H67ShmpFV09N6XiB91RBRQ)\nWhile I'm not sure pork was the best option, the rest of the dish was more or less okay.  The portion was a little small (lots of sprouts), but the rest of the flavors were pretty standard.  The sauce had a nice mix of sweet and acidic flavors and I liked how the noodles weren't super gummy.  \n\nAlthough the food may not amaze, given how quiet this place was on a Saturday night (only two people walked in after us to pick up take out orders), Cha Am might be a decent pick for something quick, hassle free, and relatively cheap (for the area).  Otherwise, for something tastier, there's no question the likes of Kin Khao, Lers Ros, Thai Tycoon, and Osha Thai are better bets.", "author": "Mike L."}

First of all, the prices are just as expensive as OSHA Thai but the ambiance and the service is lackluster. We went on a Sunday evening and it was not crowded at all - 3 tables total including myself and my family. There were 2 servers and one decided to just hang out by the bar area station and look at his phone. We asked for another table setting for my daughter and never got it. So I decided to get a table napkin and spoon from another table (the sever saw me but didn't get the hint). Then it took about 20 min to get our order and wondered why it took so long for one of the 2 servers to come by. When we finally ordered and got our food, it was terrible. The papaya salad we ordered was too citrusy - they totally poured lemon juice all over it that overpowered the taste - seemed like they were masking for a missing ingredient. The pad-sew-ew we ordered had soggy noodles and included cabbage (strange)?  The Thai fried rice had cauliflower and other vegetables (tasted like it came out of a frozen bag of vegetables). We didn't finish the food and didn't take it to go. And at least have better tentative service. Not worth it for all the other places you can check out for Thai food.", "author": "Cliff H."}

We had ordered delivery from Cha-Am before and it was pretty good. We had gotten the basics the first time (chicken sa-tay, papaya salad, and pad-see-ew) and everything was tasty, although certainly not the best Thai we had ever eaten. Last night's order, however, failed to match our previous experience by a long shot. We ordered the golden triangles, papaya salad, pad kee mow, and pak-pak (mixed vegetables in a garlic-herb sauce). The food arrived on time, but the rest of the dining experience went downhill from there. The golden triangles were a hardened mass of potatoes; I honestly could not taste any other ingredients. The papaya salad was good, but the portion was very small. Half of the container was just undressed mixed greens. The pad kee mow was the best item that we ordered; even though I thought there were way too many bell peppers, the beef was well cooked. The mixed vegetable dish was by far the most disappointing. The vegetables looked like the ones you get from the frozen food section at the grocery store, and tasted super bland. The sauce, if you can call it that, was almost clear and had hardly any flavor. We picked at it a bit before totally giving up and throwing it away. We will definitely be more careful the next time we're choosing a Thai restaurant to order from.", "author": "Regina L."}

I know that's typically an easier thing with Thai food than with other cuisines, but I find it even easier at Cha-Am. I don't feel guilty about it, like I'm insulting the chef(s) or ruining the dish. It's nice to have that peace of mind. \n\nI'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I tend to find that their spiciness rules (mild-medium-hot) are kind of hit or miss. As in, mild sometimes tastes like nothing, and sometimes it's five alarms and 10 glasses of water later I'm whimpering in the corner. I'm not a wimp! I promise! And this will be on the same dish, two different times. All in all though -- this is not a huge deal to me. In fact, it's kinda fun. ;)", "author": "Amber G."}

It's a typical local Thai restaurant and so we ordered the spicy red curry with beef flank, pad thai, and a couple of thai iced teas.\n\nThe spicy red curry was delicious! Perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of spicy and sweet. The pad thai was also quite flavorful as well.\n\nThey charge you $1.50 for a small bowl of rice and had to order 2 bowls just for the curry alone. Also, the wait was a little long even though we were the only two patrons in the restaurant.\n\nThe food is good though, it's close to our place so good neighborhood spot for thai if you are sick of osha or tara.", "author": "Betty C."}

Whenever I go, is usually with some coworkers either to grab a quick bit to eat or to celebrate someone's birthday before going back to the office to labor the day away. Of the times I've visited, the food here is palatable. \n\nOn my every visit, I try to order different dishes on their huge menu selection from appetizers, to stirred fried and soup noodles, rice dishes, ala cart dishes and specials of the day so I can sample everything. Among the variety of dishes I tried so far, I am quite satisfied. \n\nThe Green Mango Salad appetizer is made with julienned of green mangos, poached shrimps, mixed green salads, red onions and dressed in a tangy and slightly spicy lime dressing. It is a taste bud teaser and the tanginess makes you hungry for your entr\u00e9e. \n\nPad Kee Mao (Thai drunken noodle) is delicious rice noodles stirred fried in a spicy sauce with onions, bells peppers, Thai basils, and meat of your choice. There is a bit of spice in this dish so stay away if you can't handle or do not like spicy dishes. Apparently this is the Thai version of hangover food. If you had one too many drinks the night before, this dish will cure that hangover. Hence the name Thai drunken noodles. \n\nPad Thai - the typical and most popular stirred fried noodles in every Thai restaurant is passable and nothing extraordinary to report. The portion of Pad Thai is very generous in this restaurant. \n\nChicken with green or red curry served with rice. The curry is served piping hot with onions, bamboo shoots, bell peppers and meat of your choice and came with a side of steamed jasmine rice. The curry broth is creamy and has a great coconut flavor and a nice spicy kick to it. \n\nI had also sampled other dishes that my coworkers ordered like Tom Yum Soup with shrimps, fish cakes appetizer, Penang Curry, and Thai crab fried rice. Overall, the food is not bad for lunch crowd. \n\nThe also has a bar, which I suspect they do lots of business during happy hour or after business hours and being so close to the Moscone Center, they must get a lot of tourists. The restaurant has great acoustic so quiet enough that you can have a conversation without having to raise your voice even when the restaurant is packed. \n\nI will definitely come back to Cha-am not only because is walking distance from my office, but because they serve decent Thai dishes with affordable prices and the services is comparable.", "author": "Gourmet Princessa L."}

You have to give this place a shot because it is so different from the rest. \n\nYou would never believe it but they have very good raw oysters here.

It was late, we were tired, this restaurant was conveniently located directly adjacent to the Moscone center and we both generally love Thai so we figured, what could go wrong? Famous last words...\n\nI easily had the most awkward service I've ever had in my life at this restaurant. We sat down and immediately ordered drinks and appetizers to buy ourselves some time to decide on the entr\u00e9e. Our waitress took our orders, but when we asked to hold on to a menu while we deliberate on the main course, she told us she had to take our menus to take our orders. Why do you have to take our menus? What reason could you possibly have? We just wound up ordering the our appetizers (again) later with our entr\u00e9e.\n\nThe appetizers we ordered were soft shell crab tempura and prawn satay. The soft shell crab tempura was pretty good, but frankly its very difficult to get deep fried crab wrong. The prawn satay on the other hand, was very bizarre. I expected prawns on skewers and covered in satay sauce, but instead we received prawns caked in a flat, rectangular fishcake patty on skewers and covered in sauce. What was up with the fishcake patty? Not only would prawns on a stick have been perfectly acceptable, but the fish cake also had the texture and elasticity of rubber, which was pretty gross.\n\nI also had the tom yum goong, which was tasty, but not nearly spicy enough. The soup was by no means bad, and its just barely nudging me over from giving this place a one star rating, but it was disappointing. Meanwhile my friend ordered a curry dish that was way too dry. She couldn't finish it, but it wasn't even worth packing up to take home. \n\nI would not come to this restaurant again. The food was weird and unexpected in a bad way, the service was awkward, and it was even somewhat expensive.

I have passed by this Cha-Am in the city many times and have been meaning to try it out.  Needless to say, my bf took me to celebrate my birthday and I was blown away.\n\nThe decor is more french modern than Thai/Asian.  We went on a Weds. night and it wasn't busy.  The service was very good.  The food came in a timely manner and the wait staff were attentive.  We ordered 3 dishes and Thai ice tea and green tea for drinks.  The Pad-Thai and Mu-Yang are priced similar to the other Cha-Am.  The curry dish was quite a bit larger (almost double),  so the higher price was well worth it.\n\nI love the grilled pork or Mu-Yang at the Berkley Cha-Am.  This was a little different.  They had 2 thick pork chops with a salad instead of grilled thin slices of pork.  It was OK but of course it's all about the yummy dipping sauce.  I don't know what the other restaurant puts in its sauce, but it's heavenly sweet.  This was close but not quite it.\n\nWe also tried the veggie Pad-Thai.  It was really good.  Everything was served on the plate separately, so you have to kind of toss it to mix the ingredients together.  The veggies (string beans, carrots, and squash) were fresh and cooked perfectly.  This was the first time trying a vegetarian Pad Thai but I liked it a lot, nice and fresh with the pea-nutty taste you love.  I usually order a chicken or prawn Pad Thai.\n\nLast, we had the green curry chicken or Gaeng-Keo-Wan.  This was deelish.  When I think of Thai curries, I think of a sweet spicy.  It is definitely more spicy than the Berkeley restaurant.  I loved this dish but then I like spicy things.  The bf wasn't as happy asking for more water.

We really wanted Osha at the Embarcadero, but because of the Annual Pillow fight that night, it was crowded and the wait was super long.  We heard that they opened a new Osha on 2nd or 3rd and Folsom (we've been to the one on Mission several times before) so we drove over.  I didn't like how they opened right across the street from another Thai Food restaurant.  Me being a supporter of the small business (at least smaller than the Osha chain), I opted for Cha-am instead and plus we had just ran 8 miles and didn't feel like showering or changing (TMI) and I didn't think our outfits would be appropriate in there.\n\nAnyway, we ordered a beef and fish dish with 3 bowls of rice.  The servers were very attentive and so friendly.  The food was very flavorful.  Prices are about the same as Osha.\n\nMinus one star because they accidentally included grautity in my check.  I didn't find out until after I added more tip and thought to myself, \"wow, this is expensive\".  anyway, they were genuinely apologetic and offered to remove it.  \n\nI would come here again.

Thai came to mind, so we walked over to Osha on 2nd St. It was after 8pm and people were spilling out of the doors like it was noon during the work week. I maneuvered through the crowd and went up to the hostess who told me that the wait would be 30 minutes for a table for four. Too hungry to wait that long.\r\n\r\nThen I remembered about Cha-Am. I hadn't been there since Osha opened across the street from my office. So, I took my friends on a walkabout and ended up a block away from where we had started. We had built up even more of an appetite and I was just hoping that there wouldn't be a wait there. Luckily, there wasn't. There were plenty of empty tables and the staff in bright Hawaiian shirts were happy to seat us. I thought, poor Cha-Am, Osha has taken away all of your business. \r\n\r\nThe food had always been good before, and this time didn't disappoint. The yellow curry chicken, beef short ribs, pad thai, and rainbow salad were all flavorful and tasty. We ended our meal with an order of fried bananas with coconut ice cream - make sure you save room for this! For all of this, it only came out to $12 per person. \r\n\r\nThe service was fast, the atmosphere casual and great for dining with friends, and apparently \"the spot\" for locals to slam some shots at the bar. \r\n\r\nSo if you're looking for some good Thai food, Cha-Am is a great alternative to Osha. You won't feel pressured to hurry up and finish your meal so the people waiting at the door can take your table, and the servers make sure you're having a good meal and a good time.", "author": "Connie C."}

I guess places in the area don't find it important to stay open on Sundays! But luckily, Cha-Am saved the day. \n\nWe first shared the papaya salad, which was really yummy! We ordered it sans shrimp, substituting tofu, and they first brought it out with shrimp. They were quick to correct it, but it still tasted slightly like seafood to me. Regardless, it was spicy , crunchy, and delicious!\n\nI had the red curry, which was really great, spicy, and a great value!! It comes with rice, and was more food than I could finish in a sitting. I think I need to stop eating out for dinner and convert to eating out for lunch, because lunch specials are awesome!! \n\nOverall, I think we were all pretty satisfied, though our noses were running by the end from the spiciness of the dishes.

And of course my favorite being Thai I was on the lookout for someplace decent and hopefully within walking distance of the hotel (at the intersection of SOMA, Union Square, and the tip of the Tenderloin).\n\nCame across Cha-Am on Folsom. Wish I had better things to say, but I was expecting a lot from a San Francisco Thai restaurant. I mean, hell... it should at least be better than the places I've been to in Texas, right?\n\nWrong. Cha-Am has an attractive seating area that gave me such high hopes for the food, but alas... it failed to deliver. I ordered my favorite Thai dishes... Pad Thai and Tom Ka Gai... cliche but I do not apologize. Anyway, EVERY Thai restaurant should be able to make an outstanding pad thai and coconut soup at a minimum. This was not the case. \n\nThe Pad Thai was pretty damn good I'll admit. Although, I ordered it \"extremely spicy\" and it came to me \"slightly spicy.\" Hey, that's not their fault. I just like things hot and I'm sure the chef in the back was afraid of pushing the envelope. But I was pleased with it. It had been a long Thai drought. Sadly, if I had only ordered the pad thai, I would have given the place four stars.\n\nBut the Tom Ka Gai I ordered as a starter was amateur at best. Thin, runny, oddly flavored, and not at all \"put together.\" The bamboo shoots were stringy, tough, and inedible. The soup itself had no substance or texture. And no straw mushrooms. What were they thinking? I was so disappointed. \n\nOn the other side of the table...\n\nI'm more of a Gang-Ped person but my friend opted for the Kiew-Wan Gai. It tasted pretty good, but just like my disappointing soup, his curry was thin, runny, and didn't have that luscious texture a good curry typically has. (Or maybe I'm just spoiled by Mon's in San Antonio). \n\nWell my friend thought the curry was too spicy. Frankly, his dish was spicier than mine so we were thinking the waitress accidentally told the chef that the curry was supposed to be extremely spicy instead of the pad thai. Who knows.\n\nUltimately, my first San Francisco Thai experience was a bit disappointing. The prices were fair. The atmosphere was pretty good for a mid-priced Asian joint. But the food just didn't hit the mark.\n\nIt was a mixed bag. I'd eat there again, but I wouldn't be getting excited about it.", "author": "Michelle T."}

The beef short ribs were cooked perfectly and like good dinner guests should, we shared appropriately.  The pad Thai was where I lost it, going back for thirds. The papaya salad was full of awesome prawns, and if it wasn't for the size of the party, I would have had more than one for sure.  We actually had to pull the Tom-ka-gai (coconut milk and chicken breast) out of one of the guests hands with brute force, and tell her to share...We had a yellow tofu curry, and a green curry that set everyone's mouths afire.

Good location at a prime spot on a corner.  But their is a reason I just gave them two stars: the service.  Its one thing to serve your customers with no enthusiasm which can be understandable probably because they are disgruntled but its another thing give us food from the floor.  \nI was out with my co-workers over here for lunch because one of them was leaving the company.  We ordered some dumplings I believe and as the waiter was about give us the dumplings, about three of the dumplings fell onto the floor and the waiter picked it up and put it back on the plate and served those dumplings to us, with the waiter smiling.  All of my co-workers just looked at each other and was shocked that our waiter just did that.  Later on, one of us had ordered salad and a different waiter was about to come by with the salad and did the same thing the other waiter did, she dropped about a portion of the salad, pick it up, and served it to my co-worker.  I dont know if the waiters were going to have a lunch break or something because they seemed to be in a hurry but you should not serve food that was obviously dropped onto the floor.  I think its common courtesy for them to go back and bring another set of whatever you ordered.", "author": "Kris A."}

It was virtually empty when we walked in at noon, but quickly filled up. The noise level grew as did the seeming impatience of the wait staff. We felt we needed to order quickly or we would be gumming up the works. We chose a couple of items from the menu, including one listed as \"spicy\". The food arrived on the coolish side and the spicy dish was not at all.  I think if we had taken the time to choose wisely, I might have been more satisfied. Still, the price was right so I didn't feel \"cheated\" when I left. I would try this place again, but I have a hard time imagining it becoming a favorite.", "author": "Chris W."}

My favorite Thai dishs are Panang curry, Tom Kha Gai soup (coconut milk soup with chicken), Pud Thai, Ginger Beef and Chicken Satay. They make all of these dishes pretty decently, except for the Pud Thai, which I don't really care for (the noodles seem low quality).\nI'm giving four stars because I am judging it against a scale of all types of food.  Thai seems to be more consistent (it is very hard to find a really good or bad Thai place), so this run-of-the-mill Thai place deserves four stars overall.  If I were judging it against just Thai places, I would probably give it three stars.\nThe places seems clean and the wait staff is pretty friendly.  The price point is fair although certainly not inexpensive.\nAsk for the Prik Ki Nu chilis-- they will be surprised that you know of them and delighted to serve them.  They are super spicy, delicious, and definitely a sign of a solid Thai place!", "author": "Joe M."}

I have not been to their Berkeley location, but this experience was a turn-off. The Tom-Ka-Gai and Tom-Ka-J soups should have been the same minus the chicken or tofu. The chicken version came with galanga and lemon grass, the tofu version had huge chucks of tofu with no spicy leaves or much else. It seems they just have big pots of ingredients and spoon the contents haphazardly into the soup bowls as it gets ordered.\nThe beef salad came on a bed of mixed greens like you get in bulk bags. Many of the leaves were already rotting, and the overly raw beef tasted as if it was seasoned only when the salad was assembled and not while cooking. The crab special was essentially a large shell overflowing with mostly rice, bits of crab, frozen peas and a couple of slices of tomato and cucumber. It had 2 springs of cilantro on top and a bunch of parsely for garnish????? And not cheap either.\nWe had to beg for tea and water, and strangely, we were served with the normal fork and spoon traditional to Thai food, but the large group seated next to us was served with chopsticks. The experience was like eating at one of those awful Chinatown restaurants that serve you veggies with square carrots straight out of the freezer. If you go to their website and click on the menu, you're going to see some beautiful food but don't be fooled.
