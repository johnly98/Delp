I didn't realize it was an actual open space area and expanded really far back up the hill with trails, lots of trees, and views.\n\nThere are a lot of different views throughout the park of the Golden Gate Bridge, downtown, Sutro Tower, and the southern part of the city.  It's not a destination viewpoint onto itself like Corona Heights or Tank Hill but it's nice to stroll along and admire different views throughout your walk.\n \nFor a hike there is enough incline to get a work out and kick your butt yet it's not too long so if doable for a hike after work before it gets dark.  Many paved and unpaved trails zigzag through the park so it depends on which trails you use but in general it's about 45 minutes-1 hour/1.5 miles to go around.  For something longer it's best to add Corona Heights/ Vulcan stairs which are like 5 minutes away.", "author": "Joan W."}

You're likely to see at least a pup or two off leash here on any given day. Often dog walkers bring their dogs here as well in fairly large batches but most are not looking to socialize and may have some \"pack mentality\". The top of the park though has a really cute patch of stone and grass (pictured) which dog owners do gather on top of on weekday mornings (typically before 8am) if you're looking for a fun play group for your pup. There's also a sandy dog run lower down in the park where dogs come to run. It isn't too far from the street though so make sure your dog is good with recall if you bring them. Plus, every now and then you'll see a coyote warning sign - I have yet to spot one myself but I've heard of other dog owners who have. Best to keep the smaller dogs on leash!\n\nIf you're just looking for a nice walk, this park is for you, too! There are so many little trails and turns you can take that you can easily spend over an hour traipsing through it. And the view of the city at some points is just wonderful. I'm myself a big fan of how green and woodsy it feels. Still can't believe such a great cluster of trails and trees exists right in the middle of San Francisco!", "author": "Diana C."}

But reading through the reviews, you'll find that not always do the locals even realize it's here. At the bottom along Haight, however, you do notice some spillover from Haight-Ashbury, but it's the hippie type. I mean, there were A LOT of people parked there at the bottom of the steps and at the corner, rolling their joints and otherwise administering their freshly obtained Mary Jane. \n\nIf you only have a couple of minutes, just take the drive around the road that borders the park and connects you back to Haight. You'll see the personality change along the way. From the legalize crowd, you'll quickly ascend to a cleaner-cut crew of beautiful homes across from a more wooded park. In fact, Buena Vista is kind of a jungle of trees and walkways on the exterior, with nice (but not ostentatious) homes along the exterior.\n\nWhen you get to the top, you'll see the other Buena Vista. The dog-walking, people bustling, amazing views of the city and of the Golden Gate Bridge version. \n\nThis seems like the kind of park that you should at least plan to see if you're in the neighborhood. Tourists, listen up--grab a meal to go and come picnic here. Locals, make it a weekly routine and take a different stroll through/around/near the park once a week and see what's new, and also how it changes. Ya, it's super steep as it's carved into the hillside, but you'll get some sexy calf muscles along the way.\n\nMe? It's the kind of place where what I really want to do is grab a small box of varied chocolates, take a walk into the deep wooded interior, find a small patch of grass or bench or two rocks to sit on, and sit and share the chocolates and plan the rest of my afternoon.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

Admittedly, I'm biased when it comes to this one...it's my neighborhood park, and I am exceptionally grateful to have it right outside my door.\n\nBuena Vista Park is a little bit of one of those great finds that you keep missing even though it's right in front of you.  I had seen it plenty of times as I passed between upper and lower haight and not even given it a second look.  It wasn't til I moved into the neighborhood that I discovered what a great (large) park it is.\n\nWith its hilly terrain and being nearly covered w mature trees, BV park can almost make you forget you're in the city. The forest-y aspect of it sets it apart from most of the City's other green spaces that tend to be wide open spaces. The paved trails, ample dog owners walking their pets and the peek a boo views of the city remind you that you are in the middle of the city, but park is a lovely sanctuary from the rest of the concrete jungle of SF.\n\nThe trails are numerous, there are tennis courts tucked away on the southeast side and if a grassy knoll is more your style, there's one of those on the north, Haight Street side...admittedly with an interesting representation of SF residents. There used to be a view of the bridge that was framed with trees such that they looked like a heart, but either the trees have grown and so it doesn't look like that anymore or I just haven't found the right look out point.  \n\nOnly downside to this park - there are some resident coyotes.  No threat to humans, but you should probably keep your dog on its leash if it's small.", "author": "Sara E."}

Like most people who don't live in the immediate vicinity, my default choices for bucolic frolicking have been Golden Gate Park, the Presidio or Dolores Park where spaces are more wide open. But if you like a little more elevation (575 feet high) in a condensed forest, then Buena Vista does the trick, all 37 acres of it. Jamie W. and I just happened upon it because we were at the Castro MUNI station, and out of sheer randomness, I suggested we go north on Castro versus our usual route of going into the Castro. Jamie was a good sport, and we trudged our significant arses up 15th Street and then Park Hill Avenue where we were greeted by a large rat only to find a long flight of steps beckoning us.\n\nFrom there, it was just a quick stroll to the summit where there were already a herd of camera-wielding European tourists and a couple of dog walkers, all of them taking in what we could see of the view through the trees. The best view from here is toward the Golden Gate Bridge, but you have to position yourself just right for your obligatory photo op. We then descended down toward the west where there is a genuinely nice view of St. Ignatius Church and the NOPA neighborhood. You eventually find yourself on Haight where the grassy area is festooned with what looks like the remnants of Woodstock or at least Burning Man with a lot of hippie types in all sorts of horizontal positions. The smell of weed was thick, and if it were better quality, we would have stayed. But no, it was time to leave the park.", "author": "Ed U."}

The hill was steep and I had to take frequent breaks as I climbed. It was a really exhausting and tough hike, so be prepared for a great work-out! The scenery along the pathways through the forest were beautiful. The trees were so huge! We finally made it to the top of the hill, where there was an open grassy area and a clearing in the trees, with a park bench overlooking the entire city. \n\nI hadn't realized how high we had climbed until we made it to the top and saw the amazing panoramic views of the surrounding city! They were incredible and we took some time to relax, admire the views while taking lots of photos, and absorb the fantastic natural beauty around us. The atmosphere was so tranquil and calm. It felt like we were in the middle of a secluded forest and not in the middle of the city. \n\nWhat (pleasantly) surprised me, was the fact that we only saw two other people in the entire park during our visit and we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. \n\nBuena Vista Park is definitely an off the beaten path, hidden gem in San Francisco.

There are some nice easy paths and there are stairs, all of which are shaded by the trees. Although there are some very nice views from the top, there are lots of trees in the way. Howver, this park can be enjoyed on its own terms and not just for the views.", "author": "JD R."}

I actually enjoy the cool feel and eerie look the fog evokes when cascading down the hill through the trees.  The air is always so fresh and even humid sometimes. I often feel transported to a South American Rainforest. ahh.\n\nI generally prefer to start from the bottom of the hill at the dog run, then work my way up the concrete trail. Its a great early morning workout and the hills are abundant.  Once at the top the views are remarkable.  Even when it is foggy you can still see some of the view.  There are many trails to choose from and I try to explore different parts of the park each time I go.  Just a side note, dogs love walking along side of the mountain  on the dirt trail.  \n\nIt's amazing to have this well maintained, stunning park in such an urban neighborhood.  \n\nLastly, ladies be aware gong late at night, because sometimes there are sketchy people there.

It is the oldest official park in San Francisco, established in 1867 as Hill Park and renamed Buena Vista in 1894.

I've done neither of those things here, but the rumors were enough to keep me away.  Not because I was repulsed...mainly due to laziness.  Are these reasons to bother with walking up that damn hill?  No.\n\nAnd then my roommate wanted to walk through the park when we were house-sitting for a friend who lives adjacent to it.  I thought, what the fuck.  Why not?    I really wanted to see the tombstones I'd heard so much about.  Sure enough, they are all over the place!  I have uploaded a couple pictures of them for your viewing pleasure. \n\nWe talked to a groundskeeper named Hugh who was very passionate for the park, and a total wealth of knowledge.  He explained the tombstone story a little more thoroughly, and ID'd some trees for us (Cypress, Monterrey Pine).  This is also the oldest park in San Francisco and Mayor Sutro wanted it to be an escape from urban life for those who couldn't afford to travel.  What a nice man!  I'm glad he got a tower and some baths named after him.\n\nI've since come back a couple of times and really enjoyed the rich stillness of the park.  For me, it's a great big wooded cathedral.  I saw no evidence of shenanigans going on and thought maybe the rumors were just rumors.\n\nAND THEN I read the Yelp reviews--most of which mention all sorts of sex going on in the bushes.  And now I worry that when I go for walks through here, the good and decent citizens also strolling through the park might think that I am cruising.  Which I'm not.  No, really.\n\nMaybe I should stop wearing daisy dukes and mesh tank tops when I go for my walks.  Wouldn't want to give anyone the wrong idea!", "author": "Eric E."}

Not in a bad way or anything. It's kind of like the light seems to shine on objects from a different angle, or like you can envision more clearly the exact spot you're standing in in relation to something much larger.\n\nThis mini form of culture shock (geographic shock, maybe?) is the best way to describe what I felt like after I returned to my home in NOPA after taking a leisurely walk to, through, up, down and from Buena Vista Park. I always knew this park was just beyond the Panhandle and damn close to my house, but for some reason I never ventured there. Maybe it was the bums and stoners that always seem to hang out on the front lawn at the Haight side?\n\nI'm glad my upcoming move out of the neighborhood (and the dire need to take a breather from packing!) inspired me to finally visit last Sunday. The weather was perfect... sunny and actually warm, almost to the point where it was a bit too hot for your normal SF clothes. As I began to follow a random path up the park, the temperature was cooled down by the increasing winds rustling through the trees, which after a 10-minute walk was really the only significant sounds.\n\nThis place is so peaceful! In addition to the spectacular views of the central and downtown neighborhoods you get from the top (one of the best I've seen of St. Ignatius Church on the USF Campus!), once you're really deep into the park you also have a great view of all of its hills and steep footpaths. The feel of this park is much more woodsy, grandiose and secluded than other parks in the city... walking through it you feel like you're in another world.

I made a very wise decision to go around 10 am on a Saturday morning.\n\nThe upside is that it's a nicely wooded park with paved or dirt paths crisscrossing all around the hill. It's quiet and you can forget you're in a city. The trails are pretty well maintained although the dirt is seriously eroding between the wood steps. There's a little fenced dog run that no one uses because the dogs are wandering around off leash. There is a nice looking playground. The views are good although not the best in the city. The main entrance is just off Haight St. so you can grab a bite and coffee before or after your hike. My dog seemed to like it okay and was playing a little bit jumping up and down the stairs. There are a few joggers and children at the top of the hill which gives it a bit of a family feel.\n\nThe downsides, and why I wouldn't go out of my way to go back:\n- lots of homeless men lying on the grass near the entry at the Haight St side, and a couple wandering around on some of the lower trails, some smoking, some with a scarey looking pit bull type on a dirty rope leash - you get the picture\n- parking on Haight was a pain, had to feed the meter\n- weird smells, couldn't quite put my finger on it, but there was something about the air that wasn't as refreshing as Bernal Heights or Stern Grove - the air smelled stale or dirty somehow\n- some paths are paved but mostly loose fluffy dirt, so you are shuffling through a lot of dry dirt - wish there were some grass or the paths were packed down better or mulched\n- I was a little tense the whole time expecting some hobo to jump out of the bushes; while no one jumped out, I did turn the corner and there was unexpectedly a man standing on the edge of a cliff peeing who began screaming antagonistically at some other man down lower\n- I shouldn't have gone on my own; I would have been more relaxed with someone else with me\n\nI'm satisfied with my other go-to dog parks, such as Stern Grove, Bernal Heights, Glen Park, and Fort Funston.

Speaking of views... just ramble through this park -- up and down, all around, and you're bound to turn a corner and come across a view of the Golden Gate & Muir Woods on a clear day. There's a children's playground that has an open patch just below it that has clear views. \n\nThen, there's a magical tennis court. Tucked away in an elevated grove (if that's even possible), you might find me building my own chairman's judge chair one day and just sitting up there, waiting for players.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-31", "description": "Yet another lovely park in scenically brilliant San Francisco, Buena Vista is off the beaten path of Haight.  Wild woods and a dense web of branches lie between you and the clearing at the top.  That is right, this park requires a hike.  Truth be told, it is a steeper, but your glutes will thank you.  Still, I would not recommend it for unfit folks.  However, once you reach the pinnacle, you are rewarded with an amazing view of the city--downtown, Dolores Park, and as far as the bay if the fog does not roll in.  There are only about two or three benches in the area, but this park is not as popular as the multitude of others, like Dolores, Washington Square, and, of course, Golden Gate, so you should be able to find seating.  Take advantage of it.  Enjoy the natural beauty of a city anointed by many as one of the most beautiful in the States.\n\nIf you have a dog and you dragged the poor thing up with you, take him/her to the lush clearing.  The grass is a vivid green and as you do the once over and admire this gorgeous slice of nature, you might wonder how this patch of doggie heaven got here.  Most likely the idea of some thoughtful landscape architect, but as your dog runs in circles and makes new friends (it can sometimes amount to a dog convention here), share in his/her glee by imagining the magic of finding a perfectly manicured meadow nestled within a mythical forest of trees.  I would not roll around on the knoll with him/her, though, unless you are wearing some uglies 'cause like I said, dog conventions take place here and they leave some business behind.", "author": "Dee C."}

Some days I swear I can see Stinson Beach and well into the Oakland Hills. And it's true, that from several different locales, I believe you can see 360 degrees of the Bay area. In the springtime, I have never seen more varieties of flowers, plants and trees in full bloom. It's like hiking through the mountains and botanical gardens all rolled into one, right here in the middle of the city.\n\nNow for the interesting part....\n\nGravestones. Yes.. you heard that correctly, and I am surprised to not see it previously mentioned. Did you know that the pathways through the park are bordered by old gravestones? You will mostly see them positioned face-down, but in some cases the workers (fueled by carelessness, drunkenness or a morbid sense of humor) laid them right-side-up so that you can see the engravings... and in some cases, the names and dates! \n\nWhy, you might be asking, are the pathways lined with gravestones????? This is actually a great piece of San Francisco history! When all the cemeteries were moved out of the city in the early 1900's, the unclaimed graves were still moved (meaning... the bodies) but the gravestones were broken up and used for various other things throughout the city.\n\nNow, you may be a little creeped out by this, but I think it's an interesting part of this city's history... and being a little fascinated with cemeteries and such myself, I am proud to say that I think I've found (and photographed) almost all of the face-up headstones in the park, although there's no way to really know. \n\nA tip for anyone that wants to go on a headstone-hunt... the gulley-ways along the paths are often filled with leaves and dirt and such, in which case you wont see anything unless you move the muck out of the way. The park frequently cleans these out however, which is when you'll be able to easily recognize them. If one part of the park's gulley-ways are mucky, keep walking.. another area might have just been cleaned.\n\nSo.....

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-04-11", "description": "can remember the first time I walked to the top of Buena Vista Park. This park has to have the most stunning view because the walk alone is a hike. I definitely recommend that you wear your kicks when walking up this steep hill. When you finally do reach the top it is such a surreal experience; the vision is beyond anything I could ever imagine, for a hill, that is. You can see a good number of landmarks that have doted this city for many years. When you look to the north you see far beyond the beauty of the trees that surround this area. There is the most breath taking views of San Francisco to the Marin Headlands. From the west to the east you can see the Pacific Ocean to the San Francisco Bay and afar.\n\nBuena Vista Park borders Haight Street between Buena Vista east and west and has multiple entrances. It is sited on a sand covered bedrock hill and has its own natural spring and steam. There are certain flowers and plants; for example, the coastal oaks flourish extremely well on this type of land. When I was adventuring around the park I thought WOW this is the absolute most amazing view hence the translation: good view. I never dreamed of a place that could have so many views while drawing emotions and thoughts too. I was so dazed I could see the oceans blue glare blend into the sky, church/temple(s), mountain range(s), infamous bridges and streets, and clusters of homes.\n\nIt is such a GOOD feeling to look around at what you have conquered so far in this extremely diverse city. Upon peeking out I always wonder why I moved to this city and what drew me here. Just taking one quick look brings back all the memories. It is nice to see where I fit in as an individual in this circle of life. I must also mention that there is a patch of grass to lay on and stare into the sky. It seems to me that many people do not know about this vastly rich park. A place where all of your cares and worries fade away. I felt like I was a child again, lying in the grass dreaming, thinking, and pondering.\n\nBuena Vista is a different kind of park where you can rest or check out the views and the city. It is not that big but there is such a good energy about it! I recommend a trip there during morning hours and sunsets too! Some of my friends have watched the sunrise from there. It is a superior feeling I have after walking to the top, and when you look out over the City the feeling just gets better!", "author": "Tamara M."}

After it rains, one of the courts tends to puddle up with water.  And Saturday/Sunday mornings can be pretty busy....\n\nBut, the view is pretty amazing - you can look over Dolores Park, Downtown SF, and even the bay.  If you do want to play on Sat/Sun mornings, I suggest arriving at 8:30am or 8:45am; otherwise you may have a 30+ minute wait (sitting on some benches), while the courts turn over.  Outside of that, the weekday and weekend afternoons are typically clear.  And I must add that some of the cutest dogs come walking by...\n\nIn terms of safety, I can see why people are concerned.  There are probably 15 paths that lead to the courts, but only 2 are actually paved.  Try to enter off Haight, and work your way up the stairs and to the South/SouthEast, and you should be golden.  There isn't a great entrance off Buena Vista, unless you like a quick, steep hike up through some dirt and dry trees/shrubs.\n\nSo stop reading and go play some tennis!

But it was ok because while we were waiting we met three cool new people. And we met this guy who felt compelled to tell us these stories of when he used to play with his buddies back in the 60's.  He said he was \"really good\" and was the best \"in the state of...the state of...(insanity)...California.\"  He told us he moved up from playing there, at Buena Vista, to..Golden Gate park.  Wow, that made us smile.  He also told us, though, that all his friends have since died and that he is scared.  He looked ravaged.  We didn't know quite how to respond.  He just wanted to talk.  Well, the place has a history that you can feel.  Surrounded by the city, on a clear day, you feel like you are in a special place.  At least, I did.  I had never been here prior to today.  I felt lucky to have been here this afternoon.  A Buena Vista, indeed it has!", "author": "Lauren S."}

It's a great place to get your puppy socialized to other dogs and people, as there are a lot of great dog walkers that go here.  It is also where I met my current dog walker.  It is a safe place to have your dog off-leash for the first time as it is away from the street and busy roads.  I would give this park 5 stars but I can't because of the following two reasons.  One, there is poison oak here as I have so unfortunately discovered!  So try to keep an eye on your dog when they run off into the sections of dense foliage around the paved trail.  The oil from the poison oak can rub onto their fur, and then onto you and everywhere else the dog rubs up against.  Two, I was told by a friend, and I quote: \"people come here to f**k, so be on the watch out for what your dog picks up\"; which would explain the condom that came out of my dogs bum a few weeks ago....  Well, at least I know people here are having safe sex, ha ha!", "author": "Billy B."}

I have a Siberian Husky who loves to run, but has no fear of cars, and this is one of the only places in the city where I can let him off leash to run like a mad man. The whole walk is beautiful. There are many paths to choose from, some more of a workout than others, but the end result (the top of the hill) is always the same and beautiful. This has to be one of the best views in the city. As for Prima D.'s review, It must be tough to have such a crappy attitude towards everything that you can't even appreciate the beauty that's right in front of you. I am in this park every day, sometimes twice a day, and I have never seen anyone doing drugs or \"needles and little bags filled with white powder\" (Jennifer S.). And I don't think peeing on the stairs is doing anything to help the scenery of the park, or the enjoyment of others. For all of you newcomers, please don't listen to people like Prima D and Jennifer S, and go check it out for yourself, you won't be dissapointed (unless you don't like dogs, there are always a lot of well behaved dogs running around).", "author": "michele k."}

The view is nice on the way up, although you wont have a view at the top because of the trees. As many places are in San Francisco, it is very hilly, and there is lots of noise from the traffic near the bottom.", "author": "Tedster H."}
