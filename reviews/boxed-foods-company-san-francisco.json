I like Boxed Food because it has reasonably priced sandwich and salad combos. I always go for the steak panini with salad. The horseradish dressing definitely makes it! The other options are great, too, especially the chicken salad sandwich. Prices recently increased by a dollar, so it's becoming more comparable to its neighbors. There are a few tables to sit and eat, but it doesn't have the best ambiance. You can often hear the sound of the refrigerator. \n\nThe portions are good even with someone with a healthy appetite. Usually I can eat the sandwich in one sitting, and I save the salad as a snack at work. \n\nThis place is good and reliable.

Also was surprised that the employees didn't use gloves when handling the food (so hope they have high cleanliness standards to make up for that).\n\nI ordered the boxed chicken sandwich ($11) without apples, added brie cheese ($1.50) and switched the champagne apple vinaigrette to balsamic (no charge).  Flavor-wise, it was good.  The bacon was crunchy enough to add some good texture to the salad but not so crunchy that it crumbled into tiny bits and pieces.  The greens though were kinda wilted- would have been nice if they were cold or crisp so that it would be more refreshing.  Although the flavor on the chicken was great, it had a weird consistency.  Maybe because they used dark meat, but for some reason the chicken had a slightly slimy texture to it like dark meat does when it's been sitting around too long... not exactly the best feeling / thought when I'm eating a lunch.  \n\nI think this place has the potential to be amazing, given their flavors.

The drinks, chips, and counter were all on different sides, forming a triangle. This makes for a really chaotic ordering process where nobody knows where the line is, and you're forced to go all around getting what you want. The order numbers are haphazard and not in order, going from 60 to 95 all of a sudden, making it really hard to listen for your number in a predictable manner.

However, the art of the perfect salad is deceptively difficult because only a handful of FiDi eateries nail 'em.\n\nAnd Boxed Foods does.\n\nMy go-to salad at BFC (the Boxed Chicken Salad) is topped with grilled chicken dressed with lime, Granny Smith apple sticks, bacon, olive oil, a touch of aioli, fresh herbs, EVOO, cherry tomatoes, red onion and then it's all lightly tossed with a complementary Granny Smith apple vinaigrette. Great, but I make it fantastic by adding avocado. For under $10, I get to eat a salad that nourishes and wonderfully sates!\n\nSome day, I'll try one of their sandwiches but for now I know a dream of a salad waits for me at BFC.", "author": "Jelena Z."}

As many other reviewers have mentioned, it's a good light lunch for a normal appetite, but insufficiently satiating for anything greater.\n\nNow, one can't go wrong with the glorious combination of Bosc pears, caramelized onions, walnut pesto, and brie. The flavors meld together perfectly. The rude awakening is the bread: a hearty grain bread with the toughest crusts ever. Yes, biting the soft center is a euphoric experience, but the small circumference of the bread slices left me with a whole lotta tough texture that took away from the beauty of the ingredients. Also, the sour raspberry dressing with my salad didn't mesh with my palette.\n\nMy friend ordered the $9 GRILLED STEAK SALAD, with lightly seasoned, medium-cooked strips of steak. The steak is great, and the accompanying vinaigrette is fitting.\n\nAll in all, I'd avoid the pear & brie press sandwich not because of flavor, but because of texture.

As they've been around for the better part of the last decade, the simple execution at Boxed Foods is somewhat deceptive, as they clearly use high-quality ingredients in their abundant salads. But I always feel like I need to gird my loins when I enter this claustrophobic space on Kearny at lunchtime because it means I'm spending a bit more than my usual budget allows. On the other hand, now that I'm going more flexitarian these days while still being too lazy to bring an unimaginative salad from home, maybe I am worth the $9 price tag on the Roasted Veggie Salad. It's really delicious and a lot more healthy goodness than a chicken salad sandwich from Lee's Deli.\n\nIt comes in a fairly large egg-carton-thick container where it's anchored by a bed of fresh mesculun greens and topped with huge slices of red and golden beets along with carrots, parsnips, caramelized onions, walnuts, orange slices, and bits of a high-end goat cheese - all doused with a balsamic vinaigrette mixed with fresh orange juice (see photo). As urban salads go, it's a relative treasure trove if you're looking for a lot of sweetness to go with your greens. I've had their grilled chicken and flank steak salads before during heartier days of carnivery where meat passed my lips like nobody's business. Space is tight in here with just a few cafe twofer tables that generally get snapped up quickly, so be prepared to take it to go.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...a hearty, healthy salad may be a bit overloaded and pricey - but who's complaining?\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...bright and tight...they box it for a reason\nSERVICE - 3 stars...not very memorable\nTOTAL - 4 stars...I loves me some beets and sweets in me salad", "author": "Ed U."}

There were 10 of us and we didn't know they didn't have much seating inside but they were nice enough to set up tables for us on their \"patio\" aka the alley way. Good little spot on a nice day. I love that all of their serve wear is compostable and their food is organic. Everything was fresh an wholesome. \n\nI got the boxed chicken salad and there was no shortage of chicken or bacon. The salads come with an orange wedge or two and a piece of crusty bread. The vinaigrette was refreshing and light but I felt it could use a little more flavor.\n\nI give this place 3 stars because for what the food is, it's not outstanding but it certainly is still good.

Oh, there was also a small little pack of apple vinagrette dressing. \n\nThe chicken was good, not great, but good - at least not super dry.

I didn't have extra dressing in the fridge, so I couldn't even make it taste better and ended up throwing the rest of the salad. \n\nHad to eat some nuts and fruit because the salad just wasn't filling enough. I suppose the salads are good if you're looking for a super super super healthy diet, but hey, if you're working so hard everyday, why not treat yourself to a little flavor in your life?\n\nReally, nothing special.

I have walked by this place every time I am on my way to get a Chipotle Chicken Salad at Working Girls. But after being ranked #2 in Yelp checking at Working Girls, I decided its time to try a different salad place.\n\nI stopped by Boxed Foods Company, and the salads were 9 dollars. Whoo hoo, better than the $9.25+ tax at working girls. The boxes that people were taking out were some what small... I hesitated, but this was for Yelp, for the sake of trying new things. There were several people waiting, so I thought it would take a while for my salad to get to my hands, but even before I ordered, one of the workers asked me what i wanted so they could start making my order.\n\nI got the Boxed Chicken Salad. Pulled Grilled Chicken dressed with lime, fresh herbs, apples, bacon, and a delicious Granny Smith Apple Vinaigrette. It felt like I bypassed the queue of waiting people as I got my salad before the people in front of me got their orders, but I have noticed that sometimes they ask people if they can wait so they can give them the freshly made ingredients.\n\nThe salad looked nice and healthy but a little on the small side. It wasn't until I got to my desk and mixed that salad that all the leaves and meat popped out. The bacon ain't the flimsy or tiny bacon bits found at other places. They were nice thick cut pieces, and full of flavor too. I don't know if the guy really liked me or what, but I got a lot of chicken. More than half a breast at least! All the flavor just melded together nicely; the apples, the herb-y meat, the bacon. Delicious.\n\nLater that week, I stopped by again. It was a long week at work, so I treated myself to Boxed Food Company again, this time I decided to try the Grilled Chicken Salad. It had the same delicious apples and dressing as the Boxed Salad but no bacon and the chicken was sliced instead of pulled. A lot of the flavor came from the thick caramelized onions and grilled peppers. It was another delicious salad, but I prefer what the Boxed Salad has to offer.\n\nI am tempted to try their sandwiches next, but that will have to come another day after I get tried of my new usual.", "author": "David C."}

Deli Board, for example, has sandos for nearly $10.  The Sentinel is the same way.  And I would even pay extra for sandwiches at Naked Lunch (Sigh, if only it was closer to the FiDi).\n\nBut standard-sized sandwiches priced over $7 usually have a redeeming factor, something special that makes them stand out, and I was disappointed that I failed to find that special factor here.  \n\nOn a positive note, the Honey Lime Avocado Chicken sandwich was pretty good.  The tangy lime taste mixed in perfectly with the avocado.  Pretty good, except that the chicken was not tender enough, the bread was a little tough, and the sandwich was much too cold.  \n\nBoxed Food Co. does use quality, organic, locally grown ingredients...which is always a laudable feature, but often leads to higher priced items when the added costs get passed on to us.  I hear they serve Blue Bottle Coffee, so I'll certainly find my way back for that. \n\nOverall, three stars is too harsh for BFC, but I think it falls a little short of four, especially when you factor in value.

I really enjoyed my sandwich, however I think it is a bit overpriced for the amount of food you get (unless I'm just unaccustomed to what things cost on the west coast).  The side salad seemed like 4 leaves of lettuce and a tablespoon of dressing on the side.  The size of the sandwich was also small.

This was truly \"drip\" coffee where they place the grounds in a filter, put it into one of those single drip plastic holder and place the holder on top of the cup for the drip process.  I like coffee and usually when trying a place I get a black coffee so I can taste the coffee and not douse my buds with sugar, cream or any other assortment of flavors.  Verdict:  Coffee was smooth, no bitterness, no sense of any acid, no burnt taste.  This was good.  I know some people like their coffee to grown hair on their knuckles but I prefer something that is smooth and has some taste.  This was good coffee.  NOTE TO SELF:  It is drip coffee so you are going to wait.  Just know that and you will be fine.\n\nOn a different note -- my buddy had the Cappuccino.

The bacon, which is the star of the sandwich, was plentiful though and I found nice bacon surprises falling into the side \"salad\" several times.   The roll was more substantial than thinner toast versions, but thankfully the tasty garlic mayo was heaped on to moisten the bread.  The tomato and lettuce were fresh and worked well despite the fact that lowly iceberg lettuce was used.\n\nSide Salad: What a misnomer!  Since when did \"salad\" become a bunch of mesclun with some vinaigrette dressing?  It's a nice gesture to throw in a little extra with your sandwich, but fails on execution.

I had barely walked away from the counter after ordering and paying, that they (out of character) called out my order (instead of my number, which they usually do).  I took my order happily and walked back to my office, only to discover that the paniniwas cold.  Not just luke warm, COLD.  No heat at all.  \n\nObviously, this panini had been sitting around for a while behind their counter.  Obviously, Boxed wanted to unload the panini instead of taking a loss on a 9.00 sandwich.  Obviously I won't be coming back.  \n\nIt's one thing if the orders are close together to pawn off a mistake / no-show sandwich.  It's another thing when you are giving a formerly regular customer soggy, cold mozzarella, soggy, cold and FATTY prosciutto, soggy and cold BREAD, and even soggy, greasy, cold and wilty lettuce.  Not very delicious.  \n\nStill giving it a 3 because there non-panini sandwiches have never failed me, and like I said, their staff are always polite.

My favourite:\n\nBoxed chicken salad: Mixed salad, great piece of fresh bread, an orange slice for contrast, actual pieces of bacon, a chicken breast that was cooked whole and afterwards cut up (rather than a mix of processed chicken thrown on top). And of course, they tuck the napkin/cutlery in making it a good to go box. \n\nWhile you are waiting for your food after the first order you make, check out towards the back of the cafe where they have garbage bins to see what can be recycled, composted or thrown out. I preferred how they presented the boxed chicken salad to go rather than eating there on a plate (however to each their own).\n\nThe other food items such as the flank steak. I found that the actual steak to be under seasoned - this of course coming from a guy who loves Montreal steak seasoning (no bias given that I'm from there). I tried the panini as well and was not impressed (don't recall why). Try afew items, see what you like and run with it is my advice.\n\nOther tips of note: \nI always went after 1300 to avoid the rush/line-up that sometimes went outside on the street, however you can call ahead to make your order (whether you jump the line to pay and pick it up is a decision for you to make, though you may want to consider how it would look to the rest of the line). \n\nThey used to have half off pastries after 2PM (they close at 3 as I recall) which could work out for a small snack. \n\nNo tax on cold food items like the boxed chicken salad, but anything that is heated like panini's, it will be added on.\n\nLastly, they are pretty good about receipts - if you pay by credit card, it's not a problem to get a second copy should it be some sort of work expense.", "author": "Kevin M."}

I had JUST complained about charging too much for a latte in my previous review. People, we're in a recession..\nHowever, it is very important to note that the latte contained 2 shots.

Now, I know what the hype is about - I've come to see the light. Starbucks, you can get over yourself. \n\nThe baristas here are also super sweet.

As soon as you walk in you'll confront the board, with around twenty sandwiches and salads written up in chalk. Whoever has this job ought to write ad copy on the side; Everything sounds great and it may take you a few minutes to decide. \n\nIt will take other people a few minutes to decide too, so once you've made a selection you'll push your way through a crowd of people taking a few minutes to decide and get in line. I'm not sure why there's a line to order; it really doesn't take all that long. It does, however take a while for your order to come up since they're slammed long after the lunch rush has ended at most other spots. This isn't really their fault, but it's something to note. \n\nIt's close to the office (for me. This may or may not hold true for you.) and they'll pack it in a cardboard box with a fork and napkin tucked in like the fork is tucked into bed. Precious! And the fork won't fall out while you're carrying it!\n\nI opted for the grilled flank steak sandwich; What I received wasn't quite what I imagined, but was tasty nonetheless. I would characterize it as a roast beef-like sandwich on toasted wheat bread with a hint of horseradish in the mayonnaise and a few salad greens on the side. Whatever. It tasted good.\n\nThe portions are a bit smaller than most other places, but I think it's about right in that it will fill you up but it won't stuff you. It hits a happy medium for post lunch time fullness, if you think about these things the way I do.\n\nThe thing is that I paid 9.75 for that relatively small sandwich and small pile of greens, which seems 2 or 3 dollars more than what in my mind would be a fair price. This and the wait cause the Boxed Foods Company to fall a little short of its reputation.\n\nI was trying for epic, lord knows I was. I disappoint even myself sometimes.", "author": "matthew r."}

This was fine with me.\n\nThe sandwich itself is in this huge box with a small side salad and when i saw it, i thought, I paid $9+ for this?? but i think the box just makes it look small as the sandwich was actually delicious and had a thick serving of prosciutto which I feel like places normally skimp on.

I like that it comes with a side salad too.\n\nI did splurge on a smores cookie and it was okay but I definitely wouldn't get it again, just wasn't something I would crave - not like the smores cupcake i came across recently.\n\nOverall, I definitely won't be going here to often, it's a bit pricy, but it was a good sandwich and I think I'd be up for trying some of their salads too.", "author": "Lauren M."}

Portions are generous enough and the quality is very good. Going there and buying beautifully crafted foods is a happy experience.\n\nMy only gripe is the selection of vegetarian options. The Tofu Salad is a bit too meager, and it's one of the only vegan options. The Tempeh Sandwich has gotten worse since they started using patties, and the sundried tomato tapenade is too greasy. I haven't tried the brie press, but the sound of it is so unsubstantial that I haven't even wanted to.\n\nLettus in the Marina makes a bunch of incredible sandwiches with lots of vegetarian and strict vegetarian options. Down the street, Sellers Markets is now offering an \"ALT\" - avocado instead of bacon with hummus to add a bit of substance. Even the roasted veggie sandwich at Briazz is decent - not strict veg, but okay and without the wait. \n\nNOTE TO MANAGEMENT: what's the problem with satisfying those who want to be a little greener and healthier by abstaining from meat, dairy, and eggs? Will you try out the sandwiches at Lettus to see what's possible? Even better, how about giving us some great new options that we haven't seen before in San Francisco?

Because she knows of (and routinely teases me about) my critical Yelp reviews and how seriously I take my internal value construction when dining out, I thought she'd be sending me to a place that was so over-the-top good that I was bound to love it.  WRONG!\n\nFirst off, the space is adorable.  I wish it was bigger and had a cozier cafe-feel, but they do a lot with the real estate they have.  They provide artsy magazines for perusal while waiting for your order, and the eat-in is served on compost-able plates - nice touch.\n\nWe ordered the tofu salad and the boxed chicken sandwich, and after a very short wait (we were able to dodge the lunch rush), our meals appeared.\n\nMy salad was extremely bland.  The tofu was cold and flavorless, and could have benefited from some strong marinade or a bit of grilling.  The dressing was applied liberally, so be sure to ask for it on the side to control the drippy/soggy-factor.  Salad mix-ins were boring and uninventive, and I would not order this again.\n\nMy date's sandwich was on some sort of bland, run of the mill roll, but the actual chicken inside was very tasty and well-seasoned.  Also, his accompanying side-salad was well-dressed and had shaved cheese for that added salt-factor.  His side salad was actually more satisfying than my entr\u00e9e salad.  \n\nI walked out, disappointed, feeling like I just spent far too much on a sub-par sandwich (but I suppose that's what you get in any financial district).  I proceeded to go home and tell my roommate that I didn't love her suggestion...and that's when she reminded me that she only suggested it because the bread used for some of the sandwiches is \"to die for\".  Oh. Right. She said to try the bread.  Well, perhaps I would have liked it a bit more had I tried the \"delicious\" bread.

I absolutely love the honey-lime chicken with avocado. I'm munching on the sandwich, so to speak. I love the ambience and settings of the restaurant. This place might be a bit pricey, but they are using high quality acme breads and fresh ingredients. The sandwiches are really mouthwatering. It comes with side salad if you order a sandwich. But, I think they need to do some kind of promotion or advertiments. I eat my lunch around that area but never noticed it until Erica recommended.", "author": "Michael K."}

I heard that the owners are opening another restaurant south of market..... check out B's dinner reviews for a heads up on what the new restaurant might have to offer in the near future.", "author": "Chris L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-03-28", "description": "I work in the Financial District and am addicted to Boxed Foods.  Despite their unbelievable lunch rush (and consequent wait), the atmosphere and decor is calming and casually upscale, which would be an apt description of the food as well.  The prices are spot-on (some complain, but this is the Financial District-good luck finding this quality for cheaper) and the service is friendly and efficient.  The menu is inventive and different, while the small focus places an emphasis on making each menu item unique.  Furthermore, the sandwiches (which come with a petite side salad) are the perfect size for a moderate lunch-filling but not super-sized.  The only reason I haven't ranked this eatery with 5 stars is because they need to get a handle on their popularity-while they take the rush in stride with smiles, they routinely close early after running out of some or all of their base ingredients.  The quality scale also has some variation-it's all good, but some of the menu items are so close to perfect (asparagus sandwich, honey-lime chicken) that the less-than-perfect items suffer in comparison.", "author": "V.
