As I looked around, I might have been the only one not partaking in the guac, and it looked good. Next time!\n\nThe tri-salsa and tortilla appetizer was different and tasty, plus I felt all culture-y eating it, kind of like the old-town Mexican version of down-South bbq sauce and Wonder bread (yes my friends that's a thing).\n\nIt was time for the Especialidades. The word is justifiably long to match the special selection of diverse choices. Especialidades! I sound so cultured repeating it!\n\nPausing at the Mac-n-cheese ever so briefly, tempted, I remembered the wise advice I gave my wife (which she promptly ignored): \"pick something in their zone\". For instance, don't go to the oldest German restaurant in Boston and expect them to have good salmon, then commandeer your dinner-mate's schnitzel and have him eat the salmon (not that this ever happened).\n\nSo, I moved along to the filet. It also looked intriguing: goat cheese stuffed chile, mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed spinach, chipotle chili sauce? Am I ignoring my own sage advice in ordering a filet at a turn-of-century Mexican establishment? \n\nThrow caution to the wind; they had beef back in the 1900s, and they probably served it this way, before anybody had attempted to put the words \"gastro\" and \"fusion\" together with hyphens. That's right: go for the beef!\n\nIt was a risk-and-reward experience, and I made out like a beef-eating bandit. Tastiness all around, with a little chipotle keeping it spicy. Okay I'll admit I only ate the goat cheese and not the whole chile, but we can say it was part-garnish right?\n\nMexican coffee looked super-tasty, but I need to sleep since this Easterner is probably waking up at 3, so next time (I could fill a grocery store with all those next times).\n\nI'll stop by again, maybe just crush guac and mac, washed down with that coffee. You only go around once unless you come back, and I'll certainly try.", "author": "Paul V."}

The tequila actually complements the drink way better than the vodka in a typical Bloody Mary. \n\nThe meal comes with fresh tortillas with three salsas (verde, mango, and red). The servers probably thought we were annoying asking for so many extra tortillas and ruining our appetite, but they come out hot and fluffy, and are addictive. \n\nWe ordered the quest as an appetizer, which we ate with more tortillas (sooooo good).\n\nWhen our meals finally came, we were pretty full but still able to appreciate how good it was. Next time I would recommend sharing a dish. \n\nI got the Desayuno Mexicano, which comes with delicious steak on tortilla, chorizo eggs, beans, and rice.

The food was excellent, but pricey.  \n\nWe ordered tostadas de tinga for an appetizer, shared a filet mignon for an entree (not to save money, but because we knew we'd be too full if we each had an entree), rice and mushrooms as extra sides, and a pitcher of sangria. \n\nThe food was delicious, and one entree between us was more than enough.  My favorite dish was the mushrooms -- button mushrooms cooked with chilis and lime.  \n\nWhile I really enjoyed the food, there wasn't a lot on the menu that I could eat, as most dishes had pork or goat cheese in it, hence the three stars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-24", "description": "At one point I would have given this restaurant 4 Stars, but my recent experience, not bad, not bad at all, in my opinion has slipped a bit from the jewel it was when it first opened.\n\nOur Server Nayely was lovely.\n\nI took an out of town guest, who was raving for several days about her meal.\n\nWe were seated way in the back, back, near the kitchen. Which was odd as the restaurant wasn't full at all. I should have said something, next time. Also, the usual more intimate lighting is now replaced with full overhead lights, which makes me feel a bit like I'm in a diner.\n\nWhat I do appreciate is this is not your \"usual Mexican Fare\" so you will be hard pressed to find Mission Street Mexican food (aka Burrito) @ this restaurant. The menu is very creative with wonderful options to choose from.\n\nWe started with the Guacamole, which you can't go wrong, it's so authentic. However, we did ask for it medium spicy and it came rather bland. So we asked for something to spice it up and were presented with some chopped chiles, a tad odd I thought. They didn't have any \"salsa\" as such. Plus, they no longer make it at the table and don't serve it in the actual bowl, but in a plastic to go container in the bowl. It's always been about the authentic experience, so this was a bit disappointing \"to me\". Still a very adequate amount for the price and warm tortilla chips and warm tortillas just add to the experience.\n\nFriend ordered Ceviche which was Out of this World FANTASTIC and a Huge bowl of this goodness. She couldn't even begin to finish it, so gratefully I accepted her leftovers.\n\nLast main course was the Chile Relleno which was the Best Chile Relleno I have ever had and not \"deep fried\". We had ours stuffed with meat instead of vegetables. The flavors exploded in your mouth, only leaving you wanting more. Wanting more because it was a stand alone Relleno, on the small side, on some bean sauce. Of this, I was a tad disappointed, especially considering the price which was well over $20.00 I think. Which is quite outrageous for \"1\" Relleno with no garnish or anything. For this price, I think you could add a little scoop of Beans and a little scoop of rice to make the presentation a lot more presentable or at least make you think you are getting a good deal for the price.\n\nWe finished  with a Mango Br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was lovely and so light and very refreshing without feeling heavy. \n\nI will return, but will reconsider my food choices in regard to cost and abundance.", "author": "Marla B."}

It comes with chips and little tortillas. I really want to know what masa they use, because those tortillas pack a deliciousness upper cut. Anyhow- since we live in a place where pepper is considered spicy, we are pretty used to ordering \"ULTRA SPICY\", we did that. It was delicious, but occasionally challenging. The next day it was excellent, btw.\nThe place was a little more glamorous than expected. It has a beautiful bar, stocked high with tequila.\nOh yeah.\nTequila.\nIt's pretty much like going to tequila heaven. I was feeling ragged out from traveling so long, or I would have played more with the tequila. I had a nice margarita and left it at that.\nMy partner had the Chicken Mole and I had the Carnitas. \nThe Mole was rich and velvety- as it should be. It complemented the chicken just fine. The carnitas were good. I should have ordered something more creative, but carnitas is kind of comfort food for me. Go figure.\nThe service I found to be well above average.

I found very few dishes on the menu that were Mexican. One of the staples of most Mexican restaurants in the U.S., the burrito, was noticeably absent from the menu.\n\nThe service was acceptable, but felt a bit rushed. People were polite but not particularly friendly. That left much to be desired for me.\n\nIn terms of the food, they have some creations that simply don't make sense to me. I tried an entree of bacon wrapped prawns served with rice. Why would you take a prawn and wrap it in bacon? The prawn is flavorful enough by itself. Wrapping it in bacon takes away the flavor of the prawn and just leaves you with the bacon taste. It made no sense to me, although I ordered it because I couldn't find anything else that I might like.\n\nAnother member of my party had a queso fundido which had a cheese that was hard to cut and was excessively greasy. It just wasn't good.\n\nThe restaurant is clean and the food is, for the most part, well prepared. The menu doesn't feel quite Mexican to me, though.

The house-made tortillas were fluffy and really really delicious. \nThe restaurant was packed when we arrived and it was late on a Thursday night because we flew in late.

Food was delicious, service on point, and the experience exceeded expectations. \n\nKicked it off with margaritas from the bar while we waited; they were very busy, but we were still seated quickly.  House made tortillas with a variety of salsas were a tasty way to start, followed by a robust and spicy ceviche that rivaled any from Central America.  The duck in green mole was surprisingly sophisticated and well composed, while being completely satisfying.  The latin twist on their filet was refreshing and hearty.  And the churros, oh the churros!!!  We'd probably skip the mango creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e next time.\n\nAnd Sebastian and the rest of the wait staff really took great care of us, and kept the table spotless while not being intrusive.\n\nPS, the bartender mixed a mean margarita to boot.\n\nDef worth a visit!!!", "author": "Ryan B."}

I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThis place has a vast array of Tequila offerings, they actually have a menu just for tequilas.\n\nIn terms of food I wasn't really impressed but if there's a WoW item, it has to be with the ELOTE, The grilled corn.. Just heavenly.\n\nMy friends and I shared the Guacamole, came to us in this rustic stone container that was huge. Ironically, once I dogged a spoon in it. It was so shallow that 1 person wouldn't be satisfied. Lol another thing that bothered me is the guacamole doesn't come with chips. Our server mentioned that aside from the $12 guacamole, chips are $2. She also mentioned that they do have soft tacos that are home made but is unlimited.\n\nIt also seems that they don't have a set menu, what you see online is no necessarily what they offer every night. \n\nMy group go to try their Mole, Duck, and Carnitas.\n\nMole - Absolutely NO! Imagine a sauce out of burned pans- that's how it tasted..

I thought the fresh tortillas was a good touch but it didn't help the way the food taste. Unlimited mimosas is $18 besides the price of your entree. I had the huevos rancheros and the plate presentation was good. The beans were liquified and the nopales were cooked with an unknown food pairing like mushrooms or just the texture of it was horrible. 2entrees and mimosas $80! Save your money go eat at Jack in the box next door! Besides i have never been to a restaurant that didnt bring you back the change!

My aunt and I came to this place because of the reviews. We sat at the bar and it took the bartender 5 mins to acknowledge our presence. Moreover, once we ordered our house Margaritas, he never came back to check on us. Wait he did! Much later to ask if we wanted another drink. We asked for the check! I've traveled to London, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Greece, Istanbul, Israel, San Francisco, CA (3 times), Las Vegas, Miami, and other cities, but I've never encountered such a rude/dismissive behavior from a bartender.

The first time I dined here was for dinner and I ordered the chicken mole.  I thought it was pricey, but it was a pretty good meal.  However, I suggest coming here for brunch.  \n\nEverything on their brunch menu looked delicious.  I always order chilaquiles, and I did, but I was close to ordering the huevos rancheros.  I ordered the chilaquiles with the red sauce, and it came with fried eggs and black beans.  The chips were crispy.  The red sauce was flavorful, especially with the egg yolk.  The plate looks small, but I was pretty full after I finished.  I just wish it had avocado, but it was already around $15 and I didn't want to be charged extra.  \n\nAnd my roommates and I ordered guacamole as an appetizer.What I didn't like was that we were charged an extra $2 for chips.  You get a trio of salsas to start, and our salsas came with a basket of chips along with homemade corn tortillas.  The menu does state that when you order guacamole, you can order the chips for the extra price.  We never specifically ordered it, but yet we were charged.  My roommates and I didn't want to argue over $2, but if you don't want to be charged, ask the waiter before s/he puts the chips down.\n\nOverall, I had a very delicious brunch.

Overall, my feelings were mixed with some parts of my meal being incredibly good and others less so.\n\nWhen we sat down we ordered some spicy margaritas, guacamole, and an order of queso fundido.  I was told the queso was the thing to get here so I was excited to try it. \n\nOur cocktails came out quickly and were shortly followed by guacamole with chips and freshly made corn tortillas.  Guac was good, nothing that made it the best guac I've ever tasted, but good, and the chips were nicely salted.  However, I wasn't expecting to be so excited when I tasted one of the corn tortillas.  They are absolutely incredibly and I think I ate like 5 in the first 5 minutes of receiving them.  I was addicted.  This was shortly followed by queso fundido which was equally delicious and I instantly wished I had only ordered this for dinner.  So good.\n\nThis was followed by my entree which was the steak, cooked medium rate.  It came out covered with mole, on top of mashed potatoes and topped with goat cheese.  Unfortunately I was less wowed by this part of my meal.

I got a 13 dollar Margarita which was basic and filled mostly with ice. The carnitas were great and my boyfriends stuffed chicken was good as well. Our bill came out as 85 dollars. Dining at a Michelin rated restaurant you'd expect staff to keep drinks topped off but they never refilled any of our drinks.  Overall, it was an expensive, disappointing dinner and we wish we got the pizza by the slice next door.", "author": "Elana And Tamar B."}

I would rather pay for the tortillas, at least those were worth getting. Yes, you read correctly, you have to pay $2 for chips to go with your salsa/guacamole.

Drinks remained filled, food came out fairly fast, and our long table was tucked away so we didn't disturb the main dining room. I had arranged a prix fixe menu with their manager, $40 for a 3-course meal. Quantity-wise, it's a great deal. Quality was hit or moss though: the tortilla soup was more like a bisque and had a strange musty flavor; the chicken mole was a bit tough/overcooked, and the dulce de leche churro was impossibly sweet.  Everything was presented nicely though, so our group of out-of-towners were impressed.  We also ordered some pitchers of sangria and margaritas for $25 each (they should really call them \"carafes\", not pitchers. They're small).  \n\nIt's hard to find a large group reservation in SF,  so I was really happy with the reservation process with Colibri. The manager was very thorough and communicative, but our servers just seemed bitter to have a large group, and upset that 4 guests didn't show up. We were supposed to be 20, but because of the December floods, we had 4 people cancel at the last minute. Colibri wanted to charge us for the 4 people who didn't show up, which was crazy to me. We still had 16 people, and bought way more alcohol than we had planned, yet they wanted to nickel and dime us. In the end, I insisted the manager not charge us for the 4 no-shows, and she begrudgingly agreed. It ended our meal on an awkward note, sadly. But I still give them credit for accommodating a large group, without any noticeable hiccups for our party (sans the battle of the bill).", "author": "Nique F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-02", "description": "A few friends and I came here on a Sunday to take advantage of their bottomless mimosas ($10) and catch up. For some reason I've never noticed that this restaurant was here, even after leaving just a few blocks away from it for months. Anyways, the restaurant is pretty big and we made reservations, but it was totally unnecessary. My guess is that at dinner on the weekends it gets more crowded. \n\nI got the Chilaquiles verdes and everyone else got the Carne Asada estilo Sonora. The entrees were pretty standard, nothing too spectacular was good. I thought the Chilaquiles verdes was definitely better than what others got. It was kind of an ugly looking dish in terms of color but the flavors were unique and complex. The chicken was chicken, I think what made the dish was the verde tomatillo-jalapeno chile sauce. \n\nThe mimosas were great though! Our waiter just kept coming back and filling up our flute. Even if it was only half full he would still fill it to the top. Some places can be stingy on pouring or the mimosas are really dilute. Colibri definitely doesn't skimp on the champagne. =D\n\nThe best part of the meal was most definitely the churros. We also got the mango cr\u00e8me brulee, but the churros blew everything else out of the water. So the cr\u00e8me brulee was good but far from being the best. It was a nice twist that they added the mango but I think I prefer the standard. As for the churros, they were fried PERFECTLY. There were four, one for each of us and a scope of dolce de leche ice cream. The churros came out warm and when you bit into it, it was like heaven. The dough just was fluffy and soft and practically melted in your mouth. By the time I finished eating my churro I wished I had savored it more or had a whole other plateful. Maybe I'm just used to crappy churros you get from a stand at a fair or amusement park, but these were top-notch.", "author": "Liza X."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-10-27", "description": "I love that the region of cuisine is traditional Mexican food found in Mexico City and not what you would expect from a taqueria. If you are looking for a burrito this is not your best go-to spot.  This is \"fancy\" Mexican food with flair.  \n\nHands down my favorite item is their guacamole and fresh tortillas.  I know that is such an easy item, but their fresh, warm tortillas are delicious.  Fluffy, light, and rich masa flavor.  You get a serving of three salsas; mild, medium and hot.  The mild is a slightly sweet salsa with mango notes.  I mix the medium and mild for a smokey, slightly spicy salsa with sweet undertones.  Mixed with the guacamole I could horde all of it myself.  I would walk out with a belly ache but while eating I would be a happy camper.   \n\nTheir pan roasted chicken with huitlacoche is my favorite dish.  It is lightly seared with a slightly crispy skin, served bone in, beautifully presented and stuffed with the huitlacoche.  I usually get it every time because it is unique and delicious. Portions are slightly small, but in reality perfect compared to our overindulgent expectations for meal sizes in America.  \n\nTheir steak served with greens and over mashed spuds is also a lovely little dish.  Again, portion is small and I think this portion is smaller than the chicken even.  My last experience 4 of us ordered the same dish and our steaks were all different sizes and all small.  Served with a beautiful au jus rich in flavor and blends beautifully with the light, whipped spuds at the bottom of the plate.  \n\nService from the clean up staff is spot on, sometimes to a default because they want to clear plates the minute you stop eating. It feels more polite to wait until everyone is done for this occur.  \n\nIt is in Union Square neighborhood across from the Curran theater, so conveniently located to many hot locations to sight see and stop in after for a drink or some nibbles.", "author": "Mandy L."}

At one point, we were staring at three salsas and a bowl of guacamole with no chips or tortillas, took 15 minutes to get those. Had to ask for utensils and water refills. I also asked for more salsa, which never came. \n\nThe food here is so insanely tasty, that it might be worth coming to again, despite the terrible service.", "author": "Anita P."}

But I do appreciate really good, high quality, well spiced food, and this is the place.  \nLet's focus on the most important thing first, the Marquita's were wonderful.  In fact everyone at the bar seemed to be very happy.  After you order you are given corn tortillas and some spiced sauces.  Let's lament for a minute that there is nowhere in Maine where you can get a corn tortilla with the smoothness of tamale masa, that is warm and melts in your mouth.  I need to move to San Francisco.  Oh, the sauces were very good, too.  I still just cannot get over the tortilla.  Finally I had the slow roasted pork carnita.  It was spectacular, tender, flavorful, with a sauce even better than the ones that came with the tortillas.  But wait.  You know how Mexican rice is dry and boring (remember I live in Maine).  I would drive an hour to get rice this flavorful.  Definitely not simple and boring.  This had some nice complex flavors, while still being a balance for other items with more spice.

So refreshing...and so good!\n\n-- SOPES SURTIDO - Assorted Sopes with Beans, Chicken, Shredded Pork, and Saut\u00e9ed Vegetables; with Crumbled Queso Fresco, Onion, and Sour Cream...$10\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/colibri-mexican-bistro-san-francisco?select=vmWmzTrflpZFSCOOFod_wg#JCHoDI-uLJMyjDnUOB3pgw)\nPretty good stuff!  Of the three, the chicken was the best - moist and very flavorful.  The grilled vegetables were okay (tasty but a little overcooked) and while the shredded pork was fine, it was repetitive against my carnitas dish.\n\n-- CARNITAS - Michoacan style Marinated Chunks of Pork, served with guajillo and chile de arbot salsa ...$17\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/colibri-mexican-bistro-san-francisco?select=vmWmzTrflpZFSCOOFod_wg#CRDnFnHafpJNlVVHVaODVQ)\nI ordered this just so I could compare it directly to Nopalito's and I thought the two were pretty comparable.  Nopalito's was a little more tender and juicy, but I thought Colibri's was better seasoned and flavorful.  Pretty solid either way.\n\n-- CREPAS CON CAJETA - Crepes with Cajeta (syrup of caramelized milk) and Vanilla Ice Cream...$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/colibri-mexican-bistro-san-francisco?select=vmWmzTrflpZFSCOOFod_wg#vKTonA9xJu2OqXcZaN2Hkw)\nI wasn't hungry for dessert, but my friend really wanted to try this (she's got a serious sweet tooth).  The crepe itself wasn't that special (it got pretty soggy by the end), but the carjeta was so good!  A little too sweet, but still silky and delicious.\n\nWhile our meal was pretty good overall, one of the highlights was definitely the tortillas that so many others have already mentioned.  Not only were they oh so warm and fluffy, but they helped to fill us up too.  Portion sizes are a little light, but the taste of the food justifies the price.  Between Colibri and Nopalito, it's nice to know there are some nicer Mexican spots in the city!", "author": "Mike L."}

The food on the other hand was absolutely uneatable. We ordered Guacamole and found two long blonde hairs in it. We didn't say anything. Then the food came and both plates were drenched in a bitter, over powering uneatable sauce. Colibri is definitely not a michelin star restaurant. I think the reason people keep going back to this place is not for the food but rather for the cocktails, drinks, Spanish music and ambient.", "author": "Michelle C."}

The host decided to sit us in the very back though where it was freezing and after I asked to be seated toward the front she immediately said NO and said it wasn't possible. Then the server came over and asked if it was cold, and I said yes! So she moved us toward the front near the window. On the way to be seated I asked the bartender Adrianne or Adrianna what was the price for a shot of their top shelf tequila and she responded \"It should be in drink menu check\" ! This instantly blew my mind. I asked for her name 3 times before she finally mumbled her name and I walked away. Fast forward we stayed to eat which I don't know why, after the type of service that was being provided. The enchiladas were not good the cheese was not even melted, the chilaquiles said it had chicken! When the plate arrived there was 2 tiny pieces of chicken. The posole was alright, it had chicken which was RUBBERY. So I guess it was a good thing the other plates didn't have any chicken because it was gross anyways. Over all the service was bad along with the food. I don't recommend this place unless your coming to do bottom less mimosas.

He tried to force us to sit at the bar, even though there were no open seats. We asked him point blank, \"are you telling us to move?\" He said \"yes.\"  No apology or anything.

Everything we ended up doing was completely spontaneous and proved to be for the best. Around 9:30pm, all of us were starved and knew a night of fun needed to start with a filling dinner. Two doors down from our hotel, close to union square, was a Mexican restaurant called Colibri. We didn't have reservations and when we asked for a table for 4, they said it was one hour to an hour and a half long wait. Sadly, we retreated to find less of a wait elsewhere. We wandered the streets for about 20 minutes and found nothing of interest that had a reasonable wait. We decided to settle on a pizza by the slice place. We were passing by Colibri again when one of my friends geniously decided to recheck the wait. Surprisingly they had a table for 4, no wait.\n\nI was pleasantly satisfied with the quality of everything  I ate that night. Having not read any reviews, I was hoping to find something to love. We ordered chips and guac, which were so fresh and had an excellent lime taste. They also brought out 3 different types or salsa. Something for everyone. For my entre, I ordered the Filete Mignon. Their filet was cooked perfectly medium rare, had an ancho chili stuffed with goat cheese and was served with mashed potatoes mixed with spinach. I literally cleaned my plate. It was one of the best meat dishes I've had in a long time. I was so thrilled.\n\nThe next morning, we decided to check out their brunch. I ordered a bottomless mimosa for $10 and the Torrejas Colibri. This was their house special Mexican cinnamon toast  served with a variety of fruit. The presentation was fantastic and looked beautiful. The dish was quite tasty, but the cinnamon toast was a little mushy.\n\nMy only set back in general was the customer service.

Bottomless mimosa brunch at Colibri did not suck at all.\n\nWe made reservations at Noon but didn't need it. There were plenty of other tables opened which made us wonder why we got stuck in the furthest table in the restaurant right by where the servers dump the dirty dishes. But compared to the long lines at other brunch places, it wasn't bad at all. Our server got us up and running with our [$10 bottomless] mimosas, warmed tortillas, and salsas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/colibri-mexican-bistro-san-francisco?select=Hy9L2WqwxqKC_yL7LIlrog#Hy9L2WqwxqKC_yL7LIlrog) quickly. \n\nIt's a fun brunch menu. Apart from classics like Mole and ceviche, they take a playful Mexican spin on brunch classics.

The carnitas didn't seem to have the crispiness one would expect from a deep fried piece of meat but it did possess quite a bit of slow-stewed flavors. My friend's Mexican Egg Benedict (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/colibri-mexican-bistro-san-francisco?select=Hy9L2WqwxqKC_yL7LIlrog#e4C3TfIP_OZgS3g3a5_QQg) was pretty good too. The corn shells were an interesting sub for the English muffin and the chipotle hollandaise sauce pulled everything together. \n\nOur server was slow with topping up our mimosas mid-way through the meal but maybe that was because of our obscure table in the corner. He was pretty good at refilling our glasses after we asked him.

I think our reservation was for around 20 of us and we were seated right away. Because a few others couldn't make it there were about three extra seats. This was the day of record breaking amounts of rain and power outages all over the city, so I think that just a few people not making it, wasn't too bad. \n\nThis was a work dinner and I didn't pay for my meal, so I can't elaborate on the prices. We had a set menu with a few items to choose from. I explained to the waitress that I didn't want anything with tomatoes and she said that nothing on our set menu had tomato. Low and behold, the first thing that they brought to me was a tomato based soup. I asked for a salad instead, and the other waiter reluctantly brought it out after he questioned me. The salad was good, so I can't complain about that, because and they did accommodate me after I'd initially ordered the tortilla soup. My entree was Chile Relleno stuffed with Chicharron, it was ok... but by that time I had a few of the five star margaritas. \n\nOur choices for desserts were flan and an ice cream and stuffed churro. I went with the churro option and it didn't disappoint. The flan option didn't appear to be bad either.  \n\nI wouldn't go back, but overall, it was a good experience.", "author": "Heather P."}

While the Guac is delicious and is served beautifully with a spread of 2-3 additional sauces, the prices here are just pretty steep for Mexican food in my opinion. \n\nI dropped nearly $100 on Guac, a \"pitcher\" of mediocre sangria (really just a carafe) that had no fruit in it at all, and a couple of beers/drinks.\n\nThe lighting is bright and the inside feels pretty casual, albeit \"upscale.\" Although the food is decent and they make authentic tortillas (handmade by a tortilla lady in the kitchen and they come out piping hot), I just don't think this spot is a good value for a date night or two people. It is probably more oriented for large party sizes so all the entrees can be shared in a large group setting. \n\nOverall, a convenient Mexican restaurant by Union Square, but nothing to rave about.

We had Miguel as our waiter and he was alright until the check came--totaling almost $450. As a party of six, with each couple totaling around $65, we quickly brought the attention to our waiter to \"fix\" our bill. I have attached a photo as evidence. He charged us an extra 3 margaritas, beers (no one ordered beer), tostadas, a filet entr\u00e9e, duck entr\u00e9e and several other meals that we never ordered/or were served. His first attempt at \"fixing\" the bill meant taking $100 off--but it was still WRONG. The third attempt he brought over the manager, a short and stout soft spoken man who then started arguing with us at the table about what we ordered. He and the waiter go back for 30 minutes ((it is now past midnight and we just want to leave the restaurant)) and come back with a 4th bill that is STILL WRONG. At this point everyone at the table is very upset at being mistreated, they obviously thought we were drunk enough to just throw our credit cards in the folder and not check that they weren't scamming us. Then the manager yells at our table and then points at me and says, \"You come out back with me!\". Excuse me? I refuse and our friend, who is celebrating his birthday, goes outside with the manager instead. As soon as the little man leaves the area, this large Hispanic woman, named Natalie Lopez (as she proudly says to report her as)  pounces on our table and accuses all of us of being \"racist pigs\" because we were disputing our bill. She says that we have \"white privilege\" and goes on and on expressing her grievances. She screams at us for a good ten minutes, while we try to defend the fact that we were being charged more than $250 over what we ordered! This woman was out of control, not to mention out of line for yelling at paying patrons of an establishment, and should NEVER be working in a customer-service environment.

It was a weekend at peak time, so I thought they would be packed, but they weren't.  That, for me, wasn't a good sign.  When we arrived, we found many open tables.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nCOCKTAILS - We ordered a Mojito and another one I can't remember, but they were both very strong.  I didn't really care for mine, so I asked if they could add more mango puree to my drink.  Kudos to them for offering to get me a new drink.  Still didn't like the second one they brought me, although the pressure was on for me to like it!\n\nCHICKEN CHILI VERDE - Waiter's recommendation.  Sorry, wasn't my thing.

I can't seem to leave that place without at least one house margarita, but I've also asked the waiter for a surprise margarita and have always liked what they brought me. (bonus: bottomless mimosas during their weekend brunch for $11! WIN.) \n\nThe servers are always so on top of it, often times filling up waters and replacing tortillas before we even realize they're low. Not once have they forgotten something we asked for, and I never feel like they're rushing me to finish. Tonight, the manager (Dennis?), stopped by our table to make sure everything was perfect, and I have to admit that it's no surprise that everyone is so on top of it in that restaurant! It's apparent that he truly values each customer and wants to make sure we have a good experience. His attitude is clearly rubbing off on his team, and it's my experience tonight that made me want to write this review, although I've been eating here for years! Keep up the good work Colibri! : )", "author": "Melanie M."}

I will just say two things:\n\n1) This place was recommended to me by one of my good friends who has lived in San Francisco for a long time, and she knows what she's talking about. Her family has been involived in the hospitality industry for many years. So I knew Colibri would be good.\n\n2) We ordered the appetizer of guacamole with hand made corn tortillas. The guacamole was delicious, just the way I would expect it to be made.The hand made corn tortillas - those were the best I have ever tasted in my life. You won't find many hand made corn tortillas... Hard to compete with the tortilla making machines.. But as soon as I opened up the warm towel containing the corn tortillas my eyes lit up.   The best I have ever seen or tasted in my life, and I have had hand made corn tortillas many times.", "author": "Harry M."}

Luckily, I was cajoled into going to Colibri. What an experience.\n\nFrom the moment we were seated, walking past the ornate, tequila-centric bar into the dining room - adorned with old art from Central Mexico as well as one of the more impressive tequila collections housed on the West Coast - we were treated like royalty. The staff was excellent, and so were the margaritas. At only $5 with a lunch special (and this was at 3pm), we worked our way through the first delicious agave concoction while munching on the homemade, warm tortillas with three salsas - a beautiful, smokey number; a fruity, light salsa and a hard-hitting serrano verde. Great start to the meal. \n\nFollowing up with the pozole verde, we were transported to puebla or michoacan as the rich lusciousness of the broth was matched only by the harmony of the hominy and tender chicken. The generous cabbage, radish, red onion, oregano & lime condiment plate was the standard perfectionist complement to the starter. Served with tostadas, this was easily a meal in itself. \n\nFor the entrees, we ordered the mole poblano - a work of art in itself, and as delicious as it was beautiful - as well as the tacos surtidos, which included a trio of fresh, fist-sized tacos (fish w/ papaya pineapple; chicken w/ chipotle cream; steak with red onion & cabbage). \n\nWe couldn't resist ordering dessert. The churros rellenos reflected the traditional pastry, filled with cajeta & caramel & served with dulce de leche ice cream, it made for a perfect cap on a wonderful meal. \n\nI will absolutely recommend Colibri Mexican Bistro on the same level as a Red O, Mercado or La Serenata De Garibaldi in Los Angeles. Great food, buen sabor.", "author": "Evan L."}

Let me count the ways.\n\nMy friend and I sat at a booth table directly next to other patrons, despite the fact that the restaurant was mostly empty and there were plenty of other seats. I just want to say I'm not a fan of this style of seating, I feel like I'm involved with the other party's conversation, maybe because I'm a serial eavesdropper. Either way, whatever, it was a seat and the restaurant is really nice inside. \n\nSo we ordered bottomless mimosas which are $10 with an entree and were asked if we wanted to order, but we said we wanted to have a few drinks and look over the menu before choosing our food. So our glasses emptied. And we waited. And waited. And flagged down busboys and waiters and were largely ignored. \n\nUmmm, it's bottomless mimosas and we are paying customers, I think it's only fair to keep the glasses full, and there were not many other people in the restaurant. This happened several times, and we were asked several more times if we were ready to order. I was having flashbacks of my childhood, basically being told that I had to eat my veggies before I could have a dessert. They were definitely holding out on our drinks, and we were not having it. \n\nSide note: even if we didn't order an entree, they would have made MORE money off of us if they had charged per glass, so not sure why they were pressuring us to order and not serving us drinks. ALSO, the mimosas were excessively sweet, like syrupy sweet, I added a little lemon juice which made them bearable.\n\nSo when we did order our entrees, we were both unimpressed. She had the Pozole Verde ($13) which was very small for the price, but the flavor was pretty good. It came with diced radish and romaine lettuce garnish. I had the Tacos de Huevos con Chorizo ($12) which consisted of three teeny tiny corn tortillas with a scrambled eggs/chorizo combo and grilled Nopales. The tacos were bland, but our waiter brought out a tray of different salsas, my choice was habanero and it was very spicy and made the tacos taste better.\n\nOverall, I must say that I will not be back, nor would I recommend this spot to others. One star for being a nice restaurant and one star because our server was nice after we ordered our food. There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants that serve larger portions and serve tastier food.", "author": "Crystal C."}

That misconception went out the window when I started to talk to the hostess and bartender. \n\nThe bartender Jesus was amazing. He was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable of his tequila and he is from La Capital, El DF. He was on top of my order and drinks, I even offered to buy him a shot of Don Julio. He accepted the shot and then he got me two sample shots of tequila, Casa Noble and another one I forgot the name. Maybe I should stop drinking?\n\nI ordered my food and Jesus brought out some handmade tortillas and three salsas. I love the concept of no chips and salsa and just bring out some awesome tortillas. The portions were well served and not too big. Now on to the Carnitas. First a little Carnitas history since Carnitas are from my parents home state of Michoacan. Carnitas are a gift to you from the lovely people of Michoacan, you're welcome. Carnitas means \"Little Meats\", the pork is simmered until the meat is tender and cooked over very low heat. Once the Carnitas are cooked the heat is turned up and the top of the pork begins to crisp. Colibri has their Carnitas game down. \n\nThe meat was soft yet crispy on the outside, the rice was traditional Spanish rice served with a side of beans. As I was eating my Carnitas more delicious tortillas came out. Jesus suggest we try the dessert.  My friend had the Caballeros Pobres which means \"The Poor Gentlemen\" when I tasted this dessert it automatically reminded me of a traditional Mexican dessert my mom makes, its called Capirotada. It is pretty much a very sweet bread pudding. If I can pinpoint this traditional Mexican dessert that my momma makes this place is LEGIT! \n\nI ordered the Churros stuffed with Cajeta and served with a side of ice cream. I ate each and every single crispy cinnamony churro deliciousness. Colibri is outstanding, their bartender Jesus was awesome and their food delicious.", "author": "Veronica H."}

The guacamole was amazing and came with excellent small tortillas, fresh-made and hot. The steak was perfectly cooked, tender, and had an amazing sauce with delicious mashed potatoes. The mole poblano was perfectly smoky and rich, and didn't overwhelm the chicken it covered at all. And the coffee-tequila flan was delicious as well. All would be must-gets if you come here, but I'm guessing everything else is delicious as well.\n\nWe also got a tequila flight (I'm a tequila fan) and it was excellent.

They also offered a sampler for around $20-$30. \n\nI ordered the Sopes Sutros (a trio of savory treats on a small bready crust) in vegetarian only. I checked out the size of these at a nearby table and decided that I needed more food. I ordered the chips - which were fantastic!  Shortly after I started to munch on my chips, the waiter brought over some thick corn tortillas with 3 types of salsas. The mild one in yellow was the most flavorful one in my opinion. I started eating them and I was stuffed. So in the future, I would just order a main course with just chips and guacamole for appetizer. \n\nThe Sopes finally showed and man were they worth it!!!  All I can say is wow!  By the time I polished off the last of the Sopes, I was stuffed. No room for an entree or a dessert. \n\nThe reason I gave them only 3 stars is because of the slow service. The tables next to me were served promptly but not mine. \n\nI will be back again and will be a bit more intelligent with my order. I am going to try out a couple of margaritas. \n\nNote:  For people that enjoy hot and spicy salsa, ask your waiter/waitress for the hot habanero salsa. It will take some time to get it to your table, but well worth the wait.", "author": "Gopal R."}

Then I moved to New Mexico, and fell in love with their food. So because of that, I really want Mexican food to be full of flavor, and a lot of places in California are just bland in comparison. My parents suggested that we try Colibri as they've recently discovered it. I was a bit hesitant after their last suggestion, but we went for it.\n\nI'm really glad we did. I made a booking for a Friday night around 8 pm. The place was busy when we arrived, but not packed. They do seem to have the weird partial communal dining set-up going along one wall, but luckily the table next to us was a massive table of six, so we had a lot of space to spread out. \n\nWe ordered the guacamole and the queso fundido to start. Here, everything is served with small, delicious corn tortillas. We did pay the extra $2 for chips, but hey, the tortillas are fantastic, so it doesn't really matter. It's a bit strange though, because we weren't sure they heard both of the orders as the guac came really early (and even though we asked for it spicy, it wasn't really that spicy) so we weren't sure the queso was coming. It did finally make an appearance, and it was quite tasty. For mains we had the chicken mole and the braised lamb shank. It's sometimes easier just to eat half and split, so that's what we did. Since the mole was best (my partner swears it was better than the one I make, which reminds me I need to make it again), my partner was slightly disappointed when he had to give it up. The lamb was tasty though, just didn't really match up to the mole.\n\nNo desserts as clearly we had already eaten too much, but my partner decided to get a tequila tasting to end, and the tequilas were brilliant. And the sangrita it was served with was deliciously spicy. I just went for the Mexican coffee.\n\nThe service was a bit weird as we never really knew what was going on, but overall it was fine. Definitely one of the tastier places to get Mexican, if you find Cali-Mex bland, as I do. If you're a huge Cali-Mex fan, this may not be the place for you.", "author": "Grant T."}

If I could imagine a romantic, Spanish movie this is how the house would look. \n\nWe came here with a friend who loves this place. So when she suggested we get the guac at around 10AM, I was a little hesitant. That and because I have been trying to avoid chips (of any varieties) like the plague, so I wasn't too keen on eating spoonfuls of guac. However, little did I know it was served with warm tortillas...jackpot. Not spicy, great flavor and a great appetizer for breakfast. Guac of champs :)\n\nOur original server was awesome, he was attentive, helpful, and genuinely a sweet human being. Then his, who we assumed was his manager, came over and was awful. She tried to take our drink order when we'd already placed it, then she demanded we order shortly after. She was curt, not friendly...I'm not really sure why she even came to our table. We were content with our lovely server, whose name is currently slipping my mind.\n\nSlightly hung over or something, I wasn't into the menu much. It's not huge, but very Mexican themed. I decided all I wanted was egg whites (which I specifically asked if they make) and a side of Spanish rice. However, when my food arrived I had two over easy eggs and my rice. I literally didn't want to interact with this woman/manager/employee, so I just ate the whites from the eggs.\n\nOh the coffee...that stuff was amazing. We jokingly asked the server why it was so good, he teasingly responded \"because it has tequila in it\"! It gave us all a good laugh, hours after we left our breakfast adventure. The coffee cups are small, espresso sized to be exact, but they kept filling our cups. I think the three of us averaged 5 cups during a 2 hour breakfast span. The coffee was perfectly roasted and the flavor was buttery delicious, I only added a hint of sugar, which is unlike me (normally it's a packet or two per cup).\n\nWe decided to splurge and shared dessert - the churros and the doughnuts. I think the doughnuts name loosely translated to poor gentleman. Of course, with that name I was destined to love that dessert more. The churros were not good, over fried, and the caramel center tasted very artificial. However, this poor gentleman doughnut was like Texas toast rolled in sugar and cinnamon. It was crunchy and soft, with just the right amount of sweetness (which tasted great with my 5th or 6th cup of coffee).\n\nIt's a tad pricey, but find a place that isn't in Union Square. The d\u00e9cor was adorable and we were able to guzzle gallons of delicious coffee, with one the sweetest servers ever. Their menu deserves more attempts on my part, so I won't mind visiting again...\n\nGuac and coffee don't normally go together...but here, it's acceptable!", "author": "Steph G."}

Not even boneless chicken. My dinner companion's vegetarian stuffed pepper was about the size of a sushi hand roll. No wonder the servers strongly encourage you to get one of their $12 appetizers: you will leave hungry (unless, like me, you eat all the warm tortillas). \n\nNice atmosphere, friendly servers, nice presentation of the dishes, all that.

Colibri is a classy higher-end modern version of your favorite local Mexican eatery. The food is every bit just as good if not even better. \n\nI was lured here by Dine About Town event and I have never heard of this place before. Since they didn't post their DAT menu online I really had no idea what I was getting into. Most of the dishes on their DAT lunch menu were part of their regular menu. That is a welcoming sign. I really dislike it when some restaurants, especially those more expensive ones, only provide some cost cut watered down DAT 'specials' that are nothing like their regular dishes. The idea of DAT is to encourage people to get out and discover new places. It is just plain crazy to not show your customers the best. \n\nOut of everything I have tried, the Carnitas (Marinated chunks of pork) and Chile Relleno with Carnitas and Chicharron (Poblano pepper stuffed with pork) really stood out. They did both of these pork dish really well. The meat was well seasoned, nicely cooked to a tender yet crisp texture. Carne asada estilo Sonora (Grilled steak with cactus and portobello mushrooms) was just mediocre. I didn't find the sauce too memorable. I guess I still prefer to have my steak cooked the caveman way (grilled on open fire, seasoned with salt and pepper).\n\nFor dessert we all had the Churros Rellenos. Not sure if that is available on the regular menu but oh boy that was good. Friend of mine said that was the best Churros she had. While I am not sure if I could agree, those churros was indeed very delicious. \n\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated with a colorful and vibrant ambiance. The bar looks lovely.

I'd return right now and have it all again.: \n \n* A few margaritas (all different) @ $10 - $14 apiece;\n* The freshest, most I'LL-HAVE-MORE-OF-THAT inducing Pescado Ceviche for $16;\n* Excellent vat of guacamole served with prepared-for-me corn tortillas ($12; could've used more spice, even though we told 'em we wanted it spicy);\n* Little tacos stuffed with roasted pork and pickled red onions ($12, muy perfecto); and\n* Coffee-tequila flan ($8, a-ok) \n\nI like the look and feel of Colibri a lot.  It's got cool light fixtures, a great assortment of unusual tequila bottles in the window, comfy seats, and really good service (thanks Camilla!).  \n\nIt's always well-populated with a nice assortment of hipsters on up, many of them grabbing drinks or appetizers  before a show at ACT (which is right across the street).  Really, nothing not to like here, except for the price, which definitely adds up.  \n\nColibri has inspired me to learn how to make my own ceviche.  \n\nDefinitely worth checking out, expecially before a show.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Highly recommend!\nEgg Tacos (service with green peppers and black beans) - Didn't like this dish at all :( So very try and it was lacking flavor on all three components of the dish.

I know that Union Square is a tourist trap where you're going to be overcharged for small portions of mediocre food, but this was quite possibly the worst bang-for-buck experience I've ever had.\n\nThey do not have complementary chips and salsa; instead, you can purchase guacamole for $12 with the opportunity to buy chips for an extra $2. (Because, you know, some people might just want $12 worth of guac without chips.) We ordered chips with salsa; they claimed the salsa was complementary, but they failed to refresh it at any point during the evening.\n\nI ordered a beer, which they can't water down, but my five friends ordered various forms of mixed drinks. Instead, they received soda with trace amounts of alcohol. Let's just say nobody was well lubricated.\n\nI ordered a chicken dish for $18, which was the minimum for any dish. Okay, that's fine; it's union square. I wasn't expecting the best mexican food, but I was expecting a normal sized dish. Instead, my dish arrived with two tiny chicken wings and a small cup of corn salsa. That's it. Had this been an appetizer, or a single tapas dish where you were supposed to order 5 dishes to fill up, it would have made sense. Instead, all I could do was look at my girlfriend, who was laughing, knowing that I could have eaten five times the portion set down in front of me without blinking. The quality was mediocre - not terrible, probably best described as bland.\n\nWhat they lacked in food portions, they attempted to match in ambiance. It was a Monday night with Monday night football and playoff baseball happening. However, the single, small TV above the bar chose neither sporting option, but instead replayed a muted black and white spanish film. I'm sure tons of patrons come to a bar wanting to watch soundless, colorless foreign films, right?\n\nI don't mean to be harsh - I'm not in the business of ripping on restaurants...but at the same time, we spent ~$40 per person for a tiny portion of mediocre food and a watered-down drink.

Soooo good. Lots of lime and lemon flavors and perfectly creamy. Only downfall is there charge $2 extra for chips. Between a party of 5, you will need another bowl of chips unless you are content with the warm tortillas they bring out in the beginning with three different sauces. And those sauces are excellent. Spicy, mild and fruity. Thumbs up. \n\nDrinks- All around no complaints in this department. 2 folks ordered fancy tequila (I can't remember the kind) and it was delicious.

My boyfriend and his friend ordered the Filet Mignon which my boyfriend describes as \"good, but the portion wasn't big...but then again it was 22 bucks. I like the chiles + the spinach and mole sauce were good.\" End quote. My two girlfriends ordered off the appetizer menu too and were not as satisfied. Chicken tostadas (shredded chicken on a chip) and the Mole Shrimp (I think there were 3 shrimps on her plate). I didn't taste their dishes so I can't comment. Overall, the entree wasn't the highlight for all 5 of us. \n\nDesert: You basically must have the stuffed churros + ice cream..... Just do it and hit the gym in the morning. With the smaller portions, you should have room. I could have just eaten that for dinner (no lie). \n\nOverall, I don't think I would go back unless I wanted to have a drink, guacamole and share some appetizers.

I always thought it was a great place to send people to, when they're down in the area and aren't brave enough to venture out to other parts of the city.\n\nTwo stars is for very bad behavior and no customer service follow-up what-so-ever. My husband and I had lunch their during the weekday a couple of weeks ago. The waitress decided to gift herself an additional $5 on the tip, by changing the \"4\" in \"14\" to a \"9\" - changing the tip we left from $14 to $19. My husband called the restaurant and left a message and never heard back from them. Now we have to go through our credit card company to address the rip-off.\n\nWhen we eat out - we are very conscientious about leaving GOOD tips for servers - SF is not a service-industry-worker friendly city and we recognize that.

The service was terrific, the food was very good, and for tequila snobs like myself, they had a terrific selection that would satisfy most connoisseur's tastes and budgets.

The only disappointing dish was the chicken mole. Also the Mexican chocolate cake was delicious.  And the pricing was appropriate for the food and the service.

It's not what I expected for a place that garnered quite a bit of praise over the years from food critics.\n\nOnto the food. A Mexican friend recommended this place, so we had high hopes for the food. We started with the guacamole, and had the mole poblano and duck in green mole sauce. Of course, there was the complimentary fresh tortillas and salsa -- you could also request chips.\n\nThe salsas (spicy, tomatillo, pineapple) were very good. I couldn't stop eating them, and the pineapple salsa was really fruity and delicious. The guacamole though, disappointed me. We asked for spicy, but barely any spice showed through. It was very fresh...but what guacamole is not fresh in California? ;)\n\nOnto the main dishes. The mole poblano was rich and delicious, and the dark meat was very tender and good. The breast pieces were unfortunately a bit dry, but I'm just nitpicking ;) Whereas the duck with green mole was fabulous. It was juicy, tender and delicious, and totally over shadowed the mole poblano. Guess what I'm getting next time.\n\nDesserts were good too. The stuffed churros were different from the usual variety, and didn't disappoint. They also have agavero, which is the best sweet tequila there is on earth.\n\nIf only their service wasn't so sparse and unattentive...they didn't clear plates out despite the table being full, and we had to flag them down when we needed attention.

I also ordered corn on the cob which was also delicious but for $5, I don't feel my two items totaling $23 was worth the cost. I think my biggest disappointment was that considering this is a \"mexican\" restaurant I expected authentic cuisine like enchilladas, tacos, burritos, refried beans, etc. There is none of that here. It seems more like a fusion restaurant since they have fillet mignon, shrimp, chicken breast, etc, on the menu.

For starters, we had the guacamole with chips. If this is your first time, you will miss out if you don't try the guac! My lunch entree was the carnitas and all you can eat homemade tortillas. My wife and son ordered the Tortita de Papas. For an extra $5 you get the house margarita on the rocks which was excellent. The service was extremely friendly, attentive, and prompt as I expected it to be. My carnitas tasted delightful with the mild chile sauce (ask for extra right off the bat). I was anxious to try their mojito since I am on a ninja mission to find the perfect mojito, and too bad it's not here.  The drink was way too sweet for my liking.  But this was no problem, and they exchanged it for a margarita-sweet!  \n\nUsed a google offers voucher: $25 for $40 worth of lunch credit. \n\nHighly recommend! \n\n(+) house made tortillas\n(+) variety of margaritas\n(++)wholly molly guacamole!!\n(+) Family friendly (lunchtime)", "author": "Denis A."}

Great location, great decor, great lighting.\n\nService: 4 stars. Hosts and waiters were really friendly and attentive. A really pleasant staff.\n\nPresentation: 4 stars. All our drinks and dishes were presented beautifully, and each dish was a miniature piece of visual art. It's a shame that the flavors didn't compare.\n\nFood: 1.5 stars.\nWe started with the guacamole, which was mediocre at best. It had a nice creamy texture, but didn't taste particularly fresh. They claim it's \"freshly made,\" but I am very, very skeptical. I'd much prefer Wholly Guacamole from your local grocery store aisle over Colibri's guac. (I'm a guac fanatic, so I can definitely recommend some decent restaurants with amazing housemade guacamole.) We also had to pay an extra $2 to add chips to our guac, which was a bit unusual. The chips were hard.\n\nPer Yelpers' recs, I ordered the Mole Pablano and my husband ordered the Chile Relleno (veggie and cheese). I'm sorry to say that Yelpers have led me astray this time. ):\n\nThe Mole Poblano chicken was dry, and the sauce tasted merely of cocoa and nuts, devoid of any spices. Very dark and plain, IMO. The side of rice that came with it lacked flavor, as well. Perhaps I'm just not a mole poblano fan, but this dish definitely did not impress. I couldn't even finish it, and the portions weren't very large to begin with.\n\nThe Chile Relleno was subpar to what we could make at home, and we aren't the best chefs when it comes to Mexican. The chili pepper itself was fine (just your average pepper, I guess!) but the vegetables (a mix of squashes) were bland and mushy. We're not even sure if there was cheese on it. When I turned away from my mole poblano, my husband offered me his chile relleno, and I really couldn't find either one appetizing.\n\nStrangely enough, both dishes reminded me of the type of flavors in your microwaveable Lean Cuisines from the frozen aisle. Curious.\n\nThe highlights of the meal were the complimentary salsa (the salsa verde was decent) and corn tortillas (fresh and fluffy; much better than the chips), along with the company, of course. Friends who ordered drinks said the mojitos were pretty good, too.\n\nOur friends ordered the duck (Pato En Mole Verde Pipian), and said it was decent, so I guess if we ever need to come back, we would opt for the mole verde. I don't see that happening, though. After tax and tip, our bill for a party of 4 was about $45/person with 1 shared guac and 2 drinks. Pricey, particularly for food that tasted bland and reheated.\n\nI guess I'm really more of a $10-burrito-in-the-Mission girl, when it comes to Mexican food.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

I was in town for a meeting and there was a group dinner. Pass! My friend and I ditched the group and went in search for a different restaurant. The hotel staff recommended a place close to Union Square. The good recommendation came with poor directions. We got to Colibri and decided to give it a shot. \n\nIt's hard to describe the style of cuisine. It is not traditional Tex-Mex. It's more of a modern twist on Tex-Mex. They start you off with warm tortillas and three salsas: 1 mild, 1 hot, and 1 sweet. They're all good. My entree favorite is the carnitas. I will look at the other menu items but something really has to catch my eye to get me to move away from the carnitas. It's tender, mostly lean, and well-seasoned. The service typically leaves a bit to be desired. [Sometimes a lot to be desired...like the time I was left alone at the bar when I was finished and needed to cash out to get to a meeting.]\n\nMy guilty pleasure when I eat at Colibri is when they show El Santo movies on the TV above the bar. [I'm a big fan of El Santo y la Museo Del Cera.] If I can make it here for lunch, El Santo and eating at the bar is an hour well spent.", "author": "Dave C."}

These were all delicious, especially the orange (mango?) salsa and the green (tomatillo?) salsas. They were not stingy with any of this and kept bringing it, so we basically filled up. \n\nLUCKY FOR US. \n\nThe kichen wasn't just slow, they were glacier-like. It took more 35 minutes to get what was basically egg tacos. I seriously started to wonder if they had to go gather the eggs. When they did come they were simple and good, although not spicy bought for me so I added plenty of salsa. There was no pepper on the table, which I would have liked. \n\nWhen we walked out I told the hostess how great our waitress was but how bad the kitchen was.

My friend chose this restaurant since we were in the area and I'm glad I tried it out!\n\nIt's a really warm and cozy restaurant. They were pretty busy but we found a table near the door that no one else wanted to sit at so we sat there and avoided what could have been a long wait on a Thursday night!\n\nThey serve warm tortillas with 3 different salsas instead of the normal chips and salsa. This I definitely appreciated! The tortillas were wonderful and the variety of salsas were fun.\n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the shrimp ceviche. This was good to me, not the best I've had. If I would have known beforehand about the tortillas and salsa, I could have gone without the ceviche appetizer.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the most popular dish - the chicken mole. I don't know if it's because the chicken was dry, or if it's because my friend got a way better dish, but I was sort of disappointed in it. It was served with rice and it was just ok. I may just not be a fan of mole either. The sauce never tastes very flavorful to me.\n\nMy friend on the other hand got the shrimp plate with cornbread. O-M-G - best freakin' corn bread I've ever tasted! I'd go back for the corn bread alone. It's the first time I've had corn bread that had actual corn in it and just melts in your mouth. Odd for a mexican restaurant but I definitely didn't complain. She also let me try some of her shrimp and that was on point too! It went so well with the corn bread. She definitely won on the better pick, but I'm glad she let me try some of her food because it was so good!\n\nEach entree was around $17 - not cheap, but it's quality.

I am an expert on guacamole. I know how to make it to appeal to different crowds of people, myself, my family, etc. I know what makes good guac, and what makes bad guac, down to every fine detail. \n\nThe guac here is GOOD. It was a little heavy on the onion, and the onion could have been chopped just a tad finer, but I like onions so that did not bother me. If you are not a fan of onions, ask them to tone it down. In fact, give them your preferences up front on onion ratio, as well as spiciness. Nothing else, otherwise it gets too complicated. Just say light/heavy onion/heat. \n\nThe rest of the meal was very good. Not above expectations hence not getting 5 stars, but very good and did not disappoint. I would experiment all over this menu if there weren't more places to eat in the city than I will have time for in my lifetime.", "author": "Jesten T."}

Laura Only came to bring us what we had ordered but never to ask if we were doing ok after the food had arrived. One of the busboy was whom came to ask if we needed something els.I and my family purposely went to eat at Colibri Mexican Bristo to celebrate my fathers birthday taking into account the Yelp reviews. Unfortunately, my dad who was celebrating his birthday was in the middle of his 2nd Tequila shot, ready to ask for his 3d. Let me just make it clear there was no legal sign posted at the restaurant beverage menu much less the Bar that stated that there was a limit of 3 alcohol drinks. Alejandra came over to serve the tequila shot and said \" I will serve you your last tequila shot ok\". We  automatically responded that my father was totally ok. We were complimenting the food to the waitress and we're having such a great time and enjoying the food. I find it very unprofessional that Alejandra came to say that to us while giving my father his Tequila shot. By then we were already disgusted sick to our stomach because the waiter never came to check on us, and when some one did it was to decide my dads last drink. Mind you the Restaurant has a BAR! Why have a BAR if you are going to have A limit of 3 drinks.  They should of had a sign stating that there was a limit of 3 tequila shots. Also we waited literally 25 min for our check, after three times of already asking for it. For the fourth time I asked Alejandra to bring us our check and she didn't even apologized for the delay. It's ashamed that we will NEVER GO BACK neither would we RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY! I did give a call to the General Manager Joel who currently has not called us back, I hope I get a response asap! Managers like Alejandra will bring a restaurant DOWN! She made a big mistake we've been to so many restaurants, and never have they did what she did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoel O: \nBusiness Manager\nDear Adriana, Thank you for contacting Colibri Mexican Bistro.

Thank you again for reporting this incident, and again our sincere and deepest apologies.\n\n\n\n\nAdriana L: I understand that by law you guys are In charged of preventing intoxication and or serving alcohol irresponsibly, however, you should have a notification on the menu or visible in the restaurant or bar that 3 drinks is the limit like other restaurants provide, and we wouldn't have this problem.

Unlike the rest of my taqueria-centric dining, Colibri is a refined and upscale variation, and quite a different experience.  Located in central SF, this high-ceilinged modern restaurant is warm, classy, yet vibrant in rich red and dark woods.  The dining space is relatively narrow and long, with the bar midday way in on one side.  Staff were very good.\n\nMuch was tempting on their menu but alas, I can only eat so much dining solo.  I started with a standard tequila flight, which arrived in style in a spiral black metal rack, each elegantly flared shot glass held in a loop, with salt and lime to add, and a chaser in the form of tart tomato juice.  I am new to tequila so this was fun to try.  Appetizer was the Ceviche de Camarones, a large bowl of chopped prawns, vegetables, and herbs in a tart, citrus-spiced broth, topped with big avocado slices.  The shrimp were cooked, actually a bit more than I usually like, but having made shrimp ceviche at home, it didn't taste like it was \"cooked\" via citrus, instead tasting like it was cooked first then added to the ceviche mix (or sat in the citrus marinade too long).  Entree (actually an appetizer) was the Tacos Pescado.  These came three to the order, grilled tilapia on warm, fluffy tortillas, generously garnished.  Unfortunately not well-balanced, overwhelmed by toppings, intensely flavored sauce and crunchy sliced vegetables leaving little room for complementary or contrasting flavors and textures, respectively.\n\nThis ended up being the most underwhelming Mexican experience this trip.  Perhaps what I ordered weren't their best choices, because there would seem to be much to like about this handsome restaurant, its interesting menu, and reasonable prices.  Still, food weighs the most in my ratings so for now, will have to hold at 2 stars.", "author": "Valery C."}

Their amazing tortillas come with it, luckily. The ceviche is very good but nothing out of the ordinary. Colibri's homemade salsas are good, but don't expect more than one bowl of chips for the table unless you want to pay. Entree portions are small by American standards, which is actually refreshing, other than the unnecessarily inflated price you pay for them. The entrees themselves are nothing special.\n\nUnless you're at Colibri simply for a tequila or mezcal flight, or cocktails, I would recommend dining at Tropisue\u00f1o instead.

On August 26, on Monday, a low foot traffic night, I witnessed a large contingent from a high profile company struggle with everything from reservations tracking to basic headcount. Even the bar service was inattentive. The investors in the restaurant would have been explosively upset had they witnessed the poor service. \n\nThe General Manager on duty on Monday evening August 26, was poorly trained as I've seen for place of this high stature, and outright unfriendly. I wish the the capital partners who invested in this restaurant could have seen her in action destroying their restaurants image with a party of 10+ senior executives of one of the most prominent companies on earth. The bill was to exceed $1,000, which is clearly more profitable than 10 couples at $100, plus the echo effect of having each of the guests spread the word of their experience could mean thousands more in revenue on a monthly basis.\n\nI've visited this restaurant for tequila and bar stool dining on other occasions, but was absolutely shocked at the incompetence of the GM on duty in a dinner scenario. I highly recommend avoiding this restaurant for any serious dining.\n\nAtmosphere=Good; Food = Fair; Service= Poor\n\nI hope the investors read this , and pull it together on service quickly. The service is a blue print for how to go out of business in the restaurant world.", "author": "R W."}

Chandeliers and lanterns hanging around everywhere.\n\nService: It was tough to flag our servers down to get a refill of chips and salsa.  It was hard to tell who our server was, since everyone was running all over the place.\n\nFood: Guacamole was very good.  They don't mix the guacamole in front of you, in case you were wondering.  I ordered the chicken dish and the chicken was very tender.  It literally almost fell off the bone, in a good way.  We ordered \"Cadillacs\" which is a glorified margarita.  Not sure what the big difference is, as it tasted just like a normal margarita.\n\nConclusion: Good date spot.  Come here for the atmosphere.", "author": "Andrew H."}

Tasty margaritas. \nGenerally though, this is an overpriced non-authentic Mexican place with sub-par food at best. \nInstead of chips and salsa, they recommend their corn tortillas with salsa. The tortillas and especially salsa were not that great. I had chili reyanno for my entre, and it was expensive, not that much food, and bland (not spicy or even savory). Didn't come with rice, which I felt it needed... So I added a side of rice... For $5... They were not willing or able to provide lettuce and tomato on the side when I asked. For a $20 Mexican entre, you can't toss a scrap of lettuce / tomato on the side? Puleaze. Two stars for this place is being generous.

The problem was that I use a wheelchair which I had made a point of telling the hostess about when I made the reservation. I told her both on the phone and when we arrived in person that because of the wheelchair I needed a table near the door. However, instead of seating us at one of the available tables there, we were seated at the table farthest away from the door, without her or the manager even asking us if this was OK. Being seated so far away from the door made our exit very difficult since by the time we finished, the restaurant was much more full. My husband, the wheelchair and I barely had enough room to maneuver around the many tables and the many people who stood at the long bar. It was truly awful to continually bump into tables (whose patrons didn't have much place to move to), as well as up directly against bar patrons (who also had minimal alternative space to go), all just to get back to the front door. The manager just stood next to the door and said he completely understood when we complained to him. Ha-If he really understood he would have perhaps apologized, but certainly would not have chosen to tell the hostess to seat us there. I strongly advise chair users to skip Colibri. We certainly will.", "author": "Nancy F."}

They didn't have any open tables for at least 30 min and it was first come first served in the bar area. \n\nLuckily, we were seated right away for our 8pm reservation. \n\nWe ordered a couple of skinny margaritas and just wanted to share a couple of appetizers to start with. For starters we ordered the guacamole and added chips for $2, the ceviche, and we ordered the tostadas with chicken on it.\n\nThe appetizers came out really quick! But the drinks did come straight out as the waiter came back and said they were really backed up on the bar. And once the margaritas arrived, we tasted them, and they were more tart then expected. My g/f said that usually they use agave nectar to combat the tartness and wasn't sure if they did that here. Still despite the taste, it was tequila so we didn't mind too much and continue to eat and drink and continue our girl talk :)\n\nThe appetizers were ok in flavor but the portions were good sized. Except for the chicken tostadas which were only 3 chips with chicken and guac on top. I felt like They should at least been 4 pcs to make it balanced? \n\nThe guacamole was good but we did ask for it spicy but it wasn't spicy at all to us. That could be because we both love our spicy and so we have a high tolerance for spicy? Again it was a good portion to share and definitely filled us up.\n\nThe ceviche was fresh and delish as well! Had a lot of good chunks of white fish and it was a big portion for two to nibble on. \n\nOverall, this place is nice for drinks and appetizers to share. I say its a little pricey as I do think they charged extra for more chips. Also I'm used to my mexican food to be cheaper and not as fancy as this place but the food is solid and the drinks are strong so definitely a nice place to check out if you are in the area.", "author": "Christine W."}

This afternoon was spent doing the tourist thing.  I mean, I guess you have to do some of that shit, right? A person can only drink and eat so much in an unfamiliar city before your brain realizes that all you've seen are bar stools.\n\nLiving in LA, you become a Mexican food snob.  From taco stands to mom pop restaurants, you have an abundance of options for great Mexican.  So, I wasn't expecting much walking into Colibri.  First thing I noticed was how packed this place was.  We had no reservations on a Saturday night.  The hostess told us it'd be impossible for us to get seats but what she didn't know is that The Man is a Bar God.  Yes... that's right.  The Man can walk into any bar and be seated within about 5 minutes.  If it's longer than 5 minutes, let's say, 6, he gets pissed, looks around anxiously before noticing a couple of bar stools magically appear.  Happens every time.  And it happened again.\n\nThe food here is fantastic.  I hate to admit it, but it put a lot of Mexican restaurants in LA to shame.  The Pazole was seriously one of the best I've ever had.  I love that they give you free homemade corn tortillas to munch on instead of chips.  But, if you want chips?  They have that too.  Thick and perfectly fried.  The Empanadas were my least favorite.  The dough was a bit too thick and the pork filling was just not flavorful enough for me tho, The Man might disagree.  The tequilla flows like a river here.  Order what you will, it'll all be great.  I can't even describe the service because all the restaurants and bars in this city are ran by pros.  Truly amazing.", "author": "S K."}

Complimentary housemade tortillas and a trio of great salsas kick off the dining experience.  They were so good, they disappeared almost immediately.  With bracing citrus acidity and a good amount of heat, the pescado ceviche ($16) perfectly marries Pacific cod with lime, green olives, jalape\u00f1o, onion, cilantro, tomato, avocado, and olive oil.  Although on the small side, the dark, rich mole poblano ($16) combines spices, chiles, nuts, and chocolate into a flavorful sauce served over moist and tasty chicken.  Marinated in fresh herbs, roasted garlic, oregano, and olive oil, the slightly vegetal quality of the nopales asados (grilled young cactus leaves, $8) was complemented by the earthy flavor of succulent portobello mushroom strips.\n\nColibri has a full bar with a super selection of high-end tequilas, so o course, different varieties of margaritas (most around $12) abound.  For those who are not agave lovers, copious options for cerveza and vino exist as well.  Service was friendly, attentive, and relaxed.

Well, I think for the price point it wouldn't kill them to put something on the plate other than the entree.  That's it.  You order carnitas, that's what you get.  You order the relleno, you get a relleno.  You have to order the rice and beans separate (although the side portion is large enough for 2 or 3 people to share) it just seems stingy not to provide it up front.  And it you order Guac, they serve it with corn tortillas, not chips, which makes it a little hard to dip (I know, you are supposed to scoop in this case, but to me Guac and CHIPS go together like bread and butter).  \n\nThe menu is different.  Don't come here expecting any cheese enchiladas, or crispy tacos...\n\nDrinks are good.  Tequila selection is fantastic.  And it's right across the street from the theatre, so very convenient.", "author": "Lindy B."}

We went without reservations and we sat on bar stools with a tiny table. We got the guacamole appetizer which was freshly made and amaaaazing and customizable spicy levels. The tortillas that came with that were soft and sweet. For entrees we got pechuga rellena de huitlacoche, chile relleno, and tortita de papas. The chicken in the pechuga rellena de huitlacoche was cooked very well and wasn't dry. The chile relleno wasn't nearly as spicy as expected. The tortita de papas was my favorite dish. The one thing all the dishes had in common was that they were quite small. They were filling for us since we had the guacamole as well but I feel like if you didn't have an appetizer it wouldn't have been enough. Service wise one of our waiters was very polite but the other two just dropped off food and left, not caring as much. Was it worth going once? Sure. Would I go a second time? Probably not, no.", "author": "Monsi M."}

Remembering how a few Yelpers raved about this place, I thought it would be worthwhile to set ourselves up at a bar table and give it a go. We were sitting next to the sunny guy who ground the fresh avocados into their house specialty guacamole. Granted it costs $10, but it is awfully creamy-tasty, and there was plenty of it. Odd, at least to me, they serve it with small homemade tortillas instead of chips - which is an extra charge.\n\nWe then tried the $9 Tamales Oaxaquenos. Luckily, there were two, and the mole sauce was velvety perfection over a nice, little pillows of chicken obviously made from scratch and not picked up in the freezer at Trader Joe's. Next up were the $14 Carnitas, chunks of fallen-off-the-bone pork served with a special chile salsa. I'm a complete sucker for good carnitas, and these were genuinely yummy.\n\nThe last thing we ordered was a wedge of savory cornbread, the $7 Torta de Elote, filled with bacon and onion bits and ladled with a thick poblano pepper cream sauce. It might as well have been dessert for all its rich flavor. The relatively compact place was packed with people staring at our dishes as they streamed in and out.

We made reservations on Open Table and, thank God, because it was so crowded.  \n\nWe started out with the guacamole ($12), which is not exactly made tableside but at a station somewhere.  We asked for it spicy and it came out mildly spicy but it was so tasty and so much of it.  It comes with corn tortillas. They charge an extra $2 for chips with the guacamole but the tortillas are so good, you won't want the chips.  Plus, you eventually get free chips and salsa so it's not really worth it.\n\nThe margaritas here are excellent! Both the Macho Margarita (a little spicy and $13) and Margarita Amate ($12) were super tasty.  The sangria ($8) here is really sweet, so don't order it unless you like sweet sangria.  The fruit in the sangria has soaked up a ton of alcohol, especially the mango.  I've never had mango in sangria but it is a great addition.\n\nThe carnitas ($16) here are mind-blowingly good.

Instead I logged onto Yelp, approved compliments, approved a friend request and sent compliments. So since I'm here I might as well write a review right?\n\nClaro que si.\n\nMy friend Devo (yes, that is his nickname) stopped by here last night. We had a 6:30 reservation and arrived a little early. They had a table for us and seated us right away.\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye were the bottles of tequila glistening behind the bar. I knew in an instant that this was my kind of place. Our server arrived within a few short minutes and made it a point to show us the drink menu. Ah Yes! Drinks! Si como no!\n\nLately margaritas have bee such a let down. Most are made too sweet and the taste of the tequila is completely lost. It's been all about the mix and less about the tequila. But after reading the reviews and how great their margaritas are I thought I should give it a shot. I went with the Tres Agaves Blanco ($11) which is a \"pure and unaged, capturing the clean and herbaceous taste of pure agave\". Devo went with the Herradura Blanco ($11) a \"moderate earthy aroma, slight amounts of spice, citrus, and floral scents; aged for 45 days in white oak\".\n\nI was impressed that both margaritas were served in short tumbler glasses. One of my biggest pet peeves is when they come out in those huge wide froofy glasses that are the size of a gold fish bowl. I guess this is tradition, but I would rather drink out of something that I can actually hold. So props to Colibri for using normal glassware. Each margarita came out with a wedge of lime and on the rocks. No need to specify rocks or blended here, they do it right. The margaritas were almost crystal clear which is a good sign. I took my first sip and was immediately in love. The tequila was shinning through and just the right amount of mix to help liven it up. I tasted Devo's and liked his too, but preferred the one I ordered. \n\nWhat next? Table side guacamole ($12)? Si.\n\nWe asked for \"spicy\" and within minutes a freshly made batch of guacamole along with fresh house made corn tortillas was sitting on table. Served with a trio of salsas, this appetizer was delicious. They do have chips, but we both preferred the tortillas. My only complaint is that the tortillas were extra tiny, the size of a small Swedish pancake. So piling on the goodies was a challenge.\n\nWhen it came time to order, I was torn between the chili relleno and the carnitas. As I was ordering I just decided to let whatever comes out of my mouth be my dinner of choice. Carnitas ($16) then rolled off my tongue. Devo went with the chicken mole ($16) and we both shared sides of black beans ($6), rice ($6) and corn bread ($8).\n\nThe portion sizes are small, but I think that is how it's meant to be and may be more tapas style and meant to be shared. I will remember this in the future. Both dishes were amazingly good. The carnitas were tender and perfectly cooked. The mole was deep, dark, complex and full of flavor. The chicken like the pork, perfectly cooked and not over done. I would get either dish again in a heartbeat. The sides were good, pretty much standard and solid. The cornbread was the least exciting of the dishes, and I only had a small bite. The only bummer was again the tortillas.

I called early in the day and there weren't any reservations from 4:30 to 8pm. Ok the place is small and apparently popular, I get it but later I'd realize it's not worth the trouble. We showed up around 6 and took our chances. There were several open tables but were told at this point that the earliest we could get one was 10pm. We ended up sitting at the bar, which actually worked out better because looking around, the restaurant tables looked cramped and uncomfortable. \n\nSecond, I'm not cheap but seriously? The portions and prices don't jive. We got the infamous guacamole (btw it's $12 for the guac, plus $2 for chips) and it was good but it definitely wasn't the best I've ever had. It needed some lime juice or cilantro or something. It was sort of bland. It comes with warm tortillas which I expected to be out of this world, but they tasted like the ones I get at the grocery store. You have to order chips separate. I'm sorry, I know it's SF but $14 for a shallow dish of guac and chips? Eh. The margaritas were good too but again, not the best in the world. The bf ordered the fish tacos...same theme..just ok. I ordered the mole prawns..which I think were $20. There were 6 total with a little cornbread muffin...the muffin was actually amazing and the single best thing I ate that night. But for a $20 dish I'd rather go somewhere else.\n\nI think this restaurant has a bigger ego than it should.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-09-23", "description": "Kinda torn about Colibri. We came for dinner yesterday evening with two other friends. We decided to start with a pitcher of sangria, which was very tasty, though at $22 it's worth figuring out whether your whole table enjoys sangria before getting it. We ordered the sopes as an appetizer - there was one veggie sope, one chicken, and one pork. The pork was cooked in their mole, I think, and it was very good, but the other sopes were unremarkable (the veggie one kind of tasted like a chicken pot pie, weirdly enough.)\n\nFor mains, I ordered the carnitas and my date ordered crusted scallops on some kind of bean puree. I now understand after reading some Yelp reviews that even the main dishes are meant to be tapas style, and I can say that if you don't know this, your main dish ends up being pretty boring. For example, the carnitas I got was ONLY carnitas: wads of meat, cup of salsa, the end. Because the other plates happened to look slightly more like complete meals, I thought my carnitas dish was just unusual and I should've gotten something different.\n\nAnyway, the carnitas weren't that hot. The *quality of the meat* was superb, and the meat was cooked superbly, but there was nothing particularly carnitas-y about it. Add to that the fact that that's all my entree consisted of, and you'll know why I was pretty disappointed with that.\n\nTo top it off, the service was pretty poor, even though the restaurant never got that full.\n\nHowever, Colibri really redeemed itself with dessert. I usually don't order whole desserts, I just nibble, but the desserts we got here made me wish I had a dessert all to myself. We got one chocolate pudding and something that basically consisted of vanilla ice cream on top of a beignet-like churro. They were great!!\n\nI'd come back here strictly for dessert, coffee, and tequila (I can't deny that they appear to have a good looking tequila stash, though I did not try any on this visit.) I would rather go next door to Katana-ya for my main meal though! :)", "author": "Josh K."}

The menu seems to have simplified, for lunch at least, but all the dishes are big, filling, and tasty.  Salads are all nice, especially the jicama.  Their homemade salsa trios are good, and the green (tomatillo, no red chile)  pozole is solid.\n\nI've probably been here a dozen times over the years, it's a solid, comfortable standby and an excellent non-touristy option for anyone going to the theaters across the street.

I mentioned it to the waiter who initially took our drink orders. I had given him my credit card, then we didn't see him again, another server took over and was not in a good mood at all.  We asked for water refills upon getting our food and she didn't respond, just made a face and walked away.  She looked like she was at the end of her rope.\n\nThe 7 of us got two trays of 3 salsas with great warm tortillas. We also ordered guacamole for the table and got a little bowl with 8 chips, served by food runners.  The guac was excellent, I got a taste with my fork, next time I'd ask for a big bowl of chips.  \n\nThe food tastes fresh.  We sat by the kitchen where you can see the tortillas being made and just about everything looked to be prepared as ordered and not pre-made then reheated. We were with a group ranging in age from 15 to 80 and everyone found something they liked on the menu.  The older folks had a hard time hearing and asked to have the music turned down.  We were there Sunday at noon and the tile floors, open kitchen and loud music make for a noisy meal.\n\nI had the Tinga which was fine - just chicken with light sauce in a tortilla.  The carnitas looked better.  Everyone got the black beans as a side dish but some of us got a teaspoon and some had a pint of them on the plate.  The plates came out really sloppy, beans dripping down the side and fingerprints in beans.  Not fancy Mexican food but a filling meal.\n\nThe check came my credit card wasn't in it.  I got up and tracked down our first server, got my credit card back and asked where he'd been.  He explained that it was the grouchy servers second day and he was training her.", "author": "Dena M."}

They live in Asia and crave Mexican food when they visit the States, so the challenge was finding a place that's tasty but on the nicer side in terms of ambiance. Unfortunately, that leaves only a few options, and if you're strict about it and rule out Spanish and Peruvian food, then your options are really limited. It came down to here and Mamacita for me, and although the food is okay at Mamacita I've just about had it with the Marina and its unsurpassed white douchiness. So, Colibri it was, even though I'd never been before.\n\nFortunately, it did not disappoint. The restaurant is on the fringe of Union Square, which made me a little afraid that it'd be touristy, but that wasn't the case. When we arrived, I immediately enacted my plan to prevent the parents from paying for our meal. I shook hands with our server -- I think his name was Anthony, that good man -- and slipped him my credit card with the understanding that they should just pay our bill automatically at the end of the meal. He was the epitome of professional and didn't show any expression beyond a smile and the briefest of nods.\n\nOur food was excellent. The guacamole is justifiably raved about, as were the pibil pork and the carnitas entree. We also had tasty cocktails -- mojitos, although I can't remember now what kind.\n\nThe decor is a little drab, and the tables are dark brown with the sort of matte finish that makes them look never quite as clean as they probably are.

Too many choices.\n2.  Service was very poor.  We were eating at the bar and had to ask repeatedly for more drinks.  I think the bartender may have been a little \"out of it\"\n3.

There are a bunch of taquerias, but coming from San Antonio, these are not what I really consider taquerias, not at .all. So I was surprised to find this place just a couple of blocks on Geary, across from Curran theatre. I've never noticed this place before even though I walk by here every day.\n\nSo anyways, we went of course! First impression, very nice decor, a little more upscale than what I expect from Mexican restaurants. But then again, this is a bistro so I dig it. The bar looked really well stocked, mostly with varieties of tequila. But it was Sunday morning.. a little too early for alcohol haha. They did have brunch and bottomless mimosas.. decided to pass that up.. maybe next time. As you sit, they bring out what tasted like home made corn tortillas served with 3 types of sauces.. nice touch. Ordered the quesadillas surtidas for appetizer.. nice gooey oaxaca cheese, mushrooms and peppers. I had the Desayuno Mexicano from the Eggs section, with chorizo, steak, potatos, rice and beans. Very good! Steak was so tender. My partner enjoyed the Mole Poblano. Just a note that servings are on the smaller side, but price is not the cheapest ($15 each dish). However, I accept the price/size ratio because of the quality of the food. Location is also downtown and probably on the tourist-y side, so I understand the prices. No problem though.. food justifies it like I said. Oh, and service was very good. We'll be back! Maybe next time to try one of their tequilas.", "author": "Vol T."}

Food was nicely plated, but super dainty and a little pricey. \n\nAte:\n* Guacamole $12 Made fresh just tell us how spicy you would like it; served with fresh handmade corn tortillas. Add chips $2. (4 of 5) It was really fresh and delicious. The corn tortillas were delicious. But rarely do people eat guacamole without chips. So it was $14 for fresh guacamole and chips! And too bad, the bowl was so shallow. Dipped the chip in for a scoop of guacamole and it broke off when it hit the shallow end of the bowl. And the chips for $2, not stale, but not great either. Found some chips where a stack of 8 chips were fried together. Not really satisfied with $12 guacamole or $2 chip bowl. I think I like Chevy's chips more. However, I think the $2 add on charge is for unlimited chips. I cannot confirm, but if I go back, I will double check.  \nMole Poblano $17 a legendary blend of spices, chiles, nuts and chocolate made into a rich and flavorful sauce,in the traditional Puebla style, served over chicken. (3 of 5). Tasty mole sauce, but only got three pieces of chicken nuggets. \nPato en Mole Verde Pipi\u00e1n $20 pan seared duck breast in a delicious green mole sauce made with pumpkin seeds, tomatillos, nuts and spices. (3 of 5) Duck was nice, but not juicy. And the flavor was mellow for a duck piece. I was really confused when I saw spaghetti on my plate. But it was spaghetti. I think this dish needs some re-design, no spaghetti please. \nChurro with Caramel Sauce Filling (2 of 5). I thought this was a great idea, but I don't think it was executed right. The churro was hard and the caramel sauce I expected to flow out or at least be soft, was nothing like that. Oh, I would like to try a creative new twist on Churro, but this was not it. \n\nNext time, I would try Chamorro de Cordero $20 (lamb shank marinated in a paste of Muscat wine and spices, wrapped in banana leaves and steamed to perfection). Someone else ordered the dish and that seemed the best bang of meat for the buck.\n\nThis restaurant left me somewhat unsatisfied. I was expecting a filling or tasty Mexican dinner. But all the dishes were just presented nicely, they did not fulfill my hunger.", "author": "Janice T."}

Their table side guacamole is always something to look forward to.  Unfortunately, this is only fun when they actually make it for you table side.  This did not happen.  It's okay, we still had the entire meal to look forward to.  We were armed with margaritas and ready to go.  As usual, the rest of the meal filled with carnitas, prawns, chicken, and fish was excellent.  We even ended it with dessert after!\n\nThe unfortunate turn of events came after we received our bill. $325 meal for five was not a high price to pay when you are sharing it with longtime friends whom you have not seen in over a year.\n\nThe server kept coming by every two minutes to ask if we needed anything else.  She cleared the table a little each time she came, first the plates, then our margarita glasses, next our napkins, and finally our water.  Okay lady, we get the hint!  It wasn't even 30 seconds after she cleared our water when the manager came by and asked if we needed anything else.  This prompted me to yell out, \"we get the hint and are leaving now!!\". Two hours and over $300 later, this is how Colibri treats us.

Maybe we visited on an off night?\n\nMy husband and I came here for dinner on a busy Friday evening.  I was sorry that we were only a party of two, because we were given a narrow table crammed into what must have been a walkway at one time.  There were a few other tables situated in this manner.  The servers had to shimmy up and down the aisle to get to all of us.  I think for this reason, we weren't visited very often.\n\nThe food was good, but for the price, the portions seemed pretty tiny.  However, the guacamole was tasty (and we seemed to get a lot of it), and the fresh tortillas were delicious.  I'm a sucker for those, and I probably could have eaten twenty of them.  For my entree, I ordered the carnitas, and was surprised that the only thing on my plate were a few small pieces of pork and one green onion.  No beans, no rice.  I suppose this was mentioned somewhere on the menu, but for $18, I guess I was expecting more.\n\nSince Colibri is just off Union Square, maybe we're paying tourist prices?", "author": "Raina S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-29", "description": "The food was good but the overall experience needs improvement.\n\nReservations:  we were going to be 6-7 on a Monday night. When we called 3 days in advance, we were told we could fit 6 people, 7 \"if we were friends\" in the booth that was available at 7PM.\n\nReality: we ended up being 6 in the booth and we barely fit. It was a *large* square table so awkward to talk, but the square configuration also made it very uncomfortable to sit. We are not large people and yet felt very crammed in.\n\nService: service was both slow and poorly paced.  We waited forever for drinks throughout the meal.  Main courses were served before appetizers were finished.  Plates were not cleared.  At the end of the meal, we ordered the 20-minute chocolate cake and some sangria to sip while waiting; the cake arrived 10 minutes later, the sangria, 15 minutes later. Unacceptable.\n\nBilling: the bill came with the expected service charge for a party of 6; this is fine, since it was less than we'd normally tip and so generous for the less than stellar service. It also came with the obnoxious \"Healthy SF\" service charge, which is simply the restaurant picking this one cost of doing business to highlight and charge separately to the customer. I find this insulting both to me as the customer and to the workers who deserve this benefit. To top it off, restaurants will often recoup large amounts of this fee at the end of the year if the services have not been used. Cheaper restaurants, and more enlightened restaurants such as Park Tavern, don't charge the fee. I won't return here until Colibri discontinues it.\n\nFood: The food was good and mostly fresh.  I really liked the small handmade tortillas served with salsas and along with the meal.  In each meal ordered by my group, one side was included.  We were concerned about portions based on Yelp reviews, so also ordered several additional sides.  This turned out to be largely unnecessary, however I thought the portions were generous enough for the cost.  It's not a cheap meal, but it's also not over-priced, given the atmosphere and location.  I loved the Tortilla Soup but be forewarned: it is very rich.  The scallops I ordered for dinner had a nice sauce but could have been fresher.  If I were to do it over I'd order a salad for appetizer and the soup for dinner.", "author": "Martha M."}

There were so many great variations of margaritas and drinks made with mescal. The only reason I am not giving the place a 5 star rating is because of the cost and being filled with tourists.

The restaurant was not really busy, however they have a back part of the restaurant that seats a decent number of people.  \n\nThe service here was superb.  The waiters were very nice and helpful.  It made the experience good.\n\nThe food itself however, wasn't the best or worth the price.  You'll see a lot of reviews about the 'tableside' preapred guacamole.  They don't advertise it that way, but dumb yelp reviewers here do.  First of all, it's not tableside.  It's done at a stand in the middle of the restaurant.  Second, the guacamole is already prepared before being brought out.  The stand is just to mix some ingredients such as tomatoes and onions into the mashed avocado.  Third, what really got me, was that it came in this massive mortar and pestle-type bowl.  I thought we were getting a massive amout of guacamole for the price.  However, they put a shallow dish on top of the opening such that it was actually a disappointing amount of guacomole.  I'd say 1.5 avocados at most.  And I'd put the taste at normal compared to other mexican establishments.  \n\nI make guacamole every two weeks, where a large avocado is $0.99 at a grocery store, so I know volume and pricing.  Was it worth $12 + $2 for chips?  No.  Not even the labor justifies it.  Also, shame on you yelp reviewers who don't know what good table-side guacamole is.  \n\nAlso ordered the Carnitas ($17) and a special of the day Pork steak ($17).  They were both good.  They also give tons of tortillas for free, which is great.  The carnitas dish is probably the best.  Pretty tasty, although a little dry.\n\nOverall, give 2 stars are for the great service plus 1 star for the carnitas.  Not enough to make me wanna come back.  Skip the appetizers.

And while Colibri has a lot of things going for it, spotty service and some other imperfections hold it back from a five-star experience.\n\nFirst, the many pros: The restaurant itself is warm and inviting, and the menu is great, with lots of delicious-sounding options. The guacamole and hand made mini-tortillas are excellent. I could eat just that as a meal; they were that good. The Torrejas Colibri (home made Mexican cinnamon pastry with fresh berries and agave honey syrup) was outstanding, although a touch undercooked in spots. The cinnamon-berry-honey combo worked perfectly. My girlfriend had the Mole poblano, which she really enjoyed.\n\nOn the down side, our two-person table was kind of small (it was crammed once all our food came), and it was very close to the table next to us. The servers had to squeeze through, bumping the table (or things on it) a few times. Our waiter was very friendly, but service was spotty.

They were an abominination. Flavorless, impossible to eat, wtih terrible dried-out chicken inside.  My kids felt slightly sick for hours after lunch because of this. I didn't realize how bad they were until after we had already paid the check....THEN my kids piped up, and I examined what was on their plates and tried to eat some of it. It was truly awful, and I told them that if this ever happens again, they have to tell us immediately that their food is bad so we can send it back.\n\nThe other entrees we ordered were only so-so in terms of flavor. Frankly I've had better at the likes of Chevy's, and certainly much better at the Mission area taquerias. \n\nI was surprised and disappointed and left wishing that I'd taken my guests to a better restaurant.\n\nThis is great place for drinks and appetizers.

Do yourself a favor and avoid the terrible flautas.\n\nI'm surprised to see so many 4 and 5 star reviews of this restaurant.

Instead, you'll be treated with dishes more from Southern parts of Mexico.  They give you tortillas instead of tortilla chips, which I actually like better.  Their salsas are good, but their table-side guacamole is fantastic.  They also have awesome top-shelf margaritas, with a nice variety of tequilas from which to choose.  Just make sure you realize that this restaurant is on the pricey side, otherwise you'll have a nasty shock when you get the bill.", "author": "Scott E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-23", "description": "So, it is possible that I smuggled three fresh, delicious corn tortillas out of Colibri's in my purse. Alright, fine, I confess - I TOTALLY put tortillas in my purse and continued to walk around downtown until I discovered them while looking for a pen while enjoying live jazz at Make Out and being absolutely thrilled at my foresight. Come to think of it, I stole that pen I was looking for at the time from Colibri's too.\n \nWhat can I say, they got some amazing stuff that I wanted to cram into my face and purse and take home and enjoy forever. I had the Reposado something or other (I drank that info right out of brain and they don't have their drink menu online) and it was a damn fine margarita. Thanks to Colibri's, I was reminded that I actually do like margaritas, it's just that it's so rare to get a good one that doesn't taste like some 13-year-old found his parents' liquor stash and mixed god knows what with some lime-aid.\n \nThe bartender was nice as could be and seemed to truly enjoy his job and educating rubes like me in the art of fine tequila. I ordered the guac (so I could try those tortillas I heard so much about!) and my friend ordered a quesadilla. \n\nOK, here's my one gripe about the place, which they handled well but kind of put a damper on the experience. The guac appeared...and sat there, and sat there, and sat there, right in front of us with no tortillas. The bartender said some would be up in \"just a minute.\" About 10 minutes later he came by and said \"sorry, I know this is torture, but we're training a new tortilla girl and it's taking longer than usual.\" OK. Finally 15 minutes they gave us chips instead and apologized again. Another five minutes later three come out in a napkin. 3?! My friend and I get 1.5 each? I wanted to ask if more were on their way, but the bartender was too busy. So the quesadilla arrived and we ate that. Then, a whole new set of six tortillas finally show up, hot and melt-in-your mouth awesome. But by that time I was full! \n\nI felt betrayed...\n \nSo, you see, I HAD to smuggle those tortillas out bc I refused to squander my chance to eat every morsel of their deliciousness I was entitled to, dammit! I hope you don't judge me too harshly.\n \nA shout out to Chris D, who helped me pinpoint this place's exact name and location, and for suggesting a dish. I would loved to have dined in full here, but we hit it up on our last night and by then I was counting my pennies.

Our happy hour/early dinner took off to the land of happiness with their tequila flight. After 3 shots of tequila, I was in my \"nothing can go wrong\" zone, feeling happy and ready to deal with whatever they served me good or bad.\n\nOnce we got settled in our happy place, we started dinner with some warm tortillas and Queso Fundido con Chorizo.....this dish put me on cloud nueve. The dish was small but packed a heavy punch. I kind of wanted to stop there but the tequila and glass of sangria in my system advised me to  get more food in my body.\n\nSo for dinner I had Chile Relleno with Carne. The beef was excellent but I took a bite of the pepper and it was very bitter because it had been incinerated instead of lightly charred. I don't know what crimes that chile committed in it's past life but it definitely paid for it in this one. \n\nStill as I said before the stuffing for the chile and sauce that came with it was delicious and the sweet yet savory Torta de Elote helped with the bitter taste in my mouth. \n\nAt the end of my journey I already knew that I would give this place a strong 4 star rating. Because of the chile pepper I had to take down one star. As usual the waiter asked, how was your meal? We responded it was excellent with the exception of the pepper being completely charred. He apologized and I said it's okay because I still ate the stuffing. A minute later the restaurant manager came over and stated she heard we had a problem with the pepper. At this point I felt bad and stated again it really wasn't a problem because I ate nearly all of the stuffing. She offered to take it off the bill and I disagreed BUT when our bill came to the table they didn't charge me for the dish stating they didn't feel right charging me for something I wasn't completely satisfied with. \n\nTear........sorry just give me a moment.\n\nOkay, now that I've regained my composure. I'm giving them 5 stars because this was definitely an exceptional experience from the tequila to the service and probably one of the happiest hours I've had in a while.", "author": "Troy R."}

The tortillas were fantastic and homemade. Yum! Also, the $5 margarita with our lunch was the bomb. Had a pork taco on a bean stuffed tortilla. It was amazing and I loved the portions. I ate carne asada with nopales (cactus) and onion. It was also very good.\n\nYou get tortillas with three salsa's. The green one was bright and fresh. The red one was good and earthy. The orange one was OK. I could taste the mango but it was really sweet. I wish I would have received more tortillas with my meal.\n\nI returned the next day with my husband, who's Mexican. We found out the evening before that John Santos was giving a free concert. We usually go to the mission district for food. But I wanted to show him Colibri. We went in (Oopsie - I think they may not have opened quite yet, and he went to the bar and ordered some Mezcal. He talked with the bartender in Spanish and then ordered one.

They started us with three cups of salsa: a very spicy green salsa and red salsa which was also spicy and a sweet mango salsa. With a side of flour tortillas. Apparently people there eat the salsa with flour tortillas instead of chips. For starters we had the empanadas which were different from was I was used to though still tasted good. They were fried well and served with red cabbage for extra crunch and a very good sauce. I had the duck dish which I found very delicious the duck was cooked perfectly and was cut for me. Next to the duck was a type of croquet topped with arugula which was also very delicious, fried perfectly on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside. The green sauce was okay I didn't taste much flavor from it.  I saw on the other tables bowls of guacamole but found it peculiar that it was served in a plastic bowl placed in a stone bowl. It seems that they do not make the guacamole in the stone bowl and you get less guacamole than it seems. Also the guacamole is not served with chips.

Anyways I walk in and the atmosphere is okay. If you like loud . I ate in the bar area, the obvious place for the single traveler as I was surrounded by other single travelers. Waited over five minutes for my server. I order the appetizer tamales ($10.00) which is theory sounded really yummy on the menu: corn dough tamales stuffed with Oaxaca cheese served with tomato sauce, queso fresco and white corn. Famished I also asked if I could get some chips and a Firestone ale. So chips and beer come and here is where I start to get excited. The salsa! OMG. So delicious. They had a salsa trio, trinity, what have you, and all of them were really good. The chips were delicious and the salsa were also served with yummy little homemade corn tortillas. I was starting to get excited about my tamales. They came and I bit into them, anticipating the delicious medley I was about to taste and I frowned. The red sauce tastes like Chef Boy R-D ravioli or Spaghetti-O sauce. No lie, this my instant connection in my mind. Although the tamale itself was good (but by no means fantastic), I was dismayed that after wiping off the ragu like sauce, only one of my tamales actually had cheese in it. Not happy. But did it matter if I was not happy? Nope! Because I never saw my server until she dropped the check off 30 minutes later. Good thing I had a book. Looking around I notice aggravation on one other of my single traveler faces as he looked for someone to flag down. We made significant eye contact, you know the kind that says, \"Hey we are in this together and this place sucks\". The kind of look usually reserved for airport lines. \n\nOh by the way, the tortillas are NOT free. I was charged $2.00 for them. Not once did my waitress mention this but then again she was not much for conversation over than \"Are you ready\".  $20.00 bucks for a meal and service I was not impressed with. Good thing this was on the company.\n\n2.5 stars for the salsa but I would not come back here.", "author": "Rebecca T."}

We added on the tortilla chips which were worth the couple of dollars just to have something crunchy. The guac was very good, it was fresh and cold and had just the right taste to it, in my opinion. (Note, I like cilantro.)\n\nFor dinner everyone was extremely pleased with their entrees! I had the mushroom-stuffed chicken breast, which came in a great garlicky cream sauce that I would have licked off the plate if I hadn't been in public. The side of veggies was tasty too.

The fresh-made tortillas they bring with it were pretty good though.\n\nWe tried a variety of things (mole, enchiladas, rice and beans, cactus, maybe a few others?), and while they were all solid, they were certainly not the best sit-down Mexican food I've had in SF (though I'm glad we had the cactus, because I really liked it, and haven't seen it anywhere else).  Also, value leaves something to be desired -- frankly, the food would have to have blown me out of the water to go back and pay those prices for the amount of food you get.\n\nWe did really enjoy the cocktails, though -- I can't remember off the top of my head which ones we ordered, but I think we tried somewhere in the neighborhood of 6-7 of their margaritas or other cocktails and liked just about all of them.  The prices for these were more in line with what you'd expect for high-end cocktails in the city ($9-12 each).\n\nBottom line -- I'd go back for drinks, or for food if someone else was paying, but I certainly wouldn't put *my* wallet on the line.

We came here this Wednesday evening around 8 and this place was packed. The wait time without reservations were 1hr long! Thank goodness I made it or else we wouldn't be eating there. The hostess was sweet and funny. \"I love reservations!\" So do I!!! We got seated right away. The table was for seating face to face but my BF and I love sitting next to each other so we did and shared literally half a table but the waiter was so nice to have offered to turn the table for us. Plus for that! \n\nWe first ordered our drinks and since we had a drink at Michael Mina before we came here I didn't want to have a strong alky drink. There was the longest margarita list ever! Every one of them sounded good but we went for the Margarita Con Fruta. You can choose the fresh fruit you want. I think there was kiwi, mango, pomegranate, strawberry... I ordered it with strawberry and he got the mango. The drinks were reasonably priced at $12. Probably my favorite margarita ever! The fresh strawberry/mango does a lot to a drink. Tasted really refreshing.\n\nEverything on the menu sounded pretty good. But since I was starving after I got off that afternoon, we went to The Cheesesteak Shop and had a large order of curly fries with cheese and a bite of the BF's sandwich so I wasn't super hungry... We started with the Guacamole. They make it right by your table, your choice of how spicy you want it, three different sauces, my fav was the mango pineapple, and also home made tortillas. Very, very goood guacamole. I can just sit in front of the t.v all day and night eating that. Fresh GREEN chunks of guacamole! MmMmMMm super good.  \n\nFor entree, I ordered the Pechuga Ranchera ($14) tender chicken breast smothered in a creamy guajillo chile sauce, over mashed potatoes with sauteed spinach and garlic. The best part was the spinach in the mashed potato.. The chicken was also good. Not dry at all, good flavor, and the sauce they put over it tasted perfect with the chicken but the spinach mashed potato was yummy. BF ordered the Filet Mignon ($18) filet Mignon with ancho chile stuffed with seasoned goat cheese, over mashed potatoes with sauteed spinach and chipotle chile sauce. This has got to be the SMALLEST filet mignon ever. I think he could of probably ate 10 pieces of that to be full. It was smaller then my fist! I didn't taste it so I don't know how/what it taste like and if it was good. You would have to wait for his review!\n\nDESSERT!! So even though I was super full, we decided to order dessert. We ordered the Mango Creme Brulee and the coffee tequila flan both $8. The Flan was just OK. But the creme brulee was pretty good. I love how the had a layer of fresh mango on the bottle. Custard was creamy ad not overly baked but I wish the burnt sugar on top was thicker since I love hearing the crackle noise when you dig into it.. But it was still good!\n\nTotal bill was around $90 but since they were on restaurant.com, I got to use my gift certificate!

They were quickly able to seat my party of 8 on a Sunday night without a reservation. The service was prompt/polite and the workers were extremely nice.\n\nThe ambience was nice. It has that rustic, mission type feeling. Adobe type walls, beautiful painting, big booths and large wooden chairs.\n\nTheir beers and mixed drinks were on par with any high end mexican restaurant.\n\nThe guacamole was amazing, but still a bit much at $12.\n\nI shared their chile relleno stuffed with carnitas and their special of the night, a stuff chicken dish topped with tomatillo sauce, which was quite tasty. No real complaints and a good time was had by all. We were the last group out and had to pay via multiple credit cards, due to billing purposes, but they were extremely gracious about it.

We were staying in the Union Square area, and stumbled on this restaurant quite by chance.\n\nWe got Guacamole and Pozole for appetizers.The soup was very flavorful and tasty. For once I didn't add any additional seasonings. Guacamole is made at your table, needless to say it was very fresh and tasty, with just the right amount of lime juice.\n\nFor the entree I got the Carnitas. It was VERY, VERY good. Hubby got the Filet minigon, he complained it was too small. I thought the portions were just right. The margaritas were good, I had to get 2. The corn tortillas are awesome, they are thicker than the store bought ones and very soft. They make it in the kitchen, the waiter told us.\n\nFor dessert we split the cajeta crepes. The cajeta itself was very, very good.\n\nI really enjoyed my dinner here. I am looking forward to my next visit to San Francisco so I can eat here again!", "author": "Rachel H."}

The tequila list is topnotch, and like so few places in the world, they make a great margarita.  If you only eat burritos and never check to see what kind of tequila you're being poured, then I can also warn you that you probably have no interest in this place.

The entire left side of the menu is a listing of different kinds of margaritas, all made the exact same way with fresh lime, but each using a different tequila. These are the best margies ever. If you're nice, the bartender will give you little tastes of the different margaritas made with different kinds of tequilas, and it really is amazing how the tequila affects the flavor. \n\nWhat's that?  You want to know about the food? God, you're annoying. \n\nJust do what I do, and order a few things off the appetizer menu, otherwise known as antojitos if you're a worldly motherfucker like me. \n\nI like the guacamole made super spicy in front of me and served with fresh hot tortillas.

I love that they make the Guacamole fresh right at your table...that was pretty fun to watch! I got the Queso Fundido to share and I got a Pozole as my entree. The Pozole was definitely mediocre and the Queso Fundido was an epic failure because the cheese congealed into lumps and you couldn't really dip your chips into it.\n\nBut the worst part was when our bill came and it was $100 for only 2 people--yes, we did have 4 drinks between the 2 of us, but the rest of our order only came from the Appetizer, Soup, & Salad menu. I wouldn't have cared paying that much if the Queso Fundido and Pozole were really good or impressive at least...\n\nI still gave them 3 Stars because the drinks were good, the freshly-made guacamole at your table, and for the good and friendly service.

Here's the run down:\r\n\r\nThe pechuga ranchera a la nata, described on the menu as \"tender chicken breast smothered in a creamy, well balanced guajillo chile sauce, side of sauteed spinach with shallot and garlic\" was tasty though I could have done with a better balance of flavors in the sauce.\r\n\r\nWe also chose the Chile relleno - \"fire-roasted poblano chile stuffed with vegetables and cheese, over a black bean sauce\". I wasn't crazy about this dish but I know that my favorite vegetarian would love it.\r\n\r\nThe Tostadas de tinga \"crisp golden hand made tortillas topped with stewed chicken, garnished with avocado and chipotle sour cream\" were a stand-out.

But I ate alone, and I really felt like I was an annoyance for the restaurant because of it. Service just wasn't up to par. \n\nThe table-side guacamole is excellent, though expensive. I understand you are paying for the experience of getting to watch it made, but it's not as though this is cherries jubilee or bananas foster. Getting to watch my guacamole made is really just giving me proof that it didn't arrive on a Sysco truck this morning in plastic tubs. It's not a spectacle. And it's not as though any of the ingredients are expensive or rare. I can't argue with the flavor, but the pricing isn't appropriate. The guacamole is served with pieces of soft tortilla rather than chips, which was actually better than I expected.\n\nWonderful selection of tequilas. And they are happy to make you a margarita from any of them. At the prices, they should be happy. But given the location, I have far less quibble with the tequila pricing than the guac pricing.\n\nCarnitas were flavorful, but too fatty. The side dishes were somewhat bland. I wound up making little tacos out of the mini-tortillas with the carnitas and guac.\n\nThe dessert, Crepas Con Cajete, was spectacular. I would almost come back just for the dessert. Rich caramel with velvety crepes. It was delightful. I wound up walking away with a smile on my face because of the dessert. \n\nI'll return, with plans of getting the guacamole again, the tequila again, and the crepes again.

What is probably more egregious is that a side order of rice is also $5 (beans are also $5), but somehow, in the same way that \"music wants to be free\", I feel like chips at a Mexican restaurant also want to be free.\n\nThe first time I went to Colibri was for lunch with a coworker. The food was good and authentic (I grew up in Mexico City, so I know), but a little pricey. Now we go to Los Socios for lunch instead.\n\nThe last time I went to Colibri was for a birthday dinner with a party of 10. For appetizers, we got 2 orders of $10 guacamole, 2 orders of $9 sopes, 2 orders of $8(!) quesadillas, and 1 order of $16 ceviche. So that's about $70-worth of appetizers. When we saw that the ceviche came with chips, we asked the waitress if we could also have a bowl of chips for the guac. She said \"well, chips are $5 per bowl\". \"Wow,\" we said, \"make sure you bring us a big bowl\". The bowl was the size of a small cereal bowl and had about 15 chips in it.\n\nThe food is good. I will give them that. But the value is nowhere near what you can get from a cheap taqueria that makes great authentic tacos with lots of flavor for $2.50 each.

The location is perfect for many of the theaters in the area and the service will get you to the show on time.  The food is delicious and much better than the normal Mexican places I've often had to go for a fix of Mexican food.  The home made tortillas are one of my favorite parts of the experience.   I've become an aficionado of margaritas on the rocks and their Cazadores margarita ranks among the best I've had.

This place was within walking distance from our hotel, so we decided to give it a try. We sat at one of small tables in the bar area. Someone forgot about us, because after I told the hostess that no one has been to our table, she apologized and took our order. I had the sopas which were very flavorful (except for the veggie one). The server, Maria, only visited our table ONE TIME to drop off our food. Who was responsible for taking care of our table? Hostess? Bartender? Server? I'm not sure, because no one checked on us to see that we were missing almost everything! Again we were neglected. We never got water as requested, never got the chips and salsa as promised, didn't have condiments, there wasn't salt or pepper at the table, utensils were not provided with our food, etc. We had to hunt for the things we needed ourselves. We literally had to flag the bartender or summons the hostess to provide salt, pepper, water and utensils to our table. We never did get the chips and salsa though. Anyway, we paid and gave our tip to the hostess and bartender, instead of to the server Maria. Good food, but beyond horrible service! Beware.", "author": "Michelle M."}

So tortilla strips, avocado, cheese and sour cream were all in the bowl, but it wasn't until that got to you before they pour the tomato soup on top of it.  So the tortilla strips is still kind of crispy, and everything else retained its taste while swimming in delicious tomato soup!  Seriously one of the best soups I've had.  And unlike most soups (in america), it is NOT over salted, instead it is tasty and o so good.  Highly recommend!\n\nMy only regret is not getting the guacamole.... i love guacamole..... doh!\n\nFood:\nCallos con Crust de Tortilla - delightful!  The squishy texture of scallops topped with crunchy corn tortilla bits was a great move.  Very good!\n\nDessert:\nFlan al cafe y tequila - it was good, but not spectacular or special like the rest of the dinner.\n\nChurros rellenos - stole some of that off my friend, now these were positively delightful!

(Insert mental, YES!) Then we went on to enjoy an awesome, hand to mouth, eat as much as you can, type of meal!\n\nThe atmosphere here is Spanish chic. The restaurant and bar is adorned with beautiful tequila bottles, dark wood, rod iron chandeliers and lanterns, and  just makes you feel at home. It is comfortable and very nice, but not too over the top fancy. Actually, it sets the tone quite nicely for the food and drink to come.\n\nNow, things I love:\n1. They bring you homemade corn tortillas hot from the oven, and three salsas to start you off vs. the standard chips and salsa. (although they will bring you chips upon request if you miss them) \n2. You HAVE to get, their fresh guacamole, I swear this could be the whole meal and I would be happy....but let's be honest, of course I eat more than this...\n3. Their margaritas are awesome and well priced, 11 - 13 seemed to be the price range for very good tequila selections, and although they are not large, they are well made with a good amount of tequila ;-). I enjoyed the pineapple, margaritini - which was served as a martini - if you didn't guess by the name - DELISH!\n4. THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC, and AUTHENTIC. We had their Carmita's and Queso Fundido appetizer which we topped with the homemade guacamole and salsas and were pretty much in heaven. The Carnitas were actually fried, as they should be, and moist and flavorful. Really good.\n5. Lastly, the churro dessert. It is large, (4 homemade churros) drizzled in caramel sauce, and with a scoop of ice cream. It is to die for. \n\nCheck this place out, it isn't too pricey,  and the qualify of the food and drink are worth it!\n\nI should also add the bartenders, although somewhat distracted with their friends at the bar, were very friendly, super knowledgeable, and gave us a free shot of mezcal to taste.

The guacamole was especially good, but for $12 plus an extra $2 for chips we would have hoped for more of it and limitless chips. Really, paying for chips at a Mexican restaurant?\n\nI guess that should have tipped us off that the portion sizes wouldn't exactly be generous.

They need some more dia de los muertos skulls and some candles for a snappier identity perhaps?\n\nThe salsa with fresh tortillas was delicious, but a head's up: they serve them in a cloth napkin so don't be fooled, they're in there! I thought it was just an extra napkin at first and dropped them all on the table. They should actually explain that, but maybe I'm just clumsy.\n\nWe had the duck and the lamb and I highly recommend both. The duck had an odd pairing with pasta but in the end it went well with the sides of green sauce (sorry, not sure what the sauce was but it was good). I only give Colibri 2 stars though because the hostess and our server could have been a bit more pleasant. In short, we thought it was pretty tacky that when it came time to use a gift certificate when paying our bill, our server said: \"oh, tip isn't included with that.\" Well duh! We always tip well. Super tacky to even mention that.", "author": "Kris P."}

All good but not spicy for people like me who live spice. Had the most interesting and more popular items on the menu. Chilli relleno with carnitas and chicaron. It was good but wished the chicaron was crunchy. Still pretty good though. We also got the ceviche with fish. It was so fresh and worth ordering. The chips just were how I like it, thick and crunchy.

The first few times I went I was very impressed with this Mexican restaurant because of the subtle twists to traditional Mexican flavors. I tried Huitlacoche(Mexican caviar) for the first time in my life and loved it, was stuffed in a chicken breast with a poblano sauce. I really don't care for chicken but those additions changes my opinion about boring chicken.  I also enjoy the mole verde with duck, a change from the usual chicken that accompanies mole. The duck fat really enhances the mole sauce. \nI have since been back, and all of this time prior to my last visit I highly recommended Colibri.  My opinion has drastically changed. The flavors are still there but what happened to the portion sizes?? Entr\u00e9e's now are the size of appetizers, entr\u00e9e sizes in the past weren't huge but adequate.

We had just gone to see In the Heights and it was still open for food after the show, so we ended up here.  Such a great call.  I had a delicious meal!\n\nThe restaurant looks small from the outside, but it's actually pretty spacious.  There is a cool looking bar with tons of varieties of tequilla in the front and then there is seating next to the bar as well as in the back.  The decor was cool and the servers were nice.  I would have liked to come to eat earlier in the evening to see if there is a difference in the crowd/atmosphere.  However, the group I was with needed no other tables but our own to have a great time.\n\nWe started off with a variety of apps, we tried both the fish and prawn ceviche.  One word: DELICIOUS.  I had not had prawn ceviche before, but it was so tasty.  The citrus flavor was awesome and the texture was great.  I would totally have that again.  We also got the queso with chorizo.  Also tasty, but very rich, so if you are not super hungry you might want to skip as an app, because it's pretty filling.  We also had the quacamole--it was good, but didnt really stand out compared to the other dishes we had.\n\nFor my main dish I had the relleno, which wasn't bad, but I was pretty full already from the appetizers.  Although I was ful, I still managed to squeeze in dessert--churros with dulce de leche and ice cream.  Umm what?  Yep, it was as good as it sounds.\n\nIt's a great option if you are going to the theater at the Curran--it's literally across the street.  We closed the place down the night we went, and I would happily do it again.", "author": "Lu E."}

He made some great reccos for my friends who opted for the Tequila flights. He even let us work some substitutions. He really is in tune with his customers. I stuck with a house margarita which was quite tasty. One thing I also loved about him was that he was FAST! So refreshing after patronizing a slew of trendy spots with fancy drinks (see Alembic). I brought up yelp somehow in conversation and he mentioned how how had just checked the site and gotten a good review. He seemed really excited about that! So here ya go, dude, another one! You rocked it.\n\nNaturally I made the suggestion that we should try those jalapeno margarita's mentioned that he made special. He was happy to oblige and we joined him at the bar for the show. Setting drinks on fire sure is cool, but the general concensus was that the drink was more gimmicky than drinkable. I appreciated the effort tho.\n\nAfter this we took our seats. I sat on the wrong side of the table (the side that got the plates last, damn!) so I only had a tiny bit of food, but it meant I was able to try everything! The Queso Fundido was amazing, as was the Filet Mignon. Second runners up were the Mole and the Cauliflower. People were pushing the corn bread, but it was too dry for me and way too covered in the sauce. \n\nFor dessert we seriously tried them all but everyone raved about the Churros being the best they'd ever had.", "author": "Nikki M."}

There were servers and bartenders everywhere doing nothing; only one girl was serving all 8 tables.  The Bloody Mary was the worst one I've ever had.  It tasted like rotten tomato water and was poured from a disgusting tub behind the bar.  12 chips and an inch of guacamole cost $14.  And both were not so great.  Lunches are $12-$15 with no sides.  I had to order rice in addition to my entree.  I got the cheese enchiladas.  Horrific is the best term.  It was a corn tortilla wrapped around cold cheese put on a plate and covered with cold sauce and cold cheese.  The meal was cold and the cheese wasn't melted.  Plus the green sauce was okay, but the red was terrible.  I could only eat the half with green sauce.

She strongly recommended the tortilla soup, which was excellent, although the portion was a bit large. I also had the guacamole, prepared tableside in a big stone mortar thingy. It was cool to watch the guy scoop out the flesh from the avocados and mash it up with everything else. I also had the chicken mole and the lamb shank. I love mole and always try to order it because it is so hard to get in Hawaii and I hate making it. Their mole was pretty good. The server was nice and got me extra sauce for the rice because she knew how much I liked it. The lamb shank was huge, but not super tasty. \n\nI also loved the sangria.

The side of black beans came in a large bowl and was a little liquidy, but nicely spiced.  My dinner mate had an entree of chicken with mole - the mole was smoky and good.

It is right in the theatre district so you can certainly go there when you're downtown for a show. The place has a great atmosphere and the old latin movies shown above the bar are an interesting visual addition if you sit at the bar or near the bar area.\n\nYou should definitely reserve a table as it is quite busy and the food is testament as to why there is SRO to get in. We were there for an anniversary dinner.   \n\nIf you like appetizers of chips and guac, then I definitely recommend it. I thought it was great that we were asked if we wanted our handmade (tableside) guacamole spicy - it is nice to know that they don't think everyone wants bland guacamole. The margaritas - good enough to just have one if you're a light drinker (it isn't all sweet/sour mix!).\n\nFor the main course I had Callos con Crust de Tortilla - which is perfectly cooked large scallops, served over purple fingerling mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed poblano pepper, cactus leaves,corn and portobello mushroom. Loved it! If I hadn't filled up on chips and guacamole, I might have been disappointed that ther were only 3 large scallops. So keep that in mind if you have a large or small appetite.\n\nMy husband had the Camarones en Mole de Tamarindo - saut\u00e9ed prawns in tamarind mole served with a corn cake.

The ambiance was nice, but nothing too special; the bottles of tequila in the window are a nice touch. Speaking of tequila, they have an incredible selection of authentic Mexican tequilas. The margaritas were strong and tasty, but a little overpriced. If I were to do it again, I would get shots with salt and lime rather than a margarita.\n\nOn to the food. We started with the guacamole, which they prepare at your table to the level of spice you ask for. It was delicious and fresh with perfect texture. They give you hot, fresh tortillas rather than chips, in addition to 3 homemade salsas that are excellent. I could have a whole meal of mini tortilla-salsa-guacamole sandwiches and be completely satisfied.\n\nThe tortilla soup was very good. They bring a bowl of avocado, cheese and tortilla strips and pour the soup over it on the table. Much better texture and taste than your average tortilla soup. I ordered the Mole Poblano and was mildly impressed. The sauce was interesting; it was a bit too chocolaty for my taste, but the texture and complexity were good. The chicken it was served with ranged from satisfactory to very tender; the tenderness of the  meat on the drumstick redeemed the dish for me. My date ordered the Chile Relleno, and I was blown away. The cheese and other fillings were delicious, and it was perfectly spicy; one of the best Mexican dishes I've ever had. The bill came to $100 with tip, but it was worth it for me; I'd never had gourmet Mexican food before, and the drinks and ambiance made for a very good dining experience (and some of the best guacamole I've ever had).", "author": "Geoff L."}

I give the 2 stars strictly for the fresh guacamole and the nice man that served us. Though the guac was delish, you had to pay $3 to get chips. I'm not saying that $3 breaks the bank, but its the principle. Seriously, even my hole in the wall dumpy mexican restaurant gives me free fresh chips. None of the food we had was good between the appetizer quesadillas, tamales, tortilla soup, and sangria. Judging by the other reviews, we should have tried some of the main entrees, but from what I did have, it tasted like bad americanized mexican food.

So, you had better have serious game if you want to position yourself as high end Mexican.  And, unfortunately, Colibri does not deliver.  Why?  The dining space is cut into a forward cramped section and a back desolate section.  The forward section schizophrenically cannot decide whether it should be a bar or a dining space.  After returning a syrupy mojito, we received a prawn ceciche that was passable, but fundamentally lacked the freshness and acid that great ceviche requires.  Also odd was that rather than using whole prawns, they chopped them up.  Not sure why. My carnitas was a bit overcooked and lacked the juice and flavor I could get a few miles away for a fraction of the price.\n\nBut the worst thing about Colibri was the sound system.  Apparently, they could not get radio reception so the music would degenerate into a loud buzz randomly.  Strangely, the initial response was to turn up the volume.

They first served us some pretty delicious corn tortillas and a trio of salsas, which we quickly devoured because we were both kinda starving.  We ordered the carne asana empanadas as an appetizer (I think it was one of the specials that day) and it was served over this sauce that I think was avocado-based. They were really good, tender beef and a substantial pastry that wasn't too heavy or too thin.  I forgot what dish my friend ordered because I was or pretty enamoured with the mole poblano that I ordered.  When I've ordered a mole with chicken at other restaurants, it was typically served with breast meat and usually is kind of dry.  Here, it is served with some rather juicy bone-in chicken and was preeeeeetty satisfying with a side order of their rice.\n\nI wanted to get dessert, but we were running out of time before our show started (War Horse, so good!!!!) so the server got us our check right in the nick of time for us to be able to head across the street, instagram a bunch of pictures, and have time to settle into our seats at the theater.\n\nWhile not super engaging, the service here was very nice and efficient and the food and drinks were pretty awesome.  Definitely recommend this place whether or not you are going to see a play or musical across the street!", "author": "Jerome R."}

The meat dishes were about $18 (Filet Mignon and Lamb shank). The veggie dishes were a little cheaper. There's a appetizer menu and then there's the salads, entrees and sides. Pretty standard. The margaritas were about $10 and up. There are a lot of tequillas available, but we did not choose any of them. A little pricey. So not sure what the dishes are supposed to be like, but the menu says tapas, but the entrees that come out in varying sizes. \n\nAnyway, the restaurant was busy and we had reservations, so we had a table for 10 ready for us.

The drinks were VERY STRONG. \n I got the Pink Bull Rush, which was tasty but a bit too sweet for my liking, and VERY strong. The sangria was quite tasty (i think I'll go with that if I go there again). The margaritas and caipirinha were also very strong.\n\nAPPS:\n- Guacamole: delicious, made at the table but definitely NOT ENOUGH for the amt paid\n- Queso with mushrooms (left out the chorizos bc we had a vegetarian at the table): Pretty legit, however it was hard to eat because the cheese was melted a lot\n**I found it odd that they only gave tortillas, and when we asked for chips for dipping, they charged us per bowl of chips so BEWARE!\n\nDinner:\n- Callos con Crust de Tortilla: Scallops - pretty legit, nothing spectacular but they were pretty good and the perfect amount. There were three scallops, perfectly cooked and seared that came on top of green beans, a small dollop of mashed potatoes mixed with corn and other items.\n\nDessert: BEST PART OF THE ENTIRE DINNER\n- Pudin de chocolate: Bowl of dense chocolate pudding (kind of like a pot de creme) that was amazing and I wanted a full bowl of it for myself\n- Churros Rellenos: A friend of mine said I had to try this, and she was completely right. I didn't try the ice cream, but this was AMAZING, the churros were crispy and perfectly crusted with cinnamon sugar and caramel filling.\nWe devoured both of these dishes. Some others got the creme brulee and the crepe but I didn't try them because our desserts were so delicious.\n\nOverall, service was great, and the lady was more than happy to split our checks between 7 cards and cash. Everything was fine, except that I didn't think the meal was worth $46 per person even after getting $25 off for a restaurant.com coupon.\n\nI would potentially go back but just for drinks/dessert, I don't know if the food is worth the amount they charge.

But that wait is worth it!  These flour tortillas are so soft and have somewhat of a corn texture to satisfy even those who hate flour tortillas.\n\nWe dined on the tortilla soup, cactus leaves side, and sopes trio.\nThe soup is poured fresh from the pot right at your table so your tortillas stay crunchy and your queso fresco stays, well, fresco.  It's a cream soup, rather than a broth and is the perfect price for those on a budget.\n\nThe cactus leaves side with portabello mushroom is tasty and well-seasoned (if not a bit heavy on the rosemary)\n\nThe sopes trio is a great sampler of carne asada, seasoned chicken, and vegetable (from their rellano)\n\nAnd try their hibiscus agua fresca, yum!\nI'll never lose track of Colibri again!", "author": "Karen L."}

It was a busy Saturday night and we had reservations but actually got seated early which was nice. \nStarted with the Queso Fondito - two kinds of cheese melted over chorizo and mushrooms, Excellent, very very rich though, it comes with fresh hand made corn tortillas that you can just eat by themselves because they are that good. \nNext it was the Camerones en Mole, unbelievable dish! Six big perfectly cooked prawns in the most complex tamarind mole sauce I've ever tasted. First bite layers of different flavors danced around, it's served with a sweet/savory corn muffin that is so delicate it falls apart and melts in you mouth immediately. Only complaint was this plate was lukewarm but it was so good I just ate it anyway. \nThen we had the Carnitas, tender chunks of pork served with a spicy sauce. I actually didn't use the sauce that came with it and put some of the mole from the prawns on it instead. Delicious \nSide dish was the Papas Au Gratin, thin slices of creamy potatoes layered with a very light chili cream sauce and then topped with the same gooey cheese as the Fondito. Could have used a touch of salt but otherwise very good. \nThe food was excellent my only complaints would be that our waitress was scarce and I had a tough time flagging her down and the PRICES!

I'm usually not one to whine about paying for good food, but WAAA.  The portions are ridiculously small (like tapas size), the average plate at our table of five was around $25, and to tell the truth, the food was not particularly interesting in any way, and his wasn't due to lack of courage on my party to try more exotic sounding items.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that when I pay $25 for three or four bites of food, I expect something more than stylish decor and an extensive wine list.  Colibri's food was not memorable, to put it kindly.  There wasn't anything wrong with the food per se, but I wouldn't call it delicious.  You know what I mean?\n\nI really felt gypped after I finished dinner.  I almost went down the street to Katana-Ya to have dinner since I basically just had an outrageously expensive appetizer at Colibri.

Their food, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. On my last dining trip, our guacamole was peppered with unique spices and great consistency. But why do we have to pay $2 for tortilla chips deep fried so badly that they taste like corn nuts? Shouldn't the chips accompany the guacamole? I know they bring out tortillas, but with only three per two guests, and a huge bowl of guacamole, it felt like bad math. Nevertheless, the appetizer was pretty impressive. \n\nFor the main course I ordered the carnitas dish, which, to the apprehensive prodding of my fork, was mostly fatty globs of meat. I would have an easier time sliding my fork into a gummi bear than I would some of these pieces of pork. \n\nBeing that I'm from San Diego, and have had many better Mexican dishes, I feel a little underwhelmed by the jell-o pork and the cold rice that could double for rock salt.

We got the hottest type and I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nThe tortillas were also to die for. I still can't believe they're corn tortillas. They tasted flour-y to me (which is good). What kind of corn tortillas have I been having all my life? Apparently terrible ones. \n\nThe dish I got was the carnitas. Very delicious and tender. The sauce was hot and addicting. \n\nI also tasted the scallops. They seemed cooked well (as in good) but not as good as I would have liked. The sauce was delicious though.\n\nNote that I haven't been in SF for a while and have been exposed to LA's terrible food. Still, food that addictive must be good. \n\nTheir sangria was tasty but a little light-handed.\n\nThe only con would have to be it's prices. The menu said in small print \"Tapas\" which surprised me... expensive tapas, that's for sure!

We had a preset menu (due to the size of our group) with a few choices for each of the three courses.  First we ate tortillas with salsa.  Oddly, this was our \"appetizer.\"  The tortillas themselves were not horrible, but I thought that it was really strange that they didn't offer us anything else to eat with them other than salsa.  \n\nThe next course was a choice of chicken or pork with rice.  I was provided a ridiculously dry piece of pork and a side of rice.  No sauces, no nothin'. That's it.  \n\nLast course was dessert with a choice of flan or churros.  Take the churros, because the flan was rejected by everyone at the table.\n\nTortilla + dry piece of meat + donut = horrible meal\nAnd mind you, we paid $45 per person + 18% tip just for food. It goes without saying that I was extremely disappointed.\n\nAgain, perhaps my experience was atypical due to our prefix options, but overall I was NOT impressed.  Go to the Mission to get some real Mexican food and you'll still have some change left over for a cab ride home. \n\nIn short, I would not recommend hosting your birthday party or large group celebration, for you might lose a few friends.", "author": "Lauren T."}

I got a $30 gift certificate for $15 --SCORE!  The only downside about coming to this place is that it's in Union Square... so parking is VERY difficult!  We luckily made our reservations within the 15min-past-your-reservation time frame.  It was pretty packed when we came in, but luckily, our table was waiting for us.  \n\nWe sat down, looked through our menus, and 10 min later our waitress appeared.  She took our order, but then instead of placing our order in, she went to ask 3 other tables what they wanted to order... NOT COOL.  Luckily, they didn't take too long ordering either.  \n\nWhat got me a little annoyed about the service here was that the table next to us got served the tortillas and salsas before we did, even though they got seated 10 minutes after us.  I saw the waiter bring out 2 more batches of tortillas and salsas, but they all went to other tables who sat down after us.  SERIOUSLY??!  how unfair... I had to ask twice for the tortillas.  We eventually got the tortillas and salsa AFTER our appetizer came out.\n\nThe appetizer - tostadas with chicken were delicious!  The tostadas came out on 3 small fried tortillas with a mayonaise-like sauce and avocado on top of the chicken.  The chicken had lots of flavor and the creamy sauce went well with it.  I wish it came with more than 3 though!  I got the chile rellenos, which was recommended by our waitress.  I hate to be a complainer, but it did not live up to it's expectations.  There was barely enough cheese in it.. and that's usually the best part! It had lots of vegetables inside... but kind of lacked flavor.  It was just okay... My friend got the duck with green mole.  He LOVED it.  The duck was pretty tasty and went really well with the mole.  It was cooked nicely, but was almost on the side of overcooked.  All it came with was the duck, so he had to order some rice to go with it.  I wasn't a big fan of their rice... \n\nFor tapas-style dishes, it's pretty pricey.  Chile rellenos was $12, duck was $18, the tostadas was $9, and rice $5.  When the bill came, our total came out to $15.75 (after the groupon was used).  Not too bad!  The food was pretty good, but the service was a little slow.  I probably would get other dishes if I ever came back here.

I don't like chile relleno but it looked beautiful and the other two were delicious and well presented.  A clear preference for presentation and quality over quantity but not to the point that you would be starving.  Their menu is online and at $15-20 for most entrees, an evening won't eviscerate your wallet if you stick to one tequila (see below).\n\nService:\nWe sat at the bar and had a bartender that had an excellent hat and cheerfully answered questions about the tequilas and the food.  We asked him about the peppers he had standing by and he took the time to make a sample margarita with mashed jalapenos and talked about how the pepper brings out the sweetness in a new way.\n\nTequilas:\nTommy's is historically the place everyone would go to and I haven't been there but I thought Colibri was plenty good in selection and quality.  There are more than you can count--perhaps 120--and they are helpfully organized by the ordinal scale you're used to based on time in the oak barrel but they also divide them by the degree to which the barrels were charred.  I had one anjeo that was practically clear and another that was closer to amber-brown.  Both were great.  Perhaps the only thing one could complain about is that although most are in the $10-15 range--already pricey--the menu includes a few shots in the show-off $60 region and one at $120.  But if some guy wants to waste his money that's fine with me.\n\nLocation:\nIn a part of the tenderloin that was rough 10 years ago but is fine to walk to from BART, particularly if you walk up Powell to Geary.  I can't speak to parking but it seems like there are pay garages within a block.\n\nAtmosphere:\nTypical dark tones with big menagerie of bottles at the bar.  Big points for not having sports on.  The bartender actually said that they don't have cable--the night we were there he was playing black and white Lucha Libre movies.  (I wish yelp had a TV/no TV designation since TV makes it harder to concentrate on whom you are with.)\n\nOverall: If you want to go to a place that favors quality over quantity without being too fussy this is an excellent choice.", "author": "Chris M."}

The servers at Colibri are exceptionally friendly, which added to the vacation feeling we had dining there on an exceptionally hot evening in downtown SF. Knowing we'd need several, we chose the slightly-less-than top drawer margaritas this time. They were tasty. \n\nFor some reason I turned my nose up at the notion of guac. Rather, we had:\n\n* Tostadas de Tinga\ncrisp golden hand made tortillas topped with stewed chicken, garnished with avocado and chipotle sour cream. This was super tasty but could have been spicier. I couldn't really taste the chipotles. I can understand them spicing it mildly in this neighborhood though.\n\n* Frijoles Negros\nblack beans with epazote herb and chunks of way yummy soft white cheese. Good honest beans. Nice seasonings and the cheese was firm and fresh.\n\n* Papas al Gratin\npotatoes au gratin with poblano chile cream. Thinly sliced taters in a terrine with lots of cheese on top, these are the ultimate food for the soul. Not greasy, but what a wow with the green garlic sauce from the Pescado on them. You basically don't need anything else.\n\n* Estofado\nzucchini, corn kernels, mushrooms, onions and pasilla chile stew. Good roughage but the big dried red chilis are kind of a shock - these really shouldn't be swallowed but since they are tucked into the chop-mash they can be missed.\n\n* Pescado del D\u00eda\nPan seared catch of the day served over a green garlic sauce with chorizo, saut\u00e9ed green beans and chayote squash, topped with huitlacoche\n\nOn the Pescado (Opa), we had told the waiter my friend didn't eat red meat so the chorizo was substituted with some yummy chili oil drizzle. The green garlic sauce also had a hefty dash of cream. This sauce was among the best sauces I've ever tasted in my life. We sopped it up with nopales,  scraped it with our forks, dragged soft tortillas through it, spooned it on top of the Papas al Gratin and then our eyes pretty much rolled back in our heads. I have not had a dish this exceptional in a very long time.\n\nThe service was excellent - this is a fun place.

We're off to a good start\n  Tostada de Tinga... very tasty, but started out thinking small. Three silver dollar sized crispy tortillas covered with seasoned pulled chicken. 11.00 .  4 stars \n  Chicken Mole was 2 little chunks of chicken breast (maybe a total of 2-3 ounces) and a very small un-meaty leg, with a 2\" ball of rice, mole sauce over the chicken, LARGE cilantro leaf ...18.00. They're getting a lot of miles out of one chicken breast or was that a Cornish game hen?  Save some of the salsas previously delivered with the tortillas to complement the so-so mole.  That was a nice touch. There was a lot of room on the small plate, especially after my first bite.  2.5 stars\n  My wife ordered the pork stuffed Chili Relleno covered with a  black bean sauce, very tasty. ..18.00.  3 stars  That was all that was on her plate. Come on now...I'm beginning to see a trend here.\n  There are inventive dishes on the menu and seemingly great ideas but we were looking for some more on the plate, especially for the price.  \n  Churros Rellenos...  Four 4\" long churros with a small scoop of tasty caramel/vanilla ice cream.  Caramel sauce drizzled over the dish. Lots of sweetness here and a nice combination.  This portion was about average. 3 stars\n  This is not your normal kitchen chair Mexican restaurant.  Moderate d\u00e9cor, fit for a night out.  The flavors are very good.  But don't be surprised about the portions/cost ratio.  And watch out for the 13.00 spicy margarita, great flavor 3.5 stars, but 13.00??. \n  Colibri  can refer to a type of hummingbird.

In general i love mexican food (not the abominations known as mission burritos, but \"real\" mexican food).  In general their food was good, not great, but I left stuffed and fairly satisfied.  \n\nFirst, their house margarita was great, a good balance of tequila and lime flavours, on the rocks (blended margarita = abomination).  The gaucamole was good, super spicy like we ordered it and the warm, fresh tortillas was very very good.  I also loved the elote corn bread  and the nopalitos and the sopes.  But everything else we ordered was good but not great, well prepared, cooked and presented, but i wasn't dying for more when I bit into the lamb shank, the mole, or the carnitas.  The Scallops were good, but i didn't enjoy my michelada, I thought it was supposed to have some hot sauce  or Maggi in it?  Maybe I'm wrong, but that's they way i like it.  Apparently, some at our table had some sub-par Mojitos, but i didn't try them.\n\nAnyway, Colibri is pretty good for some Mexican and our service was very nice, but not sure if i would go out of my way to get back there.", "author": "Adrian L."}

The mole was ok but to me less special. \n\nThe thing I didn't like is that they turned all the lights on at the end of the dinner because the restaurant was closing.

With so many raving reviews, we decided to stop here to celebrate my wife's birthday.\n\nThe service was horrible and the food was full of flavor.  We arrived at 5 on a Sunday, and quickly noticed that there were more staff than there were customers.  We were pretty excited, thinking that there was no rush and that we could have a lovely meal together.\n\nWe started off with a pitcher of sangria and the tableside guac + chips.  The waiter brought out two glasses for our drinks, set them on the table with the pitcher, and walked away.  Really?  It's not like you're too busy to pour the drinks for us.  They'll even pour drinks for you at Chevy's.  :/  Then two people came to ask us how we wanted our guacamole.  Both times we said spicy, and it came out pre-made and had no heat at all.  I was not impressed, especially for the price.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the pechuga ranchera, and my wife had the filet mignon.  My food was flavorful and delicious, but my wife's was only partially good.   She ordered her filet medium, and it came out red - almost purple.  Our waiter was nowhere to be found, so we were unable to let him know that there was a problem.  He finally came back with dessert menus, and I ordered the pudin de chocolate.  Before my wife could order her coffee, the waiter grabbed the menus and walked away.  Oooookay, looks like we'll find a cafe nearby.  The dessert was very light yet filling and I really enjoyed the touch of sea salt.\n\nOverall, the service was terrible and it seemed almost like a burden that we were there.  I'm giving two stars instead of one because the food was pretty good when it was prepared correctly, and I'm sure the waiter was having an off day.

We ordered ours spicy and although they could have added a little more heat, nothing beats fresh guacamole...let me restate: nothing beats impeccably made, delicious tasting, fresh guacamole.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a whim after researching good Mexican food in Union Square. The restaurant was small and they were willing to reseat us when we didn't like the original table. First thing we ordered were drinks and they were strong. I first ordered a mojito and he got a margarita. We didn't drink much, but my favorite drink was the Tequilito - it was a mojito-esque margarita with crushed mint leaves and tequila along with pomegranate flavoring. The 1.5 drinks I drank had me feeling good.\n\nIf you're into tequila, they have an entire bar wall of just tequilas -- all sorts, from all over the world.\n\nFor our entrees, I had stuffed chicken and he got the filet. The side dishes come a la carte, so we shared arroz, Mexican rice. \n\nAfter reading some reviews, people complained about the portions of the food, but I couldn't even finish my plate. Granted we had a few appetizers, but it was enough to fill me up.\n\nThe food was beautiful - everything about it. The way it was presented to the way it tasted, I wanted so bad to finish my dinner, but I also didn't want to pop.\n\nThe only downfall was the arroz was advertised as Mexican rice with vegetables -- it might as well have been out of a box. But, nevertheless, it tasted delicious.\n\nNow, don't go here if you don't want to spend a good amount of money on dinner. Colibri is not cheap.

You get some nice tortillas with them.  (Chips would have been better.)  I ordered the Pozole Verde expecting soup as described.  It was anything but a soup and I was worried when it looked like a bowl of Kix. It was overloaded with hominy.  There was no soup and the fresh ingredients got lost in carb abyss.  The halibut wasn't any better.  It was sitting in a cheesy red oily sauce (supposedly chorizo sauce) on top of overcooked string beans.  The halibut had a sour taste to it and lacked much other flavor.  I don't remember what my friend ordered but it was at least mediocre.  She did like her tortilla soup though.  I wish I ordered that.\n\nThe only thing I was satisfied with is the guacamole dip, great service and margaritas.  This place is better for getting boozed up.

There were three of us, two sitting side by side and one across.  No chance of full table conversation.\n\nThe service was inattentive and when a waiter finally DID show up, pushy --\"you aren't ready to order yet?\"  Twice we had to go FIND a waiter when it was time to either clear the table or get a check.\n\nAs for the food:  The warm tortillas served with salsa --excellent.  Table side guac was nice.  However the salad was swimming in dressing --we left half of it.  The carnitas was dry and lacking in crusty outter that really MAKES good carnitas.\n\nA pretty disappointing evening all around --and we drove in from east bay for that!

Hubby was none to excited to accompany me so I thought some good food and drink might make a cheesy musical go down a little easier.  We found Colibri on Yelp and decided to give it a shot.  What a great choice!\n\nWe wanted to make it quick so we asked to sit at the bar and found seats quickly at around 6:15p.  We ordered a Dos XX Amber from tap and the featured monthly margarita with a tequila I don't remember.  The margaritas are a little pricy, but really strong. What impressed me the most was all the fresh ingredients the bartenders used.  I can't remember the last time I sat at a bar and watched a bartender squeeze every last drop from a grapefruit for a Grey Goose and grapefruit cocktail.  You won't find prepackaged juices here.  We also happened to stumble in on a tequila representative looking to sell his new company's new tequila to the team of bartenders.  They were doing a tasting and quickly offered the groups at the bar a shot of each of the three tequilas.  \n\nWe ordered off the the full menu: ceviche, sopes, and carnitas.  I liked that the menu starred items that were quick prep tapas, it was great for us who needed to get to a show.  The ceviche was the highlight of the meal.  Tender white fish, cured to perfection served with tortilla chips.  The sopes offered great flavor and variety.  The reconstructed carnitas, served sliced instead of shredded with salsa on the side, was moist and tender while still offering a little bit of crispiness around the edges.  It was  perfect with the homemade tortillas and trio of salsas.  \n\nIf in the Union Square, I would definitely consider Colibri again.", "author": "Kelly I."}

I was sleeping in late that day and had literally been dreaming of super tasty Mexican food. I was just about to take a luscious bite of a dream-quality jumbo shrimp taco and wash it down with a frosty margarita when the BF woke me up rather abruptly. Yeah. So in a groggy, semi-grumpy, definitely hungry state we headed to Colibri.\n\nAtmosphere - Woody, warm, masculine, rustic wrought iron chandeliers with golden light, huge mirrored back bar, some padded booths. Overall an inviting, welcoming space off of the Hotel Diva. \n\nService - Very friendly, efficient and responsive. \n\nFood - Colibri's menu is a bit like Mexico meets Carmel. I personally prefer my Mexican food straightforward without the diamond studs, but that's just me. Excellent guacamole served in a huge iron pot that first gives the impression it would serve 5 or 6 people. That's until you swipe a chip in it and realize it is 1/4 of an inch deep. Ah - the magic of illusionist serving dishes. No problem though, plenty for two. However, I must backtrack. I mentioned swiping a chip in the guacamole. Yes. Well, the guacamole is $10. If you want chips, they will cost you an additional $5. \n\nI just saw a star fall from the sky. \n\nYes, tortillas come with the guacamole and they are lovely. That is terrific. But I like chips with guacamole. Chips are made out of tortillas. The tortillas are free and the chips cost $5. This is silly.\n\nMoving on. BF had the Carnitas. The chunks of pork were juicy and flavorful. I had the Tostadas de Tinga - tiny tortillas topped with stewed chicken, garnished with avocado and chipotle sour cream. Delicious. The side salsas and mole were also very good. \n\nDrinks - Colibiri offers an extensive specialty margarita list as well as tequila flights. We went for the house margaritas which were refreshing and good, but not outstanding. \n\nOverall, Colibiri would have easily gotten 4 stars from me were it not for the silly $5 basket of chips. It's a detail I realize, but it shows a certain lack of judgment. The prices here are on the upper end of the scale for Mexican food. Chips are dirt cheap. Especially wholesale. Most customers will probably be completely happy with tortillas. But if someone happens to want some chips with their $10 serving of guacamole...do the math Colibiri. Slip em some free salty chips. They'll get thirstier and drink more expensive margaritas. Then I could truly say ol\u00e9.", "author": "wendella a."}

I have had dinner and brunch twice each before making my final call on your star rating. Now I feel like I could go on and on with little critiques but I dont think its necessary. I think that the overall problem with this place is that its a chain. Yes, its true, it is indeed a chain. Except I think that the guy that owns it tries to cover this fact up by naming the other restaurant a different name, Consuelo in Santana Row, but the menu is exactly the same. Now...I also heard....although I dont know if its true or not, that the person who owns Consuelo also owns a lot of the other restaurants at Santana Row, which for those of you not in the know, is a super bougie richie bitchie area of San Jose. I guess the result of all of this is there is NO love in the food (honestly I found all the dishes I tried to be mediocre, bland, and only luke warm), and NO creativity in the menu.\n\nColibri!

I made the reservation for 6 pm. Got there early and sat down at 5:45 pm because there was NO WAIT on a Thursday. We were done with our meal and out the door by 7 pm. This gave us ample time to flit about Geary and look in all the historic old hotels and play Tourist.\n\nWHAT I HAD EXPECTED: Best guacamole in the city, it's beyond compare, and can you believe it - they make it right next to your table!\nWHAT WENT DOWN: The extent of \"customization\" is them asking how hot you want the guacamole. Also, I didn't see them make it table side because they did it behind me. What's the point of doing it table side if only one member of the party can see how it's done?

We started with the guacamole because we saw it at another table and it looked good.  We ordered it extra spicy, and they made it just right, with a good amount of kick from the jalapenos.  It was a bit pricey ($10 I think), but I don't mind overpaying a little bit if the food tastes good.  It was also a little weird eating the guac with tortillas (as opposed to tortilla chips), but the tortillas tasted very fresh, and I liked it in the end.\n\nFor our main dinner, we had the filet mignon, the chicken mole, the cornbread side, and the potato au gratin-ish side.  The steak was perfectly cooked, and had a great chipotle sauce.  The potatoes and the goat cheese-stuffed chili were great compliments to the steak.  The only negative thing I have to say about the steak was that it was a little bit too small -- I guess I didn't notice that they considered their menu as \"small plates.\"  I definitely wanted more!\n\nOn the other hand, the mole, which was recommended by the server, was the weakest dish we had.  The flavor was much milder in flavor than all the good moles I've had, and I found lacking in spice or \"oomph.\"  I don't know how to describe it, but it just wasn't very good.  \n\nThe potatoes au gratin (with a chili cream sauce) was pretty good sized and very cheesy, just the way I like it.  The corn bread was not as good, but still very tasty, and my girlfriend liked it more than I did.  \n\nWe didn't have room for dessert after the meal because we ate so much food, but the ones that went by looked very good.

No one came to take our drink order or acknowledge us for 20 mins.  Appetizer was forgotten and they just came with our entrees.  We asked for the appetizer and they just put our entrees under the heat lamps for 15 mins after telling us they wouldn't do that.  \n\nJust as our entrees arrive they seat a table of 4 marina types (or maybe inner richmond), in their 30's, with a 6 month old baby next to us. No big deal, until the baby starts screaming and the mom proceeds to start breastfeeding in front of everyone.  And they acted like they either didn't give a damn about everyone else's Friday night or they're just so full of themselves they're beyond reality.

I gave Colibri a shot based on the reviews here, and was rewarded with Mexican delights undreamt of at the local Taqueria. \r\n\r\nI'm from San Diego, I know what Carnitas are. Not. What I enjoyed at Colibri were delightfully flavored with the most remarkable texture; Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. The sea bass was firm and wonderfully flavorful as was the chicken covered in an unsweetened chocolate sauce (Mole Poblano). The Guacamole (made at the table) was also excellent and served with soft tortillas. \r\n\r\nNo real negatives to report, though if you want super hot n' spicy you'll be disappointed. Colibri is about flavor, not nuking your mouth with hot peppers. \r\n\r\nEntrees are $10-$15, most appetizers $7-10 and the Margaritas they will work hard to sell you (OK, maybe they really don't need to work too hard to sell them) are $10-15. Service was very quick and pleasant. We walked in at 6:30 on a Monday and sat right down, but by 7:30 it was fairly full.", "author": "Bill S."}

This is not the same kind of churro you'll find at the LA Zoo or Santa Cruz boardwalk. If I had to create a comparison for these churros, the ones from Colibri would be considered Buckingham Palace and the ones from a random stand would be the White House. \n\nThe White House churros are more authentic and made for (and by) the common man. They represent the majority of churros out there (except for the past 8 years) and they are readily available for us to find. \n\nThe Buckingham Palace churros are pure royality. They are far and few between and they taste like the gold that is lined in the hallways of this establishment. They could be considered more \"white-washed,\" but I'm totally okay with it. \n\nGive me David Beckham and Helen Mirren anyday. I want the churro that's laced with caramel syrup and ice cream.

I could no longer stand the site of them.\n\nSo I kept thinking about what makes the holy grail when it comes to good food, dining, entertainment.. and then thought about it some more.. until i got frustrated and almost threw my laptop down a plight of stairs.\n\nSo with all that frustration with trendy restaurants you can probably guess what happened to me last week..\"I WAS INDIRECTLY PERSUADED TO GO TO ANOTHER TRENDY RESTAURANT.\"\n\nI have to say i really liked this place. First thing was the tequila menu was just so extensive you literally couldn't help but go into paralysis by analysis mode. \n\nThere's a very authentic decor inside this place. Roman Castle like high ceilings with expensive chandeliers that look like they're from the Roman Empire days. Everything just felt solid in that joint.\n\nThe chips and salsa were the best i've ever had point blank period. You have to just try it with guacamole, it'll take you to another world. The salsa itself is so flavorful and thick it's a full out assault on your palette. I was typical post-work trance and it woke me right up.\n\nFor entree's, the filet mignon with ancho chile and stuffed goat cheese were up there with Michael Jordan and Kobe. Filet mignon just melted in your mouth and the sauce was amazing. \n\nI tried my girlfriend's Sopa de Tortilla which was a slightly spicy dish but done so tastefully and in such a pleasant non-imposing way that you just couldn't help but cherish every bite.\n\nJudging by the reaction of the other 6 people we had in our group, all of their orders more than fulfilled their expectations.\n\nDefinitely worth it to go here folks.", "author": "Jafar Amir Hanovic Ismailov M."}

Colibri was great from all aspects: the food, the drinks, the ambiance, and the service!\r\n\r\nRick H. and I decided to check it Colibri last night, and conveniently booked our reservation on OpenTable.\r\n\r\nWe were seated immediately, and the service was extremely prompt. Oscar was our waiter as well as our \"Tequila Sommelier\" (okay, so I just coined that phrase but he was the equivalent of that!). The tequila selection at Colibri is truly something to write home about. For anyone who had a couple of lousy nights in college with 5 too many shots of Cuervo (I think that covers just about all of us), I highly recommend giving it another chance.\r\n\r\nWe ended up trying two tequila samplers (not unlike a wine flight), which featured 3 half shots of tequila that have been aged different amounts of time, from younger to older: blanco, reposado, and anejo. Within each of these categories, the tequila is then sub-classified into the flavor categories gentil, moderato, and agresivo. This was all new to me! Oscar was incredibly patient and helped us choose some great tequilas. The first flight we had in the agresivo category featured a blanco, a reposado, and anejo all with vanilla and honey undertones... uhhh... YUM!\r\n\r\nThen we realized... oh yeah, there's food here, too! Rather than chips, Colibri brings out warm, fresh-off-the-griddle corn tortillas and 3 different salsas (ranging from very mild to HOT HOT HOT! The yellow one is the mildest, green is medium, and red is hot). We ordered the guacamole, which Oscar prepared table-side with great finesse. It was perfectly done, not too chunky, not too smooth.\r\n\r\nFor the dishes, we ordered the Ensalada Romana, the Mole Poblano, and the Filete Mignon. The Ensalada Romana was like a Mexican Caesar salad and extremely yummy. The plate was full of hearts of romaine topped with a zesty lemon-anchovy vinaigrette and plenty of shredded Parmesan.\r\n\r\nThe Mole Poblano featured a few pieces of chicken (breast and leg) smothered in a ridiculously good mole sauce. The sauce had JUST the right amount of seasoning: a warm blend of spices and a delightful hint of chocolate.\r\n\r\nThe Filete Mignon was also outstanding. The fillet was topped off with a goat-cheese stuffed pepper and surrounded by a wonderful sauce, begging to be sopped up by the extra tortillas.\r\n\r\nDuring our entire meal (we were there nearly 2 hours), Oscar constantly checked in on us and made sure we were taken care of.\r\n\r\nThe ambiance is fun and lively, but at the same time, not deafeningly loud.\r\n\r\nHighly, highly recommended. I can't wait to go back and try more of their tequilas! Colibri takes great care of their patrons, and I look forward to dining there again soon!", "author": "Jill M."}

I remember telling all of my friends about it, the old-fashioned way, through word of mouth.  Yes, folks.  That was BY.  Before Yelp.\n\nThen after joining Yelp, couldn't bring myself to review it.  I wanted to keep it to myself.  Ha!  Now it has over 200 reviews and is no longer a coveted secret.  But you know what?  Who cares!  It's still great. Sometimes I have to remind myself that just because something becomes popular doesn't make it bad.  And Colibri has maintained the personal service and cozy atmosphere that I was attracted to in the first place.\n\nAlways excellent as a pre-theater or post-shopping choice, Colibri is famous for the guacamole prepared tableside and the wonderful margaritas.  I like the 3 dipping sauces with the warm tortillas that start off your meal.  The top shelf margarita as well as the fruit options are all good - my favorites are blackberry and passionfruit as they are not too sweet.\n\nYou can make a meal from the appetizers or order entrees.  I am particularly fond of the sauces they use, such as the mole or pipian.  Tonight I had the Pato (Duck) with Pipian with a side of the cornbread smothered in green sauce.  It was delicious.\n\nThe other thing I need to remind myself about is that tempting as they are, you can only have ONE margarita before a show.  Otherwise, head-bobs will ensue.  And you don't want to be THAT GUY in the audience with the tequila breath and the bobbing.  No, no.\n\nFor upscale Mexican food, Colibri is a dependable and highly enjoyable restaurant.", "author": "Liz S."}

Perhaps a few margaritas would have made dinner taste better.... but we went sans alcohol.\n\nThe tortilla soup and the churros are what got 2 stars from me... all the rest I have had  much better elsewhere, and for the normal price would have been severely disappointed...\n\nSeems like a nice bar area though, and i did appreciate the old mexican nacho libre-ish movie on the big screen...", "author": "Annie M."}

HOWEVER last night I went with a group of 6 and got a really bad vibe from our waitress, Daniella. \n\nFirst she tried to push the margaritas on us. Then when we were ordering our food, she kept trying to upsell everyone on the side dishes--so much so that my friends were worried that what they'd ordered wouldn't be enough. But when the food came, it was so much food, we couldn't finish it all. Also when my husband ordered, he said he was thinking about ordering a side dish (potatoes au gratin), but asked her to come back to him. He never actually ordered it. Then when the food came, they brought the potatoes! \n\nI don't have a problem with a server trying to upsell as long as they are honest about the food portions. I felt that Daniella was dishonest about that, and also stealth-ordering the potatoes was not cool. \n\nIf it is the managers who are pressuring the servers to upsell, they are doing the restaurant a disservice. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I will be reluctant to go back.", "author": "Miya K."}

Having eaten at Consuelo several times, I was pleasantly surprised to see this restaurant appear in this neck of the woods. However, for some reason, some luster was lost between the stretch of freeway that separates the warmth and vivaciousness of Consuelo and this smaller, darker version near Union Square.  Maybe it is because it is simply out done by the cosmopolitan intrigue of other restaurants  in this city. Don't know. \n\nThe tortillas and trio of salsas are a great way to start the meal.  So great, that we requested more tortillas. Not once, not twice, not even thrice - four times we had to request tortillas.  Service, as you can probably tell, was lacking. My suspicions about the quality of service were confirmed when I asked one of the waitresses for more tortillas and noted that this was in fact, our fourth request without having received anything. Instead of running off to get more tortillas, our chubby faced waitress gave a sarcastic smile paired with a sharply edged response and waddled back to the kitchen area, only to return a hearty 15 minutes later carrying a stack of perhaps 20 tortillas - sarcasm in corn pancakes, who would have thought? (Note: a sarcastic smile was left by me when it came time for the tip. :) \n\nCatty commentary aside, the food was decent. The guacamole is a must - they don't serve it with chips but will upon request.  The house margarita is good, just not very stiff.  I would skip the duck (Pato en Pipian) which was a little overcooked; the sauce luke warm.  The carnitas are always a favorite of mine at Consuelo - here they were good, but a little tough.  The chicken over mashed potatoes was good.  The potatoes au gratin are fantastic - just like mom used to make - bubbly and browned with a little bit of green chiles for flair. \n\nIf given the choice between Consuelo and Colibri, I would air on the side of Consuelo.   The extra mileage to Santa Clara is justified by the shopping opportunities on Santana Row...Gucci and Burberry lovers, eat your heart out! When it comes to Colibri, it would be good for a drink and some guac after shopping on Union Square, when you're not in the mood for your more standard Mexican options of refried beans, burritos, etc.", "author": "Nicole S."}

We had a pitcher of Sangria, fresh guacamole, and then 2 dishes that I cannot for the life of me remember their names but boy can I describe them.\n\nSangria: AMAZING!  Best I have ever had.  Just the right mixture with it being not to strong and not too sweet.  I could drink way to much of it and I probably did tonight.  Best deal is to get the pitcher for $18 instead of glass for $6.  We easily finished it and the glasses are way to small that if I just went by those I would have felt ripped off.\n\nGuacamole/Tortillas/Salsa:  All very good.... especially the corn tortillas.  The guacamole was your standard fresh guacamole but what really grabbed the deal was the warm corn tortillas along with the dipping salsas.  The pineapple salsa was especially good.\n\nEntrees:  Both plates were great and perfectly portioned.  Neither of us could finish... granted we ate like cows with the drinks and guac.  I had a chicken with a red sauce and mash potatoes (with spinach mixed in).  The red sauce tasted like a tomato bisque soup which luckily, I love.  But the mash potatoes really took the cake, very unique and good but bordering too much spinach.\n\nOver all great food.  The atmosphere isn't anything to write home about by the sangria and tortillas give it an automatic 5 star.  The restaurant is intimate so getting in without a long wait can be hit or miss.  We had a somewhat early dinner at 5 and were virtually the first people in there while another time we tried to go at 9:30 and there was still an hour wait.\n\nDefinitely a must try.", "author": "Dani N."}

But we're loud too, and this only boosted our usual volume.\n\nThe margarita was wonderfully tangy fresh, Eeb's Sangria might be the best I've had in eons. The little fresh tortillas and salsa, fabulous, especially the yellow (Pineapple?) and the green tomatillo. \n\nWe had the Queso Fundido con Chorizo, Eebs began waxing nostalgic over latchkey childhood memories of her own ghetto microwave version. Colibri's was supremely delish with the fresh tortillas. I could have stopped there, but we proceeded with a fab salad: the Ensalada Mixta. We then split the Callos de Hacha (scallops), and they were soooo good, sooo good; I mean, cooked to perfection and every single thing on the plate belonged on the fork with every bite. Alas, the meal ended there, if it hadn't have been for the filling Queso, we would have been eating dessert.\n\nNot to be neglected in mentioning:\n\nHere are the cool things about eating at the bar, as we did. \n\n1) The bartender/servers were so awesome, asking us if we liked our food, and it was so obvious we were little pigs and practically rolling in it, that they had a good time with us, and we always had a drink at the ready.\n\n2) The best old-school Mexi-Cinema playing on the LCD over the bar.

My friend and I started with the fresh guacamole prepared table side. It was yummy! I was surprised that it was served with warm freshly made corn tortillas instead of chips. Along with the tortillas, it also can with 3 different types of dipping sauces: tomatillos, salsa, and mango pineapple salsa. All were very fresh and delicious.\n\nWe decided to order two entrees to share. Taking our waiter's recommendation, we had the stuffed chicken breast with mushrooms and corn. I really enjoyed this dish the best. The chicken was so moist and flavorful and the skin was so crispy. The mushrooms and corn stuffed in it was also very good. Next, we had the prawns and cornbread muffin. This dish reminded me of bbq prawns and herb biscuits but with a Mexican flare to it. It was very savory and tasty.

My date knows the bartender, Adrian, so we settled on having dinner at the bar in order to get the real experience of the restaurant. \n\nAfter a few minutes of deciding where to settle in the bar and having the owner coming over to greet us and inquire about our past visits to Adrian (this would be directed at the boy, not me, as I have never been so lucky to come before), a plate of jalapenos magically appears before us and is then drizzled with Cointreau and Cazadores. And what is not the final touch of perfection but a nice roasting session in the tequila/triple sec concoction?!? After 5 minutes of even firing, Adrian removes the jalapenos and crushes them into ice like one would a mojito, continues to build on the flavor by adding the remainder roasting liquid intermittenly between layers of mix and additional Cazadores. Served with a jalapeno, this drink is quite unique as it starts off like a normal margarita but steadily builds with fire as you swallow bits of jalapeos. Very lovely finish.\n\nWe then moved forward with our orders of guacamole and my personal favorite, sopes. The guacamole arrives fresh in a mocajete, tasting twenty times better than my Puerto Vallartan uncle's famous grind and served with the world's most delicious handmade corn tortillas. Not to mention that the sopes were finished off with a touch of fried crispness that most restaurants fail to achieve. We followed with a simple, traditional caesar salad and the final finale of carnitas that must have received three hail marys and a blessing of the santos before finding it's way to our bar stoop.\n\nOh, but of course! there is tequila involved. It's absolutely ridiculous to walk into a Mexican restaurant and order a Fat Tire (as some uncultured sap with his all-elbows wife decided to squeeze in next to me and order...resulting in my bluntly asking them to scoot further down so I could recover my ribcage from being battered)! But let's get back to the positive vibes, as this is about the restaurant and not inconsiderate people.\n\nWhat is wonderful about Adrian is that not only does he intuitively know exactly what you want to drink, but he watches facial expressions and observes his customers reactions to the ongoing bustle in the restaurant. Please, people, not in a creepy way! He's very quiet and calm and it resonated splendidly throughout our experience. After the jalapeno margaritas, we moved into his suggested tastings. We decided on three anejos after multiple selections that really tapped our heart strings: Don Valente, Real de Penjamo, and Sotol Hacienda de Chihuahua. The final was at the recommendation of a lovely politician gentleman visiting the city from Chihuhua with his two sons to look at colleges. Our evening ended wonderfully talking to the fine senor and trying to undrown his soft-spoken eloquent accent from admist the noise of people and alluring effects of tequila. I lost last minute focus when another bartender started to create a blackberry margarita that my eyes widened three times their normal size at, in which Adrian knowningly nodded and softly asked if I would like one. \n\nPlease note that he does not force you into outlandishly priced drinks or tequila selections, and he always asks to make sure you are getting exactly what you want. I wish I could keep him in my pocket to take along on all future restaurant adventures; he was hands down the best bartender I have encountered in the city.", "author": "Alita M."}

Because I'm a huge fan of Rick Bayless and the many wonderful Mexican restaurants in Chicago and can cook a mean Mexican dinner myself, I am tired of being directed to Taquerias for the best that SF has to offer in Mexican cuisine.\n\nThis place changed my mind! I went here early last December for a special dinner with my boyfriend and his parents. The decor was old Mexico style: beautiful dark wood and large, enclosed booths. Our service was outstanding!! The manager came by to ask how everything was, but the server, a young woman who I wanted to hug after our meal, made the experience. She was friendly and attentive, but not fake or in our faces. I wish I could remember her name... she was one of the best servers I've encountered in years.\n\nI don't know what kind of drinks the other yelpers had, but ours were amazing. We had several specialty margaritas and the berry ones were unique and lovely. More importantly, the food lived up to the great descriptions on the menu.\n\nAnd, oh, the guacamole... mmmmmm. Save up your drunken taco money and come here for a real taste of Mexican cuisine.\n\nnb.\nI just went back here the other night and had to find out that all-star server's name: Bethany. She's terrific!! and the blackberry margarita still rocks.", "author": "G Z."}

We requested pepper, but that still wasn't enough to salvage it.\n\nWe requested our filet mignon to be medium rare; it came out medium well.\n\nThe carnitas were also overcooked and dry.\n\nThe espresso flan was pretty good, though (not spectacular, but we ate most of it).\n\nThere was a mistake on our bill (we were charged a drink we didn't get).  But service was so slow, that we decided to just ignore it so we could get a move on our night.\n\nWe did get 1000 open table points, though.\n\nYou might end up here because you want Mexican, but you want a full bar or you want a nice sit down meal.  Do yourself a favor, get over it.  (OK.  I've never been to Maya, so maybe head there.)  Get your Mexican fill from one SF's excellent taqueria's or do without the full bar and head to Mi Lindo Yucatan in Noe Valley.  This place is not worth it.", "author": "S J."}

She assures us it'll be no problem and puts our name into Open Table. We settle down to the bar and savor some perfect margaritas and caiparinhas. An hour goes by, and we let the hostess know that we'd like to sit. The manager comes over straight away and takes us to a table in the very back of the restaurant, right by the waitstation and the bathroom. Not really wanting to be in such immediate proximity to the surprisingly dingy and dirty bathrooms, we inform the hostess we'd like to wait for another table. And here's where everything starts to fall apart.\n\nThe heavily-cologned manager comes over and informs us it will be thirty minutes before we could be seated at a different table. We say sure, no problem. Thirty minutes will be fine. He asks us again, are we sure we don't want the other table? Again, not a problem, we say. But your bar seats are already gone, he replies. Are we sure we want to wait thirty min? Hmm.... starting to feel like he's threatening us to take the lousy table! But no, we will wait thirty min. We'll have another $12 margarita. \n\nAN HOUR AND A HALF LATER : 5 walk-in tables have been seated. We watch them walk in, watch them be seated. Frustration mounting!!! We inquire at the host desk. Apparently the hostess marked us as No Show in OT. One of my dining companions gets a bit stern with the manager ( a rarity for him) and we finally , finally get seated. We were very close to walking out, but didn't want to wait for a table somewhere else. \n\nOnce we were seated, the server was extremely attentive. It would have been nice for the manager to send us a round of drinks, or an amuse, or SOMETHING, but he apparently was unconcerned with fixing a bad situation. Ah well. The guacamole was delightful! I love the dipping sauces for the warm tortillas they serve in lieu of tortilla chips.The sangria was ok, and the entrees tasted....perfect. I had the filet mignon, and it was cooked excellently. I would def recommend getting an appetizer as well as an entree, because the portion size it T-I-N-Y. This wouldn't be a problem if they were advertised on the menu as small plates or tapas, but I was expecting a full entree. Hrm. Dessert was average. \n\nAll in all, Colibri could be great if they got their management situation figured out. The bathrooms were unacceptable, the hostess was demonstrably flaky, and the manager himself was rude and incompetent.

This is a nice, sit-down Mexican restaurant with a warm, sunny decor.  Crowd is older, which was surprising given they have bottomless mimosas.  They give you three complimentary salsas which was good but I was disappointed that it was served with soft tortillas not crispy nacho chips.  We actually ended up not getting mimosas (alcohol the night before + coffee in the morning + spicy salsa for brunch = not a happy stomach) but the food was pretty good and authentic, so we were glad we found this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-07-17", "description": "Yet another mediocre and overpriced restaurant in the Union Square area that attracts mainly tourists and theater-goers looking for a convenient bite to eat.  I don't understand the 4-star rating, but maybe the majority were written by middle america out-of-towners who have never tasted mexican food before.\n\nI'll start with the bar...6 of us ordered house margaritas. I can honestly say that it was the worst margarita I have ever had. Not one of us liked it. First of all I prefer blended to rocks any day but they don't even do blended (rolls eyes).  What we got was a flavorless mix of a lot of margarita mix, very little tequila, and a crap load of ice that watered down an already too watery concoction.  The bartender also seemed unfriendly, but maybe he's just not happy working at a sub-par restaurant.\n\nThe food....meh....they don't have many classic Mexican dishes that I was hoping for. The entree selection seemed dominated by things that seemed more American to me than Mexican. Just because you throw some Mexican spices onto a leg of lamb doesn't make it Mexican food. I ordered the tilapia tacos. They gave me 3 tiny corn tortillas with very minimal filling, which were $12. I could have easily eaten 3 more and I'm not even a big eater. I also ordered a side of black beans which was $6. I could go to Rubio's (mexican fast food chain) and have the same thing for under $10, which would fill me up more and taste just as good if not better. Ouch.\n\nThe prices. We expected to pay a lot because of the location...okay, that's fine, I get it, but give me something I can sink my teeth into if that is going to be the case...the portions were offensively small and there were absolutely no perks.  We even had to pay for the little birthday crepe and tiny scoop of ice cream that we requested for our friend's bday.  \n\nSomething really popular here is the made-at-your-table guacamole. It sucks, don't get it, unless watery guacamole is your thing. They put way too much lime juice in it. You also don't get very much. Plus, it's 12 bucks and if you want it with chips, it'll cost you 14. I wouldn't be surprised if they charge for tap water. \n\nThe service was also nothing to write home about.  I don't remember anyone coming to our table to check on us or even to refill our waters.\n\nNeedless to say, I won't be back.", "author": "L. Renee D."}

I'm from New Mexico, so I know a good Tamale when I taste one. The Tamale appetizer came with three small tamales already out of the husk with a light brown Mole sauce over them. They tasted fine but I felt they were a bit mushy, perhaps over steamed because they are smaller than a standard size tamale. The mole enhanced the taste and to me tasted similar to a Satay Sauce only not so nutty. The only downside to the appetizer was swallowing a small chicken bone that was inside one of the tamales.\n \nFor the next course I decided to try the Jicama Salad with Citrus wedges, avocado, cilantro and Chile Piquin dressing. \nThis was a colorful and healthy serving on top of Jicama slices that were in a small stack, the citrus wedges were more crushed than wedge like but definitely added to the crunchiness of the Jicama. The avocado was also a nice layer of flavor and the chile piquin dressing was not overly spicy but more of a lightly sour dressing which added to the sweetness of the citrus.\n \nBy the time I finished the salad I was full and opted not to order an entree' however one of my friends ordered the Carnitas served with Guajillo and Chile de Arbol Salsa; she let me have a taste. A healthy serving of 4 large pieces of Carnitas was served with the salsa served on the side. The salsa was a bit spicy, but in my opinion it only enhanced the Carnitas. The Carnitas were very tender and flavorful. Anyone who needs a cornivore fix will leave the table satisfied.\n \nWe ended the meal with Dessert, I ordered the Mango Creme Brulee', my two other friends ordered the Churros and Tres Leches cake. All three were quite good but we felt the Mango Creme Brulee' was the best, very light and the sweetness of the mango brought out the creme brulee'. The Churros are handmade and filled with a Cajeta sauce, rolled in sugar and cinnamon and served warm with ice cream. I felt the churros although tasty were a bit heavy but tasted nice with the single espresso I had with my dessert. The third dessert, the Tres Leches cake was good but our least favorite. The menu said sponge cake with tres leches but we didn't see or taste the tres leches, it was very sweet and light.\n\nOne of my friends had a Mojito and I had a soft drink, our bill averaged $40per person.", "author": "David P."}

Colibri has great mood lighting, a nice paint job, good bones, beautiful tile, mexican art, and awesome heavy cast iron chandeliers.\n\nColibri also has a sexy menu.

So me and the BFF decided to go small and just order 2 appetizers and a salad. Its the reverse diet of after drinking (not fatty and fried but light, airy and crisp). \n\nThe tomales oaxaquenos were amazing. The chicken was soft and the masa was fresh. The mole sauce was smoky and had earthy flavors. We thought it could be anise or tamarind (pulling spices out of our arses we had no idea what we were talking about but pretended to be foodies on tv describing each bite) and just went on and on about the flavor. The sopes sortidos were yummy bites of tortilla/corn/starch something breads topped with pulled pork, chicken, sour cream, fresh cheese, etc. It was plenty and deliciouso. We were served complimentary fresh mini tortillas with 3 different salsas. Salsa me! I'd slather that stuff on over a chocolate spa treatment anytime. It was really good. We finished off the meal with an ensalada mixta. In theory it sounded good, but at first bite it was sooooooo sour and drenched in dressing. We could see the dressing glazed on the plate. We did not finish it or even eat the bulk of the lettuce leaves. It was just so sour. I don't think when you eat salad you should be squinting and blinking as if you have something caught in your eye. I wanted to let the waitress know about the terrible salad but I refrained only because we were full and we didn't care to have a replacement salad. I'll let that one slide as a miss on the menu. \n\nI would like to revisit Colibri to give it a chance at four stars.

Restaurant was full, but not overly so (I hate super crowded places where you accidentally butt brush someone else's face while walking to your table).

Ordered the guacamole which was hand made at our table - yummy! Skip the chips (obv store bought) and go straight for the tortillas. The ceviche was big enough for the 4 of us, I thought it was ok - I usually like mine a bit more tart but it was fine. We split  entrees - the filet mignon, the chicken mole, the lamb shank and the duck. Hmmm, now that I type that out it doesn't seem very Mexican food-y, but there you go. Also ordered a side of the corn bread with the poblano sauce. The consensus favorite was the corn bread and the filet; I liked the mole, although it wasn't as robust as I normally like and was a little thin. The lamb was ok and I don't really remember the duck (though that may be because I was on my 2nd cazadores margarita by that time). Topped off dinner with the flan and the chocolate cake. \n\nOverall, I feel like nothing particularly stood out entree wise except for the mole but that may be because mole just tastes different, period.

Having said that the service here is excellent and the food is pretty good. I went here as a pre-Sweeny Todd dinner. Our hostess told us to inform our waiter of this and he would expedite our service to make the show. The party I was with had already been here and raved about the guacamole. So we had two orders  (between 4 people), I ordered the tortilla soup, two ordered the chile relleno and the other ordered some kind of seafood dish i will discuss later. \n\nWith most Mexican/Latin American themed restaurants I always expect chips and salsa starters. Not here. Colibri just had to be different. Instead of chips we were served freshly grilled mini tortillas to dip in our mild/Mango, medium/Verde and spicy salsas. It was nice that there was a variety, never had that before. Our guacamole appetizer ($10) was freshly prepared in front of us to order. We all wanted spicy and usually I can't handle the spicy but this was goooood. We chit chatted for a bit and before we knew it our food ha arrived. \n\nPresentation was beautiful and the overall quality was very good. I do want to touch on this seafood dish though. I love me food from the sea, I really do. Yet all my life I have had problems eating tentacles of anything tentacle-having. I love calamari but will only eat it in steak or fried ring form; preferring the later. The seafood skewer had beautiful mussels and shrimp and a whole octopus. Yep you read it, a whole baby sized octipi. Huge head all eight tentacles and all. Granted it was grilled an discolored but it was all still in tact. I didn't so much gross me out as I just wanted to pull it off my cousins plate and do some \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" scenes. Just thought I'd throw that warning out there. \n\nSo the food was excellent, we didn't have time for dessert. The attention to our needs was met and we were a happy party.", "author": "Alia D."}

My girlfriend and I arrived here to meet some friends before a show at Ruby Skye, and we had such a bad experience that I actually created a Yelp account to warn others.\n\nThe service was atrocious. We saw our server so rarely that we were forced to go the bar for several drinks. And on that note - I have been bartending for four years, but apparently bartenders in SF are above saying \"thank you\" for a 25% tip on two shots. It's not that hard, guys.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered a \"Greyhound\" - which I clarified with the server was a \"vodka and grapefruit\" - that after some absurd amount of time came back as a vodka/cranberry. When our dinner eventually arrived, we were uncertain if we perhaps ordered off the kids' menu. The appetizer chicken quesadilla came as three tiny tortillas with some chicken and cheese haphazardly thrown in the middle. My girlfriend ordered off the salad menu, but it looked more like a side salad at Denny's than a light dinner. And the guacamole that everyone seems to rave about? Save a few bucks and mash an avocado with some tomato, because that's what it tasted like. Certainly not spicy as we requested, and we threw our own salsa in to add the lacking taste. \n\nWhen the bill arrived for $140, I was flabberghasted. For whatever reason, the restaurant charged us for Grey Goose, despite no one at our table requesting that particular vodka for our four vodka-based drinks. The management reversed the charge when I inquired about it, but I wouldn't be shocked if they told the servers to just resort to more expensive call drinks.\n\nInevitably, we should have eaten at the Jack in the Box next door. More food, better service, and a hundred bucks cheaper.", "author": "Matt R."}

The sangria is delicous, and Colibri has a great selection of Tequilas to get the night started.  Instead of the usual basket of chips and salsa you get at most Mexican restaurants, Colibri offers warm, homemade tortillas with a selection of three salsas.  They also make your guacamole tableside, which is awesome because I can tell them to make mine super spicy and without onions!  (That's about as customized as it gets).  The duck with tomatillo sauce is by far my favorite dish, and the desserts are good as well.  \n\nGreat place to have a dinner with family or a group of friends, although you can avoid a 30 - 45 minute wait by making a reservation.\n\nMonday night (if I remember correctly), they have live guitar music.\n\nOverall, one of the best (and most authentic) \"formal\" Mexican places.", "author": "Emily C."}

We were greeted a few minutes later and stuck in a small table way in the back.  The table was a bit on the small size, but it seems not to be a place for a party of 2 and geared to larger parties.  \n\nFirst the drinks, I order the Sangria which was ok, the chunks of fruit was diced into very small pieces, some a bit indistinguishable.    Now to the food, we didn't get appetizers because  my friend is diabetic and couldn't eat most of the items.  We both got Pescado del Dia minus the chorizo from the sauce and a side of Hongos Chileajo (mushrooms) and Nopales Asados (grilled cactus).  I didn't care for the mushrooms there was too much of a tang, but loved the grilled cactus.  The main course dishes were served with a side of corn tortilla which was so delicious and was the main reason I was filled up.  The main courses are \"small plates\" and the side dishes is a good idea if you're really hungry.  The food had great flavor, really light and ingredients complemented each other well.  Only down side was the 3 different types of salsa that was served with our meal had no heat.\n\nYes I would go again, because there are more items I would like to try.  The special looked great and something I would like to try in the future.  The noise level of this place is very loud regardless of where you sit, this place was packed with several large groups.  There's a bar area in the front and is a great place to meet up with friends.", "author": "Twist' D."}

Tables around us we're in need of a server to take their order.  After 10-15min, we were never greeted.  No sorry, no water, not even a \"I'll be right with you\".

Also, it's incredibly expensive for how dull everything tasted.

The wrought iron gates and chandeliers, the rustic wooden chairs and tables evoke the charm of a place old and familiar. Ironically, Mexico isn't what's familiar in this self-styled \"Mexican Bistro.\" Instead there is a whisper of Havana in the air.\n\nIf Hemingway drank tequila, he would have his own seat at Colibri. At the bar the tequila sun also rises in a splendid corona of over 200 artisan and commercial agave nectars ready to liven your mood. \n\nThe personality of tequila as I have gathered over years of friendship is that it's a little bit mischievous and a whole lot irreverent. On the wall behind the Colibri bar you'll see a tequila bottle shaped like a Dick Tracy gun, another comes in a caterpillar bottle where the head is the cork stopper, and when you begin to chuckle inside, you're beginning to understand what I mean by irreverent. The tequilas here span the range of color and depth from lustrous bronze to autumn yellow to ether clear. Whatever shade of flavor you desire, or, didn't know you desire, you can find it here. \n\nIf you're lucky on your venture to Colibri, you'll catch \"Adrian\" tending bar. Don't be ashamed to request him by name, he enjoys his celebrity as much as you will his drinks. Have him make you a \"consuelo\" (it means solace) where a medley of fresh squeezed citrus including grapefruit, lemon, lime, and orange go into an adobe bowel filled with ice, then topped with a select reposado tequila. Sipping this refreshing concoction is a step closer to finding your inner joy. \n\nAccompany your tequila buzz with some delectable latin fusion tapas. The fillet mignon in a smooth ancho sauce over a bed of mashed potatoes is a crowd pleaser. The sweet and mild ancho penetrates to the core of the steak in a powerful flavor boost. The fish tacos of white flakey fish hot from the grill is topped with a cool mango salsa. Add a little lime juice, take a bite and you'll be clamoring for another order before you're done chewing. \n\nTo off set the spicy food and the acidity of citrus, a sweet finish to your meal is in order. Don't miss the caramel filled churro with caramel ice cream. The decadent double serving is the perfect way to leave Colibri on a flurry.

Each of us had a different drink - very good margaritas and a mojito from an extensive \nmenu offering far too many choices.  \n\nOur dinner selection included the torta de elote, a savory corn bread with onions, bacon, chile pasilla, and a poblano pepper cream sauce ( $7 ),\ndefinitely not low calorie but delicious.  For entrees, we shared the filet mignon with ancho chile stuffed with goat cheese, over mashed potatoes with saut\u00e9ed spinach and chipotle chile sauce.  It was absolutely superb.  Another dish that got raves was the \"Callos De Hacha\" - pan seared scallops served over a potato-corn pur\u00e9e with saut\u00e9ed green beans, garlic and epazote.  As if those entrees weren't enough, we also ate pan seared duck breast and dark meat in a delicious green mole made with pumpkin seeds, tomatillos, nuts and spices.  We chose a side order of estofado zucchini, corn kernels, mushrooms, epazote and pasilla chile stew  ( $7.50 ) that was well worth the trip in itself!  \n\nMidst moans that we couldn't eat another bite, after perusing the dessert menu, we couldn't resist  pastel de chocolate -  warm, soft mexican chocolate cake, with vanilla ice cream  and the pastel de tres leches cake, a moist sponge cake covered with meringue frosting and white chocolate shavings - both excellent.....though I was considering the mango creme brulee as well....another time, perhaps.", "author": "Carmen H."}

However, the waitress kept us apprised, was appropriately apologetic, and the bar comped us shots of some fine tequila, so I left with a positive impression of the service.\n\nThe guacamole is yum (though we asked for spicy and it really wasn't), the ceviche was well-made, and the pudin de chocolat is a dark chocolate lover's wet dream.", "author": "Krisanne C."}

The fresh guacamole was deserving of its rep and the little tostadas that came second on the appetizer menu were delicious.  The tamales oaxaquenos were unimpressive, with an oddly flavorless mole and a gooey consistency.  I had a mango creme brulee for dessert, which sounded good but was too sweet for my taste (I prefer most of the sugar to be in the crust).

My cousin had an infused tequila which was also fabulous.\n\nAs for the food, we had grilled cactus and portabellos, the awesome homemade fresh tortillas and guac, chile relleno, a Mexican fusion sort of salad with sugared walnuts and the salty crumbly mexican cheese, and my cousin the meat eater had a fish dish.

Came here for a birthday where we sat in the back.  Since we had a lot of people, the birthday girl decided to choose a  prefix menu that consisted of two appetizers, a soup and a Cesar salad.  The entree was chili relleno, filet mignon, or halibut.  And for dessert creme mango brulee or tequila leche flan.\n\nSince I was with my bf, I was able to have him choose one dish while i chose the other.  As for the appetizers, the Caesar salad was nothing special aside from the fact that they did not cut the romaine lettuce.  The dressing was nicely coated on each piece of lettuce, but the croutons were not good and the Parmesan was only placed in one area.  The soup reminded me of a a enchilada, it had whole pieces of a Mexican cheese and crispy tortilla chips.\n\nFor the entrees, I had the chili relleno.  I am from Salinas and have a good amount of Mexican friends that make fun of me when i say chili relleno con queso because apparently when you think of chili relleno its a given that it has cheese.  I took this into consideration when i chose the chili relleno since I have not had this in ages.  And to my surprise when it came out..it had not cheese!! I guess this place doesn't follow the authentic Mexican culture?? I don't know but it was not good..sad So luckily I had my bf order the filet mignon and that was accompanied with goat cheese and this was decent, not the best but it was edible.  \n\nAs for the dessert, the best part of the meal.  The creme brulee was not the best...it did have mango pieces but it didn't seem cool enough, more of a room temperature.  The flan wasn't great either....i guess they like serving room temp desserts.\n\nThe only good things about this place is the alcohol..theres plenty of it =) and the food came with a few side plates of black beans, rice, and a medley of vegetables.  As for the bad, not the best Mexican food I've eaten and the service wasn't very great...they did not come by often to check if we needed more water or take our finished plates away.

(Nice because I last dined there with a picky eater that requested no cilantro in it.)  The sangria is only decent, as I've had much better (eg Fresca's at Fillmore), and the margaritas (virgin and non-virgin) were on the tart side.  I much prefer their mojitos.  In addition to the guacamole the following are others I devoured and thoroughly enjoyed: fish tacos, tortilla soup, carnitas, tres leches cake, and the mango creme brulee.

But, even with the crowded New Year's craziness going on, our server was always there when we needed him and did a great job of checking back without ever being pushy.  If anything, the service may have been a tad too quick, with our entrees coming just as we were finishing our apps.\n\nWe ordered a full on Mexican feast-- chicken mole, tamales, queso fundido, chicken tinga mini tostadas, whitefish with huitlacoche and even a filet mignon.  On the whole, everything was pretty darned tasty.  The filet mignon had excellent flavor but was a little tough and, honestly, I'm not so sure it was really filet mignon.  The sauce for my fish was also a little intense for my taste.  Everything else on the table was delicious-- including the complimentary homemade tortillas and salsa (yes, it's true... they charge for chips and give tortillas for free... fine by me).

The two mains arrived quickly, tamarindo mole shrimp with a corn cake--completely average, again no contrasts in taste or texture, the mole lacked its signature deep flavor profile. The portion relatively small. My partner had the chile relleno with chicarron--the stuffing was mushy and unappealing--the flavors fused together so that nothing stood out. The chile was rubbery.

First of all they brought us a sampler of 3 different salsas and hand made corn tortillas.  I stay away from carbs but I just had to try the tortillas--and they were so worth it!  The green chili salsa was perfectly spiced and there was a sweet corn salsa that was amazing.  The mimosas are also perfect--just a bit of hand-squeezed juice and a lot of champagne.  My husband I both had the carnitas omelet and they were perfect.  I'm not a big fan of omelets because there is usually a lot of egg and not much filling.  This omelet was perfectly balanced between meat and egg, the eggs light and fluffy and the meat in a tasty sauce.  It was served with these yummy, buttery home fries and THE BEST black bean puree I've ever had.  My daughter had the chilaquiles and they were also really, really good.  The service was amazing, my mimosa glass was never empty nor was the coffee or water.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Colibri for brunch, I'm thinking it is not for people who want traditional tex-mex fare.

The place was nice and we were seated right away but the table was really small and very close to other people and I didn't really feel comfortable having a conversation with him because I felt like i was bothering the people around us. As for the food, I ordered the  Ensalada Flor De Verano which sounded nice but was really just a blah thrown together mess that really didn't impress. As for my boyfriends food, he ordered the Chile Relleno which turned out to be a tiny little chile that didn't even have the traditional egg batter coating. The description boasted that it included chicharron and carnitas that came along with it, but it turned out to be just a small dusting of chicharron and a very small portion of carnitas if any. I felt really bad because after he ate it, he was still hungy.  Overall, I didn't feel like this was authentic Mexican food because it seemed to be more geared toward an American palate. The salsas were very mild and were given to us 10-15 minutes before getting chips like they expected us to taste the salsas with the spoons they provided along with them??? wth?

If you're in it for the food, however, think twice.\n\nWhen my parents and I arrived it was very crowded, especially at the bar, which seemed like a good sign. Our waiter brought us menus and drinks. Then came sign number one that something was horribly wrong: there was no free chips and salsa. Instead there were corn tortillas and some thin, liquidy sauces that seemed to belong at an Indian restaurant. I still don't get it.\n\nSo we scanned the menu, decided on guacamole, ceviche, a Caesar salad, and carnitas (de puerco). The guacamole was listed as \"made tableside\". It's not. A man comes to ask you how spicy you want it, and then it's brought to you in a glass bowl perched in a molcajete, which is the closest you'll get to authentic the entire meal. The guacamole does not come with tortilla chips. According to our waiter, Colibri doesn't HAVE tortilla chips... Sign number two: in the guacamole, my father found a hair.\n\nSoon after, the entrees arrived. My father had the carnitas, which were not carnitas by any Spanish definition of the word. It came as four large chunks of pork which were practically unseasoned. My mother and I split the ceviche and salad. The ceviche might have been the high point of the meal, but we've made better at home. It was a bit sad looking, floating in tomato juice, and there was almost no onion or avocado. The ceviche comes with... get this... tortilla chips! They were also corn, which masks the flavor of the ceviche. The salad was fine, not exciting, but it comes as whole hearts that you have to cut up. I was serious about getting tortilla chips for the guac, so I pulled a different waiter aside and asked for some more chips. He seemed baffled, but soon came back. Sign number three: he came bearing a plate with 7 tortilla chips on it. \n\nSo I'm confused. I'm thinking the four stars must be for the tequila.", "author": "Victoria N."}

He then described to us the order in which the food would be served. We expressed to him that we were hungry and the order wasn't of concern. He brought it all at once. Not the biggest deal, but still sort of weird. \n\nThe tides turned when the soup came to us lukewarm. Lukewarm! Not hot. Not cold. Lukewarm. Okay, whats up? \n\nThe tamales: Cold. Way too much Nestle Abuelitas chocolate in the mole. Reminiscent of burnt cinnamon. The rice: Decent. But cold. Ugh. The enchiladas: Neither tomatillos or jalepenos were present. I'm still not sure what the hell that was. We didn't finish it. The soup: As I mentioned, lukewarm, however, the waiter made an effort to rectify this by bringing a hot pan of soup to pour over our already cold soup. This did help the situation, but, not by much.

The staff is friendly and the service is OK but I was not crazy about the food. The guacamole is great but in most Mexican restaurants it is usually great. I ordered the carnitas a pork dish. I was expecting it to be like a stew and instead I got two pieces of fairly fatty pork meat. The tortilla soup was good, not great. We also had empanadas and again they were not that great. Maybe it is a matter of taste, other people would find the food delicious. But I have been to a lot of Mexican restaurants and I can taste the quality difference. I give it three stars to be polite.", "author": "Nicolas B."}

Get the Carnitas and Taco Soup, you'll never regret it.  The bar section tends to get a little loud, so if you want a more intimate dinner then request a booth or table in advance.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-17", "description": "Came here on a Monday night with 5 other people.  We had reservation so we didn't have to wait at all.  The place was really crowded at 8PM.  The live music was excellent but it made everyone talk super loud so the atmosphere here is definitely not \"romantic\" but almost \"chaotic\".  Overall I would say it's totally worth the visit if you're in the union square area and want to have a \"lively\" atmosphere for dinner but also eat a satisfying meal.\n\nWhat I liked:\nFood:\nWe started out with the freshly made guacamole.  I'll be honest, I make a pretty good guacamole myself but I still can't resist to order fresh guacamole in restaurants.  It turned out to be really good, as i would expect it to be.  We ordered the chips ($2 extra) to eat with the guac but it's the hand made tortillas that REALLY stood out. Seriously, how can i EVER eat another tortilla again after eating this?? \n\nI also ordered an ensalada mixta, which is just a simple mixed green salad with cherry vinaigrette and it was just ok.  I felt like there was too much dressing to my taste.  \n\nMy entree, however, was wonderful.  I had the Chamorro de Cordero, which is lamb shank steamed in banana leaves.  The meat was tender and falls off the bone.  the portion was huge.  I also had a bite of the carnitas but i thought it was a little dry.\n\nThe BEST part of the meal was definitely the dessert.  I'm so glad we decided to order some even though we were all pretty full.  The churros were fantastic!! and i don't even like churros!  They're filled with some kind of caramel cream in the center and served with ice cream.  I WILL come back just to eat them.  We also tried the Caballeros Pobres, which the waiter described as bread pudding like pastry served with honey but the group felt it tasted more like french toast.  Whatever it is, it is delicious.  It was the best dessert out of the 3 we tried.  The last one was the mango creme brulee and that was so good too.  Very mango-y with bits of fresh mango pieces.\n\nWhat I thought was blah:\nthe service:\nThere were so many times throughout the night that we had to try really hard to get someone or something for our table.  We also had to check on the status for the food/drinks we ordered a few times.  Even though the answer is usually something like \"it's on the way\" or \"i'll go check on it\", I feel like with a restaurant like this, the server should be more proactive with checking on us and communicating the status of our order to us without us having to do that.  One of our drinks didn't come for over 15 minutes and my salad, which the server specifically asked if I wanted to have it before my entree (and I said yes), did'nt come until after everyone started eating their entrees already (including myself).  In neither of those times did the server say anything to us.  We ordered chips with our guac and the chips didn't get served until at least 10-15 mins after the guac was served.  When we asked the server about our chips, he said that the chips are made fresh and are coming from the kitchen, which is fine, but I just felt like he could've told us that.  He was friendly though, but just not attentive enough.\n\nI would definitely come back because of the hand made tortillas and the awesome desserts.  I also want to try some more appetizer dishes since the others in my group had some of them and they seem to have really enjoyed them.  Oh, and yes they have a pretty impressive bar with lots of tequila choices too.", "author": "Cari H."}

It turned out to be something that was akin to a Jello pudding snack, with only the redolent and chalky taste of bittersweet chocolate to remind you what flavor this was. The limp dollop of cream was entirely superfluous. So too was my mango creme brulee, which had an unusual problem: parts of it were at a different temperature. The sugar topping that was warm --you know, like the scene in \"Amelie\" where she cracks the hardened topping? Uh well, no-- none of that here. Once I cut through that topping, the custard has tiny bits of mango in it, and not like the \"pieces\" that were promised on the menu. The taste was fine, but I didn't appreciate the cold, gummy feel of the custard while the top still had the warmth of the torch they used to caramelize the sugar. Big fail.\nFinally, did you all think people are fighting to  get in here because of the food? You must be kidding. It's the overpriced margaritas, mojitos and other drinks in the noisy bar. I tried the \"house margarita\" and, well, it was just OK. Honestly, I found it too strong, which normally people would favor. But I also took this to mean that the strength of the tequila must be a way to ply the customers into not caring too much about the lack of care the chefs would want to put into their food.

We came on a Saturday brunch & were greeted by a lovely hostess who sat us next to the tequila collection. They have over 300 kinds! \n\nWe ordered rice, black beans, carnitas & chilequiles. WOW! It was flavorful, pleasing to the eye & tummy, & totally hit the spot (so to speak). The tortillas are small in size, but think in texture & flavor. I also ordered a michelada (beer with lime juice & the glass rim of salt). It reminded me of my days spent in Cancun drinking the slow paced days away. \n\nService was great!!! If you order guacamole...they do a preparation show for you by cutting & scooping the avocados right in front of you. You can choose what ingredients & how much you'd like in your guacamole. Watch the servers go chop...chop...chop!!!\n\nI'm definitely coming back & looking forward to trying more dishes. I highly recommend this place. Oh & if you like Latin rock, I heard Shakira in the background during my dining experience. The hostess told us that there's live music on Monday evenings too.

Granted, our party of two came in at 10:15 but we called before coming in and they said they close at 11:00.  The hostess was absent and the bartenders (2 of them!) glared at us.  A party of 6 sat right before us freeing spots at the bar so my general feeling is. . .sit at the bar, smile, be nice and order quickly and all should be fair and good in the world, right?\n\nWrong.  I think our bartender rolled his eyes at us upwards of 4 times.  When we asked for suggestions, he knew nothing, he offered nothing.    Isn't it a bummer that I'm going on and on about eye rolling when I should be talking about how yummy the mole tamales were?  That's what sucks about bad service.  It manages to ruin everything.  \n\nWe asked for the bill as soon as the food was served because we were over having to deal with the servers.  My friend talked to the manager (a youngish girl with short hair who seemed more interested in hanging out with the servers eating than talking to us) and her excuse was that they were almost closed.  Duh.  We got that.  \n\nThough the food was terrific and my friend who recommended the restaurant warned me of inconsistency, we'll go to Lolo's next time where apparently the food AND the service allow you to enjoy the company of friends rather than talk about how you can't wait to yelp how bad the service is.

Scallops and steak done in a great mexian grill.  \nMost Mexian restaurants offer a side of quacamole with ridiculous amount served for a hefty price.  Usually I am not tempted.  But, when they make it in front of you, and you get to choose the spice level, I'm all for it.  Even at exorbitant prices, it's worth it. \nDrink enough of those margaritas with salt on the side, and all the food will taste amazing. If you are the designated driver or don't drink, you might not think so highly of the food. \nThe scallops I tried were phenomenal. I think they were actually part of the appetizer menu, but once I downed the hot guacamole, I didn't need it anymore. \nDownsides of Colibri- it is hard to get a table if you don't plan ahead. Especially on a saturday night. Even if you get a reservation, I've had to wait at the front for 15minutes after the reservation time.  Service is also hectic and I felt like we were forgotten for a while.  \nRead you bill carefully, they have also added extra drinks on there probably due to the hectic nature of the place, but annoying nonetheless. \nRight across the street from the Hilton- so expect lots of tourists. Overall the food is delicious and doesn't need to be slathered in oil and cheese to make it \"Mexican\".  The spices are great. 3 and 1/2 stars.", "author": "Kat T."}

It was Saturday night so I didn't expect to get a seat right away but I was blown away that they told me an hour and a half wait with all the empty tables I saw.  It's almost like they are asking business to turn around and walk back out the door.  There was a table in the bar area so we took it, probably a mistake because on a cold San Fransisco night it was too close to the front door which was being held open as other potential patrons heard the wait time, looked around, turned around and left.  I went to the bathroom and counted the empty tables of which they were lucky to be slightly over 50% capacity.  There must have been a reservation no show because the hostess came up to us after 15 minutes or so and said she had one table for two open (obviously in my mind i said \"not just one table honey\").  If it weren't for the hostess being so attentive I would have probably given this place 1 stars.  The one star would come from a pretty decent house margarita and the guacamole the waiter makes for you.\nI'm not sure if they are poorly managed or just understaffed but they need some help in this area.", "author": "Scott M."}

Overall, disappointed in our choice.\n\nSERVICE:\nOverall, poor.  Waiter tried to upsell more expensive brunch items and almost gave us a pitcher of sangria after we requested 2 glasses.  Overall unfriendly attitude from nearly everyone working there.\n\nFOOD:\nOrdered the guacamole appetizer (made at the table!) -- it was excellent.  Not the best I've ever had, but very tasty and a good amount.  It comes with small warm tortillas, not chips -- disappointing, but it's an \"upscale\" place so that's the trade-off.  Requested chips and received a small bowl of them -- for $5.  Sent it back because it was very stale.  Didn't receive another one, but at least they took it off the bill without being reminded.\n\nTamales Oaxaquena:  Disappointing.  Tasted very doughy, and the mole sauce overwhelmed what little flavor accompanied it.  The texture was awful.\n\nEnchiladas with chicken:  Tiny, with sweet sauce and tart cheese.  Layered with sour cream, which was an unexpected disappointment to an otherwise delightful entree.\n\nTortilla soup:  Unexceptional.  Supposedly came with chicken, but I counted only two small cubes.  Tasty soup, but not much in it!\n\nSangria:  Very good!  Sadly, the best part of our meal.\n\nNot recommended.

Then you dig into it with a chip and realize it is exactly as yummy as it looks! But that's not the best part. They bring \"hot off the grill\" housemade corn tortillas to eat with it.  You can make a meal of that alone although I always end up ordering more. I recommend the chile rellano and they also have excellent salads. The cocktails are creative and delicious.

Making Reservation/Atmosphere:\n  Made a reservation using the online reservation system \"Open Table\"  on Saturday 11/3 for a 4:30pm dinner on Sunday 11/4 .  The tables had a pretty quick turn over rate to make the restaurant feel busy but not crowded.  This restaurant is small in square footage leaving each table with a chair on one side and just enough space to squeeze sideways into your booth seat on the opposing side. \n2. Service:\n  Server was able to find out if a dish was gluten/dairy free. He was polite but not personal or congenial and he also brought us the wrong bill at the end of our meal.    \n3.  Food:  \n     A.  \"Camarones en Mole de Tamarindo\" $17:  The taste was flavorful and pleasing.  Unfortunately there were only 5 breaded shrimp and a corn muffin on this platter.  Don't order this entree without a side dish if you are hungry.     \n     B.  \"Chamorro de Cordero\" $22:  The mole sauce was hearty and flavorful while the lamb melted right off the bone. The lamb was placed on top of a banana leaf and was the only item on this platter to my disappointment but it was big enough to satiate my appetite (which is not demure and not huge but healthy).  Make sure to order a side dish along with your entree if you want flavor variation and or a more nutritious meal. The server did not suggest a side dish. I was told this dish was gluten/ dairy free. I believe this to be true because right after eating I was able to comfortably sit through a showing of the \"Lion King\"(about 2.5 hrs long) without feeling any stomach irritation.  \n4.  Price:\n     Don't expect to get the best bang for your buck here.  It is in a convenient location to places like Union Square and the near by Orpheum Theater so meal prices are jacked up.", "author": "Karen Lynne M."}

We got the ceviche which was okay--it didn't elicit the \"aaahhh, refreshing!\" response I expect from fresh seafood and citrus because some of the fish pieces had a styrofoam-like texture.  For entrees, we ordered the chicken mole and the duck with the pumpkin seed sauce.  The mole sauce was lush, rich, and quintessentially mole-like in a perfect way, but the chicken itself was definitely underseasoned, which was a shame because the dish could've been a winner.  The duck included both the breast meat seared medium and the leg as a confit.  While the leg meat was good, the breast was a minor disaster.  The sliced meat looked dry (and was dry), as if the dish sat on the pass for a long time waiting to be taken to the table, and the skin wasn't rendered enough and had a rubbery texture.  While the prospect of a pumpkin seed sauce was enticing, in practice, it didn't have the richness or the toasty flavor I had hoped for.\n\nAt the suggestion of our server, we also ordered a side dish of potato gratin infused with poblano chiles.  This was a winner.  It sounded like it could potentially be a pedestrian fusion experiment, like an item at TGI Fridays, but the poblano flavor really came through all the cream and the cheese.  Just make sure to avert your eyes after you eat all of it because the pool of grease at the bottom is disheartening....if \"disheartening\" also means your heart is on the verge of malfunction due to arterial blockage.  Similarly at the suggestion of the server, we split the crepes with cajeta and ice cream.  This, too, was something that I enjoyed because I am a huge fan of dulce de leche/cajeta (I don't know enough about Mexican cuisine to know the difference, but I love them both!).  The longer the crepes sat, the more it became one with the cajeta, creating this eggy-caramely mush.  It's a mush, yes, but a noble one.  Honestly, I really wanted to ask for the handmade tortillas to sop up the cajeta, but that would've gone straight to my caboose and  I would not be able to make a graceful exit to redeem myself.", "author": "maiko h."}

Sadly, my little hole-in-the-wall became very popular, very quickly and it became a little difficult even for me to get a table (damn you ALL!). I've put off doing a review, hoping not to add to the celebration of the place, hoping that the crowds would die down, but that's clearly not going to happen any time soon, so, here it goes.\r\nI lived in Mexico City for two years and with Mexicans from all parts of the country for 9+ and from my hate-ridden experiences with Mexican cuisine I learned to expect overly done meats, roughly boiled beans, nausea-inducing corn tortillas and zero depth of flavor all topped by raw onion, raw cilantro, pickled green chiles and the ubiquitous lime and salt; truly heinous. Colibri, however, taught me that Mexican food can not only be good, but can be some of the best, most interesting food that I've tasted. All of the menu is good, but highlights include the Halibut, the Potatos au Gratin, the Stuffed Chicken and the Zucchini. Oh, yeah, and the tortillas... soo good.\r\nI've heard the criticism that the portions are small, but that I really don't understand. I'm a big eater and I've always left stuffed. Just keep asking for more tortillas to sop up those delicious sauces. All in all Colibri is one of my favorite casual places to eat in the city so far.\r\n\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nEdited 12Oct\r\n\r\nColibri used to offer a discount to employees of my company. Yesterday I was told \"no mas\". I certainly do not expect a discount every time that I go out, but why offer it for so long and then take it away? Yes, y'all are a popular business now, but please don't spit in the face of guests who dined with you when you were an upstart. Minus 1 star for avarice.", "author": "Daniel W."}

The guacamole was beyond the beyonds, and they serve it with an endless supply of soft round tortillas, tucked into a cloth pouch to keep them toasty warm throughout your meal. The fish of the day and the chicken were wonderfully tender and came with delicious vegatables in creamy, slightly spicy sauces - just talking about it makes me want to eat it again!  The place is very pretty, if a bit loud.  Don't be fooled by the \"tapas\" instruction the waiter will give you - we ordered one appi (the guac, of course), two \"medium\" plates and two sides and we were swimming in food.

I knew that my time was limited in this town so I was hoping to enjoy a culinary moment that would stay with me for years to come.  After all, who knows when I would ever return?  I did my due diligence and saw an interesting pattern developing around Colibri Mexican Bistro on various websites. Could all of these reviews be true?  Impossible, I thought.  At approximately 7pm I endeavored to make the short walk from my downtown hotel to taste and see if the reviews of Calibri were credible.\n\n     The restaurant was busy with a cultural plethora of happy customers basking in the old world Latin charm that colored the dining room,  as a contemporary,  Latin duo massaged the air with their soothing, soulful tunes.  Clearly, the only remedy for my skepticism would be a margarita.  So I bellied up to the bar and asked the bartender to mix me the margarita he would drink if he were opposite himself at that moment.  His flair was only eclipsed by his gracious pour.  \"Salt?\" he asked.  \"Of course.\" A subtle, yet sturdy concoction awaited my lips.  From the moment my tongue felt the bitter sting preceding her sour, then sweet charm, she had my attention.  She was indeed magnificent.  By the time I ordered my second dose of bliss, I nearly forgot about dinner.  I wasn't really hungry, but the Mole Poblano had garnered such rave reviews that I felt a bit more than compelled to order it, though I had no f*&king idea what it was.  Within fifteen minutes I would have the chance to find out.\n\n     The bartender laid out a stack of small corn tortillas along with three different sauces.  Was this what I ordered?  I should just be patient to see if there would be a main act to this side show.  Soon he presented a plate of chicken drenched in a dark brown sauce.   My knife cut through the tender pile of white meat like a mermaids fin slices through the ocean on her journey to Neptune to spawn.  Her magical, fiery flavors seduced me into submission.  I would kill to taste her again; for once I was convicted and sentenced to death, she would be the last meal I requested.  I felt like I was having an affair.  I couldn't even look up.  Was it even appropriate to feel this good in such a public place?  I was embarrassed, but like a shamed addict, I had to inject another bite into my system.  \"I love you,\" I whispered, as the bartender knowingly glanced my way, as if to say, \"now you know.\"", "author": "Gregory G."}

Reservations are recommended but if a casual walk in is more your style, plan on dinning early or planting your behind at the tequila bar for a cocktail or two. Colibri also possesses a delightfully warm atmosphere adorned with dark stained high-backed booths, a glistening mahogany bar, gold-rust sponged walls, and splashes of bright colors and trinkets that remind me so much of Mexico City. I usually begin my experience at this venue by indulging in a traditional margarita made with one of the many unique tequilas followed by a sweeter strawberry or blackberry margarita, yum!! I have indulged just about every entre item but there are a few favorites I must share, so here goes!\n\nAntojitos:\n     Fresh made guacamole made right at your table is the only entre I choose to indulge in due to my desire to pamper my stomach with a three course meal. Customers are allowed to choose the level of spice but be careful; I once requested to have my socks knocked off spicy and the chef bounced back from the kitchen with two haba\u00f1eros which lit up my mouth. Stick to simply \"spicy\" made with the tamer Jalape\u00f1o chili and you will surely be pleased! Served alongside fresh hand made tortillas and three unique salsas, your taste buds are guaranteed to be tantalized!\n\nEspecialidades:\n     Fire roasted Poblano chile stuffed with vegetables and cheese served over a rich black bean sauce; fabulous!! This is a unique Chile Relleno due to the fact that it is neither fried nor breaded but rather fire roasted with a strong thriving chile flavor. Stuffed with perfectly cooked veggies and just the right amount of cheese, this dish was made to please rather than clog those arteries!\n Filet Mignon served alongside an Ancho chile stuffed with goat cheese all atop smashed potatoes with saut\u00e9ed spinach and chipotle sauce. This dish is the perfect mixture of sweet and salty that simply makes my mouth water; you can't go wrong with this plate! The saltiness of the filet and goat cheese pair perfectly with the savory smashed potatoes and the slight sweet flavor obtained by the Ancho chile.\n Pechuga Rellena de Huitlacoche; for those who don't speak a lick of Spanish this is Chicken breast stuffed with a mix of huitlacoche (sort of a corn pure if you will), zucchini, and fresh corn atop a roasted garlic sauce. This plate is so savory you will have to resist the urge to lick your plate clean! The rich dark chicken meat pairs perfectly with the savory veggies and the mouth watering garlic sauce; if you love chicken you will drool in your sleep over the immaculate flavors possessed within this dish. \n Mole Poblano, a legendary Mexican favorite made from a blend of spices, chiles, nuts, and chocolate magically transformed into a rich and flavorful sauce served in the traditional Puebla style over chicken. There are so many flavors that burst throughout your mouth with this plate; this is a pleasant blend of sweet and savory. This is one of the better Mole sauces I have ever tasted. I feel as if I should be in a warm Mexican home when I indulge in this delightful dish. \n\nPostres:\n     If you have an inch of room left in your stomach after indulging in a fabulous dinner, you have to order the traditional Churros Rellenos filled with Cajeta caramel cream, served with Dulce de Leche ice cream. How often does one get to indulge in Churros anymore?! The Churros alone are the perfect blend of crunchy and sweet, but the caramel sauce sends these over the edge delightful! Yuuuuuummmy!!!\n\nColibri Mexican Bistro is an amazing experience for any patron seeking fabulous traditional Mexican favorites. My only complaint in regards to this venue is the rather lagging wait staff and the length of time it takes to receive drinks and dinner courses. It should not take twenty minutes to get a specialty cocktail on a slow early Tuesday dinner, especially when there are two bartenders behind the counter chatting each other up. However, the food at this venue is absolutely fabulous and thus I am willing to slightly overlook the staff problem. I think the pricing is pretty reasonable; a three course meal for two with at least one drink per person should drop you about a bill. Overall this is a fabulous restaurant and one of the few traditional higher-end Mexican Bistros I have found in the city, try it out!", "author": "Bri C."}

We found out later it was the crowd from the surrounding theaters.  I really didn't want to go in because there were no seats available at the bar and no backs on the bar stools (this seems to be a common theme in San Fran for some reason).  In addition, I really didn't want mexican food.  I was hoping for something a bit more upscale.  We walked for about an hour just checking out the area at night.  We come to the city a lot, but like to really experience all the restaurants and areas.  We ended up back at Colibri, which my hubby really wanted to do in the first place.  The bar was then emptied out.  I really wanted a martini and was kind of scared to ask for one at a mexican place.  Turns out our bartender was amazing.  He could whip up any concoction I requested to perfection.  He also recommended several dishes for us to try.  They food was really amazing too.

Mighty ballsy indeed. They do give some soft warm tortillas with the order at no extra charge. It's so not the same. That being said, the guacamole was amazing. I like the guac at Maya just a little better but they are both pretty tasty. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so tender juicy with a lovely taste. Small portion (probably a size I should be eating regularly, but I like to have some left over to take home) and the prices were pretty steep I feel for what you got.

There are a lot of other restaurants in the city, they should really consider talking to their servers as this will not get them repeat customers. P.S.

They were very accomodating of our large party, especially when we added one more at the last minute.  The sangria was delicious!  Guacamole was fresh and very good, but they serve it in this big stone pot/dish that is shallower than it seems...a little deceiving/disappointing when you realize you've almost finished the guacamole, haha.  I had the duck breast in green mole sauce, because I'll usually order duck if it's on a menu and wanted to try mole.  The duck was cooked well and the mole sauce was tasty, but I don't know enough about authentic Mexican food to really judge.  Portion sizes are definitely on the smaller side considering the price...most dishes seemed to only have a few vegetables to complement the proteins.  Perfect for smaller people like me, but those with larger appetites should order side dishes as well.

We are all going to be Net Flixing THAT asap. Minus one star because the 'spicy' guacamole was not so spicy, and you have to purchase your sides separately - I'm not asking for gigantic portions, it is just a little sad to have to throw down an extra $7 to have some beans with your entree.

Anyways, there was 5 in our party and they sat us at an awkwardly deep table that made it hard to share the shareable tapas-style appetizers and extremely hard to have any sort of conversation with the person seated acrossed from you.\n     Our waiter mumbled and wouldn't look anyone in the eye and seemed to be really annoyed with us for not knowing what we wanted within 3 minutes of sitting down.  But at least they were fast with the drink orders.  And did I mention the band?  This place isn't large and it was quite full of people both at tables and at the bar.  It's all tile and mirrors, so the sound bounces - but they had a live salsa band playing (plugged in) and we had the happy accident of being sat right in front of the band which made impossible to hear even the person sitting next to you except at breaks between songs.  Honestly, the music was nice but they reaaally didn't need amplification.  They even played a request for our friend at dinner.  \n     As for the food, I have to say I was surprised at the heartiness of the menu.  We got tableside guacamole, which was good but a little awkward to eat with the soft mini tortillas they give you to eat it with (no chips!)  Definitely not a \"traditional\" Mexican place.  I ordered lamb shanks steamed in a banana leaf.  Really tender, flavorful meat with a good sized portion.  Others at the table ordered ranchero chicken and they said it was delish.  Didn't stay for dessert (we longed for a quiet cup of decaf and a giant slice of cake).  \n\nI won't go back, but it's not just because I was miffed at the noise level and so-so service - it's just not the kind of Mexican restaurant that I like.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-04-16", "description": "I once read a rant by the ever entertaining Tim Goodman, of Chronicle fame, talking about the little man sitting up. He felt the little man sitting up was actually very mis-leading, because you can't tell what he is thinking at all. At least with the little man sleeping or the little man clapping, you have a good clue as to how he's feeling.\nThat is how I feel about the 3 star review. You're not really sure, did they like it, did they not like it... who knows? I myself am not exactly sure how I felt about my Colibri experience, so I feel a 3 star review here is appropriate. Perhaps after you read my review you can tell me how I felt?\n\nThe evening was already shrouded because I was there with a group of friends for my birthday. Whenever you go anywhere to celebrate an occasion in which your center of attention, your judgment is automatically going to be impaired. When we arrived, the table was ready, guacamole already waiting. I was hoping they would make it table side, but for such a large group I can see why they prepared in advance. The Guac? Well it was GOOOOD! You could tell it was freshly made, all the right amounts of cilantro, tomatoes, onions... the guac alone gets 5 stars. Next the drinks - no pitchers of margaritas. WTF you say? Absolutely, WTF. What Mexican restaurant doesn't offer pitchers? Especially for large groups?! A Mexican restaurant that wants to charge you $10 for a HOUSE margarita, that's who. So no pitchers and $10 house margarita = EXPENSIVE bar tab; 1 star.  Since we were a large group, we had to have one of those prix fixe menus with the 3 courses basically chosen for you. Caesar salads were good, nice home made dressing (i think), good size portion, a bit better than a normal Caesar; 4 stars. Then the entrees: our choices were filet mignon, carnitas, and shrimp. No one got shrimp (shocker). Having heard the carnitas were the specialty, I went with the pig instead of the cow. Now I'm not exactly sure how they prepare the carnitas, but they certainly weren't fried, and they were dry as can be. Perhaps this is their version of \"healthy\" carnitas (lord knows I don't need all of that extra lard thrown in) but still, when you order carnitas you expect crispy flavorness on the outside and juicy ternderness on the inside. That's certainly not what we got; 2 stars. For the desserts, I'll just say this. Have you ever tasted lumpy flan? If you haven't and you would like to, make a trip to Colibri and order the flan. That is exactly what you'll get, lumpy flan; 1star. \n\nService was good. She was on top of the drinks, refilling the waters, food came quickly, etc... 4 stars. So lets see, you add up all the stars that gets you 17 stars. Divide by the # of categories (6 in total) that gets you to 2.833333.... 3 stars in short. Now after all of that, I think the 3 star rating is pretty appropriate. Yet its still sends the ambiguous message of, did she like, did she not... do you think I liked it?", "author": "Lisa W."}

The experience was pretty underwhelming. I thought the food was really bland and totally overpriced. The Mezcalita drink I ordered barely had any alcohol in it. The quesadilla appetizer was three* very* small pieces, barely enough for one person to munch on (and it cost something like ~$10) I thought their famous quacamole was flavorless and forgettable. The service was poor. It took over 20 minutes just to get some water on the table once we were seated. We never even received the side order of rice and beans that we ordered.

I don't know why I had never noticed this place before, I was looking for a \"Latin\" place to eat before opening night of In the Heights at the Curran and was shocked to find this place right across the street. The food here was top notch! We started with the guacamole which was made fresh for us and served with fresh tortillas, the guacamole was so good! It tasted super fresh and had a nice balance of flavors from the avocado and onion. We then shared the catch of the day which was a pecan crusted ahi tuna served with delicious mashed potatoes and vegetables. We also split the shrimp with mole sauce and a corn cake which was my favorite of the meal. I love mexican corn cake and the mole sauce was incredible. The shrimp were meaty and went perfectly with the mole sauce. My only complaint was that the portions here are a bit small. We ended with the dark chocolate mousse with fleur de sel. A winner.

She was Costa Rican with great cheeks, front and back.\n\nUpon entering Colibri, the wait staff notified us that it would be a few minutes for our table.  Before I could count the number of different tequilas on the top shelf, we were seated.  They could obviously tell I was on a mission and needed to get my date drunk quickly.  Glad they were on the same page as me that night.\n\nThe interior felt like an old Mexican saloon - warm, dark, and simple yet exotic.  Just the right mixture to put my date in a sexy mood.  I'm soooo getting laid after dinner!\n\nAs we scanned the menu - who really reads a Mexican menu in detail?!  Come on people, it's friggin tortillas, guacamole, grilled chicken, pico de gallo, and rice!  It's always the same ingredients - just changes names depending on how the tortilla interfaces with the rest of the food.  Fill it yourself?  Fajita!  Wrap it only part way?  Taco!  Wrapped like a camper in a sleeping bag?  Burrito!!\n\nLike I was saying, as we scanned the menu, I began thinking they had accidentally given us menus from the restaurant next door.  What Mexican restaurant serves filet mignon but doesn't offer chips and salsa to appetize the palate?!  When they brought our plates, I thought for sure my eyes were going bad once and for all.  I've seen kids in TJ selling Chiclets bigger than my dainty filet.  Way overpriced and undersized!!  But it was ok this night, because I was getting laid!\n\nSeveral drinks in, we started talking dirty to each other.  Ever notice how the more you drink the louder you talk?  Neither did we until couples from around the corner started looking over their shoulders at us.  Apparently I wasn't the only guy in there realizing that this date was definitely going to end up between the sheets.\n\nWe had such a great time there.  And our waitress was hot too.  She didn't know it but \"Camelle\" was my backup plan if this date didn't work out in my favor.  Hang in there babe, I'll be back for you one of these days.\n\nOverall it was a good experience, but the food was average and the prices were HIGH!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-04-14", "description": "We decided to go to Colibri because it boasted central Mexican food, which is rather unusual in California. \nThe menu looked inspired - interesting choices: pipian, pozole verde. \nWe ordered the guacamole, which was superb. But then, they gave us handmade tortillas. Now, I give them 2 stars for the effort, but wow, these were some of the worst tortillas I've eaten. 1. The dough was dry, which was apparent from the cracks at the edges (tortillas have to have a smooth rim). 2. They were under-cooked, meaning they were not cooked properly so that there is a visible inside and outer sides and it was doughy inside. Whoever made them did not know that you have to let them poof up (as per other flat breads: naans, chapati) and they were heavy, rather than light. All tortillas poof up. \nThen there was the seasoning. I am not talking spicy, I'm talking taste. When I am eating a 25 dollar entr\u00e9e (counting the rice), I want it to have flavors (yes, not one, but many).  Colibri simply did not deliver. The duck in pipian was weak. The pozole even weaker. The carnitas were good, but basically a pork confit will always be good. The sopes: the dough, again undercooked. The toppings were bland. No contrast. \nAnd then there was the salsas. It is absolutely a mystery to me, why, with the range that salsas have, Colibri had only 1. Yes. We asked for a salsa, and the offered us Tapatio. I was floored. I am sorry? Did you just offer me Tapatio in this gourmet Mex restaurant?  \nFinally: the service. Our waitress could barely pronounce the dishes, knew little about Mexican food, and although we came in during the middle of lunch and dinner, was not as attentive as we would expect for an almost empty establishment.  Would a \"gourmet\" restaurant that is $$$$ not have knowledgeable servers?\nWhat I felt like, was more a lack of pride in the food, boastful of quality (and price), but not of taste. \nI came home and made myself some good handmade tortillas, just to remind me that they are not that hard to make. \nOne good thing: the micheladas with Dos Equis Amber.", "author": "Miriam L."}

But please make reservations, it is small and I would say gets packed on the weekends and after work hours. Over all awesome bar, high reviews for the guacamole! Buen Provecho.", "author": "Eli R."}

I made the suggestion to some friends who wanted Mexican and close in proximity to celebrate a birthday, so I felt a little bit of pressure from the start.  The hostess was very rude right off the bat and not presented in a manner I thought appropriate for the position she is in.  We ended up waiting almost a 1/2 hour after our reservation time to be seated.  We then waited almost 15 minutes to order.  Our server was very friendly and even brought out dessert and sang Happy Birthday to our birthday girl.  I did leave the place feeling a little embarrassed to have suggested it but I know the service is usually much better.", "author": "Rise G."}

And more often than not, \"fancy\" Mexican restaurants are usually disappointing.   But this place is actually really good (a bit high end as far as Mexican food goes).  But don't be fooled, this is not your typical Mexican restaurant  (with a free bowl of chips/salsa and tacos/burritos on the menu) - it's more gourmet. On weekends it will get super crowded and noisy especially in the bar area where it's a popular hangout for the younger crowd. So for a more quiet dinner reserve a booth in back around the Kitchen (it's not as loud). Also expect to spend over $100 for two if you're having drinks and appetizers - it's not inexpensive.  Ambiance is upbeat, service is usually great. Margaritas are awesome.   Fun place.", "author": "M D."}

The food was refined, well-seasoned, carefully prepared, etc.  It was great to have an upscale Mexican restaurant option in the City.  My recent visit on 7/4/09 was disappointing.  I'm willing to pay for a good drink, but a $10 house margarita?  I know they use good tequila, it was a shame I couldn't taste it.  Just sugar and lime juice.  I ordered the Pato en Pipian,  (duck in pumpkin seed chile sauce).  The duck breast was unevenly cooked.  Instead of a nice, rosy center, it was raw and chewy on the inside and cooked on the outside.  The rice was alright, but nothing special.  The queso fundido with chorizo was alright, but I've had better cheese and chorizo.  With options like Nopalito available now, I don't see any reason to go back and pay a lot more money for substandard mexican food.", "author": "Anthony C."}

It was savory fatty goodness meeting tart, sweet, spiciness. That was perfectly complemented by their smokey (vegetarian?) estofado of zucchini, corn, bean, and at least two kinds of chilies.

After much debate, I ordered \"Camarones en Mole de Tamarindo\" which was the \"saut\u00e9ed prawns in tamarind mole served with a savory corn cake\" and it looks like I hit a home run. The tamarind mole was really YUMMY! It reminded of a sauce that I was familiar with... but I couldn't really put a finger on it until my sister tried it and said it tasted like the marinade that is used for Korean fried chicken wings!

Everyone else said their dishes weren't anything special... I tried my sister's lamb and wasn't very impressed (then again, I don't like lamb...) But my dish was YUUUUUMAY! I love prawns.

The food has been consistently delicious and the margaritas have been phenomenal.  The Nopales and Carnitas are so yummy!  Fresh salsa and tortillas?  Hit the spot. \nDon't know what tequilla to choose?  Ask the bartender and tell them what flavors you like.  I lean toward lighter, citrusy flavors while the boyfriend enjoys flavors like smoke.  We used this technique the last time we went and bartender Adrian did not disappoint!  If he's working, ask for him to make your margarita.  \nAfter allowing us to smell the tequillas he was considering, he blended boyfriend's tequilla with orange to bring out the smokiness and he NAILED the floral/citrus flavors that I was looking for.  He even insisted that we taste the tequillas first on their own to know what they taste like without the fresh juices in the margarita.  It's hard to find someone so knowledgeable and who takes the time to ensure his guests are more than satisfied.  He definitely knows what he's doing!", "author": "Meredith S."}

I'll average to three.\n\nI have been to Colibri in the past with friends for dinner and really enjoyed the interesting dishes on the menu (a sort of French twist to traditional Mexican flavors and spices).  I thought about coming back with my family, but put it off since it was a little pricey, and I wasn't too sure how they would like it.  Anyway, I saw it on Bloomspot some time ago, and decided to get the coupon and bring my family.  I was under the impression that the coupon expired on June 30, 2011.  It was my sister's birthday today, so I bought it thinking that I would be able to use it.  Anyway, being under that impression, I did not check the coupon until today when I realized that it actually had already expired three plus weeks before.  I checked the Bloomspot site and it states that if the coupon has expired, I would be able to use the coupon for the amount paid for the coupon.\n\nWhen the time came for the bill, the waiter took the coupon, and came back to tell me that the coupon could not be honored because it had expired.  He went and talked to the manager, who said that she would honor the coupon for me, but that they no longer work with Bloomspot, and they generally do not accept the coupons any more.  She also continued to tell me that she would get in trouble later from her boss and made me feel bad for missing the expiration date.  I, thinking she's let me use the Bloomspot coupon as if it had not expired, apologized once again, and took the check for the remainder of the balance.  When I opened up the check, I saw that she had only docked the amount I paid for the coupon that I was telling her was owed to me, as per Bloomspot policy.  I felt like I was all of a sudden in an awkward position where I could not say anything more to the manager, who had already left the table anyway, or be satisfied with the service that was provided to me.  I am NOT happy with the restaurant's resolution to the problem or the way they made me feel guilty for making a mistake. I was honest from the beginning about the coupon, but they seemed to either not know about the policy, or were trying not to accept it for even face value.  Either way, it was a horrible experience.", "author": "P S."}

Firstly, the guac is good not great but I only say that because I make the best guac in the world.  Seriously.  I'm not a chef or anything and I'm not one to toot my own horn about these kinds of things but it's just kind of a known fact that my guac cannot be beat, worldwide.  So, given those circumstances, their guac was just ok.  Their fresh warm slash hot tortillas, however, were delicious and a lovely alternative to the greasy fried tortilla chips served everywhere else.  They are really filling though so keep that in mind if you're ordering main courses.  \nThe highlight of the visit was the jalapeno margarita the bf ordered.  The bartender sliced up a fresh jalapeno, laid it on a plate, covered it in Bacardi 151 and lit it on fire--but in an understated, Mexican bistro sort of way--not a Cancun hit you on the head and pour tequila down your throat sort of way.  Anyway, he let it burn for around 10 minutes then muddled it all up into a margarita.  De. Lish. Us.  For real.  Wasn't expecting that at all.  This was around 3 weeks ago and I haven't stopped craving another. \nCan't comment on the main courses or anything else on the menu but for a quick app and an unusual, delicious, unusually delicious cocktail and some good guac with great tortillas, I definitely recommend Colibri.", "author": "BJ F."}

Very nicely prepared traditional Mexican dishes. Although they still don't touch Dona Tomas, the carnitas are not to be missed. The freshly prepared guacamole served with delicious petite fresh corn tortillas is some of the best I have had anywhere. They do a nice job with chicken and fish as well.

The shrimps were not large and were literally drowning in a dark brown, bland mole sauce.  The corn muffin was the tastiest thing on the plate.  The potatoes gratin were quite good.

It was still a $60-something dollar bill.  When we were done with food, the waitress asked if we wanted another round of drinks.  The margaritas were yummy, so we said yes.  She brings us our drinks and the bill, which we paid.  Five minutes later, another waitress/hostess comes up and tells us they need this table for a large party that has reservations.  At this point around 7pm, the place is really crowded.  She tells us that they don't have another table to move us to and the bar is full, but she still wants us to give up our seats.  I was shocked.  Really?  That's how you treat your customers?  Then she informed us that since we didn't have reservations, somebody should have informed us that we will need to give up the table by 7pm.  I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant.

I was not very impressed with their tres leches cake however, which was extra dry and not a bit moist. The flan is their best dessert.

Although I'll never find the Tex-Mex I long for here in San Francisco, I'll take Colibri as the next best thing.  Their tapas style dishes are to die for. In fact, I had Colibri for the first time on a Wednesday.  The very next week I had to go back for more. Their margaritta's are smooth yet strong.  And I love how they give tortillas instead of chips to munch on prior to dinner.  The only drawback is that it's across from the ACT and therefore always crowded. Get there early or eat at the bar.", "author": "Kelly M."}

I loved the atmosphere and the service started out great. The ceveche was outstanding, I am picky and it was truly fresh  and very flavorful. The strawberry margarita on the other hand (the most important part, just kidding but not really )was just OK. a bit too sweet and not very strong. We asked for the drink menu in the middle of our meal, we were planning to order another round but the server never returned and when he finally did he brought us the desert menu and the check. A bit disappointing because I did want to try a different drink, we felt like he wanted us out so we left. I am still drooling from the table next to us who ordered the chorizo and cheese. Dam I should have ordered that too, it looked sooooo gooood.Next time I will just sit at the bar. - 2 stars just for service and my margarita.", "author": "Dee D."}

Move to main entree and they all are really good. But, I have a special weakness towards mole poblano, meat is tender and they add just the right amount of chocolate.  Unlike other places, Colibri  mastered the art of residing at that delicate brink of being savory and sweet. Finally you will have to have the special margaritas except the blackberry margarita. That is the only disappointing order I made in my 5 visits to this place.  It might make your wallet feel bit lighter but  you perhaps would not feel it  after enjoying the vibe, drinks and great quality food!", "author": "Kingshuk g."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-10-27", "description": "It's no secret that lots of folks love Mexican foods - I guarantee you can always name someone you know who love mexican foods and would rather go to a mexican place, than other places (they have a \"thang\" for it, if you know what I mean). Sadly, the love it seems has outgrown the sensibility in dining at one. The raving reviews of Colibri is one great example. \n\nThe facts:\n- $10 Guac, prep tableside - with 1.5 avos, chopped onions, tomatoes, cilantro, j'penos and TABLESALT (yep, the harsh tasting, Denny's pairing, throat thirsting, Table Salt). Tableside prep. is a gimmick for a bland tasting Guac. and that just doesn't justify a 10dollarbill. They can do better than that.\n- $12.50 margaritas - This place ain't Gramercy Tavern - nor is it close to a Manhattan cocktail spot or San Francisco for that matter. They must've knew most over 21 would not go to a mex place w/out sippin 'ritas - Ca-ching!\n- $14 Carnitas. 6 chunky pork nuggets on a plate. I like the simplicity of  it, but there' nothing to brag about. Tender from hrs of braising, and nicely caramel colored outside, possibly from a quick dunk at the fryer\n- $18 Chicken stuffed mushroom w/ crema sauce (daily special). Taste good, but it's nothing mexican/ latin - and anyone who have had a decent al fredo sauce can nod their head when they taste this dish. $18 for a chicken entree on small plate?\n- $7 Tres leches cake - it is what it is. Whether you get it at safeway or a mexican panaderia in downtown san jose, this one is no difference.\n-$7 Coffee Flan w/ tequila. If only I had a camera to show it here. The edges of this flan looks as if the cooks (i doubt they have pastry chef back there - although the price suggest they're at par w/ Boulevard, Citizen cake and the like) had been having fun with his pairing-knife to get the flan out of its tinfoil mold. It's wet and soggy, on the sweeter side - which is ok. Then they put a flower-shaped carved strawberry on the side for that 80s presentation look.\n\nIt is with deep regret I must say this place lacks compassion of true latin cooking, and they priced their menus way over their game. Sure you have to make bottomline and SF ain't cheap place - but the City is full of other places with open doors, decent drinks and better fare. Total bill came to $92 before tip - for dinner for two (1 appy, 2 ritas, 2 ents and 2 desserts). This would be a 3stars, but the tab just knock off a notch in your stomach. Our waitstaff is very sincere the whole time and it appears his colleagues are too from our observation on a busy friday night.", "author": "Billy J."}

I could have a great meal here with the fresh, thick and fragrant corn tortillas alone. It takes mexican cuisine seriously, as it should be (it's the best cuisine on planet earth after all!) You can order almost anything and it will be off-the charts fresh and bursting with flavor. Their salsas and guacamoles are sooo good. They have an extensive tequila collection, and an interesting and unique cocktail menu. The last time I went they were playing an old black and white lucha libre movie.

Unfortunately, my return trip with husband and 8 year old twins was quite disappointing. The hostess was unfriendly, and seated us  in a far corner telling us we needed to finish within an hour and a half because the table was reserved. (we didn't have reservations, but it was only 5 pm) Our server was not particularly helpful either, when we asked if there were any vegetarian entrees for our daughters. I ended up ordering the shrimp for one daughter after he assured me it wasn't spicy. It WAS spicy when it arrived, and she couldn't eat it. \n     Then a table for 10 was seated next to us, and our server totally ignored us after that, leaving us waiting to have dishes cleared, waiting 15 minutes for a dessert menu, etc. while he gave all his attention to the larger table, obviously hoping for a large tip from them and figuring we were not worth as much of his time.\n     I'd only give this place one star, but the tortillas and guacamole were excellent. The entrees we ordered-chicken, shrimp in mole sauce, and caesar salad were mediocre at best. The caesar had a mayonnaise-y dressing and what looked like pepperidge farm croutons.

We waited for almost an hour to be served, then had to wolf down our meals because we had theatre tickets.   I had ordered the chili relleno, which was so hot (seeds had not been removed) that it was inedible.  I tried two bites, but was unable to eat any more than that.  So it was sent back, and an appetizer was ordered instead.  when the bill came i was surprised to see that I had been charged for both items, and when I spoke to the person in charge, she said that I had eaten too much of it and that is why i was charged.  Not only was the service horrible, but her attitude left much to be desired.  I have never had this experience; when an item is sent back because it is inedible, I have never been charged.

The waiter, who I have had before, was on point as always. We obviously started with the guacamole....Mole! Mole! :) My mother got the Hawaiian fish (special) which was buttery and melted in your mouth. My father and I, the Filet, which bursts wonderful flavors in  your mouth even 30 minutes after the meal. This is a Mexican BISTRO people....don't expect burritos and tortilla chips.

Come on.  That's almost a crime. I would never take my family there because it's an insult to our intelligence.  Too bad for that because the flavors were really great.  I even loved the guacamole which was so good, I overlooked the  fact that they were making it in a molcajete with a plastic bowl liner.  I don't want dramatics, I want good food.  Oh yeah, and the ambiance was very nice too.  So maybe they have high rent in Union Square.
