{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-09", "description": "Sometimes you hear so much about a place that you finally give in and be like \"What the heck, time to give this place a shot!\" So you go out your way even going to \"The City\" early to partake in what seems..(according to reviews) really good \"Chinese Food\" in North Beach. Was the result a great experience at the end of the day? Could I have gone elsewhere and had \"Chinese Food\"? Well let me yelp about it for a minute. Here is my review of Elaine's Chinese Cuisine.\n\n6/21/16\nI was feeling pretty good this day. It was sunny out and sporting my \"SI Yankees\" jersey not only in celebration of the MiLB victory but, MLB \"NY Yankees\" victory. Like as usual, I was hungry. And everyone knowing me..\"I love Chinese Food\" So with that being on my mind and Elaine's being in my site, I was ready to eat and see what the fuss was about..plus I need food on my stomach if I'm having a few drinks.\n\nService 3/5\nCleanliness 3/5\nFood 3/5\n\nFood/Service:\nSo I enter the restaurant and some of the staff are watching TV instead of maybe..cleaning tables, tending to hungry customers (me). It took a few minutes (Really) for a worker to see me from the kitchen and then came to take my order. So on this visit I decided to scan the menu. I of course was a bit late for lunch time so I had to order a la carte. After deciding on what I wanted, I ordered. Sesame Chicken ($7.95) and Shrimp Chow Main ($6.95). After about fifteen minuets, my to go order was placed and I took my food with me to eat at my favorite bar.\n\nSesame Chicken - It was the better of the two selected dishes. It was crispy, had a nice almost citrusy sauce. It was mild, and had a nice little ginger note to it that rounded off the chicken well. This is something I would order again. One of the better Sesame Chicken dishes I've had in a while. I would give this 5 stars alone really.\n\nShrimp Chow Main - This was a huge let down. The whole togo container had 5 shrimp in it. And the shrimp was the only really flavorful component in this dish. The noodles had zero flavor, the veggies had no flavor nor that nice snap that veggies seem to still have in good chinese food side dishes. This was very disappointing and will \"Not\" be ordered again by me.\n\nWill I go back?\n\nSure, I like to give \"Chinese Food\" places another chance. Considering it's my \"Favorite\" food. And this place is in my favorite area of SF.\n\nIn Conclusion, I may not have had the best total first impression, but 1 out of 2 isn't to bad of odds to count this place out. It sits on Broadway in a heavily trafficked area where they are bound to have consistant business. As always if you visit, \"Yelp\" your own experience!", "author": "Tre S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-24", "description": "I usually go for City Chopsticks when I get Chinese take-out, but I find their food to be pretty bland so I gave Elaine's Kitchen a try. I ordered: spring rolls, chicken fried rice, and Mongolian beef. \n\nThe chicken fried rice was overall awful and I wouldn't get it again. It looked like just white rice with some soy sauce and chicken added to it. I can't even confidently say it was fried. It was also exclusively chicken and rice. Usually when I order at other places I expect there to also be eggs, peas and carrots, but no luck with that here. \n\nI asked for sweet and sour sauce to go with my spring rolls (one order has four!) and was given one tiny tiny container of sauce. It was enough for one spring roll, which was both annoying and disappointing. Gotta have sweet and sour sauce with your rolls. \n\nThe saving grace of the review is their Mongolian beef. It's some of the best I've had so far in the city. They add in bell pepper and onion, and it was just the right amount of spicy with thinly sliced grilled beef. \n\nI'd be happy to order from them again to give it another chance, but stick with the meat options. It's fast, cheap, and normal huge portions of carry out Chinese food. They were also super nice, and I didn't get sick which is really all you can hope for when trying a new takeout place.", "author": "Jessica H."}

I was a little nervous trying something new because I'm kind of picky about my food-- especially Chinese food! This place was so good on every level. 1) delivery did not take too long 2) the food was freshly made (orange chicken was still hot and crispy, same with the walnut shrimp and spring roles) 3) the way everything tasted was very delicious and you can tell they don't reuse the same oil over and over again which causes a gross overly-used-oil taste to the food.

ELAINE!\"? Well, that scene has nothing to do with this small, sparse Chinese place on Broadway amid the strip clubs and the drunken patrons. Unless you are drunk and in desperate need of Chinese food to satisfy your alcohol-derived munchies. Then, yes, you would be banging on Elaine's window to open up and give you something to devour. Jamie W. and I, however, were completely sober when we walked over here after a weekend up in Mendocino. I can't say the same about the loudish party across the room whose indecisiveness had Elaine in a bit of a tizzy. We were admiring her pluck.\n\nEven though we had In-n-Out in Santa Rosa on the way back home, we still ordered a lot of food. We started with the $4.95 Spring Rolls which we always forget are not the freshly wrapped ones but the deep-fried ones with the requisite cherry sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1KSS8Yl). Pure Panda Express level here, but Elaine compensated by giving us a $4.95 bowl of Hot & Sour Soup free of charge (photo: http://bit.ly/1RnSLLz). This was pretty good, not quite Henry's Hunan level but it did hit the spot to counteract the grease of the rolls. Since we are planning a trip to Shanghai later this year, I had us try their $6.95 Shanghai Pork Steamed Dumplings since it seemed like a good deal given you get ten in a bamboo steamer (photo: http://bit.ly/1GqknJH). They were pretty darn tasty.\n\nThey had the squish factor down, something Jamie and I will try to replicate at our planned dumpling making lesson in Shanghai. Jamie ordered his favorite, the $7.95 General Tso's Chicken, which were prepared with chicken tenders deep-fried in a garlic sauce. The steamed broccoli florets were wholly unnecessary (photo: http://bit.ly/1FPa5Yw). I felt we needed at least one vegetable dish, but I failed and went for the $7.95 House Special Eggplant, which had plenty of sauteed eggplant but also chicken, beef pork and shrimp (photo: http://bit.ly/1QRnrnR). So frankly there wasn't anything veggie about it. Maybe I should have eaten the broccoli florets. Anyway, Elaine's was way better than our expectations given the shady location, so maybe drunken window banging is in our future.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...bargain Chinese pretty good if you avoid the spring rolls, try the dumplings\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...not much to it except that it's clean\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...Elaine gets a lot of exercise coming in and out of that kitchen\nTOTAL - 4 stars...\"ELAINE!... ELAINE!\" (bang-bang-bang)", "author": "Ed U."}

I got the sesame chicken, which I was very happy with. My friend got the general tso's chicken. The chicken was good, but the broccoli was a little too salty. We also got the potstickers, which themselves were good but the sauce that came with it was unimpressive. It was sort of a sour type sauce. Hard to describe, but not what I was expecting. I ended up dipping mine in soy sauce. Also, the portions are really big (like most chinese food places).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-02", "description": "Given how often I eat here, this review is severely overdue (but better late than never, right??)! Elaine's is simply the best comfort Chinese food in town, which is saying a lot since it is next door to Chinatown which presents a lot of stiff competition at dirt cheap prices. \n\nWhat sets Elaine apart from its Chinatown counterparts is the quality of the ingredients and preparation which is evident when you first sink your teeth into the food. I have never had a bad meal here and everyone I have brought here (either locally or from out of town) can attest that it is amongst the best Chinese food places they have ever had! The Crispy Sesame Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, Eggplant Special (with the various meats) and fried rice (pork is my favorite although just the plain egg fried rice is fine) are all to die for and I would eat them everyday if I could. The chow mein is also very good.\n\nThe prices are super reasonable, too, especially if you eat in the restaurant (Eat24 prices are slightly higher) and can make it for weekday lunch since they have an awesome lunch deal Monday through Friday - something to the tune of an entree, rice, hot and sour soup and a cream cheese wonton all for $6-8 depending on the entree with an option to add $1-2 to substitute white rice for fried rice or chow mein. I always leave waddling out of here or taking a small box to go for a little afternoon snack. Even if you don't make it for the lunch special, the regular portions are HUGE and you will definitely have leftovers if you order more than one item. \n\nWhat also sets Elaine's apart are the service and cleanliness of the restaurant which unfortunately leaves a lot to be desired at most Chinatown restaurants I've been to (I live in Chinatown and have made my way around the block). The staff who work here are very nice and the service is on point (your water cup will never be empty). Although I do get delivery 95% of the time, I enjoy eating at the restaurant every once in awhile to enjoy the food while it is piping hot. It's great when delivered but just a notch more delicious when it comes straight from the kitchen.\n\nTrust me when I say you will be hooked instantly after trying this place! I know I am and will be coming here for all my Chinese comfort food needs for the foreseeable future.", "author": "Jonah L."}

It also helps that they deliver so so quickly once you place the order--I've never waited more than 20 minutes once I call. We typically order every other weekend and definitely have our favorite entrees. The sesame chicken and broccoli with beef are probably the best meat entrees. However their chow Leon and rice options are great as well. I love that you can get shrimp, pork and chicken in the fried rice at no extra charge! Note that when you order a meat entree it does not come with a side of rice so you do have to order that separately. If you're looking for some appetizers to share I recommend the crab cream cheese puffs or the pork dumplings which we tend to alternate depending on the mood we're in. Bottom line you cannot go wrong here, check them out next time you're in the North Beach area!", "author": "Elise M."}

The food was decent- the portion size was great, and I'm pretty sure they don't use MSG. The only thing is that we ordered it to be spicy, but we found that the food was not super flavorful, and it lacked salt. Kind of a bummer that we had to re-season the food once we got home with it, but overall pretty good. I might try another place next time for Chinese food because of that.", "author": "Priya B."}

I wanted something quick, walking distance from my office on Montgomery, and not crazy-expensive. As Elaine's seemed to meet all my basic requirements I pulled up their menu on Grubhub and gave them a shot.\n\nClearly, this place's bread & butter is takeout / delivery. When I rolled in I was amazed to see absolutely no one in the restaurant - literally, not a soul - yet no less than a half dozen orders waiting to be picked up or else set out for delivery. Fascinating.\n\nAnd I must say, they do what they do and they do it pretty well. Getting the General Tso's was definitely a good move. As I'm the farthest thing of being a hard core fan of Asian Cuisine, I usually go with the General because you can always count on it being relatively filling and not overly complicated - at least when compared to other Chinese dishes. The pork fried rice I had was a little dry - but still generally to my liking - so I can't complain. \n\nAll in all a very positive and seamless experience.

So I was a bit annoyed I had to do it myself, but I'm assuming the purpose was to keep the chicken crispy which is fine. \n\nThe food quality was pretty good. Not greasy at all which is what I read was an issue. The only issue I have is it was delivery and the guy made me come all the way down to the street in the cold to pick up my order after I tipped 30%. Other than that, it was a good choice.", "author": "D O."}

Two thumbs up for an awesome delivery experience! From sitting down to get our first dish is within 5-10 mins. We went there around 5:30 to avoid the line.\n\nSeating is relatively spacious, everyone is very happy in the restaurant. This place is fabulous. The environment is cozy and comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I visited here last Saturday along with my wife and two of my friends. We ordered the Crispy Sesame Chicken with house fried rice on the side and the dry saut\u00e9ed string beans. The flavour, presentation and texture was all 10/10. If you want to try some tasty Chinese dishes, this is a great place to hit.\nMesmerized by the taste my wife wanted to try some more and so we ordered spicy basil chicken and dried tofu chicken. Spice was right on the medium spice order of spicy basil chicken and the dried tofu chicken was perfectly savoury. \nThe food was served hot and perfect. The staffs were really honest, admirable and professional. LET ME TELL YOU: my wife forgot her wallet under the table (it had slipped out of her purse). 2 hours after leaving the restaurant, she noticed it was gone and remembered the last place she had it. We called them, they said they had it - and they did. NOTHING was missing from it: she had plenty of cash & cards inside that could've been taken with no accountability. But no, they had it waiting for her.\nDefinitely loved the way they are and so, I thought of ordering them for home delivery. This was the first time that I've ever eaten Chinese take-out. Yes you read that correctly...I've had my fair share of Chinese food in my day (both good and bad) but, my family never gets it as take-out. So I was a little skeptical about how well Chinese food tastes when its been delivered.\n\nWe ordered a variety of items (they have literally like a hundred menu items to choose from) and the portion sizes were pretty big. I would highly recommend ordering the Shanghai Pork Steamed Dumplings, mongolian beef, and potstickers.\n\nI'd definitely order take-out from them again, and I would recommend it as long as you are careful about what you order! Check out the lunch specials for a great deal!\n\nOverall, I loved this placed on all my encounters with them. Definitely a place to visit again and again.", "author": "Matin G."}

We sometimes order lunches from here for our company so we decided to try out this place. The restaurant is located on Broadway past all the clubs and can be a little hard to spot, especially with the construction that is currently taking place right on top of the restaurant. The inside is pretty small but looks nice and modern! There were a lot of items on the lunch menu, which I really appreciate because I feel like lunch menus these days have such limited choices. I decided to go with the salt and pepper fish fillet. \n\nBefore our entrees arrived, everyone got hot and sour soup and a fried cream cheese wonton as well, which are included with our lunch specials. Nice! The hot and sour soup was tasty and not too spicy as some can be. The cream cheese wonton had a good crispiness to it and the filling inside was pretty good. When all of our entrees came, they all looked like they gave a good decent amount of food. I was relieved to see that my fish fillet wasn't just all batter. The fish tasted fresh and was good with the peppers that it came with. My entree also came with white rice.

Don't really know much about dining culture in SF area, but we thought the delivery time of 1 hour was a bit excessive at almost 9pm, but it was our only option with kids already knocked out in the room.\n\nThe lady that was taking the order was patient and courteous. She helped me get the order in. When I realized it was almost $55 (for 2 of us, but we don't blame them, we ordered like 5 things), I tried to cancel 1 of the items, but the lady told me she already processed the card.... bullshit, she couldn't possibly have charged the card within 10 seconds of telling me the total. It was really whatevers at that point and I didn't really want to fight it as we were starved. \n\nThe delivery guy showed up after promised 1 hour. \n\nFried rice was decent, but kind of had that Viet seasoning taste, not straight Chinese. It was good enough. Chowmein was super blend and just tasted like oil and cabbage. Other chicken/beef items were not great but not bad either... pretty standard greasy Chinese takeout. We were so hungry and just ate up our food without complaining, but honestly I felt like panda express had better quality food.

Solid, but also what you would expect \n- Hot & sour soup, and crab cream cheese puffs: These came free with our meal and were yummy!\n\nUnlike many other Chinese places, they do NOT use a ton of oil in their cooking, and the restaurant is SUPER clean and orderly (say what!!!).

They have good Chinese food and the taste is really. The house fried rice is made with various meat and vegetables and tastes real good (and they are doing it the old way because among the three I had one of them is saltier than the others). Their Chow Mein is very good too, the slightly over-oily noodles reminds me exactly what I used to have back in China. I highly recommend the tofu chicken, general tso's chicken and broccoli beef, which I had for three different meals. These dishes have a very good taste and texture and have a special aroma that is generally lacking in some other Chinese restaurants. The food looks also healthier as they are less starchy and you can easily tell that the vegetables they use are very fresh.\nHighly recommended. And they give some oranges if you order for delivery!", "author": "Shuang L."}

The order was delivered at 2:29 OM.  Delivery time of 49 minutes.  It was within the estimated 45 to 60 minutes.  However, there are places with quicker delivery.  Delivery is free.\n\nMinimum Order - Delivery minimum is relatively high ($20).\n\nMongolian Beef - The vegetables were over cooked.  The meat was tender and had nice flavor but did needed more zip.  They did not include the side of hot sauce I requested.  The portions were relatively large.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/6aln55r\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/6h2td9l\n\nGeneral's Chicken - It had no crunch.  The chicken was tender.  This dish was extremely bland.  The broccoli was extremely overcooked.  Luckily, I do not really eat cooked broccoli.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/6bd3mnj\n\nRice - The rice was well-cooked.\n\nPacking - The food was neatly packed into easy to reseal plastic containers.  There was some very minor leakage.\n\nPricing - Their prices are a bit on the high side.  They do have lunch specials but these are only available on weekdays.\n\nSoft Drink 3 \n$1.50 \nSteamed Rice 2 \n$1.50\nMongolian Beef 1 \n$8.95 How Spicy?: Hot\nInstructions: Side of hot sauce please\nGeneral Tsao Chicken 1 \n$9.95 How Spicy?: Hot\n\nSubtotal: $26.40 Discount\nTax: $2.51 Delivery Charge: Free !\nTotal:   $28.91 \n\nFortune Cookie - They did not include fortune cookies.  Chinese food without fortune cookies is like Christmas without Santa Claus.\n\nOverall - The food was very average.  The prices are slightly high.  Delivery was a little on the long side.  No fortune cookies.  No hot sauce.  There are many better all around options for Chinese food delivery.  But, in a pinch, it will do.  There are certainly options that are not as good.", "author": "Mark D."}

Mom in the back screaming for an entire 43 minutes STRAIGHT! I shit you not. Her stamina to be able to continue that long is simply amazing. \n\nSo I ordered and was told to come back in 20 minutes. I came back to p/u and walked up the where I thought I would be able to pay and the man(Father) said it would be just a couple more minutes. So I sat down at a table not occupied by one of the kids. 2 more minutes actually ended up being 23 more minutes in what felt like the middle of this families living room as I was the only customer there. There was a young Chinese boy fiddling with his cell phone, a 3-4 year old watching TV, a teen girl on her laptop. All this on the tables for customers. And of course the screaming Mother in the back in Chinese...no subtitles.\n\nThe environment was not at all welcoming as I felt like I was intruding on a family in there home. This is the WORST atmosphere I have ever encountered. \n\nOK it's not all bad though. The food was really tasty. I got the scallops with chicken fried rice. Now about the scallops, yeah I know what they are supposed to look like and these scallops where sliced into thirds and then covered up into balls which were then fried. I was not too happy to see the cheapness of the family on the scallops. \n\nBottom line: The food gets 4 stars. The atmosphere gets 0.

I can't judge, I let the 'playa' play) But let's not confuse form over function. What you'll get is great people serving great food. I was part of a construction project across the street from this restaurant and came here often with the crew. That was 4 years ago and to this day, the owners still remember me and welcomed me with fried rice. How's that for customer service? The owners are here 7 days a week, unlike the other businesses in the Fi-Di where they're only open Monday-Friday. The husband owner rides his bike around town to deliver orders. It humbles me every time I see that. The food is also impeccable. I wish I took photos of all the dinners I had here in the past; no worries, time to start now. I remember always 'feening' for Mongolian Beef at this place and that's what I ordered. It was as good as I remembered. Much more authentic than other restaurants around.

I don't know how to say this in English but the food has the taste of being cooked in high heat, which caramelizes the surface ever so slightly, a signature of classic Asian stir fry. Which is great. Their location is slightly outside of Chinatown which means that they probably have to work harder instead of rely on random tourists to walk in. To sum it all up, I feel this is a fairly solid place for typical style Chinese food.", "author": "Winston W."}

The portions were big, and price very reasonable.\n\nIt's family run and the kids are there, watching TV or helping with the food.

I personally don't mind that, but be prepared to have the kids around doing their homework, browsing music videos on youtube, or just talking in Chinese with their parents. \nThe food was served within minutes of my order. My tastebuds said the food wasn't special in any regard, I'd rather say it was average americanized Chinese cuisine.

Like Wonderdog fast.\n\nPortions are very large, though to be fair they tend to be heavy on veggies and light on meat. I dont view this as a negative, but just know what you should expect.\n\nAs is usual for chinese dives they have a rice-plate based lunch menu. Everythign I've had is good, espcially the Royal Pork (simple slices of roast pork with perfectly stirfried greens) and the Spicy Eggplant (not oily as at most places.)  A bowl of soup, an entre with rice, a small salad, a wedge of orange, tea and a cookie cost around $5.  Try doing that at home.\n\nThe dinner menu has the same items, and again they are well, if simply executed.  Try the stir fried green beens if you want a veggie option.

IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I'M GIVING THIS PLACE 2 STARS, JUST READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH!\n\nI ordered the pork potstickers, the chicken salad, and General Tsao's chicken (out of respect for General Tsao, although I'm not sure who he is, I am capitalizing his name and title). The pork potstickers were absolutely delicious, with the right amount of crispiness on the outer edges and perfectly cooked pork on the inside. I couldn't put them down and when I was done, I hated myself for eating them in such a hurry instead of savoring each and every bite. Next time, I'll be sure to place two orders of the potstickers for sure!\n\nThe chicken salad was decent. There's tons of raw onion in the salad (and not red onions, that usually make  salads oh so delicious) but the white kind, that just tastes way too oniony and blehhhh overall. After trying to pick out all the onion bits and pieces for about 15 min., I just gave up on the salad. I guess it's partly my fault for expecting a quality salad from a Chinese restaurant. \n\nWhat people say about huge portions is definitely true. My General Tsao's chicken was huge! And it lasted me for three whole days (which is good in this economy). The dish was warm when it arrived, and the chicken was fried to perfection! This is something that I would definitely order from Green Garden again! Although I'm interested in trying other dishes in the future as well. \n\nThe reason I'm giving this place two stars is because of the extremely creepy, creepy, creepy CREEEEEEEPPPPPPPY middle-aged delivery guy with a creepy creepy CREEEEEEPY smile. When I answered the door, I promptly gave him the money that I owed him (along with a generous tip) and expected him to hand me the food and leave. After all, it should have been a simple and quick transaction (kind of like those drug deals that happen on Law & Order series). But instead he forced the door open, started commenting on how nice my apartment was and proceeded to take a step or two inside, looking all up and down my apartment, as if I was having a full blown open-house and he was Donald Trump. Finally I got so annoyed that I had to say, \"Excuse me, what the hell do you think you are doing?\" at which point, he realized how inappropriate his actions were and stepped out again. Seriously, it was as if he was trying to make up his mind whether to rob my place or let me live another day. I quickly proceeded to shut the door firmly on his CREEEEPPPPY face and use all the locks on my door + move all my furniture to the door so it would not budge. Considering the decent food and hefty portions, I would like to order from this place again, but ONLY if they get a new delivery guy that's not so rude/ CREEEEEEPY.", "author": "Andrew C."}
