I have travelled extensively both domestically and internationally, and I can confidently endorse Philz as one of the best coffees I have had . . . ever. Their extensive list of 20+ choices is more like a wine list than a coffee shop touting their one or two daily roasts. And with each cup individually ground and brewed when you order you always know you're getting a fresh cup. Staff are friendly, and I loved that they're not a bunch of coffee snobs. They simply brew world-class coffee. Enough said. \n\nIf you've not yet tried Philz, you're missing a wonderful cup of joe. Enjoy!", "author": "Mike C."}

The Philz HQ!!\n\nIt's tucked away in a kinda quiet industrial neighborhood, so you won't get any of the usual crazy hustle and bustle of SF. There's some outdoor seating, as well as tons of space inside!! The inside is SUPER HIP!! So nicely decorated, and it has a nice modern vibe!!\n\nMy go-to drink orders:\n- 1/2 yerba mate, 1/2 chamomile, iced, medium creamy with almond milk and light sweet with honey\n- Iced Philtered Soul, straight up\n\nIt is the headquarters, so they test out new food items here. They had the ricotta & pistachio toast, which isn't something you can find at all the locations that serve food (not all locations have toast/food selections other than what you see in the bakery display case)!! \n\nThe ricotta & pistachio toast was kinda missing something?? It was served on Starter Bakery bread and came with honey and sea salt, but it kinda lacked the flavor I was expecting?? It was tasty with a hint of sweet and salty that complemented each other nicely, but I think I'm going to stick to my usual: avocado toast with no egg\n\nThey had a creamy hazelnut toast on the menu, but I didn't see it in the display case, so I asked if they were still serving it, and the worker said they ran out of hazelnuts and that they stopped because it wasn't super popular :( I also saw a few energy bowl options!! Hella rad!!\n\nBottom line: Love this location!! The workers are super friendly, and there's tons of space if you're looking for a place to work. I'm a HUGEEE sucker for those cute little hip local third wave coffee shops with ambiguous names that leave much room for interpretation (SF's specialty!!!!!!!), but Philz will always be #1 in my heart", "author": "Kithumini J."}

In addition to the wonderful workspace, wifi and kind staff members, the coffee is INCREDIBLE!!!!\n\nFor the coffee snob that is into PURE black coffee, Philz will not disappoint the highly developed palate of yours. My go-to is Aromatic Arabic. A darker blend with tones of walnut and a smokiness to it. No cream, no sugar needed. Just a good cup of coffee to get the caffeine surge you need for work, and wonderful taste to keep your soul happy. \n\nIn addition, the breakfast burritos, banana nut bread and complementary cucumber water are frosting on the wonderful (coffee) cake that is Philz. \n\nBottom Line: Best coffee in San Francisco.", "author": "Jaime W."}

Consider this paying homage to the awesomeness that is Philz.\n\nWhile it lacks the funkier nature and vibe of the original Philz, it has the more modern and contemporary design of the newer Philz locations that I like so much (San Mateo, Redwood City, Palo Alto).  It's pretty cool to be able to look up and see light fixtures that spell out \"Cup of Love\", as well as the Philz offices on the second floor (looks like they took over/converted the garage and bottom floor of the building)  \n\nAs for the drinks, my Mint Mojito may have been crafted by a \"student\" of Philz University, but it was just as good as any other I've had.  Just the right amount of sweetness with just the right amount of creaminess.  Of course, being able to snag a seat outside made the experience that much more enjoyable.  Perhaps not many people have discovered this location just yet (it's a relatively quiet street off 3rd), but there's also plenty of seating both inside and out (with plenty of outlets too).\n\nIf all of that wasn't enough to make this Philz the best one in SF, the fact that it's in Potrero Hill helps.  Talk about the perfect fit!  Not only has the area needed a Philz, but parking is a breeze (unlike their other locations).

We're in the dogpatch which is a sunnier side of San Francisco so the ceiling high windows make for fabulous light.\n+ Toasts with scrumptious flavors such as almond butter, honey, and salt and avocado and zatar! No other Philz location I know of serves these. I guess they offer them here since Philz HQ is located on the second floor of the cafe.\n+ Friendly, smiley baristas. Philz is known for this but the ones here seem extra smiley and jovial. Maybe that's a pre-requisite for working at the corporate HQ store.\n+ Not as crowded. I was hanging out here all day Thursday and there were lots of good seats to pick from and nary a long line or if it did get long, it went by pretty quickly.\n+Clean - I frequent Philz a lot and depending on which area of SF you're in, some are way grungier than others. This one they actually take the time to wipe down the tables and the bathroom wasn't scary.\n\nWas enjoying my weekday off here. Great environment to get super caffeinated (Currently having some heart palpitations -  strong brew today!), bring your laptop and get some stuff done. Decent wifi and good mix of music. Love the selection of people who frequent this Philz, from nearby office workers to police officers, construction workers, and a smattering of hipsters (one specifically who had the most enviable man bun that put my bun to shame.)

I've been to most of the Philz locations in all the cities that he's popping up in, Oakland, SJ, Palo Alto, etc. I don't usually bother to write reviews for each one because the Philz chain is beginning to look and function all the same. Not bad, just not worth me putting pen to paper over.\n\nWell, my usual 24th st. Philz has been going downhill lately. Ever Since Tony, the pourista left, the coffee just hasn't been the same. When I saw this new out of the way Philz pop up under \"Hot and New\" I figured I would jump in the car to check it out. \n\nThis Philz is located in an up and coming yuppieville area of the Dogpatch. It's located on the southern end of it that hasn't yet caught up. With that said, it's located in a brand new condo/loft complex, surrounded by nothing but industrial buildings. There's decent parking but not as much as I would've thought since most of the would be parking spaces are driveways.\n\nIt's a hot looking new space, as all the new Philz are. However there's something different about this one. It could be the Neon \"Philz University\" sign and bar located to the left of the main brew line. I assume this is where they train budding pouristas. There's even a snazzy glass conference room upstairs with a massive TV. I'm sure nobody has trouble staying awake during long training sessions here.\n\nI was joking with a coworker that maybe we would run into Tony here. Sure enough, when we walked in we were instantly greeted with his patented \"gentleman, what can I get you today?\". Holy shit! Phil must know Tony is his best pourista, so he brought him down to Philz U to train the n00bs. Smart use of Snoop's money, Phil. Very smart! \n\nHe brewed up a fantastic cup of coffee, Silken Splendor on this occasion. Steeped perfectly, aerated multiple times, double high poured, then filled to the brim in our own mugs which saves you a dollar by bringing your own.\n\nTheir pastry case was well stocked, although I hate their Starter bakery items, I was happy to see they had several varieties of Pepples Donuts. More Vegan items would be much appreciated. \n\nEven if I have to drive here, I just found my new Philz to begin Phunky Phat Phridays.", "author": "John B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-10", "description": "As far as I know, coffee at each Philz is pretty comparable, so this is a review primarily on the particulars of this location.\n\nFirst things first, my fave drink here is the Mint Mojito...I know, basic. But hey, it's sweet and caffeinated and refreshing :)\n\nI love that they have so many food options at this location. Because this location is the home of Philz HQ, they have many pilot food items that are not available at the other locations (yet?).The avocado toast is TO DIE FOR. I don't know what they put on it aside from the olive oil, but it's so delicious. And this is in addition to the normal deliciousness of avos in general.\n\nThe baristas are always friendly and upbeat here, and they do a good job of keeping the cafe clean. The cafe itself has a start-up office kind of feel. Maybe because of the demographic, idk. If you stay for a while, there will be occasional influxes of tech bros and the type. The space itself is airy, inviting, and really bright. My favorite place to sit is by the window, but there are also couches in the middle of the room, as well as long tables.\n\nThe atmosphere of this Philz is great if you just want a place to chill and maybe get some work or reading done. That's what I've been using it for the past few weekends!", "author": "Denise C."}

It's spacious, there are plenty of seats and outlets, high ceilings, and the amount of natural light streaming into this place creates a airy environment that feels completely different from the den-like cozy location on 24th. \n\nBoard games, stuffed Totoro animals to add some flair, cucumber water, adorable lighting fixtures spelling out words, gorgeous Bloom bouquets placed throughout, and great, friendly staff - this place has it all. Oh and did I mention that parking is a breeze?\n\nMy only gripe is that my iced coffee has tasted pretty darn watered down every time. It's happened both with the normal Ecstatic and the Philtered Soul. Hm, perhaps it's hitting the ice when it's still too hot? My theory is that other locations generally have a huge line - thus the baristas make a number of drinks at once. My coffee has time to cool before it's poured over ice. \n\nAt this location, you often get some sweet one-on-one attention, but this also means that they want to get you your drink asap, and your coffee hits the ice when it's still fairly warm - thus creating a more watered-down drink. Definitely just a theory, someone correct me if I'm wrong.", "author": "Jessica O."}

Yes, they ask you to try us and make sure it's how you want it, but no matter what adjectives I use to describe the amount of milk and sugar I'd like, every barista has a different opinion of what light sugar and light milk means. One Batista I'll say \"light milk\" and get a caf\u00e9 au lait, another will hand me something that looks and tastes like black coffee that was just waved in front of a sealed milk carton. It's a cumbersome process to taste, hand the coffee back, taste, etc. I often end up with coffee that's sweeter than I'd like, so I have to take it as is or waste it and wait for them to remake it. If I ask for more milk, it's almost always too much extra.\n\nThere's a total lack of control on the customers part for a beverage that is really something everyone makes to their own personal tastes. Sure, have the barista make the entire drink, but can't we at least have milk and sugar available for people who would like to fix their own?", "author": "Colin M."}

So it's perfect that Philz has a truck in the Marina away from the craziness! \n\nI've been here 3 times and there has always been a short line. You will probably get your coffee within about 10-15 minutes at most. \n\nLike my other reviews of other Philz, it really is the same great coffee as the other locations! But granted, I'm not a huge coffee drinker. I only drink it maybe once a week, but I know what I like and I like this. \n\nI highly recommend the Ecstatic Iced Coffee or the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee. \n\nLast side note: my friends were visiting from Korea and I took them here.

Luckily the nicer lady I mentioned earlier took my order afterwards and was patient enough to explain that Philz doesn't do americano's (which I normally drink). After recommending a drink to me, I proceeded to the register and told the cashier that I ordered an americano but that the barista recommended me another drink. He then rudely tells me, \"I don't think you understand. We do things differently here. You have stand in the orange circle and wait for a barista to call you and take your order.\" After explaining to him that I already waited in the orange circle AND already ordered but just forgot the name of my drink, I told him that he could ask the barista what it was that she made for me. The cashier then rolled his eyes and walked away to speak to the barista about the order.\n\nI've been around the world and have had coffee in many different places. Coffee should not be pretentious and those that are serving it shouldn't be rudely making hand gestures or rolling their eyes.  I really wanted to enjoy this place but unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever return to this particular location.", "author": "Jowett L."}

You know. Anyway, we tried ordering different things for awhile. There was this girl who wore a colorful, flowing fur cap. She seemed to know a lot about the business. The ones with vibrant colors always do. There's this painting of two giraffes next to where we usually sit, and my girlfriend always points them out and calls one the baby and the other the mom, though it could've been an alternate perspective of necks. Who knows. One time there was a group of cops enjoying cups around a pair of square tables they had pushed together. I wondered if they had authority in doing this, like usual, or if the employees found power in their own hands. I could see the girl with the hat rushing to do this sort of thing. But she wasn't there. Actually, I noticed the entire place had been rearranged: the large leather seat my girlfriend and I shared last time had been moved to another corner and replaced with a table from another angle. Then I wondered how that changed the room, or the customers' revival of the same experience but through a different air--who walked in first and noticed the shift? I used to be obsessed with rearranging my bedroom for this exact reason; I'd walk in after school the next day, flip the light switch, and feel that brief second when your mind shoots in remarkably quick directions to find a reason for the change, someone to blame. But maybe it's just me always bored with stagnant atmospheres: same light, same gravity & weight, same smell of french roast drifting in from the kitchen to wake me up early.", "author": "Logan E."}

Which would be more okay if there were more of a discount or notification about people learning. In general I love Philz and love that I have a walkable one but my desire to pay full price for a disappointing cup of coffee isn't always there.", "author": "Elisabeth H."}

This Philz has a clean crisp laid back feel to it, a more modern location.  a nice hidden gem in the dog patch area. I love their iced green tea!

If you have an allergy or dietary concern, most everything is labeled, or in a nearby binder. Tamara and Will were above and beyond helpful, the food fresh and the beverages hot.

Also, great service by the staff at this truck. They ask what level of sweetness you like when you order, then they make sure you're happy with it when you get it. Definitely five stars!", "author": "Riz W."}
