It's a coffee cart stuffed inside the front door of a bar/restaurant on an alleyway down in SOMA. The friendly baristas serve up a short menu of espresso drinks made with Blue Bottle coffee. The espresso is really tasty. But what I come here for is the cold brew. Special Xtra makes a mean cold brew, and they put chicory in the coffee, which adds a nice extra flavor to embolden the smoothness inherent in cold brew.  Grab a cold brew, add some half n' half, and you have a little refreshing kickstart for your day. \n\nThe only complaint? Cold drinks in paper cups.

I gave up the artificial stuff years ago and I just feel like this is easier than sugar granules.\n\nThey also have AWESOME pastries.  Every one I've had is terrific.  The morning bun is fantastic (I feel like it has to be Tartine, but I don't know), the chocolate chip cookies are amazing, and then all the other cookies like the coconut chocolate chip and the chocolate chip / nut / popcorn crazy one are also great.

It's not strong or harsh at all, and they don't aim to be that way. \n\nThe biggest draw back to this place is that fact that's it's so small. Even when the line is only 5-6 people, you're still set back about 10 minutes to get your caffeine.

Unfortunately it did not take much time for them to undo my high praises and recommendations.\n\nI will be honest and rate their coffee with 4 stars, but their service barely deserves one star, which is something Pete's will get right most of the time.\n\nToday I brought a small crowd from my company (normally composed of Pete/Starbucks fans) to Special Extra.  I have been doing this for a while now.  Special Extra was somewhat busy (I've seen them much busier) and delivered a lukewarm latte.  I asked the barista if they could make it hotter, to which she replied that she could add some hot water.  At this point, Pete's would have offered to re-make it, which is the standard I was hoping they would achieve, but did not.  I asked her politely if she could re-make it, and to my surprise, she snapped and responded with a very, very irritated look.  She and the other baristo behind the counter had a quiet conversation, and then she exclaimed, \"well you're just gonna have to wait since we're busy.\"  I understand what food service can be like especially when its busy, but I was shocked by her reaction, and all of my pro Special Extra enthusiasm has been completely wiped away.\n\nI hope the owner of manager of Special Extra sees this, as I hope his/her goal is to create fans and not be rude to once loyal customers.\n\nOur group has decided we will go to Pete's next time, where the coffee may not be as good, but we would be treated with respect, which to me, is more important.", "author": "Tai K."}
