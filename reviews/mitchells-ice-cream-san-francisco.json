Note that every time I do go the line is always long af, but it is so worth the wait!\n\nI've tried a lot of their flavors but my go tos are always grasshopper pie, halo halo, tropical four, and coconut pineapple. But honestly, all their flavors are hella good! The consistency of their ice cream is always perfect, soft and creamy and doesn't melt right away when you step outside!\n\nAlso, if you don't want to wait, they have pre packed half gallons (in the most popular flavors) ready for purchase. \n\nParking in the area is kind of difficult if you don't get a spot in their back parking lot. I've always been lucky, but I've known people who have circled for a bit before getting a spot. \n\nI highly recommend Mitchell's if you're in the area craving ice cream or if it's you're first time visiting SF and need to get a dessert.", "author": "Stacey Y."}

Wait, don't you have a bucket list of ice cream shops?\n\nLike most places in SF, parking is always an adventure. We must have circled the block half a dozen times til we found a semi-questionable parking space. Just be willing to walk for your dessert bc you likely won't be parking anywhere close to the shop. Heck, maybe make this a walking/Uber tour of ice cream shops in SF!\n\nNow for the cream ;), for such a relatively small shop, Mitchell's has quite the selection of flavors. What I like about Mitchell's is they have standard flavors but they also have great tasting seasonal flavors. Mitchell's isn't crazy with those flavors either. It's not a hipster ice cream shops so you won't have a moss and bark flavored option. Rather you'll get options like cantaloupe (summer) and ginger spice (winter). With that I went with the Kahlua Mocha Cream (Kahlua liqueur, Colombian coffee and cocoa) and the French Custard Vanilla. Overall the rich smoothness made my stomach grumble in all the right ways.\n\nSo when you're completing your walking/Uber tour of San Francisco ice cream places, be sure to include Mitchell's. It's well worth the steps.", "author": "Stan W."}

This place is a staple if you have a sweet tooth and find yourself in the city! My family has been coming here long before I was born and I've been coming to this place for as long as I can remember. There are a variety of ice cream flavors and some are seasonal. Some flavors you just can't find anywhere such as cantaloupe (which is seasonal during the summer), ube (a Filipino dessert), and thai tea. They even do ice cream cakes, all of which can be custom made with any flavor of their ice creams. All the workers are friendly and efficient. Of course you can sample flavors of the ice cream before you commit to a scoop as well! \n\nPRO TIP: upon entering the facility go through the doors and to your immediate left you will need to pull a ticket in order to get a number and place in line. Once your number is called you and your party can be serviced. If you don't feel like waiting in line for single scoops of ice cream you can buy a half gallon tub and go to a separate side line on the right hand side and pay and go.", "author": "Franchesca B."}

They bring out new flavors now and then and try to source with local ingredients. The ice cream is smooth and very creamy. Some of the flavors are subtle and not very overpowering which is nice though watch out if you like to pair flavors up as one could over power the other. Feel free to grab a half gallon to go and savor your ice cream at home. I definitely get the feel of this being more of a family oriented place (not that other ice cream joints aren't) because of the easy short term parking in front to allow parents to grab some ice cream on the go. \n\nWhile not a \"hipster\" place, the ube and Halo Halo flavors are certainly Instagram ready. =P", "author": "Liza X."}

Selections are divided between traditional flavors (Chocolate Chip, Butterscotch Marble, Oreo Cookie, Pistachio), tropical flavors (Buko Baby Coconut, Avocado, Lucuma, Yam), and sorbets (apricot mango, passion fruit, mango).

They have been around seventy years, and their summer lines are out the door, but they're much faster to service the line than their big competitor in South San Francisco, \"Bi-Rite Creamery.\" If I had to choose one over the other? Let's put it this way: Anytime I'm eating \"Henry Hunan Chinese\" for dinner up on Church Street, that means, I'll be walking down two blocks for now on down on 29th Street to San Jose Avenue where \"Mitchell's\" is at afterwards.

We didn't feel like standing in the crowd, so my family opted to buy 2 half-gallon tubs of their pre-packaged ice cream. They had a separate check-out area for customers buying pre-packaged items, so we didn't need to wait long to buy our ice cream and leave.\n\nMenu and cost:\nMitchell's offers a wide variety of flavors from classic (e.g. vanilla, oreo, coffee) to adventurous (e.g. avocado, ginger spice, rum raisin) to ethnic (e.g. ube, buko, lychee). We bought one tub of langka (jackfruit) and one tub of halo-halo (a filipino dessert). The total came to $21.98 [for those that eat Magnolia ice cream here's a rough comparison: Mitchells = $21.98/gal; Magnolia(estimated $7/1.5qt) = ~$18.67/gal]. Even though it's expensive, you get your bang for your buck here. \n\nThe ice cream:\nThe consistency for both flavors was nice and creamy, as expected. I found myself searching for more flavor in the langka ice cream, but I blame that on the jackfruit itself. Langka doesn't have a powerful flavor. Nonetheless, it was a light, delectable dessert. Once in a while you'll find a small piece of langka in your bite and the jackfruit flavor really kicks in. On the other hand, the halo-halo ice cream knocked me off my feet! They have the milky taste of halo-halo down to a tee. The ratio of ice cream to the various mix-ins typically found in halo-halo (red bean, buko, langka, kaong, etc.) was spot on. With each bite you get an ingredient you would expect in halo-halo. The ice cream isn't too rich, so I found each bite to be refreshing and delicious.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't mind waiting around to get a scoop if I had the time and energy. If you don't feel like waiting, their pre-packaged tubs are worth it. I'd highly recommend coming here and I'll definitely be coming back to try the different flavors Mitchell's Ice Cream has to offer.", "author": "Lauren P."}

I finally decided on Mitchell's because I wanted to try the Ube ice cream. \n\nSo first time to Mitchell's and it was a Monday around 4 pm. There was a lot of people but not so much that there was a line. I was pretty happy about that, and it wasn't even a hot day either, pretty cold actually.\n\nThere were just SO MANY flavors that I just had to ask to try like 5 flavors(honestly I wanted to ask to try more, but I refrained myself). The man was nice and gave me the samples, but he never really smiled...wish he would smile a bit, he looked like he was frowning. \n\nI decided to get a double, a scoop of Ube and a scoop of Espresso Toffee Chip. I also got a waffle cone with that, which is +50 cents. A Double is $5.85 and a Single $3.85. So mine including the waffle cone was $6.35.\n\nI think the prices are reasonable for the portions and quality of the ice cream. It wasn't too creamy or icy, it was the best consistency of ice cream ever. It was slightly sticky too. The Ube flavor was on point too, not too sweet and it has an aftertaste of the Ube, it even seemed to have tiny pieces of the yam in the ice cream.\n\nIn my opinion Ube is the best flavor. I think Mitchell's ice cream and Bi-Rite Creamery is about the same, but if you want more unique flavors, then Mitchell's is the place to go. Definitely recommend to try the Ube.\n\nComing back next time we visit SF :)", "author": "Rachel L."}

I really love that this place has both traditional and also some tropical flavors thrown into the mix! They have buko pandan, ube, coconut pineapple, and so many other flavors that I am happy to see! \n\nParking // street parking and I definitely would not want to park in front of this ice cream shop, since there are so many people in line even at 10pm. \n\nProcess // You need to go to the front and get a number in which they will call out when it is time for you and your party to be served. It took about 30 minutes we were called. \n\nIce cream service // Service is friendly and they let you try samples of ice cream. I tried the Macapuno and Lucuma (peruvian fruit). I like the macapuno a LOT, so I ended up going with that one. \n\nIce cream choice // My bf and I decided to split a double (5.85)- Macapuno and Halo halo ice cream in a waffle bowl which is 0.75 cents more. It's worth it if you like a crispy and delcious waffle cone to compliment your ice cream. \n\nOverall, I LOVE their ice cream here! So creamy and there are so many options that cater to all types of tastes and cravings. It's also pretty affordable compared to a few other places I've been to.

With 3,500+ reviews, it's not going to do much, but I just had to release some frustration.  Up until my latest visit, Mitchell's had been one of my fave ice cream shops in SF.  I had tried the Halo Halo cup before (with all the misc stuff under the ice cream; not ice cream on a cone) and it was so tasty!  However, in my most recent experience, I got a scoop of Halo Halo ice cream on a chocolate-dipped waffle cone (+$).  \n\nAll was good until, as I kept eating the ice cream, I bite into some paper!  It was definitely a wtf-moment as I realized there was paper lined along the INTERIOR of my cone.  Its normal to have paper in between the chocolate-dipped cone to separate them, so I tried to justify it for them for a sec, but as I thought about it some more...I kept thinking how its pretty impossible not to notice bright white lining all over the inside of the cone as you scoop ice cream onto it...so I feel like this was a result of pure laziness.  The result of this was an extremely frustrating ice cream eating experience (first world problem, I know hah).  \n\n1.) eat all my ice cream\n2.) get fingers all sticky from getting ice-cream soaked interior paper lining out of cone\n3.) angrily eat cone by itself\n\nTo be honest, the ice cream is good, with my favorite being Ube.  But that last experience was terrible, and the girl that served me wasn't very warm or friendly during the transaction either.  They have a tiny parking lot in the back; otherwise, you'll need to find street parking.", "author": "Jeff T."}

I played it safe and got rocky road in a cup and it legit tasted like they made it from real chocolate.  The BF got a shake that he customized (which I didn't know you could do!) but he asked for 1 scoop of banana and 1 scoop of chocolate caramel crackle.  He's super picky with his ice cream and he loved it.  \n\nHere's a tip.  Grab a number when you get there, it's on the left side on the wall (behind the sea of people waiting).  There's also a very tiny lot behind the shop that has a few parking spaces.  Most likely always full, but maybe you'll get lucky.  \n\nFeel free to ask for any samples.

If you wait inside, be prepared to dodge people ordering and people buying the gallon take home containers. No need to wait for your number to be called if you opt for the ready to go containers. You can maybe even sneak in a scoop or two in the process.  \n\nAfter waiting about 15 minutes, my number was finally called. I wasn't in the mood for something too rich but wanted to try a bunch of the flavors. There are so many! I am always astounded by the plethora of tropical flavors. Some of these fruits I've never even heard of, and thus my enthusiasm to try them all.     \n\nTropical Four - This flavor was really creamy and rich. It tasted strongly of bananas. \nCantaloupe - I like cantaloupe as a fruit and melons in general. I especially like the deep, penetrative sweetness of cantaloupe. The ice cream version was not too sweet but very refreshing. \nCherimoya Tango - Marked as a new flavor, this one had something about its taste that was very interesting. It has this twist like the name suggests that is hard to describe.\nHalo Halo - I like the chunks and combination of flavors.\nPear - I had a difficult time tasting any pear. \n\nI ended up getting a scoop of the CANTALOUPE. I have to say the service is superb. My server was very patient with me and considerate. (I was dying of thirst and he gave me a big cup full of water.) The scoop I had started out fine.

(I've been thinking about the grasshopper pie ever since!!). The baby coconut had small chewy chunks of (baby) coconut in the ice cream.\n\nThe other contestants in the pint contest included Bi-Rite (salted caramel), Three Twins (mexican chocolate), Humphrey Slocombe (blue bottle vietnamese coffee) and Salt & Straw (almond brittle w/ salted ganache).\n\nWe were all very pleasantly surprised by Mitchell's baby coconut. Thought it might've been overpowered by some of the other stronger flavors in the mix, but everyone loved it. Can't wait to go back and try more flavors!!", "author": "Cal C."}

I try to get a different flavor every time I go to Mitchell's, so this time I got Mitchell's Halo-halo. Halo-halo is mongo beans and sweet beans, buko, langka, ube, pineapple, kaong (palm fruit), evaporated milk, shaved ice, with their ice cream. They only serve this from Spring - Fall, so really, this means that it's an awesome summer flavor. My server also gave me a giant scoop, so shout outs to him!\n\nI personally really liked the Halo-Halo, It was a nice level of sweet and I enjoyed every bit of the different toppings such as the sweet beans, pineapple, etc. I try not to get the same flavor I've had before but Halo-Halo might change my mind.\n\nMitchell's is an awesome ice cream store, and I would honestly recommend it to anyone and everyone.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

Before arriving, I was a little worried that it'll be super packed with lines wrapping around the block as it was prime after dinner dessert time - luckily, the crowd waiting wasn't too bad as there were only a dozen people before me! FYI they service you based on your number so immediately upon arrival, make sure you head inside and grab a number from the ticketing machine. Yes, I'm sure you're probably wondering that they're a little extra making you wait for ice cream this way, but trust me, it's so worth it. Also, make sure you stay inside the store because the employees plow through announcing numbers very quickly, so if you're not paying attention / walk away, they will skip you. So be prepared to wave your hand in the air like a maniac when called! Plus, standing inside allows you to stare immensely at the menu as it's huge - the wait time didn't help me as I just wanted to sample everything. \n\nFortunately, they're super generous with samples, portion wise and quantity wise. Indecisive me asked for 4 samples - halo halo, the acclaimed ube, chocolate salted caramel to name the 3 I remembered. Ultimately I went with the halo halo and chocolate salted caramel as the ube didn't impress me at all - a little shocked this is the fan favorite. I easily think the halo halo is so much better as there's more flavors, but none overpowered the other, making each distinct flavor in there their own star.

There was Mexican Chocolate paired with Thin Mint for the pint, and while the Thin Mint was acceptable, the Mexican Chocolate was not Mexican enough for me! I also sampled the regular chocolate they had, and it's overhyped. The texture is off, the flavor lacks that chocolate punch you're supposed to get, and quite honestly Ben & Jerry's in the stores is even better than Mitchell's chocolate. \n\nExperience: As other reviews have said, you have to take a number when arriving, so don't look confused when you see a bunch of people just randomly standing around outside  with nothing in their hands but apparently waiting for something lmao.

They have a pull number system and so many people swarm the counter when it's not their turn and it just slows the whole process down. People also bring up an entire party of maybe 6 people and each have several samples which also drags it out. I think if their was a line people would have some sense of urgency and not just take their time. It would also be more orderly. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes, if not an hour for your turn.

With the plethora of ice cream places in SF, we knew we wanted to try a new ice cream place during this past visit. Mitchell's is different from most ice cream places for the unique flavors they produce such as ube and spumoni, but they also have original flavors as well. \n\nStorefront is pretty big for an ice cream shop in SF. They even have a tiny parking lot in the back, although you're probably better off looking for street parking a block or two away. Remember that the minute you walk in, grab a ticket from the machine so that you're able to get your ice cream as soon as possible. Once they call your number, a worker will serve your entire party. Workers are extremely nice and patient, allowing you to sample multiple flavors. \n\nThere are a variety of ice cream choices such as shakes or ice cream in tubs to-go, but we stuck with the basic ice cream in cones/cups. Scoops can be junior sized, single, double or triple. Junior is about $2.50 or so, and is definitely enough if you just want a small treat. \n\nFlavors: \n-Strawberry: very basic and original. Exactly how I expected this to taste. Solid flavor if you want to stick to something original. \n\n-Mango: reminiscent of the Asian melona melon bars. Loved the light and refreshing taste of the mango. Not too heavy and could really taste the mango flavor. \n\n-Toasted coconut: my dad really liked this favor, but I thought it wasn't sweet enough. Could really taste the coconut though.\n\n-Ube: a big fan of this flavor! After trying it out, I knew I had to get it for myself. Very subtly purple yam flavor with just the right amount of sweetness. Would order this again!\n\nAll scoops can be in a cup or waffle/sugar cone. Sugar cone was amazing - could taste the subtle almond flavor of the crispy cone. \n\ntl;dr - should really try to come to Mitchell's if you're into ice cream and haven't tried this place yet. Really recommend the ube or mango!", "author": "Tiffany C."}

The line is always out the door and Mitchell's always exceeds our expectations when it comes flavors, consistency and service. Be sure to grab a number at the door upon arriving too. They call out numbers to get served and I missed the red number machine the first time I visited Mitchell's. Service is always friendly and helpful. Also be sure to ask for a taste or sample of your favorite flavors or seasonal temptations. Tonight we ordered 3 milkshakes, one triple scoop waffle cone, one two scoop waffle cone and one water- the price came to around $30.

If it's green color I won't eat it because if you mash up a real pistachio, is it actually green??? I don't know bc I've never done it but I don't feel like it's natural for a natural girl like me (I like to keep my eyebrows as thick as they're going to grow on a Korean girl like me for the best natural girl look).

When I got here I didn't realize it was a number ticket system like the slowly dreadful DMV. Anyways, long story short, I grabbed a number and chit chatted outside because it was super busy. I think I was so engaged in my conversation on the phone that I didn't realize my number was skipped because when I looked back, my number had passed. (Completely my fault, I know).\n\n  I walked up to one of the employees, who's name was Nestor, and told him my situation. He then provided me with excellent customer service and helped me right away. Because I thought maybe I might have had to grab another number and wait all over again. And while he was helping me, he was chatting it up with me and I learned he's a native as well because there's not many of us around anymore. He also let me sample a few flavors and I loved the coconut buco? (Spelling error) So that's the flavor I got.

If you're not from around the area (like we were), it might be easy to pass by the place if there's no line. We really only noticed it because of the small crowd gathered by the shop. Find some street parking OR park in the small lot around the corner. \n\nSomehow I missed the memo about getting a number. (I know, I know, everyone talks about it on Yelp - how did I miss it?!) I really think they should put a sign up front to get a number to minimize confusion when it's busy. We came on a Sunday after lunch so we waited probably like 10 min to be called. The reason why I knocked my rating down to 4 stars (3.5 but rounded up) is because of the craziness and lack of order. People cram into the little shop when their number is no where near to being called. People try to look at the actual ice cream containers instead of looking up to see the flavors. And people trying to pay for their ice cream all at the same time. Why?! WHY HAVENT THEY FIGURED OUT A BETTER SYSTEM? Also - idk, the service could've been better. You're serving ice cream, so would it kill you to smile and try to hide the annoyance you have?\n\nBut with that said, I actually loved the ice cream. I didn't try a lot (mostly because I was annoyed with the crowd), but the flavors I did try were satisfying. I love that they have an array of flavors. Especially love the Filipino flavors - macapuno ftw! I ended up going with horchata because I'm a San Diegan who can't imagine a world without good Mexican food. So good! Not too sweet. \n\nThe ice cream itself was really the saving grace for this place.

Don't be surprised when you expect yourself to wait a while to finally get your turn! Remember to grab a paper number to get in the queue!  AND it's cash only.\n\nMitchell's has a huge variety of ice creams. Seriously, a huge HUGE variety.  Whether you just want the plain standard flavors, go for a tropical/ethnic flavor, try a seasonal/holiday flavor, or you may want to explore your options and get one with a whole bunch of different toppings in it, that's cool too! I love that they have so different options- the only problem is not knowing which one to pick. \nYou're welcome to sample flavors, the employees don't rush you when it's your turn.  I think they understand since you waited so long to get your number called, that they should spend a great amount of time with you if you want to try multiple flavors, have a big order, etc.  \n\nMind that there are a lot of families that visit Mitchell's, and it's just 1 long counter of display for their flavors.  So expect to say \"excuse me\" a lot to try to not be in any ones way and maneuver through the crowd.  \n\nMy favorite flavor of all time has to be grasshopper pie.  Seriously.

Mitchell's came up and so we decided to head out there! It was around 6:00 pm and the lines were out the door and circled around the street corner! We were doubtful if we actually wanted to stay and wait in line cause not only was it cold outside for our little one to wait an expected 45 minute, but also was doubtful if it was even worth it! So we came up with the idea to have my older son and husband wait in line while my younger son and I waited in the car! It was literally a 30 minute wait to order 3 scoops of ice cream and what seemed to be another 30 minute to get our order! Really is this place that good?\n\nAs far as the ice cream goes we ordered the Halo-Halo, Mango and Grasshopper scoop which the lady in the counter recommended as the 3 top flavors! Halo halo ice cream had a taste of the traditional Filipino dessert, Halo Halo which includes buko, langka, ube, pineapple, mongo beans, sweet beans and palm fruit bits. It was definitely yummy since I do love the traditional Halo halo and wasn't overwhelmed with all the different flavors mixed in! The grasshopper pie ice cream had Peppermint ice cream with chocolate chips, Oreo cookies and fudge swirls. Im not a fan of peppermint so to me it was just okay! Mango ice cream was just the traditional mango flavor like the one you can by at the stores! I don't even know why my husband wanted that flavor when its all some what taste the same! \n\nI wish i would have been the one to choose the flavors instead of my husband! Im sure I wouldve like the quality and flavors of the ice cream here! But i probably wouldnt want to waste an hour here just waiting around!", "author": "Charmaine D."}

Then I came here after dinner one evening with Nina Y. and we had so much time to spare because we had just eaten, and we were procrastinating on work. Of course.\n\nLuckily it was a decently nice evening outside, so we just chilled as we waited for our number to be called. The service here is quite speedy, and I like how unforgiving with numbers they are. If you're not ready to be called, they will skip over you. Yes!!! This is how it should be done. We waited about 30 to 40 minutes on a Sunday evening for our number to be called, enough time for our dinner to somewhat digest.\n\nThere's lots of ice cream flavors on the menu and different types of desserts to order. I really wanted a banana split, but there's no way I could have eaten that. Instead I settled for a Cookie Monster milkshake, which was probably just as much ice cream. It was quite tasty, but I should have gotten a single scoop of Oreo ice cream instead. Oh well.

I was lucky enough to meet the brother/sister owner combo, and they were just a joyful delight in discussing the different flavors available, and how they've kept the shop in their family since their father, Mr. Mitchell, founded the store himself. \n\nMaybe it's because this ice cream shop is located in the heart of one of the most diverse cities in the country, but there are a lot of different flavors you may expect to see in more niche local shop. Everything from Polynesian ube (purple yam) to lucuma (Peruvian fruit). And what's more, each flavor is well above average in terms of creaminess, and flavor profile. The different options available are all freshly made, and taste like they're made with portions of the real ingredient that host their namesake. Not like some other shops that use more artificial flavoring. \n\nOnly downside is (much like any place in SF) the lack of parking. Of course, this is an issue for any place in the entire city, and the fact that this is the biggest downside (and not price like many of the issues of silicon valley), is actually pretty commendable.\n\nSo keep on keeping on, and I hope your shop stays open for many more generations to come.", "author": "Daniel Z."}

For being one of SF's top places, I guess I was expecting a wow factor to be delivered among my palette, but to no avail. After dinner, my girlfriend and I had walked on over. The small shop was crowded. We grabbed a number and waited for ours to be called. We sampled a number of things and not many completely sold me. I went with the grasshopper and butterscotch marble and my gf went with ube - both our choices were things we normally love elsewhere so it helped that they happen to be some of the most popular flavors here. \n\nThe grasshopper was super minty but chocolately which I liked a lot! There's something about the refreshing and coolness of mint along with indulging in chocolate all at once that just makes an amazing combo. The butterscotch marble however was way too vanilla and not enough butterscotch. The real crime here was the ube. It didn't even deserve to be called ube! It had zero flavor to it and it definitely has no trace of ube to it either. It literally just felt like it was just unflavored ice. So disappointing!", "author": "Maleah M."}

I don't know what it is about this place, but I'm stuck on coming here regularly now. I kept hearing my partner and others refer to this as their go-to ice cream place growing up, but just didn't get it. Well, now I do, and now they've got me!\n\nSituated in cute little Bernal Heights area and right off Guerrero, this place is a little gem. For those brave hearts who like to drive, there's a very small lot in the back for customers. Otherwise, you must brave the world of parallel parking if you choose to venture here by car. \n\nSo here's how it goes: you come in and take a number as soon as possible. No one really tells you to do this, but you just infer by the others who are taking/glancing at their sheets of paper, anxiously awaiting their turn to devour this delicious dairy (and non-dairy) treats. By the time your number is called, hopefully you have used your time wisely to scope out all the flavors you would like to try (because, why not?) Finally, your number is called and you get to try all the delicious flavors that have made your mouth melt (since you have been checking out everyone else's treats- which is great use of your time). And you get to try all the mouth watering frozen goodies you like before choosing your selection. I've been able to try several different flavors that I probably never would have tried before. My favorites though are the Mexican chocolate, vanilla custard, ube, Lucuma, and the Butterscotch. But you honestly can't go wrong with any ice cream from here. And don't forget about the cones! They even have some that have been dipped in chocolate (and are Devine!)\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the excellent customer service! Seriously top notch and friendly and overall great. They really provide ice cream with a side of smile. \n\nSo for those wanting to know: yes, it's totally worth it (line and all), and you definitely won't regret it!", "author": "Tracy T."}

The only downside of this place is that there is no where to sit and enjoy!", "author": "Anne S."}

Instead of having a long line, you take a number and wait for yours to be called. Beware that it's definitely hard to find parking in this area and although Mitchell's does have a parking lot behind it that you could check out, it's on the smaller side and we weren't able to find any available spots.\n\nOn the Saturday night that I dropped by, Mitchell's was at about number 30 and the number I got was 80. Luckily, a kind soul had to leave and gave me his number so I ended up getting served at 60 but these 30 numbers took about 30-45 minutes. Keep in mind that not everyone who takes a number stays around to wait so it can be hit or miss with how long it'll take you to get served. There's a little counter on the wall that tells you what number they're currently on. \n\nWhen it was my turn, I tried the grasshopper pie, avocado, mango and passionfruit! Although the flavors are good (but not phenomenal), what really shone through about Mitchell's for me was the fluffiness and creaminess of the ice cream. It's really melt-in-your-mouth delicious!", "author": "Nancy T."}

Just the other night I had Peanut Butter Indulgence - yum!!! My favorite seasonal flavor is cantaloupe. \n\nYou can have the ice cream served in a couple of different ways  - in a cup, in a cup or waffle cone, cookie sandwich, sundae, or milkshake. They also have Filipino flavors and sell packs of ice cream as well. If you get your single scoop order in a cone, it's a large serving! \n\nOverall, very good.

It's my go-to ice cream shop when I'm in SF for a multitude of reasons: they have an expansive selection of flavors, the portions are generous, they use quality ingredients, the service is top-notch, and prices are super affordable.  \n\nAlthough there are some businesses in SF that actually carry Mitchell's, as well as specialty grocery stores that sell their products by the pint, I still prefer coming to their dedicated store location for the freshest ice cream.  I love how the staff isn't stingy about allowing customers samples because they totally understand that narrowing down your order is serious business and people need to make educated decisions.\n\nI've noticed they carry a lot of more \"exotic\" flavors such as ube, coconut, jackfruit, avocado, halo halo, etc. which are all made with ingredients imported from the Philippines. Although I can't speak to the ube/halo halo which seem to be pretty popular, the others are all fantastic, particularly the creamy avocado.  My default order, however, is the chocolate caramel crackle.

Not to mention, the establishment is tiny so you really have no choice but to eat your ice cream standing outside. But let's move on to the positives. \n\nMitchell's offers a variety of unique flavors. Some of my personal favorites are Mexican chocolate and ube. My cousin and I shared a triple scoop this time. We chose butterscotch, rum raisin, and Mexican chocolate (weird combo, I know). I'm a chocolate person, so the bottom scoop was clearly mine. It was delicious, of course. Rum raisin would probably be the next best tasting flavor out of the triple scoop that we got (IMO). You can taste a \"splash\" of rum. The butterscotch was okay. Not something I would get again as I don't really care of butterscotch. \n\nI'd love to come back to try the other flavors the next time I'm back in SF.", "author": "Courtney N."}

The Chocolate Caramel Crackle was sweet and decadent with the perfect blend of a darker chocolate and a bright caramel.  The crackle pieces added a nice crunchy texture to round out the ice cream.

It's a beloved favorite with years and years of ice cream making for its customers. And, even on a windy day in San Francisco, you can always expect there to be a line out the door.\n\nI've only heard of friends and family growing up in the area (I myself come from the suburbs in the East Bay), and Mitchell's Ice Cream is simply a favorite. It's creamy, milky, nice and whippy (not sure if that made sense) and serves up all your traditional flavors with some neat combinations and even your favorite Asian-influenced tropical flavors (props to my local Filipin@s).\n\nFirst things first, do NOT let the line out the door fool you. It's only because the shop is small and everyone has nowhere to wait. Grab a ticket number by the door and they'll call you soon (a 15-20 minute wait for my Saturday night visit). I used that time to scour the flavor board to see what I wanted... The Grasshopper (mint chocolate Oreo lovers), Espresso Toffee Crunch, Avocado, Ube, Coconut, Mango, Halo Halo (traditional Filipino delicacy of ube, coconut, pandan, mongo beans, etc.)... You will definitely find something just for what you're craving.\n\nThey work quick and everyone's whipping out ice creams and pints and shakes out the door. The scoops are pretty generous and thick and I found myself being very full after just a double scoop--one or two should be fine. The double was $5.35 I believe, but it's worth it for the flavor, visit and wait.\n\nWhen you are in the mood for ice cream, Mitchell's doesn't disappoint. Nothing extravagant, nothing new or contemporary or modern. It's simple ice cream with great flavors and a flooding customer fan base out the door. I don't tend to indulge as much as I should, but I let the guilt slide with this one!", "author": "Rachel Ann C."}

Don't get me wrong, I love Smitten and Bi-Rite, but if you want a large variety of flavors and are tired of paying $5 for a teeny scoop of ice cream, then you may want to add Mitchell's into your SF ice cream rotation.\n\nUsually the line is long, and you could be waiting 30 min for ice cream, but don't be discouraged when you get there and there seem to be 30 numbers ahead of you when they are calling out numbers. Sometimes people will come in a group of 2-3 people and then everyone takes a number, but then they all order together.\n\nThey have a ton of flavors that it may make your head spin. But that just means you'll have to make several trips here to try them all. They seem to have a lot of the classic flavors that you can't get at a lot of the specialty ice cream places, but then a lot of unique flavors via their seasonal or tropical flavors. They change out some of their flavors, but for the most part have about 40 to choose from, so you should be able to find something that you like. Some examples:\n\nStandard Flavors: Mint Chocolate Chip, Mocha Fudge, Peanut Butter Indulgence (Dark Chocolate with peanut butter swirls and chocolate covered peanut butter cups), Rocky Road, Strawberry, Thin Mint\n\nSeasonal Flavors: Peppermint, Eggnog, Pumpkin\n\nTropical Flavors: Triple 4 (Mango, Guava, Banana and Pineapple), Ube (Purple Yam), Lychee, Macapuno (coconut), Lucuma (Peruvian fruit), Langka (Jackfruit), Halo Halo (based on a traditional Filipino dessert), Avocado\n\nMy favorites are the Mint Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter Indulgence, and Lucuma. This is the only place in the city that I've found with Lucuma ice cream, and it's one of my favorites. You can't go wrong with any of them.\n\nYou can get ice cream to take home too in 1/2 gallons (in a freezer, already pre-packed, or they will hand-pack a quart, pint, 1/2 pint, or 1/2 gallon. They have sundaes and milkshakes, and you can get it cones or cups.\n\nCome here and be prepared to wait, most of the time outside since it's a small place, so dress accordingly with jackets.

The staff were extremely patient with me even though I keep asking for more samples. \n\nFood: The ice cream was creamy and flavorful. There were over 20 flavors to choose from! I ordered the ube (purple yam) and buko (young coconut) in a waffle bowl. I was not a fan of the waffle bowl; the waffle bowls were the ones from the packages (-0.5). The ube flavor here is prominent, unlike other ice cream places, and the buko ice cream have real coconut inside. Mitchell's serves quality ice cream because it was really smooth and had no ice crystals. I subtracted another 0.5 because I feel like although they had a lot of flavors, I feel like a lot of the flavors didn't appeal to me. Only the flavors from the tropical section seems interesting to me. 4/5 \n\nCustomer Service: Customer service was great! I was greeted with a big smile once my number was called. The person that help me was glad to give me a variety of samples when I couldn't decide on the flavor. 5/5\n\nOverall, I would give this place a 4.5/5 stars because of the waffle and the flavor options.

But it was very worth it. I really liked both flavors I got and am also satisfied with the amount. \n\nSETTING: The shop is located on a big street in Petro Hill. There isn't anything much going on in the neighborhood other than the Billy Goat Hill, which is 10-minutes walk away. There is NO seats/tables inside of the shop and only one small bench outside. \n\nOVERALL IMPRESSION: It's too bad that the shop is located in an isolated part of the city. Otherwise I would come here often to try out their other awesome flavors!", "author": "Wendy F."}

It's been a local staple since the 50s, but not many of the new tech people that have come into the city have tried it because of its location away from Downtown in Bernal Heights.\n\nThe wait is quite long and peak hours usually occur in the evening (it's open late until 11 PM). Don't be confused by the unorganized group of people outside the door. You need to go inside and take a number that gets called out when it's your turn to order. When I went at 9 PM, my number was 30 above the current number being called. People leave and that makes the line go faster, but I still had to wait about 35 minutes during the peak hour.\n\nThe ice cream is definitely worth it, though. The texture is more firm and feels more like a true ice cream compared to the other SF shops which go for novelty instead of tradition. The flavor selection is wonderful and Mitchell's also offers Filipino-flavored ice creams, which are quite difficult to find in the rest of the city. They also offer pints and ice cream cakes to take home.\n\nIf you are willing to wait in line for half an hour in the evenings, you will be rewarded with the best ice cream San Francisco has to offer.", "author": "Ramon Miguel F."}

It was an interesting academic experience, I guess, because I've never had ice cream like that, but I didn't particularly enjoy it.\n\nPut it like this -- even if I didn't have to wait behind that ungodly line, I wouldn't come back again.

They basically service one side of the city while Polly Ann's covers the other as far as \"Asian\" flavors go for ice cream. \n\nMy favorite is still Ube and Macapuno.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-20", "description": "Ordering ice cream from Mitchell's reminds me of ordering meat at some delis, since Mitchell's uses a take-a-number ticketing system to queue up customers. Instead of having a line wrapping around the block, you end up with patches of people waiting to be called. I like this system since it gives you some flexibility to roam around the neighborhood especially if Mitchell's is packed, but at the same time it adds some complexity because the consumer needs to wait for their number to be called. The queue moves pretty fast so this isn't really an issue. It'd be cool if Mitchell's upgraded their ticketing system to a wireless buzzer/queueing system, but that'd probably not be worth it for an ice cream shop.\n\nMitchell's has a wide array of flavors from something more simple like vanilla or strawberry to something more adventurous like horchata, buko(baby cocunut), lucuma(peruvian fruit), ube(phillipino purple yam dessert). I ordered the Grasshopper Pie  and Thai Tea. The Thai Tea tasted exactly like Thai Tea in a creamier form. The Grasshopper Pie is essentially a mashup of Cookies & Cream and Mint Chocolate Chip. The ingredients are mint ice cream with fudge, chocolate chip, and oreos. If you have large sweet tooth, you can always buy tubs of ice cream to take home.\n\nThere's still a lot of interesting flavors for me to try out and it's great to see that Mitchell's continues to innovate by introducing new flavors like horchata. I hope to be back again soon.", "author": "Anthony S."}

Remember, get that number, don't stand outside waiting only to invest time before realizing there's a \"system\" you need to adhere to.\n\nThey have so many flavors, many are unique, making this a cool boutique ice cream parlor.  Many restaurants and stores even tout \"we serve Mitchell's ice cream\" so you know it's good if it's branded in that fashion.\n\nThe favorite flavor I have here is called \"Tropical 4\" which is a blend of: Banana, Mango, Pineapple and Guava ice cream all in one.\n\nThey used to (maybe still do) make Ice Cream Cakes too.\n\nIt's a nice location on San Jose Avenue, easy to get to, sometimes difficult for parking (since the place is rather small yet very popular anytime of the day, regardless of weather).\n\nKids love this place too of course!", "author": "Rick S."}

There was langka (Jack Fruit), Ube (purple yam), mango (mango, duh), and many others that slip my mind at the moment.\n\nI was being \"boring\" and chose a regular caramel with a chocolate dipped and nuts waffle cone. \n\nWe enjoyed our ice cream on the bench just outside and it got busy/packed really quickly and it seemed like the staff was able to handle the rush with no problem.

It felt like I must have tried more than a half dozen flavors before I decided to take a pint of Halo-Halo ice cream home and a scoop of Mango for the road. All of the flavors that I tried (ube, avocado, pumpkin, macapuno, buco...) halo halo and mango seemed like the best.

Some lunatic in our group said he wanted a chocolate dipped cone AND a shake, but couldn't decide. So naturally, we asked if Nestor could make the shake, and dip the cup (of the shake) in chocolate, so the lunatic could lick the cup.\n\nThis sounds ridiculous, but Nestor laughed and told us he'd see what he could do. Not only did he offer to fulfill such a ridiculous request, he came through with flying colors. This thing was literally perfect. The cup filled with milkshake was perfectly dipped in a chocolate shell - Nestor wasn't sure what to call it, so the lunatic in the group named it \"The Boomer\".\n\nAside from a bit of a wait, the experience was fantastic.

I wasn't very impressed with the grasshopper flavor which everyone seems to rave about, but I was very impressed with all of the tropical fruit options they had. \n\nI tried the mango, which was good, but I decided to go with the buka (baby coconut) and the macapuna (sweet coconut). These were both delicious and reminded me a lot of haupia flavor which you find in Hawaii. \n\nOverall, I think they have good, but not great ice cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-09", "description": "I don't usually review a place immediately after I've tried it, but when I do, you know it's hella amazing.\n\nTo be honest, I was a bit skeptical when my friend told me there was a place in SF that rivaled Bi-Rite. I mean how can there be a place that's better than the one and only?\n\nBut after looking at the reviews of Mitchell's I knew I had to check it out. \n\nIronically, this ice cream parlor is located not far from Bi rite. You can get there with a 5 min drive down dalores. It's a small shop in San Jose avenue and you will definitely not miss it with the line of people outside.\n\nLuckily I came at a good time around 2 when people barely started to trickle in. The first impression I got of Mitchell's was: this really does feel like an ice cream parlor. Kids were running around, there were decorations on the wall, etc. but the sickest part was probably their ticket system! You don't have to wait in line.\n\nThe one thing that did turn me off though was the vibe I got from the service. Not sure if it was an odd day, but I didn't really feel like the employees were happily engaging with customers. I wanted to take my time deciding on a flavor but I was a bit scared to test their patience. I definitely was afraid to ask to sample. Nevertheless I settled on UBE.\n\nUBE IS NOW LIFE! That's how great it tasted. Who knew that purple yam in ice cream form could taste so legit. Gone was any hesitation about this place. Mitchell's is legit and I'll probably come back soon to try other items.\n\nAll in all, this place is equally comparable to bi rite from a first experience. The UBE was simple yet orgasmic and I can't wait to try their other stuff. What I like about bi rite however is their interesting assortment of flavors and their welcoming atmosphere- something I couldn't find here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-17", "description": "Wow! 5 stars no doubt!\n\nTo be honest, when it comes to nice ice cream place in SF I only hear about Bi-Rite most of the time. I'm not a person who likes to follow the nom, so after I moved to SF I have been asking around people what's their favorite ice cream store is. The name Mitchell comes up once in a while, so decided to give it a try.\n\nMitchell is located on San Jose avenue; from yelp review I was afraid that I would see a super long line the day I went but it turned out only 2 people were ahead of me. I guess I was lucky then. It was a pretty chilling Monday night around 7:30pm though.\n\nSo what you need to do first is to grab a number (machine on your left next to the door when you walk into the shop) and wait for your number to be called. There were a lot of flavors displayed in the fridge, and I swear I tried like 6 flavors; I said sorry to the guy who was helping me and he's all cool with it.\n\nSo I ended up choosing Ube and Halo-halo.\n\n-) Ube: A. That was great! Ube means (or at least it's made of) purple yam, and according to their website it's imported from Philippines. It is sweet, but not artificial sugar type of sweet, it's a deep kind of sweet that you will only feel it at the back of your throat. Some may wonder this is similar to taro but they are completely different. Ube flavor that Mitchell serves is so much fresher. \n\n-) Halo-halo: A. So this is actually the name of a famous Filipino dessert, and is a mixture of jackfruit, sweet potato, pineapple, lychee, ube (info from the staff there) plus some beans and other stuff, and Mitchell makes a flavor out of it. Personally I have never tried Halo-halo dessert alone, but I can just say the flavor taste so good. The fact that halo-halo does have Ube in it may confuse you when you eat them together; but halo-halo has got a lot more interesting tastes to it since it's made up of so many different ingredients. I would say it's around 80% sweet and 20% sour, and it's unlike any other ice-cream flavors I have tasted before. Highly recommend this flavor.\n\nMan, there are so many different flavors to choose from and I can't wait to go back and try each single one of them already. But the Ube and Halo-halo are so good that I'm not sure if I can skip these next time!", "author": "Simon C."}

You can get 1/2 a gallon of ice cream for 10.50 or about 2.90 for a junior scoop. There's limited parking in the area, so try the back first, then around the block to find some parking. There's quite a few flavors that I love here, one is the ginger snap ice cream which is cinnamon ice cream with gingersnap cookie mixed in. Next the oreo is great, and also the chocolate chip. You can also order sundaes, milk shakes etc. But the most worthy one is definitely the 1/2 gallon. My boyfriend and I enjoy late night dates here to grab dessert!", "author": "Amy Y."}

When we drove by we saw the crowd waiting outside. Good sign . And good thing the owners of Mitchell's had the goods sense to use a numbering system , so you don't have to queue up in a horrible line !  Anyway our number was 21... They were calling out number 82 ...! It took about 30 minutes  before we were served . The wait actually didn't feel long because we weren't In a hurry and everyone else Waiting around were pretty cool and friendly.  It gave me time to really study the menu to figure out what what samples I wanted to try and order. They didn't have crazy out of universe flavors, however they did have a good number of tropical flavors to go along with the more traditional ones . I ended up sampling the mango , avocado , tropical four, and ube. All were very good . I settled on my Mexican chocolate single scoop on a sugar cone. It was so delicious !! I could really taste the cinnamon and rich dark cocoa ! Yum !   Quality, fresh ingredients, friendly service , and a simple back in the day feel . Gotta love Mitchell's :)", "author": "Brenda B."}

If you pass Mitchell's on the right hand side and turn right and then the immediate right is the entrance to the lot.  There are probably about 10 spaces.  We went on a cold and dreary monday afternoon and there were plenty of spaces and no line.\n\nATMOSPHERE: It reminded me of a rite-aid ice cream place with those old menu boards and the ice cream in tubs for you to choose from.  No seating inside and only two benches outside so you better go on a day where it's warm enough to sit outside or enjoy it in your car.\n\nWAIT: Went on a Monday afternoon and there was no wait.  It was kind of weird because I wasn't sure who was supposed to help me and started talking to another guy who said he couldn't help me.  Waited and then another guy came and took my order.\n\nFOOD:\n\nThe single scoop $3.20 is pretty small if you're used to big scoops.  It was just enough for me but I can imagine if you really like the flavors and ice cream you'd go for the double scoop.  \n\nGRASSHOPPER PIE - It's mint ice cream with chocolate chips and oreo cookies and fudge swirls.  The ice cream was on the creamy side, which was already a negative for me.  Also, the mint didn't have that refreshing and fresh mint taste like Coolhaus or other places has.  The oreo bits were too chunky and not spread enough.  It was OK mint chocolate chip ice cream with a random oreo bit here and there.  I think I like my ice cream to be icy and refreshing like at scoops - but I didn't feel that after eating this one.\n\nOverall - I realized that everyone has different ice cream they like, so I don't think my review should dissuade those of you who like creamy ice cream or want flavors like Ube, because 4.5 stars can't be wrong.  It just wasn't the ice cream for me.", "author": "Brittany T."}

They were also nice enough to put a pint of Thai tea together for us as well. They have a lot of Asian/Filipino flavors, and the ube was better than expected for me. I don't know why I wasn't expecting much, but I'd never had ube flavored anything before, and yam didn't sound that appealing. But, it was good! The ice cream itself is really good, but I am more enticed by the flavors at Bi-Rite and Humphry Slocombe.\n\nThey've got a small parking lot that fits about 5-10 cars but during peak hours, you'll have to drive around for parking. As others have suggested, if you have more than 1 person in your group, drop someone off to get in line and get a number to save time. We first drove by around 2-2:30pm and there weren't that many people, but after going to get groceries first and then coming back, the line was out the door!

I don't get how the workers can stand being in there all day with all those people huddled up like caged chickens. Props to them for doing what they do. There are really no frills at Mitchell's, just good old fashion ice cream. The hardest part is trying to figure out which flavors to order. There's just too many to options that one visit isn't sufficient. This family owned business has been around since 1953 for a good reason.", "author": "Smitcha B."}

My friends and I came here on a Sunday night and there was a huge crowd waiting outside--uniquely, this ice cream shop offers \"take-a-number\" service, and customers are called to the counter in sequence. We ended up waiting a good 30-40 minutes, and I got to sample a couple different selections. The most unique flavors here are definitely the tropical ones (mango, ube, banana, halo-halo), and I would certainly recommend them. I chose to have the tropical four (combination of banana, guava, mango, and pineapple) and got the junior size (the smallest they have), which was actually more ice cream than I expected to get for the $2.85 price tag! The ice cream was very good and reminded me of my childhood, when my parents brought tubs of Mitchell's mango ice cream home for me.

I'm sure it's way more crowded on the weekends, so duh, plan accordingly. I see a lot of people have complained about the wait. But hellooooo when the product is good, shouldn't you expect crowds?\n\nThank goodness for the little wait once we arrived, because my husband was panicking while making a decision! Mango? Mexican hot chocolate? Banana split? Peach (seasonal for summer only)? They even serve halo halo!! OH THE DRAMA! I tried the macapuno and got one scoop in a cup. My husband tried one scoop of the ube. Both flavors were awesome (my macapuno definitely won though--real coconut pieces? WINNING). Wish we tried more flavors but we were just too excited to get our ice cream. \n\nWe will probably be back this weekend for more (I have my eye on that Mexican hot chocolate and secretly wish my husband chose that)...and then bring back half a gallon of a pre-packed macapuno :)", "author": "Monica T."}

Be warned this is not your average Rite-Aid/Dreyer's/Haagen Dazs ice cream. Your mind will be blown.\n\nWe came after dinner so arrived around 10:30pm and there was a long line out the door which was a good sign! First thing when you walk in, make sure u grab a # since there is no single file line order thing goin on. One of the workers will call your # and be your personal ice cream scooper servant. We literally sampled every flavor there was until past closing and STILL didn't know what flavors we wanted 'cause all of them were so damn good!!\n\nThe ice cream here tastes so rich and yummy, I believe their 16% butterfat base is the key to the deliciousness. It sounds so unhealthy, but tasted so good. I'd list every flavor we tried and describe how amazing each was, but it'd be too long. I ended up getting a scoop of grasshopper pie and a scoop of halo halo in a cup. We got the Macapuno & Rocky road in a waffle cone.\n\nI'm a big mint chip fan so I LOVED grasshopper pie (peppermint ice cream with chocolate chips, Oreo Cookies and fudge swirls). There were plenty of pieces of oreo cookies in every bite. Such a great mixture. The Halo Halo was really good as well. You'll definitely taste the ube & red bean in it along w/ the buko (coconut).\n\nThe macapuno (sweet coconut) was good, but a little to sweet for me. I prefer buko (coconut, but less sweet) so that you could taste more of a coconut flavor. The rocky road was one of the best we've had and believe me my boy knows his rocky road! Loads of fresh marshmallows with walnuts\n\nHighly recommend the above flavors for your first visit. The ube (full of taro flavor) , Kahlua mocha (best coffee flavored ice cream I've ever tried) , and toasted almond (MUST TRY, sweet vanilla/almondy) were also just as good.\n\nMy big tip is don't be like us and try every flavor even though it's so tempting because at the end we pretty much were full from sampling so many flavors and had sugar overload which was not a good feeling.

When they called us up, I tried a handful of samples. I wasn't a fan of the halo halo and the frozen fruit inside of it. I liked the white pistachio, but ultimately, my friend and I decided to get the ube (purple yam) and kahlua mocha cream. \n\nNot quite sure if that combo worked well, but each ice cream on its own is pretty yummy. The kahlua mocha cream is a delicious coffee flavored ice cream, and even the worker was excited for me to try it! Hands down, the best coffee ice cream, he said.

I came here on a Friday night after dinner and it was fairly busy with some people waiting outdoors. Unlike most ice cream places, you grab a ticket with a number on it and wait to be called instead of waiting in a line. I've always had Mitchell's ice cream in their half gallon containers which were bought from supermarkets such as 99 Ranch and they've always been a solid choice for their mango, ube, and other fruity flavors. I found the ice cream at their shop to be just as good as I sampled multiple flavors and settled on their tropical four flavor which is a combination of guava, mango, banana, and pineapple. The consistency of the ice cream tastes less dense and creamy yet more heavy than other popular ice cream spots in the bay area. All in all, I enjoyed the ice cream very much and would recommend Mitchell's to those who love fruity and tropical flavors.", "author": "Joshua M."}

Now, if you are in the opposite end of that spectrum, dive right in.  They have exotic flavors like Thai tea, halo halo- translates to mix mix, a traditional Filipino dessert consisting of sweetened beans, garbanzos, young coconut & mung beans mixed in with ube (a purple sweet potato) ice cream.  They have horchata, mango and avocado.  I highly recommend this spot if you are visiting San Francisco.  It's out of the way from tourist spots, but well worth checking it out.  They have a large selection of pre-packed half-gallon tubs that you can also purchase.  They can also pack containers for you if they don't have what you want pre-packed.  \n\nService- the servers are just so wonderful.  They always make us feel like we are the only customer in the store they are assisting at that moment.  Not to say that they take their sweet ol' time and ignore other guests.  They are efficient, friendly and don't rush you to make you feel like you are taking too long.  This is especially important for me because my son has severe nut allergies so we always have to be careful and make specific requests about his order.  Check em' out next time you are in the area.

Something new to me since I'm used to \"waiting in line\" - but I guess this works out as well. What amazes me is the drive-thru service offered behind the building.

That explains the long lines but as you already know, just grab a ticket and patiently wait your turn while tiptoeing to get a glimpse of the cavalcade of choices on display through the glass.\n\n\n- - - STANDARD FLAVOURS - - -\n\nAvocado:  3.5 stars\nMitchell's churns these fat fruit into its usual creamy perfection as we might expect, but perhaps in committing to avocadic authenticity, this flavour treads a too-familiar circuit on our tastebuds and cannot shake its vegetal roots long enough to convince me that it has reformed itself entirely into a trifling sweet.\n\nBuko:  5 stars\nI prefer this young coconut flavour to Macapuno (sweet coconut) as its appeal endures throughout a full scoop.\n\nCaramel Praline:  4.5 stars\n*Rolls eyes heavenward*\n\nChocolate Caramel Crackle:  3.5 stars\nI have no particular love for chocolate-based flavours, and this one did not wow me.\n\nGrasshopper Pie:  5 stars\nPerfect creamy mint flavour with hearty chunks of chocolate and Oreo cookies in it. Most of my non-Asian friends beeline for this one.\n\nHalo-Halo:  4.5 stars\nThe granddaddy of Mitchell's flavours, sitting atop as the durian (king of fruit) of its tropical selection.  A purple ube base bursts with a rainbow of chewy goodies - sweet beans, coconut chunks, and rubbery palm fruit (attap-chee), all of whose forebears have graced the decks of the shaved-ice ship that have melted down many a Southeast Asian's dripping hot days.\n\nLangka (Jackfruit): 5 stars\nSurprisingly, this tastes very creamy and vanilla-y and only carries a smooth undercurrent (and a few tiny chunks) of the bright-tasting tropical jackfruit. But that may be for the best, because Mitchell's has styled their jackfruit flavour as a timeless classic, a universal favourite, absolutely brilliant. It's a little black dress of ice cream flavours; it's the new strawberry; pairing well with any other flavour.\nI bought a half-gallon--because prepacked is the only form you can get this flavour in--and was assuming I would have to donate most of it to my office, but now I can (frighteningly) see myself finishing the whole thing... and it will be worth it.\n\nMango:  4.5 stars\nIf you only like one tropical flavour, it's probably this one.\n\n\n---- SPECIAL FLAVOURS ----\n\nKeke's Krunch: 3.5 stars\nThis one is new in 2015, big chunks of delicious toffee in caramel ice-cream. A bit too much candy for me though.\n\nPeach (Summer): 3.5 stars\nNot bad, but something was a little off. Peach is a difficult flavour to translate well to a dairy dessert, I think.\n\n\n---- CONES AND OTHER SIDE CONCERNS ----\n\nTheir waffle cones are superb, crisply cradling their precious cargo up to me in a most pleasing sacrifice.\n\n\n\nI'll have to come back soon for the Horchata, Lychee, French Custard Vanilla, Rum and Raisin, and ice cream sandwiches...  for starters.", "author": "Letitia L."}

It was conveniently located near big lots, Walgreens and only a mile down the street. I also figured bi rite would be even more packed and I just don't like long lines. \n\nWait time: was helped within 2 minutes ! Came on a Tuesday at 1:30 PM. I'm assuming lunch time and any time around 4 and later would be crowded. If there's people, grab a number right by the entrance. (I was a noob and failed to see it. I was looking for it at front like where delis would usually have em) \n\nService: super friendly. A nice young man said I can try as many flavors as I wanted. After telling him it was my first time, he attempted to help and answered my questions with what's popular. \n\nSAMPLED: \nUbe- a sweet purple yam. Super popular in the Filipino culture. I never tired and always wanted to. It was sweet, creamy, smooth. Probably needed more than one sample to really get how it tasted like considering it was my first time. \n\nGinger spiced- not get it if you're expecting flavors similar to gingerbread, or holiday ginger cookies. This sampling made me acknowledge how they use real ingredients and its definitely fresh made. It tastes like real ginger (yknow, the ones used in cooking) sweetened. You feel the grated ginger in the consistency of the ice cream. I don't like the taste of ginger on its own really, so I passed. \n\nGrasshopper pie- the famous order, according to Yelp. I LOVE mint ice cream, but I'm not a fan of super chocolatey things. (Ben&jerrys mint cookie is amazing) but I gave it a try anyways. I see why people who love do like the chocolate aspect would enjoy this. The chocolate fudge mixed in there is in thick chunks, but still smooth and rich. The ice cream itself was creamy and not overly minty. \n\nToasted almonds- nice clean flavor. The real almond flavor really come through--not the intense almond extract flavor you often experience in a boba Almond Milk Tea or the Yellow Asian almond cookies. But if you snacked on almonds as Regular as me, it's probably nothing too special. \n\nBurbon swirl- meh. A spin on vanilla . \n\nWhat I got! - banana!!! It's SO good. It's perfect. It's creamy, sweet, but not like super ripened banana with massive amounts of black dots everywhere. It tastes so natural . The milk/vanilla (?) really balanced it out . You SEE the tiny banana pieces pureed in the ice cream, and you can feel the tiny specs  of bananas. \n\nI got it on a sugar cone ^_^ cause The best part of eating ice cream is licking it off of a cone.", "author": "Debby T."}

I guess third times a charm. \n\nFrom all the reviews it sounded like ube and grasshopper pie was the way to go. However, I really did not like ube and grasshopper was nothing special. Just tasted like mint cookies and cream. Instead I got buko (young coconut) and mango. These were very yummy! \n\nSo when you arrive you don't just wait in line you have to grab a number. It's like the DOL except the line goes rather quickly. Thank goodness! \n\nSmall place so not a lot of room to wait inside.

Mitchell's has always been deemed the best, so I was stoked to finally try them out.\n\nThe wait is actually a good thing, for it allows you plenty of time to digest the huge list of flavors and form a game plan. I picked a couple flavors to try and also got a chance to see what everyone else was ordering. \n\nIn the end I decided on their tropical ice cream choices, which are outstanding and as unique as you'll see at any ice cream spot.

I decided I didn't like either of their tones. Then my sister told me to turn into the exit of the parking lot, and I nearly ran smack into someone's mini van. I circled the block and then drove right into the exit again, which caused me to park the vehicle like Ray Charles. My once-excellent parking karma is now officially destroyed, I'm pretty sure. If I had been in a better mood, I would have simply been pleased that there was a parking lot at all.  I mean, have you ever tried to park around the Swensen's in Russian Hill on a Saturday evening? \n\nWhen we exited the vehicle, I was, um, not happy. It was 10:00 p.m. It was freezing outside. Yet, there was a line so long at Mitchell's, you'd think they were giving ice cream away. I had not been to Mitchell's before, so I didn't know about the ticket system. Therefore, I stood in the line winding outside the door waiting to get inside the door. I love my sister to death, and you know this, but I asked her about 4 times how this system worked because there appeared to be two lines (one for pre-packed and one for dine-in), but she did not answer the question. Then this lady comes up right behind me, reaches over my shoulder, and snatches a ticket, and then proceeds to play stupid about it. \n\nYou know, I realize that people are inclined to behave like jackasses sometimes, but I find this particular breed of conduct especially reprehensible. And she looked like one of those ladies that, you know, has a \"coexist\" sticker on her car and attends city arts and lectures.  Are you really going to cut in line? Because that is all that is, plain and simple. And playing stupid doesn't excuse it. This also happens quite a bit at Genova in Oakland. I hope she knows that her ticket karma is ruined due to her snatching and cutting. She is lucky I didn't go Sonny Corleone on her. \n\nAnyhow, when it was finally our turn, I realized I *may have been overreacting, as our wait was the total of 5 minutes. I ordered the grasshopper flavor, my sister ordered some caramel flavor, and her daughter ordered the strawberries and cream. This ice cream is damn fine quality. I must say, however, that the strawberries and cream was the best flavor out of those we collectively ordered. The grasshopper was the least greatest choice, but that's okay, because I was clearly not behaving anyway. \n\nThree individual scoops were under $10. Don't forget to tip. And don't cut in line, because what if I'm behind you?", "author": "Sunny S."}

Lines attract people, and make lines even longer.  This holds true especially for Mitchell's Ice Cream.  There is always a horde of people every single night.  I pass by here quite often on my way to work, and it never ceases to amaze me how people love ice cream.  \n\nI once purchased an ice cream cake from here, and it was quite good.  The thing that is unique about this place is that they have a ticketing system in order to figure out who orders next (like at a meat shop you see in movies).  I find that this is more efficient because otherwise it would be chaos in forming a uniform line to place an order.  I ordered a single scoop of cantaloupe in a waffle cone.  A regular cone costs no extra, but waffle cones and sugar cones cost extra.  I would consider sampling flavors first before committing yourself to one flavor.  The cantaloupe was tasty, and had bits of real fruit mixed in with the ice cream.  \n\nAll in all, Mitchell's serves up some good tasting ice cream.  However, the line is quite ridiculous.  Lines at Bi-Rite, Humphrey's, and Smitten are not even as bad as here.  Then again, Mitchell's serves more conventional ice cream.  They sell \"normal\" ice cream flavors.  The others are more for hipsters, with their unique (weird)  flavors such as curry and bourbon.", "author": "Victor L."}

I came in on a random weekday night.. around 9 pm. The brick and mortar was packed with folks coming in left and right. This is probably the first ice cream shop in which I had to grab a ticket and wait for my number to be called. I felt a bit helpless in deciding on which flavors to settle upon. I was totally in the mood for a warm and decadent brownie fudge sundae. But to my dismay, they didn't have that on the menu. I also didn't want to continuously sample every flavour in the bin. So I made the brave decision and settled upon the toasted almond ice cream and the espresso toffee ice cream. I felt a bit rebellious in choosing a caffeinated flavored ice cream at night - but it was totally worth it. Being a chocoholic, I asked for hot fudge to be smothered on my ice cream. I was given two large scoops of ice cream that was swimming in hot fudge sauce. Oh my gosh, totally worth every bite! Mitchell's ice cream is super fluffy, creamy, and fresh. I ate every bite possible in my cup. So glad to have ventured down here in the Mission and try Mitchell's. The best ice cream spot in San Francisco! You'll be hooked like a sugar hooker.

With the huge crowds, you can imagine how terrible parking was; especially when it was limited to street parking and a tiny one-way parking lot with less than ten spots. Huge drag!\n\nOnce we found parking, we walked towards the store and it did not take much time for us to realize that people were holding numbered tickets. We slithered our way through the crowd and towards the door. The \"Take A Number\" dispenser was immediately to the left as we walked in. As we grabbed 175, we heard 132 being called over the intercom and I thought, wow...FML!\n\nThere were a lot of employees working and so customers were being serviced as quickly as possible. I personally thought that a line outside would have been less hectic than the number system, because everyone was waiting everywhere. There were people standing inside, shoulder-to-shoulder, and as people's numbers were called, they'd try to push through the crowd. Our wait was a little over 35 minutes.\n\nI went with two scoops of their ube ice cream on a sugar cone (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mitchells-ice-cream-san-francisco?select=dlHQE_3RlGo2NzFPANVhzg#dlHQE_3RlGo2NzFPANVhzg) and my friend went with a scoop of coconut pineapple and a scoop of avocado on a regular cone (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mitchells-ice-cream-san-francisco?select=Kf5o367G3_zJRgQ_HKR0aw#PmE5ty6Saea-u7fE3UFEgA). I really liked that they had tropical flavors, including the popular Filipino dessert, halo-halo; however, my ube was not very fresh. It had that \"old\" ice cream taste--as though it had been refrigerated for quite some time. The consistency was also very heavy and dense. I had a few bites (or licks) of my friends avocado and coconut pineapple and those flavors were much more pleasant. I've never had avocado ice cream before and it was surprisingly very rich, buttery, and good. \n\nMitchell's is one of those places that I can say that I've tried, but I genuinely would not come back.

My boyfriend and I decided we needed something sweet to clean our palate after some salty hot pot earlier that evening and found Mitchell's on yelp. With the many and very helpful reviews we didn't even think twice on whether or not we should try it out. As we were driving I didn't even need google maps to tell us we had arrived to our destination. Even on a Tuesday night there was people huddled all around a building across the street from residential homes. As we turned the corner we noticed a sign notifying Mitchell's Ice Cream shop customers of backside parking and luckily found one empty spot! Experiencing a multitude of good vibes so far, we quickly made our way to the entrance. Thanks to helpful tips and reviews we learned to first make our stop to the ticket machine to grab a number. My boyfriend kindly asked the couple in front of us whether or not they grabbed a ticket as well. Best to spread the yelp tips that were spread to me right?!? \n\nOnce we were able to squeeze in the shop, we quickly laid eyes upon the menu. I didn't know exactly what I wanted so by the time our number was called (which an employee does via microphone so customers can definitely hear) I asked for two samples. I finally decided on a double scoop of ube (purple yam) and kahlua mocha cream on a waffle cone. My boyfriend went with a double scoop of chocolate caramel crackle and butterscotch marble. All flavors were rightfully named as they mimicked perfectly their original product flavors. Loved all four flavors and can't wait to try the others in the future! Like I mentioned at the beginning of this post, we ate our ice cream on a bench outside the shop, theres a total of two. On the window next to us, the store's quality inspection dates/scores for this year and the previous year were visible for the public, which I thought was very cool to see. Last year Mitchell's received a score of 96, and this year that score bumped to whopping 100%. This comes to show that the business cares about taste, quality, AND cleanliness, definitely a plus for me. Also on the window was a sign with a couple facts regarding local businesses. It was actually very very intriguing because i learned alot just by eating at an ice cream shop. \n\nLocated inside the store is also three different freezers: two freezers have pre-scooped tubs of the different flavors available for purchase and one freezer has cakes available with a sign of the breakdown costs. Besides icecream, customers are also offered different other snacks to purchase.\n\nAnyway bottom line, the reviews and ratings do not like for this place. Inside there even is a shadowbox of numerous awards this local ice cream shop has received over the years. Mitchell's Ice Cream just added 2 more loyal customers. Definitely will be returning!", "author": "Charlene B."}

The servers work quick though, so we only waited for 5-10 minutes. \n\nI tasted the Thai Iced Tea: it was very creamy and milky. The tea flavor wasn't as strong and it didn't have that condensed milk-type creamy I was looking for. Tasted the young coconut and if you like light, coconut flavors this is a star. My tiny little spoonful for tasting had a big chunk of tender young coconut. It's so light, I wouldn't recommend getting a stronger flavor with it; it would be easily overwhelmed. \n\nI ended up with the spring flavors: choco raspberry and irish coffee. THEY ROCKED MY SOCKS OFF OK. Have any of you ever been lucky enough to have Godiva's dark chocolate raspberry ice cream before they discontinued it? Mitchell's choco raspberry is BETTER. With every lick and bite, you're just blasted with raspberry, it's not that sour, artificial crap you get in the grocery store. There's bit of seed and so much syrup my scoop was dripping even though the ice cream wasn't melting. They use their year-round chocolate, so this flavor is like a two-for-one special. \n\nThe Irish Coffee is so creamy, it's like a latte with a solid cup of cream, but then they add the \"Irish\" and it's this sweet, almost tangy flavor that just defies words. But I can't recommend it enough. If you like coffee with cream, you mustmust try this flavor. \n\nI paid about $6 for two scoops, but these are huge scoops; none of those lame half-domes--the servers pack you perfect spheres. Worth every penny. Oh, and their freshly made waffle cones! They have that soft crunch that only fresh ones have. Worth the 50 cents. \n\nGo, go get them before spring is over.

While paying I noticed she also placed an order for 2 scoops in a cup and a double scoop on a cone.  \nWhile my group is waiting for our turn to order our scoops, I actually wanted to buy pre-packed ice cream for later. Had I've known this trick, it would have easily saved us at least 20 mins.  Nobody blinked at this maneuver, so I thought I'd ask the counter. \nThey told me that they allow you to buy a scoop per half a gallon. I pointed out that the lady in front of me bought at least 4 scoops to one half gallon.  They said that it should have not been allowed but I think it depends on how cute you are. ;-)\nThey have wonderful ice cream as always.

If you've waited so long and you stop glancing at the number display religiously like I did, then you'd be upset too when they're serving a family of 10 whose number is after you just because you stopped paying attention for a minute).", "author": "Jessica Y."}

Worth the wait, Mitchell's boasts some of the richest, creamiest ice cream I have ever tasted!\nHow they maintain order, is you grab a number and when your number is called, you may walk up to the counter and taste as many flavors as you like. They were very friendly and accommodating, especially since we were buying 2 gallons of ice cream and needed it packed with the dry ice we purchased ahead of time. FYI 20 lbs of dry ice kept the ice cream completely frozen for over 24 hours!\nI ordered the plain chocolate, and my boyfriend ordered the peanut butter indulgence, a flavor we later bought a gallon of, if that tells you anything. One of the best attributes of Mitchell's are the scores of unique flavors! Avacado? Mango? Peppermint candy? To name a few. Aaaah! just read someone else's review and found out that Ube is actually Taro! Would have bought a car load of that flavor! At any rate, we ended up buying the peanut butter indulgence and the Grasshopper Pie. Ten bucks for a half gallon?

We literally had the BEST sample of thai tea ice cream from Strickland's that we still dream about. So when I heard that Mitchell's had thai tea ice cream here from the reviews, we made sure to stop here before we left SF yesterday.\n\nWe arrived around 5pm and the place was pretty packed. Parking was such a pain in the ass here but we luckily found a spot really quick in their miniature parking lot (HAZAH!) \n\nTheir system of taking peoples orders was like Marianne's ice cream where you grab a ticket and wait for your number to be called. While waiting for my number to be called, I browsed around the tightly packed place looking at the tubs of ice cream that they sell individually there along with the flavors I wanted to try.\n\nFinally they called number 29! I stepped up and asked to try the ube (purple yam) and tropical 4(mango, guava, banana and pineapple fruit) which I loved instantly! I decided to get a double scoop in a waffle cone since I'm such a fatty with a big sweettoof D; The consistency of the ice cream was extremely creamy! The flavors of the ice cream stood out but at the same time wasn't too overpowering. The best part was that the ice cream wasn't overly sweet like I would have at Marianne's in Santa Cruz.\n\nThough I was bummed that they didn't have thai tea flavor at the time, I was still satisfied with what I got because it was such a nice day in SF!\n\nHopefully I'll come back and they'll have the ice cream flavor of my dreams available :B\n\nPS: the ice cream melts extremely fast so learn how to eat all of it quick!", "author": "Anna H."}

And when I say tropical, I mean actual, close-to-the-equator, tropical. Think: exotic fruit names (ever heard of lucuma?), international desserts (halo-halo), and not one but TWO different types of coconut!? For a tropical fruit lover like me, there were an overwhelming number of options. FYI, the lucuma resembled a mix between a sweet potato and maple syrup, though I felt like it might taste better paired with another flavor rather than on its own. I finally settled on the halo-halo, which numerous others have raved about: it's a pretty, pastel purple blend with a subtle sweetness from coconut, pineapple, and sweet beans. Keep in mind that the cones you get are those wafer ones, so if you want a sugar/waffle you have to pay 0.20 extra.\n\nBut perhaps the best part about my experience at Mitchell's was the excellent customer service we received. We arrived at a slow time of day, close to opening. Upon seeing how indecisive we were, one smiling employee graciously offered us sample after sample of flavors he thought might be up our alley! I know this kind of service is rare and way over and above what should be expected, but the mere fact that Mitchell's employs people like this makes my support for this business even greater.

I would have given a 3.5 rating, but since I can't do halves, I am going with the benefit of the doubt and giving Mjtchell's a 4. \n\nPros: Accepts credit card, sample spoons, generous scoops\nCons: $9 minimum credit card charge, slightly slow service, a bunch of add on prices if you want sugar or waffle cones, and if you want your cone dipped, toppings, etc.\n \nMade my way over with my friend on NYE 2014 nonetheless and there was barely any line when we arrived around 1 pm in the afternoon. My friend and I took some time upon walking in to just inspect the many flavors that were offered. I picked up a number, #82, when they were just serving #79, so I thought the wait wouldn't be so bad. As I continued looking around, I saw the plentiful half gallon tubs of ice cream in their freezers, the wall of packaged ice cream cones, and the many sweet toppings for sale in the store and was instantly overwhelmed. I just stuck to deciding on which flavor I was going to sample and eventually buy. \n\nThe numbers went by a little slow....especially since it looked like there was only one ice cream scooper at the front. Thankfully, another scooper came out, and right when our number was up. I tried: Grasshopper Pie, Ube, and New York Cherry. Frankly, I only would consider the NY Cherry and maybe the Grasshopper pie but definitely not the Ube. The Ube was totally tasteless in my opinion and the NY Cherry was good but very sweet.

I won't make a venture as to who trumps who, but I can attest to the awesomeness that is Mitchell's.\n\nOn any given night there could be as little as 10 and as much as 30 people waiting just to put in an order for some ice cream. On their busier nights, take a number, wait it out, and choose from their abundant variety of flavors, which are enough to appease all tastes.\n\nWhat sorts of flavors are there beyond the traditional vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry? The Thai Iced Tea flavor is a fun one to start off with as it boasts hints of syrup, tea, and condensed milk - it's a great palate pleaser. How about Horchata as a flavor or Grasshopper Pie? The White Pistacchio is highly underrated, as is the Toasted Almond.\n\nTheir most popular flavor also happens to be my favorite: Ube. This purple yam flavored chunk of dairy goodness is beyond fantastic. Filipinos are geniuses for making Ube what it is. It's a killer dessert on its own, but even better in ice cream form. Same goes for their Halo Halo and Macapuno, both of which are definitely show stoppers in the ice cream world.\n\nThankfully, Mitchell's also happens to offer gallon sized containers for their best selling flavors.

Thanks for the Mitchell's gift card (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/76smcUUGRvq3k1MVPUXbnA?select=n3nZGR7W3Gc-nsQGCC-Vkg)! Even on that cold night, $4.85 for two decent-sized scoops of \"Strawberry\" and \"Tropical Four\"=(banana, guava, mango, pineapple) ice creams were finished, and rather quickly. That Tuesday night at 9:30pm, the line looked like it would have been a long wait, even without us two dozen yelpers showing up at once (from the first yelper ordering to last, it was between 40-60mins).\n\nI can see myself stopping by here, an easy to get to location, whenever friends ask to go. Hence, five stars (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwjXgskUN50).", "author": "Peter L."}

No, I'm not Rihanna, BUT after not being able to find parking on Castro to get to a cookie place I was leaving the city of SF a little bit disheartened. But little did I know this place would be along the way out of the city, so I stopped found parking in thier miniature parking lot and got my sweet food fix.\n\nI sampled the French Vanilla Custard and Dulce de Leche and OMG days after I still want it. I ended having a two scoop waffle cone of one scoop of each. The Dulce de Leche was yummy, sweet and carmel-y. FREAKING AWESOME! The French Vailla Custard is what I had been looking for my whole life... long story short a co-worked of mine lives in Wisconsin and frozen custard is big there so I've been wanting to try it for a while now. I've had one very failed attempt. I think this is the closest I can get to frozen custard in California and OH MY! It's so rich, thick and custardy. Plain vanilla ice cream will just be bland now. \n\nI'm so glad this is far, far from my where I live cuase it really would not be healthy to live near Mitchell's. I can't wait to come back and pair French Vanilla Custard with another ice cream cause that one is not leaving ever!", "author": "Navjot K."}

Largely a known commodity given the commercialization of the product over the years but offering several unique Asian options along with both classics and seasonal novelties in-store it was with the nutty Lacuma that I began and progressing to Purple Yam, Mango, and Halo Halo I was duly impressed...though single bites were enough when the more \"American\" options came calling as the perfect complement to cookies from Pacific Cookie Company.  Rather wowed by both Toasted Almond and Kahlua Mocha Cream while Horchatta, Peach, and Rum Raisin proved slightly bland it was only after a dozen small bites that I finally settled on a duo of 'sandwiches' and with both styles of cookie proving soft, buttery, and well crafted while hefty scoops overflowed the edges creating a proper mess I'd be hard pressed to say which was best - the answer likely residing in just how much you enjoy chocolate as the later was an intense blend of cookie, dark chocolate chips, and rich ice cream occasionally punctuated by crunchy pockets of sweet - a steal of a dessert at $3.25 each.", "author": "Michael U."}

I decided to come here because the pictures looked more appetizing (I know, never judge pictures) but it was totally worth it! Note: We came here on a Sunday afternoon on Labor Day weekend, so a crowd was to be expected.\n\nParking: Free street parking (that is, if you can find any). We got lucky and found one right in front of the store but it's ridiculous how many cars are double parked. It was that busy! I thought bunches of people in front of the store were all in line but I noticed that it wasn't really crammed inside so I went in to look at the flavors and on the wall I noticed the \"Now Serving\" sign and the \"Get a Number\" sign. SO DEFINITELY DO THAT ASAP! They were serving number 10 when I got there and I got number 49. Don't wait inside the store, PLEASE. It's honestly not worth it because you'll get your turn. We waited outside and listened to them call numbers and it went by pretty quickly. Also because many people grab more than one number for some reason, so don't get too freaked out by how many people are ahead of you.\n\nOnce we got called in I just decided to order. I didn't even want to bother trying the flavors because the young lady helping me seemed irritated. I get it, there's a lot of people and you're probably tired but a little enthusiasm, PLEASE. I got a single scoop coffee and my boyfriend got a junior scoop of vanilla. The ice cream was definitely good and I would probably wait again just so I could try more flavors next time, hopefully with someone who's more excited about working there.\n\nWhile waiting I overheard, and saw, many people get sundaes so I'm guessing those are pretty popular.

My dad would take us here on a nice day, or after a Niner win (along w/a stop to Pizza & Pipes). I remember one time, I was probably 6 or 7 - holding my older sister's hand amidst a bunch of people ordering ice cream. An older man next to me, not necessarily looking down at my face, hands down a double scoop cone of strawberry and chocolate chip ice cream to me. The fat kid in me of course, takes it without hesitation. Lick. Looks up at sister, lifts up cone - wansom? She looks at me, puzzled. Where'd you get that?? Meanwhile, a girl about my age is asking her Dad where her ice cream is. Woops.\n\nIf you were to ask me what my favorite ice cream is EVAR - (that one is for you, John M., D-Co), it would be Avocado, no contest. Before I ever tried it in ice cream form, we would make our own version of a Filipino avocado dessert at home - crushed ice, sugar, milk, and semi-squashed up diced avocado served in a glass or a bowl. When I tasted Mitchell's Avocado Ice Cream for the first time, I looked at my mom like she was on crack and yelled at her the only way I knew how at the age of 6 - \"um Ma, why we're breaking ice w/a meat pounder thing for our a-CA-vado dessert?? They have it in ICE CREAM form!!!!!!!!\"\n\nWithout a doubt, if for some wild reason Avocado isn't available (has never happened but let's speak hypothetically here) or if I'm feeling Patti LaBelle a la New Attitude, Buko (baby coconut) will always be my second choice, followed by Ube (purple yam),  then Tropical Four (a mix of Banana, Guava, Mango & Pineapple), then Mango.\n\nIf you've never been, they go by a ticket system. Go inside, grab a numbered ticket, and wait to be called. I have always had good service here. I never feel rushed, and they always offer samples and suggestions.

I went to another ice cream place before this called Bi-rite. I don't know if i'm allowed to do this, but GO TO BOTH places. I rarely go to SF and the few spots are go for sure are these two ice cream spots. Honestly, I can't say which is better because it's comparing Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs in 2014 NBA Finals. One team, Spurs, has better team chemistry, but Miami Heat has lowercase king James, a solid player. \n\nBi-rite and Mitchells are really good in different ways. If you like the fruity flavors and more solid ice cream, come on over to Mitchell's. Solid i mean, it has more density and creamy. I'm done talking, I miss this place already, but I miss the people I went here with. Shoutouts to my church.

Good thing they now have a service ticket system now.\n\nOkay, I've come to the conclusion that their ube isn't the ube that you'd expect (i.e., ube halaya).  Don't believe I'd be getting that again.  Also bummed that they aren't serving langka (only available in tub size in the freezer section).  At least the last two times we went there.  Still, the other tropical flavors are great and a draw for us.  The buko is very good as well as the Tropical 4 when you cannot decide on just one.

And for a 1/2 gallon for under $10, oh man what a steal!\n\nI haven't tried all the hot ice cream spots in SF... however, I like the ice cream parlor shop vibe I got from Mitchell's. It's got that old school cozy feel to it. Be ready for a line... but it's totally worth it. Next time I'm in the area, I'll grab a 1/2 gallon, put it in an igloo ice chest, and speed my way back to San Jose. Maybe I should grab two 1/2 gallons.

Perhaps this is why I was not wowed then, especially when comparing both flavor and texture against places like Bi-rite and Humphry Slocombe, so I suspect that I will eventually make my way out here again to properly sample their popular flavors.\n\nThat said, the crowd here is quite interesting. That is, to say, there were massive clusters of people outside, all waiting for their numbers to be called (it's a first come first serve ticketing system, so make sure you get your number), which lends to a lot of casual chatting among strangers.

I don't think Mitchell's ice cream is good to the point where I have to grab a ticket and wait in line for. A lot of people must look at the big flavor board and think: \"Wow, look at all those tropical flavors. Mitchell's does some pretty strange flavors!\" Wrong! If you are Asian, these flavors are pretty commonplace. You can find most of these flavors and more at Polly Ann's. If you do think these flavors are unique, chances are you are probably white. \n\nI tried the ube (purple yam) and didn't think anything of it. It was like taro, but less flavorful. I also tried the grasshopper pie and got a big chunk of cookie. I settled with the coconut pineapple because it was my favorite of the three. It ended up being on par with Baskin-Robbins' Nutty Coconut (replace pineapple chunks with roasted almonds, buttered pecans, and walnut pieces). I also tried some of the Tropical Four, which was pretty good - you can taste all the fruit individually and it was scented as if you were eating a flower. \n\nIn the end, Mitchell's is just a good neighborhood ice cream place to keep you cool during the hot summer months - nothing more, nothing less. It's not really worth the drive to try it and definitely not worth the wait after the drive to try it. My list for best ice cream places remains the same with Bi-Rite on top for quality ice cream, followed by Humphry Slocombe for their bold flavor oddities, and Polly Ann's to round out the top three.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

My childhood fridge was stocked with uniquely Asian equivalents of fudge bars and popsicles: green tea mochi, red bean bars, mysterious black sesame concoctions, and my personal favorite - the sweet and oddly colored ice cream made from purple yam.\n\nEven for a nippy mid-February night (measuring in at 60 degrees Farenheit, which is positively balmy for some city natives), there was a healthy line of a dozen and a half sweet-starved customers blissfully sampling flavors from over 20 of their featured offerings. Mitchell's boasts a wide variety of \"tropical\" flavors made from fruit imported straight from the Phillipines: jackfruit, mango, young coconut, and the odd avocado (unfortunately, or maybe very fortunately, no durian for those with a partiality to the taste of old socks).\n\nThe consistency, as expected of these high-end ice cream shops scattered across the city) was perfect - a smooth blend of sugar, cream, and guilt with a satiny finish.

It's nice to see that even in these days of gentrification and $4000 efficiency studios a local institution can still not only survive, but thrive. Recently, however, I've moved in down the street, so now I can tell you a good deal more about them.\n\nRegardless of time of day or weather conditions, there are always between 35 and 60 people milling about on the sidewalk outside of Mitchell's. I've come to the conclusion that Mitchell's must pay these people salaries because there is no way that all of these people can possibly always want ice cream.\n\nNumbered among the constant Mitchell's congregation are roughly 20 to 50 seemingly unattended children, leading me to another theory that Mitchell's is secretly a front for research on tiny, sugar-addled zombies. These children are generally dripping with the exact color of ice cream that will indelibly stain whatever clothes you're wearing when they run into you since their parents are nowhere to be found and it's not like they're watching where they're going (...or are they??). Passers-by should avoid confronting this mob at all costs by crossing to the other side of San Jose Avenue well in advance. If you're actually going here, don't wear anything you don't want coated in child-drool ice cream, because that shit won't come out.\n\nMitchell's DOES technically have a parking lot, which is nice if you're into that sort of thing. This, coupled with its close proximity to freeway access attracts hordes of people from not-San-Francisco who don't actually know how to drive their hulking SUV-yachts in the City.\n\n\"Parking lot\" might be somewhat misleading, as it's really only two or three parking spaces (it's hard to tell, since suburban SUVs don't tend to recognize the sovereignty of parking lines and routinely take up 2-5 spaces each). \n\nThere is ALWAYS a traffic fuckup on the streets outside. Drivers will line up 10-deep to wait for a spot. They unpredictably shift lanes. They stop unexpectedly for no actual reason. They will resent you for honking to let them know they're driving like stoned assholes. They will make you upset if you're driving and actually have somewhere to be.\n\nMitchell's is much more than an ice cream shop. It's a laboratory of failed urban planning. It's a demonstration of how chaos theory applies to groups of people. It's a writhing hub of humanity. It's admittedly really fucking good.\n\nSeriously, though... don't come here unless you've got an hour and a half to wait for a scoop and have all of your shots, and if you do, please don't drive.", "author": "Nick S."}

It's so hard to find parking, and when you finally park, you're greeted by a huge line to get served.\n\nWe got the Tropical Four (mango, guava, banana and pineapple) and the Ube (purple yam).

I waited about 30 minutes for my turn (it was a weeknight too!), but I utilized my idle time wisely by checking out all the flavors. The flavors are listed on the board behind the ice cream, but I also had time to checked out the ice cream itself in the freezer. By the time my number was called, I knew exactly which flavors I wanted to try out to make things more efficient.\n\nThey let me try three different flavors, and I ended up getting the langka. I mean, when am I EVER going to get Jackfruit for an ice cream flavor ever again?? The ice cream was very creamy -- it reminded me of Fenton's ice cream. The jackfruit was a nice subtle flavor that intensified the more I ate it. There's even little cubes of jackfruit imbedded in the ice cream!\n\nAlthough langka is a unique flavor, I didn't feel like the ice cream itself was that impressive. \n\nWas it smooth? Yes. \nWas it creamy? Yes. \nBut was it so special to be in line for 30 minutes? No. \n\nMy friend got the grasshopper pie (peppermint ice cream with chocolate chips, Oreos, and fudge) and caramel praline. I liked how the peppermint didn't taste like Colgate and wasn't overly minty, but there was too much fudge and made everything very sticky and gooey.\n\nAll the ice cream felt like ice cream I can get at any other creamery/diner, and the rest of the flavors weren't too original that I can't find anywhere else.\n\nTips:\n- Again, first get a number when you step into the store!\n- There is about only 10 parking spots behind Mitchell's, so look into street parking!", "author": "Evelyn S."}

Now it looks more like a neighborhood parlor, but I was kinda wondering if the young scoopers were feeling just a tad more vulnerable. After all, you never know when an angry woman, the object of ridicule at Weight Watchers, will lunge at them for not having enough jimmies on her sundae. \n\nI have to admit I haven't been to Mitchell's in a while since I have been carrying on with adulterous one-cup stands at Bi-Rite and Humphry Slocombe. But you can go home again and be forgiven, right Mitchell's? It was as crowded as ever despite the nippiness in the air (and I'm not talking about me being the nip either). Jamie W. and I waited about twenty minutes before we could get our respective $2.65 double-junior cones. I went for my old standby, Macapuno (sweet coconut), simply because I've missed that tropical flavor in my life, and a new flavor, Sweet 'n Salty Peanut.

I've seen it a couple times in places around Carson down here in L.A but never tried it.  Lol this was so big;  it was all placed in one of those big 16oz cups, and it was overflowing.  Felt sorry for the server girl as she had to keep mixing/squishing all of the various ingredients in the cup to make the Halo-Halo (took her like 10 minutes to make).  Finally she added 2 scoops of Ube ice cream to the top; lol it was a race to drink the milk & eat the Ube as it was slowing melting and overflowing the big cup.

Earlier in the evening we walked by about 6:30 and there was no line so maybe that's a better time to go.\n\nService: friendly, pleasant and efficient service once you get called\n\nIce cream: it was fine but nothing special. We had the peanut butter special and the chocolate chip.  We also tried the mocha fudge. The two scoop was enough for two of us to share. I liked it but wouldn't wait in line for it.", "author": "Vivek V."}

This place is good and the fact that they make their own ice cream is a total bonus.  They have so many unique flavors like horchata, avocado, ube, halo halo and so much more.  I wished I could've tried more flavors before I committed to one but the guy didn't really look like he had the patience and was possibly hating life.  I tried 2 and didn't want to bother him anymore.  I got the french vanilla custard.  The horchata was flavorful but I knew I would've gotten tired of it fast because it was so sweet.  I'm never a plain vanilla girl... EVER!! But it was perfectly sweet and so rich and creamy.  I tried everyone else's flavors too and that creamy, rich note is at the end of each flavor.  NOMS!

This is my favorite local ice cream, maybe my favorite ice cream of all! It is the only ice cream that does not freeze rock hard after months in my freezer, perhaps because they use real cream? I don't know, but what I do know is that the ice cream is delicious. I love all of the flavors, the more conventional to the more novel. I tend to gravitate towards the mint chocolate chip, and my partner likes the mango. The price is also just right. A lot of hipster type of ice cream shops have sprung up in the city lately charging lots while preparing the ice cream from scratch on liquid nitrogen, but none can really hold a candle to this place.

If it were snowing on a day I was visiting SF, I would fashion a sled, hire some huskies, and mush my way over to San Jose Avenue. Cold be damned, I can't miss Mitchell's.\n\nI've been coming to Mitchell's since I heard about it on the Food Network, about years ago now. So, so, soooo worth the journey. \n\nMost amazing ice cream ever. Thick, creamy, everything ice cream should be. \n\nYou can expect your regular ice cream choices: vanilla, chocolate, coffee. Then you've got your slightly more interesting choices: white pistachio, mocha fudge, seasonal eggnog and pumpkin. YUM. But what brings me back over and over again is Mitchell's Tropical flavors.\n\nOH HELL. \n\nA few highlights:\n\nUbe: (Purple Yam)  was my first love. Consistently amazing. Bright purple, WAY more delicious than  you might think yam ice cream could be.\nAvocado: om nom nom. Subtle sweetness and deliciousness.\nBuko: (Baby Coconut) I'm not a huge coconut fan, but this is awesome.\nHalo Halo: very popular... my best friend's fav. It's Buko, Langka, (jackfruit) Ube, Pineapple, Mango & Sweet Beans. Whew!\nLukuma: (Peruvian Fruit) just tried this one... surprisingly nutty. SO GOOD. \n \nWhen you go to Mitchell's, there's a few things you might wanna know beforehand:\n* There's a tiny parking lot around back; try that if you can't find street parking.\n* There are no sit-down and eat tables. there's a bench outside, and the street curb. That's about it. Mitchell's is a take it and go kinda place. \n* They get BUSY. You will normally have to take a number and wait your turn, partner. \n\nVerdict: GO. GO NOW.", "author": "Sara B."}

As a SF native, you will always hold a special place in my heart, even after that time when your employees didn't wash your spoons properly, and I went into mild anaphylactic shock from a peanut allergy. You know exactly what you're getting at Mitchell's. There will be no \"secret breakfasts\" or sea salt anything. It's down-to-earth ice cream. They do a shakes and floats as well, but you're really here for the ice cream. One of the best halo halo flavors in town. Arguably the best chocolate ice cream you can get from a SF creamery. And, definitely one of the better ube flavors. It's not going to cost you a bunch for a single scoop ($3.50+), and you can get a waffle cone for another 50 cents. Grab a ticket on the left hand side of the store, and stand around for a few deciding what you want to get. You can't go wrong with any of their flavors. I hate cantaloupe, and even their cantaloupe flavor tasted like a really fresh bite of the real thing. You can grab a pint of whatever on your way out. Standing room only, people. Be warned. There are two benches outside, but they're almost always full, and homeless people like to loiter in the area.

Saying that is like listing the reasons how you know that you love someone...\n\nFirst, parking is shit. But I'll wait in the back lot, while people try to gauge how slowly they can enjoy ice cream in the car. NOT COOL! Yet, I will admit that the overall vibe is a lot more friendly than the outside of other popular places because you grab a number (HEY NEWBIES! GRAB A NUMBER!) and can chill. When compared to forming that infamous solid line, where people are so stiff for fear that they have to defend their spot like it's a kingdom, Mitchell's is way better-- if people accidentally grab an extra number, they'll casually slip it to a stranger. Now that's very cool.\n\nSecond, the flavors are straight-forward, with the perfect thick creaminess (the kind that you can bite). Although they have flavors like Ube, Sweet Coconut, Avocado, or Thai Iced Tea, they also have classics like Chocolate or Mocha.  Plus, since they keep the same flavors, don't they all just become classic flavors anyway?\n\nThird, they can fancy up your scoops the good ol' fashioned way: lots of whipped cream, loads of sprinkles, and that pretty cherry.

We came here a lot when we were kids but I think we came here more frequently when my mom worked at a nearby hospital. This was the introduction of Filipino flavors at a scoop shop: Avocado (it sounds weird, but it's a Filipino thing; I don't like it though), Macapuno (young coconut string), Mango, Ube (purple yam)- creamy selections, otherwise, it would be regular flavors (non- Filipino, that is) at Thrifty or Swenson's (or even a McDonald's vanilla cone).  \n\nIf I could make any comparison, it is much like Luv-It Custard is to Las Vegas, that Mitchell's is to San Francisco (well known, celebrated, voted best of, on the travelocity list, etc.). I have not had Bi-Rite but I know about it since I am a subscriber to VIA Magazine (AAA members). When I introduced my husband to it, a few years ago, he became a fan (he happens to love Ube, btw). \n\nI love ice cream like my husband loves chocolate.

Consistently drawing crowds long before Bi-Rite and Humphrey Slocombe stormed onto the SF ice cream scene, it's in many ways the Fentons of San Francisco. Popularity aside, the two places have more in common: extensive flavor selections, ice cream that's sweet but not that creamy, and, not so fortunately, ice cream that just isn't as memorable as their younger competitors'.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the ice cream here is solid. But none of the flavors had the wow factor of Birite's Salted Caramel or Slocombe's Secret Breakfast. The Ube (Purple Yam) was good, but it lacked that evolving note that takes you by surprise.\n\nI've brought many people here on multiple occasions and the consensus has always been that Mitchell's is good. But I've never gotten the stunned reaction I get when I bring them to Birite. On the plus side, I've never had trouble finding parking in their back lot and have not had to wait more than 10 minutes.

Yeah it's not as brilliant in the pure flavors as some of the other boutique joints, but for the foundational ice cream place, do not pass up Mitchell's.  \n\nAlso, for those who think it's more like Edy's or Dreyer's because Mitchell's is in the freezer aisle in pretty boring flavors, visit the store, it's a totally different experience.", "author": "Jay C."}

The four of us prepared and delivered lunch to wife at her office. Since her boss started her 3-day Labor Day weekend prematurely, wife was allowed an extended lunch-break\n\nAfter spending time at her cubicle eating her lunch, we decided to enjoy the nice weather and step out for an afternoon \"sweet\" treat. With the recent warm weather and 600th review, do many of you think that choosing Mitchell's  Ice Cream is appropriate?\n\nIt was a good thing that Wife had an extended lunch break, because the line was so damn long with 20 people ahead of us. While waiting in line, we were debating on what to eat. There are at least 30 homemade flavors to choose from. We were thinking of getting one scope of each and build a ginormous sundae and put them in a wok. Don't laugh, because we might do that one day with the 5 of us.\n\nWaiting patiently for 10 minutes, finally it was our turn. Matt ordered a 20oz cup of Thin-Mint Milkshake. The $5.15 mint-flavored milkshake was very thick, but towards the end, a ton of chocolate chunks was leftover at the bottom of the cup. It's a lot better than having a ton of ice leftover for a drink that you don't have to wait until St. Patrick's Day. \n\n(They can customize milkshakes from any available flavored ice cream.)\n\nNiece joined uncle and ordered a French Custard Vanilla Milkshake. She got the smaller size (16 oz). For $4.45, the Vanilla milkshake was very creamy and better than any other place that she can think of.\n\nKids each ordered a single-scoop of Toasted-Almond and Peanut-Butter Indulgence. For $2.25, every lick and loud slurped they've done have put a huge smile on each their faces.\n\nWife ordered the special, which is the Oreo Explosion (pictured on the main review). The $5.85 loaded sundae comprised 3 scoops of Oreo Ice Cream drenched with a warm Hot-fudge, mountain high whipped-cream topping, two Oreo cookies on the side and a cute maraschino cherry on top. Her picture-perfect treat made her feel like a kid again.\n\nWe all enjoyed our treat in the dirty parking-lot behind the shop. Wife and Matt decided to check the place one more time and oddly there were nobody there. So we ordered a half-gallon pre-packaged Banana-Nut Ice cream for our treat for our Holiday weekend. Matt decided to purchased and carry the frozen treat, because wife is capable of melting the ice cream, because she is so damn, \"HOT\"!", "author": "Matt G."}

Although my kid's idea of good ice cream is Baskin & Robbins, I have to properly educate them.\n\nI usually order the Ube but I wanted something different. As usual, the place was packed, the temperature was about 50 degrees factor in the wind chill effect and it was like 40 degrees out. But it didn't deter us from getting our cold, yummy treats.\n\nI noticed a new flavor under their Tropical section and decided to try that. I asked for a sample of Lucuma, a fruit from Peru. The taste is almost nutty with a hint of Thai Tea. I know...sounds crazy but it was good. I had one scoop but the wifey particularly devoured it. I also noticed they had Calamansi under the Sorbet section. Another sample and it was a homerun. It was sweet and tangy...just like a Calamansi should taste like. For those who don't know, Calamansi is the Filipino version of Lemon Lime...only better.\n\nHowever, my kids picked Oreo Cookie, Strawberries N' Cream, Chocolate Chip and Vanilla. Two waffle cones and dipped in chocolate they say. Their education has not been completed as I told them they can get those flavors at Baskin & Robbins. And they coldly replied, \"We know.\" Trust me folks, there is plenty of time to convert them. \n\nBut my favorite flavor right now is the Tropical Four. Sounds generic you say? Well, it's a combination of Guava, Banana, Mango and Pineapple. I like it so much I asked for a milkshake. But I soo wanted more and got the half gallon to go. Overall, the total came to about $ 35.00. It's a pretty penny for some ice cream but it was all worth it.\n\nThey also make Halo Halo now too.

I put Mitchell's in a different category than the uber-chic Bi-Rite's and Humphrey Slocombe's of the world. They're old school, and in a class all their own.\n\nMitchells tugs at my heart strings because I have so many childhood memories tied to this place. My dad used to carry me on his shoulders all the way from our apartment near Dolores just to get some Mango and Macapuno from Mitchell's on a warm Saturday afternoon. Mitchell's hasn't changed much since then. I admire that they've remained a steady pillar of SF, operating in the same place for over 50 years. And that's a rarity in a city where businesses open and close like the seasons come and go. \n\nThe parking lot seems almost laughable now with its handful of parking spaces, but I'm sure it made alot more sense in the 50's when the city wasn't crawling with cars. So be prepared to circle the block a few times, or take the bus.\n\nAlso be prepared to wait (no surprise). They're even crowded on cold weeknights! But at least they have a take-a-number system, so you don't have to stand in a ridiculously long line (a la Bi-Rite) to get your ice cream fix. \n\nTheir selection is somewhat more traditional, although they have introduced some new and interesting flavors over the past few years. My new favorite is Chai Tea! I also love Ube. But Mango and Macupuno will always be my favorites.\n\nI think that \"The San Francisco Treat\" title should be taken from Rice a Roni and given to Mitchell's.

They offer a wide range of flavors, some are commonly seen flavors whereas others are exotic and original. When I eat or make ice cream, I look for 3 qualities: texture, originality and taste, all of which are superb at Mitchell!\n\nI tried Ube (Japanese purple yam), Grasshopper Pie (mint/chocoloate with fudge) and Macapuno (special, more fleshy coconut). All of them were interesting and delicious. YUM! The consistency of the ice cream was nice and creamy. Ube, one of Mitchell's famous flavors, was my favorite. Don't let any of the names distract you from being adventurous. Most people are pleasantly surprised after they taste-test them.

They do have a parking lot, but dont plan on parking there because its always full.\n\n2)  Push your way inside and grab a number if you want to get scoops, sundaes, etc.  The number thing is right to the left of the door as you enter.  You also have the option of ordering 1/2 gallons to go which are pre-scooped...you dont need a number for this, just grab it from the freezer inside and precede to the special line.\n\n3)  Take time to look at the menu and decide what you want or look on yelp to see whats currently popular.  Dont wait until your number is called to decide!!\n\n4)  When they are about 5 numbers away from yours go inside and wait.  They call numbers really quick sometimes and you dont want to get passed up.\n\n5)  They accept credit cards.  Enjoy :)\n\nWhat I didnt enjoy about Mitchells was first the rude staff and customers and too many kids!!  Sorry, but I live in the castro and am not use to seeing so many families.  I can tell you that 9 times out of 10 kids dont care how good there ice cream is... ice cream is ice cream to them, and they dont want to wait 20 minutes to get it.

Cookies and cream meets mint chip plus fudge. What more to say? \n\nAll Time Winner: Chocolate. If you're a real chocolate lover, look no further. Mitchell's chocolate is simple and intense, creamy and rich, and your gateway to heaven.

I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but just couldn't. \n\nMy rank for those top dog ice cream places in SF:\n1.  Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream: sorry for straying, you are my numba one. \n2. Bi-Rite\n3. Mitchell's Ice cream\n\nI always take my family on mini food adventures when I'm back in the bay.  Since we were running on limited time, I brought them here right before our 3 course French meal at Chapeau!  That's how the fam bam rolls, ice cream before dinner.  We got lucky with parking literally right in front of Mitchell's and grabbed a number.  We waited about 10-15 minutes as my sweet tooth was building up with excitement.  \n\nWhen our number got called, I felt so rushed to try different flavors.  They definitely have a lot of fruity, exotic flavors along with standard ice cream flavors.  We tried the Ube, Halo-Halo, Jackfruit, Tropical Four (banana, guava, mango & pineapple), and cookies and cream.  \n\nUbe had a very distinctive and acquired taste.  If you like them purple yams, then you will love this.  It reminded me a little of the taro flavor.   Halo Halo was creamy with delicious little bits in it.  Yummers.  But it wasn't anything unusually different than what I've had before. Same with the cookes & cream, nothing too special.  Same fat...same chemicals...same taste.  The jackfruit was exotic, but it didn't really taste like jackfruit.  The Tropical Four was pretty good, very fruity and had a refreshing taste.  My entire family concluded they preferred Humphry.\n\nI got two scoops of Ube and Halo Halo and licked it down.  The cone was fresh and crispy which made it more delicious.  Mama Cheng exclaimed \"you got two scoops?! Before dinner?\"  My response: \"uh....chyes?\"  Yea, I got a few fatty stares.  \n\nThen she proceeded to \"help\" me eat mine...\n\nOverall, it's a solid ice cream place that has great texture and consistency.

Not that I realized it back then, but Mitchell's was the place to be. \n\nGiven the fact that I was kid I liked Mitchell's Ice Cream but I didn't appreciate the quality of Mitchell's.  Being a kid I just thought it was like any other ice cream. (With the exception of the Ice Cream man's Ice Cream). But as I got older and had endless trips to the grocery store with many trips including ice cream on the to get list. From Dreyers, Breyers, Sunnyside, Safeway, Safeway Select,  Ben & Jerry's, Hagen Daz, etc etc etc. They all cannot compare to the beautiful, exquisite, creative, unique, delicious concoctions that Mitchell's offers. In a league of their own in the Ice Cream game. I'm sure the Safeway across the street has horrible Ice Cream sales. Probably the worst in the district. Hahaha. Thank Mitchell's for that. \n\nIn conclusion, you don't need to take my word that Mitchell's has one of a kind ice cream. Just read 1 of the 2300+ reviews.  Sorry Mitch, had to knock a star off for getting sticky hands and not having any hand sanitizer or wipes for ya boy or customers. I had a triple scoop on a sunny day?

THIS should not be done on a super busy night for them and we actually lucked out and went at a time when it was fairly slow.  Normally on a week day when they first open is best.  And you always have to buy something.   It's rude to do a tasting and not get something ;-(   My date only got to 12 before they cut him off but I actually made it to 15 before I started feeling guilty.   HA!

You can also purchase a pre-packaged tub cheaper than you can other at that other place. One other thing that Mitchell's has over Bi-Rite is the wait. Instead of waiting in line like the unemployment line, you take a number and then relax outside with your friends, or in your car, until your number is called.

X or Y?\" and she's like \"Let me just give you another sample so you can decide for yourself.\" Haha. So glad we did because I loved everything I tried.

I had the pleasure of taking a walk to Mitchell's with fellow Yelpers Darryl P, Danny L, David B, Jason G, Jonathan W, Karen Y, Michael M, Phillip W, Peter L, Hannah C, East Bay CM Ligaya T, May C, Dorothy C and her husband Peter, Rinky N and her husband Mike, Stephanie J and her friend Linh, Tom R, Manabu M, Tammy C, Hen A, Marti L and her boyfriend Sam, Yelp's co-founder Russ S, and others for an ice cream social after a fabulous Latin American dinner at Mi Lindo Peru.\n\nEarlier in the day I had warned Mitchell's that more than 25 ice cream fans were coming to stampede their store all at once, but their counter supervisor can only look at me in disbelief once he saw us busting through their door, clogging the entrance, and taking over their sidewalk. It was Yelp Country as far as I'm concerned, and I jumped at the chance of trying a giant scoop of their purple-grey-ish Halo Halo ice cream ($2.95) which had plenty of sexy on it and nicely packed all the way to the bottom of my crispy sugar cone. My humongous scoop was consistently creamy as all of their other flavors, and was filled with pieces of buko, langka, ube, pineapple, mango, and sweet beans for a delicious mix of tropical flavors and texture. Halo Halo was one of the Yelpers' preferred flavors of the night along with Buko, New York Cherry, Ube, Tropical Four, Chocolate Caramel Crackle, and many others. It was delicious to the core and one of the most bombass Yelp ice cream socials since my last visit to Mitchell's.\n\nAlthough some of their employees understandably looked fatigued by this time of the night, they were extremely patient and personable as we only make up half of the people who were also there.

The ube is an interesting flavor, just like taro, and I like the tropical choices they offer. The flavors, especially the Mexican Chocolate and the Grasshopper Pie, are pretty much all to die for, which makes it a little more bearable to wait in such a long line. \n\nHowever, the line is why I took off a star.

There are slivers of fresh coconut pieces in every other bite and it's the thought of finding another sliver that stops me from putting my pint down- it's like a treasure hunt!\n\nI've tried the Macapuno, and although it is supposed to be a customer favorite, I just don't think it's really meant for coconut fans since it's sweeten.\n\nMitchell's can be a wait, and there were 30 customers ahead of me when I last came here (for my coconut ice cream!), but it only took 30-40 mins for the line to abate and for my entrance to coconut heaven. :)\n\nPints are about $6 and they generously pack in the ice-cream until it's overflowing. You can also do half &half either vertically or horizontally along the container. Ube & Buko were a good mix.\n\nIn short, I go to Mitchell's for the coconut and the tropical flavors, Bi Rite for the salty caramel, Icy (in berkeley) for their asian &experimental flavors + chocolate cones, & Frenton's (in Oakland) for the crazy portions.", "author": "Lucia C."}

It was coconut ice cream, ube ice cream, jackruit & mango puree, and whipped cream. They topped this masterpiece with crunchy coconut pieces and a ube wafer. I shared it with my auntie and I could not stop eating it. All that sugar gave me a tummy ache but it was worth it. I docked a star not because of my tummy ache but because this concoction was a monthly special. So the next time i visited sf a month later, this sundae was not on the menu. I was tempted to dock another star from that disappointing visit but I left it as props to creating my favorite dessert. MITCHELLS BRING IT BACK! thank you in advance!", "author": "Melissa P."}

It's no wonder that all around San Francisco, you see \"We Serve Mitchell's\" signs in a lot of restaurants, even some famous dessert places use Mitchell's as an integral part of their desserts.\n\nLocation is pretty convenient off the freeway, parking is street parking which can get annoying but they also have a couple spots behind their building if you get lucky.  When try to enter, hang a quick left and see a classic ticket machine like at a Supermarket and grab a number.  Listen to your number and run for that server quick, jk, they are actually pretty good about being respectful especially if they are busy.  \n\nTheir flavors range from the normal to the unique, some of their flavors have a very Asian tilt to it which is appreciated.  No mater what you get, you can't go wrong.  Find a tiny corner to huddle up and eat your ice cream or enjoy on the benches outside on the rare beautiful days in SF.  \n\nMitchell's is quintissential SF.  Try it.", "author": "Brian C."}

How could you be closed on a Tuesday night at 10:15?!?  Suddenly disappointed, we took solace in knowing that Mitchell's was only a short drive away.\n\nAfter driving by twice to make sure that they were still open, we were pleasantly surprised to find that they had their own private parking lot.  Awesome!  Doubley awesome?  NO LINE.  Sweet!\n\nWalked in and was wowed by their huge menu board and all of the \"take home\" ice creams you could pick up.  And don't forget all the condiments to go too!  I guess that certainly comes in hand when you get stuck in line and get tempted to just step out and get the goods to go.\n\nThe ice cream though, is real smooth and creamy...probably one of the best I've had.  It's not super firm, nor milky either; just watching them use the little plastic sample spoons to scoop samples was a good indicator.  No force, no snapping...just a firm yet still soft consistency.  And flavor?  Terrific.  Definitely on the sweet side, but who wouldn't give in to a little indulgence every now and again (and again)??\n\nAll in all, certainly superior to most other ice cream places I've been to...no brainer that I would come back for another go round.  That said, based on the stories of how long the lines can get, not sure I would drive out just to get some ice cream from there knowing I would have to wait that long; might just opt to pick some up and bring it home (they have an express line for the \"take home\" packages.

If you don't believe me, just remember (or YouTube) Eddie Murphy's ice cream bit from Raw and you'll get a taste of what I'm talking about.\n\nSo since I've lived here for more than 2 minutes, I've had the opportunity to try the three major Mission-based ice cream joints, Bi-Rite, H. Slocombe, and Mitchell's.  Now I happen to really enjoy all three but I do think that Mitchell's has the other two beaten in terms of texture and consistancy.  If you are looking for a really rich, decadent ice cream that's creamy creamtastically creamalicious??  Look no further because Mitchell's has you covered.  \n\n(You) But I heard they don't have a good flavor selection!  (Me) Dood, they have all the basics and a great selection of tropical flavors if you are into that sort of thing (which I am).  You can't go wrong with Jackfruit in my opinion.  But if you are looking for a Mr. Fancy Pants, Hoity-Toity, Eat My Ice Cream with My Pinky in the Air kind of ice cream flavor selection, then I would say Bi-Rite is your place.  I do say, their sundae with the orange flavored olive oil and sea salt is a bit ridiculous (in a very positive way).\n\n(You) But I heard it takes forever to get your ice cream... (Me) Sometimes it does but trust me it's worth it!  Plus, if you come during the off hours you can get a pint to go pretty quickly and enjoy deliciousness in the comfort of your own PJs. \n\n(You) But it's not in the hip part of the Mission...it's in the boring Noe Valley-ish part.  (Me) So you can't get a $20 gourmet pizza on the same block.  How about walking off that $20 gourmet pizza on your way to Mitchell's?

Nowadays, my only problem is that I'm too nervous to drive in SF. Needless to say, I've been wanting to try this place for years! \n\nI finally had a taste of Mitchell's on my birthday! Being the fatty...er, food enthusiast that I am, I always wanted to have a food filled day trip in SF. My lovely friend brilliantly suggested we do it on my birthday and took it upon herself to be the driver.\n\nAfter gorging ourselves on Ike's tasty sandwiches, we headed to Mitchell's for dessert. I decided on a scoop of Ube and a scoop of Espresso Toffee Crunch. Both were deliciously creamy. The first I didn't have to try. I'm Filipina, I know what that stuff is and it's almost always good. In this case, the Ube was quite possibly the best I've had. It tastes like ube cake in ice cream form! The Espresso Toffee Crunch was delicious as well! If you're a fan of coffee ice cream and Heath bar anything, you'll love this. It's a lot like Double Rainbow's, another award winning SF based ice cream company, Cappuccino Chocolate Crunch. My friends also enjoyed their selections, which were Halo-Halo, Mango Sorbet, and Tropical Four.\n\nService was okay, nothing particularly special or warm about the people working that day, but what evs. Also, the number system was off.

Alas.\n\nFirst of all, let me just say that the employees were super-friendly, and patient, and the line was intimidating but it did move along at a steady clip. The parlor itself was brightly lit and seemed clean, so all of that is fine.\n\nBut the ice cream itself? No.\n\nAdmittedly, I am a foodie, a food snob, an ice cream snob--whatever labels you want to throw at me. I'm particular. I want ice cream to be: (a) creamy and smooth in texture, (b) absolutely natural in its ingredients, and (c) balanced--properly weighted--in flavor.\n\nMitchell's fails on all three counts. \n\nThe texture is light, not creamy; it feels insubstantial. Ice cream must feel luxurious and indulgent. This wasn't it.\n\nNow let's talk about the ingredients: there has to be food coloring in some of those ice creams. The avocado ice cream? I'm a California food snob. I know the colors of avocados. That bright, almost-lime green? Not it. \n\nAnd then, most importantly, the flavors. The 12 or so flavors we tried fell flat. They were not full. Have you had hard candies with orange or lemon flavoring? You know how those flavors aren't *really* what an orange or lemon tastes like? Yeah. That. The flavors reminded me of not-good candies.\n\nThen there's the matter of balance. Do you drink wine? Have you had that experience where the taste of the wine on your tongue is fleeting? I hate that. I feel like the wine has no presence, no weight. There might be lovely notes up top, but no solid foundation. That's how I felt about this ice cream. The flavors were fleeting. \n\nI recognize that there's a lot of love for Mitchell's and they've been around forever. That's fine. And I recognize that they have these cool tropical flavors that are hard to find elsewhere. But that doesn't make their ice cream worth eating.\n\nI ordered a small coffee ice cream because I felt guilty about not buying anything; my friends ordered some other stuff. I went outside and tried to eat it. After a couple of bites, I gave up, walked away and threw it discreetly into a trashcan.\n\nReader, I am an ice cream fiend. So this is saying something. As my friends and I headed back to wherever we were going, I found myself saying that Haagen Dazs was infinitely better. And it is. Even the regular line, rather than the \"Five\" line.\n\nI do like Bi-Rite Creamery; I'm sort of enh-it's-all-right with Humphrey Slocombe. I really like Three Twins ice cream. And Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams is the stuff of my dreams.

Great combination.  Has a really old school feel and decidedly less hipster vibe than the heart-of-the-Mission places (imagine that). The flavors are a nice mix of traditional flavors, seasonal flavors, and a few interesting tropical ones. On the balance, the flavors never get too far out there (see: Humphry Slocombe). The flavors are strong, but still maintain a bit of subtlety. They never get too sharp or up in your face (again, see: Humphry Slocombe).\n\nThe texture is what really does it for me. It is much thicker and perhaps even a bit \"chewier\" than most other places in the City. Just a perfect old school feel ot it.\n\nDefinitely coming back.\n\nEdit:\n\nGot another double scoop of the macopuno (sweet coconut) and Mexican chocolate (chocolate and cinnamon). Friend got ube (a purple tuber, similar to taro) and pistachio. Ube is a little meal-y for me and Mexican chocolate gave me a bit of cotton mouth with the cinnamon, but still quite tasty.

Maybe it's because the hyper-efficient atmosphere made me feel uncomfortable asking for samples or taking any longer than absolutely necessary. Maybe it's because I didn't try the right things - I got the grasshopper pie and it was good, but not great. Maybe it's because I felt like it was a little expensive for the quality and experience compared to the other places I've been.\n\nWhatever it was, it gets 3 stars for being ice cream, which is pretty much always good, but I'm not sure it's \"that place\" that I'd always want to go when I want ice cream.", "author": "Amanda P."}

I was just in from the airport, then BART, then muni so I was understandably a little absent and stood around for a fair ten minutes before I realized I needed to have a number in hand. Silly me.

Since the place was packed and the guy taking my order had a face like this ( : |  I didn't feel it was a good idea to sample too many flavors. I wanted to try EVERYTHING; I tried cantaloupe and espresso toffee crunch. The cantaloupe was so good and I couldn't believe how creamy it was. The espresso was also good and creamy with some yummy espresso beans inside. In a panic I got a scoop of that and walked out. \n\nThere was very little (read: zero) toffee in my espresso scoop and that was a bit of a bummer because that would have really rounded out the flavor. Instead it was just espresso. Delicious, creamy espresso but I was a bit disappointed. And a few bites in I wished I had gotten the cantaloupe. Next time if I'm waiting 20 minutes for ice cream I'm going to be a little more assertive and allow myself some time to think. \n\nI'm looking forward to trying some of their tropical flavors.

This is not something I have had until I developed some gastrointestinal issues and sometimes have a hard time with \"real food\", but I digress. I had wanted to try either Bi-Rite or Mitchell's since long hearing about both institutions and never having had either. \n\nIn all honesty, we drove by Bi-Rite first, and couldn't find any parking anywhere around-again, gorgeous day out and it is close to Delores Park. Thanks to the GPS we were at Mitchell's fairly easily and we were lucky enough to snag a spot in their tiny lot. Yes, tiny and yes, it will go on my \"ass lot\" list. \n\nWe walked into Mitchell's and took a number. It was hard to see the flavors in the case since there was quite a crowd, but the line moved quickly and we did have a little time to plan our attack prior to our number being called. Kevin had a 2 scoop banana split choosing his favorite parts of the split-the vanilla and strawberry ice cream with the pineapple and strawberry toppings. I did have a bite, and I agreed with him, the pineapple topping is way better than Fenton's. Ilana had a waffle cone with a couple of scoops(sadly I can't remember as I was so focused on my own) and I had a 2 scoop sundae with coffee ice cream and cookies and cream.I had a bit of hot fudge AND hot caramel, skip the whipped cream and add chopped almonds. The ice cream was fabulous but so rich that I couldn't finish my scoops (and they are not the ginormous Fenton's kind). Both my husband and daughter were shocked as I threw away at least 1/3 of my dessert but I was full. \n\nThey had a million flavors I would have loved to try including peach but it was too crowded for me to want to do anything more than order and get the heck out of dodge. I would have liked to have had a little table outside to sit an eat our ice creams but alas, there was no such comfort available. \n\nI am glad we came here and indulged and someday, I will come back.

According to a close peruvian friend, the fruit is powdery and the only thing people eat it as is ice cream!! How can u not like a fruit that's its sole purpose  is to be eaten in ice cream form??? and it kinda taste like butta! haha. or like a cookie dough flavor. super creamy. In a regular cone of course, hitting the bottom cup filled with lucuma never tasted so complete!\n\nI like this place because it has that old school and home-y feeling.  Not that expensive either, they don't rip you off like baskin robins because you are actually paying for quality. EWW baskin robins, gross.  Their 1 scoop is legit! only 1 for me, 2 is dtm (doin too much).\n\nThe service is great! They call you by number and you can try as many flavors as you want. Try to not annoy them like we did. haha.  I tried the cantaloupe too and its sooo good and not too sweet.  There's lot of variety, especially for you Filipinos out there that miss your halo-halo!

I finally tried their ice cream today and well, the two flavors that many have raved about - Mexican Chocolate and Ube (the latter being on the 7x7 list) - didn't please me all that much.\n\nTo be honest, I really loved the texture of their ice cream. It was thick, creamy and didn't melt within minutes - good ol' traditional ice cream. In fact, it's one of the best textures I've had.\n\nUbe - umm, it was kind of flavorless....it felt like I was eating vanilla ice cream after a few bites.\nMexican Chocolate - I guess I was expecting spicy chocolate, not just chocolate with cinnamon. It was good - don't get me wrong - but it wasn't as orgasmic as some people made it sound. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is....the ube doesn't quite deserve to be on the 7x7 list because the taste was not that extraordinary and memorable. However, I sampled the plain chocolate (my favorite ice cream flavor and the one I use to judge all ice cream joints) and thought it was one of the better chocolate ice creams in the Bay Area.\n\nMom got the sweet coconut and mango and she said they were good; there was coconut meat in the sweet coconut ice cream.\n\nNeedless to say, it's still way better than your typical chain/big brand stores (Baskin Robbins, Cold Stone, Ben & Jerry's, Dreyers, etc.) However, Mitchell's (for me at least) shadows behind local ice cream compadres like Fentons, Humphry Slocombe, Bi-Rite and Ici.  \n\nNo funky flavors here - pure, traditional ice cream. You have to get a ticket before you order and it was pretty crowded when I went, despite the heavy rain all day.\n\nThe staff/service? Not good enough to praise, not bad enough to complain.

Although the neighborhood still looks as rough as it did back then, I love how Mitchell's has always kept its family home style quality. \n\nMy favorites have always been MANGO. my mom was always UBE or LANGKA (misspell) or BUKO. I know they've added different items over the years but I can't ever get over how delicious that mango ice cream is. It's worth running 2 days worth i love it that much. Plus where else can you find a mom and pop shop that has FILIPINO flavored creations besides Goldilocks? The line is worth it just to get a simple cone. \n\nThe one thing I'm happy to say still exists at the store is the rainbow ice cream cone halogen lamp sign that's been hanging up on the window for almost 20 years.

I'm totally kidding, but with thousands of acquaintances, I can't name one that had anything bad to say about Mitchell's. Not about the ice cream, the parking, nothing about the service and not even the long line that is inevitable to endure (people flock and surround the vicinity lol, EVEN DURING THE RAIN, GEEZ MITCHELL'S YOU SURE ARE POPULAR for good reason too). Besides, they have this efficient 'Take a Number' system that seems to make things go swift and smooth ;)\n\nI think the thing that makes Mitchell's superior to other ice cream franchises is their variety. So many wonderful flavors to choose from. I sometimes wish I could buy 4 each time I visit because I'm dying to have the Ube and the Macapuno (filipino flavors [: ube is a purple sweet yam and macapuno is young coconut) but I also want some Grasshopper Pie and mango or something like that, so I'm almost thankful the wait is long. I as a libra can be incredibly indecisive. \n\nThe only time I've been somewhere that offered your own customized ice cream sandwiches was in LA and it was amazing! A chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich that deviates from the ice cream bars in the frozen foods section at Safeway? Hell yes! Imagine my glee when I read on their menu that Mitchell's has them too! ($2.50)\n\nYou have to be a real bitch to not like anything here because they offer almost everything. It's like this conversation I overheard. This guy was telling his friend \"I have 1001 songs on my ipod, you're a real bitch if you don't like at least one\"\n\nI say this because they have milkshakes, smoothies, sorbet, ice cream sandwiches, pints or gallons, cookies and... random ass things. (I hella spelled gallons wrong but geez, Yelp tells me little things like if i forget the space; ice cream is misspelled but writing \"galloons\" isn't?). ANYWAY. The ice cream is great, it tasted like home made good and wholesome organic ice cream, texture is smooth, the ice cream has the consistency of gelato (more dense)  but it's packed with flavor and actually tastes the way you'd imagine the name of the ice cream to taste. I hope you know what I'm talking about, like when you take a lick of cookies and cream and it's actually just 'french vanilla', yeah that won't happen here mmkay. \n\nThe cashiers are friendly and super cute. I love my loverman very much and think he's the hottest guy in the world, so I mean this platonically lawl. You might want to be mindful of how busy it is and limit your number of free samples. Just trust that whatever you get will be fantastic even in the circumstance it's not the flavor you're craving. \n\nLuckily if you just want a pint or anything else they offer like (syrups and cookies) there is an express line for those items so you won't have to take a number or wait :d\n\nThe architect must have known Mitchell's would be high in demand as they have their own parking lot and there's always parking despite the long line outside.

This area is a nearby spot to one of the greatest Ice Cream joint in San Francisco. Mitchell's Ice Cream is a little tiny ice cream shop with an enormous group of loyal followers and it is growing every day. Almost every minute of every hour Mitchell's Ice Cream is open for business, there is always a line of people out the door of this joint, waiting to get a taste of this wonderfully delicious ice cream as they bring it out to their cars and enjoy Mitchell's vast selection of frozen treat. Here are just some of the few I will highlight: \n\nUbe (Purple Yam) - It made the SF 7x7 list of \"100 Things to Try Before You Die\". Being a Filipino I grew up on Ube Ice Cream (Magnolia) so I'm a little bias towards the Magnolia version, but Mitchell's Ube has its own distinct taste that's worth trying. \n\nMexican Chocolate - Chocolate with cinnamon, my personal favorite and what I think should have been on the \"100 Things to Try Before You Die\" list. Rain or shine this is the ultimate treat. \n\nWhite Pistachio - I'm a little hooked on Pistachios right now so anything with Pistachios I'm getting. Certainly not the best in my list, but worth trying. \n\nKahlua Mocha Cream - The closes to Lappert's Kauai Pie, my all time favorite. Not quite as good as Lappert's but close (or maybe I like Lappert's because I only get it when I'm in Hawaii, that adds to the taste, don't you think?!?). \n\nThese are just some of the few I've tried, I'm sure you will have your own personal favorite.

Mitchell's Dairy Farm was established in 1891 in San Francisco. In the summer of 1953 on the 6th of June, brothers Larry and Jack Mitchell opened Mitchell's Ice Cream shop at San Jose Avenue and 29th Street. Its still family owned and operated by Larry Mitchell (see website- there is a photo of Larry, his wife Linda and son Brian). I love that they make their ice cream daily- so you know its fresh. The also import fruit from the Philippines to make their tropical flavor ice cream. \n\nTropical Flavors\nAvocado, Buko (Baby Coconut), Coconut Pineapple, *Ginger (November through April), Green Tea, Halo Halo (Buko, Langka, Ube, Pineapple, Mongo & Sweet Beans), Langka (also known as Jackfruit, a relative of the Fig), Lychee, Macapuno (Sweet Coconut), Mango, Thai Tea, Tropical Four (Banana, Guava, Mango & Pineapple), Ube (Purple Yam).\n\n*Seasonal\n\nAfter dinner he asked if I wanted to get a scoop of my beloved Salted Caramel or Honey Lavender from the Bi-Rite Creamery. I smiled and said I wanted to try something different tonight. So we headed to Mitchell's. He had the Macapuno and Ube. I had the Salted Praline and Peppermint. The ice cream was heavenly- rich, creamy and delicious. Originally he wanted the Halo-Halo ice cream but they ran out. The shop is cozy- no where to eat inside. If you want to sit outside there are benches in front of the ice cream shop. We took our ice cream to go as it was too chilly to eat ice cream outside tonight.

That's why my boyfriend and I decided to come here on a Friday night. \n\nWe came at a perfect time (around 7:30PM) because there were a lot of parking spaces available in the back of the shop. When we came back out 15 minutes later the lot was full of cars. \n\nBecause there were not too many people there, we decided to try a few flavors. We already knew that we wanted a 1/2 gallon of Grasshopper Pie (mint ice-cream with lots of fudge, oreo cookies and chocolate chunks). The staff was really nice and let us try a lot of flavors. Usually ice-cream shops will frown upon that sort of practice. \n\nFlavors that I have tried:\n\n* Grasshopper Pie - as described above. This is one of my favorite ice-cream flavors ever! I actually enjoy it more than the Ben & Jerry's version because Mitchell's actually puts a LOT of fudge, huge oreo cookies, and chocolate chunks so you never run out. \n\n* Chocolate Caramel Crackle - my new discovery! It's really chocolate-y with caramel swirls and Crunch-type of chocolate \n\n* Avocado - eh. I don't really like weird-flavored ice-cream.\n\n* French Vanilla Custard - a really creamy version of French vanilla. I enjoyed it. \n\n*Tropical 4 - a mixture of guava, mango, pineapple & banana. You could actually really taste all four flavors, but not at once. As my boyfriend described it, \"You taste the guava first and then all of a sudden the mango comes out of no where. And then the pineapple hits you and you taste remanents of banana here and there\"\n\nOverall, a great ice-cream shop that has non-traditional flavors. I only mark it down my one more star because they don't have CRAZY, original flavors that Bi-Rite or Humphry Slocombe might. I wish they would come up with a Jasmine Tea ice-cream or sorbet.

In fact, they can create invisible lines between the fam bam and I. My SF and DC cousins swear by Mitchell's, I am true to Tucker's being from the East Bay and when we invited my cousin's new bf to Mitchell's he jokingly said, \"I know a better place in the East Bay: Ici\". I busted out laughing. That warranted an immediate fist bump. I remembered my review from a few years ago. I had called Ici the Louis Vuitton of ice cream parlors.\n\nBut Mitchell's it was going to be for the evening. I had passed on a prix fixe meal and dessert at Blue Plate in order to accommodate Mitchell's. We talked about what flavors we were going to get. A year ago I had tried the Ube. It was, in fact, the best Ube flavored ice cream I had ever tasted. Mitchell's ice cream tastes incredibly fresh and they get their ingredients straight from the PI. That night I wanted Mexican Chocolate as well but the pairing just didn't fit. My brother promised that we would return again. I had been looking forward to Mexican Chocolate all year and all week long. Of course when I arrived at Mitchell's this time, it all changed. There was a menu of all new flavors and after listening to my cousins boast about Grasshopper, Chocolate Caramel Crackle and Kahlua Mocha Cream, I kind of wanted it all. But I stuck to my guns and limited myself to tasting just two flavors. Between Mexican Chocolate and Cinnamon Snap, Cinnamon Snap had won. The Mexican Chocolate is good but wasn't spicy enough for me. While the Mexican Chocolate has hints and undertones of cinnamon, the Cinnamon Snap was cinnamon all the way and the ginger snap cookies really gave it a bite and sharp flavor. It was great.\n\nI like Mitchell's but i can't give it five stars in comparison to the other ice cream parlors out there. I dream about Bi-Rite, my face lights up when I hear about Tucker's, I take all my best friends to Cones in NY, I bow down to Ici, Humphry Slocombe is my one day ice cream parlor, and Mitchell's?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-27", "description": "Friday October 8, 2010, around 10 pm, standing outside of Mitchell's Ice Cream shop \nLoud outdoor speaker - \"Number 58. Now serving number 58.\" \nMe- \"Hey man, what number are we?\" \nBF- \"Um......86\" \nMe- \"Holy Sh*t\" \n\nI couldn't believe the amount of people that were standing out in front Mitchell's on such a cold, windy night. The sidewalk was so crowded that it looked like there was an outdoor concert going on. And what was even more surprising was all the families that were present. Even though it was ten o'clock at night there were kids of all ages patiently waiting for a scoop of Mitchell's famous ice cream. \n\nMitchell's is one of the biggest ice cream parlors I have ever been too. Right when you walk in you come face to face with a gigantic display case where their ice creams are housed. Above that is a big sign listing that days flavors. I have never been to an ice cream shop that has as many daily favors as Mitchell's. I swear that they have over 40 flavors of ice cream and sorbets daily. They also have smaller display cases off to the side that contain pre-packaged quarts of many of their homemade flavors. I had driven by this place many times in my past visits to the bay area but the huge crowds always scared me away. Well, on my latest trip to SF I was determined to finally face the long wait and try some of Mitchell's famous homemade ice cream. After waiting about 30 minutes, the loud speaker finally called our number. Since it was my first visit to Mitchell's I decided to try a bunch of their flavors before I made my decision. \n\nThis is what I sampled: \nCaramel Praline ,Rocky Road, Toasted Almond, White Pistachio, Buko (Baby Coconut), Avocado, Thai Tea, Tropical Four (Banana, Guava, Mango & Pineapple) and Pumpkin \n\nEvery flavor I sampled was amazing. Each flavor was super creamy and really sweet but the one that stood out the most was the pumpkin. Mitchell's pumpkin ice cream is by far the best pumpkin ice cream I have ever tried. It tasted identical to a slice of pumpkin pie. \nIn the end I ended up ordering a tropical sundae and a scoop of pumpkin ice cream. The tropical sundae was served in a waffle bowl and contained a scoop of Buko (baby coconut) ice cream and a scoop of their Tropical Four ice cream. Then they topped off this sundae with fresh pineapples, whipped cream, chopped nuts and a cherry. This sundae was fantastic. It was fruity, creamy and super sweet all at the time. \n\nThe prices here are very reasonable. For my sundae and my scoop of pumpkin ice cream it only set me back around 8 or 9 dollars. \nEven though we had to wait a long time, the service was still great. At 10 o'clock at night Mitchell's had at least 8 employees working. Once it was our turn the guy who helped us was more than happy to let us sample as many flavors as we wanted. He even gave us suggestions on what to try since it was our first time there. \n\nIf you have never been to Mitchell's than I highly recommend you do so. Their ice creams are totally worth the long waits.", "author": "Craig R."}

Since we were not up for dessert on Friday evening and had bypassed my earlier inclinations for Ti Couz and their super yummy Nutella and Bananas Crepe (my personal fave) an ice cream date now seemed the right thing to do.\n\nWe alighted upon the revered place of iced dairy dreams and whimsical wishes to find it surrounded by an impenetrable horde of people (think the scene at Helm's Deep with all the Urukai and helmeted goblins in mass at the entrance) and one of the bystanders pointed out that we had to pick a number tag located inside.  Ah, thank you for order!\n\n#36 (or something around here)\n\nThey were on # 70-something or another.  Which meant they had several to hit before hitting the #100 before starting all over again. But when one has to wait while the other someone is giving them a back massage, I will not complain about waiting in line.  And it helps when you get to lean into them for support  ;o)\n\nThe same gentleman who had pointed out the order number tag out to us came and whispered to us:\n\n\"I'll give you my number,\" he motioned to his tag, which housed the awesome full house equivalent = 15.  \"I've got a closer number, so I'll give you mine.\"\n\nWow.  Talk about luck and pure kindness.  We thanked him and probably cut our waiting time by another 15 minutes.\n\nThey have a variety of flavors ranging from classic Vanilla and Chocolate and Strawberry to more interesting such as Strawberry Basil and Avocado and Ube (purple yam root), Jackfruit, Lychee and Halo Halo (they fly in their fruits from the Philippines). Since I'm classic with a twist, I ordered the White Pistachio with a scoop of Strawberry.  I like the twist of pure creamy Vanilla indulgence with the gourmet nuts of pistachio dotted heavily throughout, made lighter with something fruity (they were out of the Red Raspberry Sorbet).  Added these two scoops on top of a waffle cone and I was in high heaven.\n\nThe ice cream here has an intensely high dairy content, which means every lick will afford you potential danger of spiking sugar and cream levels in your body while your diastolic/systolic levels attempt to level themselves out.  My White Pistachio scoop had whole pistachio nuts dotted through out, no little chunks or slivers..a floating paradise of dense roasted nut Vanilla base.  My Strawberry was a fruity cream experience, except that I did not come across any of the fruit hanging around.  Maybe I ordered it naked.  Regardless, it was smooth, creamy......and walking around the area, flashing waiting cars at the lights with my two scoops of indulgence, lavishing indeed.\n\nTwo scoops = $4.82 or something of that nature.  Add on another 50 cents for the waffle cone (highly recommendable!)\n\nI'm bad with numbers today.  My head hurts from ice cream hangover.", "author": "Miika M."}

Now, I'm onto the tropical flavors like Lucuma (a Peruvian fruit which I must try fresh one day) and Halo Halo (I was hesitant with the purple coloring at first but was delightfully surprised how tasty it was).\n \nBe prepared to wait when you come here, especially on a Friday/Saturday night. It's packed like a nightclub on the weekends. I usually just go in and get a pre-packed half gallon of ice cream.

Like at government buildings, there is a very long \"line\" (more like a herd) of people of various demographics. Once you enter, you grab a number and wait for someone to call it from one of the several service windows. There is even a little flashing light that reads, \"Now servicing [insert number].\"\n\nThis is probably the most spiffy ice cream parlor I've been to. Watching the numbers get closer and closer to mine really just built up my excitement. There were a lottt of flavors, including a separate list of Tropical Filipino flavors (Ube, Halo-halo, Macapuno, etc). Honestly, I wanted to sample everything, but limited it to Thai Tea, Ube, and the Flavor of the Month--Cantaloupe. All were delicious and service was very friendly. \n\nOne scoop is almost $3, and two scoops is nearly $5. I asked if I could combine flavors in a scoop, but alas--it is not possible. Instead though, she gave me \"baby scoops\" of the flavors I wanted, Ube and Thai Tea. This turned out to be a very satisfying amount of ice cream. Not sure how much it costs as my Dessert-Devouring Darling treated me. Mitchell's Ice Cream is on the rich side--quite dense and incredibly creamy. The Thai Tea is a must try--it has the most exquisite taste--like tea combined with a splash of rum, which is excellent for me because I happen to love rum ice cream.\n\nAs for parking, Mitchell's has a little parking lot in the back...another option would be to buy something at the nearby Safeway and walk over to Mitchell's! Minus points for the long wait (15 minutes on a Saturday afternoon, perhaps?) and for the extremely limited seating (a bench)...but definitely a must-try!", "author": "K W."}

Their ice cream is so good, and they have fun flavors. \n\nMy two all time favorites if I absolutely had to choose would be toasted almond and white pistachio. Both are so rich and creamy and they come in the big tub. hehe. \nIf you're about to head home after visiting Mitchell's, I suggest shelling a few extra and just bring the big tub of ice cream home instead of waiting for your number to be called. It's a lot more worth it, and you can enjoy it in the comfort of your own home. \n\nI've only ordered a scoop once because there was nobody there as it was a Tuesday evening right before they were closing. I ordered a scoop of toasted almond and the girl gave me a lot more than a scoop. Can't complain about extra ice cream. Also, this ice cream doesn't melt as quickly as others. Usually when I have ice cream, by the time I get close to the bottom, a lot will have already melted. But it was not the case this time. Or maybe it was just really cold outside and that's why it didn't melt as quickly. \n\nOne downside is parking can be a pain when it's a hot summer night, or just one of those busier weekends. They have a lot, but it's fairly small. If you're coming on a warmer evening, be prepared to possibly have to circle around the block a couple times to look for parking.

Everytime I visit the Bay, it's always Bi-Rite, Bi-Rite, Bi-Rite! And don't get me wrong because I love me some earl grey or coffee toffee (best ever) at Bi-Rite, but sometimes you want some of that hoo-hah and culture that Mitchell's seem to do so well.\n\nUber ethnic. Seated in the Mission - next to hipsters I've been told (thank god I brought my b and boat shoes). So many flavors (I sampled 7 - I tipped so shut it). I didn't even bother looking at everything else + condiments because I was so focused on ice cream - I did see there was a pretzel cone (somebody get it and tell me). \n\nSo they have regular flavors and then the Filipino flavors. I went exotic, because you know, wild Scorpio. I thought their espresso toffee was really strong - impactful choco chips if you dig that (I don't). I got...\n\nLangka (Jackfruit) - true to the fruit flavor, creamy but light, fragrant but not domineering. It's a good, mild for those easing their way into something non-vanilla.\n\nHalo-halo - Nice mix of everything + texture! They've got beans, jellies, and gummies in it. There were hints of young coconut but then also ube but then pineapple. I've never had a real Halo-halo but I imagined this creamy combo 1-2 punch.\n\nSo with that... I've had my share of tubs of ice cream at random Filipino UFC fight parties and potlucks, and I can't say I was that impressed with the ube or avocado. I don't think it was strong or fragrant enough - something very modest about these flavors. I think for avocado ice cream (or milkshakes) to be really successful, they need to have almost equal parts condensed milk like the Vietnamese do... \n\nAside those 2, I really liked the variety, most flavors I tried, and their risk factor.

It's a 40/60 and Bi-rtie usually wins because I'm basically in love with their salted caramel.  But I have a love affair with New York Cherry from Mitchell's. And it also helps that I know somebody who works there haha! I die for their cantaloupe during the summer time. Peach is hella good as well. Mexican Hot Chocolate is chocolate ice cream with a zing of cinnamon.  I can go on and on, but you really have to go and try for yourself.  \n\nTo put it out there: you guys HAVE to try the Green Tea ice cream here! It's seriously the best; but unfortunately they don't sell it by the scoop, you have to buy the half gallon, which I do not mind at all :) .", "author": "Betty C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-07", "description": "**Updated for new flavors**\n\nMitchell's is the best ice cream I have had in SF so far. Better than Bi-Rite and definitely better than Humphrey Slocombe. \n\nGOOD:\n\nCHOCOLATE ORANGE INFUSION - They use plenty of orange zest and the orange flavor is very fresh and crisp, not overly sweet like orange syrup. This is a must try for any chocolate lover. Sadly, they seemed to have moved it out of the rotation as of 6/5/2010 or hopefully it was just a temporary change.\n\nBLACK WALNUT - This is a very nutty ice cream (think hazelnut cream) but with walnuts instead. It is not super sweet and a very good flavor if you like walnuts.\n\nMEXICAN CHOCOLATE - Nice cinnamon and chocolate combo. Similar to the Mayan Chocolate Haagen Dazs flavor (which sadly was discontinued).\n\nMACAPUNO - Not too sweet and had nice yummy tender pieces of coconut instead of the typical shavings used in coconut ice cream.\n\nGRASSHOPPER PIE - Very chocolately and minty. A bit too heavy on the chocolate in my opinion.\n\nBUKO - Similar to Macapuno. I think it is a tad less sweet. I thought the Macapuno was better.\n\nGINGER SPICE - This is not like ginger snaps or ginger bread. This ice cream is loaded with chunks of ginger giving it a nice kick, while not being too sweet at the same time.\n\nLUCUMA - This Peruvian fruit flavor tastes kind of like sweet potato or pumpkin. The taste is somewhat subtle but good if you like the aforementioned flavors.\n\nLANGKA - I love jackfruit (don't confuse it with durian!) and this flavor hit it right on the head. Not too creamy and not too sweet, but creamy enough to not taste like a sorbet. Jackfruit tastes like Juicy Fruit gum but a little less sweet.\n\nJUST OK:\n\nFIG - This is a new flavor that I first noticed on 6/5/2010. It was not there a few weeks earlier. Basically it is candied figs mixed with caramel ice cream. Sadly, the caramel ice cream overpowers the fig and I would have much rather have preferred a pure fig ice cream, rather than a caramel-fig one.\n\nTROPICAL FOUR - It basically tastes how you would imagine if you mixed banana, guava, mango &  pineapple pieces and juices with vanilla ice cream. It isn't bad or anything but it didn't surprise me or seem all that special.\n\nUBE - The purple color makes this flavor look awesome but it really is a very subtle flavor and tastes like a nutty vanilla in my opinion. It looks better than it tastes.\n\nWHITE PISTACHIO - I was hoping for a strong pistachio flavor but this flavor was heavy on the creamy side and not so much on the pistachio. It wasn't bad or anything, I just wish they put more pistachio in it.\n\nAVOCADO - Imagine an avocado, milk, and sugar in a blender and that is exactly what this flavor tastes like. I would rate this flavor good if I liked eating avocado as dessert but I personally prefer them as a salty dish rather than a sweet one.\n\nGREEN TEA - I have never seen this flavor in the store by the scoop. I only tried it out of the pre-packed half-gallon tub. I like my green tea ice cream with a strong tea flavor, not overwhelmed by the cream and not too sweet. Mitchell's isn't as good as the Maeda-en Japanese branded one but it is certainly much better than the H\u00e4agen-Dazs one that you find by the pint in the freezer section, which is way too creamy, and lacking with the green tea flavor.\n\nBAD:\n\nCHOCOLATE - It was a surprise that such a basic flavor could be so blah. Their chocolate was very uninspiring and tasted no better than the chocolate out of a carton of Dreyer's.\n\nCONCLUSION: If you are an ice cream purist and care about freshness, texture and consistency, this is the place to go. Mitchell's might not have better flavors than Bi-Rite or Humphrey Slocombe, but they have better ice cream.", "author": "Alex P."}

Ube, halo-halo, langka, mango, macapuno, etc).  I can just buy that stuff at Pacific Super! But one tropical flavor caught my eye. LUCUMA! \nWhat is lucuma? Well according to Mitchell's description, its a Peruvian fruit. I remembered Daniel L's review and decided to try it. OMFG, it was soooo delicious!! Not sweet at all. It had a very subtle flavor and its very hard to describe. First it reminded me of mocha, then caramel, then coffee, then something nutty, then.... I dunno how to describe it but it just had a very unique flavor. According to Wikipedia, \"The lucuma has particularly dry flesh which possesses a unique flavor of maple and sweet potato.\" Okay, MAPLE is the word I'm looking for! Highly recommended! Don't forget to sample it if you're ever at Mitchells.\n\nMy friends and I came on a good day. It wasn't too crowded and we only waited for about 5 minutes. No line at all! If you don't feel like waiting for your number to be called, you can buy a half gallon for $9.25. If you don't feel like driving out to the Mission, then go to Mollie Stones or Pacific Super.

Twas a lovely San Franciscan eve, and the parlour was hopping. I took a number, and waited as they called numbers over some new-fangled voice projector. \n\nAs my number neared, I felt unsure of which, among the many conventional and unusual flavors, to choose. After testing some strange yet delicious mix of tropical items and well as a sample of 'purple yam,' I settled upon my old stand-by peanut butter chocolate (which I used to eat as a snack after walking home uphill from school in the freezing cold, accompanied by none other than my faithful sheep dog Earl.) \n\nTwas delicious, as was the Mexican Chocolate of my friend. The gentilhommes attending to the counter were a pleasure to chat with, and we shared a tete-a-tete about Ninja Turtles. \n\nTo top it off - the theoretical cherry if you will - the dessert was quite reasonable. I will save my remaining tuppence to return for more ice cream.\n\nAnd so, I have founded a mission, based on the principles of liberty, justice, and deliciousness, to return to Mitchell's, to return their often, and to try their most delicious-looking, choose-your-own-flavor cookie sandwiches.", "author": "Hannah R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-07-31", "description": "Mitchell's is okay. A bit overhyped, but alright. \n\nFor starters, their ice cream is HEAVY-Y-Y. I read in an article that Mitchell's uses the most amount of butterfat than any other ice cream place in the city. Mitchell's at 16%, Humphry Slocombe and Bi-rite, who use milk from Marin's Strauss Family Creamery, is at 14%, and Three Twins, who make their own, also at 14%. So be prepared to feel the full effects of food coma/sugar overload. \n\nWhat I love about Mitchell's though, is their selection of tropical and Asian flavors. Either I haven't explored far enough into the Sunset, or it just plain doesn't exist, I don't know of anywhere else in the city, I can find Ube, Halo Halo, Lucuma, or Jackfruit flavored ice cream. So, props to variety! Also, you get larger scoops here than any of the aforementioned ice cream places in the city. So, double props to cost and portions!\n\nStill though, maybe it's just me, since a large majority of reviewers absolutely love this place, I'm just not sold. I'll probably get some heat for this, but bring it on! I didn't like how heavy or overly sweet the ice cream was, or the fact that I had to take a number before I ordered, like I was ordering a piece of meat from the butcher. Their menu is largely, very traditional, and unimaginative. For me, I like the trend where ice cream places like Humphry Slocombe, Bi-rite, and Three Twins, are going in, with their unique ice cream flavors, and I'd rather go to any of these three places over Mitchell's any day.", "author": "Ray W."}

It's absolutely delicious!  \n\nIf you live in the bay area and haven't been here yet or you are visiting San Francisco, you should definitely stop by and get a scoop, or an ice cream sandwich, or a hand-packed pint...or be a fatty like me and get all three.", "author": "Sandy J."}

Yes, it may be small..but it's something! Way better than a crowded street in mission district or something.\n\nWe sampled a few flavors and the two it came down to were avocado and dulce de leche. The two surprisingly complimented each other very well too. The avocado was rich and creamy, but not too sweet. Very reminiscent of vietnamese avocado smoothies...dare I say tastier.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-23", "description": "Recent results of an ice-cream taste-off between Mitchell's and Bi-Rite that one of my friends organized. Disclosure, I was unable to participate in the taste-off as I had a prior commitment. Consider this a guest review! It's just too damn good not to post. The writer gives Mitchells 5 stars, without hesitation. \n\n\"Last night we threw a surprise birthday party and decided to conduct a little bit of an experiment. The birthday-ee has long debated the merits of Bi-Rite versus Mitchell's. We decided to settle, once-and-for-all, which reigns supreme by having a head-to-head taste off. Naturally, we dubbed it The 2009 Alan Richard ****** Ice Cream Taste Off. I intend for their to be another in 2010.\n\nNot surprisingly, it didn't take long for the participants in this taste off to voice their allegiances, which brought the divisive nature of the debate to the fore. One participant declared Mitchells, \"the people's ice cream,\" perhaps in reference to its more affordable price tag or what some perceive to be laid-back counterpoint to the alleged snootiness of Bi-Rite. Others defended Bi-Rite, lauding its natural ingredients and widespread popularity. The room was ripe with conflict, and it was time to dish out the ice cream.\n\nThe methodology: We started by analyzing the flavors offered by both establishments, looking for an overlap in flavors. We discovered ten:Vanilla\nChocolate\nMinty\nCinnamon Snap\nBanana\nPumpkin\nTea\nGinger\nSorbet\nCookies and Cream\nIn the end, we offered four for the taste-off: ricanelas/cinnamon snap, pumpkin, cookies and cream, and mint chocolate chip. One obvious flaw with this experiment is that these aren't even close to either establishment's best flavors, nor does they account for the fun, off-the-wall, creative flavors that both places thrive in, but they do provide a sample that allows us to objectively compare.\n\nWe had eleven participants. Each was offered two spoonfuls of each sample - labeled either A or B.  We took care to ensure that each flavor was served so that it was virtually impossible to discern its maker (with one flawed exception you will see below). We had four rounds (one for each flavor) and each participant filled in a score card by circling their preference for the round: either A or B. Participants were prohibited from voicing their preference throughout the entire process so as not to influence the opinions of others. They were offered either water or beer to cleanse their palate between rounds.\n\nWhichever ice cream received more votes for each round (out of eleven), received one point. Whichever maker received more points overall was the victor.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n\nRound 1 (Cinnamon)\nBi-Rite: 10\nMitchells: 1\n\nPoint Bi-Rite.\n\nThis, notably, was the most decisive preference in the entire experiment. Bi-Rite's Ricanelas is damn good, and far superior to Mitchells.\n\nRound 2 (Thin Mint)\nBi-Rite: 4\nMitchells: 7\n\nPoint Mitchells.\n\nIt should be noted that there is a potentially confounding variable with this round in that the color of both selections is different (one green, one white), which could have potentially revealed its maker to the trained ice-cream-ophile. That is, I think a few people (some of whom had strong allegiances to Mitchells) knew which they were eating in this round.\n\nRound 3 (Pumkin)\nBi-Rite: 5\nMitchells: 6\n\nPoint Mitchells.\n\nAs the results show, this was hands down the closest decision of the entire taste-off. Both were very similar, and both were very delicious.\n\nRound 4 (Cookies and Cream)\nBi-Rite: 4\nMitchell's: 7\n\nPoint, Set, Match, Mitchells.\n\nHere, again, it was a close call, but Mitchells decisively prevails once more and thus solidifies its place as the superior ice cream, 3 to 1.\n\nA couple of points of clarification. I acknowledge that we ran the risk of ending up with a tie having offered four flavors, but it fortunately didnt become a problem. Perhaps the most contentious part of my methodology here was that head-to-head nature of this competition. Some participants voiced a frustration with the experiment as overly simplified. They would have preferred a more nuanced criteria based on texture, taste, creativity, and so forth. While I agree that it should be done in the future, it was simply too much number crunching for one night.\"", "author": "Andrew K."}

They only use chocolate chip cookies for the sandwiches but you can choose any ice cream flavor to stick in between. But if they sold the cookies on their own, they would make serious money.

I don't want to hate because I know why people like it (fat, sugar, childhood reminiscence, the Bay Area's obsession with long lines), but it's just not for me. It's good, creamy ice-cream, but give me Bi Rite any day.\n\nThe ambiance makes me feel like I'm in a Safeway franchise in a low income school or something. Why the need to sell Pepperidge Farm cookies as well as other odds and ends? I tried several, all were super sweet, ended up getting mango swirl, which I didn't try beforehand, but was pretty good because it reminded me of this ice cream bar I used to buy in South Africa (Magnum brand). \n\nI like it when places do 2 smaller scoops of different flavors (like with most gelaterias), but here two scoops is just too much ice cream and also twice as much money as one scoop (which doesn't make sense for ice cream store economics, but does in other areas). Felt a little ice-creamed out afterward. I'm sure I'll have to go here again because people love it and I'll go to be a good sport, would just rather go other places.", "author": "Kristen R."}

We waited for quite a while, and I just thought, \"This better be good for the wait...\"\n\nI didn't know what to get, and for some reason, I felt like it was too busy to ask for sampling the flavours, so I just decided on the Thin Mint, which is, essentially, Mint Chocolate Chip.

My mom seemed to enjoy the place a lot, especially their more different flavours of tropical fruits and such. \n\nThe price isn't anything to complain about. They give you quite a big scoop for a single scoop, and like I said, the ice cream does feel pretty heavy. The only thing that seems odd is that they'll charge $0.20 for a sugar cone.

This makes our ice cream richer and creamier than most of our competitors.\"  It's true.  If you're not lactose intolerant before visiting, you will be after having a scoop of their amazing ice cream.  \n\nTHE ICE-CREAM:  Consistently creamy, cold, and delicious.  My favorite flavor is Mexican Chocolate, but I've never been disappointed with any of their flavors -- fruity, minty, salty, chocolatey.  \n\nTHE SERVICE:  They have a number system.  You go in, grab a number (like at the butcher's), and wait 'til your number is called.  You can ask for as many tastes as you like.  Some scoopers are super nice and friendly, and others are kinda indifferent to you but do their job.  \n\nTHE WAIT:  Is LONG on warm days.  But, if you go with friends, you can just chat with them while you wait.  OR ... you can all agree on one flavor and dig into a pre-packed half-gallon.  There is virtually no wait for the pre-packed stuff.  \n\nTHE PARKING:  Is sucky.  There is a small parking lot in the back (which actually turns over faster than you'd think).  If you wanna wait you can just cue up for the parking lot.  Or you wanna move around, you can circle the neighborhood for parking.  Do NOT block any driveways; the neighbors sometimes get fussy.  My usual plan is to drop off the passengers and tell them my order.  By the time I find parking in the neighborhood and get to the store, my friends usually have my ice-cream waiting for me.  \n\nPUBLIC TRANSIT:  The shop is 0.8 miles from the 24th St and Mission St BART Station.

They had a leftover brand-new gallon container of vanilla ice cream, and I swore to god that container went empty within 10 minutes.

It was the best vanilla ice cream I had ever tasted, and possibly in my life. \n\nIt was then, that I realized, I needed to take a trip over to Mitchell's.

Hello, get out of the way, inconsiderate people! \n\nI went to Mitchell's a few years ago and got Grasshopper Pie.

It is very AIR-y. Very LIGHT. I guess this is personal preference, but I like mine dense and thick.

I have to give the one up to bi-rite for the ice cream texture. \nI do give Mitchell props for having such a wide variety of flavors that are available at one time. They have very interesting flavors like Ube, baby coconut, avocado, some peruvian fruit flavor. Lots of tropical flavors that you can't find anywhere else. I like the grasshopper pie too. \nAnother gripe I have with Mitchells is that you can only get one flavor in a single =( I want to be able to try more flavors in my cone!!11 =( But at least the scoops are one of the BIGGEST in the city =) \nLastly, the waiting system for getting service is ridic. I know it SEEMS orderly with the whole take a number system ... but it just gets claustrophobic in there, people take too many numbers and don't listen ... OMG i hate it. I'd rather have a LINE (like at bi-rite...) \nThey do have togo half gallons that cost a little shy of $10 and some interesting ice cream cakes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-27", "description": "So after nearly five decades and 1200 + reviews this place is still going pretty strong. For a weekend outing with the family, I figured an ice cream parlor would be a perfect getaway from the stress of real life and to reacquaint with the kid at heart. Mitchell's apparently holds some stellar awards annually at a couple of state fairs and even with the touch of Filipino influence it was enough to convince me to give it a shot.\n\nDriving across the impacted Bay Bridge and into Noe Valley, finding parking was like playing hot wheels cars in a lego house, no bueno or space at all. Arriving at the entrance many people wanted to chill within the relaxing atmosphere with a scoop or two. I sampled a few orders and got a few scoops for myself and the family:\n\nSamples\n\n-The Mexican Chocolate\n-The Mango (their most popular)\n\nOrders\n\n-1 small order of the Kahlua Mocha Cream\n-1 regular order of the Halo Halo\n\nThe Mexican Chocolate was like a bitter dark chocolate version of its rich American Milk Chocolate Counterpart. Imagine Montezuma gone black and bitter like Flavor Flav with the added corny viking hat. The Mango was pretty sweet and rich and it reminded me of a half White and half Mexcan girl I crushed on back during freshman year of college.\n\nThe Halo Halo flavor was decent, and a different approach to the typical Magnolia Ice Cream brand I was accommodated to growing up. It almost look like a hybrid of Ube and Black Bean but much different in texture. Didn't really taste half of the halo halo flavors, but it satisfied the family sharing. The Kahlua flavor was decent, sweet with a hint of the coffee liquor as an after taste. Nothing really surprising here (guess I'm becoming quite picky).\n\nOverall, spent about $7.00 with tax and tip. The line could be managed better but with the ticket servicing it made things much easier to deal with. As for the rating well time gave it a solidified foundation of support over the years and they're making efforts to provide new flavors so kudos in that department. It was great to see the city but now I need to head off to Humphry Slocombe and see what's with all the hype over there!", "author": "Ryan M."}

I can definitely see why. A varied menu of super creamy ice cream make this an easy spot to love.\n\nWhen approaching the address I began to think that I had entered the wrong neighborhood. My mistake, it just turns out that Mitchell's is situated by itself on the road. It was easy to spot because of the line trailing out of the establishment.\n\nI was really shocked to find that they use a number taking system similar to the ones found at meat shops. I suppose they learned their lesson a long time ago. This system works well. My number was 45 yet they were only on number 20. I estimate it was a 15 minute wait.\n\nI had a double scoop of mexican chocolate and a new flavor called \"salty n' sweet peanut\" in a waffle cone. The peanut ice cream lived up to the salty and sweet title, I didn't expect there to be whole nuts in the ice cream. I would have preferred chopped peanuts or no peanuts. It was too much for my mouth: salty, sweet, super crunchy. The mexican chocolate is good.\n\nThe ice cream is super creamy. I tend to bite my ice cream but this demanded a licking. It melts really fast too. I'd advise going the single scoop route. After eating my cone I felt like I had eaten a bar of cookie dough.

Okay fine, I'll give it 3.  Now can I stay?\n\nAfter going to a party in Lemos Farm in Half Moon Bay, we decided to make the extra half-hour trip up here to FINALLY try Mitchell's.  We've heard numerous people recommend this place to us and because of it's far proximity to Campbell, we never were able to try it.  The 30-minute drive was too long.  The anticipation was killing me!  Mitchell's supposedly had the best ice cream north of....... that stinky patch of freeway on the 5 (Kinda turned you off of food now, huh?).  Anyway, as I turn from Valley Drive onto San Jose Ave, I see tons of people outside the shop.  Great.  Just great.  After circling the block 3 times, I finally find a spot right in front of the shop.  This has to be an omen.  God wants me to get this ice cream.  I don't care how long I have to wait in line.  Only thing, there's no line.  Why?  Because they have a number system.  I feel like I'm in 99 Ranch.  They're at #19.... next number has to be 30 max.  Pull ticket to reveal....... 60!!  Huh?  No way there's 41 people ahead of me.  Oh well.  If God wants me to get ice cream, I guess I can wait an hour.  Luckily, most of the numbers between 19 and 61, left.  Wait time: 25 minutes.  Score!  There were about 7 or 8 \"ice cream scooper uper persons\" behind the counter.  All of them were friendly.  I pick out 4 scoops, 2 for me, 2 for my lovely wife and go on my merry way.  The 4 scoops:  Oreo Cookies, Macapuno, Halo Halo, and Ube.  \n\nThe Verdict?  \nOreo Cookies - My favorite.  Better than any store bought version of this flavor.\nMacapuno - Too heavy on the coconut taste.  Almost like oil was used.\nHalo Halo - Decent.  Tasted like the dessert.  On the other hand, my favorite part of Halo Halo is the leche flan.\nUbe - Got this for Karen.  I'm not a fan usually, so I didn't like it.\n\nBottom line is that I don't think it's worth the drive.  I'm known for driving hours for good food and this doesn't make the list.  In my opinion, Marianne's in Santa Cruz is 3 times better.  They won't have as many of the tropical flavors, but their ice cream is superior.\n\nSide notes:  They have different take home sizes and ice cream cakes, too.

Unfortunately, while the ube wasn't totally amazing, the rest of Mitchell's offerings definitely didn't disappoint!\n\nGood things\n- Tropical flavors: This is the first thing I noticed when I stepped inside the shop. There is an entire section of ice cream flavors dedicated to their tropical flavors, including the aforementioned avocado (really creamy and delicious, but too much for an entire full scoop), halo-halo (a combination of ube, sugar palm dried fruit, pineapples, beans, and this greenish jelly called buko, it was really unique and a great creamy consistency that the ube flavor was missing by itself). The coconut pineapple was awesome and much, much better than the scoops I had at Rite-Aid growing up :) Mango was just okay. The bright hue made me feel like there were tons of artificial coloring in it.\n- Horchata: Their horchata flavor is one of the best I've had, so good that it deserves its own bullet point! There are caramel ribbons in it, which probably doesn't make it super authentic, but caramel anything is amazing. \n- Size/price ratio: A single scoop is $3.20 (not in a fancier cone though, that's extra) but its a really large scoop. A double scoop is $5.20 but it's seriously enough for a meal.\n- Ticketing system: Why don't all ice cream shops do this?? It's so much more effective than having a massive line. You go in, pull a number from the machine near the door and wait until they call your number over the loud speaker.\n\nOther notes\n- Ice cream has a really creamy consistency. If you're from the Bay Area, this ice cream would be more like Fenton's vs. Bi-Rite or Ici. I'm not as big of a fan of the creaminess, so it wasn't as amazing to me.\n- A single scoop is limited to a single flavor :(\n\n\n\n\n\n- Credit cards require $10 minimum so bring cash if you're not going for an ice cream overload\n- There's a parking lot in the back, but you're better off finding parking on the streets during busy weekends", "author": "Shira C."}

Now that it's in print, I realize I've forgotten to make the trek and we'd better get over there before the crowds got out of Sunday church. \n\nHubby moaned and groaned, then sighed.  Humor me, OK?  Foodies do that, they read about it in the paper and they have try it.  It's a sickness, OK?  \n\nHe doesn't like the neighborhood because he got a ticket in the past for parking just 1 inch over, into the red painted DMV curb of someone's driveway and they called the DMV to give him a ticket at 6:45PM.  It's parking ticket PTSD.\n\nWhen we got to Mitchell's and found out they have parking in the rear for at least 6 cars, he was beside himself, \"I like this place!\"  OK, Mr. Elephant. \nNo crowds. I think to myself,  What time?  They're all still in church.  Hurry.... get the ice cream and run before the crowds arrive.  The store must've been alerted about the publication because they were overrunned with ice cream scoopers behind the counter.  I tasted the coconut and young coconut and Halo Halo.  Got a scoop of the young coconut and a pint of chocolate and a 1/2 gal of oreo cookie.  Hubby got the chocolate and started licking like a fiend.  By the time we got back to the car with our treasures, his lip was all encircled with choc ice cream and he looked like one of those milk moustache commercials gone crazy.  The freezers are filled with 1/2 gal containers of their ice cream, so you need to ask for a taste of the ice cream before you buy the whole thing, under $10,  which is cheaper than a couple of pints of their ice cream. Scoops are about $2.80. \n\nThe oreo ice cream was OK, a tad too sweet for me but had huge chucks of oreos in it.  Jr. Yelpers went insane over it.  I liked the young coconut but would pick Polly Anne's coconut over this one.  The chocolate?   To die for.  It was good, and I'm not a chocolate ice cream fan.  Spoonful after spoonful of this choc ice cream will put a smile on your face and a happy sigh of contentment.", "author": "Ry T."}

They have so many flavors you can't even imagine, fruits you have never heard of, combinations of flavors you'd never imagined would be good. They also have the good ol' standbys, like vanilla, chocolate, Mexican chocolate, pumpkin, cookies and cream, grasshopper, mint chip...okay, those aren't the most common standbys, but I swear by them. Oh, and around the holidays their eggnog is to die for!\n\nThe negative: they are always packed and if you go on a weekend night the wait is crazy, parking can be a complete pain, and there is no where to sit and enjoy your scoop - you have to take it and eat it on the sidewalk, in your car in the parking lot, or on the drive home.", "author": "Natasha Anna A."}

To make things fast and efficient, they use a numbering system. You walk in, pull your tag and wait to be called. This place can get pretty packed after school and work hours, but they seem to handle it pretty well.\n\nOne of my recent discoveries & favorite flavors is Grasshopper pie. It's so amazing!! It combines there of my favorite ingredients: Oreos, Fudge and Mint Ice Cream! Great for those who love cookies-n-cream or chocolate flavors in general. My girlfriend ordered the cantaloupe and it was delicious. Very fresh, creamy and authentic tasting.\n\nYou can even buy ice cream tubs their flavors to take home, as well as ice cream cakes and pies (I have yet to try one).\n\nThe only downside to this place is the parking (they have a very small lot in the back, but that fills up fast, unless you go before 4pm). You'll have to stick to street parking, take public transit or have one of your buddies on stand by in the car.", "author": "Andrew C."}

As such it's processed rather in order like the DMV or the Passport Office, which is to say in spurts, and with an interminable wait.  Still, for good product, it's understandable, and Bi-Rite Creamery does make us suffer more dearly ...\n\nBut the product -- well, the ice cream's texture is almost as if there's gum arabic in there somewhere.  You can almost chew it.  The chocolate ice cream isn't bitter at all, it's rather like a Hershey's bar.  Mexican chocolate is quite nice but it's not really all that interesting after a few bites.  The mint flavor tastes like those little Andes mints you get in diners.  \n\nWhat irks me the most about Mitchell's, though, and mostly gets me to three stars, is their boasting about their \"local\" credentials on signs in their windows -- while having stacks and stacks of Pepperidge Farms cookies, Smucker's Jam, etc. -- basically crap from the Safeway next door.  We're supposed to believe they are SO wholesome, serving home-made ice cream since 1957, a beacon of the community, but they can't get fresh cookies from a bakery down the street, or home-made jam in an area known for the very best.\n\nBasically they're a part of the community when it's convenient for them.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-03", "description": "I came here for at least two reasons: one being that this parlor generates as much hype as Bi-Rite has, and let's not kid ourselves Bi-Rite f**king is delicious. The other reason being that they sell ube ice cream. Sure I could have easily gone to my local Seafood City or Island Pacific to cop some in the frozen section, but where's the fun in that? Beside, Mitchell's actually make it on site. How can I say no to fresh ube ice cream?\n\nSo a huge plus for this place is that they have a mini parking lot in the back, hence reducing the amount of time to look for parking on the street should you get lucky. It has the authentic ice cream parlor feel to it, and you can see the rows of pepperidge farms cookie bags on the window to take home and enjoy with your ice cream. EDIT: the owner emailed in regard to my review. Thanks for the clarification that they use fresh Otis Spunkemeyer cookies to make your precious ice cream sandwich ($2.95), should you decide to cop one of these bad boys. Yes, they sell cakes too. \n\nAs opposed to Bi-Rite where you wait in line as though you're going to the club, you just pick a number from that oh so common red ticket device and just huddle around the counter to see what flavors you want. Sorta unorganized but the number calling justifies it. \n\nAnyway, I got to try the ube on a waffle cone and it was everything I hoped it would be, and then some. The portion is just as generous as Bi-Rite gives, but they don't allow you to have an extra flavor per size as Bi-Rite does in order to give the customer more flexibility. Still delicious nonetheless. I also got to sample the grasshopper and it was pretty flavorful as well. The hints of mint and fudge complemented each other real well, and its something I'd consider trying next time since almost everyone else I was with decided to get it.\n\nWorth the hype to me.

Not knowing what to get, I wanted to try the Mexican Chocolate however the they were completely out of Mexican Chocolate behind the counter however they had the quart sizes available. While waiting in line,  I noticed  some kids frantically looking for Mexican Chocolate in the freezer and finally found it and boy were they happy. I was thinking about snatching the last one but remembered we were moving the next day and was concerned the ice cream wasn't going to hold well during our move. So our number was called, I decided to get Rocky Road Ice Cream and my fianc\u00e9 got something with chocolate and peanuts. One thing is for certain, Rocky Road Ice Cream from Mitchell's is soooooo much better than store bought Rocky Road. I usually have a little bit of ice cream because I have this paranoia that I'm lactose intolerant but after almost finishing the entire cup, I come to learn I'm immune to dairy. I hear that Ube is one of the most popular ice creams in Mitchell however I have this phobia of Ube since I was a little girl. When my sisters and I had birthdays, we would wish for chocolate cake for our birthdays but seems to never fail we would end up with ube and utter dissapointment. If I was going to give Ube a try, someone would need to hold me down and shoove a spoonful of Ube ice cream into my mouth and tell me it taste good. Ugh. So next time when I'm in the city, I'll pick up some Mexican Chocolate.", "author": "Jocelyn T."}

Although \"7x7 Magazine's Big Eat 2010\" highly recommended this flavor, I was worried that the flavor of purple yam in the ube might be too overbearing, but luckily, this wasn't the case.  In fact, it tasted more like vanilla.  Still, I prefer Tropical Four (banana, guava, mango & pineapple) only because I love fruits.\n\nTheir staff are friendly and approachable, making it the perfect place for families and childrens.  Unfortunately, seating is limited to two small benches outside, but they are great for couples.  \"Mitchell's\" have their own parking lot around the corner, but if you are in a hurry, they have 10-minute street parking right outside their establishment during store hours for two cars, which is just enough time to eat your ice cream and go.", "author": "Fook W."}

Other contending shops like Bi Rite just don't cut it. Don't get me wrong, I think Bi Rite is plenty tasty, but you know what? It's frou-frou ice cream. Consider me a purist. Flavors like strawberry balsamic may be novel, but flavors like rocky road and thin mint are the ones I crave at 2am on a Sunday night. Mitchell's has the basics down and that's all there is to it.\n\nOf all the creameries I've visited, I think Mitchell's has the richest ice cream out there. A lot of other places may excel in flavor and lack in texture or vice versa, but Mitchell's is right on the nose with both. I usually am not a fan of nuts in ice cream, but I will devour tubs of Mitchell's black walnut and pistachio flavors. There's something magical in the base vanilla ice cream they use. Probably LSD. \n\nI haven't tried many of their tropical/Filipino inspired flavors, although admittedly I enjoy the mango from Polly Ann better.\n\nThe bottom line: Go to Mitchell's for some damn solid classic ice cream flavors.", "author": "Amy C."}

That and a tub of young coconut ice-cream. \n\nI got: Rum Raisin and white pistachio in a waffle cups.

I had better pistachios gelato else where. But not dissapointing, there was a lot of pistachio in the ice-cream and I could taste the pistachio flavors that was so distingue. Good! \n\nOverall, if you are in the neighborhood and don't mind standing in line (trust me, is worth the wait and it will take you that long to decide on the flavors anyway considering the ginormous amount of choices to choose from).

Here's why:\n\nIce cream: C+ |  My ice cream sandwich (chocolate chip ice cream between chocolate chip cookies) was mediocre.  Even the prepackaged ice cream sandwiches you buy at the gas station taste better.  The cookies were frozen solid, and the ice cream was just like any generic brand supermarket ice cream.  Seriously, what's the hype?  Why is this place so popular?\n\nCustomer service: A+ | The guy behind the counter was really nice, despite working in a busy and hectic environment.  I'll have to give them that.

I became a bit nervous because I only had my debit card on me.  I looked all over the place for a \"Cash only\" sign but didn't find anything, so I figured that they took debit cards.  So I they finally called my number and when I asked them if they took debit cards, the guy said, \"Ahhh.. yes, but there's a $10 minimum.\"  So I had to scramble all over the store for something else to buy to exceed the minimum.  I ended up grabbing a $7 box of processed cookies (which turned out stale and awful, by the way), thinking that the ice cream had better be worth the damn 10 bucks.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nSo can someone please tell me.... what's the damn hype?", "author": "Chiara H."}

Bad decision!  Now we can never go back to buying ice cream at the supermarket.  The ice cream is so creamy and full of flavor that you really notice the difference compared to the national brands.  Although a half gallon is $9.85, it's actually not as expensive as it might seem since Mitchell's ice cream has much less air compared to the stuff sold in supermarkets.  And compared to price of a pint of ice cream at Bi-Rite, Mitchell's is a deal!", "author": "Stephanie B."}

First off, Mitchell's totally kicks Bi-Rite's trendy ass.  I mean, I actually really love Bi-Rite ice cream but Mitchell's is just so much more REAL.  I mean, all sorts of REAL people go there to enjoy their ice cream.  And there's no stodgy LINE, but you pick a number and then mill about with all the other folks waiting for their ice cream.  I drove by Bi-Rite on my way home, and saw that line full of white hipsters pouring out of the place and just wanted to yell, \"go to Mitchell's\" out the window.  \n\nPerhaps I am a wanna be white hipster.  Or perhaps I am now an old, former wanna be white hipster, and I have sour grapes.  I'll own it.  But still, Mitchell's represents an out for ice cream experience that Bi-Rite just never will.\n\nSo one last comment, which is about the new flavor \"sweet and salty peanut\".  This is perhaps the best ice cream I have ever tasted.  Carmel ice cream, which is a very subtle taste because the overall flavor is so salty.  Yet sweet.  (Hence the name I guess)  And it is simple.  No chocolate chunks or swirls to distract.  Just the perfect amount of Spanish peanuts.  Really just so incredible.  Much as I love the seasonal cantaloupe flavor, I am so glad I went with this one.", "author": "Judith S."}

We decided Mitchell's would be shorter line than Bi-Rite's, but I don't think that was true in the end. :) Also, we were going to put the two ice-creameries to the test!\n\nI still haven't had Bi-Rite's yet, but I loved Mitchell's! Creamy yummy goodness. I sampled Mexican chocolate and Halo Halo (a Filipino fruity tropical flavor), and liked both. Though, I decided to order us a combo pint of Grasshopper Pie (mint chocolatey goodness) and Mocha Fudge, and both were delicious. I preferred the Mocha Fudge, however.\n\nI definitely recommend Mitchell's, and there are some really intriguing flavors that I want to return to try.

The perfect day was yesterday, when the Giants clinched the 2010 NL West division title.\n\nMItchell's  has the normal strawberry and chocolate flavors but what stands out are the tropical flavors on their menu. A couple of my favorites are mango and ube (purple yams). I love mango ice cream and mitchell's has the perfect recipe. You can taste the rich flavoring and how fresh their ice cream ice. The ube is awesome too. The purple coloring might look weird but do not be discouraged. This flavor is not bitter and not too sweet at all.\n\nSince I moved out of the city I can not always make it to mitchell's. Luckily mitchells vendors to bay area asian markets.

This ice-cream is not special in any way, same fat, same chemicals and calories. You can buy the same or better tasted ice-cream in a grocery store.

My friend liked the avocado flavor.

Here they are below:\n\nThai Tea:  I merely sampled this one, but as a frequent drinker of thai tea, the coldness of this dampened the sweet bitter taste that I'm used to when drinking this as a beverage. \n\nTaro: Typical of most taro flavors I've had when buying Magnolia ice cream or Polly Ann's from the ice cream.  Probably not worth the wait in line if you're going to be ordering this.  Better bought at a grocery store :). \n\nHalo Halo: I ended up deciding on this one, eager for something a little different.  The purple color matches taro ice cream, but is sweeter and has less of a coconut flavor.  The halo halo is sugary, and not fruity, and managed to be relatively creamy.  Dispersed within the the ice cream, there were bits and pieces of jelly and sweet beans that my taste buds found as little surprises. I liked how these added to vary the consistency of the ice cream. \n\nOverall the ice cream was good, but in terms of price and quantity, but I probably won't be going back here unless they offered a really hard to find/new flavor.

Halo halo used to be one of my favorites until they put gummy candy in it; I ended up picking them out. If Mitchell's has 35 flavors and 3 are not my type, that leaves 32 that are and that equals 91.4%, which is still an A grade. You need to come here more than once - unless you plan to get 5 cones and eat them all - so that you can have their classic American flavors (e.g., dulce de leche, strawberries and cream), their tropical flavors (e.g., ube, lucuma, coconut pineapple), and their seasonal options (e.g., ginger snap, egg nog). The best seasonal items come out during the winter. IThis place has PLENTY of business during the winter time. There is no bad season to eat good ice cream after all.\n\nSo, grab your cash (used to be cash only but now there's a minimum amount), your dinner appetite (you'll be glad that you are going against mom's rules of no ice cream before dinner since you'll be eating ice cream as dinner), and your prayers to the parking gods (parking here is a huge pain during peak times) and head on over. \n\nP.S. I don't know how the workers stay so thin. I'd be ready for gastric bypass if I worked there.\nP.P.S. On hot summer days, the wait gets very long. If you're willing to loosen your belt a few notches, get the gallon ice cream that's pre-packed so you can bypass the line.", "author": "Gwen L."}

For my first time, I just bought a tub of ube for my family so it was quick, easy, and painless. I knew I wanted to come back to try their flavors on an ice cream cone though. And yesterday night, I did just that! After dinner, my person and I decided to get some ice cream. When we drove past Mitchell's, we saw a whole mass of people standing outside and were a bit hesitant of whether or not we wanted to wait in line. My person clearly wanted some ice cream because he said that I could even wait in the car and he would wait in line by himself. Oh what a sweetie but of course my conscious wouldn't let that happen. We parked in the small lot behind the store and by then, our stomachs were super super ready for some ice cream. Grabbed a number (27)..ehh not too bad since they were at 13 already. It turned out pretty well since it gave me enough time to look through the whole menu and all the colorful tubs of ice cream to decide which one I wanted with my waffle cone. In the end I decided white pistachio. I tried the chocolate with fudge (something along those lines), it was good but a little too sweet for my taste. The white pistachio was light and just right for me. My person got \"young coconut\" (I will never understand the difference of \"young\" and regular coconut....) and he kept getting excited whenever he ate a big piece of coconut. Delicious I'm guessing. \n\nI'll definitely be back to try more of their flavors! :3", "author": "Judith L."}

I think most people find their favorite and are instant addicts. \n\nI remember coming here ever since I was a young girl with my family just to pick up a gallon of ice cream for a Sunday afternoon treat or gallons of ice cream for family parties. My favorite thing about this place that is has alot of non traditional ice cream shop flavors....I'd actually consider them kind of exotic (but they are listed under tropical)....ehhh I guess the same thing. My favorite flavors are Macapuno (young coconut), Buco (coconut), and Ube (the purple ice cream in many of the pics shown). Many other of my family's favorites are the Mango and Avacado.\n\nOnce you find the flavor/flavors you like, I'd suggest to go for the GALLONS since it is more cost effective and you get to enjoy their yummy ice cream alot more times. Man....A gallon of ice cream can last months. ALRIGHT!!!\n\nThis place is always packed, even when it's not even sunny or hot in Frisco.

As I was pulling out of their parking lot on 26th St and San Jose Ave, I thought about Mitchell's, which was just around the corner.  \"I haven't been there in a while . . . I should check it out.\"  And later today, I did!\n\nAfter our dinner at Bangkok 900 (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bangkok-900-san-francisco#hrid:v7oBTuNhoO1a9BXzOsGGlQ), we decided to drive to Mitchell's.  Our number was 38, and they were serving number 97.  Only 41 more to go.\n\nMy Fremont friend was skeptical.  \"It'd better be as good as you say it is,\" he said.  After all, waiting in line for 30 minutes in the middle of a residential neighborhood is not as exciting as you might think.  We talked, texted our friends and talked some more.  Finally, our number was up.  \"Thirty Eight!\" yelled the clerk.  \"That's us!\" I said enthusiastically.\n\nI had a waffle bowl with 2 scoops of ice cream and almonds.  I opted for 1 scoop of Strawberries 'n' Cream and 1 scoop of Cantaloupe, flavor of the month.  My friend devoured a pint--yes, a pint!--of Oreo Cookie and Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream\n\nO...M...G!  With YoCup this and SoGreen that, I almost forgot what real ice cream is supposed to taste like.  It was unbelievable, like the ice cream I had as a kid.  Mitchell's is still the best ice cream for my money.  It made me forget the long wait, the absence of tables or chairs and the saturated fat content.  My ice cream tasted creamy and light, and my waffle bowl was crunchy and sugary.\n\nThe lines outside are atrocious, the store is a monument to inefficiency, the parking lot is small and always full, and the amenities are non-existent.  Still, people come from all over the City for some Mitchell's.  There's got to be something to it.  \n\nIf ice cream helped people lose weight, I'd come here every day.

I can understand paying through the nose when you're getting a cone--it's an event--but when you're eating the ice cream at home?  Come on now.\n\nIt's really fun to go all the way across town just for Mitchell's.

Don't worry about the crowd of people waiting inside.  (What are they doing there anyway?)  Grab a ticket and wait for one of the employees to call your number in the most laid back, trying-too-hard-to-be-cool voice.  I think they actually base who calls out the numbers on their style.

Now, you can buy Magnolia filipino ice cream in most specialty shops, but you must definitely patron your local Flips at Mitchell's.\n\nNot just Filipino flavours-- Macapuno and Ube rock-- but tasty Americaine flavours, too.

It needs more creaminess, less water (the ice melts and dilultes everything in a bad way). \n\nOverall, Mitchell's is worth trekking to San Jo Ave and buying several pints at once (they pack a pint ABOVE the rim with special oversized lids to accommodate their generosity and the prices are very reasonable unlike the gelato robber barons!).

Just visited after the recent remodel, and although I nostalgically miss the old timeless d\u00e9cor, the place does look great enough to last for the next 30 years. One of my favorite tricks has been to leave Front Porch 15 minutes before asking for the check to grab my ticket at Mitchell's which can cut the wait time by a significant amount. It's amazing, rain or shine, this place is always packed, although the patrons are mostly locals who are used to it and do so with a smile. Another way to cut the wait line is to jump straight to the pre-packed line. \nThe light but creamy flavor of their coconut ice cream is something you must try if you haven't already.\nWhen I have more time, since they have so many different flavors, you can order take away sizes in pints versus half gallons to save freezer space (and calories). I've also served their ice cream cake at a few of my birthday parties and it's been a big hit each and every time.", "author": "Mark Y."}

Yes but it's necessary because Mitchell's just has too many fans.  I felt dizzy to read the menu sticked on the wall.  How can these substances be used to make ice cream?????  There're so many different choices that I wanted to try to see how it turns out to be.  Of course, I could stuck only a little into my stomach after a filling dinner.\n\nAnother surprising thing is that it's really close by my previous workplace.  After my hubby took me to Mitchell's, I told my co-workers and they just shot to the place during lunch time on the same day.  And, they kept going back later on.  When we're in a good mood, we went there.  When we really needed a break, we went there.  Then, one day when we were layoff at the same time, we went there for a treat to ourselves.  Now, we all work in different companies and none of our offices is close by.  But, we still go back sometimes after our dinner gathering and still find that exciting and fun to just read the menu but cannot make up our minds what to order.\n\nP.S.

You won't even notice the flavor of the ice cream when it's soaked in root beer...is it really worth heading down there and waiting in line?  (To be fair, I found out shortly thereafter that there is a separate express line for prepacked ice cream)\n\nAnyway, we have our homemade root beer floats and I couldn't get over the flavor of the ice cream....it had an unworldly deliciousness to it....and it was just regular old vanilla ice cream for God's sakes, not french vanilla, not dulce de leche, not vanilla swirl... this ish was v-a-n-i-l-l-a-s as Gwen would say... and it blew my freakin mind. \n\nNow I'm kind of scared to go back to one of the more flavorful ice-creams because what if my head asplodes?", "author": "Neej M."}

Goes to show you, how much people lub this place...especially in the winter time. =)\n\nFood: Ice cream galore with many many options. I also saw some specials like halo halo, avacado, ube and many more selections. You name it, they got it. If I had to compare the texture of the ice cream, it would have to be between a creamy dryers/haagen daaz to gelato in Italy! It's not too sweet, and I happen to like it. I had samples of the white pistacio, toasted almond, peppermint candy and coffee. \n\nService: Workers here are nice and friendly (at least the one I had).

I am indebted to them for bringing to me, the love of my dessert filled life.\n\nYou know you are in business when you have to wait in line on a WEDNESDAY night at 10:55pm that goes out the store doors for some ice cream. \n\nTo further that thought, if you are waiting in line that late, you know the ice cream HAS to be good.\n\nYes my friends, both of those thoughts are true. Welcome to the world of Mitchell's Ice Cream - home of the BEST ice cream in the Bay Area. Baskin Robbins (it feels adulterous to even mention that chain in the review of Mitchell's) has NOTHING on this place. NOTHING I SAY!\n\nMy favorite memory of this place is the day I ran the San Francisco Marathon. After finishing, my friend drove us here to get ice cream. Let me tell you, after you run a race, nothing beats ice cream from here - well okay maybe a beer at the finish line, but thats besides the point. \n\nAll of the flavors here are great - but my absolute favorite is Mexican Chocolate, which tastes like a chocolate dipped churro! You want to take it up a step, have that ice cream with some banana ice cream and you will be satisfied.\n\nThis place is the gem of the Mission District. Its been such a long time since I've been here. Perhaps I will go tomorrow for some ice cream, because now, I want some Mexican Chocolate and Banana ice cream in a sugar cone.\n\nPS - the ice cream is so good, that sometimes, on the street corner, I bust out doing the running man to memories of Every Little Step I Take and Ice Ice Baby, because the ice cream is so good, it takes me back to my youth! You can ask any of my close friends about this. They will validate that.", "author": "Brian D."}

And of course they have the festive flavors when those times come around (ie. pumpkin and peppermint). They also have a sundae of the week/month...though I've never tried them, they always look so good!\n\nI usually just get a scoop or two (if i'm goin all out! haha) on a cone or in a cup...but one time, i wanted to try the chocolate dipped ice cream...man, was it worth the mess!

The wall is gone, so it's all open. It's more set up like BR, where you can see into the freezer and on the window is the ice cream flavor name and description.\n\nI did think it was weird that they gave me my two junior scoops in a plastic cap for a cup...Maybe they were running low on supplies? but they never do that...so maybe they're changing their ways? but i gotta say, i liked the paper cups better...i dunno, just personal preference.\n\nThe staff, as always, is friendly yet knows how to move crowds in and out quickly without being rude (it really is a well defined skill).\n\nAnd the ice cream of course, is the same 'ol goodness.

Yeah, I saw interesting names for their ice creams like Mexican chocolate or something. Then I saw the flavor UBE (taro, purple yam) then my eyes nearly popped out. This flavor is like my kryptonite. It's presence alone makes my tongue hang out, my mouth drool and my hands going for my wallet to pay tribute to its awesome flavor. I looked up from their freezer section and looked up at the menu board to see the prices. LO AND BEHOLD, my eyes just so happened to rest upon a picture of a Filipino dessert (I'm Filipino) called HALO-HALO.\nMy eyes almost popped out of their respective sockets.\nI nearly collapsed there and then. My mental state quickly became like a fast train on a railroad track with a mindset to purchasing that dessert. $5 plus taxes later, I got my Halo-halo. It's HUGE!

However, a manager or some worker with clout came out and told us that as long as we had a number before they locked the doors, we'd get served...\n\nWe had #52 and when we got there they were serving #15, so we waited patiently, and waited some more. So 11:35 rolls around and they stop calling numbers and eventually there were no more customers inside. Only the 6 of us, another party of 6 and a third party of 2. \n\nSo the 14 of us went without ice cream. If the worker who came out at 11 and told everyone that people with numbers would be served had instead told us to go home, we could have saved 35 minutes of standing on their sidewalk, expecting a sweet treat. I can empathize with workers who want to go home on the closing shift, but you have to be honest and forthright with your customers. \n\nI had a conversation through the locked door with an employee who said they had called numbers and people stopped responding. That was a flat out lie.  I was holding ticket #52 and the \"NOW SERVING\" board said 44.

After parking 2 blocks away and waiting 10-20 minutes until they call my number, I was starting to get impatient with all of the suspense.  I'll have to say, the wait was worth it.  I sampled several tropical flavors (ube, halo halo, and peruvian fruit) before finally settling down on sweet coconut even though I haven't sampled that one.  Sweet coconuts had actual coconut chunks in it which made me feel less guilty as I gorged the ice cream and the waffle cone down my throat.", "author": "Ronald L."}

It tends to be a bit too creamy and very rich in taste.  Here're my recommended flavors:\n1.  Tropical 4 (all the fresh fruity taste will fire up all your taste buds on your first bite, so deliciously addictive)\n2.  Halo Halo (Need I say more? mixed flavored and fun beans mixed with coconut and purple yam ice-cream)\n3. Ube (Don't be intimidated by its bright purple color, it's not radioactive like I used to thought..  It's the famous purple yam tropical flavor)\n4.

All of the flavors here are reliably good, but what I enjoy the most are the selection of tropical flavors which you don't see often at other shops.  Most of my favorite flavors are those tropical flavors like lychee, ube, green tea, avocado and halo halo.  The ice cream is rich with great texture and good flavor.  On this particular occasion, I got the halo halo sundae with the ube ice cream and the entire mixture of fruits, ice and jelly thingies (it's a technical term).

I'd definitely prefer another ice cream shop. \n\nI also couldn't understand what the hell the employee was saying. I first asked him if I could try a sample of the Mexican Chocolate, because I had no idea what the difference between Mexican Chocolate and regular chocolate is (Mexican has cinnamon in it).

I just gave you my order? and then I say \"I'll just have a double scoop of regular chocolate\".

Unfortunately, there exists 420 miles between my love and I. Sad panda. Anyway, I've had the luxury of visiting Mitchell's twice during trips up north; both times have left me filled to the rim and still craving for more. \n\nTwo summers ago was the first visit, after taking a number and waiting in line for about thirty minutes (it was very crowded, I assume we came around peak hours - 6pm), I requested to taste test about 5 flavors even though I wanted to try just about every single flavor. I felt bad for the employee scooping for me, she was so patient about my indecisive-ness.  After much debating about which flavors to get (if they weren't all delectable, I wouldn't have had such a difficult time, gosh Mitchell's. I joke, please continue serving delicious ice cream), I decided on three scoops in a cup; peach, mango and halo halo. The tropical flavors are amazing, actually, their ice cream in general is amazing, smooth, buttery and very refreshing.\n\nThe second visit was last Christmas, my sisters and I had been raving about Mitchell's and always complained about our constant craving for it; so my parents naturally were very intrigued. This time, my sister (an avid yelper) made sure to read up on when the place would be least populated and we arrived at Mitchell's on a Tuesday around 4:30pm. There were only one or two people, which meant we could taste test any and all the flavors we wanted without having to worry about the customers behind us. My family and I wanted everything... So we compromised, each of us would get the three different scoops in a cup and we'd share. Not a good idea when you absolutely love a particular flavor (Pear Sorbet) and everyone else ends up loving it just as much; needless to say, my scoop of Pear was completely demolished after a few bites. Which left me with the Kahlua Mocha Cream and Jackfruit scoops, not that I dislike them or anything, those flavors taste wonderful. There is just something about that Pear sorbet though...I can't shake the taste off my tongue, so savory, it was like biting into a real pear but better. Ever since then, eating ice cream in So Cal just hasn't been the same; like my taste-buds are missing something from their little lives.", "author": "Chriss P."}

Each time I'd look longing at all the other flavors, do the taste test, then order the same thing I alwasy did, scoop of coffee on a sugar cone, never dipped.

I will forever be grateful for this Mom and Dad!  I live down the peninsula and have taken may trips to the city, just to get Mitchell's and nothing else!\n\nMitchell's just recently remodeled, but the quality and experience are still the same!  The ice cream is perfectly flavored and creamy!  The customer service is pretty good, considering they have to wait on what seems to be a billion people an hour.\n\nWhat to expect:\n\n1. No parking.  There is a very small lot behind Mitchell's, that, to be honest, usually has a spot open or you can wait a few minutes and there should be someone leaving.  But don't be fooled, many people eat in there car because there are few places to eat outside.  Just be forewarned, don't go on an empty tank of gas, because you might have to circle the block or double park!\n\n2. There will be a mob outside!  This only means that the ice cream is that good.  I have only been a few times where I just walked right in.  The line is actually very helpful for those who don't know what they are getting, it gives you some time to determine what you want.\n\n3.  Take a number!  There is a number dispenser to the left of the doorway when you enter.  They do go strictly by the number system.  If you don't grab one, you don't get Mitchell's.  If you are grabbing one of their pre-made ice cream cakes or a pre-packed gallon of ice cream, you do not have to grab a number, there is a special window just for you!\n\n4. You will be overwhelmed.  It's true.  There are many, many, many choices ranging from tropical to traditional to seasonal.  But remember #2: the line will help you buy time to decided.  The workers are very generous to let you sample flavors.  There will be flavors you never even thought they could make, so naturally you will have to sample.  My personal favorites are coconut pineapple, orange sherbet and grasshopper pie.  They also have millions of different ways to eat your ice cream: cookie sandwich, milkshake, cone, sundae and so on!\n\n5. There are no places to sit.  There are a couple benches outside and that's it.\n\n6. There might be a lady soliciting money.  She usually sits right outside when I've seen her.  No big deal, but I always end up feeling bad.\n\n7.  Bring cash.  They do take card, for minimum orders of I believe $10.  So, anything less than requires cold hard cash.\n\n8. It's small.  Mitchell's is not for the claustrophobic.  You will have to slither through the crowd to get your number then to get to the counter then to leave.  There is a lot of shifting around.  Be prepared to get cozy with your neighbor.\n\nI think now you are fully prepared to make your trek to the best ice cream in the city!", "author": "Michelle V."}

However, it was late at night on a cold Tuesday, so that may be the time to go.\n\nBecause of the unbusiness, I got to try the halo-halo flavored ice cream and my friends tasted about 4 flavors each (they aren't from here, don't quite get that you can't taste every flavor). While the halo-halo was good, I was in a more classic mood, so I opted for white pistachio and new york cherry. Both were good, but New York cherry was a bit too sweet for me. And it melted all over the pistachio, so I didn't get as much of the flavor I liked.\n\nMy friends got rocky road and toasted almond and enjoyed them both, however we wanted to try an actual halo-halo and at the last minute backed out. As much as I wanted to know what it tasted like, I wasn't sure I wanted to down a huge container of beans and ube ice cream.\n\nWe took home the peach and cantaloupe ice cream (since cantaloupe is seasonal, we wanted to try it before it was gone). Both are good, however the cantaloupe was my favorite. As much as I love all the flavors of ice cream, I'd like Mitchell's a lot more if it were an ice cream parlor. But that might be crazy considering how busy it already is!\n\n-1 star because I noticed they use Smuckers hot fudge/chocolate sauce/caramel toppings. Somewhat unforgivable... even if you only specialize in ice cream, can't you find a company that makes better toppings than Smuckers?!?", "author": "Amanda C."}

Although its a little too sweet for my taste, I can see why so many people love this place.

His first job when he came to the U.S. was making ice cream for a cafe, before becoming a chemist. He loves mixing up stuff. \n\nAnyway, since we heard so much about this place, we decided to head over one afternoon, hoping to avoid the insane lines everybody talks about.  Line was reasonable, so we took a number and waited about 10 min. to get 4 hand-packed pints of ice cream in different flavors. Then I took him home and we had a taste test.  \n\nStrawberry: nice aroma, but utterly average strawberry flavor\nVanilla: not vanilla-y enough, they use cheap extract instead of the real thing (\"where are the seeds?\")\nDulce de Leche: lacks the slightly \"baked\" flavor of real Dulce de Leche, otherwise good\nRocky Road: very good concentrated chocolate flavor, but there were about 5 nuts and marshmallows in the entire pint (\"where are the rocks\")\n\nConsistency was very smooth for all flavors. His verdict was \"fine if it's down the street\", but not worth driving for it to the other side of town.", "author": "Ksenya Z."}

My dad used to work for an ice cream company and I used to work for a chocolate company, so that pretty much sums it up.\n\nI think Mitchell's is totally overrated. I went there on a very busy Friday night, which I had expected. Here are the rules.\n\n1. Unless you want pre-packed, grab a number immediately, before you even look inhale the ice cream parlor air.\n2. Be warned, the exotic flavors don't really taste like anything. I tried purple yam and baby coconut and they had no flavor. Try everything you want to try, the people are nice. And you waited 20 minutes to get to that spot in line, so make the most of it. Everyone does. They specialize in more exotic flavors like you find in Hawaii and you can get red bean.\n\nThe ice cream tastes like Swensen's or slightly better than Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone. High butterfat, good quality. Not earth shattering.\n\nIf you like chunks and mix-ins, nobody does it like Ben & Jerrys. And its nothing unusual, no tang like frozen custard. \n\nOverall, stop by and support local, fresh made ice cream if you're in the neighborhood.", "author": "Alissa S."}

I've heard about Mitchell's before, so when I visited SF this past May with my friends, I made sure to visit it.\n\nWe made three damn trips--and it was all worth it.  Mitchell's is smallish, and the parking in the back is kinda small, but never mind that.  There is always a crowd of people waiting in the front, and it's cool to overhear other people making their decisions out loud, and a cool way to strike up a conversation with locals.  The flavours are extensive, but I have to say what really attracted me was the Filipino flavours of ice cream-ube, langka (jackfruit), buko, macapuno, and tropical four.  \n\nChinatown Ice Cream Factory in NYC doesn't even come close in my book.\n\nDefinitely make Mitchell's a \"must do\" when you come to SF.", "author": "anna m."}

Their Thai Tea ice cream is one of my all time favorite flavors. I've never seen it anywhere else and despite always wanting to branch out I consistently came back to it. Not surprisingly, their other offerings are equally delicious. Mexican chocolate is a nice spin on the original plain chocolate and Chocolate Caramel Crackle should be illegal. Perfectly creamy chocolate with soft caramel ripples and pieces of nestle crunch bars. Ooohh! Kahlua Mocha cream makes for a good Kahlua Mocha Cream milkshake (but you'll have to take it home to try that one!). \n\nI should mention that I am lactose intolerant and ice cream makes me deathly ill, so for me to be willing to go through that pain to eat their ice cream should be some indication of how amazing it is. \n\nWhen I feel like I should be good to my digestive system I'll go for their mango or pear sorbet, but it isn't too often I want to be good when they've got great staples and seasonal winners (Pumpkin and Eggnog).\nThe line is always long and I wish there was somewhere to sit but that's  hardly a deterrent from their shop.

When it was empty (which was rarely) we would burst with joy, and when it was busy we would pace impatiently, looking at the menu, deciding if we would go with the regular or branch out and try something new.\n\nBack in the day, I always had internal dialogs concerning whether to choose the Oreo Cookie or the Milk Chocolate (which is sadly no longer offered.)  Milk chocolate usually won, as my 12 year old self rationalized that Oreo Cookie could be acquired almost anywhere, but Milk Chocolate was a rare treasure.\n\nI recently meandered into Mitchell's for the first time in quite a while with a friend of mine and ordered the Oreo Cookie.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-28", "description": "-Updated Update-\n\nI have a new favorite flavor. Macapuno (sweet coconut). Oh. My. Golly. It's strange because I used to hate coconut-flavored things (and I still largely do) but Macapuno makes me want to climb a coconut tree and shout for joy. It's delicately sweet and oh-so-creamy and I like the occasional soft, small coconut chunks rather than Buko's (young coconut) strips of coconut. \n\n-End of Updated Update-\n\n-Update-\n\nDid I mention that I like cake? Did I mention that my favorite kind of cake is ice cream cake? I grew up on good ol' Baskin Robbins so I didn't know that things like Mitchell's ice cream cake existed. Hands down, the best ice cream. Ever. \n\nSo here's the skinny. You have two choices for ice cream cake: \n\n1) Head to the right when you enter the store. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. Do not grab a ticket - you don't need to! Mitchell's has a special place for those who are grabbing ready-to-go items like pre-packed half gallons (to the right and left of the store entrance in long freezers) and birthday pies/cakes. There is a tall freezer immediately to your right with a disappointing selection of ice cream cakes and pies. By disappointing, I mean the flavors I don't like as much like Mocha and Kahlua. You can grab your cake/pie and head straight to the counter near the little door at the right (there's a sign that says Express Items or something), wave your cake/pie about 'til you catch someone's eye and pay up. You CANNOT try to order a cone while you're here. Don't cheat the ice cream gods. By the way, feel free to ask what other flavors they might have in the back. I've walked away with Strawberry and Mexican Chocolate before.\n\n2) By far my favorite method, this way requires more time and planning. You can call ahead or walk in and plan your own birthday cake (http://mitchellsicecream.com/html/order.htm if you want to check out the info online) but it has to be at least TWO DAYS IN ADVANCE for 7\" - 1/4-sheet cakes and all pies and FOUR DAYS IN ADVANCE for 1/2-sheet and full-sheet cakes. Sorry, I wasn't yelling, just warning y'all. You get to choose your ice cream flavor, your cake and the ice cream flavor that covers the cake.\n\nYes. Ice cream covers the cake instead of cream. Ingenious!!! \n\n-End of Update-\n\nDo you know anyone who doesn't like ice cream? I don't think I do but if you do, take 'em to Mitchell's. Oh, Mitchell's, with your ridiculously long line and awesome flavors like ube (purple yams - which, by the by, are freaking delicious if you just bake them in the oven at 425 for about 45 minutes. I digress.). Good luck finding parking. You may have to walk for a bit, but I assure you that the sweet goodness is worth it. It's more than likely that you'll find a crowd gathered around the front and inside the place. Wrestle your way to the ticket machine (right to the left when you enter) and grab a number and hang around until you hear your number called. I'm one of those folks who gets awfully apologetic and self-conscious when there are a lot of people waiting behind me but I still ask to try flavors if I can't make up my mind. The ice cream is really creamy and delicious. It's a nice compromise between the liquid gold of Bi-Rite and the more solid but still delicious Joe's. Even plain-Jane vanilla and chocolate are flavorful and rich and creamy. Do yourself a favor, stop reading this review and go buy some Mitchell's. \n\nFlavor recommendations, you ask? My favorite is Pralines 'N' Cream. But Mexican Chocolate, Strawberry, Grasshopper Pie, Cookies 'N' Cream and anything, really, are a good bet. Don't be shy about asking to taste flavors!", "author": "Christine P."}

You can go to Mitchell's on at 9:30pm on a cold, rainy January night in San Francisco, and there's still a huge line! The wait is always worth it. \n\nMitchell's is a great slice of the Bay Area. On one hand, it's a great slice of old time Americana. It's a family owned business, the ice cream excels at what you traditionally think ice cream should be, it's incredibly creamy and wonderful. However, they take that great old school ice cream and incorporate the flavors of the surrounding multicultural area (their traditional flavors are awesome too). \n\nMitchell's is a place for people who like good ice cream. They're dedicated to making simply the best, most tastiest ice cream possible. It's not about bells and whistles, or making flavors simply for the sake of being interesting or having novelty value.

Of the 3 flavor, I liked the Ube the most, not too sweet and it was delish, it's also funny because I expected Ube [sweet potato] to taste kind of nasty...well at least the thought of it in my head.

In my opinion, Mitchell's is hands down the best place to get ice cream in SF. Don't let the long lines discourage you, especially if you come during the evening or weekends. Nowhere else will you find a wider variety of flavors, ranging from the mundane (but good nonetheless) vanilla and rocky road to the exotic buko (aka baby coconut) and mango (my personal fave!!). For those who are health conscious and/or lactose intolerant, Mitchell's has plenty of great sorbets as well.\n\nHelpful tip: if there seems to be a wait, grab a number ticket from the dispenser near the entrance. They'll call your number when they're ready to get your order.", "author": "Christine T."}

The ice cream is unlike any other that I've had in the past. The texture is creamy and milky with a strong chocolate flavor. They didn't skimp on the marshmallow and nuts. I had a chunk in almost every bite. It was a sweet treat that I wouldn't mind indulging in again. *hint hint*\n\nI have been to the actual location and there always seems to be a line to order.

I lived in Sacramento and I still came here! I now live in central valley and I still come here every chance I get! I found this place thanks to a mention on the Food Network! But those who say this palce is over-rated are WRONG! Yeah, it's a hassle to find parking and to wait your turn, but people do it anyway because the ice cream is good and worth it! \n\nI have strong nostalgic memories of when I was a little girl eating UBE ice cream that came in the Magnolia plastic tubs from the asian supermarket! Years later, I buy the same brand from the market and not only does it taste artificial, it looks artificial! The purple is too bright! Almost highlighter purple! I know they added food coloring! The ube ice cream from the grocery store is just not the same as when they used to make it when I was little! \n\nI was so excited to find pure authentic ube ice cream at Mitchell's! I've tried their macapuno and buko, which are good, but ube is still my favorite! Mitchell's is the only place I know that has it (the good kind, not the fake one from the asian store)! The one at Mitchell's tastes just like how it was when I was little! Not even Marianne's in Santa Cruz has it! I'm Filipino, so I know my ube! If it weren't for Mitchell's, I'd probably have to go to the Philippines myself to find good ube ice cream! REAL ube ice cream! \n\nI don't like the long lines and having to get a number to get your ice cream though! If I lived down the street, I'd buy one of the pre-made ice creams from the freezer and take it home! But since I don't, it would melt in the car during my ride home! The first time I came here, it was on a Friday night and there was a long line! A ton of people waiting inside and outside! I didn't realize there was a numbering system, so by the time I figured it out, I had to wait even longer! It was just too long of a wait! But kind of worth it I guess! \n\nI also don't like the fact that you can't find parking! The little lot in the back is always packed, so you're forced to hunt for something on the streets....and be careful you don't get a ticket! \n\nNot only that, it's a tiny parlor with no seats or tables inside! There just one bench outside. I took my nieces and nephews here one time and since I didn't want them to make a mess inside my car, we had to eat our ice cream in the parking lot in the breeze and cold! They were dripping all over the place and made a big mess on their clothes and hands! I wish they expanded the place, remodeled it, or moved to a new bigger location where people can actually sit down and enjoy the product!\n\nUBE = purple yam or taro", "author": "Sabrina D."}

When he was a kid, he and Larry would cap a good day of fishing by stopping at the soda fountain in Half Moon Bay, where they would get themselves a bowl or cone of strawberry ice cream. \n\n\"Just one scoop,\" recalled Larry Mitchell, whose big brother was buying and he didn't want to push his luck for a double. \n\nMr. Mitchell was a native of San Francisco, where he attended Saint Paul's Elementary School and graduated from Saint James High School. When he and Larry grew up, they decided they wanted to go into business. The Mitchell brothers and their brother-in-law Bob Davis leased a building owned by the family at San Jose Avenue and 29th Street and opened an ice cream store. \n\nThey approached a local dairy about buying cream and hired an expert to teach them everything about making quality ice cream. They filled their shop with equipment and within a week were serving up their homemade recipe. \n\nThe store became popular as word of their delicious ice cream spread. Soon, local restaurant owners were asking to buy the ice cream to serve for dessert. Some would put signs in their window that read \"We sell Mitchell's Ice Cream.\" \n\nA few years later, Davis decided that the business wasn't big enough to support all three partners, so he pulled out. The brothers persevered and began getting a reputation for their unusual flavors such as baby coconut, guava, jackfruit, purple yam, mango and pineapple. \n\n\"It was especially popular with the influx of immigrants who had moved into the Mission,\" Larry Mitchell recalled. \n\nOver the years, Mitchell's Ice Cream won lots of awards -- more than 50 gold, silver and bronze ribbons and two gold medallions -- at California state fairs. \n\nIn 1982, Mr. Mitchell retired from the business and moved with his wife, Lottie, to Santa Rosa. Lottie Mitchell died in 2003, and Mr. Mitchell went to live in a rest home in Millbrae to be closer to his brother. \n\nIn addition to his brother, Mr. Mitchell is survived by sisters Frances Davis and Alice Mitchell, both of the Bay Area.", "author": "miriam b."}

And I would know.  Cause during the summer before my junior year in high school, a couple friends and I got really chill jobs at a local creamery.  [Get it?  Chill like ice cream :) Hilarious, I know. ]  But we would totally kick back, make waffle cones in the morning and just relax until people would come in for their sugar fix.  Having this job primed me for a life long appreciation and obsession with ice cream.  And let me tell you, Mitchell's is by far one of the best creameries I have experienced.  \n\nSo here's what an ice cream aficionado like me should expect from Mitchell's:\n- Parking is limited, we scored rockstar parking right outside, but expect to circle the block a couple times during rushes. \n- First thing you should do is take a number right near the door and be patient.   \n- There are at least 30+ flavors to choose from, but you have plenty time to decide. \n- If you're just buying half gallons or cakes and such, you can use the Express Window to save time. \n- Once your number is called, ask for samples of what you want so you'll be happy with your decision.  I got halo-halo on a sugar cone, but ube and mango were both good.  Avocado was also yummy, but too rich for a whole scoop.  \n- Make an effort to have your money ready.  Cash is easier, but if you want to use your credit card, the minimum is $9.  I don't know why it's $9, kinda random but that's what the sign said. \n- And lastly, make sure to add an additional hour to your cardio workout the next day.  Mitchell's is soo ridiculously creamy, I swear it must be at least 15% butterfat.  But it's really worth every single luscious lick,.. I promise :)", "author": "Joan T."}

Looking at the number we were fifty-nine and they were serving twenty-three. That's right, thirty-six people were ahead of us for ice-cream. That's how good the ice-cream is here. Not enough to convince you...here's a little history. The Mitchell Brothers started this ice cream shop in 1953 as a spin-off from their family's dairy business. This ice cream shop has been open in San Francisco for over FIFTY years. Do you known of any other establishment in a city like San Francisco, where turn over is so high?? It is a true institution. \nEven though there was a lot of people ahead of us, the time it took for us to get served was relatively short because they have four open stations servicing the masses. One window is typically reserved for carry-out items such as quarts or gallons of their ice-cream. Mitchell's is known for their tropical flavored ice-cream but they have oh so much more. If I had to guess there is about forty flavors available for a cone, sundae, or milkshake. Forty flavors...

Once the call your number, which could take quite a while depending on what time you come, you can sample as many flavors as you'd like before deciding on your final choice. I've had the roasted almond ice cream which was amazing, so buttery and rich. Completely almondy goodness.  I also one had the mango lime sorbet which was very refreshing, especially after a rather heavy meal at the Front Porch, which is right down the street. I will definitely be returning to this gold mine, and will be trying their more exotic flavors such as taro, red bean, and young coconut (the difference between this and old coconut is something I would love to do a serious comparison on).\nOkay, time for an update.

Or the times when there would be fighting on who gets the last \"scoop\" of Ube from the freezer. Ahh, so many fond memories. Naturally, I grew up LOVING the tropical flavors that they have and 4 years in the East Coast for college was hard without it! You don't know what real ice cream is like until you've had Mitchell's. I'm not sure whether it's just the ice cream, or the entire Mitchell's experience, but whatever it is, I'll never get tired of coming back here. So here's 5 million stars for the best and simply most divine ice cream in all of San Francisco, who's had a special place in my heart since I was a little girl. :-)", "author": "Erika I."}

So I went here a couple of days ago, and was surprised at how long the wait was. People really love Mitchell's like really really love it, because I've never seen an ice cream parlour so filled up, that it required \"taking a number\". And me and my cousin waited about 20 minutes, but it was like no big deal. When our number came up, I decided to be really Filipino and order a scoop of ube/taro. It was okay, but it wasn't as good as the ube with macapuno/coconut pieces combination , which they only serve in the half gallon containers.  I actually wish that I just went with the grasshopper pie, because the sample I tried was quite amazing. And I think it would have been so much better if I had it coated with that chocolate hard shell thing. Ohh my god. Droool. Why didn't I?", "author": "April D."}

My friends and I grabbed a number and we waited for 30 minutes. The wait wasn't too bad as I was still deciding what flavor I was craving from the multitude of choices. I narrowed it down to  tropical 4, lychee, or strawberry sorbet. I was obviously craving a fruity dessert. After sampling the tropical 4 (did not like the banana taste) and the lychee sorbet (not something i could eat a lot of) I went for the flavor that would never disappoint - strawberry sorbet. It was really good...I can tell the quality of the strawberry sorbet was superior to that of other ice cream places. \n\nI probably would never drive all the way to SF and wait that long for ice cream unless I just happen to be in the area.

My friends introduced me to this place when I use to come up and visit when they were going to SFSU. Being a southern california native, you would think we had good ice cream joints like this, but I have yet to find one! The long lines are worth the wait, I've visited all seasons of the year, and every time there are long lines (even close to closing hours!). Prepare to head on over with a good group of friends so you can chat while you wait. I've had over 5 of their flavors and each are good. I say try their unique flavors that you aren't likely to find at other ice cream joints, because those are always the ones that are worth going for. If you get the regular flavors you probably wont be as excited just because you can get those anywhere, its all about the new flavors that will always excite you and leave you wanting more. I suggest getting things like Ube (taro), it's something rare and you'll enjoy. The hand dipped ice cream is good too, it gives a twist to the regular ice cream which makes it all the more better. The atmosphere alone is enough to go, its rare to find an ice cream joint pouring with lines of people. This place is only for people who like to wait in lines and enjoy the company of others. So find a group of people and head on over to enjoy some unique flavors or opt for hand dipped classics, the ice cream becomes better with great company.", "author": "Jen A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-06", "description": "Yeah, remember that one* run of like two straight hot summer nights a few Junes back? Pretty sure it was 2009. Anyway, when I got home from work I decided not only to look this meteorologically gifted horse in the mouth, but to slobber all over its shiny beautiful face. That is, I put on a yes v-neck shirt (because it was actually summer!) and walked from my apartment on Laguna Street into the deep Mission, stopping first at Bi-Rite, next at Mitchell's. \n\nTo recap: I was wearing a flimsy t-shirt and pants, and was neither wearing nor carrying for later: a sweater, a scarf, a jacket, a hat. Clearly, if you don't stop for at least two (2) ice creams on a night like that you have either a dead soul or are just not up to the task of living.\n\nBecause this is not a review for Bi-Rite I will let it suffice to say that I am glad someone waited in 84% of the line for me, and while I do think their ice cream is quite good I don't think it's quite good enough to warrant the ceaseless queue for their victuals, a phenomenon I attribute, now that you bring it up, to either laziness (ie, Mitchell's is sooo farrr from Dolores Park) or that curious hipster predilection that makes one want, perhaps even more than the experience of eating the ice cream itself, the experience of waiting in line for the ice cream with all the other beautiful, denimed denizens of the Mission.** \"Dude that line tonight at Bi-Rite was soooo long.\" \"I know, right!\" \n\nSo there was nighttime heat, Bi-Rite, and roughly forty-one gorgeous blocks, all told, and wouldn't you know it when we got there the place was mobbed. Clearly. Why would my now four friends and I be the only quintuplet with something like this idea. So we took a number and--OH MY GOD there are 89 numbers between the next number and ours. So okay fine; we take a walk and [redacted], maybe head to a bar for a drink jesus there's so much time. You can see where this is going. \n\nYeah so we get back like 40 minutes later and dutifully take another number that this time is something like 60 numbers away. Wars have been fought over less than this, obviously, but it's okay. It's warm out and there are all these nice citizens milling around on the sidewalk like moths to 16% butterfat. The second wait wasn't bad, in part because at that hour people were giving up left and right, and we (finally!) ordered at what was it like 11:10***? At this point, I remember two things about my ice cream: that it was delicious and creamy and indisputably better than Bi-Rite's, and that it was NOT Macapuno chocolate-dipped, as the only one to order Macapuno chocolate-dipped was my short friend Adelina, making her one more in a long line of women shorter than I am who despite this obvious handicap manage to out-order me at Mitchell's, for the simple reason that they ordered Macapuno chocolate-dipped while I, once again, ordered something wan and fruity and easily trounced by the chocolate dip on the outside, thereby irretrievably mitigating my enjoyment of the actual ice cream. I desperately coveted her cone for twenty consecutive seconds before turning to other matters. My life is a series of mistakes from which I continually relearn valuable lessons.\n\n\n\n*Ed. Note: It makes this reviewer just desperately unhappy that this is the number attributed to that which it describes, so unhappy that despite his near belligerent love of this town he will probably eventually, sadly, leave.\n\n**Ed. Note: Sorry to keep interrupting, but it bears noting, and this reviewer would be loathe I'm sure to mention such a thing, that he did in fact email to various friends last winter a picture of that chalked square of almost certainly Mission sidewalk that read, Dear Snowed in [sic] friends, If it is any consolation, the park is *too* crowded and we are running out of ice cream. Love, San Francisco XOX. That is, this reviewer has few compunctions about reaping the benefits of living near hipsterism when it suits his needs.\n\n***They stayed open late that night, I think, due to unprecedented demand. And this says something, I think actually, that a food service business would stay open really late on a random weeknight, just because there are people waiting to eat their ice cream.

I remember it clearly, because it was the first place I'd ever been to that served exotic and tropical ice cream. Flavors such as Ube and Mango that I loved as a child. Since I haven't been there in over 17+ years, I decided to go back to rekindle my childhood memories.\n     What a mission trying to find this place, but that wasn't gonna stop us from eating some good ice cream. Once we found it, I noticed the line out the door. It was also semi-hard to find parking. Two immediate signs that it was gonna be a good place!\n     They had a numbering system there. So I grabbed our ticket and looked at the many flavors of Ice Cream they had. When it was our turn, I decided on three scoops. I chose Avocado, Mango and Ube (for those of you who don't know, Ube is a purple yam which is usually found in the Philippines.). I debated back and forth whether to just get three plain scoops or in a banana split. I decided to get the three scoops so I could savor the flavor rather than drowning it all.\n     The Avocado was good. It had a taste which was unusual. I really can't explain it? It wasn't really sweet, had close to a guacamole taste, but then not really. The Mango was good also. I expected some fruit in it, but there wasn't any. I've had better Mango Ice Cream. The Ube was FANTASTIC! I've bought the store brand ones from the Asian Markets before, but they don't come close to the flavor of the one at Mitchell's. Definitely the best Ube Ice Cream I've ever had!\n     My cousin, Smelly Mary got a scoop of Macapuno and I tasted it. It was pretty good. The ice cream was sweet with pieces of coconut. She pointed out to me these Ube flavored Wafer Sticks that they sold in a prepacked tub. I had to buy them. They were fantastic.\n     My overall experience at Mitchell's was great. I will most definitely be back there. If I didn't live so far from there, I would've bought some 1/2 gallon prepacked ice creams to go. Oh well, until next time...", "author": "Che G."}

After dropping my buddy off from a Giants game, I happened to drive by the subtle store.  It was more the line of people out the door that caught my attention, than the place itself.  When I realized what I was seeing, I decided to experience this place I had heard so much about for myself.  After parking my car and inspecting the place a little more, I was surprised by its small size.  There's not a lot of places for customers to sit except for two benches outside the main door.  But I was there for ice cream, not a social event.  I made my way to the front of the line with ease as there were three windows quickly helping customers.   I ordered what most would consider a staple of any ice cream parlor, the traditional sundae.  Vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, and whipped cream with a cherry on top.  I opted for a waffle cone bowl because I was craving something crunchy as well as sweet.   I was impressed by the wide varieties of ice cream to choose from, including the traditional flavors and concoctions.  Next time I'll try something a little more adventurous.\nI decided to get the \"two scoop\" sundae because I was pretty hungry.\nI didn't see the scoop the pleasant server was using, but it must have been pretty large!!   When he handed me the dish it looked more like a 4 scoop sundae... and ultimately my stomach agreed.\nEvery ingredient was delicious!   And I was pleased with the amount of each.  Some places skimp on the hot fudge, but apparently not Mitchell's!  I couldn't even finish it all, which I know, to chocolate lovers, is a mortal sin!\nIn the end, I was very satisfied with my sundae.  I also enjoyed the service, the intimate atmosphere despite the lack of seating.\nI also enjoyed the other customers.  Everyone was polite and very excited to be eating ice cream!

It's soooo good!! I love how it has pieces of real coconut in it. Both times we went later in the evening so there wasn't much of a line, in fact there were more people in the express line buying half gallons instead of folks getting scoops. I wish there was a Mitchell's in Southern California, but it's probably for the best... I'd be even more overweight. Can't wait to go back!", "author": "S. D."}

However, I just had the worst ice cream experience of my life. The place was packed with kids eating their cones in front of the glass cases, so no chance of peeking at the vats. No big whoop, kids like ice cream and have no etiquette, however a good manager would have asked those with creams to step away from the counter, so those ordering could eyeball the tubs.  The experience was 1 star worthy when our stoned scooper gave me a junior scoop that was barely a quarter inch above the cone. Worse than a thrifty ice cream cone. I was so shocked, I took the skimpy \"scoop\" and paid without thinking. 2 ridiculously tiny scoops were over $5. Took 5 bite/licks to complete. I was apppalled at the service and scoop; so much so I was frozen with inaction. If i was ever served such a tiny treat for so much money again, I would walk away. Mitchell's days are over in my weighty ice-cream book. Not only was it overpriced and outrageously tiny, but the flavor was generically, cloyingly sweet and  and they hire loser stoners to scoop.  I prefer to spend a little more at Bi-Rite and get a giant cone heaping full of flavorful magic.  Fuck you Mitchells.", "author": "T L."}

In addition, to great ice cream I have always gotten great customer service for the past 25 years.  Their quality has always been consistent and i cant wait to have kids so I can take them here for their first scoop.

Mariannes in Santa Cruz).  \n\nAnd just to show that I am a honest reviewer... Here are flavors that I feel that Mitchells needs to improve upon... \n- Chocolate Chip (always amazes me how this is the only flavor I dislike since their Mint Chip is one of the best in the country and their vanilla ice creams are off the hook.  Its a head scratcher.)\n- Peach(in season)  Hit or miss sometimes... Im going to chalk this one up to how good the peaches are in a particular season\n- Pumpkin(in season) I always look forward to it...and I am always disappointed - too much pumpkin spice or something - kinda tastes like a safeway pumpkin pie\n- Tropical 4 (Just looking at the ingredient list makes my mouth water but every time it just ends up tasting only like Mango (which mind you is a great) but not when your expecting 3 other flavors with it - I never taste the banana or the pineapple \n\nI hope this helps someone make a very wise decision.  \n\nAnd remember, always tip the staff.

Great variety of selection on flavors. I tired out their Kahl\u00faa Mocha Cream and the flavor was wonderful. It wasnt too sweet, smooth texture unlike Polly Ann's, and the price was cheap for the size compare to Ben and Jerry's. The only catch about this place was you'll need to grab a ticket and wait in line. Oh yea, the place is pretty small so get ready to hang around outside of the store. Definitly a must go place if its your first time.", "author": "Derrick L."}

I have been a fan of the Macapuno, Rum Raisin (you get drunk off eating the rum soaked raisins... YUMMMY... forget jello shots... it is all about the raisin shot with this little number. And of course, you can get all sorts of ice cream creations like sundae's, banana splits, shakes, cakes, and even quarts to go. All this fanatical talk is coming from someone that actually doesn't even care much for ice cream.... no other ice cream had ever been worthy of my desire... So, if you have not made it out to Mitchell's yet (I actually know a SF native that has yet to do so... shame on him!) it is truly worth the wait.

That's why my love for their Mexican Chocolate cannot be displaced by my affections for yuppie upstarts like Bi-Rite Salted Caramel.

It don't matter if I had a bad minute, hour, day, week, or year, Mexican Chocolate always makes it right.

When you are accustomed to highs in the 40s, such a day in San Francisco is a mere rarity.  Yet there is a place where people flock to devour their favorite sub-zero treat.  You'll find this oasis of flavor on 29th and San Jose at a place called Mitchell's.\n\n  Serving locals and customers from around the Bay Area since 1953, Mitchell's has won the hearts of ice cream connoisseurs young and old along with recognition from a number of publications.  Mitchell's tantalizing flavors have been featured in Travel Magazine, The Food Network, San Francisco Weekly and the San Francisco Bay Guardian. \n  \n\"It's the best.  People from all over come here for it's old neighborhood feel.  There's lots of places in the city and lot's of change, and this is one of the few icons left in the city,\" said Cristian Flores, at Mitchell's for an after-work snack. \"Plus the parking is a plus, plus!\"\n Whether its during its peak hours of the day, in the late afternoon when school gets out, or on a Saturday night as families go out for a late night treat, or a pit stop for a couple after a date, Mitchell's packs the people in as well as the ice cream. \n  \n\"I've been coming here for over 20 years and I've been bringing him here since he was 3,\" said city resident Wendy Storch as she huddled out on the front bench with her son Nigel, 9.\n  \n\"We come here when it's hot or cold,\" said Nigel when asked if he and his mom had a tradition when coming to Mitchell's.\n  \nNot only through its consistency with its service, hours, and a pleasant experience, Mitchell's has maintained its success in becoming as dynamic as the neighborhood it is located in. It features traditional flavors such as vanilla and chocolate, but its array of exotic flavors such as buko, ube, mango, and avocado have kept the loyal and faithful of all backgrounds coming back for more.\n \n \"We've served special flavors since the sixties,\" explains current manager Linda Mitchell, daughter of founder and owner Larry Mitchell. \"A Filipino fruit importer sampled our ice cream and talked with my dad about using imported mango to create a new flavor.  He took a chance, and with a changing neighborhood, we found ourselves with a positive turnout.\"", "author": "Andr\u00e9s R."}

But the real killer is buko (coconut).  It is to die for.  Try in a cup, a scoop of buko, chocolate dipped, with roasted almonds on it.

Wow, it has been remodeled and they have a number system now as lines form out the door; my how it has grown.!  The service is friendly and I love how they let you sample flavors and really take the time with you to make sure you get what you want.  All the ice cream is homemade and smooth, buttery, nutty, (covering all the different flavors) like it should be.  They have all the expected like the ones mentioned and exhotic ones like purple yam, coconut, and so forth.  We sampled caramel crackle with smooth caramel and wonderful rice crispy like pieces, grasshopper pie which is essentially mint chocolate chip ice cream with Oreo Cookie bits, and black walnut which was nutty and tasted like rum a bit.  We chose Mexican chocolate with its smooth chocolaty cinimany goodness; we each got two scoops plus a half a gallon.  Uuuuhhhhmmm.!  I love how they have half gallons as I will pick one up next time I am in the area.  They are a little more than the chains and perhaps some other indipendents, but it is well worth it, getting what you pay for.  Be for warned, you may have to circle around multiple times to find parking as spots fill up fast needless to say, and their parking lot only accommodates eight vehicles, but it is so worth it.  So, for top quality homemade ice cream for a  little more than other palaces, with friendly service in a clean atmosphere, Mitchell's cannot be beat..

The pacific rim flavors just rule too like Ube-which is made from a root from the south pacific and mainly the Philipines is one of my personal faves. Then there's N.Y. Cherry, when you dip this sucker into the hot pool of chocolate coating, it tastes just like a see's candy that was bit into by your sister and avoided because she wanted a bordeaux instead.

The ice cream was so good that I dreamt about it.", "author": "Lindsay K."}

For example, their macapuno (young coconut) ice cream kicks any other coconut wannabe ice cream's ass ten times over, but that's because most people associate coconut-flavored foods to be creamy.  That being said, their Thai Ice Tea favor, chocolate and vanilla are not bad.  What wasn't so good was their green tea (green tea should NOT be too creamy, in my opinion), grasshopper (mint ice cream that was just looked too suspiciously bright green, with soggy oreos and an overly goopy fudge ribbon), ube (but that's because I'm fond of the slight pastiness of ube... shut up you Filipino food haters!)
