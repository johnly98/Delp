The reason why im giving this a 3 stars is i wish the pizza wasn't that oily and the sauce was a bit watery. Overall the dough on the pizza was crunchy.

Even SF doesn't exactly have good pizza.\n\nFor good or bad, there are a lot of pizza places in Glen Park/Excelsior/Cayuga Terrace/Sunnyside. Some should definitely be avoided, some only really work in a pinch, and then you have Roma.\n\nMy first experience with them was when my friend ordered us after some day drinking a medium cheese and butter bread. It was so good - thick cheese, sweet sauce, and solid crust. The biggest problem is you want to devour the pizza, but as the cheese is so thick you really do need to chew. The drunk hunger dilemma!\n\nHowever you can only get the cheese. I got the Hawaiian, as it's my favorite type of pizza, and it wasn't as good.

Parking can be difficult with street parking in the neighborhood with some narrow streets. Mission street is very busy with traffic. I came here in the weekday early afternoon and I was the only person there but there were phone calls coming in with orders. I saw one delivery guy coming in and picking up pizzas.\n\nWhen you come here for food, be sure to ask for the take out menu because on the back has coupons. And we all love coupons!! Yah!! :-) This is a nice small neighborhood pizza place. \n\nI decided to order the Meat Lovers pizza that has sausage, pepperoni, salami and beef. I saw the pizza guy making it and put it in the oven. It is always fun seeing the pizza being made. It took about 15 minutes to make it and during that time I was watching other pizzas being made. There's a lot of pizza combinations I never heard of before that sounds interesting like the Bad Boy that has chicken, mushrooms, onion, beef, linguica, sausage, bacon and pepperoni or the Sunday Special with toppings like white sauce, Tuna, shrimp, clams, garlic and green olives.\n\nI like how the crust is light and not too heavy with dough. The pizza had very light layer of tomato sauce which was fine with me that seemed non existent to me when I was eating it. I am not a fan of tomatoes so this was  a plus for me. I enjoyed the crust, not hard or too chewy and was just right. The ingredients I thought were good portion size to the medium pizza. The pizza was flavorable with the toppings. The cashier was nice and thanked me for coming here.\n\nIf I happen to get lost in this neighborhood again or feel like an adventure, I would come back and be brave to try the Bad Boy combination pizza. \n\nEvery now and again, don't we need either a bad boy or bad girl in our life to spice things up a bit? ;-) I am just joking. Sorry I forgot to check in, but I was here though. :-)", "author": "Priscilla L."}

Providence has some of the best pizza. You can blindly pick a random pizza joint and know that you're going to get something better than most places in the Bay Area. Yes SF has its niche market for pizza, but I'm talking classic pizza, $12 a pie,...hold the kale. \n\nRoma doesn't do the typical rush pizza where the cheese is barely melted. If anything they slightly overcook, which I prefer over undercooked. The pepperoni is curled up and crisp like bacon.\n\nSLA/ESD: I've never had them take too long and typically they arrive in less than an hour (i'm near CCSF Phelan)\n\nThe NY Steak comes green peppers and onions with a side dish of spaghetti and meat marinara which is awesome (unless you choose rice. not sure if there's any sauce if you choose rice). Also comes with a small salad with dressing of your choice and a small piece of bread. \n\nThe Chicken Parm Sandwich could use slightly more marinara but overall, a great sandwich.

The taste is delicious,  but it was very upsetting to wait so long and get a cold meal. \n\nI had a very long work week, and have suffered a sprained ankle just a few days ago, so the last thing I wanted to do was turn on the oven and wait even more to eat. Plus,  the point of ordering delivery is so you don't have to do anything for your meal. I'm very disappointed,  especially since it looks like it could be delicious. \n\nI would POSSIBLY consider eating in the restaurant,  but I don't believe I'll ever be ordering delivery from here again.", "author": "Alicia F."}

First of all it took me almost 2 hours to get my pizza when grub hub said it should only take about an hour.

It was someone else's pizza. When I called before I got my pizza to ask where was all the woman said was that it would be here in a few minutes. But it was really like another 15.

Seriously Roma -- your restaurant looks like a Dairy Queen on the wrong side of the tracks in a bad suburb.\n\nI guess it's a good thing I've never set foot in here. Boyfriend and I have ordered delivery here for more than a year. It's about 4 miles away from our apartment -- a decent trek in San Francisco! -- but they still arrive in under an hour. \n\nAnd we love the food. Roma's chicken avocado sandwiches are so big, with lots of chicken, melted cheese, and, of course, avocado. Jalapeno poppers taste like they came from a Safeway freezer, but they get the job done. We always get 2 meatballs for $1 simply because they're on the menu.\n\nI recommend getting delivery here when you're feeling gluttonous. While Roma food is tasty, it never digests that well. I try to limit myself to ordering once monthly because of this.

I'm not as thrown off by it's questionable exterior because, let's face it, SF-ers have seen worse. Let me start off first by telling you about their pizza, then I'd like to close out by telling you what happened to me last time I was here. It's just an example of what to expect in the Mission-Geneva on a Friday night.\n\nPizza: Crust is thick and soft, they really pile on the toppings (especially cheese), and their sauce tastes fresh made and not from a can. I always get the Roma Special because it has everything.  Their garlic cheesy breadsticks are BOMB and freshly baked. Their vegetables (bell pepper, mushrooms are not overcooked, which is a common mistake pizza places make. I had their hot wings once and I thought those were \"meh\" - I didn't like the sauce. So if you stick to pizza and breadsticks, you'll walk out with a happy tummy.\n\nOh yeah, and they also sell salads. But going to a pizzeria for salad is like going to a prostitute for a hug. So...yeah....\n\nSo last time I was here, my then-fiancee had to chase out a beligerent drunk guy who had wandered in to ramble on about Tiger Woods being a pimp. He got chased out and ran into a wall. Then the cops came and took him away for public intoxication. I realize that none of this is really relevant to the pizza itself, but if you're not from here, or if you're easily startled, then maybe you should avoid coming here at night.

I had a pizza delivered from there just last night in fact.\n\nTo start off, it took a long time for me to just get my order out because the guy couldn't speak english fluently.  So then he put another guy on the phone to better assist me.  After I took the pizza into my house I opened up the box and saw that they got my order wrong.  This was after the delivery boy left of course.  I figured that it was too much trouble to call Roma's again to fix my order so I just decided to deal with it. \n\nI picked up a slice and it fell apart.  The cheese fell off of the dough, leaving me with a cheese-less and topping-less, pile of goop.  This always happens with Roma pizza so I wasn't surprised.

The pizza is very appetizing and the ingredients are very fresh.  \n\nOne thing that I did notice was that although when I ate there, it was very good, when I had it for delivery just last week...there was a noticeable difference in the quality of the pizza.  \n\nI know, I know that having pizza delivered is great and convenient but this place just might be worth the trip out if you're in the area to have the pizza.  Overall, I'd say that the prices are about right for a pizza place....usually my friends and I order an XL and it comes out to about $30 roughly along with a pitcher of beer that brings the total to about $40 which isn't bad. \n\nGood pizza...not the best but definitely tasty.", "author": "David B."}

We ordered a large pizza with Sausage, Mushrooms, and Bacon. It was absolutely fantastic. the bacon was cooked to perfection, not overcooked and burnt, or undercooked and fatty. it came hot and melty and delicious. \nRoma seems to be getting bad reviews on here, but those reviews are not at all what i experienced. I will definitely go back to Roma, and if you are in the City late at night, Roma is open till 2AM, so i highly recommend you do to!", "author": "Olong J."}

On the thin side with a very high cheese to sauce ratio and very generous with the cheese.  Crust is a bit soggy but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's a restaurant with wine and beer.

City boy suggests Roma's so we hit 'em up and say hey how much is a 2 topping medium pizza? $18!!!! WHAT?!! HELL NO! So we say how much is a Large and can you throw in something else??? $21.75 for a large and 3 sodas :| Now why the hell is a medium and 2 sodas $18?!?!?!? Yeah WTF guys, not impressed with your prices but your pizza is pretty damn good, especially the cheese. Maybe I'll hit ya'll again for a large but definitely NOT a medium.", "author": "Nancy R."}

When it comes to pizza, I'd take Bravo's any day, but unfortunately they're a cash only joint. When it's rainy and I have zero cash, Roma accepts credit cards and so they get my business. I have yet to try their other foods, but they have everything from fish and chips to salads to sandwiches, so I'm happy to see that you can get some healthier alternatives delivered as well.", "author": "Sierra S."}

The Spanish-style green sauce pizza is not very good (runny and just not very flavorful), and the regular pies just aren't what they used to be. They do serve breakfast here now, but I haven't tried it (the breakfast menu looked pretty basic).", "author": "Brian H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-22", "description": "If you aren't too picky about your pizza and opt out of Little Joe's and Bravo's, Roma is probably the last place to order from in area.  I've ordered pizza here for a long time and I would have to rate the pizza as just standard.  If you crave for it  and don't expect anything special in your pies, Roma is the place to order from.  We usually get an XL pepperoni which can feed about 5 people easy.  It will cost you about $25 with free sodas.  The wait is 45 to an hour.  The last time I ordered here the delivery guy got lost and I got my pie soggy and lukewarm.  On top of that, the guy on the phone said everything would cost $26.50 but I was charged $31.80 on my credit card?!??!!  I will have to second guess this place the next time.  Maybe I will just opt for Little Ceasar's that just opened around the corner.", "author": "Chris S."}

I remember ordering a pizza for pickup. I got there in 20 minutes and they said it wasn't ready because they dropped my pizza and they showed me the one they dropped. OK... 10 minutes later, they take it out and they ALMOST drop it again! I come home and the pizza wasn't that great. The last straw was when I ordered delivery. The first time, it took 1 1/2 hours for the pizza to come. The second and very last time I ordered from them, it took 2 FU*KIN HOURS.  BULLSH*T!", "author": "Conrad C."}

I was kinda annoyed that they actually charge you as a topping for any sauce other than tomato, (interesting how the menu doesn't say that) Our pizza was poorly put together with the sauce on the bottom and cheese then then pieces of grilled chicken with no flavor sparsely floating on the top. If you ask me it should have went; cheese, BBQ chicken and drizzled with BBQ sauce. The sandwich was pretty decent and much more worth while than the pizza. Over all this place does the trick for a late night snack but not if you want some super good pizza.", "author": "Lani R."}

The head pizza guy in charge didn't want to indulge us by slapping out a freshly made pie---we wouldn't have minded the wait--he just wanted to lazily re-heat some stale looking slices. And with us being just a bunch of equally lazy dudes looking to scarf down some carbs before liquid carbing ourselves, we went ahead with that idea thinking it couldn't have been THAT bad. Some choice words to describe THIS particular pizza: cardboard, coagulated cheese (even AFTER being nearly over-re-heated--yikes), sauce-less, shriveled up toppings, almost nothing redeeming. and YES, it was decidely worse than Domino's, the standard for low-end pizza. Probably the 2nd worst pizza behind Zorba's in San Mateo, and you can read my scathing review of that place, too.", "author": "Chris C."}
