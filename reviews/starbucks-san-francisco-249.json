If there is space, I will flip open the laptop and spend an hour catching up on urgent emails and get info from online that I need for the afternoon meetings.\n\nTHE SETUP\n\nThis building in on a hill, and since it is recessed a bit into the hills, the back door accessed on Bush Street is actually at a higher elevation than the front door on Van Ness.  The result is that the main store level - the cashiers, the product-placements, the coffee condiment area, etc. - is at the higher elevation.\n\nDISABLED ACCESS\n\nSo what is really cool & admirable about the configuration of this store is that it makes disabled-access extremely convenient from the Van Ness door because of a wheelchair elevator-lift.  \n\nHOLIDAY BLONDE\n\nI love that they have the holiday brews out and my favorite is the holiday blonde.  I even enjoy this better than the regular Blonde Veranda.  \n\nMUNCHIES\n\nThe Greek Yogurt with honey & granola is definitely a delicious light option.  But I find myself going more for the Hot Panini Turkey Rustico sandwich which is absolutely scrumptious, even more so when heated.\n\nSTAFF\n\nI absolutely love the staff at this store.

They are either big or small, crowded or empty. The drinks are about the same. What really makes each Starbucks different is its location, baristas, and the volume. The volume here does not get too loud most of the time. It is really easy to work here and not get disturbed. The Starbucks open up until 9:30 which is pretty great. The music here is good, it's never too loud or too light. It is the perfect place to just have a conversation with your friends, have a coffee date, and work. The baristas here are really nice and friendly. They are willing to take the time to get your order right. They will ask you for information such as whether you want it sweetened or not  (not every barista does this). Overall, this is a place to come to for a coffee date or just to work.

With big windows that wrap around the shop, you get to see just about everything along with your java.\n\nI've seen bad auto accidents on Van Ness as well as weirdos walking down the street. One time I saw Obama's police escort scream down Bush Street. In 2006 there was a bomb scare in the bathroom. The news made it all the way to CNN. Turned out that it was just an old Flashlight.\n\nIf your caffeine fix isn't enough to start you up, go to the Starbucks at this location and eventually, you will be entertained by some kind of event.\n\nThe drawback of this place is that it very cramped and if you are on your laptop, don't expect much privacy.\n\nOtherwise, it can be entertaining and the staff they tend to hire there are cool.", "author": "Randy F."}

Maybe it was just the fact that I was able to stand in their air conditioning for 5 minutes and dry the sweat dripping off my face.  \nThe two gay guys working behind the counter seemed VERY happy to be making fru-fru coffee drinks.  In fact, the light frappacino I got was probably the creamiest light frapaccino I've ever had, down to the last sip.  The other guy was even giving me tips to heat up the sandwich I bought, but not for too long; it would be delicious! Happy gay guys always seem to make my day a little brighter (hey, its not called gay for nothing).  \nProbably minus 1 star for the tranny hooker sitting in the corner talking to him/herself.  But I really can't hold that against Starbucks.", "author": "Gracie M."}

Choose this spot over the other 10000000 starbucks in san francisco and you'll walk out satisfied. I'll go out of my way to stop by the store for the 5-star staff - who put a smile on my face more than any starbucks beverage ever could.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-06-15", "description": "A very small coffee shop. You can't  stretch. Crowded, stuffy! The A/C was out of service when I was there. The Workers talk b.s. among themselves aloud in front of customers ( just students working part-time that don't give a darn I guess). The staff tends to be unprofessional and sarcastic. You ask for a beverage and you don't get what you want. My suggestion, go down the block on California Street were that place is much better.", "author": "Smooth R."}

I live really close to this location, however end up walking the couple blocks to California/van Ness, or, when that one is closed, vallejo and polk st because the Bux at 1401 Van Ness is awful. I order a carmel macciato and the barista's put the shots in first....so basically its a vanilla latte because in macciato's the shots go on top. It is really frustrating. Also, they charge you for sweetner in an americano when you could always go and put it in yourself at the condiment bar.  It's ridiculous. I hate this location and avoid it at all costs!", "author": "Sarah I."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-05-25", "description": "This is the WORST Starbucks EVER!!!! The employees here are just rude, they seem overly annoyed that they are working there, and when you order a drink they treat you like you are personally responsible. The service is slow, and I'd say, skip it and go to another one.", "author": "Robby G."}
