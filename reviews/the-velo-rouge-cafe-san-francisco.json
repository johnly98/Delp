I came here with a friend after a night out, and boy were we relieved by the generous portions and tasty food. \n\nAtmosphere - it has a really European vibe with a cute feel. We saw many people studying and eating, with the occasional person coming in for some takeout coffee. The staff is really nice, and the food arrived pretty quickly. \n\nFood - my friend got the breakfast sandwich on a croissant, which he said was delicious. I got the breakfast burrito, which was humongous for its price and delicious. It had everything in it, from eggs to cheese to avocado and a side of chips as well. The burrito is really filling, and I could only eat one half before I was full. It creates a great second meal as well. \n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend this little cafe.

I think my plate had one strawberry, one melon and maybe a grape?  \n\n- Hubs ordered a coffee to combat the cool SF morning and was surprised to find that there were no refills.

The last time I went, I ordered an open-faced sandwich.

It defeats the purpose for me because the bread ends up getting soggy under the middle part. But I digress.\n\nFor my order, I requested that they \"close\" the sandwich because I didn't want the bread to get soggy. The cashier said she couldn't do this, and offered another sandwich with mostly meat ingredients (I'm veggie) that was \"closed.\" My bf and I had a good laugh at this whole exchange. However, I took the risk and ordered the open-faced sando without mushrooms and bacon.\n\nAnyway, I got the sando and it came with mushrooms, the bane of my vegetarian existence (seriously, I don't get how anyone can like them).

As soon as you walk in, it's the ultimate SF vibe with a funky couch made of bike seats, and lots of families and couples. \n\nI ordered a veggie sandwich and Fort Point IPA. Veggie sandwich ($11) was underwhelming and soggy. I think it must have been microwaved. I enjoyed the Fort Point ($4), especially after walking what seemed like eternity. It tasted fresh and light. \n\nYou might have to wait around for seats, and it's a bit crowded. The staff was very nice and friendly.

They even provide books and board games. There's a lot of funky furniture and it's a little dimly lit. Nice place to read a book, hang out, or catch up with someone.\n\nService: Superb. While my take on the coffee and food were a little above average, the combination of the ambiance and the great service is honestly what keeps me coming back. The baristas and cashiers are always nice. Even the cooks are nice. They're all just cool, sometimes they make small talk but it's never awkward.

I ordered the breakfast burrito (nothing amazing) and went to sit on one of the tables outside as there were none available inside. After I got my food, a man came outside and said 'did you order a coffee?' I said yes, as I had. And he then said 'great, it's inside'. I was expecting him to then bring it out to me, as the only other option would be to leave my food unattended on the street and come in and get it myself. After about 15 minutes the waitress brought my (now cold) coffee out to me, slammed it down on the table and was overall just kind of passive aggressive about it.

This place is a little different in that it's counter service, so you don't have to wait for a table... but you do have to wait a while for your food. There aren't a lot of tables inside, but you can grab your food to go and take it to the park. \n\nWe ordered the breakfast burrito with chicken apple sausage (and black beans, potatoes, eggs, avocado, and sour cream) served with chips and salsa. The burrito was large, definitely filling, and pretty delicious. That being said, I thought having to add $2.50 for meat was a bit of a high price for an add on. We split the Jack Johnson banana pancakes which had chunks of banana and almond cooked in. They were good, but could have been a little more banana-y. \n\nOverall the food was pretty good, and reasonably priced (for SF). We probably waited around a half hour for it, so I'm not sure it cut down significantly on the brunch wait.

Who else would be caught mingling in this crowded, bustling cafe on a Sunday morning?  Unfortunately, it's one of the FEW cafes located right off of Fulton and Arguello (flower conservatory/de Young Museum/Sharon Meadow area of Golden Gate Park).  Fortunately, it IS one of the few located HERE!  I'm so thankful for it because--you see--before Sunday exercise rounds or a day at GGP, some people need their coffee.  Coffee coffee coffee.  I'm not big on coffee but I can tell that they have several choices.  They carry blue bottle coffee, and each cup is freshly brewed after ordering.  Can't ignore that small cabinet of pastries.  From what I saw, coffee is the main commodity here.  \n\nAs for the breakfast, I ordered Mt. Vernoux (egg, bacon, cheese inside a croissant) and felt as though maybe I could've made this at home.  Kind of pricey for that shebang.  Took quite some time for the food to come out.  Crowds build fast on a Sunday morning.  There is an optimal-but-not-overwhelming list of quick and easy to eat breakfast items like croissants, lox, breakfast burritos but the Yelp pictures really help me choose.  Hey, chips come with the breakfast burrito!  And the crust is grilled quite like a panini which makes it special.\n\nWhat sets this place apart from other breakfast joints is being able to eat your breakfast with your hands!

Clerks could also be a bit friendlier.\n\nUpdate: Unfortunately, I'm here to update my review and lower it to 2 stars, which I feel is actually generous. I recently got one of their vegetarian sandwiches and I have to say, it was terrible. \n\nIt may not be easy to make a great sandwich. But It's also probably not easy to make a sandwich this bad. And it certainly wasn't worth 10 bucks. To start, the bread tasted dry and stale.\n\nThe sandwich was meant to have hummus on it. However, there was no hummus. The big problem what that is that there are no other condiments in the sandwich. So, when you forget to add the hummus, or just don't care enough to put it in, the sandwich is basically a dry, unenjoyable mess that falls apart, since there's nothing to moisten it or hold it together.\n\nNext, the cheese. I didn't need cheese on a vegetable sandwich. But it came with it. So, what the heck, why not. The problem, however, is that there was literally a HALF INCH of cheese in this thing. To put that in perspective, that easily a 1/4 inch too much cheese to put in a grilled cheese sandwich. It's WAY too much cheese. The sandwich, which was fairly large, was basically 1/4 cheese. Imagine eating a 1/4 inch of cheddar cheese between two pieces of stale bread.\n\nSo, here I am trying to get the healthier sandwich option on the menu. But what I get is a really dry, stale sandwich with no condiments or hummus whatsoever, and which is filled with a seemingly random handful of dry vegetables. But on top of that, it has a whole brick of cheese in the middle! It was so bad. \n\nI should have returned the food and complained. But I honestly just wanted to forget about it as soon as possible. So, I just ate the side salad that it came with and sadly put the rest of the sandwich in the compost.\n\nI feel like these people owe me a meal.", "author": "Grey Z."}

I'm a foodie, but a bike enthusiasts, so I was ready to flip a 180 and search up a new place to chow down but actually saw that people were eating and being served food.

The scramble sandwich was PACKED with grilled onions, TONS of mushrooms, a GARDEN of spinach, and smokey BACON everywhere. The muffins were exceptionally nice too, with the tops crispy, and the insides warm and chewy, just like how I like em'. Hands down, one of the best and hearty $7 eats I've had in a LONG time. \n\nMT.

It's a small eat, but very portable and packed with your breakfast essentials. Don't forget to add the avocado! \n\nWhat makes VRC 5-stars is not because of the bomb breakfast nor how affordable the food can be, but it's the customer service.\n\nI came here today (8/16) and I had to write this review because of their outstanding service! \n\nPutting all the bicycle photos and wacky bike-inspired furniture and bike references, you have a small coffee shop with a few outdoor seating spots. Intentionally, my girlfriend and I wanted to dine-in since it would be more convenient but all of the tables and chairs were taken, so instead, we just got our order to go. (Why not take a walk into Golden Gate Park and have a little picnic, right?)\n\nThe staff acknowledged our request and changed our dine-in order to a to-go. Another one of the staff members rushed outside just to make sure there wasn't any open spaces or tables that needed to be bussed. Nope, still all full. No biggie.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, our to-go order came out and was brought to us, along with 2 additional plates and utensils.The staff member asked if we would still like to dine-in since a table actually opened but since we already had everything in to-go containers, we said it wasn't necessary and didn't want to waste their container. He insisted and said it was perfectly fine, with the biggest smile I've seen at 1PM. With a smile like that, we decided to dine in with out to-go order. \n\nOf course, the food was excellent, but as I was washing it all down with the coffee I ordered, it had a really strong sour pungent taste to it, despite adding my usual dosage of sugar. Maybe it was just me but I asked one of the staff members if it was normal. With any no hesitation whatsoever, he said he would make me a new beverage immediately and noted that VRC's coffee is just like that and quite strong since it's Blue Bottle coffee and individually dripped (I'm a Blue Bottle virgin, I admit it).

I felt like they were trying to run me off.  Maybe they don't like money.\n\nFunny thing is, there isn't a single law in the entire country requiring footwear for patrons.  Certainly, they can put up a sign \"No shoes, no service,\" if they like.  But why bother patrons about shoes when in fact there is no requirement that they do so?

We came here yesterday and were excited to give it a try and the cafe was packed and buzzing. \n\nWe had the BALT (bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato) sammie, Peasant Pie w/feta and spinach, Granola, Bagel with cream cheese. With the exception of the BALT, we found that our picks were mediocre and poorly prepared. \n\nFirst off, biggest complaint: FROZEN food. You can tell when veggies/fruit was previously frozen and defrosted. Maybe not in say a spinach Peasant Pie but, seriously I'll notice if my cucumber slices and strawberries are translucent, water logged and soggy. It STUNS me to think that Velo Rouge would serve previously frozen strawberries in a granola bowl and soggy cucumbers in my side salad. Instant no-no and careless. \n\nSecond off, the Peasant Pie? Sounded interesting and tasted interestingly bad. The filling at potential but, the dough ruined it for us. It was chewy and tasted stale and not the right pastry for a Peasant Pie. \n\nThird off and final straw was the bagel. Nobody even bother to spread the cream cheese. It was literally cut off the block they have and sandwiched in between the bagel. They didn't even think to give us a butter knife to spread it ourselves when our order came. \n\nHonestly, I am disappointed in this restaurant and largely because of the lack of attention to detail and bad quality ingredients they serve their customers.

There were two mistakes: a misunderstanding about something ordered, and they forgot to make my friend's breakfast, so he had to wait extra long.  No problem, mistakes happen. It's how they dealt with it that was so disappointing.\n\nWhen my friend first asked the about the mistaken order, the lady that brought it out was really flippant, suggesting she was really too busy bringing out food and couldn't deal with us.  We asked what could be done and she said he should go find her manager. She left in a rush and didn't come back. She happened to walk by again a few minutes later and my friend asked if she had asked her manager to stop by - she said no. (??) She gave more attitude but finally talked to her manager.\n\nThe manager stopped by and my friend explained the situation and left out how unnecessarily rude the lady was.  This didn't seem right, so I mentioned her surprising attitude to the manager.  He blew me off by saying how they were correcting the order.

If you're vegetarian you'll love it, if you're not, you'll still love it. If you need some meat in your burrito throw some bacon, ham, or sausage in there. The chips and salsa it came with were absolutely great, just wish they gave more salsa. But it was good enough that my family ordered a side plate of just chips and salsa.

The free WiFi is nice, though they'll randomly shut it off if there are too many people hogging it.\n\nYou really have to get your timing right if you plan to hang out there and drink/eat, because it's small and can get super crowded.

Aim for early morning -- meaning before 9:30 am -- or between meal times. I've never gone in the evening, so I can't comment on their libations and clientele during that time.

They have an extensive menu for such a small place, and the menu runs the gamut from breakfast foods to snack-sized savory pies to pizzas (available at night). Generally I think the food is good and most of it is priced reasonably (large bowl of fresh-made soup and hunk of corn bread for under $5, for example). The staff has always been polite to me. The cafe and bathroom are clean. I love that they have happy hour, with wine/beer available for late afternoon study sessions. \n\nThe size can be frustrating. Many times, at lunch or even late afternoon, I've had to leave because it's full. Although they promote a \"share your space\" policy, not everyone is friendly and it's not uncommon to have folks take up a large table by themselves. The size also leads to another gripe- they turn the WiFi off a lot. They want to turn tables, I get it, but the WiFi seems to be off more than it's on (certainly 12-2, usually mid-afternoon to 4 as well. Lots of times on weekends.). This makes it tricky to use Velo as a reliable place to get work done (for the record I will usually work for about an hour and a half to two hours and spend about $20). \n\nFinally, although their beverages are good, they are, as others note, really tiny for the price. A chai latte runs about $4.50 and might be even a bit smaller than a \"tall\" at a chain shop. Honestly, the wine/beer specials seem to be a better deal :)", "author": "Jenni D."}

I've also had two soups of the day, and both have been very good.  Helps make me feel better when I'm feeling a little sickly.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place to the surrounding neighborhoods.  Such a cute place to come and dine and chat.", "author": "My An V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-09", "description": "Although I scanned the other reviews before selecting this caf\u00e9, I didn't understand how small it was. Like five tables small.  Very packed together five metal tables, so they aren't meant for comfort. So plan to get your items to-go if you are coming at peak hours, or be prepared to sit on hard chairs, or at one of the 3 bar stools.\n\nThe menu is very small and to the point. You go up and order your food at the counter, and then they bring it to you. I thought this was a regular sit down restaurant.  \n\nI had a Bagel and Lox with cream cheese which came with red onions and capers.  A very generous portion of lox and cream cheese. It was delicious.  I also ordered a sesame bagel toasted with jelly for my two year old.  She doesn't eat much and no surprise, she didn't eat much of her bagel. I took a bite of her bagel and it did have a strange after-taste, almost like it picked up some of an onion bagel that was previously toasted.  That's a no-go for a two year old, but really, it was fine for anyone else to eat. I also didn't get a coffee on this date, which it sounds like they are fantastic at.  $2.50 for a drip coffee seemed pretty high, but their food prices seemed very reasonable.  My bagel with lox and cream cheese, plus my daughter's bagel came in at $9.00. \n\n\nI think the lunch options actually looked yummier than the small breakfast menu.  I wouldn't veer out of my way to eat her again, but its proximity to Golden Gate park made it ideal for my daughter and I to grab a quick breakfast, and then walk over to the California Academy of Sciences.", "author": "Amanda M."}

I do like blue bottle, although I don't have the sizzling hot love affair with it that some people do.  GF had tea, and liked it although nothing special.  Chocolate croissant was good, although not that much chocolate.\n\nThe coffee bar had simple syrup, which is a BIG plus.  I pretty much exclusively drink iced coffee, so simply syrup is the best way to sweeten it.  Price was also impressive.  Premium iced coffee for like 2.50 I think.  Good deal.\n\nAtmosphere was nice.  Kinda trendy, but not over the top.  Not SUPER loud, but not so quiet it will put you to sleep in the morning.\n\nOverall, will definitely come back here again.

The rust colored walls are adorned with pictures of bicycles and they actually attract cyclists (must be that red bike rack in front of the caf\u00e9 and the proximity to Golden Gate Park).  \n\nAs a place to get work done, it's decent but there's only 1 working outlet and the caf\u00e9 is popular, so you're unlikely to get a table by the outlet.  The wi-fi (free, unsecure) connection wasn't stable either.  \n\nThey serve Blue Bottle Coffee, so you know that you're going to get a good cup of coffee.  I had the latte ($3.50) which was exceptionally smooth and bold and the foam even had a pretty leaf design.  \n\nUnfortunately, the latte was on the small side.  I need more caffeine in the morning to get me going.\n\nI also had the breakfast burrito ($6.95) with eggs, cheddar and whole black beans in a grilled tortilla.  The burrito is topped with avocado slices and accompanied by salsa and sour cream.  It was a nice breakfast, a cut above the usual coffee house fare.  I like how the grilled tortilla was a tad crispy.  The small cup of salsa certainly isn't enough for a breakfast burrito.\n\nBreakfast (sandwiches, bagels, pastries, eggs) is served till 2:30 PM.

I dont just stand outside looking in the window at night and then go home and write yelp reviews. I swear.\n\nUnfortunately, I had to give 3 stars because of the food. I've only had breakfast items and they were all disappointing. I made a rookie mistake of ordering a breakfast burrito the first time I went. A french themed cafe can't make a good breakfast burrito? Shocking. This morning I ordered the Mr. Ventoux, which is pretty much just a normal breakfast sandwich but for some reason costs $6. The eggs were WAY overcooked and the sandwich had zero flavor.

Inside is a charming little space with black metal tables and chairs, books and games for patrons to enjoy, a little glass cabinet with fresh baked goods and a menu quite more extensive than is shown on the MenuPages page that the Yelp link connects to.\n\nIt was freezing cold this morning, and not even the six block walk from the church to the cafe was enough to warm myself, but a freshly brewed hot cocoa with a frothy topping of sweet whipped cream was just what this non-coffee drinker needed to warm up.\n\nI love how the cafe staff allows their patrons to move around the furniture inside to form bigger group sitting areas as we were one of two fairly large groups enjoying the cafe this morning.\n\nFrom their brunch menu I ordered the French Toast.  My only regret was not having a camera to record this beautifully presented, delectable treat.  The French Toast is three slices of a thick, coarse bread (baked fresh by Tartine according to the cafe's menu description) that is battered and grilled in a egg-heavy coating on one side only.  Its final presentation is dusted with powdered sugar and fresh fruit slices of bananas and persimmons.  A cup of warmed syrup comes with it too.  The sugars from my brunch selection and my beverage were just what I needed to kick start the rest of my day.\n\nIt seemed like they have quite a large staff for a small cafe.

I feel bad doing this to you, but you (actually, your management) need some tough lovin'. Or some suggestions, to be exact.\n\nInner Richmond, surprisingly, does not have much in terms of coffee shops. They are far and few between, and walk more than 2 blocks away from Clement street, and you are in a caffeine-free, java-depleted zone. But then there's Velo Rouge, an oasis of a cafe in the hitherland of toddler-strallers, golden retrievers and your friendly unemployed wanna-be writers. \n\nIt's actually the last category that I have my beef with when it comes to Velo Rouge. The category also knowns as \"Free-wi-fi-loaders\" or \"table hoggers\". Here's the sitch. You come into Velo Rouge to have some of their excellent Blue Bottle coffee and one of their delicious breakfasts, but oh, ah, where do you intend to eat it? For all of their 4 tables are typically and firmly occupied, often by just one person and their laptop. \n\nI mean, I realize a free Wi-Fi is a nice perk and it probably helps fill the cafe up in less-popular hours, but on a weekend, at breakfast or brunch time, I think it's time to either get rid of the freeloaders who nurse their coffees or just bring in more tables. Perhaps, smaller size? Or turn off the Wi-Fi on Saturdays and Sundays?\n\nBut perhaps I am not being fair to Velo Rouge. Its owners and staff do seem to work hard and are generally nice people. I am sure they don't want to discourage their regulars, and the place IS tiny. It's just frustrating is all, when you literally have to fight over the next free table with a pregnant lady and her menacing-looking Boston terrier.", "author": "Evg R."}

DELICIOUS baked goods. Soup daily. Sandwiches in huge proportions. Everyone must try their pauper pies-- warm and hearty. I am confident in saying everything on the menu will be tasty, substantial but not heavy, and will come out of the kitchen quickly.\n\nAND they're not after your wallet!

Our order was originally to go because there was no seats in sight, but a table opened up midway, and the cashier changed our order with no complaints. The environment was comfortable, and definitely had a handful of regulars, who chatted it up with the folks behind the counter.

The dude who took my order was most certainly high. I asked him what was in the vegetarian sandwich on the menu (a daily special which said it was made with fresh/seasonal vegetables). Reallly slowly, he starts listing \"Uhh... cucumbers..? ... lettuce...\" I replied \"I'll have the banana pancakes\". \n\nThe banana pancakes weren't good, though. And the bananas came on top! Not cooked inside :(  And the chocolate croissant my friend ordered wasn't even heated up.

I then delved into Anna Karenina for the next hour and decided to grab a snack and another drink while waiting for the music. I got a slice of yummy banana bread for $1.75 (moist and plenty of walnuts) and a pint of Flat Tire for the special price of $3.

One went as far as to get me a lid for my coffee.  Awhhh.  I felt \"special\".  Didn't try any of the food but I was in need of a caffeine fix mid-day.  They make a better cup of Blue Bottle coffee than the BB coffee shop in the Ferry Building, if you ask me.  They decorate the foam which is wasted because it gets covered up by a lid unless you're dining in.  The latte was bold and hands down much better than coffee at Tully's but steep for $3.50.  The mocha is pricier at $3.95.  The mocha wasn't too sweet but sort of chalky tasting.  \nThey have a coffee card, buy 10 coffees get one free, but one stamp per person per visit.

I picked out a blackberry scone, which looked fresh and absolutely amazing, but to my chagrin, it had the texture of cardboard, so that was a let down. My coffee, on the other hand, was full-bodied and supremely flavorful, so I left feeling pleased. \n\nI'm planning on swinging by again when the place is less crowded, for I'd love to be able to actually sit down and savor a nice breakfast here.

It is a relatively small coffee shop, I don't think you can really get too much studying done here on the weekend (unless you sit along the side on the stools facing the window) because there are so many people here. It is also very kid friendly, so there's usually a stroller or car seat around you.  There's a few board games, books, and toys for kids to enjoy too.  I don't think you can bring your dog into the cafe but they do have a doggy bowl for water outside.  There's a couple tables outside if you wanna keep your doggy company.\n\nAs for the food, I love their sandwich plates and egg plates. (I'd stay away from the breakfast burrito...let's leave that to the Mission.)  Sandwiches come with a side of salad usually including strawberries and blue cheese!

It also has outdoor seating and the decor/vibe of the place is great, always a nice mix of families, cyclists, and indietastic twentysomethings in there. Also, connect four is provided. \n\nSeveral issues prevent me from raving about this place, but to be clear, I have been there probably 50 times and will always go there. \n\nFirst, don't ever go there unless you have infinite time. Seriously. The staff (varies from great, nice people, and apathetic/sloth hipsters) is completely unconcerned with time and often chats with customers for several minutes before moving through the line of people.  If you are stopping on the way to work for coffee or trying to catch the bus, you'll want to kill someone. They no longer do the drip filters for the coffee but you can NEVER be in and out in less than 8 minutes, even if you are just getting coffee. If you're getting food, even just a bagel, plan on 20-25 minutes. \n\nSecond, they only accept card for purchases over $10 and when I bought blue bottle beans to comply with this minimum they refused to grind the beans for me even though they have a grinder, I guess its some blue bottle policy.  Also, though the food is pretty tasty, the portions are never quite enough to really fill you which is a bit bothersome given that is not cheap.  \n\nFinally, they close at 3:00 pm on Mondays and Tuesdays.

I just assumed that they included potatoes or maybe used an extra large English muffin or something.\n\nWell, of course I assumed wrong. The waitress brought an egg sandwich on a little english muffin. It was tasty enough, but I want by Saturday brunch to fill me up, and the english muffin didn't do the trick. One of my friends had different kind of sandwich on toast, so it was a bit larger, but we were all disappointed. For the price we expected more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-05-27", "description": "Edit:  This place got me through the bar exam.  The staff was super nice, particularly as I became a regular.  The regulars were really nice.  People sitting alone offer up tables to bigger parties, out of sheer niceness.  Their sandwiches are in fact quite tasty.  And their banana pancakes are just awesome.  This place is too close, too pleasant, and too calming an atmosphere to get anything less than 5 stars.  Also the music selection is pleasantly familiar without being either too Starbucks or too out there indie.  I enjoy hearing Graceland every once in a while, and if you follow that up with somewhat obscure They Might Be Giants, who am I to judge?  The last day before the bar, there was almost a sing-along to Jens Lekman.  \n\n------\n\nI moved to my new neighborhood about 2 weeks ago, and, unsure of what was nearby, used yelp to find a good cafe.  I read over the reviews- I almost feel like this makes your experience kind of meta, because you're like \"Omg, are the people at the counter going to be all hip and mean to me?  Is the coffee not going to be as fresh as [insert higher reviewed place here]?\"  \n\nSo, I hesitantly decided to give Velo Rouge a try, because a lot of people did seem to enjoy them.  Truth is, I really didn't get any attitude from any of the people working there.  I would be the first to say that I don't look particularly hip- I vacillate between attempting to be preppy business casual and frumpy don't care (the latter being more of my look while studying for the bar exam).  So yeah, the staff isn't sugary sweet, but that's fine... I like getting my coffee and sitting down and working for a while.  I didn't feel judged, and I can be pretty sensitive sometimes.  \n\nThe coffee is tasty and they make a heart in the foam top of your mocha if you get it \"for here.\"   The peppermint/rose tea is also AMAZING.  I mean, I know they didn't make the tea itself, but they decided to serve it.\n\nI haven't eaten here yet, but given its proximity to me and several of my bus stops, I have a feeling I will fairly soon.  Also, during the week, it doesn't seem to be that crowded, but when it is, it's a lot of fun neighborhood people, including lots of cute babies and little kids (I have in my headphones, so noise isn't an issue).  So that's a plus or minus depending on your taste of clientele.   And they didn't kick me and my Barbri books out, despite me staying for 3-4 hours.\n\nSo why 4 stars?  It closes at 3 pm on Monday and Tuesday, but 10 pm the rest of the week.  Considering I have bar review until 1 pm, that means Mondays and Tuesdays are pretty much out for studying there (or grabbing a nice cup of coffee to take home).   That would normally be a half star deduction, so the other half star is for them not displaying any sort of sign about when they stop serving lunch.  I saw someone order a sandwich, and 5 minutes later tried to order one.  I guess it was 3:57 and 4:02 respectively, and they close the kitchen at 4?  Whatever, I mostly was bored and didn't really want to eat anyhow.  I got tasty tea instead.", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

The barista (Jacob I think?) was really nice and the latte was perfect and totally exceeded my expectations. It was technically  the best latte I've ever had. I still can't say much about blue bottle because I haven't had any of the straight coffee or espresso but I look forward to going back and finding out what all the hype is about.\n\n-Came here again with a friend and the girl who brought out our sandwiches was SUCH A BITCH.

The counter staff was pretentious and annoying -- blasting Hall&Oates while doing karaoke -- with little regard for those trying to eat.   The patrons were annoying combination of Haight Street zombie detritus and young families with children engaged in a i-can-scream-louder-than-you-can competition.

Seeing that I pass it everyday, I though that I should give it a try. I went expecting it to be a good experience and was disappointed for a number of reasons. First, I waited in line for about five minutes. Then I sat at the only table available because the place is kind of small. I was sitting right next to the open front door and was cold. The place was extremely crowded at noon on a Wednesday. It was just too chaotic. I moved tables when I saw someone else get up and moved to a much better seat next to a window. However, the lady at the table next to me was breastfeeding and the baby was about one foot away from me. The food was ok.. just average and decent. The wifi internet worked for the first 30 minutes, but then stopped working and I couldn't use the internet at all. There was no network for Velo Rouge Cafe and no unprotected wireless signals available. The tables were kind of dirty and when I first sat down the last persons stuff had not been cleaned up. After a little while of not being able to use my laptop because of no internet, I gave up and walked home. Next time I will be trying a different cafe. I gave this place a try and don't think I will be going back. It wasn't terrible, but not enjoyable and overcrowded. Also, not one cute girl in the place.", "author": "Steve D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-10-08", "description": "I used to frequent Velo often, in fact I've done the math and have spent over $1,000 there this year.\n\nI've noticed over the past few months that there are many reasons why I will no longer support this business.\n\n1) Convoluted Reward Program\nThey used to give a stamp for each coffee you buy. Now, if you buy 2 coffee's you get one stamp. If you buy 1 coffee, you get one stamp. To fill up the reward card, the math is below.\n\n$140 for 20 coffee's = Free Coffee\n\n$70 for 10 coffee's = Free Coffee\n\nDoes this make mathematical sense to you? They tried telling me that it wasn't fair for them to give a card punch for each coffee you buy. The short of it, don't buy coffee for friends or significant others, it doesn't help you. \n\n\n2) Wait Time\nI've waiting up to 20 minutes for a latte and 30 min for a bagel with peanut butter on it, on a Wednesday morning, with no line and only 8 other patrons in the entire establishment. I've spent less time waiting in line at Blue Bottle at Mint Plaza on a Saturday morning with 30 people in line.\n\n\n3) Poor Customer Service\nFor about 6 months straight, I went and bought 2 latte's every morning, every day. Never had an employee ask how I was, ask my name, remember my drink, or care to say a simple hello. The only nice person is the guy in the back who used to bring me my bagel. Pretentious 20-something age employees, you can leave your attitude at home.\n\n\n4) Rudeness\nI bought a breakfast sandwich at Arguello market because I was in a time crunch and couldn't wait the potential 30 minutes for a simple bagel from Velo. As we were waiting for our coffee's to go, my wife and I broke out our sandwich's to take a few bites before we were on our way. As I was putting a lid on my latte to head out, an employee came over to me and said that I couldn't eat outside food there and pointed to a non-existent sign saying so. Whatever, no problem I was leaving anyway. Without even letting me finish wiping up the spill from putting my lid on, he ran over to my wife and told her the same thing. If he gave me 20 seconds, I would have told her and we would have been on our way. \n\nThe best part about it is that the barrista came from behind the counter as I was on my way out to post a sign saying \"No outside food or drinks\". So my wife and I were ostracized for doing what wasn't posted at the time. I'm not stupid, I saw you put up the sign after the fact.\n\n\nFINALLY\nOwners at Velo Rouge I say this to you: People look for good customer service in establishments that feel welcoming and comfortable. I can tell you that I'll take my $1,000+ to Cinderella and get Ritual coffee instead. You've lost a high paying customer. Oh and by the way, $140 for a free coffee? For the same price I could buy 4 Bags of Blue Bottle Coffee, a Bodum stovetop espresso maker, gallons and gallons of milk, a dozen bagels, a tub of peanut butter, a toaster and still be under 30 minutes.", "author": "Micah K."}

I came here on a Sunday, which was probably a bad idea because Sunday brunch is usually a pain. After wandering around the richmond and even trying to eat at the Presidio Cafe where they were apparently not seating anyone even with their empty tables, I remembered stumbling upon this cafe on a random yelp search so I wanted to try it. We came here and found parking pretty easily. But that was probably the only thing that was quick. We went in and ordered our food... it was a bit confusing, I felt like I was rushed into making a decision because the place is so small and there's a line. Craziness. After grabbing our number we went to search for a place to sit, which was a battle. There was no where to sit so we were standing for quite some time. I want to say 20ish minutes until a couple decided to leave. So we grabbed the table and waited some more. No one came to bus the tables even though some of the servers came out a few times to check on people and such. So our food finally came after A LONG WHILE, which wasn't making the day any better. When the food came out the server saw all the plates and asked if everything was ours... really? I mean I guess it's not impossible for people to order another round of food, but jeebus. So they finally cleared our table and served our food. Boy got the breakfast burrito and I got the huevos rancheros. My food was delicious!!! It was so good... idk if it was because I was starving or what, but it was really good. It kind of made up for all that trouble, so I wasn't as upset. From the tortillas to the fried egg to the sauteed bell peppers and sausage and cheese... OMG it made my tummy so happy :). The boy, however, did not enjoy his breakfast burrito. He said he had better from Jack in the Box. Ouch. I don't know how true that is because I did not try it and it could have been his irritated mood.

Their coffees and teas are great and their breakfast food is PHENOMENAL! I am obsessed with breakfast, so trust me. My favorites are the breakfast burrito and the huevos rancheros. The latter is only available on weekends, but is well worth it. I've had their paninis and those are yum as well. This is a great place to come with friends or by yourself to study (although I normally find myself doing more people watching than studying). Or you can just swing in and get a coffee and some banana bread to go. I highly recommend Velo Rouge Cafe!", "author": "Amy A."}

After 20 minutes, I really wanted to go into the kitchen, toast the damn bagel myself, spread some hummus on it, pour coffee into a cup and bolt out of there. But OF COURSE there were only two staff members working a busy Saturday morning, who were both taking orders, no one was working the kitchen, there was a line going out the door and each customer had to tell their life story to the only two working staff members. Oh god, someone point me to a Starbucks where I'd get my custom made-to-order coffee and toasted bagel with cream cheese in 4 1/2 minutes.

The new year brings me a french press, motivation, and zero patience for the Velo Rouge Cafe.  They shut down over the winter holidays in order to \"remodel\" (aka move some furniture around and pretend like they've made the space more useful) and \"improve service\" (aka keep things exactly the same, i.e. unacceptably slow).  There is a simple solution to your problem, VRC -- ***make a separate drinks line, especially for people who only want drip coffee!!!!!*** (except now that they're serving blue bottle, even drip coffee is slower than ever).  \n\nMy other pet peeve about this place -- sometimes the reason the line takes so long is because the owner flirts and chit chats away with her favorite customers.  This annoys me to no end, because as previously stated, I was one of the first regulars yet receive zero preferential treatment.  I am lucky to get a \"how are you\" whereas some of the other customers get hugs, pet names, etc.  Like me, don't like me, whatever  -- just gimme my damn coffee on time and don't waste my time while you have small talk with the person in front of me for 10 minutes.", "author": "pitter k."}

The food is good too, although sometimes it does take a little while.\n\nWhy only 3 stars (at best)?  The people and general mismanagement.  \n\nHere are some examples:\n1. I hosted my wife's b-day party here in Sep 2007.  They did not have the wine as promised, instead only had a more expensive (not chilled, I may add) white.  When the final bill came, we paid $1300 for the wine, for only 30 people ... of which half had beer instead.  We got completely stitched and the girls running our private event were just awful.  We had to go get things ourselves from the kitchen.\n2. The snotty behavior when ordering a coffee drives me bonkers.  I just asked if they had any pastries.  Answer: no.  Fact: they were serving croissants a volonte from the kitchen!!??  Seriously folks, I am not a fan of Starbucks, but you all ought to do an internship there and learn customer service volume 1.  \n3. The music plays .. goes out .. the staff even doesn't notice.  It's eery  quiet here right now .. a perfect Halloween atmosphere :)\n4. \"Can I please have a knife to cut my croissant?\".  Oh oh, wrong question!!  She sizes me up and shrugs.  I wait patiently.  After serving 2 more customers and realizing that I wasn't going to go away, she stomps to the kitchen to get me a knife.

There are a few outdoor tables and a red helical bike rack with the requisite red bike.\nThere's a full and diverse menu, which I haven't tried.  But the first time I visited, I had a bagel with egg and cheese.  Usually, a breakfast sandwich like this isn't worth writing about, but I was suitably impressed (fresh, toasted bagel; a real fried egg rather than the microwaved stuff out of a carton; good cheese).  I'm looking forward to get the chance to try other menu items.  Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately if you're a local and like it quiet) there aren't any supporting businesses next to the cafe -- I only see a laundromat and small market.  I just hope there's enough neighborhood and bike transit traffic to keep this great place going.\nThe only thing stopping me from giving it a full 5 stars is that I've been only a few times for tea and haven't had the coffee yet.

The coffee is good but just watch out for the coffee grounds though (don't drink it b/c it's bad for you).", "author": "JM M."}

However, I came in the other day to get blue bottle coffee beans for a trip I was going on. The gentleman behind the counter very politely apologized for not having any and sent me to the nearest little organic grocery store that carried it. Just for that I'll make it a point to buy by blue bottle beans there.", "author": "Christine N."}

The breakfast burrito is out of this world delicious! This cafe is all about the cyclist, and is decorated from head to toe with classic, old black and white photos of the Tour de France and other cycling races, along with other bike paraphernalia. Tons of bike parking out front. The cafe staff are warm and inviting.  The only draw back to this cute and cozy cafe, is that it is a bit too cozy on the weekends where you will stand in a line six people deep (it moves fast) and after you've made your order there are only seven small tables that fill up fast, so you may not have  place to sit. If only there was more space. Try to stop at this cafe during the week or for a quick in and out coffee, you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Valencia D."}

Blue Bottle beans and yes, the baristas are trained coffee nerds who know what they are doing.  Love the \"Lone Mountain\" which is like a super condensed latte in a shot glass.  The music is usually good which makes it a cozy place to sit around for a while.", "author": "Matt B."}

Food is mediocre, except for the bagels, which are good.  3 stars for serving okay coffee, good bagels, wireless internet, one nice employee, and good yogurt.", "author": "Laura A."}
