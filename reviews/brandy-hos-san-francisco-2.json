For each entree, you can choose whether you want it to be mild, medium, or hot. I ended up with the mild version. \n\nThe mild version was still a little spicy. Not overwhelmingly spicy but enough for me to go through 1.75 cups of water.\n\nThe dish was not bad. There was a decent amount of rice and sauce. It was very flavorful and the vegetables did not taste raw. \n\nThe service was quick. The waitresses would take away our empty plates and refill our water. \n\nThere were a few awkward situations that happened though.\n\n1. I was about to show the waitress the Yelp page that said we could get free soda with any entree if we check in. The waitress was quick to interrupt that only one person from a group of 4 could get a free soda. This seemed fine to me until we later saw the receipt charged us 25 cents for soda. 25 cents is no big deal but if you are going to advertise free soda on Yelp, you should be honest. \n\n2. After signing the receipt, we were trying to calculate how much each person should Venmo for their dishes. The waitress seemed impatient and kept trying to take the receipt away. We told her we were not done examining it and then she told us to use the customer copy receipt. \n\n3. One employee asked us if we wanted a bag since we packed food to go, so we said \"sure.\" We then got charged 10 cents for a bag. I hardly see any restaurants charge extra for bags if we dine in. \n\nOther than that, everything was fine. The food was mostly good.", "author": "Kristina M."}

Some of the kids I've watched grow up over the years. It's really great to see a thriving family business in these times of corporate chain hell.\n\nI think that by now I've tried just about everything on the menu, and it's all good. My favorites: Hot and Sour Soup, Lemon Chicken, Honey-Walnut Prawns, and oh, wait -- I was about to list the entire menu! \n\nThe Hot and Sour Soup is the perfect way to warm up after a chilly, foggy day in the Big City. (It's good the rest of the time, too.)\n\nIf you're into it, try sitting at the counter where you can watch the chef. It's  a little bit noisy at the counter, but terrific fun to watch the meals being prepared.\n\nTry it! It's a little bit different than ordinary run-of-the-mill mall Chinese food, but different in an amazingly wonderful way! Verb sap. -- if you don't like spicy, tell your server when you order. Hunan food can be really spicy.\n\nI love it!", "author": "Tom P."}

They wok all of the food fresh on the spot in an \"open kitchen,\" and you can watch them cook everything. It's pretty cool to see the giant woks working over massive flames. \n\nThe food is all Hunan style, which is one of the Eight Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine - meaning it is hot and spicy, aromatic, and super tasty! \n\nThe Honey Walnut Prawns are irresistible, as is the Brandys Chow Mein.  We also usually go for the General Chicken, and another random dish.  So far, nothing has really disappointed.  This last time we went for the Gon Pou and it was good, and seemed to keep getting better the more we ate of it. \n\nThey will also serve up things like steamed tofu and rice for the little ones if you have them.  They also serve beer and wine, if that is your thing.  The hot tea is good and so are most of the soups. \n\nBeware, however, that during the dinner rush, this place can get extremely crowded.  It is frequented by tourists and locals alike. Fortunately they do take reservations through the Yelp app, so you can get a spot without too much waiting time.  We came here on a Saturday night around 6, just before they got totally slammed. \n\nToo bad they don't have more locations near me, because I would go here all the time.

It's not one of those places where the nuclear pink sauce makes you question all of your life choices, but a proper sweet and sour that balances out the chicken and fruits/veggies perfectly.

Wouldn't worry too much about it as most times you'll have no trouble finding a spot. There is a limited number of bar stool style chairs overlooking the kitchen prep area, but most of people there are waiting for takeout. The seating area has the standard tables and chairs-no booths-and offers decent ambiance. It's clean, decently laid out, and the lighting allows for a mellow mood set.\n\nThe food is good verging on great. Both the meat and veg dishes are decent if expensive, and it's possible to see great gouts of flame and the food being cooked from pretty much anywhere in the dining area. You will be out about 15-20 dollars for a meal per person which is not bad for the area. There are both cheaper and better places in and around chinatown, but there is no better place that has a decent dining area, has great service, with decent food. \n\nRecommended for the date night and also for the new in town tourist looking for something not terribly adventurous.", "author": "Steven W."}

I didn't have as bad of an experience as some of the other reviews here, but I could definitely see where it could go wrong. \n\nWe stopped in, in a group of ten on a Monday night and it was super dead. We ordered a variety of dishes, smoked chicken, smoked ham, spicy noodles, dumpling and wonton soups, shredded beef, and a bunch more. I tried a number of dishes and while I won't say that anything I had was bad, it was hard to recommend anything as good. I got my dish with the extra spicy option, which meant they just double the amount of spicy sauce it in, which was greasy and gloppy. The dumplings were thick and had a consistency which made me think they were frozen maybe twenty minutes before I ate them, which I think can be said for a number of the ingredients used.\n\nOn the plus side, the presentation is nice, the place is clean, the staff is attentive (I don't know if I would call them friendly as much as I would call them direct) and we didn't wait long.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-26", "description": "This was the most less than mediocre, bland, overrated food I've had in ages. I cannot stress enough how blah and disappointing their food tastes.  Their service is completely below par (and we had delivery! It's not rocket science). I am not sure where this flavorful and delicious food is coming from in all of the other reviews but we clearly didn't get the same thing. \n\nMy husband and I are from out of town and didn't feel like ordering room service at the hotel and the concierge said they are one of the few places that will deliver near us. I got a bad feeling on how this experience would go when my husband said the guy that answered the phone rushed him so quickly he could barely hear him and Mr. Ho hung up almost mid phone number and he had to call back. That was a call back we will forever regret. My husband somehow managed to eke our hotel name, our last name, and room number to the staff. \n\nThe other sign from the stars we should've heeded was that the delivery driver's car broke down and since the man who spoke on the phone with my hubby wrote down our number wrong, we had to call and find out where our order had disappeared. Mind you, this was over two HOURS after ordering. I think it is safe to say that is pretty patient considering according to Google, our hotel is nine MINUTES away. We 100% don't blame the car because we completely understand that cars break. We aren't unrealistic. However, as mentioned, he knew our hotel, name AND ROOM NUMBER. where in that equation did it not occur to anyone that perhaps contacting the hotel to give us a heads up that our order wasn't coming did not add up? It seems like common sense to me to contact the hotel if you didn't even bother writing the cell number correctly. To our delivery man's credit, that poor kid sounded like he had ran a marathon to bring our order after we called. Granted, this is after 120 minutes of waiting and the man on the phone asking if we wanted to cancel our order..... no, we want our food. \n\nOne upside is that I ordered cold noodles with peanut sauce and cucumbers. No, I'm not forgetting a protein part of the meal. That is literally it. Obviously I'm aware that I chose the order knowing there was no meat. However, I thought that even though there was no meat, there would be flavor. Sadly, my dish clearly came without that either. Or peanuts. Or sauce. What I did get was a medium portion of noodles (which were not bad at least) with the runniest liquid I've ever seen. It was literally light brown tinted water. Feel free to use your imagination on what that looks like.... I had to dig quite deep to even find a teeny tiny semblance of a slice of peanut. Maybe they swam away in the peanut \"sauce\"river. My generous husband donated a couple of his beef slices to try and alleviate the flavorless let down. At least the cucumbers weren't soft I guess. \n\nMy husband ordered the beef with onion and wine sauce. He wasn't as disappointed as I was, but that isn't saying much. Never in our years of travel have we ever ordered Chinese food of any kind that doesn't come with a side of rice. Never. Maybe this is a San Francisco thing to charge extra for what provides a little flavor and texture to a meal but for the love of God, if you are going to up charge for flimsy paper plates, the least you can do is include some rice. \n\nSpeaking of plates, as mentioned we are staying at a hotel so clearly we didn't have access to plates or silverware. My husband asked if we could have both. Of course! At 50 center a plate! We are not cheapskates. Money isn't the issue. The issue is charging people 50 cents PER PLATE. It's the principle. I could've walked down to the Walgreens and bought a sleeve of those cheap things for the same price. Way to nickel and dime people who don't have other options. Speaking of generosity, loving that you gave us a whopping three soy sauce packets, try to contain your giving nature this Christmas season. It would've been hard to clean up a small amount, had we spilled, with the two postage sized wafer thin napkins. \n\nAs a special tribute to the two hour delivery, our dumplings were also a lukewarm, mushy \"hot\" mess. The flavor was about as good as my noodle dish. The sauce had the weirdest aftertaste that I can't even describe and clearly I'm not short on adjectives. Can garlic even be rotten? Is that possible?\n\nIt's a good thing we were able to wash out the flavorless dinner with essential fortune cookies every Chinese meal comes with. Just kidding, we didn't get those either. The lack of fortune cookie was indicative of the lack of flavor, service, and other necessities desired to enjoy a dinner. \n\nNeedless to say The Four Seasons' concierge was made aware in no way could this place ever be satisfying enough for anyone who has even the tiniest knowledge of food and never recommend this place to any guests again. If you're skeptical, I uploaded pics. You can't please everyone, but I don't know how they please anyone.", "author": "Sarah M."}

After that it started going downhill. Real fast. We ordered chicken with garlic sauce over rice and Brandy's chow mein. When the food came the chow mein was delicious. The chicken with garlic sauce not so much. It tasted like the cooks may have burned the sauce and I felt bad for my girlfriend because she couldn't eat it. I asked the waitress if there was anyway to swap out the entree because the chicken sauce was not good and we couldn't eat it. This is when it got bad.\n\nThe waitress said ok and then went to get someone who seemed like a manager. The manager then said nothing was wrong with the food. I told her that we couldn't eat it because it tasted bad and something seemed wrong. After a few more times of her trying to argue she said \"ok fine. What do you want?\" My girlfriend asked for the smoked pork over the rice and the manager said \"you should pick something else. Do you want a menu?\" My girlfriend agreed and then the manager gave her a menu and walked away without saying anything.\nThe manager never came back to us to get something ordered.\n\nWe waited about 10 minutes and then flagged down another waitress. At this point we were kind of annoyed so we asked the waitress to just take the meal off our tab and we would just leave. This waitress was incredibly nice and understanding. She gave us a to go box for my chow mein (which I didn't eat because I was waiting for my girls entree) and said she was so sorry for what happened. If it wasn't for her this experience would be a flat 1 star.\n \nMinus the garlic chicken, the food was good, but how we were treated when we just wanted to eat at their restaurant was absurd.", "author": "David B."}

There was a good amount of beef, scallops and shrimp in the dish and it was tasty but could have probably ordered the medium spicy as the mild was a bit too mild. \n\nMy biggest complaint is how hot it was inside.

The nice thing about this place is that it closes at 11pm during the week, where most other restaurants close by 9 or 10. \n\nThe food here is Hunan style.  I don't know what that really means, except it's definitely not Americanized stuff you find at your mall's food court, and they do add heat to some dishes.  I would say the food here is very homestyle.

Their specialties (IMO) are the smoked duck and smoked ham stir-fries, which are amazingly tasty, smokey, spicy and full of crunchy vegetables.  The meat sauce noodles are chewy, rich and filling; the cold spicy sesame/peanut noodles are another favorite.  Curry shrimp stir-fry is so full of flavor and goes well with cold beer.  \nI am also very happy with their service, and they do keep their place much cleaner than what you might expect.

We ordered two small dishes.  One came out larger than the other.  I was excited.  They must have realized I had limited funds, as I'd been asking about prices, and been nice enough to offer me a large plate. That, or the entree was just larger on its own. We got rice on the side.  When I got the bill, it was more money than I had, because they charged us for the single rices on the side.  I was also charged for a large entree, when i had ordered two smalls.  The waiter didn't care and would not help me, instead dismissing my concerns and telling me that this was how much I owed.  I found the manager, who didn't want to speak with me.  When he was done having his casual conversation with friends, he gave me the slightest head nod.  I explained the problem to him, and he basically told me I was wrong.  I told him what I'd ordered, but he told me no, I had the large, and they charge for rice.  I never asked for a large, and I didn't have the money for it.

The restaurant was in total chaos due to the holiday! \nWe did have a 6:30 reservation and we were seated promptly. There were so many servers all running around trying to get food to their customers, and the place was packed! We waited about 20 mins for our server to finally take our drink order and decided to order all of the food at once, including the appetizers,  so we wouldn't have to wait. When I looked at the menu online there are so many choices! But when we got to the restaurant they only had a limited menu for the Holiday, which was quite disappointing! Sure wish the person in which I made my reservation would have mentioned that.\nWe ordered: \n*Steamed and Fried Dumplings; they are good, but not enough filling, in my opinion, lots of dough. Flavorful dipping sauces.\n*Chicken Chow Mein; not too oily, fresh veggies. I did bite into a raw piece of chicken but I think that was due to the fact that the cooks were so overwhelmed with filling orders! \n*Gon-Pou Chicken; I got this mild and it was seasoned just right!\nBrandy's Dinner; fresh, flavorful, would get this again.\n\nAll in all it was a good experience for our first time here. I would not come on a holiday again, however.", "author": "R. B."}

First, the wait staff is fast and efficient.  Second, the food always arrives piping hot.  Third, the food can be modified for those with spicy tastes (pretty darn hot for most) or not spicy at all.  Fourth, the food is always tasty and cooked as ordered.  Fifth, the prices are reasonable and the serving size is plentiful.  Be prepared to bring food home.\n\nOur family has been coming here for over 10 years and we're always treated courteously and never have to wait--no matter how busy the place is.  Particular favorites are any of the Gon-Pou dishes, Hot and Sour Beef, Honey Walnut Prawns, Sweet and Sour Pork, and even the vegetable dishes are excellent!  We also enjoy the Dumplings and Egg Rolls and of course no meal is complete without Brandy Ho's Chow Mein AND Fried Rice.  Yum-yum...\n\nIf you go on Saturday nights when North Beach is really buzzing, these folks have the 'A' team cranking out food whilst the owner (in suit and tie) is busy running a tight ship ensuring the food gets out and the customers are happy.  This is a busy and thriving Chinese restaurant on one of the most hotly competitive strips of food estate in San Francisco (walk down Columbus Avenue and see how many restaurants beckon you to eat at their place) They don't beckon at Brandy Ho's and as far as I'm concerned, it's obvious why.\n\nIn over 10 years and probably 50+ visits here (lunch and dinner), we've enjoyed great consistency in terms of service and food quality.  Bottom line, check this place out and see for yourself.\n\nJack, keep up the good work.  Your team rocks!!!", "author": "Duane J."}

Without fail, I am always reminded that it is served in a bowl with broth like a soup, and every time I am warned not to order it too spicy. I have never been disappointed. The broth is super beefy to match the rich and dark brown chunks of beef mixed with cabbage and thick noodles.

The service, ambiance, location, prices, and of course, the food were all beyond a five star rating. When I was here with my family in July, I ordered the beef with bean cake. The natural umami flavor (that monosodium glutamate tries to replicate) hit my tongue like an IMAX surround sound system. To know that unlike a decent amount of places I know, they don't use MSG (and they even boast the fact), made me only love this place even more. I went over to Yuet Lee (a highly recommended SF Chinese restaurant), asked if they used the stuff, they answered yes (in the sauces to be exact), my family and I left. It's amazing how authentic Chinese food can taste good without MSG, but it's sad that Yuet Lee was lazy enough to use it. I loathe the very existence of Monosodium Glutamate!

I came in with my family while visiting San Francisco. We sat down, were handed menus, the waitress took a while to come over to take our orders. When she did, we asked her about a noodle dish that was on the menu and she didn't know how to describe them. Aren't you supposed to know your menu? Especially if it isn't that big to begin with?\n\nWe ordered soups for each person, an appetizer of steamed dumplings, fried rice, seafood pan fried noodles and general's chicken. The first soup, an egg drop soup, was brought out 20 mins after we ordered. The next soups were won ton soups, brought out about 20 minutes after that. The menu made no mention that the wontons were stuffed with shrimp, which I don't eat. Would have been nice to know in advance, especially those that are allergic and assume they are stuffed with pork. \n\nThe entrees? Oh, those came out in awkward intervals as well. The entrees were okay, but the REALLY crappy service and the fact that we were there for over an hour and a half (maybe even closer to 2 hours) seriously pissed everyone off. There were so many other tables coming in after us and leaving way before us. What is their problem here?\n\nAlso, don't go for the ambiance. The tables are placed way too close together and the place is loud. Not loud because of the customers, but loud because the cooks were screaming and yelling the whole time. I walked out of there feeling nauseated with a serious headache.\n\nPS-- there is a $1 upcharge if you'd like white meat only on chicken dishes. That's just disgusting.\n\nI absolutely do not recommend.", "author": "M B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-30", "description": "Growing up in the neighborhood, I remember the history of the first Hunan restaurant in Chinatown.  Brandy used to cook at the original Hunan Restaurant on Kearny which was located at the current location of House of Nanking.  The owner of this restaurant was none other than Henry Chung of the now famed Henry's Hunan (http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/05/02/BUGOE6DU8T1.DTL&ao=2), who expanded to multiple locations throughout downtown and Fidi.  Brandy decided to stay in the area and opened this restaurant in the early 1980's.  Known for their noodle dishes (Tan Tan and Jia Jiang Noodles) back then, it was one of the few restaurants that offered northern Chinese cuisine.  Hunan food became popular because of the spicy kick, which often became a challenge of \"how hot can you take?\"  Brandy decided to concentrate on the smoked meats (duck and pork) and kept his noodle menu too.  My family dined here when they first opened over twenty years ago, so forgive me for not remembering that meal.  \nRecently, a local friend who never tried this restaurant suggested having lunch here.  We both ordered the Harvest Pork with Hearty Vegetables (medium spicy) as part of their $8.95 lunch special; at other restaurants, this dish is called Twice Cooked Pork.  This lunch included a small bowl of Hot and Sour Soup, a small bowl of cold noodles with peanut sauce and julienned cucumbers, and a warm puffy pastry, flavored like green onion pancake as an appetizer; the portions are generous for this price.  \nPrior to ordering, the waitress ask for our degrees of spiciness (mild, medium, or hot).  We were given a large community bowl of white rice and two individual plates of the pork dish, comprising of thinly sliced pork pieces, green onion stalks, cabbage, and Szechuan peppercorns.  The pork had a leftover flavor, but the veggies and flavors were otherwise not bad.  The dining room was about half full on a weekday afternoon with our table being the only Asians.  This initially made me apprehensive, but glad that the food was okay.  Will come back to try their noodle dishes and other smoked dishes.  Good value for the dollar.", "author": "Mike C."}

I wanted potstickers and maybe some hot and sour soup and somehow we ended up here...I'm so confused.  \n\nI was hesitant but hubby said let's give it a try, can't be that bad since they've been around forever...well, there are plenty tourists and I think they keep this place alive.  Have I become an unsuspecting tourist who doesn't know better and wander into the first Chinese place around North Beach/Chinatown?!?  I'm now beyond embarrassed...truly.\n\nFirst of all, there is NO potstickers!  WHAT?!?  We should have walked then...  The waitress insisted they had it then pointed at the fried dumpling on the menu and said \"fried dumpling is potsticker\".  Excuse me?  Fried dumpling is NOT potsticker and don't you even try to sell me that BS.  By now, I'm beyond upset to even think straight but I know my husband better and know that he won't get up and leave so we are stuck having dinner there.\n\nI just wanted to order the minimum, eat and run.  Decided on:\nstring bean with lamb - $12.95 - we asked for extra spicy.  waiter says \"hot here is very spicy, there are 3 levels - mild, medium and hot - what do you want?\"  We both said again, extra spicy and he again told us it's very spicy.  This went on back and forth and I finally just have to put my foot down and told him we can handle it.  Of course, it was NOT spicy when we got it and I ended up using half jar of the hot sauce on the table.\n\nharvest pork with hearty vegetables - $8.95 - this is better known as \"twice cooked pork\".  it's sliced pork with plenty cabbage in a spicy bean paste like sauce.  normally, the pork has a bit of fat but not here.  we ordered extra spicy and of course it wasn't.  the pork was super lean and dry.  \n\nThe busboy was clearing our table while my husband was still eating.  He basically picked up everything from our table except the bowl and chopsticks my husband was holding.  Never once asked if we were done or if it was ok.\n\nFor the price, the portion was small and quality ok at best.  Given all the restaurants within close proximity, there's no reason to eat here.

It was about 8 PM, & the restaurant we initially wanted to go to had a 45 min. wait, so we decided to walk around while we waited for the phone call from them telling us our table was ready. We stumbled upon Brandy Ho's, & are so glad we did. It wasn't packed, so we were seated right away (party of 7). We are big fans of spicy food, & asked that all the food we ordered be made extra spicy. They delivered! The food was OUTSTANDING. You can tell they don't use MSG (as they are very proud to display on their wall), the food tasted a lot better than some other Chinese food places I've been to. The food is cooked right out in the open, rather than in the back in an enclosed kitchen. So you can see the chefs & the food as it's being prepared. It also comes out piping hot, fresh off the flame! My sister, who is NOT a Chinese food fan, (she had been protesting from the moment we decided that we were eating Chinese), loved it so much that she asked for another order for chicken fried rice for the table. The service was great, our waiter was SO friendly, & chatted with my relatives about where they're from, how they liked SF, the weather, etc. We had a very shy 9-year-old with us, too, & our waiter was sure to talk to him & get him to open up a little. My grandmother, who is maybe a little eccentric, lol, was a fan of the plastic chopsticks on the table. She liked them so much that she wanted to take them home. We tried to tell her that it wasn't appropriate, but since she was so adamant, we decided to ask our waiter how much money they would take to let us keep the chopsticks from our table. He was told us to take them at no charge & even joked with my grandmother about hiding them in her purse. He totally didn't have to do that, but he was very nice about it. Overall, we had a great experience & I would say that if I was ever in SF again & wanted some authentic Chinese food, I would stop here for another taste!", "author": "Radheka S."}

I called to make reservations since there was going to be around 12 people but we weren't positive when exactly we'd be able to get there.

All in all, the food was good but far from spectacular. For Hunan, it wasn't very flavorful or spicy. They brought two of each dish because the servings are pretty small. The pork was the spiciest and the eggplant the most flavorful. General's chicken was pretty standard Americanized fare - battered, gooey and sweet.\n\nFor out of towers who are unfamiliar with Chinese foo, this isn't a bad place to go.

I love the fully open kitchen as well where you can see your meal being made without fear.\n\nMy recent visit was no different.  Wonderfully crunchy dumplings packed with meat and cabbage, smoked duck and several other items were prepared with love.\n\nAnd no MSG.", "author": "Jim M."}

And I also felt like our waiter really didn't like us or at least did not want to be there that night. He actually scolded one of our party at one point for asking for a fork (you said just no, why you ask for one now?!). Um, yikes. \n\nHunan is a region in sort of mid south eastern China, but I'm not sure what that means for the food. \n\nSo hot and sour is one of my favs, but the hot and sour soup here was a little weird. I love super spicy food, but hot and sour soup is not supposed to be too spicy. I mean, it's not that super red pepper kind of hot. It really threw off the balance of the soup, it's supposed to be hot AND sour. Not just hot. And I never really thought the hot referred to spicy, either. I barely touched my soup and I would recommend you skip this. :(\n\nThe dumplings were actually quite good--surprisingly, I preferred the steamed to the fried. I should have spent my dinner calories on those. Also, the fried onion cake just did not live up to the hype and sort of reminded me of a tortilla.\n\nSoooo, yikes, the smoked duck. I couldn't imagine duck bones were so big, but they're big and it's not so easy eat meat off bones with chop sticks (my failings, I know). The smoke flavor is so heavy, it almost smells like shoe leather or your fireplace. Dear god, no...it's upsetting my tummy thinking about it.\n\nThe \"general chicken\" which is what I heard them calling it was some strange sort of orange chicken like dish with a nice crispy texture, covered in an unpleasant, sweet glaze and sesame seeds. Broccoli on the side.\n\nThe best entree dish ordered was the Kung Pao Beef and Shrimp of which I only tasted the beef. This was a good, medium spicy dish with lots of onions and peanuts.\n\nOverall though, the food was heavy, but not tasty enough to justify its weight. The waiter really did make us WAIT--at least 15 minutes between all the appetizers being taken off the table and coming back to take our order. He messed up our order twice and brought out the wrong things which we just accepted and paid for.\n\nThe atmosphere also left a lot to be desired, though my favorite part of this restaurant was the bathroom, which was impeccably clean!\n\nPS. The girls at my high school named Brandy were pretty much all hos.", "author": "Jayi R."}

In fact, it was at Brandy Ho's that I was served my first Chinese food so in a way, it was where I lost my Chinese food virginity!  \n\nWith each trip to San Francisco now, I make a special trek to Brandy Ho's (Columbus Ave) for at least 1 or 2 outstanding \"No MSG\"  Hunan meals.  Each is freshly prepared while you watch from the bar or if you choose, you can be seated in a table or booth.  For those that do not do \"hot\" then since this is Hunan, it is best to inform your waiter that hot is not on your menu!\n\nSome of my favorite dishes are:\n\n1) Spicy Eggplant which is prepared with a garlic sauce and hint of vinegar.\n2) Vegetarian Sting Beans which have a wonderful hint of ginger and garlic and are stir fired perfectly. \n3) Several of the Chicken Dishes such as the Si Foo Chicken with Black Bean Sauce. \n\nI've also had the Salt and Pepper Calamari Appetizer which is OK. \n\nThe only dish I have gotten which I would not get again were the Fried Oysters Appetizer as the oysters were cooked to be far too crispy for my local coastal tastes. \n\nBrandy Ho's also serves mixed drinks which are reasonably priced as we each had a round before departing. \n\nOverall, I frequent Brandy Ho's for the Hunan dishes and not the standard Chinese fare which can be found almost anywhere.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-07-27", "description": "Ordered a delivery from here and it was okay, pretty good considering there is no MSG. One thing I have noticed since being in San Francisco is that many chinese restaurants use a lot of MSG so I'd specifically chose this to stave off my intake as I think I've already maxed out for the month!!\n\nI had ordered an Onion cake with peanut sauce, Shredded pork with vegetables in hot bean sauce, Spicy eggplant, a brown rice and a steamed rice (Obviously my gf was here and it's not that i just love rice!).\n\nNow when I opened the containers up I must confess that the food looked colourless and not very appetising to eat. However, the taste was certainly there considering that there is no MSG. I don't know, maybe it's cause I was eating with the knowledge that there was no MSG that convinced me to give it a chance and like it. In the end, I thought the shredded pork was good, especially mixed in with the rice. It was ever so slightly salty but obviously they must compensate for having no MSG. The eggplant wasn't spicy at all which was surprising as it's a Hunan restaurant and the dish is called Spicy Eggplant! This dish was okay but I could see some people might be put off with the texture as it was very soft and almost mushy. The onion cake was basically a deep fried pancake, not sure how much onion was in it!!\n\nI think due to it being no MSG I would give this place 3 stars. If i had some of the other dishes I might be giving it more but I think it's one of those restaurants where I can easily be rating it less as it appears to be so hit and miss judging from the reviewers.

The shrimp fried rice had tons of fresh shrimp but not much egg or green onion; the flavor was good.  Maybe that's the Chinatown proper way to make fried rice?  I'm always used to it having a lot of stuff in it.  Service was fast and it was fun to watch them making dumplings from scratch at the table behind us.", "author": "K G."}

I previously lived in S.F. and the bay area and heard of this restaurant, so I decided to see the reviews on this website. Most were positive, so I thought that it should be a good experience. Quite the opposite!\nWe ordered the eggrolls to start which were good but not exceptional (i.e. p.f. chang's from the market is just as good). However the sauce was very good. After several recommendations from these reviews, we ordered the calamari and salt. The calamari was underdone, chewy and dipping sauce was the only redeeming quality. The last thing we ordered was the curry chicken which was mostly bamboo shoots with little pieces of shredded chicken. The chicken was so tiny you could not have even used it for popcorn chicken.\nThese three items cost us $39, which were clearly overpriced considering the fact that we didn't even order drinks and the fact that they charge extra for overcooked rice to accompany the chicken dish.", "author": "Charles W."}

Yay-- i liked ALL the dishes. yum-- score. the rice had a lot of egg, the beef dish tasted fresh and seasoned well. the soup perfect.\n\nfinally-- good chinese food! \n\nthe only drawback..... i didn't get fortune cookies. i guess they don't have those here. i was hoping to get one that said \"you will have loads money coming to you in the coming year\" or \"a hot boy is about to ask you out\" or \"you have an enormous brain and everyone admires you\"..... but oh well. \n\nbottom line is, i'm elated i found quality chinese take out. yes, i foresee many more cozy nights on the couch now that i found brandy ho's. (hi allison-- i'm sure you're really thrilled about that)\n\nPS: oh--- i almost forgot! major bonus points because they included CHOPSTICKS with my food and not plastic forks. this is the first chinese takeout in a long time that didn't look at my last name in their database and say \"oh look, we have a white girl here, give her the plastic forks\"  huh? i've been using chopsticks with ease since i was about 4 yrs old..... anyway, so thanks to BH for having confidence in my chopstick skills.\n\nUPDATE: i just got the nicest note from Jimmy Lam, the Catering Manager at Brandy Ho's thanking me for my review..... he said i'm VIP now. yay! what a great restaurant....  even more impressed than before. oh and he kindly explained that fortune cookies aren't real chinese tradition. so now i know : ) oh, and he mentioned that they are opening up a 2nd location in the castro soon too.", "author": "Michelle I."}

The facilities as well as the dishes were very clean (not always the case in Chinese restaurants in SF). Also, I was surprised by their open kitchen. You can see all the orders come up and know that they've freshly fried your dumplings or onion pancake.\n\nI had the \"Old Country Vegetables\" (because I don't eat meat). It was $8.95 and included baby bok choy, chinese mushrooms, some noodles and fried tofu. It was pretty good, but, not as good as \"Henry's Hunan\". However, all the food had less grease than Henry's. I also had the Onion Pancake with peanut sauce. When this arrived, it was piping hot and obviously freshly fried. Again, this was pretty good, not the best that I've had. It was a bit thin.\n\nOur out of town guests had the hot and sour soup, tofu with ground beef, and noodles w/ peanut sauce. They all seemed to eat their food with no complaints. It hit the spot after walking the city and craving a little friendly chinese food.\n\nThe service was also better than most Chinese places. The waitress smiled and often asked to refill soda. It didn't take long to flag someone down for water or extra tea. The dishes didn't come out at the same time, however. While my friends all got their food, my dish didn't come for another 5-10 minutes until we asked where it was.", "author": "Joan L."}

I've never had Chinese curry before and it was delicious and spicy.  \n\nThe General Tso's shrimp was so soft, tender, and fluffy it was almost a shame to eat them.  Like little prawn pillows.  Yum.

This restaurant wins the distinction of the WORST excuse for chinese food that I have ever experienced.. and I have traveled around some the shadiest, no-chinese-food-having places.... backwaters of north carolina in the mid-90s, denmark in the 80's, you name it.  And I thought it was 'bad' then. \n\nbut this my friends, puts things in a whole new perspective... These people, if they are people at all, must be the meanest, most evil humans on the planet. Laughing as they water down the cardboard-flavored soup some more, cynically tossing in bloated packets of cabbage-and-mystery-meat into the same flavorless broth... and calling it 'tasty.' \n\nPlain, canned chicken soup, ladies and gentlemen, would have been a grand improvement over the handiwork of these culinary charlatans. \n\nThe fried rice-- it could not have tasted worse if they had scavenged the leftovers from the backs of every restaurant on jackson and fried it on the blade of a shovel. Burned, greasy, enough salt to withstand the northwest passage, and totally devoid of any sort of FLAVOR. Unless charcoal and salt is a flavor. \n\nIs Brown a flavor? how did the rice get brown without being imparted some sort of taste? I've heard of 'tomato shade,' but is there 'soy sauce tint' as well? \n\nAfter years of following my nose into back alley kitchens and second floor cafes, relying on my instincts and the blind faith that no matter what anyone says, there couldn't be BAD chinese food in SF chinatown-- maybe NOT GOOD, but NOT BAD-- my faith has met its match! and been vanquished in a single mastication... well maybe more than one, since at first my cortex couldn't believe what my taste buds were telling me.. \n\nSo in a way, although I'm totally disgusted by the food, I have to thank Brandy Ho for teaching me something, for giving me a 'peak experience' albeit of one nastiness, and for broadening my horizons. \n\nSo thanks again brandy, you are truly a Ho, when it comes to cooking. \nMay the likes of you ne'er darken the door of my kitchen! \n\nPS I have assigned it 1 star only because yelp wont allow Zero!", "author": "D L."}

I sit at the bar sometimes, and chat it up with the owner. He's a nice guy, and has a great sense of humor. \nAdvice: Get the diced, boneless chicken in curry, garlic and hot sauce. Tell them how spicy hot you want it. If you want to scorch your mouth tell them to bring it on.\nOnion cakes are good.\nDon't expect a fine dining experience.\nLoosen up and have a Tsing Tao to douse the flames in your mouth!!!\nIf you like it hot and spicy you have found your place.", "author": "SF N."}

I said to myself this is one of the most yummiest fried rice that I have ever eaten!!!!!! I also have to say that the hostess who took me to my table was really nice and friendly and also it is a great way to see the chiefs as they prepared your food order right in front of you when you get a table that is close to the kitchen...  Another thing about Brandy Ho's I have been other chinese restauants  that really had  fifthy bathrooms but when I went to use the bathroom at Brandy Ho's it was really clean which is a good thing!!!!!", "author": "William B."}

My fiance's food came out about 20 minutes before mine (I didn't think veggie fried was was a particularly complicated dish).

The location is also ideal; you don't have to deal with the chaotic and hustle-bustle of Stockton Street (which absolutely gives me a headache!).    \n\nFood here is spicy, which is their specialty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-08-20", "description": "Not even close to being the best Chinese food ever (and not really authentic Hunan), but pretty decent Chinese-American food. Instead of the sweet sauces that places like Chef Jia's favor, Brandy Ho's opts for spicy and salty.\n\n  The spice level is really good (I order everything \"extra hot\" and it's hot, but never too hot), but the salt level is ridiculous. Their green beans in spicy meat sauce is a fantastic dish, but the sauce is so salty that even a teaspoon of it mixed with steamed rice is still staggeringly salty. Signs everywhere declare \"Absolutely No MSG!\" That's a great PR gimmick for those psychosomatics who think that MSG causes them all sorts of ailments but will much down a pound of American snackfoods which are loaded with MSG (read your food labels) and have not a single complaint. I'd rather have a pinch of MSG in the food than a handful of salt. It would taste better and be better for you (really).\n\n  The fried rice is mediocre at best, but the potstickers are quite good. They seem to vary in flavor, just like the sauce they are served in depending on the cook. One time I got them and the sauce was just plain chili oil. I like chili oil and all, but...\n\n  The service is pretty mediocre also, but the waitstaff are typically teenagers with trendy hair in t-shirts, blue jeans and worn sneakers, so I guess you can't expect too much. Even so, it sure can take an awfully long time to get that tiny glass of water refilled. Due to the heat and sodium levels of the food, you'd think they'd use bigger water glasses.\n\n  It's pretty much a mixed bag and definitely over-rated, but you can get non-sugar-based Chinese-American food for a reasonable price (for SF) and it's very convenient (order on-line and swing by to pick it up in 30-45 minutes). If you are looking for real Hunan food, keep moving (though this is more authentic than some). If you want something other than sweet fried stuff and have a high tolerance for sodium, this ain't too shabby.", "author": "Thomas S."}

The dumplings are made by hand on the premises.\n\nOn the table is a little jar of their home made black-bean pepper sauce.  it goes well with just about anything and has a very unique flavor.\n\nBTW, you can buy jars of these sauces to take home.  I used to bug them for little containers and they finally broke down and now sell them.\n\nNow for the main dishes -- the Kung Pao chicken is a gold standard.  Their beef with green onions is one of their specialties.  Try the Si-Foo chicken dish with it's black bean sauce too!

The country vegetables is a good option if you want to pretend you are eating healthy as you gorge yourself on the great Ho's grub.

In addition to your main course and rice you get a plate of three modest appetizers including hot and sour soup, either cold sesame peanut noodles with cucumber or fermented cabbage, and a fried dough treat.  \n\nAnd they have brown rice, which always sells me.

A generous dash of salt would have helped bring out the flavors. The onion pancakes, which in (my conception of) their ideal state would balance an interesting texture of crunchy exterior with warm, doughy center, were fried to a shattering crispiness. The aroma of green onion had been fried to death. For an entree, I ordered the diced boneless chicken with string beans, which came with weird hair-looking strands in the containers. The tiny-sized irregular-shaped bits of chicken didn't look diced or, for that matter, like any kind of chicken meat I'd ever seen; perhaps it came from leftovers of whatever is used to make McNuggets. The much-hyped spiciness was one dimensional and bland. \n\nThe only reasonable compliment I can pay Brandy Ho's is that the delivery came on time. Which is too bad, because I wouldn't have minded if it hadn't come at all.", "author": "Ian S."}

It always smells so good and spicy and that's right up my alley. The place is rather small, but had a full bar and served Chinese beer. The tables are really crammed in there so don't bring a briefcase or any bags with you--there's nowhere to put them. \n\nWe ordered the lunch special, which considering the prices was the only option. They use the same menu for lunch and dinner but there's a few options for lunch only. It was $8.95, which isn't too bad, but the dinner options were well over $12. For lunch we got some cold noodles with a satay sauce--very nice, an onion pancake--rather dry, but a good size, and something else that I can't remember, must not have been that great if I can't remember it! They serve some crispy noodles with some sweet and sour sauce to each table. We both ordered the spicy beef with onions. It was spicy and light--we didn't feel weighted down for the rest of the day or like we wanted to take a nap. Not the best I've ever had and not the worst, but didn't really inspire me to come back anytime soon. \n\nWe did have some problems--we asked for water 3 times and when we finally did get the water they only brought one glass. We ordered a beer and the glass was dirty. We also were sitting next to a very dirty plastic plant--it's plastic, hose it off once a year. \n\nLike I said, we won't be going back anytime soon. A neighbor in our bldg mentioned that they are excellent with delivery to our bldg, so maybe if we're there late in the evening we may try delivery. I'm thinking the smoked ham--that seemed to be their special.", "author": "Denise L."}

Creamy, spicy, crunchy, cold, with the sliveriest of chicken pieces, this dish  is utterly satisfying. 5 stars. Accept no substitutes.\nOther dishes I've had here have been OK, particularly the smoked ham dishes. Frankly don't care for the steamed dumplings, kind of lumpy and bland, and the smoked duck which sounded so great on the menu was a loser for me - hard to eat, and lacking any crisp duck skin, not that they don't warn you on the menu - they do,but still had higher hopes.

I got poo on some steamed cabbage. \n\nI'm thinking they ripped me off by giving me the stewed beef (other item on the menu) because it's been sitting in their fridge for days and need a sucker (ME) to make some of it go away instead of putting them all in the trash.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: It was hard, no flavor, nasty dry texture all covered in a brown sauce I don't care for.

The ambiance is nothing really special - it just seems like any ordinary Chinese place but in a prime location. My date's a seafood fan, so we got the seafood delight appetizer which includes calamari, oysters, and some prawns. I was definitely a little buzzed at this point, but I didn't think everything would be fried. The fried oysters and the accompanying sauce were delightful though, but it would have been nice for one component to not be fried. \n\nThe girly got the honey walnut prawns, and they were sweet and savory. I got the \"three delicacies\" dish which includes scallops, chicken, garlic, ginger, wine sauce, onions, shrimp and other stuff. It was darn good. Everything's served family style, so if you order a clunker you can easily grab some from your companion. \n\nThe bill was about $85 with tip for an appetizer, two entrees, rice, and four alcoholic beverages. I suppose that's pretty reasonable for a date night out, but I still feel I could get similar quality for a lot less at other places in the city. It probably wouldn't be in such a prime location, but Chinatown's only a few blocks from North Beach anyways. I'm glad I went and we had a good time, but I'm in no rush to go back.", "author": "Marin P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-01-18", "description": "Ordered deliver from here the other night and was rather lukewarm about the entire experience.  The online ordering process was easy and convenient.  I like the fact the they allow you to specify the level of spiciness, as well as provide pictures of many of the dishes.  The hot & sour soup wasn't really as flavorful as it should be, and the general tso's chicken was fairly bland as well even though I requested extra spicy.  What WAS good was the smoked pork on steamed rice. The pork was REALLY flavorful with a great strong smoky flavor and aroma (don't order unless you want your hour to smell like smoke for a while).  All things considered it wasn't a horrible meal, but the fact that it took an hour and twenty minutes for delivery, and 2 of the three dishes were adequate at best means there are far better options in this city for American Chinese than Brandy Ho's.", "author": "Joshua W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-02-15", "description": "Brandy Ho's represents the only Chinese restaurant I've ever found that's been able to pull off the \"NO MSG\" thing without creating dishes possessing a blandness rivaling that of raw oatmeal.  It's also the only Chinese food I've eaten that doesn't leave me feeling like I've shotgunned a quart of 10w-40 crankcase oil.  Better yet, it's never left me with a post-dinner outbreak of the Heebie-M.S.Geebies either.  \r\n\r\nBack in the day when I could eat a manhole cover for lunch and still be hungry in time for dinner, I patronized A LOT of Hunan/Szechwan places.  Whenever I tried a new one, I'd scan the menu for my favorite order-every-time items, many of which have underwent an unofficial standardization for sake of Western civilization.  This sector of the restaurant industry appears to have unwritten rules, but Brandy Ho's breaks them, and does so in a fashion that works.  On the downside, even experienced Chinese food aficionados have to read the menu to grasp what they're ordering.  On the upside, what you get is a truly different approach to Chinese cuisine.  It's simpler, but still flavorful.  It's filling, but not overly oily.  It's spicy to the palate, but easy on your stomach to the point that several after-dinner beers at a pub on nearby Green street will evoke a friendly buzz rather than digestive chaos.    \r\n\r\n\"Hot and Spicy\" dishes are clearly marked on the menu, and even these dishes are available in spice levels from \"mild\" to \"extra hot\".  Stick to the tame end of the spectrum if you hail from from the Northeast or a similar area that likes it's food devoid of spices.  On the other hand, don't expect a serious \"burn\" from the hottest things the cooks can throw at you if you're a Habanero-loving fire eater from the Southwest.\r\n\r\nLooking for Chinese flair without the oil and grease?  Check out Brandy Ho's....it's stimulating to the palate and easy on your stomach as well as your wallet...", "author": "Mike W."}

It's the perfect place to take parents who want the Chinatown experience but would be horrified by the appearance of many of its better dives. They smoke their meats - including ham, chicken, and duck - on the premises, and all the dishes featuring these are excellent. Start with a platter of some of the more popular appetizers, like onion cakes, fried dumplings, and egg rolls, served with assorted dipping sauces. Three Delicacies, a combination of scallops, shrimp, and chicken with onions, bell peppers, and bamboo shoots, seasoned with ginger, garlic, and wine, and served with black-bean sauce, is an excellent entree option. Everything is authentically hot and spicy, with lots of garlic, but dishes can be prepared on the mild side, so be sure to specify the degree of heat you want when ordering.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

Imagine - the Hunan Gon-Pou Chicken actually has chicken, and lots of it, vs. a pound of green peppers.  And, it's spicy!  Dry sauteed, with crunchy peanuts - delicious.  Also, if you're willing to get your hands dirty, the smoked duck is divine.  Big chunks of flavorful meat in a tangy sauce with colorful veggies - a Hunan delight.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-04-07", "description": "Disclaimer: In 1999, I had my first case of food poisoning when my roommate actually ordered shrimp fried rice from one of those ridiculous menus rubberbanded to our front door by the invisible ninja's that relentlessly paper the residences of San Francisco proper. After vomiting out the driver's side door most of the way home from work that morning, I spent the day shivering in bed as my landlord and his construction crew removed a chimney with a jackhammer. They played one CD -- Milli Vanilli's debut album \"Girl You Know It's True\" - for the entire day. From that day forward, I a) never forgot the lyrics to this awful, awful record and b) vowed to never again \"take a chance\" on Chinese food delivery. \n\nSo now that you know where I stand on the subject, let me first point you to Brandy Ho's posted pictures of every dish you can order on their website. Following delivery, you can open each box, look at the screen, look back at the box, and make your own judgment on whether they were cutting corners in the kitchen. Love it! Since discovering this little jewel of the orient, I've had it twice in two weeks and I can't recommend it highly enough --- especially when it's for one of those occasions where alcohol is served (if you're into that kind of thing). \n\nPersonal favorites include the crab won tons, the beef fried rice, General's chicken (white meat) and sweet and sour pork. There is a noticeable difference between Medium and Hot. For illustrative purposes, I would draw a comparison to a recent trip to Central America where I decided to drop from Sunscreen (40) to Tanning Oil (4) because I wasn't getting tan enough. Similarly, in this instance, I felt like the Medium wasn't quite hot enough and tried to take it up a level when we ordered (what else) a shrimp dish the second time around. In both instances, I got burned. \n\nNot to be insensitive or anything, because I'm sure it's quite difficult for a native Mandarin speaker to try to understand what I'm saying in a loud restaurant with my admittedly less than perfect enunciation and lack of patience, but the online ordering capability is a huge differentiator against the other various Chinese food delivery options. Given my tendency to change my mind six or seven times and the almost guaranteed 10-20% English to Chi-nglish translation error, being able to get this order documented is a home run. With a market sample of two, the follow up call from Brandy Ho's to confirm the delivery time happens in less than two minutes and is not only courteous but a MUCH more manageable conversation than trying to order everything over the phone and this experience has made me a long term buyer. Needless to say, I'm quite looking forward to the upcoming release that includes an in window chat session with a specialist.", "author": "Bryan P."}

I did notice that the dishes were a lot less greasy than the usual Chinese food I eat so that was a plus.  I also liked how many of the dishes incorporated a lot of vegetables which was good.

If you have ever had a decent Chinese meal, stay far away from this indecent and pitiful excuse for food. We had several dishes and they were all disgusting and inedible. It was truly the worst food I have had in my life. The sweet and sour chicken was covered in thick, chewy, lifeless styrofoam batter, and the sauce was neither sweet nor sour, just a confused mix of hot pepper and vinegar. We felt sorry for the chicken that got smothered in that mess. We had one bite and ditched it. The mo si (aka mu shu) pork was like canned chicken soup in bottled barbecue sauce inside an old tortilla. I could describe the other disasters masquerading as food but it would just make me feel sick again. We left virtually everything on all the plates and walked having had not more than one or two bites of everything. We would have gone somewhere else to eat but we were so grossed out we didn't want to see food for days. Where's a good vomitorium when you need one? \n\nIn my experience, all forms of Chinese food - Hunan, Schezchuan, Cantonese, etc., have mostly 100% wonderful ingredients and recipes (save chicken feet, etc.), so I am baffled that it was even possible for Chinese food to be so consistently and enormously disgusting!! Not bland or off the mark, but literally revolting and inedible.
