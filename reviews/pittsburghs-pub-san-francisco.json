This little watering-hole is out at the edge of the universe (Ocean Beach at the end of the N-Judah).  It's several thousand more miles West until you'll hit another dive bar.  After many a trek out to Ocean Beach, Golden Gate Park, etc. this has been a good stop to A) Use the bathroom before catching the Muni back, B) Charge my phone after taking lots of photos, and C) Have a few beers, because, why not?  \n\nTo be fair, there's not a lot of options out in this neck of the woods.  Before I had visited here, my impression was that it was sorta sketchy.  That hasn't been my impression now that I've visited.  It seems like a neighborhood place with a core of regulars - and I've had a few interesting conversations (and learned all sorts of cool stuff - like why Judah is called Judah).  Generally the crowd is a little on the older side.  I've seen a lot of negative comments about the service on Yelp, but I can't say that I've had any complaints.  It's about what I would expect.   They've got plenty of space, and have two pool tables, so it's not a bad place to chill.  And, they have a Pittsburgh connection.  \n\nAre you going to find a designer cocktail list here?  No.  Are you getting dolled-up on Friday night and come here?  No.  But, if you'd like a solid place to grab a quick drink, check it out.  \n\n(***Side Note - and I'm not 100% sure this is correct - But, I was told that they have a family connection to David Evans Strickler, the guy who invented the Banana Split in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.***)", "author": "Adam S."}

They've got some high-def TVs (with only low-def reception), a pool table, and it's dog-friendly.\n\nAs with a lot of dives, much of the experience can depend on who's tending bar.

I lost count at how many times that was mentioned. Are you sure, Aaron? Because you didn't sound sure... ; )   Also, that you should rate something upon what it is, not comparing it to swishier, swankier bars in town. Head to the Marina, Financial, Pac Heights or Hayes if that's the experience you're seeking. Don't be surprised when you're swimming in douche-bags. Don't get me wrong; some people like douche-bags, finding them quite date-able. I sometimes visit to these places to reinforce that I'm on the right track with my personal lifestyle choices, but now I digress...\n\nMany reviews peg this place as \"the best Dive Bar\", and this, it is. This is the bar that bartenders go to when they're off. Drinks are cheap.\nThere a couple of bartenders who are very cool, friendly and have serious skills. Rick (long dark hair, pulled back, big guy) is a Star. I can't recall the other guy's name (Mike?). When they're bartending, by all means, come in, come in. If the place is packed, as it often is from 11p on, those two are probably the reason.\n\nKelly the bartender is a train wreck. She's incredibly (possibly deliberately) slow, occasionally rude and since bartenders are responsible for cleaning the restrooms, my guess is that she skips it. Does she have a good heart? Yes. But would she make a better bartender in Alaska? Definitely.\n\nThere's an older bartender who is an even messier train wreck. I've never felt so much resentment coming from a bartender for simply ordering. I don't drink Mojito's, either. I drink shots, vodka sodas, or beer and I tip crazily to half-decent bartenders. I bellied up on a Sunday at 4p with a friend for a beer. He glared at us, and finally took our order. Two beers, two shots. I thought he was going to throw them at us. I can't believe this guy has a job. I'd never stiffed a bartender in my life, until then. My friend & I drank up and headed to Tee-Off to finish drinking and yapping. \n\nHere's where I respectfully disagree with other reviews:\n\nDIVE BAR does not equate to, or JUSTIFY RUDE BEHAVIOR by the bartender. Period. Ever. When I am spending my hard-earned cash at your place, I'm tipping well, am not being loud or disorderly, am keeping it simple and holding my liquor, I expect the SAME RESPECT that I am giving. There are tons of great dive bars in this city WITH friendly bartenders. It's not oil & water. It works! If you enjoy being abused, go to Zeitgeist. Some people like abuse. Just like some prefer bars full of douche-bags. \n\nThey have two pinball machines which rates highly for me (one is full of magnets, the fishing game, a total \"cheater\" - the other is great and I never visit \"Pitts\" without a roll of quarters).\n\nNo pop on the jukebox, but you will find The Persuasions and The Temptations, vintage day rock, a little something for most... \n\nThe crowd is older, younger, hottie, ridden-hard, hip, not hip, and just a good mix. I love a bar where I can chat with a drunken stranger over the age of 50 on my left, AND talk shop on Lady Gaga with a young gay man to my right.\n\nThe drinking crowd knows this neighborhood. It's Pitts, Hockey Haven, Tee-Off, Trader Sam's, or nothing at all.", "author": "S S."}

NEXT!\n\n\"I don't know.  when you're going to school at 7:30am and see people waiting at the front to get in for \"first call,\" you begin to ask some questions.\"\n\nAlcoholics usually go to DIVE BARS to get drunk, that's why they are called DIVE BARS. In order to not sober up and start seeing stuff that isn't there they need to start drinking early. This place caters to dive bar patrons surprisingly enough because it is a DIVE BAR! CHECK!! NEXT!!!\n\n\"Am I retarded for thinking this place would have anything to do with Pittsburgh? I wanted to like this place. Wanted to love it. I went in with the lowest of the low of expectations.\"\n\nLowest expectations eh? Lowest expectations are what you get in a dive bar pal because they are not built for expectations other than getting drunk. Sounds like you need to join your friend above at that pirate bar I mentioned. Don't they have some crap baseball team called that from the same city you want your theme to be in? Might be perfect for you. NEXT!\n\nOh boy, the list goes on and on......\nBut lastly, to make sure and cover all the basics of a dive bar:\n\n\"BTW, the mens room is horrific and, based on 3 inquiries,  the ladies room isn't much better .\"\n\nUmmm, I have yet to be in a real dive bar that has sweet smelling, clean bathrooms. I mean they drop those chemical bombs in the water that permeate your clothing for days after like every other dive bar does. But still, part of the experience of going to your local dive is to see how long you can hold your breath in the bathroom, or just breath through your mouth like experienced drinkers do. Piss quickly and leave, do number two before you go out!\n\nStinky old bathroom part of the dive bar formula? FINAL CHECK!\n\nHave fun at Pittsburgh's, it's a dying breed, literally. \nAnd always remember, \"Don't Try\"....", "author": "Aaron C."}

I don't know one person that likes going to this bar, and I live in the Sunset. I actually used to live two blocks away, wanted to call it my local, but went there a few times and decided never again. Never, ever again.\n\nThe place is dirty, the bathrooms are gross with no lock on the door (I am a chick, so a dude probably doesn't care about that fact, but the kind of guys that hang out in that bar, a lock is the order of the day), and two out of three bartenders were rude and not responsive. Another thing a dude doesn't care about are the old guys that will crowd you when you are left unattended. My boyfriend and his friend went out for a smoke, my friend and I stayed seated. Two regulars took their seats immediately to hit on us. We mentioned that our boyfriends were outside, and they laughed and said they'd get up when the men-folk came back. They just wanted a chat. That situation was repeated on future visits. \n\nThe bar just gives me a bad vibe. Again, I am a chick, so maybe this isn't a review that helps a man any, but I do not feel safe when I go to that bar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-03-05", "description": "Like most drinking establishments that hail from the Outer Sunset, Pittsburgh's Pub is pretty rough around the edges.  But unlike a lot of them, it's got a lot more going for it.  Amongst these things are many intangible qualities....qualities such as character, local charm, and community. Want to know the odds on the favorite horse running in the third race at Bay meadows?  Ask the gray haired man speaking loudly in an Irish accent.  Curious about when somebody from the hood is due to be in court or to get out of prison?  Talk to the guy missing a tooth at the end of the bar.  Need to know the point spread for this weekends Steeler game?  Talk to Pittsburgh Dan, a born and bred Pittsburgh native that made his way Westward to run Pittsburgh's pub for better or for worse...\r\n\r\nThe crowd is fairly static.  This is due to a sociological phenomenon observable in the Sunset and the Richmond...one where the Avenues function something like a sieve of humanity, gradually screening out the tourists, wannabes, and bridge-and-tunnel posers as you head West and the numbers get bigger.  Most of them come straight off the bridge and make a beeline up to North Beach.  The next big chunk gets hung up at 9th and Irving, then 19th Ave screens out most of what's left.  By the time you're out to 47th and Judah, anything that isn't lived-here-for-years local or westward-with-a-destination gets pretty much filtered out.  The few that make it this far out don't give Pittsburgh's a second glance as they high-tail it out  to Ocean Beach.  The result is a VERY local crowd....a crowd that's tight-knit, but not insular....a clientele that isn't afraid to say who they are, and never claims to be anything they're not.   You won't get a warm welcome just for walking in the door, but you'll probably get a handshake and a smile if you make the first effort to break the ice.  \r\n    \r\nFrom a square-footage standpoint, Pittsburgh's is pretty large for an outer Sunset pub.  The Judah street entrance dumps you right at the point of a shotgun bar that runs the length of the West wall.  A spacious area towards the Southeast corner hosts dueling pool tables.  A sizable dart throwing area takes up the remainder of the space with four boards on the Judah street wall. \r\n\r\nThere's usually a seat at the bar, though it can fill up after work or on weekend nights. The crowd for sporting events rarely makes a dent in available seating , though Steeler games during football season tend to fill the bar,  forcing overflow seating into an awkward arrangement in the pool/dart area.   Eat before you head out here...There's no kitchen on the premises, the restaurant selection is pretty bleak, and free bar snacks only come once in a blue moon. ( Update 6-24-06 There's a great Chinese take-out place just up the street ) The dart boards get plenty of action after dark, but  pool tables usually go begging.  The premises have a pleasant mustiness about them without being dirty, and the bathrooms are always clean.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a neighborhood hangout in the Outer Sunset, give Pittsburgh's a good looking over.  Ditto that if you live somewhere else, and you're in search of a home-away-from-home.  The patrons are real, the owner is friendly, and the N-Judah MUNI makes a stop within a stones throw of the front door...", "author": "Mike W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-10-22", "description": "First off, I have to agree with Mike W who said \"This is due to a sociological phenomenon observable in the Sunset and the Richmond...one where the Avenues function something like a sieve of humanity, gradually screening out the tourists, wannabes, and bridge-and-tunnel posers as you head West and the numbers get bigger.\"  Nothing could better describe the Outer Sunset and the resulting crowd that this bar has to offer.  It's right around the corner from my house and to be honest, if there was some posh drinking space in it's place, I'd happily call that my local bar as well.  I'm just lucky that the Pittsburgh is here instead.  \n\nMost dive bars have some irony about them.  Bartenders that act mean on purpose, unclean bathrooms as a sort of indicator that you are truly in a dive bar, and almost always, some random piece of junk such as an old dead car *cough Zeitgeist!* to give it that feel.  This is the real deal - walk inside and you feel like you're in a mining town in Allegheny County.  Plenty of space to stretch out and chill with your friends, and literally no need to pose or try to impress a soul.  Just come here, get a drink, relax and feel at home.  Plenty of things could change - they could add to the beer selection, add a kitchen, whatever, but I say the formula works, why change it.\n\nThere's several screens with different games on so you won't miss a thing.  If you do, just ask Dan, he will give you the details.  The last time I was there, he gave me my last few drinks free.  \"Been buyin' booze all night, this one's on the house\" is what he said.

What I found was a classic middle America feeling local bar.  The place seems to attract normal middle aged blue collar folk.  The bartender (and everyone else for that matter) was nice and in good spirits, the pours were heavy, there's pinball, pool tables, and darts, and the place is totally removed from any \"scene\" you might find in the city.  Once inside you could be in any small town neighborhood bar in the country for all you know.   This seems like a great place to escape when you get your fill of the whole trendy San Francisco vibe common in bars deeper into the city.  I'll be back.", "author": "Joshua W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-17", "description": "I was afraid of this place.  It had a couple of strikes against it.  One, it's waaayyy out by Ocean Beach, and before you outer sunset-ites get grumpy about me badmouthing the neighborhood, it just gets a little scary and foggy at night is all.  Two, there always seem to be...interesting looking women hanging around outside this place.  Anyway, probably because I already was fueled by alcohol, I checked out this place and I will just say one thing: chocolate cake in a shot glass.  Now, the bartender convinced me that Frangelico and vanilla vodka chased with a sugary lemon tastes just like chocolate cake and I was all, \"nuh UH\" but it was a very drunk girl's birthday so we joined in.  Well my friends, it tasted like chocolate cake!  And for anyone that knows me, chocolate cake is my kryptonite.  Finding it in (highly) alcoholic form is very, very dangerous.", "author": "Leslie R."}
