The egg rolls were fried very nicely. When we started to eat them, we found a few pieces of cabbage, and that was about it. It just seemed like a really lazy tourist trap of a restaurant. \n\nHowever, they had a lot of options on their menu so I really don't want to slam them for one bad dish. So if you go here, maybe just get something different than the egg rolls.", "author": "Jonathan H."}

The g/f had some sort of noodles with beef, can't recall the exact name.  I ordered a curry chicken with white rice.  It's east asian style curry chicken so it's more watered down.  I liked my curry chicken.  I asked for mild, and it delivers.  The chicken itself was very fresh.  I chow that down within a couple minutes.  Meanwhile, the g/f did not like her noodles with beef at all.  She said it was tasteless, it lack sauce, and looks nothing like the photo.  \n\nThe server was an older gentleman.

It wasn't what she experienced the first time.  \n\nInterestingly, this place opens at 11:30 instead of 11 am like any other restaurant, but that's understandable. Everything started off good, the server (who wasn't too friendly but that's alright) brought us hot tea and took our order pretty promptly. We had just ordered lunch specials, sweet&sour chicken and peking baby ribs, but then decided to get fried shrimp after we placed our oder and the server was able to bring our appetizer before our lunch which I was very pleased. The shrimp and s&s chicken were pretty good but the baby ribs tasted like they've been refrigerated for a while or something. \n\nThe real reason why I gave this place a 2 star is because of the service, not only was our server a little rude but when he brought us our bill we see a grand total of $37 for 2 lunch specials $8.95 ea and a shrimp appetizer with 9 shrimps for $12.95.  Upon checking the tab, I see an interesting SV charge of $4.60 and when we asked the server, he said it was a service charge.  Now, I've worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years and my wife for 4 and we've never seen a \"service\" charge, maybe gratuity on 6 or more people but certainly not on a 2 top. He didn't explain much about the charge when he took the money from my wife's hand and walked away to cash us out without letting us talk. We were both very mad he did that!  \nIf he would've been friendlier and not enforce his \"SV charge\" maybe we would've given this place another try. But after how he treated us, we're definitely not going back.  I'm all for tipping your server, after all, thats what they live off of, but theres a difference between deserving a tip and demanding it. It's sad that even if you have a good product but your customer service is lacking, you can really hurt your business and create a bad reputation.", "author": "Miguel P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-07", "description": "I ventured in here while in China town. Friend and I were enticed by the \"dinner for 2\" deals they had. The server was an older fellow and brought us hot tea. Don't use their bathroom, it's dirty. My friend needed to charge her phone, and the man let her use one of his side outlets. When we were ready to order we tried ordering the \"dinner for 2\" at a rate of $16.95, but upon ordering we were informed it was $16.95 per person. I thought, \"what? Why would you advertise dinner for 2, if you're posting the price of one meal?\", it just doesn't make sense to me. So we ended up ordering a different deal for $12.95 which included hot and sour soup, which I may add was so delicious, an egg roll, sweet and sour pork and pork fried rice. The egg roll was good, sweet and sour pork had a nice crunch to it but I found a couple chewy pieces I didn't care for, and the pork fried rice was good but the egg pieces were quite large, made me feel like I had a side of scrambled egg with my rice, and it also included saut\u00e9ed lettuce... lettuce! The lettuce wasn't bad, it was different, but halfway into it I found myself scooping away the lettuce and the big chunks of egg. I'm not a picky eater by any means, but this just wasn't my lucky day. Over I rate it an ok lunch with my friend, I liked how the man let my friend charge her phone and he brought us tea, but get this... as I went up to pay, the man gave me my change and told me the tip wasn't included. I asked what he meant, and he clarified that he had not charged me for the tip. At that point I felt awkward, realized why he had given me back a lot of small bills for change, and told him I'd leave him one at the table on my way out. I left him $3 he quite frankly didn't deserve, but I didn't want to feel attacked on my way out. In shorter words, Food is meh... and the service wasn't bad... but bad.", "author": "Karina S."}

The cook has a radio blasting in Chinese in the kitchen.  The whole place feels dated and tired.  The walls are covered in mirrored panels to make this narrow space seem larger.  Our waiter was an older man who was polite but also seemed sleepy.  I didn't venture into the restroom so I can't comment on that.  \n\nThe Meal:\nWe tried the General's Chicken and a mixed-seafood/veggie dish, steamed white rice, and BBQ pork fried rice.  Nothing tasted fresh.  Nothing was above room temperature.  Everything was below average even for an \"Americanized\" Chinese food standard.  Mixed seafood/veggie had mostly rubbery, dry, flavorless squid, more peas than any other veg, and watery \"sauce\".  The General's Chicken dish was much too sweet, chicken was dry and over breaded, too salty and just not good.  \n\nThe Price/Payment:\nPrices are too high for the serving size and the low quality of the food.  As others have mentioned, it was disturbing that the waiter took our credit card and walked out front.  We assume they process cards at a nearby shop but we'll be keeping an eye on our Visa statement in case of \"unauthorized activity\".  \n\nVery disappointing experience since we know that San Francisco is a foodie town, and there surely must be good, authentic Chinese food elsewhere.  \n\nWould not recommend or return to Snow Garden.", "author": "Tina P."}

There aren't any ostentatious decorations.  It's not ugly and there are a couple nice paintings inside, but it's a place you go for food, not for ambiance.

Its tenants see out-of-towners coming a mile away, and are more than happy to cater to their expectations of what a Chinatown should be.  Impressive gate, check; illegible signs piled on top of each other, check; overpriced, mediocre restaurants that have only the appearance of authenticity, check.  The Chinatown in your mind is beckoning to you from Grant Avenue, and is ripe for the taking -- for the right price.\n\nDon't buy into it.\n\nReject the Chinatown of five postcards for a dollar, fresh-from-the-sweatshop undersized T-shirts, and flimsy paper folding fans. \n\nPass up the self-righteous tourist trap restaurants, with their ostentatious dragon-wrapped faux jade columns, vermillion pagoda rooflines, and surly dim sum ladies.  These places talk a big game, but underdeliver on both food and service.\n\nWhatever you do, don't even set foot in Empress of China.  You're not famous enough to end up on their wall anyway.\n\nIf you go to Chinatown, make it a different kind of Chinatown -- the Chinatown of Snow Garden.\n\nSnow Garden sees you coming too, but they know you are coming in because you are hungry, not just because you want to \"eat in Chinatown\".  They are unassuming enough to be passed up by most tourists, who still have that image in their head of what they think Chinatown is.\n\nThey will sell you a comfortable-sized combo for one for 12 bucks, serve it to you in 5 minutes, and won't charge you extra for tea.\n\nThey know you won't care if the server reads the paper while you are eating, or that they take deliveries through the front.\n\nBut most importantly of all, the place is clean, the food is delicious, and those two things alone will keep you coming back for more.\n\nSnow Garden is my Chinatown -- and it can be yours, too, if you challenge your expectations.", "author": "Erik A."}

The lunch specials are cheap and plentiful, the staff is very nice (ON one visit, I complimented the waiter on our Chow Fun noodles, and he went and brought the chef out so we could meet him. Very nice man).\n\nI like it becasue it's a nice contrast to the more tourist-y places on Grant. It's nothing extraordinary, but I've been visiting this place since high school, so it's very comforting coming back.", "author": "Kathleen B."}

Not much atmosphere, but we weren't really expecting that. Food was OK - certainly edible, but nothing special.  Prices were reasonable ($8-$10 for typical entrees) except for the eggrolls-3 for $6 -they were small and were mostly rolled wanton rappers.  We ordered 4 dishes: Lemon Chicken - it was OK, but not much lemon flavor.  Beef with Peppers - didn't taste like a Chinese dish or any version of this dish we've tried before.  The beef was soft and shredded (not slices of beef that would be expected) and was in a light brown gravy rather than a typical Chinese sauce.  It didn't taste bad, just different.  Orange Peel Beef - two out of three of us thought this was the best dish we had.  Shrimp Fried Rice - other Yelp reviews said this was great - it was good, but not great.  Had to pay an extra $1.50 for steamed rice - we ordered two and it came in small cups.  Considering how cheap steamed rice is, we thought that it was pretty skimpy.  Service was good (although they did bring the wrong order: Orange Peel Chicken instead of Orange Peel Beef, as ordered - the mistake was corrected immediately).  The hot tea was typically good, but we weren't offered a refill pot.  Soda is in cans.  They do have one restroom that is acceptable.  We were hungry so we ate everything, but we noticed people at other tables left good amounts of food on their plates.  Not a standout experience, but it was OK - no major complaints. As others have mentioned, if you want to pay by credit card, they tell you that they have to run the card next door.  If I hadn't read about this in other Yelp reviews, I would have been freaked out when they told me they were leaving with my card.  Weird, but at least they are trying to be accommodating since they obviously don't have the equipment to run the card in their restaurant.  Better than Cash Only, I guess, but still unsettling.", "author": "TL R."}

This one had the best reviews, so I tried it. I found it kind of blah. They were nice enough and service was relatively quick, which exception of getting the bill. I ordered the beef with tender chinese greens, which turned out to be beef with mixed vegetables, and rice. The rice tasted like it had been boiled in murky water. The beef was not too fatty, but did have that pounded into submission feature prevalent in many low caliber Chinese places. It didn't taste old, but it wasn't super fresh either. The vegetables were tender, and generally the dish was ok in terms of flavor. The whole bill including tip came out to $13 for one person. It was medium-low quality and just kind of run of the mill. I wouldn't avoid the place if it was the only option, but I won't intentionally go back either.\n\nTo be fair, I DO live in the town with the best Chinese restaurant ever - http://www.yelp.com/biz/great-wok-burbank - so these guys had difficult competition where I am concerned.", "author": "E S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-15", "description": "My friend and I chose this place through Yelp! We wanted Chinese food and this place was close and received 4 stars. The outside and the inside look very hole-in-the-wall ish but it has been my experience that some holes-in-the-walls serve amazingly authentic food. The inside is small--about 10 or so tables. On the day, we went it was very understaffed--one waiter, one cleaning lady and one chef so service was sloooooooooww. We ordered two dishes to share-the spicy tofu (without pork) and sweet and sour prawns. We also got two bowls of rice. Once the food arrived...it was really delicious. The rice was soft and warm. The prawns had some crunch and the sweet and sour sauce hit the spot. The tofu wasn't very spicy though. So it just tasted like tofu with some sauce...I'm used to more chunky tofu and more pepper. The bill came out to $24 which is really a great price for a meal that left us quite full.", "author": "Esther E."}

I actually have changed my favorite restaurant in Chinatown to this restaurant.  I will not name the old favorite.  Everything I ate was good, fresh, and hot!   I ordered the combination C for 2 that had the mongolian beef, shrimp fried rice, chicken salad, and lemon chicken.  EXCELLENT!!!!!  This place is the best!  Our server was very nice.  The food came out lickedy split.  If you don't eat here you are missing out on some wonderful food!  Thank you, I will be back monthly.", "author": "Allison C."}

The food is great, you have to get  the BBQ fried rice and the potstickers, all of their soups are yummy too. They are huge 2-3people could easily share it! We have been there many, many times and would only go here if we eat in Chinatown. The same waiter is in there all the time and he serves you like you are in a 5 star place. He is as sweet as can be, they do take CC, and it's onw of the BEST kept secrets in SF for sure!! Def check it out,  Oh yeah, we get a ton of food for all under $20 for two and FREE hot tea all the time!", "author": "Heather L."}

One man was servicing all the tables so our wait was a bit on the long side but still was good service. Always scary to order food from something like this but we were pleasantly surprised that every dish we ordered was fantastic! The Peking Spare Ribs were delectable and so was the Orange Peel Beef.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-09", "description": "We were on a road trip as a family and stopped here for lunch while visiting SF's Chinatown in 2002.  We were hungry, and our boys at the time were 8 and 12 years old.  Every ten paces we had menus thrust at us from various restaurants.  Not liking that type of advertising and turning us off completely, we saw the Snow Garden which had a menu in the window.  When we walked inside and decided this was our lunch place, it was the best decision.  Not only did my husband and I love it, but our two sons did, too.  The food was incredibly fresh and was the quintessential Chinese food, in my opinion.  It was quiet inside and not too busy at the time.  Since we live in Washington state, we're unfortunately not able to eat here regularly.  Of course, when we go back to San Francisco, we'll definitely go back to the Snow Garden for both the food and the good memories of a great family vacation.  It's great to see that yelpers are raving about this place.", "author": "N W."}
