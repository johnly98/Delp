I try to pay close attention to the reviews for 3.5 star places to see exactly what went wrong. But I thought Gold Mirror was a definite hit! After reading the other reviews, I think some of them might be outdated and a lot of them are about bad service--so that's something you can consider for yourself.\n\nNow, I preface this by saying that if you're one of those people who's going to be like \"I just spent 3 weeks in Naples and my palate has just become so Italian, you know, I'm such a refined food snob now!!!!\" then you probably won't like this place and, pardon my French, but you should probably also get your head out of your ass.\n\nBut if you're looking for a somewhat fancy neighborhood place to get some good food, absolutely come here! The service was great, and our waitress seemed to be Italian herself. She was super friendly and prompt. The ambiance was pretty fancy; it seemed like one of those old school places that you'd take someone you like on a first date or something. Gold Mirror has a charming interior.\n\nThe food was great too! We had the minestrone and mushroom/pancetta soup and both were delicious. The lasagna was weirdly flat shaped but tasted delicious. The meat was tender and not at all like typical ground beef, and it was gooey and cheesy. We also had the pasta of the day, which today was some sort of seafood pasta that smelled and tasted amazing! We also shared the lemon butter salmon which was sooooo buttery and delightfully lemony. I loved every bite! For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu and the zabaglione. The tiramisu was good, and my boyfriend thought it was unique (he orders tiramisu wherever we go). I've never had zabaglione before, but it was basically like a boozy, fruity warm custard. It's VERY boozy but very delicious, if you're into that kind of thing :)\n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back but probably only on special occasions because it is quite a bit expensive!", "author": "Claire C."}

I first came here shortly after I moved to the Bay Area in 1979????? Time flies so quickly. After a visit to Golden Gate Park, the De Young Museum, or perhaps returning from Marin County, this is a great stop. \n\nMy friends had the cannelloni and veal piccata and both pronounced the dishes among the best versions they had ever had. The excellent veal piccata is floured and cooked in white wine and butter. Our appetizer, the garlic prawns were amazing. I thought at first they might be overcooked because they looked blackened, but they were perfect. My companions tried the daily specials, rack of lamb and chicken fettuccine. Again, everything was perfectly cooked and flavorful. I don't do desert but friends said tiramisu was a keeper.\n\nPlan a leisurely meal as you won't get in and out in 20 minutes.

Busboy brought water and bread pretty quick, but waiter didn't even bother greeting us before table next to us arrives and he greets them and takes their order. He then takes care of a reject salad from another table before he eventually comes to greet us which was basically \"any questions?\" and \"Are you ready to order?\" and then takes our order. He never even asked for our drink order. Then it turns out they are out of the only thing I wanted to eat, so I start looking at the menu. I ask him to go ahead and put the rest of the order in while I peruse the menu again and he says he has to put whole order in at once or else the kitchen will get confused. Really? Like you're a new restaurant? And haven't been in business forever? So instead of making my whole party wait for me to decide, including my elderly mother, I skipped on entree. Rude, unprofessional, intolerant waiter. Poor attitude. Cold service. Unapologetic. Poor reflection on a Restaurant that is supposed to be a neighborhood gem and SF institution. \n\nNow he won't give us water or food. Yes, I'm writing this review as I am sitting in the restaurant. Keeps me from thinking about how hungry I am. Table that came after us got dessert, leftovers packed up and their bill. We're just waiting....Hostess notices we haven't been served after 1.25 hours and goes to kitchen to bring us food with help from another server. Pastas clearly have been sitting around. There is dry crusty layer forming on tops. She says to be careful, plates are hot. Uh, barely warm. She does end up comping the two starters we had. She apologizes that they had huge party upstairs.

Evidently, that's the case just about every night.\n\nIf you're not a native, SI is St. Ignatius, & SH is Sacred Heart.  They're the top 2 private catholic high schools in the city.  They're also notorious rivals.\n\nThey basically hate each other.\n\nHow can you tell if someone's a real SF native?\n\nBy how they answer you when you ask them where they went to school.\n\nIf they answer w their high school, then they're SF native.\n\nIf they answer w a college, then they're certainly not.\n\nThis was a topic at our dinner table w 5 SF natives, & our neighboring table w 3 more.  And, it turned out that they knew each other.\n\nSo la famiglia.\n\nNow, the food.  I was struck by all the veal options, & I don't even eat veal.  They're known for their dore, & their cannelloni.  I was told that their cannelloni recipe came straight from a fellow dining companion's mom, who used to own an old Italian restaurant in SF that closed long ago.\n\nSmall world, ain't it?\nOr, I should say, it's a little city, ain't it?\n\nIf you got that reference, then you're a native, or you've been in the city for at least 25 years.  \n\nI didn't expect to run into friends from North Beach, or the club (SFIAC), all the way out here, but that's exactly what happened.  So random.  This is parkside, no where near NB.  It certainly was serendipitous running into friends from the neighborhood & the club, & ultimately dining w them.  But, the piece de resistance was actually my dish.  \n\nI ordered the chicken fettuccine w forest mushrooms.  It's not a dish that they're known for, or even a staple dish for me.  I ordered it just because of the truffle oil element.\n\nIt was outstanding.\nMaybe the best non-artisan pasta dish I've ever had.\n\nI went home w leftovers, & licked the plate the next day when I polished it off.\n\nEvery element here, from the history, to the food, to the staff, made a routine dinner an extraordinary one.\n\nI'm withholding a star for the front windows.  If you're sitting by them, you're right on the muni line, so it's a bit loud.  And it's cold.  \n\nIt's not nice dining in the cold.\n\nNot to mention, if you're a real guido, you're way too visible up there.

A wonderful, garlicky, buttery, fresh calamari dish.  Two of us had the veal scaloppine. Again, absolutely wonderfully tender and delicious.  I forget what the third one of us had.

The bartender Christian takes good care of you, and he's also an SF native. I recommend sitting at the bar, loading up on the cheese & crackers, then ordering a drink and a small appetizer. You can easily get a meal for less than $20 here. \n\nIf you like that old-school Italian restaurant swag and don't want to go to Joe's of Westlake or North Beach, this is where you must go!", "author": "Maurice R."}

The salmon was good and I chose to upgrade to housemate fettuccine alfredo pasta for a $7 up charge instead of the rice which I enjoyed. The rice pilaf that typically accompanies the meals is literally Rice-a-Roni- pay the up charge to switch it to something else! Also pretty small portions for the price point. \n\nIt was a good experience and a great meal but nothing innovative or exciting. Pretty straightforward menu with lots of warm bread to begin. \n\nWould recommend the *housemade pasta (they have other pastas at a cheaper price point) but save your money on the calamari - beyond drenched in oil and not worth it!

You know, places like Delfina, Cotogna, Flour and Water, and Perbacco.  Gold Mirror is considered old style Italian, and while some things recommend it, I now know why new Italian has gained favor.  \n\nOn entering I found the hostess talking on her cell phone.  Soon it became apparent that she was helping an older patron get just the right reservation.  Good for the hostess.  And she seated me at the best table available.  Good for the hostess. \n\nMy server approached abruptly and asked what I wanted.  As it turned out I did: Pasta and then fish.  He suggested a half order of pasta and then the fish.  Good for the server.  He may have been a bit abrupt but he was helpful.\n\nAnother thing that the Gold Mirror has to recommend itself is pricing: Gold Mirror is easy on the wallet. \n\nMy half order of  fettucini with grilled chicken, wild mushrooms and truffle oil arrived and my server was right, a half order was plenty.  The mushrooms were there and nice, likewise the chicken, but while the pasta was al dente it was bland.  And in my humble opinion, truffle oil should be discarded.  It has an overwhelming scent and it masks the taste of everything else on the plate. Many people would think this was a good plate of pasta but I longed for the deep, rich flavors of sugo of the sort that covers pasta at Perbacco.\n\nFilet of sole meuniere was not to my taste.  The large portion of fish was bland, under seasoned, and mushy as though it had seen the inside of a freezer.  The green beans that accompanied the fish were a bit overcooked and had lost any hint of snap.  The rice that came with the fish was OK. \n\nIt's not that Gold Mirror isn't a good place, it's just that I've become an Italian food snob and expect a bit more from the food.", "author": "David D."}

We grew up in this Taraval St. neighborhood and have been dining at the Gold Mirror on and off since the 1980's. We have many fond memories of countless wonderful meals at the Gold Mirror with its warm, friendly, and always professional staff. But such a staff seems not to exist anymore. Today's dining experience was ruined by our waiter's indifference and the awful service. We had lunch, and the restaurant was hardly crowded. After being ignored for more than 10 minutes, we flagged down the waiter. He could care less whether or not we ordered. He was rude, almost annoyed and said something like \"Did you want a drink?\" We ordered wine, soups and entrees. The soups appeared immediately, the drinks came later...no time to enjoy the drinks first. After the entrees were served, there was no more waiter. Trying to get a second glass of wine took two requests, a reminder and another long delay. Too bad that a lack of service affects a restaurant we had greatly enjoyed and have a long history with. The food is still good, but we won't go back. Service counts. The manner is which guests are treated is unacceptable. Why would the Gold Mirror keep a waiter who has a 100% negative effect and who clearly disdains the job that he is supposed to be doing?", "author": "Mary R."}

Though we had a reservation for dinner on Thursday evening (2/22/2018) the Gold Mirror sat four of us at a table in the midst of eight other tables which were occupied by a team of 12 persons conducting business with other persons who were not patrons of the restaurant, and did not order food (but were occasionally treated by those working to tea or a tidbit). These 12 walked between tables, back and forth constantly (I should mention the tables are tightly spaced with barely room for service people to squeeze by) and eventually, not happy with the never ending disruption, I asked one of them exactly what they were doing.  As it turns out they use the restaurant instead of an office to work with persons who wish to divest themselves of \"time share\" investments they no longer want or need.\nThat the restaurant (a very small one) would use its space at dinner time on a crowded Thursday night in this manner is questionable at best  -   but that we would be seated in the midst of those tables is unforgivable and demonstrates total lack of one of the fundamental tenants of restaurant management - customer service.\nThe restaurant's white table cloths and decor belie what is a crowded, noisy, lazy space.  The servers were lax, perhaps overworked (there were obviously not enough of them), one member of our party received his entree at least five minutes after everyone else.  The bill arrived prior to our being asked about dessert  -   and was incorrect (a total of $36 for dinner for four), and we eventually received a corrected one - but now we see that we have been charged for both.\nThe food was ok if unremarkable -  historically San Francisco is home to many, many  fine and ordinary Italian restaurants which deliver both family and haute cuisine  -  and Gold Mirror should not be listed among them.", "author": "Nancy P."}

And I've always lived in the neighborhood. I have a friend who great up in The City and said he went here with his family for special occasions in the 70s. So we decided to try it on the spur of the moment. I had hoped for something more old school and less Brooklyn Renaissance. I think someone decided to \"remodel\" in the 90s and probably ruined the old fashioned decor ... Replacing it with more of a tacky decor than anything else. Although I do love the chandeliers and the \"gold mirror\" on the wall. That said, I didn't hate the decor. It was fun and kitschy. But I just wished for something more original to when the restaurant opened. The food was quite delicious. Although I would've liked my marinara sauce to be thicker and less watery. I have a feeling they don't serve much marinara sauce. It certainly wasn't anything memorable. Everything on the menu seemed to be strongly meat oriented. Marinara sauce wasn't even on the menu as a choice with pasta. My co-diners had lasagna and enjoyed it. The bread was superb. Crispy on the outside and soft and warm inside. One place where this restaurant lost lots of points was their charging for soda refills. Come on guys, this isn't the 1970s. Businesses have been giving free refills on sodas for nearly 30 years. And to make matters worse. To not even tell the customer that you're charging them for another soda when they ask for a refill. This seems to me as a very low brow way of taking advantage of your customers. Especially for a place that seems high brow.  Charging for soda refills, that cost you literally 5 or 10 cents is just plain tacky. Other than that, the service was very good, if not just a tad snooty. Maybe our waiter didn't expect much from us. We left him a $30 tip. So we might've changed his opinion of us in the end.", "author": "Daniel S."}

Likewise, we also utilized the tapenade that came with the roasted artichokes as a spread.

You couldn't even taste the crab because the dressing was so heavy!\n\nFor my main, I ordered the lamb loin stuffed with mushrooms and spinach with a side of polenta. The lamb was amazingly tender, cooked perfectly! A nice seared edge with a juicy interior. The polenta though, was not as creamy and smooth as I would have liked, instead it was allowed to firm (to serve as a \"stage\" for the lamb). Meh.

We were greeted by a friendly host, and our service throughout was very good. The food was excellent, and the warm bread and cool butter was very much needed prior to our meal being served (I was starting to get HANGRY!). \n\nI started with the minestrone soup; which was probably one of the best that I have had anywhere! My entree was a fettuccine pasta with cream sauce, and I added prawns to the dish. This was also quite excellent - freshly made in-house pasta blanketed with a thin layer of the perfect combination of butter/garlic/cream sauce, and the prawns were perfectly seasoned with garlic. My parents also equally enjoyed both of their dishes. The presentation of the meals was also quite lovely. \n\nThis is a delightful Italian restaurant.

You don't feel \"above\" them, you feel welcomed in by them, guided, and at ease.  Guests are invited to take their time- and since I often have trouble deciding on my entree and wine pairing, I honestly do appreciate the staff chatting with me about what they like and recommend, in a completely amiable way.\n\nEvery meal spent at Gold Mirror has been just a lovely, low-key experience.

When they are adjusted, look around at the decor and be prepared to step back in time.  The tables are situated fairly close to one another and the noise level is high.  The conversation is lively, the martinis are flowing and \neveryone seems to be having a good time.  The waitstaff is dressed in tuxedos, which is a nice touch.\n\nAlthough the decor is of the past, the menu is not.  Some dishes have been updated with a modern twist and all dishes I've tried here have been quite good.   The pasta dishes are not heavy and overly cheesed (is that a word?).  One dish that stands out is the lasagna, which consists of thin sheets of handmade pasta with ricotta and sauce.  It's not the brick that is served at many Italian restaurants.  The chicken and veal dishes are also quite good.  The pasta dishes I've tried have all been cooked well and are well seasoned.\n\nWhile the service has been spotty at times, perhaps because the restaurant has always been full on my visit, I've never experienced anything that would prevent me from returning.  On my visits we have had at least five people people in the party and we have always left satisfied.  We have never had to wait to be seated upon arrival.

They did have a reservation and got seated within 5 minutes. Well it took them till 8:27 to seat my wife and me. And the real bs to all of this is they give us the table closest to the door in this little corner. This table had been empty of customers sense 8:05. It took them 22 minutes to clear off a table for a couple with a reservation. A table that's 3 foot by 3 foot! And gave to balcony  table to a couple without a reservation. Service was okay. Nothing special. They did bring bread and water frequently. But they should put ice in the water. Water is better cold. The meal was good, but basic. Nothing special.

They have probably been working there for 20 years with local customers, and they really couldn't care less about pleasing any new guests.

I got the feeling my server made this assumption right when he saw me, bc he was very cold from the get go. He remained very cold for the duration of my time there, and after seeing other reviews I'm thinking this is very standard for this place. I was dining alone, so I didn't have to wait extremely long for my food like many others had issue with. However, my server would only drop off what he had for me and then quickly and curtly leave. He never came back to check on anything, I had to flag him down to get refills on my drinks (they charge for soda refills btw, I rarely see that) and he just seemed very apathetic concerning my meal. \n\nAs far as the food, it was fine. I got a very simple plate of spaghetti and a meatball, so it would be hard to mess that up. My issue was the price. I don't remember exactly how much my main dish was, but it was over $20. Considering everything was a la carte, over $20 for a standard spaghetti and meatball plate is pretty high. This place wasn't fine dining or anything that would justify such a high price. Overall, the food itself wasn't really a problem. It was the awful service combined with unjustified high prices. \n\nLastly, the most egregious thing that happened didn't even involve myself. I witnessed a server thoroughly berate an older lady. He was so rude to her that I pretty much decided then that I would not be returning. I eat out constantly, and I have had many bad experiences, but I've never witnessed something as despicable as this. No matter the circumstance, a server should never raise his voice to a customer. \n\nI have heard about this place for a long time, it's supposed to be a real throwback as well as a treasured restaurant in the sunset.

The waiters and staff were so wonderful to the kids.  The only complaint was that we had reservations for 7pm and didnt get seated until after 7:30.", "author": "Steven B."}

In the past few years, the chefs have added innovative, delicious, & seasonal daily selections to the regular menu.  The Gold Mirror's cuisine is consistent which we believe is an important element when dining out.  Our favorites include any of the pastas, my favorite is the house made ravioli ; Chicken Cacciatore, Calamari (appetizer and the entr\u00e9e), Petrale Sole, house salad is basic but good as is the Minestrone, and the specials vary but are definitely worth trying.

Called in and no problem. GREAT, we'll get a nice meal served in plenty of time. The four of us get there at 5:45 and the nice hostess says it will be a few minutes. Well, the few minutes rolled into 15 minutes so I inquired . . . actually how long will it be before we're seated: in about 45 minutes.  So let's see: 5:45 really meant 6:45.  I said we had reservations and told that they have no seating limit policy.  In other words, if a dozen people made reservations for a 5:45 seating, you'll get the reservation. No problem. You just wont get a table.\n\nAlso noting that in 15 minutes standing around, little food was coming out of the kitchen, the full dining room was feasting on bread and water.  It looked like very person there between 5 and 5:30. Full room and no food.  Such a treat!  \n\nWith a little Yelping, we decided to head to Irving street and found the very nice Chabaa Thai restaurant. Intimate, family run and wonderful Thai food.  \n\nI have several suggestions:  1) have an open bar for those of us waiting with complimentary wine and drinks, or consider serving complimentary \"waiting wine\" when people are seated and waiting.  This will help the management figure out that you'd only make so many reservations within a certain amount of time.  2) Since you're waiting, why not check out the other restaurants in the Yelp app.  That's how we found Chabaa Thai.  3) If you're brave enough to wait the hour or so feasting on bread and water, enjoy!

Unfortunately, it was not worth the wait.\n\nThe service at the restaurant was really poor. Neither my husband nor I were greeted when we came in separately; we finally talked to the bartender who informed a waiter that we had a reservation. After we were seated and greeted by our waiter, we asked for a couple minutes to look over the menu. Unfortunately, \"a couple minutes\" translated to at least fifteen, and although we saw our waiter serve other tables, he did not come back to check on us for some time.\n\nOverall, we found the waiter's attitude somewhat strange. He would inch to the table with a dessert menu but not say anything, as though he were waiting for us to make the first move. Overall, we felt like we were outsiders at the restaurant, as if we didn't know the trick for ordering or getting good service there.\n\nThe food itself was good, but not better than our favorite Italian restaurants in town. My husband got the prosciutto tortellini, which was delicious but came in a very small portion, and I got the veal scallopini, which was good and adequately portioned. I ordered an incredibly disappointing glass of Moscato D'asti; where I've been served a wineglass at other restaurants, here I was served the equivalent of a double-shot and charged $8. And even though I rarely leave a restaurant without at least looking at the dessert menu, we ended up going without because we were both itching to leave.\n\nAs for the interior, a lot of people have been complimentary, but I didn't think it was anything beyond your typical Italian restaurant, Tuscan-style decor. One feature we didn't like was that as you enter the outer door, you're immediately hit with a curtain that you have to pass through to get to the restaurant. We weren't initially sure if the the restaurant was even open, and this contributed to the \"unwelcome\" vibe we felt overall.", "author": "Kristen L."}

If Tony Soprano and Donatella Versace were to get busy, they would probably choose the GM.  It's dark and over the top Cinderella's Castle meets the Godfather mansion.  The bartenders are generous pourers--my Dirty Goose practically overflowed from the glass and they are strong and stiff and dirtier than a stripper pole.  We commandeered the room upstairs for our 28th year 8th grade reunion (who DOES that?) but it was a fun time.  Them stairs are a little hard to negotiate though after the dirty martinis, so just be warned.  The prime rib was flavorful, a tad on the salty side and gigantic--almost covered the whole plate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-06", "description": "As a native San Franciscan, I've gotten quite spoiled by the diversity in this city.  There are so many choices in restaurants but I've always been curious about The Gold Mirror.  For many years, I kept passing by it when taking the L-Taraval on the way to work.  \n\nThere have been a number of closures of my favorite dine-in restaurants so my husband and I made our way here on an impromptu date night.\n\nLet me just say that the decor is very old-school yet doesn't look outdated or drab.  When I walked in, I was greeted very warmly by the hostess.  Considering we hadn't bothered to dress up, I wasn't sure what kind of reception we would experience.  It did not faze her one bit.\n\nIn fact, my husband and I were seated immediately at a good table.  From what I can tell, the set up of the room is a little tight at the center but at the perimeter, you won't get jostled or feel like you're in the way.\n\nOur server was the older of the two that seemed to be responsible for the floor. He also did not seemed fazed by our casual attire even though everyone around us was fairly dressed up.  He allowed us ample time to review the regular and special menu.  He didn't try to upsell us and in fact, only asked if we wanted wine to pair with our meal.  He didn't press us after we said no.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nGarlic Fried South American Prawns  $15\n\nHomemade Prosciutto Tortellini \"stuffed with San Daniele prosciutto in a cream sauce\"  $17\n\nVeal Milanese \"breaded cutlet fried in olive oil with small Sicilian capers, fresh sage, Gilroy garlic, lemon, and chardonnay served with rice and vegetables\"  $20\n\nCheesecake \"della Nonna topped with a fresh berry sauce\"  $7\n\nThe prawns were flavored quite well and could have probably been taken off the burner a bit earlier.  They were on the edge of being too dry but were very tasty.\n\nThe homemade prosciutto tortellini was my favorite item in this sitting.  I normally do not like cured meats but something about this called my name.  I'm glad I listened.  Not one hint of gristle, which is something that grosses me out when I find it, and the prosciutto was not overbearingly salty like it can tend to be.  Most of the time, I do not finish my meal but this was just the right amount and every morsel was delightful. In fact, I kept dipping my bread into the extra cream sauce that remained after eating the tortellini.  \n\n(By the way, that is some of the best complimentary bread I have been offered in a long time.)\n\nMy husband was not as impressed with the veal milanese.  He wasn't disappointed, just not impressed.  It was not what he was expecting but it wasn't bad.  It was \"nothing to write home about\".  The meat portion was sufficient but he felt that there could have been more vegetables on the plate or a hint of pasta to go with it to make it more substantial.  \n\nNow the cheesecake, we both loved.  It was definitely made with cream cheese but it was not heavy.  It was very fluffy and not to sweet, which is perfect for us.\n\nMost of all, as a person of color who often finds myself being treated as 'less than' by the people who are there to serve me,  I was extremely impressed that the staff who I encountered were all very classy and friendly.\n\nThere is a TV at the bar and they do play music but the volume is kept low-key.  It is one of the few places where my husband and I have not had to shout over the table in order to be heard.\n\nWhile I would not bring babies or children who are hard to keep contained to this restaurant, this is a good place to start if you are looking to teach your older children proper table etiquette.\n\nIf you look up, you will see the Gold Mirror that is the restaurant's namesake.\n\nWhen I get a moment this weekend, I will try to post photos.", "author": "Gabriela S."}

We enjoyed an antipasto plate, penne with Bolognese sauce, a house salad, and my entr\u00e9e was probably the best prime rib I'd ever had. There were lots of choices of entr\u00e9es, from salmon, eggplant Parmesan, veal Parmesan, and prime rib. From the food we tasted, I would definitely come back and try more of the menu items. We couldn't stick around for dessert and coffee, unfortunately, but I know that would have been a fantastic end to the meal. \n\nService:\nOutstanding.  We had one server taking care of us all night and he was fantastic. He kept up with all of our requests and nothing seems to faze him. This was pretty impressive given we had a party of about 22 people.  We really felt like we were being well taken care of and part of the Gold  Mirror family.\n\nVibe:\nComfortable and informal but also intimate even with a large group. Like you are in someone's home, but better. I'd probably enjoy sitting at the downstairs bar and could probably do it for hours. A great place to spend an evening. \n\nFamily-friendly:\nWe didn't have the children with us for this rehearsal dinner, but I would definitely bring my children here.

Called ahead on a Friday night and reserved our table. Greeted warmly and seated promptly, and got warm bread and water. So far so good.\n\nThe decor, though. I know they just remodeled, but holy cannoli, it is strange. Medieval Times meets Beauty and the Beast meets cocktail lounge?\n\nCalamari appetizer was very good -- sauteed rather than breaded and fried, and it was tasty and tender and the garlicky olive oil was  nice with bread.\n\nEntrees arrived a little while after the appetizer was cleared. I ordered meat ravioli with mushroom-tomato sauce: very good! I was thoroughly impressed. Probably about 5 large (palm-sized?) ravioli with very flavorful meat filling, and the pasta was nicely robust - not mushy or overcooked, very al dente.  The sauce was full of mushrooms and very tasty, and a nice balance of sauce to ravioli.  Mom ordered the cannelloni, which were kind of undramatic (surprising, since it's what the restaurant is known for) -- they were two logs of rolled pasta covered in a red and white sauce, on a shallow plate, no garnish or anything. The ravioli at least had a sprinkle of parsley on top. But she said it was good, and filling too. Dad had veal piccata, grandma had veal marsala I think. Both said they were good, looked like a nice plate of food. \n\nDessert was the Italian cream cake and the chilled zabaglione. Both good, very traditional.  The cream cake was like something you'd get at Dianda's, very authentically Italian-American. Rum, cream, sponge cake, something crunchy on the outside.\n\nAll in all, don't be scared of the frightened and negative Yelp reviews of this place. Just order what makes sense in a restaurant like this: something Italian-American, classic and uncomplicated, and go back in time a little bit.

A bit apprehensive because part of the neon sign was not functioning which made it look run down. It was a week night and we were seated immediately. A look around at the decor was a second warning. A weird combo of medieval meets New Jersey Italian. \n\nHowever, the service was excellent and the waiter was patient as we drank and waited for a friend. When he finally showed up we ordered and had time to catch up as the appetizers arrived. All of the warnings were forgotten as we ate. When the main courses arrived all discussion stopped as we dug in. The food was that good.\n\nGM is very old school. The waiter didn't tell us his name or try to be our friend.

Good little family owned joint serving up good food in a nice setting BUT they really dropped the ball on us the other night and here's why:\n\n1- Appetizers were crap in both quality and selection.  Surely they could have done better than the assortment of canned peppers, cappocola, olives and salami.\n\n2- Although my entree (veal parmigiana) was good, my colleague received his eggplant parmigiana almost 10 minutes after everybody else with no accompaniment!!  Not even a little scoop of rice, something that would have cost the house about 2 cents.  I actually had to ask one of the waiters to just bring him and his wife a plate as a favor to me.\n\n3- Dessert was a measly little scoop of artificially flavored vanilla ice cream with a stale lady finger on the side.  Surely they could have done a little better than that.  Why not wow all of us with a nice little square of tiramisu.  Yes, it would have cost the house a bit more but what a way to end a meal and impress 50 potential new customers.\n\nOverall, we had a great time but the decision has already been made not to return next year due to the above and a few other minor things that just added up.  In the end, the house made a very tidy profit from this party but in the long run, they blew it.\n\nIt will be a while before I return.

We'd heard about Gold Mirror the entire four decades of living in the Bay Area and finally a Saturday evening arrived when we had no other plans, were passing through the Parkside area, and were hungry for Italian food. I called -- no prob with table for 2 in 45 min. @7:00 p.m. (Gold Mirror is not on opentable.com/) Yes, it was crowded. It was also very noisy, which we kind of expected. \n\n7:09 p.m.: Husband: \"I'd like the prawns dore. But can you substitute something for the rice?\" Server: \"How about mashed potatoes?\" Husband: \"That would be great. I'll have that instead of the rice.\"  (We wanted the sand dabs, but were surprised that so early in the evening, that menu special was unavailable.)\n\n7:55 p.m.: Me: \"We've been waiting for a long time for our dinner. Do you have any idea when it will be ready?\" Server: \"I'll check\". (this, after he made sure ALL of the tables around us had their bottles of wine, drinks, and multiple plates of food; we had not ordered appetizers or drinks)\n\n8:05 p.m.: Food arrives. My eggplant parmigiana is a small piece on a plate, all alone. While I didn't expect a bowl of vegetables or anything on the side really, I did expect a serving appropriate to the size of plate. It was plunked down on the table in front of me, server not wearing a mitt, so right away I knew it wasn't very  hot. I was so hungry, I just sucked it up & dug in. Server: \"Sir, we'll bring your mashed potatoes separately.\" Husband: \"Thanks.\"\n\n8:15 p.m.: Husband (eating his prawns and vegetables, noticing there is also rice on his plate): \"I did not get the mashed potatoes.\" Server: \"I'll check.\" (remember: mashed potatoes were the SERVER'S idea, as opposed to baked potatoes or any other rice substitute).\n\n8:20 p.m.: Server: \"I'm sorry sir, the kitchen didn't have time to make mashed potatoes. We have people on vacation (blah, blah)\". Husband: \"Well, if I'd have known I couldn't have the mashed potatoes, I wouldn't have ordered the dore.\" He'd already started eating his dinner (of course, by then), so what to do?\n\nI'm sorry to say (and I've never before done this), we finished, then left quickly, leaving no tip. Really, really wanted to like this place, but what kind of service is this? No mashed potatoes is not a sin in the restaurant biz, but not communicating w/customers on a timely basis is close to it. We did notice that tables with large parties got excellent service, local people were chummy with the servers, etc., and that the alcohol flows freely. Not fitting into any of these categories, we just kind of lost out. Flavors were good. Kitchen and restrooms are clean. Street parking is convenient. But we will not be returning.

Most of the restaurants in the Parkside are casual, family-style type...this one actually has table cloths, an extensive wine list, chandeliers, and waiters who dress in tuxedos.  Very old school Italian, but food is OK good.\n\nWe shared the pan-fried calamari, which is listed on the menu as California calamari.  One word: Delicious!  It is pan-fried with garlic and green onions.  It is one of most tasty calamari dishes I ever had.  They don't give you \"dips\" to mask the taste like some places do.  It comes as is - delicious!!  A must have!\n\nFor entree, I ordered a pasta dish - spaghetti with fresh manila clams bordalese, fresh tomatoes and basil.  This was pretty good. Not great, but pretty good.  My husband ordered the Homemade Cannelloni, which is stuffed with veal, ricotta cheese, baked in a red and white sauce.  This I did not like.  I'm not sure if it's because of cheese or if the veal turned out to be a little tough.  \n\nWe ordered the Italian cream cake for dessert.  It is a chocolate sponge cake, layered with raspberry filling and mousse.  The cake tasted a little flaky and didn't have a great texture, but the combo of ingredients was good.\n\nThe prices are not cheap.  This is a classier place.   Appetizers go for about $10.  Pasta dishes about $15 and meat/seafood dishes go about $25.   Desserts are around $5.", "author": "Jannie Q."}

I had the capresse salad and the rosemary chicken. Lets start with the food, the food was good. It was very traditional Italian meal. The place is family owned, so I didn't doubt that they were more old school. The capresse salad I had, was with fresh tomatoes they were very crisp and juicy. The mozzarella was definitely freshly made. The entree of my meal was the rosemary chicken. The most juiciest and tastiest chicken ever. One of the best ones I have had. There was a abundant amount of sauce in every bite and the chicken fell off the bone into my mouth. The only thing I did not like was the fact that in the menu it said that the chicken came with rice and vegetables, however I did not receive the rice and had a small plate of vegetables which was on the side. I also had some Italian cake which was very fluffy and light after a good meal. It really tied the meal together. Now lets get to the service, the service was good and polite but very slow. Getting the waiters attention was difficult if we needed something and we waited a while to get the bill. In all the place is nice with good service, however they do need to fix the misunderstanding on the menus and say that the entree comes with a side of vegetables and no rice.", "author": "Svetlana T."}

Of all the years coming to the Gold Mirror, I've never had a bad meal. \n\nMy brother and his family now live up the block and my parents and I still meet at the Gold Mirror to celebrate birthdays. We start off with the Gold Mirror Antipasto. I usually order the Veal Piccata. My family will order the Local Petrale Meuniere or the Calamari Steak. They are accommodating to my picky young nieces who only want buttered noodles. Great deserts - I love the Tiramisu and Italian Cream Cake. The family has never complained about the food either.  \n\nYes, this is old school Italian with waiters wearing tuxedos. Where do you get that these days? Classy is the word that comes to mind. This is not the Olive Garden or Buca Di Beppo. I would say this place is somewhere between casual & dressy but not formal. Please do not come if you are wearing sandals and shorts. I've never seen the place empty. There are always local neighborhood old couples and families. \n\nBTW, they can accommodate big groups. There is extra party room upstairs. They open it up on really busy nights. I've eaten up there before. There is also a full bar to the right as you walk in.

But they have the usual Italian restaurant offerings...cheesecake, tiramisu, canolis. \n\nThe one thing I would change if I could is the parking! it's street parking and it's hit or miss, you'll either zoom right up or circle for 20 minutes!!!  Also, if you go during the day, the meters are only for an hour so bring some quarters with you!    It is right on the L Taraval Line...and 1 block from 19th Ave, you could catch the 28.

The pasta was fresh and simply delicious, however, my Mom had the special which was the fettucini with grilled chicken and wild mushrooms.

We both remembered the food as being much much better. My escargot appetizer, served out of their shells in a heavy sauce, was not that tasty.  I don't know what was in the green sauce, probably pesto, but it had an odd, unsatisfying taste, which overpowered the escargot.  I prefer them in their shells with garlic and butter.  I didn't think to ask before I ordered, wrongly was assuming that it would be prepared that way.\n\nMy entree, Prawns Dore, were pretty good, lots of seasoning, but too much butter or whatever sauce, made them taste oily and took away from their flavor.  My husband had prosciutto raviolis in a white sauce.  Basically, no flavor and doughy.  \n\nI don't even remember what I had for dessert - it was that unmemorable.\n\nThe check with one coffee and one glass of wine and tip, came to over $100.00.  Had it been a good meal, it would have been worth the price.\n\nWill not be going back or recommending it to friends ... NO, not worth the price and the food was not that good.   The service however, was good and our water glasses were constantly filled.\n\nWe were seated not far from the front door even other tables were available.

I remembered eating here several years ago, and figured it would be a good choice.\n\nWe received a nice greeting from a heavily Italian accented lady at the front door, and they were prepared to accommodate my dad in his wheel chair (I had given them a heads up).  Our ten guests trickled in and after we all settled in and had some cocktails and enjoyed the complimentary bruschetta, we began to order.  \n\nAmong the ten of us we managed to try quite a few items on the menu - the wonderful Caesar salad, a couple of the nightly specials - halibut in a piccata sauce (me) and the GIANT pork chop (Anton).  We also had the scampi, eggplant Parmesan, ravioli, salmon and some other entrees I can't recall.   The non-pasta entrees had sauteed chard as a side; nice and garlicky.  \n\nWe ended up the evening by ordering a selection of desserts - tiny cannoli, tiramisu and some other treats.  And of course Dad and Annabelle got their special desserts, complete with candle on top.\n\nThe only beef I have with GM is that the service is really really really slow, mainly because they only have a couple of waiters, and no food runners.  Meaning, that your waiter is the guy who brings our every single plate to your table with no assistance.  \n\nThat's just silly, considering that they had plenty of bussers who kept the tables clean.  I also think the fact that there was another large group (see David W's review - he was at the restaurant the same time we were) also caused the slowness.\n\nIn any event, a solid three stars and I'd definitely hit it again.", "author": ".Hon H."}

For the quality and quantity of food I believe it's well priced.  You can tell they put a lot of pride in their food and that they have a strong following of locals.  Many of the patrons are up there in age, so another plus of going here is feeling like a youngster at 40.

My parents took me here when I was a kid, and I was convinced that this place had the best minestrone and spaghetti w/meatballs in the world.  I still think the same way.\n\nOf course, as I matured, I tried other dishes, like that steak medallions with red-wine, the veal marsala, the chicken, and all the other great dishes.  And now that I'm an adult, I've come to appreciate the beer and wine selection too.  Funny, but the spaghetti and the minestrone are still my two favorite!!\n\nThe cooking overall has always been top-notch, and thoroughly consistent.  The food is hearty but never heavy feeling.  \nAs a kid, I used to make sure I would be seated next to the window so I could see into the kitchen.  The comfort, the care, the love in that cooking!\n\nEvery time I come I KNOW what to expect, and it's worth the money because the service is excellent.  Every waiter we've had (many different ones have come and gone through the years) has been super prompt with water and checking our status on everything.  The place is clean, cozy, intimate, and has that familiar, nostalgic feel.\n\nThe only weird thing was this past time I visited for my birthday celebration and the waiter kept trying to up-sell us on everything, and it was a bit overbearing.  At the end, he gave us his business cards offering to sell us snowboards at wholesale pricing.  Someone should make sure that guy is kept in check.  Other than that, he was thoroughly hilarious and kept us happy the whole night.\n\nI wouldn't call this place 100% Italian, because there are some obvious French influences as well (and especially escargot for you snail-eaters out there).\n\nRandom historical fact about Gold Mirror:\n\nOne time, a truck backed up into the entranceway and destroyed the place, but they took the opportunity to remodel.

They were stuffed with veal, chicken, and some other things topped with a seasoned tomato sauce. It was yum.\n\nThe service was really good. They always refilled our c ups of water, even before we were halfway done. We finished our bread appetizers and he asked us if we wanted more. What I love most about the service was when after we said we didn't want anymore, he came back a while more and asked if we were sure we didn't want any more bread. I call that service.\n\nWhen we got the bill, it was handwritten with like squiggles for writing.

I don't go out to eat much, particularly in the Taraval corridor.  Let's face it, there's not too much here that really tops what I can cook myself and I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food (I appreciate the irony). How satisfying is it to be able to find a really good restaurant that you can walk to in five minutes?\n\nThe test of a restaurant is how it is under pressure.  How about Christmas night for pressure?  How about your parents visiting?  How about I've never been here before?\nThey came through with flying colors.\n\nA 10 minute wait while the first seating cleared out, a table by the window and simply excellent food.  I love restaurants without pretense, that have been what they are and refuse to make you think they're anything else.  This is that place.\n\nA lovely wine list, really good bread. Something about the crackly crust...\n\nA tossed green salad or lentil soup.  Loved the little shrimps on the tossed green salad (I'm a sucker for little shrimps) and their vinaigrette is really nice. Okay, I'll admit it, I dunked the bread in the salad dressing. Sue me.\n\nWe love veal. They serve veal. They rock the veal.  Scallopini was fork tender (Mom's choice).  The sweetbreads, well, a month later and my Dad's still talking about them.  Veal Saltinbocca (my choice) rich, luscious, brilliant (the prosciutto makes it salty, if you're sensitive to such things). Their sauces are uniformly excellent.  I could actually taste the marsala and the brandy in the sauce. They don't over complicate things and I appreciate dishes that are simple, classic with attention to detail.   For me, the vegetable choice can be a real buzz-kill.  I love green beans, something I hardly ever see at restaurants.   Guess the veg: Green beans.  And perfectly cooked.\n\nThe service was really quite good, considering the place was packed. A little wait for more bread, but not that big a deal. \n\nAnother test of a restaurant is how much you look around at what other people have ordered and take mental notes for next time.  We did that a lot. The stuffed shrimp looked ridiculously good. It puzzles me is that they don't have their menu out front, which they should.\n\nWhy did it take me so long to stop in?  Lesson: Don't judge a restaurant by its neighbors.\n\nI wouldn't normally review a restaurant, because it is such a personal experience.  Everyone's got their own expectations and sometimes you just  go on an off night.  But the Gold Mirror deserved my registering on Yelp because they were there when I needed a great dinner on Christmas in my neighborhood. And I will be back for the Stuffed Shrimp.  And the Salmon.

All kidding aside, this doesn't account for too much of my rating anyways...so let's get to the food and service.\n\nFood - The Minestrone soup was actually served cold (not on purpose) to me. When they heated it up, there was not very much flavor, and I had to add a bit of salt. (I never add salt) The Calimari was average...and some pieces tasted burnt. At least they gave tentacles, which a lot of other restaurants neglect to serve. I had the Tortellini with Prosciutto and cream sauce. The Prosciutto was not so abundant and the cream sauce tasted like Costco brand sauce. Yuck. The portions were average size, but when done right, portions don't have to be large. Others in the party had Saltimboca and other Veal dishes. They claimed the dishes to be very bland. None of us had dessert since we had a nice cake to cut at home. Thank goodness.\n\nService - The servers were friendly, and attentive. The problem was that our main server seemed inexperienced with his delivery. Again, not that important. The busser had amazingly strong B.O. which bothered some people in the party, but I didn't pay attention.\n\nBar - Looked like a nice bar to have a few drinks before you start your night out, but didn't get a chance to enjoy it that night.\n\nOverall - This was the last place I would go to have Italian food.

The food is good, yes, and a star for the server who was very professional and charming. However last night was my last visit to the gold Mirror, ever. My disenchantment started about 2 years ago when I used to go once or twice a week after class and have a couple glassed of wine and an appetizer at the bar. Being a bartender myself it is common curtesy to occasionally top off a patron's glass of wine with an ounce or two or more so, comp a drink. Well there was a stop put to that, and I could see that there was a watchful eye prohibiting the bartenders discretion for customer appreciation. So I had not been in for quite a while when my husband and I had a taste for reliably delicious Italian food, so I thought we'd give it another shot and sit in the dining room. It was 7:45pm and only one other table finishing up. Why did it take 20 min to get bread? Both server and bus lady checked and said it wasn't up yet. O.K., then we order, shrimp and  scallop fettuccine for me, $24.00, and chicken piccata for the husband. Thirty-five minutes later, we were surprised to receive such small portions, especially for a pasta dish priced at $24.00. Four bites and 5 min later our plates were clean and we were still hungry. Seriously: four fork bites of pasta, 3-4 tiny shrimp and two small scallops. Chicken dish had 8 green beans and about 3 tablespoons of rice. We shared an appetizer which was a half avocado with a spoonful of crab in it: $15.00. We had one glass of house wine each, and needless to say when the $81.00 bill came we were not only hungry, but exasperated. I left $100, and 15 minutes later we were at home making tuna sandwiches. That is just wrong. We all work hard for our money. Nickel and diming your customers for a couple ounces of wine OR pasta is not going to \"make your numbers\" it is going to break them. It is pasta for God's sake, a low cost item that a diner should always have a little left over to take home with them, I am surprised that as established as The Gold Mirror is, this isn't acknowledged. As well we all know in this business that when folks have a good experience they share it with 2 or 3 others, but when they have a bad one, they tell 10 people. I just want to warn my friends so they aren't out 100 bucks of their hard earned money for absolutely nothing.", "author": "punk l."}

So it just happened we were in the neighborhood, we were getting hungry as dinnertime approached and my mom actually had their phone number in her purse so......\n\nMy Sis called in, asked if they had a table for 4 and voila......  \nWe were there, parked, within 2 minutes and in we go.....\n\nRight off the bat, we were greeted by the friendly host and seated.  The decor was very nice in there.  They certainly did a good job with the remodel.  \n\nThe food was tasty.  The portions seemed a little small to us but it still filled us up so nothing to complain about.  We all agreed that the best thing we had was the Italian Cream Cake for dessert.  We would go back to the restaurant just for that.  Though the rest of the fare we had was pretty good too.  And our waitress, Linda was also extremely friendly.  A great start to the New Year!!!!", "author": "Mark W."}

Having a place withing walking distance of my house where there's decent italian and waiters in tuxedos is pretty cool. \n\nI ordered the seafood pasta special, with white sauce. The waiter said that the pasta is homemade but I have serious doubts about it. It didn't have that \"doughyness\" that homemade pasta has. The seafood was 3 types of fish, salmon, sole and some other white fish I couldn't identify, clams and prawns. The fish was all a bit bland but the prawns and clams were good. The white sauce was really delicious though, with lots of garlic and just a bit of red pepper flakes.\n\nThe BF had the New York steak, which was odd because in the year and a half that we've been dating I've never seen him eat a steak. He asked for it medium well. It was juicy and flavorful. He said the potato tasted weird though. With him that could mean anything.\n\nFor dessert he had the tiramasu, and I had cream puffs. I also have a sneaking suspicion that the cream puffs are not home made, but they were tasty none the less. I liked the tiramasu much better.\n\nSince it's 2 blocks away, I'm sure we'll be back. I'll have to try the lasagne next time", "author": "Melanie V."}

Our dinner was not served until a little after 7:30pm.  Over an hour wait at the table for our food.  We also ordered several bottles of wine.  I believe when a restaurant has you wait over one hour for your food \"after you have ordered\" is unacceptable.   Our waiter did not even acknowledge the wait, or apologize.  We inquired  why it was taking so long.   The service was the worst.  I think that the least they could have done,  was to comp one bottle of wine for us,  that would have been a nice gesture.  How do you keep someone waiting for over an hour for their meal?  That is really bad!!!!   The food was okay.   With our dinner came about 3 spoonfuls of rice and 4 green beans.  For the price you pay,  I would expect a little more rice and veggies... just saying.... can't be that expensive for them to add more rice and veggies.  Why would an Italian restaurant serve a side of rice and vegetables instead of  a side of pasta?  That makes more sense.   When asked if we could have a side of pasta instead of rice,  they said it comes with rice.   I will not go back,   there are so many more restaurants that have better food and better service,  why go here???  Never again.....", "author": "Deborah M."}

I recommend the spaghetti with clams. But next time I want to try the seafood! Their dessert selection is also really good! I recommend the cheesecake with chocolate and raspberry sauce and/or the spumoni!  The wine selection is also very extensive and they have a fully stocked bar that can make most cocktails. The servers are also very friendly and attentive. My water was never empty and empty dishes were not left out on our table for long. Also the servers came by quite frequently to make sure everything was ok, even though, they were busy!", "author": "Mai L."}

The canaloni is lovely as well - really tasty.  I really have no complaints about this place.  Oh, and the people who said that it was too expensive are nuts.  This is a good moderately priced Italian place with a good wine selection and quality food.", "author": "samantha D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-12-21", "description": "This is my favorite old-school Italian restaurant in SF.  It is at least as good as any of the places in North Beach.  They were closed for about a year after a truck smashed into the building and destroyed the place, but now it's better than ever.  It isn't on the menu anymore, but you can still order a chicken liver entree.  For lover's of this dish, this is the place to go.  They have an excellent Ceasar with their own slightly different take on it.  Those looking for yupscale new-age fusion Italian food should look elsewhere.  This is a place Tony Soprano would love.", "author": "Anonymou S."}

There's an old-school Italian charm to it - the kind of place you'd take your grandma for Sunday dinner. The food was fairly decent - I got the bolognese with gigantic meatballs, which were incredible tender and moist. But, I'm always a little wary of Italian places that serve butter with their bread, but eh, I'll overlook it. I don't know that I'd come back often (prices seem a bit inflated), but when I have a hankering for giant meatballs, I'll definitely come here.", "author": "Lemon S."}

I have always enjoyed it, and although I have lived in Walnut Creek for many years I occasionally return to the old neighborhood for a meal at the Gold Mirror, which has been operated by the same family for generations.  My brother, who now lives in Washington State, was in town working the Fancy Food Show and we decided to go there as he too had fond memories of it.  This place is true to its core - a real unpretentious San Francisco Italian restaurant that serves traditional and plentiful food at a fair price.  The very retro dining room and bar is comfortable and clean.  The wait staff - all dressed in well-worn tuxedos is attentive and clearly under the watchful eye of Mama Gold Mirror who circulates through the dining room insuring everything is running according to her wishes.   We made a reservation by phone (I do not think they take them on-line) and our table was available when we arrived.  My wife joined us so there were three of us for dinner.  We decided to take our time and enjoy a drink at our table before ordering and although the restaurant was filling fast (every table was full by the time we ordered) we were not pressured to turn-the-table.  We shared fried calamari with garlic to start and it was very tasty.  I ordered Veal Parmesan and I think the recipe was the one they used 50 years ago.  If you are interested in a light, low-calorie, low-fat meal, do not order this dish.  On the other hand, I knew what I was getting into - the Veal was done right and I enjoyed it.  My brother (who is quite a foodie) went for the Lasagna and he thought it was excellent; in fact after eating at three other rather upscale San Francisco restaurants that week, he told me that the meal at the Gold Mirror was the best of the bunch.  I will be back in the old neighborhood and will eat at the Gold Mirror again.  I hope it never changes - they do not make them like this any more.", "author": "David P."}

Home made pasta they serve is way better than going to a place that serves you the frozen crap and says fresh. Their desserts are worth having, even if you are full. Look, the food is ordinary. It isn't hella good, and it isn't bad. But the service is excellent. Everyone there is very courteous and very friendly..which makes for an overall good night out.", "author": "DT l."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-12-01", "description": "Well, the space is nice, and it has some old world charm.  The bartender was nice, and I felt like this just might be a warm, inviting place to go to pretty often. But then, the experience that we had with our waiter was really poor. Distilled down to one word, it'd have to be 'disrespectful'. When he asked if we had any questions about the wine list and I responded that we'd probably just choose among the wines by the glass, he turned away without another word and walked off. He didn't tell us the specials of the night until we'd already been seated for fifteen minutes. The second I finished giving him the food order, he turned around and left, even though I had the wine list open in front of me. He paid attention to seemingly all of his other tables while we sat there waiting for our check for another fifteen minutes. He was not gracious, not personable, and seemed to only do the very minimum required. I can't help but think that if we had another waiter, our overall dining experience might have been much better. We might go back, but no time soon. Too many other places to go where you don't have to put up with that kind of behavior. The food, for what it's worth, was middle-of-the-road (including the cannelloni).", "author": "Steve R."}

When I got there I was confused. The restaurant says, \"I'm an old-timer Italian restaurant.\" There are strange red plastic lighting around the bar, from some some long ago revamp. There are gaudy chandeliers, and yes some 2/3D stagecoach on the wall with a picture of a man (chef?) standing inside. The evident wine selection denotes class and sophistication. What really  infers a \"good-old Italian place\" are the wait staff with actual Tuxedos! With all that I expected Mom-quality food. Alas I was disappointed. I got Minestrone and Veal Parmesan. Minestrone was good, but nothing to write home about. The Veal was soft and the flavor was well balanced, yet kinda bland. I think I expected the food to match the environment. It does not. It's obvious that this place has been here a while, and judging from the food:  times change.", "author": "Redd J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-05-03", "description": "I had lunch here the other day, very good, classic, old school Italian.  I had the special gnoochi Sorentina.  They are homemade and SOOO good, the way gnoochi should be- light and tasty, not chewy or heavy like store bought or frozen.  The service was great and the warm french bread, so good, I ate the whole basket-full.  The food is classic, fresh and healthy.  Come here to get full, but not for surprises.  If you like snobby food, this is not the place for you.  This is a classic place and there are few left like it!   A great spot to take your parents or an aunt, that sort of place.", "author": "Anna Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-25", "description": "Been going to the Gold Mirror for over 35 years, and in all those times I have never had a bad meal.  The DeGrande family has been there all those years, and although Guiseppe has retired (although he still comes back to help out once in a while), his sons Dominic and Roberto carry on in the family tradition.  The menu has been only slightly modified from years past, but only for the better.  We have had just about every entree on the menu (plus the specials which are not on the menu, but the waiters describe them very well) and have our favorites, but almost any entree would be allright with us.  Lunch is served M-F, and the restaurant caters to the seniors in the area who still love the food but perhaps don't like going out at night any more.  Worth a trip to the Parkside; parking can be dicey, but you can almost always find a space.  If you long for the \"old school\" Italian restaurants that used to be in North Beach, the Gold Mirror is the place to go!!", "author": "Jim and Judy D."}
