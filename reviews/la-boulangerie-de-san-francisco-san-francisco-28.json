I've had their almond one and their ham and cheese one and both are good, but not something I would get on a normal basis (they are def not good for you). \n\nOne grip- don't come here for coffee. They give you a huge glass bottle of iced coffee with a tiny cup of ice if you ask for it. Then, you're stuck with a half empty iced coffee and a tiny plastic cup with a straw that's too big for it.

In fact, I think I could have made something similar in my own kitchen... Customer service was also a bit appalling.\n\nLet me tell you about my first (and probably last) experience here. I came to La Boulange to meet with a couple of friends after finishing a half marathon. I was starving, no doubt. I knew it would take me a little bit of time to walk there, so I asked my friend to order me the omelet on the menu (I looked up the menu beforehand) without ham. I arrived around 10-15 minutes after my friend finished ordering for me and honestly expected to sit down and have my food brought very quickly to me to satiate my insane hunger at the time... and unfortunately, I had to sit there while my friends finished eating their food and wound up waiting an additional 30 minutes before receiving my omelet. And....... when I got my omelet, low and behold, there was ham!!! I finally got my food and then found out that I couldn't even eat it!\n\nI immediately took the omelet back to the kitchen and told them about the mistake. They told me that they were sorry and would get right on making a new omelet. So I'm waiting and waiting, so anxiously, for my correctly made omelet. I am ravenous now. 5 minutes pass... 10 minutes pass... 15 minutes pass.... still no omelet in front of me. I decide to go pester the kitchen again... and guess what? THEY FORGOT! The lady told me that she'd be right on it, and I finally got my food 5 minutes later. Totally unacceptable. I think I finished the omelet in a minute because I was so hungry. \n\nThe omelet itself was pretty good, but if I had all the ingredients, I think I could have made the same thing - nothing super special. Serving size was small, especially for the price, and because of that, I don't think my brunch meal was worth it at all.\n\nMy friends said that the pastries here were better, so maybe go for those if you somehow find yourself here. The coffee drinks also look pretty unique since they're served in bowls.

(well, it's been a while now, but I'm still just as excited as I was when the news first broke). Though the name has changed to the new and improved \"La Boulangerie de San Francisco\", the food remains the same- which is definitely a good thing. There was a lot of drama surrounding the 2012 selling of the original La Boulange. San Francisco residents we're legitimately upset at the news, because it meant one of the staples of this city was disappearing, and for a pretty confusing reason.\n\nThe return of La Boulanerie was a pleasant and welcoming surprise. There was a realization by the owner of this popular chain that it's a needed part of daily life for so many people. Coming back to the Union location today for the first time since it's re-birth, I have to say that I feel the same way. The croissants are just as good, the open face sandwiches are as delicious as ever (see picture below), and the service still very quick.\n\nDuring my visit, I opted for the Hummus sandwich with avocado, cucumbers and tomatoes. What a great decision that was! I've been a long time fan of this chain and have tried nearly everything on the menu, but today was a first, since I would typically go for protein based options. The hummus was very tasty- and I know my hummus! The addition of fresh cucumbers and tomatoes was perfect. It's a dish I highly recommend if you're looking for something light but filling.\n\nFinal verdict: La Boulange was more than just your average run-of-the-mill spot to get coffee, lunch and pastries. It was a staple of San Francisco where people came together to talk and socialize. With the return of La Boulagerie, that same feeling is back, and people are able to once again return to their regular routine.", "author": "Alex B."}

The first time around they gave her the omelet with ham. Naturally she returned it and they were going to make her another one without ham like she had asked for.

The pastries at this La Boulangerie are good in comparison to others (I've been to many in this chain famously owned by SBux).  They managed to warm my chocolate croissant just right and my friend's apple turnover was also reported to be fresh- which is definitely more than what you could say for many of their sister storefronts.\n\nNow the bad.  I could talk about how I had to clean my own table and furnish that table with chairs myself or the fact that it was overpriced and packed with people to the point of chaotic, but that's not the main problem for me.  This place has been issued a WEAK COFFEE ALERT.  Oh yes, my pet peeve.  And who wouldn't be peeved?  My friend ordered an espresso.  I took a look at it and- having had tens or hundreds of espressos at various La Boulangerie locations, I could tell it was not right.  It was about a third in quantity of what you would expect from a single espresso, and yet about as dark.  So skimping basically.  I took it back.  The barista told me this is a 'fixed amount'.  I said 'fix it'.  The manager came over in bright red lips, explaining that was already a 'long espresso' (all of a sudden, not the fixed amount).  She said she could have the barista (I really cannot call her that with a straight face) pull two shots through one.  I said, 'try it'.  As you can expect what came out was something like a cup of black coffee (although in the quantity of an espresso shot), and with a burnt-chalk aroma and taste.  As you could have guessed, she could not drink it.  We left it on the table.\n\nNow for my black coffee.  I ordered a small cup of coffee as I have at many La Boulangerie locations.  Usually I find the black coffee from this establishment to be passable, although it took a sharp nose-dive after the SBux buyout.  I asked once and they responded:\n\nIt's an 'SBux blend' for the La Boulangerie chain.  Read:  the old one was too good and too expensive to produce.  Corners were cut and we charred some of our extra beans.  Voila!  A new specialty French roast!  Some one got a promotion for that.  Take it away.  \n\nBut back to this location on Union St., in the heart of the Marina district of San Francisco.  This coffee, even by humble comparisons, was extremely weak.  It literally tasted like hot water. I tried cinnamon.  Now it was hot water with cinnamon.  This is the first time I could not finish- or even really begin- to drink a black coffee from La Boulangerie. We left it on the table.\n\nWe went there for the location, but left for the unpleasant atmosphere and, worst of all, extremely unsatisfactory coffee.  They left with my money.", "author": "Marc M."}

One piece of advice, once you walk-in, especially if you are doing a Sat brunch (and you are not doing it alone, obviously) - split the party and have others go do some table stalking - they don't take reservations, and if everyone waits in-line to order - you will definitely be struggling for a table.  Best to divide and conquer! Table turnover is good - we waited for about ~10mins, not too bad for a Saturday.  \n\nEverything looked excellent - I did the scrambled egg sandwich and it was made to perfection!  Tasted the egg frittata, it was also really good.  Everything was fresh and food got delivered to the table warm - which for eggs, as all you Yelpers know - makes a huge difference.  \n\nThe service in general was great!  The barista unfortunately seemed completely frazzled and could not handle the crowds.

The gf had the french toast which was made with bread that was more like a custard with a flour crust.\n\nI don't know if liked it or not, but it was interesting.\n\nCoffee has free refills if you head back to the counter.\n\nThe place was busy, but thankfully we found seats outside so that the dog wouldn't have to be left tied to the lamppost.", "author": "Johnny C."}

They have open faced sandwiches which being a health nut, I love, because I am ingesting less carbs. I love their pastries too. They have sweet and salty ones, and I can always find something to satisfy my cravings. I love their tarts and chocolate croissants. However, I am docking this place a star because this place is a little pricey and also doesn't have wifi. Also, the food is a little heavy, as pastries and sandwiched usually are.", "author": "Jennifer D."}

But it was good. \n\nI got a smoked salmon salad, white bean cup of soup, and two macroons. Holy crap, it was $$. The smoked salmon salad had some yummy candied walnuts which I enjoyed. The salmon itself was \"meh.\" It was okay, nothing to brag about. I thought the white bean soup was delicious and hearty, especially for the cold SF night it turned out to be. \n\nUsually their bread is pretty good, but since I came around 4:30ish, it tasted a bit old. But the complementary bar or nutella, jams, jellies, butter, pickles, and etc made it that much better.  \n\nThe atmosphere is easy, calming, and great to read a book or paper by yourself  during breakfast or lunch.", "author": "anita h."}

So, today, while waiting for me, he availed himself of the breakfast consisting of yogurt, fruit and granola. He reported that this example was \"stellar\". He's picky, so I know off the top of my head that this means no bananas, or fruit past its' prime, and the yogurt must have been good quality.\n\nMy selection later on was not that great. I ordered a cheese and tomato Crocque Monsieur and it was so-so at best. The woman working behind the counter (who was not too keen on customer service) seemed genuinely put out that I would want it warm. She huffed and puffed all the way to the grill and then just shoved it into a wax-paper bag (thus causing all the cheese  to stick to the paper. Having lived in Paris where rudeness is an art form, this just did not cut it. And, she wasn't French. As if that's an excuse anyway...\n\nSo, next time I find myself in this neck o' the woods, I will quite happily  take a \"Pass\" for this spot, and focus my energies to a friendlier place.  You'll have to check it out for yourselves: Stuart had a fine time, so maybe it's hit or miss. Apparently, I missed.", "author": "Suzanne F."}

Usually bakeries do not get me overly excited - I am a chocolate, not a sugar, kind of guy.  Here I will make an exception for Almond Croissants.  \n\nIncredible almond flavor with oozing almond paste goodness shining through the flaky, light croissant exterior.  I recommend a strong cup of black coffee, 1 (or more) of these, and a good book.  The flavors, the sugar, and the caffeine will turn even the most retreaded thriller-wannabe into the next Preston & Child classic.  Love it.", "author": "Patrick G."}

With short lines this is a great stop for my employee and myself when we are in need of a quick bite and a coffee. With soy milk available without having to ask and wait around for it is refreshing. \nThey have bites to eat that are not huge overly sized items. With medium prices I love that I can come again and again.", "author": "Julia G."}

So grab a table - fast!  But the food has been good... service was more of a production line since there were so many people, but it seemed efficient enough.  The first time I had a sandwich with smoked salmon... mm!!!  The last time I had a quiche lorraine which was alright... they didn't offer to heat it up and at room temperature, it was just ok.  But I also had a sticky bun for the road and boy was it good!  Oh and I don't know if it was just for Valentine's Day but there were some delicious looking red velvet cupcakes on display... actually, their whole dessert display, while small, looked scrumptious.  But I didn't get anything... maybe next time!", "author": "Christine N."}

It gets really crowded but being able to stand in line to order your food helps out a bit.  They have a huge staff behind the counter and bustling between the tables and they're all very friendly and helpful.  \n\nI enjoyed the croissant sandwich with thick-cut bacon, egg, cheese, and tomatoes.  It also came with a side of fresh fruit that went perfectly with the sandwich.  The husband had the open-faced lox sandwich and it was a nice combination of crusty bread topped with cream cheese, cucumber, lox, and capers.  It came with a side salad that made for a satisfying meal as well.  Their coffee is good and will provide you with free refills at the counter.  \n\nThis place is a great place to have Sunday brunch with a few friends.  Take a table inside with the crowd or snag one of their 2 or 3 tables outside.  Just arrive early to avoid a long line.", "author": "Nina L."}

The food is great, very reasonably priced, the staff friendly.  The breakfast sandwiches, pastries and lunchtime salads are my favorite--reliably hearty portions.  What you see is what you get.  It is cafeteria style-order, pay, take your number to your table.  The line moves pretty quickly and I have never waited more than 10 minutes.  I think they have a leg up on La Boulangerie on Union, Columbus, or Strawberry Village.", "author": "Rita G."}
