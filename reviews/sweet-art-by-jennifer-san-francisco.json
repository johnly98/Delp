I needed a cake maker for my girls first birthday party. Sure, I could have gone to Safeway or Costco, but this was THE big birthday, and outside of their quincenara, the motto was \"go big or go home\".\n\nHowever, seeing as though we are basic people with basic means (and SF being super expensive in general), we decided to go with a speciality cake that was homemade. Thank goodness for yelp reviews. I checked out some by Jennifer, and figured that she would be the best option (especially given that the birthday was fast approaching).\n\nJennifer was very responsive, and I was able to provide her with an sample photo of what I was looking for. She let me customize the cake to my liking as well, which I loved. I was able to pick the cake up a couple days before the party, which was very convenient for me. I didn't know what to expect (I was just hoping that the cake turned out well), but Jennifer definitely hasions. The cake looked amazing and was exactly we were looking for. Best of all: the cake was so delicious and moist! Everyone loved it and I barely got a slice of it, which is always a great sign.\n\nJennifer is the real deal, and I have been recommending her ever since. Best of all, she has an electronic pay system, which makes it very easy to pay. Definitely looking forward to planning another event just so I can eat cake (pub intended).", "author": "Tracy T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-30", "description": "After a few unresponsive photo cake providers such as the Cake G***** (rhymes with mallory), we were fortunate to find Jennifer.\n\nIt's surprising really how difficult it is to find someone who can do a photo cake. (Don't waste your time searching for \"photo cake\" on google and go to these rip off cake shops that are making cakes out of a storefront that looks more like a makeshift painters studio.)\n\nWe ordered a quarter sheet photo cake for a kid's birthday party from Jennifer and it was excellent. It was a standard vanilla cake and it was also not overly sweet which is exactly what we wanted. Definitely our first choice going forward. And a great value.\n\nBe aware however, that as an individual business owner you need to plan ahead and realize that you are getting an excellent value because she's not some massive operation. Make sure to confirm by phone.\n\nIf you are super price sensitive and put last minute convenience over quality then go to Costco (sorry but sort of like Blondie's pizza, there's only so much cheap, high volume, I can tolerate) If you aren't a procrastinator and appreciate someone who cares about the product and delivers high quality at a reasonable price, then Jennifer is for you.", "author": "Yohdaddy M."}

For our first meeting she invited us to her home just one neighborhood over from ours. She sent us her flavor menu ahead of time and made us three tasting mini cakes with our choice of cake flavor, filling, and icing combos - amazing! She was professional and also took time to get to know us and our preferences. We loved all the cakes but ultimately chose the marble cake with cream cheese filling and fondant icing. It was delicious and we got so many compliments from our guests later! Plus, Jennifer very kindly helped me decide on colors for the cake and let us use her beautiful silver vintage cake stand for the event!

Her presentation was excellent and the cherry tart just drew me in close with their beautiful rock sugar sugar. Her friendly disposition was as equally sweet and her answers to my many questions were detailed and patient-MAD KUDOS to anyone who can put up with my cupcake questions. \n\nDid I mention she sells really adorable cupcakes? I couldn't carry it with all the other stuff I had in my arms so I had to say goodbye to the cute chocolate ones and the buttercream ones-so hard! I did manage to get a brownie since she individually wraps her brownies and they were soft and really chocolaty. \n\nI could come back for her cherry tart and maybe get an apple or apricot next time. The flakey pastry was evenly balanced with the filling and I normally automatically get drawn to a cup of coffee but not this time.

The cake made a beautiful centerpiece for the occasion.\n\nAnd how did the cake taste? My goodness, it was good!  I chose the marble cake with strawberries and chocolate filling--I wasn't sure if this would turn out well, given that I've never had that flavor combination before, but it tasted divine.  The cake was moist, spongey, and not too dense, the chocolate filling had savory chunks of chocolate in it, and the strawberries were fresh.  Even the fondant icing was good!  My guests, even the ones that bake themselves, really enjoyed the cake.\n\nI was worried about the small two-tiered cake being enough for 45 people, but it turned out to being more than sufficient, and everyone who loved the cake was able to have seconds, if they wanted.\n\nI would definitely recommend Jennifer's cakes to anyone--she's a baking goddess!", "author": "Audacity L."}

After reading the reviews, I gave her a call and I knew I'd found the woman who would bake my wedding cake.  \n\nShe meets clients in her home and rents space in a commercial kitchen for her baking.  During our phone calls, we discussed flavors we wanted to taste and set up a time to swing by.  When my fiance and I arrived at her home, we were greeted so warmly and led to the living room.  We talked about our visions, budgets, reviewed her portfolio, and even snuggled with her sweet cat!\n\nShe had made 3 small cakes for us to take home and try.  All were good but nothing was quite the winning combination.  When I called her to ask if she wouldn't mind letting us try a few other options, she said it was no problem at all.  \n\nWe decided to do a small tier cake for the traditional cake cutting and pictures.  We did marbled cake, mocha filling, and chocolate ganache covered.  To die for!!!  Our colors were chocolate brown, accented with gold, and she added the gold ribbon on each of the layers for us.  \n\nThen, as a cost saving measure and for ease of service, we also did a sheet cake.  For this, we chose lemon cake, raspberry filling, and white buttercream frosting.  The raspberry filling was so amazing and almost wound up in the tier cake as well!  This combination was so wonderful and was great on a warm June afternoon.  Light and delicious, and a great option in addition to our rich chocolate.\n\nJennifer's service is so warm and wonderful.  The cake is delicious.  And the price is absolutely affordable.  When other bakers are quoting $10++ per serving for a wedding cake, tell them thank you very much, hang up the phone, and call Jennifer.  The quality and value cannot be matched.\n\nThanks, Jennifer!", "author": "Melissa Q."}

I'm a big amateur baker, hate fondant, and had it been possible, would have much preferred to bake my own wedding cake for my day, but I knew better. We tried Susie Cakes out, which is a nice go-to for basic, overpriced and INSANELY sweet desserts, but something about it didn't sit quite right with us. We didn't need a fancy fondant design and didn't want to spend $8-$10 per serving on cake that is all-too-often pushed aside or ignored by wedding guests. I saw reviews for Jennifer on Yelp and decided to give her a try. Be forewarned: if you do NOT like phone conversations and expect super fast email replies from vendors, she isn't your gal. But if you don't mind picking up the phone to confirm details with a vendor, I wouldn't hesitate! We met Jennifer at her house for a casual tasting. She rents out a professional kitchen space to bake cakes for events, so don't worry about any sanitary concerns. Her cakes were light and not overly sweet, and we absolutely loved what we tasted. Her prices are BY FAR some of the most fair I've ever come across for professional cakes. She delivered the cake within a specified time window and let us borrow a drop dead gorgeous silver cake stand at no extra charge. We chose chocolate cake with italian rum custard filling and yellow cake with fresh strawberries/bananas in whipped cream filling, both with a vanilla buttercream. It was to die for.

Jennifer is very friendly and accommodating.  I've called in a few last minute requests and she always comes through.  She's also very helpful with custom requests/designs on what will work.", "author": "Garrett H."}

Not only did Jennifer come through on time, but it had a picture of the birthday boy on it and was the most delicious cake I ever had.
