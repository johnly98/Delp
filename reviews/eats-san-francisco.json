However, I did take a break from going back after the time prior to last because the food was very disappointing; but they have redeemed themselves. There is always ALWAYS a long wait. I have never waited shorter than 20 minutes for a table. However, now you are able to put your name on the waitlist through Yelp, which is very helpful. \n\nI enjoy having the spinach and portabella mushroom benedict half ben ($8.50) and the strawberry lemonade ($4.25). The benedict half ben is one egg benedict rather than 2. It comes with saut\u00e9ed spinach and portabella topped with a poached egg and their home made hollandaise sauce served on top of an English muffin, and a choice of salad or potatoes. And their strawberry lemonade is sweet, refreshing and YUM. However, if you're looking for a semi-sweet beverage to go with your meal, this is not for you.  \n\nAlthough the wait to be seated may take a long time, the waiters are very nice, the restaurant is kept clean, and the food is delicious and comes out fairly quickly.

I ordered one blueberry pancake and eggs Benedict. I really enjoyed this version of eggs Benedict because they had tomatoes on it, which takes away the heaviness of this dish because of the eggs and hollandaise sauce. Also, their sauce tastes very different from that of other places: it has strong hints of miso, which is interesting. I'm so glad the ham was not salty. The Benedict came with a generous portion of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes, lightly marinated with balsamic vinegar. I strongly recommend the blueberry pancakes!! The berry pieces were fresh and juicy. The pancake was cooked just to the right fluffiness!! \n\nFor a weekend brunch, I was fifth in line for a party of two, but we were seated within five minutes (could have just been luck). The restaurant is an open kitchen format, but you did not feel the greasiness! Eats made excellent use of their limited space, stocking a corner with a large inventory of prosecco.

Again, having an appointment in the neighborhood on a weekday morning, we changed it up by trying another new (for us) breakfast place.  We found metered parking a half block away.  After a short wait, we were seated at a two top near the kitchen.  The restaurant was full but not overly bustling likely because it was a weekday.  After we were given menus, it took a few glances at the Yelp listing and peeks at the menu before I decided on my breakfast.  \n\nContrary to my usual pattern, I did NOT order corned beef hash (was it on the menu?, there was a pork hash) and instead ordered the chicken and waffles (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wXPh9hPtS6KL7GGf6lqbXQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  The description is what sold me:  Panko crusted all natural chicken, mushroom gravy (yes, sold!), honey butter, powder sugar.  The chicken was crispy and boneless, yet not dry... even if it was, the mushroom gravy, sigh.  The waffles had a nice texture, not overly crisp and the syrup was not too sweet striking a great balance between savory and sweet.  \n\nService was good and not overbearing.  Drink glasses were refilled and empty plates and dirty utensils removed promptly.  In a word, efficient.  Don't expect long explanations or chit chat conversations with your waiter or waitress as they are briskly meeting the needs of all diners.

Now, you can add yourself to the waitlist through Yelp and it'll give you a time that you should be there and how many people are ahead of you. It updates as people are seated as well, which is so convenient for those of us who live in the neighborhood just walking distance from Eats! My boyfriend and I only waited at the restaurant for 10-15 mins tops, where as before this we'd wait up to an hour to get seated! Huge improvement, thank you Eats! \n\nOnto the food, which is excellent! We always get the two egg special with toast and potatoes, as well as sausage which is extra $$$ but worth it! This time, I decided to get a waffle as a side because I was craving some sweet to my savory, and it did not disappoint. Downside, it was tiny! I literally ate it in 4 bites! So considering the size, the price was steep, unlike the two egg special which I find a little more reasonable! Drinks wise - they only have regular coffee, no fancy lattes or cappuccinos for all you fancy coffee drinkers so keep that in mind! They do have mimosas as well, although I'm not sure if they have a formal boozy brunch. \n\nService was great - the servers were attentive making sure we always had coffee and water refilled but weren't chatty as they were busy (which we appreciated!)

Walk by on any morning or afternoon and you'll probably see people waiting outside, desperately trying to pass time until one of the servers calls their name when a table is ready. To my surprise, I recently discovered that there was another one of these popular restaurants in the unsuspecting Inner Richmond.\n\nRelax, the wait never gets as long as it does for Plow. But you'll be greeted with a short wait even if you come around noon on a weekday. You can kill time on the conveniently placed bench right outside -- our wait couldn't have been more than ten minutes. We had the two eggs special (over easy) with a salad, the spinach portabella benedicts with potatoes, a half order of the berries and creme waffles, and a single banana chocolate pancake. \n\nWhat I like the most about Eats is its homey, laidback ambiance. Find yourself unable to decide what to order, as I did? No worries, just get a berries and creme waffle and a banana chocolate pancake. It'll add up to $11.50, which is pretty standard for a brunch dish in the city, but I was surprised by the large portion size for that price! If I'm being honest, I don't usually care for sweet breakfast foods, but I was pleasantly sated after I had devoured both dishes.\n\nWhile the service isn't overly friendly because of how busy it usually is, the servers do their best. One of the servers non-creepily lingered behind our table (after our dishes had been cleared) while we were putting our coats back on so she could say the customary parting words -- \"thanks, hope to see you again soon\" -- which I thought was a really nice touch, staying true to the local vibe of Eats. I can tell why this is a neighborhood favorite, but I'd definitely only try to swing by on a weekday morning next time.", "author": "Amy C."}

Our ham and leek omelette was nice and leeky but missing the gruyere component or it was so subtle that I couldn't taste it. I love that they put whole garlic cloves with the potatoes.

Second time, different table same thing.  3rd time and last time same thing.\n\nAntisocial you say? Well eating breakfast, groggy, tired, early in the AM I'm not in the mood to \"meet new people\" or stir up \"small talk\" with people who don't really want to talk with us either.  It's so uncomfortable I could care less or even remember what the food taste like.  Just wanted to eat and get away each time.\n\nI live one block away so it's frustrating to have a top breakfast place that forces such an uncomfortable experience especially after waiting in line/list for a long time.  \n\nSaw someone busted the windows out recently and they are boarded up.

When I walked in there was no line, and I was seated immediately at one of the front tables next to the window (indoors).  Then after being there with coffee and waiting for food, the waitress randomly asks if it's okay to move me.  I said sure, but then I realized she took everything on the table to the back corner of the restaurant.  I didn't want to be rude so I just went with it.  She didn't say why I was being moved, I wasn't being disruptive or ask to move.  Then soon after being seated at the new table I see two men being seated at the table I was originally at.  Did they ask for the table specifically or did she decide to put them there?  I honestly don't understand why, they came in after I did.  The food and drinks were good, I like how they serve refills but this situation made me feel unwelcome or low priority in the restaurant.

The hollandaise was perfectly tart and creamy, and the muffin was extremely fresh, with an almost brioche-like taste!  The Italian sausage was split lengthwise and grilled on the flat top - nice flavor but not nearly enough kick to be called \"spicy.\"  Oh and don't forget the potatoes - crispy exterior, exploding with herbaceous flavor courtesy of the whole roasted garlic cloves and fresh sprigs of thyme.\n\nCan't wait to go back and explore the menu further.

Especially if you eat Eats' as frequently as I do.\n\nWhat makes this a great dining option? First, it is locally owned. Great diverse menu for breakfast and brunch options. I am more of a one trick pony, choosing to stay within a narrowly proscribed set of selections, namely the side waffle and two eggs scrambled (hard). And then there are the oatmeal, blueberry pancakes, cowboy burrito and huevos rancheros. \n\nFriendly service, clean environment and fairly reasonable prices (if you live in SF you really no right to complain about the cost of a meal as you are already choosing to live in a city with the highest rents). \n\nA few of the downsides would be access: Street parking on 2nd and Clement streets are very difficult to find, so you might consider public transit or a taxi. Can't dine outdoors due to the weather, but that is beyond the control of management. And on the weekends they do fill up quickly so get there on time.", "author": "Eric K."}

It sure was comforting and allowed me to enjoy the goodness of the food in the moment. Our server was sweet, and therefore lightened up the start of my day. \n\nEats is a bit of a wait on weekends, and when we came to put our name on the board that is located outside, we had 10 names ahead of us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-04-16", "description": "I've been here 3 times. The first 2 times would have warranted this place an easy 4 stars for the location (The Richmond isn't the spot for brunch) and convenience, with classic brunch options and some Mexican inspiration. The food hits the spot, but isn't the creme de la creme of SF brunch. I believe hot coffee comes with free refills, which I appreciate a lot.\n\nThe 2 star review is for the service. I was very surprised with the lack of service today. I know that today in particular is a holiday (\"Easter Sunday\"), but we came at about 1:50pm when it wasn't as busy as Eats typically gets. We were seated immediately with no wait, but received little service after that... We were ready to order quickly because we wanted to be respectful f their time, but it honestly took 5+ minutes to flag anyone down. It seemed like there were 6 staff members of the floor, but only 1 woman was really serving. The majority of the staff seemed preoccupied with closing chores. As a waitress myself, I understand on busy the days you just want to GTFO of work, but failure to pay attention to customers only makes it longer for everyone. The food was ready pretty fast, but no one was serving. The cooks were definitely rushing since I'm sure they wanted to get out too. I watched for a few minutes as the hot food just sat there in a long queue, waiting to be served. Staff was busy either 1) closing the store before closing time 2) hanging out with customers. I really do have empathy for seeing your friends and doing your closing chores early, but there's a certain balance with work that you should strike to be productive and save everyone's time. Our eggs benedict was cooked all the way through, like a 100% boiled egg. \n\nThis restaurant is a fine establishment, and hopefully my review only applies to holidays or busy days.", "author": "Jacquelyn T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-05", "description": "It was late afternoon last Saturday, and we were in the Richmond. I was doing some historical research for a novel, with my husband and a writer friend in tow. On weekends, when in San Francisco with brunch intentions, it pays to wait and go late - helps you avoid the sidewalk crush of pert and early birds clamoring for avocado toast.\n\nEats was still semi-populous around noon-thirty (they close around two, I believe), but not overrun - and they have a pretty great kindergarten-tested method for wrangling the unruly masses: you write your own name and party number on a chalkboard posted on a pillar outside, and the house staff works off that.\n\nIt's something of an honor system with intermittent oversight. Knowing human nature, I had some doubts - otherwise upstanding people can get pretty sociopathic about brunch, and one could see where some Unconscionable could attempt to game the system; obviously as people are seated, names get erased, leaving tempting blank space above those still waiting.\n\nTheoretically, an unscrupulous would-be diner could attempt to exploit such a loophole while feigning ignorance. And indeed, some sketchy late-comers did attempt to write their names above, instead of below, visibly worrying two foreign tourist girls with the same party number, who had been politely waiting for at least a half-hour.\n\nWould America prove to be a land of chicanery and vice and brunch deferred?\n\nResoundingly, no.\n\nThe guy playing the part of host/waitron/houseman/line monitor that day was a seasoned do-no-harm-but-take-no-shit professional hospitality maven - firm and directed, but never once crossing the line into brusque or rude, which is frankly a tough line to walk. With an iron command of both chalk and board, he took one glance at the rogue names, re-wrote them below, erased them with a definitive flourish, and slapped the eraser back onto the board like it had personally insulted his mother.\n\nI didn't catch his name, but he was super cute, Asian, and had the stone-faced gravitas of a young Chuck Connors in dealing with the general shenanigans of the huddled and hungry denizens. As a former waitress, I swooned.\n\nDespite his (admirable) chalkboard tough-love, as a server he proved to be charming and good-natured, with a sense of humor and general savoir-faire that is rare and valuable in someone who works with the public.\n\nWhen I couldn't decide between the Mexican Scramble and the Divorce Eggs (come on, you want to eat them based on the name alone, don't you?), and asked his opinion, he said, \"Tell you what - get the Mexican scramble, and I'll bring you the tomatillo salsa so you can have the best of both worlds.\"\n\nA man of decisive generosity - who could ask for anything more?\n\nMy husband quite happily ensconced in his cowboy breakfast burrito, my friend was favorably impressed by her lox scramble with capers and cream cheese, and I have to say the bloody mary was just great - a perfect savory balance, well-seasoned and served in a wide-mouthed mason jar, apropos for the classy person we all are on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nEats is a nice space, too - a neighborhood joint with actual aesthetic, close and cozy tables, but a clientele you don't mind cozying up to, and with less customer competition to beat off, being slightly off the beaten path.\n\nWe shall certainly return forthwith on our next sojourn from Seattle!", "author": "Nicolase M."}

It's especially great since a lot of the Inner Richmond options are Asian Restaurants and not open for brunch!\n\nI'm a huge fan of the breakfast sandwich. It's large--definitely sharable! The eggs are soft cooked so they ooze everywhere. The ciabata bread is soft and soaks up the yolk perfectly. The sandwich includes a thick piece of melted cheddar cheese, an aioli sauce, arugula, tomato, and avocado (if you get the vegetarian one). The coffee and juices are great and I loved the mugs so much I even bought two of them. The potatoes that come with the sandwich are awesome. I've been here quite a few times but have stuck with this each time because it's so good! \n\nI will admit that the quality goes down depending on how busy it is. I've gone on quiet weekdays and been completely satisfied with no complaints. However, on a Sunday when they have a crowd, there were some problems.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-04", "description": "Decent place for brunch. It's nothing extraordinary in my books, but not terrible either. I came here with a group of 5 on Sunday around 11 AM for brunch. The street was blocked off for the farmer's market. The wait was about 40-50 minutes to be seated, which is to be expected for Sunday brunch in the city. \n\n+ DECOR/ATMOSPHERE: Very trendy. Sorta loud. Quintessentially SF. It's a small cafe on the corner with a few tables outside and a bunch of wooden tables inside. You can see the kitchen if you're seated towards the back so we were definitely anxiously staring at every plate that came out since we were all starving after waiting 40+ minutes LOL. The walls are decorated with large wooden boards with like little moss/grass chunks in a grid pattern -- I think it adds a quirky vibe to the place. The restaurant is hip without being too pretentious. \n\n+ FOOD: I ordered the spinach portabello mushroom eggs benedict with potatoes and a loaded Arnold Palmer. The eggs benny was delicious! It was fresh and not too heavy. The only complaint I had was that the eggs were a little overdone. No runny egg action here. They were most like soft boiled and slightly gooey on the inside. Which I dislike. It grosses me out. LOL. So I picked out all of the yolk from my eggs. But aside from that, it was a solid meal. Great portion size and I was not left feeling overstuffed at all (which I frequently struggle with because #neverstopeating). There were also a couple of roasted garlic cloves on the side too! I LOVE GARLIC. So this was a definite plus. The loaded Arnold Palmer was tasty. Supposedly had ginger soju in it. Did not taste very strong at all. There wasn't anything SUPER extraordinary about the food -- it was just overall good. Solid. A 7.5 or even 8/10. Definitely better brunches out there in the city though.\n\n+ SERVICE: Mixed feelings about this. Most of the wait staff was VERY friendly and fun! We'd joke around with them and they were all super nice. They were all fairly young so it was like joking around with your friends. It makes the atmosphere of the restaurant seem very friendly and laid back. HOWEVER, one of the servers from the kitchen that was passing our food out to us was kinda rude. It was hard to hear/understand him since he didn't enunciate very clearly but he kept saying that it was a spinach benedict and I kept saying that I had the portabello mushroom benedict and wondering if that was what he meant but he clearly got really annoyed with me because I couldn't understand what he was saying...eventually he gave me my food. But ya know, I wasn't trying to be a rude customer T_T I just couldn't understand what he was saying! Short tempers man. Oh well.\n\nOverall, a decent place for brunch. The menu is pretty expansive. I'd definitely want to come back to try the waffles. But the wait time is sort of ridiculous for average food.

Decor was cute and the staff was helpful and nice. \n\nI got the huevos rancheros and it was awesome. I don't even like eggs over easy, but I didn't mind it at all with this dish (you can also ask for any style eggs. I'm just dumb and didn't read the full description). I also had to add a waffle because it just looked so good. It's a buttermilk waffle with honey butter and powdered sugar. It did not disappoint! Coffee was good, too! \n\nTip! When you walk up there's a board outside where you write your own name. At first you hope and wonder if the servers inside are paying attention to the board outside, but rest assured, they are! Definitely write your name up there right away. Another girl was unaware and ended up being shuffled down a few more places than she should have been because she didn't get her name up there. However, she wanted outside so they were able to seat her without her having to wait. \n\nAlso a great spot for your pet as there's outside eating!", "author": "Meghan L."}

The restaurant ran out of oatmeal at 10am on a Saturday. Oatmeal. At 10am. Avocado toast is a great price and on fantastic bread, but the greens were all brown, bruised and the sprouts are HUGE and too big to take a bite out of without the whole thing tumbling apart.

I don't know if the english muffins are made there but they were not like any I'd had before - very thick and fluffy.  They accidentally brought it with potatoes when I had ordered salad, so I ended up with both.  The potatoes were way better than I would have thought, almost buttery (they must use really good potatoes?) and I loved the salad, dressed with a subtle red wine vinaigrette.  Coffee is delicious, and they kept our coffee and water filled.\n\nThe staff are awesome, super friendly and great customer service.

You don't have to tell me twice about good food... \n\nSo we stood, in the rain...watching people go by, staring at people's food very awkwardly through the window like creepazoids. I mean that guy's polenta looked on point! \n\nThey are very strict about all people in the party being there on time. Honestly, if my party was not all there and my name was next, it sure would turn into a party of one real quick. But that's just me. \n\nWe get seated and the service is SO NICE! I don't know why I get surprised by good service. Maybe because it's starting to get few and far in between. When we get seated, I had to choose between a glass of mimosa or a carafe of mimosa. I'd say that I went with the carafe MOSTLY because it was a more economic deal. But yes, I ordered my carafe for one and the waiter did not judge me. In fact, he encouraged it. I appreciate that! \n\nMy friend ordered a bloody mary. We also asked for an extra glass so that I didn't look like I need to enroll in AA. We then ordered our food. I got the pork hash and my friend got the polenta (see, it helps to stare at people's food in the window). SOOOOO GOOOD! Basically, the only way you can be my friend is if you share your plates with me so that I can try everything on the menu. Shirley Y. made the cut for that reason (and she's awesome). \n\nI'm still thinking about that pork hash. But let me tell you my favorite part. Did these beezies put green chilies in the pork hash? I mean, you have to be pretty bold to do that and be an American restaurant! It was the perfect addition. So beware if you do not like spicy food, but if you do, you will be pleasantly surprised. \n\nNext, I want to try the pancakes.

I'm an engine-operating clich\u00e9. With an hour to kill on a brisk Saturday morning, I had a hankering for a full-fledged breakfast. You know what a hankering is, don't you? It's somewhere between a yen and a desperate craving. Never been to Eats. Walked by it many times, mostly when it's closed at night. So there would have been no point of breaking and entering. It was moderately busy inside, so I decided to be a sport and dine al fresco despite the chill in the air.

As I was about to ask her for coffee, she responded to the fidgety, curled finger of a gluttonous woman already wolfing down a plate of waffles. Crickets. Ah, she finally comes back and asks me if I want coffee. As she was turning around in haste, I exclaimed that I was ready to order. I decided upon the $10 Blueberry Pancakes with a $3.50 side of Spicy Mango & Habanero Chicken Sausage (photo: http://bit.ly/1D9RaR3). And a $4 six-ounce glass of Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice please (photo: http://bit.ly/12v5A2R). To her credit, the $3.50 mug of House Equator Coffee arrived quickly (photo: http://bit.ly/1DKo7FT).\n\nI needed it to warm myself through the Big Chill. More crickets. More iPhone tapping. Ah, the food arrives. Ten bucks for two flapjacks? OK, they are thick, not too spongy. Just a few blueberries in the pancakes, many more just plopped on top along with a shake from the powdered sugar canister (photo: http://bit.ly/1wqXuT7). Good but not as Aunt Jemima-transcendent as I was hoping they would be. The sausage has kick and provided enough protein to balance with the sweetened carbs.

Perhaps because there are no other American breakfast places in the entire area - no other choices or competition.  This place is for you If you don't cook & have nothing else to do all day.\n\nWhy only 1 star?\n- The wait for a table on the weekend or a holiday is nearly 1 hour because of the lack of alternatives.  It's also a small space.\n\n- There is nothing special/unique on the menu.  I dine out to have food that I won't/can't cook, there's practically nothing on the menu that I cannot make myself.\n\n- To compound the 1 hour wait for a table.  There were 9 people, count them NINE, who were seated after us, ordered their food, rec'd their food, ate their food, paid their check & left BEFORE our food arrived!!!  I could only see half the room from our cramped seats so I'm positive that there were more than the 9 I witnessed!!!  The same server seated us & still she took our order after taking the order from 5 people (2 parties) who were seated AFTER us.  That doesn't equal the time difference for receiving our food.  I think our order was lost, it wasn't noticed until they were leaving checks for other people & there was nothing done to expedite it.  Bad management!  Complete waste of $40 for brunch!\n\n- The seats we were given were ridiculously hot & sweaty, terrible conditions for any meal.  It was practically in the kitchen & there is absolutely NO ventilation at all in the restaurant.  It's usually the area reserved for employees to eat their meals.\n\n- Despite the heat, the water had zero ice.  We had to ask for ice or drink warm water, ick.\n\n- The hollandaise sauce for the benedict was absolutely gross!  It looked like congealed cheese, disgusting!  Luckily I was smart to ask for it on the side so it didn't ruin all of the food.  I had to eat the benedict without hollandaise, what is the point of that??!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-20", "description": "It's been a long-time trend for casual/classy brunching in San Francisco, and this summer's heat wave has certainly made little places like Eats even more essential. I would not travel across town to pay a visit, but I do have friends in the area, so I end up here 1-2 times a year. It feels independently owned and has a lot of character -- unlike the mini-Chain 'Toast Eatery' which are popping up around San Francisco like bland little mushrooms. (Sorry. Had to get that dig in.)\n\nSo, Eats is clearly a great neighborhood place, in a great neighborhood. On the weekends, there is ALWAYS a wait. But again, it's a great neighborhood; so get your name on the list, gauge the wait time, then go for a walk. The last time I visited, there was a farmer's market on the same block. A perfectly fine 'wait.' \n\nTo me, brunch means eggs, so I have only had the egg dishes. But they're all ways perfectly prepared (i.e., eggs not too hard), and the ingredients are always varied and interesting. My go-to is the smoked salmon omelette w/ cream cheese, capers, tomatoes, pickled red onions and dill. With friends, they have had the sandwiches, hotcakes, fruits, etc. All have reviewed them well. \n\nThey do have beer, bubbly, and a soju Bloody Mary. But even better, they have wonderful fresh squeezed juices and juice mixes, \u00e0 la the 'Refresher' w/ cucumber, pineapple, romaine, lime. (If only I could get some vodka in that.)\n\nIt's kid-friendly. You decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing...", "author": "Corey M."}

Parking took awhile, but it was ok. We waited about 15 minutes for a seat inside since it was way to chilly outside. We ordered half of the waffle with fruit, which was super delicious! The strawberry lemonade was good, but I could pass on it next time. The pork hash was satisfying, but the bread on the side was too hard for me haha. Also, got the Mexican scramble which was okay as well. Overall, food was okay. The waiter was awesome and he checked up on us, which I always appreciate. When he noticed I didn't get my lemonade by the time the food came, he still remembered it and made sure I got it. Therefore, service was great. In case you were wondering, the restroom was pretty clean haha. I'll be back...Especially for the waffle! It was a bit pricey, but my belly was fine with it.

It's a neighborhood gem and I appreciate the hard work of the cooks that prepare meals for the local Richmond customers and wider Eats patrons.\n\nOne point that was unexpected and infuriating was that one of the petite hostesses sat us to our table and my mother and I were minding our own business - getting seated into our space, happy and excited about our mother daughter breakfast. My mother took her napkin to wipe the table out of habit since she is a caregiver of young children. The lady in an aggressive tone, questioned why my mom wanted to wipe the table. She then kept saying it again to make a point in an angry demeanor. Her communication was needlessly rude and was out of line. This approach with customer service is not in step with my positive experiences at Eats. \"I already wiped the table and now you've already used your napkin. I don't know why you're doing it again!\" She was needlessly aggressive in tone.

I'd never die for any food really, but this was definitely DEFINITELY the best pancake I've ever eaten. Ingredients were plentiful and evenly spread out, and chocolate syrup was drizzled on top. A single pancake is great to split for two, on top of whatever orders you're getting individually. This fine delicacy (yeah, really) was so hot and crisp on the bottom after sitting out for a bit that it'd be a crime to even use the syrup or butter that came along with it. \n\nWhat else did I love? The STRAWBERRY LEMONADE. Most restaurants serve their drinks in mason jars nowadays, but none are as amazing looking as this drink here! There's a beautiful layer of fresh lemonade topped with strawberry puree (on ice, so it stays afloat), which is further topped off with fresh strawberries. YUM! \n\nAnd finally, the rest of our order: bf ordered some omelette that sounded tasty, and I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. Not bad, not excellent, and a little bit difficult to eat. The pancake was the real star, by far. Onto the service: I get that usually you have to write down your name to get seated, but the place was near empty when we walked in. We promptly got waved back outside to write our names & wait, only to be brought back in a moment later. We were seated with the wave of a hand by a fellow who couldn't bother to look our way. Could I be overreacting? Maybe. But I'm pretty sure it's because the guy's girlfriend was coming in and he was too preoccupied to pay attention to us. It's kinda crazy how you can bring up a brunch place and people will suddenly remember and refer to 'that one rude waiter', right? Anyways, every one of the parties that came after us were promptly greeted with a friendly smile. \n\nAnyways, if I could get these pancakes delivered fresh daily, I'd be a little bit poorer and a whole lot happier.", "author": "Christine L."}

Should've just canceled the missing items, but I still wanted them. Also when paying, I got the check from my waitress and gave her my credit card.

It was a busy packed day and by the time we left, people  were still waiting to get a table. We were done in an hour. \n\nWe ordered\n\nOne happy pancake \n\nThis order came wirh 2 pieces of normal soze pancake with poppyseed inside and lemon zest. When the ordered came i thought for 11 bucks it look skimpy with strawberry and only 2 pancakes. I thought they should give 3 pieces instead of 2 and more strawberries as well for 11 bucks. The pamcakes weee very refreshing anf zesty to my taste buds. You cant really taste the poppyseed inside but u can smell and taste it. \n\nHalf order of happy pancake \n\nThis is same as the above review but it was only one pancake.\n\nOne order of tri tip sandwich with green salad. \n\nThe bread was ciabatta and it was hard on the outside and inside was soft and the bread was thick as well. The big chunk of trip tip was a turn off because on the first bite the whole tri tip comes out. The carmelized onions were so dark and it was very sweet too and made the bread inside soggy. \n\nThe salad that came with it was very good i liked the dressing to it and tasted refreshing.  \n\nOne order spicy sausage polenta. \n\nThis had a great taste but the presentation is horrible and sloppy. The eggs were over easy so when u cut into it the yolk spills out. The sausage was mild spicy and had a great flavor and texture as well. The sauce on this place was over flowing and had a tomatoe taste to it. It also had polenta on the bottom of the plate and was not dry because of the over flow sauce on top of it. I love the extra corn inside and was good. \n\nOne farmers scramble. \nThis looks like a normal breafast plate and came with a mixed salad. It was so so. \n\nOveeall food was so so meaning ok not good or great or excellent. So overall is 3 out of 5. The long wait is not worth it. There are not alot of tables in there for large parties so not recommended. Plenty of 2 to 4 people sitting. \n\nThe presentation of the food was sloppy and plain and didnt stand out. I had to rearrange some to make it look more appealing. \n\nAlso inside was very hot for a 70 degree weather. I think they need some sc in there because we were all sweating and rhe windows canr cover the sun that is also beaming in with those see thru shades. Ir they need some more vents to get rid of the smoke from the cooking. \n\nThe sevice was slow and didnt refill our drinks or ice til we reminded them. also they dont have bottomless minosas its 22 for a bottle and fresh squeezed is included. I did get a bottle of beer and it was laguinita which was strong for beer. It was 9.9 oz so that was a strong beer for sure. And it was beer of the day in a bottle for 5.50.

I'm not too keen on the sweet-breakfast and opt for the  savory stuff most of the time.

The server didn't approach us nor say how much longer was our food. When our food came out, my husband waffles was cold. My order was incorrect. I told the server that they made my food wrong. Not just they didn't apologize, they said it was my fault. I ordered, \"Season's scramble\". My husband told them, egg whites and I said no cheese because I have allergies. The server even repeated saying no cheese and egg white. The server said to us that she didn't hear what I said. So she rudely took my plate and said they will remake my order and it will come out in 2 minutes. My food didn't come out till 5 minutes later. When my food came out, they skimmed on my egg. My food was so little. When we asked them for the check, they gave it to us so rude and walked off. Honestly this place isn't worth spending your money on. They aren't welcoming nor friendly with their customers. The food was mediocre.", "author": "Vanessa Q."}

You write your name, # of parties and whether you have preference where you sit (inside or out) on the waiting board. Surprisingly on a Saturday brunch time we were seated in 15 mins.\n\nServers are quick on their feet to get your orders in, served out and table cleared out. The only somewhat confusing thing is they have another staff (in order for efficiency) who comes out and serves you your food (instead of the server who orders your food). Since I have never been there, no idea what my food would look like it was somewhat confusing to have food delivered with her not knowing who ordered what, and me now knowing which one is mine.\n\nHowever it was still all good as food was delicious. If you are a big eater one plate would be a perfect portion for you. If not, there is definitely left over. I had their veggie egg sandwich. I love their bread, but the egg was supppppper greasssy, it comes with the option of red skinned potatoes, or salad. My d00d ate the waffles, bacon and eggs.

Decided on coming here with a friend on a Sunday morning at 11am, and the best discovery is a farmers market on Clement that you can explore while waiting for your seat! Was seated in about 15 minutes. The wait for your food is kind of long, probably since it's packed.\n\nI ordered the Famers' Scramble with a side salad, which was fantastic, and my friend ordered the Spinach Feta scramble with basil, which I tried and her and I agreed that the garlic was overpowering (there are chunks of seemingly raw garlic in the scramble). She also ordered a side of potatoes, which were great. The potatoes had whole cloves of garlic but it was roasted, which made it tasty versus the strong uncooked garlic in the scramble.\n\nPortions are decent, nothing huge. For 2 dishes and 2 coffees, bill came out to $15 a person, what you would expect in SF.

Or maybe I can.\nI ordered a scramble. Everything was alright until it arrived and I first found out I had to butter my own toast, which ended up leaving me and the table greasy and then the real kicker MY SCRAMBLE WAS COLD!!! I told my waiter (I won't mention his name but it began with a J). He politely and enthusiastically said they would remake the entire order. And then the troubles only continued. My new scramble was delivered with potatoes (which I expressly didn't order) and an \"I don't know why they made this with potatoes\". At this point my toast from my original order was cold and dry but I had already given up so I went to my scramble. It was hot enough but I then got a bite of a green onion which is still lingering almost 30 minutes later and likely will leave me without any ability to taste anything else for the rest of my day. Yikes!!!!\n\nMy waiter (J) then went somewhere, I don't know where I didn't see him again. \n\nTo be fair I was given a 'discount'; but $11.67 for the experience I had is; I don't know, outrageous?

Upon entering what looked like a college-town type diner, I was ready to inhale the menu. Luckily for me, the food did not disappoint. The buttermilk pancake was soft and fluffy without any hints of the aftertaste of batter that typically plagues poorly made pancakes made from mixes. The Ham and Tomato Benedict was a fun choice, but any eggs benedict made without lox can no longer be appreciated by this egg lover!\n\nThe Bacon and Fried Egg sandwich was excellent. With the golden egg yolk oozing onto the plate after the first bite, this hot mess of a sandwich with the flavorful bacon and crispy bread certainly hit the spot. The bacon/fried egg sandwich was a fantastic recommendation by the waiter to make up for the unavailability of the ricotta pancakes. They were no longer part of the menu after Eats changed owners.\n\nThe service was excellent as our waiter was warm and friendly, but sitting at the counter that oversees the open kitchen wasn't necessarily a great spot. The cooks almost seemed nervous when they spot us gawking at them as they made our food. I wonder why that is...\n\nThough I eventually found out that a few visitors had encountered roach problems at Eats during their visits, it really did not taint the recollection of my overall experience at Eats.

Everyone is happy and eager.\n\nHere's how it suffers when over-busy: not just slow to wait, serve, etc., but the server forgets half of the requests and orders. Want a refill on water or iced tea? 50/50 that will happen. Order one kind of toast or another, maybe, maybe not. Not? Ten minutes later she takes the dish back to the kitchen and ten minutes after that it comes back, corrected, and not too warm for the process. In fact, nothing here was too warm. It wasn't just one mistake, but one after another: no water, no refills, misdone order, no utensils (had to dash in to service station and steal them for myself). So obviously the place won't function at capacity.\n\nThey're not bad staff, or unfriendly, or anything else, just not capable of handling the load when the place is busy.\n\nThe saving grace? The food. When my dish, a \"spicy tomato\" vegetarian thing, came out, it was utterly delicious, fresh, homemade, and all around memorable, if only moderately above room temperature. You could tell they made the stewed tomatoes in house, and many other fresh ingredients.I'll just say, there was nothing left on the plate, what I couldn't sop up with bread I used my fingers. Another dish with poached eggs, they really know how to poach an egg, if you are here and you order an egg, your egg has been poached.\n\nHalf the dishes com eon an unruly huge overflowing plate. The other half are skillet dishes on an iron pan that looks disappointing at first, but after you've started to eat it, you realize that's ore than enough food fior you. Presentation is actually very nice.\n\nSo this was two star service and four star food, and a very decent breakfast. Your choice.", "author": "Gil S."}

I ordered the pulled pork hash while my friend ordered the mushroom spinach benedict.  The pulled pork hash was absolutely inedible.  It consisted of a bland combination of pulled pork, a few potatoes, and onions. All of this was steeped in a super oily mixture of nonexistent spices and sauce. The only redeeming part of this dish was the crusty bread served on the side.  I literally only ate 1/3 of the dish before giving up completely.

What I didn't like about it is that anyone could come up and erase your name because it's outside.  \n\nWhen I went, the wait was a little long, which was prolonged by the slooow workers.  This is a small place so when I see 2 tables not being cleared with people standing in line it shows that the priorities of the restaurant is not in line.  There was also a little argument regarding the wait and how the servers sat diners.  When we did finally get seated, our server was nice, but not as attentive as he could have been considering how small this place was.\n\nMy table had the chicken and waffles, waffle bacon, banana chocolate chip pancake, the 2-eggs any style, and the chicken sausage.  The chicken and waffles was pretty good.  I think the chicken made the dish; it was juicy, warm, and not greasy!  The waffle bacon was pretty good.  Did like how the cheese was melted within everything.  The banana chocolate chip pancake tasted exactly what it sounds like.  It wasn't too sweet for me, but for some reason I wasn't in the mood too try too much.  The chicken sausage was pretty good.  I was pretty happy it.\n\nIf you have a pup and the tables are out, this place would be pretty nice to eat at.  But be warned about the wait time and the slow service.

Well, if your anything like me, chow is continuous, and you love the simple joys of sleeping in and having breakfast well past the afternoon. That's where Eats come in. A small brunchary located in my neighborhood, the Richmond. Quite one of the only traditional breakfast joints within the area too, unless your diggin' for some Denny's or Mel's Drive-In (noty)..\n\nB.A.T.

The bacon was thick cut and crispy, they were very generous with the amount of avocado, and the scrambled eggs topped with the freshly chopped tomatoes made for a satisfying meal that didn't feel overly heavy. \n\nJr. Pancakes - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/21wF1dQFS2bEL56DuqxRsw?select=jFblpkCkO7hpEdlRhqyzHg#Ea_rIhbZ0qr2gnKYpB4B9Q\nWith the use of freshly cut strawberries, blueberries, and bananas, it was cute how they plated it to look like bears (see picture). I think my little sister really enjoyed that. Hey, if my sister is happy, that makes me happy! \n\nHummus and Eggs - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/21wF1dQFS2bEL56DuqxRsw?select=jFblpkCkO7hpEdlRhqyzHg#o_1UpXWxvb3GCUDh2tTleg\nSurprisingly good. Don't get me wrong, I haven't converted into no vegetarian or anything (don't be absurd), but the hummus had a great spicy kick that jumped out of nowhere, which was also pretty filling. \n\nChicken and Waffles - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/21wF1dQFS2bEL56DuqxRsw?select=jFblpkCkO7hpEdlRhqyzHg#rUINd1M_LLjKdNr5LICqHg\nThe waffles were cooked perfectly, warm, and soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, but the chicken was sadly over cooked.. the gray-brownish mushroom sauce didn't look too appetizing either.. However, the Eats crew happily replaced the meal for us, no frills. \n\nEats is a nice cozy place to grab some homey morning food and with some minor tinkering, they can have breakfast down like Mama's. The service was nice and friendly, especially when we wanted to send the chicken back, and it was simply great just to have a place that I could take my little sister for breakfast (she never had pancakes before).

I love the Vegetarian Egg Sandwich. It's very filling and is a great options for vegetarians. The Juevos Rancheros are alright, nothing exceptional. The So Happy Hotcakes are incredible - I usually don't order anything sweet for breakfast but the strawberry glaze has an acidic quality to it that balances the lemon poppyseed pancakes perfectly.\n\nI am giving them four stars because I love local businesses, but I wish I could give them a 3.5. Not quite a 3 because the food is awesome. But they don't really deserve a 4 either since their service can be really frustrating. I understand that it is a tight squeeze inside and adding another staff member would be just too many bodies. But it is so hard to get attention from their wait-staff. Even to get a refill on coffee or water is a struggle. Their service can be really, really slow and later in the afternoon it gets worse. That said, I understand they do the best they can with the amount of people they have and their servers are working really really hard to keep up. But I'd almost rather wait longer outside if they decided to take one or two tables out so that they can add another server for quicker service.\n\nMy suggestion: Go for the food. Go with company that you want to sit and talk with for a while (because you'll be waiting for service). Don't go if you're starving and need food immediately. And try to go before 9:30ish so you don't have to wait in a long line.

I even smelled something burning 30 seconds before they brought it to me and thought to myself \"I hope that's not my bagel burning.\" But of course it was, and they just didn't care enough to remake it. The girl who brought it to me (who turned out to be the manager) said it wasn't her fault because she didn't even look at it, she just brought it to me, and some people actually like their bagels burnt.", "author": "Liam S."}

If you don't mind a 15-20 minute wait then you'll have a great experience here. \n\nI have always gone for breakfast on the weekends so I knew that there would be some sort of a wait no matter what at any cute breakfast place. They have a chalkboard outside where you can write your name and specify if you want a private table or don't mind a communal table. I've sat at both and don't mind the coziness. You also have to be the kind of person that doesn't mind a loud happy atmosphere full of conversations and music (now that I think of it, is there music?) haha. \n\nThey have regular mimosas as well as apple mimosas that give you a little buzz so you know they don't skip out on the champagne like some places. They have a great variety of breakfast items and a few sandwich options for those who are looking for more lunch choices. \n\nThe only problem I've had here is during a busy Sunday morning my credit card was given to another table and charger $33 dollars when my bill was only $12. The people at the table realized it wasn't their card luckily so I was given it back and reimbursed, however it always takes about 4-5 business days to get it refunded. That can be a hassle for a struggling student or someone who always has to check their bank account when making a purchase like me. \n\nOverall I have always had a great experience here. The food is delicious and the eggs are cooked to perfection. I had a fried egg, arugula sandwich on ciabatta bread and my boyfriend had the caprese scrambled eggs...mmmm!

We ordered the B.A.T bacon avocado tomato scramble, Waffle Bacon w/ potatoes and the Pulled Pork hash. Soo let me tell you, the pulled pork hash just blew everything we ordered out the water. I'll get to that later, let's talk about the bacon waffle, it was just a thick slab of waffle with a thick slab of cheese and sunny side up eggs on top and my plate was pretty cold like u can tell the melted cheese got hard again, first bite was koo and then it just became a bit much of un satisfaction, at least the potatoes were garlicky but a tad bit dry. The B.A.T was eehh! Alright it's basically  scrambled eggs with big pieces of bacon, 2 dollops of avocado and a sprinkle of diced tomatoes. WTF! \"The food prolly had me feeling some type of way!\"  because I was starring at someone else's order of the Chicken and Waffles... That was lookin right for my type, smothered in mushroom gravy. Dam I should have ordered that. Oh wells! Let's get to the good part this pulled pork hash came in a little skillet okay, the only hot plate out of the 3 that we ordered it had potatoes,bell peppers and I think that's it.

Think of it as a chicken katsu since I think it is using Panko breading.

I got there a little before they opened, and there was already a line out the door! I considered not waiting, especially because it was freezing outside, but after I peeked at their menu, I had to stay. \n\nAbout ten minutes later, the sign flipped to 'open', and the huge group of people swarmed into the restaurant, practically filling it completely! As a server myself, I noticed there were only two girls working the floor. At first this concerned me, but once I saw them take charge and do one big sweep of the floor, giving everyone coffee and waters, I knew they had their system down. My order was taken about 5 minutes after sitting, ( I had to wait about another 5 minutes for my fresh juice, but when one of the girls explained to me that she was also my bartender, my food runner and my busser, I didn't mind waiting, and actually gave her props). \nHowever the table next to me did not seem to understand there wasn't a secret elf in the back making their lattes for them, and were constantly asking where they were. (and I think they thought they were the only table in the whole place) \n\nAbout ten minutes later my spinach feta benedict arrived with a side of potatoes. It usually comes with mushrooms on it, but my server told me she liked it with tomatoes and avocado instead, (which is what I got). It was amazing. The fluffiest english muffin I've ever met. I really liked that instead of giving me a generic answer of what to get, she actually told me how SHE orders her food, and was able to get it special, no problem. The fresh squeezed OJ was a perfect compliment too.\n\nOverall Eat's is my new favorite breakfast spot in the city. Not only do these girls work super hard, they are very friendly and helpful, and actually take a minute to chat with you. A few more employees arrived as I was getting ready to leave, and they seemed just as pleasant, thanking me on my way out. \nEat's you have a new regular!", "author": "Megan D."}

It was a small table near the window with two chairs and a bench, but it worked for us.  After checking the menu, we decided on the following:\n\nFor the boys:\nBacon, Avocado and Tomato Scramble with Sourdough Toast and a side salad.  Definitely was a great choice.  The photo I posted really says it all.  My son and I both enjoyed it.\n\nFor the girls:\nChicken and Waffles.  The waffles were nice and thick.  The chicken actually was a flattened chicken breast (2 pieces) with breaded coating and was served with a mushroom gravy (which you can ask to have on the side).  My wife was looking more for an actual bone-in chicken breast, but she said it tasted good regardless.  The waffles were also great according to my daughter.\n\nFor the kids to drink:\nHot Chocolate - they couldn't believe how big the cup was (looked like a small soup bowl)!  They used spoons to drink it!  LOL!\n\nFor me to indulge:\nTartine - a small toasted baguette with your choice of spreads.  I chose walnut butter and Nutella.  Enjoyed it very much.  It was like a twist on a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.\n\nThe service was friendly and prompt, considering how completely packed the place was.  Glad to see they had plenty of servers on hand.

As a Burma Superstar fan i knew that this place would soon become a fave. They have the same owners and for some time had the same servers.  It is with great sadness that i have fallen out of love with Eats due to their bad service. I mean I expect hipster crap in the mission but seriously on Clement St...it don't fly with me I don't care how great your food might be...the old servers are now gone and with them went the fun, chill atmosphere. It has been replaced with sarcastic...almost rude...I don't want to be working here but i have no choice servers.\n\nAfter my last two visits the service has left a lot to the be desired. My husband wanted one pancake...so he asked our server \"Teal\" (yes that's her name)...if he could get just one pancake...she then decided to \"school\"  him on how to order one pancake. She told him \"next time just say you want a side of pancakes not one..\" I mean her attitude and demeanor was flat out STANK!! He ordered the \"side\" of pancake...not \"pancakes\" as there is only one in a side...be sure to order correctly along with his other food. Guess what never made it to the table...yeah the side of pancake...luckily we were full and did not need the additional calories but the fact that she took the time to educate him on the proper way to order and forget to put in the order was not just an oversight on her part but I believe done out of spite!!\n\nWhen we told her after our meal that she forgot DA pancake her overreactive attitude and apologies to the moon and back confirmed to me that she was well aware of not putting in the order. She even offered to discount our bill but at that point we were not looking for apologies or a discounted meal.

So, that makes it one of the best places in the Richmond District (where there really aren't that many breakfast places from which to choose), too.\n\nI had the Spicy Tomato Skillet this morning. If you are a kale fan, like me, you could also call this a Spicy Kale Skillet, too. It's served with two eggs sunnyside-up atop a sort of vegetable stew consisting of lots and lots of kale, sliced red potatoes, tomatoes, onions, and green and red bell peppers. It was all very good, and made even better with a side order of their roasted home potatoes ~ the secret is (or not so secret, as it's chock full o') whole cloves of roasted garlic, too. These can be used in place of butter on your toast if you like (and I like).\n\nIf you would like to read my more detailed take on today's breakfastary repast, you can click on my account here and check out my stupid little breakfast 'blog.", "author": "Brian M."}

We walked in on a very not busy Thurs since it was Chinese New Year.  We ordered the chicken and waffles, the bacon and waffles (the one where the bacon is baked into the waffles), and the spicy tomato skillet thing.  Chicken and waffles, delicious, like they were last year.  But the chicken gets soggy with all that mushroom sauce so get it on the side.  The bacon and waffles was good!  The cheese they melted on top was odd but I guess you really can't go wrong with a bacon and cheese combo.  The skillet thing was a mess.  With the runny sunny side up eggs on top and the tomato soupy thing it sat on, I ended up barely touching it.  Most of it was liquidy anyways; not what I expected.  \n\nThe bacon and chicken/waffles dishes I give 4 stars, the skillet thing, 2.  Add in the SLOW service, it took us about 30 mins to get our food, I'm giving Eats 3 stars.  If we had more time to sit around and eat slowly during our lunch hour break I would enjoy the food more.

There were 2 large tables open when we arrived, so no waiting.  I had already eaten, so I ordered a half-order of fancy toast, thinking it sounded like a good treat. And I LOVED it. A toasted baguette topped with moist goats cheese, fresh strawberries & drizzled with honey. They have other choices of toppings as well like banana, pomegranate, nutella, or whipped cream.\n\nMy friend ordered the eggs, potatoes &toast. Minus potatoes, and with just 1 egg and a side of bacon. They suggested she just order side dishes in order to save a little money. The only issue was that she ordered 1 scrambled egg, and unless they serve ostrich eggs, it was obviously two. And she was charged for 2. I see the menu shows 2 eggs as the only side option, so it's understandable, but it would have been nice if the waiter had explained that to her.\n\nHer son had the tuna melt and inhaled it, so I think it met his approval.

I have tried several dishes here and today had the vegetarian egg breakfast sandwich.  It was utterly scrumptious.

And then need to slow yourself down to make sure you have the chance to savor every bite and prevent yourself from getting overly stuffed too quickly.  The breakfast potatoes are the best in the city.  Don't be afraid of the roasted garlic bulbs mixed in, they are mild and a perfect asset to the potatoes.     \n\nAll the other Yelp reviewers are correct, the wait can be very long and the service is spotty but it's worth it for the food.   I have waited just as long outside other breakfast establishments for food that doesn't hold a candle to that of Eats.

(which I like but i know a lot of people don't). The potatoes that come with are yummy, but a bit flavorless without ketchup.

It was 16$ and the grapefruit was a nice change in comparison to a traditional mimosa. The waiter said that it would be about 4 normal mimosas if you get the bigger thing so I did but realistically it was about 3 so meh. Nonetheless, I was happy about my choice! The food came from the kitchen super fast (probably because there was literally like 4 other people here) and everything was overall great. Our waiter was super nice and humorous in helping us decide what to get. My friend that was with me got a half of a portion of a berries and cream waffle and a side of sausage and loved it! But said that the waffle was very small for the money! The only issue that I had was the fact that they sent us the check about a half an hour before I was even halfway done with my sandwich.

They are roughly 3 or 4 inches on a side. This isn't a full diner waffle. This is a quarter of one. And the breakfast \"suite\" only includes ONE of them. And each additional waffle costs $3.75.

My only real complaint came during the waiting period, I was hoping for a cup of Joe to sip while I waited for my much anticipated breakfast-I was disappointment when the explanation was that the coffee machine could not accommodate in house guests and outside waits. All was good when we got our table as my coffee was literally waiting for me before I sat down :)\n\nThe thing I liked most about this place was the waffles-light, airy, crispy/crunchy crust on the outside and melt in your mouth on the inside. Just totally perfect-especially with whipped cream and berries. I'm so so sad I didn't get more than one! My counterparts both got the same dish-the Caprese salad which included: arugula, fresh mozzarella, eggplant and pesto sauce. I had a bite, delicious!! Also, the dudes in the kitchen know how to make over-medium eggs at Eats, you'd be surprised how many cooks don't know how to cook eggs in this city.\n\nOne of the best parts of this place are the portions. At a nearby restaurant, which I wont name but starts with the letter Q, one receives massive portions without real quality. Eats is the opposite, they serve up fresh ingredients they dont weigh you down the rest of the day because they don't serve you 3 lbs of greasy/salty food on your plate-they also freshly squeezed juices like the 'detox (beets, carrot, ginger, orange).

Three stars (though still borderline two stars) for its fresh-tasting ingredients, fresh juices, and the Farmer's scrambled eggs.. Minus two just because the concept of all the dishes on the menu sound delicious in theory, yet somehow it feels like each dish is missing something that binds the dish or it has a flavor that overpowers the rest. I really don't know how to explain it.  For examples, Chicken and Waffles with a little of an asian twist in this case sounds delicious... but that rich gravy flavor is in lack, chicken not as moist or crispy as desired, and waffles are whatever. I've also had the smoked salmon salad which is decent... but the dressing has too much dill? or not enough salt? or something. Idk each dish I try leaves me disappointed.\n\nI only come here because it is one of the few American breakfast/brunch spots in the Richmond and my whole family lives here so it's one of the meet-up places. Yet, each time I'm still not convinced this place is THAT great. I'm not saying this place is terrible, I know a lot of people like it and that explains the usual wait. I would just say: go in expecting a decent breakfast/brunch for prices on the steeper side of the mountain but nothing that will change your world. If you're not in the neighborhood and you are looking for an awesome new breakfast/brunch place, don't trouble coming over here. I'd rather leave the Rich to find better place... and i LOVE the Rich.\n\nP.S. I was (and still am) heartbroken when the original Eats was taken over by the new owners a couple/few years ago. The original Eats had with the biggest yummiest omelettes and the BEST ricotta pancakes, waaaaaay better than Plow and Park Chow.

The new menu is just okay. It sounds delicious but the dishes I have tried were not mouth-watering by any means. They were just okay. The interior is definitely better designed than before, but I would take the shabby old decor with the old menu anyday.\n\nThe Spicy Tomato Skillet sounded amazing, but it was too saucy. I think it should have been reduced and sprinkled with a handful of cheese. I actually took half of it home. Later, I reheated it with cheese and ate it with tortilla chips - way better. It made the sauce thicker while balancing out the jalapeno's in it and giving it an extra texture from the crunch of the chips. The grilled bread was awesome though. Maybe using the grilled bread, spread over some whole grain dijon mustard, topped with thinly sliced avocado, lettuce, and topped with a medium over egg\n\nThe Spanish Omelette sounded amazing also. However, it was pretty bland. It probably would taste more thrilling with some red onions, way more garlic, perhaps some curry powder and/or chili powder, and some cherry tomato and/or avocado added.\n\nEntering the place, the staff was very efficient in seating and serving water.

You felt like you were in a neighbor's home eating American breakfast food with an Asian twist (the teriyaki beef sirloin omlette comes to mind).  You ignored the fact that there was a 20 minute wait and that the decor had probably been the same since they opened because the food was that good and very affordable.\n\nThe new Eats still has a line, but no charm and a predictable, less-affordable menu.  I'm afraid Laurel Heights is continuing to bleed onto Clement Street coming from the east.  I had the chicken and waffles.  The waffles were too crispy, and the gravy had very little flavor.  You could tell that the gravy was homemade, but it was as if there was no seasoning in it.  I'll take Roscoe's over that any day.  The bacon waffles were good, but COLD.  My boyfriend said they were just as cold the first time he ordered them.  I don't know what that was about, but I hope it was just a fluke.  \n\nThe service at the old Eats was slow but courteous.

A customer waiting outside requesting coffee can't have a cup of coffee from the restaurant? Yes. It seems like a way to turn business away instead of make your customers feeling valued but that is their policy there.

I was very disappointed. I've been working in the service industry for 8 years and I would have been fired on the spot if I ate in front of the customers who I should be taking care of. Our server was rude and treated us as if we were a nuisance. Another server brought our check and when I tried to tell her which items to put on which card, she THREW her pen at me an told me to write it down.

Chorizo with polenta and poached eggs. \n\nThe chorizo was delicious, with a nice kick to start off my morning. I love anytime there's a little spice in my food. Normally, I'm not a fan of polenta but this was really smooth, buttery, and tasty. The poached eggs were unevenly cooked. One was nice and runny, the other was not.

Since I was last there, Eats has had a change of ownership -- and, based on this latest experience, I won't be back.\n\nThey've added a counter along the windows facing Clement, making the already-crowded dining room ridiculously cramped. And on a moderately warm (68 degrees) and sunny day, this area was just unbearable as the white muslin curtains that theoretically provided protection from the sun in fact created a near-perfect greenhouse effect, making sitting at the counter rather like roasting in a 350 degree oven.\n\nThe menu has changed. The beloved ricotta pancakes -- the reason I went there -- are gone. Instead I had a smoked salmon omelette which was okay but nothing spectacular, and came accompanied by one pathetic piece of toast (and I wasn't even asked what variety of toast I wanted).\n\nIn general, the prices seem somewhat higher as well. All in all, what had been a beloved neighborhood diner has attempted to move a notch upscale and not done it very well.

It topped off the ultimate sweet and savory aspect.  People eat their chicken and waffles separately, but I eat it on top of each other.   As I cut through the tender fried chicken on top of the fluffy yet crispy belgium waffle two friendly women talked to me about my dish. As I raved about the concept of Chicken and waffles, she talked about her experience in LA with Roscoes a long time ago.  I explained how I only like belgium waffle  and no skinny waffles and insisted for her to order Chicken and Waffles herself.\n\nThe best part of dish was the mushroom gravy, I never thought to add another piece to this crazy dish but it worked great.  When I ran out of gravy and waffle and all I had was fried chicken, I had to order another waffle.  So I used their house maple and shared the rest with David.  Over-all I was very impressed with EATS on Clement.

The staff moves cheerily and quickly. For 20 minutes, it's great to stroll down Clement, and check out some shops. The toy shop down the street kept us plenty occupied.\n\nChicken and Waffles - Large fried breast of chicken, in panko crusted batter. Chicken was moist and flavorful. The waffles light and hearty. The gravy was a flavorful mushroom, and not goopy and fatty like traditional gravy. I'd highly recommend it.\n\nHome fries - many dishes come with home fries. I'd recommend it. It's well-seasoned with roasted garlic. It's firm and with a crunchy (sometimes a bit too crunchy) exterior. \n\nBacon Waffle - Yes, you didn't mis-read. It's a waffle with a bacon in it. It's covered in cheese, hungarian peppers, and 2 eggs over-easy. If you are watching your cholesterol, it may be a good idea to avoid it. If you aren't, you could ask for them to put the mushroom gravy on it. (you only live once... and after eating this, maybe not too long)\n\nThey also make fresh juices.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-24", "description": "I feel bad giving Eats a three-star rating, but after two visits, it is all I can do.  First, the good things.  The service tries to be good. The servers are very friendly and do their best.  In addition, the restaurant's mainstream American food (which is what most people there seem to order) is done well and has good flavor.  Eggs, waffles, etc. are all done with interesting twists that add flavor.  The restaurant puts a gourmet touch on some dishes and definitely makes much of the food special.  So, service is friendly, and the core menu is good.  So why not a higher rating?\n\nSeveral things prevent Eats from getting  a higher rating from me.  First and foremost, the physical space really sucks; it is simply too small.   There is a long wait during peak hours and people have to wait outside until a table or counter space opens up.  Second, even when you get in, the eating space is super tight.  Eats has to turn a profit off of only a breakfast and brunch crowd (no dinner), which means packing people in and turning customers around quickly.  No matter where you sit, it is hard to shake the feeling that you are just crammed in.  There are people at counters and every possible seating area is jammed packed.  The last time I went, I got lucky and got a table -- right next to the bathroom, which was constantly in use while I was trying to eat.  Realistically, you feel like you just want to gulp down the food and get out into the fresh air again.  The tight eating space makes it hard to feel relaxed.\n\nThe crowdedness also affects the service.  While the servers are friendly, they are busy.  You are not likely to get asked if you want more coffee mid-meal unless there is a lull in business. As noted, however, the place is so busy, this rarely happens.  So, you tend to get friendly, attentive service up until you place your order, then the service drops off until the bill comes.  For the money Eats charges, customers deserve better.  \n\nWhile the food is generally tasty, not everything is right.  The Mexican food (e.g. huevos rancheros) is awful, at least if one likes  some authenticity.  Sadly, it seems the Latino cooks have been ordered to create fake Mexican food to appeal to mainstream tastes.  It does not have to be this way, as there are several upscale places that do a better job with ethnic food.  A gourmet bent should not be an excuse to ruin ethnic dishes.   \n\nSo, who won't like Eats.  Old people like me who like personal space and service, like slow meals and conversation, and authentic ethnic food.  Who will like it?  I suspect mostly young people who moved here after growing up in middle America with limited ethnic exposure, who want to try new places for familiar, but fancier, American fare, and who, if they are honest, do not really care about service and space too much.  Visit and judge for yourself.  But if you go, get there early to get a table away from the bathroom.  i am done for a while with Eats.", "author": "Miles N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-06", "description": "I went to Eats not because its got great reviews on Yelp, but because its near where I live and whenever I walk past it, it always looked so inviting and cute. \n\nI went on Friday morning to have breakfast with my friend.  We knew that under the old management their ricotta pancake was quite popular, however, it is no longer on the menu. \n\nThe two of us had:\n\nCoffee\nOne pancake\nHam & Tomato Egg's Benedict\nFried Egg Sandwich \n\nThe atmosphere of Eats is very welcoming and inviting.  It seemed homey yet at the same time clean and contemporary.  \n\nWe sat at the counter and could watch the cooks prepare our food.\n\nThe waiters were also very attentive, as the minute we sat down the coffee waiter came with the coffee.  However, the coffee from Eats were very watery and run down.  I am not a big coffee drinker and even I thought it tasted really bland.\n\nNext came our breakfast.  The eggs Benedict was okay.  Granted, i really liked it when I had it, but the next day we went to Mel's Drive In and I ordered eggs Benedict again, and I'd say the two were comparable.  Mel's eggs Benedict was just your normal eggs Benedict, but Eats added the twist of tomato.  So the tomato actually made the egg Benedict less heavy and more refreshing.  However, the hollandaise sauce that Eats used with it, which is a bit spicy, completely negated the taste/effect of the tomato.  So at the end, its just comparable to a normal Mel's eggs Benedict. \n\nThe pancake, oh the pancake.  Firstly, it was HUGE.  Second, it was THICK.  Third, it was surprisingly GOOD.  \n\nI am always hesitant to order pancakes.  I can honestly say I've never had a good tasting pancake my whole life, yet I continue to be tempted in ordering pancakes whenever i see it on the menu.  Pancake, the concept to me is so attractive.  To me, it should be a cake, that is flat, with the right amount of buttery sweetness, moist, light and fluffy texture as one would want in a cake.  Whether it be a gourmet restaurant, popular brunch spot, IHOP or pancake mix, I've never had a pancake where i go \"Yes, this is how a pancake should taste\" in my head. So \"pancake\" was always a very vague and elusive food item to me.  \n\nEats' pancake, is now what I would call a pancake.  It was served w/ powder sugar and butter.  I was really skeptical, after being disappointed many many times.  Then I ate it.  \n\nThe powdered sugar gave the right amount of sweetness, just when you think its an ordinary-sweet-and-too-sweet pancake, the butter kicks in and u get a hint of the salty butter.  Then as you are eating the pancake, you wait for that ultimate let down - when the pancake gets soggy and breaks apart in your mouth, and instead of a pancake its now simply batter that is sticking to the roof of your mouth or your teeth.  To me its felt like mixing the pancake batter in my mouth... not a texture I enjoyed.   (was this too descriptive?)  That didn't happen with Eats.  You can sorta chew on it, savor the taste and texture before swallowing.  \n\nWhile I was so-so with my eggs Benedict but loving the pancake, my friend would not shut up about how good his fried egg sandwich was (which worked to my advantage cause then I get to eat more of the pancake that we were suppose to share). The fried egg sandwich was a mess to eat alright, since the egg yolk ran all over the place.  But boy did that guy LOVED Eats' fried egg sandwich.  If guys can 'gush' I'd say he was gushing!  He took pictures of the sandwich untouched, then took pictures of the sandwich in his hand, then took pictures of the sandwich with egg yolk running.  He just LOVED that sandwich.  \n\nAll in all, I'd say Eats surpassed my expectation and definitely did a number on my friend.", "author": "Jessica C."}

Well luckily I was walking around the neighborhood and passed this quaint (and totally packed) little restaurant. I quickly looked at the name and reminded myself to look it up later when I got home. \n\nA few weeks later three friends and I decided to head over there for some brunch. I had called ahead and knew there was going to be about a 30 minute wait (on a Sunday morning that's to be expected) so wasn't bothered when the hostess told us how long it would be. It was so packed inside (the space is tiny!) that there was no way we were going to try to wait inside. Luckily it was a rare warm, sunny San Francisco day so we waited outside. We walked down a block to get some coffee and stood outside for about 25 more minutes before being seated. One complaint- there aren't many seats outside to sit on while waiting. \n\nOnce seated (I'll admit it was really crammed) the waitress came over to take our drink order, tell us the specials et cetera. I had been looking over at everyone's plates when we walked in and the vibrant green salad looked so freaking good! But I was on a breakfast mission and in desperate need of potatoes. The waitress happily gave us her opinions about what dishes to choose and based on that I has the prosciutto eggs benedict. My friends had the caprese omlette which looked amazing and my other friend had a sandwich with the side salad- which I kept eating. \n\nEverything was delicious, the price was reasonable and the service was great.

Okay, I get it if you're going for the homey feel...but the use of space is not efficient and not comfortable.  \n\nAlas, better that I know now than later.

Came on a weekday to avoid the crazy lines and walked right in to a seat at a table.\n\nChecked out the menu and guess what?!? Chicken and waffles?!? SOLD! The waffles were nice and crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Just the way I like them. Seasoning and crust on the chicken is really nice, it's just too bad the chicken is a dry chicken breast. The mushroom sauce on it doesn't really add to the fried chicken experience either.\n\nRegardless of that, I devoured it anyways. Why you might ask? Cause it's chicken and waffles.

I never tried Eats under the old management, so this review is based on my first and only visit to Eats, which is under new management (as I've read from Yelpers). \n\nThe restaurant itself is very small. Maybe 10 (less, maybe?) tables and some bar space, so be prepared to bump elbows with your neighbors! We had to wait about twenty minutes for a table on a Sunday morning around 10 am. Those waiting for a table are welcome to enjoy a cup of joe outside, so just ask. \n\nOnce seated, service was great. We sat at the bar facing the window and were promptly served hot cups of coffee. It got really hot since the place is so small and gets a lot of morning sun. And theres a lot of bustling going on...of course having hot coffee doesn't help! The menu is very small but offers some variety. \n\nShortly thereafter our server came to take our order and before we knew it, the food was already in front of us, piping hot. I had the modern twist on chicken and waffles...the chicken was panko fried and came with a Belgian style waffle and mushroom gravy on the side. My bf had the ham and tomato eggs benedict, and my sis had the bacon and fried egg sandwich with arugula. All of our dishes were good, with fresh ingredients. I will say that my waffle didn't blow me out of the water...it was crisp on the outside but it was dry and cakey on the inside. On a good note, all of the plates reminded me of Barefoot Contessa recipes. Simple and classic dishes with a contemporary spin. Appearance goes a long way here. Prices are more than your average coffeeshop but worth paying for the fresh ingredients.\n\nIf you're willing to wait and don't mind being seated in cozy quarters, Eats is worth trying for a fresh take on breakfast.", "author": "Kristen S."}

Everything else on the menu was pretty ho-hum. Now, however, it's a veritable smorgasbord of seasonal, farmer's market inspired dishes.\n\nAnd creative! Bacon Waffle? Yeah, you heard me right. It's a WAFFLE with BACON it! How could it get any better? I'll tell you! Those crevices in your waffle that are usually filled with syrup - or in the case of certain unsavory individuals, butter and powdered sugar - are filled with CHEESE! But the gastro goodness doesn't stop there! They take it OVER THE LINE and top it off with FRIED EGG! \n\nIt's like breakfast incarnate! \n\nDo yourself a favor and check this place out.

Having an early day off on Friday, husband and I wanted to have an adventure to try Eats which we have heard a few years ago to be very good. Weekend brunch is the selling point.\n\nRight we sat down and took a look of the menu, I have a feeling that I want to leave but DH would like to give it a try. Basically, Eats is a place to serve breakfasts all day. It does not make it stand out. Many places we know offer that.\n\nWe both ordered 2 eggs with chicken sausage. I took the salad and DH chose the potatoes. Interesting that the portion of my scrambled eggs seemed to be double of my DH's sunny side up eggs. The salad was fresh but the portion was too little for the price. The salad dressing was tasty. The chicken sausage tasted like the one sold in Costco and it was quite salty. So far, the ambiance was relaxing as it was a late lunch. No waiting to be seated was needed for us but we had waited for 25 minutes for our plates.Turn out we needed to eat fast because we only put 1 hour worth of quarters into the parking meter and the car was parked a few blocks away.\n\nOverall, the food is overpriced. The restaurant is small and the tables are placed so close and everyone next to your table can overhear what you have said to your companion. Parking is kind of suck.

South-facing buildings on Clement get sun almost all day long, so you can imagine how freakin hot the table top was when we got there at 1pm. The host, who was a cheery, farm-boy looking young fellow offered us to sit inside or out. When we decided to eat inside because we didn't want to get second degree burns on our elbows & asses, we were sort of forced to sit at a tiny table in the front.\nMy husband is a vegetarian, and I wanted to check out the famous \"chicken & waffles\", so I did just that, and he ordered the spinach eggs Benedict with a salad. I should mention that we did NOT receive any of these famous \"free scones\" everyone is raving about.\n When his food arrived, there were potatoes as the side dish, and no salad. That turned out to be a happy accident, because the spuds were quite nice. Turns out he made the better choice. I waited another 10 minutes for my dish to arrive. The waffles were cold. And my \"fried chicken\" was not the Lousiana style of my youth (my stepdad is from Baton Rouge), but some sort of Asian-inspired melange of favors smothered to death in a mushroom sauce. It was ok, but I ended up eating half of my husbands dish because it was WAY BETTER. \nWith tip, the tab came to $40. All we had was the Benedict, the chicken & waffles, and 2 cups of coffee (which was good). At the old Eats, our enormous meals were so cheap that we would leave extra big tips because we felt bad! Easily $13 before tip for the two of us.\nThere were a few weirdnesses: At the table next to us, a woman had ordered a salad with a hard boiled egg, but it came sort of soft boiled. She asked that it be hardboiled, and they took her salad away. While her friends munched away on their meals, she waited patiently for about 5 minutes, then asked for her salad. They brought it without the egg so that she could start eating. 10 minutes later the waitress came over to tell her they were \"Still working\" on her (boiled) egg, and that it would take another 5 minutes!! I have no idea if she ever got her egg or not, but how freakin long does it take to boil an egg?\nAlso, they make a HUGE deal about charging you a fee for Healthy San Francisco. As past recipients of HSF, we know that  ALL San Francisco businesses that do not offer their employees health benefits HAVE to pay into HSF. Why does this place charge you extra? Why do they feel the need to tell you about it? Most places just lump the cost or add the fee to the food cost. Oh, that;s right! this place is so expensive already that they probably are afraid they will lose business if they do that. Pretty crooked for a business that already owns half of Clement St...I am sure they can afford it, don't you?", "author": "roz A."}

We obliged.\n\nThe bf ordered this waffle/berry/whipped cream goodness that looked absolutely sinful.  (Stephanie would have been proud.)  If I had to picture manna--this would be it.

They run out of something and I don't find out until they bring out my boyfriend's food, which is always fine, and I have to sit and watch him eat while they scramble to make up for the fact that an idiot is managing the kitchen and screwed up my order.  \n\nThe kitchen staff seems to be incapable of foreseeing when they will run out of things.  Nobody seems to be paying attention as levels get low.  Instead, they wait until they are completely out of something, then act surprised, as if nobody could have possibly noticed that they were running low ahead of time.  \n\nToday, however, the idiot server actually brought out my eggs benedict without sauce, placed it in front of me, and said, \"we ran out of hollandaise sauce.  I can get you some aoli or another sauce if you want...\"  I had to explain that it's not eggs benedict without the freaking sauce.  It's like bringing out the burger somebody ordered without a bun because you ran out.  You just don't do that.  What a freaking moron.  It's bad enough that the kitchen staff is oblivious and doesn't have the presence of mind to alert the servers when they are almost out of something.  The real kicker was that I was expected to eat something minus a key component, which isn't what I ordered, and that I received no compensation whatsoever for this mess.  I should have contested the bill, but I didn't because I'm a sucker.  It's the last time, though, because I am done going here.  The staff needs to get their act together.", "author": "Katie B."}

I used to like going here for their awesome brunches even though parking wasn't the best. It was worth the wait because their omelets were delicious. However, I came back here a few months ago and found that it was owned by new people. They kept the name but disappointingly did not live up to the great food I once knew. \n\nIt is too pricey for their small portions and it took forever for our food to arrive. Our waitress was nice but I think she was annoyed of me since I kept waving her our way with questions. I couldn't help it though because I had to ask for water, straws, napkins, the check, EVERYTHING. And it wasn't even that busy. If everything came at a timely manner, I wouldn't have to keep flagging her down.\n\nWhen our food finally did arrive it wasn't warm enough. They even messed up the waffles by overcooking them. How could they mess up the waffles?! Anyways, I don't even know what else to complain about. Maybe it was just the cook they had that day, or maybe they were tired, or maybe I'm just making up excuses for them. Skip this place and make brunch at home. They totally killed the Eats I once knew. If you're going to keep a restaurant's name, you should do your homework and find out what they were famous for.

Or maybe it was called the Garden Scramble? Goat cheese, zucchini, perfectly cooked eggs...it was just right. Bit pricy, but that's SF brunch, and I'm willing to pay well when it's made well. I also like their big, ergonomic, retro coffee mugs. Coffee was OK, not memorably good or bad.\n\nNext time I stopped in was for lunch. My boyfriend had the egg sandwich with a side salad, and I had the eggplant sandwich. Mine was fairly good and came with a cup of house-made tomato soup on the side, but the eggplant was way undercooked (more raw than cooked). I had to actually take it out of the sandwich and essentially just had a roasted pepper/pesto sandwich. Even so, it wasn't HORRIBLE, just not what it should have been. My boyfriend's egg sandwich was great, though. \n\nWe also ordered the \"fresh-pressed\" juice (beet-celery-carrot-apple). I noticed the server pouring it from a pitcher removed from the fridge, though, which to me does not embody the phrase \"fresh-pressed\". It tasted day-old, too. It was around $6 for a small glass, I think, which is expensive for un-fresh juice.\n\nAll in all, it's a great place for breakfast, and a good place for lunch (wish they hadn't squeezed us in at the bar near the bathroom, though...awkward). My only real advice would be to cook the eggplant properly.", "author": "Hillary D."}

I ordered the special omelette of the day which was made of egg whites, goat cheese, chives etc.  The food was not bad at all...just not very much of it. It really warranted a picture to show the scale of, say the fork to the omelette. I'm not joking. I ordered coffee which was served hot (decent by the way) maybe 10 minutes before the plate was served. I finished the omelette with 5 bites and the coffee was still hot. I'm not trying to be nit picky and lame but just showing clear comparisons for what you get and what any seasoned breakfast goer would be used to. Smaller portions are fine but I wish they would scale their pricing accordingly. Again, I will eat here again out of convenience alone but am interested in reading what others have to say. \n\n2. Bring cash!! I was lucky to have had some on me this morning but would have felt pretty lame to have to walk out to get some (the closest BofA branch is about 5 blocks away) I think they would like to test this to see if they can get away with being a cash only establishment as the money saved on credit card transaction fees  would add up nicely over the course of a year. \n\n3. Not a single inquiry about how I was enjoying or if I enjoyed my meal. Maybe they had read the previous entry by another patron who was put off by intrusive inquiries of the management. Hey, that's a good thing! That means they stay on top of this and hopefully, are willing to listen to their customers and make things right.

It is a place he has been going to for years, until it closed briefly for renovations. Apparently it is now under new management with a new chef and has been completely remodeled. \n\nAll very clean and welcoming. Service was excellent, helpful and friendly. Food was delicious, especially the breakfast menu. \n\nI had the scrambled eggs with chicken and apple, spice sausage and my friend had the pouched eggs with prosciutto. \n\nPresentation of the food was high quality and of course the dishes we ordered were excellent. \n\nDoug the chef does a wonderful job and enjoys meeting with the customers when he has a moment or two. \n\nEmily our waitress explained that the specialties on the menu are made fresh daily and change frequently. Some of the breads and desserts are baked fresh for that day or week. \n\nCafe Latte is great, served in what is like a little soup bowl. Lots of froth and foam on top. Very satisfying! \n\nFor today I had the blueberry scones as well as a red velvet cupcake. They were good. But the cupcakes like the scones were mini and I was disappointed about that. \n\nWhile my friend and I completely enjoyed our meal, the new remodeled ambiance as well as the excellent service, we were very disappointed by the price. \n\nEats is now a very upscale place. My simple scrambled eggs and sausage cost over $9.00. I think that is a bit high. The mini red velvet cup cake was over 1.00. The mini scones were over three dollars. And when I say mini I mean really small, about the width of a quarter or silver dollar. Ha! \n\nYet with a fine culinary schooled and certified chef and an all original fresh daily menu, perhaps that is the way it goes these days. \n\nApparently from what my friend was telling me Eats used to be a \"greasy spoon\" type of place that was very inexpensive.

Once again, after a number of cocktails the night prior, the amazing scrambles of this place were used to sop up the hangovers and headaches. So many embarrassing and hedonistic experiences were relived at these tables Sunday at around noon. \n\nThe scrambles here are awesome. They're huge, not too expensive and the ingredients are vast. We used to come down here about ten ppl. deep and wait outside until we could practically take over the whole spot. \n\nAlso, this location is great place to people watch. This is where I came up with rentapuppy.com. All these attractive women would walk by on their way to do whatever. None would give guys the time of day, regardless of how attractive they were. That is, until one of those guys had a dog. If a guy had a dog, girls were all over him. I saw the ugliest guy ever get like three numbers in five minutes with that little puppy power. \n\nSo I came up with the idea of rentapuppy.com. A guy could rent a dog for a weekend and pick up girls with it. I thought it was a great idea. Unfortunately, the Humane Society had their doubts... \n\nBut back to Eats. Eats was a great place to have Sunday Funday Brunch. So my friends and I went there every Sunday for nearly a year. At one point, my friend was so hung over that when the waitress dumped a tray of waters in his lap, he said nothing. He simply threw up. It was amazing. \n\nThe issue was that no matter how many times we went there, no matter how outlandish the exploits within their business, the staff of Eats would never acknowledge we'd been there before. To be treated as new customers after eight straight months of patronage is crazy. We seriously stopped going because it peeved us so much. So sad, because I really loved the food. \n\nSo the food is excellent and the view is entertaining. But because they never acknowledged us as regulars, it must be a three.", "author": "Joseph S."}

We asked if they were still open, and they nodded aggressively and said \"yes\" with smiles. So we obliged, and sat down.\n\nWe were rushed to order. My friend and I hadn't seen each other in awhile, and I was trying to stay patiently on my voice rest, writing back to her. We were just about to stop catching up and decide what we were going to order, when, heaven forbid!, we were taking too long. Within 4 minutes of sitting down, we'd had our rushed drink orders taken (coffee, for both), and were now being forced to order. We were too scared to say we needed more time. \n\nThe food was ready super pronto, and was average at best. (Honestly, I think Crepe Vine's omelettes on Fillmore are better, and that's akin to a chain restaurant.) \n\nBy 3:15pm, they were already tackily counting their money and closing up shop, and it was VERY clear that we were now intruders, as the check was already on our table after they lied \"take your time\" when delivering it. We were basically being stared down as we ate our omelettes, and thank goodness there was an elderly couple next to us. I knew we had only as long as they did, so I was watching them as my friend and I *tried* to have a leisurely brunch. \n\nI'm in no way pleased with Eats. If you decide to keep your door unlocked and tell us you're still open, then once we're inside, it is not in good taste to then rush us. And as everyone knows going into the restaurant business, closing times vary, as they depend on your customers. (This, coming from a former waitress - myself.) When in a customer service industry, it's the customers that dictate your final closing time. If you're not ok with that, open a different business. Not cool, Eats.", "author": "Sally M."}

You can special request an egg-white omelet for no extra cost, the potatoes are hearty and seasoned well, and the RICOTTA PANCAKES are delciousness.

But this place was real. It actually reminded me of diners I would see back in Florida: Stock decor dating back to the mid-80s, fake flowers in the tables, easy listening, old people, and lots of strange aromas in the air.\n\nThe service was crazy fast, and the menu was typical. I liked it because it didn't give me too many options, which can sometimes lead to mini fits of rage. \n\nI ordered the vegetarian omelet and it was the size of a small baby! It was a little crispy around the edges, though. My  toast was definitely a bit of a bummer, being totally blackened and gross. But beggars can't really be choosers. Not to mention the waitress was really sweet and very good about topping off my coffee cup!\n\nThis place might actually be cooler than Q or any other nearby hip brunch place.

It's like, everyone's experience of San Francisco is utterly different, and there was no magical glory days better than any other time. Your memories are just gilded because you were young enough that everyone was spoiling you and driving your ass around. The eighties in SF was a time of recession, shabbiness, brokedown buses and peeling paint, and $45,000 houses. Don't even try to play like it wasn't. Unless you were super rich, in which case fuck you. \n\nBut anyway. If you want to try to get a feel for what it was like here \"back in the day\", you can have breakfast at Eats on Clement. \n\nCopious amounts of un-fancy diner food in a minimally adulterated Victorian commercial space, with pink and mint green painted moldings. I'm not sure why, but pink and mint green figure prominently in my memories of the city in the eighties. On a sunny Sunday, the diner is filled with natural light streaming through the generous fenestration, and a horde of badly-dressed regular looking people and a smattering of cops. The nostalgia is palpable in framed glamour shots of Pfleuger theaters (http://sfntf.org/ , holla!) and an illuminated night shot of the Embarcadero Center. \n\nThe proprietorship has a sweet, friendly family vibe, and two people can get more than enough butter-soaked food for $20.

It's pretty hard to mess up on eggs and stuff, but I've been to places where they couldn't scramble eggs for shit.

Yum.\n\nThe food arrives, and it's hot, fresh, and smelling damn good. The cajun sausage sort of just tasted like a Louisiana hot link in my opinion.. but I LOVED the home fries. They were chunks of potatoes fried to a cripsy charred nugget. Some people won't like it because it'll be too greasy and oily and junk, but it sure did hit the spot for me. You see, I was currently recovering from a hang over from last night, and plus it was my first meal since 4am, at about 3pm. \n\nThe corned beef hash was pretty good as well.

Is is because restaurants are afraid to cook a sausage properly, serve it whole, and potentially have someone burned when cutting into it?  It is sacrilegious to cut a sausage in half before cooking it... However, I do not entirely blame restaurants for this...I blame lawyers, and people who whine over being burned by delicious cased meats.  People, properly cooked cased meats can be dangerous - suck it up and risk the burn - it must be cooked whole to taste good.  If you are burned, shine it on and leave the restaurant alone - or order bacon, otherwise we will all end up eating cardboard cased meats.  \n\nBack to Eats...

I don't know what everyone is saying about small portions, my plate was full and now my belly is too.\nWe showed up on a Sunday around 1:30. They were pretty slow, only a few tables were taken, so they were nice enough to substitute tomato and avocado for the spinich and mushrooms on the Eggs Benedict. When it came out I was totally surprised. It was beautiful. I've never seen an English muffin that huge! Big enough to hold 2 eggs! It was perfectly golden brown and buttery. The eggs were wonderful, too often I get runny whites, and I hate that, but not here. The holindaise sauce was light and buttery, only complaint there is I would have liked a little more of it. There was melted and browned cheese on top of the avocado and tomato, and the veggies were fresh and tasty. I have to admit, this is the BEST eggs Benedict I've EVER had. And I get eggs Benedict every where I go. It's my test to see if they're good cooks. And this one beat Zazzi by a mile. The potatoes were good. A little spicy and flavorful. My boyfriend had the biggest chicken sandwich I've ever seen. He loved it. Couldn't stop raving about it's sheer awesomeness. And the fries were damn good. Perfectly cooked and seasoned with cracked sea salt. All this and I haven't even gotten to the coffee yet! If any of you remember the coffee that the old eats served, you'll agree that it was warm brown water. More like tea than coffee. I don't know what kind they're brewing there now, but it's wonderful. Strong and flavorful. And bottomless. Our water was refilled so many times my glass never emptied. Our check was dropped off when she picked up our plates. It wasn't cheap, $28, but it was so good we left 2 $20s and didn't want change. (I hope they tip out the cooks.)\nI love the new decor too. It looks great in there. Although anything is better than the old Eats. It was next to awful before.

Their service and food quality stays consistent, however today's experience was extremely disappointing. They seemed to hired some new faces who tend to lack professionalism and skills. First off, we put our names on list and as I looked in there were plenty of empty tables inside, maybe 8, that were not cleaned. I asked how long the wait will be, the waitress replied, \"15 mins.\" I said, \"Why is the wait 15 minutes when you have so many empty tables?\" Another waitress replied, \"We trying to get them all cleaned.\" We didn't say anything after that. However can see they were obviously clueless how to properly arrange seating because the waitress kept asking the waitress who in charge of the seating how to seat people. After waiting for 5 mins, we were seated towards the back of the restaurant. As soon as I sat down, I noticed a used fork on the bench that had food smudge all over it (gross... ). I immediately called the wait staff over to hand and told them about the sticky fork. Embarrassed, she immediately removed it. Secondly, The tables were sticky (my coffee mug kept getting stuck on table every time I tried to lift it). We waited nearly 15 mins before they offered us water and coffee. I ordered the eggs Benedict with ham and asparagus and my boyfriend ordered the spicy tomato skilled with kale with a side of sausage. When our food arrived, they accidentally gave my boyfriend the pulled pork hash (mind you, he can't have pork for medical reasons). It was the cook from the back that served the food. Luckily my boyfriend confirmed what it was and had them take it back right away. My eggs Benedict was good, yet the ham was overly salty. I liked it but then knew I wasn't over exaggerating because my lips felt weird (too much salt). My boyfriend chicken apple sausage was  burnt and after I finished my food, I noticed a short black hair on the side of my plate. Thank god it wasn't in my food. And lastly, they never came by to refill our waters. Of course I had to express my concerns and felt bad because this used to be our favorite  brunch spot. I wasn't looking for compensation, but just a reason why the food and service off. They apologized and took 12.00 dollars off. Nice gesture but why such a drastic change? Seems they may have gone through a recent change in management and have filled their servers spots with people who lack experience.", "author": "Priya K."}

(bacon, avocado, tomato) scramble and we split. Both dishes were delicious! Flavorful and creative without being fancy--my idea of a perfect brunch. Good selection of sides too (I had to pick from fresh fruit, a salad, country-style potatoes or fries AND I got toast!).\n\nI'd give the food five stars, but knocked one off the overall review for two reasons:\n1) The food is pricey for the size of the portions. Brunch entrees ran from $9-$12, but were about 2/3 the size of a regular brunch portion. We all left feeling still a little hungry... I'm all for smaller portions, but not when they come with big-portion prices.\n2) The staff is friendly, but service lacks attention. As a former waitress, I'm willing to forgive a lot and still leave a 20% tip (which I did this time), but I also notice everything. The main complaint with this joint is that I had to ask for things multiple times. When we arrived there was a bit of a wait and I was parched, so I asked the host if I could get a glass of water. He said no problem and that he would bring it out to me, but then never did. We were seated about 10 min after that, so it didn't bug me too much, but then our waitress didn't bring water when we sat down and I had to ask for it... twice... before it came. Same thing happened with the food. When they brought mine out, with a side of toast, I asked for jam and had to ask again before they remembered it. Sure, it was Sunday brunch peak hours, but it wasn't busy enough to explain this lack of attention. \n\nLuckily, the service was the only part of this brunch that left a bad taste in my mouth :)", "author": "Lindsey S."}

It's a little spot that most people over look, because they're too busy looking for parking for B-star or genki or quickly. It looks like a run down spot, however its operated in the most efficient economical way possible. and that's why they are still there.\n\nDefinitely a mom and pop shop, so if mom and pop shops aren't for you...then go to stacks (which is good too. see my review on that as well). The food may not look that \"appealing\" but once you pop...oh man, your in for it. The decor and ambiance isn't too appealing, but it feels like you are in a big dining room, cause your pretty much sitting elbow to elbow with the parties next to you. But it adds to the experience. In addition the smell of sausage eggs and bacon and oil consumes this small little hole in the wall. \n\nTheir omelets and ricotta pancakes are the best fix for a home made meal. and the homefries/potatoes hit the spot. I ask them to cook em just a little more than they usually do, to get that crisp and crunch. If you want to take a risk, i say you go for the \"Eats special\", which is pretty much scrambled eggs, veggies and some meat mixed around. I'm still alive, so it's pretty good...right?\n\nIf you do go there, i recommend you go there early, and if you drive, be sure to drop someone off, and sign in. Find parking away from the avenues (on the opposite side of arguello), maybe i shouldn't have said that, but now you know where i park. damn. If you bring a big group, expect to wait REALLY long, cause this is a place mostly for 2s and 4s. that and you'll get dirty stares from the other people waiting outside. you don't want that. we're all just trying to eat.\n\nthis is why I usually order for pickup and it takes about 10 minutes to make. they don't have menus you can take home nor do they have menus online. but they pretty much have the standards from santa fe, denver, etc. etc. either way you won't be disappointed. \n\nIn reality, anyone could cook this on their own...but why would you? Most of us don't have time or the supplies to cook such things, or the skill to make awesome homefries.

When we ordered food, we asked for both coffee and water but after another 10 minutes, I actually poured my friend coffee from the wait station. They didn't notice. And when we told our server we did that, she just said they were really busy. Btw the tables that sat down after us had coffee and water served right away.

The host at Burma said to us..\" dont fret little foodies, we are serving Burma food at a place down the street called Eats. Its temporary but you can try it out.\" So we did and it wasnt as good as burma usually is but we made do.  \nApparently Eats is partnered with Burma. Its all in the family. \nWhile we were snacking on Burmese we looked at the breakfast menu and adored the beautiful new interior of the former diner. I was sold, a few weeks later whilst hungover, we went to try it out. We showed up about 1pm and didnt wait long. We were seated at the counter in front of the kitchen and got to see all the action. The spinach and mushroom eggs benedict was just right, Not too salty with fresh bug muffins and crisp veggies. The homefries are to die for. \nMy boyfriend got the pepper sausage scramble and it was a hefty portion with all the right stuff.

I was extremely sad to find out Rosie and her husband had left and new owners were taking over Eats (even if it was the folks who took rescued Burma Superstar). I was pleasantly surprised when I did go. They've redesigned the interior, styled it up. There are about 6 times the number of people working there, and it seems like less seating (definitely less floor space in the customer area, but used efficiently).\n\nI got the Belgian Waffle, and a mocha. The little lady got the bacon waffle. The food was great. The mocha was great. Besides having to wait quite a bit longer before ordering, the service was great. Back at the old Eats, we knew all the wait-staff and the owners, so the service was a given. Last Saturday all three waitresses who helped us genuinely seemed interested in how our experience was. I asked about the ricotta cheese pancakes  (rumored, but not on the menu), which were my favorite at the old Eats, and I was told they were still working on the recipe. \n\nI could honestly go for more of the old Eats menu items, like pancakes, French toast, etc. Since I don't live there now and can't go back so frequently, I guess I can get by with the waffles (and, hint hint, ricotta pancakes). \n\nI also asked about Rosie and her husband, the previous owners. I was told they had been looking to retire for a couple of years, and were finally able to. That made me happy. They definetly worked hard. Of course, maybe the new owners have them tied up in the back room and are holding them against their will until they give up their ricotta pancake recipe....\n\nThe only real negative is the same issue with the old Eats - the door does not close fully on its own, and on a cold Inner Richmond day the gusts of wind are highly annoying and detract from the experience, especially by the window seats to the left of the door as you come in. My advice to the owners - tweak that door closer mechanism so it completes the last inch of door closure when the wind is blowing. \n\nI'll be going back when I'm in the area. You can bet I'll be trying the riccotta pancakes when they get that on the menu. But I won't be sitting next to the door.", "author": "Mark P."}

I don't give a rip if the ricotta pancakes made by the previous owners were made from a mix ! They were freakin' awesome!!! If you want a fresh start, don't buy an establishment that was made famous by something you refuse to make!\n Furthermore, were that TRULY the reason you removed them from the menu (it couldn't possibly be your smug attitude, your overwhelmingly huge ego, or your inability to duplicate such deliciousness)  Mr. or Ms. NEW Eats owner, you would have been able to make EVEN MORE delicious ricotta pancakes from scratch...and KEEP THE ONE THING THAT MADE THIS RESTAURANT MEMORABLE ON THE MENU!!!\nI would have given you a much better rating had our waitress not acted smug and nasty when we asked about the pancakes; ...but she did. Now, there is nothing left to distinguish Eats from every other snotty, overpriced yuppy brunch spot in SF where you have to wait an hour to get something I could have easily duplicated at home.\nShame on you for taking a cool little joint (institution, really...), slapping some makeup on it and changing the entire menu to suit your ego....and next time, at least give me the whole waffle instead of 1/4 of a waffle. \nI was hungry again 5 minutes later, AND you left a bad taste in my mouth to boot.", "author": "Kathryn E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-02-11", "description": "Here goes my 1st yelp review.\n\nI live on the same block as Eat's and have been a regular for years. The old Eat's wasn't the most glamorous place, but it was good, consistent, simple food served quickly and cheaply.\n\nSo, I watched as the new remodel went into place, quickly figured out it was the Burma/ B-star folks behind it, as they are familiar faces in the neighborhood. Was sad to see the old Eats go, but willing to give the new place a fair shake, as I like the owner's other restaurants (though actually I didn't really care for B-Star when it first opened either - it seemed to take them several months to hit their stride in that place, I'm hoping the same will happen at Eat's.)\n\nSo I made my first visit about a week ago. Ordered a tea and the chicken and waffles.\n\nThe woman who appeared  to be the manager took my drink order. The entire time I was in the place she seemed to be hovering at every single table. While I was eating she kept approaching me and asking how everything was - intrusive and unprofessional. After I ordered my tea from her, I watched her walk over to another table and engage them in about a ten minute long conversation, my drink order completely forgotten until I flagged down another server. The rest of the service staff did seem more professional. \n\nThe tea comes in a teeny tiny little cup. The servers come  to the table about every two minutes to offer more hot water, which is fine, but that's not really the best way to brew tea, to keep pouring hot water over the same leaves.\n\nThe chicken and waffles - I don't really get this dish at all. I know chicken and waffles is a southern thing, but I've never had it before so I don't really know what to compare it to. In theory I like the \"comfort foods with a twist\" concept, so long as the \"comfort\" isn't lost. \n\nThe chicken itself was very moist, and had good flavor, but the panko crust on the outside was dark, dark brown, nearly burnt. It looked rather unappealing. It probably would have done better to fry it at a lower temperature. The waffles arrived at the table stone cold. I suspect the cook timed it so that she started the waffles at the same time as the chicken, the chicken took longer to cook while the waffles sat. The mushroom sauce went well with the chicken but didn't go well with the waffles at all. And for being the most expensive entree on the menu, $12, portions seemed rather dainty.\n\nI sorely miss my hang-over curing fried egg sandwich, and the hot pastrami with swiss cheese I used to order at the old Eat's. \n\nThere is only one sandwich on the menu now, and it appears to feature the same fried chicken as goes with the chicken and waffles. The old Eat's filled a niche, in that it was the only place in the neighborhood to get a decent hot sandwich for lunch. It seems very odd to me that a place that's only open till 3 in the afternoon wouldn't put together a better lunch menu. \n\nAnyway, just my first impressions. I'm sure I'll give it another go at some point, like I said I didn't like B-star much my first two times there, but have since come to appreciate it more. But really, there isn't much about the menu at present to bring me back in. I can make eggs at home.", "author": "Jonathan V."}

The sandwich was full of ripe avocado and was oozing with gooey egg yolk (ask for it over hard if you don't like a mess).  The ciabatta was easy to chew but still had a little toasty crispness on the outside.  The cheese was real sharp cheddar...I'm always impressed when a breakfast spot has quality cheese.  The side salad was pretty standard, but the veggies were all ripe.  Even the melon wedge on the side that I pass over at most places was perfectly ripe.

They give you nice size portions and the service is pretty good.  The prices are ok and you should try to get there early.  Sometimes you have to wait because the place is small.", "author": "Susan W."}

I was kind of surprised that a restaurant would even serve food that was that charred, and on both sides no less. \n\nSince those were pretty much inedible, I went for some potatoes on my friend's plate, only to find them cold and pretty bland and (surprise, surprise) kind of burned-tasting.  \n\nOh, and the coffee may be plentiful, but it's more like drinking coffee-flavored tea because it's so weak.  \n\nRedeeming factor: the orange juice was excellent.", "author": "Andrea M."}

It was fine to go to once in a while, and I generally liked it because it was laid back and the coffee wasn't bad. Some time around 2003 it got to be a real destination, with lines out the door and people willingly waiting over half an hour (in that cramped setting) for their orders. The kitchen there cannot accomodate that kind of volume.  If you're into that kind of energy on Sunday morning, then go for it.", "author": "Steve F."}

I got what I thought was the most food for my money (2 french toast, 4 sausage, 2 eggs, and potatoes for 6.50 i think). when i came home and opened my box, i got it to go, i was kinda let down because i had visualized a mountain of food and it was more of a hill and that they had also given me pancakes instead of french toast. The food wasn't bad, I mean i did eat it all, I think I was just hoping for more.", "author": "Eric C."}

I like the new decor- it's nice to have a pretty place to eat breakfast.  There is much more counter space, leaving more room in between tables (only about 10 maybe).  The menu is pretty good- except no pancakes!  They could use some more standard American breakfast fare.  They do have some delicious looking scrambles and the traditional eggs, bacon and potatoes.  I went wild and had the \"waffle bacon\". Yummy to the max.  In short it was a waffle cooked around bacon slices and topped with Hungarian peppers, white cheddar cheese and eggs. The peppers were what made it so unique and delicious.  It is not at inexpensive as the old EATS, the waffle bacon was about 10.50 or so and the standard breakfast listed above was about 8.50 maybe?? Coffee 2$ - so our meal for 2 was 26 + tip.  I would rather go out less and get better food than have cheap greasy food that the old EATS served.  All in all- its a great improvement!

The new Eats matches the taste and excellence of her other restaurants, Burma Superstar and B Star. I had the chicken, avocado, aioli sandwich and my partner had the spinach omelet. The sandwich was a great fusion of flavors, the spinach omelette a fine blend of fresh tastes. The herb roasted potatoes that came with the omelette were to die for! I think this is the best brunch place in the neighborhood now, as well as some nearby neighborhoods. Instead of Ella's on Presidio, go to Eats on Clement. It's smaller and not as upscale but worth the trip.", "author": "Sandy S."}

When I went they had recently reopened and i overheard someone ask the waitress where an ATM was (because, get this, it's CASH ONLY... at those prices? sure) and the waitress said that she didn't know where it was.  it was just funny, imo.  plus they had 4 chefs behind the counter... i don't know.  i guess i wasn't expecting that at all.  i wouldn't recommend it unless you feel like throwing some money away.", "author": "Nix B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-14", "description": "For me, two things in particular stand out at Eats.  One is their ricotta pancakes.  \"wait, wait... lemme get another bite of that... ok, now, kiss me!\" mmmm!  Second, their Hollandaise.  Funny, considering I actually had the server explain to me this morning why some people DON'T like it (sometimes lumpy). I've worked in many a restaurant on Oahu while in college.  From coffee shop to banquets to short order to steakhouses to 4 and 5 star fine dining houses.  Eats has by far the best hollandaise I've ever had.  Funny.  I mean, crap.  What is Hollandaise?  Freakin butter, lemon juice, and egg yolks.  I only eat it when I have Eggs Benedict.....or Florentine.... and, I go to Eats specifically for something covered with that wonderful artery clogging french concoction.  Sucky thing is, they only have Benedict on their menu for Sunday Brunch.  I didn't even realize the many times I'd been there happened to be on Sundays, as my last two trips there were on a Monday and Saturday, narrowly missing my rendezvous with triple bypass bliss.  Alas, the next visit will have to be a Sunday. Hopefully with less than a one block walk, twenty minute wait, and one lump in my Hollandaise.", "author": "Barry A."}

The waitresses are always friendly and it's a \"sit where you want\" comfortable vibe. It's at the quieter end of Clement, so it's nice and peaceful in the morning on the weekends. They have these awesome pancakes with fresh fruit and light syrup (it's not drenched, but they put just enough on to flavor it)...but I think it's a seasonal special. Great place to wake up over some coffee or cider on a Sunday.", "author": "Tami H."}

I passed by a few times but didn't have the patience to be on a waiting list. I must have came at the right time because we were seated immediately with a choice of tables. Shorly after, there was a line at the door. The service is phenomenal. Genuinely kind staff and my cup of coffee was always full. Even after I paid the bill already. If they are making good money on tips, they certainly deserve it. The environment had a home like feeling to it which is a huge plus. All the condiments you can possibly need are right next to you. Maybe because I've had way too many American breakfast on counters. As for the food, fantastic! This place definately raised the bar for how American breakfast should be. Now for the bad news. I think they should invest in new silverware. My fork was bent almost completely flat. If I was in Denny's, I'd bent it into shape.

If I could give no stars I would. My friend and I have wanted to go here forever but for some reason never have, now we know why......Went in here on Sunday with my friend, got seated fairly quickly considering the place was jammed. It took 20 mins before anybody came near us. We ordered food & drinks at the same time, which my friend didn't like as she likes to have her coffee while reviewing the menu. We ordered, 2 cokes, 1 coffee... a different waitress brought the drinks... NO coffee! After about 40 mins our food eventually arrived.  We both ordered sandwiches so there was really no cooking involved besides frying the fries and melting cheese, 40 mins??? I don't think so! I ordered the curry chicken salad open face sandwich which was totally inedible, I mean first, impossible to eat as the mixture was falling all over the place and second I didn't really want to eat it, it lacked flavor, and was actually making me sick to look at. I ate my fries, but was also disgusted at the ketchup, in a little half empty ketchup crusted container on the counter and it wasn't even proper ketchup! My friend ordered the tuna melt with no Chile pepper. She wasn't particularly enamored with her choice either. Firstly there was Chile peppers.....maybe if they took the orders with a pen and paper they might remember the proper order!!! and secondly the bread was fried, which wasn't stated on the menu. Nobody checked on us to see if we needed anything, or a refill on the coffee, oh sorry we never got the coffee!!!!! We finally got somebody's attention to get our check and escape!! Upon removing my plate, I was asked 'did I want a box', I said no and he asked 'did I not like it' to which I wanted to reply\" If I had liked it I would have eaten it, I did come here for food after all\" but, declined I just wanted to get the hell out of there. Service, food, atmosphere everything is lacking here and needless to say we will NEVER go to Eats for food again..... What a waste of $35!!!", "author": "Cassidy K."}
