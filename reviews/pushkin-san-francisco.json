It's my first time having Russian/Ukranian food and my friend introduced me to this place. The dumplings are phenomenal with sour cream (who knew? this combo works very well). Coming from a Chinese background, I originally thought it was sacrilegious to add sour cream?! Now I'm completely sold on it. I liked the lamb the most, but the beef is very good as well.\n\nThe borsch is also very solid.

There hasn't been anything reallly that highly reviewed until Pushkin. \n\nPushkin is the \"push\" I needed to enter the food court at the basement of the intersection of Bush/Kearney. \n\nWhat is a Pelmeni's to me essentially it was like a Chinese dumpling, which I've had more than a few.  \n\nI went with Beef AND Lamb Pelmenis. These come in a container with a lid and broth inside of them. Be forewarned however that these will leak (not watertight).  You can also get some sauce to go which I would have overlooked had I not seen a regular loading up. \n\nThe pirojki's were just meh to me. I got the spinach one so maybe I need something with some protein in it to satisfy my palette. \n\nFor the price/value I think it's a classic 3 star venue for me. I'd have it again and would return but I'm not super enthusiastic about it. \n\n\nIf you like my reviews, consider \"following\" my profile for reviews all across the SF Bay Area . Why \"follow\" someone?  It causes the person you follow's reviews to tier to top when you pull up a business. I find this very handy when researching venues. \n\nRod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base it on the likelihood of a return visit and I try to be stingy with 5 star reviews since they should be \"special\" in my eyes. Price/Value also play a role obviously but there are $ and $$$$ littered across my grading scale. \n\n5 stars - \"I'll go out of my way\" (approx 6 % of my reviews)  4 stars- \"If I was in the area I'd go here and would recommend\", (approx 38% of my reviews)  3 stars \"Maybe if was nearby\", (approx 37% of my reviews) 2 stars -\"Would likely not return, Only if you want to go\", (approx 16% of my reviews)  1 star -\"No thanks, even if I was hungry\", (approx. 3 % of my reviews)", "author": "Rod M."}

I ordered a small size Chicken Pelmini and it was the perfect size for me. It was about 8 dumplings in broth, and I added the scoop of sour cream in top. ( I count macros so it was the day I needed) All the textures and flavors went together perfectly and the quality of the broth tasted fresh! You could see the cooks making everything in the back which I valued. The service was friendly and the food was ready in 5 minutes.

Located in the International Food Court, Pushkin is an excellent option for lunch on weekdays.\n\nI tried a few different options this week: chicken, beef, and lentil pirojki and chicken pelmeni.\n\nThe pirojki was all excellent, if a little dry. I wish there was an accompanying dipping sauce or something of that sort. All three options were very flavorful.\n\nThe pelmeni comes in a soup container and has some of the broth that they use to cook the dumplings.

New favorite lunch spot in the area, by a WIDE margin.\n\nI'm not super familiar with Russian/Ukrainian food but i'm pretty well acquainted with Polish food, which is closely related. For a long time i've had a little empty place in my soul that i used to fill with pierogi and borscht from the mom-and-pop Polish joints in Brooklyn (which one assumes are now searingly hip bulgolgirrito spots, or craft pickle juice bars with the best poke tots in the 5 boroughs, or whatever. but i digress). This spot not only fills my hole [rephrase before publishing], indeed my hole now overfloweth [seriously, don't forget to rephrase].\n\nPossibly the best borscht i've ever had. chunks/strands of tender beef, super flavorful, i think the cabbage in it is sauerkraut but don't quote me on that. My other favorite is the potato vareniki (same as the Polish pierogi), topped with lightly caramelized onions and sour cream if you want it (you want it). [edit: sadly they have replaced this with potato and mushroom, and mushrooms are obviously gross. sadness ensues.] The pirojki that i've had have all been good too.\n\nWhenever i have this at work people follow their nose to my lunch like oOoOo what's that? and i basically turn into an enthusiastic commercial for Pushkin. \n\nListen, i love this place so much i didn't take off a star for closing at TWO IN THE AFTERNOON. I mean the SF food situation, especially around FiDi, is basically a competition to see who can spend the most hours closed, but literally nothing should close at 2pm. But again, this business is surrounded by others that are closed more than they're open, so i grudgingly accept that this is just the way of The City. Sigh.\n\nEat here. Early and often. And pray that someday you can also eat here slightly later and often. I honestly think i could eat this every day. Dammit, i really want some now but they're (say it with me) currently closed.\n\nBut seriously this place is the truth.", "author": "Taco P."}

I didn't like most of the stuff I tried, but to me that is dangerous. The thing is, he has these small sour cream containers as a condiment and when I didn't like the flavor of something, I would take sour cream in each bite. Well, I'm not used to it, and I ate lunch, yesterday, but it is early morning, the next day and my heart still feels funny.\n\nThe single dollar sign might be inaccurate, since you buy so many individual items to make a meal that you end up spending $15 on lunch without giving it much thought. I'm not sure of YELPs price points and cutoffs.\n\nThe sour cream is good quality! I really liked the spinach Pirojki, but the other pirojkis were okay. They cleaned the spinach perfectly, there was no sand or pebbles in it.  Also, be careful of their very limited hours if you are coming from far away. It is easy to get excited about this little restaurant and its exotic cuisine, but it is best to keep balanced.\n\nIt's not their fault. They are very generous with the sour cream. They work really hard! If you are overweight or have a heart condition, maybe limit yourself to one dish at a time, if you intend to use sour cream.

Go with a friend to sample across the menu!\n\nFOOD: Solid, filling staples with good flavor.  I appreciated the sour cream and garlic on the side :). I would have liked a sauerkraut option to punctuate the richness of the food with a bite of vinegar. \n\nPotato vareneki - reminiscent of a pan fried pierogi. The texture was nice and crisp on the fried side and the potato filling was smooth. That said, be sure to eat with the caramelized onions on top, as it is a bit bland without. \nMushroom pirojki - while the bun was delightfully fluffy, the mushrooms tasted one dimensional. I think some meat or a strong/sharp cheese added (hope this isn't heresy) would have added nice contrast. \nChicken pelmeni - while but bland compared to the beef and texturally uninteresting compared to the potato, I would have been happy enough had I not tried the others. I could not taste the cheese in this. The broth was flavorful and a lovely finish to the dish. \nBeef pelmeni - according to my Russian colleague, these are the most authentic item there (though we did not try the bleach). I enjoyed this a great deal! In completely non-Russian terms, it had the wrap of a pierogi and the inner flavor of an excellent burger. I mean this as a compliment!

Our cashier was friendly :).\n\nAMBIANCE: the International food court can be overwhelming, especially on a hot day.

Simple delicious Russian food in downtown SF!!\nThe couple working there (might be owners) speak perfect Russia and English.\nWe had beef and chicken pelmeni (dumplings) - you can ask for a mix (as I couldn't decide), borsch, piroshki with beef and with mushrooms. The salmon ones are also supposedly good (but is with cheese, and I don't eat it).\nAs a Russian, can vouch for authenticity. And am glad to finally have a normal Russian restaurant for lunch, that's reasonably priced, within walking distance from work! \nHope they make it work and stay open :-)", "author": "Stasia P."}

There's something appealing about the homey nature of the outfit -- Sergei's infectious enthusiasm at the counter, is partner (I don't know her name), moving fluidly (and on her own) in the open kitchen cranking out large quantities of dumplings -- that adds to its charm.\n\nIf you find yourself in the Food Court, definitely check out Pushkin!", "author": "Eric G."}

I am Russian so I am quite the critic, especially because my mother always cooked hearty and delicious Russian food for me growing up. So my standards were very high. When I saw the ad for this place on Yelp I was very excited to try it out. I got the beef piroshki and the potato vareniki. I am a diehard piroshki and vareniki/pelmeni fan and could honestly eat those items everyday of my life without getting tired. The beef piroshki was delicious and the vareniki were outstanding as well. They boil and fry their vareniki and they were absolutely delicious. I ate my meal in under 25 minutes. The guy behind the counter was also very kind and welcoming and gave great service. I am excited to now have a Russian/Ukrainian spot so close to work for a taste of home. Great job guys!", "author": "Beth G."}

The line was long and moved really slowly, about 3-5 minutes per customer (just to take orders), so maybe that's one area they can work on especially to handle the lunch rush hour. That aside, i did enjoy the beef dumplings I got (flavorful!!)The chicken piroshki was a little dry and tasted just OK but i liked that it had a generous amount of filling. Overall, good lunch spot but I would not wait 30minutes again for this. Hopefully it was just a bad day and the line goes faster next time!", "author": "Claire S."}

Anyway, I saw the sign for Russian food, which I don't see very often so I had to drop in.  The guy behind the counter was super sweet and gave be a description of their entire menu.  Small menu but they're new and it looks like they change their items often.  He let me sample the borsh which I've never had and it was amazing.  I ordered the chicken piroshky and pelmeni.  Warm comforting food and the piroshky is the best I've had so far  because the dough was fresh and the mushrooms were flavorful.  I'll be back Pushkin.  Cant wait to try more items.  Good Luck!!!!", "author": "Lauren S."}

Two reasons this place doesn't get five stars:\n\n(1) the borscht from last time wasn't five-star\n(2) the location is ... well, sheesh, that food court isn't the greatest.  Crowded, too noisy, no garbage cans.  Did I mention crowded?  And it's not that there are a ton-ton of people.  It's just too small.  I guess I shouldn't complain -- the food was still great.\n\nMy second time there, and my clairvoyance sees lots more in the future.", "author": "Chet M."}

The meat is nicely salted and not overcooked, and the dumplings skins are thick and chewy without being doughy -- exactly how I like them.  The \"fresh salad\" was fine, nothing particularly special and not worth the $5, but I'd come back anytime for more pelmeni.  I have no idea if they're authentic, but they are certainly tasty.", "author": "Matt Y."}
