I think this restaurant is super over rated with below average food!!! \n\nWe ordered three noodle specials (two with Chicken, one with tofu) and one Mongolian lamb. We also ordered tea, and coconut drink. \nThey didn't bring our tea, we asked waitresses about the tea. It seems they don't understand English, every time they said yes and then nothing happened. We also didn't have any dedicated waitress, each time one new person was showing up. They brought the Mongolian lamb first and didn't bring the rest of the food for about 10 minutes. They were literally serving our food one by one with delay! The noodles tasted good but lamb was not good at all!", "author": "Delasa A."}

After 45 minutes we were finally \"next\" for some time. A number of groups came in all at once behind us and the hostess who had already reassured me several times that we were next when she checked the list,  called a party of 4 behind us who had literally just arrived. When I protested she insisted another table was opening up and that it was more suitable for our party of 3.

On the suggestion of a friend who lives in the area came here instead and i'm so glad I did. The wait here was far shorter and I thought the service and food were waaaaay better. All the food we ordered was flavorful and came out pretty quickly. The service here was excellent as it seems like their wait staff work as a team for the entire place. The dishes I enjoyed the most was the mongolian beed and mandalay chicken. The beef was flavorful with just a hint of heat while the chicken was a good balance of sweet. This is my new favor place for burmese in the area and i will be back to try their other menu items.", "author": "Peter P."}

I do not know Richmond District that well and no promising lunch spot were in sight where I was until I ran into Mandalay. I first walked by, but luckily had a change of heart and made U-turn. The place is hard to miss because it is painted sunshine yellow, inside and out!\n\nMandalay has been around since 1984 and has changed ownership at least once, but according to what I read before writing this and experienced for myself it was the more recent owner who was the \"better cook\" and managed to change the fortunes of the restaurant.\n\nI am not familiar with Burmese food so I asked the server to bring me his favorite and a cup of Burmese ice tea (It is very similar to its cousin from Thailand!). The noodle dish I was served had Burmese flat noodle with mild coconut chicken, yellow peas, fried onions and a couple of other things in it that I do not remember, but it was delicious. \n\nThe servers were great and very friendly.

The waiter recommended getting the coconut rice with the chicken, which I really liked!

But not my fav. of the night!

It was a Wednesday night and they were slammed!  \n\nFour of us had never been, so we deferred to our friend Scott C to lead the charge on our family-style order... but of course, I chimed in with a few dishes that sounded too good to miss, and nothing disappointed.\n\nFrom the potsticker and salad appetizers to the eggplant and green bean veggie dishes and the shrimp special, fried rice and noodle dishes, there wasn't a \"downer dish\" amongst them...

We were celebrating a colleague's birthday, us being reunited in San Francisco, and this being the the former favorite Burmese restaurant of someone very special to all of us. \n\nAs you can see by the plethora of photos I took, we pigged out hard. This was my introduction to Burmese cuisine, and I have to say everything we tried was solid. It's safe to say we all walked away full and content.\n\nMy absolute favorite was the Roti bread that hit the table. So good that it gets its own paragraph! Like, OH MY GOD, this was undeniably life changing. The texture, the aroma, the richness, the flakiness, the chewiness. I had to practically beg my coworkers for an extra piece!\n\nWe sampled so many items that it was sensory overload. The noodles, the salads, the satay, the soups, the desserts - there wasn't anything that disappointed. \n\nOverall, the four stars go back to the service because it was extremely scattered. The servers were all very nice, don't get me wrong, just inconsistent.

That being said, there were definitely some stand out apps and mains that are a must have. I'm just gonna go down the list and try to remember everything we had...\n\nDrinks!\nLychee special cocktail - Almost everyone at the table got one and they took forever. They came out at different times and it's probably the only thing I didn't like about my meal. It was insanely sweet to the point of undrinkable. My coworker and I split a bottle of wine and were happy with that\n\nApps!\n***Must Have***The Tea Leaf Salad - As many have mentioned, this dish is so delicious. It doesn't look like anything exciting so I honestly thought it would be a flop but when you mix everything together it creates a flavor my mouth had never witnessed before\n\nFried Rice Cakes - These were surprisingly tasty and very shareable. Great item to get with a group.\n\nMango Salad - So fresh and so clean clean. This dish is beautiful and could honestly be served as a mango dessert.\n\nSizzling Rice Soup - They brought out a bunch of small bowls so we could all share. I enjoyed the flavor of the broth but it wasn't super memorable.\n\nSatay Chicken - It was good but if you've had one chicken on a stick, you've had em all amiright? Nothing against this dish but it didn't have the unique factor the other apps did.\n\nMains!\nBurmese Curry Lamb - I am not a huge fan of lamb but this was so tender and full of flavor. A surprising win.\n\n***Must Have***Special Noodles - The bar was set high as we had heard all about these noodles. We had 2 orders of chicken and 2 orders of shrimp. They're very similar and really depends on what your choice of protein is.\n\n***Must Have***Lychee Coconut Prawns - This dish came out late after one of the desserts so many people had already thrown in the towel. This was the one thing I picked out so I had to try. The people that did indulge were amazed. Don't forget about the lychee's and pineapple in the juice of the bowl... just as good as the prawns. Dump the leftover juice over your coconut rice. You'll thank me later!\n\nSides!\nFried Squash - These were simply okay. It was a nice extra to have on the table but not a stand out.\n\nDry Pan Fried String Beans - These were excellent and reminded me of how I do beans at home. Definitely a good shareable side for the table.\n\n***Must Have***Coconut Rice - We all had a small bowl and it was so good! I would say this is great to have if you're sharing and want some rice on your own too.\n\nDesserts!\nWe had a few and nothing really was amazing. We had already had plenty of mango but that's always a winner. I guess the black rice with ice cream on top was probably my favorite out of the handful we had.\n\nMust Haves!\nLooking for the perfect dinner for two? Stick to the must haves... Tea leaf salad, an order of special noodles, Lychee and Coconut Prawns, Coconut rice as a side, and decide if you want dessert here or stop somewhere on the way home. Don't forget that bottle of wine either!\n\nService!\nWe had a great experience at Mandalay for a group of 8 or 9 people. Some of the service was amazingly accommodating like putting two orders of Special noodles on one plate to save room on the table and making sure everything worked for our large group to share. Other things like super long wait times for drinks and one of the mains coming out after some of the desserts was odd.

Team Southeast selected Mandalay, as it was a special restaurant for all, and I am so happy we went with this one.\n\nI did my research and was told one must order the Tea Leaf Salad as well as the special noodles. Thankfully, our team came hungry and we ordered a few of each of those things and then some!\n\nWhat didn't we order. I would suggest to order a bunch of different dishes, and share with your group. For starters:\n- Fish Cakes\n- Tea Leaf Salad: this was to die for. The flavor combo of tea leaves, fried garlic, ground shrimp and sesame seeds with the dressing was unlike anything I had ever had before. A little acidic, but super well balanced at the same time. I loved every bite! Plus the presentation is pretty theatrical - they mix it all for you tableside.\n- Mango Salad: so refreshing! Spiralized mango for the win.\n- Sizzling Rice Soup: this had pieces of crispy rice with a super tasty broth.\n- Satay Skewers: a solid choice and definite crowd pleaser.\n- Balada: you must order this. Its a cripsy pancake with the most delicious dipping sauce ever.\n\nFor mains we ordered so many special noodles. These were amazing. These also come prepared tableside and the mixture of textures from the flat noodle, coconut chicken and then crispy noodles on top kept me coming back for second tastes (and thirds).\n\nOverall - the food was awesome, I am so bummed we don't have Burmese food in Miami! Mandalay takes Yelp reservations, so that is great for a group. I would highly suggest reservations, as the place was packed. \n\nService was mostly speedy - except it did take half my team 45 minutes to get their cocktails, which was a bummer.

We took a recommendation and our taste buds led the way to this amazing place.\n\nWhen you walk in you're greeted w/ Christmas lights on a palm tree, lights and such hanging from the ceiling, colors galore and great music. We were quickly greeted as soon as we sat down. I ordered a type of jasmine tea. It came in a wine glass w/ a flower in it. The heat makes this flower bloom. It's pretty cool to do w/ time lapse. The tea comes scolding hot and they tell you it. I didn't actually start drinking it until about half way through our meal. \n\nWe started w/ the Tea Leaf Salad (salad prepared with imported burmese tea leaves, toasted with lentil seeds, grounded shrimps, fried garlic, green pepper, sesame seeds, peanuts & dressing). They mix it up for you at the table so if you want a picture you better get it quick! All the flavors of this masterpiece were amazing. Unfortunately there was too much crunching for me. \n\nSingapore Style Noodle (Rice noodle with prawn, chicken & pork with curry spices). This is my jam!!! Everything about it. The flavors how everything works. I'd come back here solely for this right here. \n\nThis place was turning tables while we were there.

Best part was the sauce that came with it. \n\nMandalay special noodle: I liked the noodles and the overall flavor but the sauce still seemed a little too liquidy to me. I also didn't like that they used dried noodles as the crispies in this dish - they just ended up soggy.\n\nBurmese style chicken curry: average flavors. Nice pieces of chicken. Typical curry. Good portion. \n\nPork stew in pumpkin with sour mango: kinda disappointing. I was expecting the actual pumpkin bowl to be softer and cooked well-done so we could actually eat it. But nope. It was hard and you could only eat the few chunks of pumpkin inside. The pork was tender but not that amazing. I didn't taste any mango or sour mango. Just tasted like a regular pork and pumpkin stew. \n\nThe prices were pretty high for average food. The service was fine/good.

And I got a coconut drink that came with young coconut and tapioca.  It was so refreshing! I tried really hard not to finish it so quickly.  In the end, it ended up like my dessert as it was sweet (but not too sweet).\n\nI got the Mandalay chicken with white rice.  It was delicious, and had a nice garlic flavor.  I'm sure they would've made really good leftovers as I'm sure the flavor would've intensified.  But I gave it to my dad, and he devoured it.  He said it was good, so I need to go back and order more just for myself.\n\nMy friend and I arrived just before the dinner rush, so we received attentive service.  The last time I dined here, service wasn't so attentive, and the restaurant had packed tables to the brim.  I noticed this time that the tables were more spaced out, and they added seating in the bar by the door.  So I think they found a way to easily manage those dinner rushes that they still have.\n\nI need to note that the business owner messaged me regarding my previous review, invited me to come back, and offered an appetizer on the house.  I did not take him on that offer, but I definitely appreciate the gesture.  I wanted to come back on my own, and I'm happy to have dined here again.

As we arrive for this highly anticipated meal, the facade and inside are so similar to many other San Francisco establishments I have been to. But like many of those places, the cramped interior and forgettable front entrances are no indicator of the food. Burmese food is not something you can get regularly in most cities. So I am always happy to have it when I come to SF.\n\nMandalay's service started off very much on the wrong foot. The forgot three people's drink orders and took the first two courses to even come out. We had to ask numerous times about it, and when it finally came, I was a little disappointed in the drink itself. Far too sweet for my taste. I was very bitter by this experience... but only good things from there. All of the food we had was incredible. I was not very excited about the mango salad until I took the first bite. It was absolutely incredible. The crunchy bits really made it a spectacular dish. The fish cakes were a late addition to our table, but really glad we got them. This might have been my favorite dish and up there with the special noodles. Speaking of... get the special noodles. Enough said. The fried eggplant is also worthy of an order and went WAY too fast. The shrimp and satay were really good. But definitely overshadowed by the other dishes we had. The sizzling rice soup was one of my most hyped dishes that fell a little flat. Really cool sounding dish, but the flavor was again overshadowed by everything else.\n\nBesides the poor service to start, everything was fantastic.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-04", "description": "Inside, Mandalay's beautifully decorated dining room is always bustling and busy. My group was seated right away for dinner, and though the service was friendly and attentive, the food left something to be desired. That being said, the first dish we started with--the tea leaf salad was quite delicious! The classic tea leaf salad consists of fermented tea leaves, peanuts, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, and fried garlic chips, so as you might imagine, there's quite a lovely crunch to every bite! \n\nThe moo hin nga catfish chowder was distinctly acidic, but the soup could definitely have used more solid components. The mushu shrimp was a rather greasy stir-fried mixture of shrimp and vegetables, and the crispy tea-smoked duck served with buns on the side wasn't particularly flavorful. We had the Mandalay special noodles with chewy housemade noodles, coconut chicken, shredded onion, and fried noodles on top, but the flavor complexity of this dish was underwhelming and I could only taste the saltiness of it. Finally, we had the green papaya salad, dressed with garlic chips and ground shrimp, which was a nice refreshing dish to end the meal. \n\nBy the time we left the restaurant, however, all I could taste was MSG in the back of my throat. Though the service and atmosphere of Mandalay were nice, the dishes were relatively expensive for what they were, and many of the dishes have definitely been modified to cater to Americanized tastes. While not bad, Mandalay just isn't on the same level as Burma Superstar when it comes to the food.", "author": "David K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-22", "description": "Have you ever found yourself trying to eat at Burma Superstar (https://www.yelp.com/biz/burma-superstar-san-francisco-2), aka THE BEST restaurant ever, only to give up because the wait was atrocious? Sadly, this happened to me years ago on my birthday. The wait-time at Burma was around two hours ON A WEEKDAY, which we weren't down for. The hostess directed us to B Star Bar, their sibling restaurant (https://www.yelp.com/biz/b-star-bar-san-francisco), but it did not come close to matching the experience one gets at Burma Superstar. \n\nBut, there is one restaurant that does: Mandalay. My girlfriend and I were looking for a lunch spot to cap off a scenic hike along the coast. I originally suggested Burma Superstar, but that of course flew out the window since the line was HELLA LONG. We decided to give Mandalay a try and it turned out to be a positive experience! \n\nMandalay is located in San Francisco's Inner Richmond neighborhood along California Street (between 5th and 6th Avenue). I dig this location because of its convenience and accessibility. For one, Inner Richmond is quite calm compared to other parts of the city (e.g. Sunset, Mission, etc.). As a result, traffic should be light and you don't need to worry too much about finding street parking. If you choose to take public transportation (good for you!), plenty of transit lines go through here. Furthermore, Mandalay is legit ONE STREET DOWN from Burma Superstar! Waiting too long at Superstar? Come here! When we arrived at ~1pm on a Sunday, the place was only a third full. \n\nFor the most part, Mandalay offers many of the same Burmese staples that are found at Superstar. For example, this restaurant also has Samusas, Tea Leaf Salad, and Nan Gyi Dok. However, you'll find many options here that you won't get at Superstar (e.g. Singapore Style Noodle, Mango Salad, etc.) because Mandalay is a FUSION between both Burmese AND Chinese. Large menu = happy me. As far as pricing goes, you're looking at approximately $11-$15 per dish - fairly similar to Superstar. My girlfriend and I got the Mandalay Special Noodle, Tea Leaf Salad, Burmese Curry Beef, and a side of Coconut Rice. Here's what we thought:\n\n-TEA LEAF SALAD (8/10): I always love the explosion of flavor that comes along with a good Tea Leaf Salad. It's hard to mesh different ingredients together, but Mandalay makes a solid attempt. I felt like the soft texture of the peanuts and the diced tomatoes blended flawlessly with the crunchiness of the garlic chips and the sesame seeds. Plus, the addition of jalapeno slices was a nice, spicy touch. It all came together wonderfully with a sweet/sour mixture of lemon juice, grounded dried shrimp, and tea leaves. The only downer was that I wished it had chopped lettuce. \n\n-BURMESE CURRY BEEF (7/10): Their Curry Beef reminded me of a delicious Rendang. The sauce was creamy, savory, and oh so fragrant! I found the beef to be quite chewy and it soaked up the sauce like nothing. This dish also came with potatoes, which I appreciated because I love potaters. However, I thought the beef/potatoes could have been cooked a bit longer as some pieces were a bit hard. If anything, I'd just get this dish for the sauce - perfect topping for rice! \n\n-MANDALAY SPECIAL NOODLE (8/10): Shoutout to my friend Tina for suggesting the Mandalay Special because it was fire! In a nutshell, this dish was virtually a carb version of the Tea Leaf Salad. The noodles were super soft, the lime/lemon coconut sauce added an intense, sour flavor, and the chicken was SO TENDER. Also, gotta love the fried noodle toppings because that was like the icing on the cake! My only con was that they could have given us more chicken. \n\n-COCONUT RICE (7/10): The Coconut Rice came out fluffy, and I loved that they gave a nice bed of fried coconut strips too! It was lacking in the aroma department (couldn't smell it all the way from the kitchen like you could at Superstar), but this was not a bad choice for a side. \n\n-SERVICE (7/10): Service was pretty decent here. The employees were fairly quick to respond when we needed something, and they made sure to refill our cups with water when they were getting empty. I'm always a fan of Burmese restaurants because the waiters/waitresses make sure to describe their dishes to you when serving them! \n\n-ATMOSPHERE (10/10): One of my favorite parts about Mandalay was the ambiance. From head to toe, this restaurant was DECKED OUT with paintings, ornaments, and greenery; I really felt like I was being transported to Myanmar/Burma. It just goes to show that a little effort can go a long way in transforming an old building into a beautiful masterpiece. \n\nIf you're looking for a decent alternative to Burma Superstar, Mandalay has got you covered.

Just this year this restaurant has taken the top spot as my favorite place to dine out in SF, possibly the entire solar system!\n\nLove the yellow and green paint of the building, the ornate artwork juxtaposed with christmas lights. I just love the vibe in here.\n\nWe see the same people working every time, hustling hard and turning tables efficiently without rushing people. \n\nAs a vegan leaning vegetarian, everything I have consumed here has been delicious, consistent and on point. Every single time. There are not many restaurants that I will willingly dine out at because most places use a lot of low quality ingredients, oil, or some other unknown additives. I know that Mandalay is quality because after every meal I have only felt amazing, with no digestive distress/aftermath. This is how I ultimately determine the worth of a restaurant, how does the food make me feel after I consume it? I believe that when the food is made with positive intent, in a positive environment that how you feel after you eat it will manifest in the body.\n\nMany dishes can be made vegetarian, and the servers even remember my dietary restrictions. Forget the wait at that other hyped Burmese place up the street and just come here. That other Burmese place is just a glorified Panda Express in my opinion. Mandalay is the real deal. I have never waited over 20 minutes for a table on the weekend for two people, even at peak dinnertime.\n\nThis place is so delicious it is a must go when people are visiting in town. \n\nFavorite vegetarian dishes are:\nsamusa soup \nginger salad \nrainbow salad\nkaw soi dok noodle \nnaked eggplant\nwalnut broccoli tofu\ncoconut rice\ntompoi rice", "author": "Travis B."}

I ordered the burlada (bread appetizer with curry-like sauce), tea leaf salad, fish soup, and the Burmese style noodle. Of all the items mentioned, my favorite was the burlada because the bread was warm and fluffy, the sauce was very flavorful and not too salty. \n\nThe tea leaf salad was missing the greens of lettuce or etc. I thought the chef forgot to add an extra component, but when I looked at pictures of other tea leaf salad, the chef didn't forget. The crunch factor was there, but I felt that it needed to be eaten with something else, whether lettuce or over rice.\n\nThe fish soup was ok, flavorful, but not much substance within the soup. The noodles weren't anything special. \n\nService was good and continuous. The wait staff even explained why there's a delay of bringing water, they were in the midst of washing more glasses. \n\nWait time was about 30-40 minutes after putting down my name. You can call to get your name on the list, but if your name was called and you're not there yet, you're out of luck. That's what happened to me.", "author": "Jean L."}

I still really like this place but didn't quite have the stellar experience on this latest visit.\n\nThe moo hin nga fish chowder was as delicious as ever... but it's now served as small or medium-size individual servings.  We opted for medium cup-size servings at a cost of $7 a cup.  $21 for three servings of soup seems excessive.\n\nThe tea salad tasted great but the portion has gotten smaller. That's merely a different way of increasing the cost per serving size.\n\nThe Mandalay special noodle salad was as good as ever.  Thank you for not reducing the portion size.\n\nWe ventured into dishes we hadn't tried before and would not recommend them.  One was a tea smoked duck with pumpkin.  It was good but too sweet.  The server took the dish and spent 5 minutes deconstructing it in front of us and then reconstructed it into 4 servings.  We then had to deconstruct her work to serve the portions that we wanted individually.  That was \nbizarre.  The other dish was a bird's nest seafood special.  Usually bird's nest dishes are made of something unusual and tempting to eat such as shredded taro.  This was nothing more than wheat flour.  And inside this fried tortilla bowl was a small serving of seafood in a very thick, syrupy, sweet sauce.\n\nWe plan to return some day when in the area, but will no longer make a special trek.", "author": "Lee K."}

We both regularly order takeout from here, at least a few times a month and it never disappoints! But I was able to actually go in person earlier this week for dinner, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to dine-in and finally leave a much overdo review. \n\nThe restaurant is generally always busy; however, busy just means that tables are always filled, but the wait time is not unreasonable. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table of 2 on a Monday night, which I did not think was unreasonable at all especially for SF. Also, if you're ever concerned with the wait time to dine-in, takeout is always 10-15 mins MAX, which is fantastic on those weeknights when we want a quick but worthwhile meal! \n\nThe inside is beautifully decorated, and always bustling and busy. Keep in mind that while this restaurant isn't small, it does get very noisy like most Asian restaurants, something that I do not mind at all because who doesn't like being social? The service is excellent, they are very attentive without being in your face, and the servers as well as the owners are very pleasant people! \n\nOur go to dishes are the Burmese Style Curry Chicken, Burmese Curry Lamb, Mandalay Chicken, and Dry Pan Fried String Bean (to which we generally add Seafood or Tofu). We also love the chicken samusas as an appetizer as well! Also love the Burmese Iced Tea - unlike Thai Iced Tea, this actually tastes like tea and is strong! \n\nAlso, P.S., there is another Burmese restaurant in the Inner Richmond area that constantly has an absurd line with an even more ridiculous wait time always (which I will not name), however Mandalay is 10x better than this place! Mandalay is so underrated, but seriously it is the best Burmese restaurant I've been to, and we will continue to come back regularly!", "author": "Abi R."}

Now I'm mad at myself for driving by so many times while thinking, \"Oh yeah, Mandalay, ... next time.\"  \n\nNow it's \"next time\". The restaurant itself, which has been there for decades, looks and feels as fresh as when it opened. The colors are cheerful and bright, the furnishings are like new, and the room is sunny all day.\n\nI have gone back twice, and must say, I like lunchtime there, with a friend. I'll have to go back and try dinner, though I expect the experience will be nearly identical. \n\nThis is a family owned restaurant and it felt like a family atmosphere. No fewer than three people came by, each with a smile, and made sure we had all we needed and that we were happy with our choices, and their quality. Everything was just right, but I felt confident that if there was any problem they would have been anxious to rectify it, gladly.\n\nThe food was crisp, and brightly flavored. The flavor combinations are not pan-Asian, they are distinctly Burmese. We love the Tea Leaf Salad, of course. From what I have read, everyone does. The Burlada was warm and delicious, and come with yummy sauce. The Shrimp Curry was luscious, with Coconut Rice. We loved the Eggplant Basil dish as well. \n\nWe enjoyed nice Ginger Lemonade with our meal, a perfect refresher with some spicy dishes, too.", "author": "James G."}

The truth is, Mandalay is just as good, if not better in that it has a slightly larger menu with simple to ornate dishes. Lots of vegetarian options as well. I've been coming here for about a decade and I feel like most of the dishes are packed with flavor, but healthy flavor. Very little additives; the star ingredients do the work here. Their tea leaf salad is not as fancy and plentiful as the B-Star franchise - but it's still incredibly delicious and has all the mainstays of the traditional dish.

The tea leaf salad was my favorite thing we ordered and the pancake with curry dipping sauce was equally amazing! The beef curry was a bit tougher than I thought it would be and the Mandalay beef was different than what we expected - it tasted like General Tsao's Chicken (but obviously beef).

So good.\n\nWe continued with the samosa soup which is best and soothing on a cold rainy day but on ANY day it's wonderful.\n\nJ wanted the chicken satay...which came with four skewers of chicken but it seemed like it would have been nice to have a side of peanut sauce.\n\nThe broccoli with tofu and walnuts came next  The description says the broccoli is steamed and covered with a special sauce.  I've tried to relplicate the dish at home but my dish only got a B minus compared to their A Plus version.  \n\nWe got brown rice and coconut rice to go with our food.

We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Tea Leaf Salad (Lap Pat Dok): Salad prepared with imported Burmese tea leaves, toasted with lentil seeds, ground shrimp, fried garlic, sesame seeds, green peppers and dressing, no peanuts ($12.50)\n*Mandalay Special Noodle: Burmese flat noodles with mild coconut chicken, yellow peas powder, lime juice, onion and fried thin noodle on the top ($13.50)\n*Pumpkin Curry Chicken ($16)\n*Samusa (With Chicken): A mixture of grounded curried meat and potatoes ($10)\n*Balada: Burmese crispy pancake with Curry dipping sauce ($9)\n\nMy favorite dish was the tea leaf salad. A good amount of ingredients. Although I do like my tea leaf salad with a bit more lettuce. But that's just my prefer as I adore lettuce. The roti like pancake with curry was also pretty good. The bread had a nice chew and wasn't too oily. I did find the curry a touch too sweet though. Added sambal to counteract that and give it a kick. The samusas were nice and crispy. Kind of like fried comfort food. But I didn't like the sauce that came with it. Ended up using curry instead. The noodles were okay. Lots of stuff going on, but part of me wanted them to be a little saucier. My quick fix was to add a little curry and sambal. I didn't like the pumpkin curry at all. It was a little too starchy? Not sure if that's the right word, but maybe it was due to the pumpkin? Also, I found it too sweet.\n\nSome solid dishes and some I'd skip.

Not many know that this was the first Burmese restaurant outside Burma, today Myanmar: in those years, the country used to be a military dictatorship and it's only been less than a decade that it opened its borders to tourism. I used to go there on a weekly basis in the 1980s, now that I've shortly returned to stay at my mom's relatives to get some UCB certificates I had lost around in the world, I can confirm that almost nothing has changed. Prices are a bit steep, just as they used to be. Portions are a bit small, as they used to be.\n\nMyanmar is located down at the bottom of China, with Thailand on one side and India on the other. There are elements of each of those cuisines in the mix, along with foods from Burma's several regional cuisines, marked by a delicate blending of flavors that is uniquely Burmese. On your first trip to Mandalay go ahead and order the signature dishes: Tea Leaf Salad and Mohinga, along with whatever entrees catch your fancy. Also, plan not to be in a hurry when you go. It's a no-reservations, sign up and wait kind of place.\n\nMandalay on California Street in San Francisco is - for me and only for me - the best restaurant in San Francisco. Gracious service, gorgeous flower arrangements, and always excellent, tasty food with beautiful presentations make Mandalay my very favorite restaurant in San Francisco (I'm getting old and repetitive, I know). The place is cozy with an Asian decor, yet the tables are comfortably spaced. The service is always friendly and and very efficient.\n\nI went there with an empty stomach since more than 24 hrs. so I started with the Balada appetizer, a delicious crispy pancake with curry dipping sauce. Then I had Lap Pat Dok, a tea leaf salad with lentil seeds, fried garlic, sesame seeds, and peanuts that is an exotic taste delight. This salad is a must have!! Next I ordered the Rangoon Spicy Fish, an old time favorite of mine. \n\nI missed (too full even to walk, this requires more than one trip) the Samusa soup, described as \"Soup made of bean base, curry leaf, broken samusa, lentil, crunchy yellow bean, cabbage, onion and mint leaf\", and Mango, the vegetarian Egg Roll, the Basil Spicy Pork, all these are mandatory to try.

The service is so awful, I really really wonder why people like it or ever come back. I've never been treated with such disrespect as a patron at a restaurant, and from reading other reviews, it's clear it's not a one-off bad night for them, but a serious flaw in their service approach.\n\nCame here on a weeknight, not busy, no reservations for a birthday with a party of four. They sat us quickly, but the experience went downhill from there. We ordered water and our appetizers/entrees within ten minutes of being seated (we had to wait that amount of time to be greeted). After taking our order, waitress whisks away and isn't seen again. We chat, watching as other parties are seated around us. After 20 minutes, our appetizers have not arrived. As someone in the service industry, I think to myself, okay, maybe the kitchen is backed up, no biggie. \n\nAnother 10 minutes and no food of ours has arrived, but I notice that the tables who got seated after us receive their entire order. We ask a food runner if he can check on the food- he gives us a puzzled/frantic look and I watch as he tries to spot our server. It is clear to me that she had completely forgotten to put in our orders at all, because I watched her then talk to the kitchen and enter in our orders on the computer. No apologies or explanation. After over 45 minutes of being seated with just water, we get the one appetizer we ordered. It takes another 10 minutes for the entrees to get here, albeit not at the same time. The food was subpar- the samosa soup we had ordered was soggy and disappointing. \n\nServer comes to ask how the food is, we say that it's fine but we were disappointed to have waited so long. We get our check and they haven't comped a thing or given any apologies. This is not service. \n\nMy friend went back a few months later to try again, only to again wait over half an hour for entrees (while other folks seated after her get their food first). They kept trying to take her plates away, she told the busser she'd like to keep her plate and she picked it up anyway, to the point where she had to forcefully take her plate of food back. They tried to bus full or half amounts of beer- ATROCIOUS! We will never, EVER come back. I'd rather wait two hours for Burma Superstar than to ever come back here and feel the way this place makes me feel.", "author": "Hannah H."}

I think the food at Burma Superstar is probably better than the food at Mandalay but overall, I would probably come back to Mandalay in the future if the wait at BSS is as long as it often is. Mandalay is still busy but no where near as insane, they take reservations, and the restaurant is much less crowded so you can actually hear the people you are dining with. \n\nFood wise, my favorite thing by far was the shrimp and okra. Absolutely delicious, the flavors were simple - garlic mostly, but everything was well cooked and each bite had a ton of flavor. The balada - basically roti paratha - was also really good, and came with a massive paratha, larger than I've seen at most other places. Loved the sauce with it also. The  singapore noodles (made vegetarian but without tofu) were also pretty good. \n\nEverything else we tried was pretty average, with some things lacking flavor. The spicy tofu with vegetables was alright, but nothing special.  The burmese fried rice had zero flavor and was prety dissapointing; same with the pumpkin chicken curry- I wished it had a lot more flavor and more pieces of pumpkin. \n\nService is a bit chaotic, as you don't have a dedicated waiter but instead everyone kind of serves every table. They had a shortage of menus and kept trying to take ours away, eventually making us use 2-3 menus for a table of 6. One waiter was a bit curt and rude too- we asked him about one of our appetizers as it had been a while, just to make sure they were making it. He told us it wasn't \"fast food\" and had a fairly weird response where he almost chastised us for asking. The waiters also had a tendency of trying to clear plates when we were either not done or just barely done which created a bit of an uncomfortable dining experience. \n\nAll in all, I'd give them somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. I would consider coming back and probably ordering the things I enjoyed the most like the shrimp and okra while skipping a lot of the other options on the menu. 3 stars for now.", "author": "Seema U."}

Mandalay is not my absolute fav but still a great choice if you're looking for Burmese food in SF. \n\nThe food itself was so so good and flavorful but there were a few things that I was disappointed by. First of all, the portion sizes here are a bit disappointing. We ordered 2 tea lead salads and the 2 salads combined looked smaller than the size of one tea leaf salad at Burma Love.

Our wait was not too bad considering it was a Saturday night (~25min for 5 ppl) and the popularity of the Burmese restaurants around the Richmond district. The tea leaf salad, while highly spoken of on Yelp, is not all that Mandalay has to offer for your tummy! The tea leaf smoked duck for example is definitely worth a try--a totally different preparation of roasted duck and it's sooo tender. Also delicious on the menu: the roti with curry appetizer, mango chicken, and mandalay noodles. Frankly, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu!

So no fault on them for that. But she did order a dish and asked if she could have fried tofu added to which she was told that it wouldn't taste good and that the normal soft tofu would be better. \nMy gf gave in only to wait another 20 minutes where they dropped off the check and when I inquired about the dish she immediately made it seem like we canceled the dish with a final \"there must have been a miscommunication.\" \n\nIt was bizarre hearing her tell us it was our fault and to think the miscommunication was a justification of what had happened is preposterous.

Well when a friend suggested meeting up here for the first time I was a bit hesitant as I've never had Burmese food before. It was more important to me that we meet up so I was more than willing to try it.\n\nI looked up online to see what Burmese food was all about. It has several different influences consisting of Chinese, Indian & Southeast Asian. I thought to myself that I'm good with that as I've eaten each individual cuisine separately! I instantly went to Yelp for reviews & tips on this particular restaurant. It actually looked promising!\n\nI checked google map to see if parking was tough which it could be so we parked a couple miles away in Japantown where we love to frequent! We used Lyft to get ourselves there. All of us met up early before the restaurant actually opened.\n\nWe walked in early and they seated all five of us right away.  We decided to eat Chinese family style which meant sharing all of our dishes. The waiter wouldn't seat us five at a circular table which requires six people. It was okay as all of us were very courteous and passed all of our dishes all around to take pics and get our food.\n\nFirst came out the traditional tea leaf salad. The waiter showed us our dish and waited patiently for us to take our pics. He then gingerly mixed the salad to prepare it for us savoring it. I totally enjoyed it as unique and flavorful as it was!!! I loved the mix of the grains and nuts. This was uncharted territory as I have never had this before but I enjoyed it to the fullest!\n\nNext the waiter brought out the rainbow salad. Now he was super quick to mix it right away. So unfortunately I missed out on pics of the initial salad. It was truly amazing in taste even with a little spicy kick. It was more of a noodle salad much more different than the nut/grainy tea leaf salad.\n\nAfter the two yummy salads we had three more entrees to feast on. Our waiter initially insisted on us ordering more food but we were satisfied with our choices. Out came the curry beef, mango chicken, Singapore noodles & coconut rice.\n\nWow. Wow. Wow. I've been truly missing out on Burmese food. Everything was so very delicious and on point. I could kick myself for waiting so long to try this kind of food.\n\nBy the time we finished our lunch it looked like the restaurant was almost full to capacity. I can understand why as the hype is real. You are paying for the quality so it can get a bit pricey. But I did see that they do take credit cards here. Another plus was that they had a restroom available. \n\nHopefully one day we will be back!!!", "author": "Karen K."}

I'm a bit new to Burmese food, but everything was soo good here! I came with 2 of my girlfriends and we decided to order 4 dishes.\n\n- Tea leaf salad: One of the main things to remember about the salad here is that it does not come with lettuce!!! You must ask for the lettuce when you order, or they will assume you want it the \"traditional way\" without lettuce. I'm not sure if I would order it without the lettuce because I can imagine the fermented tea having a very strong taste, so we ordered lettuce with ours. The salad had the perfect blend of savory flavors and had the perfect ratio of lettuce to crunchies. It had a little heat too from the jalapenos. Tea leaf salad is a must order at any Burmese place!\n\n- Mango chicken: I would say this was one of my favorite dishes here! The chicken was covered in a sweet sauce and went very well with the mangoes. Usually I don't like cooked or even warm fruit but I enjoyed this dish a lot. The chicken was not dry but perfectly cooked.\n\n- Balada: This was a Burmese pancake (sort of like a \"roti\") with a curry dipping sauce. The pancake is a bit on the thicker side so it is definitely filling! It was more on the dough-y side than flakey (like banana island) and the curry dipping sauce was thick and had a strong curry flavor.\n\n- Mandalay special noodles: Yumm!! These noodles came unmixed to the table and it was mixed in front of us (same with the tea leaf salad). It had fried noodles (yay more crunchies) on top which added more texture to the soft noodles! There was an abnormally large amount of cilantro in it, so maybe ask your waiter to omit that if you're not a cilantro lover haha. The curry sauce was on the thinner side but still good. \n\nService was very friendly and we were actually seated pretty quickly for a Sunday night! I would love to come back to try more menu items! It's a good idea to come in a larger group to try a variety of things, rather than coming with just another person and only getting to try a few. Our total ended up being $20 each, which isn't too bad because we ordered 4 things!", "author": "Tara A."}

However, I had a difficult experience because I was trying to surprise my boyfriend with his favorite dessert after dinner (Mitchell's ice cream). I requested no singing or acknowledgment of his birthday because he doesn't like that sort of thing - which was respected for the most part. \n\nI had called the restaurant beforehand and spoken to the manager explaining that I'd wanted the ice cream to come out after dinner - he said no problem. I got there early and they were very busy. I gave the ice cream to one of the staff, asking her to put it in the freezer, and she said she would tell her manager. I \"went to the restroom\" a couple of times just to make sure no signing would happen and to ask them to bring out the ice cream. Once I sat back down one of the staff members came over to me and told me the ice cream was melted and offered to bring out their homemade ice cream - I thought perhaps as a courtesy for their mistake. I was very confused as to why the dessert I brought was not put in the freezer as requested, but agreed. \n\nI was also charged the mango ice cream. I liked the food, and overall the experience was nice, but this was pretty frustrating. I know that they were busy, but I also made several attempts before arriving and during my meal to make sure my request was clearly understood. It did not feel like it really mattered to them one way or another if this (pretty simple, all things considered) request was done correctly.", "author": "Tatiana G."}

I had not heard of it at the time, so I was surprised when I found the restaurant was busy and there was a bit of a wait. Since then, I've been to Mandalay a handful of times and left satisfied each time.\n\nThe restaurant is a bright green & yellow on the outside with an even funkier interior. There are a bunch of Christmas lights strung up, some statuesque artwork on the walls, neon-lighted palm trees, and a gong. The gong is my favorite piece.\n\nBurmese Iced Tea - as far as I can tell, not much difference from a Thai iced tea\nGinger Beer - very sweet, minty, citrus-y and refreshing\n\nTea Leaf Salad (Lap Pat Dok) - salad prepared with imported Burmese tea leaves, toasted with lentil seeds, ground shrimp, fried garlic, green pepper, sesame seeds, peanuts & dressing:\nFirst, the ingredients are presented on a plate that looks nothing like a salad. The server drizzles some dressing on top, and expertly mixes everything together until it resembles something like peanut dip. The flavors are complex, very savory, crunchy, and slightly spicy. I could eat two plates  of this stuff.\nI've had a couple of tea leaf salads in the past that had a lot of lettuce. Mr. Joy, who grew up on homemade Burmese food said that a traditional tea leaf salad doesn't have lettuce. The lettuce is simply a filler.\n\nCoconut Rice:\nFried coconut strands resembling shoestring fries lie on top of a bowl of rice. So simple, but makes the rice better.\n\nBalada - Burmese crispy pancake with curry dipping sauce:\nThis must be the Burmese version of roti or paratha. I appreciate that it is cut in 6, which makes for easier sharing. It is very soft, almost crepe-like, but savory. The curry dipping sauce is really good too, very creamy and not too spicy.\n\nBurmese Style Curry Chicken - Burmese style yellow curry chicken with potatoes:\nvery tender chicken with smooth & creamy curry, and potatoes soaked up curry flavor. It's a rather small portion.\n\nMandalay Special Noodle - Burmese flat noodle with mild coconut chicken, yellow peas powder lime juice, onion, fried thin noodle on top:\nThe coconut broth is very creamy and quite sweet while the cilantro brightens it up a bit. The flat noodles are silky smooth, almost slippery, while the fried noodles add crunch and texture. The dish could use a little more chicken though. \n\nMost of the dishes seem very similar to other types of Southeast Asian dishes, which makes sense, since a lot of the culture and cuisine overlapped over time. The only dish that I felt was completely new to me was the tea leaf salad, so I always order it. Other than the tea leaf salad, I aim to try new things when I come here. The other soup & noodle dishes are delicious, albeit all pretty similar. Perhaps I'll try their pumpkin curry and okra next time. The service here is pretty good too.", "author": "Joy W."}

I had no idea what to expect which made the experience all the more fun. \n\nStart with the balada, a crispy pancake served with addictive curry sauce, or the samusa, very much like an Indian samosa. If you like spicy, they have the chili paste in the middle which I used to my heart's content. \n\nWe also tried the tea leaf salad. Made with imported Burmese tea leaves, toasted lentil seeds, ground shrimp, fried garlic, green pepper, sesame seeds, peanuts and dress, it may sound strange, but trust me, it works. All the ingredients are presented separate on the plate and then mixed by the server in front of you! It's crunchy and super flavorful. Something I'll never be able to recreate myself so yet another reason to return. \n\nNow for the main course. Don't think twice and order the Mandalay Special Noodle.

I ordered lamb curry, and when they tried to give me beef curry I corrected them but was then told that they did not have the lamb curry option that evening. They made no mention of this when I was ordering. I picked out what I wanted instead and asked for a discount because of the trouble. Apparently we were being waited on by the \"manager\" who claimed he could do no such thing, so I handed the menu back and didn't give them my business. When they brought out the other food for the table  there was an order missing and the \"manager\" was very polite to him even though he screwed up. I am a woman and was not given nearly the same amount of respect as a paying customer. Instead, when I handed the menu back the man snapped at me about not shoving the menu in his face, which I did not do. Appalling service.", "author": "Megan G."}

What a memorable meal!    \n*****\nI. FOOD & DRINK\nIf you haven't had Burmese food before, it's another flavor-sexy-yum-yum Southeast Asian cuisine that has curry, noodle and rice dishes as well as salads and soups with their own unique twists. They also have drinks that you can order while waiting and eating that are pretty outstanding. Their cooks and bartenders slay, yo. All delicious!\n\n*Samusa: Burmese style samosa/ sambusa filled with a meat and veggie filling with a nice kick to it. Wonderful appetizer to start off with, and I totally recommend it.\n\n**Sizzling Shrimp: A bell pepper, shrimp, and spice orgy that comes out on a hot iron-serving skillet. Pretty good. \n\n**Mandalay Special Noodle: Slightly al dente flat noodle with beautiful coconut chicken, spicy yellow peas powder, fried thin noodle on top, with a touch of lime juice -- it want to stuff my face with this everyday.\n\n***Coconut Ice Cream: It was like an adult wet dream.... Not to get weird or anything. \n\nII. SERVICE\nEven though they were super slammed and  a few hiccups occurred, they held it down like pros.\n\nIII. ATMOSPHERE/ D\u00c9COR\nIt's festive with awesome Burmese artifacts and paintings that didn't come off as corny. I'm definitely feeling the vibe. Music isn't overly obnoxious, either.\n\nIV.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-11", "description": "My wife and I tried Mandalay for lunch as part of a group of a dozen or so, none of them Burmese, but two of them regulars at the restaurant.  This was, as far as I recall, my first experience with Burmese food; certainly, at least, the first in many years.  I was favorably impressed.\n  \nThe restaurant is a typical Inner Richmond storefront; the interior is done up in dark wood and yellow-green paint.  Decoratively rather \"busy\"--there are dozens of what appear to be Christmas tree ornaments hanging from the ceiling.   We were seated immediately, though several in our party had not yet arrived and a sign at the entrance said they wouldn't seat a party until everyone was accounted for.  Drink orders were taken at once.  Several of us, including my wife, ordered flower tea, which I gather is something of a house specialty:  hot tea in a stemmed glass, into which a large flower bud of some sort is placed, and gradually opens.  Clever, though the flower is more a matter of presentation than flavor.  Indeed, presentation is a strong point of Mandalay; everything had great visual appeal as it came to the table.\n\nWait staff were friendly and efficient.  We encountered no language difficulties.\n\nChopsticks (plastic) and Western silverware are both at every place setting.\n\nWe sampled a number of unfamiliar dishes recommended by the two regulars, all of them good to excellent.  Our browsing included:\n\n- Rainbow Salad--a colorful mix of some 20 ingredients, including noodles,  in a simple oil dressing.\n\n- Green Papaya Salad--shredded papaya, onion, cucumber, and tomato, plus nuts and something of the bacon family, in a peanut-y, mildly spicy dressing.\n\n- Mango Salad--Similar to the papaya, but  of course sweeter.\n\n(Other salads on the menu include ginger, tea leaf, and chicken.)\n\n- Balada--A bread that looks rather like Indian naan, but which has a layered, flaky texture, and is served with a mild peanut sauce.\n\n- Basil Spicy Pork--Chunks of very tender pork in an only mildly spicy yellow curry sauce.  \n\n- Pumpkin Pork Stew with Sour Mango--Another clever presentation; the pork curry, similar or identical to the spicy pork above, is served using a small scooped-out pumpkin as a bowl. \n\n- Basil Spicy Eggplant--Vegetables in a slightly sweet/tart sauce, gaining a certain amount of heat from red pepper flakes.\n\nSurprisingly, rice is not included with the entrees, though white or coconut rice can be ordered separately.\n\nThere are a number of lunch specials in the $10-$12 range, and lunch combos at $12.50 to $15. \n\nThe beer list is small, about eight items, of which the only one new to me was Myanmar, from, of course, Myanmar.  This was a 650-ml bottle of what turned out to be a rather bland blond lager; well, one more brew for my life list, but not something I'd be likely to order again, especially at $9.  Next time (and there /will/ be a next time, though the place is a bit far from us), I'll just stick with the old reliable Singha.  There's also a wine list, but no hard liquor.\n\nThis being the Richmond, street parking is scarce, and is limited to two hours even on the unmetered side streets.  And the two hour limit is apparently enforced; someone, presumably a parking enforcement officer, marked our tire while we were in the restaurant.  For anyone coming from within the city, public transportation might be a better option; they're right on the 1-California MUNI line.", "author": "Alan F."}

Originally we were planning to go to that other Burmese place, but they were closed, so we ended up at Mandalay. I hoped that Yelp was right and the food would be just as good. Turns out, I think it's better (and possibly more authentic).\n\nHere's what you should order:\n1. Tea Leaf Salad - To be honest, I'm not as into Tea Leaf Salad as everyone else seems to be, but it's very flavorful, super unique, and bound to impress.\n2. Mandalay Special Noodles - There's a rule that if something is called [Name of Restaurant] Special [Dish] you should probably order it because it's probably awesome. Definitely satisfies the rule here.\n3. Balada - Because I am a sucker for things that consist of a fried carb and curry. And because the curry that comes with this is possibly better than all the other curries on the menu (save it!)\n4. Coconut Rice - Not technically a dish, but I'm a big fan of the coconut rice they serve here.\n\nWe tried a few other dishes on the menu and they were also pretty great, so you probably can't go too wrong here. The staff is also super friendly and helpful so ask for recommendations!

Not too sure if the tea leaf was just too strong but what I did enjoy was the basil chicken, and the Mandalay noodles which were my favorite. The noodles had a yummy coconut milk flavor and the basil chicken was extremely tender. Sooo yummy! \n\nFor dessert, the mango sticky rice was an obvious choice and  not sure if it's because I love sticky rice or if I just love the combination of warm coconut rice and mangos. Can't wait to come back!", "author": "Shelly W."}

Mandalay seems to be the most pricey, upscale, and easiest to get into of the three. That's not super my scene, so I'll probably default to Burma Superstar - or B star, if they have a line (unless someone else is paying, of course ;) )\n\nThe good news is that the food is outstanding. We tried the Mandalay Special Noodle, which was just amazing - bursting with flavor. It was a large amount of food but we polished it off because it was so good. We also got the Lamb Rangoon, which was super delicious. The only downside being portions aren't quite as big as the competition, either. \n\nWould I come back? Maybe. But I'd go to either of the other two, first.", "author": "Chris S."}

We ordered the mango chicken with a side of coconut rice, the Mandalay special noodles and a fish filet dish. The flavors are so unique yet so comforting. I can't even explain it. It blows my mind. The mango chicken is not too sweet and pairs really well with the coconut rice, which is the best coconut rice I've had. It's moist and fluffy and I could eat this everyday of my life. The Mandalay special noodles is the best! It is a must try. It's a whirlwind of different flavors that work together so harmoniously. It blows my mind. I've been to many Burmese food places, but they take the W on this one. Hands down, the best noodles ever. The fish filet dish (I don't remember the name) had bell peppers, onions and had a soy saucy kind of sweet sauce. It was also very good.\n\nThis is my go-to for Burmese food. Service is good, but this place is popping during dinner and weekends. I recommend that you call ahead of time. But seriously...I will gladly walk 6 blocks for parking just to enjoy food from Mandalay. Obviously parking is a nightmare in this area, but the food is so worth it.", "author": "Em P."}

I tried the mango chicken, Mandalay beef, coconut rice, tea leaf salad, and dry pan-fried string beans.\n\nMango chicken was deep-fried, but soggy because of the large chunks of mango, and there were peppers but no spiciness.  Mandalay beef was deep fried and sat atop slices of oranges and lettuce, which also made it a bit soggy, but this was the best dish of my selections.\n\nCoconut rice was a bit mushy, but average.  Tea leaf salad was very peanutty and a bit bitter.  Dry pan-fried string beans also seemed a bit soggy, and though the description states there is chili sauce, it was only faintly spicy.\n\nOverall, PASS on this place, and go to the slightly more expensive and way more crowded Burma Superstar half a mile away--they have the flavors and textures down.", "author": "Vanessa O."}

I do have one major qualm re: what happened the last time we were here, and that is a problem with the service. We were a huge table (14 of us) and while I completely understand that we would not get our food all at once (they were making it to order one at a time - I appreciate that) but they could have reassured some of us that had to wait that our food was on the way. Some people at out table got second dishes before I and my partner were served at all. We had to watch people eat for at least 15-20 minutes before we got our food. \n\nSecondly, I ordered a drink which did not come until more than halfway through my meal. If I had not been in such a large group and did not want to upset anyone else at the table, I would have told them to take the drink back when it arrived as it was simply too late. Oh, and we reminded them about the drink at least twice but it made no difference. \n\nI was kind of surprised at the lack of sensitivity re: the service.

The marketing helps too, with names of dishes branded to sound captivating and exotic (\"Rangoon Three Ingredients\"...how enticing!)\n\nThey feature a number of well-known Burmese specialties like nan gyi dok (Burmese pad Thai) and tea leaf salad (probably the most famous Burmese dish thanks to social media pictures of this photogenic salad). Some dishes are more pan-Southeast Asian like Singaporean style noodle (that neon yellow noodle dish that most people aren't familiar with). Menu prices are somewhat above average with entrees over $10, but then again that's rather standard for SF nowadays. We have made an interesting observation that the portion sizes for carby dishes like noodles and fried rice are significantly larger than the meat/veggie dishes--important to keep in mind so you don't fight for parking in the Richmond and sit through the waiting time for much-anticipated Burmese food only to go home hungry, because the non-carby dishes are really quite small. \n\nTEA LEAF SALAD (salad prepared with imported Burmese tea leaves, toasted with lentil seeds, grounded shrimps, fried garlic, green pepper, sesame seeds, peanuts & dressing): More bold than most tea leaf salads I've had, probably because there's no lettuce to dilute the flavors. However it also means that the pungent taste of the fermented tea leaves and lemon zest is quite strong, so it's best enjoyed as a shared appetizer. My friend got it as an entree and was unpleasantly surprised by how it became progressively salty and sour, but when sampling small bites you'll appreciate the aromatic complexities.\n\nMANDALAY SPECIAL NOODLE (Burmese flat noodle with mild coconut chicken, yellow peas powder lime juice, onion and fried thin noodle on the top): Pricier than the other noodle dishes, but special indeed! The combination of mild spice, coconut, and yellow pea powder tastes similar to nan gyi dok, except the lime juice makes more interesting and the fried noodle topping really stands out--the tantalizing contrast between the crunchy noodles with the soft rice noodles soaked in coconut milk was perhaps the most memorable part of the meal. In my opinion there is way too much cilantro though--reminds me of when my mom buys too much fresh parsley and adds massive amounts to everything--it threw off the balance and made it too medicinal-tasting (I'm adamant about finishing my veggies, so my solution was just to suck it up and mix in more of the cilantro first so I could enjoy the rest of the noodles afterwards).\n\nCOCONUT DRINK: Haven't had young coconut since my childhood, so getting the coconut at Mandalay was very satisfying and refreshing. They give you a spoon to scrape off the bits of coconut on the inside, but I wish they gave me a fat boba straw so that I could slurp up the coconut pieces along with the juice.\n\nService was friendly and there's a notable Burmese-themed decor throughout the restaurant. However the ambiance was perhaps too authentic, because it was a bit stuffy and the humidity was reminiscent of summers in Southeast Asia.", "author": "Edna C."}

It also has cucumber slices, ground split beans, and mixed in with a tangy but sweet dressing.  I've also ordered this both times I came here so I highly recommend this dish. \n\nThe Mandalay Beef here reminds me of a better version of Beijing beef I'd order at Chinese restaurants.  The Mandalay Beef is fried beef slices, sauteed with garlic and hot sauce.  I love garlic and spicy food, so this was definitely one of my faves. \n\nThe Mandalay Eggplant here is amazing!!  It has the same flavors as the Mandalay beef, but I especially love the crunchy fried outer layer of the eggplant and the soft inside.  This is cooked so perfectly!\n\nI would want to come here every time I'm in the city!", "author": "Stacey K."}

It is some of the best Burmese food in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nWe have been to this restaurant many times over the years.\nThe last two times I ate here, I felt rushed.  A few weeks ago, we celebrated our wedding anniversary and we were so rushed through our dishes that there was no more room on the table to put the food and yet they were pushing to make room.  They need to let people eat their appetizer first, before bringing on the next dish.  As my husband said, they would probably have put the plates on our heads, if they could have.\nI ate here last night.  There were two wait staff standing behind my chair as we finished to leave.  I couldn't even push back, because one of them was standing behind my chair...saying how much they appreciated our business.  I had to say excuse me, but can I get out?  By the time, I made it to the door, our table had been cleared, prepared with silverware and the next customers were on their way to it.  By the way, we weren't that far from the front door.  Maybe 12 feet.\nMy recommendation to the management here, is to slow down.  Your food is good, but I do not want to be rushed when I am out for dinner.", "author": "Nick H."}

Move you along to keep the $ coming in.\n\nI am a calm and composed person, but if our recent \"doctor,\" who was forcibly removed from his overbooked United flight can \"put on a scene,\" so can I.

As soon as a course was consumed the dish was whisked away.

Episode on Mandalay, it's been on my \"to go\" list and finally got to try it for dinner. Most people are probably more familiar with the other popular Burmese restaurant in the area, but the first Burmese restaurant in San Francisco is Mandalay when it opened in 1984.  For those not familiar with Burmese cuisine, it can be best described as a blend of Chinese, Thai and Indian flavors.  \n\nArriving at 6pm on a Saturday, we put on name on the waitlist and in ten minutes we were seated.  After ordering our drinks, we checked out the menu and decided on:\n\nChicken Samusas (4) - filled with ground chicken and potatoes.  A nice crispy appetizer that came with marinated cucumber slices and a mild hot sauce.\n\nTea Leaf Salad - salad prepared tableside that consists of Burmese tea leaves, toasted Lentil seeds, grounded shrimp, fried garlic, green pepper, sesame seeds, peanuts and dressing. Mandalay's version did not have lettuce, which the waiter said the authentic version did not have.  Without lettuce, the minced tea leaves was the star of dish. \n\nMandalay Special Noodle - Burmese flat noodle with mild coconut chicken, yellow peas powder, lime juice, onion and topped with fried thin noodles that is prepared tableside. Very tasty with the coconut dressing. Nice contrast with the soft flat noodles and crispy noodles. \n\nRangoon Beef - marinated beef with spices saut\u00e9ed with tomato, onions and green chili.  Beef was tender and flavorful.\n\nRainbow Chicken - pan fried chicken breast with fresh slices of sweet mango, pineapples and vegetables. Chicken was moist and the dish was so colorful with the fruits and vegetables.\n\nPumpkin Curry Pork Stew - special of the day.  This was served in a kaboucha squash. The chunks of pork in a curry sauce was tender and can be cut with your fork. \n\nCoconut rice - we ordered a couple of bowls. The coconut infused rice was so tasty.  Complemented the pork stew very well.   For the portion though, it was a little pricey. \n\nIt was a great dining experience.  The food was tasty and flavorful and the service was friendly.  Our waiter was very helpful in describing the dishes and giving recommendations.", "author": "Al L."}

We came here on a Wednesday evening around 7:00 and were seated right away-- but make no mistake, the place was nearly at capacity. In fact, shortly after seating is, our server moved us to another table in order to accommodate a large party that had just walked in. We are vegetarian and we ordered the rainbow salad, the Mandalay naked eggplant (which was more sweet than spicy), and the Mandalay special noodle. Everything was fresh and delicious-- we particularly enjoyed the lightly pan-fried eggplant dish in a thick sauce. We were happy that when we told our server that we were vegetarian she immediately told us which noodle dishes had fish sauce in the noodle base paste so we could choose accordingly. We enjoyed the Mandalay noodles and would totally order again-- it's unlike other Chinese/Thai noodle dishes in taste.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-06", "description": "I love Burmese food! Being a fan of Burma Superstar, I was surprised to hear from locals that Mandalay is better. I had to find out for myself if the word on the street is true. \n\nFor those who haven't had this cuisine, Burmese food is almost a cross between Thai and Chinese. Everything is better shared family-style so you can try different things. Here's what we got for a party of 4 and a child:\n\nTEA LEAF SALAD---This is not your typical vegetable salad. It consists of tea leaves, grounded shrimps, peanuts, fried garlic chips, lentil, and sesame seeds. For me, Burma Superstar wins on this category because they add lettuce on top of all the ingredients. I love how everything tastes but it's just missing more greens. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandalay-san-francisco?selected=r0FEz-SqT4DO5AMAcvl3Bw#u_t9gYO8MEKgNIT68YcRUA\n\nMANGO CHICKEN--- Sauteed with real mangoes, onions, and chili, the chicken is pan fried and has a sweet mango glaze. Imagine orange chicken but this one's their mango version and way better. Superb dish! It's really the cubed mangoes that sealed the deal for me. I highly recommend! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandalay-san-francisco?selected=r0FEz-SqT4DO5AMAcvl3Bw#17BOkoSzDI8I79abcNyzFA\n \nPUMPKIN PORK STEW--- Wonderful presentation! Served inside a pumpkin, the stew reminds me of a Thai dish (more like a Panang). It has that beautiful sweet and sour aroma from the pumpkin and mango with a slight hint of curry spice. It tastes phenomenal! Add some sauce to your rice and you'll get hooked! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandalay-san-francisco?selected=r0FEz-SqT4DO5AMAcvl3Bw#xBe97etm16eiI1bIC1bohw\n\nRANGOON BEEF--- Marinated beef sauteed with onions, tomatoes, and chili. Almost like Mongolian beef, if you will. Delicious and flavorful, it's perfectly paired with their coconut rice. Yumm! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandalay-san-francisco?selected=r0FEz-SqT4DO5AMAcvl3Bw#D4YsirXdYpZNA6FBgfVT-A\n\nMANDALAY SPECIAL NOODLE--- We ordered this with fried tofu instead of meat. Prepared with coconut milk and lime juice, this refreshing and flavorful noodle dish is probably my favorite here! The marriage of flavors worked together like magic. MmmmHmmm! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandalay-san-francisco?selected=r0FEz-SqT4DO5AMAcvl3Bw#9ODcI5FPpDD6Ojj53AeCFA\n\nCOCONUT RICE is the only way to go for a perfect pairing to all the dishes mentioned above. It's pretty much white rice cooked in coconut juice or milk. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandalay-san-francisco?selected=r0FEz-SqT4DO5AMAcvl3Bw#4yc_h4-I4I2ox38Tj07z4A\n\nOh and don't forget to try their GINGER LEMONADE. It reminds me of a ginger ale without the fizz. A bit on the sweet side but nothing a few drops of water can't fix. \n\nThe restaurant was packed when we came but the wait didn't take too long. Their turnaround is fast because everything is quick. SERVICE is efficient and everyone here are all smiles. Very nice staff! It almost feels like they're one big happy family.  \n\nWould I come back? Definitely! Mandalay and Burma Superstar remains my top two Burmese restaurants.

You then dish it to your own plates. Despite being crunchy (fried garlic, peanuts, etc) it was soggy with oil. TWe had Singapore Style Noodles. They were decent but not particularly memorable. We also had the Basil Spicy Pork. This also seemed oily though not to the extreme of the Tea Leaf Salad. Again, tasted okay but not any \"wow\" to it. We were asked how spicy we would like our dishes and we said medium. They came out quite mild.

Light and not overly heavy or sauced as some Asian noodle dishes tend to be. \n-Tea Leaf Salad: Great version of this. The texture was just as important as the flavor. \n-Mango Chicken: Probably our least favorite, but not horrible. Basically mango and chicken as expected. \n-Walnut Prawns: The walnuts weren't as good as other places I've had it, but the prawns were large and pleasant with the sauce. \n\nAtmosphere: crowded, but clean.

The food never fails to impress, the service is great, and most of the dishes are on par with Burma Superstar (and the wait is way shorter!). \n\nThe Tea Leaf Salad is a must if you're here for the first time. Watching them mix the ingredients is a mesmerizing and oddly therapeutic experience in itself. The salad doesn't look that appetizing and appears more like a concoction that should be smeared on bread, but don't be afraid to try it! Great texture and the combination of spices is insane. I prefer the version that includes lettuce and it feeds more people if you're sharing. \n\nThe Mango Chicken and Mandalay Chicken are two of my favorites dishes here. The Mango Chicken is definitely one dish that Mandalay does better than Burma Superstar. I've also had the Burmese Curry Lamb which is tender, rich, and earthy, the Rainbow Shrimp,  and the Mandalay Special Noodles - all delicious as well! The portions are on the smaller side, but they end up being the perfect amount of food and the quality of the dishes makes the price more than worth it!\n\nWhen it's really busy, the service can become a bit sluggish, but during slower times, I've experienced some of the best service here; very genuine, friendly, and attentive.

Luckily, many of the tables were finishing up and paying their bill, so we didn't have to wait too long (~15 minutes). We ordered the following:\n\nMoo Hin Nga - Delicious, creamy catfish chowder. It came with a side of cilantro and lemon to garnish as you please. There is an option to add noodles. We opted for noodles which were a nice addition to the soup.\n\nBurmese Curry Beef - Big, tender chunks of beef and potatoes in a dark, flavorful curry sauce. Would have like for it to be spicy, but we just ask for chili sauce on the side. We had this with the wonderfully fragrant coconut rice topped with fried garlic.\n\nMandalay Special Noodle - This came with the ingredients separated and the server mixed everything at the table. This dish was on almost every table, so definitely order this. Loved the variety of textures, the creaminess of the coconut, the silkiness of the rice noodles, and the different flavors.\n\nWe were already stuffed at this point, but decided to look at the dessert menu.

I'm a Myanmar-American -- born and raised in America. Grew up eating Burmese food cooked by my parents and old ladies. I've also been living in Myanmar for the last 4 years and eating actual Burmese food pretty much every day. \n\nMandalay Restaurant does not serve real Burmese food in the slightest. This will come as a shock to a lot of you who swear by its \"authenticity\" and quality. I'm really not saying this to piss people off -- as an American, I sympathize (e.g. \"Chinese\" food in America tastes nothing like actual Chinese food in China). But Mandalay Restaurant is largely serving a kind of Chinese-American food with some Burmese touches. The tea leaf salad is probably the closest to the real thing, but not really. The Nan Gyi Thoke (big noodle salad) is a joke; it's not remotely close to the real thing. Almost all of the other food items on the menu are not really Burmese food at all.\n\nNow nailing down what Burmese food is in a country as diverse as Myanmar is an impossible task -- samosas are in Myanmar, toshay is in Myanmar, faluda is in Myanmar, all Indian influence from the British colonial era. But they all have a Myanmar spin given how long they've been extant in the country. There are also ethnic nationalities' cuisines that are significantly different than Burmese cuisine -- Rakhine seafood, Kachin rice wine, etc. It's all incredibly delicious and I recommend you try it one day.\n\nBut none of that is served at Mandalay Restaurant. Or Burma Superstar, for that matter. Which is cool, they are good at what they do -- but don't call it authentic.", "author": "Michael L."}

Food options are very similar, lines are not as long, but service is definitely slower.\n\nThe Mandalay Special Noodle is my absolute favorite! There's great flavors and textures in this dish. The flat rice noodles are nice and chewy. The chicken is moist and tender. The fried thin noodles on top add a bold flavor as well as crunch. But what I love the most about this dish is the sauce -- the creamy richness of the coconut sauce pairs perfectly with the more subtle, citrus-y lime juice.\n\nNan Gyi Dok noodle dish is a close second. It's similar to the Mandalay Special Noodle, but spicier and more acidic because lemon, rather than lime, is used. The rice noodles are just shy of undercooked, because I find them to be too chewy.\n\nThe chicken mango is delicious! The dish as a whole is sweet, sour, and a bit spicy. I love the fresh and soft (but not mushy) yellow mangoes. The chicken is moist, tender, juicy, and the batter is so crispy. There's a great balance, proportionally, of ingredients in the dish -- chicken and mangoes are plentiful and onions aren't overabundant.\n\nThe tea smoked duck is dry, unfortunately. The flavors are good -- smokey and salty -- but the fact that the meat is dry and doesn't fall off the bone easily made eating it unenjoyable. The dish also comes with buns, scallions, and a sweeter version of Hoisin sauce.\n\nThough I always order tea leaf salad at any new Burmese restaurant I try, I wasn't a huge fan of Mandalay's version. Yes, tea leaf is the main ingredient, but I thought the flavor was so strong compared to the dried shrimp, dried garlic, seeds and nuts. I had to \"look\" for the other flavors in this salad, but all I could predominately taste was the tea leaf.\n\nMandalay is spacious and accepts reservations for groups of five or more people. There's large, circular \"family-style dining\" tables, as well as plenty of smaller tables and booth-seating for four or fewer people. I love all the ornaments handing from the ceiling. Overall, there's a nice, warm, and welcoming feel to Mandalay. Service is very friendly, but a bit slow. Food takes a while to come out of the kitchen, and when the restaurant is packed, sometimes the wait staff confuses orders. Nevertheless, I prefer Mandalay slightly over Burma Superstar, and will come back here to satisfy my Burmese food cravings. Also, parking along California St. is easier (and not metered) compared to Clement St.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

I was sad that the other tables next to us were seated after us and they got two of their dishes before we ever got any of ours :/\n\nWhat we ordered:\n--Tea leaf salad - Love nutty and crunchy salads but I do wish they included shredded cabbage/lettuce bc it offers a crisp and fresh taste to tea leaf salads. This one was more hardy and a bit more stringent. Next time I want to try the banana blossom salad! \n--Mandalay special noodle - Very good! It's made of flat noodle, coconut chicken, yellow pea powder, some kind of fried crunchy noodle...I loved the kick of the sauce. Think this was my favorite dish this out of the four I tried this trip.\n--Dry pan fried string beans - this was ok. It was a bit oily and a bit too salty for my liking. I expected it to have a little bit of a crispy crunch to it like the ones at Chinese restaurants but it was more limp.\n--Balada with curry dipping sauce - pretty good. The pancake is buttery and more chewy than flowery. It's carb yummy. The curry dipping sauce was kind of watery so it was dripping all over once I got my piece to my mouth. I do prefer dipping sauces to be more rich and dense but the flavor was there (Burmese curries are a bit more on the mild side).\n\nLast thoughts:\n--I've been here twice. 1st time was my first time trying Burmese food and I was blown away. But after trying other Burmese places, feel like I still have yet to find a go-to Burmese restaurant that offers more bang for my bucks (average price per dish here is ~$12).\n--Almost no Asian ppl here..why??\n--Overalls, good food, relatively fast service, good portions; would recommend this place to a friend", "author": "Jade Z."}

At first it feels a bit watery compared to others I've had, but once I add some cilantro and lemon in there and tasted the soup more closely, I think it's quite perfect. Super perfect would be some rice vermicelli added in there! But then it wouldn't be just a soup. Hence, it is a quite perfect soup. The Kaw soi dok noodles were a delicate yet chewy texture with just the right balance of flavors with a tiny spiciness, it had some crunchy lentils(?) in there- Overall, the flavors and textures were complete. Pancake itself was okay, but the curry sauce for it was really good. Tasted some fish in there which added another layer of wonderful flavor. Tea leaf salad was very very crunchy with lots of roasted peanuts; it tasted really fresh and not too salty (some places' are way too salty), only bad thing was that it just too much peanuts for me. Four dishes and the three of us were completely satisfied and satiated, we even took a doggie bag with two slices of pancake and a couple bites of kaw soi dok to go!\n\nAmbiance/decor: nothing quite like it in SF I'd have to say. The lighted fake Palm tree near the door was rather interesting. Interior was well decorated with plants and busy with paintings (?Fabric elephants) and statues/sculptures(?). Sorry, it was so busy in there and I was so taken by the food I can't recall! \n\nService: super friendly staff. Our order was correct and food came out pretty quickly. Despite the fact that the three of us squeezed into a table that normally fits two, we made it work, carefully stacking and rearranging our plates and glasses to fit everything. Staff came by quickly to help us clear whatever we didn't need often so we didn't feel too uncomfortable.\n\nOverall, great food and a wonderful experience. Will be back again.

It could pass for any number of cities that are not quite world class but medium in size and status.

Like the 10th arrondissement of Paris, or that ally street I took in Istanbul while searching for the spice market.

Beautiful presentation. \n\nBurmese curry with shrimp - the gravy was rich, tasted of tomatoes and onions (no cream) - shrimp cooked perfectly, sided with slices of cucumber, tomato and steamed/seasoned broccoli. \n\nSizzling shrimp - on a platter with peppers, onions, water chestnuts, a sweet glaze. \n\nIt was all phenomenal. Coconut rice was very tasty, too. Try the ginger mint lemonade. The Burmese iced tea was like Thai tea. \n\nI'd go back in a heartbeat next time we're in the area.

As I've browsed through many Asian restaurants on Yelp, many of the Burmese restaurants in SF came to the top of the search. We saw a couple highly rated ones (Mandalay, Burma Super Star, etc)-- but we chose to go with Mandalay since Burma Super Star seems to always be busy.\n\nMandalay is a cozy restaurant, with great service. The waiters are attentive and welcoming, and best of all-- the food was BOMB :)\n\nWe ordered:\n\nTea Leaf salad\nMango Chicken\nBurmese Curry Beef\nSingapore Style Noodle\nSmoked Tea Duck\n\nThe Tea Leaf Salad was one of the best things we've had that night. When it arrived at our table, I was surprised-- I didn't see a single leaf in this salad LOL. It was a bit confusing, and I was asking my friend, \"Uh where are the leaves?\" And she pointed out that the tea leaves are the dark substance that was fermented. Sounds gross, but the \"salad\" was so good-- it was a mixture of lemony, crunchy (lots of peanuts in there), and spicy-ish. Definitely a unique dish.\n\nEverything else we had was great too, especially the Mango Chicken and Singapore Style Noodle. I wasn't that impressed with the Smoked Tea Duck though, because the portion was really small.\n\nMandalay is a great place to dine in and experience authentic Burmese food, but in my opinion, the portions are on the smaller side.", "author": "Grace H."}

The ingredients are higher quality and the flavors seem more balanced and delicate.

Despite the food being extremely popular here and delicious, this is about the customer service which so happened to be short on proper hospitality. \n\nFirst off, we made reservations early on in the day and the host clarified we were in for 7pm. We got here 10 mins early and had all members of our party in attendance. We still had to wait an HOUR and watch as they let walk-in groups bigger AND some smaller than ours get seated. Luckily the host approached us and asked if we'd like to order before we're seated so we didn't have to wait any longer.\n\nWhen the food came, the first few dishes came in order. Right after the 3rd dish/appetizer was served, the server dropped food on one of the individuals in our party. Good thing our friend had a sense of humor about it. Our server also did not check on us but once during our dinner. As soon as we'd get through about half of the dish or dishes, random servers seemed to want to clear the table and continuously came back even though it was pretty evident we were still working on our food (Seemed like they were almost rushing us to finish even though we waited an hr with reservations and yet only about 30mins elapsed since we were seated, did they run out of plates in the kitchen?) At the end of our dinner, the customer service was pretty unsatisfactory.\n\nFood was about 7/10. Didn't wow us. The food was comparable to other Burmese food around the Bay Area, but to each their own according to personal preference.\n\nAmbience was great. Soft music in the back ground, proper lighting and decorations.\n\nAgain, despite the food and restaurant itself being satisfactory , it all came down to the customer service which was poor.. \n\nTry it yourself maybe you'll have a better experience.", "author": "Aaron B."}

I knew of Burma/Myanmar, but never really stopped to think about what the cuisine would be like. Always ready to try new foods, I jumped on the opportunity. There are actually two Burmese restaurants located in the same area, so be sure to go with Mandalay! It is hard to miss, with a bright yellow exterior and a green awning. There were many dishes to choose from, so we let our hosts handle the ordering. Of the dishes we got the most memorable was a tea leaf salad. This is a new concept to me: a salad with dried tea leafs, some dry lentils, and other more common salad ingredients. Each bite had a mix of crunchy and soft, as well as tang from the dressing and a characteristic tea taste expected of the leaves. I also really enjoyed their lettuce wraps with chicken. We got a beef dish as well as chicken skewers, and a couple noodle dishes. I would say that Burmese food is a mix of Chinese, Thai, and Indian flavored to make something unique and worth trying. On this occasion we did not dine-in. We picked up food and ate at home, but while I waited at the curb I noticed that Mandalay had consistent foot traffic and people hopping out of Ubers. I highly suggest eating here as all of the dishes turned out to have a new and refreshing twist to the more run-of-the-mill ethnic cuisines we are used to in the States.", "author": "Vats A."}

Even before asking about drinks he was very direct that we should order appetizers. We were not interested but he kept insisting. He even took my menu out of my hands while doijg it, showing what he meant to my friends on my menu and ignoring me completely. When the appetizer pushing did not work he asked about drinks. My friend wanted a diet coke but he was not having that. He kept pointing out other, more expensive, drinks. She had to keep telling him she just wanted a diet coke. When I just stuck to water he tried persuading me to have coconut water instead and was not pleased I did not want it. As I said.

So much flavor, so crunchy, so many wonderful things happening. Next up was the coconut chicken soup, and it was the best version of this classic I've had so far. For my entree, I had the Mandalay Special Noodles, which is a giant, colorful, flavorful plate of Burmese flat noodles. mild coconut chicken, yellow pea powder, lime juice, onion, and fried thin noodles on top. Our server squeezed lime on top and mixed it right in front of me.

It was different from the usual noodles -- apart from the usual savory and spicy flavour, there was also a bit sour and a bit sweet. The smoked tea duck was served kind of like Peking duck, with a smokier flavour, and the string beans were crispy and savory. The tea leaf salad? Same old, very similar to what other places offer. I was really disppointed with the curries though. First, the pumpkin curry was way too watery, and there were not a lot of chicken. Second, the lychee prawns, while pretty, was served in a very small portion. It only had 4 prawns, 4 lychees, and some pineapples!\n\nWe seemingly ordered quite a bit of food, but it ended up being just enough.

Lots of green and red bell peppers, carrots, and green beans. It's a palatable and aesthetically pleasing dish that I recommend to anyone, not just non-meat eaters.\n\nMy friend had the Mandalay Special Noodle which was Burmese flat noodle (similar to a Linguini style noodle), mild coconut chicken, lime leaves, fried onions, lemon juice, and cilantro. The chicken was tender and cut into tiny pieces. I liked the freshness that the lemon juice added, but the lime leaves were bitter so I picked around them after trying a bite with noodles and chicken. \n\nThe wait staff is friendly, the restaurant is a bit tacky decoration-wise (Christmas ornaments hung from the ceiling and light fixtures that look like they came from one of those stores in Chinatown where you're like, who would ever in their right mind buy one of those?), but it's not an art gallery, and I come for the food, so no harm, no foul.", "author": "Crystal C."}

The Mandalay Special Noodle and the Balada are also good!

Wish I could give it 0 stars.\n\nWe made a reservation through Yelp and didn't get seated until 15 minutes after even though our table was available. There is not front door welcome staff to speak of when you get there. I had to flag someone down and let them know we were here.\n\nWe had a party of 9 and they jammed us into a table meant for 6, and in the middle of the restaurant.  When we moved the table to allow one of us to sit on the end, they made us move back. Because of our \"large\" party in the middle of the room, I was also ran into by a person in a wheelchair, twice.  ADA and the fire department should really look into this situation.\n\nThe food. Don't be fooled, go to Burma Superstar instead if you want Burmese food. I don't know what the Mandalay cooks were doing but everything was overcooked. Here's what we ordered:\nTea leaf salad - bland, too many peanuts.\nRainbow Salad - prepared ahead of time as the noodles were soggy sitting in the fish sauce\nFried Squash - thick batter\nTea smoked duck - Very dry and did not come with enough buns for everyone\nWhole Cod - smothered in sauce and overcooked. \nPumpkin pork stew - very little pork.\nShaking beef - Small...and sour.\nMango chicken - Panda Express orange chicken is better...by a lot.\n\nOh coconut rice experience. So we ordered 4 bowls of coconut rice and they brought it in a rice container. When I asked for a refill, they said, \"this is not coconut rice\". I wondered what the hell this could be then? After a few minutes, they brought out 2 small bowls of coconut rice. Something so simple should not be an issue.\n\nLastly, we were celebrating my wife's bday. They charged us $10 for cake service. All they did was bring out plates and played happy birthday over the LOUD speakers. They did not actually serve or cut the cake. I think charging $10 is pretty ridiculous for plates.

What I lack in my geography knowledge is made up for in my eating skills. \n\nI've been waiting to review Mandalay (what claims to be the first Burmese restaurant in SF) until after trying both this place and Burma Superstar (what seems to be the most popular Burmese in SF). I ordered similar if not the same items from both restaurants to get an equal comparison and I have to say, while both were pretty spectacular I think I gotta go with Mandalay. \n\nWe ordered the Nan Gyi Dok, Rainbow Salad, Pumpkin Pork Stew, fried green beans, and coconut rice. Each dish was stellar. The rainbow salad (20 ingredients in this salad) is more noodley than veggie but the flavor combo is so unique. The Nan Gyi Dok is a coconut yellow curry with chicken and rice noodles. I had this at Burma Superstar too and the Mandalay version is  tastier IMO. The green beans was the surprising dish of the night. I mean, what could be so special about green beans? But really...they were super crunchy and had this salty-sweet-spicy thing going on.There's even dried ground shrimp mixed with them which sounds nasty but I seriously could eat these green beans everyday. While the presentation of the pumpkin pork was impressive (it's actually served in pumpkin!) it was actually kind of disappointing. It was good but Burma Superstar served a much larger portion since the pumpkin leaves less room for the stew. In addition, the meat here was a little bit tough (BS's pork was so tender!) And the pumpkin shell isn't cooked so you couldn't eat it. Never serve something on a plate that can't be eaten (I learned that from Chopped on the Food Network...lol but I totally agree! All that pumpkin put to waste!)\n\nOverall Mandalay has a more relaxed ambience, more space, and friendlier/more attentive staff. I think the prices were a bit cheaper as well. Now if only I could get them to deliver to Fresno I'd have a real winner....", "author": "Miriam M."}

I'm not sure how different Burma Superstar is, but my meal at Mandalay blew my mind!\n\nTea Leaf Salad - must have, DUH! I usually don't like crunchy things, but I really loved this salad. The peanuts and other crunchies (should've paid more attention to the guy when he was explaining) added texture to the \"salad\". I like that the flavors were simple and underwhelming. You kind of have to go searching for it instead of having the flavors just hit you. A nice refreshing start to the meal.\n\nSamusa Soup - Pretty standard soup, but very hearty, which was great on a misty evening.\n\nPan Fried Prawns with Okra - I love love love okra, but it's not a popular item. But first, the prawns were very fresh and cooked tender. The sauce was spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. I like the balance of sweet and spicy. The use of garlic and scallion is very Chinese in a way, which I love (so nostalgic)! The okra was cut into big pieces and cooked to just the right texture. It wasn't too tough or too soft. The slimy factor that most people dislike was at a minimum (I don't mind though).\n\nSpicy Eggplant - I love eggplant so I'm always curious how many different ways it can be prepared. Of all the dishes we had, this was my least favorite, but that only means the other dishes were SO good! I usually don't like stir fry dishes drowned in sauce, and this one was. It was sweet, sour, and spicy - a little too many big flavors for my taste. But it does go very well with rice.\n\nMandalay Special Noodles - this was my favorite of the evening! Thick warm noodles tossed with coconut chicken and a creamy lemongrassy sauce and some caramelized onions. It was just amazing. Get this!\n\nTea Smoked Duck - they brought the duck with sweet bean paste, scallions, and buns, which reminded me of peking duck! It was very exciting. The duck is actually crispy, unlike peking duck. If you eat the duck without the sauce, it's actually not that salty. I prefer peking duck over this duck, mostly because I'm not a huge fan of crispy things. But with the sauce, scallion, and buns, it was delicious!", "author": "Sherry L."}

What are you? Who am I? Why haven't we met before? How could I have lived my 29 years of life without experiencing the heaven that is your delectable Burmese cuisine? My tastebuds are aching... longing to reunite with you once again but sadly there is nothing like you in my city.  I am so sad and confused. Why me? Oh, the humanity!\n\nShall I liken thee to a summer's day? If I had to describe you, you would be the beautiful marriage between intense Indian flavor and spicy sweet Thai staples. Two of my favorite cuisines, yet even they do not do you justice. You, my sweet Burmese Beauty, offer an array of seafood, meat and vegetarian options that are packed with the seasoning and taste comparable to nothing I've tasted.\n\nWe tasted an array of dishes during my last night of my most recent trip to San Francisco. Tea leaf salad (presented as a colorful appetizer plate of grains, nuts and other lovely things with varying textures and tastes) which mixed together to create bursts of vegetarian bliss. The Balada.... Wow! It was pretty much a Burmese quesadilla, pancake, or whatever you want to call it. Flat warm, soft, and came with some impeccable sweet spicy dipping sauce. We finished off with a spread of curry prawns (one of my favorites), mango chicken, coconut rice, samusas (similar to Indian samosas) that literally had me researching flights to Burma with every bite.\n\nTop off it off, the service was fantastic! The owner (Sherry) was sweet, helpful, attentive and generous. She went out of her way to charge my dying iPhone in the back during our entire meal, and brought my colleague a fried banana sundae to top off our amazing meal! Now that is going above and beyond. \n\nSo there you have it. The best meal of my life. My newest discovery and latest obsession. We don't have Burmese food in Dallas (that I know of), so until I can save up for a flight to Burma (or at least San Fran again), I now need to learn how to recreate some of these dishes myself (wish me luck)!

Nothing special. Mango chicken was mostly mango with fried chicken bits and served in a very small portion, especially for the price. We got a rainbow salad, too. Again, the portion was tiny. \n\nThe worst part of the experience was the service. My friends and I felt like we were being hustled from the second we sat down to the moment we walked out the door. First, there was long-ish wait. No huge deal for a Saturday night. But as soon as we were seated, we were rushed through ordering, eating, and paying by a rotating crew of 4-6 servers and managers. Also, there were 3 of us -- we ordered 3 main dishes, 3 orders of rice, along with a drink for each of us. We weren't super hungry and just wanted to try the place. As another reviewer mentioned, we were upsold HARD and pressured to purchase an additional entree. The server said \"Well, you're only getting 3 entrees. That won't be enough. You should get green beans, too.\" We replied that an entree per person would be fine for us, thanks. She persisted, insisting that we order green beans because \"the portions are tiny and you will be hungry.\" We said that we'd start with the three entrees and order more if we needed. Her reply, unbelievably, was that we would regret that because \"by that point, it will take a long time for the food to come out and you will not get it in time\", admitting that their service/kitchen is slow and that their portions are inadequate (you'd think one entree plus rice would be fine for an adult meal) and trying to shame/scare us into ordering more than we needed. Bizarre.\n\nAs we were wrapping up our meal, it became clear that they wanted us to get out as soon as possible. I understand that turning tables = profit, but we were not finished eating. I think someone stopped by our table every 2-4 minutes on average to ask if we were done and/or to try to take away our clearly unfinished plates of food. Finally, the woman who tried to upsell us came back to the table and forced us to choose who was going to finish each dish (\"which one of you is going to finish this one off?\" before emptying the main platter onto someone's plate), serving us against our will and taking away all the other plates on the table. I ended up eating some more off a friend's plate once she took away mine and the main serving dishes. They wanted us out badly, and it was clear that the servers were trying their best at hiding the fact while tag-teaming to try to get us out. \n\nFinally, our bill came with a few surprises. We ordered a large soup to share among the three of us. She brought us three TINY bowls of soup and indicated that she had divided the large bowl for us into smaller portions since we indicated that we wanted to share. When the bill came, they charged us $21.00 instead of $12.50 for the soup and claimed that we ordered 3 small soups at $7.00 each instead of one large for $12.50. First, there was no $7.00 small soup option on the menu. Second, how on earth could you justify charging $7.00 for what amounted to a half cup of soup? Third, we simply didn't order that and asked them to remove the item and charge us only for the one large soup we ordered. The guy seemed unsurprised (likely because this has happened before, based on previous reviews) and simply removed the charges, replacing them with the original $12.50 for the soup. \n\nThen, looking at the updated bill, we realized that they had DOUBLED the price of our lemonades and tea. When we looked at the menu to verify, we noticed that there was a disclaimer at the bottom of the last page indicating that \"Prices may change at any time for any reason with no notice\". I guess that means that prices can change between the time you order and the time you pay? \n\nAt that point, we were so exasperated and shocked that we just paid and got out of there as fast as possible. If the prices weren't so ridiculously high, especially for the quality of food and service, and if the servers and billing were both honest, I would shrug it off. But this place is NOT worth the expense or the headache, and I would warn anyone eating there to triple-check their bill for hidden charges before paying because they clearly do this to others, based on earlier reviews. I won't visit this dishonest business again.", "author": "Alex K."}

It's a bit of a trek for us from the Castro, but worth the visit.\n\nWe've visited Mandalay on random days and times-- the restaurant always seems half-full, but I've heard it gets busy during dinner. The place is permanently decorated for Christmas, with plenty of lights and ornaments hanging from the ceiling. Not fancy, but not divey either. \n\nWe usually start with a Burmese beer at the Tea Leaf Salad, which can be made vegetarian. As is customary, the salad comes with all its components piled on a plate, and the server will prepare and mix it in front of your eyes. It's really hard to describe the flavor of a tea leaf salad, but it's a perfect mix of texture and flavor that we usually finish it all.\n\nThe menu is very straightforward and grouped by protein, much like other Asian restaurants. Walnut Broccoli and some sort of Noodles are the usual orders, and you must get the coconut rice. I've loved the coconut rice at other restaurants, and at Mandalay, it is so yummy-- served with fried shallots on top. The milky coconut just adds another dimension to what would otherwise be plain rice. It's something I actually find myself craving.\n\nMandalay has a charm about it that is backed up by amazing flavor. While other Burmese restaurants have a lot of hype, I'm happy to say that Mandalay is the place I have had repeat visits to, and I intend on continuing.", "author": "Bryan B."}

The staff does a reasonable job trying to keep the line moving so even with the large crowd when we arrived we managed to get seated within about 20-30 minutes, no reservations.\n\nThe food was good but not superlative.  We started with the famous tea leaf salad, a unique dish that is mixed up in front of you at the table.  Really interesting flavors and something distinctive about coming to a Burmese (Myanmarese?) restaurant.  With a side of balada (slightly cripsy pancake, a bit like buttery naan that is a bit crispy) it was a really nice way to start the meal.\n\nUnfortunately our entrees did not stand out (to me) as particularly unique.  I'm no expert on Burmese cuisine so as far as I know they were done just right...but the sense I got from my wife's red curry okra with fried eggs and my spicy naked eggplant (had to get it with a name like that) was of good quality Indian and Chinese food, respectively.  Again, the quality was good and I was happy with the food but it didn't stand out as a particularly unique experience...was similar to what we would have tasted in a good quality restaurant of either of those ethnicities.\n\nIt's not a complaint really, and the starters made the meal interesting.  But I am not in a rush to return since I've now checked the tea leaf salad off of my bucket list and the food was good but not great...I'd go back if the line was short but would not want to wait that long again.", "author": "Alan S."}

The water didn't have enough ice to make it cool, but I liked how you could really taste the lemon. The Mango Lassi is what we usually get. The Burmese iced tea is basically Thai tea, which never goes wrong and the young coconut was good too. The Samusa is yummy and worth a try. I think coconut rice here is one of my favorites compared to other places. We had the Tea Leaf Salad and it was delicious, different from your normal salads. The pan fried string beans were amazing, considering that I never eat them but I think it was the seasoning. The Mandalay Noodle was also different, but it's worth a try. The curry lamb with potato was good. The Smoked Tea Duck wasn't bad either, but I'd probably skip it and try other things. Lastly, the Pumpkin Curry was okay, I didn't find it to be anything special.

My point! Mandalay delivered a meal the other night that was Wonder of the World-worthy. Lucky you, San Franciscans, to be privy to experiencing it on the regular. I hear that some places serving up Burmese cuisine have such high demand, you have to wait hours for a table. The good news is that Mandalay accepts reservations, but even if you don't make one, there's a good chance for you to experience the magic sans fast pass.\n\nFor starters, the flavor and textures in the tea leaf salad are a riotous joy in my mouth. Oh the crunchiness! Oh the spice! Next time, I can't see myself not ordering this as my main course. for as much as I loved the Mandalay Special Noodle with tofu dish, I kept at that salad that I was supposed to share, only I probably ate the entire thing. I just... can't... stop thinking about it. I love how they come over to the table with the modest looking plate, all the ingredients delicately arranged with the tea leaf paste in the middle and mix it all there right in front of you. Nuts, spices, tea leaves... who woulda known this as a potential gastronomical delight??\n\nThe environs itself is similarly decadent, an abundance of altars laden with fruit and deities;  lit up palm trees decking the corners. If they know it's your birthday, expect a serenade. Cuz that's how they roll.\n\nIn closing, my first encounter with the incredible cuisine of Burma has left me with a deep, deep longing, baby. I am bereft for I currently reside in a city where there is nary a single Burmese restaurant. Give me tea leaf salad or give me death!!! I might perish with longing.", "author": "Joi B."}

(I love Burma star!) we dropped by about 12 on a Monday and we were seated immediately. The food is amazing !! We had the tea leaf salad, mohingga fish soup, and one of the lunch specials - it was a roti with a small bowl of chicken potato curry. I had a jasmine flower tea.  Excellent service, excellent food. If anything, I consider it slightly more home style Burmese. The chicken curry was on point. The tea leaf salad could have been padded out with some lettuce or more tomato , but instead it was  all savory and texture - crunchy garlic , fried chickpeas / lentils, crunchy peanuts, delicious tea leaf. They brought a little tray of lemon wedges and cilantro for the table, which I love. And the mohingga!!!!! Piping hot and the perfect soupiness! Very impressed. Highly recommend !", "author": "Jasmine l."}

Have made the mistake of not looking at Yelp photos of dishes before ordering ones from a new cuisine in the past, though, so I did my research beforehand last night!\n\nWhat we had:\n- Samosa soup: nice flavor; light and refreshing. Boo made a good point, though - that's it's overpriced for what it takes to make the thing, but still delish. We ordered one serving, and they brought it out for us in two bowls.\n- Balada (pancake with curry sauce): this was beautiful, with just the right amount of moisture and crunch, but I was expecting something slightly more interesting. For Chinese food lovers out there, the consistency is similar to that of a scallion pancake; I thought it'd be flakier, for some reason. The curry sauce was relatively light, with a touch of sweetness.\n- Tea leaf salad: amazing. Beautifully prepared, and so scrumptious to eat! When it came out, I wasn't sure it'd be quite enough food, but all those nuts and beans make for a filling dish.\n\nI wasn't entirely sure this would be enough for two people, as they're lighter dishes, but it was the perfect amount (we also ordered coconut rice, which I didn't eat, and I was still full!). Definitely high quality stuff, with attentive service, and a really cool interior to the restaurant. And of course, being the oldest and definitely legit Burmese joint in the city, it was packed.\n\nEager to try out some other Burmese places, but I'd definitely recommend this one to anyone who hasn't been. :)", "author": "Shendi X."}

Over the past few years prices have gone up considerably and portions have shrunk drastically. I recently ordered two soups to go (~ $13 per soup). The portion for each was around 1.5 cups, giving me the impression that they confused my order with two sides of soup. Nope, that wasn't the case. The portions have literally become that small. On to the mango chicken I ordered. I thought I ordered chicken with mango sauce, but rather it seemed to be cubed mangoes with a spattering of chicken. 80% of the dish was literally cubed mangoes. In the past, I would've easily given Mandalay 5 stars without thinking twice. However,  I'm giving this place 1 star as it really pisses me off when a business decides to cut corners in order to increase profits.

I mean super nice. I ordered the noodles and a coconut tapioca drink. First my drink comes out - a tall glass of coconut milk with small tapioca balls (which I expected) and a big straw. The drink is really too thick to be a drink and is more like a liquid dessert. It's pretty good when I think of it that way though there are chunks of stuff in it that I can't identify (coconut?). Turns out I also get a small cup of the soup of the day (corn soup - ok) and now I'm getting worried I won't be able to eat my noodles because I'm too full already.\n\nThe noodles arrive in a deep bowl, the kind with the holes built in for chopsticks. Except the noodles are piled so high in the bowl that the chopsticks are dirty and not usable. I assume they're just decorative and use the ones that are a part of my place setting. But the biggest problem with the deep bowl is that all the ingredients are distributed evenly and I can't mix them up together - it's just too unwieldy. So I feel like the noodles could have been really awesome and I just wasn't able to combine it properly. I actually didn't realize this until I ate my way further down and discovered new ingredients. I think this would be better served in a large shallow pasta bowl. I know this is a weird complaint.\n\nOverall the food was good but not great.

Both menus overlap on a lot of dishes, but not sure how or if they're any different taste-wise.\n\nGood luck with parking. It took a couple of rounds before I could find a spot that I could barely squeeze into.\n\nWe had the Mango Salad for starters, I had the Mandalay Special Noodle, and friend had the Rainbow Prawn with jumbo prawn. Things duly noted were the crispiness of the pickled mango slices and the dressing, not too light or too heavy. Definitely a great appetizer for two. I got bored of the noodles after a couple mouthfuls. The only thought I had the entire time was that it tasted just like MAMA instant noodles. Not very special. I didn't have the prawn, but by the looks of it, jumbo definitely wasn't jumbo, or they just have very small prawn. The friend definitely didn't get her fill for 20 bucks.\n\nService was just as boring. Slightly friendly, but could've used some pizzazz. I did, however, find a nickel under the table next to ours.

When the food finally arrived it was not worth the wait.  Pea shoots were tough and fibrous, oily, and not cleaned well.  I had a nice bite of sand while trying to enjoy them.  Mango chicken was unimaginative and poorly executed, with spongy chicken, little spice, and under ripened mango.

I was a bit nervous as I turned onto California from Fisherman's Wharf to bring a full carload here. I hoped that NOT choosing C-town was going to be appreciated by my passengers (Ma and Pa included).\n\nIt had been, thus far, a pleasant and  memorable Saturday, Angel Island's 100th anniv. commemoration, an afternoon of warmth and remembrance.  I was emotionally moved by a deep sense of identity and pride for those Chinese who were detained at their own Ellis Island. There were several points in which my jaw grew taut, and I found myself swallowing some tears at the injustice, discrimination, and utter loneliness of my kinsmen.\n*******\nOh Mandalay...why were you just OK? My new friend, Cindy W., nailed this review, as far as I am concerned. In so many regards, even though we chose different entrees, my sentiments were hers. The overall experience was pleasant, but I would hesitate to make a repeat visit here.\n\nBurmese food: a somewhat tamer version of Thai, with the imported fermented green tea leaves a big sell, both at Burma SS and here. \n\nOrdered the following for 5:\nTea leaf salad (9.5)\nCatfish soup (Moo Hing Nga) (9.5) \nSpecial noodle (housemade noodles) (9)\nBurmese lamb curry stew (11.5)\nPumpkin pork stew (10.5?)\nLychee Coconut prawns (12?)\nCoconut rice\n\nI've tried this kind of salad before; Mandalay does not use any lettuce. Heavy on the sesame taste, and for some reason, the tea leaf flavor was found lacking and its flavor did not shine forth. Fish soup was definitely interesting texture and overall, quite nice, although, again, the flavor of the catfish was not the 'melody' here either.\n\nApps aside, our entrees were definitely above average. Portions here were on the scantier side of things (i.e. stews were just a hair filled above half the bowl), which made me sensitive to people having enough food (and great, there was a chef among us....ahem... not.. me). Though there was flavor in the food, I had hoped for so much more. Having had proper Burmese only twice before, it was difficult for me save relying on the trusty palate of yours truly.\n\nThe lychee coconut prawns: this dish did not work, and I so wished that I had read another reviewer's notes beforehand. The prawns are smaller than medium size, and felt the pairing did not go together, no. Pass.\n\nCoconut rice: I know what fresh rice tastes like, and each time they charged us for another order of it, it just didn't taste fresh. Course it was weighted with the heaviness of coconut milk, but c'mon, i'm no chump ABC... I have a discerning eye and hard to believe the 'fluff' would be completely absent with the milk.\n\nService was prompt, courteous, unobtrusive, and efficient. Restaurant is in a quieter neighborhood and much easier to find parking. Decor is clean, nice use of their space.  \n\nDinner ran $70 something and a cool tip of $15. So sorry; I would like to have elevated my Yelp a bit more, as you were so accommodating, but I cannot do it.", "author": "Jana C."}

It just has so much charm... and a lot of flavor too. Be warned - it gets crowded. If you're going during peak hours on a Friday / Saturday night, be prepared to grab a beer and wait, especially if you're with a group of four.\n\nDefinitely go family style. If it's your first time, you have to get the balada. You also have to get their special noodles that they mix up for you at the table. That's half your meal - now just pick a protein and some rice, and you're good to go.\n\nI have literally been impressed by everything I've eaten there. I was with a friend there this past week, and he ordered fish curry soup... I have to be honest that I found that to sound a bit gross, and if he weren't visiting from out of town, I probably would have told him to pick something else. Alas, the fish curry soup was delivered, and it was amazing. I'd say it was the highlight of my meal.\n\nThere's a certain place a couple blocks away that gets all the hype ~ I shall not mention it by name!

Plan on waiting for at least a half hour especially for parties of four or more. Once seated, service is fast and attentive. One must have is the Burmese tea salad. Difficult to explain what flavors are in the dish, but it is exotic for the normal palate full of different flavors and textures. Interestingly, the salad is prepared table side, staring off with what lies like a collection of seeds a green paste, but when mixed, the taste is addictive. Same with the saut\u00e9ed green beans. Definitely taste shrimp paste in this dish and serves as a great side dish for the mango chicken. Tender cuts of saut\u00e9ed chicken complemented with chunks of sweet mango. I really enjoyed my first experience with Burmese food and hope to come here again.", "author": "Kris B."}

We came on a Friday night around 6:30-7ish and only had to wait 5-8 minutes for a table for two, before getting seated. By the time we were done with our dinner, their entire waiting area was filled with people. Looked like at least a 45 minute wait. Restaurant is very cozy, with not a lot of space between adjacent tables. Perfect eavesdropping opportunity. \nAnytime I eat at a Burmese restaurant, I always have to order the tea leaf salad. Mandalay's tea leaf salad was good until after taking a few more bites, I started noticing the strong scallion flavor and it was a little too much for me. I think Burma Superstar's tea leaf salad is a lot better. Also tried the Mandalay noodles. The crispy noodles added great texture to the dish. The last thing we ordered was the mango chicken.

I called Mandalay ahead of time and they said that they would have a table read for us right away. We get there and we have to wait for 15 minutes, which was not too bad. But we sat right in front of the kitchen door at a table the should have only sat three people comfortably but Mandalay stuck five of us there. There was not enough room for all our plates and glasses of water. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nappetizer -- Chicken Satay\nsalad -- Tea Leaf Salad (lap pat dok)\nsoup -- Jia San Hinga (black pepper soup)\nentree -- Rangoon Beef, Mandalay Chicken, Mandalay Special Noodle\n\nMaybe we ordered the wrong dishes but a majority of the dishes were bland. The only dish that I would think about ordering again is the Tea Leaf Salad and the Mandalay Special Noodle. Both were the highlights of the night. The Tea Leaf Salad is an acquired taste but worth giving a try to see if you like it or not. The Mandalay Special Noodle tasted like it had a milder version of an Ong No Kaw Soi soup poured on top of noodles and it was so yummy. The chicken satay was dry and tasted like processed chicken breast. Also, there was a piece of hair stuck on one of the satay skewers. The Jia San Hinga, Rangoon Beef, and Mandalay Chicken could have been ordered from any Chinese restaurant. They did not taste bad, I just expected something more flavorful and authentic. \n\nThe service was average. The waitress was really nice and gave us a new Chicken Satay appetizer after we pointed out the hair. She also spoke Chinese. \n\nOverall, I was disappointed with Mandalay. I expected so much more, since many Yelpers said it was better than Burma SuperStar. I have had Burmese food from friends who are from Burma. I would just go to Pagan on Clement or Burma SuperStar next time I am feeling the urge for Burmese food.\n\nTwo stars since I did like two dishes and the waitress tried to make sure that we were comfortable with the extra small table.", "author": "Andrew W."}

If it's longer, skip it and save it for next time.\n\nSide comment on their service at Mandalay: though it's obviously over-capacity, the owners/servers never lost patience with the customers like most Asian restaurants [unfortunately] do. They did the the subtle nudges encouraging you to decide on the orders prior to sitting down, pushing for you to then put in all orders at once (reinforced with subtle threats: \"I guarantee you it will be an hour wait!\"), and having the servers flocking by every thirty seconds or so to swoop away any unused or empty china, ALL WITHOUT PISSING ANYBODY OFF.\n\nHow do they do that?\n\nThe atmosphere is great. The decor is casual and very local Burma-esque, but the dim lights, foreign customers, and loud rumble of conversations made by 50% more people than allowed int he room, make Mandalay seem almost chic and hip.\n\nFood ordered:\nMandalay Special Noodle\nMango Chicken\nTea Leaf Salad\nString Beans\nMandalay Naked Eggplant something\n\nOkay, two superstars of tonight's dinner are the tea leaf salad and the stir-fried eggplants. Let's save those for last.\n\n1. Mandalay special noodle: flat rice noodles tossed in an assortment of spices, nuts, and lemon juice topped with crunchy fried noodle pieces. Refreshing, complex in flavor with the myriad of spices, fried shallots, and coconut juice. But dull in comparison to other dishes. This tastes a bit like Taiwanese tan-tan noodles mixed with coconut milk. Strange.\n\n2. Mango Chicken: ok all I got was salty. The mangos are nice and firm, their sourness a nice offset for the salty chicken.\n\n3. String Beans are string beans.\n\n4. Tea Leaf Salad: fried garlic slices, tea leaves, peanuts, lemon juice, tossed in front of you. This is like getting a face full of burma thrown in your face. The ground tea leaves add a slight bitterness to the salad, while fried garlic added sweetness and some kick. This probably would not be a dish for you if you are not into very spice-intense dishes, but definitely worth the hype.\n\n5. Eggplant: anybody who likes eggplant would love this! Large pieces of eggplant first fried then stir-fried, so it's crispy-almost-going-to-get-soft on the outside and so soft and creamy on the inside.\n\nDefinitely has become a new favorite just after one try.", "author": "Chia L."}

Six pieces of crispy, but not greasy, samosa with curried ground chicken and potato. The wrapper is very thin and the filling very tasty.\n\nRainbow salad ($9.5) is prepared with twenty ingredients neatly arranged in a square plate. The waitress explained the ingredients, which include two kinds of rice noodles, chili powder, crispy fried garlic, diced potatoes, tofu, dried shrimp, fried onions, green papaya, roasted chilies, crushed yellow beans, cilantro, won ton chips, cabbage and a tamarind dressing, before mixing the salad for us. This is an explosion of flavors and textures to whet your taste bud. It tastes even better than that of Burma Superstar.\n\nBasil Chicken ($9) is a bit of a disappointment. While the chicken is sauteed with fresh basil galore, the gravy is too thick and sweet, almost has a sweet-and-sour flavor.

We ordered the samusa, tea leaf salad, kaw sol dok, and maybe another dish. The tea leaf salad was very authentic. It does not come with lettuce, cabbage, or romaine. After it was mixed, we both could smell the sesame. It tasted very very good and yummy. Other dishes were good as well. We really enjoyed dining here. Honey and I will come back to try other dishes.", "author": "Allan W."}

Serving staff was nice enough.  Rainbow Chicken, although sounded great in how it was described, was nothing special and i thought chicken was dry.  The special rice with raisins & cinnamon was served lukewarm.  The Burmese Iced Tea was the best part -- tasted great and served in a fun, VERY tall glass.  The prices?  Yes, definitely better than Burma Superstar.   Only taking away 1 star at this point as i will prob give them a 2nd chance.   But another reviewer said that, with Mandalay, why bother eating Thai?   Well, at this point, I still prefer my fave Thai places to this.", "author": "Merrick W."}

A friend recommended this place to us, so we went. \n\nFirst off, it's really hard to miss, because the outside is BRIGHT YELLOW AND GREEN. It was beautifully hilarious. The inside has lots of decorations, which I was very smitten with.\n\nThe service was great. They were very friendly and prompt. When I was ordering, the waitress even suggested that I get something else, and it was a great call on her part. I ended up getting the Mandalay Eggplant, which tasted HEAVENLY. I got the Balada, which was SO good, and HUGE. And I got a side of coconut rice, which went perfectly with the eggplant dish. I was so sad when I got full.

I figured they would be slammed, so I ordered early for take out.  I did some research as to which dishes to try, and here is the list and my thoughts:\n\n*Samosa Soup- AMAZING, possibly my favorite! Great texture in the soup and the broth tastes so good! \n*Balada- Tasty fried bread.  Happy I tried, yummy, but next time I will pass\n*Pumpkin Curry Pork-Usually do not order pork but decided to try something different.  The pumpkin is heavy and creamy. Good but next time I would skip. \n*Special Noodles- Possibly better to eat at the table where it is mixed for you by the staff, I think I did a shitty job of mixing it, but it was a tasty sauce and interesting ingredients. \n*Mandalay Chicken- A total cowd pleaser.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-07-29", "description": "Years ago, when it wasn't as well known, I liked Mandalay quite a bit.  Although their versions of my Burma Superstar favorites could never quite compare, their food was still pretty decent.  Throw in the fact that the wait (if any) was always rather short, and they were a solid alternative to Burma.  Now that they've started to develop crowds of their own though, Mandalay has lost a bit of its shine for me.  Why did you have to get so popular?!\n\nAfter not coming here for a couple of years, I somehow ended up at Mandalay twice in ten days.  Random, I know.  Between the two trips, we ordered: Mandalay Chicken, Mandalay Noodles, Ginger Salad, Samusa Soup, Chicken Samusas, Basil Beef, Rainbow Salad, Tofu Kebat, and Walnut Broccoli Chicken.  Of those, the salads were probably the best, with a slight edge to the Ginger Salad (exactly the same as Tea Leaf Salad but with ginger instead of tea leaves).  The Mandalay Noodles were really flavorful once I removed the cilantro (blech), and I thought the Walnut Broccoli Chicken was a surprising highlight considering the non-traditional ingredients.  Although it can't compare to Burma Superstar's, the Samusa Soup wasn't bad, and the Mandalay Chicken was tasty, even if it's essentially like a sesame/mandarin/orange chicken-type dish.\n\nOn the flip, the Chicken Samusas, Basil Beef, and Tofu Kebat were pretty disappointing.  The taste of the Samusa was just average, and my friend noted the one he ate was lukewarm at best in the center.  The Tofu Kebat dish was really plain overall, and it tasted pretty bland for something that's supposed to be spicy.  It wasn't nearly as disappointing as the Basil Beef though.  Seriously, they could have changed all of the ingredients and it still would have tasted the same with all that sauce they threw on there.  It's especially painful that it was the one I had ordered to share.  Whoops...haha.\n\nService is okay - they gave out free beer the first time while we were waiting because it was so hot out, but the second time, even though we had reservations, we ended up waiting as if we had walked in and put our names down.  With the food not being as good as I remember, and with the difference in wait time smaller than before, I think I'd rather just go to Burma Superstar and tough it out.  The time saved isn't enough to overcome the difference in food.  Sorry Mandalay, you got a little too popular for your own good.", "author": "Mike L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-02-17", "description": "I absolutely adore the food (especially the Tea Leaf Salad) at Burma Superstar and it's sister restaurant, B Star Bar. Seeing as both those restaurants can be crowded, I wanted to experience another Burmese restaurant. \n\nAfter doing research on Yelp, I decided on Mandalay because of its positive reviews and seemingly spacious interior. However, when I arrived with my BF on Saturday, I was greeted with a stuffy atmosphere, to the point where we both had a headache standing in the waiting area. Even after we were escorted to our table, the nauseousness failed to subside because of the lack of personal space. Each table was too close to its neighbor. Seeing the popularity of the restaurant, I can see how the owners wanted to accommodate as many diners as possible. However, the strategy made for a discomforting environment. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nTEA LEAF SALAD: What I love about Burma Superstar's Tea Leaf Salad is the complexity of the flavors, how all the different ingredients add a different kick with each bite. This could not be said for Mandalay's Tea Leaf Salad. I had read online beforehand that this particular salad contained \"no filter,\" meaning it contained no lettuce or cabbage to curb the tea leaves. However, the lack of greens gave way to another overpowering flavor: peanuts. All I could taste in the \"salad\" was peanuts. Highly unappetizing.   \n\nMANDALAY SPECIAL NOODLE: Burmese flat noodle with mild coconut chicken.\nI'm not sure what I was expecting from this. I'm a sucker for anything with thick noodles so I went with the \"special\" on the menu. This had really little flavor besides coconut milk and salt. There was a hint of the spice from the lemongrass but,  overall, nothing memorable or \"special\" about this dish.\n\nWe weren't the only ones unimpressed with our meal that night. The table to my left side complained to the owner about their fish dish, calling it overcooked to the point of being inedible. The table to my right had some issues in the timing of their dishes being brought out. It appeared that they assumed the waitstaff reversed their orders and were going to bring the salad at the end of the meal, but actually forgot it altogether. \n\nBottom line: I would skip this place and go to the tried and true Burma Superstar, or its equally good counterpart, B Star Bar.", "author": "Sophia V."}

Really glad we made reservations. We were running 30 minute late, so we gave them a call. They were nice enough to hold the table for us even though the place was packed. \n\nWhen we got there, they were offering other guests drinks for the long wait time. The servers and hostess were all very pleasant. The only thing I would warn is that they love to up sell you on their menu items. We ended up ordering way too much food. I would probably order one less dish based on their recommendation. They also seemed disappointed that we didn't order any alcohol. \n\nOnto the food. It was superb. Definitely one of the better Burmese places here. My out of town family all really enjoyed it. \n\nCoconut rice - This is a must order like many others have mentioned. \nChicken satay skewers - Beautifully displayed. Good sauce, but the chicken was a bit dry. \nPumpkin curry - This was very very delicious\nEggplant - awesome and so much better than expected. Must order as well. \nMango chicken - This was good, but was not expecting a salad. \nTea Leaf Salad- Good, but not as good as Burma Super Star. \n\nWould definitely come back for a casual meal.", "author": "Winny F."}

Again, no noodles in a dish traditionally served with noodles.\n\nTea Leaf Sald (Lap Pat Dok) - agree with other reviews that it is slim on the portion and missing the thinly sliced cabbage to compliment the texture of this hallmark dish\n\nGreen Papaya Salad - Not bad, just missing that je ne sais quoi compared to home and other BA Burmese restaurants.\n\nBurmese Style Noodle (kaw Soi Dok) - again, the same as green papaya salad not bad but I've had better...the combination and proportion of ingredients is just as important as the ingredients themselves...and they miss it here.\n\nBurmese Curry Beef (DO NOT CONFUSE WITH MANDALAY OR RANGOON BEEF) - the traditional burmese beef curry stew if that is what you are specifically looking for - we had to ask the owner to make sure it was  what we wanted...phonetically spelled \"Ah me tha si pyan.\"  Home run here!  With a little more dry chili pepper, it was perfect!\nNOTE*** they have 3 dishes that could be mistaken for the traditional burmese beef curry stew, THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT - not Mandalay or Rangoon beef.\n\nMay come back if having a craving and in SF, but prefer my go-to restaurants in the Bay Area.", "author": "Eddo C."}

My friend and I passed by Mandalay a couple of times, so thought I'd try it. First of all, they don't seat you until your entire party has arrived, which I think is fair. We tried a couple of items: tea leaf salad, mandalay beef, coconut curry shrimp, and coconut rice. Tea leaf salad had nice flavors, maybe too much peanuts. I wish they had put some leafy greens in the salad to balance the abundance of nuts in the dish. It felt like eating a dish of tea flavored trail mix. Maybe that's how it's suppose to be, but I prefer some iceburg or something. Anyway moving on. The Mandalay beef tasted like szechuan beef to me. For a signature dish, I was expecting  it to standout. But all I can think of was why it tasted like szechuan beef?  I would much prefer to go to my favorite Chinese restaurant for that. The curry shrimp was not memorable. The shrimp was overcooked. The shrimp portion was laughable. It was petty French portion, but unlike a French meal where you know you have 3-5 courses to follow, you only get your overcooked curry shrimp. Service was fine until towards the end of the meal. Four servers came within a span of 10 mins to ask if we were done. I understand that they want to turn over tables quickly, but we were not done eating. It made us feel rushed.

Mandalay Special Noodle:  normally I'm not a huge coconut fan, but it works in this dish.  The cooked noodles and the crunchy noodles complement each other in texture, and the chicken is always tender and nicely flavored.  \n3.  Mango chicken:  the sauce on the chicken is so delicious.  The mango chunks aren't always the sweetest, but that's not always a bad thing given it's a savory dish.\n4.  Dry pan-fried string beans with tofu: just get them.  Seriously.\n5.

So funny.\n\nI am from Mayanmar, the Karen tribe (not Burmese tribe) but \"Burmese food\" is actually Mayanmar food and the 12 major tribes all eat similar diets that you may sample when you go to Mandalay. Mandalay is the oldest and first Mayanmar restaurant in the U.S. and they live up to their expectations of being the best by far in comparison to all other Mayanmar eateries.\n\nGo with a small group Maximum 8, make a reservation and request the round table if you are a party of 6-8.

The number of waitresses also caused some confusion, when we asked for something we would then have to tell another waitress the same thing a couple of minutes later.  Sometimes, even with all these waitresses, my friend had to gently wave at someone to get their attention, which took a while.  Oddly enough, it also took a long time for someone to take our order.  There was one super sweet smiling young man who came to our table twice, he was the best, I wish he had been our waiter the entire time.  I think this is one aspect they need to change, as one does not like to feel rushed (especially when arriving so early!), or have to repeat the same thing several times, or get beef when ordering lamb, even though it was still delicious.

But this was just the appetizer. And to say the appetizer is the best part of the meal, doesn't say much about what's coming.\n\n- Mango chicken - surprisingly bland. It did not have much flavor for my liking. Thank goodness there were spices they put on the table beforehand. I slaughtered the mango chicken with the spices and this did improve the dish. However, it still was a disappointing dish.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we get our check and a \"no rush, but there are people with reservations waiting.\" Hmm, really?! Well we waited for 45 minutes! That was a bit rude I thought.\n\nMandalay - not worth the wait and doesn't live up to the hype. Balada is great though!", "author": "Junel S."}

There's even a shrine to Buddha inside!  My bf and his family are Burmese and the fact that they instantly approved this place (and the fact that my bf discredits Burma Superstar) says something.  The bf's parentals did all the ordering and everything but the curry was so yummy and filling! \n\nTea Leaf Salad:  They bring it out with all the ingredients separated on a plate and they then mix everything right in front of you.  I definitely liked the tea leaf salad here more than at Burma Superstar.  BUT I must say it is not the best I've ever had (Yamo's is better).  Still, it is worth trying here.\n\nNga Pe Dok (Burmese Style Fish Cake Salad):  This was my favorite salad.  It can be quite overwhelming to some though because of the heavy use of onions but I really enjoyed the mix of veggies with the dressing and fish cake.\n\nCoconut Chicken Noodle Soup:  Another popular Burmese dish and damn good  (but it's not as good as my bf's mama's).  It was creamy and so flavorful.\n\nCatfish Chowder:  Once again, not as good as my bf's mama's but it was, for restaurant's standards, very tasty and hearty.\n\nBurmese Curry Lamb:  I wasn't a big fan of this dish because the lamb didn't taste like lamb.\n\nBurmese Curry Prawn:  I did not like this dish.  I did not like this dish at all.  Mainly because I'm not a fan of herbal curry - I like mine with a dash of coconut and with less spices just because curry in itself is already very much full of spices. And it was a very small dish.\n\nWe had most of our dishes accompanied with Coconut Rice, which is my favorite rice ever!  I really enjoyed the coconut rice at Burma Superstar which, and I hate to admit this, was better than Mandalay's just because Mandalay's was a bit gooey.  But it had a very strong and refreshing coconut taste.  YUM!\n\nOverall, very worthwhile experience and you don't have to wait a day and a half for a table.", "author": "Linh V."}

We were seated right away and greeted with warm smiles and open arms. Prior to arriving to the restaurant we had already decided what to order based off of previous yelp reviews. Haha! So it took a while for the waiter to get to our table, which was weird since the restaurant wasn't even half full and there were at least 6-7 servers.\n   Balada- This is your typical Asian style pan fried pancake. It was savory and crispy and all around oily goodness. It came with a coconut curry dipping sauce that was a bit milder than what I'm used to. This is definitely a heavier appetizer dish.\n  Tea leaf salad- The salad had a nice presentation and a generous amount of roasted tea leaf. However, the strong flavors from the nuts and tea leaf were a bit overwhelming since I'm accustomed to there being lettuce in tea leaf salad. The flavors competed instead of compliment each other. \n  The specialty Mandalay noodles- Noodles were drenched in a chicken curry sauce and topped with fried noodles( tasted like ramen). Haha! The dish was super heavy and is def. more than enough for 2-3 people. I would advise to share this since it gets tiring really fast. \n  Rainbow prawn- Let me start off by saying that these were not prawns and only had a meager amount in the dish! I was really disappointed in this dish since I was expecting big pink prawns! The dish was just a typical veggie stir fry with a pile of over cooked and burnt shrimp on top! Def. no no!!!\n  Burmese style chicken curry- The chicken was dry and the curry lacked flavor! For goodness sake the potatoes were still hard and absorbed none of the curry \"flavor\". Definitely not worth it! \n  The drinks- Between the three of us, my sisters and I ordered a mango lassi, ginger lemonade and fresh young coconut juice. The drinks were def. the saving grace of the meal! This is rather disappointing since we expected a meal up to par with its competitor- Burma Superstar. Despite the hour and a half wait for Burma Superstar, I would much rather go there for an impeccable meal than to endure a mediocre one here!!", "author": "Celina C."}

The salad looks like crap post-mixing. We still hesitated to try even though we saw it mixed. Imagine if it was brought out like that, no one would've touched it. It was really good though! Crunchy, spicy, pungent with tea flavor. Different because the tea leaf is a paste, unlike Yamo's which is served dried.\n\nPan fried string beans: 4 stars (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IPpQnGDJVApDEM5A93txtw?select=qCU2uF8nxbJF-ZrTgtkOqA) Right amount of spices.

This place is as good as, if not better than, Burma Superstar.\n\nThere, I said it! \n\nI've been here twice in the last month, once for lunch and once for dinner.  The dishes are flavorful, the servers are friendly, and the decor is super fun!\n\nI've loved everything I tried here!  Some highlights: \n\n+ The tea leaf salad is wonderful, with many different colors and flavors and textures mixed all together beautifully.  First they bring you the dish with all the ingredients separated, describe to you the different pieces, and mix it all up at your table.  I love that kind of tableside service, and it all tastes so good!  Very fresh, indeed.  Note: you can get it with or without lettuce.\n\n+ Spicy okra prawns: WOW. Just, wow! The okra is crunchy, and the shrimp are plump and cooked very well. That spicy flavoring is AMAZING. It's just spicy enough to give the dish a kick, but not so much that it's uncomfortable. The okra is crunchy, but in a good way because it complements the softer shrimp. Do get this dish, as it is DELICIOUS.  I'm generally not a fan of shrimp or spicy foods, but this converted me!  \n\n+ Mandalay special noodles: VERY coconuty, and hearty pieces of chicken. The cilantro was pretty strong too, but I liked that.  There was a pretty mild yellow curry, balanced with the sweetness and nuttiness of the coconut, and I think there was just a touch of spice somewhere in there.  Add some cilantro for that extra hint of freshness, and some fried noodles on top for some crispiness, and you've got yourself a dish that was, in my opinion, balanced in color, flavor and taste, and texture.  Do get this!\n\n+ Nan gyi duk: Also very highly recommended!  These round spaghetti-like Burmese rice noodles have a very special texture that I'll describe as \"bounce\" in your mouth.  It's a combination of slippery and chewy, and feel firm, solid, and satisfying in texture when you bite down.  The coconut chicken is creamy and light, and the fried noodles are a nice touch.  There is a healthy amount of cilantro in this dish, which I love.  This dish is similar in taste to the Mandalay noodles, except the noodles are round and \"bouncier\" and has less of a coconut flavor than the former.  Delicious.\n\nFor most dishes that have many ingredients, the servers come and introduce the dish to you tableside, name all the ingredients, and then mix it up.  That is awesome.  The service is also quick, and dishes came out at a good pace.  If you come for dinner, they also give you a complementary sweet and tasty mango pudding after your meal.  Very cute.\n\nI must also give another point for the decor - it looks like perpetual Christmas in there, with all those ornaments hanging from the ceiling! There are also fresh flowers on every table, a very nice touch.  When I came here early for lunch, we actually saw the owner (?) coming out and changing the flowers from the vases at the tables.  Fresh flowers.  Love it. \n\nPrices are decent too, ranging from $8-10 for most entrees, and $10 and up for seafood dishes.  When I came for dinner, we each got a young coconut juice (which comes in a real coconut!), an appetizer and two entrees, and the total after tax and tip and Healthy SF was $25/person.  When I came for lunch, we ordered two entrees and the total was $13/person total. \n\nNext time you're in the area, be sure to drop by.  Completely delicious.  The prices are decent, service is good, the food is fantastic, and best of all, unlike the more well-known Burma Superstar, you won't have to wait 45 minutes for a table!", "author": "Vivian C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-02-18", "description": "Let me first start with this: 5 star food. 0 star service. All of the previous comments about disappointing service are unfortunately accurate.\n\nWait to be seated:\nFirst, we arrive and there is a line. Totally fine and there was a sign in sheet. There was minimal rhyme and reason to the sign in. I saw more than one party come in and add their name to the top of the list. No one was managing it. The lovely hostess wasn't calling names loud enough to be heard and I saw her ditch 4 parties that were standing in the waiting area. Eventually they caught on. She kept telling one party of two that they were up next. 25 minutes later they were still sitting there. Our wait was about an hour.\n\nOrdering:\nNo issues actually. Our server was very nice.\n\nFood:\nWe ordered an appetizer (Balada) and 2 soups (Hot and Sour/Samosa) plus our entrees (Fried rice/ Ginger beef with coconut rice).\n\n25 minutes later, my boyfriend's soup arrived. 15 minutes later and after he was finished, our appetizer arrived. 10 minutes after that, my soup arrived.\n\nWe sit.\n\nHis fried rice arrived. We eventually decided that they forgot my entree and I actually forgot what I ordered. 1 hour and 10 minutes (I clocked it) after ordering, my entree arrived.  While we were waiting, we looked around. I saw one waitress bring the wrong food to 5 different tables. (It was so ridiculous it was comical). Two tables down from us, there was another couple; she was done with her food by the time his came out.\n\nNow, that being said, when food came out it was piping hot. And unfortunately amazingly good. Best coconut rice I've ever had and it went beautifully with my ginger beef. My boyfriend said his chicken fried rice was the best he'd had.\n\nThe  two stars I did give them  were because the food was awesome. I can't discount that. (I would have split it 50/50 but I can't do 2.5 stars and I'm not about to round up for service that poor.) And from observation, reservations carry no weight, so don't bother.\n\nThe take away:\n*DO NOT go to Mandalay if you're in a rush.\n*DO NOT go to Mandalay if you're on a date in a new relationship (and make sure you really like who you're with because you'll be doing a lot of talking).\n*DO NOT go to Mandalay if you have any plans after dinner. You WILL be late.\n*DO NOT go to Mandalay if you have guilt feelings about not tipping after bad service.\n\n*DO plan ahead.\n*DO get take out (and plan accordingly such as to pick it up at least 20 minutes after they say it will be ready. I'm sure it re-heats well). Every single take out order we saw stood there waiting.\n*DO adjust expectations. \n\nTO MANDALAY: You have to figure out how to run the house. Your food is great, but your service is horrific. If you're going to have a list, you have to have someone managing it. Also, if the kitchen is small, you need to find a way to accommodate the  number of patrons. Also, you can't, just can't taper the delivery of food to the table. People do not want to watch their friend/date/spouse eat while they just sit there.

It's not bad, but from my experience, Burma Superstar, a few blocks up on Clement, has taken Mandalay and refined it. Yamo in the Mission has unapologetically stripped it down to the basics being served up in a small and dive-y fast food eatery that whips up fresh and tasty Burmese favorites for far cheaper, and Burmese Kitchen in the Tenderloin has added a comfortable homestyle spin to it. It all works, unfortunately just a little better than Mandalay does.\n\nWhat I do like about Mandalay, though, is that while there is a wait on weekends, it's still not ridiculously painful (ahem, Burma Superstar). They also have a nice authentic, festive vibe inside (that Yamo's is lacking). They're really nice, too -- on two occasions that I've been there, they offered complimentary glasses of wine and water to those waiting! The food is generally tasty: try the okra and shrimp dish -- super flavorful, and you can't go wrong with of course the tea leaf salad and any noodle dish. Albeit, it's all served in smaller portions than I'd like. \n\nMandalay will always have major props in my book for being a pioneer, and for that reason and many more, I hope it continues to thrive because they truly deserve it.", "author": "Betty W."}

We started off with fish cakes (chewy and delicious), as well as the fried onions (like a delicious Awesome Blossom, though a little unwieldy as the lump of onion pieces stuck together a bit). For main courses, my dad got the delicately sweet Broccoli Walnut Tofu, which was excellent. I had the special Mandalay noodles, which took a little longer to come out but were worth the wait.\n\nEverything we had was amazing and I cannot wait to go back and work my way through the rest of the menu. Either we picked really well by chance, or there just aren't many bad options.\n\nAlso: don't skip out on ordering a beverage! The \"Fresh Young Coconut Juice\" is in fact served in the coconut with a spoon to scrape out the flesh, even though that isn't explicitly mentioned on the menu. The Ginger-mint lemonade is also an excellent choice.", "author": "Jacob M."}

They push relentlessly to turn the table even when the place has not yet filled.  So the moment they remove one plate from the table the next is immediately plopped down.  There is no pacing to the meal, which turns into a race to finish you off and get you out.\n\nAs to the food, I started with tealeaf salad, which was completely overpowered by a too large dose of peanuts.  There was no subtlety to the dish.  Next samusa soup.  This was composed of two OK samusas that were crumbled into a spicy, but I thought, too thin broth.  Finally the highlight of my meal was a special of spicy rock cod and asparagus.  Yes, the aspargus were a bit underdone.  And true there were too many peppers on the plate.

The food is delicious and the service (once seated) is great. What more can you ask for? You can make reservations, but make sure your entire party is present or else they will not seat you. The place is small and when you have a big group, it's confined. It's better to order family style, that way you can try out a little bit of everything because one plate of one dish can be too much. They offer vegetarian food as well, so it's a perfect place if you have someone who doesn't eat meat. Some recommended dishes to try include:\n\nTea Leaf Salad: Everyone raves about this salad, simply because it's 'AAAAMMAAZZINNGG. It's an acquired taste for some cause you can taste the true state of the natural leaves and beans.'\n\nMango Chicken: A MUST have! Chicken is tender and the warm mango with the sweet sauce is just delicious. Try it and you won't regret it\n\nCoconut rice: the right amount of sweetness. 'Perfectly balanced and you don't get that artificial taste of some fake coconut.  It's just magic in your mouth (that's what she said)' haha\n\nWalnut broccoli Tofu: the right amount of everything! walnuts are glazed!! Broccoli is tender and tofu is firm.\n\nMandalay Special Noodle: 'There are no words for this cause when you eat it .. there is no room for talking.'\n\nThe staff is extra helpful, especially if you're a first timer.

Skimpier food portions and worsening service.\n\n1 - be prepared to wait. Don't bother w/ reservations as walk ins, especially of a larger # will be seated ahead of you. (Just for kicks, I wrote my name on walk in list and they called up to the name before us just as we got seated.) They'll even cram 4 folks into a table for 2. Their business model is becoming increasing turnover at the cost of patron experience.\n\nThe past 3 times, I've waited at least 30-40 min to get even an appetizer brought after ordering.\n\n2 - don't lie about wait time - we were seated 30 mins late of reservation, but 3 times dismissively told by female mgr we were next (as other walk ins got seated before us). For the past few visits, I've overheard people repeatedly complain about being told they'll be seated in 10 minutes that turns into 30 min.  \n\n3 - short staffing on a 3 day weekend? Don't seat people if you arent prepared. Staff were frantically running around and the usually calm servers we know we're even short tempered, rushed and got our orders wrong.\n\n4 - when you make an error - apologize, correct it and maybe even make up for it? We got the wrong appetizer and it had to be sent back. All in all we waited 30 mins from time of order to get ANY food and had been starving for an HOUR bc they were late to seating us.\n\nThe table next to us also got their order botched and waited for 30 mins to get it right.\n\n5 - rude manager when complained about errors - we asked that our appetizer be comped due to error and consequential wait. Instead of apologize, the female manager said \"well you got the right appetizer eventually right? So no, we still have to charge you.\" She then also tells us that they don't take reservations for 2 at 8p onwards. Then why did your other manager take the reservation and has done so for years?!!\n\nWe even got charged for the appetizer brought in error on top of the right app.\n\n6 - food has increasingly become saltier and more oily. Portion sizes, especially for seafood dishes have gotten skimpy - mainly vegetables w/ less than a handful of seafood.\n\nWe've been forgiving about service because they've been apologetic, corrected errors as they come and food has been good. But after today where it's clear my business and that of friends' isn't valued, we don't plan on being back... The sad part being individually, we bring out own friends and family here too.\n\nThey can keep the $9 for the appetizer because they lost at least $320/mo of business from both of us.", "author": "Jason N."}

The amount of people who want to eat here is out of control. On most Friday and Saturday nights, you will have to wait over an hour to get a table. \n\nI waited over an hour and it wasn't pretty. When I sat down, the table just so happened to be near the waiting area in the front part of the restaurant. The amount of people waiting for a table swelled so much that soon I had some old man's ass in my food and face. I had to get up and tell him to move it the fuck down. The way the restaurant is set up is a problem but I won't go there because it's not really for me to say how these folks should set up their place of business. \n\nGetting to the food, I must say I was quite sleeping waiting for such a long time to get a table. The food was not bad, all in all it was decent, the experience waiting for a table is the most problematic of all. That in itself was a huge turn-off. Another thing is that Burmese food isn't new, it isn't unique in San Francisco as there are a few other Burmese places around. Burma Superstar which is awful is down the street. Even though tons of people flock to it like they're giving away free food or something.

It also helped that Mandalay was featured on SF Gate's \"Bargain Bites\".\n\nArriving on a Wednesday evening, it was crowded, with only a party of two ahead of me.  The decor was much more pleasant to the eye and the atmosphere was much more serene...the kind of place you could take your time and enjoy a meal.\n\nThe head waitress made her way to me and asked if I had been helped yet since I had been sitting in the waiting area for quite some time.  I mentioned I was still waiting for a couple of friends.  She came back and asked if I wanted to wait at a table, which I definitely appreciated.  While waiting, I ran into celebguru c. who raved and raved about the Burmese bread that I HAD to get! \n\nIt took us FOREVER to order as the male servers told us the waitress was coming.  And the female server telling us to hold on a bit.  It seems that there's only one person, ie the head waitress, that is allowed to take orders.  So, that was very frustrating already and we were starving.  (This didn't impress my friends a bit.)\n\nWe decided to start with the Teal Leaf Salad aka Lap Pat Dok ($7.50) which is \"salad prepared with imported Burmese tea leaves, toasted with Lentil seeds, grounded shrimps, fried garlic, green pepper, sesame seeds, peanuts & dressing.\"  I enjoyed the presentation of this salad as it was mixed together in front of us.  I particularly loved the green pepper because it added a zing to each bite.  I found this dish unique and enjoyed it quite a bit.  Unfortunately, my friend was turned off from the moment she saw it and was repelled as it reminded her of diarrhea!  It tasted and looked fine to me though!\n\nNext came the Pan Fried Pompano Fish ($11.00).  The waitress deboned the fish in front of us and we helped ourselves.  The fish was tasty with minimal of bones.  I didn't particularly find this fish special, but my friends seem to have enjoyed it more.  \n\nNext to arrive was their special Pumpkin Curry with chicken. It was presented within the pumpkin/squash and it was a good thing we decided to order a side of rice.  My friend really liked this dish, and I found it average though.  (Maybe it's because I just had Thai pumpkin curry last week.)\n\nThe infamous Burmese bread was soon to arrive with a dipping sauce ($3.00).  My friend immediately pointed out that it tasted like a Chinese Fried Green Onion Pancake, but without the green onions.  After a couple of bites, I had to admit she was right about that one.  It was tasty, especially with the sauce, but not as original as I hoped.  (Sorry celebguru c. - I guess you have to try the Chinese Fried Green Onion Pancake yourself so you can compare!)  \n\nWe also ordered the Nan Gyi Dok ($7.00), which was \"Burmese rice noodle with spiced coconut chicken, split yellow pea, powder, and fried onion.\"  Once again, the waitress mixed this dish in front of us and I enjoyed the tang of this dish.  My friends thought it was alright, nothing particularly special for them.\n\nWe needed something sweet to close out our meal.  They did offer Mango with Sticky Rice, but we opted for something we never had before.  I forgot what it's called, but it had a dollop of vanilla ice cream, raisins, small tapioca balls, nuts, syrup, and jello.  The two different color (red and green) jellos reminded us of agar and those lychee things that come in little cups and some kid choked on it and now they no longer make it anymore.  It was sweet, and reminded me like I was eating a wet trail mix.  \n\nAt one point, our teapot needed to be refilled and it never came back.  When i asked the waitress for tea, she looked at me like I was an idiot.  She asked about \"tea leaf\" and I saw \"tea...teapot\" and she just didn't get it.  It took a little while for her to understand that someone had taken our teapot and never came back with it and now we wanted it.  So, that put us off a bit.\n\nThe meal cost us $57 and we ordered too much food.  We could have done without at least one dish as there was leftover fish and rice.  \n\nI did enjoy the fact that I never felt rushed when I was eating.  We were the last ones there as we had lots to talk about and not once were we asked to hurry up with our order.  (I was the last one eating from my party though when they did ask if we wanted dessert..., so maybe that one point only.)  \n\nWe were interested in the beverages, but found them to be a bit overpriced.\n\nOverall, I would give this place a solid 3.  If they took our order in a timely manner and if the girl didn't look like I was nuts when I asked her about the tea, I would feel a bit better about it.  I would definitely go back for the tea leaf salad and the noodle dish.  And yes, I would choose Mandalay over Burma SuperStar.", "author": "Teri C."}

We hoped to get there a little early to be seated first before our birthday guest for the surprise.  When we arrived, the table was all ready, but the waitress would not seat us unless ALL of us we here.  I tried to explain nicely about our surprise bday, she would have none of it.  She took us to the the sign in the entrance that explains their not seating unless all of party was present, and pointed out the actual words for me to read.  I quickly understood her message.  We then waited, while our table was still reserved for us, she went on to seat other parties and of course had to ask our large party to move aside to make room for her work.  The surprise occured at the crowded hallway entrance.\n\nWe started ordering appetizers, the waiter kept telling us to order more, which we did.  Then when we ordered the entr\u00e9es, he said the same, so we ordered an additional, after which, he said he's afraid that we didn't order enough, but really he's not trying to push anything on us...  I finally said no.\nWe ordered too much.  We had too much food.\n\nThe food was good.  We had some desserts.\n\nThe waitress brought us the bill.  We put some cash in the billfold.  She came back and said oh didn't you order the sweet potato dish?  We said no.  She grabbed our billfold, minus the cash, disappeared into the kitchen and came back out with a small dessert plate with sweet potato cake and tapioca, a candle in the middle, everyone sang happy birthday.  We tasted the cake, was a little strange.\n \nWaitress now brings us the bill again, with the added sweet potato birthday dish charge that we did not order.\n\nThe food was decent, but unthoughtful service and lack of generosity will bite you and leave a bad taste in your mouth.", "author": "Loan T."}

Everything was delicious and had lots of flavor.  My least favorite was the tea leaf salad (we ordered it sans lettuce) - I liked the variety of nuts and spices, but I don't think it's something to where I could finish the whole dish.  I was only able to eat 2 spoonfuls and was done with the dish.  My favorite was definitely the fried eggplant.  It has a crispy outside, yet soft inside and it was just PERFECT!  If you're an eggplant lover, you HAVE to order this dish.\n\nThe pumpkin pork stew was delicious too - I liked how they kept the stew in the pumpkin for presentation and it was nice and hot (thank goodness it wasn't lukewarm!)  It has nice huge chunks of pumpkin and pork and it definitely is the best when you mix it in with some white rice.  The prawns w/string beans was also good - we needed some veggies so the string beans was a nice addition to our meal.  We also ordered the fried squash because we were waiting for friend to join us.  It was the perfect amount to hold us off til we were able to order our main dishes - it wasn't too oily/greasy and the sweet/spicy sauce that came with the dish was great!

However, I have to mention the service is lacking.  \n\nDon't bother making reservations because even if you do they will still seat other parties ahead of you. I think it is because they are trying to accommodate the number of people in the party as opposed to who actually has been waiting the longest.  For example, if you have a reservation for a party of 2, they will seat a party of 4 without a reservation ahead of you if they have a table large enough for them, instead of having your party of only 2 sit at that table.  So, reservations, calling ahead, etc. means nothing. You really have to be a patient person to tolerate this without becoming furious. This becomes vary annoying, especially since it has happened to me EVERY TIME I have visited.\n\nWhen you place your order make sure you are very clear.  They often make mistakes.  Although they were quick to correct it right away, it is still a pain in the butt, and embarassing to have to address it in front of a dinner date.  For example, you order a vegatarian dish, and they mistakenly bring it to you with meat. \n\nOverall, the ONLY problem with Mandalay is service.

Fried garlic flakes, toasted lentils, cherry tomatoes, tea leaf, lemon, peanuts, etc. I could eat this dish as my main entree any day of the week, it will definitely serve 3-4 people for appetizers.\n\nYoung Fresh Coconut - An entire coconut served with an umbrella, spoon and straw. You drink all the coconut water first, then go crazy scooping out the coconut meat. Absolutely nothing added to it.

There are only a few lucky cities in the US that (according to Yelp) offer Burmese cuisine, and SF is one of them. There is no reason not to eat here at least once a week, unless you don't like delicious food or are on a fun-free diet.\n\nUnlike some Burmese restaurants in SF, Mandalay takes online reservations for moderately sized groups and there is rarely a wait. I typically am able to walk in and be seated within a few minutes. The moment I sit down I start scanning the room for my favourite server, Raymond, who is rarely without a smile. \n\nA perfect order for a group of 3-4 people:\n\nTea Leaf Salad (Lap Pat Dok): It's the assembled-on-the-spot salad that everyone familiar with Burmese cuisine knows and loves, and it's a banger. I've never had anything like it. Tea leaves, toasted lentil seeds, ground shrimp, fried garlic, green pepper, sesame seeds, peanuts & lemon juice. \n\nSamusa Soup: This is a slightly spicy soup with beans (maybe chickpeas?), curry leaves, lentils, crunchy yellow shoots, cabbage, mint leaves and onions. Packs a nice punch before the main entrees come out and is easy to share. \n\nMandalay Special Noodle with Tofu or Chicken: I dream about this entree - it's just that good. Burmese flat noodles similar to a fettucine, with mild coconut sauce, yellow peas, lime juice, cilantro, peanuts, fried onions and crispy shrimp.\n\nDry Pan Fried String Bean: I'm sure this is the least healthy item on the menu but it's the one I always insist on ordering. I just love green beans. These are pan fried with ginger, ground shrimp and chili sauce. A bit zesty and super crunchy. Requires followup with dental floss.\n\nSauteed Peashoots with Garlic: Hard to find this item on other menus so if my group can stomach the produce, it's usually on the list of items to order.\n\nCoconut Rice: Get this one instead of plain rice to zest it up.\n\nWhen the bill comes, you'll wonder if they forgot to charge you for some items. Pay it and make a note to come back when it's within reason to do so without people mistaking you for an employee. Yup, it's that good!", "author": "Kat F."}

It's a Burmese pancake that comes with a tasty curry dipping sauce and it's so, so good. The pancake is about the width of a buttermilk pancake that's been perfectly cooked but the consistency is lighter and the pancake almost comes apart in sheets. It can taste a little doughy when you get to thicker parts but the curry sauce makes up for that.\n\nGet coconut rice! The coconut is crispy and the rice has the perfect texture for beef rendang - light but not dry. I like how southeast Asian rice is between dry, almost hard Chinese rice and sticky, glutinous Korean rice. \n\nWe also tried the sauteed green beans and they were good. Still snappy but a tad bit salty for my taste.\n\nI was disappointed that the service took so long.

Fortunately, we (2) were seated in about 5 minutes since the small tables were turning over fast.  There was a large family of about 6 who were made to wait till a larger back table cleared.  No, joining the smaller tables together (on the left side).  However, we did have to wait a little be longer than usually for a server to show up and our dishes were running about 10 minutes late.  I attribute this to the crowds.\n\nItems ordered:\n\n*Samusa ( Vegetarian)\nA mixture of grounded curried meat and potatoes.  They were hot and crispy.  The potato filling and spices were spot on.  No complaints here.\n\n*Mandalay Special Noodle \nBurmese flat noodle with mild coconut chicken, yellow peas powder lime juice, onion and fried thin noodle on the top.   I loved this dish.  Not to much cream and the noodles were cooked just right.  I did have one complaint, please take out the steams from the cilantro and chop the cilantro up in lieu of serving it in full leaf as well as reduce the amount of cilantro (I took about 30 leaves out).  Also, chop the other chewy green condiment in small pieces because the texture is a bit hard to macerate.  \n\n*Burmese Style Curry Chicken\nBurmese style yellow curry chicken with potatoes.  Excellent dish.  The chicken was tender and the curry was excellent.\n\n*Thai Tea.   Perfect drink to temper the spaces of the main dishes.  It can substitute for a dessert drink.  \n\nI will always go back to this place.  I love the low key vibe of the staff, the working costumes, and the festive decorations.  For a place the is small and crowded, it is early to talk to the person in front of you because the shadowboxed ceiling was constructed with hanging fabric panels (weighed with wooded poles)  that absorbed the noise.  This is a very friendly place to eat.  For those of you who have a large family, they have large family style family rounders  farther back  for comfortable dining. \n\nDriving/Bus:  Easy to get to via 1 California Bus.

The restaurant was packed, certainly, but some other tables who came later got served first, not cool..\nOur servers were always very nice though, and apologized for the wait.\n\nTea leaf salad - we actually had a version of this with lettuce somewhere else and preferred that, but apparently that's an Americanized version so I guess our tastebuds were polluted to begin with! Love the fried chickpeas and peanuts though, gives a crunch.\n\nBlack pepper soup - yummy vermicelli inside and pieces of fish and soft squash-like vege which I thought was bitter melon or something, but am not entirely sure. Pretty gd!\n\nBurmese catfish curry - a bit on the salty side, pretty good still!\n\nBurmese Style Noodle (Kaw Soi Dok) - far and away my favorite dish! Loved the combination of crunch (fried onion/garlic and cucumber) and citrusy dressing.\n\nWe also ordered coconut rice, which came in a flower-shaped bowl, really cute! It was very good, tender/fluffy/flavorful :)", "author": "Clarissa L."}

Maybe we came on one of their \"off days\" because the food was not as great as other Burmese restaurants I've tried and the service was horrible. The server was very impatient with us and was rushing to get us out. It was a shame our aunt and uncle didn't have the same experience as we did when we first tried Burmese food.

Unfortunately the prices keep creeping up so I will not be able to eat there as often as before. It is with disappointment that I report the last few times we've eaten there, we've been charged for more rice than we ordered which is always a hassle to point out, not to mention makes the customer look petty. The last time we ate there, our food took an hour to arrive for a party of 3 with 4 dishes. It was Halloween and we were looking forward to doing some other things that we were not able to do.

The Mango Chicken is cooked to a perfection - crispy outside with a tender center and the sweet mangos nicely complement the savory flavor. I love ordering a Sweet Young Coconut juice with an umbrella and straw (in the coconut!) to refresh my palate. \n\nDessert was the fried bananas and sorbet - decent. \n\nThe most memorable part of the meal was ordering Jasmine Tea. The tea arrived in clear wine glasses with a Jasmine flower in a tight ball inside. As time passed, the flower slowly opened up and revealed it's beautiful bright red center and released it's aromatic flavors! So cool.\n\nThe quality of their food is superb as well as their very efficient service.

That really put a damper on things.\n\nAlso, I recommend the Rainbow Salad and the Mandalay Special Noodle. \n\nIf you've been to Burma Superstar, you might be interested in the Tea Leaf Salad here. Its also very delicious, but be prepared that it does not comes with lettuce which makes it more potent in flavor, but also makes for a smaller dish. Very good, but I love the Rainbow Salad even more.\n\nThe service is ok, they are great at certain things like presenting the food and serving it to you. But sometimes it seems like they are just going through the motions and are missing that personal attention. They seem to run out of things and not quite know how to handle questions about the menu or any special requests. Everyone is pretty professional, but I never feel like they are there for me and its also often unclear who I should mainly be talking to about my order because so many different people come to the table.\n\nOverall I really like this place, some of the food is unbelievably good and most is very good.", "author": "Dexter H."}

We try to go to places outside of our neck of the woods (the South Bay), for a change of scenery.  After reading some reviews, we decided that we would try for call ahead seating, just in case.  It was a Sunday, so I didnt think it would be too bad, but I am impatient so would rather call ahead than wait when we got there. I called at 6pm as we headed out, and the lady who answered said they were very busy and she could put my name down if we were going to be there soon.  I told her we wouldnt be there for another hour, and she said \"Okay no problem.  Just come in, no wait at 7pm.\"  I was already feeling like this was going to be bad.  Turns out, she was right. We got there a little after 7 and were seated immediately.\n\nService was really good, maybe too good (is that possible?).  3 people tried to take our drink order, and multiple people brought out our drinks/gave us refills on water. I ordered the tapioca with coconut milk, which was delicious  Something that we make at home on occasion, but it never tastes that good for some reason.  \n\nAs an appetizer we ordered the Palada. It came out pretty quickly and was hot and fresh.  The curry dipping sauce was extremely hot; my boyfriend burned his mouth because he was too gung-ho about eating.  I felt that the Palada was a bit thick and doughy for my liking, I prefer something thinner and flakier (like a Malay/Thai Roti). The flavor was good, but it was a bit greasy.  \n\nFor dinner we ordered the Walnut Prawns, Burmese Curry Beef, Spicy Naked Eggplant, Coconut rice and the Mandalay Special Noodles.  The walnut prawns were battered a little too heavily, and it was confusing that some of the prawns had tails on and some didnt.  It was like Russian Roulette, whether you got a tail or not! The Burmese curry beef had good flavor, and had ample meat.  It wasnt really spicy, but had a lot of spice flavor (if that makes sense...). The spicy naked eggplant was also heavily battered and was a bit chewy.  The sauce flavor was good, but I would have preferred less onions and bell peppers and more eggplant.  Also, the eggplant was cut into HUGE pieces, which made it a bit difficult to eat. Coconut rice is, well, coconut rice.  Nothing special here. The Mandalay special noodles were interesting.  I can only describe the flavor as a creamy, lemon-curry sauce.  Very light and refreshing in your mouth.  It came with crushed pea, cilantro, crunchy noodles, and chicken.  Maybe something else, but thats all I can remember.  The server presented it to us and then said she was going to mix it for us.  Score!!  It took her like 5 mins to mix it though, which was kind of awkward.  Are you supposed to watch her the whole time? We tried to have a conversation but felt like it was rude to talk in front of her, so we just stared awkwardly at her tossing the noodles. \n\nAfter dinner, we were contemplating dessert but ultimately decided not to get anything.  They gave us complementary Mango Pudding, which was light and mango-y.  I'm not a huge fan of mango, but I assume that it would taste pretty good to someone who likes it.  \n\nOverall, we enjoyed the food and would come back if we were in the area.  I dont think that we would drive 45 mins specifically to eat here though.", "author": "Kristin K."}

Also ordered items that seemed available for the American palate like Mango Chicken and Rangoon Lamb -- neither of these really strike me as \"Burmese\" or maybe the Burmese folks I know never make this.  Nevertheless the Mango Chicken & Rangoon Lamb were delish.  Not saucy really.  Smell of lamb was covered up well so I guess that means the marinating was done well.  I'd definitely come back.\n\nMy gripe w/ Mandalay was the wait was terrible (granted it was a Friday night)... but the hostess kept saying that our table was getting up and we'd be seated right away though we weren't.  The false expectation kind of sucked - I'd just rather be told the honest wait even if it's long.  On top of that, they seated a 4 person party at a 2 person table.  Kind of tight.  I guess it's  better than not being seated at all.  However, even though the wait was long, the estimated wait time inaccurate, and the space cramped...

With wonderful, knowledgeable company I knew I was in for a treat of the senses.  \n\nWe came here for an early evening dinner and already this medium sized restaurant was packed, even on a Sunday.  So either make reservations or be prepared to wait.  Later I would realize why this restaurant would be so packed with families and parties seeming to be celebrating.   Inside is brightly colored in vibrant hues.  Pleasantly decorated with tasteful paintings, the ambiance was colorful but without needing glasses for blinders.  All around I felt transported into a different culture and comfortable throughout dinner.\n\nThe staff was quite nice and happy to explain the dishes presented.  With smiles and cheerful manners, our waitresses were a great addition to the evening.  There was no wait and getting more water or extra items were easy.\n\nThe food was interesting and fun . . .  The rainbow salad was fresh, colorful and with a fish sauce that seemed a bit tangy.  While I cannot say I loved it, it was something new and fun to eat.  Additionally, we ordered a noodle dish I do not remember the name of, but it too was neat to try but not a feast for the palate.  Finally, we had a curry that was a tad spicy and oh so good.  I am a sucker for curries, so i was completely on board with the order.  Tender meat, fragrant aromas and tasty bites were in store with every mouth full.\n\nOverall the experience was great and I would totally come back!\n\nGood food.\nLovely decor.\nGreat staff.", "author": "Sabrina A."}

But as soon as we were seated they had a line out the door!\n\nFirst off, the only gripe I have with them is the seating. We had a party of five and they seated us at a table that at most restaurants would not seat any more than 4 people.\n\nI saw them do this with other groups, a couple and their son were seated at a two person table. I understand that the place was small and that the wait was long, but it was a tight squeeze.\n\nThe food was delicious though. Their honey walnut shrimp was probably the best I've had. The shrimp/prawns were huge and it was a nice crisp coating with a sweet glaze.\n\nMy dad ordered the tofu eggplant dish and it was also great. So great in fact I only had time to nab one piece of tofu before he ate it all. My mom ordered the whole fried fish. At first my dad and sister were hesitant but in the end only the fishes spine remained. They got a nice crunchy texture on the outside and the inside of soft and flaky.\n\nThe other dish we ordered was the Mandalay chicken, which reminded me of a typical orange chicken from chinese restaurants, but not as sweet. Still I would definitely ordered it again. Oh can't forget the delicious coconut rice. Always a must with south asian cooking!\n\nOverall the food was excellent.

I first heard about it several years ago through the office grapevine, from a colleague who'd grown up in the Richmond and had been going there forever.\n\nThe atmosphere is much more casual than the rival restaurant around the corner, brightly lit and colorfully decorated, with strings of lights, walls covered in framed engravings, and a huge alter in the foyer.\n\nThere is so much here that's just unmissable. For an App, I'm devoted to the Balada. I think every culture has some version of savory fry bread. This is the Burmese one, and it is wonderful: deep fried and delicious, paired with a sweet and spicy curry dipping sauce. \n\nThe Tea Leaf and Rainbow salads are both wonderful. The Tea Leaf is exactly what it sounds like, cold cooked tea leaves, with crispy fried garlic chips, lentils and nuts. The Rainbow boasts some 20 ingredients, tossed table-side with a certain showmanship, and drizzled with lemon juice and a house dressing with a fish-sauce base. Pepper pot soup is also a really interesting dish.\n\nFor main course, my go-tos are Mango chicken and Mandalay noodle, both so good I have to admit I've done very little exploring.\n\nOverall, this place offers great quality food at a better-than-average price, and as an added bonus, you can usually get in the door in a timely manner.", "author": "Lindsay M."}

Be prepared to experience some frustration and handle it, since they seem understaffed. At one point last night there was not ONE plate in the entire, fully packed restaurant that had food on it. My guess is that there was a kitchen malfunction and/or there aren't enough people staffed. The host also served as our server and required about 10-15 minutes of waiting after sitting down before being acknowledged again. Drinks eventually came out, which were almost finished before any appetizer came out. Ironically, I was prompted twice by the host/server about having another drink. Having been there on a Tuesday night, I can't imagine what the weekends are like. \n\nDespite all that, the food is excellent and although busy, the place is conducive to a nice meal. The staff were friendly. The Mandalay noodle dish was quite tasty. The \"naked\" eggplant was also good, but seemed plain relative to the other dishes offered. Started with Balada - the \"crispy\" pancake that is more flaky than crispy. Still, it was very good, especially with the accompanying curry sauce. As a side note, the decor is quite kitschy yet endearing - neon palm tree, ornaments hanging from ceiling, geode water fountain.\n\nI will be back!", "author": "Ben C."}

Burma Superstar was closed in between lunch and dinner hours so this seemed like the next best choice nearby, but I am thrilled that we came here on a whim! Plus, I just can't stand waiting in long lines for a table when I'm deliriously hangry! Got seated right away and although the menu and ambiance strongly resembles Mingalaba, the fantastic flavors and lively decor at Mandalay felt a little more authentic. It is a bit pricier and the portions seem a bit smaller compared to Mingalaba, but I thoroughly enjoyed every dish we ordered. Can't exactly compare both restaurants as they are located in very different cities and I have been long loyal to Mingalaba, but Mandalay definitely warrants another visit when I am in Pacific Heights. I appreciate that they accept reservations, which is becoming uncommon these days especially at popular restaurants. Overall, all their dishes were prepared fantastically - impressive flavor and not dripping in oil. \n\nHere's the must-try list:\n\n- Balada (aka paratha or roti) - I prefer their easy-to-eat version which is cut like pizza and much thicker and filling compared to other places that serve a thin pancake. Curry dipping sauce pares beautifully well.\n\n- Ong No Kaw Soi (coconut chicken noodle soup) - I have tried many times to recreate this dish at home, but it is always better at the restaurant. Soup is not too thick. Generous serving of fresh cilantro. I would try the Moo Hin Nga (fish chowder) next time.\n\n- Mandalay Special Noodle - A brilliant combintion of flavor and texture, every ingredient (mixed table side) marries perfectly together with a very mild hint of spiciness.\n\n- Walnut Prawn - Devoured this tower of prawns in minutes.", "author": "Ellie D."}

I've tried 3 other Burmese restaurants and have not been as impressed.  I think Mandalay is on the same level as Burma Superstar when it comes to the food.\n\nWe started off with the tea leaf salad, which was prepared in front of us. I don't know but I think this version is even better than Burma Superstar's. Really really really yummy. We also had the fish cakes which were good, but can skip next time. For main courses, we shared 3. The samusa soup (which they separated into 2 bowls... convenient!) was on par with Burma Superstar's, but based on my memory alone Superstar may have the edge on this dish. The tofu kebat was absolutely delicious, really impressed me as I don't usually eat tofu. Then a noodle dish Nan Gyi Dok with chicken, also very good. \n\nThe dishes are a bit tiny but maybe because it was lunch? Or that I just ran 12 miles before that.. hmm.

All I kept thinking afterwards was, \"I can't believe I've never been here\"! ...Yes, it was that good!\n\nWe had a short wait of about 10 minutes before a table for four was available. The wait staff was helpful but seemed overwhelmed... I guess it was unexpected but the place was quite packed for a Monday night and only 3-4 wait staff. After much laughs, recommendations and decisions over what appeared to be a very simple yet yummy menu, we decided to order a few dishes to share.\n\nTo start, my mom and her friend got the hot and sour soup while my friend and I got the sizzling rice soup (with chicken, scallops and shrimp) as well as vegetarian samosas. I'm not a fan of hot and sour soup so I didn't try it but my mom and her friend really enjoyed it with the restaurant's special spicy chili paste. The sizzling rice soup was just divine... they bring out the soup and the rice separately and mix it at your table so that you can see all the sizzle the rice makes once it touches the soup! The samosas filled with soft potatoes while the shell was nice and crispy... YUMMY!!\n\nFor our entries, we got their Mongolian lamb, basil leaf beef, chicken yellow curry, walnut prawns and the naked eggplant. EVERYTHING WAS GOOD!! The lamb was tender but ridiculously spicy, my least liked dish. The basil beef was extremely tender and tasteful, to me more flavorful then the Mongolian dish. The potatoes in the chicken curry were cooked all the way through, so soft that it made the curry thick but not heavy making the chicken dish very tender and flavorful! The walnut prawns was more on the sweet side but oh so very good! Crispy and sweet on the outside, soft and warm on the inside, with a piece of walnut it was just perfection. My favorite dish of the night was the naked eggplant! Basically, the eggplant is peeled before it is dipped in this amazing batter and fried to perfection... DELICIOUS!!\n\nOf course, we all had an order of what my friend deemed was the best rice ever... cooked with cinnamon, saffron, peas, carrots and raisins. It seemed to complement almost ever dish perfectly, I really enjoyed it. I was so full, I couldn't think of desert even though that desert menu looked tempting. I guess because we ordered so much food, we were given a complementary dessert, four small pieces of sweet potato cake made with a bit of milk, cream of wheat and topped with poppy seeds. When I could finally breath and took a bite, it was quite good for something deemed dessert rather than an appetizer.\n\nAll in all, I loved this place and plan to come back soon!!

The waitress helped us divide this soup into 5 bowls without us even asking, which was nice.\n\nPumpkin Curry with Pork: I believe this was one of the specials of the day. Pumpkin curry with chunks of pumpkin and pork served inside a small pumpkin. The name made the dish sound better than we thought it would be. While it was good, I wouldn't consider it anything special. \n\nMango Prawn: Tastes exactly as it sounds. Tangy sweetness of the mango with savory prawns. Tasted good but also wasn't a dish that stuck out to me.\n\nWalnut Broccoli Tofu: Broccoli and tofu cooked with ginger sauce and served with honey walnuts. A very different flavor with the kick of ginger and mildly spicy. Pretty good, and the ginger taste really made it different from other vegetable dishes I've eaten.\n\nMandalay Special Noodle (Burmese flat noodle with mild coconut tofu, yellow peas powder lime juice, onion and fried thin noodle on the top): I would consider this the best dish of the night.

The dish has a sweet and sour taste to it, with a little bit of spice.\n\nLychee coconut prawns: I know...lychee?! But I love trying different dishes so we decided to go for it. The dish is a bit small for the price I suppose ($12.50 or something like that) but it was yum. It was like a curry--the closest thing I can relate it to is Thai panang curry. The lychee was stuffed with shrimp (6 of them) and pineapple slices were sprinkled in between.  The lychee brought a sweet burst of flavor to the curry and shrimp.

Review #100 goes to Mandalay, easily one of my favorite places in SF. There was a period when I was going out to the Richmond up to three times a week to eat here before I realized that I might have a problem and toned it down to once every couple of weeks. Oh please, like you haven't done that before. If there's anything worth a six hour bus ride out into the land of fog and Russians, it's Mandalay.\n\nAfter so many visits, I pretty much have my order down: Tea leaf salad (this is key), pan fried green beans, and the Mandalay noodles. The samusa soup, mango chicken, and walnut broccoli are all excellent dishes as well, but it's hard to beat the core three elements above. Their dishes are great for family-style sharing, and the servers will let you add a half order of something to make sure there's enough to go around.\n\nService here is consistently great, especially Raymond, who seems to always be there. He reminds me of a Burmese Gilbert Gottfried but in a not weird way. He's never made a dish recommendation that wasn't spot on, and will make sure you leave well fed and happy. They take reservations, although even without one you can get in pretty quickly, especially compared to Burma Superstar.\n\nSo speaking of Burma Superstar, I think I've made it longer in my review without mentioning them than anyone else so far. I kind of feel bad for Mandalay because they are always described as \"Burma Superstar without the wait.\" I feel like we should more accurately be saying \"Burma Superstar is like Mandalay but with a ridiculous wait.\"", "author": "Mark A."}

We all split the vegetarian dishes and were thoroughly impressed with everything! It was all sooooooo very good. The dining experience here is great because even though the place is small, the experience is slow and enjoyable. You are brought your food dish by dish and have a chance to enjoy everything on your own time. This is good and bad.

Loved the crunch of the lentils and peanuts and the restraint with which the chef seasoned the dish. Mouth watering for me. \n*Rainbow salad -- very tasty though my least favorite of what we ordered today. More noodles than I expected but had great flavor.\n*Moo hin nga -- the favorite soup for half of the fam. Lots of umami with a creamy and smooth broth texturized with the broken noodles and ground catfish. The freshness of the cilantro and lemon are perfect to balance out the richness of the soup.\n*Samusa soup -- the fave of the other half of the table. Smaller serving than the Moo hin nga (so order two if this is the only soup order for a group of 4-5). Tasty. Spicy. Perfect. \n*Seafood with green beans -- delicious wok-tossed dish of scallops, squid, and shrimp with cut green beans in a semi-spicy shrimp paste sauce. Fantastic execution. All the seafood was cooked perfectly. \n*Rangoon lamb -- my absolute favorite dish of the day! Tender pieces of marinated lamb saut\u00e9ed with tomato, onions, bell pepper, and chili topped with fresh cilantro. This dish hits the tongue as sweet, then follows with slight saltiness, then a finish of subtle spice. Perfect. Getting this every time. \n*Mandalay special noodle -- hubby's favorite dish. Toothsome noodles in a chicken curry sauce with a hint of lime and topped with crunchy noodles. It's a toss up between this and Mission Chinese's squid ink noodles for my favorite noodle dish in the city (including all pasta from SPQR). \n\nFinal bill for a party of 5: just under $100. \n\nExcited to try the banana leaf salad, lamb curry, okra prawn, and Mandalay chicken salad. \n\nAdded pro: they take reservations.

We almost always have the tea leaf salad, and yes, as noted from other reviewers, it does have a lot of peanuts - which we like. It's not much of a traditional salad per se and the tangy flavor is definitely not something most folks are used to but it's good none the less. We've never been here for dinner, so for our lunch entrees this time we ordered the Mandalay Noodle and Singapore Noodle dish. Both were very good. The Singapore noodle leans more towards a Pad Thai (orange color) tangy flavor rather than the usual yellow curry flavor of most Chinese styles. The Mandalay Noodle was saucey with a curry coconut flavor, with bits of diced chicken sprinkled with some fried noodled. The dish could have done without the fried noodle bit, but was still very tasty and flavorful. \n\nThis is a great place and I will one day come and try it for dinner.", "author": "Jack D."}

I have to admit that the dishes served here are remarkable. As tasty as it can be, the catfish chowder is the right choice to start my evening meal. It's my first time trying out the Burmese chowder, and when I thought it could be as thick as a clam chowder, it's of lighter weight, more brothy than creamy. Served with cilantro and lemon on the side and an ample amount of chili. \n\nUnlike Burma Superstar (I hate comparing restaurants, but here I go), Mandalay lacks that punch of ingredients put into their curry. We ordered the seafood curry with shrimps. The bowl that came in, sits on a big dinner plate adorned with some boiled broccoli, sliced tomatoes and cucumbers. Size of bowl is smaller than our bowl of saffron rice. Despite that, they are pretty generous with the shrimps...countable maybe..8? not bad. \n\nThen, here's a funny part of the dinner. I want some Burmese salad, and my girl wants some Burmese samosas. So we did a treaty-the Burmese Samosa Salad. Waiter made it clear that it'll come with 2 pieces of samosas, chopped up and tossed in the salad. Mandalay's manager passed by, overheard our waiter and corrected him that it's actually FOUR samosas not TWO. Wellll, sounds perfect. Salad came in some while later and there was the obvious 2 triangular pieces of samosas on the bed of salad and some cucumber fritters. Where's the other two? Supposed to be four isn't it? We thought maybe the other two got chopped up much smaller and disappeared into the salad. We digged em up, but in vain.\n\n\"Excuse me, there's only two samosas here, didn't the manager just said we'll get four?\"\n\nnervous giggles \"yea! I know she must've misunderstood it, but I'm sure I said two and I'm sure It'll only come in two. I always see the salad comes with only two samosa. Maybe she's not sure. I'm sure.. yea sorry. so sorry. But you get only two samosas\" more giggles.\n\nOKAY then. \n\nService is 5*. I love how friendly and attentive everybody is over at Mandalay.

The restaurant decor reminded me of any usual asian restaurant.\n\nFor our order, we went for the [Sorry I don't remember the exact name] group package dinner that serves dishes according to the number in your party. There were 4 of us, so we had an appetizer, chicken skewers, beef and vegetables, soup, fish, and some other vegetable dish. The wait for our food actually took a while after we received our drinks (not a large beer menu for you beer drinkers out there)\n\nThe appetizer is a salad of mixed nuts (Let's all be grown-ups for a second lol) and other things, a dish that our waitress says is one of the most popular for the restaurant. I'm a very picky eater so it took a while to try it, but when I did it was actually pretty good. I would definitely recommend it for anyone's visit. If you call soup an appetizer, I'll list that here too. I've never had a soup before like the one they served. It was a chicken noodle soup. Coconut milk was a very prominent flavor, but I hear that coconut milk is a staple in Burmese cooking. It was very chunky, it was a good thing. I've never been a fan of coconut \"anything\", but this is a good exception.\n\nThen comes the main course, in this situation, courses. I found the Mandalay Beef pretty good, the sauce that it was served in was very good. The BBQ chicken, I found to be just okay though, I did not find anything special about it. I didn't really get to the fish, nor the vegetables. Even though it was meant for four people, it was definitely more than enough, probably even for five.\n\nSo for first time going for Burmese food, I had an overall good meal. The visit supplied me with a lot of firsts. It can however be a little pricey, especially for the party servings, 20+/person. Anyone should try it!", "author": "Robert O."}

An establishment which has been around in S.F. for many years, this place is really worth a try!  Mandalay has a casual atmosphere and is good for groups since it has a large dining area that can accommodate big parties.\n\nSome of their tasty dishes include:\n\n*  Lap Pat Dok (Tea Leaf Salad) -  Their signature dish.  A delicious, pungent combination of Burmese tea leaves toasted with lentil seeds, ground shrimp, fried garlic chips, peanuts, sesame seeds, green peppers, and a special dressing which is all prepared by the server right in front of your eyes!  A wonderful salad!\n\n*  Balada -  A Burmese pancake which is pan fried with a crispy outer layer, accompanied by a delicious curry dipping sauce.  Not too greasy.  One of my favorites!\n\n*  Rainbow Chicken -  Tender pieces of pan fried chicken breast with slices of fresh, sweet mangoes, pineapples, and an assortment of vegetables.  Yum!\n\n*  Pan Fry Okra Prawns - Good-sized pan fried prawns sauteed with okra in a ginger and garlic spicy sauce.\n\n*  Mandalay Beef -  Tender slices of lean beef sauteed in a tasty garlic hot sauce.\n\n*  Mandalay Dry Pan Fried String Beans -  String beans dry fried and sauteed with spicy seasonings.\n\n*  Basil Spicy Eggplant -  A great vegetable dish with tender, juicy pieces of eggplant sauteed in a spicy sauce. \n\n*  Own Ta Mein (Coconut Rice) -  A must!  The coconut flakes provide a very subtle but flavorful addition to your rice and melds well with all the various Burmese dishes.\n\nThe service is relaxed but well paced.  Parking can be a little tough so please allow time or take public transportation as the restaurant is conveniently located on California St. at 6th Avenue.  Prices are reasonable with most dishes, excluding seafood choices, about $10 or less.  Enjoy!  You'll have an amazing meal!", "author": "Karen L."}

We had the ginger salad, the papusa salad, and the Mandalay Special Noodles.  The ginger salad was nice, though ultimately not as good as you find at Nan Yang in Rockridge (full disclosure: I've been going to Nan Yang since I was a kid when it used to be in Oakland Chinatown, so I have strong and undoubtedly biased memories of the food).

The balada (roti) and curry dipping sauce is also some of the best roti I've had and they don't skimp on the portions.

Friendly, helpful staff and there was a mad group of folks waiting for tables and hostess even brought out complimentary wine for everyone waiting inside.  How cool and high-class is that?   9 out 10 for service.  I have to take away a point for some slight delay and repeating a request for a drink to the table.  \n\nThe food was just simply average.   This is where Mandalay looses big time.  We had the Samosas and Tea Leaf Salad for starters.   The Samosas were okay but the ones at Burma Superstar are much more flavorful and the hot sauce there is better as well.  \n\nThe Tea Leaf Salad was interesting.  I have had the Rainbow Salad at Burma Superstar and I LOVE that.  I figured I would try something different here.  It tasted interesting.  I would most likely compare it to Burmese flavored granola.   Seriously.  The pan roasted garlic retained a horrid burnt taste in the salad that pretty much destroyed any appreciation of this interesting dish.  \n\nFor the mains, we had the Rangoon beef and the Mandalay chicken.  Both were okay.  The Mandalay chicken tasted like any Orange or General Tso's chicken you would order at a decent to good Chinese fast food place.  Except for here it is WAY overpriced.  \n\nThe saffron rice was a bit sweet and had an intense cinnamon flavor.  Are they buying cheap imitation saffron or the real shit? \n\nBurma Superstar rocks this place and I would never come back here again unless I was with a group of friends that were adamant on going.   Burma superstar has better food, better ingredients, a better chef, better presentation......  Hands down, that is the winner.  \n\n Hope I didn't rock the boat with all you Mandalay fans out there.

We have never tried Burmese before so we were very excited. We ordered their special tea, the tea salad, mandalay noodles and the Singapore noodles. My husband said everything was okay, but I did not like the tea salad or the Singapore noodles at all. I am not a finicky eater so we were both surprised. I am the one that's adventurous and is always dragging him to try new things. This was the first time I was truly disappointed. The tea salad has the fermented tea leaves but I did not expect it to taste so wrong. It was very oily and left a bitter taste in your mouth. I do not understand why so many people rave about this dish. My house noodles were alright. Overall, we decided that these Burmese dishes tasted like wannabe Thai dishes. But nowhere nearly as good as Thai. Maybe I just had an off night and my taste buds were messed up? That's never happened before... We will Burmese food a try again sometime in the future.", "author": "A W."}

Portions are extremely generous, and the prices aren't too bad.\n\nLast time I was here, it was extremely crowded. I hadn't been here in a while and was disappointed when I saw that the lemon chicken was no longer on the menu. Instead, I ordered the walnut shrimp and white rice, which was good. It was a lot of food, so much I almost got a headache. My friend ordered the tea leaf salad and saffron rice. The service could've been better. They seemed overwhelmed at the amount of people, but our food came fast. We decided to order dessert: fried bananas with coconut ice cream. As this is one of my favorite desserts, I've had my fair share of different interpretations. There was too much batter on the bananas, and the batter itself wasn't very good to begin with. However, the coconut ice cream made up for it. \n\nBest Burmese place in the city, hands down. The location isn't convenient for me at all, but I will go out of my way to eat here.", "author": "Nastasia G."}

It was good. The service was very friendly, the place is vibrantly decorated and very inviting, and there was no wait. \n\nThe menu is quite varied, so it took us awhile to figure out what to order, but I was pretty satisfied with everything we ordered. \n\n- Balada: It's a variation of fried green-onion pancakes and roti. It's a crispy/chewy pancake that comes with a curry dipping sauce. It was pretty good, but not amazing. It was not quite crispy enough, and a little too thick. It also wasn't like roti, pulling apart into several layers. \n\n- Mandalay special noodles: Flat rice noodles with coconut chicken and vegetables. It was kind of like pad thai. \n\n- Pan Fry Okra Prawn: This was one of the better dishes. Okra's usually not high on my list of things to eat, but here it's sauteed, so the consistency is very different from the okra you'd find on something like gumbo, where it's been boiled to hell. The okra in this dish was still slightly crunchy, bright green, and very good. Only downside was that there weren't very many prawns. The flavor was good though. \n\n- Rangoon Beef: Sliced and stir-fried beef with vegetables. Beef was very tender. I liked it. \n\n- Coconut rice: I'm a sucker for coconut milk and rice. This is basically steamed rice with a hint of coconut milk, sprinkled with fried coconut flakes on top. Maybe a shade dry. \n\nOverall a good Burmese restaurant. Portions were not large, but we still had some leftovers.", "author": "Saunders C."}

Bummer.) and Halu (which was only open for dinner). Two strikes, and only one more chance before my lunch mood was dampened. Luckily, my friend thought of Mandalay, a place she has frequented often, and we walked over for my first experience.\n\nAm I glad we came! The moment I stepped in, I noticed the lovely decor of the place. Beautiful traditional ornaments and artwork of various bright hues hung on the walls and ceilings. Nice to look at during pauses in the meal, and they added to the dining experience. The place was fairly full the entire time we were there, from 1:30 till almost 3, and I could tell why once I had my first sip of the Coconut Milk Tapioca. I hadn't tried a bite of food yet, and I was already hooked. Creamy, with coconut jelly and yummy sago balls, that drink filled me up in the best way possible.\n\nThe Ginger Salad and the Mandalay Special Noodle were recommended by my friend, and I'm so glad she suggested them, because they were absolutely delicious. So many tasty and unique flavors, and somehow they all blended together in a tantalizing way. The pickled ginger added a nice spiciness, and despite the quantity, it wasn't as overwhelming as I'd expected, melding perfectly with the other ingredients. And those noodles? They were homemade and looked and tasted way better than they looked - and let me tell you, they already looked very appealing. I definitely appreciated the tanginess of the lime juice, and the texture of the fried thin noodle was a great accent to the flat noodles. The flavors also reminded me of my fav Burmese dish, Nan Gyi Dok. Both plates were visually and literally tasty :}\n\nService was great; our plates were cleared within minutes and our water was refilled a couple times. They were polite and checked in with us often as well.\n\nOnly complaints - maybe I'm just being petty? - were the table size and the amount of chicken in the noodles. I thought there wasn't enough poultry for my taste; one piece for every few bites is not cutting it, especially if the pieces are tiny. Also, the dishes and drinks did not fit comfortably on the table. It was just a bit cramped; one more dish, and nothing would have fit. Luckily, my friend and I weren't voracious, and were stuffed by the salad and noodles.\n\nMandalay and Burma Super Star are now sitting pretty close in my book! Next time I am considering BSS for a meal, I might just check out Mandalay instead, especially because there is no wait :)\n\nThanks for the introduction to this lovely establishment, N.L.!", "author": "Tina Y."}

Burma Superstar is too much fuss for not much gain (read my review), so I was really excited when a few friends recommended Mandalay. It's a trek from SoMa, but it's worth it each time.\n\nMy most recent visit here was with family visiting from out of town. It was up to me to order, since my family had never had Burmese food before. We went a little buckwild.\n\nSamosas: Vegetarian and chicken. Crispy, tons of filling, all-around delicious.\nTea Leaf Salad: For anyone who's never had it before, this is a must-order. You've got to try it at least once. I was unimpressed with the Tea Leaf Salad at Burma Superstar, which resembled Corn Nuts, but here, it was more flavorful and not nearly as salty.\nMoo Hin Nga Soup: This fish chowder with noodle soup is great with lemon and cilantro. You can't see the catfish because it's all ground up, but it imparts a great flavor which is not overly fishy.\nBurmese Curry Beef: Tender and flavorful.\nBasil Spicy Eggplant: Full of basil flavor, and great spice. One of my favorite eggplant preparations.\nMandalay Special Noodle: This is another must-have. This was easily my favorite thing on the menu. Two kinds of noodles with a delicious sauce. I could easily eat this all day.\nCombination Fried Rice: Ordered for my poor allergic little brother, but I couldn't keep my spoon out of it. Another well flavored dish.\nFalooda: A very filling, coconut-y dessert that should be shared, not eaten by one person!\n\nThe food was delicious by all counts, but the service really sealed the deal. As soon as we mentioned my little brother's allergies (peanuts, fish sauce, really anything with seafood) they mentioned whether anything they brought out had any of that stuff in it, without us even asking. In most restaurants, we just order him a dish for himself, make sure there's nothing he's allergic to in it and we order our own dishes, but here, we didn't have to. They made it so easy to share nearly our entire meal with him. Also, we ordered falooda to share for the eight of us, since we really only wanted a few bites each, but they made sure to bring out enough bowls and spoons so everyone could eat comfortably. \n\nThe portions aren't huge, and the dishes aren't cheap, so you may end up having to pay a little more than usual.

These noodles had the \"force\"!\n\nThe tea leaf salad was pretty awesome too. The fermented tea leaves weren't as pungent as the other tea leaf salads I've tried, but for my palate that's a good thing- it allowed the other flavors  to come through... the fried crispy garlic, the jalapenos, and the shrimp powder. Not quite on the same Jedi scale as the special noodles, but still highly recommended.\n\nAnd the Balada... What's not to like about this crispy and chewy bread? One general problem with balada (or other similar breads) that I have at other restaurants is... the rather small portions always leave me hanging like Luke in a Wampa cave. I always end up wanting more. Here, I thought the portion was very generous and actually had some to take home. Also, where the curry dipping sauce that comes with balada often seems like a watered down afterthought at other restaurants, this was a very creamy and thick sauce that I really could've stood on its own.\n\nFor reasonably priced, delicious Burmese food that'll make you want to yub nub, check out Mandalay!", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

We came here on Saturday night after we were told that it would be an hour wait at Burma Superstar at 6PM. We were not disappointed at all. The host (could be the owner) was so accommodating. There were a few groups in front of us but she managed quickly to get everyone seated less than 5 mins. We were in a hurry to go to a show so we ordered the food 5 mins after we looked at the menu. We ordered tea leaf salad, mango chicken $12 and beef curry ($15). We waited for 15 mins then the salad came. We thought the food was gonna be long so we told the host that we were in a hurry.She then went back to check on the food for us and the food came out right away. The waitresses were very nice and attentive. Our water glasses were always filled. The food was delicious especially the salad.

Family dinner for 8 and overall the night was just okay. We started out with the ginger lime beers and ginger lemonades. I thought the ginger beer tasted better than the lemonade because the lemonade is too sweet, or perhaps I just like booze in general. \n\nFood on the other hand, took FOREVER to come out. I mean how hard is it to deep fry a bunch of stuff. The balada and samosa should be the easiest thing to pop out of the kitchen but it took so long that when the food got to our table, it wasn't pipping hot. I dont know if they dont have enough cooks or what, but the food coming out was really slow. The taste of the food was delicious, a bit heavier in flavoring for my taste but because food took so long to come out, i was pretty much full. But i'm not sure if i'm full from eating slowly or just full from the heavy flavoring.  \n\nWe of course ordered the tea leaf salad. Because there was so many of us, we ordered 1 1/2 orders, but it didn't seem like it was much bigger than the regular size. Most of the noodles taste the same with the coconut and peanut and cilantro. Curry wasn't spicy or that flavorful.  \n\nOn a tuesday night it took us 2 hours to eat, just imagine how long the weekend would take. I had to ask them to fill my water about 5 times until someone came to my table. Service is definitely not the best.", "author": "Anita W."}

He had a waitress take my order.  I told her the same, thing, listing out all the ingredients I couldn't eat.  I emphasized the vegan thing, asking her to make sure with the kitchen.  \n\nAfter my order came out, I asked her again if everything was vegan.  She took the bag back to the kitchen for a moment to confirm, and came back out saying YES.\n\nAfter the long drive home, I picked up the bag and found it leaking, the boxes about to fall out the sauce-soaked soggy bottom.  The bag wasn't well-packed, and the box of string beans had slipped down and leaked everywhere.\n\nShe was super, super nice.

It tasted funny, and I later called Kevin confirmed with the restaurant that they put FISH SAUCE in it!   \n\nAfter ALL the effort I went through to make sure the restaurant understood my order, I was not a happy camper.  Still, the waitress was so nice.\n\nCalling, and having Kevin tell me to call back later as he was super busy.

My dad was dying to try Mandalay after seeing it on Check Please, Bay Area.  So instead of our regular dim sum family outing, we decided to venture out.\n\nWe ordered:\nSatay chicken: chicken breast on skewers.  It was pretty dry.  The only ones in our party that liked it were my kiddie niece and nephew who 1) only eat chicken and 2) love anything on skewers.  Pass.\n\nSomusas with chicken:  Perfectly fried with a generous portion of filling.  Everyone enjoyed these.\n\nSomusa soup:  Basically a standard Burmese soup tomato base with fried somusas in it.  They have two kinds: spicy and mild.  We ordered both since there were 8 in our party.  The spicy isn't even spicy.  Good, but nothing to write home about.\n\nTea leaf salad:  Tasty!  The dish comes out with all the ingredients separated, and the server explains which ingredient is which before mixing it in front of you.  This salad is on par with the infamous Tea leaf salad at Burma Superstar two blocks down.  \n\nMandalay chicken salad:  Tasty as well!  Same as the tea leaf salad in that it's mixed in front of you.  Sweet and crunchy and a very different taste and texture than the tea leaf salad. \n\nMandalay special noodles:  Yum!  These noodles had just the right amount of crunch, curry and chewiness.  Again, these noodles were on par with Burma Superstar.\n\nTea duck: Ew. No likey.  This is served like Chinese Peking Duck with the buns, the plum sauce and green onion.  The buns were hard and dry and the duck was dry and not meaty at all.  The taste of the duck was almost bitter.  Yuck. \n\nBurmese curry lamb: Rich and flavorful.  The lamb was very tender and the potatoes were infused with curry flavor.  Decent.\n\nMango chicken:  Deep fried pieces of chicken tossed with fresh pieces of mango and onion.  Pretty good, but not very authentic.  It's kind the equivalent of a Chinese Orange Chicken.  \n\nIce cream/Tapioca dessert:  Tasty, but melted way too fast.  It had chunks of colored gelatin in it, which was nice and chewy.  Good, but not mind blowing by far.\n\nThe service was attentive and I liked that they explained the ingredients and dishes because this was a 1st time Burmese cuisine experience for most of the fams.\n\nAll in all, the food here is good, but not awesome.  Plus points for no wait. Portions are pretty small too.  I would go back for the samusas, tea leaf salad, mandalay chicken salad and mandalay special noodles.  I'd skip the rest and save a decent amount of coin.", "author": "Sandee L."}

It's Burmese food so it's kind of a blend of Indian, Chinese and kind of Mediterranean. It's pretty much a fusion of flavors. We started off with the tea leaf salad which does not resemble a typical salad at all. It consisted of Burmese tea leafs, lentils, grounded shrimp, fried garlic, sesame seeds, peanuts and dressing. I highly recommend this dish because it something unique and I'm sure you will never find a dish like this at any other Burmese restaurant. All in all it was a nutty yet earthy dish. We then had the Burmese style curry with white rice. This dish reminded me of the Indian Dahl / curry dishes that my dad makes. It was a thicker curry and tasted pretty good. Nothing too mind blowing but not bad. We then had the Mandalay special noodle, which was refreshing. If you want a vegetable dish I suggest the Mandalay eggplant.

I honestly feel like they should just bring this to every table without even asking.\n\n- You have to order the coconut rice. Again, don't even give people the chance to not order it.\n\n- This place is always busy. You won't have to wait as long as Burma Superstar, but expect to wait at least a little bit for a table.\n\n- It's best to call in ahead of time to put your name on the list. I'm not sure exactly how much it helps, but I've never had to wait longer than half an hour and that was with a big group.\n\n- Don't really expect to have a single person be your server for the meal. They kind of operate with an everybody does everything structure.\n\nOn the whole, I love this place and highly recommend it to anybody looking for some Asian food that isn't quite Thai and isn't quite Chinese.", "author": "Jeremy J."}

Granted, I only moved here a few months ago, but really, it's special.\n\nThe best way I can think to describe Burmese food to anyone who hasn't yet tried it is that it's like a culinary mashup involving Vietnamese freshness, Indian depth, and predominantly Thai ingredients. I hadn't tried Burmese food until I moved to this city, but I'm completely enamored with it now and I've been to three places so far and like Mandalay the most.\n\nI usually get the Mandalay special noodles, which are wide noodles in a coconut lime leaf sauce with garlic chips, dried shrimp, cilantro, chicken, and other goodness. Each dish here has over a dozen ingredients so it's tough to try memorizing them! \n\nOther great dishes I've tried here include the lamb curry, the naan-like bread that's buttery like croissants (very special!), the famous tea-leaf salad which isn't like a salad you've ever tried, and a spicy lychee nut mango salad appetizer that was on special one day.. really, I don't think it's possible to order anything here that isn't good.\n\nThe service is excellent. The waitstaff mix the salads and noodles for you at your table, explaining what everything is with the utmost patience and grace. We've always been impressed by the service.\n\nThe great thing about this place, too, is that it's never too crowded like some of the other places nearby. The one time (out of I'd say 5 times I've been there) that it was crowded, they were still on their game and gracious hosts. Everyone waiting was treated to free wine. Awesome.\n\nSo yes, I highly recommend this place. It's one of the best things ever.", "author": "Sherah S."}

I'm not saying that Mandalay isn't a nice restaurant to check out (hence the solid 3 stars). There really wasn't anything necessarily bad about it. On the other hand, I went here for Burmese, and instead got mandalay chicken, aka the equivalent of panda express's orange chicken with a thai sweet chili sauce that you can find in a bottle at an asian supermarket (I'm pretty sure even Trader Joe's has these sauces on their shelves too) \n\nOur dishes:\n- Chicken satay appetizer: had an initial kick of curry taste, but was followed by an overcooked dryness and a bland peanut sauce\n- Coconut rice: good, but not as coconut-ey has Burma Superstar's\n- Mandalay chicken (see above)\n- The girly got a burmese iced tea, which was like any thai iced tea, but this one wasn't as overly sweet as you may find in other restaurants that overdo the sweet condensed milk\n\nThe only reason you should choose Mandalay over Burma Superstar is that the wait might not be as long since it's a bigger restaurant and you might be into the suuuppperr ghetto menu (prices pen-written and taped on) and tacky decorations.", "author": "Ronald T."}

I'd much rather see hoards of people waiting outside Burma Superstar while I get seated quickly and eat a delicious meal at Mandalay. Staff is super friendly. On some crowded nights, they  provide free wine while you wait. Even though the white wine has the quality of nail polish remover, it's at least a thoughtful gesture most other places don't provide. \n\nFood recommendations are endless. A must have is the Burmese Yellow Chicken Curry. The texture of the chicken and potatoes are perfect, while the sauce is what Yellow Curry should always taste like. Not a large portion but keep in mind these are actually how big portions should be. This is isn't Chile's or TGIF people! Paired with the coconut rice, you'll definitely go home happy. The tea leaf salad is outstanding. They prepare the 9(?) ingredient dish in front of you. Just be careful of the lemon squirt at the end. I caught the acerbic juices in the eye once.......\n\nLast several times, I've ordered the Samusas - a move I'm sticking with and highly recommend. The prawns in the prawn dishes are massive and flavorful. Most people I've shared the Walnut Prawn dish with are on one side of the fence or the other as it's unique sweet glaze provide a  \"hate-it-or-love-it\" response. A more conservative solid prawn choice is the Basil Prawn or Pan Fry Prawn with String Bean. I'm not a huge fan of coconut, but people rave over the coconut water served in a giant coconut. \n\nThe complimentary dessert looks like a gelatinous french fry. Tastes better than it looks. Pretty much the only item I don't like is a lemony noodle dish (my apologies for not remembering the name). The menu is quite large so one dish out of a several dozen is more than acceptable. Not everything can be perfect - keep in mind, even Heidi Klum has bad cuticles.\n\n\nTo sum up: it's a fantastic Burmese option even amongst the several quality Burmese choices in the area. The pricing is appropriate and it's nearly impossible to go home unhappy. But please don't let this review sway you into coming to Mandalay if you're a new-bie. I don't like waiting for good quality food.", "author": "Alex O."}

There can only be so much to add for a business that already has 227 reviews, but recent return visits have impressed me enough that I must share and add my own praise.\n\nLately, I've been a slave to the walnut broccoli tofu and coconut rice combination.

Unlike the more common genres of Asian cuisine, I've learned here that Burmese flavors tend to have a spicier, tangier kick to 'em, which I adore. The 2 items that have become mainstays for me here would be \n\n1. Balada: very similar to the roti/rotee. Served with a curry-like sauce. Greasy and HEAVENLY scrumptious in your mouth.\n\n2. Nan Gyo Dok noodles. All their noodles are pretty good, but the NGD ones are the best, in my opinion. The Singapore noodles remind me much of Flipino pancit noodles, and the Mandalay noodles are a fatter version of NGD. But NGD consists of the perfect sized linguini-like noodles, mixed together with a whole bunch of delicious surprises that capture the essence of that unique Burmese zest I mentioned earlier.\n\nOh, and it's kind of like Christmas in here, too.

If you like Thai, Indian, and Vietnamese cuisine, then you'll do just fine here. If you prefer foods on the more mellow side, then Mandalay might not be the place for you.\n\nLast night, I ordered the ginger salad, white rice, roti appetizer (bread with dipping sauce), and string beans with tofu. I do prefer the tea leaf salad vs. ginger salad, but both are good.\n\nThe waitress clarified and asked, \"Is the ginger salad your entree?\" I answered, \"Yes, with the rice please.\" I was expecting to get the roti appetizer first. Nope, out came the ginger salad ....no rice. I waited 15 minutes. No one noticed I wasn't eating the salad. So, my mom asked for rice for me. Thanks mom!\n\nI was still waiting for the roti appetizer. 30 minutes into the meal, it still didn't come. I went ahead and started with the salad. Then we asked the wait staff to check in on our food. Finally, my mom's entree comes. They seemed annoyed that we kept asking for the roti...finally, 40 minutes after we put in our order...the appetizer comes.\n\nMoral of the story: don't order an appetizer unless you want it for dessert.\n\nWorse than sending our food out in an untimely manner? The waitress asked to clear our table before I even finished eating! I was chewing my food and she asks, \"Are you all finished?\" I couldn't answer with my mouth full, so she watched me eat while waiting for an answer. She cleared a few dishes. And then every minute, she came back to clear a few more though we weren't finished with the meal. I don't know what the rush was.

But after hearing Burmese people recommend Mandalay, I decided to give it a shot and would say that I'm fairly satisfied.\n\nService is great here!  A week in advance, I made a reservation for ten people on a Saturday night.  We got there fifteen minutes before our designated time and a table was already ready for us.  I even got to order all the food before our entire party showed up to decrease the lag time and they had no problem with that.  Even though this is a Burmese/Mandarin restaurant, I didn't expect it to have so many Chinese dishes.  The menu is pretty evenly split between the two types.  The appetizers & soup that we ordered is definitely Burmese though.  For rice, you can get steam, brown or coconut rice... one order can serve two people.  I recommend the coconut!\n\nSamusa (curried chicken & potatoes wrapped in skin & deep fried) - Better than Burma Superstar's by far.  Perfectly crisp outside & seasoned inside.  Comes with 5 pieces, pickled vegetables & some hot sauce (I think it's Thai sriracha.... I have a bottle at home).  You can also get this vegetarian.\n\nBalada (Burmese crispy pancake with curry dipping sauce) - I've eaten this all my life and this place makes it good.  I wonder if they actually make their own balada or get it from someone.  The curry was mediocre though... a little chunky and I wasn't even sure what was in it that made it that way.\n\nRainbow Salad (Salad prepared with eight ingredients served with house special dressing) - Only 8 ingredients?  When Burma Superstar has 22?  Just kidding, I don't even like Burma Superstar.  This dish is refreshing to eat... you can definitely taste the lemongrass. I still recommend the Tea Leaf Salad since that's the most popular Burmese salad.\n\nMoo Hin Nga (Catfish chowder with rice noodles, ground catfish, onions, and cilantro) - Very good!  Tasted like there was some time and effort put into it since this dish normally takes a while cook.  It's the pho/ramen/kimchichigae of Burma.  If you haven't had this soup before, it's on the heavier side so it can be treated as another entree instead of an appetizer.\n\nRangoon Beef (Marinated beef sauted with tomato, onions and green chili) - Now this is more of a Chinese tasting dish.  Good but nothing special.\n\nMango Chicken (Pan Fry chicken sauted with fresh mango, onions and green chili) - Sweet and tasty.  They put a lot of mango pieces in it.\n\nPumpkin Chicken Curry - Served in a little green pumpkin.  I wasn't particularly impressed but some others enjoyed it.  It's not a thick curry but it goes well with the coconut rice.\n\nDry Pan String Bean (Pan fried string beans, ginger and chili sauce) - This is actually a very simple dish to make.  If I knew what it was, I wouldn't have ordered it because we make it all the time at home.  I would recommend ordering something else unless you're in the mood for string beans or something simple.\n\nMandalay Noodle (Burmese flat noodle with mild coconut chicken, yellow pea powder, lime juice, onion and fried thin noodle on the top) - It actually tasted very similar to the Rainbow Salad.  It's a cold dish and they mix it at your table but they don't explain what the ingredients are to you like they do at Burma Superstar.  \n \nGinger Tea Lemonade - It tastes weird at first but after you mix it and let it sit for a while, it's quite delicious.  Presentation is nice... it's served in a tall glass.\n\nBetween Mandalay & Burma Superstar, it's definitely Mandalay for me.  The wait is shorter & it's less crowded inside.  I like the intimate feel & decor... they have Burmese artifacts and photos around the restaurant.  Also, the food tastes more authentic & less commercialized.", "author": "Shannon L."}

The place can get crowded during prime time and especially during Friday/Saturday nights. Mandalay is the place to go if you don't want to deal with the crazy lines at the Burma Superstar nearby. The ambiance is a tacky in a kinda cool way. Place is packed and tables are cramped together, but it's all ok because the food is always good.

Just as good as Burma Superstar but without the hype or wait. \n\nGot take out here last week. We ordered the Tea Leaf Salad, Mandalay Noodles, Veg. Hot and Sour soup, mango prawns, and coconut rice. The tea leaf salad was a disappointment to me. Compared to the salad at Burma Superstar, this one was different. Only 3 shreds of lettuce with a bunch of nuts and sesame seeds...it was quite different. Not even a salad. Just tea leaf and nuts. The hot and sour soup was the best dish of the night. Not too spicy and not to sour. The mango prawns came in second. The mangoes were so good and sweet. Not mushy and didn't affect the prawns that were lightly dipped in batter. The coconut was VERY good. So fragrant and fresh. \n\nI would def suggest this place. Especially if you want a different Burmese restaurant. Decor is simple and elegant. Very spacious, not so packed like BB is. You can take your time here and don't have to feel rushed.", "author": "Katie Anne N."}

Didn't have the tea leaf salad but it looked awesome.  You may want to get a little bit more info about the dishes before ordering-- the Mandalay beef, which we thought would be more \"Burmese\" is kind of like really good Chinese take-out sweet and sour pork (but with beef).  The string beans and tofu is also a more Cantonese style dish.  Not that they aren't tasty, they just didn't seem super Burmese.  Next time we'll ask the server.  Who, did I mention, was probably the nicest little asian lady I've ever met.  She offered us a drink the second we walked in and made sure to give us updates on the status of our table.

Sure, Mandalay lacks Burma's cult following and revered status, but it's food is pretty good. Burma's food is slightly better, but you're also paying a premium and get smaller portions.

I always thought that restaurants had a giant pot of soup and just pour it in to save some time.  Oh well.  It tasted sort of like Tom Yum soup in my opinion.\n- 20 minutes pass, balada comes.  By itseft, meh, but with the curry sauce, it was pretty decent.\n- 25 more minutes til the Mandalay Special Noodle came.  The waitress stirred all the stuff together at the table.  It was very inconsistent throughout.  Some of the bites had sauce, while others tasted just like lemons.  The noodles reminded me of linguine pasta.\n-15 more minutes, the singapore syle noodles came.  I actually really like this dish.  I thought it was kind of ironic liking a dish with the name Singapore in it at a Burmese restaurant.\n-15 more minutes and the duck and dessert came.

Space is tight, for all of us being in our petite asian nature, we are already seated arm to arm.\n\nWe ordered quickly seeing so many new tables being seated.  The table came quickly but not altogether.  There are about 5 mins apart for each dish coming out.  Even for the burmese pancake, the same item for 2 orders, there was a wait.  \n\nFood is not as good as burma on clement.  Overuse of the dried fried garlic on most dishes.  The tea leaf salad is nothing but peanuts, fried garlic, and a mish-mash of other things, but the flavor blended but is not tasty.  It is just overcome with garlic. \n\nServers started getting much busier and their service was lacking.  Even when spilling over 2 glasses of water on the table and running onto our pants and seats, the server or manager did not sincerely apologize.  Our whole table had to try to get out of our already tight seats so water would run down on us from the table.  I knew this was an accident, but they could've been more sincere and apologetic.  I hardly think I heard the server say anything.  We cleaned up ourselves and just ordered her to bring us more napkins/towels, etc.  Apparently she/they do not know how to handle situations like this.\n\nThe food overall was below par.  Again, too much garlic, too salty.  Doesnt bring out the flavor of the food itself too much.  \n\nThai Tea - too sweet\nTea Leaf Salad - NO! Too dry / fried garlicy.  Go home and mix all your herb spices together and throw in some nuts, that's how it'll taste.\nCurry Lamb - too gammy\nString Beans - bit oversalted but texture is good\nPancake - texture is good but dipping sauce is bland (no much peanut or curry flavor)\nHome-make chili (dipping sauce) - we call this a NOT HOT chili sauce\nFlat noodle - good on first taste, lemony, as it gets cold, gets pasty\nSizzling beef - chinese style stiry fry with chestnuts, bell pepper, snappeas on hotplate\nMango Salad - this is good\nPrawn seafood - this is good, made with asparagus big prawns.\n\nLines started forming so server rushed us away by quickly removing all our plates and brought the bill.", "author": "Ju D."}

I really wanted authentic Burmese food because I've only had it at my friend's house and was dying for more.  The appetizers and soup that my friends and I ordered were reminiscent of authentic Burmese, but the rest of the dishes were very Chinese.  A little too oily for my taste and the spices in the food weren't that memorable.\n\nWe ordered one coconut rice and one order of brown rice.  I love that they have the brown rice option!  I thought the coconut rice would be like sticky rice, but I think it's just white rice cooked with coconut milk.  The texture/consistency is just like white rice but with a hint of coconut taste.\n\nService was excellent.  Our table for 10 was all setup and ready for us in the back when we got there.  The head manager quickly got a waitress over to us as soon as we said we were ready to order and our first dishes arrived within 15 minutes.", "author": "Angela C."}

I think it may have even had more than 12 ingredients but it was just a lot of fun and everything in it tasted delicious. It even had little potatoes in it (I love potatoes). We also had the Broccoli Walnut Tofu. It was a little bit spicy, and the walnuts were a delicious touch. A lot of times, tofu in dishes like this can be very spongy and taste too fried, but it was warm and soft inside--very good!

Let's first discuss the food.\n\nI am new to Burmese cuisine, so I can by no means comment on authenticity.  However, I know what I like, and this food is absolutely amazing. First of all, you must start with the tea leaf salad. Unlike Burma Superstar, they do NOT put lettuce in their tea leaf salad. As a result, Mandalay's tea leaf salad is actually better--and probably more authentic! For entrees, we ordered the mandalay special noodle with tofu--I COULD DIE! and rainbow shrimp--YUM!  Both were winners. I should also say that I've been here with a group of 8 before, and we got lots of dishes which we shared family style, and everything I tasted was phenomenal.  One particular stand-out was a lamb dish which came with Burmese bread.  Let me just say, that bread was so buttery and delish, I'm surprised it doesn't come with more dishes. \n\nNext, the service was top-notch.  There were at least 10 people working the dining room making sure water glasses were filled, hot tea was replenished, used dishes were cleared, etc. They all worked together so cohesively to make sure all guests' needs were met. Right on, Mandalay staff!\n\nIn conclusion, Burma Superstar is good, but this little gem is better. They don't need to claim to be a \"Superstar\" restaurant--the food and service speak for itself!", "author": "Emille L."}

They forgot about us at the start-- we had to ask about or salad after waiting 20 minutes.\n2. They didn't have tapioca ready for our drink so they urged us to cancel the drink vs. offer us to wait and ask whether that was okay. We told them we were okay waiting... But then they forgot about us again! So we cancelled the drink 1 hour after ordering it.\n3. Then they screwed up our curry. They gave us shrimp curry vs. fish ball curry. Btw- the curry was forgotten as well we had to remind them we were still waiting for dish.\n4. After the curry, we got the check and they accidentally split the bill 3 way vs. 4 way\n5. Overall slow service-- understand it could have been a busy day but still... Multiple errors aren't excusable.

The restaurant features a variety of savory and sweet dishes and is a great place for dinner with friends/family, especially if you aren't familiar with traditional Burmese cuisine. The place itself is not that big so table space is limited so many people waiting for tables have to stand close to one another by the entrance. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere with plenty of ornaments and decorations and it's not incredibly loud so you're still able to talk to your friends/family at the dinner table.\n\nThe waiters are very friendly and often described many of the dishes we ordered upon arriving at the table. What was also pretty neat was that many of the dishes are actually prepared at the table, ensuring the crispiness of some of the dishes' ingredients. For the Rainbow Salad, Tea Leaf Salad, and the Mandalay Special Noodles that we ordered, all the ingredients are displayed on the dish before the waiter mixes and prepares it for you. I would definitely recommend the Rainbow Salad, Tea Leaf salad, Mandalay Special Noodles, and the Dry String Beans! Each dish was very flavorful and it was pretty cool seeing the waiter prepare the dishes after explaining each ingredient to us and mixing it all in together to bring out the full flavor of the dishes. The noodles were especially delicious - the flat noodles were cooked in a curry broth with coconut chicken and a range of spices and then topped with fried noodles! Delicious. I would also recommend getting the Balada - crispy doughy pancake-like pastries that one tops with a curry sauce. Great for sharing and starting off the meal.\n\nAll in all, delicious food and a great atmosphere for group gatherings. I'd definitely suggest making a reservation as the place was consistently busy throughout the entire night. Only downside of this place in my opinion is the wait time - we made a reservation for 7 PM and still had to wait upon arriving for another 30 minutes or so. Aside from that minor disappointment, I'll probably plan on coming back eventually especially when I'm craving Burmese food.", "author": "Cheston W."}

Similar to Mingalaba's version but not as good\n- Mandalay Special Noodles: I really wanted to like these but the flavors were a bit muted for my liking.

I recommend doing this to get the most variety of dishes.  \n\nFor appetizers we ordered the Green Papaya Salad, Samusa Soup, and Balada.  I loved the papaya salad, especially the grounded shrimps in it.  I was a little hesitant about the samusa soup, but it is definitely worth trying if you like spicy food. The curry dipping sauce for the balada, which is like a crispy pancake, had a strong ginger taste, but I liked it.\n\nFor the main course we ordered Rangoon Spicy Prawns, Basil Beef, Curry Chicken, Burmese Style Noodles, and Combination Fried Rice.

These were her comments when I asked about why Burma SuperStar and Mandalay serve very similar dishes.  I did a little research, and Mandalay has more authentic Burmese dishes than Burma SuperStar.  And my favorite dish, Nan Gyi Dok, I have decided is better at Mandalay after having it both places. Although I have friends that swear they like Mandalay better, I'm still undecided. I do like how the interior and scene of Mandalay seems more authentic  than the other restaurants and yet I am also still a fan of Burma SuperStar, because some of Mandalay's dishes (like some of the breaded chicken dishes) remind me a little too much of cheap take out chinese.  But all and all, it was pretty darn good.  And, the portions are bigger and cheaper than Burma Super Star.  \n\nTry the Nan Gyi Dok and the green papaya salad, and do research beforehand online about what Burmese dishes you want to try, instead of falling prey to their large menu, which has many ok Chinese dishes that aren't worth ordering.", "author": "Erica L."}

Even without considering how busy the place was the service was extremely attentive (bordering on aggressive), the food was very good.\n\nBased on that, I went back with two coworkers for lunch this past Friday.  Blech.  We started with chicken samosas and each ordered a \"lunch special\".  Despite being mostly empty, the samosas took thirty(!!) minutes to arrive.  The coworkers loved them, but they were *greasy*.  If I were looking for Chinese influenced samosas I'd go for the golden triangles at Marnee Thai.\n\nTwo of the specials were a plate + soup of the day, one was two plates.  First our rice came out, about five minutes before the first two plates came.  So, you know, we got to sit around and stare at a pot of rice that was doing nothing other than growing cold.\n\nEventually, the third plate came out... and finally my plate, the mango chicken, came out.  The chicken bits were so salty you could feel the salt on the chicken.  Disgusting.  \n\nAfter we ate as much of our food as we could, we inquired about the soup that was supposed to accompany the \"lunch specials\".  Neither the soup nor the excuses were noteworthy.  The fortune cookies were, however, notable for being burnt.\n\nMan.  I'm  firm believer that a restaurant should focus on what they can do well.  Well... Mandalay can't do lunch.

Tea Leaf Salad is a must, as is the pumpkin pork curry with coconut rice and the eggplant dish. Every dish the server collected was totally clean, we loved it all! The restaurant itself is very cozy and has a hokey, old time-y feeling about it (Christmas lights, leafy plants, drinks with umbrellas in them, etc).\n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful in providing recommendations for a larger party, as if he were used to this sort of thing. They were very prompt in filling up our water glasses and picking up finished plates. Lovely, lovely.\n\nThe unfortunate terribly bad news: Apparently it doesn't make a difference whether or not you make a reservation, even for 13 PEOPLE! The restaurant was totally full when I arrived and they would not seat us until the entire party was there, even though I knew 2 people were going to be 30 minutes late. My party filled up the entire entryway, making it incredibly awkward and uncomfortable for other people to wait for their tables too. I don't know why they called to confirm the reservation the day before, even if all 13 of us had been there on time, there would have been NO table available for us anyway! We weren't seated until 45 minutes after the reservation time, well after my late friends arrived. If that wasn't bad enough, the hostess was very frowny, curt and unfriendly, reminding me of the Michael Scott quote: \"This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here!\" \nWe were squeezed into a small table and, although we were able to add one on, she sighed and pouted like we were ruining her life. Did I mention I made a reservation two weeks in advance??\nTherefore, minus one really BIG, FAT star for the rough start. I was stressed out when we sat down, but after the drinks came out and I spoke with the friendly server, I started to feel a little better. The food was really it's saving grace, I will definitely be back to try some more dishes!\n\nMoral of the Story: Do not expect your reservation to count for anything, even if you have a large party. Arrive early on a busy night or prepare to get comfortable in the waiting area.", "author": "Liz M."}

I knew that this place would be packed and everyone in the cramped waiting area, who I assumed were regulars, lamented over the fact that this place was much more crowded than usual.  \nMuch of the food was average.  The food that we received in a timely manner was dry (odd) and my entree was forgotten.  I assumed it was sitting out in the window for a VERY long time because the outside was completely cold.  I almost sent it back but the inside was still warm so if they had re-heated it the inside would dry out :( .\n\nThe manager (or owner?) was walking around the crowded restaurant chatting it up with the larger dining parties.  This seems like a friendly gesture of a professional staff.  However, this individual did not walk over the tables for two where many of us were ignored and did not receive our entrees in a timely manner.  Maybe it's because we all had angry expressions on our faces but the service was pretty bad and I was quite ready to complain.\n\nAnyway,   the main let down was the fact that the food was not very good.  Perhaps this place is popular for its Burmese flavors but why get balada here if there's a better version at another Thai or Singaporean restaurant?  The same goes for the duck and catfish curry.  Both dishes have far superior equivalents at Chinese and Thai restaurants.", "author": "Amber R."}

We were not at all disappointed.\n\nWe shared all dishes family style and this is what we had:\n\nBalada - the bread with the curry dipping sauce, OMG, craving it now.\nSamusa - Very good, not greasy at all and a nice sauce to dip them in, too.  The pickled veggies were a real plus for me.\nRainbow Salad - a party on the plate and in your mouth.  It looked like 15-20 ingredients, tossed tableside and filled with crunch and flavor.\nMango Chicken - delicious with fresh mango.  I want to try the Mandalay Chicken next time for an added kick of spice\nCoconut rice - delicious, light coconut flavor and the fried onions on top really made this.\nPan-Fried Prawn with Green Beans - This dish was really delicious, too.  I sound like a broken record, but there was nothing we ate that was not delicious.\nMandalay Special Noodle - Another tossed at the table dish that was a party in your mouth.  Creamy, coconut curry-ish taste, props for the kaffir lime leaves in the dish.  \n\nWe also shared the fried banana dessert and the ice cream was incredibly good!  There is another dessert with tapioca, ice cream and little jello shots we need to try.\n\nThe service was leisurely, the food delicious, they did not rush us out at all.  This was nice considering the place filled up after we got there with very steady clientele.  The noise level was low and the place still felt peaceful and nice even though the staff was hopping.  Also had the most gorgeous arrangement of orchids on our table.\n\nAbsolutely will be going back, the party d\u00e9cor of the place goes well with the party of flavor in your mouth.

Mandalay has many similar items on the menu like the tea leaf salad and samusas which taste just as great but the other items like the lamb and beef lack that \"pizazz.\" The food is a little more greasy but the meat and veggies are very fresh. The flavors are just slightly more mellow and I prefer the robustness of Burma. \n\nThe atmosphere is much better for groups because there is no long wait and the tables are much bigger with room around them- not like Burma where you kick elbows with your neighbor. \n\nI  have no problem going here on a regular basis where as I have to save up just to treat myself to Burma.

But everyone has a favorite. And this one might be mine.\n\nI've been coming here since I was a kid, but it is only now, as a full grown vegan, that I truly appreciate the greatness of this place. First of all, the service is impeccable. They are attentive without being officious, and always find a way to accommodate your requests. As a vegan, this is huge. HUGE.\n\nExample: in my non-vegan childhood, I used to order the sizzling rice soup here, which isn't vegan (it's made with a meat broth). Now, I order the hot and sour soup, vegetarian (they have two varieties) with no egg and a side of sizzling rice. Do they always bring me exactly that? Yes. Do they ever give me a funny look? Never. \n\nA ton of their tastiest dishes have vegetarian (vegan) alternatives. All you have to do is ask. My favorites are the mango salad (no dried shrimp) and the pan friend string beans (no dried shrimp). \n\nIf you don't order dessert, they almost always bring you a mini-dessert on the house.

Asked the roommate what he was getting into for dinner, and he wasn't quite in the mood to eat yet. So, I decided to utilize ol' Yelp to track down a new spot to eat at whilst he did whatever he needed to do to to get his appetite  up and running. \n\nAs I searched for cheap restaurants that were in either the Inner or Outer 'hood, up popped the Mandalay. \n\nBurmese you say? I've never had it! \n\n(and So I read on...)\n\nConsistently good reviews, a few dishes being repeatedly mentioned...affordable..close to home...BINGO! \n\nLemme just say, I was not expecting the dinner to be THAT good. \n\nApparently the roommate had already tried this spot on a date a year or so ago, and when we got there, he said he remembered it being good. *woohoo!*  I made sure to read the specials on the menu board to see if anything caught my eye. When I 1st moved to the Bay Area, I read an article from some food reviewer who mentioned trying specials when you can, as they're often a unique creation the chef normally doesn't prepare. Tonight I see \"Pumpkin Curry Pork Stew\" on the specials....you had me at \"pork\".\n\nNow, I have had some pumpkin curries before, and I already love them - but man oh man - this stuff was a complete foodgasm. The pork was so juicy and tender, and complemented the pumpkin so well...you don't even KNOW!  *drool*. I also noticed they had a saffron & cinnamon rice (called \"Tom Poi\" I think), and I thought it sounded like it would sit under the curry pretty well...it was out of this world combined. In fact, I think I might have to lobby to have that particular combo put on the menu permanently, just so I can eat it once a week. Yes indeedy folks - THAT good. \n\nThe Samusas (a Mandarin style Samosa), and what I tasted of my roomie's Rainbow Prawn dish (prawns w/ pineapple, red bell pepper, onion in a light and tangy sauce) were all really spot on as well. Veggies cooked to perfection ,flavors not muddled - and the prices were really reasonable.  \n\nThe staff was super courteous and friendly as well...total win on all points, especially for (me) trying the place for the 1st time. I will, DEFINITELY be back. The menu is big enough to let your palette roam a bit. \n\nTwo thumbs up.", "author": "Marco M."}

Anyways, here is what we ordered:\n1. Appetizers: Samusas and Baladas   \nThese were good, but while eating them I distinctly remembered that they were not as good as Mingalaba.  Tasty, but a little on the heavy side.\n2. Salad: Tea Leaf Salad\nThis was just OK compared to Mingalaba.  It seemed like the garlic was overbearing.  \n3. Hot and Sour soup\nThis was actually pretty good.  Good consistency and lots of ingredients with flavor.\n4. Basil Beef\nIf I'm remembering the right dish, I think this was pretty good too.  I thought the beef was cooked right and had good flavor.\n5. Burmese Style Curry Chicken\nThis was just OK, pretty mild from what I remember.  I ordered this just to see what kind of flavor they would have.  Also, the chicken pieces seemed a little over cooked. \n6. Mandalay Eggplant\nI enjoyed this dish, and eggplant is one of the vegetables I actually do not like. The eggplant had lots of flavor and was actually a little sweet. It wasn't over cooked either.\n7. Sauteed Peashoot with Garlic\nI enjoyed this dish a lot. Good flavor and good consistency.\n8. Mandalay Special Noodle\nThis was a dish that they mix at your table just like the Tea Leaf Salad. I liked this a lot.  I like the crunchy noodles mixed with the soft noodles. Good dish!\n9. Coconut rice\nI really don't like coconut but I enjoyed their coconut rice a lot, and ate it with almost every other dish!  Impressive.\n10. Coconut ice cream with Strawberry cookie stick thingys\nThis was just OK (I didn't enjoy it as much as the rice) but the Strawberry cookie wafer was pretty good.\n\nThe portions are fairly small here, which is why we ordered this much food.  The six of us finished all of the food, four guys and two girls.   \nParking is decent, we found parking down the block fairly easily. \nReservations are a must here unless you want to wait a really long time.

How can it be? \n\nThe food is just so high quality, so so so scrumptious. Unfortunately, I've only had a few dishes here so I can't offer an all-encompassing review on the food vs. burma sstar, but with the dishes I have tried I'd say Mandalay surpasses burma sstar with everything except the coconut rice. The chicken samusas..... I could die eating them. They are so incredibly flavorful and juicy. I could probably just order a bunch of them and have that for dinner. The tea leaf salad comes without lettuce which apparently is how the dish is traditionally made, and i like it better this way! More of the good stuff. The rainbow chicken is also delicious. \n\nI don't know if I could ever write off Burma Superstar, especially since I live in Oakland and there's one on my side, but sadly, no Mandalay.

Everyone seems to be raving about the tea leaf salad, but everyone that I had dinner with liked the tea leaf salad the least. \n\nThis is definitely a good place to go when you are craving Asian food, but want to try something other than the usual Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese food. I would say that my first time having Burmese food was a success!", "author": "Patricia L."}

Usually end up with pumpkin curry, or Singapore noodles, or both.  The food is always amazing.  The staff is attentive and friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-09", "description": "We had an atrociously long wait at Saturday night for 2 people around 7. I don't think we were seated until after an hour even though the hostess told me the wait would be around 20-30 minutes. Since we weren't starving, I was determined to wait it out. But seriously, the waiting area was like a crowded subway compartment..ugh. \n\nAnyway onto the food. We started with the chicken samusas, which were delicious! The presentation is also very nice and make the samusas look uber plump and appetizing. Comes with 4 and I would recommend eating only one because eating 2 like I did will ruin your appetite..\n\n..especially if you also order the balada appetizer. It's like the Burmese version of roti canai and I love it! The curry is not very spicy but has a sweet and unique taste to it. The flatbread is not so hot that your skin burns if contact lasts more than a few seconds. It's also not overly greasy which I appreciate. Yum yum but again should probably shared among 3+ people.\n\nBecause I was really interested in the coconut rice we got a complementary dish, Catfish Curry. My only issue with the catfish is its bones, but what can you do. The quality of the fish is good and I enjoyed Burmese curry more than I thought I would! It's also not very spicy, and goes with the coconut rice very well. The coconut rice is addicting...you can eat it by itself and be happy...\n\nAnd we also got an order of the pan dry fried string beans which was quite good. The flavor is really strong though so it would be most enjoyable to eat with rice or some kind of bland starch. \n\nI would have given Mandalay 3 stars, but the exemplary customer service we received has earned it another star in my heart. We had wanted the remainder of our balada to take home, but when we were leaving, the waitress apologetically informed us that they must have accidentally thrown it out. No worries, we said, and we walked off into the blistery night.\n\nA few minutes later, we hear rapid footsteps running after us, turn around, and lo and behold, a waitress is flagging us down with our doggie bag! She ran almost an entire block and across an intersection (in a skirt!) just to give us our balada. This unnecessarily kind act has inspired in me a lot of tender feelings for the Mandalay staff.", "author": "Lydia W."}

This place comes highly recommended by a few friends and had a lot of good reviews on Yelp. I came in with high hopes and really wanted to like this place. \n\n1. My sister arrived before the rest of the family. She checked in with the hostess; told her we have reservations. She was not seated nor updated about the reservations situation. I arrive and proceeded to tell a server that I have reservations. The server asked for my name and walked off. I had no idea what was going on because no one told us anything. No ''Ok, your table will be ready soon.\" or \"Let me check on your table for you.\"\n2. We were finally seated. We were asked if we wanted water. Instead we asked for tea for everyone. We were charged $1 per person for tea. \n3. A man came to introduce himself and told us about the restaurant. Gave us a few moments to look over the menu. When we were ready, we flagged him down and gave him our choices. He said that the soup would not be enough for the 5 of us and suggested we added a half order. We declined. He again gave us a recommendation of a dish we ordered. The rock cod to be made rangoon style. He asked about rice and we said 2 orders was fine. \n4. The man lied about the soup. It was MORE than enough for 5ppl. Actually three people were able to get 2nds. \n\nOff to the food...\n* bbq skewers: we were not asked if we wanted beef or chicken. we really wanted beef but instead, we were given chicken.\n* balada: it was not bad but not memorable. the pancake was a little chewier than I would like. The curry dipping sauce did not taste like curry, not even a hint.\n* Jia San Hinga (Black Pepper Soup): Oh man...this soup is no joke. It was definitely very peppery. Thats all it was. Pepper. \n* Shaking Duck: this dish was NOT worth it AT ALL. a whopping $16 for 2 pcs of thinly sliced duck per person. \n* Rangoon Rock Cod: this is by far the best dish. The cod was fried but the ratio of batter and fish was just right.\n* Burmese Style Noodle (Kaw Soi Dok): not a fan. was supposed to be spicy but not at all.\n* Walnut Broccoli Tofu: another good dish. i loved the sauce and broccoli was cooked perfectly. again, not spicy. \n\nCons:\n* my sister found pieces of plastic in one of the dishes. \n* you know when you run out of tea in the teapot, you removed the lid to let them know you need more tea? well, for some reason...this restaurant does not understand that sign. we had to flag them down several times for tea.\n* they would take away dishes when we weren't even done with them yet. we had to tell them twice to leave it. \n* the dishes came out super slow and when it did finally leave the kitchen, it was cold or lukewarm\n\nUgh, this was a horrible dinner experience. AND I walked away $100 poorer. So not worth it. Such a disappointment.", "author": "Serena F."}

I'd been here before and really enjoyed it, so now I can report that whether you go with 3 people or 13 people, the quality is not compromised.\n\nfirst of all, both times i noticed the service was incredibly attentive and friendly.  I drink a lot of water with my meals and when I'm with a huge group, waiters often neglect timely refills because of the huge crowd of items on the table, but Mandalay never let me go thirsty yesterday.  The food comes out pretty quickly and the servers always describe what you're getting if it has a ton of ingredients.  \n\nIn terms of the actual food, I've never gotten a dish I didn't like, so I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong.  The mango salad is delicious.  The curries, noodles, and stir-fries are exactly what you'd expect from a quality establishment.  The portions are also relatively sizable (we shared 7 entrees among 13 of us, following 3 sets of appetizers and yet we all left full, and when 3 of us shared 3 entrees we had lunch for the next day).\n\nThis is good, quality Burmese food in a nice environment with a helpful staff.

It went through up's and down's and (I believe, but could be wrong) few changes of ownerships. I really like what they have done with it in the most recent years - from food to decor to service.\n\n If you stop by on any given week night - place would be packed. For that very reason I rarely eat-in, and usually take-out. They do not deliver, which is fine by me, since it gives me a reason to walk my dog and baby for 20 blocks each way. \n\nHere are some things I have ordered in the past:\n\nSatay Chicken / Beef - just ok. Chicken can be a bit dry, and I usually like beef better.\n\nSamusa (with Chicken or Vegetarian) - is tasty. I don't care much for the hot sauce they serve it with.\n\nBalada - is more chewy than flaky, but still good. Dipping sauce has too much curry for my taste.\n\nHot and Sour Soup (Chinese version) - is my favorite. I usually substitute pork for shrimp. It is not too hot and not too sour, just right.\n\nShrimp Wonton Soup - is a must try. It is a light broth with chopped shrimp filled wontons.\n\nBasil Beef - I can eat every day. Perfectly spiced, bathing in a rich sauce, tender pieces of beef, basil leaves, shredded carrots and bell peppers. It also comes with onions, but I order mine without.\n\nWalnut Prawn - is one of the best around. Whole large prawns lightly battered. You barely taste batter - just the fleshy prawn covered in sweet dressing.\n\nSizzling Seafood - medley of sea critters in a light sauce with carrots, mushrooms and bell peppers. Also very flavorful. In a restaurant it is served on an iron plate, literally sizzling.\n\nBasil Spicy Eggplant  - similar to basil beef - also very good, if you like moist, slightly mushy eggplant. If you like a drier variety, try Mandalay Eggplant.\n\nMandalay Special Noodle - I was not impressed with. Maybe when ordering in the restaurant it would have tasted different, but as a to go dish it was lacking definition. Just a pasta noodles with curry sauce poured over it.\n\nSingapore Style Noodle  - has a better flavor, thinner noodles, but a bit too dry. Again, maybe this is a to-go thing.\n\nOverall, whatever you order, you will not be disappointed.", "author": "Katya L."}

I'll observe the next time I go there and see if anything changes. \n\nOur group ordered samosa soup, la pet dok (tea leaf salad) and oh no kau swe (noodles). The samosa soup was spicy and sour, and had bite-size pieces of samosas (or something similar to it). There was enough for 3 bowls, coincidentally. \n\nThe tea leaf salad was way smaller than I expected. When I went to Burma Superstar, the salad was way bigger -- but that could have been because I got VIP access. Either way, there was enough to share for the 3 of us, but only for a handful. The salad I had at Burma Superstar had more lettuce in the salad than tea leaves, but I really liked that the tea leaf salad here at Mandalay only had tea leaves, which is exactly how I usually eat it. \n\nAs for the noodle \"salad\", the meal came served in a weirdly shaped bowl that made it seem like there was less noodles than there actually was. The noodles weren't mixed well, and a lot of the meat and tofu sank to the bottom as we were splitting the noodles. Other than that, the noodles were good, flavorful and went down smoothly. Again, I just wish the portions were a bit larger, but it was filling. \n\nThe only other drawback was that the wait time for the food was a little long, and the waitress (or owner) tried to remember our orders but messed up not once, but twice. At first, me and my friends marveled at how she could have taken the orders without a pad of paper, but we realized her futile attempt after getting two random orders of food we had never ordered. Our server must have thought we were being forgetful, because she became annoyed after the second mix-up. \n\nIf I come back here again, I'd like to try the Burmese ice tea (I never knew there was a Burmese ice tea) and some of the desserts. However, the meal was enough for a light lunch, but not worth the price.", "author": "Vivian L."}

So we picked up one of our good friends but she told us that B Star would be a really long time, so she suggested this place! At first I was kinda disappointed but it turned out that I really liked it here. First off we got the vegetarian samusas which were oh-so-gooood. The presentation was fantastic. (I'm such a sucker for presentation). Next there was the combination chowmein thing that my sister had ordered. She said it was pretty good. Next the walnut prawns came in a funky looking plate/bowl thing. It was kind of salty but still fairly tasty. \nOHMYGOD. One thing that I LOVED LOVED LOVED was their coconut rice. i usually HATE coconut but this bowl of rice was DELICIOUS! I kept eating it and eating it! It's sweet yet edible. It feels kind of like butter in your mouth...except it's rice. \nNext came the spicy tofu with vegetables. I really liked this dish! It was spicy but had the perfect amount of flavor! It was quite wonderful and a great combo with the rice!\nFor desert we were treated to fried bananas! They were so yummy and the presentation (again) was amazing! We also got this jello thing which was eh... It was ... \"foreign\" and different. I wasn't into it so much. But then again, I don't really like jello in the first place.

If it was based on food alone this place would get 4 stars. \n\nFor me what realyl brought it down to 3 stars is the slow service. Upon walking in my guest and I were greeter by a friendly gentleman who I am assuming is the owner of the restaurant- I could tell just by the way he was dressed. What really ticked me off is our waiter who was sort of curt and unfriendly. He looked like he did not want to be there seriving us. Not once did he smile or show any friendly character. When he repeated our order he had a loud and unpleasant tone of voice. Not once were we checked up on or asked how our food turned out. Instead when we started eating he took off for about 45 minutes. A professional way of taking a break if you were already assisting someone would be to say, \"I am actually going to be heading out, but one of our other waitresses will be happy to assist you. Is there anything else I can get for you?\" But no, he just took off. \n\nThe other waitresses were rather very very firnedly, but the service was incredible slow. For exmaple I had to ask for peanut sauce twice, and I had to ask for a diet coke twice. The lady owner of the restuarant was very firendly though and was easy to flag down. \n\nMaybe I will be back and give this place another shot but I really feel like their service needs to improve.

I have been to Burma Superstar, B-Star, Rangoon Ruby in Palo Alto and Mingalaba in Burlingame but this place is my favorite! There can be a wait at times, but I usually go at 7:45pm and am seated pretty quickly. Good for families, though can be a little loud. The ambiance is nice, nicely decorated but not too fancy to feel like you have to dress up. \n\nRecommended things (in addition to tea leaf salad and any of the noodles):\n1) Dry Pan Fried String Bean - the sauce is so good! and beans perfectly cooked and slightly crispy\n2) Sizzling Rice Soup with Shrimp, Chicken & Scallop - light broth, seafood flavorful, and the sizzling rice is interesting and adds a nice crunch!", "author": "Gary S."}

I doubt that I will forget my second visit any time soon.\n\nCraving some spicy cuisine on a cold, winter night (on the eve of what is supposed to be SF's first snow day in years ... we'll see), we found ourselves at Mandalay for some hearty Burmese cuisine.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated in festive and somewhat kitschy decor, with hanging ornaments and paintings.\n\nThe tea leaf salad, while comprising simple fresh ingredients (fermented tea leaves, lentil seeds, grounded shrimps, fried garlic, green pepper, sesame seeds, peanuts, chopped lettuce & dressing) was delicious.  Love the different crunchy textures and the way they prepare it table-side.\n\nThe vegetarian samosa soup was also delicious.  One order serves two small bowls (although you will wish there was more).  Rich and creamy with lentils and beans, the broth contained broken pieces of yummy samosas.\n\nThe Rangoon beef (marinated beef with spices sauteed with tomato, green & red peppers, onions and green chili) was also a great dish that was reminiscent of more northeast Asian cuisine.  It balanced well with a side of coconut rice.\n\nFinally, the Mandalay special noodle (Burmese flat noodle with mild coconut chicken, yellow peas powder lime juice, onion and fried thin noodle on the top) was good but perhaps a bit overhyped compared to the other dishes.  Liked the contrast of the crispy, thin noodles with the flat noodles but the dish was a bit too creamy.\n\nStill, compared to the hectic feel of nearby Burma Superstar, it's nice to have a more calm, alternative that serves comparable Burmese cuisine in terms of presentation and quality.", "author": "F.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-20", "description": "Best example of authentic Burmese cuisine in the city of San Francisco!\n\nBeing raised by a Burmese father, I, of course, can identify a wonderfully prepared Burmese dish, and each one that I've had, at Mandalay, has reminded me of home. The best start to default to is the tea leaf salad.  There are a variety of flavors going on in it, nutty, fishy, garlicky, chili peppery, etc....  It really opens the taste buds and prepares them for anything you throw their way, later in the meal.  Another of my personal favorite starters is the fried squash.  It's type of summer squash, which is cut into strips, battered lightly and fried, accompanied with a savory sauce that can be drizzled over the top of each piece.  Mmmm, mmm, mmm, they're so hot and crisp, yum!  Ready to move to entree items?  Mohinga, a catfish noodle soup, is so comforting.  The catfish and ions are reduced to a point where they almost fuse together.  Of their curries (they have beef, lamb, chicken, and okra), the lamb is my favorite.  It's tender, and absorbs the flavors of the curry like a sponge.  I recommend ordering a bowl of coconut rice, if ordering any of the curries.  Mandalay's coconut rice earns its name!  The coconut flavor is very present, and it has a sticky texture to it, which makes me sometimes just want to eat it by itself.  When I go to Mandalay, I usually order so many items, that I am rarely able to handle dessert, but the couple of times that I was able to save room for it, I've had the mango and sticky rice, and the sticky rice, which are served in a shallow bath of sweetened coconut milk.  \n\nThe proprietor and all of her staff are wonderfully attentative and willing to explain anything on the menu, which you may have questions about.  Mandalay does get crowded, so my strategy is to arrive before I'm experiencing absolute starvation, to avoid getting cranky during the wait.  Once the wait is over, it always seems worth while, at the end of dinner, when I'm walking out the door!", "author": "Damon Z."}

The jasmine tea is a full flower that is put in a clear wine glass and blossoms in front of you.  \n\nThe taste rivals Burma.  I had the tea leaf salad, garlic okra and shrimp, mandalay noodle special, fried onion blossom with special dipping sauce, and coconut rice.  I would have all of them again, except the onion.  I could do without it.  My favorite out of those dishes was the okra and shrimp.  It had great flavor, texture, and balance.  They also don't skimp on the big, plump shrimp.  \n\nI would have ranked this as 4.5, but the mango and sticky rice was semi-upsetting.  Everything that was brought out made me say MMM and I was expecting an equal if not above standard finish.  I was disappointed.  My favorite asian dessert is stick rice & mango.

I tried Mandalay last week and then I went to Burma Superstar again tonight (Superbowl Sunday = no wait.)  I feel like I can now say with confidence that I prefer Mandalay- the flavors had a certain explosiveness that really does it for me.  \n\nI had the tea leaf salad, the chicken satay, and the Mandalay special noodle dish.  The tea leaf salad was nicely balanced and didn't have lettuce which made the rest of the flavors more intense.  The chicken satay was probably the best I've ever had- scrumptious with pickled veggies and a side of peanut sauce.  The Mandalay noodle dish (we had it with tofu), was wonderful and must have contained a lot of lemongrass.  The noodles had a nice mix of textures and tastes and I have never seen or tasted anything quite like this dish.  \nThe decor is bright and colorful in Mandalay, which I enjoy.  The dishes are also in bold colors.  The bathroom is nice.  All of these things make a difference to me- I can appreciate some bright and shiny in my dining experience.  I also overheard patrons casually chatting it up with the managers (possibly the owners) about the recent upward trend in business and concluded that Mandalay has a loyal following.

I am resisting the urge to compare/contrast you with Burma Superstar, because it seems patently unnecessary.  Can there only be one Burmese place in the neighborhood?  Clearly not, and Burmese food is certainly delicious enough in my book to merit alternatives.\n\nYour food is a mix of what seem to me closer to Chinese dishes, and the Burmese dishes I recognize based on your recommendations as well as my experiences at Burma Superstar, which I tried first.  My favorite dish so far is the Walnut Broccoli with Tofu, in a wonderful sweet sauce with honey-coated walnuts.  Yum.  I also enjoyed your tea leaf salad (always a winner) and your Burmese lamb curry.  Your Mandalay Chicken was tasty, but I think I'd order something else next time, as it very closely resembles sweet-and-sour chicken and I would rather enjoy your more specialized offerings.\n\nOn top of your lovely, well-prepared food, your space and atmosphere are friendly and the service is attentive.

Our food came out very slowly, more slowly than I would have expected for the number of people int he restaurant.\nThe table beside us was asked four separate times if they would like something other than water to drink, 2x by the same person.\nWhen the time came to get the check one of the owners brought us two other tables bills with credit cards inside. More unsavory people would have had a field day with that, we did not. Also not sure why he left two of them on the table.\n\nOverall\nWe will go again, try some other dishes and see (hope) that service improves.", "author": "Gmarie H."}

Truthfully, I'm not sure why this place has such high reviews. \n\nThree of us went to Mandalay on a Saturday night. We got here around 7ish and got seated at 8:30ish. Durning the time of the wait, the hostess (who I think is also the owner) gave out free wine for waiting. When the lobby got crowded, she offered 20% discount to those that were willing to wait outside in the cold. Which I think is GREAT customer service! She acknowledges the long wait and find ways to make sure we stayed! (p.s. later on I realized she kept telling people 30 min wait time, which was more like 2 hours. There was a party that made reservations and they still had to wait about an hour when they got there.) \n\n15 mins after we were seated, they took our order. Getting water was actually hard... I had to ask three times just to get water. Lucky for us, we ordered Burmese iced tea (same as Thai iced tea) to subside our thirst.\n\nThis is what we ordered and the timeline of how our food came.\n\nWaiter took our order...\n*20min wait*\n* Balata dish came out -appetizer dish (loved this dish! There was some sort of fishiness to the curry that made it much more interesting in taste.)\n*15min wait*\n* chicken and beef skewers -appetizer dish (very dry, my friend said his beef was dry and the chicken was good. I said the opposite.... at the end two out of three of us decided the beef was the better choice.)\n*15min wait*\n* Samosas (chicken) - appetizer dish (really good! but I am biased, I love samosas!)\n*10min wait* \n* fried squash sticks ( I disliked this dish because it had way too much batter... You couldn't even see or taste the squash)\n*10 min later* the host asks if we got our entrees yet and we all said no and he said he would check up on it\n*10-15mins later* \nWe got two out of three of our entrees. \nRagoon beef - dish was good\nCurry chicken - pretty good, chicken was pretty juicy and the curry was tasty \n*10mins later* our last dish finally came\nMandalay special noodle - it was good, but I was not a fan of the lime stems and it tasted a bit salty.\n\nOverall, the food here is NOT worth the wait. Maybe I will take my friend's advice and come here on a weekday, maybe then I can enjoy the meal as a whole and not wait every 15-20 mins for my dish. If you have an event to go to after dinner (on a weekend), this is NOT the right restaurant for you!!", "author": "Erica T."}

For you Asian dessert drinkers out there--its similar to drinks like Halo Halo and the Vietnamese 3 tapioca jelly mix drinks.

Despite the relatively spacious -- not to mention beautifully decorated interior -- we had to wait 15 minutes or so; the place was poppin', and with good reason. \n\nWe ordered the samusa soup and the spicy tofu with vegetables. The samusas were crispy yet tender and full of tasty veggies, and the broth was delicately spiced and plentiful. The spicy tofu left some to be desired; it had neither much sauce nor many vegetables, and it was not as spicy as we had hoped it would be. But the addition of a little hot sauce kicked it up to a much more delicious level, and the tofu itself was prepared perfectly.\n\nMy only complaint? A couple of kids running around, throwing noodles all over the place, leaving tiny shoes in the aisle, and generally being annoying. But that's not Mandalay's fault. I felt sorry when the waitstaff was cleaning up after them.\n\nAnyway, Mandalay will now always be my first choice above Burma Superstar or B-Star or whatever other satellite restaurants they have.

Be careful though, because the rainbow salad has sliced jalepeno. \n\nFor dinner we share multiple entrees. The mandalay special noodles were a big hit. The curry beef and lamb dish we ordered were great, but my favorite was the pumpkin curry with prawns. We had a couple others that I can't remember.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean and parking was pretty easy. \n\nCorkage fee was $8/bottle (we brought 4) and the overall tab for a TON of food including 4 desserts was $29/person with a 20%+ tip. SUPER reasonable and excellent quality food. I will go back many many times!!", "author": "Kandace K."}

My experience at Mandalay was very nice.  I made a reservation for 6:00pm on a Wednesday, and they happily accomodated me.  I was actually quite surprised at how many tables were filled during this time and already eating by the time of our arrival at 6.  \n\nOnce arriving , the very friendly staff greeted and assisted us with our birthday cake and balloon that we had.  They were very attentive and made sure everything was going well...water and tea was constantly being refilled, and cleared our tables as we finished eat dish. This was definitely great because we ordered quite a bit, and it can definitely get quite cluttered.  So I was very pleased with the service here at Mandalay.  \n\nFood was also quite good.  We started off our meal with the Samosa and the Fish salad.  Salad was a bit spicy and refreshing at the same time.  Samosa had great flavor and the sauce on the side added to it.  \n\nFor entree's we had:\n\n* Burmese Curry Beef with their flat bread - Flavor of curry was great, nice and spicy, but the beef seemed to be a bit tough to chew as the chucks of beef were cut in large cubes.  The flat bread was great for dipping the curry; reminds me of Green Onion Pancakes with out the green onion of course.  \n* Mango Chicken - Yummy, wasn't overly pan fried, batter was just right.  I wish they put a bit more mango flavor and more mangos though.\n* Spicy Tofu w/ Veggies - Yummy, but had the exact flavor of General Tso's chicken it seemed.  \n* Mandalay Special Noodle - Way too sour for my taste for noodles.  It seemed to almost be a better dish cold.  I don't prefer a sour hot noodle dish.  \n\nWe ordered the Safron rice and Coconut rice to compliment our meal.  Safron rice was way \"Chinese Fried Rice\" to me without soy sauce flavor.  Coconut rice smelled delish when he came out, but the flavor was nothing special.  Definitely smelled better than tasted.  \n\nAfter our meal, it was cake time, and to our surprise Mandalay plays throughout the whole restaurant \"Happy Birthday\" in Burmese and in English.  It was sooo cute!  My aunt was extremely embarassed.  So if you want to embarass someone fo their birthday, definitely bring them here so that the whole dining room can sing happy birthday.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience here at Mandalay very much.  Food was pretty flavorful, and service was very accomodating.", "author": "Cass J."}

Quickly I remembered the cab driver's advice and we went in.\n\nInside, there were many parties waiting for a table, a half hour wait at least. As we sat down, munching on our sourdough breads to appease our grumbling tummys, I noticed a woman eyeing the bread.\n\n\"Would you like some?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes!\" she replied. Apparently she had been waiting for sometime too.\n\nAfter grabbing enough to temporarily withstand her hunger, the waiter showed her party to their table. Since a few of her friends couldn't make it, she insisted that my friend and I join her group for dinner.\n\nSo we did.

(Unlike the closet sized Burma Superstar where you feel like it's a race to finish your food because there's always a line of people waiting outside.) Mandalay has amazing food. I don't know what there's not to love about it. Plus it's super vegetarian friendly. I love meat but I don't believe in eating meat every single day for every meal. It's nice to have something delicious without having meat be the best part of the dish. Also the environment is really interesting to be in. There's so many little eclectic decorations everywhere.

And sometimes, all I want is just to walk in, chow, and walk out (after paying, of course). \n\nAs far as the dishes are concerned, they are pretty good.  Not the lip-smacking earth-shattering zomg-i-want-more kind that I had at Mingalaba, but they were tasty nonetheless.  Presentation-wise, it's definitely better, cleaner and way more organized than hole-in-the-wall Yamo with lower risk of falling victim to some random drive-by shooting whilst tucking into your tea leaf salad.\n\nThe menu is pretty standard - for those of you who haven't had Burmese food before, it's a combination of Chinese and Indian, similar (but not quite the same as) Thai, best eaten family-style.\n\nWe had the tea leaf salad (a must - especially when the server with the lilting accent brought it out and started explaining each one of the ingredients!), rainbow salad with 3 different kinds of rice and egg noodles, ong no kaw soi (coconut chicken noodle soup) and samusa soup (for the vegetarian in our group), and of course the coconut rice, pumpkin curry (pork), stir-fried string beans (not unlike those found in a Chinese restaurant), and the Mandalay eggplant. \n\nOn Mandalay eggplant, we decided to order it since it bears the name of the restaurant (so the assumption is that it's a house special).

Mandalay was so appealing. The bright yellow entry and neon open sign didn't prepare me for the light-up imitation cactus or all the beautiful baubles that waited for us inside. We got there at 5 and grabbed a table easily, but just half an hour later it was packed. I ordered the balada, mango salad, and chicken curry with potatoes. It was very difficult not to eat all the balada- which the menu calls a \"crispy pancake\" and is the most delectable fried thing imaginable- and order more. The mango salad had onion and nuts and something else (what is the crunchy part? ) and was overall very light and fresh. The waitstaff was friendly and kind. The woman next to us said she goes to Mandalay every week, I think, and was equally sweet.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-03-10", "description": "Mandalay has single-handedly gotten me hooked on Burmese food. Combining the best flavors of both East Asian and South Asian Cuisine, it has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in the city. As a Burmese restaurant, it outshines Burma Superstar (its more popular, more highly-regarded sister restaurant) and Yellow Pa Taut (its lesser known, less delicious South of Market rival).\n\nAs a starter, the Tea Leaf Salad is incredible. The seemingly-odd fusion of tea leaves, lentil seeds, grounded shrimps, fried garlic, green pepper, sesame seeds, peanuts & dressing works surprisingly well. The flavors blend harmoniously in your mouth while the extra zing provided by the pepper and garlic are an added bonus that will make you crave more.\n\nThe Mandalay Chicken was also a winner--spicy, not too oily and very delicious. As were the Rainbow Prawns--well-seasoned and combined with a tasty trio of mangoes, pineapples, and veggies. Our group also enjoyed the Mandalay Special Noodle--a great noodle dish that was packed with flavor and complimented our meal well.\n\nThe standout dish, however, was the Burmese Curry Beef. The best curry I've ever tasted, hands down. Not only was the beef super tender, juicy and delicious, its taste was the perfect mix of sweetness and saltiness. It also came with a yummy side of potatoes. Overall, the Curry Beef is a must-order and tastes great with the coconut rice.\n\nI will definitely remember Mandalay as the restaurant that single-handedly made me fall in love with Burmese food. In addition to the delicious cuisine (unlike anything I've ever tried before), service was great and the wait was much shorter than it is at Burma Superstar. The only downside is the fact that portions are rather small (order 1 more dish than the size of your party, trust me).\n\nI can't wait until I come back to try more!", "author": "Joseph F."}

It was around 7:30pm on a Thursday night and almost every table at Mandalay was full but we didn't have to wait longer than a minute. I loved the atmosphere. It was bright and colorful with Burmese decor and ornements hanging above our heads. The service was great too! I just couldn't believe when our bill came. It was around $50 yet we had no leftovers which meant I didn't have a lunch the next day! Sucks for me. Here was the dinner:\n \nSpecial Ginger Lemonade - I HATE ginger and I dislike lemonade. So why did I try this? Yelp of course! And I don't want to box myself in! This drink is very sweet and refreshing. It almost has a carbonated taste and just a slight pucker of lemon. I couldn't taste ginger at all. YAY! \n\nRainbow Salad - I really wanted the Tea Leaf Salad but again, I ventured out to try something new. The difference between Rainbow and Tea Leaf Salad is that Rainbow is mainly noodle based. It has three different kinds of noodles, tomatoes, cucumber, cilantro, tofu, potatoes, fried onion and garlic, saffron rice, cabbage and dressing. It sounds like a towering plate of food but it's actually on the small side (especially for $9). I liked it but I was still craving that nutty, crunchy, amazing Tea Leaf Salad! \n\nBlack Pepper Soup - This soup was prepared with vegetables, squash, vermicelli, and rock cod filet. I know this is probably a big duh but the soup was VERY peppery. I thought the combination of everything went well together except for the overwhelming pepper taste/sensation. But that's just my preference. \n\nBurmese Style Noodle - Made with egg noodles touted with fried onion, fried garlic chips, cucumber slices, grounded split beans and dressing. We totally didn't notice that this dish had a \"chili pepper\" next to it (indicating spicy). Boo! I really liked the egg noodles though. It had great flavor and it really stood out from so many other egg noodles I've encountered. This is another noodle dish on the small side. \n\n*Burmese Style Curry Catfish Steak* - This entree made my dinner and MY NIGHT! It has some of the tastiest catfish I've ever put in my mouth. The meat was so savory sweet, tender, and HUGE. Unlike the noodle dishes, they gave us generous portions of catfish in a delicious chunky curry. \n\nCoconut Rice - This was a great compliment to the curry. The rice was perfectly infused with creamy undertones of coconut. Yummmm!\n\nSui Yin Aid - This is a chilled dessert soup made with coconut milk, tapioca, and agar. The red tinted glass that it came in made us think we ordered jello! The HORROR!  I really enjoy the agar it came with and to me, it tasted like a cross between lychee and jelly. The coconut milk was sweet and not thick at all. The tapiocas are the small clear kind which worked well with this dessert. Didn't love it but I'm glad I tried it. \n\nDue to the smaller portions we left satisfying full, not STUFFED-I-can't-walk full like you expect at most Asian restaurants.

We drive over to California Street and find a parking spot right in that block.  We walk into the restaurant, which looks just as I remember it, full of light, carved wood dividers giving tables a little privacy.  We were greeted by Marian, who is beautiful and gracious.  It's such a pleasure to meet in person someone you've known and admired only online.  We looked at the menu of lunch specials.  Rinky and Marian had an idea of what they each wanted and we were so busy talking that I really didn't give myself enough time to develop an idea of what I wanted and quickly chose the first thing that called me, the mango chicken.  I love fresh mango.  The waitress suggested the combination plate w/ samosas and I agreed.  In retrospect I realize that my research was inadequate.  I should have read more reviews just before to get an idea of what others liked.  My ancient memory was simply insufficient.  We decided to split the renowned green tea salad and that was an interesting contrast of tastes and textures.  I liked it, a lot.  My dishes were not appealing.  The chicken was a bit overdone and there was nothing special about it.  The samosas were curried potato and chicken.  Again, nothing special.  The tastes I had of Rinky's broccoli, walnuts and tofu sang in my mouth.  Excellent.  Marian's fish looked gorgeous and she liked it.  I didn't taste it because I had so much food.  Fortunately Rinky helped me w/ the chicken and the samosas.  Had I chosen better the food would have been as stellar as the company.  As it is, it's 3 stars for my meal but the extra star is for Rinky's and for my past visit.  Not to mention probable future ones!", "author": "Toni M."}

I like to eat this last because it leaves you with a pleasant, light, citrusy flavor in your mouth. \n\nYellow Curry - Very good, comes with chicken and potatoes. Not spicy at all, but still holds a lot of flavor. \n\nMango Prawns - Absolutely to die for! The prawns were sooo tasty. I think I'll be ordering one for myself next time I come here. \n\nThey also have some fun nonalcoholic drinks which is nice when the mom is town.

Double portions of prawns is like - 9 or so prawns.  Basically, this is not the place where you pig out, unless you order more.

So much deliciousness!  I was regretting the appetizers because I didn't have enough room to keep eating the Mandalay beef.  I don't know how they get it that way, but it was so crunchy, never soggy, never greasy, topped off with a delicious savory sauce.  It paired wonderfully with the coconut rice.  And the balada?  Yes!  You want this.  I have a love of all savory pancakes and this is certainly no exception.  Crispy on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside.

In addition to the ginger salad, we  ordered the Balada(like a Roti),basil shrimp and Rangoon Lamb(I love that they serve lamb on the menu). All were amazingly flavorful and the three of us left very happy campers. \n\nBut then the MSG kicked in.\n\n I'm making an assumption that they use MSG as I didn't ask, but judging from the way we all felt afterwards, I'm 99% certain that they use it quite generously. I'm particularly sensitive to MSG and passed out for an unintended hour long nap shortly thereafter. I should have asked, but now I know better. Believe it or not, most Asian restaurants still use MSG--just ask and you'll be amazed. \n\nBut it was so delicious that I won't even think twice about not going back.

It was a saturday and the place was packed, but luckily we had a table reserved. \n\nFood: \nTo be fair now, I must say their portions were small for the mango chicken (too little chicken), mango salad, whereas the basil beef and mongolian beef pretty much did not impress me compared to the saut\u00e9ed beef I could get from a to-go Chinese food place, and was not anything special that I can say was \"soooo good\".  I've been eating at a lot of different Asian food establishments that have much more exquisitely tasting food, larger portions and more reasonable prices, if you ask me.  Oh, and might I mention that this place also leaves you drinking a lot of water due to the salt content of their food. But the one thing I did like was the Mandalay Noodles, maybe because this one was not so oily as everything else and didn't contain mango that did not taste much like mango.\n\nService:\nI will have to agree with those who said first 10 minutes was good, but then where did the waiting staff all go? It was hard waiving someone down to get a box, or a fork (yes, they forgot a fork for me!). Yes I also do understand that you're busy, but when the drinks you ask for comes 20 mins after your food gets there, it kind of defeats the purpose of ordering them first. With the exception of asking multiple times if we wanted more water towards the end of our meal, I think the staff might have come around once to ask if everything was okay. But I guess they were nice.\n\nAll in all, I'd say there's better places that doesn't take me an hour commute to get across the bay and into the city to just dine there.

I have been back a few times and it is consistently good.\n\nI love their vegetable samusas which is like the Indian samosa but with an eggroll crisp wrapper crust which is lighter,crisper and better than the Indian's pastry-like thicker crust. Their satay chicken was also a good appetizer and Balada was similar to the East Indian/Pakistani prota(roti) which was good(a bit oily though). \n\nI wasn't crazy about the tea leaf salad-it is an acquired taste-although my mom and sister love it. It wasn't visually appealing to me at all and gritty tea leaves did not appeal to me either. I like to drink tea not eat it. The Mandalay chicken salad and green papaya salad was good.\n\nI like the coconut rice(light) esp with the Rangoon beef or Burmese curry beef. The Mandalay Beef which is fried is on the sweet side-this one I think is better to order than the Mandalay chicken. I also liked the Basil chicken dish and I had them add eggplant with the bell peppers which really made it better as the eggplant melted in your mouth(I love basil dishes).\n\nThe Mandalay special noodle was light and a nice mixture. The Singapore style noodle was rice like bean thread/cellophane kind of noodles with curry-this was okay(almost like a pancit). Their chow mein is comparable to  other Chinese restaurant's chow mein.\n\nSince I go to many Chinese restaurants,I choose to order Burmese style here and skip the more traditional Chinese fare usually. The ginger lemonade is refreshing and the kids love their coconut type of drink with tapioca pearls. The sweet potato cakes were light and airy,and were okay-not one I would order(they gave it to us). But I do want to try their fried banana next time-that sounds good.\n\nThe service is very friendly and on top of things even though they are busy whenever I go there. At lunch and dinner, even on what I would think would be slow days like on Monday or slow times like at 5pm,they were packed!

After much arguing over not much of anything, we settled on Burmese food and headed over to burma superstar. But wait, this review is about Mandalay. BS had about a 1.5 hour wait, and we were not about to stand in billowing fog for that long on an empty stomach, so we walked the three blocks over to Mandalay, which  will happily inform you that they were the first Burmese restaurant in the city. We were seated within 10 minutes and were please with the number of vegetarian options and delicious drinks.\n\nI ordered the coconut tapioca drink to start with, which in retrospect, may not have been the greatest idea. If was definitely delicious, beyond delicious even... but should have come with a warning label **dessert. \n\nWe'd heard their tea leaf salad was divine, but ended up getting the veggie version of the ginger salad, which was great if you like ginger, and I mean really like ginger. I ate 75% of mine before succumbing. Along with the salad we also had the onion pancake appetizer with it;s magic and delicious sauce. There is nothing better than a god onion pancake with delicious sauce. \n\nFor main course the four of us ordered three dishes, the tofu with broccoli and walnuts, Mandalay noodle w/ tofu, and some spicy tofu. It was the perfect amount for the four of us, my favorite was definitely the tofu with broccoli and walnuts, my leave favorite was probably the noodle, but only because I was already full when it arrived, and it again had more ginger in it than I'm accustomed to ingesting. all in all though, it was a very successful meal, I would definitely come back again.\n\nThe only thing I would like to see change about this place is their Happy Birthday ritual.

We told him we love hole-in-the-wall places, and he surprised us with a trip to Mandalay on California Street. The BF and I had never tried Burmese, nor would we have thought of going to such a restaurant of some sort. Needless to say, we were blown away by the food. \n\nFrom the outside, Mandalay looks like one of those dirty restaurants where the grout looks like some kind of moldy black. Not this one. Upon walking in, it is brightly lit inside from the big front window that welcomes passersby. As you make a quick left, you suddenly realize just how popular this restaurant really is...the floor was packed. Every table was full. It looked as if one table was having dinner with the table to the right and left of them.  The authentic decor of the restaurant was such an inviting feeling and gave me an excited feeling that I could not wait to try the food. \n\nUpon sitting down, you are quickly greeted by your server, or at least one of them. Ordering water and after looking through the menu, we ordered the Tea Leaf Salad, the Coconut Chicken Soup, the Mango Chicken, and the Mandalay Special Noodle along with brown rice and saffron rice. \n\nThe Tea Leaf Salad looks..interesting. As one of your servers lays the plate on the table, you look at it wondering \"How do I eat this?\" The server politely names each of the ingredients, asks if you'd like the lemon squeezed onto the salad, and tosses all the ingredients together. The salad, consisting of ingredients such as peanuts, roasted garlic, green tea leaves, and chickpea among others, is amazingly delicious. You could taste every ingredient in every bite you take, and the spritz of lemon was perfect with the salad. \n\nThe Coconut Chicken Soup was even better than the salad. Who would have thought that lemon spritzed in a coconut soup with cilantro would be out-of-this-world delicious. I wish I could thoroughly explain the deliciousness of this dish, but you just have to try it yourself. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give the soup a 20. Oh, how it was unforgettable. \n\nOnto the Mango Chicken and the Mandalay Special Noodle dishes. Both dishes were delicious, but not quite up to par with either the soup or salad. The Mango Chicken is exactly what it is..mango and chicken stir-fried together with a sweet sauce with a little bit of tang. The Mandalay Special Noodle was a nice dish. Having the same taste as the Coconut Soup mixed in with the chow-fun like noodles, which I absolutely love, it was a nice noodle dish. \n\nAll in all, our visit to Mandalay will never be forgotten.

The lemonade was so good, nice and refreshing. the iced teas were just like Thai iced teas (which I also love). \n\nThis being my first time eating Burmese food I was a little overwhelmed by the menu but we ordered chicken samosas to share as well as some pot stickers since we were all starving. The samosas were tasty- especially the dipping sauce that came with them! The pot stickers were mediocre but they were made with the thicker dough that I'm not crazy about which is why. \n\nWe then all ordered and I had the pineapple and mango chicken with veggies (not sure what the exact name was) but oh my gosh it was SO good! I wish there had been more pineapple actually because surprisingly it was so good with chicken, something I hadn't expected.  I also had a side of coconut rice (which I really need to figure out how to make because I'm totally obsessed with it!) and I was going to share a hot and sour soup with my friend but when it came out it was much smaller than we expected so I just had a few bites.

The beef was good, not amazing. It could have used a bit more flavor. I enjoyed it more with some of the hot sauce on it, it became a lot tastier. On the other hand, the crispy pancake was AMAZING. It complemented everything so well. If you dine here you gotta ask for it, you're going to love it.\n\nThe mango chicken was very tasty, had a nice crispiness to it, and it had just the right hint of spice in the form of some small green peppers amid all the chicken and mangoes, which created a nice sweet and spicy combination. As for the saffron rice, I personally disliked it. My friend said he was okay with it. I just didnt find much flavor to it, it had a very dull, pepper-like quality to it, lacking something to brighten it  up. I did just mix it with the wonderful hot sauce and then it was good :)\n\nWe mostly put the chicken or the beef on top of the crispy pancake and added hot sauce and rice or potatoes on top of it and ate the food like that. It was all very delicious, and very filing.\n\nAlso, the prices were pretty decent. We bot came out full at about 25 each. Not too bad.", "author": "Ricardo A."}

I had my first foray into Burmese food about three months ago at Burma Superstar, just a few blocks away from Mandalay. It was great, but when a friend found out that I liked it, she insisted that I had to try Mandalay because it was better food without the hours of waiting that you get at Burma Superstar. She was so right...\n\nAlthough just a block off Clement Street, the restaurant is located in a pretty quiet area and I think you have to know about this place to go there or be very fortunate to stumble upon it, which might explain why Burma Superstar gets more attention (location, location, location). We arrived around 8:45 PM on a Tuesday and the place was about a third of the way full; the servers were genuinely friendly and attentive during our entire meal. When our server found out it was our first time there, he dove into a spiel about how this is the first Burmese restaurant in S.F., established in 1984. He continued on, in the same breath, about all the different drink options they have and explained the menu. It was comical and reminded me of a Mexican place I went to in LA where the waiters recite the menu to you and say the exact same script over and over every time. \n\nMy friend and I split the Burmese fried pancake with curry sauce to start with, which was like fried naan and extremely delicious, albeit a bit oily (but I'm not a fried food fan so take that comment with a grain of salt). The Mandalay Special Noodle dish I got was even better; they mix the egg noodles in front of you with chicken coconut curry, fresh squeezed lemon, cilantro, fried onions, etc. which adds a nice touch to the meal. \n\nToo full for dessert, we got the check and escaped with a very tiny bill: $24 (not including tip) for an appetizer and two entrees. On our way out the door, my friend turned to me and asked if I liked Mandalay or Burma Superstar better. Food wise, I couldn't really say, because I loved both and had enough time between to not be able to compare. My friend said that although she preferred the spices of Burma Superstar better, Mandalay's food was less oily and she preferred the lack of a wait at Mandalay. I agree and to further that, want to put out there - why wait hours for Burma Superstar or B-Star when you could go here?", "author": "Kara A."}

You don't have to wait hours and brave long lines to get good Burmese food in EssEff. Mandalay is better than Burma Superstar. \n\nWhile their styles are a little different, you'll have a much better dining experience at Mandalay. More parking. Rarely the lines you see at Burma. Bigger dining room = more tables = less crowded = better service = you don't feel like you're rushed because there are 372 other people waiting to get in = a better dining experience.

His tool is so refined, it functions perfectly even when altered by excessive alcohol consumption. Some of my favorite choices include Tea leaf salad, samusas (yes, samUsas), Pumpkin curry with chicken (served IN a hollowed pumpkin), and chicken satay. Other things my associates appear to enjoy include crispy whole chicken, string beans with tofu, and the Special Noodles. Also, there is a prawn dish crusted with coconut and walnuts that looks so good I'm almost willing to endure anaphlactic shock to taste one bite of that allergic-reaction inducing goodness.\n\nThere can be a long wait on weekend nights, not sure about weekdays.

Yes, yes, I know what you're all thinking, What kind of Yelper does she think she is?! A place with 4 stars based on 508 reviews, I know that I've been missing out. I've heard how fabulous the food is there but when I can't make reservations for a place and I know there's going to be a long ass wait, I just can't bring myself to going there. Sorry!\n\nSo I can't compare Mandalay to Burma Superstar, but from what I experienced, Mandalay was really really good. I got our party of 4 reservations quite easily. We were seated right away and served promptly. The servers were all very friendly and patiently pointed out all the ingredients in our dishes before mixing them up at our table. It was all very interesting and extremely delicious. I had yellow pea powder for the first time. Yes, it doesn't sound very appetizing, but it was definitely a key ingredient in making the salad and noodle dish so flavorful. \n\nWe had the balada, rainbow salad, tea leaf salad, shredded chicken with garlic, Mandalay noodles (Burmese flat noodle with mild coconut chicken), and dry fried string beans with tofu. All the dishes were delicious and the amount of food was perfect for 4 petite ladies. \n\nI really enjoyed my first Burmese dining experience, even though it wasn't at Burma Superstar. I was very pleased with everything about Mandalay, especially that we didn't have to wait for anything. Mandalay gets 4 super stars from me!", "author": "Connie C."}

Yes, it is a satisfying place to experience Burmese cuisine. But the bottom line is that the flavors and textures don't pop out to me as much as at BS. It stops just short of being great authentic, homecooked quality (more Yamo's thing) and doesn't quite make it to the sophistication of BS.\n\nThe nitty gritty (+ my little anecdote):\n\nTea Leaf Salad: judging from my experiences at Burma Superstar, Mandalay, and Yamo and trying a store-bought tea leaf salad mix I'd say this version is probably the most boring but more authentic than BS. It's probably my least favorite out of all of them. Overall, the flavors are not as bright as at BS. The tea leaves are not as pungent, you should definitely ask for some lemon, and it doesn't come with lettuce. Not to say that the salad is bad, but...BS wins on this one.\n\nMany of the other dishes similarly lack the explosion of flavors that I have come to love at BS...Curry chicken, Catfish chowder, Mandalay Special Noodles...good, but lack that X factor. \n\nWhat makes Mandalay's menu standout is what is most arguably their most authentic dish, the Burmese style sour vegetables. This exchange with the waiter solidified their authenticity:\n\nSteph: We'll have the Burmese style sour vegetables. Are they really authentic? What does it taste like? \n\nWaiter: Uh...[has look of concern on his face and points to menu] how about the walnut prawns?\n\nSteph: No, we want to try the Burmese style sour vegetables.\n\nWaiter: People like the mango chicken.\n\nSteph: Why does it seem like you don't want us to order the sour vegetables?\n\nWaiter: Because some people don't like the fermented taste.\n\nSteph: [in a defiant voice]] We DEFINITELY want the Burmese sour vegetables!\n\nDon't EVER tell me that I wouldn't like the taste of something because I swear I will stop at nothing to prove you wrong.

Burma Superstar is small and intimate dining in a beautifully appointed room. Its careful presentation and moderate portions appeal to foodies. It's good for a date or impressing out-of-town folks. It's popular with good-looking young people who dress fashionably.\n\nMandalay is more casual and can better accomodate large groups. Food is great, but doesn't match the elegant touches of Burma Superstar. However, Mandalay has quicker and better service, bigger portions for sharing, bigger menu selection, room to move, and they deliver. It's good for a night out with friends. It's popular with neighborhood folks and families who are dressed down.\n\nMy personal preference is for a comfortable neighborhood joint. Burma Superstar may have better food, but Mandalay is the better restaurant.", "author": "Stacy J."}

This is a fried, flaky, doughy flat bread that is served with a sauce that resembles peanut sauce, but it is almost like a curry (but not). It is hard to describe but it is fantastic.  \n\nI could make a meal of the bread alone. But beware that it is really filling.\n\nWe like the String beans, the Mango chicken and coconut rice.  The string beans are perfectly cooked: still firm and served crusted with spices and salt.  The mango chicken we had last night was exceptional (probably because mangos are in season now), the mango of course being sweet and tender and the chicken nicely browned and all of it slightly spicy. I like to pour a bit of the chili oil on everything to kick the heat up as well.\n\nTop it all off with a Tsingtao and you will be in full belly heaven.  All for $21 bucks or so, including tip.  \n\nOnce you start with this food it is difficult to stop, but typically we have leftovers for a least one person.", "author": "Alice S."}

Maybe not the rainbow salad, which was decent, but was the only decent dish in a sea of excellent ones. Oh, and the samosas were just slightly oilier than I would have liked but only slightly.

We didn't have a reservation so we had to wait a little. They ended up pushing 2 tables together that would have comfortably sat 6-7 people for the 9 of us (we were squished!)\n\nFood:\n1. Tea Leaf Salad ($9) - it comes out with all of the ingredients separated, then the server explained what everything was before mixing it together. It was interesting and pretty good (quick note: it has jalape\u00f1os in it)\n2. Mango Salad ($8.50) - everyone's favorite salad out of the 2 we tried. Def try it!\n3. Ong No Kaw Soi (Coconut Chicken Noodle Soup) ($8.50) - the noodle itself is similar to pho noodle, the coconut soup was refreshing and light. \n4. Moo Hin Nga (Fish Chowder) ($9) - this was only so-so. It uses the vermicelli noodle. I would get the coconut soup over this. \n5. Balada ($5.95) - a pancake-like appetizer with a curry dipping sauce (kinda like Thai food's peanut sauce). Pretty good, we all really liked it (the pancakes are similar to the Chinese's pancakes with green onion and no sauce)\n6. Mandalay Chicken ($9.50) - this is basically like orange chicken. It's pretty good but I would skip it and try something else. \n7. Mandalay Special Noodle ($9) - this has a thicket wider noodle mixed with coconut chicken. It was several of ours favorite dish of the night, a must try!\n8. Coconut Rice ($2) - if you get a choice, I would choose this over the steamed rice.  It's a dry rice (not wet like some other restaurant's coconut rices). \n\nService:\nWe had multiple servers throughout the night. They were all friendly, explained each dish as they were brought out and tried to recommend menu items (although the guy ended up just reading off the menu, which was not helpful).

Their tea leaf salad is BETTER than Burma's. I know, I know... It seems sacrilegious to say it. I'm as big of a Burma fan as anyone. But I'm not kidding -- it's better. There's no lettuce in it. The waitress at Mandalay explained that a traditional tea leaf salad doesn't have lettuce in it (like it does at Burma SuperStar). At Mandalay, they make theirs the old school way -- lots more of all the other crunchy goodies, plus way more fermented tea leaves. Oh boy oh boy...\n\nOtherwise, I'd say the food was totally on par with Burma. But the real tipping point is that now that you're in the know, you can WALK RIGHT IN to Mandalay and have as delicious a Burmese meal as you would have had at the SuperStar's house (plus a better tea leaf salad!), while all those other clowns wait in line in the fog and wet for 2.5 hours.\n\nSuckas!!!", "author": "Lisa T."}

We're late eaters, so that almost qualifies as a late lunch for us.

Broad soft noodles mixed with thin crunchy noodles, chicken, lots of lemongrass and ginger and cilantro - and a coconut broth.  I could not stop eating these noodles.  Not heavy at all, but totally satisfying.  Can also get with tofu.

The location is in the Inner Richmond District off California St. The parking is OK depending what time of the day it is so always give yourself extra time. The people working here are so friendly and the customers too. The decor is fun! traditional Burmese Art meets sprinklings of Christmas left up. ... love it! There is usually only one waiter/waitress working and one person hosting/working the register so there can be a bit of a wait to order your food after you are seated. It definitely helps to know what you want BEFORE you are seated that way you can tell your server what you want and they can get it to the kitchen earlier for you. Once you place your order the food comes pretty fast. This is only if it is busy though, otherwise they provide very attentive service and the food is always fantastic no matter how busy it gets. Will always keep coming back!", "author": "Ashley T."}

And in that time, there have been significant changes.\n\nBurma Super Star's fame has really been a double edged sword for Mandalay. On one hand, BSS's enormous popularity and proximity has made Mandalay a huge financial success. On the other hand, they haven't handled that success very well at all.\n\nThe quality of most dishes has gone down. Serving sizes, always on the slim side, have gotten even smaller. Prices, of course, have risen. And now there are even lines.\n\nWhere's the bang for the buck? Not here. If someone else knows a good Burmese spot in the city -- please don't review it! Let us discover it on our own -- for all our sakes.\n\nFunny, but true -- my friend whom I introduced to Yelp uses Yelp all the time, but she refuses to make an account and write reviews. Why? She doesn't want people going to her secret spots, making them popular. Why give out her hair stylist if it makes it impossible for her to get an appointment, right? Popularity has made, and ruined, good small neighborhood spots like Mandalay.\n\nDearest Mandalay, everyone I've introduced to your moo hing nga adores it still. But when we're paying shy of $200 for dinner for my family and they're still hungry, I have to leave, scratching my head and wondering if I should ever come back. For around half the price, I can go a few blocks away to China First, get mountains of fresh crab, lobster, fish, prawns, shellfish, and leave with leftovers.\n\nMy next visit? Maybe it'll just be me and some moo hing nga...", "author": "Perci N."}

The server brings the plate of tea leaves, lentils, sesame seeds, peanuts, roasted garlic and chile peppers and after explaining what is what, mixes it all together for you at the table. The flavors are intense and I don't think I could have eaten the whole salad myself. But do share it with someone!\n\nI came by in the afternoon after the lunch rush and was promptly seated. My water glass was refilled twice without asking and I can't say how much that warmed the cockles of my cold, cold heart. Oftentimes at restaurants the server simply disappears after the food is served. Not the case here at Mandalay! \n\nSo if you're interested in Burmese food (and don't want to wait for two hours somewhere else...), give Mandalay a try!

I mean Burmese cuisine is like fresh and lighter Thai food (to me). So the dishes sound and look like what I know but when I taste it it's new and oh so good. \n\nMy favorite thing is the Mandalay Special Noodle dish (#3). I love how they mix it all up at your table and tell what all the little ingredients are.\nI have also had the pot stickers, satay, Burmese iced tea, some chicken dish, some other noodle dish - all good. One time I tried a dessert, it was in stick form, bright orange, gummy and grainy - it was super strange but oddly addictive. \n\nAlso, most of the restaurants in this stretch on Cali are not open for lunch but Mandalay is - always a hit. I saw someone order this quesadilla looking thing that I can't wait to try next time.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that service is very slow here no matter how busy they are - come on Mandalay come back and check on me every once in a while!  \n\nFYI- Take Out is VERY fast!!", "author": "Jessica L."}

Glitteratti and other hipsters -go to the light.\n\nFor those that are kind and wonderful, who love authentic Burmese food, okay.  You can stay.\n\nI've enjoyed every single dish I have ever ordered here.  They sized me up in one go, and then told me \"I'll bring you a plate of spicy chili paste\"  -HAHAHHAHA.  After my own heart.  And it was the amazing and complicated kind.  It was NOT Sriracha dressed up.  It was some serious paste that someone labored over.  Even more complicated in the  making, than Vietnamese fish sauce.\n\nThe La Phat Dok here ROXXX!  I love their proportions and that they don't get stingy with ingredients...unlike other Burmese places I've gone to.\n\nKhao Shwe Tok?  Yes!\n\nEven their green beans are great!\n\nHere are the downsides:\n\nMy friend and I first got seated near the door.  It was a cold winter and whenever other people came in, I felt a great gust of wind on my back.  Bad.  I had to ask to be re-seated elsewhere in the restaurant.  But this just speaks to their good customer service.\n\nParking.  Uh, what parking?  Sadly, I don't live anywhere near this gem of a restaurant...so I must go get a car in order to get here.\n\nMom and Pop decor.  eh.  It can go either way.  It usually tells me they focus more on the food, so I suppose that's a good thing.  Oddly, good food for me usually doesn't have good ambiance.\n\nMy friend could not eat most of the food I ordered.  He had to have a lot of water with his food.  Well, for me, that wasn't really bad.  Maybe that was a plus...because that keeps folks with that kind of stomach away.  \n\nYou know...the kind that doesn't really like AUTHENTIC FOOD that's made the proper way that isn't watered down to fit into someone else's palate...the spicy, pungent, real kind of food that makes a scenester's eye's water -only to reveal they don't know what they are doing and don't have the experience to back it up either.

Six words, yo:  Sizzling Rice Soup & Tea Smoked Duck....ummmm, ummmm, ummmm.\n\nI went into Mandalay a little furtively...fellow yelper James Tiberius S. has been scrutinizing my every restaurant move, chastising me for being frivolous and eating out so much.  He thinks I should invest my monies and plan for the future.  Snort.  Little does he know, I already gots that sh*t handled.  The plan is to marry rich...\n\nDude, I hate to be a hater but Burma Superstar sucks hard.  I have stood in line a couple of times to give it a chance but besides the sangria and the beer cooler, I was not impressed with a single item and I tried about ten things on the menu.  In fact, it sucks so hard that I thought I didn't like Burmese food.\n\nBut then my sick friend dragged me to Mandalay and I went kicking and screaming because if I was going to violate my financially savvy boy's sound advice, I at least wanted to eat something I liked.\n\nHello, new money pit!  Sick friend wanted soup, and most of the soups have shrimp which I'm allergic to, so we asked for the sizzling rice soup without shrimp.  The waiter was super nice and said it could be done.  The soup came out in a little tureen wafting a cloud of steam floating over a well seasoned, chunky brothy soup.  It had firm little chunks of chicken, tender scallops (scallops!), peas, and other vegetables swimming all around.  The menu said (I think) that it also contains fish but I didn't spot any and frankly think it would be overkill.  But check this out...the sizzling rice are these patties of puffed rice (rice crispy look alike thingies) that get tossed into the piping hot soup, sizzle, and dissolve!  The rice absorbs all the lovely flavor of the soup and fills you up.  Wonderful soup to get over a nasty cold or flu.\n\nThe second item we ordered was a fluke.  I just wanted to be ornery and order something that sounded wierd.  So I ordered a half order of the tea smoked duck.  You guys, everyone at some point in their life, needs to stop by Mandalay and try the tea smoked duck.  Perfectly crispy skin, with deep tea notes throughout the meat and skin.  The duck itself was moist and thick and I felt my arteries thicken with the duck fat that I allowed myself to leave on my morsels. \n\nSheesh, now I can't stop thinking about it.  Oh, btw, it comes with these little buns that are kinda like the dim sum barbeque pork buns but smaller and without any filling.  It also comes with plum sauce and strips of green onions so you can make little sandwiches.  But its so rich that it seems like a waste to mask the greasy ducky goodness with the bun, although the green onion and plum sauce (mixed with a little chile sauce for me!) provides a nice contrast.  Its the Burmese equivalent of homestyle southern fried chicken, y'all...oooooh, go when you're hungover!!!!\n\nThe reason they get five stars is because although it was late (we got there at 9:48 on a week night) and there was a big party at the same time, our waitress was so attentive, noticing when our greedy paws got too greasy from the duck and bringing extra napkins without being asked and without revealing the disgust I am sure she felt at our lack of table manners.  \n\nLong story short, this spot is three blocks away from Burma Superstar, never crowded, better food and way better service.", "author": "A S."}

I am from out of town and always try to hit up Burma S. when I am in SF and consider it one the best places to eat in the city. That said, I think Mandalay will be our new must go place for future trips. \n\nThe food is equally good to Burma S. and there was no waiting. NONE. Also, the restaurant was laid out in a way that gave each table plenty of elbow room which gives it extra points in my book. \n\nBased on the server's suggestions, we ordered mango chicken and the Mandalay Noodles. The noodles were OUT OF THIS WORLD, CRAZY GOOD. Also the rainbow salad was different but on par with the one over at Burma S. Try the ginger beer cocktail - really refreshing. \n\nWe walked in at 3:20 on a Saturday, apparently 10 minutes before they were supposed to close and stop lunch service. I expected for them to rush our meal but they were extremely friendly, patient, and knowledgeable about the menu. At the end of our meal, the manager sent us free mango rice pudding which was amazing. \n\nThey were 3 of us and we walked out extremely full for a bill of about $65 (that's drinks, appetizers and 3 mains).

I was ripped up but I could barely care..it was that good. \n\nThe meal broken down:\n\nBalada - A fried pancake of insane happiness. A sort of flakey biscuit (but not at all) comprised of crepes.

It's like the best orange chicken ever but..not quite orange. Order it.\n\nThe Rainbow chicken - Happy nuggets of chicken nestled in bell pepper, pineapple, mango, and such.

Burma Superstar was my first foray into Burmese food and I was very  underwhelmed by the whole experience...that being said, Mandalay has totally turned things around for me.  Burmese food is delicious!  \n\nI came on Saturday night at 6:30 with a group of 7.  I made reservations earlier that day and when we arrived the restaurant was pretty empty.  It filled up fast though and by the time we left there was a long line to be seated, so if you do have time to plan ahead I would recommend reservations.\n\nWe opted to eat family style and everyone chose a dish.  We had:  Burmese Curry Chicken, Mango Mandalay Chicken, Walnut Broccoli, Mandalay Special Noodles, Hot and Sour Soup and Coconut Rice.  Everything was delicious, the real stand out for me though was the Mango chicken.  The small pieces of chicken were tender and the addition of the spicy sauce and the saut\u00e9ed mango chunks were perfect.  I wasn't too sure initially about the Walnut Broccoli, but it turned out to be a good combo and my sweet tooth enjoyed the tangy yet slightly sweet sauce.  \n\nI am a big fan of curry, but the Burmese style curry didn't really do much for me, it was good, but not something I'd get again.  Also you really need to spend the extra money and get the Coconut Rice, it is AMAZING!

Usually if you go early enough to Burma Superstar, there's no line. Not so this past Labor Day.  We showed up at 5:00, and already at least 30 people were in line.  So we turned around and headed over to Mandalay. I still like the Tea Leaf Salad and the Special (Superstar) Noodles better at BS + Mandalay doesn't have Samusa Soup. But what Mandalay does have is an amazing Samusa Salad and the Tofu with Broccoli and Walnuts dish that is so good. The atmosphere is very comfortable, staff helpful and attentive, and they often bring out a free desert.

Our staple dish is the Burmese Style Noodle (Kaw Soi Dok) which--though milder than the Burma Superstar version--is freakin' fantastic.  Aside from the aforementioned must-have dishes, Samusa Salad and Tofu with Broccoli and Walnuts, we recently branched out to try:\r\n\r\nNaked Eggplant (a special not on the menu, but you can ask for it anytime)--melt-in-your-mouth chunks of peeled fried eggplant in a slightly sweet sauce with onion (and bell peppers if you want 'em)\r\n\r\nTofu Pumpkin Curry--very rich--almost as good as the Pumpkin Curry at Silver Spoon but with more vegies.\r\n\r\nBalada with curry dipping sauce--deep-fried goodness. It's especially good with the chili sauce that they bring to the table.  I dream about that chili sauce.  I'd spread it on toast in the morning if I could.\r\n\r\nIt's a good thing I don't eat meat or seafood--I'd never be able to make up my mind.

While i cannot compare the two, i will say, that Superstar MUST serve amazing food in order to feel justified into paying their prices, because the amazing flavors and reasonable prices of Mandalay make me never want to go anywhere else (and pay more) for burmese food again.  The food here is just so perfectly seasoned, each entree with its own distinct flavors and uniqueness...you cannot go wrong with almost anything you order here.  For something different, try the tea salad or the mango chicken.\n\nOh and another plus, lots of seating :-)\n\nI will say too, that while this place certainly has very good food, the service leaves something to be desired...hence their 4 stars...prob closer to 3 1/2.  Servers were in plain view and easy to see however, it was very difficult to get them to your table for most things.  Im sure its a hit or miss thing, and most nights are better then others, so i wouldn't make too much of a big deal about it.  \n\nPeople who love Burmese food and especially people who usually frequent Burma Superstar, should definitely check out this place.  I would highly recommend it to anyone!

The seating arrangement is certainly much more comfortable and you don't feel like you walked into a food sauna.  \n\nThe Rainbow Salad was especially healthy and tasty.

Nothing too special for me and it is not a dish that is special in Burma (Myanmar).  It is only \"special\" at this restaurant.  Basically it's like garlic noodles but without the garlic and with dices of chicken, which I didn't taste until the end of the dish.  A more accurate description of it is: Burmese flat noodle with mild coconut chicken, yellow pea powder, lime juice, onion and fried thin noodle on the top.  Needless to say, it does sound \"special.\"\n\nWe also had the Rangoon Beef based on the recommendation of \"Ashley M.\"  She had said that the beef was so soft that if you blew on it, it'd fall apart (almost).  We'll based on that I had to try it and low and behold the beef was nice and tender.  So I have to say that Ashley M.'s enthusiastic review was 110% accurate!

After reading the glowing reviews of Mandalay, last night we went there sure that the meal would be very good if not better.  Alas, life does throw some curves and our meal was one of them.  Four of us ordered tea leaf salad, mango salad, satay chicken-beef, Mandalay prawns, Mandalay beef and a noodle dish.  The mango salad and the noodle dish were quite good.  This is where the good news ends.\n\nThe tea leaf salad by comparison to that I've had in 2 other Burmese restaurants was lackluster with nuts being the predominant taste.  The satay chicken-beef was a few skewers each with a fairly tasteless stick of ground chicken and beef mixture accompanied by a bland dipping sauce.  We each ate one of these and left the rest. The Mandalay beef was simply bad - like over fried pieces of beef in a not appealing red sauce.  We left most of it on the serving platter.  The Mandalay prawns were 6 medium size shrimp in a tomato based sauce and that is what it tasted like.  I don't think anyone would willingly ruin decent shrimp with such an unappetizing sauce.\n\nThe opinions above were pretty much shared by all 4 of us.  I wonder what went wrong.  The restaurant was crowded and perhaps the kitchen was overloaded.  Maybe the chef had a night off.  Maybe I will return to give the restaurant another chance - maybe not..", "author": "Jed A."}

I thought that it had the best Burmese cuisine I've ever tasted.... until now. After eating at Mandalay, I wonder why everybody raves about Burma Superstar, while nobody talks about Mandalay?\n\nPROS:\n(1) Much shorter wait than Burma Superstar. Call ahead for reservations. If you don't, you should expect to wait about 45 minutes to an hour during peak hours. (Still better than Burma Superstar, though)\n\n(2) Food was fantastic. My favorite was the crispy eggplant cubes. Damn I never though eggplant could be so well-made. I also loved the mango chicken and walnut shrimp as well. Quite possibly better than BS's.\n\n(3) Service was incredible. Our waitress was this peppy young lady who seemed like she was overdosing on some happy pills. I love how they don't rush you, even though there's a crapload of people waiting (I guess this is bad for those who are waiting). I hate how at Burma Superstar they take away your plate when you still have food on it and they do it all fast & ninja-like so you're like: \"But... but... but... wait...\"\n\nThe One & Only CON:\n\nNow two main reasons why I go to Burma Superstar is because of their Ginger Beer and their Rainbow Salad. After Mandalay, those are the two sole reasons why I would stick with Burma Superstar. Mandalay's ginger beer was like 90% sugar water and 5% beer and 5% ginger. It was way too sweet and I'd be surprised if it had any beer in it. We actually had to order an extra bottle of Tsingtao just to pour into it so that we could at least feel like we're drinking alcohol instead of Kool-Aid. And yeah, the Rainbow Salad at Burma Superstar is much better than at Mandalay.\n\nAll in all, I'd definitely come back to Mandalay -- unless I want ginger beer or Rainbow Salad.

Some girls who were waiting when we were seated were still waiting when we finished our meal.)\n\n-Bigger space: you're not crammed together and eating within a foot of the next table.

The one thing Mandalay beat BS on was the fried bread (balada). Manaday's was a large layered pancake with a yummy curry sauce. I could've eaten the whole thing by myself. BS had a small piece that crumbled when you tried to tear or cut it and no sauce.

The food here in general is pretty good, the atmosphere nice and fun. The wait can be long and a bit slow.

We did end up waiting for about 30 minutes, even though we were told 5, but I can forgive that given the way it turned out.\n\nEvery dish we ordered was good-to-excellent.  I don't think you can go wrong.  The Burmese iced tea was flavorful but not too sweet.  The chicken samusa was fried just enough -- crispy and light -- and had a good flavor.  Our other appetizer was the tea leaf salad, which came out served on a plate with all of the components separate.  Our waiter enumerated them and mixed them all together in front of us.  It was strange, but delicious.  The tofu-curry rice noodles (I forget the Burmese name...) was served in a similar way, on a large platter with extra seasoning and ingredients arrayed around the edges.  Our server mixed them all together and helpfully explained what everything was.  \n\nWe also ordered curry chicken, which was consistent and well-made, some preparation of sliced beef, which was excellent, walnut tofu with broccoli (mmm... candied walnut), szchezuan-style green beans with prawn, and coconut rice.\n\nFor dessert, we had some burmese sweet-potato cake and tapioca with paluda syrup with ice cream.  The paluda (falooda) was great.  I wasn't so much a fan of the sweet-potato gel-cake thingy.\n\nSo, the food was good, the staff was helpful, and their recommendations were great.  The coolest thing about this place was the music they were playing.  Burmese covers of english soft-rock classics are the most insidiously awesome songs to play in the background.  You hear them, you recognize them, but then you realize they're in Burmese and that you've been the target of careful mind-control all night.  Our server told us they got the CD in Burma, and they didn't expect to see it in the US.  Boo.  I want to get that music.  Yes, it was that cool.

I love that the service is always great and I don't have to battle lines of people wanting to eat trendy burmese food like at Burma Superstar.\n\nThe tea salad, not spectacular, but I can see how some might love it.  It just seems like a small amount of food for the $8 entry fee, and not special enough to justify.\n\nThe Samusa salad was surpisingly good, chopped up samusa with some veggies and a sweet sauce on top.\n\nThe samusa soup was quite good, 95% as flavorful as the Burma Superstar but more hearty and I'd definitely order it again, filling and a better value than the salad for the same price.  Adding a touch of lemon to the dish makes it closer to the slightly tangying flavor of Burma Superstar.\n\nThe Balada was excellent, it was just the right blend of crispy and chewy and although the dipping sauce wasn't the best I've ever had, the spicy chili sauce they give you at the table more than made up for any deficit in flavor.  A great value at $5.  That and the soup is most of the way towards filling two people up.  \n\nWe also ordered the Mandalay chicken, which was unfortunately a letdown, especially surprising considering I love orange chicken and general tso/chao/cho/chow/etc   But while the meat was quality white meat the flavor just wasn't up to snuff, even compared to good lowly dollar Chinese food joints.\n\nThe rainbow chicken was good, lightly fried, with sweet pinapple.  Not as rich as your traditional sweet and sour sauce, very lightly done.  \n\nThe string bean dish was great, tasty and fresh.\n\nThe saffron rice was tasty, and I'd try that again.\n\nAll in all the service was great, the atmosphere was far more relaxed than at Burma Superstar where I always feel crowded and rushed.\n\nI will try to go back here for lunch specials as a way to explore the menu further without breaking the bank", "author": "Stephen H."}

The tea leaf salad is nothing like I've had before. Bff really enjoyed. I polished off the Samusas.

Little pieces of potato, fried tofu, cucumber, cilantro, onions, and garlic....not to mention all those other ingredients I can't quite make out. String beans and rice were incredible too. After all this, we managed to share the Mango ice-cream for dessert. Kinda bummed that they didn't have the Mango pudding that Jan Z. had the night before.

So we walked from 21st Ave and Clement to California and 6th Ave where we found Mandalay Restaurant. Yes, we've had burmese before (at that \"other\" burmese restaurant) but we wanted to try a new place. We are so glad we did!\n\nFirst, we were a little put off as there was a huge line of people. But that must be a good sign of a good restaurant, right? Luckily, the wait wasn't too bad (maybe 20 minutes?), and we were able to look at the menu until they called out our name.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the Fried Squash and Eggplant combo. I was really surprised at the amount of pieces we were given. It could have fed a group of 6 easily! The sauce was a beautiful mixture of sweet and spicy.\n\nFor our main entree, we ordered the Walnut Broccoli Chicken, whose sauce was perfect to pour over our steamed rice. The honey kissed walnuts definitely made the dish. \n\nBut the Mandalay Special Noodles was by far the best  of everything we ordered. When the server came to our table, she explained what each of the ingredients were before she mixed them all together right in front of us. The lemon-ey, velvet-ey coconut sauce lightly coated the flat noodles, chicken, fried onion and crunchy chow mein noodles. We couldn't stop saying, \"mmmm...uhhhhh...mmmmm...yummmm\". \n\nAnd just when we thought we couldn't eat any more, the server came back with some mango pudding. WOW. it was like a mango flavored custard/flan. So flavorful yet not too sweet.\n\nWe absolutely enjoyed our meal and will definitely come back again and again and again.", "author": "Jan Z."}

I wanted to know if it was just as good as Burma Superstar.  The restaurant itself is more spacious than Burma and so there wasn't a huge line when we walked in.  We got seated immediately.  The decor is cute, but I still think Burma is more cozy.  \n\nTo compare to the quality of Burma, we had to try their tea leaf salad, and their curry noodles (Nan Gyi Dok (Available with Tofu)\nBurmese rice noodle with spiced coconut chicken, split yellow pea, powder, and fried onion).  I wanted to compare their Mango beef or chicken, but they declined my order because mangos weren't really ripe and in season!  That totally blew.  I didn't know what else I wanted... =P  So we got their Mandalay chicken instead.\n\nTea leaf salad:  no lettuce = more tea leaves!  It was REALLLLLY GOOD.  I don't know what I prefer, lettuce or no lettuce.  I think this tea leaf salad without the lettuce is probably more authentic.  I think I prefer without the lettuce.  You get so much more flavor.\n\nCurry chicken noodles:  The only difference is that they don't give you egg in it, which isn't a big deal.  It was really tasty, but to be honest, I can't tell which one I like better either.  I guess that just means they are comparable and equivalent!\n\nMandalay Chicken: The chicken here was kind of over cooked in my opinion and a little dry.  The mango would have added great flavor to it \n\nOverall, the service is great.  The food is comparable to Burma, and I would definitely come back here again.  get the coconut rice!! it's so good!", "author": "Diane L."}

They give me their \"House special sauce\" in little containers to take home with me, to put on my rice, vegetables, waffles, cereal and I just can't resist the charm.

The first time was real early on in those courtin days, on a Sunday evening in August after Opera in the Park, and a walk back to her place where we unpacked the picnic basket and, uh, rearranged the furniture in her apartment for a few hours, working up quite an appetite. The conversation went something like this: \n\nMe: Oooh--how 'bout Burma Superstar?\nWILSEW: Oh--Burmese, yeah, that sounds great. But let's go to Mandalay instead. It's right down the street. \nMe: Oh...okay. [Pause that was one part mopey, two parts wondering if this was perhaps vestigial princessery, and 1-2 dashes of petulance about not getting my ex*act* way.] What's wrong with Burma Superstar? \nWILSEW: Oh, Burma Superstar's always crowded and there's a line, and you have to wait outside...and it's just--Mandalay's just as good, and we're not going to have to wait, and it won't be crowded, and we'll be happier and not hungry sooner. Doesn't that make a lot of sense? \nMe: Yeah, I guess so. Okay; let's go to Mandalay.\n\nAnd so began my relationship with Mandalay/this new reality of not getting my way at all times, in every way. On both counts I've been pleasantly surprised by my enjoyment. \n\nThough I'm sure you're more interested in the interpersonal relationship dynamics between WILSEW and myself, I'll limit my review (to the extent that it can still be considered limited) to just what I've eaten at Mandalay (all visits). In no particular order, the following items are enough, in themselves, to bring me back: tea leaf salad (perfect combination of tangy and spicy and salady, basically low-level internecine culinary warfare in your mouth), ginger salad (ibid.), green papaya salad (though I admit I'm wicked easy when it comes to green papaya salad); samusa (meat--WILSEW's insistence--which melted and swarmed my palate); samusa soup (almost a sweet nuttiness to it that made it impossible for me not to love, though somehow WILSEW found a way not to like it).\n\nIt also bears mentioning that the service is pretty spot-on: nice/polite, efficient, and attentive without being bothersome. A little like if your aunt had a house in the town where you went to prep school and you stopped in every once in a while for non-institutional food that was not just non-institutional, and not just really really really good, but also delivered to you with the kind of affection you can't get from the in loco parentis set-up down the road, but also not too up in your business or grill. The tea salad just gets set down in front of you, and it's so good.\n\n\n\n*Ed.

Not exactly what I expected. It came to us decontructed, the peanuts, separate from the tea leaves, from the fried garlic, tomatoes, chili, dried shrimp, sesame seeds. It is distinct in flavor contributed mainly I think to the shrimp and garlic. Admittedly fishy in flavor. Probably not my favorite but worth trying.\n\nWe substituted the Black Pepper Soup with the Coconut Chicken Soup. As my friend described it - tastes like a Thai Tom Yum soup. To which I added except for the Coconut Milk, the hard boiled egg, cilantro and others. Honestly though, the soup is great! Like a light thinned coconut curry.\n\nThen we were served the Mango Chicken and the String Beans. Both were good though nothing to shout about. We did have Coconut Rice for a little extra.

The spacious interior and gracious service are definite pluses. \n\nWe started with the very tasty Tea Leaf Salad, a must if you will be dining here. The Burmese Hot and Sour soup was ok, and the Prawns and Okra mightily outshone our second entree, the Burmese Curry Beef. It was WAY too salty for us, and would have taken this review down to 3 stars, but I did notice on the menu that you can ask to make dishes less or more spicy and/or salty when ordering. \n\nSo Mandalay deserves a return visit, probably with my mom when she comes to town, and we will ask for less salt and more spice, and try some other dishes!", "author": "Priya S."}

We made reservations but still had to wait a good 15-20 minutes or so. The hostess was going to seat us at this really small table but said it might be too small so we can wait for another table which we agreed.. A few minutes later she ended up seating us at the small table that we didn't want to sit at anyways.. We had to request to move to a different table since it barely fitted the 4 of us.. it was like a table for two. At least we were able to order our food while waiting for a bigger table.. After we moved tables our food came out. We ordered the mandalay beef, the pumpkin curry chicken, the burmese fried rice, and the mandalay special noodles. The mandaly beef was pretty good but it tasted just like something from a chinese restaurant. The pumpkin curry chicken had good flavors but the chicken was a little too dry.. the burmese fried rice was pretty good, but my favorite was the mandalay special noodles. Great flavors!

An okay trade for fame points in my book.\n\nNow, this was the first Burmese food I've had (described as as mixture of Indian and Chinese by someone in the know, which wasn't entirely accurate to our meal, but that could have been an accident of ordering), so I can't say how it stacks against other offerings, but everything we had was a delightful mix of sweet, spicy, nutty, and floral that was light on the palate in a way that Indian (which always seems to have too many middle notes) and Chinese (a decided bass) usually miss. My only complaint was that the fried garlic and onion in the Kaw Soi Dok was maybe a bit smokey (read: burnt) for the dish, but even that, I could see how somebody else might have liked. The other dishes we ordered -- pepper soup, mango chicken, and broccoli-walnut tofu -- were all amazing, with the broccoli-walnut dish as my winner for the night.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about the meal was how cheap it was. Not $5 street-food cheap, sure, but nobody at the table broke the $15 mark, which included beers for two of us. Now I'm sad I don't live in San Francisco, and have absolutely no idea where to get Burmese food in the Boston area. Franchise, plz?", "author": "Ben K."}

I know I've only been here for a little more than a year, but Mandalay is bar none the best place to eat I've found. The courteous staff, eclectic music selections, and of course, delicious food make this a best in class type of place.\n\nI'll go ahead and say it... Mandalay kicks Burma Superstar's butt! While Mandalay does get busy and you have to wait at times, they are smart enough to take care of you by giving everyone glasses of wine while they wait. Also, they care about and understand the experience of enjoying a meal. Burma Superstar makes you pre-order and rushes you out the door in order to feed the hordes of starving patrons that stare in through the windows at you, while Mandalay will keep you happy while you wait and let you take as long as you need to enjoy your meal.\n\nI have never had a dish I didn't like and delight in the thought of eating my leftovers the next day for lunch or dinner. I recommend their signature tea leaf salad as an appetizer, their ginger lemonade as a drink, coconut rice with your main, which I love so many of... but, I would suggest any Rainbow, Rangoon, or walnut and broccoli dish. To finish it off, mango and sticky rice is light and delectable. \n\nOk, enough, enough... just go try it and find out for yourself!!", "author": "Bay M."}

And as I'm watching people who came way after us get seated one by one, I'm beginning to wonder if they're ever gonna seat us...EVER. \"Ever\" never came, because when my pal went to inquire within, they said, \"oh maybe another 30 minutes.\" There's no way this shivering and completely famished girl is gonna wait another minute to place her order for some luscious noodles. The hostess is very apologetic and asks if we'd like to try their sister restaurant up the street (which I hear is NOT good), to which I said, \"Ya know...it would be a nice gesture to warn your guests if the wait will be longer, instead of waiting till I ASK you an HOUR later.\" Turns out that people can call in ahead to get their name on the list, which is sooo stupid because we asked about that earlier in the evening over the phone, and some dummy told us otherwise. \n\nSo then one of my other gal pals blurts out, \"Why don't we go to Mandalay on California and 6th? They have better food and that's where Mom (who's Burmese) likes to go all of the time.\" I'm thinking, GIRL...you tell me now??? But I didn't waste time, because by now, I'm ready to eat the bench I've been warming. \n\nTwo blocks later, we land the only table in the full house at Mandalay. This place does not disappoint. Friendly service greets us and we place orders for tasty drinks, including some tall, fruity concoction and Sangria (I know...out of place in a Burmese eatery, but still yum). \n\nSo my gal pal with the Burmese mommy orders, and OMG...it's all amazing! Here's what we got:\n\nSamusa (crispy, triangular appetizers) with chicken\n\nFried Squash (battered with a tasty dipping sauce)\n\nTea Leaf Salad that actually contains mostly tea leaves. Yuuuuppp...Burma Superstar packs their's with lettuce which isn't the way it should be served. HA! No wonder I didn't much care for it. Mandalay's version is far superior.\n\nOng No Kaw Soi (Coconut Chicken Noodle Soup) - mmmm, just like Burmese moms' make (I guess...I wouldn't know)\n\nMoo Hin Nga (Fish Chowder) - with a squeeze of lemon...wowsers. Unexpectedly tasty.\n\nBasil Beef - sauteed beef with shreds of ginger and fresh basil. It's as good as it sounds.\n\nAnd here is the dish that I could not get enough of...KAW SOI DOK. YES! You HAVE to get this. It's egg noodles with fried onion, garlic chips, cucumber slices, split beans and some lip-smackin' dressing of I don't know what, but who cares, sort of thing. \n\nI was a little pissy about the whole seating situation at Burma Superstar, but that has nothing to do with me giving this place a stellar review.

I also ordered the catfish steak with curry, which I thought was a little dry, and the Rainbow Chicken, which wasn't anything to write home about. BSS has the edge here, if only because their catfish steak was absolutely heavenly.\n\nOf course, food is only part of the equation. If you consider that we would've had to wait an hour and a half for a table at BSS compared to roughly fifteen minutes for a table here... \n\nAlso, I was pleasantly surprised by their attention to service. Case in point: the manager would frequently make the rounds at the waiting area, making sure that everyone there was taken care of and kept informed. We were also offered complimentary glasses of wine, which was a very nice touch.\n\nIf the quality of the food is your *absolute* sole consideration, BSS is your place of choice. But factor in everything else (wait time, service), and I think Mandalay is the clear winner.", "author": "Horace K."}

It's tasty, but I leave feeling very thirsty.  The food is flavorful...but not from fresh ingredients!  I think that the flavors come from salt and an overcompensation of garlic.  \n- Walnut Broccoli Tofu: this is a great dish for vegetarians.  it may sound a bit odd, but the tofu and broccoli goes well with this sweet and tangy walnut sauce.  Try it.\n- Tea Leaf Salad: you can get it w/ lettuce or without (I prefer with just so that it's not too salty, but to each their own).  The salad was good, but the tea leaves were really coarse...I don't remember it being that way at Burma Superstar.  Moreover, there were waaaay too may nuts to other ingredients ratio.  I think I counted 3 half slices of grape tomatoes and with each bite you get a mouthful of peanuts and soy nuts.  \n- Mandalay String Beans: this was pretty good, not too greasy, but the fried garlic was a bit overpowering. \n- Coconut Rice: very delicious, not too coconuty.  Try it!\n- Jasmine Flower Art Tea: for $4 I don't know if it's really worth it.  Plus, I know they're trying to be all artsy, but tea should not be served in a wine glass...I'm just saying.\n\nService: Service is great at the beginning, but there were definitely moments when I was looking to get my water refilled and couldn't find a server.  We also had to wait forever to flag someone down to take the money.  \n- Sidenote: This isn't a huge deal, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.

I later saw that 2 tables down (another (coincidentally (?) Caucasian) table received the same dessert.  Fast forward and when we get our bill we got 2 cheap, stale-tasting fortune cookies.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-01", "description": "Yumness. That's the keyword for Mandalay.  This restaurant sits a bit off the beaten- to- death path from Burma Superstar (two blocks away on Clement).  This Saturday evening, there was a clusterf&*k of takeout patrons and dine-in patrons glomming up the foyer, but the more-than-in-control hostess sorted folks out quickly and efficiently.  She was also quick with menus and drink orders, so the wait was a non-issue. Pllus the housemate and I got to ogle some very cute geek boys at a nearby table.\n\nAnyway, on to the food.  As you might expect from a country conquered by other countries over the centuries, the cuisine is a blend of conquering and conquered.  Indian, Chinese and Thai dishes are synchretized into Burmese dishes through subtle tweaking of ingredients.  For example, our starter dish,  vegetable samosas, arrived at the table shortly after being seated.  The Burmese version of this Indian dish uses a lighter dough for the pastry and is formed longer, thinner than the plump, dimple-doughed Indian ancestor.  Mandalay serves it with a side of lightly picked cucumbers/carrots and a sweet red sauce. The samosas were crisp, hot and yummy. (see my theme).  Our second dish was a diner fave, green papaya salad.  The shredded slices of papaya didn't have the lime bite of it's Thai cousin, but rather radiated a quiet, spice heat that never overpowered. It also benefited from the heavy handed use of roasted peanuts and garlic.  \n\nThe two main dishes, ginger lamb and basil chicken, paired nicely with each other. The lamb was tender and gingery (hence the name, I suspect). Same for the basil chicken. The Thai/Asian basil in the chicken dish complemented the garlicky/gingery lamb.  The restaurant serves brown rice on request, so we also got to feel even more virtuous about our pan-asian pig out.\n\nI've never tried any of the desserts listed on the menu, so if anyone else has info on that, please weigh in.\n\nAll in all, Mandalay is easier to take than Burma Superstar, and I find the food and service to be much better.  With mas cervezas and mutliple dishes, we still got out the place for less than $30 each (not counting tip).  Delish and a value, what's not to like?", "author": "philip c."}

I would assume the names that aren't crossed out and closest to the top of the list would be next in line. Is it that difficult?\n\nAnyways, after being seated for a few mins, the waitier took my order (I already pre-selected the dishes during my 30min wait). Soon after service fell off sharp. In the time it took to prepare my warm Rainbow Salad (40mins) tables that were seated after me got their entire dinner delivered. Speaking of salad, the server MOLESTED the 12 ingredients like ppl do with ice cream at Cold Stone, \"stop molesting my ice cream/ salad!\"\n\nThis place is such a yuppie magnet. Yuck!

But I didn't see any catfish. Where's the fish? They also give you the option of having rice noodles in the soup. We ordered the soup as described in the menu (with no noodles), but then when we asked if it's usually served with noodles, the waitress said that she usually has the soup with noodles. I'm now confused. If you usually serve it with noodles, why doesn't the menu say noodles in the description of the dish? If you don't say that noodles become an addition. Are you trying to make a buck out of not giving us the real stuff!!!?? Anyway, aside from that, the soup was pretty good and i really liked the fresh cilantro in the soup. \n\nWe also shared meat potstickers, the Burmese style curry with chicken, Rangoon Style Beef and coconut rice. The curry chicken was cooked with young potatoes with a coconut-based curry and really good and saucy. This isn't a spicy curry, so if you like, add some of the chili they bring to the table a the beginning of the meal. I totally recommend this curry. Rangoon Style Beef was basically tomato beef. Good, but not terrific. I don't think I would order this again. I don't like ordering Asian dishes that I can make at home.

It tastes like a twist on the Pad Thai...with very thin noodles.  \n\nAppetizers:\n*Balada   (Similar to a Roti.  Served with a very mild curry sauce)\n*Fried Squash   (Very simple taste.

I have been here before with no joy but after reading all the great Yelp reviews I decided to give it a second try hoping to have a great meal with my two friends, one visiting from out of Wisconsin where they supposedly don't even have \"Burmese\" food.  We had driven by Burma Superstar with their huge wait line so next up was Mandaly.  When we finally arrived without reservation at 8:45pm on a Saturday night, the 12 ppl in line ahead of us helped me set aside my first bad visit as just a fluke.  OK, rambling, so let's talk briefly about the food.\n\nAgain, it was quite late (~9:30pm), almost closing time, when we were seated.  We ordered light, pretty basic dishes: the \"Pot Sickers\" were good; the \"Pan Fry Prawn with String Bean (hot & spicy)\" was OK - the string beans being the better part of the dish; the \"Mandalay Chicken (hot & spicy)\" tasted more like not so Sweet and Sour Chicken; the \"Burmese Curry Beef (hot & spicy) with potato\" was rather bland curry; and \"Coccunut Rice\" which was well, white rice - hard to screw that up.  None of the dishes were hot or spicy, though I do realize I may not have asked for a more desirable degree of heat.\n\nTo summarize, none of the dishes had any pop.  Prices were competitve and the staff was very friendly but the food was so-so.  Though my friends were not as critical/disappointed, I left with the feeling that I would never crave any dish at Mandaly and probly won't go back, sparing them my dreaded third strike.", "author": "Keith S."}

I told her my friend was coming soon and I would just wait for her before we get seated. \n\n---Oh are you waiting for a woman?\n---Um, yeah....\n---Yeah, she came and then she left. \n\nWhat?  What was she trying to say?  I got stood up by my friend?  Turns out, my friend just left to get something from her car and DID come back. \n\nAnyway, we ordered everything recommended by yelpers: Mango Chicken, Tea leaf Salad, and the Special Noodles.  The Mango chicken was good but a bit too sweet for my taste.  Tea leaf salad is just as good as Burma Superstar's, I thought.  Although I have friends who swear by tea leaf salad from BS and nowhere else.   My favorite was definitely the Special Noodles.  It has a very light coconut curry taste and the chicken pieces were so tender and flavorful!  I would definitely come back just for the noodles. \n\nThe service was very efficient and friendly.  Water always refilled.  I see how the ceiling decoration looks a bit Christmas-ornaments-gone-wrong, but overall, cozy and comfortable atmosphere.  \n\nThe birthday songs that they play are a bit too much.

Subtle, maybe a little sweet, sort of buttery even. It was just good and something I have never had before.\n\nThere was no line like at, you know where, and it's decorated in.....it's just highly decorated. My whitey hubby loved the decoration, I thought, hmmm, maybe a bit much. Whatever - the food is good and we got free dessert.

This place was the first Burmese restaurant in SF, opening in 1984. \n\nWe started off with the tea leaf salad which we asked to be mixed with lettuce so it wasn't so strong and balada, a crispy paratha like bread served with curry dipping sauce.  Both were delicious and we were super hungry since we were eating at 10 pm EST.\n\nWe decided to split 4 dishes amongst the 4 of us (we also had a friend join), we got a special of prawns with pumpkin.  There were too few prawns and the pumpkin could have been cooked a little more, but the sauce was delicious.  The chicken with mango was good, with slightly crispy chicken and perfectly ripe mango.  The beef curry was delicious and you could tell it was cooked over a long period of time.  The Basil Spicy Eggplant could not compete with Burma Superstar's delicious eggplant that I remembered from 5 years ago, nor could the coconut rice which tasted too weakly of coconut.

They brought our coconut rice about 25 minutes before any of our other dishes, so by the time our food came, the rice was cold.  We got there at 5, and didn't leave until 6:30. But, in Mandalay's defense, they were extremely busy (surprisingly busy for 5 pm) and seemed unprepared and understaffed.\nNow on to the good stuff... the FOOD! Holy cow. The Mandalay noodles were to die for.  It was one of my favorite noodle dishes ever. We got the vegetarian samosa soup, which tasted as if they smashed up samosas into a curry broth, and it was perfect. We also got the curried prawns, and the homemade coconut ice cream. The food was all incredible.\nIf we hadn't waited so long for our food, I would give this place 5 stars. I can't wait to try Mandalay on a weeknight, when it's sure to be less crowded.

There were so many things on the menu to choose from it was really hard to decide.\n4.We got out food fairly quickly.\n5. It's a spacious restaurant.

It just didn't taste fresh and there weren't as many ingredients as Burma. It was good but not awesome.\n\n-Hot and Sour Soup-3.5 stars out of 5. The soup was great. Hearty, fully of flavor, spicy enough and good portions. However, it wasn't super special. Better than most Chinese restaurants H&S soup which are usually watered down but still it was not special.\n\n-Spicy Tofu with Vegetables- 2 stars out of 5. It was really bland and not that spicy. It was also luke warm.As if  someone else ordered it, sent it back and then we ordered it and they sent it back out. \n\nMandalay Noodle-  4 out of 5 stars. This was my favorite dish of the meal. It was full of flavor, a little crunchy and the chicken and lemongrass was a really touch.\n\nOverall Mandalay is good. It's a nicer more relaxing atmosphere with decent food.

Changs is going to be good, but you might have some uncertainty about Mandalay.  That is exactly what I was feeling - uncertainly.\n\nWhen my gf and I finally got our table at Mandalay, it took no time for us to get our order placed and for the plates to get to our table. Our order consisted of these dishes:\n\nChicken Satay:\nDry, pitifully small, little over lukewarm, bland-tasting (in flavor and texture).  The frozen chichen yakitori from Costco is 1000x better.  The peanut sauce that came with it looked like baby vomit, and didn't taste much better.  Best of Thai's satay BLOWS THEM OUT THE WATER.\n\nThe Prawn and Walnut:\nCold, soggy, and waaay overly mayonnaise'd.  The walnuts tasted old, as if the nut's natural oils were going rancid.  They used a nice plate, but who cares?  P.F. Chang's Melon and Walnut Prawns BLOWS THEM OUT THE WATER.\n\nThe Mandalay Beef:\nThis was the better of the three dishes that we ordered; it was served hot, sugary, a little spicy, and vaguely crispy with heavy orange/citrus influence.  It was simple and edible, but nothing anywhere near writing home about.  P.F. Chang's Orange beef BLOWS THEM OUT THE WATER.\n\nTo recap, I would have rather eaten at P.F. Chang's than at Mandalay.

The chicken samusas were spot on, crispy on the outside, inside had great texture and flavor.\n\nThere were lots of comments on the Tea Leaf Salad so of course we had to give it a try.  It was definitely an unexpected experience, and for what it was, tasty, but there was nothing about it that grabbed me and made me want to order it again.\n\nThe soup was excellent, spicy, tangy but with a hint of sweetness.  It was obvious that all the ingredients were fresh and worked well together.  Thumbs up.  The curried lamb was tender and moist and the Mandalay Special Noodles were creamy with a nice crunchiness from the fried onions.  \n\nAll in all it was a good experience but I'd be a little wary about a long wait, might not be quite worth it.", "author": "Mike I."}

After being Burma Superstar groupies for six years, my boyfriend and I checked this place out the other night because we had heard great things. There was a bit of a wait, but dear me was it worth it. \n\nThe staff was accommodating and friendly and the food was out of this world. We started off by ordering a pitcher of ginger beer (which the waitress said would get us two glasses each, but ended up being about 3.5) and it was wonderful. Then we moved on to the food. Being fans of Burma's tea leaf salad, we thought we would mix it up and try the ginger salad, which was fantastic. We also got the lemon chicken and Mandalay beef with coconut rice and ended up scarfing it all down in about ten minutes because it was so delicious. I usually hate ordering beef at Thai/Burmese/Chinese places because I always find it a bit tough and chewy, so I wasn't very excited when my boyfriend insisted on doing it, but in the end, I was thrilled. The Mandalay beef was the best thing we ate all night. The sauce was delicious and the meat was cooked to perfection. It was melt-in-your-mouth awesomeness, Burmese style. \n\nI think the waitress may have overheard us saying it was our new favorite SF date spot, because soon after, she brought us complimentary mango pudding desserts, which were also delicious. Neither of us like pudding, but we both practically licked the bowls. \n\nI would absolutely recommend Mandalay to anyone interested good Burmese food...or just good food in general. It was fantastic.", "author": "Jessica H."}

(Namely to Burma Superstar or even B-Star) \nSadly, I am one of those people who judges others by what they eat. If we eat Thai and the first thing you want is Pad Thai or if you consider Panda Express authentic 'Chinese' food-you are on my dumbass list. Thank goodness my best friend a) went to culinary school b) doesn't give a shit about what I think and c) has incredible taste. She took me here after we had a hard time getting into the overcrowded BS. We were seated immediately by the courteous, if slightly, too attentive waitstaff. \n\nRainbow Salad\nSalad prepared with eight ingredients served with house special dressing: tofu, noodles, tomato, ginger powder, chopped herbs, bean sprouts, crispy fried garlic, diced potatoes, green papaya and a delicious tamarind dressing among other things. This was an amazing dish; sweet, sour; crunchy, savory, soft, springy. The server brought it out with each element presented separately on the plate and then mixed it in front of us. The idea is that you're supposed to understand how all these different elements mix into a sublimely yummy mix. Duly yummy.  \n\nSamusa (with Chicken or Vegetarian)\nA mixture of grounded curried meat and potatoes\nYou can rarely go wrong with fried products. There were A LOT of samusas! I think maybe, 5? Even for two women with moderate appetites they were a lot. We still managed to finish them. Curried, hot and crispy. \n\nBurmese Style Noodle (Kaw Soi Dok)\nEgg noodles topped with fried onion, fried garlic chips, cucumber slices, grounded split beans and chef's delicious dressing; sort of the same as the Rainbow salad. Still really good, but overshadowed by the former. \n\nMango Chicken\nPan fry chicken sauteed with fresh mango, onions, and green chili\nThis was my only regret of the meal. It just didn't compare with the rest of dinner; but I think if ordered on its own- it would be good. Juicy chunks of mango paired with wok fried chicken is always a good safe bet. \n\nI want to go back to try the Balada with curry sauce. The two of us were stuffed!

Their food is delicious, with the tea leaf salad as the definite front runner and their seafood dishes taking a close second. The interior has a great ambiance and the service is impeccable. They also have a wonderful tea selection, including blooming jasmine. I'm not sure how Burma Superstar shot to fame over Mandalay, but Mandalay is very yummy and you never have the 2 hour wait in a crammed little entryway that you'll encounter only a couple blocks away.", "author": "Rebecca D."}

I ordered a flowering jasmine green tea. This was really a unique drink with the bud of a jasmine flower floating in hot water, presented in a wine glass. The only thing I did not care for was the complimentary sweat potato desert. Overall, the price was reasonable for the quality and the portions. \nAnother table of diners were celebrating a birthday. So at one point, over the sound system, Happy Birthday tunes merrily sang out....it was funny to be in a Burmese restaurant with an American birthday sing-a -long. But it beats all of the staff circling the table and singing off key. This added to the fun of a night out.", "author": "jennifer c."}

I walked in hungry and excited, but walked out disappointed. I felt like we wasted our money here. What I had either lacked flavor or had an eerie taste to it. Their rice crisp soup was very bland and barely had anything in it except for a few baby carrots and veggies in the broth. We had their rainbow salad, which is a salad with eight different ingredients in a house dressing. I've had a tea leaf salad elsewhere before which had a similiar concept as the rainbow tea salad and it was fantastic, so I figured this one would be interesting to try. Boy was I wrong. It had a very strange taste and left an after taste in my mouth I didn't like. Other dishes we had weren't anything special at all. I don't this place is as good as what others say it is or maybe we just ordered the wrong items on the menu.", "author": "Staci G."}

Fellow San Franciscans, you've failed me, because after waiting for almost an hour, and chatting with a lady who finished dining and happily told us that we can't go wrong with any of the food here, we entered with some high expectations, which ended up being entirely unmet.\n\nThe tea salad was the only dish I really enjoyed.  The fish cakes were just so-so, and seemed rather pricey at $8.  I expected something \"authentically burmese\" with the Mandaly chicken, but what we got was surprisingly similar to Panda Express orange chicken.  The Rangoon beef dish was an uninspired stir fry.\n\nThe \"special\", called \"Shaking Duck\", was a complete failure.  I few slices of cold and poorly cut duck (it was supposedly boneless, but had bone chips here and there), on top of a pile of cold cooked spinach that literally tasted dank, atop some cold pumpkin, in a pool of overly sweet mango syrup.  The whole pile looked and tasted like an amateurish attempt at horrible fusion cuisine.\n\nIt might have been bearable if this meal was $20 a person with a drink, but at closer to $30, it wasn't a good deal.  I also might have given another star, if the staff wasn't so busy taking out the trash, to take our bill so we could be on our merry way.", "author": "D X."}

Who knows - its still super good - only not as super good. Memory does that.\n\nWhen I was in Burma a few years ago they served La Pat Doc everywhere, and it tasted just like home to me.\n\nThey do have other things on the menu that seem like Burmese too, but it tends to slip across the border into Chinese territory often.

Once you are seated (which happens almost immediately, because there is not a hipster-ridden line to wait in - yay!), you are greeted by lovely and friendly ladies who typically wear traditional Burmese outfits.  The interior is decorated with really cool tapestries, tea lights and flowers and makes the whole restaurant feel like a little escape.  The waiters are very prompt and friendly (another plus over Burma Star) and make you feel at home.  \n\nBut you don't go to a restaurant to chew the scenery, do you?  The food is the best Burmese I've ever had.  The samosa soup is to die for.  It's perfectly spicy and creamy all at once, the little chunks of samosa and what tastes like falafel add the right amount of texture, and one portion is enough for 3 people.  \n\nIn addition to the Samosa soup, you should definitely order one of their many salads.  My personal fave is the tea leaf salad, but the rainbow salad is also quite good.  The presentation is impressive - the salad arrives with all the ingredients (there never seems to be less than 12) separate and the waitress, after explaining what each ingredient is, deftly mixes them into a super duper tasty concoction.\n\nThe entrees are all very good, my new favorites being the rangoon chicken and walnut chicken.  The walnut chicken has more Chinese flavors, but it's like the best Chinese food you've ever tried.  The rangoon chicken comes with a tangy and spicy dipping sauce and is perfect with the coconut rice.

All our dishes came without a lot of wait. They didn't all come together but that was fine with us because we shared everything anyway.\n\nYummy mummy! All the dishes were really awesome, and I have to say, better then the overpriced, over-hyped, Burma SS. Don't get me wrong, I'll probably order take out from BSS from time to time because I really like their Sambosa soup but Mandalay's food is definitely superior overall. There, I said it!\n\nOh, yes..I also ordered their Burmese iced tea which was as delicious and as identical to its Thai cousin. They also served water with a cherry rather than a lemon wedge. The water tasted pretty good too.\n\nDon't believe me? well, go find out for yourself. You won't be disappointed. Unless, of course, you like hanging out with the crowd waiting to be seated at BSS.\n\nUpdate: They are really nice. When the wait becomes long then they usually offer a free wine glass.

The atmosphere is colorful and vibrant; the service is solicitous and helpful. I have 1 vegetarian and he had a lot of options to choose from, not including Mandalay's ability to convert regular dishes to vegetarian. We started with an order of vegetarian and meat egg rolls that the kids devoured.

(ok, so he didn't have a \"taste orgasm\" here, but those are so few and far between and are oftentimes once-in-a-lifetime events, even at consistently good restaurants) can we achieve world peace now? how about freeing tibet without any further bloodshed?? or, more importantly, can i find a hot date now??? PLEASE????\n\n- the service is so much better than most asian restaurants. they even play \"happy birthday\" in both mandarin and english versions over a stereo system in the restaurant if it's a birthday celebration!!! WTF...SCHWEET!!!! (note to self: have next birthday dinner here with lots of friends and MAKE them sing both versions)\n\n- i just like being able to babble incessantly to my patient friend at a table without fear of someone eavesdropping or scrutinizing our choices for dinner or being rushed in and out of the restaurant like cattle. being able to have a good laugh and talk about politics at a restaurant with an average noise decibel is a plus in my book. and, usually, a glowing, neon green palm tree would be rather disturbing, but mandalay somehow makes it work along with the christmas ornaments hanging from the ceiling. they figured out the fine line between charming and borderline kitschy-trashy.", "author": "May T."}

My wife had been here about 20 years ago, before they got popular and said it was really good.  And it was.  The food was incredibly tasty.  The meat was a little on the sweet side for me, but still delicious.  Portions were small though - much smaller than I expected for the price.  The place was packed and a bit too loud for any sort of romance.  The hostess was really nice and quick, but the servers (although somewhat attentive) first brought us something we didn't order, and then forgot to bring us something else that we HAD ordered.

This was not taken lightly, the waitress told us it couldn't be done but after consulting with another waitress came back to tell us with much contempt that she would allow it ONLY this one time because we had waited over an hour (despite the fact that we had ordered separately on previous occasions). I mean, it wasn't as if we didn't spend as much on the separate meal as the set menu, the vegetarian ordered two entrees...  \n\nWe were totally baffled by the pursed lips and disdain, it was totally uncalled for. Seriously, it was like getting in trouble at school with the headmistress, and for what, just so we could enjoy a meal we were paying for??  Somehow we had pissed them off and that was the end of it for us... the nightmare continued. \n\nOne of the three soups came late, we had to ask for it and was told it was coming, no apology. It finally came after we asked a second time but not before the entrees arrived. The last of the three set menu dishes also came much later than the rest, by the time it came there was little rice left. When we tried to ask for more rice, we were ignored TWICE, quite obviously too just to be sure we knew we weren't welcome. \n\nMidway through our dining 'experience' a waitress comes to ask for their 5 business cards back that my child had been playing with. Sure business cards are costly to print but would you really disturb your patrons over a mere 5?? after such atrocious service and average food...  Don't worry, there's no way would I pass along those cards of yours even if I got to keep them!!\n\nAs the nightmare is coming to an end, the original nasty waitress comes to take our plates away and despite seeing that my toddler was still picking from her plate (she hesitated midway so she knew) she still took it anyway as my baby reached for it to get more. Thankfully I caught this and managed to give my baby back her food from the mean lady. You don't take a plate from someone who's eating, regardless of their age, crazy woman!\n\nNope, not coming back, the food ain't worth the insult.", "author": "tweet y."}

Fried Green Beans, Mandalay Beef and Chicken and the coconut rice always!  Nothing too unusual for our guests.  An occasional spring roll and soup if we were feeling crazy.  \nUnfortunately it had been a while since my last visit and I anxiously awaited my usual fare.  My tastes have matured in the passing years however, and i wanted to explore the menu a bit more.  I caved and went with the comfort food: coconut rice, fried green beans with tofu, hot and sour soup and the Rangoon Beef.  The soup has been the same since the beginning, AWESOME.  The rice was perfect along with the green beans;  fresh and crisp complementing the crunch of the tofu.  The beef tied it all together marinated, grilled then served with the red and green peppers.  It was one helluva meal.  \nThe prices have gone up a lot and I never get tired of the ball point price over a bed of faded white out.   The staff has rarely changed over the years and it was good to see a familiar face when I walked in.  The bonus of being a loyal customer??  Getting free dessert after paying the check.

They had a pretty extensive menu of both Burmese and Mandarin cuisines, but we opted to try familiar and not so familiar Burmese dishes as we've heard this restaurant is often compared to Burma Superstar (a favorite of ours).  I order one of the lunch combination which includes basil chicken and a tea leaf salad.  (At $9.95 also served with the soup of the day, it's a deal!)  The basil chicken was tasty.  I loved the fact that it was all chicken breast, and the pieces were perfectly bite-sized.  It was prepared with very little veggies, just sparse thin slices of green and red peppers and onions.  My major gripe is that the dish was swimming in sauce.  Thankfully, though, it wasn't served over rice, but in its own serving dish and rice in its own bowl as well.  (I was able to control my sauce intake nicely.)  The tea salad, that ironically was served a little after my entree, was delectable.  However, its not as dynamic as the one at Burma Superstars as there was no lettuce, noodles or veggies in Mandalay's version.  (Basically, it was two types of nuts, tea leaves and garlic pieces.)   \n \nThe restaurant is spacious and well lit.  The walls are nicely decorated with what we could only assume is authentic Burmese framed cloths and  artwork as well as nice large mirrors that matched the motif.  The ceilings are high and red and green scrolls almost drape the entire ceiling just before the open pillars that line the ceiling.  Strange-- they have green (Christmas) garlands that line the ceiling pillars and Christmas ornaments hanging from the pillars.\n \nI'd definitely go to Mandalay again...there's so much more to try like the mango chicken, samusas, various noodle dishes and the Mandalay chicken (tried a piece, it was divine!)...next time I'll go with my boyfriend and make a more accurate assessment and answer the question: Which restaurant is better, Mandalay or Burma Superstar?", "author": "Marie B."}

We started with the rainbow and tea leaf salad.  Both were fresh and mixed at the table after an explanation by the friendly, attentive staff.  All the dishes had lots of garlic and none were too spicy.   Rainbow chicken was the only meat dish in order to accommodate a semi vegi in the group.  The chicken was crisp and accompanied by colorful veggies.  Many of the dishes had fresh mangoes.  My favorite dish was the three Rangoon with large soft pieces of calamari, shrimp and scallops joined by tasty tomatoes.

I got the walnut prawns, and for 12 dollars got 6 pieces of shrimp. It was decent, but I expected way more. My boyfriend got the Mandalay beef, which basically tasted like some greasy fried beef from the panda express.\n\nEven P.F. Chang's has more authentic asian food. We waited for 20 minutes, and the food was not worth it. To give them credit, the waiters and waitresses were very nice and attentive. However, the place was crowded, cramped, and loud. There were babies screaming, and there our table was sandwiched between other parties so closely that I could barely escape.\n\nLesson learned-if you want burmese food, just wait in line for Burma Superstar; it's well worth it. If you want americanized asian food, check out P.F. Chang's before you check this place out. Also, if you MUST try Mandalay, come here for lunch.

Sweet...\n\nOur food finally arrives, it looks like there are a lot of Chinese, Thai, and Indian influences on Burmese cuisine - no surprise.  1. came first, it was quite heavy on the walnuts, wish there was more tofu and broccoli, the sauce was pretty good - we gobbled every bit of it up quickly, then waited some more for 2. to arrive.  While patiently waiting, the owner comes up to our table and asks if we are enjoying ourselves, we say we are fine.  Then he stands there and says, can I get you anything else?  Uh...He was trying to hurry us out before we even got our 2nd dish!  We said, yes you can get us the rest of our order!  He replied, oh sorry, right away.  Our send dish comes (handmade noodles, fried shallots, tofu, lemon grass, cilantro, and crispy fried noodles), the waitress brought the dish, explained the ingredients, tossed it together and left us to serve ourselves, this dish was OK, the 1st dish was better.  Nevertheless, we ate every bit, paid the check and headed out.\n\nI will say the food really hit the spot after a long day of hiking.  \n\nMay have to come back another day without the hiking to make sure it's still good even when not ravenously hungry enough to eat my own hand...", "author": "Burrito M."}

I had gone here with a large group of 8 people and the wait was about 1.5 hours. We were finally seated and this place does have more room to roam around but the food here is not as impeccable as the other place. We ordered tons of dishes to basically sample the menu. The rainbow salad here is very weak compared to the 22 ingredient loaded version. Mandalay's version is 12-15 ingredients which don't mix well and leaves an odd taste in your mouth. The walnut prawns and everything else was good but I still prefer Burma Superstar. The coconut drinks are served straight from the nut itself but does need some sweetners. Go to Mandalay for group dinners while go to Burma Superstar for more intimate dinners with your honey. If all else fails, order to go and eat at the numerous parks and beaches in San Francisco. Trust me, the food at both places are good but we all have time, and time should not be wasted.", "author": "Danster L."}

Their lemonade is awesome, and for whatever reason their spinach is wonderful. Spinach - so simple - but it's great here. There's some dish with broccoli, candied walnuts, and spicy chicken that's really excellent. And they have a rice option that's good (with raisins, bay leaves, and a spice) that's quite good but much more of a side dish than a rice option. I'd stick with plain ol rice if you just want something to accompany your other dishes.", "author": "Jen D."}

While I'm not an expert by any means on Burmese food and culture, I believe this ginger salad, a combination of nuts, dry garlic, ginger, lentils, and bits of hemp twine, was developed to keep the Burmese army regular. Ironically, the Thai's have a similar dish which is eaten in a rolled up piece of lettuce, which is out of this world. When we were eating this salad, I kept thinking the Burmese Ashton Kutcher from Punked was going to jump out from behind the Christmas-festooned [see review date]  swags that 'decorate' the restaurant.

For entrees, we had the spicy Mango Chicken, which can be noted for neither being spicy nor containing any substantial amounts of anything resembling fowl. If you like stir-fried mango, this dish is for you. The beef in the Beef Curry was extremely chewy and had to be chewed at length in order to be forced down the gullet.

His Burmese iced tea, which was slightly less sweet than a Thai iced tea, was served in a swanky, tall swirled glass. My ginger lemonade was quite sweet but tempered with mint leaves. I can get behind our dishes - tofu and veggies in a yummy sauce and Birds Nets [sic] seafood - and our appetizer - a pancakey thing with an oniony sauce. The best part was the numerous typos and occasionally awkward names in the menu.

However, I don't believe it is authentic burmese food.\n\nI spent a few weeks backpacking through Burma two summers ago.  The food was terrable.  For three weeks, I survived on a diet of diarhea inducing indian food (a lot of Indians live in Burma), as the diahrea was more pleasant than what was available at burmese restaurants and noodle shops.\n\nThe best burmese dish I had in Burma was a bowl of stomach soup that I had at a food stall at an animist festival about 30 miles outside of Mandalay.  It was surprisingly delicious.  The woman that served it to me had the most beautiful, perfectly aligned, pearly white teeth.  More beautiful than said teeth found in the typical mouth of your upper middle class american college student whom had the benefit of braces in his/her youth.  Teeth such as her's are not  common in the third world, and even less so in betel nut addicted Burma.\n\nGo to Burma for its beauty, the unique temples of Bagan, and to meet some of the most good hearted people in this not always friendly world.    If you are going to burma for the food, I would skip the long, multiple layover flight and  head down the street to Mandalay Restaurant, as it tastes better than stomach soup.", "author": "Mark K."}

Let me begin with the fact that food was really great so ordinarily I would rate in the 3-4 range. However, and this is the main however, the service was abysmal. I made a reservation for my birthday a week in advance for a party of 12. The restaurant was very crowded though it being a Saturday, I shouldn't have been surprised. We were offered drinks to order while waiting but even so, they took their time getting to us. Once we got there, the fact that we made reservations made absolutely no difference because we were not seated for over 40 minutes.The waiters took their time to us menus and take our orders. Once the food order was actually placed, it took over another 40 minutes for all of us to get our orders. In fact several wrong dishes were brought to our table first and we had to ask several times where the rest of our order was. At one point, one of the waiters even spilled a drink on one of my attendees. \n\nNow given all that, I rate the food with a 4.5 but the service with a 1 so to be fully fair, overall it was and is a 2 start experience. Mandalay was a good idea because the food when it actually got there, was awesome, but the fact that it took so long to come and that we frankly did not get a feeling of being appreciated for our patronage makes me unhappy with the experience. I imagine it's lovely for small groups, no more than 4 people but for large groups, please seek other venues.", "author": "Eugenia S."}

I think places are just overbooking and becoming stretched beyond capacity, which, in turn, stretches everyone -- the kitchen, the staff and the patrons -- likewise beyond capacity.  At least, that theory is consistent with my experience tonight at Mandalay.  We were seated about 45 minutes late for our 8:15 reservation, as were the other two groups who had that reservation.  (In fairness, we actually had a better experience in this regard than one table of three that were seated at a two-person table and had to squeeze in -- then didn't get drinks or anything else for half an hour or so.)  More than 50 minutes then passed until we got our appetizers.  In light of this, I was hoping that the food would be good, but it seems like the kitchen was overburdened and really letting things go.  The noodle dish that I had tasted like cold, overdone spaghetti with coconut curry sauce.  I had about a quarter-cup and couldn't eat anymore.  Others were equally impressed with their dishes.  The best thing that the table adjacent to us said about their dishes was, \"I don't mind it.\"  The salads were bland and unimpressive -- the tea leaf salad in particular, which I generally like a lot, was best described as peanuts in green sauce.  Overall, we spent about fifteen minutes of our total two hours here with food, almost none of which we actually ate.  A thing like that really ruins your night -- it's not worth paying for, and I wish we had not stayed.  The only positive thing was that the staff, although obviously stretched thin, was not totally unpleasant, although relations were a little strained.", "author": "Danielle G."}

With Burma Superstar just a stone's throw away, why roll the dice on an unfamiliar Burmese place?\n\nOn sitting down and perusing the menu, I was made even more suspicious when I realized the place offered Chinese AND Burmese cuisine and I heard some kitchen staff speaking Mandarin. If there is one thing I have learned about Asian food in my time living on the continent and eating at countless Asian joints in America, it's that the fewer cuisines/dishes offered on the menu, the better the food usually is.\n\nTrying to keep an open mind, I ordered only Burmese dishes from the menu. Each dish impressed me more than the last. The tea leave salad was exceedingly flavorful, packed with enough roasted garlic to punish my friends for the rest of the weekend. And the balaka (?) Burmese pancakes achieved the perfect balance of oil and flakiness. \n\nThe staff, from the owner who opened the door for us when we walked in to the waitress who stirred our salad with a smile and a clear explanation of the ingredients, obviously took pride in their work.

Came for dinner with two stoney guys who could not stop raving about the service and tasty grub.  I raved along to be polite, but the food just didn't sit well in my mouth.  Had the 1) tea leaf salad, 2) samosa salad 3) dry fried green beans, 4) basil eggplant, 5) coconut rice and brown rice and I would say the tea leaf salad was the best, abeit very small.  I liked the two salads because they were different from the usual asian offerings, but still, they did not blow my mind.  The vegetable dishes were very very very average, perhaps even below average. I don't eat meat and I am often disappointed in the vegetarian offerings at restaurants, especially asian restaurants.  These places think that just because you can't use meat in a dish, you should load it with a super oily and salty sauce.  I am an awesome cook, so I am very picky about food when I eat out. I know it is not hard to make a stir-fry - all you need is fresh veggies, spices, and a little bit of oil. So anyways, because I cook, it makes it very difficult for me to eat out and actually feel impressed.  When I am impressed, I become a very loyal customer because I feel the care the cooks put into their food.  \nThe best part of Mandalay is the service.  The hostess and our server (a 50-ish gentleman) were amazing.  They were very excited about us trying their establishment and took great care of us.  \nWill I be coming back? Sadly no.  There are just too many great restaurants in San Francisco to come back to something you are not so excited about.  I came to Mandalay because I was not so impressed with Burma Superstar.  However, I think I might just come back to Burma Superstar because I felt their food was more authentic and there is just more care put into their food.

These portions are only a bit bigger than BS but its not like it makes that much of a difference. I can't say I enjoyed this restaurant as much as the other reviewers. I was prepared for this place since most of the reviewers are not Asian.  No, I'm not being racist. The only way you can tell if the ethnic cuisine restaurant is good is when you see their own people go there. Although.. I don't know of too many Burmese people. In my whole entire life, I've only met 2 Burmese people. One of which introduced me to BS. \n\nAnyhow.. on with the review.. We had a party of 4 and ordered the following:\nTea Leaf Salad - its got crunch but the flavors did not meld together very well. I would have preferred that the lady left the lemon behind so I could squeeze more in there\nCoconut Chicken Noodle Soup - I like this because it comes with parsley and lemon wedges. I'm a condiment lover. The taste was good. Too bad they were cup sized. I would've liked more.\nBurmese Curry Beef - you get to choose between coconut rice, saffron rice, or Balada; we chose balada. This dish was not that great and balada wasn't that memorable either. I tried to dip it in the curry but the curry was not smooth. There were floating chunks of the sauce with the beef and potatoes. I would've preferred for it to be a bit saltier and more curry flavor.]\nDry pan string bean - this is pretty good. Just like Cantonese style, they fry the beans first then saute them with sauce. I'd order these again.\nMandalay special noodle - mixed at the table, i thought the consistency was a bit weird but the flavor was pretty good. I'm not sure if i like the texture though. I'm not into slimy flat noodles. But I would order this again.\nCoconut rice - I am starting to like coconut rice. First time I had it was at an Indian restaurant. This one was simple. Small coconut flakes in rice. I'd order it again because I have a love for coconut. I used to hate flakes but I'm liking them as I'm growing older. Go figure...\nWater - they give this to you with a maraschino cherry in it. I like it but I tell Mr. C not to eat it since its bad for guys to eat them. Something about lowering their sperm count? (more for me.. hehee)\n\nOverall, I would only order a few things from here if I was ever dragged here again. I thought the service was great and the ladies were nice but the food doesn't satisfy my taste buds. If I have to wait at BS, I won't go here instead.

Although I'm not Burmese, but felt we like we could find most of the dishes at a Chinese restaurant. Now I feel like I'm writing a negative review for BSS. ANyway....\n\nMandalay on the other hand was purely incredible. OUr expectations were high, and then totally met. We had heard of this BSS competitor thru the grapevine. So let's cut to what we ordered:\n\n1. rainbow salad -- some great ingredients mixed with some great noodles. it was literally a burst of flavor.\n2. catfish chowder - oh my god this was too good to be true. make sure you get it with noodles! they are super soft and goes down like water\n3. mandalay special noodles -- absolutely delish!\n4. crispy chicken - generally good. the breast meat was a little dry which is expected. but it was super crunchy and made it more fun to eat\n\np.s. make sure you get the hot sauce paste! it's enough spicy so that it's not too hot and not too bland. it goes perrrfect with everything, especially the coconut rice. makes for a perfect complement to the milky flavor!\n\nyummmmmy yummmmmmy", "author": "Connie N."}

Today at lunch we had Tea Leaf Salad, Mango Chicken, Lamb Curry with Coconut Rice, and Burmese Noodles with Coconut Chicken. For an appetizer we had Chicken Samusas.  The sauces are delicious and perfectly compliment the food.  The drinks such as Lemonade Ginger and Burmese Iced Tea are yummy.  The restaurant is decorated in a warm, charming fashion with art work from Burma.  Definitely the place for Burmese cuisine!  I have been to Burma Superstar, and it cannot compare to Mandalay.", "author": "barbara f."}

But why does spinach with garlic cost the same amount as chicken? \n\nI always get the Mongolian Beef. Interestingly enough,  If you eat at the restaurant and order wine, they bring out this god-forsaken, clumsy, metal contraption for pouring wine. It takes up way too much space on the table! Mandalay, don't try to be fancy. The bottle will do just fine. \n\nAnother story: when my pooky bear and I were dining in one night, we overheard some couple asking for no garlic with their food. No garlic!  Thats is the most fantastically retarded thing I have ever heard of. That's like going to a Mexican restaurant and not wanting anything with onions, cilantro, or cheese. What the hell did you come for?\n\nIf you are that ridiculous don't come. More room for real Asian food lovers. \n\nOh! And try the eggplant! The eggplant is delicious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-11", "description": "As a big fan of Burma Superstar, I wanted to try my taste buds at another Burmese restaurant.  When I read other reviews, I was excited to see Mandalay was rated #1 under Burmese cuisine.  There were mentions of this as \"the other burmese restaurant in the city\", so I knew it had to be good.  Plus, there were promises of not having to wait!  \n\nI  called at about 5pm and made a reservation for 630 and that was no problem. We arrived a little late, not to mention the lack of parking and the really annoying construction going on in the area, but the restaurant was full yet, so I was glad to be seated right away.  The workers there were really nice and friendly.  The waiter asked if it was our first time there and when we said yes, he continued to explain what the restaurant was all about.  We decided to try Mandalay's version of our favorite dish from Burma Superstar - Rainbow Salad.  They did the whole explanation of the dish and mixed it at our table just like at BS. I found the dish a little smaller, but it was comparable.  We also ordered Rainbow shrimp (with pineapple and mango) and Mandalay Beef.  We couldn't help be feel like these dishes tasted just like.. Chinese food. Now Mandalay does claim to be Burmese/Mandarin Chinese cuisine, but we were looking forward to a little more on the Burmese side. The shrimp dish was pretty good, but the Mandalay Beef (claimed to be Burmese style) tasted just like Chinese sesame beef... not too impressed.  At the end of the meal, we mentioned the ad that I read on their yelp page for a free desert and they were really happy that I mentioned it.  The dessert was a really simple mango custard thing, but they were really appreciative of us coming based on what we read on here, so it was really cute.  And our meal was cheaper than it would have been than at BS.\n\nI think I am better impressed with BS, but I liked that there was no wait and the workers here are so friendly.  However a recent discovery of a second BS in Alameda with hardly any wait has been great too!\n\nPS - I ordered the \"Burmese Thai Iced Tea\" after the waiter told me it is  better than Thai Iced Tea because they use Burmese Tea Leaves, but...  it tasted the same...", "author": "Joyce S."}

UGH!)  i have tried four of their soups, and they were all excellent.  their tea salad is wonderfully intense, so much so, i like to eat it over rice.  i have tried a few of their noodles dishes, and they've all been great.  same can be said about their salads.   i always get their coconut tapioca drink.  its so yummy good, and its huge!  mandalay is a staple in my routine.", "author": "Curtis Y."}

We chose Mandalay because I tried a Burmese restaurant in NY before, and was craving for more. To our surprise, the food was the best Burmese food we ever tried.  We ordered tea leaf salad, pork curry stew and house special noodle.All the dish were extraordinary and out-of-ordinary, both were exactly what we were looking for. We noticed their custom of serving the plate with the ingredients separated, before the waitress mixed them up in front of us immediately before we ate them. The result was excellent concoctions that  were savory in taste and retains the freshness/crispiness of every ingredients. Such a delight! For you who love Asian cuisine, you are still missing something if you haven't tried Burmese cuisine. With it's being influenced by three major cuisine centers (Chinese,Indian and Thai) all combined into their own style, Burmese cuisine is an underrepresented culinary offerings that should not be missed by most.", "author": "Jeffrey D."}

It's just so damn good and reasonably priced and has such friendly staff people that four stars just doesn't seem like enough.  I've been three times now and have had three great meals with a different dish on each occasion.  The Mandalay Special Noodles with coconut chicken, cilantro, lime leaf, ground yellow split peas, and fried onions is really special and the servers mix all the ingredients of the dish together when they bring it to the table.  And they make sure to identify each ingredient so you know exactly what you're getting.  The black pepper soup is also delicious, with thin slices of cucumber, chunks of whitefish, mushrooms, and glass noodles in a mild broth with enough black pepper to give it a little kick.  It's beautifully simple and the perfect antidote for a chilly Inner Richmond afternoon.  Ditto for the Burmese hot and sour soup, with shrimp, sour leaves, mushrooms, chili peppers (be careful with these -- I almost coughed one up and my girlfriend laughed at me), and lemongrass in a robust tomato broth.  This is refined Burmese food, expertly and lovingly prepared and served in a warm, comfortable atmosphere for affordable prices.  And they give you free hot tea with your meal!  Even without the free tea, I'd give Mandalay five stars.  It's just that good.", "author": "Dan L."}

We had the balada (I think the curry dipping sauce could be better - I like Straits version), the tea leaf salad (I think this is much better at Burma Superstar) - the tea leaves were clumpy so it didn't mix properly making some bites very bitter, the curry chicken was quite good, rangoon beef and string beans pretty good.  Service was very sweet but the timing was off.  The curry chicken and coconut rice was served as we were finishing the tea leaf salad and then the next two entrees came out one by one when we were alrady done with the last.

One waitress took our drink order, another one came and got our food order but didn't write it down, then another lady asked us if we wanted water. After we got our burmese tea, we waited for 20min for our papaya salad, which smelled like clorox, but we ate it because we were starving by theb. We proceeded to wait another 20 mins for our curry, which came out in a small bowl, 11 bucks for two scoops! The meat was slightly chewy and the potatoes were hard! Saving grace of that meal was the added 3.50 for the naan bread. We waited another ten mins to get our check, not wanting to wait for the fried rice which we never got, and of course was on our bill!

Rarely do I come across a dish that EXPLODES with flavors like Mandalay's Tea Leaf Salad. It's not a \"Salad\" in the traditional sense. No lettuce here (the consistency is closer to tabbouleh) - finely chopped tea leaves. Mixed with peanuts, a little oil, lemon juice, garlic, tiny hot peppers and a few other bells and whistles. They mix it for you at your table. It's amazing and FUN! I really like \"fun\" food experiences. Seriously - don't go here and miss the Tea Leaf Salad! The prices are fair. I LOVE the decor. Somewhat traditional Thai - with the occasional disco-ball ornament hanging from the ceiling next to a gourd. And a neon Palm Tree in the corner. Seriously...I don't really understand it - but I get it. And love it! Their other dishes are good - nothing so spectacular as the Tea Leaf Salad - but good. Spicy Basil Eggplant with Tofu, I had a really good flat noodle dish here once. I think it had peanuts and ginger in it. There's only a few noodle dishes - but that was great too. Mango chicken - good. You have a few rice choices. Jasmine, Saffron with cinnamon and raisins, coconut. All good. Paluda Ice Cream for desert was fun. Had bits of tapioca and sat in a cup of coconut milk. A nice dish to end on.

Burmese cuisine seems to be a cross between Thai and Indian food, with maybe some Chinese thrown in for good measure, so on the menu you find things like samosas, shanghai noodles, tea leaf salad, mandalay beef, etc. You can order the garden variety sweet and sour chicken here. Most meat dishes come with the standard rice-vinegar-soaked carrots or papaya in cute shapes. The ladies are almost always dressed in nice bright silk skirts, and the interior is midly interesting to look at since they renovated - depending on what time of day you arrive, the place is packed or empty. I've had them tell me it was a 45 minute wait for a table before, and there are other times which I was immediately seated. If you're hungry and there's a table, have some food here.

So I ending up eating there last night with grandesque expectations, but left with mearly a grandesque stomach ache . \n\nThe first difference I noticed between Mandalay and BSS was that I struggled to find something on the menu that I wanted to order, whereas at BSS I'm already thinking about what I'm going to order on my next visit. My starters were good, but certainly not great, and my main course was plain awful. I felt like I could have been in any random Chinese restaurant where MSG is still the prodominant ingrediant. To end on an even worse note, we were presented with a \"complimentary\" dessert which was cleary old stock that they were trying to unload. I'll try anything once, so despite the strangly chewy yet flaky texture of this oddly shaped gelatin rectangle, i stuck my fork in and took a bite. I could have been chewing on an eraser and I would not be able to tell the difference. Seeing my face turn south, my girlfriend quickly cut hers into little pieces to create the illusion that she actually ate some of hers. With the check we were given fortune cookies, another bad sign. I would however like to point out that our waitress was very friendly and attentive.\n\nTypically I never eat at restaurants that claim two, let alone three completely different ethnic cuisines (Mandarin, Burmese and Thai in Mandalay's case), and anyone who knows anything about south east asian cuisine will tell you those three are distinctly different, despite their close geographic proximity. In this Yelper's opinion Mandalay and Burma Super Star should not even be mentioned in the same breathe.

While they don't have the Burma Cooler, which is unfortunate, they do have friendly service, a comparable quality of cuisine, and typically a shorter wait. One of the other benefits here over the Superstar is that seating is a bit more private so if you're doing the date thing you'll be able to converse more intimately. While I tend to think that the Superstar still may have the edge in pure deliciousness (Mandalay's about a 3.65 stars compared to a B.S. 3.9 stars, to me 5 is for an outstanding experience that food alone couldn't usually provide.) Mandalay provides a great dining experience with typically easier accessability. Oh and one more hint stay away from the deep fried appitizer stuff. Not that its not good, it just ruins the healthy goodness that is part of the Burmese experience.", "author": "Marc W."}

There is no attitude like the other place down the street. I am working my way through the menu and, after three visits, the only thing that I wouldn't order again are the pot stickers - they weren't bad but they just weren't out of this world like everything else I've tried. A particular favorite which I order every time is the Mandalay Special Noodle - somewhat like Pad Thai but so much lighter and more flavorful - really terrific!", "author": "Walter A."}

Apparently they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more, so the two of us turned up on Saturday night at prime dinner time hungry and hopeful. As we got there we realised we were nevertheless in for a wait...  of just over half an hour, as it turned out, but the guy in charge kept us up to date with progress and brought us some ginger lemonade while we waited, so we didn't mind quite so much.\n\nAfter we were seated came the difficult task of ordering, and quite frankly, this is where we took advice from all you fellow yelpers and ordered the tea leaf salad - it seems to be almost obligatory if you come here. It really is good though - such an unusual taste, and not like anything we had tried before. We also tried the samusa soup (tasty but not quite as special), the pan fried okra with prawns, the Rangoon beef and some coconut rice. Yum. The prawns were delicious and succulent (though not quite as spicy as I was expecting), the rice was tasty and my husband reported that the Rangoon beef was also very good. I thought we'd need to take leftovers home but not a chance (maybe that's where the 30 minute wait helped us out!). We even managed to share a dessert - a Burmese speciality made out of sweet potato, no idea what it was called but it was excellent. Then we paid and rolled home.\n\nThis was definitely a great experience and I'm sure we will be back (possibly not on a Saturday night though - we really, really hate waiting). Good food, good company and a lot of fun.", "author": "Laura J."}

Went to Burma Superstar first but looked like they closed for renovations, so we headed to Mandalay. The wait wasn't too bad. Everyone here writes about the Tea Leaf Salad so we had to try that, along with the Mango Chicken and Coconut rice. The salad came and our waitress prepared the salad tableside. It was a good presentation. But after tasting it though, gotta say, it was nothing special. I found it to be salty and didn't taste like anything worth ordering again. For those unfamiliar with it, after all the ingredients are mixed together, it looks like a dark green paste with a slightly pungent (likely fish sauce or Vietnamese mam), salty flavor and crunchy with the fried garlic and lentils. After having it, I really don't know why so many people talk about it. It is a dish different than most other Asian dishes. But it doesn't go in the \"taste good\" category to me. It's ok to try once, that's about it. The Mango chicken was good though. The flavor of the mangoes really came through. The coconut rice was also flavorful (but average as far as coconut rice goes). Overall, I found the restaurant to be decent for what it serves. If Burmese is what you want, I don't think you would be unhappy with it. But I realized on looking at the menu, that Burmese food is mostly Chinese and Indian food with some Thai tossed in. I didn't seem to notice any distinctive Burmese line of flavors, which may mean that you probably can get better Burmese dishes by going to Chinese, Indian, or Thai restaurants. Also interestingly, as someone else had mentioned, there were barely any Asian diners there at all. For a busy restaurant in that area and not get many Asian diners maybe telling of something.", "author": "Shin H."}

Free wine was a nice touch, but that's the only thing nice you'll hear me say. Brought tea, but no cups. Took half hour before they brought beers, but still no cups & no water. Finally brought water 10 minutes after the beer. I started drinking tea from the spoon on the table and they finally got the message. Ordered food, half the table getting the \"special dinner\" the other getting the \"royal dinner'. Neither were Royal or Special in the least. They were, however, the smallest portions I'd ever seen in my life. When they finally did bring the food, it was the at least 9:30pm at this point. The first dish went to the \"special people\" on the other side of the table, so I can't comment on that. My side was straight-up royalty. The Royal treatment so it seems, includes hair in your food, because the first dish that came our way contained one long black one. (that's what she said) We sent it back only to get the exact same plate sans hair. How do we know it was the same plate? well it was the same color and it's a salad that was originally mixed in front of use. The replacement plate was pre-mixed. Hair and service aside, the food was only so-so and not Zagat worthy. By the end of the meal, there was a little food left (due to everyone being to afraid to look like a fat hog taking more than one tablespon of food each) Anyway, we asked if they'd wrap it up and they never did. It supposedly got a 96 rating from the H.D. If hair in the food = 96 I'll be next door at the 100 rated sushi place. And if you're thinking of getting the set meal (special or royal), it only makes sense if you're a couple. Four plates for two people. If you add two more people to that order, they only bring two additional plates of food, not four. And no, they're not any bigger.", "author": "Aaron L."}

It's unfortunate because I had been here twice before, and found the food to be pretty good.  Tonight, I think our luck ran out.  First, they forget to bring a dish out.  It's not so bad at first, because at places like this, food doesn't always come at once.  It soon becomes apparent, though, that they completely forgot one of our orders because it still had not come after we finished off our first dish.  So we ask for it.  We wait a very long time, and still, no mu shu shrimp.  We had just about finished our second dish, and then my boyfriend bites into a piece of hard plastic.  It's unclear where this came from, but we suspect it was the chicken curry.  We tell them about it, and they were very apologetic and said that they would deduct this dish from our bill.  It was a nice gesture, but at this point, our dinner was kind of ruined.  And still no mu shu shrimp!  Finally, after what seems like an eternity, the shrimp arrives.  We manage to eat some of it, and then we ask for a box for the left-overs.  The bill comes, we pay, they make change, and we wait again.  No left-overs.  So we ask , and finally they bring our boxes.  In short, not a pleasant dining experience.  Watch out for plastic bits in the food!", "author": "J d."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-26", "description": "Mandalay serves some of the best Burmese food that I have ever heard, actually, my first and only Burmese experience so far.  The samosas are triangles of crispy deep fried dough filled with your choice of tender ground chicken, peas, onions, potato's, and curry or vegetarian which is everything without the chicken.  Fish cakes are crispy discs of fresh fish fried and spiced with Burmese spices served with a lemon grass dipping sauce.  The chicken satay is tender skewered strips of chicken marinaded in coconut milk and grilled to perfection with a peanut peanut sauce.  The Burmese onion bread with curry sauce is soft, chewy flat bread with a spicy curry dipping sauce that packs a one-two punch.  The rainbow fish is fresh rock cod braised in a spicy chili sauce with fresh vegetables.  The mango chicken is tender chunks of chicken sauted with mango in a mango sauce that is sweet, not too sweet.  Noodles with chicken in coconut sauce have tender chunks of chicken, aldentae flat noodles in a mild coconut sauce.  Noodles with chicken and lemon grass have tender chunks of chicken and flat aldentae noodles in a lemon grass type of sauce.  For dessert, the cream of wheat-like rectangular pastries with poppy seed are a great way to end with creamy wheat and nutty poppy seeds.  The other dessert, which The dessert of cold taro jello was not my favorite as it was cold and just tasted of chilled taro which I am used to having cooked various ways in Chinese restaurants.  The service is lively with Burmese decorations and music which is American songs being sung in Burmese which is cool.  The service is friendly, the staff very knowledgeable and answering any questions that you may have.  So, for Good Burmese food at reasonable prices with friendly and knowledgeable service in a lively, clean atmosphere, Mandalay cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}

First of all you do not need to wait hours to get a table but usually can get in pretty quickly, second you are not rushed to finish your meal but left to enjoy your tea and linger as long as you want,  third the staff is attentive and super friendly and finally but most important the food is cheaper and better.  Start with the Balada it's very flavorful with a yummy dipping sauce.  The rainbow salad is a cataclysm of flavors.  The mango chicken, okra prawns and ragoon beef are very good and the Mandalay noodles are a definite must.  Also be sure to try the coconut rice.  In fact I have never had a bad dish here.  And I don't think I've ever paid more than $25 for a meal  (the bill for 2 to share an appetizer, and 2-3 dishes with rice)  This is definitely one of my favorite ethnic places to eat in the city", "author": "Melanie -."}
