I opted for edamame set that comes with your choice of three onigilly. The spicy bacon caught my eye, but ultimately I kept it a little less rich with two chicken teriyaki and one miso nasu (eggplant with miso and sesame). \n\nFirst, the edamame set is a ton of food. For 9ish bucks I easily could have enjoyed two meals from the amount of food I received. The edamame was tender and lightly salted. I wasn't a huge fan of my miso nasu onigilly - it wasn't bad by any means, but a little too sweet for taste. I did really dig the teriyaki, though. I was also a fan of the proportions with the bulk being rice and the fillings as an accent for flavor. Due to the ratio you fill up quick; I could barely finish my second piece.

I went with a set that came with miso soup and really enjoyed both the crab and the tuna onigiri. The rice was warm and fresh and it was really impressive how quickly the kitchen staff worked to get all of our orders. They got one person's order wrong out of eight. \n\nIt's also really affordable considering the location. The set of two onigiri and miso soup is $7.25 to $8.63 depending on the type of fillings, and it was definitely satisfying and filling. \n\nA really great choice if you're craving Japanese, short on time, and want a good value.

I ordered the miso soup tray which included to onigiri and one cup of miso soup.\n\nFor my two onigiri I chose the spicy shrimp and spicy bacon. The spicy shrimp one was just a little bit bland. I was expecting it to have some more kick to it. Perhaps if it had a little bit more spice and some green onions to it, it would be better. The spicy bacon on the other hand was VERY flavorful. Definitely my favorite of the two. Nonetheless, the food was pretty good but I wasn't wowed with the options I chose. I will have to come back and try some of the other filling options. \n\nI came in around peak lunch time right around 12:30pm on the weekday and the line surprisingly wasn't too bad!

I highly suggest getting a \"set\", where you choose 3 types of onigiri and a side dish. I chose the edamame set because I'm a health buff (jk), plus added an order of tamagoyaki (sweet omelette). For my onigiri fillings I ordered: ume (pickled plum & shiso), soboro (ginger-honey beef), and snow crab (with lemon aioli). \n\nThe rice was well-seasoned and cooked and was mouthwatering in the toasted seaweed/nori - some of my fave flavors ever. My favorite I like the ume and snow crab best. The ume may be an acquired taste though, as it's super sour and will make your face pucker but then you'll crave it hardcore and learn to love it. The snow crab was slightly sweet and paired well with the nuttiness of the nori.

Now assuming a Japanese person rolls his r's into l's like in those bad propaganda World War II movies, you get this offensive variation of the term. At least it's been offensive to me since I heard it, although clearly not enough for me to not go to three of them by now. This one is in the former Prime Dip space that despite its Market Street address, is really hidden away in an alcove on 1st Street in the 455 Market building.\n\nIt's an awkward space where you turn a corner and order inside but have to wait outside for your food for the lack of space. It's frankly little more than a kiosk. The local hipsters don't seem to mind blocking the doorway and getting in the way of customers after them. I decided to order the $8.74 Edamame Set, a three-pack of onigiri with some edamame and pickles on the side. They come wrapped in nori with all kinds of Japanese-style stuffings, but I went with Soboro (ginger-honey braised ground beef), Shiitake (soy-braised shiitake mushrooms), and Unagi (broiled eel with barbecue sauce) (photo: http://bit.ly/2eYVVI4).\n\nIt was pretty good though nothing compared to what my mom could do when she was alive.

Your final price will vary depending on which of the onigiris you choose. I went with the shrimp, the crab meat, and the pollock roe. All three of them were delicious! Surprisingly flavorful for such simple food. They include just the right amount of rice to balance out the saltiness of the filling, and the seaweed they use is yummy too. The crab meat was probably my favorite, and it's actually legit crab meat...not imitation crab. \n\nMy food was ready within 5 minutes after I ordered. The workers here are all very friendly. Fantastic experience overall! Will definitely be coming back :)", "author": "Ashley Y."}

The rice bowls/salads consist of your base (rice or salad) topped with their toppings, which I just like way more in the rice ball form.\n\nMy fav toppings are:\nUME* - if you love Japanese plum and love sour things, this is the one for you! I am a huge sour fan, so I loved how the warm rice, salty seaweed contrasted with the sour plum. I always add some togarashi on top so it adds a nice spicy kick to the flavor mix. Highly recommend!\nUNAGI* - great flavors from their unagi. if you're usually an unagi fan, you'll love this for sure\n\n\nOther toppings I've tried:\nSalmon - nothing too special! I found the salmon to be quite dry and unflavorful.\nSnow Crab - not a fan...I felt like I was just eating a huge california roll without the avocado.\nTarako - way too fishy for me. Some people love it, some people hate it...unfortunately I was the latter.\nChicken Teriyaki - a bit weird in a rice ball, but if you usually like chicken teriyaki, you'll probably like this!\n\nI've also tried all their zosui rice soups, which are killer on a cold day! All the different ones (spicy bacon, salmon etc) are all really good!", "author": "Cynthia H."}

They have ~10 ish types of onigiri (japanese rice triangles with any filling), rice bowls, and salad bowls with the same mentioned toppings. Traditionally, the rice completely covers the filling, but here they make a sandwich out of the rice triangles and slather some filling inside. These days, they also have plastic wrapped seaweed so that the seaweed wrapping is not chewy and tough from the moisture from the rice when you finally are ready to eat it.\nThe fillings here have been decent, and the service has always been extremely friendly. \nHowever, the last few times I have had onigiri here, the rice was either undercooked or dry and not seasoned. The seaweed is there for structural support, but it gets soggy on the way back and ends up making the whole thing very chewy and hard and messy to eat. The edamame set option (3 onigiris and edamame and pickled radish on the side) surprises me that they would charge extra for this \"set\" that comes with a few edamame and three slices of pickled radish.\n\nThey do have good filling all made with a wide variety of ingredients. Would be a good place to come for lunch for a group of diverse tastes/dietary restrictions or a quick to-go lunch if it's not during peak hours.", "author": "Grace P."}

Choose from a salad or rice bowl topped with Japanese fillings such as teriyaki chicken and smoked eel or go for the traditional Onigiri, which is a \"rice ball\" filled with the same.\n\nRice ball is in quotes because at Onigilly, they take two flat pieces of compressed rice and fill the middle with your filling of choice, making it more akin to a sandwich and packed with more of the good stuff than your traditional onigiri.  I tried the crab, spicy shrimp, and unagi (eel) onigiris.  The meats themselves tasted on the lower than average quality, but by no means did I feel sick eating it, simply that they tasted frozen, and not fresh.  But this is all to keep the price of seafood relatively low, so it's acceptable.  The onigiri are shaped like triangles with sharp edges and wrapped tightly with dried seaweed, making them easy to eat without getting your hands or face filthy.  The three onigiri filled me up and for under $12, which is quite the accomplishment in San Francisco.\n\nCome a bit early as ordering has a short line, but you can wait for up to 15 minutes for your food to be prepared if there are a lot of orders before you.  \n\nOnigilly is a great alternative to those wanting an asian meal on the run.", "author": "Nadav P."}

This is a throwback to my study abroad days in Asia where you can pop into a convenience store and grab some cheap pre-made rice balls to go. \n\nOnigilly brings that same convenience to SF, while offering really fresh ingredients. I usually opt for the Edamame Set (3 rice balls + edamame + pickled veggies) for lunch. My favorite rice balls are the unagi (soft, flaky eel), spicy shrimp (bay shrimp with just a little kick), and salmon. This FiDi location is very quick and efficient, which is a slight improvement over the Kearny/Bush store. Although I usually come around 1PM, so I may just have beaten the lunch rush. \n\nThe price is slightly higher than I'd like to pay for lunch (~$9-10), but you do get a decent portion of rice and meat in these rice balls.\n\nIf you're tired of grabbing the typical sandwich/salad combo for lunch, try out Onigilly!", "author": "Bonnie Z."}

Having the wrapped rice and protein/vegetable in a nice little triangular package is fun and convenient. However, I found all three flavors I tried to be lacking something. The salmon was the most bland, but ok. The eggplant *sounded* delicious but actually turned out the worst, in my opinion . And the special bogi beef was ok - but basically afterwards, we decided hot sauce would have really helped!", "author": "Lisa K."}

He liked the other ones though!\n\nI got the chicken zosui (rice porridge), unagi (eel), and soboro (beef), for a total of $11.40. Pretty standard prices for downtown SF! The food was fresh, warm, and flavorful. The people were polite and speedy.

This was a litttlee too salty even for me (and I love my sodium). Feel like this needed another sauce / topping of some sort to come together. \n-Shiitake - mushrooms in some teriyaki type sauce. This was delicious - lots of fillings and the teriyaki wasn't too powerful. \n\nPros:\n+For $6, I got two rice balls - really good deal because they're pretty large and can fill you up (would recommend 3 if you're really hungry) \n+Got my order ~5 min after ordering\n+Lots of vegetarian options - can't wait to try more\n+They use brown rice!\n+They have this interesting mix of spices you can add to your rice balls - definitely try some for some extra kick! \n\nCons:\n-No seating", "author": "Anu P."}

I chose salmon and unagi! The salmon onigiri was a bit dry, but the unagi one was delicious. The seaweed salad was a strange color, but it still tasted good. Everything was prepared really quickly and I received my food only a few minutes after ordering. The employees were nice and asked everyone in my group how their day was going when each of us paid. The menu was easy to read and very visually appealing, although it was hard at first to figure out if the combos were actually a better price than just buying the individual rolls. I ended up getting a combo because I wanted a mix of different things, and it turned out to be just the right amount of food. Although the onigiri look small, they are pretty filling! If I came again, I would want to try some of the other rolls, but I would definitely recommend the unagi one.", "author": "Kathy C."}

Pretty decent.  Got the snow crab, the spicy bacon, and the Soboro and ate them in that order.  Snow crab was good.  Spicy bacon had more kick than I appreciate (but I know everyone has a different tolerance).

I placed my order for a snow crab, salmon, and spicy shrimp, but the music was so loud that I had to repeat myself several times.
