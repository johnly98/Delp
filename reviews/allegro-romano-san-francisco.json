You made it obvious to showed favoritism and charismatic side to other tables all around us.\n\nHow do we know this? You spent time patiently at other tables to tell them the special of the day, you smiled & joked, and you asked them how things tasted. People can    pick up on your coldness and blunt attitude even when you say \"it's whatever you want\" in a poor attempt to bury your sarcasm because we didn't follow your tasting recommendation. \n\nMy husband and I ordered, ate and left within 40 minutes of our 7 o'clock reservation. I know because I checked the time we walked out at 7:45pm and also because you reminded me multiple times that there was an 8 oclock reservation. \n\nThere's confetti and rose petals on the table, but when the owner whips around huffing & puffing to show his frustration, no amount of decor will help suck out the negative energy. We called to check if there was an opening tonight and if you felt stressed about the timing, pls DON'T accept the reservation.\n\nOur waiter was kind and treated us like guests, thank you Ernesto, you showed us true grace!

Really disappointed about this place.\n\nI came to this place about two years ago and had a really good impression on it. Today, I revisited again with my friends and we had a TERRIBLE time here. I will never come back again and I don't recommend you to come to this place if you are craving for Italian food. There are so many better Italian restaurants in the Bay Area.\n\nThe service at this place was HORRIBLE. There were only two servers: the owner of the restaurant and one staff member. When my boyfriend and I arrived at the restaurant, the owner was chatting with some guests and did not come to seat us immediately. After we were seated, besides asking what water we needed, the staff/owner did not even bother to come to our table. Maybe coz our two other friends hadn't arrived yet? Well, after everyone arrived at our table, no one came to us to tell us the daily special or take the order. We had to call the staff/owner several times before they finally unfriendly came. EXCUSE ME? When the owner was telling us the daily special, he was really fast and did not explain each daily special dish at all: \"risotto today is with truffles and the day of the fish is halibut.\" When I tried to ask him what were the sides for the fish, he said \"spinach\" indifferently. \n\nThe food came decently fast. Overall, the starters (meatballs (4.5/5), arugula salad (4/5)) and the pasta dishes (ravioli with lobster (4/5) and carbonara (4/5) were good. But the secondi, which were meat & fish were NOT GOOD AT ALL. We ordered the filet mignon. Well, when the owner was taking our order, he did not bother to how well we wanted the steak to be cooked. When the mignon showed up, it was OVER COOKED. It was so dry that I had trouble chewing. Also, the steak had a stale smell. We did not know a restaurant could make such TERRIBLE steak. It was the WORST steak I have ever had so far. \n\nTerrible terrible experience at this place.", "author": "Clare L."}

For example, we asked for bread, and the waiter snapped back \"I'll get it when I'm ready!\"\n\n2) Terrible food -- Bread was a Safeway-esque baguette, served cold obviously.... The beef was cooked well-done! What a shame, I feel bad for the cow. The meat also had a weird taste to it, almost rancid. \n\nThe only reason this isn't a 1 star review is that the restaurant is cute, and the pasta was OK (but served cold).", "author": "Victor Z."}

First of all this small neighborhood spot, nestled into a Russian Hill enclave, is easy to miss. It's marked by a beastly array of Ducati or a beautifully ( belonging to the eccentric owner Lorenzo... more on him later) antique moto from Italy. On to the food. My mother and her side of the family were Italian, so I am a tough critic when it comes to Italian food. If I had to describe it in one word it would be authentic. Our first visit... yes there have been several now... was our wedding anniversary weekend spent in the city. We were joined by great friends and it was recommended by the concierge at the Ritz-Carlton SF. Can't go wrong there.. when Uber pulled up, it's a tiny little place atop a hill in the Russian Hill neighborhood with a view of the bay bridge that is spectacular at night. Romantic and great photo op. \nI could make suggestions, but it really doesn't matter what you order, it will be lovingly prepared to perfection. You will want to moan with each bite, not kidding, because the flavor profiles with each course are thoughtfully planned and executed. \nWhat makes this place even more special is Lorenzo himself. His reputation is a hot headed bad boy, however, it's his passion that makes this place so magical. Without passion with food, it would just be sustenance. When you are this passionate about something and your heart is all in like Lorenzo's, if your toes are stepped on, or if you feel insulted, then stand back. We love him. His spirit is Allegro Romano. \nThis place has a cult following for a reason. Stern warning, you better book in advance... it's always full!", "author": "victoria b."}

I left it up to someone else to decide where to dine and that doesn't happen too often.  (However, I was secretly testing the waters to see where I will be taken.)\n\nLocated on top of Russian Hill and at a corner spot surrounded by residential homes, this restaurant may be quite modestly hidden.  Let's keep it that way because it leaves it so charming to be dining here. \n\nEntering inside from a fairly long week, the tables are topped with rose petals, which exudes the romantic ambiance of a wine and dine affair that awaits. \n\nService was splendid.  Wine was recommended by our lovely, red lipstick waitress and it complimented well with the entrees.  I insisted on ordering up a bottle to indulge for a Fri-date.  Why not?  It calms the nerves and lessens my anxious mind, which puts me at ease for a suave conversation to take place.  \n\nThey offer a tasting family menu that included 4 courses with dessert.  I'd wish I have known that so I could have tried a varietal of dishes from this intimate restaurant.  (Probably, it was a sign to return.)\n\nOur waitress informed the chef to divvy up the plates and it was nice.  They sure know how to cook up their creamy risotto.  I adored the scallops with squid ink risotto in aged balsamic bell pepper bisque as a starter.  Their dover sole fish in caper sauce with black olive risotto was solid and on point.  I loved the lobster ravioli with pink vodka sauce.  It was superbly fresh and every bite of that was accounted for.  \n\nIt was about sunset when the dining was over and there was still daylight.  If you step right outside, the view of the city with the Transamerica building at the central point, is at a bird's eye.  \n\nThere's nothing like an admirable city view in sunset colors with pleasant dining to end a healthy day.  \n\nI had a lovely time here and this restaurant surely caught me off guard on how pleasant it was to be!  \n\nThe best things are unexpected because there were no expectations.

We were promptly seated even though we did not have a reservation. We split a bottle wine (Chianti). A friend of mine and I each got the \"Sea Urchin Pasta ala Carbonara\" and both plates were clean when the picked them up. After eating all of our meals both reached for the bread to finish the sauces left. Absolutely amazing! My girlfriend had the \"Tortelloni filled with White Truffle Burrata- Taleggio cheese al Pesto\". She also loved her meal and my little taste, I'd have to agree. \n\nThe service was great as we had Lorenzo as our host and server. Lorenzo has pictures of himself with spots stars and celebrities that have eaten there on one of the walls. He had a very unique outfit on in every picture but that just added to the ambience of Allegro Romano. He even dropped off a rose for the women at tables when the check was brought out. He was great and I have already started recommending to Bay Area friends to go for a nice little Nob Hill Italian experience.  \n\nLorenzo mentioned that they were catering a wedding the following day and I think I can speak for all of us in that we wish we had been invited to said wedding just for the food. \n\nWould 100% recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice Italian date spot in the Nob Hill area of San Francisco.", "author": "Rob P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-10-01", "description": "This place has really changed over the years. My husband and I have been going to Allegro Ramano for over thirteen years. We would take friends and family for dinner, celebrate special occasions, and highly recommend it to everyone. We didn't go here because of the food, because to be honest it was just OK. We dined here because of the AMAZING wait staff and ambiance of the restaurant. When the servers, Eric and Oscar, left a few years ago to work at other restaurants things started to change. However, we still would come for the tradition of always celebrating our anniversary.\nMy husband and I arrived in good spirits and excited to celebrate our anniversary. We were seated at the table near the door, which was a frequent stop for diners who wanted to admire the photos of celebrities from years ago. In fact, a couple stopped and asked us to move so she take a picture of Bono because she was from Ireland. Not a big deal, we enjoyed chatting with her and she inquired what she should order and do we like the restaurant. As always, we were very complimentary.\nA older man was seated next to us and was waiting for his son to arrive. When his son arrived, he got up to welcome him, but bumped the table to the left of him and ended up knocking over the carafe of wine. Some wine spilled, but it wasn't much.\nLorenzo, the owner, came over and quickly moved the patron from the table that the wine had spilled. Lorenzo seemed very annoyed and the older man felt really bad. In the older man's defense, there wasn't much room between the tables making it difficult for anyone to squeeze by. A few minutes later, the older gentleman and son were moved to the corner to make room for a party of four. \nThe party of four were seated next to us and within three minutes, they all got up and left. On their way out, I said to the younger woman, \"This place is amazing.\" She informed me that they were leaving because her in laws were NOT happy there wasn't hard liquor. The waitress, Adrianna, came rushing towards the door and looked at me with a puzzled look of why they would be leaving. I told her they wanted liquor. Seconds later, Lorenzo still looking pissed from the wine spill quickly ran out the door to catch them. When they both came back in Lorenzo was beyond furious and Adrianna looked beside herself.\nRight after this is when our experience went quickly down hill.\nOur food came and we weren't offered any cheese like in all past experiences. Not once did anyone stop by to see if we wanted anything else. Adrianna and Lorenzo didn't make eye contact with us and quickly whizzed by our table. \nSince my order was missing the protein I ordered, I was still hungry so I decided to order another plate of pasta. We had to flag her down as she was running by our table. In passing, we asked to get another order of pasta. When they finally dropped off the pasta, we had to ask for another glass of wine. \nAs mentioned earlier, the one reason we continued to go to this place was for the service. The service we were receiving was not normal. We realized that Lorenzo and the staff were taking out their anger and frustration on us for the wine spill and the four top leaving... EVEN THOUGH IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH US.\nThe pesto pasta was bland and one of the plates had a hard stub of asparagus in it. The snapper was over cooked and lacked flavor. When we finished our less than par meal, Adrianna slammed down the bill and began to walk off.  I commented we we're going to get dessert. She rolled her eyes and huffed and proceeded to rattle off the desserts. I was shocked by her blunt rudeness. I told her nevermind, we will go somewhere else. \n\nI tried to catch Lorenzo several times to apologize for saying his restaurant was amazing to the people who left and inform him that we wouldn't be back, but he ignored me and proceeded to stop at all of the other tables, but ours. \nAt one point, I tried to catch him by the restroom, but he was too busy yelling at his staff for something.\nShortly after leaving, my husband didn't feel well and hurried home to the toilet.\nAfter looking at the reviews on Yelp it appears many people have been treated this way by Lorenzo and his staff on multiple occasions. It is quite disappointing. The good news is that there are thousands of OUTSTANDING restaurants in the city that are better than Allegro and would love to provide top notch service to patrons. We will not be back, but will definitely have a story to tell about getting food poisoning and the lack of customer service that we received on our anniversary. Thanks Lorenzo for showing us your true colors after all these years.\nCiao!", "author": "Stella K."}

This is our 2nd time here and it was just as fun and unique as the 1st. \n\nIf you can, sit at the front table by the window. And be prepared to spend a couple hours here, because, in true Italian fashion, you are invited to stay all night if you really want.\n\nDespite the elegant ambiance, the Italian-born owner, Lorenzo, can be seen walking around in his tie-dye shirt amongst his dress-shirt-and-slacks-wearing staff. At any other restaurant, he would be considered crazy, but his eccentricity helps make this place memorable.\n\nIt's hard to find parking on the street, so Lorenzo helped my dad find a spot in his own personal driveway. Later on, when my dad ordered a glass of tawny port, Lorenzo came over and took a sip out of my dad's glass, saying that, he too, wanted a glass. He came back with a bottle, opened it, poured himself a glass and then topped off my dad's. If a waiter at Applebee's started drinking out of your soda cup, you'd probably be concerned, but not with Lorenzo. \n\nAs for the food, it's the best Italian I've ever had. We ordered three appetizers: the Roasted Beets Caprese ($12), the San Daniele Prosciutto ($17), and Tortelloni ($22). The latter two were my absolute favorites. I couldn't stop dipping my bread in the arugula pesto sauce that tops the Tortelloni.\n\nFor my meal, I got the Petto di Pollo ($22), which was fantastic. Every bite of chicken was superb with the orange-marsala sauce.\n\nMy fiancee got the Gnocchi ($22), which featured part 2 of my bread-dipping fiesta. This was probably my favorite dish. The garlic was perfectly proportioned in the old Madeira sauce. \n\nFor dessert, we got organic strawberries with chocolate sauce, along with the Tiramisu--which was terrific. They also gave us complimentary biscotti and watermelon. Oh, and I can't forget the endless dessert Ruby Port on the house!! They literally just keep pouring it if you want.\n\nUpon leaving, the three servers who were assigned to our table, plus Lorenzo, came out to hug us all goodbye.\n\nIf you want to go out for a REALLY nice meal without breaking the bank, I suggest heading here. While it's not cheap, you and your date could probably leave here under $80 (more if you drink alcohol). \n\nThe funny thing is, as amazing as the food tastes, it's not even what you remember here.

Between the three of us, we shared the heirloom tomato salad, asparagus, rigatoni with oxtail, fettucini with Bolognese sauce, and the sole.  I thought everything tasted decent but nothing was very memorable that would set them apart from any other Italian restaurant in the city.  Then we ended with a chocolate gelato which was my favorite part of the meal, it was encased in a chocolate crust with chocolate power on top.  \nI did think the service was great with our bread basket being refilled without us asking, water and wine glasses always being refilled, and a free biscotti dessert and port at the end.  \nI'd recommend the restaurant for someone who lives or is staying in the area that is looking for something very nearby.", "author": "Gloria N."}

We came here on a Saturday and it was not overly crowded. The owner let us pick our table and we chose the table with the most roses, which was nice. The menu was a little bit more expensive than I saw on their website and also had a few fewer options. Also, I wasn't a huge fan of the iPad wine list, seemed a little bit unauthentic for an Italian restaurant. \n\nThe food was very tasty and I liked the brought us a small dessert and glass of dessert wine on the house. Definitely not quite as good as an Italian restaurant in Italy, but one of the better Italian spots in the russian hill neighborhood.", "author": "Scoot S."}

We parked at a parking garage outside of North Beach and hiked up the stairs en route to this place. Took photos along the way. When we arrived to the cozy and quaint neighborhood restaurant, Lorenzo and staff treated us to a dining experience born from love. The best food is all about the love that goes into it. No shortage of love here. The bruschetta was delectable, as were the asparagus and thinly sliced angus beef appetizer. \n\nThe basil arugula pesto tortellini was so tasty, and I sampled my son's sea bass and that too was excellent. What I also loved was the Lorenzo's wine pairing recommendation. It was nice for a change to not have to decide- we just let Lorenzo decide for us. The chosen Chianti with my pesto was fantastic, and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the Sangiovese with her Lobster Ravioli.  Wrapped up with cheesecake, tiramisu, biscotti, and some port wine.

With the closing of the old-time Italian institutions (Little Joe's and recently Caesar's), my search for a new go-to spot ended when I dined here.  Arriving early for a 6 pm reservation, we scored a parking spot a half block away and witnessed the craziness of the parking situation in this neighborhood.  As we were seated, the staff told us about their nightly pre-dinner entertainment on the Nob Hill streets.  We chose a table near the hallway as the tables are packed pretty tightly here.  After reading the specials, our waiter promptly took our orders and gave us recommendations.  Here is what we ate:\n\nAppetizer (shared)\n1) Mushroom Trifolati (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5yY41syV-6KwSi-sfmv7CA?select=zNY6fHDD8P8oaepeUJAHjA#Q5uNwbshlJ72NaBMrt7zXg) - Sauteed Chanterelle mushrooms over sauteed baby spinach with garlic chips.

It was a good mix of young couples and family/friends groups, many obviously local regulars.  The food was excellent, service efficient, comforting, and playful, and ambiance very relaxed.

Located at a nice cozy place in SF, it took a while for us to find parking, but we did make it in time for our reservation. The server was nice and seated us. I loved how there were real rose petals on the tables and the atmosphere around us was very romantic. Later when we were ready to order, I believe the owner came and took our orders. Afraid to mispronounce some of the names of the dishes, we simply pointed to them, but while taking our orders, he would simply frown and raise his voice to repeat them. This didn't seem to be an issue because maybe we were too quiet. However, this did become a problem later on. \nAs the dishes came, we were excited about the food and most of us liked what we ordered. We finished in about half an hour and was ready to pay to go back to our hotel. When we asked for the checks, we wanted it split, which is apparently abnormal for a party of friends. The owner rushed out and loudly (rudely) asked what we wanted! After replying we wanted it split, he rushed back in and didn't respond to our request. Ok... was it that difficult to split the check or was that not a thing that parties may ask for? \nWhen we left, no one say goodbye or anything. I also did note that the tables before us that left, the owner walked them to the door and gave the ladies flowers.

All 3 of us agreed that this was the star of the whole dinner. The dish as a whole had so much depth of flavor. I'd definitely come back just for that. \n\nAs for entrees:\nHomemade lobster ravioli with tomato vodka pink sauce - 3.5/5 stars\n\nSea urchin pasta ala carbonara: 3.5/5 stars\n\nGnocchi with foie gras & black truffles: 3.5/5 stars \n\nAll of our pastas were creamy, relatively on the heavier side. We all thought that the pastas were ok. Not sure how to describe it, but I think it was because we were so blown away by the scallops/risotto appetizer, our standards were probably a little too high after that. \n\nWhat makes Allegro Romano 5 stars is their attentiveness and how kind/giving they are!

Allegro Romano epitomizes this feeling.     \n\nBorn and raised in the city, it never ceases to amaze me the amount of undiscovered gems there are. Words cannot even begin to describe how I feel about Allegro Romano, a neighborhood gem that's tucked away in one of San Francisco's seven hills. \n\nWith 75-80% of its customers from neighboring hotels like the Fairmont, InterContinental, and the Ritz, Allegro Romano is where numerous celebrities including Conan O'Brien, Brad Pitt, Demi Moore (when carbs was still her BFF), and my favorite president Bill Clinton have seek refuge for a quaint dinner away from the paparazzi and the nosy public. It's also frequented by Willie Brown, Gavin Newsom, and Gary Danko whose favorite dishes are the Fettuccine with White Truffle Sauce and the New York Strip Steak.\n\nComing from a bloodline of a Roman restaurateur, chef/owner Lorenzo Logoreci creates and flawlessly executes rustic Italian dishes full of deep complex flavors and with finesse at affordable prices.

Fresh. Simple. Satisfying. \n\n*RIGATONI w/ Foie Gras, Black Truffles & Old Madera Wine (half order - $9) \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5yY41syV-6KwSi-sfmv7CA?select=EVUNsI38bJROQj4OomQDug\nSuggested by our waiter, I got a half order of this dish which was a perfect precursor to my entree. \n\nThe deliciously creamy foie gras, black truffle, and sweet Mandera wine sauce caressed every single ridge of the al-dente rigatoni making each morsel insanely decadent. Though there was no visible foie gras, the familiar luxurious richness was prominent with the earthiness of the black truffles taking it to the top. \n\n*FILETTO ai Porcini & Barolo Sauce ($25.50) \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5yY41syV-6KwSi-sfmv7CA?select=f8LhvSY7xOPIwbvmCCnTGQ\nThe filet mignon was seared to a rare as requested with a vibrant red center. Unlike most filets I've had, Allegro Romano's filet was so soft that it cut like butter; it was even softer than some wagyu steaks I've had.\n\nThe porcini and Barolo wine sauce was ridiculously good, robust, and packed with an intense earthiness that gave a sinfully savoryness with a tinge of sweetness to the filet. \n\n*COMPLIMENTARY DESSERT: House-made Almond Biscotti \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5yY41syV-6KwSi-sfmv7CA?select=TpDbovCx3sqhU6wWcTR8_Q\nThoroughly stuffed (I could only eat half my filet), we opted out of dessert but we're still given a small bite to appease our sweet tooth. The biscotto was unlike others I've had; it was like eating a nutty cookie with a rich crumbly texture. \n\nS E R V I C E\nCharming, attentive, and down-to-earth. If you don't like attention or being waited on hand and foot (*raises hand*)...honey, you better learn to like it before coming to Allegro Romano. Our waiters were constantly checking up on us trying to ensure we were enjoying our meal. I felt uneasy at first but soon realized as other diners started coming in that making you feel like you're the \"guest of honor\" is the Allegro Romano's way of customer service. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nAllegro Romano screams ROMANTIC DATE NIGHT! Are you listening fellas? When a woman says she doesn't like the clich\u00e9 dozen roses and a nice, fancy dinner. LIES. ALL LIES. Women say one thing but it REALLY means another; for example, when a woman says, \"No, pizza is fine honey\", what she really means is \"F*cking, cheap bastard\". GET IT?\n\nIf you want to WOOOOO that special lady in your life, Allegro Romano is the perfect place to enjoy an intimate, romantic dinner complete with dim lighting, candles, red rose petals scattered atop crisp white linen tables and views of the illuminated bay bridge. \n\nP A R K I N G\nVery difficult street parking.

He was very proud of his restaurant and knew that it was a popular place to dine, if you know what I'm saying. \n\nNow to the important part; the food. There was a bread basket and butter which was expected. We ordered bruschetta which you order in pairs but our waiter brought us 5 pieces without us asking. The dinner was excellent and rich. The menu was limited but overall a good selection. The desert was odd because there was a delicious sounding cake but it turned out it was only moose, which was still good but misleading.

Often a hangout by locals (even though it's close to the touristy North Beach), this quaint bistro on the corner of a residential tree-lined street on the top of the hill is a gem.  Proprietor Lorenzo is a charming and funny host.  The staff is impeccable and always trying to foresee what you may want before you ask for it.  And, like a true Italian restaurant, you aren't rushed but are allowed to enjoy your dinner at leisure...but without having to trade prompt service.  You can order off the menu or do what we sometimes do, which is ask Lorenzo to \"Feed Me!\" and he will bring out approximately 7-10 of the best items on the menu.  If you are there when Lorenzo cranks up the volume on \"That's Amore!\" and gets the entire restaurant to sing it, then you are in for a treat.  Speaking of treats...there are rose petals on each table and often ladies will get a beautiful rose bud to take home with them at the end of the evening.  Parking is difficult here as there are no nearby garages and street parking is at a premium (as this is a well established residential neighborhood), but take ground transport or catch a cab...this is well worth trekking to.", "author": "Mitzi A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-27", "description": "I have been using Yelp for a number of years now, without posting any reviews. Today I break the dry spell for Allegro Romano:\n\nI'd first seen this spot while driving by one day and immediately added it to one of my must try spots as I'm always looking for authentic Italian in San Francisco. On a whim last night, I visited their website around 2PM looking for a reservation that evening and was booked for a table for two at 8PM. Note: I attempted to call three times around 7 to try and bump the reservation up half an hour, but my calls were not answered. Stick to online reservations for this spot. \n\nWhen we arrived we were immediately seated at a nice table. While the dining room is small, it was relatively full for a Wednesday night, a good sign to me. The waiters immediately brought out bread and water and menus. We started with the Bruschetta and Prosciutto & Fresh Burrata, served with honey and oil. The Bruschetta was fresh and had a strong basil flavor, and the toast it was served on was the perfect texture for cutting (not rock hard!). The second starter was nice as well, even I enjoyed the combination of the four ingredients and I typically do not like Burrata cheese. \n\nOur primi course included the Risotto with shaved Truffles and the Rigatoni al' Arb\u00ebria. The Risotto was creamy, cheesy, and sitting in a savory broth that I have never experienced before with Risotto. The cherry on top was the heaping dose of freshly shaved truffle on top, which they perform at the table. If you are a truffle lover this is the dish for you. Next the Rigatoni came out, which they kindly plated on two clean, warmed plates for my Dad and I. This dish included braised oxtail in a cream sauce. The menu advertised it with porchini mushrooms but all we found were carrots. The oxtail was cooked perfectly though and I think this dish was perfect for those looking for a hearty dish.\n\nLastly, we ordered the Scaloppini with Porcini Mushrooms. By now, I was pretty full, so I'd like to give this one another try when I'm not so completely stuffed. Again, the waiter brought out two plates for us, already split in the kitchen. The Scaloppini was tender and came with a rich sauce that was perfect when mixed with the mashed potatoes and greens that also came with the dish. \n\nOverall the food was very nice, but the service is what will make me recommend this to others and return myself. During the course of our meal I believe we had four different waiters and servers doting on us. Lorenzo, the host was also in on the action engaging in our questions about the ingredients and their origin throughout Italy. They pay great attention to requests in delivery of the courses, making sure to leave time between each course so all your plates don't end up on the table at once. Even after declining desert, they still delivered a plate of fresh watermelon and biscotti to the table for us to enjoy on the house. \n\nCome to Allegro Romano for good food, great service, and an authentic Italian experience.", "author": "Alex R."}

The reservation process itself was a nightmare- we called the restaurant where  the owner answered and after perfunctory responses actually hung up on us once saying something like \"we have a party that evening so no reservations\". We just thought to check on open-table in any case and lo-and-behold our requested time and date was very much available. We booked anyway thinking maybe there as some miscommunication over the phone.\n\nWe noticed that there were indeed 3 tables booked with larger groups of 4-6 people for celebration dinners of different occasions, but there were also 3 other tables including ours where couples were seated just regularly there to enjoy a meal.\n\nMy main gripes with this establishment:\n\n- We received little or no attention throughout the evening. In fact our server was more interested in serving the other \"big ticket\" tables. We had to remind our server to give us some bread after 20 mins of waiting for anything to eat. This is basic courtesy.\n\n- We were seated in the back corner and it was as if we were NOT THERE. Seriously. The owner actually went and checked with all other people on all the tables except ours (especially those with larger business)! \n- the FOOD was just ok. Anyone who's dined at high quality Italian restaurants should not be simply floored with truffles being served on a pasta. I can only venture a guess that the quality of the truffles used in this case was quite poor, as it didn't really add any aroma to the dish. Honestly, I was really disappointed as I am crazy about truffles and was looking forward to this dish all week. We drove all the way from east Bay for this - so you can imagine how we felt. And at $40 a plate I certainly expected more. My husbands sea urchin pasta was in great sauce but the pasta itself was way to al dente (as was mine).\n\nIt was a memorable meal for the wrong reasons. The reluctant service along with the average food and unworthy prices made this a flop in my books.", "author": "Yelper 2."}

I thought I had found a solid restaurant, located conveniently near us, that my wife and I could visit on a weekly basis.\n\nUnfortunately, the following 3 times I tried to go to the restaurant, the experience was miserable.  I found that the common theme for each negative experience was due to the fact that Lorenzo, the owner that so many of these reviews talk about, was greeting us at the door.  I'm not sure how to describe the experience.... but heck, let's give it a shot.  The owner was pretentious, pompous, arrogant, rude, unfriendly, unwelcoming, disrespectful, irresponsible, inflexible, and is 100% responsible for turning off what could have been a weekly, regular customer.\n\nThe other reviews here state it pretty clearly, but don't even attempt to make a reservation over the phone.

The food, the wine and port, the service, the atmosphere, and the gorgeous views of the East Bay from the street all made for a great experience.\n\nI ordered the lobster ravioli, and it was delicious.  There were some good chunks of lobster in it. My husband ordered the filet and loved it.  It was cooked exactly as he ordered it, and it was very tender and juicy.  The potatoes on the side were very tasty, too.  Another thing I really liked was that they brought out a decanter for the bottle of wine we ordered.  There's not many restaurants that do that, and it's a nice touch.\n\nSomething that we really liked, which some other people might not, is that they really took their time and let us enjoy every course of our meal.  Nothing was rushed.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that we were there for almost 2 hours.  The waitstaff was very attentive the entire time, so we never felt that we were being neglected.  I've read some of the other reviews that said they were being ignored, but we never felt that way.  They were letting us take our time and enjoy everything.  Now granted, we went on a Wednesday night and it was not crowded, so the slower pace might not happen every time.  We'll just have to go back and see. \n\nThank you, Lorenzo, for a truly great experience, and for the beautiful red rose I was given on the way out.

We had to drive like 5 miles down in a parking garage where it was like 15 all night.  Then we had to walk 10-15 minutes to the restaurant, with huge hills because there was no taxi around! By the time we got to the restaurant, we were tired and said \"this better be worth it.\" \n\nBut the atmosphere of the restaurant was romantic.  Servers in uniform and were all very hospitable, dimly lit place, candle light dinners with rose pedals on each table.  It was a small, but charming.  We were also impressed by all the celebrities that have been to Allegro before, such as Bob Saget, Brat Pitt, Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, and much more. Thought, \"hey, this place has to be good.

I remembered seeing a few Italian spots in the neighborhood, so I got out my trusty Yelp app, searched & found Allegro Romano.  I chose it, because it's only a few blocks away from my apartment :D\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant without reservations (apparently, most people make reservations, so note to self: make reservations next time), but they managed to squeeze us in within a few minutes.

So perfect for those on a first date, or any date.\n\nI would actually give the food 4 stars, but 6 stars for the service, so they get a nice round 5 stars from me.\n\nWe started the meal off with bruschetta, which was delicious, but the garlic was a bit strong.  I prefer the bruschetta at Il Borgo, where the bread is toastier, with bigger chunks of tomato & basil.  We also ordered the beef carpaccio, which is \"Kobe Style Black Angus thinly sliced w/shaved aged Parmesan cheese, arugula & truffle oil.\"  I thought it was good, but I think the cheese was too strong for my taste. Maybe too aged?\n\nFor the entrees, both my BF & I decided to get pasta dishes, since we're both truffle fiends. I got the rigatoni with black truffles & madera wine, topped with caviar. My BF ordered the fettuccine with white truffle sauce.  Both were delicious, but I liked my dish more.  I found the fettuccine cooked a little too al dente, too chewy for my liking.  The rigatoni was perfect, however.  I am looking forward to my leftovers.\n\nAnd since my bf & I couldn't decide on a dessert to share, we both ordered our own: I got the tiramisu & he got the espresso mousse.

After dessert, they brought us a couple of glasses of port wine (& they topped off the wine a second time)\n\nThe staff here is fantastic! They made our experience so enjoyable.

The rigatoni all'amatricana was very tasty as well with the right amount of cheese mixed with the light tomato sauce and finely diced pancetta.  We can see why this pasta dish is Willie Brown's favorite dish!  We also appreciated that they split our full order onto two plates for us to share.

With limited seating and with just TOO MANY show-off photos of celebrities visiting the place, the place was just INELEGANT. (So you want to impress your company? Look for other countless amazing Italian places around the city, as you'll almost never run out of options for that.) \n\nBut this lack of extraordinariness is bearable. It was when they COMPLETELY IGNORED and DISRESPECTED my time that I was done with.  I called the restaurant to set up a time to go pick up before they opened. They told me to come at 10am. So from Berkeley, I ran out of my place at 8am to be there on time. I started waiting 9:50am and then until 11:00am, NOT EVEN A FLY showed up. Did I get any alert at all? \n\nWas that even a legitimate excuse? ABSOLUTELY NOT. With ZERO ownership of the customer experience/relationship of the business, they did NOT seem to know how to respect regular customers who were NOT CELEBRITIES.", "author": "Jen K."}

Walked up the Broadway steps and in to the empty restaurant w/out a reservation. Lorenzo, the owner sat at the window table on his cellphone, a waiter stood around-- I asked if they could seat me for an early dinner out of the way and headed toward a table near the kitchen door---Lorenzo jumped up and showed me to the table, waiter hung around too. \n\nTable settings were lovely and adorned with fresh rose petals and glitter. Went with one of the specials and something not done at home, the Osso Bucco and a glass of the Chianti. Lorenzo went back to his window table and cellphone. The waiter and busboy paced the restaurant floor---it was early, just after 5p, pacing was distracting. I occasionally chatted with the waiter. Lorenzo left for awhile, (maybe he went down the hill to his new place ala  Romana). The waiter brought a small plate with one appetizer bite of bruschetta to enjoy with my wine.\n\nThe Osso Bucco flavors were delicious and presentation lovely. Ate as much as could, take the rest home. An older couple came in, they sat them next to me. Lorenzo was back and took care in seating them. Several women came in a bit later, he took care of them and appeared to give instructions to the waiter. \n\nIn the meantime, I ordered a Cappucino and drank my wine, which was delicious. The waiter brought me a special biscotti with a dollop of ricotta and fresh strawberry to accompany my coffee--- which arrived tepid rather than hot. Again, the presentation was beautiful, the plate dusted with a cinnamon or nutmeg powder and sparkling. Simple and elegant.\n\nAt one point, Lorenzo must have asked what I had as heard the waiter tell him Osso Bucco, I could not hear Lorenzo's response. Before finishing, the waiter sat the bill on the table corner, I finished my biscotti, the busboy asked about the Cappucino and offered to make another,I declined, paid my bill. On the way out, I motioned to the waiter who followed me towards the door and quietly told him about the Cappucino, maybe the machine was not hot enough. \n\nI can imagine eating here in the evening with candles lit and tables sparkling. I'd love to try another dish or two. Yet, would I bring a friend or two or three rather than dine alone again?Am not sure at all. Never once did Lorenzo smile or appear genuinely welcoming of any patrons to his lovely restaurant on the top of a very lovely hill on a beautiful sunny San Francisco day.", "author": "Nancy D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-02-15", "description": "We had been to this restaurant on Valentine's Day a few years ago.  My husband had remembered that experience as a great evening, and their unique tradition of offering red roses to ladies on their way out was a nice touch. So he thought he might call and check for a reservation a few days ago.  He left a message and later called again, and a female confirmed our reservation.  \n\nSo when we got there from Napa last night, the owner came out to rudely tell us that we had no reservation, and questioned my husband on whom he had talked to and when and let us know there was nothing he could do for us as it was Valentine's Day and they were booked.  The reason for the crappy review is that he was just plain rude and completely unhelpful.  \n\nMy husband is not a fan of conflict so we walked out after being basically kicked out.  As we were walking to the parking lot where we had left our car, we spotted another cute dim-lit Italian restaurant only a couple of blocks down that had a surprisingly similar name: Ala Romana.  They let us know that they were booked but had an opening as there had just been a cancellation.  The menu looked great, and the ambiance was nice, so we decided to stay.\n\nLong story short, we realized my husband had probably confused the name and called Ala Romana to confirm a reservation instead of Allegro Romano.  After we were seated and enjoying our meal, low and behold, the owner of Allegro Romano walks in and starts acting like he owns the place.  Our server let us now that he in fact does!  So the success at Allegro Romano translated into the opening of a satellite venue a few minutes away.  \n\nWhy wouldn't you offer to check if they had a table that could accommodate us?  Or at least let us know about it?  Because you don't care and you'd rather not deal with an issue even if it night be an opportunity.  Instead, you prefer to assume we lied about having a reservation, or at least acted that way.  I will not be back to Allegro Romano because your attitude is not reflective of a welcoming host, your space is incredibly tight, there is no privacy, nothing spectacular about the cuisine as far as I remember.   The roses are a beautiful touch, but my husband brings home the perfect bouquet without needing your services.  \n\nDON'T YOU KNOW THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT? Long term, your attitude will implode your business.  Good luck with that.", "author": "Mlle V."}

I've actually asked the owner himself about this--he just laughs it off. Why?? Because this restaurant is probably the best Italian restaurant in San Francisco. Period. \n\nIf you really want to try this place--show up a bit early--like 5:30 or 6. If you have 2-4 people, there will probably be tables open because the place is off of the beaten path. \n\nEvery single time that my girlfriend and I have been here, it's been one of those experiences that we can't stop talking about on the way home. The ambiance couldn't be any more romantic: classic Italian opera music plays in the background, rose petals line each table, and the owner speaks to his staff in Italian. The service that goes along with it? The best we've ever experienced. Every waiter is so knowledgeable about each dish they could write a book about it. Your drinking water never gets past the halfway point. As soon as your wine is a few sips from being gone, you're asked if you want another. To end the dinner, you're given a complimentary glass of port and biscotti cookies, and, if you're with a girl, they give her a red rose on the way out. \n\nThe quality of the food just tops it all off. We've ordered the prosciutto with melon as an appetizer, the squid ink risotto, the lobster ravioli, the pasta carbonara, and other dishes. No matter what, you really can't go wrong with any dish that you order here. Just try what you think looks good and go with it!\n\nOh, and one more thing: It's not that expensive either! A dinner for 2 people comes to about $90-$100. \n\nIf you can get past the nonexistent reservation system, this is truly one of the best dining experiences in SF.", "author": "Jeff S."}

It's romantic and provides an intimate atmosphere for a lovely dining experience. My boyfriend and I came for dinner and didn't have a reservation, but they were able to accommodate us anyways.\n\nThe service here is superb. Our waters were never lower than halfway and they constantly replaced our bread and dipping sauce. Even though we barely used our sauce each time, I think it must have gotten replaced ~7 times throughout the meal! Talk about taking care of their customers.\n\nMushroom Trifolati: This was a bit disappointing for us. It wasn't anything special and seemed like a dish we could cook ourselves at home. \n\nBeef Carpaccio alla Romana: One of the best beef carpaccios I have had. It had shaved Parmesan cheese on it with fresh arugula and truffle oil. The thinly sliced Kobe Style Black Angus Beef was really tender and exploded with flavor. I HIGHLY recommend this appetizer!\n\nBlack Truffle Risotto: This was a special that night. Since I never had risotto before, I decided to order it and I am SO GLAD that I did. It was creamy and aromatic. When it was brought to our table, Lorenzo (owner) came over and shaved us a generous helping of fresh truffle. Mmm. They should really put this on their regular menu.\n\nChillean Sea Bass: This was another special that night, and it came with mashed potatoes and spinach (the same spinach that was in the mushroom trifolati). The fish was cooked perfectly and was served with a lemon caper sauce. The sea bass literally melted in your mouth and retained its moisture well.\n\nComplimentary Housemade Biscotti: This came with strawberries and cream. Nothing to complain about since they were free.\n\nAt the end of the meal, they gave me a red rose. Nice touch Allegro Romano. Very nice touch.", "author": "Ava S."}

I was so looking forward to this place having had it bookmarked for months but the mediocre food and shoddy service was a complete letdown.\n\nOn Food:\n- Caesar Salad was advertised with Fresh Dungeness Crab. The crab was fishy and had that slightly tinny taste that said it was pre-packaged.\n- White Truffle Tortellini in white truffle pesto sauce - pesto masked a lot of the truffle flavor. Dish felt heavy and didn't taste special. (Took some home to reheat and the grease soaked through the take out container and made a mess in the microwave)\n- Linguini with sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and halibut. This was clearly the tastiest dish of the night. There was still a little over-reliance on oil, and the fish didn't taste super fresh\n- Biscotti with watermelon - Good biscotti with a nice licorice flavor\n\nOn Service - we had already been to a whiskey tasting before arriving at dinner and so were in no mood to drink. After declining to order alcohol, it seemed that service went downhill from there:\n- We had to ask the server for the specials of the day. Half of what he said made no sense and after overhearing specials being presented to another table, realized he left a couple things off\n- Sat around for a while waiting for someone to take our order, made eye contact with a couple of the waiters, tried to wave them down and instead saw them tell each other to come take our order.\n- Ask for an opinion on the three different pastas that listed truffles as ingredients and basically got a response along the lines of \"well, there's the pasta with truffle cream sauce or you can get the tortellini that is filled pasta with a paste in a sauce\". Thank you sir, I think I can read. \n- No idea why, but had a hard time flagging someone down for check and to-go box in this tiny 32 seat restaurant.

We reminded them about the prosciutto, our fourth appetizer, and the waiter claimed we did not order it. What?! The three of us heard it ordered. He should have said, \"Oh I'll get it for you right away..\"\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and he ID'ed all three of us. We are all in our 30's, but fine. The weird part was then he took all three of our drivers licenses away and into the back.. to do I don't know what. He never gave a reason either..\nWhile we were enjoying our bottle of wine, at 9:58p, he came by and told us \"I am not allowed to serve alcohol past 10p, you have to finish it before then.\" What?? First, I've never heard of this before. Second, why did you not tell us earlier?\nWhen we were done with our drinks, he took them outside and poured - ie, littered - the drinks outside (not just water!). \nThe atmosphere is as weird as can be. They must have dimmed the lights 5 different times just over the course of our dinner. They also played music that was skipping, like a scratched CD would do.\nThe bill he gave us was well over the price of the food we ordered. **CHECK YOUR BILL** because I bet he will overcharge others too. When we were actually doing the math, he then accused us of NOT wanting to pay - huh? Of course we want to pay, we just don't want to pay for things we did not order. He then accused us of not remembering what we ordered - what?? And then we asked him what the price of the desserts were and he told us $8, and then as we were going through the bill, he said they were each $9.\nWe ordered the mousse for dessert, and instead we were served cake. We clarified, and they said, \"This is the mousse.\" (I've now seen the same thing has happened to other Yelpers.)\nI think the waiter/owner is on DRUGS. \nWhen we were leaving the restaurant, we didn't hear what the waiter/owner said to us on the way out, but we *think* he said \"Enjoy McDonald's.\" What!?!\nDO NOT GO HERE.

The waitstaff is superb, the owner is magnificent, and everyone there is just happy to be doing what they're doing. \n\nAs far as the food goes, the white truffle fettuccine is exquisite. It's quite heavy, so be prepared for that. The bruschetta is refreshing and flavorful, really something else. The veal was a bit less impressive. Nothing was wrong with it, but I've had better elsewhere and there are definitely better options on the menu. Be sure to save room for dessert. The tiramisu is the perfect consistency and a great way to wrap up a great meal.", "author": "Victoria W."}

Strategically tucked away from the tourists and the endless amount of mainstay restaurants in San Francisco, I made reservations for Allegro Romano knowing that this would be more of an intimate, romantic setting without all the \"hustle and bustle\" you would encounter while dining at a 75/100-seat restaurant.\n\nOur server was very courteous and attentive and had a warming demeanor that made you feel as if you were right at home. I started the night off with the Soup of the day. Unfortunately I can not remember exactly what it was other than the fact that it was delicious. As for my entree I was in debate over the Fettuccine with white Truffle sauce (flown in from Piedmont Italy) or the Homemade Lobster Ravioli in Vodka Pink Sauce. I opted for The Lobster Ravioli. Fresh Lobster stuffed in Ravioli with Vodka Pink Sauce was superb. While enjoying dinner and wine with great company I had a chance to converse with the owner who was quite pleasant and inviting. As we were getting ready to leave the restaurant after a fantastic dinner the owner (Lorenzo) gives a long stem red rose to my girlfriend as a parting thank you gift which I thought was very cool. \n\nIn conclusion, if you would like to dine at a classy, romantic local neighborhood Italian restaurant in San Francisco then dine at Allegro Romano. The food is fantastic owner and staff treat you like royalty and you never know when you could be sitting across from one of the many celebrities that frequent Allegro Romano.  You will not be disappointed.

While we were waiting, other couplers arrived. be aware, there might be a stench of cheese when you 1st walk in. We talked about it with people that just walked out and they couldn't smell it. We all decided it was the black truffle that we must be smelling. Once we sat down, we could no longer smell it so don't let this influence your deision on going. And everyone that walked out said how delicious their meal was. Once seated the experience started. There was red roses sprinkled on every table. Our waiters were very cultured, very italian. Our waiter told us the specials right away. They presented the wine perfectly, let us taste it and served. BTW we didn't know it is BYOB. They service wine as well. Our appetizers arrived within 5 minutes. Bruschetta and spring salads were delicious.Our entrees were lobster ravioli for me and every bite was perfection. The sauce wasn't too much, it was absolutely perfect. My boyfriend got the Linguini al Aglio, with halibut. Sauce was perfect, a little spicey. Every bite of the fish was to die for. \n\nLastly we got the tiramisu. Now we have been in search of the perfect tiramisu all over NYC, and my boyfriend thinks we found it here. every bite was AGAIN, perfect.

I got a call back within a couple hours to reserve a table. I suppose things would have been fine if I didn't need to change the reservation time.  I called back the same night and left a message to see if I could move the reservation to an earlier time and to leave a credit card number to lock in the date and time. No call back. So I call back again and leave a similar message at least three times.  A week later, I do get a call back. Fine. I mean, this was the restaurant choice of one of the birthday honorees; otherwise, I probably wouldn't bother. I am informed that we can move the reservation to an earlier time but that the restaurant is very busy this time of year.  I probably wouldn't be annoyed by this comment if I weren't calling almost every other day and leaving messages. \n\nFood was generally good. Bruschetta was okay but the beef carpaccio and fresh prosciutto and melon were delightful. The rigatoni pasta with caviar and black truffles was good, but no fresh shaved truffles. The lobster ravioli was nice, would have been nice if there were more lobster in the dish. The white truffle tortellini has a light subtle truffle flavor.  Petto Di Pollo is nothing special. The spinach was good and the piccata sauce was not over powering. One of the birthday celebrants also tried the monk fish pasta special which was also good. The scaloppini with porcini mushrooms was very nice.\n\nWe shared desserts. The tiramisu was light and flavorful and the chocolate mousse cake was delicious.  The complimentary biscotti was a nice touch.  We ordered gelato as well but did not get it.  We didn't bother asking for it since the chocolate mousse cake was so good. They also wanted to clear the table and get us out. Definitely not the leisurely Italian meal you might expect. \n\nI should mention that my views on the food may be a bit skewed because of a recent trip to Italy.

We have been celebrating one of many (over 20) birthdays together throughout the years. We were shocked at the horrible treatment we received from the staff at Allegro. Particularly our first waiter. \nOur reservations were made over a month in advance for 6pm on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday. Due to conditions beyond our control we were running a little behind so called the restaurant at 5:45 to say we would be 15 minutes late. They couldn't find our reservations. After much debate on the phone (none of it apologetic) they agreed to seat us but we would need to be out by 7:15. Once we got there (at 6:15), our reservations had been found \"in the back\"??? They said we could stay until 7:25. Really a whole hour and 10 minutes for a fine dining experience? The soon to be rude waiter said that is all they ever allow and kept blaming us for being late.  The rude waiter walked away but continued to glare at us giving us the stink eye and shaking his head. A very nice young man was trying to accommodate us. We should have left but we were tired, hungry and it was Saturday night in the city. So we decided to stay thinking it has to get better, but it doesn't. Before we picked up the menu 3 different employees came to our table asking the same questions but no one seemed to know what was going on. The waiter that was already rude to us came to our table to take our wine order. When I offered to order our appetizers at the same time he started in on us saying \"One thing at a time!\" and then hustled off. We were aghast. When he returned with our wine his attitude was even worse. After a couple rude remarks my friend signaled to him to calm down and he huffed off shoving his order note pad into the hands of the nice young man that seated us. Ok so now things are going to be OK we thought. No such luck. The food was soso. The salad was fine, (spring mix with oil and vinegar), I've had better, the carpaccio soso, lobster ravioli, OK, veal saltimbocca horrible. After trying to cut it with a fork, then the knife we were given, then a steak knife we requested, we still could barely cut or eat this dish. We asked for a doggy back (actually for the dog this time) but it never arrived. They did comp our wine and bring us 3 broken biscotti's with a candle for my birthday. Fifteen minutes before the entire staff serenaded someone else with a celebratory round of \"Happy Birthday\". Ours was a more \"eat this broken cookie and don't let the door hit you on your way out! \n\nIn addition we were seated by the kitchen door. Normally we wouldn't care but not a person walked by that didn't bump my friend's chair. This happened constantly through out the evening. It was so bad it actually became comical. Fortunately we all have a good sense of humor and are able to enjoy each other's company no matter how badly you treat us. On our way out another couple arrived and they couldn't find their reservations either. When we looked at the reviews on Yelp we saw that this is a common occurrence. We won't be back to Allegro's but we will have many future adventures together in the city.", "author": "Lianne W."}

It is true that it is a romantic spot with excellent service.\n\nHowever,  you ARE going there to eat, right? f you have been to Italy and have partaken of the most wonderful tender homemade pasta (in the world), then you may be disappointed here. They do have decent pasta and they do have decent sauces, but, sadly, neither is up to Italian standards. Their boar bolognese was tasty but not a correct bolognese -- too tomato-y and too watery; their tortellini supposedly filled with truffles was not, though its pesto-cream sauce was nice enough; the veal with porcini was a bit overcooked although the porcini sauce was very nice and mushroom-y. The tiramisu was surprisingly light and terrific. The service was very attentive, the wine list quite nice, and the red rose much appreciated. (I didn't mind Brad Pitt and Bill Clinton staring down  at me, actually. The pictures are discreetly small).\n\nDON'T FORGET THE HILL!!. The Broadway sidewalk has steps leading you right up to the restaurant perched on top, and the view of the city and Bay Bridge is gorgeous. But it is quite a climb up those steps, if you approach on foot.\n\nSorry but I am very fussy about Italian food, and this doesn't make it just like all of the other Italian restaurants in the US. We did not order the lobster ravs, mentioned in other reviews here, so that might have been our big mistake.\n\nPerfect place to take a first date who has never been to Italy.

The service was absolutely impeccable, with several servers and Lorenzo (the owner) all making sure we had everything we need from the moment we walked in. The rose petals on the table were a really nice touch, adding to the intimate, romantic vibe of the place. We started out with asparagus smothered in butter and cheese (just the way asparagus should be!) and some very simple but perfectly prepared tomato soup. The bread came out with a really nice zucchini dipping sauce, which almost made up for its lackluster performance. The bread was probably the only real low point of the meal. For mains, we had a steak special, perfectly cooked (which is often a challenge even at very high end restaurants) and paired with spinach and tasty gorgonzola mashed potatoes. My wife had the tortelloni with white truffle burata and pesto, which was pretty amazing. I tried to get my hands on as much of her meal as I could! We finished off with a chocolate on chocolate on chocolate gelato concoction which was as decadent as could be, along with a glass of port on the house. This is definitely a place to check out!

Because, all modesty aide for the moment I can cook better Italian food than most supposed Italian places in San Francisco.  I love this place.  So much so that I confess, I was reluctant to post this.\n\nI do not lightly recommend Italian restaurants to people because, as I've said elsewhere on this site, my ethnic 'cred is on the line.\n\nAs far as this wop is concerned, this place is, bar none, consistently the best Italian in San Francisco!  There is none better.  I used to live in the neighborhood, when I did we were there a couple of times a  month for years.  I don't live in this neighborhood any longer and Ive rarely been there this last ten years now, but oh man it is still that good.\n\nIts not cheap, but its not terribly pricey either. As far as I'm concerned for what you get, the food, the service, the whole experience, its a bargain for what you get.\n\nI feel morally compelled to point out that this is one of those places where, if you know what you're looking for, and you're willing to spend some time scouring the wine list, there are some absolutely sublime wines, for less than what you'd pay for them at retail.\n\nI've lived in San Francisco for many years, and, as much as I love this place for being so casual and accepting, one of the downsides is often service, even in high-end places is, well, pretty casual.   The service in this place is consistently absolutely  impeccable.\n\nFood, wine, service, the neighborhood, this place is the entire package.  Go there, just go.\n\nOh and in so far as some of the negative reviews of this place goes, and I did, many years ago witness such an event, they won't tolerate loud, drunken cretins ruining other people's experience there.   I happen to agree with this and applaud them for it.\n\nOne word of caution, the place is tiny, make a reservation, don't just show up\n\nAlso, if you want a special place to impress someone, take a date, give someone from out of town a memorable San Francisco experience, this is a good place to do that.   Walk half a block East from here to the wall at the top of the hill on Broadway and experience one of the best views of San Francisco you'll never find on any tourist map.

I would pass this place up (in fact I'm sorry I wasted one of my last few dinners in SF on this place).\n\nMy primary problem with this restaurant is the attitude. They make it almost impossible to make reservations (I called and left a voicemail - my calls were never returned, I wrote two emails which were left unanswered) and so we ended up showing up here early one evening (before the dinner rush) in order to try it out.\n\nFurthermore, when we showed up, there were pictures everywhere of celebrities who had come to eat there (perhaps an LA thing to do, but it seemed unnecessarily self-praising), and they were playing classics from Andrea Bocelli, Frank Sinatra, etc. on repeat (like a classic, romantic mix tape ). The host / servers seemed very distracted by some people who were coming later that night. The waiter told us to order quickly (at 6pm) because a large (seemingly \"important\") party was coming at 8pm. (What?!) They kept looking out the window, and going in and out the door in anticipation (which became very cold - one person in our party tried, in vain, to get them to close the door). \n\nIt is worth noting that the homemade pasta (Fettuccine with White Truffle Sauce) was very tasty - however, IMHO, it's not worth the effort.", "author": "Helen D."}

A restaurant that caters to the locals and is off the beaten path. There is a certain charm that comes with this philosophy, that is, if you can get your foot in the door.\n\nI made reservations with their answering machine. The message on their machine told me that someone would call me back. No one ever called me back. I figured that based on the other yelp reviews that I should just plan on coming in. My girlfriend and I took an Uber there and were greeted at the door by a friendly waiter. He asked if we had reservations and I said that I had called and requested a table but had never heard back. This may have been my fault for taking the chance but in this day and age, in San Francisco no doubt, I feel as though something as simple as a call back should be SOP. When we were told that the restaurant was full and that there was no room for us we were told that we should go to their sister restaurant down the street and that we would be taken care of. \n\nI understood that we did not have a reserved confirmation but for them to then send us to another restaurant and then not let that restaurant know we were coming was what put me over the edge. We were made to look foolish. Walking into two different places and turned away from both. We were both dressed up and it was to celebrate a special occasion. The staff just made a bunch of excuses as to why they could not answer their phone or call us back or why we couldn't eat there. All of this felt very elitist as though we were not allowed to eat there.\n\nI have lived in SF for over a decade and love it here. This is my home.

For being popular among celebrities, I'm extremely shocked there isn't a six-month waiting list and pleasantly surprised commoners like myself can make a reservation for the same week.  As I grow older, however, I've decided to be less selfish--and more sharing.  You're welcome for #216.\n\nMy girl friends and I had a romantic dinner for five here, complete with rose petals on white tablecloth, Dean Martin's \"That's Amore,\" and one of the best service in town.  We each received complimentary port wine for dessert and long-stem red roses to take home--I can't even remember the last time a boy gave me flowers on a date.  Oh, wait... 11th grade.  Chinese hole-in-the-wall.  Unmemorable except for that.\n\nAnyway, the food.  The food sounded mouthwatering on the menu, looked tantalizing in front of me, and tasted unbelievable in my mouth.  We began with the caviar and salmon crepes ($12.50).  They were light yet tasty; my only complaint was that they were very small.  I could've had two orders of that by myself for an appetizer, but I'm also eating to keep warm for the 50-degree winters here.  \n\nNext I had the rigatoni with foie gras, black truffles, and Madeira wine ($18).  The sauce was flavorful, rich, and plentiful.  I even saved a few bites to take home, so that I could relive my foodgasm the next day.  Absolutely divine.  I also tried MS's white truffle tortellini in basil pesto sauce ($18.50).  Another winner.  For the record, all the pastas are homemade and heavenly.  I just can't wait to try the lobster ravioli with pink vodka sauce and scallop risotto in black ink and fig-balsamic sauce!  I can't even say that without drooling a little on my keyboard. \n\nFor dessert we shared the tartufo tre scalini--a rich, handmade chocolate ice cream roll.  Apparently, Allegro Romano and it's sister restaurant (Tre Scalini in Rome) are famous for it, and it paired perfectly with the port.  DC said it was the best meal we've had, and we have weekly dinners together at different restaurants, so that speaks volumes.\n\nI couldn't be happier that Allegro Romano is in my neighborhood.  Not only does Russian Hill have the best French (La Folie) and best German (Leopold's) in SF, it also has the best Italian.  Ok, Acquerello may be #1 and in Nob Hill, but Allegro Romano is a close second and much more reasonably priced. \n\nI actually spent five months in Italy last year, so I'm kind of an authority on Italian cuisine.

Be professional! \n\nThen as he went around to check all our IDs (totally fine obviously we are in our early 20s and should be carded) he made a big stink about one of our friends not drinking (??!!) how fricken rude of the server!!! It's a personal choice to drink or not to drink alcohol and being made fun of for it is soooo not cool!\n\nWhen we got the check they must of come back 10 times to see if we were done figuring out how much everybody owed. It got so rude and irritating we literally had to yell at them that we weren't done yet and we'd let them know. Then to top it off we were the last table to be in the restaurant (and it wasn't that late) and as soon as the 2nd to last table got up to leave they turned on all the lights in a passive aggressive effort to get us out. Clearly our money and patronage wasn't good enough for them. \n\nI've never experience service this rude anywhere! Needless to say none of us will be coming back.\n\nWay to judge a group of girls by our age, when we were completely polite, not rowdy at all, and just trying to enjoy a night out.", "author": "Olivia L."}

When Cherylynn A. suggested Allegro Romano for dinner, the record needle literally went off track.. Wha? Where? Huh? I had never heard of it before and surprisingly so! One look at the walls and they're covered with pictures of celebrities. And not only is Rigatoni alla 'Amatriciana featured on the menu as Willie Brown's favorite pasta dish, but the server also told me that Gary Danko frequents Allegro for the Fettucini with White Truffle Sauce and the New York Strip Steak. \n\nSuffice it say, I have more in common with Willie Brown and Gary Danko than I thought because Allegro has now become my favorite Italian restaurant in SF. BOLD WORDS, right?! Well, as I'm writing this review, my mouth is literally WATERING, thinking about other pasta dishes I can return and try. (Note: After I wrote this review, I made reservations for this upcoming Saturday).\n\nWe started off our meal with a complimentary bruschetta. The bread was toasted to crunchy perfection and topped with a fresh mix of tomatoes, basil, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. \n\nWe each ordered the Rigatoni Pasta with Foie Gras, Black Truffles & Old Madera Wine. The server was helpful enough to suggest that we split the pasta dish to make room for the entree. I'm glad he did! The half portion size was very generous! I ate this pasta so slooooow, attempting to saver and prolong the orgasmic experience. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente, its toothsome ridges coated with a rich, decadent savory sauce of foie gras, black truffles and wine. The sauce was PERFECTION: subtly sweet, savory, and earthy. The last time I had foie gras-truffle pasta this mind-blowingly good was at Acquerello, but for double the price.\n\nNext, I had the Scaloppini with Porcini Mushrooms. Anything that's noted on the menu as \"a piece of Heaven\" has to be tried at least once. The tender, thinly sliced pieces of veal were dredged in flour, saut\u00e9ed, and topped with fresh porcini mushrooms in a Barolo-Port reduction demi-glace. Though \"a piece of Heaven\" may be a stretch, this dish was still very, very good. The port reduction was reminiscent of the foie gras-truffle sauce from my first course: rich, decadent, subtly sweet, but still savory.\n\nI tried a piece of Cherylynn A's Filetto ai Porcino and Baretto Sauce Black Angus filet mignon with porcini mushrooms & Barolo red wine sauce and it was also very, very good. \n\nJust when I thought the meal was over, it got extended by another hour, some complimentary housemade almond biscotti, and a whole lotta port. Service during this entire time was TOP-NOTCH. \n\nAllegro is a neighborhood gem. Reasonably priced for all budgets, but with a romantic, intimate atmosphere that speaks to champagne tastes. Our server also mentioned that most of its customers come from hotels like the Fairmont, InterContinental, and the Ritz.", "author": "Monelle A."}

First to note, this is a small joint on a corner, off the beaten-path of all the big, elegant, tourist-trap restaurants found in Northern San Francisco. The look is simple, but the food is far from it. But as far as my reviews tend to go, I weigh the quality of the food and service first off. You can tell by any pictures that it is not an \"elegant\" place, though they try with what space they are given. It has characteristics of the owner, which makes it more his personal work, which I find enduring in restaurants that are \"off the beaten path.\"\nThe staff was amazing. These people really knew their stuff and seemed to enjoy their job. Many dishes on the menu feature white and black truffles. Our waiter came by our table to answer any questions we had about the menu, and with him he brought a whole, beautiful black truffle so that we may see the quality and freshness of the ingredient. I loved that. Those things are not cheap and this one was an impressive size, so to have it brought out and explained was pretty neat.\nAs for the food, fantastic. I had the white truffle tortellini with creamy pesto sauce. The truffle flavor was just enough to boost the flavor of every part of the dish, but not overwhelming. It was by far the best creamy pesto sauce I've had. \nAnother guest had their version of a carbonara (not featured on their online menu) with black truffle. Once again, the flavor of the smokier black truffle was an enticing background to the meats and perfectly cooked pasta. No bite was lacking in either flavor.\nFinally, the third in our party had the risotto with scallops in black-ink and fig-balsamic sauce. I must say, the flavors of the ink with the fig balsamic were something I have not had before, and I loved it. The risotto took on a dark color, which may seem off-putting, but that is the result of the calamari ink, which in itself seems off-putting, however after one bite you will get what it is all about.\nThroughout the meal our staff was friendly and energetic, filling our wine classes without being asked and offering any answers to questions we may have. As the meal came to a close, they brought us three small port glasses and filled them with a wonderful Tanny Port - on the house! But it didn't end there, we had clearly been chatting it up quite a bit and they made us feel comfortable enough to stay as they continued to fill the glasses! I was amazed at the generosity of it! They were playful but not in-you-face about anything, just consistently making sure we were well taken care of in the drinks department- which we certainly did not mind! \nOver all, I was happy. I had been nervous about impressing my guests and judging by their complements to the food, I had done well (meaning Allegro Romano did well, I merely selected it).", "author": "Laurel R."}

It's a small, quaint place that's perfect for romantic dates...or in my case a fun night out with the girls. The ambience begins with rose petals on the tables and dim lighting. Not a bad start. \n\nWe had an appetizer of salmon crepes which were delicious and well priced. My main dish was the rigatoni with foie gras and black truffles. Melt in your mouth deliciousness and under $20. Given the fact that the walls are plastered with pictures of celebrities (Brad Pitt smiles down at you while you eat), I wasn't expecting such great prices. \n\nThe Italian owner and waiters complete the picture. Everyone is very nice. It also doesn't hurt that they give out free port and a rose for each girl on your way out. Best date with a restaurant I've ever had.

People were constantly checking to see if we were enjoying the meal and to see if they could get us anything else. \n\nWe split the black angus filet mignon and the fettucini with white truffle sauce. Both were superb. We also were provided complimentary bruschetta. We ordered a glass of wine each, and they also gave us a dessert wine. We remember the dessert being good but can't remember what it was (might be related to the complimentary refills on the dessert wine). Even after we had clearly ordered everything we were going to, they kept refilling our wine, as if we could have stayed all night if we wanted to.

I made reservations for two, four weeks in advance and I believe I received the last two-party reservation at 6. Upon entering, we were greeted by a staff member and were seated quickly. The place had only been open for about an hour and there weren't many people occupying the restaurant and made the evening quiet and enjoyable.\n\nThe excellent staff were nice, speedy, and funny. Unfortunately, I never got their names but one of 'em helped us decide on the bottle of red wine and it was a brilliant choice. Minutes after ordering, our appetizer of bruschetta came and were delicious. The bread was toasted nicely and was very cripsy but, did not crumble when cut. Tomatoes were flavorful and the olive oil used seemed to be extra, extra virgin.\n\nI ordered the homemade lobster raviolli and have no regrets. The pink vodka sauce was not overpowering or too tangy, within the sauce were pieces of lobster (damn good). The raviolli was easy to cut with either a fork or with a knife, it stayed together and the fillings didn't spill out. The portion size was a good amount that left enough room for dessert.\n\nMy lady friend ordered the White Truffle Tortellini in Basil Pesto Sauce. Creamy, chewy tortellini. With the basil pesto sauce, you can rstill taste the truffle within the tortellini. The portion size again was as good as the lobster ravi.\n\nWe topped the night with a slice of key lime pie and tiramisu, which I believe were homemade. The tiramisu sat beside two finger sized biscotti's, two pieces of cantaloupe, small dash of whipcream with raspberry sauce on top. the plate was also netted with chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. Presentation was amazing and the tiramisu itself stayed together very well. The biscotti's had a very nice almond flavor and were semi-soft.\n\nI definitely plan on coming back in the near future.", "author": "Vince L."}

All 5 stars.  \n\nWhen we first arrived, we went to a small corner table, which the server moved away from the booth so we could sit down. I think our server was new..he was a bit awkward and another server was always closeby.  We started with the Carpaccio.  I've never had it before, but holy crap.  It was so thinly sliced spread out on a big plate with this delicious cheese grated on top.  I think it was one of the most flavorful things I've ever eaten.  Seriously, amazing.\n\nThen we had dinner: Josh had Willie Brown's favorite.  I forget the name, but it was pasta served in a delicious red sauce and the server actually recommended Josh's and my dish for the entree.  He had it prepared for Josh the way he liked it, which had long onions on top.  \n\nI got the lobster ravioli..which was AMAZING.  I tend to shy away from ravioli at restaurants because I hate how most places make it too thin and then everything comes out.  Or I hate when I get one HUGE ravioli..it's annoying.  So I told our server that and he said, order it, ours isn't like that.  And it wasn't!  It was just the right consistency of thickness.  You cut it with your fork no problem, but it didn't fall apart when you did that.  The filling was delicious and I practically licked the plate when I finished the ravioli to get all that sauce.\n\nWe finished with a tiramisu which I never order because Josh doesn't like it..but I had a feeling if dinner was this good, their tiramisu would be also.  And it was.  Not too much rum, it wasn't soggy at all.  Delicious chocolate throughout and a great chocolate sauce on the plate.  They served it with biscotti and watermelon. Really nice touch.  \n\nAnd they gave me a pretty peach rose and the server took several pictures of us outside next to the restaurant per my request.

We were originally a party of two (thru Open Table), but were unable to change it to three - we did try.  One of our party was early, the two of us were about 5 minutes late.  Maybe unforgiveable but should have been manageable.  Because of this they sat us at a table, originally set for two, but had to put one of us (me) in the aisle and this made the aisle tighter. I'm not a big person, 5'1\", 113 lbs, but the waiter, who was wearing teal/green colored pants,(heard he might have been the manager) bumped into my chair at least a half dozen times - NO apologies. \nThe bread and dipping sauce were not the best, but we could live with it.  Because two of us were not really hungry we ordered the Dungeness crab cesar salad as our dinner entrees.  Bad mistake!  Very little crab, and what little we had consisted of a few crumbs of crab - NO lump portions!  Not nice since we do live in the Dungeness crab capital of the world.  We did know that it was not crab season, but really - we could've gotte a little more crab in our CRAB cesar salad! The dressing and croutons were also a disappointment, but we let that go.  UNTIL we noticed the table next to us ordered the same salad; however, their crab portion was a healthy portion with lump meat portions. \nWhere's the quality control or was this their way of NOT forgiving us for coming in late, adding an extra person, or only ordering salad as our entrees.  BTW the third person in our party ordered first and second courses PLUS a glass of wine!  She did enjoy her meal and said it was very delicious.  They also served us so quickly that we were out of the restaurant within 45-50 minutes.  \nAlso worth mentioning.  As of right now we still have not received our 100 points from Open Table.

For the meal alone, 5 stars.\n\nThe extras of this restaurant really pushed it toward a place I'd love to frequent on a regular basis, if only I lived closer. One of the servers (who had a great set of pipes) busted out into Opera mid-dinner. The servers made a big fuss over my birthday which I appreciated and thought was cute. We were brought a complimentary dessert and two glasses of port.\n\nOn a side note, everyone, from the hostess, to two servers, to presumably the owner...offered to call us a cab. I guess some people would be offended or felt like alcoholics, but I thought it was great. Awesome food, friendly service, and making sure you get home safely - 5 stars for sure!", "author": "Brooke I."}

If you are considering driving I would look for other options if you don't want to drive around for a while looking for a spot. The restaurant itself - Fantastic! This has to be one of the most underrated restaurants in the city and just became one of my favorites. I am going to become a regular here and take out-of-town guests here for sure.\n\nWe came in a party of five for my father-in-laws birthday and right off the bat we were greeted by the owner/chef and his great staff. The people here really make you feel at home; actually as a guest in their home. I think the reviews complaining about service or the overbearing owner is from people that like to be left alone and eat with their heads down or have no experience with cultures outside of the US. The owner walks around and jokes with people and the staff is attentive and friendly. The ladies at the table loved being addressed as bella. From start to finish we were there about three hours and never once felt rushed to leave. We actually were encouraged to stay longer even though the restaurant was almost full all evening.\n\nAs for the food, it was a large selection of better-than-average Italian fare. Everything tasted very authentic and reminded me of when I was in Italy. The prices are also extremely reasonable for the quality and portion size.\n\nIf you are looking for a restaurant where you can sit, eat and leave this is probably not the place for you.

I had called early in August to make a reservation for early September. I work restaurant hours, so I wasn't able to call when the restaurant was open. I left a concise message with my name, phone number, and reservation details, asking to be called back to confirm whether or not the time I had requested was available (their message machine said it was okay to do so, or else I would have arranged to call when I knew they would be open). I waited till the last week of August, thinking they may call me back closer to the time the reservation was made to confirm. Long story short I called back twice, each time leaving a message asking to be called back at said number about said reservation - nothing. So I felt suspicious and called when they were supposed to be open, first time no answer, second time, no answer again. Third time was the charm I suppose, a gentleman answered the phone, told me there was no information about my reservation. Moreover they had a wedding planned that exact evening, he went on to tell me the time they would be in, for how many people, that the reservation was made in March and so on.\n\nThis would have all been fine, I would have asked if there was anything available for Saturday or Sunday in that case, but the tone I was spoken to in was so completely and absolutely degrading I was truly shocked. He had an \"Oh well, this your fault not mine, attitude\", and I wasn't even offered and \"Oh, I'm so sorry unfortunately we have had a wedding planned for that evening\" related sentence.\n\nAll in all, we will not be enjoying the apparently amazing food at this restaurant, and further we never will. A place that doesn't know the basics of customer service doesn't deserve my patronage when there are copious amounts of amazing struggling restaurants in the city.", "author": "Angelika M."}

The owner is not genuinely friendly.  He will only barely muster up a smile if he knows he is going to make a lot of money off you.  \n\nI went there recently with my husband and brother in law.  We spent about $250 for the three of us.  The wine was pretty good and the food was a grade B.  The sparkling wine they serve before the meal (complimentary) tasted cheap and it gave me a headache.\n\nThe main waiter (tall with black slicked back hair) is totally disgusting and when I was getting up from my table, my husband turned to talk to my brother-in-law and the waiter literally tried to kiss me - about one inch from my mouth.  It was not a typical European kiss although he disguised it as such.  He was totally staring at me the whole time he was waiting on me and I was really uncomfortable.  I live in the neighborhood and he always cat-calls to me when I'm walking by the street and says perverted things to me.  It is brazen and shameless how he carries himself.  I cannot believe the owner would tolerate that waiter as an image of his restaurant. \n\nI think it's really silly and embarrassing the way the owner puts pictures of himself and celebrities on the front window.  It really is not classy.  If celebrities or wealthy people visit your restaurant, then the classy thing to do would be to not advertise that.  Plus, they are not even on real photo paper - just on cheap paper.  It looks trashy to me.\n\nLastly, parking in this neighborhood is really hard.  Many of us come home from work and have to search for 15-30 minutes.  This restaurant owner has him and his friends motorcycles parked sideways to take up parking spots for their guests.  Then they move the motorcycles out so that restaurant guests can take up neighborhood parking.  It is so rude and disrespectful of the neighborhood that you have your business in.  Stop being so CHEAP and go to the city and pay the city to zone the area outside of your restaurant so you can have commercially permitted parking there.", "author": "Chloe V."}

Based on reviews, Allegro seemed the most promising.  So, off we went on our Wed. night date.  \n\nWe walked in around 8 pm to an almost full, dimly lit, quaint space.  The first thing I noticed were the rose petals on each table and I thought, damn, we should have made a reservation because they're obviously having some sort of special event.  Fortunately, this was not actually the case.  We were greeted by ebullient flower arrangements, a bustling staff, and the very colorfully dressed Miami-esque, (Lincoln Rd., anyone?) owner, Lorenzo.  \n\nHere's what we ordered: a carafe of the house Sangiovese (which was really decent and I am not typically a fan), the porcini mushroom over soft polenta appetizer special (3 stars), caesar salad w/ dungeness crab (4.5 stars), fettucine bolognese (3 stars), and of course, lobster ravioli (4 stars*).  \n\n* I'm a New England girl.  I know my lobstah.  The ravioli's themselves were perfectly cooked, but could be meatier.  The flavor of the lobster was lost in the sauce, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  According to my bf, the sauce \"is like liquid crack.  It's like ice cream.\"  I completely agree.  We slurped up every last bit. \n  \nWhat we got was 2 rounds of yummy, garlicky bruschetta prior to our appetizers, bread w/ red pepper eggplant dip, the meal we ordered, 2 dessert plates with fruit, biscotti, and whipped cream, (because we didn't order an actual dessert), and bottomless port.  \n\nI'm not sure if it was simply the 2nd glass of wine, the cheese of the glass motif/celebrity photos decor, the ongoing joke that our waters never got below an inch of the rim, (or for that matter our wine from the spot of the initial pour), or the farce of the endless complimentary add ons to our meal, but at some point we started laughing and didn't stop.  \n\nThe staff is INCREDIBLE.  What was lacking in certain dishes was more than made up for by the impeccable service and hospitality.  The mood is infectious.

Moving from Boston where we have some of the best Italian food in the country (also Providence, RI), I was disappointed with a lot of the other places.  Allegro Romano was the best.  Made a res on OpenTable, we were a little early but we were able to sit right away.  The restaurant itself is small but beautiful.  The food was great.  We tried the caprese salad (I've had better on the East Coast but still very good), asparagus (amazing!!!) and arugula salad (delicious!!) to start.  For entrees, two of us (myself included) ordered the scallopini which was really delicious.  My fiancee got the bolognese which was fantastic - not too acidic and the pasta was cooked just right.  My father ordered a special entree which was Maine lobster with clams in red sauce.  He and his girlfriend both said the lobster was overcooked, but again, we are snobs from New England when it comes to seafood!  For the record, he cleaned his plate!!  Also - our waitress told us that we could order half-orders of pasta, so we all tried the pesto tortellini.  This was hands down the best thing on the menu!  The pesto was creamy and fresh, and the tortellini were cooked beautifully.  We finished dessert with espressos and tiramisu.  The dessert was very good but not the best tiramisu I've had (it had a little too much cocoa for me).  The espresso was delicious.  They did not offer sugar in the raw (which i usually drink with espresso), so I drank it black and it was good!  The service was exceptional also.  The one \"downside\" would be that after our coffee & dessert it took a really long time (like 20 minutes) to get the check.  It was a particularly warm evening in SF and the restaurant became very warm, so it would've been nice to get the check and leave sooner.  BEST PART of the meal was about halfway through dinner they flicked the lights on and off and played \"That's Amore\"  - everyone sang along and the manager/host character came around and clicked everyones' wine glasses.

This is going to be a pretty long review since I had such an amazing experience.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up coming 30 minutes late for our reservations due to the crazy Valentine's Day + rush hour traffic. When we finally got there, we parked at some random spot just so we could check in before losing our reservations. Upon walking in, the owner didn't seem impatient at all despite us calling every ten minutes to tell him we would be taking a bit longer. He gave us a very warm greeting while walking us over to our table lined with rose petals and candles. My boyfriend was about to order first and go find a different parking spot while we waited for our food, but the owner overheard our situation and told him to just go get his car and he'll give him a place to park right in front. \n\nThe restaurant itself was very intimate since there were only 20 or so seats. There was a special Valentine's Day menu and we ended up ordering two appetizers (the carpaccio and the caesar salad with dungeness crab), the lobster ravioli for each of us, and the tiramisu. I felt like the cheese was a bit sharp and detracted from the taste of the carpaccio a bit, but it was still good nonetheless. The caesar salad was pretty good and had a lot more crab meat than I was expecting. They took the courtesy of splitting up the salad into two dishes for us without having to ask, and even so each of our dishes were still generously sized. The lobster ravioli stole the show and my boyfriend probably mentioned how much he liked the sauce at least 10 times. We noticed that the tables around us were getting biscotti on the house for dessert but we decided to go ahead and order their famous tiramisu. The tiramisu was rich and creamy and did not disappoint. The bill came out to $90 for everything, which was a pretty good price considering we each essentially had a four course meal.\n\nHonestly, I probably would have rated the food itself 4 stars, but I can't help but give them a 5 since they have the best service I have ever seen. Our water never even got to the halfway point because they were so quick at refilling everything. The second our bread was gone, they would go get us more. I noticed that the servers went around to all the tables and would often crack jokes as if they've been friends with the guests for a long time. The owner himself came around the entire time to talk to the patrons and to check if everyone was happy. The couple next to us was talking to one of the servers about their last visit and he told them he remembered them, where they sat, and even how their table was arranged. There was a proposal while we were in the restaurant and every single person in the restaurant clapped when the owner announced that the girl said yes. They ended up flickering the lights above the couple a few times and then played a few upbeat Italian love songs for them. The couple got up to dance and the owner encouraged all of the other couples to do so as well. The icing on the cake was when the servers gave every girl a rose as they were getting ready to leave. On top of that, they moved the entire table so that the guests sitting on the inside could get out easier. When my boyfriend and I walked out of the restaurant at the end of the night, the owner personally came outside to shake my boyfriend's hand, kiss my hand, and thank us for coming. I definitely felt like I was a part of a big happy family the entire night.\n\nI noticed that there was no one there to take up the empty seats as people were leaving. However, the servers were getting the empty tables ready anyway. They probably knew that people want to take their time and enjoy themselves on Valentine's Day so they spaced out the reservations in two waves.", "author": "Anne L."}

Each table looks like it is set up for a special occasion, which is how it should be every time you eat out.  \n\nWe filled our tummies with the most delicious sea bass and fillet mignon. Mmmm...

We called Friday afternoon for a Saturday res and they were all booked up, LUCKY for us, they had a table for that night! We got there on time and they sat us in about ten minutes.\n\nAll our food was absolutely delicious. One of the highlights was the black truffle risotto special. The white truffle fettuccine was also to die for. My friend ordered the Rigatoni all'Amatriciana, which was recommended by the waiter. It was good, but definitely not as delicious as everything else. We flagged down our waiter and she politely told him there was nothing wrong with the food, she just wasn't crazy about it. He joked that he was hurt that she didn't like his favorite and brought something else for her right away. I mean, that is GREAT service!! There is nothing wrong with the food and they just want you to be happy so they bring you something else anyways!! Love this place. \n\nDefinitely worth going and I hope to go back next time I'm in the area. My only one tiiiiiiiny gripe would be that the decor is a tad outdated, but it actually kind of works for this charming and yummy Italian restaurant.", "author": "j j."}

They put flower petals/confetti on the table and gave us awesome bruschetta, biscotti and port on the house--what a treat! \n\nTheir fettuccine with white truffle sauce is quite possibly my FAVORITE pasta in the city now. The sauce wasn't overly truffle--just a hint so it didn't make me tired of the taste. Went very well with a glass of pinot.\n\nLobster ravioli was awesome too, with big chunks of lobster meat in the stuffing. At first I thought they also tossed the pasta with lobster but it ended up being pieces of tomato, haha. The pink vodka sauce was so great we used our bread to wipe the bread clean....no shame!\n\nHomemade tiramisu was light and sweet, a perfect end to our meal. My only complaint was that the mushrooms trifolat appetizer was a little bit of a disappointment...probably something I could have made at home. Next time I'll get the crab caesar salad instead. \n\nDefinitely recommend. Trotting up those massive hills up to the restaurant makes this meal all the more worth it!", "author": "Stefi C."}

My aunt was in town so my parents and I decided to take her out to Italian food. I had my eye on Allegro Romano for a few weeks so we decided to give it a try.  I had made a reservation ahead of time and we arrived just in time. The table was ready, scattered with rose petals, and neatly set up. We waited about 15 minutes for my father and he STILL hadn't found a parking. The owner, bless his soul, offered to move his motorcycle across the street so he could get a parking! Talk about consideration for one's customers. No restaurant has ever done that for us, and we were extremely impressed and eternally grateful. In addition, there was a proposal that night! We witnessed the last part of it and there was definitely a huge congratulation for the couple. A very great start to a dinner.\n\nWe ordered bruschetta and crepes with salmon and caviar as appetizers. Both were pleasing, but the crepes were the clear winner. The bruschetta was tasty but slightly soggy, as if it had been sitting on the counter for a while. I prefer it when it is still crisp and crunchy. For main entrees, I ordered Willie's Brown Favorite, my mother ordered the linguine with olive oil/garlic and fresh halibut, my father ordered the filet mignon, and my aunt ordered the special which was baby shark. I enjoyed mine though I secretly thought to myself that I could make something similar at home. My mother's order was my favorite - the olive oil/garlic had a kick to it and it was spicy! Absolutely amazing. My father's filet mignon was overcooked for my taste (he ordered medium when you should ALWAYS order medium rare or rare!) but still very tasty. My aunt's baby shark (tears running down my face) was similar in consistency with ahi tuna. Good, but nothing spectacular. Again, tears run down my face when I think of the poor baby shark ): The food was solid, but nothing truly amazing that would make me race back here any time soon. We skipped dessert, but they offered us complimentary biscotti.\n\nThe service was stupendous. They did not rush us or made us feel like we had to leave. They conversed and threw jokes with us without doing so overwhelmingly. Our waiter did abandon us at random times but that was because he was congratulating ANOTHER couple on their proposal! TWO PROPOSALS in one night! \n\nAltogether, good food (not amazing), amazing service, romantic/cozy ambiance. A well deserved 5 stars!", "author": "Hannah L."}

We were disappointed with the appetizer, two meat entrees, and the dessert.   \n\nAlso, we felt rushed by the staff at the end of our meal.  We purposely made an 8PM reservation so we could take our time over a four course meal with wine and coffee and not worry that the staff needed to turn the table after us.  However, we couldn't help but feel like they wanted us out by 10PM.  One of the servers attempted to clear our dessert before we were finished, and soon after that, a rose and the check appeared on our table.  (We were still eating dessert and at least two other tables were still occupied.)  Next, our coats were brought over to the chairs next to us.

It was a Sunday evening (when they are normally closed) but luckily, the restaurant happened to be open on this night. Magical moment number one. \n\nWe were treated to two delightful glasses of champagne as we waited for our table to be prepared. Magical moment number two. As we settled into our corner cozy booth, Lorenzo (the proprietor) came over with a warm welcome. Earlier, I had mentioned to my boyfriend that I was in the mood for a bottle of Barolo wine with the classic Italian fare. Lorenzo asked us if we would be drinking red or white wine that evening. He produced and decanted a beautiful bottle of Barolo that he insisted on giving us as a gift. Magical moment three. \n\nThe food was sumptuous. Perfect bruschetta, classic Caesar salads heaped with Dungeness crab, tender scaloppini with fresh porcini mushrooms in a Barolo-Port wine reduction sauce, Black Angus filet mignon and an unfathomable version of tiramisu that I absolutely LOVED. I normally won't even touch the stuff. I flat out do not like tiramisu. This version however, was, well - magical. And devoured. \n\nAs we sat beaming in the post-dinner afterglow, marveling at the meal we just had, Lorenzo strolled over once again. With a gracious smile and the delivery of two roses he casually mentioned that this was his mother's birthday too. He then proceeded to pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat.  \"Your dinner is on the house tonight. I wish you a very happy birthday.\"\n\nPure magic.

SO RICH, but so delicious.  we were both full before we even got the pastas, but we couldn't stop eating because the food was just so good.  the flavors are well developed and you get a really nice portion of food.  we were too full for dessert, but they still brought us out some biscotti to enjoy and port which was delightful.  im generally not a fan of port, but i could get on board with this port after such a nice meal.\n\nno doubt I will be coming back here.  reasonably priced, delicious food, excellent service.", "author": "Lisa C."}

Nothing really interesting about the menu--the same standard Italian fare you could get anywhere else. What ruined the meal was the service. No exaggeration--we could not go more than 45 seconds without a server or busser visiting the table. Take one sip of water, someone stops to refill it. But they don't service the whole table at once. The next time someone takes a sip of water, someone else stops to refill the glass. 30 seconds later, 3 bussers and the hostess all hover over the table frantically looking for something, anything, to fill or clear. The second you take the last bite of food, they clear the plate before you're even done chewing. But never quietly or subtly. Every single time the conversation is interrupted. Seriously, within 15 minutes of sitting down we were all nervous wrecks. I felt like I was being circled by a frenzied pack of hyenas.

However when we arrived at the restaurant Thanksgiving evening for dinner, we were surprised to find that the place was closed.  \n\nTo begin with, I had a very difficult time making a reservation.  A person rarely answers the phone and if you leave a message on the answering machine, they do not call you back.  When I finally got a hold of someone, I specifically asked twice if they were open on Thanksgiving evening for dinner and was told each time that they were.  So you can imagine my disappointment when we arrive Thursday night and found out that they were not open.\n\nI called the day after Thanksgiving to make sure that I hadn't accidentally made the reservation for the wrong day.  Someone other than the owner answered.  The person informed me that the owner had decided to close the restaurant for Thanksgiving after I had made my reservation.  I told the person that I had never received a call or a message on my answering machine informing me of this decision.  The person told me he would have the owner call me back to make amends, and confirmed that my phone number was correct.  \n\nThe owner never called me back.  I called multiple times on Monday and even left a message.  My calls were never returned.  Honestly, there are so many great and welcoming restaurants in San Francisco that serve amazing food and have friendly service, I wonder why I even wasted my time on such a rude restaurant that didn't have the decency to inform me they were closed on Thanksgiving and left my family and I hanging.  \n\nIn the end, we decided to go Wayfare Tavern (we had walked by it earlier that day and saw it was open).  Wayfare Tavern seated us immediately even though we didn't have a reservation, had great food, friendly service, and I would highly recommend them.", "author": "Jamie S."}

I have been dealing with the owner & his restaurant for years, which was usually positive, but just today I had two different guests have issue with the restaurant. ITS NOT EVEN THE FOOD BECAUSE THEY NEVER MADE IT IN THERE! Making reservations is a complete NIGHTMARE because they NEVER EVER acknowledge voicemail although the owner claims to return phone calls. What's worse is them NOT returning a guest's phone call. You've got to have the 'in' with the owner\n or be one of his hoi-polloi regulars to get any acknowledgement. It just gets worse every year but then again he's successful enough that he doesn't need the additional business. It's unfortunate because it WAS a great place where he always went out of his way to make you feel @ home.

Hubby ordered the special, which was the osso bucco. I helped my mom choose the risotto with scallops in a black ink and fig sauce and my dad got the king salmon.  \n\nthey serve bread with a red dip - i think it was tomato and red pepper? not sure. i wish the bread were warm - because you could tell it was pretty good bread.\n\nthen we waited for our appetizer. they mistakenly took a couple cold appetizers to our table with some sharing plates and made it a point to change the plates when they realized our appetizer was warm to a warm plate. good service!  oh wow - the truffle fettuccine was sooo good. rich and heavy, but i kept on wanting to eat more. and i think the owner shaved at least 8-10 pieces of truffle on the pasta. it was so flavorful and addictive.  my favorite of the night for sure.  \n\nfor the mains, my favorite was the osso bucco - it was so tender and flavorful and seasoned just right.  then it would probably be the risotto and scallops. the scallops were cooked perfectly! and then the veal and salmon which was good, but nothing special (the mushrooms on the veal were yummy)\n\nwe didn't get to try their desserts, because we brought our own cake.

I called the restaurant (reservations not available through OpenTable) and found that they were booked solid on Friday and only had two relatively early reservations on Saturday, so I took the later of the two.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I took a taxi to the restaurant, which was tucked away in a residential neighborhood.  We arrived a couple of minutes before our reservation and were greeted by Lorenzo, the owner. The service leading up to being seated was impeccable!  I looked at my fianc\u00e9e's hard-to-please pleasant surprise and knew Allegro was the right decision! \n\nFrom the indications on Yelp I was apprehensive about the pricing, but when the dinner menu arrived the pricing was reasonable. The specials were a Halibut over garbanzo bean mashed potatoes and spinach as well as a lobster linguine...I was torn about which to order, but fortunately my fianc\u00e9e was in the mood for the Halibut and so I ordered the lobster.\n\nThe wine selection was good, though it was a bit pricey, but were able to find a decent selection none the less.  When the food arrived, we actually switched and I started on the Halibut while she started on the lobster. She felt the linguine was a bit overcooked, but that that lobster was amazing! I thought the Halibut and garbanzo mashed potatoes were outstanding! So we switched again. I enjoyed the lobster and linguine, while she agreed that the Halibut was very tasty.  I like my pasta a bit overcooked, so the linguine was right up my alley.  The portions were the perfect size, as neither of us left hungry after the meal (a huge problem at some restaurants in SF).\n\nWe typically don't order desert, but decided to go with coffee instead since we were not yet ready to call it a night. When the coffee arrived, the waiter also showed up with fresh strawberries and biscotti.  When we finished with the meal we were concerned about having to call a cab, so I asked our waiter about which company to call...he told me not to worry about it because they would call the cab and let us know when it arrived.\n\nI had already paid the bill, but we were not rushed out of our table while we waited for the cab. Water continued to be refreshed as we continued our conversation.  When the cab did arrive about 15 minutes later, Lorenzo himself let us know and thanked us for coming. \n\nOverall, this was one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant in a while! The atmosphere was perfect, the size of the restaurant was quaint and intimate, the service was impeccable and the food was wonderful! I was surprised at the low price of the bill (even after a bottle of wine) for this high-level of restaurant!

The Black Truffle Fettuccine (imported from Italy, of course) was so orgasmic that I had to cut it into tiny pieces and let it just savor on my tongue, hoping that the flavor could stay with me forever.... oh, just remembering makes my mouth water with satisfaction!\n\nThe waiter danced with me to That's Amore by Dean Martin... The entire restaurant sang happy birthday to me... The wine glasses and water glasses never hit bottom.  It was a perfect evening....\n\nUntil the bill came.  This was the only reason I'm giving Allegro Romano a 4 star rather than a 5 star rating.  And, as I type this... I'm not convinced it's completely fair.  Ideally, I would give them 4.5 stars.  Here's the bill situation.  We only ordered 3 carafes of wine, but apparently they just kept bringing them and we ended up having 6, and two were comped.  There were so many dishes of food coming and we weren't able to assess how much wine we were drinking or not drinking because we never ever served ourselves.  If the glass was down a half an inch, they would top it off without us even really being aware of it.  We should have clarified the price of the family style dining prior to ordering it.  We made assumptions that it wasn't going to be too much because the entrees ranged from $15-$25, so even double the price of the most expensive entree wasn't a big deal.  Ultimately, when the bill came, each of the 7 of us owed well over $100 each.  None of us were prepared for that singular expense.  We handled it, but it did knock the wind out of our sails.  I know to many of you readers out there, you may be thinking that a $100 a person isn't a big deal, but to me and my group, it was a lot for one meal.  \n\nUltimately, it was very, very worth it.  The experience will stay with me forever.  And, it really WAS worth the large price tag.  I just wish we knew up front of the expense so it wouldn't have been such a shocker.\n\nI will be back again and again, as often as they will have me!  I'll just walk in knowing the operating system this time so I can navigate specific to my budget!", "author": "Melanie S."}

We then ordered a salad and the carpacio, which were both done very well.  For the entree, my husband and I decided to split the lobster and crab ravioli in a vodka cream sauce and the gnocchi in a truffle sauce.  Both dishes were very good, and we were stuffed.   \n\nConsistent with other reviews, we were given unlimited port wine and free tiramisu for dessert (my husband asked for the check, and they proceeded to give us two clean spoons and the tiramisu!).  I was also given a red rose on my walk out.  \n\nWhen we got the bill, there seemed to be an extra $8 charge, which I think explains the \"free\" bruschetta, tiramisu and unlimited port wine.

Their caviar & salmon appetizer is to die for - and they even gave us a little extra after I gushed about how good it was!

After about the 3rd time we asked if we could go ahead and order because we knew what to order for the people joining us. ( who by the way were no more than 10 min late). They then told us no, that we had to leave because there was a big party coming and our business was no longer required. Stunned, we asked again to just order and as the rest of our party was walking in we were escorted out by the owner. Who wasn't even apologetic. Horrible service.

The food, the experience, Lorenzo - all of these ingredients make for a fantastic meal. \n\nWhat a find! This restaurant is as quaint and charming as the surrounding neighborhood.   The ambience is cozy, warm and romantic.  My boyfriend and I sat at a corner table.  Dining by candlelight with rose petals on the table is a great way to end a long week, let me tell you.  Lorenzo, the owner and our waiter, was as cheerful and sunny as his bright yellow pants.  I don't think I have ever eaten at a restaurant where the owner greeted me, then walked outside to help my boyfriend find parking - an incredible act of kindness in a city where parking frustration can damper any activity. \n\nThe food was delicious.  We started with the lobster bisque and caprese salad.   The truffle oil on fresh mozzarella and tomatoes was to die for! The bisque was creamy and rich. My boyfriend ordered the filet, which came in a delicious sauce.  I ordered \"Willie Brown's favorite,\" which we now refer to as \"one of my favorite pasta dishes in the city.\" Tangy tomato sauce, chunks of Italian bacon and al dente rigatoni - fall comfort food, at its best. As a special surprise, Lorenzo brought out a delicious dessert plate with tiramisu, biscotti, and fresh strawberries with whipped cream.   The complimentary port was a nice touch too.  If the experience couldn't get any better, Lorenzo handed me a long stem pink rose at the end of our meal. \n\nIn the middle of the meal, they played \"That's Amore\" and the entire restaurant burst into song.  Lorenzo asked, \"Today is a special day - does anyone know what day it is?\" Fifteen minutes later, he answered, \"Its Friday!\" I found it to be truly refreshing to find a restaurant and staff that offer first class food yet do not take themselves too seriously. No pretentiousness here. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find great Italian food tucked away from the busy tourist traps in North Beach. Give it a try on a Friday night; reservations recommended.

Yes, there is free bruschetta and port and, sometimes, biscotti.  But, aside from the bruschetta, I probably wouldn't order it anyhow, so it's not such a huge deal.  The thing is, I feel like they make up for it in other ways.  I went there once with a pal and we ordered a carafe of the house red, thinking we were doing dinner on the cheap (for lushes).  I don't remember if we didn't see the price on the menu or if it wasn't there but, when the bill came, it was $36 (just for the wine).  Really?  Seems a scoche high for a carafe, hm?

I was here last night with a big birthday party, and we all had a phenomenal time. At first I was a little worried that our group would overpower the quaint restaurant. But with the gracious wait staff, Lorenzo dancing through the tables in his red and gold sneakers, rose petals and confetti adorning the tables, Sade's \"No Ordinary Love\" streaming through the speakers, and the parade of delicious food, Allegro Romano is a celebration all its own. By no means is any of this corny, rather you feel like you're having the best of times at a friend's dinner party in their comfortable Russian Hill home.\n\nThe food here is incredible. Simple Italian fare bursting with robust and memorable flavors. For appetizers, we had the beef and salmon carpaccio, fresh buffala mozzarella, and scallops risotto- all which tickled our palate and left us wanting more. And there was more, much much more. I had the fettuccine with lobster in a rustic tomato sauce. It was one of the specials of the night, and by lobster I don't mean a few petty clumps of meat scattered throughout your pasta. We're talking about half a lobster tail complete with a claw.  Some of the other favorites at the table were the gnocchi, home-made lobster and crab stuffed ravioli, salmon alla romano- actually forget it, everything that we ordered was fantastic.\n\nMany restaurants spend too much time and energy in their food and not enough in the dining experience. At Allegro Romano, it is obvious that the front of the house works just as hard as the back. I can not praise enough the outstanding level of service that we received from Lorenzo, his wife (or at least I think she's his wife), and the staff that tended to our every request before we even had to ask. Our glasses were always filled with their signature Chianti, the bread basket was always full, and the dirty plates were whisked away and replaced with clean ones before anyone even noticed. They even turned off the lights when the birthday cake was brought out and everyone participated in the birthday song and dance. Even though we got the cake from Cheesecake Factory, they courteously sliced and plated it for us, even adding a personal touch by sprinkling powdered chocolate on each plate. \n\nThere are many excellent restaurants in the City, but only a few who really put their heart into their food. Allegro Romano definitely has the soul that eludes so many of their competitors, not only because they play Sade and flatter you with roses at the end of the evening, but because it is very clear that they are truly passionate about Italian cooking and 100% committed to their clientele.", "author": "Alice P."}

Lobster Ravioli-Average at best.  Pasta didn't taste homemade, couldn't taste any lobster what so ever. Rigatoni all'Amatriciana was really good! The pancetta was almost smoky and a bit heavier than normal.  Really liked this dish. Finally, had the Tartufo and this was excellent as well.  Service is a bit fast, 8 different servers watching over you. Asked the first waiter for his favorites, 'everything is good' OK.... We called and got in with an early rez no problem same day.  I would compare this place to Trattoria Continda on Union. Free port after the meal is of course a nice touch along with the reasonable prices.  Glad we tried it but not a destination type place.", "author": "Tom W."}

When we sat down the owner greeted us and let us know the specials for the night.  He made a few recommendations off of the menu.  Which I always appreciate, because the menu can sometimes overwhelm me because it all looks so good.   \n\nWe split  the Carpaccio alla Romana and seasonal soup for appetizers, Fettuccine al Cinghiale e brodo di Porcini for the pasta course, and the Scaloppini con Porcini.  I can't pick just one, they were all fabulous!!!  Then to top it all off we had the tiramisu and their form of gelato.  When I tried both of these I thought I had died and gone to heaven or at least Italy.  In addition to all of this they gave us a free order of burschetta, port and rose at the end of the night.  I enjoy good food and good customer service. \n\nThe best part about this place is the price.  Every dish is below $20, I would pay more but what keeps me coming back is the affordability of this place.    I will be back many times to come.", "author": "Kirsten C."}

Will I ever make it in here?\n\nFlash back - walking home and decided to take Broadway up the hill.  Walked by this place - is this a restaurant?  Closed?  How is it possible that we never knew this place existed?  Note to self - look up in Yelp and come back to try.\n\nFast forward - enjoying a cold beer in North Beach at Boardroom one warm afternoon.  Started talking about restaurants and this was mentioned.  One of the patrons said it's a great place - I want to try but can never get in!  Turned to hubby and said \"let's just go there now and see if we can get in.\"  Off we go.  \n\nWe were brave...we decided to go straight up on Broadway and endure the steep hill and the 161 steps!  We tell ourselves that we can eat anything we want after this work out.  \n\nUpon reaching the top of the hill, the restaurant is right there across the street.  The owner in biking outfit was talking to two other bikers.  The place just opened up.  Hostess asked if we have reservation - no but we walked up 161 steps to come here!  Hostess asked owner and he said let them sit anywhere they want!\n\nWalked in and I see what others described.  Candlelight and rose petals...so romantic.  We chose the corner table at the very end where there's a curtain you can pull to get a little more privacy.  Given we were the first table, we had GREAT service.  I told them how I was never successful getting a reservation but now know the trick...come early!\n\nIt has been a while and I can't find my receipt but I recall the appetizer that we shared had risotto...after the first bite, I was absolutely in love.  Perfectly cooked risotto!  Imagine a mouthful of buttery flavored rice that melts in the mouth - yeah, that's how good it was.  \n\nFor entree, I had the special of the day - risotto with lobster tail.  Need I say more?  Cloud nine.  Hubby had the lamb chop and it was very good - it was tasty with just the right gamey flavor to it, which we both love.  \n\nThe owner suggested a bottle of red and decanter it for us - very good.  Again, the service was superb.  Our glass was always filled whenever it got low and the staff was never in your face...did everything very stealthily.\n\nA table of regular patrons came in and looked at our dishes.  They were especially interested in the lamb and ended up ordering it.  Friendly folks - thank us for recommending the dish to them.\n\nWe also had dessert but I forgot what.  As the night fell and the sky darkened, we can see a sliver of view from our seat...beautiful, it was truly a dreamy evening and one we'll happily repeat even if it means hiking up the 161 (owner claims 165) steps!\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be the perfect evening without the perfect rose.  Thank you, it was definitely worth the wait, the hike and the hype!", "author": "Gloria H."}

If you read the other reviews, you will see that everyone either loves Lorenzo or hates him.  Put me in the latter camp.  It was our wedding anniversary and we had made a reservation.  When we arrived, we were told by our hostess that we would have to wait for 5 or 10 minutes for a table to free up (this is a Very Small Place and table management must be a nightmare).  After 20 minutes of waiting in the doorway, during which Lorenzo greeted and seated several of his buddies who showed up without reservations, we finally asked him how much longer it would be, pointing out that the hostess had told us that the wait would be short (remember, we had a reservation and had told Lorenzo on the phone that it was our anniversary).  Lorenzo shot back that the hostess was not in charge of seating but that he, Lorenzo, would decide when we could sit.  At that point we would have walked out, but there are no other restaurants, public transportation or taxis nearby, so we were stuck.  Finally, we were seated by the hostess 40 minutes after our reservation time.  Although he spent a lot of time chatting with his friends at another table, never during our dinner did Lorenzo stop by to apologize or wish us happy anniversary.  It's a shame that Lorenzo is such a jerk, because the food was really very good.  But Lorenzo put us in such a bad mood on our anniversary night that the experience was ruined.  If you are a friend of Lorenzo, I'm sure you enjoy this place.  But if you are from out of town, do not go here.  SF has lots of other places with good food and a host who is not such a jerk.\n\n* * * * *\nPost-script, August 2:  Well, apparently, like the other Yelpers who have given this place one star due to the owner's rudeness, I have been tracked down by the owner.  He sent me this email after I posted my initial review (this is cut-and-paste; I'm not making it up):\n\n\"From the reviews you seem very  miserable and unhappy with you and the world,based in all your reviews you wrote.I am from Co too living in SF,you may  eat and  review McDonalds when you visit SF and  not the upscale restaurants of SF.\"\n\nYou be the judge.  I suppose if I was the only person to have had a bad experience, you could discount my views.  But if you sort the Yelp reviews for this place by stars and read the one-star ratings, you will see a scary pattern of rudeness and aggression.  Not only does Lorenzo treat his customers badly when they dine, he then tracks down and berates them when they have the courage to share their experiences.  This guy is a nut.

But I had to give props, in writing, after what happened on Friday night.\n\nAs expected, the four of us (two couples) had a fantabulous meal there that reminded me of the wonderful and quaint restaurants from my trip to Rome. We shared the scallop w/ risotto, bruschetta and beef carpaccio apps (all highly, highly recommended, but if you could only have one, go with the carpaccio). I had the scallopino, fiance and friend had the Willie Brown rigatoni, and friend's wife had the special pesto tortellini. Again, all were delicious. \n\nAnd then the complementary biscotti w/ whip (which I know they give you even if you don't order dessert, although we did this time) and of course the complementary bottomless port.\n\nBut here's where it gets crazy, over-the-top, can you believe they actually did this part -- so we cab it back to our 'hood all the way in SOMA and friend's wife realizes that she left her clutch back at the restaurant. We knew they were closed by now since we were the last ones there but we tried calling anyway. And what did they do?\n\nTHE OWNER DROVE HIS PRIUS AND BROUGHT IT TO THE BAR WE WERE AT AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR PAD. IN SOMA. \n\n(And keep in mind that it's not like we're \"regulars\" or that we acted like we were worthy of that type of awesome treatment, i.e., we didn't tip 50% or anything like that.)\n\nSo here's the deal -- 5 stars for the restaurant, which includes food, service, ambiance, etc. etc. Another 5 stars for the oh-no-they-didn't (but in a good way) hospitality. \n\nNow THAT is the epitome of going the extra mile. \n\nOkay, so just so I'm being fair, there are a couple items to note that have really nothing to do with the restaurant, but that you should know if you're thinking of going there. (1) No parking. Cab it. Bus it. Walk it. But do NOT drive it. Yes, the owner saves some spots in front of the restaurant for his patrons, but you don't want to chance that it'll be available. (2) Not on OpenTable. But then, if they were, it'd probably be harder to get a reservation than it is now. And if you leave a message with your reservation info, make sure to call back to confirm.\n\nThe End. Still giving the place TEN freaking stars.", "author": "Veronica S."}

We read the yelp reviews and were so excited to try it.  It sounded like my type of place: unpretentious, hearty, tasty food, and a charming owner who seemed destined to become a close friend.  In the end, we were very disappointed, and both agreed we don't want to go back.\n\nFirst, the owner would only give us a reservation at 6pm, he said that was the only table he had all night.  It was friday night so I took the reservation, but when we got there it was clear that this was not the only available table.  The restaurant was completely empty the entire time we were there (6-7:30), except for an elderly couple and a couple with a very loud baby. Needless to say the atmoshphere was not great: half staff meeting, half toddler daycare, but mostly just totally empty!!! (Really, we couldn't have come in at 6:30? 7?)\n\nWe found the owner to be pretty rude. When we first walked in, he yelled to the hostess from outside to stop (she was directing us to a corner booth), and had us stand in the middle of the restaurant while he came in and put us at the worst table, right by the entrance to the back.  Then he proceeded to comment and sort of complain to the staff about different parties and reservations they had for the night. After listening to the owner bitch, (so awkward)... he took our order, (literally we both felt nervous by that point) and then rudely asked for our IDs when we ordered wine, really bizarre.  \n\nWe ordered the ceaser salad with crab, beef carpaccio, the famous crab and lobster ravioli, and the scallopini. Uh, the beef carpaccio was really good, the salad was just OK, the crab tasted really fishy. The ravioli was totally ordinary (I prefer many of the pre-made ones you can get at TJs). I'm really confused as to what the reviews raved about. The scallopini was barely average too, with mashed potatoes and boring steamed vegetables.\n\nOn a positive note, the tables were creatively decorated, the chef sent out a free strawberry desert and the busboy gave me a pretty rose from the centerpiece.  Clearly, the staff takes care to make the restaurant a special place.  \n\nHowever, the food was really average, the owner hostile (or maybe in a bad mood, or we somehow offended him?)....It definitely wasn't the special, delicious experience I expected.

The service is excellent, but European which means you are not rushed, the server takes his time, your food isn't rushed out, you have time to digest and you need to ask for your bill when you are ready.\n\nThe food is great - I went with a group so I was able to try a lot of different things - the tomato soup is more like a past sauce with chunks of tomato in it rather than traditional tomato soup - it is good, just different.  The gnochi with gorgonzola is excellent but so rich - I only had a few bites and ended up with an upset stomach that night.  The BF had the whole thing as his entree and his stomach is still upset!  Willie Brown's favorite pasta was really good - it is rigatoni with a red sauce, - it was probably my favorite.  The lobster and crab ravioli was also good but too rich for me.  The veal scallopini - also good.  I got the risotto with scallops in a balsamic glaze which I thought was fantastic.  \n\nService was great - very friendly and chatty.  We asked for a sangiovesse wine and tried to order one of the menu but the owner insisted we try a special reserve sangiovesse which we all loved.  He also came around at the end of the meal to share some port with us and brought out a plate of biscotti on the house.  Truly great service and a cute little neighborhood gem.  All of this food - two apps, and a few salads for $45 per person including tip (great deal - and lots of food!).\n\nEven though it is a teeny tiny restaurant, they can accommodate groups pretty well.

It's a really small casual/ find dining (depends how you want to dress and it's really either/ or), and the owner is always around taking good care of you.\n\nI went there with hubby on V-day, and it was the most economic v-day dinner we've ever had.  The food is not pricey at all, and it's very delicious. I think its pasta is the most popular dish. Before I went there, many of my friends were all raving about the pasta, and when I was there, I saw almost every table had at least 1 dish of pasta on top of the entre. And it's true, the pasta was GREAT!!  Especially its Fetuccini w/ white Truffle.... mmmmm..... ahhhhh... droooollllll....\n\nI thought Allegro's meat entre was just so-so, but hubby said it was very special. He thought, many places have very tasty meat entres, but after a while, the entre becomes too greasy or, just too much. But Allegro's meat entre, in the beginning you might think it's not tasty enough, but the more you eat it, the more the taste gets in your mouth. He thought the sauce was especially great.\n\nSo, good food and more than reasonable price, what more can you ask for? \n\nNow, I have to give you the other side of this restaurant. The location is just awful. It is extremely hard to find parking, or maybe just b/c we went on the wrong day and time. The 1st time we went there, it was v-day but our reservation was @ 5:30pm, and it was a Wednesday. No one was home yet so there were plenty of parkings. The 2nd time we went, it was St. Paddy's day, and probably everyone was home getting drunk. OMG. We couldn't find parking for 2 frigging hours, hubby drove a manual and his left foot was cramping, and we were so hungry that we could eat our fists, so we gave up and had Chinese--com'on, fast always-- instead.  Man, you tell me that you won't give up after driving a manual in that hilly area in SF for 2 hours. And you know those cars aren't leaving b/c they are hella drunk in the house!!!\n\nMy suggestion is, you either go early on weekdays and weekends, or you take public transportation.

As the other reviewers say, it's great option for dinner with parents, a date, or out of towners.  To find only three other Yelp reviews is really quite surprising.\n\nOverall the food is good, with a few amazing items.  My favorite dish by far was the Carpaccio alla Romana (thinly sliced beef w/ shaved aged Parmesan cheese, arucola & truffle oil).  The different flavors and textures were incredible.  Other starters (Buffalo Mozzarella Caprese, Garbanzo Soup, and Bruschetta) were pleasing but did not reach that same \"oh my god\" status.\n\nOn to the mains, the fettuccine with the white truffle oil was the other big winner of the evening.  It was rich, creamy, and full of flavor.  I chose the lamb chops, one of the nightly specials.  The four nice-sized chops came cooked medium rare just as I like it - definitely a solid effort from the kitchen.  I also sampled the salmon, which arrived with spinach and mashed potatoes, as well as the halibut.  Again, both were solid but not spectacular.  \n\nDessert.  The tiramisu was nicely presented with four pieces of chocolate dipped biscotti.  A good way to end a good meal.                         \n\nService was engaging.

I discovered this place one late Friday night with a guy I was dating at the time. He'd gotten off work late, and while he was starving, I was good for dessert. As this place was just up the next block from my house, it made perfect sense to try. \n\nIt was 9:30 p.m., and I figured we'd go in for a nice sherry and dessert. However, my companion needed more sustenance, so he ordered the LOBSTER AND CRAB RAVIOLIS. I was a little nervous to be ordering a main course so close to closing time, but the waiter (who turned out to be the owner) graciously accepted my date's order for his meal. Our dessert order for the Tiramisu (I'm such a HUGE fan) and Chocolate Truffle Ice Cream were placed at the same time. We also ordered a glass, each, of a nice Dry Sherry.\n\nThe raviolis came out first, and as they smelled so good, I could not help but steal a bite of one. So, delicious. Served in a lovely pink vodka sauce, it was a perfect pairing for the succulent lobster and crab. I must say, it's the BEST pink sauce I've ever tasted.\n\nThe desserts were lovely in presentation on clean white plates and accent sauces. The TIRAMISU was very good. (If you're looking for the BEST Tiramisu - check out E'Angello) The Chocolate Truffle Ice Cream was so nice and creamy. A lovely rich taste that also manages to be delicate.\n\nThe Sherry was FANTASTIC. The owner, serving us himself, brought out the bottle, and actually left it for us on the next table. It complimented the desserts quite well. I can't say I can take credit for the pairing, as we asked for a recommendation and the owner made a perfect decision.\n\nSo, having arrived near closing time (posted as 10:00 p.m.), I figured the owner or staff would give us hints and ques to hurry up. It was pleasant that they cleared tables around us, ate their group meal together - at the front of the restaurant and far from us, and finished up in the kitchen without so much as a glance in our direction. \n\nThe staff left, and the owner approached our table at well past closing time. I figured we were to be asked to leave. To my incredible SUPRISE, we were handed a phone and informed to push TALK, then REDIAL to call his number.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-10-22", "description": "The place had such promise - and I was SO excited to try it based on reviews and just passing by it for the past year and a half, but sadly some of the decisions that the management made ended up affecting my overall opinion - and let's be honest, the food is good - but it's not at all deserving of a five star or even four star on yelp.\n\nFirst - ambience is AMAZING.  So fun, cute and everything.  Fun music, very attentive bussers, rose petals and confetti on the table - very fun.  At one point the owner even turned the music up and encouraged people to sing and dance - it was definitely fun to watch (though turning the lights completely out while we were trying to eat was definitely interesting).\n\nSo, onto the food.  First, they took forever to take our wine order.  Whatever, got over it, because we finally got it and it was for a friend's birthday so it was fine to have a leisurely italian meal.\n\nThen, we were asked (after ordering our entrees) whether we wanted to order appetizers for the table.  We answered yes - thinking he would note how much we had all ordered as entrees and not overdo it on appetizers.  We were grossly mistaken - every single appetizer on his menu came out (aside from brsuchetta, which I would have liked...).  These were:\n\nAsparagus w/ parmasen (OMG AMAZING you must try!)\nTomatoes with mozz and seasonings (definitely recommended)\nMelon w/ proscuitto (ok - the melon was so sweet, i'm just not a fan of this dish)\nCarpaccio (seemed good - not a huge fan of carpaccio)\nPate (didn't try)\n\nThen we got entrees too.  The boyfriend and I shared the filet and the crab/lobster ravioli.  To be honest, the filet wasn't very good - stringy actually (which filets should not be) so clearly wasn't the best quality meat.  And the ravioli, though the pink sauce was excellent, was a little too fishy and therefore not fresh.\n\nLast, and the main gripe I have about this place, is that, although it was my friend's birthday, it should ALWAYS be a restaurant's policy to check in w/ a table prior to sending non-comped desserts to the table.  ESPECIALLY if the desserts total $60!  Not impressed.  Bad business, and definitely won't be returning.", "author": "Jen L."}

The clientele seems to be primarily from the neighborhood (which makes sense given the location and lack of parking) which creates a nice ambiance.\n\nThe food was good but not amazing.  The sauces tend to be a little too thick, the flavors a little too bland and the presentation a little too disheveled to be great.

The service was excellent!  Seriously, 5 stars for service.  The staff was attentive and friendly and even helped our friends find parking in the neighborhood!

We also ordered the melon and prosciutto (which was gorgeous), the bruschetta (very yum) and the salmon carpaccio (awesome -- you must order -- the salmon was basically cooked in the lemon juice and very flavorful).  Instead of oil and vinegar, they have this dipping paste -- not sure what it is, but it tastes a little of anchovies and is pretty addicting.\n\nI started with the lobster bisque, which was rich and flavorful.  I doubled up on the lobster and ordered the special homemade fettucine with lobster, which was a bit on the salty side but otherwise, very tasty with good size chunks of lobster.  My boyfriend ordered the tortellini with white truffle oil and pesto.  I had a bite and it was also very good.\n\nWe were all stuffed so didn't order dessert, but they brought out some complimentary dessert and port for us for the birthday celebration, which I thought was a very nice touch.  \n\nWe ordered 3 bottles of wine off the menu, all of which were good and reasonably priced.\n\nI really wish I lived in the neighborhood so I could come here more often.

My boyfriend got the rigatoni (Willie Brown's Favorite) and the sauce was like nothing I've tasted before.  Truly delicious.  Our tiramisu was good, and we ended the meal with the free port.  Prices were reasonable too with appetizers around $12, pasta dishes ~$15, and meat/poultry dishes ~$23.  It was around $90 for two people including a carafe of wine.\n\nThe service was fantastic and extremely attentive.  The owner makes sure you're happy and that you're not left wanting anything.

I was in San Francisco for the weekend with my girlfriend and I was planning on proposing to her on Friday. At first, I planned on going up to Twin Peaks overlooking the city to actually propose, but once we got up there it was so freakin cold and windy I backed out. So I made an impromptu reservation at Allegro Romano based on some yelp reviews and when I got there I explained to the manager and waiters that I needed them to bring out the engagement ring when I requested dessert. After we had an awesome three course meal the sun finally set and the romantic vibe of the restaurant surely came to life. The rose petals and candles on the tables and the quaint cute vibe of the whole restaurant was just perfect. So, I finally requested dessert and when it was ready the waiter came to my table and said \"the restroom is ready for you. Can you come with me\" Ha..my gf was really confused... I get to the back where they had the ring set up on a plate surrounded by more rose petals, candle lights and some tiramisu....At that point and unexpectedly they turned off the lights to the entire restaurant, dinged a wine glass to get everyone's quiet attention and then it was my turn to walk out and ask for my girlfriend's hand in marriage in front of everyone on one knee.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-16", "description": "For my 100th review, I wanted to review something fabulous, and my husband and my dining experience at Allegro Romano definitely fit the bill. I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars. Usually when this happens, I round up, because I just tend to be generous. But, we a hiccup with making reservations for this place, so I rounded down this time. We called early in the week to make reservations for the Saturday at 7:30. We left this on their answering machine as per the instructions recorded on the machine. We never heard back, so we called several times, hoping to get in touch with them to confirm the reservations, but no one answered. Finally, on Friday, I called again, and spoke with someone. He was really nice, but said they had no record of our reservations. Frustrating! Luckily, they had an opening at 8pm, which worked fine,  but it was not the smoothest reservation-making process. That being said... I see why this place has an overall rating of 4.5 stars. By the end of our meal, we didn't even remember the problem with the reservations!\n\nWe walked in and were allowed to pick a table from a choice of three--we chose one in the back corner, next to the window, so we were able to sit next to each other. Very romantic. The petals and sparkles on the table were a very sweet, Valentines-like touch. We brought a bottle of wine, and it was opened immediately (and poured into a decanter--wonderful!). The corkage was only $15. What a great price! We could not decide on an appetizer because we wanted to try everything truffle on the menu.  While we were deciding , they sent us out 2 pieces of bruschetta, compliments of the chef, which is always apprecaited! We settled on two appetizers--a beef carpaccio in truffle oil, which was unbelievably delicious, and the scallops with risotto with some truffle in there somewhere, which was also tastey... but we could not taste the truffle too much, which was a bit disappointing. Still, it was really yummy. \n\nFor our entrees, we decided to split two dishes. We ordered fettuccine with truffle sauce, which honestly had the best sauce I have ever tasted ($18). I was a little concerned because it was only pasta with sauce--but the sauce was so rich and flavorful, I think adding anything else to the pasta would have taken away from this. It was so so good! We also got a special of tortellinis stuffed with white truffle in a basil pesto sauce ($18). I really enjoyed this dish, but it was difficult to taste the truffle. The pesto sauce was delicious, but overpowered the light truffle taste. Again, though, the dish was tastey. If I hadn't been expecting more truffle flavor, I would have loved it! Overall, the entrees were satisfying and SO filling! Typically, my husband can eat his own appetizer, an entree, whatever I don't finish of my entree, and dessert. This meal, somehow, filled us both up SO much. We did not even have room for dessert (which NEVER happens)!! \n\nAfter we declined dessert, they brought out the port--complimentary, of course. Uh oh, look out for the porto! My husband is not a huge fan of port, so drank his glass quickly. They immediately refilled it. I drank mine... and they refilled it. I drank some of my husband's so it would look like he was appreciating the free wine... and they refilled it. We, I kid you not, sat there for over an hour drinking porto. It was absolutely amazing, and it was so much fun. I have been to a lot of nice dinners, and cannot remember having more fun. They also brought us a complimentary dessert of strawberries and biscotti. We were so full... but somehow ate it :). \n\nThe service was so incredible. The servers were all extremely attentive--our wine glasses and water glasses were never low or empty. They were so friendly and cheerful. Honestly, some of the best service I have experienced. The owner was also present and talkative--I really liked him. The bathroom is also nice, which is just important to note. \n\nAllegro Romano gave my husband and I one of the best dining experiences we have had in the city. I cannot WAIT to go back. Maybe this weekend...", "author": "Bridgette A."}

We were welcomed in, seated at a table festively decorated with rose-petals, and I was called 'Bella' by the stereotypically Italian waitstaff.  We opened up presents from my boy, and when mine turned out to be a pop-up book of sex, the waitstaff joined in our rowdiness.  I felt no airs of pretentiousness here, even though the price of the food could totally make this restaurant choose that type of atmosphere.\n\nThe quality of the food was good too.  For my entree I had the chicken saltimbocca, and it was grubbin.  Perfectly cooked, nicely presented.  The desserts here were also just great.\n\nAnd to top it all off, they give all the ladies in the party a rose upon their departure.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-08", "description": "Before I go into how yummy the food and great the ambiance is, two simple notes to those who will be new to the place:\n\n1. they have a tendency to place non-comped food, not ordered by the table (like dessert) which can be quite expensive - $60!  So be sure to ask about how much it costs before you decide whether to dig in.  Saves the nasty surprise when the bill arrives.\n\n2. Get a price on the house wine before ordering.  You would think that a carafe of house wine would be reasonably priced, but they can be pricey and it may be better to order the entire bottle of a nicer wine.\n\nIf the food were less fantastic, I would not eat here.  But truly the food is magnificent.  The best Italian I have ever had.  Perfectly al dente pasta, incredible sauces......all in all, exceptionally flavorful food.\n\nIt does have a cute ambiance with rose petals sprinkled on the white tablecloth.

You will walk out of here simply amazed. The bruschetta and the mozzarella caprese is a great way to start the meal. I had the rigatoni (Willie Brown's favorite- yes, it was noted on the menu) which I enjoyed so much that I scarfed down the entire thing before anyone else finished their dishes. There was a moment where I looked around and wondered why I was almost done and everyone was still working. It was sinful.

Overall these two were 3.5 stars - I found the fish to be a bit salty for my taste and the wild boar ragout with the Bolognese was a bit overcooked, otherwise decent. Tratufo for dessert was very good and their cappuccino at the end of the meal, along with the free port was a good close to the evening.

Allegro Romano. \" Well, last night me and the girls decided to give his \"little Italian restaurant\" a try (and it is indeed little, hella little. Do make reservations). Suffice it to say, that major side eye I threw him so many months ago turned into a bug eye as I started off my meal with the Crepes al Caviar and Salmon. All I can say about them is that they are THEBOMB.COM! Everything we ordered was so dayum tasty. From the Rigatoni Pasta with Foie Gras (better get yours before the July 1st CA. foie gras ban) to the tiny biscotti that came with our homemade gelato; everything was a hit. Absolutely no misses. And we weren't the only ones who thought so. The man at the table next to us spent most of his meal moaning and panting about how good it was.

Kudos to the Chef and owner Lorenzo. He is quite a personality and very passionate about his restaurant. This is probably one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to outside Italy. The food, wine, ambience, service, even prices- everything was great. I rarely write rave reviews, but this one is totally worth it. They use freshest, mostly local ingredients, with some Italian imports. We had bruschetta, beef carpaccio, asparagus with pecorino and parmesan butter sauce, and caesar salad with Dungeness crab meat (a nod to Northern California cuisine) for starters- all very good. Carpaccio was just the right balance of paper thin Black Angus beef, fresh arugula, aged parmesan and olive with a dash of truffle. Ask for their special (not on the menu)- home made fettuccine with generously shaved fresh white Piedmont truffle, it was fabulous. I love truffles and this was a real deal. They shave it right in front of you, but you may not be able to get it every day (only when Lorenzo has fresh supply). It's more expensive than other pasta dishes, but is totally worth it. Also tried lobster ravioli with vodka pink sauce- very delicate flavor. House wines are decent quality Pinot Grigio (i think they have other varietals as well) and Chianti, served in a carafe. Leave some room for desserts, they are equally amazing. We had homemade tiramisu. Finished off with biscotti and port on the house, and espresso. Grazie mille, Lorenzo.

It's my last night of visiting from out of town and I wanted something quaint and local that wasn't a tourist hot spot or a $7 grill. \n\nAllegro hit the spot in many ways. I called ahead and the owner said the place was full, but said okay when I mentioned I was just one. I showed up a tad early and had to wait 8-9 minutes for a table to open. Waiting is awkward because there is NO room in this place. It's literally a long living room turned into a restaurant. So I had to stand by the front door like an uninvited guest at a party for a little while. But I was a tad early after all and a table did open up so he kept his word about being busy, but being able to get me in.\n\nAfter reading all the reviews I was a little paranoid that they would hover over me trying to stuff massive amounts of food down my throat. (I hate that)  It ended up not being the case for me. I was given all the little extras that people mention and it was nice, but these are small things and not over whelming by any means. I ordered the lobster & Crab Ravioli and the portion was perfect. Not too much, not too little. It was a great meal. The sauce and flavor were delicious. I cleaned my plate and started soaking up the sauce with the extra bread. \n\nThe owner buzzed about the room just like everyone mentions. I thought it was charming and he didn't seem to be over bearing. I was nearly completely ignored by comparison to the other tables which I found interesting. I don't know if it was because I was a lone diner or maybe he doesn't like tall bald white guys :) I wouldn't have minded accept for the fact that it got a little ridiculous to where I was feeling like a ghost waiting for my check.\n\nOverall, I would go back and I would recommend this place to others for sure.

At no point did we feel rushed.  At no point were we pressured to order our next course.  At no point did we not thoroughly enjoy ourselves.  Add to that the fact that our entire bill came to $89/each, plus tip (which we decided should be at least 25%, rounded up) and I was starting to be seriously impressed.  We both rolled out for $114 each, or $30/hour, or $0.00035 per calorie - a bargain by any measure.  All of it was delicious, though for me the stand-out was the tiramisu.  Seriously not to be missed.  I'm not sure if it was the wine that preceded it, but I was just looking about the table wide-eyed throughout the dessert course, deciding whether my next move should be toward the tiramisu, cappuccino, or port.  (Spoiler alert: I was never unhappy with my decision, nor could I have been.)\n\nBut what really made me love this place wasn't the food, nor the value, nor the adorable waiter.  What made me love this place was that, for a little over 3 hours, I felt like I was in Italy again.  By American standards, the service is just so-so.  Don't expect to have your food cleared the second you're done, and don't expect the order for your next course to be taken the second you look up for a waiter (though for patrons who'd prefer it, the staff seemed to catch that vibe quickly).  By Italian standards, the service was perfect.\n\nAt the end of our meal, the owner helped me and my friend on with our coats, gave us 2 roses each (since we'd not been given one while still seated) and offered to hail us cabs.

I came across Allegro randomly and could not have been happier with our evening.\n  As I mentioned we were celebrating, but had not announced our anniversary to the restaurant in hopes of getting something for free or special treatment, yet ALL we got was special treatment.  The owner was dressed to impress and helped us a choose a phenomenal wine for dinner.  The service was impeccable with my water glass never empty,  and when my lover gave me his anniversary gift, our waiter discreetly leaned in to ask the occasion, and later surprised us with a complimentary desert, perfect glasses of port, and even a rose for me.  Could this place be any more precious??!?!?!?!?\n  We plan on going back for sure, and not just for special occasions, this place does everything right, and I would highly recommend Allegro to anyone!!", "author": "Alicia Claire H."}

While the staff could not have been more welcoming and friendly, the food  was disappointing.  To start, the bread was unimpressive and the suggested dipping oil should be avoided.   The spinach salad with bacon was heavy and overkill on the cheese.   We ordered the pasta alla amatriciana which was al dente but over-sauced.  This dish traditionally uses pancetta, but I suspect bacon was used instead and the pasta was drowned in sauce, American style.  Every dish was served with a heavy sprinkling of parsley, which was out of character for allegedly Roman-style Italian food. The scallopini was tough, thick, and tasted like cleanser.  It was unclear whether it was chicken or veal.  The menu is confused and offers a smattering of American favorites and does not offer any well-executed classic Roman dishes.  Save your money and go to Rome.", "author": "Erika T."}

I don't think I've ever dined at a restaurant with so much personality in my entire life.\n\nGUYS: if you're looking for a quiet, private dining experience this may not be the place to bring a date.... but otherwise exquisitely romantic in that fun, cheesy way. trust me.", "author": "Michelle I."}

The reviews on Yelp were glowing, and I was excited about having a wonderful celebratory dinner with my sweetheart.  First off, Lorenzo is terrific.  After circling the restaurant (desperately looking for parking), we pulled into the next-door neighbor's driveway to let the restaurant know we were searching for a parking space.  The neighbor graciously let us park in her driveway and Lorenzo volunteered to move our car when the neighbor needed to get into their garage.  What service!  I was amazed and thrilled at this kind of attention.  Yes, Lorenzo is a master in front of the house.  Unfortunately, I wish he had spent time in the back of the house....\nWe started off with their classc ceasar salad with dungeness crab meat.  The salad was served too cold, masking the taste of the crab and the dressing.  We had high hopes for the Scaloppini con Porcini, which contrary to the menu description, was not \"a piece of heaven\".  The sauce was salty, the mushrooms rubbery, and the veal tough.   Tiramisu for dessert was forgettable, 'though I must say the gratis after-dinner port was a nice touch.\nSo, all in all, I wish the food would have matched  Lorenzo's enthusiasm.", "author": "Dennis S."}

We have had bad luck with Italian restaurants for months but decided to try Allegro Romano based on some friends recommendation. \n\nWe had an 8 o'clock reservation but got there extremely early. I expected to wait especially after seeing how small this place was (11 or 12 tables). Lorenzo, whom despite reading some negative reviews on here after the fact, was very nice and sat us right away. The menu is not very large but they appear to make everything very well. \n\nFor appetizer I ordered the Cesar salad with Dungeness Crab which was very good. The crab was fresh and the salad was very enjoyable. If I had any recommendation would be to add slightly more dressing to the salad. This is my only \"negative\" comment. \n\nMy entree was homemade tortellini with a pesto sauce and truffle oil. Amazingly good! There is no replacement for homemade pasta and the sauce was incredible. \n\nFor dessert I ordered Tiramisu which was so light and refreshing. Incredible! \n\nI am a very picky person when it comes to food and eating out. Not only does the food have to be enjoyable, but the service has to be great as well. I don't mind mistakes as long as they are acknowledged and taken care of. Luckily there were no mistakes and we received plenty of attention. Only 12 tables in the place and 5 people working those tables. \n\nAfter the meal the waiter brought over some port for my wife and I. After that glass, came another glass, and another, and another. You get the idea. I stopped at 7 glasses and they would have given me more if I didn't stop them. All of this was on the house. Also included was another dessert which was homemade biscotti's with strawberries and cream. After I informed the crew of my pleasant experience and informed them it was our anniversary, out came another dessert. \n\nAnytime I have a great time from top to bottom, I have to write about it.", "author": "Raymond S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-14", "description": "I very seldom write reviews; however, I wanted to share Allegro Romano. I found this restaurant on Yelp and we really loved it.  My wife and I are not gourmets but my wife is very particular, knows what she likes and tends to be a bit critical. There are not many restaurants that she states emphatically that she would definitely come back. Allegro Romano is now on that short list for sure. Our first two courses were spectacular. The Caesar salad with crabmeat was outstanding. Generous amount of crab, crisp lettuce. Very tasty. The appetizer size risoto with black truffles was beyond belief. I have walked throughout Umbria and eaten the local truffle dishes in Norcia. This was better. As I said, I am no gourmet but the richness of this dish was incomparable. If we stopped here it would be 5 star all the way. For our four friends it was. They had the Branzino, red snapper and Dover sole. My wife and I had the veal. I had veal scalopini which was tasty but the veal was just a tiny bit tough. I do not blame the chef because the price was very fair for this veal. It did not chew as a top cut (but it was not priced as such).  The flavor was good. My wife had the veal with the porcini mushrooms. She did not comment on the texture but she did say the sauce was not very distinctive; it lacked a little character.   She felt it needed something more to enhance the veal.  There was a very nice wine list but our group was not real drinkers so we had a modest bottle of pinot grigio which was fine.  Next time, more serious wines.\n\nNow about the ambience and staff.   The restaurant is located in a residential area.  It is cozy and probably seats about 35 people.  It is a welcoming place and even when full is not overly noisy.  The staff was wonderful; gracious and very accommodating.  We had this wonderful table in the front window. The table decor with the rose pedals was a lovely touch. The intimacy of the restaurant was a big plus and the bathroom was different and fun (as bathrooms go). Again, wonderful staff; wonderful ambience; good to great food.  Well priced.

All the waiters and waitresses were on top of our shoulders not allowing us to breathe or move without feeling like they were watching and judging our every single move!!!!! And this lorenzo guy is absolutely horrible!!!! NOt only did he not welcome us into the restaurant but he was very rude, giving dirty looks, huffing and puffing at us and demanding our children to sit with major attitude!!! he was whispering and pointing at us like he just wanted us to get the hell out of his restauarant because we were a party of 7! and when the food came it was alllrrriiighhhht nothing spectacular at all!! it was also very obvious they were trying to clean the table so quick and refill our drinks so fast and inclduing themselves in our conversations it was just the worst experience i have had thus far in san francisco! And get this when we asked for the check the waitress literally shoved the check right under my face before i even finished asking for it!!!!!!!! I was shocked i just wanted to get the hell out of there! So as we are getting off the table to leave the coke spilled on the table and came on to my helmut lang pants!! I then started wiping and all i hear is LORENZO the sleezeball laughing and pointing with this waiters saying ahhahahahah me gusta me gusta!

She left a message three days before asking for a 7.00 pm reservation. She then called the day before to confirm, but was told there was only an 8.00 pm slot. No problem for us, so we show up. I was a bit suspicious when I saw all the photos of famous people who have eaten there, but thought, well the owner probably likes to bask in the reflected glory of the celebrities. We show up, and there is no reservation. There was no \"sorry, we will see what we can do\", or anything of the sort. Some guy in a t-shirt with a shaved head (kind of Mission wannabe) seemed to be in charge, and completely ignored us. The poor hostess was out of her league, dealing with such a jerk. We finally left and went to Rue St Jacques at Taylor and Jackson. it was excellent - warm greeting, great food (try the beef!) and a small bet very well chosen wine list with several good choices at moderate prices. Initially I was very disappointed with Allegro Romano, but Rue St. Jacques more than made up for it.  Also in the neighborhood is Venticello, a fun Northern Italian place, and the Nob Hill Cafe, consistently good food in a casual setting. ONE WEEK LATER - This guy is a complete crackpot! Today he sent me an illegible email ranting, dropping names (misspelled) of people who have never eaten there or heard of him. I talked to a couple of people in our neighborhood who basically said \"Oh yeah, that's how it can be there - why didn't you ask us before you went?\". Lesson learned.

It's like they had one waiter assigned to each table, and the owner, Lorenzo, is always walking around making sure everything is up to standard. \nOur party ordered several of every appetizer on the menu, and none of them were a disappointment. The beef carpaccio is the best I've ever had, and we also had a homemade mortadella and salami which were flavored to perfection. The asparagus was delicious also... \nFor the main entree, I had the Rigatoni alla Amatriciana (Willy Brown's favorite, haha) which was perfectly cooked and flavored.

Well, they were right, and last night was one of the best dining experiences I've had in San Francisco --- and I've lived in the Bay Area almost my entire life.\n\nOur reservation was on the early side and so when we first arrived, the place was fairly empty.  The host Lorenzo let us choose which table covered in rose petals we wanted for our own.  My brother's rigatoni and bacon dish, \"Willie Brown's favorite,\"  was my favorite as well.  Not only was the food authentic Italian, but so was the host. Lorenzo let us stay at our table for 3 hours without bringing the bill until we asked.  He brought out roses for my mom and me, three rounds of dessert, and kept our wine glasses full- all for no extra charge.

The customer service is A+ they're very attentive and make sure they tend to your needs. One of the many reasons we wanted to come here was to try their tartufo which is world famous it is an Italian ice cream that was invented by the family of the person who owns Allegro Romano and he has incorporated it in his menu, the reason I didn't give them five stars was because I actually had a better tartufo in New York I don't know how that was possible but the day i visited the tartufo tasted a bit like Hagan Dazs Ice Cream. The food however is amazing It is a four course menu like all Italian restaurants so make sure you come prepared to spend a big amount. We had brushetta, crepes filled with salmon topped with caviar and a very delicious truffle sauce and the beef carpaccio as our appetizers for our pasta course we had scallops with the squid ink risotto the squid ink adds a very distinct taste but makes it that much better for the secondi course we had the salmon with capers and mashed potatoes the salmon was medium rare and very juicy the capers tied in make the taste very special, the veal topped with the prosciutto and bathed in white wine was delicious. another desert I ordered was the chocolate mousse cake which was a lot tastier than the tartufo at the end when we were about to leave the owner handed me a rose which was a very sweet gesture that they do for they're customers I can say that I will be coming here again.", "author": "Juliette P."}

But, the cheesiness is endearing and particularly after a glass of their house red (phenomenal - just like ordering the house red in Italy) it actually becomes rather charming.\n\nAs for the food, it's solid Italian.  Although I thought their bruscetta could have been improved if the bread was still warm, the tomatoes were fresh and perfectly seasoned.  My hubby ordered the caprese which is difficult to mess up but also hard to stand out - although the pesto olive oil drizzle did make it more unique than others I've had in the city.\n\nFor the main course I had the Lobster Fetticini special in a roasted tomato sauce.  They were generous with the lobster and the fetticini was house-made.   Although I don't think the pasta itself was quite as good as Milano's, the dish was satisfying and tasted exactly like you'd expect - in a good way.\n\nMy husband ordered the steak which he gushed over, I think even claimed was the best italian steak he's ever had.  From this dish alone, he'd give the restaurant 5 stars.  I'm not a steak girl, but the bite I was able to negotiate off his plate was juicy and full of flavor - and not surprising it was so small.  \n\nThe chocolate tiramisu was absolutely amazing - a must order.  Perfectly traditional in execution, with the extra flare of chocolate powder on top.  \n\nAll in all - quirky and cozy with traditional and well executed Italian fare.

I wouldn't recommend the tiramisu to be honest. The port however, is a different story. At this point we had been eating for around 2 hours.

Needless to say, this fit the bill. I love the location, away from the hustle and bustle and parking seemed decent (at least when I was there) on a Friday night. The decor is nice, though I must admit a bit cheesy, almost North Beach-y, with rose pedals on the table. It has sort of a \"Valentine's Day everyday\" feel but I was able to move past that when the food arrived. Bruschetta, good but nothing to write home about...on to the main course. It must be said, I'm a sucker for pasta, but I'm a HUGE sucker for truffle oil and if you share my love, then this is most definitely the place to go, as several dishes are prepared with it. I decided to try the Fettuccine with White Truffle Sauce- to die for! Fabulous! I also managed to sneak a bite of the Lobster and Crab Ravioli with Vodka sauce from my fellow diner's plate- also very good, though it could have used another ravioli or two. We finished off the night with the Chocolate Tiramisu. I'm generally not a big fan of tiramisu but this was great! It came on a huge platter which led me to believe they'd somehow mistaken and served us the whole dessert tray, but no, it was just the tiramisu with warm chocolate sauce and a very generous display of strawberries surrounding it. Mmmm! Wonderful. Service, however, also failed in my book. The owner (well, what I assume was the owner) completely ignored us and spent our entire dining experience talking to a large group towards the front.

If you see that your diners want to talk and catch up, please stop asking them questions every three minutes. It was mind boggling to me. The starters were not so great -  the bruschetta amuse-bouche had probably been sitting around awhile (mushy bread soaked all the way through) and the tomatoes in the caprese didn't taste fresh/were of poor quality.

The ID check was really brusque, which pretty much summed up the whole experience. Since I basically only eat Italian food and I rarely stray from the city, I'm used to either bubbly, overdone super-friendly service or quiet, welcoming, formal dining service. This was more like I'd-like-to-get-you-people-out-of-here service, which actually really can damper an evening when I bought a dress and spent way too much on the food they were serving. The bussers were incredibly friendly, so I chatted with them.

Before we were finished with our meals, he told us to give him 10-15 minutes to order our cab.  We definitely felt rushed and unwelcome.  When we left, I did not receive a rose, which I received the other two times upon leaving.   I know that Willie Brown's favorite dish is served at this restaurant, but I left wondering if the poor service and the rush job were because my dining companion was African-American. I honestly can't think of any other reason that my experience last night was so different from my previous experiences and from the experiences of the people seated at the two tables next to us.", "author": "Jan L."}

I love everything from the intimate and fun interior decor to the owner's crazy Roberto Cavalli pants. They play Andrea Boceli and the owner sings out loud every once in a while to the opera music playing in the background. In fact, one time during a birthday dinner, the owner and his wife started singing \"That's Amore.\" Very precious and totally not cheesy.  Both the food and the service are exceptional. On my last visit, I ordered the Fettuccine with wild boar ragu & porcini redaction which was delicious. I also recommend the Rigatoni pasta as well as the the lobster and crab stuffed ravioli in vodka pink sauce. I tried the tortellini with pesto and white truffle sauce but it was a little too heavy for me. During my last visit, we were also treated to complimentary bruschetta and tiramisu. I also recommend getting the family style option if you are dining with a group. You get to taste a variety of things thoughtfully selected from the menu. I can't get enough of this place. I am coming back again and again.", "author": "Annie Y."}

Although Allegro does not receive ratings as high as other pricier Italian restaurants (which will remain nameless, only to spare them my not-so-favorable comments) in the city, the combination of quality dishes and extraordinary service make this my favorite \"special occasion\" spot. Surrounded by families young and old, single men and women in their 20s and 30s, Allegro attracts people of all ages for its warm and dedicated staff, and its high-quality food. The bruschetta has a powerful flavor, served with wonderfully ripe tomatoes, although sometimes drenced in too much olive oil. I would recommend the Lobster Bisque or Mixed Greens to start, depending on your taste buds that night, the latter of course being much lighter. When I asked for a wine recommendation, one of the owners brought out a bottle of chardonnay that he always drinks, and we loved it! It also was NOT the most expensive one, which is often the case when owners want to \"recommend\" something. While I do not eat boar, a friend proclaimed twice, \"this is still the highest-quality, best-tasting boar I've ever had.\" Yes, he is a boar-aficianado. I have ordered the red snapper twice, and they prepare it two different ways, one with a red sauce drizzled with olives and garlic, one with a light wine sauce. In all honesty, while the food truly is some of the best Italian I've had in the city, I love Allegro more for its genuinely friendly and unpretentious staff. I feel like I'm in someone's living room when I'm there, and I chat with the staff. This place is hands-down, my favorite spot to be on a special night..", "author": "Spice O."}

Its a great place for a date or to bring your family when they are in from out of town. There's a really nice charm to it, especially from the host if catch him on one of the all plaid outfit nights. I brough a group of 5 friends here one night and as we left- the hostess gave all the ladies red roses. I highly recommend their lobster ravioli if it's still on the menu.", "author": "Anika F."}

This is my first review ever. I have eaten at this restaurant twice. It is 3 blocks from house and so it seemed like an ideal neighborhood restaurant to eat at on a regular basis. The first time I went there, my review would be similar to everyone else's. We had an amazing time, they gave us free port after our meal which they kept refilling, the food was amazing. But then we went back shortly after to celebrate some good news I had just received and they were very rude. The owner kept staring at us and rushed our meal. We felt very uncomfortable. They did not give us any port and and everyone else around us had some. We were there to celebrate and it was a really awkward meal. We had a full meal with wine, appetizers, salad, entrees and dessert and the owner seemed like he just wanted us out of there. It made for a very awkward experience. My boyfriend asked for some port (he was going to pay for it) and the owner stared at us liking we were being obtrusive in his restaurant. He brought us out some and there was barely a sip in each glass. We were going to pay for it, but he didn't end up charging us. I guess we thought it was expected since he had done it the first time and literally every table but ours had some. Maybe he shouldn't set the precedent. Anyways it was a totally strange experience where we almost felt like pariahs! Which is really a bummer b/c we would have loved it to be our new spot. We are definitely never going back.", "author": "E G."}

This was our first time dining here, but we have been wanting to go for months because we heard great things.  It did not disappoint!  We had a hard time finding a parking spot so when hubby dropped me off to continue searching, the owner Lorenzo personally loaned us one of his spots right in front!  We snuggled into our corner table and were instantly greeted with glasses of champagne and bruschetta on the house.  We tried two of the specials of the night - steamed mussels and homemade linguini with lobster tails.  The lobster was cooked perfectly.  We also had their caesar with fresh crab meat and lobster raviolis.  Absolutely decadent!  After dinner we were given numerous glasses of porto and two desserts (yes two!).  A plate with tiramisu, fresh berries and biscotti came first, followed by a rich chocolate gelato.  What a way to end the perfect meal!  Lorenzo was such a delight and we had a great time chatting with him about Italy.  Hubby is first generation Italian - he knows great pasta and great hospitality.  If that's what you're looking for, look no further.  We can't wait to go back to our little slice of Italy!", "author": "Kate G."}
