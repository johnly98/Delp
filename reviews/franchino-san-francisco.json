We got there a bit early as we had a large group and they don't take reservations.  I guess this is a family owned place which you could definitely tell.  The owner/host was so friendly, as well as the waitress.  We were treated very well.  Good service, great food, decent portions.  A nice little neighborhood place.\n\nWe shared a bunch of appetizers.  \nCarpaccio Di Salmone - smoked salmon with lemon & capers\nBruschetta - toasted bread with tomatoes, basil, olive oil and garlic\nCozze Marinara - mussels with a spicy red sauce\n\nI had the bruschetta.  It was very tasty.  Nice tomato flavor.  The others enjoyed the mussels and salmon.  \n\nFor my entree, I had the Prawns Picatta - prawns saut\u00e9ed with butter, lemon & garlic. The prawns were nicely cooked.  Good flavor.  Sauce was  light and tart from the capers.  Came with a nice side of grilled veggies.  The rest of the group had a variety of items - different pastas and meat dishes.\n\nWe had some nice wine.  I had the house pinot grigio which was very good.  Also bottles of merlot and chianti.  All good.\n\nDefinitely a great little neighborhood spot.  Good food.  Wonderful service.  They make you feel like family.", "author": "Karen C."}

The dining room feels like home (if home had ten dining tables) Every time we have been here it has been full with fun loving, local diners.\n\nBut how is the food? As good as anything we have eaten in Italy. On our last visit to Franchino's we had:\n\nThe gnocchi pesto was sublime. The dumplings pillow soft, the sauce smooth and perfectly balanced.\n\nThe arrebata was a wake-up call to my mouth. Zingy without being overpowering.\n\nThe Caesar was basic but what set it apart was the super high quality anchovy filets gracing the salad. We are convinced the reason people don't like anchovies is because they have never had quality fish. This will change you forever.\n\nFinally the chocolate cannoli, made fresh to order can easily be shared but you won't want to.\n\nUnlike the tourist places whose business model is \"one and done\", Franchino's depends on local repeat business and the experiences we have had here shows.\n\nObviously we like it. Our only misgiving ...how long it will take us to come back", "author": "Elwood P. D."}

I tried risotto and a pasta and both of them were unbelievably heavy and creamy. The food was completely swimming in a pool. \n\nAlso, I understand the bread and olive oil are complementary and may be seen snobby to ask that to be good. However, whenever I don't have fresh, somewhat warm and soft bread, meaning, whenever they serve a bread that's super dry, that leaves a bad impression on me. It's a small detail, but that's the first thing your customers are putting into their mouth. Why would you not let that experience be a good one?\n\nThis place could be local favorite if they were priced reasonably. However with those high prices ($20+ for pasta), they are playing the \"fancy\" restaurant game which, apparently, they are losing.\n\nFor me it's another, not so good Italian food in our Italian neighborhood.", "author": "Gokhan T."}

For entrees, I got one of the special pastas, rigatoni with Italian sausage, mushrooms, and a sauce with a touch of blue cheese.

My daughter found Franchino on Yelp and we called to make sure they were open on New Year night. Luckily for us they were open. \n\nWe walk in and it's a nice small restaurant decorated with wine bottles, Christmas lights and a bunch of family pictures. I love family own businesses. Nice fancy tables. Some of the tables are pretty close together but I just loved the Italian vibe. \n\nWe started off with the Bruschetta. They give you four pieces on a bed of lettuce and green olives. They stack up high with diced tomatoes and olive oil. I thought it was pretty good. Not great but good. \n\nI had the Veal Marsala with grilled vegetables. It came with three thinly sliced veal covered in Marsala sauce and mushrooms. I thought it was pretty good. Sauce was okay and the veal was cooked perfectly. I loved the grilled vegetables. Cooked just right. It had Brussel sprouts, carrots, green beans. Really good. \n\nMy wife and daughter shared the Spaghetti Al Ragu with a sausage sauce. They both really liked it. Wasn't a very big plate but enough for them. They were both satisfied. \n\nMy son got the Linguine Con Vongole which is basically with clams in the shell and he added chicken. He was raving about this. Really liked it. He wasn't happy about going out for Italian tonight cause he wanted sushi but after he had this dish he was really happy. \n\nTo end our meal, I got a cappuccino and we decided to share a Spinoni. It was dipped in chocolate, had a cherry on top with an Italian flag on top. We asked if they made this and the lady said that this was imported from Italy. I got to tell you this was so good. It had chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla. I know those are basic flavors but it was really good. Melt in your mouth goodness. So good. \n\nSo overall, the service was really good. Really liked the older lady serving us. Nice lady. The food was really good. Outstanding. Then the Italian family vibe. Really liked it.

We figured that had to be an indication of how good this place was so we decided to make this our choice for dinner. \n\nAmbiance:  A very small and dimly lit restaurant, Franchino definitely creates a friendly and comfortable atmosphere.  Although you are practically shoulder to shoulder to the tables next to you, Franchino's set up really makes you feel as though you are in a family members kitchen.  You are surrounded by an amazing smell of food, wine bottles all over the wall, zany paintings and other fun decoration which make you feel as though you really are in someone else's home.\n\nFood: They have a decent sized menu with a variety of simple classic Italian dishes.  My girlfriend ordered the vegetable lasagna while I ordered the veal marsala and some bruschetta as an appetizer.  The bruchetta was very tasty with the nicely toasted bread, bright tomatoes, basil. garlic and olive oil.  My girlfriends lasagna was layers of delicous cheese, sauce and veggies.  My veal was perfectly cooked and topped with mushrooms and a rich and flavorful marsala sauce.  Overall the food here was very good and my girlfriend and I will be adding Franchino towards the top of our lists for great Italian food in SF.\n\nService:  The restaurant is family run and you can very easily tell throughout your meal.  Everyone is so polite and helpful when it comes to your meal.  They all very genuinely care about making sure you are taken care of as if you are guest in their own homes.  \n\nOverall Experience:  Franchino is a great restaurant with amazing Italian food with a wonderful staff.

Felt cozy with the dated decor.  \n\nService was attentive with only one server running the floor.  Food came out faster than expected.  Capellini and lasagna were both amazing.

I expected more than that.  \n\nEntrees were awesome but only four stars because the restaurant smelled bad and bread wasn't good. It was like waking in a small apartment that had a big dog.

This is not one of those tourist-trap restaurants where they herd you in from the streets.  This is family owned and operated with a thoughtful and plentiful wine list and a menu chock-full of so many delicious dishes, that it was really hard to choose.  \nWe brought our own bottle of wine, their corkage fee is steep at $18, but it was worth it to share the special bottle that my boyfriend and I brought.  \n\nWe ordered the bruschetta, and although tomatoes are out of season, the grill flavor on the bread leant a savory and very interesting flavor to the dish.  Part of what I mean to say is that if I were vegetarian, I might not order this dish, the bread tasted like grilled meat residue - which I liked :)\n\nMy man ordered the bistec and it had an intense flavor of rosemary.   I imagine they must marinate it for quite some time to achieve that.  It came with a side of pasta in his choice of sauce (he asked for meat sauce) and he loved it.  \n\nI ordered the house gnocchi which you can choose the sauce.  I had a dish at a Sapore in Burlingame where they mixed their gorgonzola sauce with their meat sauce \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/sapore-burlingame?hrid=GsiYxQR5oFDMCuYm6bPcRw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)\n\nIt wasn't on the menu, but Yelpers gave me the insight.  It was incredible.  So I asked our server at Franchino if they would do that and she said no.  She said they wouldn't recommend doing that because the gorgonzola sauce was so intensely gorganolza-y that she didn't know what would happen (lol).  She offered, somewhat hesitantly, to split the plate with gorgonzola sauce on one half and meat sauce on the other.  I ordered that and mixed it all up and it was PHENOMENAL!!!!!  Do not miss this dish you guys!!! And Franchino, please consider adding it to your menu.  Just try a bite of it, I think you will agree!  But you'll need to name it after me.

Ain't nobody got time for that! Yelp guided us to better. So far my favorite Italian restaurant, it's too bad I live in LA. \n\nWe were seated right away. But do beware seats get filled up quickly as well. We got lucky with timing. The interiors super cute, classy but comfortable, with a welcoming feel. Good to come with family or date. They have a wide variety of wines to select from. \n\nI ordered the eggplant Parmesan with a side of veggies to go with something on the lighter side. First time I've ever ordered eggplant Parmesan anywhere but it was delicious. It's not like a thick slab of eggplant with cheese but it seemed more like very thin multiple layers condensed together. And the cheese was perfectly melted nicely balanced ratio. My actual favorite part were the grilled veggies. They were cooked and seasoned to perfection. Not burnt or soggy or dry or bland or salty. Just perfect. \n\nThe service was awesome. Servers came by to assist with recommendations and fill our water cups frequently. Making sure everything was good.

We were greeted by one of the owners, the mother, who is a really lovely lady. Then one of her daughters sat us at a nice table and welcomed us.  She was really friendly and jovial taking our orders efficiently.  We were given bread with olive oil (on the table already) and a bottle of balsamic vinegar.  Many reviewers have criticized the bread as tasting stale and being cold.  It didn't bother us that the bread was cold, and we did not find it to be stale.  It was fine and it was replenished without asking.\n\nThe clam appetizer was great:  Plump and juicy Manila clams saut\u00e9ed in a simple garlic, white wine sauce that went lovely with the bread. In fact, our son recalled that the clams reminded him of the ones he had when we were in Rome. One of us ordered the minestrone & one can tell that it is homemade.  So much different than at other restaurants where their minestrone tastes watery and lacks ingredients.\n\nOur pastas were fantastic.  The prawns and mussels were fresh and tasty as was the marinara sauce seasoned well and included fresh basil.  One can tell that the sauce was homemade.\n\nDesserts were also very nice although we preferred the tartuffo slightly more than the tiramisu.  However, the tiramisu contained a nice flavor of Amaretto liqueur as should be.  The desserts are a bit small to share though.\n\nWe had a simple pinot grigio & followed dinner with a port.  Both were fine accompaniments to our meals.\n\nThis is a simple, family owned/run restaurant with simple but authentic cooking.  So if you are looking for trendy and gourmet then look elsewhere.  For us simple & authentic are all we desire.  Thus, all in all we felt that we made a great choice & will return soon again.", "author": "Luisa T."}

Hard to screw this up, and they didn't here. Comes out super hot and it's really good. The meat sauce wasn't too salty, and very flavorful.

Chicken is super juicy and fresh unlike some of the wet meat I've tried at other places. \n\nMy friend got the seafood risotto. Very cheesy and delicious. Seafood was bouncy? Idk the texture was nice. \n\nPortion size is pretty large unlike some of the pictures I saw. We both couldn't finish. \n\nAlso, we had the bruschetta for the appetizer. The bread that comes with dinner is pretty dry and tasteless(although the olive oil and vinegar is bomb.com) so we thought the same of the bruschetta. To our surprise it was perfectly toasted and soft in the middle and seasoned superbly. A great way to start dinner! \n\nFor dessert we got the Tartufa and Tiramisu. \n\nThe Tartufa is a rich chocolate gelato with hazelnut/vanilla in the middle. Really creamy and full in flavor. Works perfectly with the heavy amount of cocoa powder. \n\nEveryone likes the Tiramisu so we tried it and it was alright. Creamy and soft.

We asked him to sing so he dimmed the lights and sang for all of us. Unfortunately, when we got the extremely high bill we felt as if we were paying more for the show than the food.\n\nSorry, but we won't be back.

The pasta was just a tad overcooked though. I certainly want to come back and try their risottos. \n\nThe place is small and family ran, and it shows.

And I also STRONGLY recommend that you try said gnocchi with the gorgonzola cream sauce paired with the house chianti. I didn't know what all the fuss was about wine and food pairings until suddenly I tried this dish combo and had the intense sensation of the wine breaking apart each flavor note of the gnocchi.  Similarly, the special of ricotta and spinach stuffed gnocchi pillows is another must try (with the pink sauce). \n\nFranchino's is an awesome family owned, somewhat clich\u00e9d, and quaint restaurant with an extremely nice husband/wife owning and running the place. They serve only classical Italian food but prepare it so well it's like straight out of a daydream. They use top quality ingredients and execute to a higher standard. The beef filling in the cannelloni and the cheese on top are all much better than in any other version that I've tried. At most other Italian restaurants, I either order something different (with a 'spin' on the classic) or leave thinking 'that was good, but I could have made it better'. Instead, Franchino's has set the bar for what it SHOULD taste like. \n\nPersonally, I liked it better when Franchino was more boisterous and talkative, but of late he seems to be 'behaving' himself.", "author": "Tiffany S."}

Years ago I had a pretty memorable experience at Mona Lisa, but I wasn't in the mood for that kind of Rococo-as-fuck atmosphere. I just wanted something simple and comfortable...oh and delicious. And perhaps decadent. I found that in Franchino.\n\nIt's a truly homey atmosphere with what appears to be the owners walking around and talking to people. I opened the menu and was immediately ecstatic to see that there was a vegetarian lasagna. Although I try to avoid dairy regularly, sometimes I'm just in the mood for comfort foods of my youth. Like...lasagna! Only, most authentic Italian joints seem to only offer the standard meat option. \n\nSo I ordered that, plus a glass of Chianti and sat back to enjoy the scene around me. It wasn't terribly crowded, nor was it empty. It was just right, entirely inviting, intimate (well, I was by myself) and I loved the warm, Italian trattoria atmosphere. I could have been in Florence. I could have been in Brooklyn. I could have been on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. \n\nThe food arrived and I took a moment to appreciate the very sight of it--the curled lasagna noodles, the orangey-red sauce, the slightly browned mozzarella, crispy on the edges (KEY!!!!) And then I dug in. Pure bliss. I don't remember the vegetables, but whatever was in there worked in perfect harmony to give me just the taste I was looking for. Yes, the noodles were the right level of al dente, the sauce tangy, and the cheese not overwhelming. MMMMMMMM I was as happy as Garfield when it was all over.\n\nI'll be back!", "author": "Joi B."}

I was excited because I don't get to North Beach as often as I'd like and was anxious for some real Italian food. I had a tough time parking and was a little late to our 6:30 p.m. reservation, but the other 5 girls were there. I called my friend to let her know I was walking and she said that they were already being pressured to hurry. I hastened my walk a bit and got there around 6:45 or so. \n\nWe ordered pretty quickly- I got the gnocci with gorgonzola which is a richer meal than I would usually order, but when in rome, eh? My companions ordered a variety of other items, each of which looked delicious. Our food arrived relatively quickly, which we appreciated. My gnocchi was good, but not the best I have ever had and I wish there had been a little more of it.\n\nI did not appreciate, however, feeling rushed eating my food. We were meeting while we ate, which of course slows the food consumption process, but we all felt really pressured to eat faster. We were offered dessert, which a few ordered, and AS SOON as we were finished we were asked to finish up. They told us they had a reservation for 7:30 (this was at 7:50, by the way) and we needed to vacate. I pointed out the time to the server and she said \"I know, that's why we need you to leave\". \n\nSAY WHAAAAAAT?!?\n\nI have never been asked to vacate a table for another party in my entire dining career. I was stunned. All of us were having a David After Dentist moment- \"is this real life?\".\n\nWe vacated after paying the $230 tab (yep, $230 for SIX PEOPLE) and moved our meeting outside. We had business to finish and so we stood out front for about 30 more minutes in order to do so. The overall opinion was that the food was good, but none of us would rush back because of the service.

I have to say this place has exceeded expectations twice now. A family run joint with a kitschy atmosphere, Franchino really does hit the mark.\n\nI've always had an aversion to ordering pasta out at restaurants, but each dish I've tried was just excellent. Simple flavors done well - exactly what I look for in a great Italian restaurant\n\nThe first time I went I had the gnocchi with gorgonzola - I was wary as two heavy flavors can sometimes be too rich, but somehow it was balanced, light and not overly filling. An absolutely excellent dish.\n\nTheir daily pasta specials have always been fresh, with a very simple but flavorful ragu sauce that complemented my chicken piccata (seriously, another homestyle classic done just right) incredibly well.\n\nThrow in a great dessert selection, a decent array of wines and an intimate, yet casual, atmosphere - I will keep coming back and recommending this to locals and tourists alike.\n\nOh, and the family the runs it couldn't be friendlier - the owner even offered to help call cabs for the large out of town group we were with. \n\nGreat little gem.  \n\nPS - Our large group was talked into an appetizer sampler this evening, and while everything was certainly tasty, the roasted eggplant rolls with gorgonzola were simply to die for. Our whole table could not stop talking about it.", "author": "Alexandra K."}

Great for business for this mom and pop place except the tourists are super rude and snotty. Tourists were telling people to go to the end of the line even though they had a reservation. I don't care which country you're from but I would've allowed people to check in with the waiter ESPECIALLY if they had a reservation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-14", "description": "At first glance, the restaurant is a small, family place. Do not let the size of the restaurant take up your concern, because what they lack in space, which really isn't a problem but some take issue with things like that, they make up entirely with their service, charm and offerings. I went on a Wednesday night with my friend before heading over to City Lights Bookstore. We were sat at a nicely set table, complete with a lit candle. The restaurant is decorated in a very classic Italian/Mediterranean style. In the background you can hear faint opera but the restaurant is quiet for its size. For our appetizer we had the bruschetta. It was AMAZING! I've had it at other restaurants and the bread has either been made soggy by the tomatoes and basil, or the bread was quite hard and topped with very little tomato and basil. Here, the bread was perfect, with a light crunch from toasting but still soft in the middle. The topping was not too juicy and it was well balanced and flavorful. I would definitely go back just for the bruschetta. For our entrees, my friend and I split the gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce, she had the Fettuccine Al Salmone with Aurora Sauce, and I had the Grilled Salmon with mixed vegetables. The gnocchi was light and pillowy. It was like heaven in a dish. The sauce was light and flavorful. You didn't get that overtly full feeling that most pasta gives you. It left you satisfied. My salmon was perfectly grilled, but not overcooked. It was seasoned with garlic, olive oil and rosemary. It was one of the best pieces of salmon I've had in a long time, and the best part was that it tasted fresh. The vegetables were grilled in what seemed like the same seasoning as the salmon and they were just as amazing. My friend's entree was actually very good, she enjoyed it and I know from the bite I had of it that I would have enjoyed it. For dessert, we split the tiramisu, which was topped with a candied maraschino cherry. The tiramisu was rich, as expected, but again, the food at this restaurant doesn't make you overtly full and feeling miserable. Everything leaves you satisfied. It was somewhat pricy, but I think it was worth it when you keep in mind the freshness of the food and the satisfaction after. The waitresses were very kind and made sure our dining experience was satisfactory. I will definitely return!", "author": "Zachary D."}

Simple, expertly prepared, casual fare dressed up enough to feel like Sunday Supper. \n\nFamily-owned for twenty-five years, Franchino is comprised of a husband and wife team featuring any one of their three daughters (\"The SHORT One, The TALL One, ...\" Etc.). The trio serves up just the right amount of Old World charm you want in a place like this - great service, pleasant and passionate about their food, and if you're lucky the Mister will favor the joint with a duet, usually alongside one of the more attractive female diners chosen at random. \n\nTiny and cozy, be prepared to wait if you haven't secured a table, and not surprisingly wine is the order of the day as this place does not have a full liquor license -- but you won't miss that unless you're somehow not a fan of wine.\n\nI enjoyed the Veal Saltimbocca - succulent and perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of mozzarella and prosciutto. Alongside it, I chose the pasta of the day which happened to be rigatoni -- my favorite!! - with meat sauce. The pasta was perfect al dente, and the entire meal was so good it almost made me cry. You can't pass up dessert in a place like this - I went for a cannoli which they make in-house, and oh my god - amazing!! So get in there already!!", "author": "Christian W."}

I'm at a loss for words, and almost lost my lunch after eating here, on my birthday, with my mother who was visiting from Brooklyn, NY. Talk about adding insult to injury! \n\nThe meal and overall experience was so bad it's actually funny. To start, when we first walked in my down to earth but food-loving mother said \"How come it doesn't smell like food in here...?\" It was like the food had been microwaved and left to sit. The eggplant parmesan had the texture of an old shoe, my husband's dish looked like something out of a slasher movie (he ate about 1 bite of the unidentifiable chicken with red stuff and cheese goo), the salad was dressed with something out of a bottle, and the bread just bad. Who f**ks up bread!?! I believe what they say about bread being a litmus test for food and boy do I wish we'd honored this notion. \n\nUpon both entering and exiting the restaurant, there was Franchino sitting outside drinking a beer (not even peroni) spouting out some things in Italian to patrons and passersby. What a gimmick! My mother gets 2 stars for giving an honest answer when he asked if we enjoyed dinner. \"Actually, it was pretty disappointing...\" I was not surprised by her candidness but it definitely knocked Franchino's socks off. \n\nHope you find this funny but heed my warning - 5 stars for gross!", "author": "Cara G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-12-24", "description": "Mr. Franchino, the owner of this restaurant, is a RUDE IDIOT. I was visiting San Francisco this past weekend with my daughters, our first time there together in many years, so I wanted to have a special dinner. I spotted the tiny Franchino and decided to give it a try. I gave my name to the hostess inside who was friendly & pleasant and said we'd have about a 20 minute wait. At this point I did not see the monster Franchino lurking anywhere nearby. \n\nAfter waiting outside about five minutes I stepped back in to ask the hostess if they might have a gluten free pasta. The hostess I had just spoken to was nowhere to be seen but another young woman was standing in her spot. As I leaned forward to ask her my question, the brute Franchino appeared from out of nowhere; he looked drunk and said 'Pleasah step outside' while making that obnoxious waving-shooing 'bye bye' motion with both his hands, adding \"Thissah lady does not work here.\" I was so caught off guard, embarrassed, and insulted by Mr Franchino's rude treatment of me that I didn't even attempt to explain myself to such an IDIOT. \n\nI did indeed step back outside, grabbed my two daughters, and went immediately next door to Mona Lisa, another Italian restaurant where the room was spacious and the decor beautiful, there was no wait, the service was very friendly and attentive, and, most importantly, the food was delicious. The only bad thing was the lingering sour taste left in my mouth by the rude treatment I had just received next door at Franchino, a restaurant that needs a new owner who has manners and does not insult his own customers. \n\nReading through the other reviews here, its clear that Mr Franchino is a Jekyll & Hyde character who does things HIS way without regard for social convention, and patrons who roll the dice by going there never know what their experience will be like. Mine? HORRIBLE!\n\nForget about stars Mr Franchino, this is a ONE FINGER review for you.... !!!", "author": "Yogurt M."}

It had nothing to do with the food or reviews, it had to do to its proximity to Bi-Rite (yes, I admit I have a problem). Despite missing out on a Bi-Rite trifecta, I'm glad we stumbled upon this place.\n\nThe restaurant is is small and narrow, but not to the point of feeling cramped. I was fortunate to avoid the wait many have described, but that's not to say the place was empty. On a Thursday evening, there was a steady stream of people dining - I recommend reservations.\n\nMy colleague had done a little homework on the place and knew she wanted to try their italian sausage. They were extremely accommodating when she tweaked her order slightly. I, on the other hand, hadn't any research aside from venue and was overwhelmed by the long list of pasta choices, eventually settling on the linguine con vongole with red sauce. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my meal and cleaned my plate. The sauce was extremely flavorful and the dish loaded with clams. Not being able to store leftovers and being notorious for overindulging on pasta, I was pleased that portions were generous without being gluttonous.\n\nService was friendly and efficient. Throughout our dinner one server and a woman (I suspect the owner's wife) attended to us. The owner's wife was friendly, funny and cute; she reminded me of a grandmother trying to stuff us silly. When my colleague ordered the tiramisu, she brought two spoons despite my protests. When she learned I hadn't tried it (tiramisu just isn't my bag), she playfully scolded me. For what it's worth, my colleague gushed about the tiramisu.\n\nFranchino was a nice little surprise; good food, good people, good prices. I would definitely return next time I'm in town.

The bread was toasted and warm and the tomatoes were seasoned so perfectly. It was so good! My friend ordered the soup and she said she loved it.\n\nFor the entree we shared the gnocchi with the gorgonzola (creamy cheese) sauce. Very good gnocchi. The sauce complimented the pasta well. The gnocchi was small and filled with potatoes - my favorite. The entree was a single serving but with the appetizers, it was enough to fill us both up.\n\nWe didn't get dessert, but the dessert menu seemed like it had a lot to offer.\n\nI would definitely come back. Prices were very reasonable for italian cuisine and the restaurant is so romantic and cute that it's a perfect place for an intimate dinner or date.", "author": "Junel S."}

Best part was that the dish tasted light and healthy...one of the better chicken marsalas I've had. \n-Homemade Gnocchi with Pesto Sauce\n          -I've had better gnocchi.  The pesto sauce was the best part of this dish.  The portions were generous.\n\nThe menu is extensive so I would come back to try some of the other items our server recommended (i.e. Lasagna, Chicken Amalfitano , etc.).", "author": "Angela F."}

My wife wanted Italian, so I pulled up Yelp and carefully weeded out the tourist traps, settling on this place.\n\nBoy, we wanted to like this place.  Older Italian gent near the door complete with hat, Italian \"nonna\"/matriarch, her daughter the waitress. Clearly these people know Italian food.  I was excited when I saw on the framed wall of photos a note scribbled on the back of a bill saying \"THIS IS NO TOURIST TRAP.  So and So (Italian name), somewhere in Florida\".  Olive oil and vinegar on the table with the bread, here we go.  Could it be, that at last, I found a place that makes good homestyle Italian food?  Sadly, no.\n\nThe highlights: the red sauce (I think she called it Ragu?) on the side of pasta was pretty good.  My daughter's fettucine alfredo was heavy as expected but good.   Manicotti, also pretty good (probably the best dish of the day and an off-menu special at that).\n\n\nThe lowlights:  chicken parmesan was an unbreaded cutlet or two, smothered in some orangey colored cheese.  I think it was a sauce, but the quality of the cheese was poor, so when it reached the table, it was just this orange glob.  Homemade ravioli, good, but way too much cream in the sauce. \n\nWe really, really wanted to like this place.  I grew up with a 1st generation Italian-American great-grandmother who made fresh pasta daily, so I know what I'm talking about.\n\nService was very good and the owner was super sweet, so I wish the food had been better.\n\nAs I exited, I noticed the owner trying to usher in customers off the street, as noted in other reviews.  Nothing wrong with that, but when your food is good, finding customers is rarely a problem.\n\nIn a pinch, it will do, but I hope there's better out in North Beach.", "author": "dan s."}

Given its high volume of reviews and generally high rating, I had high expectations.

We didn't feel particularly welcomed but it seems that the owner or dad wasn't around to greet us like the other yelpers so that could have been the reason.\n\nWhen we asked what the waitress would recommend, she directed our attention to the left side of the menu and didn't mention a single non-pasta item, which wasn't a great start for a group of hungry carnivores. We all ended up going with various pastas.\n\nThe pesto gnocchi came highly recommended but was probably the only disappointment. It felt a little one noted and plain. The dough itself was well cooked so I suppose the complaint is really directed at the overall dish.\n\nThe seafood pasta was probably the best dish we tried and I would consider getting it if I came back.\n\nAll in all, I thought it was an okay place but was a little disappointed given the other reviews.", "author": "Victor W."}

First time trying Italian food in San Fran. Basically what happened was that not only did they not pay attention that we waited 30 minutes for a seat but also let other people sit before us when we were there first and waited longer. I understand accidents happen but if it wasn't for the snarky or arrogant comment earlier + the mission to find parking on a Sat night in the area, it might've been ok. Food wasn't amazing either it was just not bad to good. \n\nHeres what happened. I show up with my lady friend to tell them we need seats for 2 people. And the lady who works said ok great it'll be about 20 to 30 minutes. She didn't ask for a name or write anything about us and there were people there waiting before us already. Wondering how they will accurately keep track of their queue, I asked her immediately after that if she needed to write my name down or how will she know who is next and what not. She replied by saying \"we've been in business here for over 25 years,  we know who's next.\" \n\n30 min later.. All the people who were there before us gets seated and now its about our turn... except that didn't happen... We were totally ignored and had another lady acknowledge that the other parties (came after us) will be seated shortly... at the same time she was seating another that came after us. At this point we already expected this. So we go to the entrance to ask her politely when are we going to be seated or what place in line are we? She said, \"you guys are last, we'll be ready in 20 to 30 min.\" At that point i said sorry, but we've been here for 30 min now and you just seated people that came after us, shouldn't we be next? She replied sorry about that but we let them seat already. She didn't even verify that we'll be next. I started muttering \"fuck i knew this shit would happen to my friend and saying we both knew\". She said sorry again. You can imagine how annoyed I was especially after trying to verify how will they keep track of the patrons order of wait-list. \n\nThe other party was kind enough to talk to her and let her know that we were indeed there first and waiting. So until then she came up to us and said \"you guys want to be seated?\" Rude.

The waiter kindly said, \"No, sorry.\" And the lady then responded with a \"Are you kidding me? This is a restaurant and you don't have a bathroom?\" I, as a customer was pretty annoyed of this woman's attitude- so I knew the waiter was probably even more annoyed. She kindly said \"It's for customer's only sorry\". They soon got i n this little quarrel about how the lady was going to eat here blahblahblah. So the party of 8 sat down and the waiter let her use the bathroom but too bad, it was taken.

He said to trust him. We couldn't deny him so agreed. He then told us that we were going to love the Antipasto appetizer and to trust him again. We weren't planning on getting wine or an appetizer, but realized that we had to go with his recommendations and make this an experience. We gave in and went with everything he recommended. We couldn't have been happier. The Wine was the BEST wine we have EVER tasted and we drank the entire bottle. The Antipasto sampler was better than anything we've ever had as well and my husband tasted and liked everything on the plate, including the vegetables, which he NEVER eats. I was so impressed.\n\nWe both really enjoyed our entrees, he had steak and I had something that wasn't on the menu, but was recommended by our waitress. It was phenomenal.  \n\nWe both decided to splurge and end with desert and Cappuccinos, but it was the end of a perfect and memorable night. Although in the end we ended up spending $150, to us it was the best thing that we did in San Fran. We could have easily spend less, but really splurged and went with everything they recommended. I couldn't be happier.\n\nWe ended the night with a picture with Francino to remember the night by. \n\nI highly recommend this just for the memories.

For one thing, don't believe that reservations mean anything here. We made a reservation for 7 and waited in line for 51 min. As a pregnant woman in my third trimester, I garnered a lot of sympathy from the other people in line, but we weren't even apologized to once by the staff here. I really didn't feel any 'family-owned' vibe. I just felt ignored and used for our money. The food was good, but the bar is so high for Italian food in North Beach that this place didn't stand out. Honestly, we picked this place because they supposedly took reservations and I didn't want to pass out while lined up on a smog-filled street, but since they don't honor reservations, we could have lined up and gone anywhere else. \nThe unexpectedly long wait also resulted in an extra hour of a parking charge and missing out on another place we planned to visit after dinner. That might not be as big a deal if you live within walking distance, but keep that in mind if you're not local.", "author": "Karen G."}

The video shares the history of the restaurant and neighborhood and introduces the Italian family that owns the place.  You get to see a younger version of Franchino and his wife. It's adorable and gives you a hint of the warmth and hospitality you'll encounter. \n\nThe place is tiny and tables are squeezed next to each other.  Not good for big groups though I guess if you are willing to wait they could probably fit a party of 8 along the window by pushing tables together. But seriously I think even a party of four was pushing it and twice that sounds insane.  Point being, keep it small?\n\nAmbiance: incredibly mom and pop. You hear the waiters and owners speaking Italian amongst themselves. I think the two female waiters are sisters or cousins - definitely related in some way.  And then there's Franchino and his wife.  Franchino contributes heavily to the ambiance that I loved so much.  When we arrived he was standing outside wearing a fedora and smoking a cigar. He greeted us warmly and beckoned us inside. Later in the evening I watched him walk over and make himself an espresso. What a good gig for him right? Drinking his espresso, smoking his cigar, and making friends with his guests.  As we got up to leave at the end of our meal, he shook each of our hands and wished us buona sera (good evening). So warm and attentive. \n\nIn terms of the food, I'd say it's average. The cioppino was good, the salmon was buttery, the canneloni was filling but the quality of the ground beef inside was eh? None of the dishes blew me away - and really, I think I could have made everything at home just as well.\n\nAll of this said, Franchino still gets four stars.  It's worth it if you come for the experience and less so for the food. It's perfect for a down to earth, homey night out with the family.

In NYC, this place would have closed within a month.  Word would have gotten around town that these real Italians (yes, Italians) are using HERSHEY'S SYRUP as the, uh, \"chocolate\" in their \"homemade tiramisu.\"  Oh yes.  They did.  I still can't get over this:  even a freezer-section tiramisu at Trader Joe's uses actual shaved chocolate.\n\nOur clam appetizer was good; the clams were sandy but tender and fresh, and taken off the fire at precisely the right moment.  The meat lasagna was the best thing Chef Boyardee ever made, I swear--with its cheesy, soupy tomato sauce, no ricotta, and no discernible flavors apart from meat, cheese, and noodles.  The Fettucini al Salmone appeared to use either farmed or canned salmon; much better flavor and quality would result from wild-caught smoked salmon.  Salmon's in season right now, so there's no excuse for using that nasty, farmed McFish.  The homemade chocolate-dredged cannoli has my approval, despite being plated with a flourish of that gadawful Hershey's syrup bottle.  But the tiramisu is a capital offense, with its quarter-inch-thick cake layer soaked in three drops of coffee, and the aforementioned Hershey's drizzled around the plate's edge.  It's like a piece of cheesecake you might get as part of an airline meal.  LOLWUT about sums up my reaction to it.\n\nI kept reading that this is the real deal, complete with on-site Italian grandmother.  Nope.

I've lived virtually my whole life in North Beach, and I only now found this gem of a restaurant?\n\nWhat a shame...cause the food was great!\n\nI can see some of the grouchiness with the other reviews...this place is small, family-run, and as a result can be less than efficient some times. But the matriarch of the family (I think her name was Josephine?) was your typical warm, caring Italian mom-like figure. \n\nWe split tomatoes and mozzarella (caprese style - which was light and filling), the fettucine franchino (a rich blend of cream sauce, proscuitto and mushrooms - it was rich and satisfying), and a linguine vongole (with white sauce). Overall a very good meal and the kid playing the accordion and our tiramisu only served to cap off a good night.", "author": "Aaron F."}

When I was growing up I lived on the same block as my grandmother, so I'm accustomed to great home-cooked Italian meals and gigantic extended family gatherings.  Walking into Franchino was like walking into one of those gatherings.  The delicious smell of fresh cooked Italian food and the smiling face of Franchino himself warmly greeting customers as if he were welcoming them into his own home.\n\nThe food was excellent - all very fresh and flavorful, reminiscent of the recipes I grew up with.  Reasonably priced. Friendly, prompt service - we must have been served by every member of the crew at some point! Great bread, great wine, great atmosphere.  A hole-in-the-wall gem in the crowded North Beach neighborhood.\n\nOne tip - it's a small place, so it might not be the best place for a LARGE group, depending on the night.  They don't really have a wait list, Franchino just kinda keeps the list in his head and seats you the moment he has space for you.  I'm not sure if they take reservations but it would be advisable to make one if they do.\n\nDining at Franchino is like being home.

The owners, first of all are the cutest thing on the planet. The father, mother, and daughters were all working when we went for dinner. Its always a good sign when the whole family takes pride in the family restaurant. \n\nI had the gnocci with gargonzola sauce and my friend had the salmon with some sort of amazing cheese sauce on top of it. We decided to go all out and forget out diets and it was soo worth it. DELICIOUS! The portions are huge and the food is rich, so our ambitions of finishing our own dishes were sqaushed, but the leftovers the next day were amazing too!\n\nThe restaurant was very clean. It was sort of small, but hey, its North Beach. We also got a bottle of Mark West Pinot Noir that was average price and delicious. \n\nThey don't take reservations the same day, so you sort of have to line up outside and wait for a table, which in our case wasn't a big deal because there was only one other couple in line when we got there. I can see this being a bit awkward if you take your date their with no reservation and have to stand outside in the cold for a bit.

We asked who was cooking and what is made on site, and we were happy to hear that ma and pop do most of the cooking and every item we asked about was made right there in the kitchen. I had the seafood linguine and there was at least as much seafood on my plate as pasta, if not more. Mom had the spinach gnocchi and it was cooked perfectly with a delicious Alfredo sauce. Sis had the meat sauce tortellini and all three of us agreed that the flavor was phenomenal. Before ordering dessert we made sure the tiramisu was traditional and made on site.

We had a late reservation so we were seated immediately. We were greated warmly by both owners. Loved the ma and pop Italian atmosphere.  \n\nWe ordered salads that were very fresh and the dressing was robust. I ordered  pasta with red/ cream sauce and the hubby ordered Carbonara. Both of our dishes were very fresh but lacked flavor that one would expect at an Italian eatery. Tasted absolutely no sign of salt, pepper, garlic or basil... Very, very bland.  The bread was cold and only offered up red wine vinegar and oil for it.  \n\nWe didn't order desert but it looked fab! \n\nMa and Pa bickered a bit in the back ground  during our dinner that made it really awkward... It was a late dinner so I understand they were tired and ready to start the closing process. But I would have rather they turned us away than take us on with the awkwardness.  Ma complained to us as well about late diners which was very awkward since we were late...but they took us on...\n\nI would rate the atmosphere (less the bickering) a 4.0 and the food just a 3. Total 3.5. With tip, dinner was $80 for 2 of us with one glass of wine each, salad, meal and no dessert. \n\nPs... Our waitress was their daughter and she was a sweetheart and very attentive..\n\nMy advice to the owners would be to allow their chefs to be creative and spice up the dishes with fresh garlic and basil...allow them to change up the menu with new dishes... What worked 20 years ago may not work today. Also to not complain to their customers about other customers,  restaurants...ect...\n\nHated being constructive...

Unfortunately, we are usually disappointed.  After trying 3 or 4 restaurants in this manner, we planned ahead this time, did some solid Yelp searching, and finally settled on Franchino because it had good reviews, great variety on the menu, and reasonably priced (for North Beach).\n\nAnd....yay!

We ordered a good assortment of pasta dishes and everyone was very pleased - good portion sizes, the right amount of sauce (not drowning the pasta into nothingness), wonderful flavors.  We also all finished off with dessert - canolis and tiramisu - and, again, very pleased by how delicate and tasty the desserts were.

After checking all the yelp reviews of Italian places in North Beach, I chose this one, great reviews family owned, something really different! I wish I could review the food of this place, but unfortunately Franchino and his wonderful family didn't give us that pleasure, instead they KICKED us out of their restaurant. \n\nUpon arrival to the restaurant, Franchino opened the door and walked us in immediately. The restaurant was packed but there was one table for two. This table isn't supposed to be there, as it was literally barely squeezed in between another table and the kitchen area. Right next to the kitchen is this area where they keep menus, dishes, the cash register, papers, glasses, etc..all on this rubbery mat area. In between this area and a table for four we were seated, Franchino joked as he sat us down \"best seats in the house\" My mom sat facing the restaurant, and although she was squished her view wasn't bad. I sat facing my mom and well, this lovely kitchen/staff area, actually I wasn't facing it, i was in it, one reach of the arm and i could be grabbing you menus, serving you water, grabbing your check, etc. \n\nAs soon as we sat down I felt really uncomfortable, my mom spotted a couple by the window getting up, and I called over a waitress. I VERY kindly asked her if we could be moved to the table that was leaving... she said, \"oh I don't know I have to ask HIM.\" Then she disappeared, no response. When we saw Franchino walking by my mom called over to him, and he kind of ignored us. A few minutes later a couple walked into the restaurant, which he immediately seating at the open table... A few minutes later a couple next to us was signing their bill. Then our waitress came up to ask asking what we wanted to drink... I believe this was his daughter, since no one responded to us we decided to ask again.\n\nMy mom asks her, do you think we can be moved to this table that's leaving, my daughter doesn't feel comfortable sitting here. Her response \"there are people who have been waiting for 20 minutes outside, we can't take away their seats\" - frankly, through the windows you can tell no one is waiting outside, and we only got here 10 minutes ago, so no one could have been waiting for more than 5. Then I said, oh \"do you think we can take that table, and they could take ours? or well wait for the next one?\" her response: \"we aren't going to make people get up from their dinner to re seat you\" my mom responds \"oh ahaha no that's not what we meant, we mean if something opens if its not a problem\"......at that moment she grabs our menus and goes, \" I think its best you leave, have a good night\" - my mom didn't understand her so she says. \"oh okay we can wait outside\" and the waitress repeats, \"no no you need to leave, have a good night\" and starts escorting us out of the restaurant. \n\nI was in such a shock, I was speechless. This place is tiny so surely everyone heard and understood and I was embarrassed. As we are walking out Franchino is sitting outside, and as my mom starts telling him how his waitress kicked us out, he told her if we weren't happy with sitting there we should have never sat down and left right away and he just said we are too busy for \"this\" and turned around and walked back into the restaurant... he was just as rude as his waitress. \n\nIn all my years, I have NEVER been kicked out of a restaurant. NEVER! My mom was so upset she started crying after we left!\n\nI would never recommend this place, this family is so rude and entitled, how dare you kick someone out of your restaurant for KINDLY asking to be re seated after you shove us into such a terrible seat.

Okay maybe being Itaian will allow you to have that kind of character,,, Maybe the food is good.\n\nWe had to wait for 30 minutes and the old man got crazier!!! The bread was hard and was sitting on the counter for hours.... we had the mussels for appetizers .  It was so small and overcooked that it was not worth the price. The chicken parmesan( not even breaded) was pounded up chicken to half an inch with melted cheese on it, the rotini pasta was dry, the sauce is horrendous . It tasted like canned dried up gravy. The gnocchi with pesto had no taste to it, the fettucine alfredo....ayayayay!!! nothing to write home about. .\nI had the pasta with calamari.  I had to doctor it up with parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper.  For dessert we had the chocolate cannoli, the cream was runny and the whole pistacchio nuts tasted old.  The tiramisu,  had thin ladyfingers, but if you like total sweetness , this dessert is for you. \nWe were so disappointed....   our bill came up to $123. Maybe this is how Northern Italian food is but taste is universal,  My husband is Sicilian, and has been in the restaurant business since he was wee small . Mr. Franchino was very abrupt to him.  Too bad Cesare's closed down. We could have just went to Bucca di peppo and got better food and service.", "author": "Cara L."}

She's a bit younger and not as familiar as I am, so when we arrived I was thinking, \"oh no, we're going to have to pay exorbitant prices for pasta that's just average\". We found ourselves in front of a restaurant she suggested that is clearly very popular with tourists. I pulled out my trusty Yelp app to save me from a potentially bad experience. Thankfully, Yelp saw my location and recommended I go next-door to Franchino! OK, so Yelp didn't really recommend it to me, but four out of five stars  for a whopping 810 reviews is pretty darn good. We had Maria as our server, one of the four sisters who works a few nights a week to help run their mother's restaurant. She made our evening so fun! The way she described the specials for the night meant that we didn't even have to look at the rest of the menu. We have the paparadelle pasta with sausage, mushrooms and tomato sauce, and the spinach gnocchi with a four cheese sauce. It's felt very special to know that it was Maria's mother who made the pasta. But mostly, it was very, very good. Thank you Franchino for wonderful evening.", "author": "Lisa H."}

Let me tell you that was the best decision I have made in a long time after finding Franchino!\n\nWe started with a sampler appetizer which was DELICIOUS.  It had a little bit of everything and each bite seemed better than the last.  My two favorites on the sampler were eggplant and I believe goat cheese as well as the prosciutto and melone.  Bruschetta was really good too.  It was all good - I may as well name everything on the sampler!\n\nFor dinner I had the homemade ravioli with ragu and my friend had the carbonara.  Each were fabulous.  The ravioli literally felt like silk and melted in my mouth.  I was so full that my friend finished my plate after clearing his own because mine was just that good.\n\nWe were too full for dessert.  In addition to the great food the servers were absolute dolls.  They were the daughters of the owners who were out of town for the first time celebrating their 35th anniversary.  Well the owner should trust their kids because it was incredible despite their absence!\n\nCheers to Franchino and I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Amy D."}

They have a large selection of pasta dishes and the few that my boyfriend and I have tried have all been delicious!\n\nOne thing that I was a little disappointed by was their tiramisu. I had high expectations given its suppose to be an authentic italian restaurant but their tiramisu was just average, and it wasn't made in the traditional way that tiramisu is made with the alternating layers of lady fingers/mascarpone-cream mix/ cocoa power.

I struggled a little bit with the menu choices as I am on a vegan diet for a month, but the risotto primavera was delicious and so was the garlicky spaghetti d'olivo (I'm not sure that's spelled right, but it'll still help you find it on the menu!).\n\nThe service was superb and friendly. The owners and their daughter were serving so it felt like we had joined their family for dinner in their home. I had an engaging conversation with each one of them at some point during our dinner.\n\nAs I said, the menu all looked delicious, but, since I am on my vegan diet, I was limited. However, my dinner partners were not and they raved about their dinners.\n\nThe only reason I could not give five stars here was because the by-the-glass wine selection was not very good wine (six choices, each $6.95 a glass) and the olive oil on the table was pretty low grade. If I wasn't so cheap, I would have sprung for one of the bottles of wine on their short but comprehensive-looking list.\n\nOkay, a short comment about olive oil. I'm really picky about my olive oil at home and expect it to be at least as good, if not better, when I eat out. Many restaruants serve cheap olive oil for dipping bread these days, and I think most serve Italian olive oil that comes in a bucket! The best olive oil is always fresh olive oil - and in California, that means local, Californian olive oil. The stuff imported from Italy can be 6 months or older and loses all of its peppery taste...but I'm ranting.\n\nIf you love enjoiying good Italian food in the company of a sweet, friendly Italian family, go say \"hi\" to Franchino for me.", "author": "Jaycen R."}

The place has great decorations everywhere and seriously is just so comfy. You just want to stay. I'm not the type to stay in a restaurant after I've finished eating but I could live here. \n\nThe food was amazing. I asked the waitress, one of the daughters of the owner what seafood pasta she recommended. Without pause she said \"the Pescatore.\" WOW was she right. One of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. Delicious homemade pasta. Amazing mix of seafood. All kinds: calamari, shellfish, actual fish. It was a medley of love dancing around my tongue. I could not have been happier.\nMy friend got another seafood pasta dish, which she said was amazing. I forget the name, but moral of the story is: Go with the seafood pasta.\nMy other two friends both got the mushroom risotto. At first they said it was kind of bland. Needed some salt and pepper, but they felt bad asking for salt. One friend tried to add pepper to her risotto, and the cap was loose and red pepper crashed down upon her plate like an angry lava flow. The waitress saw and took it back. They gave her a new plate which tasted better. it was cheesier. My other friend was jealous.  \n\nThe wine list was apparently great. I'm not much of a wine man, so I left it out. But my three friends raved about the two bottles they ordered. And wanted to order many more.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the panna cotta. Easily the best panna cotta I'd ever had. The sauce was delicious, and the creamy part itself was so rich and moist. I wish I had ordered my own instead of having to share with three others. \n\nThe atmosphere was what made this place above and beyond the ordinary. Mid meal, the owner, Franchino himself, sang a song in Italian for everyone. He has a great voice and sang a really heartfelt song. It was great. The whole place is family run. His two daughters are waitresses, and the wife I believe does the cooking. We talked to her for a while too and she was so nice. They all were amazing. \n\nThe food isn't too cheap, but its worth it.

It was a warm, friendly atmosphere and to top it off they served delicious food. \n\nI ordered one of the specials.  The fact that the waitress said, \"My mom made this great pasta...\" made me soon realize that this was food going to be made with love.  :)  The pasta was very tasty that even my friend dug into it himself.\n\nThe service was great and either the daughter or the mom checked in on us.  The bus boy continually made sure our waters were full and I was bummed that I didn't have enough room for dessert.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it four stars is simply because the space is pretty small.  Be sure to get there a little early though because it'll get crowded quick and they don't take reservations.\n\nAnother great thing about them was while I was waiting outside for my friend, the owner was outside opening the door for the guests and while doing that he and I would chat as if we were hanging out at his house.  Really great people and welcoming environment.\n\nGo eat at Franchino's!", "author": "Leilani R."}

I was searching for an Italian spot in North Beach when I had guests in town - I wanted a super yummy Italian restaurant (obvs) that wasn't too touristy (The Stinking Rose) but was still in the hustle and bustle of the fun part of North Beach. This place met all my needs! \nThe most charming thing about Franchino is that it's family owned, and the owner (a friendly older Italian man with a think accent and awesome felt hat with flowers) greets you at the door, seats you, and asks how your meal was. It had an old-world feel that I loved. \nAnd the food - oh the food! I ordered the tortillini (homemade) and swooned. As did my dining partners over their gnocchi (homemade) and their ravioli (homemade). \nOverall, the meal was awesome, the service superb, and the experience just top notch.", "author": "Jeanna B."}

We had a list of a couple of places, but for some reason Franchino caught our eye.  After a quick check on Yelp, we were sold. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small and packed.  The walls are decorated with family photos and poster of Italy.  Very charming.  The owner greeted us promptly and seated us at a cozy booth.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-13", "description": "I had read a positive review about Franchino's on sfgate.com and decided that on my next visit to the Bay area I wanted to try them out. We passed a lot of other restaurants on the walk to Franchino's, but I was determined to give them a shot. I'm glad we did. \n The restaurant was small and we arrived just a smidge before the dinner rush. Mr. Franchino was standing outside and hurriedly escorted us to a table. This is a family owned establishment so his daughters were waiting tables and his wife was chatting to customers and bringing out the dishes. I got mussels in red sauce and she cracked up because I was wearing white. She told me the people who order their linguini with mussels always wear white and always walk away wearing the sauce. I promised her I'd prove her wrong (I did!). She tossed in a free dessert to us when she found out it was our 9 year anniversary AND for not spilling the sauce on myself. \n As I said before, the place is very small. That is easy to see when one enters the establishment. In saying that I must note I was put off by a woman who entered (during dinner rush), with no reservation and demanding a table for 8, including two high-chair-aged children. Mr. Franchino looked around and told her if she came back in 30 minutes he would make sure she had a table ready. The woman was ghastly; becoming irate and sighing loudly and letting him know how he should \"appreciate\" her business and seat her right then. (Where?!) I was very impressed with how calm Mr. Franchino stayed and the way he explained that he could not simply remove other customers to seat her un-reserved party. She had left and I assumed for good, but upon our exit she returned (almost 30 minutes after) and as promised Mr. Franchino had a table waiting and had waters already poured for their group. I can only hope they tipped well that night.\n Anyhow, I would highly recommend Franchino's. The only mark I made was due to the extreme closeness of the tables and how this made it very hard to get up and move without bumping into other people's plates/drinks. I would have more appreciated the loss of one-two tables to spread out just that much more, but I understand the business is needed, so in the end it isn't too bad.", "author": "Melissa T."}

You can't help but think, this is a cover up for a mafia den and any minute the cops will bust right through the door. \n\nLet's talk about the food. It was good. not great. A little pricey for what it is but I enjoyed it. But it's all about worth. I felt like I would have a better experience and food quality for another Italian restaurant down the street. \n\nWhy were the tables so close together?

We were thisclose to going to Steps of Rome, but saw that it got 3 1/2 stars and decided we should try something new.  We pulled up Franchino's Yelp page on our iPhones and were deligted to see that, like in the photo, Mr. Franchino was standing in front of the restaurant with a welcoming smile and a 1950s hat.  Franchino was our clear choice.\n\nWe were seated by the window and Mr. Franchino's wife gave us our menus and told us about the specials.  On her recommendation, we got the manicotti with spinach and ricotta and the spaghetti with calamari.  We started with the house salad and got the complimentary bread basket.\n\nThe house salad was ok, as was the bread.  A bit disappointing because I love bread baskets.  The bread came out cold and was nothing special.  \n\nThen came out our entrees... one bite of the manicotti and we were speechless.  It was AMAZING!  The rich tomato-based marinara tasted fresh and was absolutely perfect with the bites of cheesy pasta.  This dish was some of the best pasta I've ever had.  It was so simple and delicious and I still think about it from time to time.  True story.\n\nThe spaghetti with calamari was also quite good (though the manicotti was the standout dish of the afternoon).  I've learned through many disappointing dining experiences that mixing seafood with a marinara-based pasta can be a recipe for disaster.  In many of my past experiences, it has been fishy and disturbing.  The spaghetti with calamari was my first pleasant experience with marinara-based seafood pasta!  The calamari was perfectly tender and the flavor perfectly complemented the spaghetti rather than overpowering it.\n\nThe owners of Franchino are a wonderful couple and we loved patronizing this delicious family-run restaurant.

As Maxwell Smart would say, \"Missed it by that much,\" since Dimaggio's, sadly, closed several months ago.\n\n\"Where to now?\" came the question, and with a little Yelp help, Franchino was the answer. Reservations at 6 on Sunday evening were made, parking was found in a nearby garage, and my wife and I walked in at 6:01. Our friends were already there and seated, with a very nice bottle of red that had been suggested by the owner, who greeted us when we walked in by saying, \"You're late!\" -- with a big smile and a gesture toward our friends. (He'd never met any of us before.)\n\nThis is a family business (23 years, we were told), and we were served by the father (a sweet man, and chief entertainer), the mother (a superb cook and charming lady), and two of the daughters (efficiency in human form, but still with time to make you feel at home). \n\nOur four dishes were all different, and all were excellent. From the Italian comfort food (Gnocchi, with a side of sausage) to the standard Fettuccine Alfredo on the other side of the table and from the Capellini Mare & Monti (prawns, chicken breast, mushrooms, garlic with \"aurora\" sauce -- a combination of tomato and cream, less cream) to the Pasta Pescatora (mixed seafood, tomato, garlic and basil) on our side of the table, everything came out hot, fresh, and perfectly cooked. The dishwasher had little work to do on any of our plates.\n\nThe place is small, but the atmosphere was so comfortable that it didn't feel cramped. Every seat was taken by 6:30, but we were able to visit with no problem, so the noise level was quite acceptable.\n\nAs someone else noted, the bread is OK and free but nothing special, but that was the only \"average\" thing about this dining experience. We had a great time with great food and great service. On the one hand I'm sorry that Dimaggio's in North Beach closed. On the other hand, I'd like to send them a \"thank you\" note for helping us find Franchino.", "author": "Lewis G."}

You wont be disappointed.\n\nAlright, I've pretty much lived in North Beach my whole life and rarely ventured out to Italian restaurants in this area. But I have to admit that this one stands out just a bit more than the others along Columbus. If you can mute the constant sounds of the most lovable yet voicetress host, then you could enjoy your meal in peace, but you can do that in any restaurant. So enjoy the ambiance. I pretty much asked the server to just feed me. She ended up serving me a Homemade Pasta with Italian Sausage. This is very good. I do recommend it. And I'm sure there are much more yummy dishes to try if you go again. My friend had the Fettuccine Franchino with prosciutto. This was also yummy. Creamy sauce and not too heavy like most Fettuccine Alfredos are. And then the saltiness of the prosciutto tops it off. All this was accompanied with the house wine. How can you have an Italian dinner without wine. Now the dessert. Chocolate covered Canolli and I forgot what I had but it looked like a custard cream sitting on a chocolate graham cracker.

Found the place solely based on yelp star-rating and number of $ (it has a pretty high yelp rating, so I was expecting some delish food). We walked from Bay street and Mason to avoid the parking disaster that is North Beach. Good call. \n\nWe walked past a lot of good looking Italian joints on the way, this literally was the last one. After passing a ton of fancy ones that were packed and smelled delicious, I joked to my friend that we probably chose the crappiest one that would be empty and cheaply decorated. I wasn't half-off... The decor wasn't amazing or as updated and new as others we'd passed, but it had a homey feel and the people were nice.\n\nAn older Italian man greeted us outside and ushered us in. He was cheerful and welcoming and lighthearted. He gave us a very small table in a tight corner. It was extremely hot inside. This is a family place and you can tell that everyone who works there is immediate family. I like that in a place. All of the servers were uber-friendly and our food came REALLY quick and piping hot. \n\nWe had 2 Peronis, the Chicken Parmagiana with a penne of sorts, and Risotto Primavera with the tomato sauce. Total bill after tip: ~$56. The food was good, but not amazing. Something about the vegetables in the primavera seemed frozen to me, but it might have just been the cut. They didn't taste frozen and I definitely cleaned my plate. I didn't taste the chicken parmagiana, but it was different looking than I am used to. It seemed really gooey on top and completely drenched in sauce. My friend had nothing bad to say though.\n\nI would have liked to try the meat raviolis in the mushroom sauce, or the risotto with mushrooms in a cream sauce (those two menu items are just off the top of my head, but I remember seeing things like that and being interested). \n\nOverall, very decent. Probably wouldn't return again for a while, just because of the sheer multitude of Italian restaurants in the area that I would want to try before going back there a second time.", "author": "Michelle L."}

Pasta was cooked like it should be. Sauces not overbearing.\n\nNow for the rest which I love but which may not concern others looking simply for good food:\nRun by a tight family working together.  Wife/Mother makes the desserts of which we tried the cheesecake.  Wasn't made from mascarpone cheese but it was good, not too sweet which I appreciate.  Food is served by the daughters.  Husband/Dad walks around making sure everyone is tended to properly. There are photos on the wall of the young Dad/Husband proudly in his restaurant from the 70's it looked like.  This all makes for a warm experience.  You feel like you're sharing a little time with this family.\n\nNote, this is a small restaurant, so there is not a lot of seating and you'll be able to hear your neighboring patrons' conversations a little too well.  It can get too noisy so it's not the best place for a nice intimate conversational dinner.\n\nWe walked in, didn't have any reservations so I can't comment as to the negative reviews regarding this.  We waited outside for a seat for no more than 10 minutes on a Thursday evening, around 7pm.  Owner Dad seated us and made sure we were happy.  Daughters tended to us attentively and we will return for another dinner experience with this family soon.", "author": "Liz K."}

The pastas were fresh, the wine selection was fantastic and their sauce was just right. Keep in mind that this place is small and does not take reservations, but the wait is worth it.

Boyfriend specially ordered Penne pasta with red-meat sauce. I got Gnocchi with pesto sauce. \n\nBoyfriend loves his and said it was the best he's ever had.The pesto sauce is like nothing i have ever had before. The daughter who mainly waited on us told us her mother makes it and it's really good. I love Gnocchi. I love pesto. The Gnocchi Pesto?? OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!\n\nThis is a family run restraunt and everything is homemade with the best ingrediants. Even the fricken balsamic vinegar was the best i have ever tasted! Two daughters, a mother, a grandmother, and a father run this place and all with smiles and the sweetest love. Our dinners tasted like pure orgasmic love- that is the best way i can describe it. I don't eat much, and my boyfriend has a small stomach; we couldn't rlly finish our dinners- but we still did. We had too lol. Even the sauces, everything was absolutly perfect. This was the sweetest most loving Italian family i have ever met. Menu is extensive for a traditional italian place. This is suppose to be one of the best Italian places in North Beach. I'm not entirely sure consideing this is the first italian place i have eaten at here, but it is INSANELY amazing nd there is nothing to beat, its unbeatable. The portions are not massive but the are large. Enough for you to finish if you have quite the appetite- thankgod my bf and i were starving after a major hike. Everyone around us was loving what they had. Each family member asked us how things were and the italian man even asked is what we ate and thought about it, he was so pleased and held our hands. He sang cheerfully italian music. This place is small but lovely. We want to take our families back here. \n\nMain dishes are about $15 a piece. Its expensive, but worth it for a special occasion. I don't see how any place could top this. If anyone wants to go out for italian in Frisco, this is where we will be found.", "author": "Brittainie B."}

Its always a great place to show off whenever I have visitors in town.  But I held off reviewing because I first wanted to compare it to actual Italian food from Italy.  Now having had that experience this week, I still think Franchino's restaurant might be the best Italian food ever.  Here's why:\n\n1.) Franchino greets you as if you were family every time you enter his restaurant.  He remembers me by name even though I've only been there three times!\n2.) All their food is fresh and homemade.  They go to the market every day to get fresh vegetables and spices.   The pasta is homemade as his family gets to the restaurant every morning at 7am to start prepping.\n3.) Franchino sings.  \n4.) Most importantly, the food is fantastic.  The food isn't heavy or greasy.  And the portion sizes are just right.\n\nAs great as Franchino's is, just realize that you'll probably spend at least $90 for a date (plus wine) if you get an appetizer and two meals.  But trust me its worth it.", "author": "Jeff G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-21", "description": "This review is long overdue. A few months back, the Then-Boyfriend-Now-Fiance and I were in North Beach when hunger struck. We happened to walk past Franchino's and were examining the menu when the owner himself came out and trapped us. I mean it. He shook our hands, introduced himself and basically kidnapped us and deposited us into seats. I'm glad he did.\n\nWe were introduced to Josephina, his wife, who runs the kitchen and is a pleasant, loquacious hostess. I ended up getting the Fettucine Franchino (with prosciutto, peas and mushrooms) and the Then-Boyfriend-Now-Fiance got one of the specials. I think it was papardelle with Italian sausage. The specials are great because all of the pasta is handmade. That means they don't dry the pasta out which results in a fuller, richer flavor. \n\nThe food is delicious. It tastes homemade, what I imagine my Italian grandmother would make me if I were Italian. The place is very small and only seats about 20 people at once. Franchino may ask you if you wouldn't mind sharing a table with someone else. Don't feel pressured into accepting. Turnover is pretty good, so you might wait around 15-20 minutes. \n\nPricewise, Franchino's is a little expensive - about 15-18 bucks for a pasta dish, a bit more for other dishes. Don't expect anything fancy though! The bread they serve is often cold and when it's really busy, you might not get your order taken as quickly as you'd like, but just enjoy Franchino's effusiveness and go with the flow.\n\nAs a little piece of trivia, the Then-Boyfriend-Now-Fiance and I asked Franchino on our first visit if the restaurant was named after him. It is but Franchino is his middle name. Francesco is his first name and after a little bit of thought, he said he preferred it, but he doesn't care either way.", "author": "Christine P."}

I have to at least mention that due to the size of this restaurant, they have a very strict reservation policy. They only have about 10 tables in the restaurant, so if you are lucky enough to get a reservation, make sure you show up on time. With or without a reservation, the hostess will do everything she can to seat you so reservations are not necessary. When you are fortunate enough to get a table, your taste buds will be delighted if you try the bruschetta.  The tomatoes are fresh and the garlic is perfectly portioned.  All of the pasta and sauces are homemade, and you will be able to tell in your first bite. My partner had the gnocchi with both the pesto and bolognese (they happily accommodated his special order), and both bites were equally delicious.

Great service from a family who genuinely loves what they do. The owner even shook my hand as we left, asking how the dinner was.

Not for the food, which we never had the opportunity to sample. But for the completely disrespectful way we were treated by the owner/maitre'd. We had long-planned a family dinner at Franchino, my sister-in-law had talked to the owner twice regarding our reservation (once to make it and once to confirm it). But when we arrived (on time) for our reservation they made no effort to honor it. Instead we waited for an hour, with the little man coming to the door periodically to seat other, smaller parties, ahead of us, and to attempt some over-the-top, smarmy casanova \"charm\"  to placate us. In short, pathetic. He never apologized for the delay or expressed any meaningful effort to seat us, even though we inquired repeatedly. After an hour (I know, no idea why we waited as long as we did), he came out to tell us that he was \"squeezing\" us in a corner of the restaurant. That did it, we went next door to Mona Lisa. There we waited 20 additional minutes for a table, but were well cared for by the owner and hostess (including the lovely bottle of their house Chianti that they brought us while we waited street side). So not only did we end up having a lovely dinner NEXT DOOR, we were able to avoid giving our money to the awful little man at Franchinos...we win.", "author": "Linda L."}

None of this sweet Ragu crap, I want my sauce to be chunky and tangy. I also want my dessert to be as boozy as possible. This place was a win on both counts.\n\nI have been showing my mom around SF for the past few days. She is 1/2 Italian and clearly remembers what it is like to live in an Italian household and including the food and personalities that come with it. She immediately told me that this place reminded her of being at her grandparents home for the holidays complete with a boisterous guy walking running the show and wearing a fedora. \n\nI had the gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce. This is a fair amount of food but I recommend balancing this out with a salad. All of that starch and oil needs a counter weight. My mom had the cioppino which was filled with some of the freshest seafood possible. This is her favorite dish and she was not disappointed. My step-dad ordered the chicken marsala and he said that he has never had better. All shining reviews. \n\nLike I said, Italian desserts will give you a buzz. I have had so many Tiramisu attempts which failed because they thought they could leave out the alcohol. Sorry, just can't work. I had the Zabayonehot, which is a custard made with white wine. I enjoyed every bite and lets just say that after my Peroni and this dessert, I am glad I was not driving home.\n\nThe staff is so welcoming and they obviously put on a bit of a show for the north beach effect.

Big disappointment!! \n\nMy girl friend and I arrived around 6pm last evening on a warm beautiful Thursday night. There were only 2 other parties in the whole restaurant. We went early expecting the crowds mentioned here. \n(the restaurant did start filling out around 7pm). Anyway, the owner dad, mom daughter all nice. So service great (for now) \n\nWe looked at the menu and the only wines by the glass had no label. Basically house wine, I guess. For a Cabernet, it only says \"Cabernet\" and so on. I ordered the mystery cab. Wine by the glass? Not so great. \n\nAs we are trying to relax, we start smelling cigarette smoke. We thought it was one of the other patrons...turns out it was the owner smoking right at the open door. The wife came by our table to bring water right as my friend and I were talking about how clueless this guy was. Good for mom owner, she went out said something in Italian to dad owner..... we assumed she told him what we said as he moved away from the door and farther to side of the restaurant to finish smoking. 1/2 hr later dad owner is smoking a second cigarette right at the open front door again! \n\nOn to the food: \nMy friend ordered the gnocchi with pesto which was a on the firm side and with not much taste to it. I think gnocchi should be soft outside and slightly chewy in the middle with a yummy taste of potatoes. These were no where near like we expected. The pesto sauce was also bland. \n\nI ordered the special home made pappardelle with a sausage creamy red sauce. Yelp reviewers are 100% accurate on the home made pasta because the pasta was DELIZIOSO. Best texture, taste, everything ever!! The sausage red sauce however could have used a bit more kick. It was fine but nothing fantastic about it. Still I ate the whole thing because of the pappardelle. \n\nDessert menu - nothing exciting so we decided to head to Cafe Greco for it. \n\nService 1 star - half star taken away because of the clueless dad smoker \nfood - 1 star which goes completely to the pappardelle only. \n\nStill I may give this place another try some day.", "author": "Mags P."}

As others have said, the place is tiny and it definitely feels like a Mom and Pop.  He had the manicotti special, and I had the ravioli porcini. . Our dinners came out very quickly.  The ravioli was very undercooked (bordering crunchy)  as were the mushrooms.  We debated if they were previously frozen or if they had been left in a colander for a couple of hours. The sauce was just heavy cream. The manicotti were simply tubes stuffed with cheese (basically no spinach) topped with more cheese to which the waitress asked if I'd like more cheese.\n\n I understand that manicotit has to be cooked ahead of time, but it too needed more time in the oven (under the broiler).  All together, this place was a disappointment given the reviews here, the price, and the food itself.  Perhaps the problem was that both owners? were out front instead of in the kitchen.

The chicken was decently cooked, but the flavor was simply lacking. There was an abundance of salt and no real kick.\n\nTo the side (you have a choice of pasta or vegetables) was a mix of pasta covered by a standard red meat sauce. This had no flavor whatsoever. I hesitate to say it, but I could have opened a can of Chef Boyardee that had more flavor than what was presented to me on that dish.\n\nFor a dish that was $17, I was expecting so much more. In order to get a better review, this dish should have been $6.95.\n\n- Salmon carpaccio: Overall impression is that the salmon was prepared okay but the entire dish came across as very one-sided and salty.\n- Meat Lasagna: The best of the three dishes. This had a decent amount of flavor and wasn't too bad.\n\nOVERALL\nI'm surprised so many people are giving such generous and raving reviews.

Then I piped up about how Italians don't combine cheese with seafood either, and that conversation went on way too long, but was entirely my fault. Full responsibility taken for that one. \n\nOkay, so as we're waiting for our food to arrive (I ordered the carbonara), the owner started bellowing really random things, and it was very uncomfortable.

My friend asked me what it means when mussels taste \"fishy\", and I told her it's not such a good thing. My carbonara was just awful.

I spent over an hour reading tons of mixed reviews on places here on Yelp and really could not make up my mind. Finally I decided on this one and so glad I did. \n\nFirst off I am a white boy of strong German background from the east coast and I can tell you that I find it hard to spend money on Italian food. Most of it all tastes the same to me and usually I feel like I can cook it better at home. When my gf and I were in SF for a getaway I really wanted to try to find a good Italian place.\n\nHere are the key points to take away from this place:\n-Family owned that actually is there and takes notice of everything going on. They are very nice, not pushy and also very helpful.\n\n-I had the Seafood Risotto and it was very good!! Clams and Mussels cooked perfectly. My gf had the Fettuccine Franchino ...it was unreal. The pasta is very fresh and you can tell it is homemade. All the sauces are fresh and not canned stuff that is tossed together like most places.\n\n-Inexpensive. I though it was very fair priced and the portions were very decent\n\n-They do not rush you out of the place. Actually took awhile to get the check\n\n-Finally,  the Tiramisu was excellent... I always have it wherever I go and this one was on my top 3.", "author": "Carl S."}

We arrived around 7pm and the place was packed! I walked in and gave my name to Franco, the very friendly owner, and he just said... okay! When I realized there was no sense of organization to his accommodations I just kinda laughed. I asked him how long the wait was and he just shrugged his shoulders and said my name, so at least he remembered! \n\nMy party of 4 came back about 45 minutes later and stood in line behind people that had \"reservations.\" PEOPLE they DO NOT take reservations. He may tell you that but seriously, this is the kinda place you just have to show your face and stick around until he has a table for you... kinda sucky I know, but totally worth the wait.\n\nLuckily, my mom likes to talk to strangers and struck up a great conversation with Franco about my Italian grandma and instantly we were family. He yelled my name and we were in. \n\nThe food was AMAZING. I ordered vegetable lasagna (which was home made) and it was to die for. I am a big pasta fan, and this place may easily be the best Italian restaurant I've ever been to.\n\nI definitely plan on going back on a less crowded night.

The host is an avuncular Italian man who tries to get everyone seated as quickly as he can given that the place is crowded and people take their time.\n\nIt's also incredible to find an Italian restaurant on Columbus that isn't the embodiment of kitsch.  One of my favorite moments is when that avuncular host dragged an 8-year Italian boy away from his seat and introduced him to the restaurant and tried to get him to sing.  He didn't want to sing, but the host delivered rousing renditions of Italian folk-songs despite a sore throat.  Really cool to get free entertainment with dinner!\n\nFood was amazing: house salad was surprisingly good (or we were just hungry), while the house-made gnocchi in gorgonzola cream sauce hit the spot.  I'm sometimes worried that gnocchi will be too filling or too potato-ey, but this was one actually tasted home-made as in each piece there was a little bit of a textural difference between the wrapping and the filling.  The cream sauce had a nice tang, but not too sharp.  Portions were actually the right size too!\n\nGot a nice bottle of lambrusco (red sparkling wine) that was reasonably priced too.\n\nAlso, my bf and I were definitely talking for a while at the end of our meal, and they were very cool letting us sit there even though we were the only ones\n\nThe only drawback in my mind was the bread which was both very ho-hum and stale.  I don't think I can complain too much, given how much of it I was eating.  It just kind of took away from the experience slightly.", "author": "Jeff A."}

No problem getting the reservation. Experience was uphill from there. Greeted w/a smile and open door. Gentleman seemed to be part of the family who ran the shop w/pride. 'Mother' dropped by the table within moments to say hello & describe the special. 'Daughter' took care of us the rest of the way, and care for us she did. I was a typical pain in rear who wanted something not on the menu. No worries, she listed the veggies they had in the kitchen to help me create exactly what I wanted. Timing of food & beverage was great. Flavor wonderful, and portions perfect to keep me from being uncomfortable & make the decision about whether to have dessert pretty darn hard.

DF ordered a simple spaghetti dish for his main entree and JM ordered the gnocchi as his main entree.  \n\nMy dish wasn't as good as it was the first time.  There wasn't as much salmon in it and the portion was a hair smaller.  Was it enough to feel disappointed?  Heavens no, but it was an observation.  The food was still tasty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-05", "description": "Once you've had Italian food in Florence, all other Italian food outside of Italy seems to disappoint. I've tried several other Italian restaurants in the city, and the one that comes closest to tasting like the dishes you'll find in Italy is Franchino.\n\nStarting with the atmosphere, there is something about this restaurant that feels authentically Italian. Compared to its larger, flashier, more imitative tourist trap counterparts that surround it, Franchino is tucked away a bit more discretely on Columbus Ave. It's quaint, but very cozy and jovial. And once you step inside, you are immediately greeted by hosts and servers (most of whom appear to be related) that seem genuinely happy to have you as a guest. \n\nHowever, the top-notch service is just the beginning. The dishes at Franchino are excellent. The sauces are tasty and full of bold, exciting flavors. My first trip to Franchino, I ordered the Veal Pargiana which was juicy, tender, and cooked to perfection. On my second outing, I ordered the Mussel and Clam Risotto which was very creamy and very tasty. I even snuck a bite of my friend's Gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce which was to-die-for...it was even reminiscent of the Gnocchi I had in Florence (which, to this day, remains the best Gnocchi I've ever had in my life. This gnocchi does, however, come in a close second). All of these dishes were well-portioned and perfectly cooked. \n\nAlthough I have yet to be truly inspired enough by any Italian restaurant in SF to hand out a 5-star rating, Franchino definitely comes close. With winning service, solid Italian cuisine, and the 2nd best gnocchi I've ever tasted, I would say the rating is a bit closer to 4.5 stars. Definitely check this place out the next time you decide to grab dinner in North Beach.\n\nP.S. After Franchino, head to Stella's Pastry Cafe down the block. Their chocolate hazelnut truffle cake is heavenly!", "author": "Joseph F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-05-04", "description": "I am completely disappointed. I really hate writing bad reviews and try to always find a silver lining.. but when a restaurant with 4 stars disappoints you to this caliber, it's kind of hard to keep your mouth shut. \n\nI made reservations here after reading all the rave reviews on Yelp (I was really sold when it turned out that one of my friends had even given a 4 star review). I had originally made my Saturday night reservations for 6:30 a week in advance, but ended up having to change them to 7:30 reservations two days later. When I had called to change the reservations, I was told that it would be difficult for them to fit my large party of 7 in at that time, but they would try their best and that we may have to wait for a little bit.  I explained to the woman on the phone that waiting for a little while was not a problem and that I appreciated her understanding in the time change. \n\nFlash forward to Saturday night and we arrived exactly at 7:30 on the dot. Everyone in my party of 7 was present with the exception of one person who was looking for parking.  I notified the staff that we were all present with the exception of one person who would arrive shortly.  Now, I was already informed on the phone that tables are not seated until everyone is present.  I get it.  I didn't just start eating out yesterday and I've worked at my fair share of restaurants.  It's a fair request and one which I am very understanding of.  So when one of ladies asked me to notify her when my party was complete, I pretty much figured that we may have to wait for a bit.  What really took me by surprise though, was when I had first walked in, there were about 3-4 tables that were still open.  And when I had walked in the second time to notify them that my last person had arrived (about 5-10 minutes. later), ALL of the tables had been given away. \n\nThis took me by surprise since I had made reservations and had made it clear to the lady that I had spoken to that I had made reservations. Don't get me wrong, I understood that i couldn't be seated until my whole party was there, but I would have expected at least a 10 minute grace period since I had made reservations and I had such a large party. Since it was obvious that we weren't getting a table right away, we asked the ladies that worked there (and even Franchino himself!) how long the wait would be. And all we got was a, \"please be patient, it'll be just a few more minutes\".  Alas, after AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER, we were tired, cold, and hungry. At that point, we finally saw a table leave and were sure that they would offer it up to us since we had been waiting the longest. But NO, they gave the table away to a table of 4 that had arrived after us even though they probably could have squeezed us in. \n\nThat broke the camel's back. My bf, who at this point was furious, ended up going back and giving them a piece of his mind. As much as I was against him doing it, I can't really say that I felt like they didn't deserve it. Not only had I made reservations, but we did technically arrive on time. And if only they had been honest about it, and had told us that the wait would be more than an hour, we wouldn't have been upset. We would have just simply moved on to somewhere else but we would have came back at another time to try it. But they weren't honest about it. They kept stringing us along with their, \"please be patient, it'll be just a few more minutes\".  \n\nAgain, I'm really disappointed that I have to give out a 1 star review. It's my first, and what I hope to be my last.  I'd like to say that I would give them another shot so that they could redeem themselves, but when you can't even get seated, you just don't want to take the chance of not getting seated again.", "author": "Joanne K."}

Anyway, the food and overall experience was so above-and-beyond disappointing.  The food was so blah- mediocre would be a compliment. It tasted like cafeteria food, except that I got about twice as much when I was 10 years old.  Which brings me to thumbs down #2:  the portions were a joke, how little we got.   Three tiny, thin slices of chicken on a plate each.  Entree served. The waitress was rude.   I can say the owner was very friendly.  There were plenty of open tables so we got seated immediately.  The food came very quickly (but then again, it tasted like it was put together in a minute).  My husband and I felt violated for how much we paid for such a lousy and tiny meal.  JUST.SO.BAD.\n\nOn a positive ntoe, this has been one of those one-day-you'll-laugh-about-it experiences that we will always remember about our time living in San Francisco.", "author": "Nadia P."}

Franchinos made our trip to SF for our sons 16 th birthday nothing but remarkable, special and so much fun.  Although there was a wait for our party of 9, the experience that we had was nothing short of wonderful. Mr. Franchino was very interactive with the standing room only line waiting out front to get a table.  Once inside the family atmosphere was felt throughout out, with Mr. Franchino serenade the packed dinner crowd.   The food was the best I had every tasted.  A must is the bruschetta and gnocchi with pesto sauce. Best homemade pesto sauce ever.  The desert, cheesecake and tiramisu topped the night off. Would defiantly return anytime, hopefully sooner then later", "author": "Shelly B."}

The area, easily summed up as the center of all things cheesy about \"Little Italy\", offer swarms of tourists chowing down with \"Nel blu dipinto di blu (Volare)\" blasting in the background. But on this given night, with a craving for Italian and a lack of motivation to leave the 'hood, I opted to stroll down the hill and take my chances.\n\nIn all honesty, this has been my second time to Franchino and I wanted to stop by again to verify my first-time impression of the place. In the end, I really enjoyed the place and the food is simply very good. Locally owned, locally served, simple and not excessively pricey. Although the decor is... well, what decor?... I thought the place was \"charming\". The prosciutto and melon is a great start to the meal. Their pastas are great and flavorful. The capellini with the prawns/chicken in the aurora sauce was money. The lasagna was hearty and very good.

The linguine with clams was supposed to come with a white wine sauce, but I felt like my noodles were served with no sauce whatsoever, with only the feta cheese for taste.  Not sure if they forgot to add the sauce, or if the white wine sauce is actually supposed to taste like nothing. The capellino (spell check) with aurora sauce was much more  flavorful, so if you would like to come here, the aurora sauce (basically tomato and cream sauce), or red sauce would probably be a better bet than the white wine sauce.   Each meal also came with bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegrette, though there was nothing special about the bread.  It was served at room temperature  and was a little on the hard side.

A cozy unpretentious space with baby blue walls adorned with scenic paintings, it felt like we were guests visiting an elderly Italian aunt's house.  If I had one.\n\nThe food was fabulous - as close to what I'd imagine to be authentic Italian home-cooking.  We ordered the special of the day - Italian sausage, tomato sauce, with parpadella pasta.  Incredible fresh al dente pasta with a meaty and flavorful sauce.  So delicious that I found myself cleaning every inch of the plate with the bread long after we finished the meal.  Bruschetta - zesty fresh tomato and basil.  So simple and yet so good.  My glass of Chianti was a perfect complement to the meal.  \n\nAnd of course, what Italian meal would be complete without homemade tiramisu?

I had the very tasty Pollo Amalfitano (chicken sauteed with garlic, mushrooms, prosciutto, and leaks in a tomato sauce) which was served with al dente rotini pasta. My friend had the Pollo Saltinbocca (sauteed chicken covered with ham and smothered in cheese) and loved it, although it could have been a little warmer temperature-wise when served (having worked with chefs in the past I'm never shy about sending a dish back that's not hot enough). My brothers had the Pollo Masala (chicken sauteed in Marsala wine and mushrooms) and the Risotto Primavera (Arborio rice with fresh vegetables, garlic and tomato). Cioppino and the Pasta del Giorno (changes daily as the name implies) rounded out our party and everyone was very happy with their selections.\n\nOnly a few of us were interested in desert so we spit a Tiramisu and a Chocolate Cannoli, both homemade and both excellent even though the Tiramisu was a variation on the theme (sweet creamy mascarpone atop a delicious crust).\n\nThe atmosphere was great and as many other reviewers have said it was like being inside a family kitchen as patron after patron came in to eat who knew the entire family or people just dropped in to hug the owner or his wife. The music, although occasionally on the loud side, was all Italian and the feel of the place was warm, casual, and inviting.\n\nThe best part for me, besides the food, was that quality I so much enjoyed when living in Europe and one rarely seen in this country: no one tried to rush us out of there even after we had finished eating.

We both grew up in households where our parents and grandparents made their own meatballs and gravy (yes true Italians really call it gravy and not sauce or meat sauce).  If you want neuvo cuisine type food maybe Franchino isn't your cup of tea. But if you want great pasta with meatballs, and great gravy that is all homemade by Mama who is originally from the Amalifi Coast of Italy, this is your place. The restaurant is small and fills up quickly so get there early. We arrived by 6pm and had no problem getting a table. Arrive at 7pm and the place is packed.  The owner makes all of her own pasta and gravy and you can tell. Her daughters work as waitresses and they are all a delight.  We're from the Phila area originally and these folks made us feel right at home.  The chianti is great accompaniment and if you save room for dessert, the homemade tiramisu is to die for. To be frank, I can't figure out how anyone could give this restaurant a 1 rating.  The food is just too good. Maybe if you want quiet romantic, you could deduct points for the ambiance but still, the food more than compensates. I cannot say enough good things about Franchino.

Suppose his girlfriend is Italian.  Then suppose that since she isn't in this area much she invites her cousin and his family to meet all of you in the city for dinner.  This cousin is a chef.  \n\nOne might think that dragging this bunch to an Italian restaurant in North Beach would be the last thing in the world one would want to do.  One would be WRONG!\n\nFranchino not only impresses your guests with true Italian family atmosphere, but the food is fantastic enough to impress someone who used to manning his own kitchen.\n\nI love this place so much it's hard to know where to start.  \n\nThe service:  It's awesome.  But when you've got a husband/wife/daughter team running the place what do you expect?  There's always someone there to answer a question, fill a glass or sprinkle a little extra cheese on your plate.  And they take their jobs seriously because --- well, they own the joint.  It's in their best interest to make sure you want to come back again, and it shows.\n\nThe atmosphere:  Great.  The dining area looks like a giant version of someone's grandma's kitchen.  There's the obligatory assortment of family photos on the walls and other various other knick-knacks that make it feel like home.  There's usually music and it your lucky, it'll be an Italian Opera because that's when you'll get a REAL treat, Franchino will sing!  \n\nThe Food (etc):  While the other stuff make a restaurant good --- this is what makes it GREAT.  If you're feeling brave give the menu back to Franchino and ask him for a recommendation.  You may find he's been working on something new for the menu and would love for you to give it a try.  We've eaten there many times and have never left disappointed.  And as I said from the beginning --- I've brought in Italian connoisseurs and they left with a smile on their face and full belly.  Ask 'mama' about desert and you'll find a woman who's tremendously proud of her cannoli and for a good reason!  And as someone else said --- the tiramisu --- Yummy!    My personal favorite entre --- The Gnocchi with Gorgonzola.  \n\nOverall --- yes the place is pricey but come in hungry because you'll certainly come away full.\n\n\nOne last thing --- Franchino and his family are from Naples and their food reflects the region.", "author": "Shawn M."}

Ignore all the others waving you to go in - go straight to franchino for a delicious night out.\n\nthe bruschetta was phenomenal! a must try.

It's got just the right chewy/springy texture and a well balanced sauce. I don't even need the salmon that comes with it - the pasta alone is fantastic....No matter how full I am, I eat this up! The tiramisu and panna cotta are both very good and great to top off the meal.\n\nIf you've never been to Italy, Franco can be a bit overwhelming.

Fried crisp and calamari wasn't chewy. Yay! I got the Capellini with Prawns and it was just to die for.  I am picky when it comes to seafood but they were cooked to perfection.  Crisp around the edges and moist (but not overdone) on the inside.   My prawns were YUMMAY!!!\n\nI had a bite of my friend's Chicken Parmigiana and it was just so freakin' good.  The cut of the chicken breast was not tough but actually juicy which sometimes is a rare find when ti comes to Parmigiana. The cheese on top tasted fresh. Herbs and spices were perfect and didn't over power my palette.   I really couldn't complain.  Even down to the vegetable sides dishes, they were cooked perfectly and not overdone.  Gotta love that too. \n\nThe prices for Italian food is about equivalent as anywhere else but for the taste and quality of the ingredients. I thought I got a great deal.\n\nI wish my review was more detailed regarding price and all but after 4 glasses of wine, things started to get fuzzy.

The table were so close to each other where I could've barely fit through the gap, I had to slide through side ways to make sure I don't hit the table next to me (there were a couple sitting there!). Seem like they cram as many tables as they can to the little joint. The food wasn't bad, I had the Baked Lasagna which I admit is pretty darn good! But that's all I had to rave about... I ordered a diet coke with my food and I noticed it was canned (which is totally fine), until I notice they poured it into a cup FOR YOU and they kept the rest of whats left in the can to themselves! So that was a JIP, since I was craving my diet coke (you can only imagine since I was pregnant); and to get jipped for a can of coke. that was like $2 or $2.50 (not sure)! I think this place is waaay over priced for their food, it's decent & I get the fact its 100% authentic italian but then again I didn't see Italian cooks in the kitchen, I saw Latin cooks as usual.

Several people left the door open on the cold, wet, windy night and so some guests had to shout at them to shut it.\n\nEventually, we were seated an hour before our reservation thanks to the help of the very pleasant and friendly patriarch of the restaurant. He kept everyone entertained by singing, chatting, and making jokes. The rest of his family did a great job taking orders and clearing tables and bringing out food in the tight space. They were constantly smiling and made sure that we were happy.\n\nI ordered the salmon risotto with aurora sauce and my girlfriend ordered the mushroom ravioli. We started with the calamari. We were certain it was grilled marinated squid, so we were unhappy to see a salad delivered. It was, however, a light and tasty way to start the dinner. The roasted bell peppers in the salad were fantastic and I only wish that they put more on the plate.\n\nMy risotto was fantastic. It was a heaping plate of deliciously creamy risotto with a fabulous pink sauce. The salmon looked a bit anemic and lacked any color at all, but it tasted great.\n\nThe mushroom ravioli was great, as well. I thought the flavor was a bit overpowering, but my girlfriend loved it. We were both thrilled to see a plate of more than your typical 5 or 6 ravioli. The plate was filled with puffy pasta pillows of tasty wild mushrooms in a cream sauce.\n\nWe both saved room for dessert and boxed up the leftover entrees. She ordered a tiramisu. It looked and tasted fantastic. It was a fluffy, substantive coffee cream on top of soaked lady fingers. It was a far cry from your average tiramisu bars and it was the better for it.\n\nMy night was nearly ruined when I ordered a zabaglione and was told by the matriarch that the one man who knew how to make the zabaglione was out of the kitchen tonight.\n\nI have to admit. I put my hands to my face and shouted \"oh NO!\" at the news.

The atmosphere is nice and chill (dare i say romantic?) and the people are friendly, homely, and lively.  Giuspenni is the lovely motherly figure and Francisco is the loud, obnoxious (but cool) fatherly figure. Both combine to make an excellent and unique experience not found in other restaurants.  \n\n  It surprises me why they are not always full, but at the same time I am blessed for it allows me the pleasure to eat in comfort and peace.

Since moving to the west coast, I'd pretty much given up the idea of Italian food as a transcendental experience. Despite its location in the heart of North Beach tourist traps and astoundingly tacky decor- don't be fooled. This place is the real deal. \n\nThe daughter will take your order and Mom cooks it up-FAST. Our dishes practically flew out of the kitchen.  My boyfriend ordered salmon with some sort of butter sauce and was practically passing out from how good it was. Dude was seriously about to lose it.  I ordered the chicken parm and was initially feeling a bit wary about it when I saw it didn't have the standard crunchy breading- a naked, thin piece of chicken lying in sauce looked kinda weird. Then I tasted it. Whatever they did to mix the sauce and cheese together was unbelievable. Definitely some next level goings-on. Plus the pasta of the day- farfalle with meat sauce was quite tasty too. \n\nI'd say the food here is 6 stars minus 1 star for bread being meh, decor being in need of a refresh and the owner guy being a bit scary.  This IS where I'll be taking out of towners from now on.", "author": "jessica s."}

After walking around a bit, I stopped and decided to check out this restaurant which had a gentleman sitting outside.  He was wearing a fedora and a big welcoming smile.  The reviews on Yelp were good and the man with the hat turned out to be Frank the owner!  We decided to give it a try and we're glad we did!  Frank sat us at a very nice table with a view of the street (great for people watching). We then met his wife, Josephine, who treated us like we very special guests in her home.  Our two sons were with us and she made sure they were comfortable and well cared for.  We felt like we had found our long lost Italian family.

Perfectly puffy pillows of   potato-ey goodness = pure Heaven. \n\nWe came here first on Independence Day without reservations but the family was very accommodating. The second time was just 2 weeks ago on a slower night but we had the same exceptional experience. The dad greets everyone as they enter, or even out on the sidewalk, and you get the double cheek European kiss-kiss, mom is running around in her orthopedic shoes and support hose supervising the kitchen, wait staff, balancing on a step stool to get more wine, etc... The wait staff is their daughters and maybe a couple of others but we had the same waitress both visits so she must live there too. They also seem to be open when other places are closed like late Sunday nights. \n\nI had the gnocchi both times, the first time they customized the sauce for me blending the creamy Alfredo with marinara for a nice blush sauce. The second time I went with the cream sauce with a tiny hint of the Gorgonzola cream. It is very light and melts in your mouth and doesn't give you that heavy feeling later as if you have a sack of potatoes in your stomach. It is also offered with a pesto sauce, but like I said, you can ask for any pasta with any sauce, not just what they've designated on the menu. My friends have tried the Fettuccine Alfredo, lasagna, chicken parm and all were excellent. Had a bottle of red wine the first visit, cannot remember what, but it was medium priced, recommended by the waitress and was a very good choice. The second visit, only I was drinking so I had a glass of red wine, again can't remember what, but it was good. I think at the first visit we had either the Bruschetta or the Tomato-mozzarella Caprese salad and it was excellent also. \n\nOn to dessert... I've only tried the Tiramisu, along with my dinner companions, and it is great.... perfect creamy custard texture and the espresso flavor comes through ever so gently. Am I still talking about food?? I don't know, the sensation is too magic for words to describe. \n\nThe bathroom is small but well kept but be warned: the walls are thin and you can hear the kitchen noise from one side and patrons talking and clinking their dishes on the other as if they are in there with you. \n\nOK, the place is small, but I think that is part of its appeal. It's amazing what these people do in such a tiny space, juggling tables around in the tiny triangular shaped dining room to accommodate different sized parties that walk through the door. And I love the decor, the mirrors and giant reproductions of beautiful artwork especially the breathtaking \"Le Repos\" by Bouguereau http://www.bouguereau.org/Le-Repos-(Rest).html \nwhich I seem to be lucky enough to get seated in front of each time (and lucky enough to have seen the original at the Cleveland Museum of Art ;) My second visit was the day after Christmas so they had a few delicately placed light displays and potted Poinsettias along the windowsills.

We went to Franchino (my first time there) after seeing the reviews here and checking out the menu online. I wanted to go somewhere with a wide variety of pasta dishes, because I never know what I'm craving.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, the owner told us that there was a 5 minute wait. He was totally apologetic, and since it was a Saturday night, we were expecting to wait anyways. It's a relatively small, but comfy atmosphere. It's a family-run business. We ordered the Risotto Pescatora and Linguine con Vongole (seafood risotto and linguine with clams). We didn't have to wait long for the food. The risotto was delicious and there was a mix of salmon, squid, clams, shrimp, and mussels in the risotto. The salmon was nice and soft. The linguine came with a white wine sauce, and you can taste the wine, but it wasn't overpowering. \n\nThe seafood pasta dishes were about $17, and most other pasta dishes were about $14-15. Overall, the food was delicious, and the owner was incredibly friendly (and funny). He was singing and dancing to the music, and was a great host.

Because of the headache, they brought us a bruschetta as an apology for the mission, which added to family love and atmosphere. \n\nAs for the food, you are not eating food from a cook. Instantly, you will notice the mother walking around and you can notice her necklace, with a black and white photo of her mother with a red ribbon. Simply put, you are dining on a legacy of cooking, recipes, and flavors passed through generations and yet still preserved heritage. \n\nCraving veal parm, but had to try to the special. Forgot the name, but it was a long flat homemade pasta with italian sausage with a light and flavorful tomato cream sauce. The mother proudly told me her recipe, including how she hand-makes the pasta in the morning with her granddaughter and her secret to cream sauce..... pinch of gorgonzola cheese. \n\nAs we were eating, our neighbors were onto their desserts and the sight of this hand-dipped chocolate cannoli stopped me mid-sentence. Spying on your neighbors gastrofeast is a good precusor, but when you see a chain reaction of people ordering the same dessert and saying.. \"I want that!\"... is amazing.  Even as we got ours, we can see our new neighbords eyeballing my cannoli like a crack addiction.  Unfortunately, it was soo good, that it ruined all other cannolis for me now. \n\nThe food is amazing and comes with the pride of an Italian heritage that truly loves putting smiles around the dinner table while making people fat, just like any lovable italian grandmother. The uniqueness comes from a woman who loves what she does, creating strong family bonds through the pallete, but yet loves to share her knowledge. It is rare that a business oozes a family atmosphere as a priority instead of profitability, and it is much appreciated when this atmosphere triggers nostalgic memories. That is the power of food with love. \n\nFranchino, Thank You.", "author": "John S."}

As we waited for the rest of our party to show up and watched the small dining room fill up I was wondering if there was a magic VIP room that he was going to put us in.  Nope, we just had to wait 25 minutes after the ressie to sit.  Okay.\n\nSo the table that sat right after we did had wine and an appetizer before we even had our drink order taken.  Little annoyed.  The owner is boisterous and comically in a rough, Italian sort of way which wavered between entertaining and annoying.  We only got one of the two bottles of wine we ordered and he had to return to the table to say he missed an entree.  \n\nWe were really, really hungry so I don't even remember if the appetizers were good.  I think the bruschetta and caprese salad were pretty standard.  We had read good things about the gnocchi so most of us got that.  I had the tomato sauce and the others did all three sauces, which I regretted not doing.  The white sauce was the best (creamy yet slightly cheesy), then the pesto, then the tomato.  The gnocchi was fluffy and delicious, but nothing I would make the trip back to have again. Apparently the chicken Parmesan was fantastic, but I can't say I had a bite.\n\nIt was hard to get the attention of the waiter/owner so it was a struggle to get water refills, get our other bottle of wine, the check, etc.  We started working through the bus boy and the nice older lady that worked there which was a much less stressful option.  We opted to go to another location for dessert for this reason.  It was good, but nothing past that.

I was slightly skeptical based on the goofy portraits on the walls and the tables adorned with linens with the map of Italy. It is also quite small and a bit noisy.\n\nThat said... I had a 7PM reservation for 2, and got our table at exactly 7PM (which is when we walked in the door). That alone gets the place some stars - this city is full of places that can't seem to seat you at or near your reservation time. Pet peeve.\n\nThe wait staff and owner were friendly and attentive, and yes, they spoke Italian! Always a good sign. \n\nWe shared a house salad and split two entrees (a cheese manacotti special and the chicken marsala). Both were VERY good, and also the portions were just right. We finished everything and felt satisfied - not stuffed like the manacotti. We even had room for dessert - the panacotta. Nice... not fantastic, but nice.\n\nAnyway, Franchino has an extensive menu, a small (but decent) wine list, and a homey ambiance.

After looking at a few menus of nearby and next-door restaurant, we decided to enter here instead where, upon sitting in a TiGhT corner next to the ice-box, I noticed a cloth tablecloth showing Sardinia - finally I could show my sister where I was for almost two years!! Ordered a sauteed Calamari with Spaghetti ($14.95) in a tomato sauce of garlic and basil, while sis opted for the Spaghetti Carbonara ($14.95) served with ham, parmigiano cheese and eggs in a white sauce. She ate that up right away and my paste with squid was okay. The sauce however was excellent. I thought my dish was heated too hot (very) due to the calamari being stuck together. I was otherwise happy that the amount of calamari was quite plentiful. I agree with others in that the bread was stale, but I still used it to mop up as much of the tomato sauce as possible ~ that's how good it tasted! This all went down great with the house white wine, followed by a cappuccino that was enough to keep me awake for a few days!! aaaaaaaah...  ;-)  Sis also tried the tiramisu (see shaky pix) and at $6.95 a pop, it was small but very tasty!

Great family owned place....but the food was just ok.  The gnocchi was homemade but NOT handmade.  There's a big difference right there.  I ordered the risotto pescatore and it was just ok.  My partner ordered the gnocchi alla gorgonzola and it was ok but you can get about the same thing at trader joe's in the freezer section.  My mother tried the cappellini alla pomodoro, her favorite, and I felt there was a lack of flavor in general.  I tasted NO garlic, and to me that is just unexcuseable in an Italian restaurant.  The experience was fun, the family owned restaurant has alot of charm, but their food needs a refresher if they are trying to be authentic.

So we started out on foot up Columbus.  I had heard of the Stinking Rose, we ventured over to check out the menu.  In the process I recalled that Yelper's had posted about a small family owned restaurant a few doors away, so we ventured up the block.  And to our delight we found Franchino!\n\nThe owner was out front, and as we were pondering whether to go in, he assured us that \"if you don't like, I pay for your meal\".  So what did we have to lose, right? By this point, I was sucked in, how could I say \"No\" to someone so passionate about his business?  As only an Italian gent could do, he reached out and took my hand (I am a gal, by the way) and led us into the restaurant.  As we were being seated, he introduced himself, wife, daughter ... indeed this IS authentically an Italian family business.\n\nI've been reading other reviews this morning, let me get a few things out of the way...\n\nYes - the restaurant is quite small, roughly 15 tables which themselves are relatively small (by American standards) and close together, and all were full.  But once we got settled, we and everyone dining with us seemed at ease, comfortable and content.\n\nYes - the owner is a character ... spends most of his time strolling through the restaurant, or out front welcoming customers, blurts out some Italian phrase or lyrics randomly from time to time ... but we found this enchanting, not distracting or annoying.  Really folks, how often do you have the opportunity to even meet the owner of any establishment anymore?  And have the pleasure of supporting a family's livelihood with your patronage?  So what if they are a bit eccentric?  Lighten up, people!\n\nNo - this is NOT a good place to bring a party larger than 4 people.  We were a party of 3, and happily we were seated immediately, but at a table in the \"middle\" of the room which ideally seats 2.  At first we thought \"uh oh\" (me and two tall men), but again, once we settled in, we were fine.  The 2 diners adjacent to us were asked to scoot over one table so they could get a party of 4 seated together, the \"scooters\" were not put off by this in the least.  But if you don't like this sort of \"folksy\" ambiance, don't dine here.\n\nNo - don't bother making reservations, if you have a time constraint, allow sufficient time to accommodate a relatively short wait.  The service was prompt and friendly and we have no complaints.  We considered ourselves lucky to get in quickly on a Friday evening, but who knows, we may have \"bumped\" someone with a reservation.\n\nAll this being said, if you are seeking a casual, comfortable and delicious Italian meal, we highly recommend Franchino!\n\nI agree with previous postings, for us greedy Americans, the menu options may be limited (relative to larger establishments), but who cares, as long as what you order is great, right?\n\nOur entrees were absolutely wonderful - all 3 of us raved about our meals.  \nI had ravioli in porcini mushroom sauce, it was outrageously good, possibly the best ravioli dish I have ever eaten.  Caesar salad was tasty, ask for light dressing if you are sensitive to this, good but not special.\nHubby had veal Parmesan, tender enough to cut with his fork, I'm not an expert on veal myself, but he proclaimed it \"the best\" he has ever eaten.\nOur guest is visiting from Europe, he ordered gnocchi because a) he loves it, and b) it is one of the most difficult dishes to \"do right\" and he wanted to give them the ultimate test (in his book).  He was thrilled, found it to be top notch (high praise from one who eats in the real Italy), and when done sopping up the Gorgonzola sauce his plate was almost clean enough to reuse!\nBread was served with the meal, nothing special there by SF bread standards.  But with a bottle of wine and our entrees, we were \"fat, dumb and happy\" when we waddled back out onto the street.\nPrices were reasonable by San Francisco standards, 3 entrees, one side salad, 1 bottle of wine, $100 (not including tip).\n\nCan I say this is the \"best Italian food in San Francisco\" ?\nWell, truthfully no, BUT only because I live in the 'burbs and (until now) have not been one to dine in San Francisco often.  So I'm not qualified to make this claim.\nCan I say this is some of the best Italian food I have ever eaten, San Francisco or elsewhere?  ABSOLUTELY!!!!\n\nWe were hosting our Dutch guest, our intention was to take him to an authentic San Francisco establishment, show him an \"America\" he would not find in a strip mall.  \nMission accomplished ... in spades!\n\nThank you, Franchino Family!  \nCan't wait to dine here again!", "author": "Cheryl M."}

I had read about the warm family-run ambiance from fellow yelpers, so I had to go check it out. I met up with my friend Celia last nite, and while I was outside waiting, the owner Franco introduced himself. He's great! It was \"not a problem\" that I didn't have a reservation. And when I felt bad for standing outside too long, he told me \"no problem - it's a Tuesday night.\" He asked me if I minded that he closed the door since it was a bit chilly, and then stood outside in the cold with me. We conversed. He told me about the specials that his wife had made that evening. And when Celia and I finally got inside, his wife said she would take care of us (I think she takes care of all the patrons). We ordered the cozze marinara (mussels with spicy red wine sauce), Celia ordered the pasta carbonara (with prosciutto, mushrooms, and cream sauce) and I got the gnocchi in Gorgonzola sauce. The food was delicious! We topped off our meal with an order of tiramisu, which confused us for a minute because it was presented to us like a cheesecake - but no worries, it tastes like tiramisu. It was creatively presented. The grand finale? As we were about to leave, Franco shushes the entire restaurant because the lady at the table came all the way from PA to hear him sing. Of course we couldn't leave (I can imagine him running after us and scolding us for walking out on him). He had a \"headache,\" so he said he would only sing a little. It was a great performance, and before he could end the song, his mother jumped in with the final lines. He looked \"upset\" that she stole his thunder. \n\nA great family run restaurant, for a great home cooked Italian meal. Definitely a place to come back to!", "author": "Annie Y."}

After looking on Yelp for an \"Italian restaurant in North Beach\" (real hard, I know) and finding this as a top rated $$ place, we decided to take a few friends from out of town here. It's not too big so we made reservations and were seated pretty promptly upon arrival (we moved our reservation earlier with just an hour til our actual time so it was okay to wait). Upon arrival we felt like we had stepped into someone's italian home.  The place is run by a family so that makes it even better. For our appetizers, five of us split two: Calamari salad which everyone who ate calamari enjoyed and grilled red pepper with smoke mozarella...this was so good.. smoked mozarella made the dish so incredibly tasty. For our main courses two got the penne arrabiata (did i spell that right?), two others chose the veal/chicken papardelle special in a red sauce, and I got linguine with clams in a white wine sauce. I tried all three of these dishes and they were exquisite. We LOVED every single one. Each one seemed so freshly made ... because it was. As we enjoyed probably what I want to say was the best tiramasu any of us had hands down ever had and a very yummy cannoli, the lady who ran the place came over and we showered her with compliments. She then proceeded to explain to us why the food was so good. The kitchen is very small at the restaurant so she makes the pastas at home before coming in. Then the only things that are pre-made are the sauces. Everything is made right when it's ordered so it tastes just that fresh! The tiramasu, unlike many places who freeze and then defrost to serve was made that day with a perfect creamy texture and incredibly crispy base of some type of cookie. It was so nice of her (we were the last table left) to just chat with us and tell us about how and why the food was this delicious. We are planning to go back here this Thursday because we can't wait to try other things on the menu. If you want different, homemade italian food in a great, cozy setting, this is the place for you.

Unfortunately, when we walked to the restaurant from our hotel we saw that it was closed and just ate next door at Mona Lisa.  The food at Mona Lisa was average, and it made me more determined to eat at Franchino's before we left.  So the day we were planning to leave, I wanted to stop by Molinari's for a sandwich but noticed that Franchino's was open.   We went inside and noticed that we were the only ones there but that wasn't  too surprising since it was only 4pm.  We found the owners to be beyond hospitable and extremely friendly.  I ordered the seafood linguine while my boyfriend ordered one of the \"specials of the day\" which was a homemade parppadelle with a sausage and mushroom sauce.  OMG, the food was amazingly good!!  What made it so good was the fact that it tasted homemade, and not like the food you would normally get at an Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill.  It was probably one of the best Italian meals I've had outside of Italy.  Also, the portions weren't too bad either.  It was just enough to leave you satisfied but not overly full.

We found it by chance, and were surprised by its authenticity. Being Italian, we have always been skeptical of everything Italian-American, and especially of the restaurants. \nI have been living a couple of years in the States by now, and I am still suspicious of \"Italian\" cuisine here, and yet Franchino's dishes do taste right! And I like the family business atmosphere. Tonight, when I went back there with my boyfriend after ten years of absence, Franchino's wife (supposing the owner's name is actually Franchino) sweetly gave to my boyfriend advice about learning Italian. Also, I did not remember the desserts being so delicious! In particular, the tiramisu' was one of the best I ever had!\n\nSince people are already so enthusiastic, I prefer to talk about the minuses. True, the owner is very bad with organizing the tables, and true, reservations are not that useful (unless maybe in reducing the waiting a little bit: with a reservation, we waited a bit more than half an hour, but a group of people without it waited for an hour-- but it could have been due to the number, who knows). I personally don't care, but if you mind waiting, go on a weekday and early or late.\nFurthermore, to me it's really overpriced. A pasta dish for 18 dollars (the pappardelle with funghi and salsiccia I had tonight) is really expensive for what it is. But I guess it may be fair here, given that other cheaper places are much worse in terms of quality.\nFinally, the pasta dishes have too much sauce: my pappardelle with salsiccia was more like salsiccia with pasta!

He then sits us at a tiny table for two and adds an extra chair to make it suitable for three. This would have all really annoyed me except for the fact that the food was awesome. I think I would have sat in the little crevice between the bathroom and the kitchen if I could eat more of the Tiramisu.

We looked at the menu's outside of several restaurants - you know, you just get this feeling of \"ah ha!\" when you feel like you found the right one. (I love the experience of Italian restaurant shopping, just like old times at the Gaslamp Quarter in Downtown San Diego!)\n\"Mona Lisa\" intrigued me so we crossed the street, and a guy started talking to us with a heavy Italian accent. We were somewhat overwhelmed by the number of choices on the menu. So we walked over to the next restaurant where the owner also came out to talk to us saying, \"This is the best restaurant... etc.\"\nI like to say I'm half bay area native, but obviously am not a SF native, since it was very weird how aggressive all the restaurant owners were!\n\nWell, we decided to go in without knowing even the restaurant name. The menu looked good with all typical Italian pastas - fettuccine alfredo, pesto, clam sauce, etc. I didn't pay much attention to a lot since I was starving... I decided to order the Fettuccine Franchino, which had prosciutto, mushrooms, and peas in a cream sauce. It kinda reminded me of carbonara. I don't think it wouldn't have mattered if I weren't starving - I could tell it tasted GREAT. My friend also liked his Fettuccine al Pesto with chicken. \nPrices for pastas were reasonable - about $12 to $20 per dish, I don't know about wines since I don't drink wine. Everything of what I remember seemed reasonable though.\n\nWe really liked the restaurant and felt proud that we chose Cafe Franchino. There was a restaurant we passed by earlier, which was obviously very showy and touristy since there were a bunch of people eating outside on the street with a singer serenading a diner. Not that there is wrong with being a tourist, but it didn't seem like too much fun to go with the \"obviously\" popular one. We always look for the restaurants with a decent number of customers too. \nFranchino had a good balance of popularity, good menu items, and reasonable prices; and the \"good feeling\" became more apparent to us during the meal, because we realized that it was a family owned restaurant with father, mother, daughter, son in law, etc. You can't help but feel good about dining at a mom/pop restaurant that only natives may only know about.\n\nWhen I visit San Francisco again, I will definitely try to go there again. =)", "author": "Annette A."}

They were more than happy to let me order something off-menu (apologizing for my food snobbery) but the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was when the bottle of wine we ordered with dinner ran dry, Franchino came to our table with another bottle and refilled our glasses (gratis) saying \"I hate seeing an empty wine glass.\" 5 stars all the way!", "author": "Jonathan B."}

So I hopped on Yelp (where else?) to see what folks had to say. There certainly are folks in both camps for Franchino, but we decided to give it a whirl, and boy were we pleasantly surprised!\n\nEveryone in our group was a bit put off by the barkers on the street trying to lure in business, but that's a fact of life when your stock in trade is serving tourists who have absolutely no idea where to eat when they're stomachs start to rumble. And the inside didn't help a lot - think Liberace with a *tad* less glitter and you get a vague notion of the insides of the place. But it IS charming in its own funny way...\n\nBut the highlight (as it should be) was the food. Folks in our group ordered everything from pasta to chicken to eggplant and each person cleaned his/her plate and was relatively silent while doing so - quite a compliment! I thoroughly enjoyed the risotto San Francisco - served with lumps of crab and partial crab legs stirred into it. Yum!\n\nAnd I thought the service was efficient.

The family that runs the place was very friendly and provided good service.  We called that night, about an hour before and made a reservation.  Once we got there, we had to wait about 10 or 15 minutes, which is no big deal at all, especially for a Saturday night in North Beach.\nI had the gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce, which they said they were \"known for\".  I loved it.  I never order Gnocchi when I go out to eat, ever.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy what they got, from Veal to Salmon to Seafood Risotto.  The food wasn't 5 star, but it was more then good enough.  Add that to the real Italian family kitchen feel and the neighborhood ambiance and I feel its worth the 4 stars.  And Yes, the bread is cold and lifeless, but know that and don't expect more.\nAlso, we brought in our own bottle of wine and with out a word, the waitress offered to open it for us right off and charged us the customary 20$ corkage.  They never tried to push or upsale us at all, which was nice.\nOne note about wait time:  The place is SMALL, maybe holds like 30 or so.  While we were there finishing up, a customer that made a reservation got very upset and created a scene about having to wait for 30 minutes past his reservation time.  He got angry and was raising his voice saying \"why do you take reservations if you can't honor them, I'm NEVER coming back.\" Etc.  I'm sorry, but if waiting 30 min's on a NICE Saturday evening gets your panties in that much of a wad, what are you doing at a place like this? This is NOT fine dining.

It's been a week since our visit and I'm still upset about our poor choice.  First, the food was awful - nothing was seasoned correctly.  The linguine & clams were dry and tasteless; the risotto was the worst I've ever had.  In fact, it tasted like burnt butter.  The veal parmigian was overcooked and way too salty.  Out of a party of 8, only 1 person was satisfied with their meal and I really think they were just being nice about the horrible situation.  Also, I made a point to let the hostess know we were celebrating a birthday the day I made the reservations.  I then reminded the hostess when we arrived that we were celebrating a birthday.  After our crappy meal, I again told the waitress twice of our birthday celebration --- nothing!  No acknowledgment, no dessert -- actually, no offer to even purchase dessert either.  Oh and the owner, I hear (actually read from all the reviews) that he sings at your table.  Really people?!  All the owner did the whole time we were there was smoke right outside the font door which, in turn, smelled up the whole place!  Never, never, NEVER again would I step foot near this hell hole!!!!!", "author": "Judy L."}

Most places are overpriced, no where near authentic and some are just plan bad. \n\nUpon entry, we received a brilliant greeting by pop \"Ciao, buona sera, come belle raggazzi! Bellissime! \" Franchino is a little (unhidden) treasure owned by an adorable mom and pop. The decor is very homey and cozy. You feel like you may have walked into their own dining room. Small tables fill the restaurant and photos line the walls. The menu is short and sweet: different varieties of pastas, meats, desserts and wines. We were waited on by pop himself and he is a riot. I almost felt like I was at the House of Nanking and I'll tell you why. I couldn't make up my mind, so I asked pop what he recommended. Pop: \"You like rice?\"\nMe: \"As in risotto, certo\"\nPop: \"You like seafood?\"\nMe (a little hesitant): \"Definitely\" (Hoping that his definition of seafood wasn't old, smelly fish)\nHe scribbled something on his notepad and 30 minutes later I was staring at the most incredible salmon and asparagus risotto! It was a gamble, but it was worth it. My friends had the Gorgonzola gnocchi and the sausage pappardelle. Everything was totally delish. The service is a little slow, but I chalk it up to part of the charm. Franchino is charming, tasty and reasonably priced. We didn't try dessert, so we'll have to go back soon.

Two got gnocchi and my pesto was great and had a little red pepper in the middle for nice presentation.  The other gnocchi with red sauce got some green parsley for the opposite contrast.  I sampled some squid from another's Pasta Pescatora which had a huge amount and variety of seafood in it and it was really good.  I might get than next time, though I'm not big into digging into clam shells to get that meat.   Bread was average, but there's enough carbs already in pasta that I didn't require outstanding bread.  Waitress was nice and personable and the patriarch of the place was amusing in his antics.  Bill was $31 a person with a bottle of wine and 3 of 5 people getting salad/soup.

We got complimentary bread. It was not stale at all. I must stress on this. It tasted great with sweet creamy butter or with olive oil/ balsamic vinegar. Yummy. Are total was $36 not bad at all.  \n\nI tasted both dishes. Our server added more grated Parmesan. The sauces were very rich and creamy. Ample taste and rich in flavor. I liked my wife's dish more. The food is very yummy!! \n\nI mentioned it was my wife's Bay but no complimentary desert, but we were too full. But it would have been a nice gesture as we were new to the place.

We got there at six and it was empty, which was perfect because we got the full effect of the owner and his family.  I had the Spaghetti Calamari and it was ridiculously good.  Aside from the food being really good, the constant entertainment was totally worth it.  The owner at one point asked my date to go outside and tell someone smoking a cigar to leave and smoke it somewhere else, even though he had smoked about 5 since we'd been there.  He also insisted that I finish off a bottle of his wine, which I was happy to help with since it was yummy.

As a solo woman traveler I was looking for something less touristy, reasonably priced and where I would feel comfortable dining alone. The cute italian couple who run the place really make the atmosphere, I felt like I was visiting my (nonexistent) Italian grandparents. Franchino seemed surprised and amused that I was a woman dining alone which was funny. I ended up meeting a fellow solo traveler sitting next to me and we decided to eat together which was awesome! I had the caprese salad which wasn't great. it's served on a bed of soggy lettuce and the mozzarella wasn't fresh but it was edible. I also had the gnocchi in tomato sauce which was delicious. I would recommend it. My dining companion had the eggplant appetizer and the veal entree and said she enjoyed both. The best part of the place was the service and talking to Franchino and his wife.

I searched YELP, and all the other possible resources out there for HOURS AND HOURS, looking to find the BEST reviews, so I could take my family to the most amazing Italian dinner of their lives. I am happy to say this Saturday night, we had that meal...so please let me share with you a lil bit about our experience, so if you are in search of this same meal, you will be just as pleased....or at least you will be able to make a decision, based on your needs/wants! This little restaurant is truly a family operated, very small, but cozy, and surprisingly not TOO HOT INSIDE restaurant's we first arrived, my only complaint was that we had made reservations a week in advance and we were seated at a two top with three people....the two I was with do not like to feel hot and sweaty well they eat, so I was a lil worried, luckily it all worked out though, it was not uncomfortable at all.....We ordered a bottle of wine, the prices were excellent, but the choice in wines could be a little better. Lots of Italian reds though...if that's your thing...My boyfriend ordered the lasagna, his mom, the chicken Parmesan, and myself the Gnocchi, because I had to see what all the hype was about...anyway...the red sauce and the lasagna, definitely was the best meal we ordered. Then I would have to say the Gnocchi, now since, I have never tried it before, i cannot judge, other then to say it tasted very fresh and homemade...all the pasta tasted FRESH homemade, like they had just cooked up the dough...the Pesto Sauce...amazing...the Red Sauce, even more amazing...the Chicken Parmesan I would not recommend, if you have to have the chicken breaded, although the owners wife told us why they don't bread it, and it made perfect sense....the egg yolk, if not used can not be saved until the next day, or people would get sick, and they want to avoid that, I like that cause it shows me they care about their customers...Anyway...I was very very happy with my meal...The lasagna was the best any of us had ever had....the dessert we had the homemade Cannoli, and a Cappuccino, sooo yummmy!

The gnocchi with pesto was really good - well cooked and great pesto sauce.  Unfortunately, the serving size was fit for a small child.  The carbonara was awful.  We have had a LOT of carbonara and this was one of the worst!\n\nNone of those things were really the problem, though.  Our main issue was how terrible the waitresses made us feel for not ordering an appetizer, dessert or wine.  I understand that they are paid with tips which come largely from the size of the bill, but I would think customer service is always the most important thing.  They continously asked us whether we were getting anything else and generally made us feel really uncomfortable.  We had plans to go to dessert somewhere else, and I almost felt like I had to justify myself!\n\nAgain, the family seems nice.

One evening upon finishing dinner, we were taking a walk up Columbus Street.  We happened to look in this restaurant and a gentlemen sitting on the table outside eating started talking to us saying that he dines there every evening and the food is great.  We went in to get a business card and the owner was so nice and friendly.  We said we would try this restaurant the next time we got together.  Had the customer not spoken to us, we would not have noticed this place.  This restaurant is stuck in between the Stinking Rose restaurant and Mona Lisa restaurant.  On Friday, we were getting together and decided to try it out.  My friends and I met at 6:30 PM and there was no one in the restaurant.  At first we were hesitant in going in because there was no one in the restaurant so we weren't sure.  We decided to try it to help out the little mom and pop family restaurant.  As we entered, the owner greeted us and was so friendly.  He made us feel at home.  We ordered Ravioli Porcini, italian wild mushroom sauce, which was a creamy sauce with meat.  The ravioli was the smaller sized ones and reminded me of the raviolis my dad use to make.  Another dish was Chicken Marsala, marsala wine and mushrooms served with pasta on the side.  The special was the pappardelle, which is their homemade flat, fat pasta with Italian sausage, tomato, mushrooms and garlic.  As we were eating, more people came in and the restaurant was slowly being filled up.  We think the waitress is the daughter.

One bite and I knew I had made a tragic mistake. The overwhelming flavor was salt; bleh, think Chef Boyardee. Speaking of which, the side pasta appeared to actually be Chef Boyardee; a bland pasta in meat sauce (no warning of that the sauce would be a meat sauce, I hate meat sauce.)  My wife ordered a pasta with Shrimp and ordered it spicy; it came mild. While better than what I endured it was still not worth leaving the house. For dessert the cannoli was quite good, though I have not had coffee that bitter since the dark days of basic training at Fort Leonard Wood circa 1990.

My assessment of the risotto was a lost cause but I still had an opportunity to try what my spouse had ordered.  My spouse had gnocchi alla gorgonzola and fresh shaved parmigiana would not have rescued the sauce.  The gnocchi themselves were good, though.  Overall, the highlight were the glasses of wine.  We were offered dessert/caffe but based on the show this evening, passed, and decided to scratch Franchino off our list.", "author": "Ken A."}

I cannot say the same for the owner. My party (6 people) was having a great evening. We were finishing off our wine and dessert when the owner suddenly yanked the chair out from underneath my friend and gave it to another table. When I politely questioned why he did that, he told me to be quiet. He is also very forward with women and insisted on kissing everyone (to a point of being creepy). The owner really ruined our night and I would not recommend this restaurant because of him. He is loud and obnoxious.", "author": "Marcus B."}

The food was good for sure.  The portion is what bothered me.  I ordered a chicken dish (I don't recall which one) with prosciutto, mushrooms, and onions.  Delicious!  The problem was the amount of chicken.  Three 1/4\" slices of chicken breast.  If I am going to pay $15-$20 for a chicken dish, I expect a chicken breast.  Everything else about the place was great, but I felt nickel and dimed by the half serving of chicken.  I am a big guy and like to work out and do not want to fill up on pasta.  I need my protein.  They would be well served to offer a larger portion as an option.  Good food though, and if you don't mind a small portion of meat, you'll like this place.", "author": "John M."}

Food was good - 4 star worthy but service was completely indifferent - 2 stars at best.  I felt like we were a burden to our server though the bus boy was much friendlier.   Won't return again.  Entrees were also about $3-5 more than better places down the street.", "author": "Stacy N."}

Whenever I've come by, it seems to be the same family running the place.  The food, however, is fairy hit or miss.  I had a risotto dish and loved it.  There were bits of savory porcino mushrooms that were heavenly.  We tried the tiramaisu and that was fantastic (and home made).  The pasta dishes were mediocre, but the duck was simply disappointing.  It was flat and felt tough.  It was also tiny.  The cannoli was also fell short of our expectations.  Were it not for the lack of consistency, I wouldn't be so hesitant about going back.", "author": "Raz R."}

The server was very knowledgeable (I think she may have been related to the owner), and helped us make our selections even though we had a vegan among us (i.e., not Italian food-friendly). We had the best bruschetta I have ever had, it was light and clean, you can tell they had used a really great Extra Virgin Olive Oil, because it had such a fresh taste. All of the non-vegans shared our entrees (Cannelloni Della Casa, Gnocchi, Risotto with red sauce), and we all were happy with what we ordered. My cannelloni was fresh, had great sauce and cheese, and tasted authentic. We splurged on desserts (berries and mascarpone or zabaglione, I don't remember; tiramisu; and something else with berries that was awesome), which completed our meal nicely. I'm bringing my Sicilian grandmother back with me; we don't have the same cuisine but I know she would appreciate their hospitality.", "author": "Danielle D."}

This should tell you something right off the bat.  Franchino is soooooo good, it compelled me to finally create my own log-in and spend time writing a review.  I'd also like to mention that I've lived in North Beach for 2 years now and consider myself, not officially, but informally, a \"pasta connoisseur\".  This is definitely tied for first as far as the best Italian I've EVER had.  I brought my mom here for her birthday and we were seated almost immediately by the daughter of this quaint family-owned restaurant.  We started off with a glass of wine each and an order of bruschetta.  Now, I've never eaten IN Italy but this has got to be the best, and probably most authentic, bruschetta I've ever tasted!!!  It was orgasmic!  We didn't let a single piece of tomato escape.  Each one was perfectly toasted with the just the right combination of garlic, olive oil and tomatoes.  Pure heaven!  Then our entrees arrived...her's the Gnocchi Gorgonzola, mine the Tortellini Alfredo.  Oh. my. goodness.  BOTH cooked to perfection.  The gnocchi literally melted in my mouth while the tortellini were perfectly al dente.  The alfredo; also incredible.  Not too thick, not too watery, with just a hint of nutmeg for utter satisfaction.  Now, I also need to mention that I eat out quite a bit and it's literally been YEARS since I've walked away WITHOUT a to-go box, but this time, I couldn't bare to leave anything untouched.  Nope, nothing this good!  I cleaned my plate, every last drop...We finished off the night with the homemade tiramisu, a very pleasant finale.  I'll admit, not the BEST I've ever had, but still wonderfully good.  Don't let that stop you from giving it a try.  All in all, I will be back; many, many, many more times.", "author": "Kelly H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-31", "description": "We ordered the risotto and home made pasta in tomato sauce. The pasta sauce tasted what real tomato sauce should be. The risotto had a slight ting to it and its refreshing vegetables. The ambiance of the restaurant was quaint. The only problem was getting seated. When we entered we couldn't get the host's attention to get seats. It was a bit intimidating. But once we were seated the Italian host (who I assume is the owner) for very amiable and seemed a bit tipsy. Overall, the service was hasty, the food was excellent and I would definitely go again.", "author": "Will S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-03", "description": "It's nice because it's not fancy or big.  The menu is large, though.  The family run aspect really does add something to the experience.  If you are looking for a place that serves a lot of pasta dishes, this is a great place to go.  It's definitely not my favorite Italian in SF, but it was very good.  I had the special, penne with chicken, mushroom, and veal and the overall flavor was great but the texture of the meats left a little something to be desired.  My grandma loved the meat lasagna and my mom ate the entire plate of chicken parm.  My husband and I shared the starter salad, which was huge and filled with veggies, so we only ate about half of our pasta.  I can't remember the name of what he had but it had ham in it, which was quite good.  Entrees run $15-20 for dinner and you get a decent sized portion for that price.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

We stumbled upon this small family run restaurant like 9 years ago and it's really the only place we go to in North Beach anymore.  After trying \"Stinking Rose\" right next store and a few others, this one always wins out in every category (quality, service, noise level to name a few).  Franchino is fantastic as are his wife and daughter(s).  I also LOVE supporting one of the only family run restaurants left in North Beach.", "author": "Jessica H."}

After reading other reviews here we were careful to arrive on time and prepared for a short wait for our table - but no problem: The very friendly owner met us out front and we 4 were seated right on time for our 7pm reservation.   My wife had the caneloni special. I had the cheese ravioli with mushroom sauce, daughter #1 had the seafood pasta and daughter #2 had the pesto gnochi.  We started with house salads and finished with a shared tiramisu. All of these were excellent - some of the best Italian I have had - and I've had plenty.", "author": "MJG C."}

My husband and I ate here recently and really enjoyed our entire experience. It is family ran business and they take the time to get to know something about all of their customers. It is apparent that they really take care of everyone, especially their local customers, like us! After our meal we were given two complementaries glasses of port wine, an added bonus to our wonderful evening. I had the vegetable lasagna. It was very very cheesy and not a lot of vegetables so I do not think I would get it again, or I would order the meat lasagna. My husband had the Cippino, which he really enjoyed with fresh grilled vegetables and the best garlic bread (so good, I ate it). We got their at 6pm on a Friday night and were seated without any delay. We look forward to our next visit, that is for sure!", "author": "amy s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-08-23", "description": "My in laws were in town and I thought it would be fun to take them to North Beach for some Italian food.  Instead of going to my tried and true places like Tomaso's and Sodinis, I decided to branch out.  Franchino had a lot of great reviews so I made reservations.  Franchino is facing Columbus street and has the total vibe of your basic tourist trap.  I was hoping that in spite of the lack of ambiance, the food would shine.  Not the case.  The food was very disappointing.  First off, we had some basic salads.  The tomatoes were waxy and had no flavor and it is tomato season!  For my main I had the linguini and clams which was too salty.  My mother in law had an inedible penne pasta dish that was so spicy one could only eat a few bites.  The waitress assured her beforehand that it was not really spicy at all.  My husband ordered the lasagna that was not very good either.  Rather than being smothered in a tangy meat sauce the way we prefer, it was more the kind of lasagna that is made with an overly creamy bechamel sauce.  I found it too creamy and somewhat bland.   The service was friendly,  but not great.  My main course did not arrive at that same time as everyone else's which is always awkward and annoying.   i will not go back to Franchino.", "author": "Denise M."}
