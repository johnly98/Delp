{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-09-15", "description": "This review is for 3.5 stars. \n\nReally good drinks to start. Priced fairly at about $12-13 for fresh crafted cocktails that are made in front of you with precision. Interesting concoctions with a bunch of whiskey and bourbon based as well as more softer and mintier options as well. Beer game is week but they do have a few of each type of wines if cocktails aren't your game. \n\nThe bad part came with the bouncer. First off, not sure it's necessary to have an outright bouncer at a low key cocktail bar - it's a bar not a club. Second, he was very pushy on kicking us all out at 2am with drinks in hand. We ordered our last cocktail at last call around 1:45am. So obviously we still had a few sips at least at 2am. Instead of letting us finish as would be normal courtesy he told us to either chug our cocktails or leave them and go. Apparently he wanted to go home at exactly 2 and he had better places to be. Seems strange and rude to be served a pricy well crafted drink only to have to chug it. Either push last call up 10 more minutes or have some type of window on the strict close policy. There were multiple groups there all still with drinks in hand so wasn't a singular problem. Very poor representation on the bars part as a result of this bouncer. \n\nServers were great beyond that and very reactive to our needs. But this rubbed us the wrong way. Only reason we came here was that the bar next door closed early. Not worth a late night cap unless you're ready to chug.", "author": "Zachary A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-08", "description": "Nice place with plenty of bartenders and a good collection of whiskeys. However, when we were there, it was so loud that we couldn't hear one another across the table. So, if you're looking for a place to chill and have a conversation, this may not be the best place unless you're sitting next to each other at the bar or on one of the benches. \n\nThere is a \"smoking cage,\" which is a patio with a glass wall. Unfortunately, the seal between that and the rest of the bar is kind of weak and smoke blew into the place whenever the door was opened. I don't know if it bothered anyone else, but I was sitting right near the door.\n\nI started with the \"cure all,\" which had a nice spiced flavor, but did lose any personality of the whiskey. A good sipper, though. Next, for something different, I tried the Coco Bitter, which had whiskey, creme de cacao and coconut milk, with a sprig of mint. This is probably a good one for those who don't like whiskey at all: it tasted really sweet and minty, like a peppermint patty. I'm not a fan of drinks like that, but it was executed well and I'm sure it has its audience.\n\nFor the final choice, I went to the completely opposite end of the spectrum with the \"gin ne sais quoi,\" which was a gin-forward cocktail on their feature board. It is worth checking that board when you arrive to see what they're working on that day. I like gin. Maybe not as much as I once did, but my complaint about the other two drinks did not apply here: I could definitely taste the gin. Probably not the best one to end the night on, but I'm glad I tried it.\n\nCocktails on their menu are $12-13 at this time, with a few offered for $2 less during happy hour. If you're looking for whiskey shots, they have an extensive collection in all kinds of price ranges. For example, I saw an impressive collection of Japanese whisky from Suntory: wide coverage of both the single malt and blended offerings across several age ranges.", "author": "Doug B."}

Granted I only ever visit on weeknights. But that works perfect for me. \n\nMy homie Ruggerford introduced me to this haunt many moons ago and I've never looked back. I've consumed libations in many of this city's iconic craft bars, and Rye easily holds its own. There's a nice mix of spirit-forward drinks and creative shaken concoctions as well. The prices track average cocktail prices for this caliber of drinks. And I rarely taste anything I don't like.

Typically, it's in the upper 20s- 40s crowd.\n\nThe music is not tailored to one specific style and is enjoyable -- aside from it being TOO loud; I like to not shout at people or hover too close just for them to hear me and vice versa. Honestly, this style of unbearable loudness is overrated and trying too hard to be young.\n\nThis place is smaller than I remember it to be, so it can get a little cozy but it's not too bad --- we hopped over here from another lounge on Halloween.  \n\nOverall, this place is decent and it fulfilled our enjoyment of the party we attended, but it was not incredibly amazing to revisit a third time.", "author": "Roze T."}

I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a nice refreshing drink. Spicy and bubbly, but it still packed an alcoholic punch. Turned out to be a nice drink to start off the night. The old fashioned wasn't really my style. It was rather sweet and the creme de cacao gave it an odd flavor. I like a more straight forward old fashioned.\n\nI liked the vibe of Rye. I seriously haven't been here in 8+ years, but I remembered it having a dark boozy atmosphere. Yesterday, it was light and fun. I liked their leather ottomans / chairs and tables.

For my drink I got the Pimm's Cup #5 as it was told to be one of the most popular. For $10, you'll get their house-made creation of a Pimm's number 5 with a rye whiskey base, lemon, English cucumbers, mint, ginger syrup and seltzer, garnished with a mint sprig. Definitely a GREAT DRINK. The mint and ginger flavors married well and the seltzer gave it a little kick.

The door to the smoking area outside also doesn't close on its own, hardly an issue for me I am more concerned with the bathroom door.\n\nSo you are sitting on this nice leather couch talking with your date and either you tolerate the smell of the smoke and the blinding fluorescent light emanating from the bathroom... or you get up every 6 minutes to close doors.\nI generally make sure to close doors behind me as it is how I was raised.

Watching her mix the drink was true art, she tasted it several times adding different ingredients and even brought out the electronic whisk to foam up the egg whites! The drink tasted like a sherbert, yum! \n\nService is a bit slow, but it's because the bartenders are taking their time to make good drinks. Which they should, given the cocktails are about $15 (including tip). So it's a bit pricey at $30 for 2 cocktails but what do you expect in downtown San Francisco... \n\nThis place has a bougie, laid back vibe. No ratchet drunkness going on. Everyone was sipping on cocktails and the place was full but not overly crowded. Our group of 6 all had seats at a table in the back.

It goes without saying that they also mix a damn fine cocktail. \n\nRye doesn't seem to feel the need to impress you with a comically massive wall of every liquor imaginable and bartenders with bow ties. So many cocktail establishments feel cold and intimidating in this sense. Rye's bar area is relatively small with a laid back feel that makes it easy to chat up a neighbor. I'm not going to pretend I'm any expert on cocktails, and theirs are just as pricey as anywhere else, but I appreciate their laid back attitudes and willingness to play around with recipes. \n\nIf you don't think Lower Nob Hill and the Tenderloin have much to offer as far as a classy drink, think again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-24", "description": "Why Rye, why!?\n\nWhy are you located in such a sketch area??\n\nThankfully, I was with an individual who doubled as my bodyguard. I already had my cocktail-crazed eyes glued to the $10 PIMM'S CUP #5, a house-made recreation of the original Pimm's No. 5 with a rye whiskey base, lemon, english cucumber, mint, ginger syrup, and seltzer. Ultimately, my friend decided on the special written on the board: the $11 \"This Ancho First Rodeo (?)\" made with 1.5 bourbon, 1 ancho chili liquor, 0.5 creme de cacao, 0.5 lemon, a dash of angostura bitters, with egg white, topped with bourbon barrel aged beer (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rye-san-francisco?select=12AM0e4ypK1M9g7KpOKVZA#12AM0e4ypK1M9g7KpOKVZA). And, staying true to its name, he asked for his drink as a question ahaha.\n\nI adored their rendition of the Pimm's Cup #5, which I would colloquially describe as a strongly gingerfied mojito with rum swapped out for whiskey. After some Wiki research, I learned that Pimm's Cup is a fruit cup, an English-specialty long drink comprised of a spirit base (#5 uses rye whiskey) and a soft drink (ginger syrup in this case). Despite it being labeled a starter rather than a cocktail (thanks for calling my palate a wimp, Rye), the drink harmoniously highlighted the duo of mint and ginger, the perfect partners-in-crime for masking the taste of alcohol. The bartender muddles...smashes some real ginger into the drink, and he sticks in a cucumber peel to seal the deal. Ooh I should request smashed cucumber in it next time. Mint + ginger + cucumber = EPIC TRIFECTA.\n\nMy friend said that the egg white in the Ancho First Rodeo (?) lends to the creamy froth of the drink, but not so much the flavor. The bourbon went down smoothly and paired well with the blend of light ancho chili and cacao creme, sprinkled with some dark cacao bits. I didn't really taste the lemon or ango, but perhaps the chocolate and cream dimensions outweighed the citrus. This was a drink that grew on me, mhmmm.\n\nMenu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rye-san-francisco?select=12AM0e4ypK1M9g7KpOKVZA#2nQxi8z9lnRTLxy9oPooeQ\nand\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rye-san-francisco?select=12AM0e4ypK1M9g7KpOKVZA#GZxIG2JgFp37d46UsKV2Fw\n\nRandom facts: They have a lone restroom in the back, next to the humongous chalkboard (omg we forgot to leave our marks! Too busy moving on to the next one...next time grr), which is also next to the pool table. The seating includes bar seats, some small tables in the side area and back, and chairs along the side wall. It can get cushy, but it never got crowded. Oh, and they have an open air porch in the front of the venue...which comes off more as a prison for smokers =__=\n\ntbh, I enjoyed Rye's drinks as much as I enjoyed the Alembic's, and I would give them 5 stars...but, y'know, I don't think 2 drinks is a large enough sample size. I need to have tried a representative variety of drinks so that I can appropriately evaluate this cocktail bar with statistical significance.

The exterior of the building gave it a very excessive feel with one big wooden door that opened and closed. The interior was dimly lit and people were everywhere. The cocktails were very exquisite and unusual mixes and you could tell that the company put a lot of time into coming up with which ingredients to mix. \n\nI tried two different drinks that I can't remember the names of off the top of my head, but an ingredient in one of my drinks was a liquor that was exclusively made in California. I liked both of the drinks I tried, but I felt that the glasses were very small for the price of the drink. Overall, my friends and I had a good time at Rye.

She told me it had no name; all I know is it contained gin, pomegranate and celery -- an ingredient I usually can't stand, but barely noticed in this drink because it was SO delicious.\n\nI also tried my sister's La Lambada with tequila and sweet peppers (wasn't too impressed) and the Basil Gimlet (no longer on the menu but they'll still make it for you), which was just the perfect summer drink -- sweet/sour and crisp, with a basil mint aftertaste. Mmmm.\n\nIt was a bit crowded inside around 7:30pm on a Thursday night and hard to find a place to stand, much less sit, but we eventually landed a roomy booth with an awesome cement table.\n\nRye is a great spot for dates and groups, if you can snag a seat!", "author": "Tiffany W."}

I can imagine it may get pretty packed on a weekend but I stopped by on a hump day and was pleasantly surprised.  I managed to get a space at the bar and while their shelf was stocked horizontally and not vertically, it actually sort of made the selection more intriguing because you never know what was behind the bottles in front.  \n\nOne thing that DID catch my eye was a shiny brand new bottle of St. George Single Malt.  I had previously only had one of their previous releases at Local Edition and the bartender let me know that they had just received their allocation of just 3 bottles so I had the honor of the first pour.  If you're into Whiskey and have not tried this ridiculously hard-to-find single malt made in the bay area, you can probably find it here.\n\nSecond on the list is the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection.  I did not run through the entire group but I did confirm that while they did not have George T. Stagg, they did have Thomas H.

Sorry to previous reviewer Adele and others who are scared of the TL - stop being pussies. The TL hasn't been sketch in 10 years. And I'm sure there are natives who are tougher and have been here longer than me that think its been benign for even longer than that. \n\nBeen going here sporadically since it opened. I've never ordered any of the listed menu drinks. I drink classics and just straight booze. Because I exercise proper drink ordering etiquette, my wait for a drink -even during busy times - is minimal. \n\nI find the music can be a bit too loud for me around the seated area towards the caged bottles.

Upon entering, the bartender was expecting us, so the flight was ready to go. The warm and inviting ambiance offered a cozy feel, a little swanky but rustic at the same time. \n\nAfter taking the 3 shots and learning about each one, she asked us to pick our favorite and she would create a cocktail with it. She asked us our taste preferences and went to work creating a customized drink on the spot. And damn, did they hit the spot! Seriously, one of the best cocktails I have ever sipped. I didn't want it to end. \n\nOur bartender was a sweetie and very knowledgable, personable and gave us a great background on each selection. The price was awesome since I went through Sosh and it was all taken care of (including 20% tip) though the app. I would never have discovered the place despite living in the neighborhood for a few years since I tend to stick to the same dive spot, and I am glad I did. I read, I think in a 7x7 article, that hanging out in their smoker's cage at Rye (which is quite beautiful) and watching the people walk by was listed as one of the top things to do in SF before you die. So I can knock that one off my bucket list, even though I didn't even know it was there :).

To get drunk because you are not doing 1 or 2. \n\nAnd like Cheers on TV, it's great to go to a place where everyone knows your name. \n\nI had never been to Rye, so possibly nobody knew my name, but since it was Yelp's SFCM Ruggy's place of choice for a farewell party before heading off to NYC, a lot of people knew my name.

It had that Vibe, where you have to squeeze by people and get your accidental grope, which may turn into eye contact, which may turn into conversation, only because it is right in front of you. And there were a lot of attractive people here, looking to get lucky with others. \n\nThe bar has some large art pieces on the walls, a small pool table in the rear, a downstairs lounge, and a caged outdoor smoking area off the lounge onto Geary street. \n\nIt is sort of the place where you go after work or after dinner, but before you go to the clubs or elsewhere in the city. It is a place removed from the FiDi, so no suits, but on the edge of the Theaters, Union Square shopping, and Tenderloin clubs. \n\nThe crowd is mostly Caucasian 30 somethings, with a sprinkle of SF's diversity.

I attempted to flag down the friendly bartender, but he also is having a conversation with a friend and was not paying attention to me flagging him down.

Just a few annoying things but I was a very happy camper at the end of the night! And my friends all had a great time too!\n\nMy PROS:\n1) No dress code and no cover!\n2) Awesome crowd - friendly, patient, non pissed off mix of patrons even though everyone and their brothers, sisters and cousins were crowding the bar!\n3) What others have been saying about the bartenders is true - friendly bunch and mixes great drinks!\n4) At least they have one little table with a few seats that doesn't require a bottle service reservation located near the pool table area. Thank goodness a couple of friends got there a little early and snagged it!\n5) Pool table!!!  No fees to use it! No fights over it either!  Good distraction.\n6) Clean bathrooms!\n7) There's an outdoor cage for smokers with a couple of small 2-person bar type tables.\n\nMy CONS:\n1) Dang it was packed when we arrived at about 10 on a Saturday night! Not a lot of places to sit so beware ladies who decide to wear stilletos into this venue!  I think the lounge area requires bottle service because two friends got booted out when they tried to sit. I didn't think they'd require a reservation for seating but I guess they do... oh well... (correction: bottle service is not usually required but the night I came I guess someone reserved all of the tables)\n2) so packed it could take anywhere from 10-20 minutes to get a drink at the bar\n3) They measure their drinks to the tee but guess what their drinks are pretty awesome (well at least the ones I ordered were!)\n4) Aww pretty good music but no dance floor? \n\nIt's more of a bar or club that's missing a dance floor than a lounge because you can't really have a normal convo without yelling at your companion.  However, I think with the exception of the few annoyances I was entirely happy with my experience here at this bar.  Too bad the actual lounging area may require bottle service Saturday nights though (correction: nope, bottle service usually not required but you are able to reserve all their tables if you wanted to).

My best friend and I wanted a good bar to hang out at in the city on a Saturday night that was walkable from the BART station and I did a little research. It's a couple blocks from Union Square and at night the area is a bit sketchy, but Rye is such a cool place that once you're inside, you'll forget about the homeless people outside. The ambiance is awesome...cool, dark, candle-lit and pretty. \n\nThe bartenders are really good at the mixology they do, and hopefully you perused through Yelp before going here because you won't find their signature drinks on the menu since they are just THAT well known for them! Get the Basil Gimlet FOR SURE. One of the best drinks I've ever had. Really. Ever. But it's also dangerous because it tastes so good that I can't taste the alcohol. It'll hit you before you know it. The Flash is also good, but we had ours without kiwi for the night because they ran out. I'd be curious how much better it would taste with the kiwi instead. Ours was just more cucumber-y. Which was still delicious. \n\nAsk them to make anything you want and I'm pretty sure they can do it. If you come early in the night, it's a great spot to chill and talk. We got there around 8:30 and left maybe an hour or so later so we probably avoided whatever crowds that might have come later at night and had a pretty good spot on a couch to talk as well as at the bar top counter. The space at the bar is very limited though, so I can imagine it would be hard to get your drinks later in the night. All in all, we had a chill experience and I'd come back.

He got another drink on the menu and that one didn't taste good either.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty disappointed at the limited variety of drinks that the bartenders could make.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-08-05", "description": "This place is kinda stupid. I took a friend there last night looking for something different than our neighborhood favorite, and was, at first, a little disgusted. Later, I was just humored by the ridiculousness of my experience. \n\nWe scored a couple of barstools--a stroke of luck on a Saturday night--and sat down. The bar-back cleared the empty glasses in front of us, but didn't bother to wipe the bar, so our hands, when we rested them there as people do, rested in the sticky residue of whatever the people before us had been drinking and spilling. Not what I want after paying $15 for an ounce-and-a-half of whiskey. If you're going to charge that much, you better pay your staff to do a very good job. \n\nWe ordered two Yamazakis, ice on the side. The bartender said something like, \"you have to be some of the most particular drinkers out there,\" which seemed a little weird because whiskey, relative to the haute-cocktail culture in SF, is pretty straightforward regarding the bartender: pour and serve. No frills. Then he mentioned something about his father and Scotch and cigars, and how he wouldn't drink unless he had a smoke and a place to sit. I guess my buddy and I triggered this bartender's daddy issues. (Look, pal. I'm sorry your dad was a particular asshole, but I just want you to pour my drink. If I think you're a good bartender and I want to trust you, maybe I'll tell you about my father, and I'll tip you for listening and pretending to give a shit. Until then, shut up and pour and don't tell me I'm \"particular\".) \n\nThe place looks great, all concrete and wood, brick and glass. I'm not a fan of the wall art, but that's just a preference. Also, they have gender-neutral restrooms. This is a telling detail. It's telling because no woman in her right mind would venture into a bar restroom that men are also allowed into. I think they have a ladies' room, too, but the question remains, 'why, for a place with classy decor, do they make gender-neutral restrooms?' Rye needs a men's room and a ladies' room. The men can spray the fucking ceiling with their piss-drunk piss, and the women can have a safe place to sit. Don't invite women to go into the men's room. It's not classy.\n\nAbove the bar at Rye, amongst all the back-lit bottles, is a glass tankard of kitschy rye tincture. It's flavored with citrus and spice and smells like Christmas. Stay away from it. It tastes like Triaminic. The bartender was nice enough to pour a round of shots on the house when I asked for a taste, and I appreciated that gesture. That's good bartending, and, along with the interior design, it earned the place a second star from me. But, the shit is shwag. You don't have to have a rye tincture if you're going to call your bar Rye. You do have to have a reasonable selection of Ryes, though, which I can only assume the place does. I don't think I'll be going back there to find out. If you're going to charge me $15 for a couple of ounces from a bottle that retails for $45, I expect to be drinking on a clean bar in a classy establishment.

More citrusy than cucumbery. If you haven't tried the Basil Gimlet or Flash, I'd recommend those. Oh, and 4 kamikaze shots is roundabout 28. First time trying it, and it's pretty tasty!

Solid drink, but I didn't want to hammer 6 of these home so when the bartender asked me what I was thinking for the next drink I explained to him about this vodka I had tried out a while back called Zubrowka. Sure enough Rye places one single bottle of vodka on it's shelf....and it's Zu. Win. I kicked back two Zu martini's and was feelin the flow....doin the bull.

There are some pool tables located in the back of the venue.  \n \nOf course, I ordered the Basil Gimlet: refreshing and sweet for about nine dollars. Generally, the bar is speakeasy themed with the usual lemon, orange, basil garnishes or the mixology usage of egg whites. There are plenty of tables for groups to sit and chat.

Appleseed: roughly speaking, bourbon, tequila, ginger beer, and bitters.\n- Birds of a Feather: tequila, orange oil (very fragrant), bitters, and vermouth.\n\nBoth AMAZING drinks! They are expensive, maybe a dollar or two higher than the ones at 15 Romolo, but when you're already paying more than $10 for a drink, another dollar is fairly inconsequential.\n\nOur bartender was also super nice (probably connected to the fact that it was a bit of a slow night), and after hearing that one of our friends didn't have a taste for gin, she came up with a delicious shooter involving gin, cucumber, and mint, to change her mind. And she brought not just one, but five, one for everyone in our party to try. It was nominally on the house, but of course we tipped her a fiver! :)\n\nBig plus for the place being really empty (good, more space for me), good patio (slight minus, it doubles as a smoking patio, but you can't have it all) and also holla to the nice, FREE pool table!\n\nI'm certain I'll be back at Rye soon.", "author": "Josh K."}

The bartender worked her magic and I ended up with a fruity drink that was way tastier than any cocktail I've had in the past.

In drinking establishments there should be one bathroom dedicated to the cleanlier sex. Two single stall bathrooms didn't seem sufficient for the amount of crowd that streamed in.\nTwo bartenders were working their tails off trying to keep up with orders and the complicated drinks. The server was also working extremely hard to get  all those drinks  distributed, but with the crowd that came in on Saturday night, you would think they would up their staff numbers.

As Wendy mentions, this place has super original cocktails with VERY interesting ingredients.  Chili? Egg whites? Maple syrup? Yes, you heard that right! \n\nI ordered the basil gimlet and the Added Bonus.  They were each $10 (a bit steep in my opinion).  The gimlet was actually not very basil-y, but very strong otherwise.  I'm not sure how it got on that 7X7 \"Must Eat Before You Die\" list; it's admittedly good, but certainly not \"last meal on earth\"-good.  I also ordered the Added Bonus solely based on the strangeness of the ingredients, which included basil, maple syrup, and egg whites.  It was a STRONG drink; I watched them take their time making it, and our bartender poured a ton of alcohol into it.  Thank you! \n\nI tried my friend's drinks too, the Bella (a special they had that night, with huckleberries) and the Sao Paolo Sin, which she ordered also because of one of its interesting ingredients: Thai chili!  SPICY.  Too much spice for me, but it was a good drink.  Very new and interesting. \n\nThe bartenders take their time with the drinks, maybe it's more appropriate to call them mixologists.  I noticed all the fresh fruits and other ingredients lying around, and it seems like they take making drinks pretty seriously.  I also liked the atmosphere here, very chill and at the same time, it's a pretty nice place.  \n\nSo, overall:\n+ Creative, good drinks with fresh, interesting ingredients\n- Somewhat steep pricing \n+ Chill atmosphere\n+ Good bartenders/mixologists\n\nOh, and the final awesome point: you have a great selection of post-drink food choices within walking distance, ranging from Osha Thai next door to Bang San Thai down the block to Shalimar down the street!

Even once the new-to-SF wore off, it was still cool. Good cocktails. Good dark vibe. And around the corner from some dirty-restaurant-but-yummy Indian food.\n\nI'd say this is a good 3rd date spot. It's a little too dark and loud for a first date. But once you're past the original get-to-know-you questions, this place will do nicely. There are lounge booths in one half, and a cool bar in the other. Even a pool table.\n\nI like their moscow mule (although it's called something else) - they'll take your ID as collateral for the bronze mug, so make sure you don't forget it. Not that I did. Ok I did. Don't judge me.\n\nTheir Pimm's cup is also dangerously tasty.\n\nGo for it, give it a try.", "author": "Shanee B."}

I ordered the daily special, which included tequila, strawberry, lime and jalepeno and the bartender made sure to check to see that I liked it. \n\nRye has a regular mixing contest as well, so if you think you can beat this place at its own game head down and show them what you've got. \n\nOn Wednesday night, the place was buzzing but not bumping, just the way I like it.

Two stars may be a bit generous.  \n\nThe location is not in the best or safest neighborhood, so ladies walking home alone from here please be careful.

I figured hey... why not. Kill two birds with one stone sort of thing.\n\nWe got there pretty early (the place still smelled like fresh cut limes and lemons) so we were able to grab two seats at the bar. They have a great selectiong of whiskey and even their own infusion. We decided to try some of their cocktails. Pretty darn tasty! We soon realized that having an open tab might become dangerous. But again... why not. We were even gutsy enought to try out their rock and rye whiskey- neat. \n\nAs the night and happy hour progressed, another coworker joined us. I was also able to spot the Yelp crew - yay!Met a couple of cool people and enjoyed the lounge area behind the bar. This place is pretty chill and even has a little patio/smoking area. It does get crowded quickly though. But everyone looks to be having a great time, except for the homeless person who strolled in for a moment. Maybe she knew that the bartenders make a tasty and mean cocktail too! As the night progressed there was a bouncer outside and you have to start defending seats.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-21", "description": "Living in the neighborhood, Rye is usually one of my favorite bars to hit up at any time of the week. Its usually never too crowded, the drinks are well made, and the ambiance is relaxing and cool. \nBut the only downside thus far has been an unbelievably mean and rude bartender who is usually there on friday and saturday nights. Most bartenders here will wait until they have completed someone else's order before asking for yours, this woman asks for multiple orders at a time. So after waiting about 20 mins to get her attention you will usually have to wait another 15-20 mins to your drink. On one occasion she yelled at a patron, who had not yet ordered from her but was standing in the vicinity, to not order from one of the other bartenders and to just wait for her. I found this pretty shocking and rude considering we were all still waiting to place an order. Since it didn't happen to me I simply ignored her sour puss attitude. \nOn my most recent visit to Rye the same bartender had taken my boyfriends order, questioned if he was making the right decision \"Are you sure? Its a white wine spritzer you know\", then taking 20 mins to even start making the drinks without even saying a simple, \"It will just be a minute\". After too many false alarms with the drinks we simply decided to cancel our order and leave. She shot us a look, and walked away without saying anything.\nLong story short. This is a great place, but I think I will try to order from somebody who doesn't let their indifference ruin people's night out.", "author": "Jessica G."}

It's comfortably lit in there for a bar, there are concrete floors, and generally a funkier vibe. Yet make no mistake, Rye's tenders mix a mean cocktail, and there's something for all palates. Well as long as your palate craves liquor. Let's face it, if you're there with me, why wouldn't it? You're just a weirdy, and I don't think we can be friendsy.\n\nSpeaking of weirdies, there was a drunken dude that was all up in everyone's bizness around the bar. He said he was a friend or relative of one of the bartenders, but it didn't excuse his too-friendly, no-regard-for-personal-space antics. He would just plop himself down at our table, reach over people for drinks... just really inappropriate, unwelcome behavior. At one point, he claimed he was a werewolf and was feeling crazy because the full moon was coming, and then he plucked the basil out of my friends' drink, took a bite, made a sneer, and spit out the rest... BACK INTO MY FRIEND'S DRINK. Not cool at all dude. If that had been my drink, I don't think I could've been as forgiving, but my friend just laughed it off.\n\nAside from that guy invading our space and making some of us uncomfortable, we had a great time at Rye. Our party kept growing as friends and friends of friends kept popping in, and the drinks kept flowing. Like I said, they have something for everyone, from a long list of specialty cocktails, to custom-ordered ones, to a decent beer selection (Hitachino Nest White Ale was the popular choice that night). I'm pretty sure this will be a staple of my visits to the city.", "author": "Mike Q."}

Rye's like that kid in school who was the first one to wear Windsor knots in their tie when everyone else's was skinny, the person in the office who knew all about True Blood before it crossed over to UK shores, the fashion-forward types who wear Buddy Holly glasses and quiff their hair, the student at uni who doesn't listen to a band unless fewer than four people have heard of them.\n\nYou want to acquaint yourself with their Pimm's Cup, especially if you're a British visitor. It's a fantastically interesting take on the usual lemonade, strawberries, orange, cucumber and mint combo we get over in Blighty and is very, very tasty. And if you're a fan of sharp, tangy cocktails like myself, the Basil Gimlet will be a treat for the senses. And at Rye, you get entertainment too. Those mixologists are darn good at their jobs, and watching the way they smash the fresh herbs before throwing them in the glasses is a joy.\n\nThey take their work very seriously too. A particularly good-looking female bartender was muddling lemons and said irritatedly to her colleague, \"These lemons suck!\" alluding to their freshness and the difficulty they had in yielding. A lesser worker wouldn't have mentioned it or even realised. As for the decor of the place, think bare brick, think industrial seating, think minimalism - think a blank canvas for a group of flamboyant, creative young individuals to descend upon and call their own. Marvellous! Also the free Chex Mix lining the bar in bowls is tops, and there are M&Ms and sweets to munch on too. All just there. Free to take. That's SF, baby.", "author": "Emma Louise M."}

I went to some 30 different bars during that week, but somehow, managed to become a \"regular\" at Rye.\n\nMy first night in town, Rye was stop numero uno. I was smitten. Nothing really stands out as special enough here to write home about, yet somehow, I found myself coming back night after night. Whether pulling up a chair at the bar and sipping on some carefully concocted cocktails, lounging on the couches debating world politics, or going nuts on the patio pretending to only speak Spanish (which I don't), every night here was unique and special and chocked full of hazy memories which I will cherish.\n\nThe bartenders have this attitude that is fantastic and unlike any I would find in my hometown for sure. No southern hospitality, just this sort of \"I'm-not-gonna-take-any-shit-from-you-get-your-hands-away-from-my-garnishes\" air about them that I found amusing and simply, cool.

The dimly lit bar is a nice touch. It's enough to let you see the face of the person you're talking to. Like it matters after a few drinks anyway.... hah. \n\nI recently tried out their Pimm's Cup and what was named... I kind of forgot what the name of it was because my vision was cloudy from having such a good time. Hah, but I vaguely remember the drink being called something along the lines of \"Scorned Wife\" or \"Scorned Lover\", either way the bitch was wrongfully scorned. But the outcome was totally delicious. These bartenders or, excuse me, mixologists have got their shit down to an art. If you're even the least bit unsure, these guys will treat you well and whip you up something that would probably suit your tastes.\n\nEven on a Saturday night the place still had enough space to walk around and chit chat with friends, hang around the pool table, and come back just in time for your specialty cocktail. The music isn't too loud and it's a great place to lounge, especially in the smoker's den. It's a great hangout and every time I hang out at Rye, I definitely have a good time. Just come in a bit earlier so you can have some prime seating at the bar. But even then they have a server ready to take drink orders to you, too. So no need to fiercely guard that prime corner booth you've been looking at and finally got. Just sit back, relax, and tell me what the correct name of the Scorned lady drink is.", "author": "Leslie K."}

We went on a Sunday night, so there were no crowds and we got to enjoy a quiet night of chatting and enjoying our drinks.\n\nThe Basil Gimlet and The Flash are two excellent drinks. The Basil Gimlet is a delicious mixture of gin, basil, lime juice, and agave nectar. Although it tastes sweet and can't taste much of the alcohol, it sure is there. I think I might like The Flash more, which had gin, kiwis, lemon juice, and cucumber. You can really taste the cucumber and the kiwi after you take a sip and it tastes very fresh. The Flash wasn't as strong as the Basil Gimlet. I loved both though because I really like gin.\n\nA big plus here was that they serve free snacks! One cup full of m&m's and peanut m&m's and another one full with party mix. Yum yum :) They were awesome.\n\nThe inside was really nice as well.

I ordered THE FLASH, even though many other yelp reviewers really recommend the basil gimlet.\n\nThe flash is a lovely concoction of gin, fresh ground kiwi, lemon, cucumber and some agave nectar. The sweetness of the agave nectar masked most of the taste of the alcohol, which I really liked because I'm not too big of a fan with gin. But, be careful! However sweet it is, I still get that slight Asian glow. \n\nThe party I came here with were a mix of people, some working and some who were still in school. I wouldn't recommend coming to Rye for cocktails if you're tight on cash and not willing to spend ~$10 per cocktail.", "author": "Julia K."}

If you don't pay attention you may just miss it! Their smoking patio is 'like being in a prison cage' as I like to describe it- but oh the more reason to love it! Great for people watching and a bit incognito ;)  \n\nLove the brick walls and casual yet modern interior, good music that isn't too loud and you can actually hear what your date/friends are actually saying. The drinks are well made and strong, unlike other places that pack on the ice and call it a drink. The crowd here is contemporary, hip, and chic- every time I go I see beautiful people ;) But without all the pretentious snobbery you see in other blazer adorned lounges. \n\nNot the place to go if you're looking to go crazy dancing, but definitely a place to get your drink on with friends and start the night.

It's really hard being here on a Friday or Saturday evening when the crowd around the bar is over 3 people thick and everyone's packed like sardines against each other. But on the more lax evenings it's a great place to park myself on a stool and ask their friendly and expert bartenders to whip me up something on the fly. \n\nThey also have great community events. Recently, thanks to a tequila sponsor, they had invited many well known bartenders from across the city to compete on making the best mixed drink. Everyone was of good cheer as competitors egged each other on, stole equipment from each other, chatted up their neighbors and snuck sips from their rivals. Their creativity was amazing, as their concoctions held everything from hand-mashed watermelon, cinnamon, chili, fizzy baby tomatoes, mint, and the like. As a customer who happened to pick the right night to stop by, we got to sample all these amazing drinks and vote on our favorite. \n\nIn fact, I had SUCH a good time sampling oh so many drinks, I wobbled home and promptly passed out for the night, completely forgetting to close out my card from the beer I had pre-event.  \n\nThey still have my card (it's probably assumed reported lost and cut up by now).

This must be what it feels like when the honeymoon ends, and your partner stops treating you like you're special.  I was just a little bit crushed... but I paid up, took my drink, held my chin up, and weaved my way back to my colleagues to drown my sorrows in rye whiskey.\n\nAnd drown them I did.  Flaming orange peel or not, this drink was still expertly crafted, ridiculously strong, and by the time I found the bottom of my glass, I forgot all about my earlier disappointment.\n\nRye, I still adore you.

Just a nice easy-going guy, too, which is refreshing to find in someone who has enough skill to probably  get away with acting like a douchebag if he wanted to.\n\nWhen it's busy it's tough to find a seat and the table service is understandably a little spotty.

Our waitress, though, was a doll and I'm sorry to see that it looks like the staff doesn't always get treated well by the clientele.  Seriously, people -- one dollar on two drinks is not a good tip considering it took two people to make them and bring them to you.  When it's really busy, I'd avoid asking for anything labor intensive and that isn't on the menu.

At the very least some rye whiskey?  call me crazy.  but consider yourself informed. \n\nI think \"Rye\" is maybe for their wry sense of humor.  \n\nWhat you get is your standard tendernob/loinhill bar - slash - lounge. with your usual vodkas, gins, and a couple whiskeys only. stark chic with no substance.  dark sleek walls, concrete floors, sticky tables, you know the drill.  The 'signature' cocktails list seemed a bit confused, not only were they seriously missing the firewater but no booze list. well i guess they don't really need one since there's nothing notable on the shelves to refer to.   My gimlet tasted strange.  and so did the other two even less memorable cocktails i had.  their bottled stella tasted like bottled stella. \n\nThe iron cage out front makes this place stand out from swig and the others down the street.  nice touch.  except that it adds to their whole creating the false illusion that you will find caged barrels overflowing with bourbon inside.  sigh.  and sitting in the patio inside the cage does make one feel like an animal, and not in a good way, but more like a creature held captive at a zoo exhibit.  also, if you can suffer the smoke long enough to sit out there, expect to get panhandled on, which is another mind-jarring experience.  me behind bars and the downtrodden strolling free back and forth and hitting me up for cash. \n\nand on this particular night, someone had their giant cream colored lab crossed with a st. bernard looking dog with them.  it was certainly grand to look at. and i wanted to pet it too like everybody else.  but i am allergic and so i tried to stay away.  but those were some tight quarters in there.  and the hives that that furry creature caused me all over my face and neck, arms and legs really helped keep that good feeling all night.  (think what's his face in that last scene in there's something about mary.) if it wasn't the hives, it was moving across the street to swig that really did the night in.  did YOU know that the tendernob turns into a suburbia-in-the-city-gala event on the weekends?? seriously, prom dresses and all.", "author": "Nikki F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-02-26", "description": "This could possibly be the hardest five stars a bar has ever earned, because man-oh-man, was this just not my normal cup of tea.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner at Canteen, we decided to head over to Rye because, well, it's named Rye. Let me explain. If you're from the East Coast, especially the New York/New England/Pennsylvania area, you probably have some ancestral memory lodged deep in your mind about the virtues of rye whiskey. For those of us from the Northeast, Rye is our historical tipple of choice. Unfortunately, as a result of many years of marketing from the bourbon and vodka vendors, this perfect grain distillate had faded out of vogue.\r\n\r\nBut there is hope - in the late 1990s, Anchor Distillery launched a single malt rye whiskey - and since then a number of great rye whiskeys have come back onto the scene. So with this in mind, when I heard about Rye, I decided to make a trip out there.\r\n\r\nThe bar is beautiful, more East Coast than West - Scandinavian designed with wood accents everywhere. Down to every detail, the place screams \"The Bubble Is Back! Long Live The Internet Bubble!\"\r\n\r\nBut just on the promise that they may have rye, we went in.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was, well, horrible. Yuppie trash that decided to go out slumming in the Tendernob. Screeching bleached blonds and boisterous jock assholes vying for attention and hoping to get laid.\r\n\r\nBut they had rye, and we could get two seats at the corner of the bar near the door in case we needed to make a quick getaway.\r\n\r\nIt was at that point that I recalled what I thought about Paris: a beautiful city, if you could just get rid of the damned Parisians. Same thing goes for Rye.\r\n\r\nOur bartender, Jennifer, was the saving grace of the night. In between churning out 7&7s, Rum and (Diet) Cokes, 7 and Waters, Gin and Tonics, Stoli Vanillas and Ginger Ale and other drinks better suited for frat parties than a sophisticated bar like this, she served up some of the most amazing Manhattans (Jim Beam Rye, Noilly Prat Sweet (Red) Vermouth, Peychoud Bitters and a single sour cherry) - possibly the best I have ever had. She admitted that she had a soft spot for that cocktail, and she treated it with the respect that it deserved.\r\n\r\nWe went in planning on having one, or at the most two drinks total, as we didn't hit the ATM before heading in (yes, they are cash only for now). By the time we left, we had each had four - because I don't think either we or the bartenders wanted the night to end.\r\n\r\nAs we left, we mentioned to Jennifer that she was the saving grace for the bar because she made the crowd there \"tolerable\".\r\n\r\nSo, here is the breakdown:\r\n\r\nThe bar - The atmosphere, architecture and sense of style is great, and the inclusion of both an outside cage (where we saw a blond chickie climbing up and comically (to us) trying to sexily writhe for her man) for smokers and a pool table warrants a definite 5 out of 5. Hopefully next time we'll see someone smack into the wall-length mirror thinking there is another bar on the other side of the wall.\r\n\r\nThe bartenders - Everyone we had there was amazing, not only making great Manhattans, but muddling a pair of perfect Basil Gimlets (vodka) and a house drink called a Gold Rye Fizz - a rye drink with mandarin oranges, rye, bitters and a splash of cream as a substitute for the missing Advocaat/Eierlikor/Egg Liquor. Jennifer gets extra points for gracefully dropping a whole lemon in a martini glass full of Absolut Citron - the perfect \"lemon drop\" in my book. 5 out of 5\r\n\r\nThe selection - 5 out of 5 - this is a hard one. The beer was well selected, but I still winced when seeing someone order a can of Tecate (the crowd was mostly drinking Stella, but a good number of Chimays came out of the fridge). A number of good whiskeys were available with the well rye being Jim Beam Rye (yellow bottle). Some bimbettes wanted Crown Royal, which they were out of, or didn't carry... which thoroughly distressed them but amused us.\r\n\r\nThe crowd - 1 out of 5, and if I could give lower scores, I would. Loud, annoying, drunk and the sort of people that makes me reconsider ever going back there, even though I loved the place. Once this crowd finds the \"next greatest thing\" I am sure it will be a much more tolerable group of folks frequenting the bar.", "author": "Avery G."}

Most bars attempting to do it are a sad knock off of New York or LA.  But Rye does it well.\n\nI love the exposed brick, thoughtful interiors, great selection of drinks, and overall look of this place.  The music isn't way too loud and its a great place to meet up with friends where you can actually talk and have a great drink.  Their cocktail choices are interesting and STRONG!  This bar is two blocks from my house and I often suggest it for meeting up and catching up with friends and people visiting from out of town.\n\nThe one very minor complaint I have is that their bar staff are SLOW.  There could be two of you and you'll wait 10 minutes for a drink.  If it's busy, grab some popcorn!  That said, they totally know what they're doing and many of their drinks are complicated.  Once I get the drink I usually forgive them, but my one suggestion would be that their bar staff step it up a bit.\n\nThe drinks are also expensive, but not ridiculous.  They are worth it, but I couldn't afford to come here frequently.\n\nIf you have friends coming in from out of town and want a cute, non-pretentious, but very sophisticated cocktail experience then I would definitely suggest Rye.", "author": "Daniel H."}

Last week, during one of my many trips to SF from LA, I finally got to experience Rye, and lemme tell you boys and girls, it did NOT disappoint. This, in fact, is the epitome of MY kind of bar; rad art on the walls, low key vibe, great bartenders who are experts in their craft (yes, muddling & mixing the perfect drink, is a craft to me), minimal amount of clutter so there is plenty of standing and sitting room. We were here on a Tuesday night, and it was late, so it wasn't packed but it certainly wasn't empty. I imagine this place does get packed, especially on the weekends and during happy hour. There is an outdoor smoking area (bonus) and clean bathrooms (double bonus). \n\nFunny enough, the day after I visited Rye, I attended a happy hour event put on at the Farmer's Market in SF, to celebrate Cocktail Week and the peeps from Rye just so happened to be there.

Seeing as though it was another gin drink i was a little hesitant, but he insisted that it would change our lives.  A perfect mix of sweet and sour, cucumber, kiwi, gin and probably a bit of magic had me convinced at the first sip. Life changing.  Not that often one can say that about a drink, but it was true.

My worst pet peeve are slow bartenders who don't work with any sense of urgency, especially when its busy.

Nice that it's right next door to Osha Thai.

But we stopped in for happy hour yesterday ($2-off drinks) and it was quite nice. Dark and completely empty inside, and it was a beautiful day so we sat outside in the little caged in patio overlooking Geary. I cannot stress enough how very sweet the bartender was--just such a nice and funny guy. Such baretenders make life worth drinking. The beverages were top notch too. I had the Honey Melon (or something...it had honeydew in it)--very light and refreshing with mint; one friend had the Thai me up (??)--spicy drink with basil; and another the Apple Bomb (??), with apple brandy. The last one was very strong and would be awesome on a cold night.", "author": "Jasmine F."}

They keep a nice selection of things like mint, peach and blackberry on hand.  It makes for a great Mojito, or something akin to an infused vodka, without having to wait all that time while the ingredients marinate.

Rye blows it out fo the water!\n\nFirst, you don't have to wait in an enormous line to get into Rye and the doorman is friendly and professional - it's as if he's an entirely other species of doorman from the Ambassador/Los Angeles variety. No attitude at all, very chill, and no cover on Saturday. Five stars. \n\nThe music is energetic enough to support the social buzz without being so loud or having such a drivingly fast beat that you can't hold a conversation. The pool table is also a nice addition to the atmosphere. Four stars.\n\nThe crowd was a good mix of men and women, with the ratio hovering at about one to one all night. The atmosphere was friendly and social, with small groups and singles mingling freely. Four stars as there was a (quite small) contingent of the North Beach striped-shirt brigade. \n\nThe staff... This is where Rye really ascends into the nightliofe pantheon - the bartender, Jenn, is absolutely the best in San Francisco - PERIOD. This woman successfully knocked Voda off the \"best martini in SF throne\" with a dirty hendrick's martini that was besically an orgasm in a glass. Add in the \"most well-made mojito I've ever had\" according to the D, and you're ready to start your night properly. The very cool waitstaff were cracking jokes and having a good time with us without letting it affect their efficiency a bit, and we ended the night throwing back shots at the bar and laughing it up lioke old friends. Combine that with the doorman experience, and you have 5 stars... I wish I could give 6!\n\nOverall, I found Rye to be a fantastic place to go with a small group of friends for great drinks and atmosphere in a place where you can actually get a spot to sit (no packed like sardines in this bar!). I would also suggest it as a place to go for a few drinks with a date after dinner - great drinks, places to sit and chat, not too loud, fun, relaxed atmosphere. It isn't really a pick-up joint, though, from my experience, but that may vary with the night.\n\n\nEDIT: The absolute rock star of a doorman referenced above is named Quenton - give the man some love, as he keeps cool, calm and very personable despite having a job that can often be thankless.", "author": "Mani F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-26", "description": "If it were not for their restrooms, this place would have been given zero stars. I have never experienced such rude customer service before. DO NOT be deceived by the ambiance of the place, because the bar manager can turn that ambiance into something undesirable. \n\nI think the one star might come from the fact that there are no lines for the restrooms, but other than that, I do not see why it would have such good ratings for a place with such service. The bartender was nice, he did his job, but the bar manager seems to not understand what it means to be a decent human being. He can argue that it was done with good intention, which I do have to agree, but there is a limit to how someone treats people, especially customers. \n\nI came to this bar with a group of friends for a friend's 21st birthday. Without a doubt, the birthday girl is a bit more intoxicated than the rest of us, she got emotional. The bar manager came up to us without asking about anything whatsoever and simply just assumed the situation, told us that we could not place a drink in front of her, because she is beyond her limits. Who is he to tell us that she is beyond her limits, I am pretty sure we know our friend a bit more than he knows her. First, of all, we would not want our friend to be in danger, that would say something about us as friends, and second of all, she knows her limits, because she gets acid reflux when she drinks beyond her limits. So, therefore she will not pass out, in case the bar manager did not know, there is a difference between someone being emotional because they are talking, versus crying due to an over-consumption of alcohol. I did not expect him to understand, so we just took that warning, and we just sat there for a bit, but felt obligated to get another drink since we were taking space at the bar, so another friend went and ordered a shot, but was denied the shot. What type of bar is this?\n\nNot only was she denied the drink, but the bar manager came up to us, and asked us to leave. The sad part was that we did not even attempt to retaliate, we were ready to leave, we (making sure that the birthday girl did not drink it, because that was the concern to the bar manager) just wanted to down the drinks that we have already ordered and paid for, as I was drinking the cocktail, the bar manager just snatched it away from me and said that we had to leave. There is something wrong with this picture, isn't is a violation to consumers' rights? Who does he think he is, or who does he think I am? I am pretty sure I am not 5 years old, since I am at a bar, and even if I were, he does not have the right to do what he did. \n\nALSO, they did not check IDs, if any of us were not of age, they would have not done their job properly. SO before you go around trying to evaluate people's alcohol consumption, maybe try checking IDs, that would be a good start. \n\nLong story short, there is a reason why they had slow business, while The Ambassador across the street had lines.", "author": "Pandasha Y."}

Basically, this girl tried to sneak in the door when someone was leaving and the kick-ass bouncer grabbed her and told her (and 3 of her friends that tried to join her) that they couldn't get in.  He even shouted to the other bouncers and those 4 people were flagged for the rest of the night.  Pure awesome.\n\nCame here on a saturday night after we couldn't get into Ambassador due to multiple birthday parties (ie. line too long), even after above birthday girl was kicked out of line.\n\nThe line at Rye wasn't all that long, and the bouncer, I believe his name was Quentin, (and his friend) were really friendly.  One of the friends of the aforementioned birthday girl apparently had been at Rye before so got in immediately, but the awesome Quentin told her dudeguy friend that he had to wait in line like every one else, cuz Quentin remembered the girl but knew that dudeguy friend was trying to fool him.  Uh-uh, Quentin's not gonna take that crap.  I was not-so-secretly smiling, mostly because I was next in line and freezing (even with a coat on!)\n\nAnyway, once inside, the place was nice, though crowded near the bar.  We sat down (yeah, there was actually space) in the lower level but it was freakin' cold cuz the door to the outdoor smoking area kept opening.  Naturally, we left after getting tasty drinks that were not very expensive at all ($6 for soco w/ lime) so I was happy. Maybe too happy...\n\nBut no dancing, so we left for Le Colonial later on.\n\nStill, the bouncer dude was cool.

It's a small, inconspicuous spot and easy to miss if you're not paying attention. First thing I noticed on the way in was a homeless man bugging the patrons hanging out on the smoking patio for money. Ah, the night scene in SF...\n\nInside: For a Saturday night, it wasn't too crowded. My group of seven people managed to snag a table after about 30 minutes of standing around. I hardly noticed the wait though, since it took me about that long to get the bartender's attention anyway.\n\nDrinks: Specialty drinks run about $9-$10, but I have to admit they are quite good. Recommend the basil gimlet and the blood and sand cocktail.\n\nThe bartender: I was tended to by a guy bartender, who I have to call an elitist. He refused to make my friend a long island, and responded with some kind of comment about how he doesn't make \"those kind of drinks.\" Ooookay. Sure he mixes up a mean-ass vodka tonic (glass of vodka with a splash of tonic), but seriously, don't be a prick. Given the cocktail menu, you wouldn't think a long island would be an issue.  It's not like we asked for a round of daquiris.\n\nThe venue: The bar gets quite crowded, so good luck getting in there to order your drinks. You're better off grabbing the cocktail waitress and having her bring them to you. The music is loud, but not to the point where you can't have a conversation with the people sitting next to you.\n\nFinal verdict: 3 stars for tasty drinks, but relatively bad service.

I was unfortunate to be standing near a high traffic area with lots of congestion that I shoulder bumped more people than a defensive lineman does in a game.

I didn't venture around the place, but it was quite quaint with it being a smaller venue for a lounge.  Oddly enough, I didn't buy any drinks that night, so I can't tell you how much the drinks were, but I think I heard from a friend that it was around $7 per drink (typical).  They also have an outdoor standing area right around the front, which is nice for those who want to get some fresh SF air for a change.  I wasn't paying attention to the music much, but it wasn't really a lot of music that I'm attuned to, but the good thing about it was that it wasn't so loud that I couldn't hear what people were saying to me when I'm standing next to them.\n\nIn terms of lounges go, this place is a cool place to chill at especially if you don't want to pay a cover to go drinking with the buddies.  I think Saturdays was a bit too busy, but I can imagine going here on random days and getting yourselves a booth and chat / drink your night away.

Long story short, there was constructive interference and I got a drink that was way unbalanced on the sweet side. Props to the bartender for keeping it drinkable; in other circumstances I think it could have gone pretty badly.\n\nThe basil gimlet is amazing. Can I call it a revelation without sounding like a snooty choad? The basil is completely on target for this drink.\n\nWell, you get the point. I'm repeating what everyone else is saying.

The whole password and reservations thing with Bourbon & Branch is just too fussy and I am so not a fan of the Ambassador.\n\nRye's brick and brown hues are quite warm and inviting.  The place can surely get crowded but not claustrophobic.  There are little spots you and your friends can nestle in to catch up or people watch.\n\nMost importantly, Rye is the reason I switched from mojitos to basil gimlets.  Yum!  I like them made with SF's No. 209 gin, but had the chance to try it with Damrak gin recently.  Rye hosted a mixology event for Damrak and Yelp's very own Nish was a judge.  Damrak gin drinks were on the house so I tried the basil gimlet as well as the cucumber gimlet.  My basil gimlet was a bit too limey this time but the cucumber gimlet hit the spot.\n\nAnd to follow up on Joe B.'s comment about the top-notch bartendress, she actually placed in the top 3 out of 12 and gets to go to Amsterdam to compete!

Gross. \n\nHowever Rye still gets 4 stars for everything it does right. The basil gimlet was one of the best drinks I've ever had. Not too sweet, not too strong, just right. It was like a mojito with basil instead of mint. My friend's kumquat drink was equally delicious.\n\nI also really liked the energy in the bar. I prefer places where there actually are places to sit and that don't pack people in like sardines. There were plenty of people there, but not so crowded that we couldn't move.

We've been cocktail hunting for a while now: we've done Bourbon and Branch, Richouse, Absinthe, swig etc. but I think this is, so far, our favorite.  We felt right at home the minute we walked in: no reservations, no secret code, no bouncer, no crowds of yuppies drinking beer and being hip, just casual people from the neighborhood (maybe?) having a good time (and smoking a bit of pot . . .).  Rye is a nice size with two rooms, the front bar room and a back room with several sofa like seating areas and tables and an outdoor patio which is kind of sort of indoors.  The bartenders know their drinks but they are not pretentious at all.  We tried four cocktails that evening: the special which had creme de violette, mint and gin (I think), the dogpatch, a rye drink with averna, prat rouge and bitters; Birds of a feather, a bourbon/tequila mix with antica and maraschino; and Joie de Loire with Cachaca, orange liqeur and absinthe. All four were well-balanced, flavorful and we'd have them again.\n It was a Friday night and apparantly there is a happy hour until 7:30 with $8 drinks. Right before we were ready to leave, table service started. The waitress was delightful. She seemed to really like working at the bar and was very friendly and talkative. We wanted to stay just to enjoy her prescence.  She explained that in the future we could bring our dinner in if we wanted to. And that's what we plan to do next.\nA word on the atmosphere. It's not a super busy place (or at least not between 6-8 on a Friday), but it's steady and the crowd is an eclectic mix of people in jeans and sweaters and even some sweat pants and another guy in a suit.

Have not been to too many spots in The City (I'm living in Chicago), but this was the most Chi-like of the places I have been. Came here with college friends that I randomly came across in the Elephant & Castle/Club Quarters bar.\n\nThe cocktail menu looked great, the crowd was good (not so hip that it hurt) if not that diverse, and the price on the canned Tecate was phenomenal. Perfect for the low-budget evening we were having, seeing as it was the end of the month, and just after Christmas shopping. Great design in this place and excellent barkeeps. The loungy area is separated from the bar area... another nice touch.\n\nHighly recommended.", "author": "Clay J."}

This Place Can Be Douchey.  and the bros asking super-qualified bartenders for lemondrops and jagerbombs are wasting their time and money. (seriously guys, if you're going to order drinks named after sex acts and invented by college students, go to The Bus Stop).  i'm a pretty big fan that a place with such great cocktails will also throw some gangster rap my way (not found at say, bourbon and branch or beretta), but sometimes it prevents conversation.  my sympathy for the bartenders, but maybe if they turned the music down and refused to make lemondrops, the crowed would chill out.  but this rye deserves no more than two stars.  there is a special circle in hell for people who waste good liquor, and this place is an abomination. \n\nbut then i went to rye last night, the rainy sunday night before MLK's day.  the place was perfect.  the bartenders know what the hell they are doing and are really happy to talk about their cocktails and the creative stuff they want to do.  the cocktails here are every bit as good as beretta and more creative than bourbon and branch. some of the best drinks in a city of good drinks.  \nand the crowd was great.  it's a lounge and people were acting like it was a lounge, and by that i do not mean they were wearing sunglasses and taking bottle service.  it's what is should be: a place where people talk to other people.  \none bartender, whose name i forget, joined me in spraying soda water across the bar, made a damn good seasonal blood-orange whisky sour etc.  they are infusing whiskeys and getting really creative with seasonal fruits and infusions.  this place is awesome.  i didn't tip the bartender enough, as i left in something of a hurry, but i really want to come back to this bar... not the doucemonkey lounge.  five stars for this one.\n\nand as i believe we should evaluate these places at their best, and because the average doesn't mean anything, i'm going with the five.", "author": "Walter L."}

I was a mother fucking Genghis Khan of pretentious drinking establishments. Rawr. Entering Rye with a defiant (and very inebriated stare) I'm pleasantly surprised.

Can't your friend speak for himself?\nGuy: I apologize, this is my friend Erastus, he is from Greece. I am James, his interpreter. \nOh my fuck, that shit is hot. Drinks basil gimlet handed to me. \nPanties.

At that point I can't keep them straight, everything blends into each other like limbs at an orgy. \nUmmm..... somewhere in the night, things started going down.....\n\nAnd I think I'm married\n\nThe funny thing is that I don't know if I'm Mrs. James D_____\nOr Mrs. Erastus Snufflafagus\n\nEh.

That's how f'in on it I am, hit a hot spot more than 30 years before all other Yelpers.\n\nUm.  Right.  Rye has been open less than a year, Lainie, why you frontin'?  \n\n'cause Rye is where my dad's bar used to be.  Way, way back in the day that space was called The Rebound (has there ever been a better name for a bar?) and my daddy ruled the roost there.  He was the man.  Mostly I just remember the long bar and my dad setting it up with me stowed behind the bar after being told emphatically to stay out of sight. . .I sat there for hours ganking marachino cherries out of the jar that was big enough to stick my whole head into (I know this 'cause I tried this).  Sometimes, after the beat cop had his daily shot and left, my dad would let me run around the bar and play pool or give me money for the juke box.  At home he was daddy or Bill or honey but here he was Willie and everyone knew him and everyone loved him.  My dad had a soft spot for folks that were down and out and there would be a line at the door at 6am when he came to open up because these guys knew dad was a softy and he'd hook them up with a shot on the house to steady their hands and nerves.   When my dad died, it was SRO and a lot of people there were the same ones I saw in front of The Rebound when we would drop him off in the morning.  I was young when my dad passed away and a lot of my memories are of him in that bar.   \n\nSo cut to present day.  I had seen the spectacle that was Rye and had no interest in joining the fray - not my scene but I wanted to check out the place so I went at an off hour when I knew it would be empty.  Wow.  Total deja vu. .. it's completely different but somehow the same.  I sat at the bar and ordered a Jack Daniels, neat, raised the glass, toasted my pop and took the shot.  A wee tear escaped my eye so I threw a twenty down and walked out into the sunshine of Geary Street.

Gorgeous bar, bi-level and with an \"outdoor\" space that is out front but separated by a bars from the public, kind of like an advertisement for the good times within.  Easy bar to get around in, even when crowded.  Someone did their homework when setting up this space.\n\nOn to the drinks - I knew it was gin drinks for the evening, but had no idea they would be FREE during the event - hot damn!  Me and Snoop sippin' on gin and juice, laaaid back!  Or, as Mojo Nixon would have put it, we were in a gin guzzlin' frenzy.  I ended up having a gin and tonic to really get a taste for Damrak before I moved on to more complicated drinks, and it's very good, very smooth gin.  Jessica had the gin martini, which was good, but I wasn't in a martini mode at that point.  Then I went for a gin and sin, but the wait at the bar was so long (very busy at that point) that I settled for another cucumber gimlet that she was making and Jess had the basil gimlet.  Both were outstanding.  Then we more or less gave up on getting to the bar until I started up a conversation Carol Ann, a promoter making her way around the place, when she mentioned Yelp and Nish.  She was smart, fun, and we had a great discussion about Yelp and the effects of its' reviews which were pretty positive.  Anyway, long story short, that sweet lady got us gin-gin mules like, pronto.  What a sweetheart, and what a tasty drink!  5 stars for the event, Damrak, Nish for inviting us, and Carol Ann!!\n\nLast note: the female bartender (didn't get her name, no time) there is top notch and deserves whatever tips you can manage.

But I was pleasantly surprised that the line moved pretty fast and it wasn't too packed inside (I hate when bars fill the place so that you can't move).  I had a dirty martini and my boyfriend got an old fashioned, both were awesome. \n\nI went again last weekend on a Saturday night around 10 pm.  The place only had a handful of people in it and we were able to enjoy cocktails and play pool in the back.  I had a mint julep - so yummy!  Watching the bartenders make drinks is very cool.

Tom, the original Tom Green, was talking about what a great married living situation it would be for him right there on the street, in a cage.  \n\n     he said, \"yeah.. I could live out here and she could live in there.\" \n\n     we laughed, all knowing that it may actually be a great spot for him, this cage. \n\n     he said, \"I'll shit over there in the corner and just spray it off with a hose.\" \n\n     Eric asked, \"what would you use to hose it off, Tom?\" \n\n     Tom replied, \"hell, I'll shit over there in that corner!\" \n\n     Eric interrupted Tom's scowled expression as Tom sat hunched over and pointing with an index finger at the corner and said, \"you could fling your shit, Tom.  you could fling it across the street\" and again, we all laughed.\n\n     Tom continued, \"yeah, hell man, you could put a tire swing out here\" and as he was saying this, looking up languorously, an effortless vision arose in all of us featuring Tom swaying back and forth hanging onto a braided rope, hanging on with one hand, his feet resting atop a beat up BF Goodrich knobby tread tire.  we were envisioning him swinging around like a great ape, flinging shit out onto Geary street.  \n\n     Eric was smoking a cigarette and I was watching Tom sway back and forth with a dark and stormy in my hand.  I had on a hoodie.  it was one of those nights when everyone recognizes you and says things like, \"so, you're Ben's Dad!  I know Ben from when his company was sued by some other big company, something about trade secrets.\"  it was one of those nights when the bartender kisses you right on the mouth and mountains move and the particles creating blank space try to hold strong together, swimming around the room. \n\n     I guess it was about 1:30 when we managed to leave the bar.  I walked courageously, laughingly stumbling all the while, out into oncoming traffic to summon a cab.  we got into the cab and while being attacked by the rubber lining of the door I said, \"hey man, your car is falling apart\".  Tom leaned over childishly and whispered, \"ma'am - not man\".  \n\n     I looked up and I saw one eyeball, her right eyeball, and a pair of cherry red lips glancing back at me with indifference from the rear-view mirror.  I named the cross-streets and she drove off.  we went an interesting and new direction, one that I may have refuted at 1:30 PM with a clear head but at that moment, we did not give a fuck.  we laughed at nothing (nothing, being things like direction or red lights or a man with a boom box and a headband strolling up McAllister).  \n\n     it didn't matter to us. we were on the cusp of this night.  we were riding it the way we've always known to ride it, not forgetting where we came from.  that is exactly the thing that got us here.  that got us out here to California, and it was never an easy ride.  leaving is never easy.  poking your head through some doorway, looking to both sides before entering not knowing if something is coming at you or not is never easy.  but there we were, exiting the cab toward the curb so we didn't get run over in the middle of the street.  the crazies were out.  we were them.  we were tough and knew it, and therefore did not go looking for it.  we were hungry but not tired.  we were full of what it is to be jazz.  we were proud, and we were back. there is no changing that.  not tonight or any other night.  we were swept away by a blood lust haze of fog gathered in the street lights of the lower haight.  \n\n     and so we were granted entrance into the night, the true night as it were, by that little brick encrusted bar at geary and leavenworth.  without the spiral, there wouldn't be a ride and soon, without fail, I will be right there at the gate of that steal lined wooden door to get my ticket from a man named Q wearing a stocking cap and a smile.

Basil Gimlet is where its at!  Well...I have had better at the Alembic ;) but this one was pretty darn tasty.  I ended up ordering the special of the week next, which was some kind of habanero/tequila concoction....good, but not nearly as spice licking as I wanted it to be....I have had habanero infused drinks before and they have left my lips tingling as they should!\nAll in all....Rye....you are a decent bedfellow, while the serious bf is away, but other than that....its a no go.", "author": "Sheila Y."}

The bar itself is very cool- lovely leather booths with flickering candles, bird cage-esque smoking area, nice wine display. My only complaint is that they don't take credit cards and the closest ATM is in a liquor store across the street. When the drinks cost $8 a pop, taking credit cards or having an ATM inside is necessary. UPDATE- Credit card machine is going in ASAP so good for my blackberry loving self, bad for my liver.", "author": "Noelle Q."}

Then entrance is terrifically understatedly swank - just a solid sheet of wood that slides off to the side of the door, with 'rye' in subtle metal lettering on its surface.  There's also a reasonably sized \"smoker's cage\" that's separated from the bar by a big glass wall and door, and quite literally caged off from the sidewalk, but it's under cover so those who need to light up won't get rained on.  Nice touch.\nDrinks are fantastic and truly expertly made.  The sazerac is utterly delicious - but don't let them serve it on the rocks; the ice cuts the pleasant rich sweetness and leaves it tasting bitter.  Straight up, it's whiskey paradise in a glass.  And while the drinks aren't exactly cheap, they're also not as supremely overpriced as those across the street at the Ambassador.\nHighly recommended.", "author": "Don H."}

Well, heads-up foodies, this is your bar.\r\n\r\n10 years ago, bars that served mojitos with fresh, muddled mint were rare delights. It can be had almost everywhere now.\r\n\r\nWell, Rye has one-upped everyone with a mise en place that probably confuses their supplier.\r\n\r\nMy first friend had a recipe that included muddled strawberries, rosemary simple syrup and egg whites. It was served to him, giggling, in a champagne flute. He was almost annoyed at first, until he tried it. He finished it fast, but not because he was embarrassed.\r\n\r\nI had a \"Thai me up\" with thai basil and peach puree. It was less tasty, but no less interesting - I ate too much of the chile pepper that was supplied as a garnish.\r\n\r\nI had another buddy order his standard, a \"plain-ole\" manhattan which he quickly declared one of the best he'd had.\r\n\r\nThe staff is amazingly friendly. With the wealth of knowledge they so easily display, it would be such an easy misstep into snobbery. No way. They'll explain each and every drink they make, but If you just want some whiskey on the rocks, it's served with a smile.\r\n\r\nI asked a different barkeep if the dark syrup he was using was made with turbinado sugar and he quietly spoke to me at length about how he liked the flavor but he found it muddied some other drinks.\r\n\r\nI wish I could remember everything he said, but all of a sudden, I was tipsy. It sneaks up on you at Rye. Everything tastes so good, there's no nausea to warn you of your impending liquor limit.\r\n\r\nAnother example of their uncomprising search for flavor - they won't stock popular drinks for popularity's sake. I heard one customer ask for a Corona - he was handed a can of Tecate instead with assurances it was better. I asked for a Red Stripe and was given a Sessions with the same guarantee. Risky? Not if you know what you're doing like Rye does.\r\n\r\nDon't go if: you just want to get your drink on at peak hours. These cocktail masterpieces take time to make and the two-man bar is often backed up three levels deep.\r\n\r\nExtra-Something. I'ts right next to Osha, some of the best Thai food in the city.

There's a great drink list, but the bartenders take forever making the drinks.  There was one girl working there who would rudely move people aside without even saying a simple \"excuse me\", and the lady bartender had a total mean mug.  Drinks are good, but unfriendly service and uninteresting crowd made me want to leave, leave, leave and never come back... pass!", "author": "Christine Y."}

I received a very kind note from someone claiming to be one of the owners of Rye who seemed genuinely concerned that I had such a negative experience.  Or maybe concerned about the one star rating mitigating the overall glowing reviews.  Either way, it was a nice touch.  Point taken- on weekends this whole neighborhood is overrun with all kinds of weirdos- crowding around every watering hole with their Drakkar smarminess.  Nothing the nightlife can do about that.  So I am going to up my rating a bit from one to three to try and be a bit more even-handed.  It does go to show you that ratings on these sites are 100% subjective and usually based on a single brief experience.  Maybe, much as a restaurant critic does, to be less biased I will have to return a second or third time.  This time, as this mysterious co-owner suggested, for hand-crafted whiskey cocktails on a Tuesday.  Then again, us proletariat are not professional critics, are we?  I must admit that the inside of the bar is quite beautiful- from what I could see as I weasled my way to the bar.  Yes, and the bartenders were gamely facing the onslaught, doing a good job handling the crowd four-deep at the bar.  Also I felt welcome even though I was not exactly \"dressed to impress,\" not that I would know how to do that anyway.  I suppose most of my complaints are directed at the insane volume of people squozen into that place.  Can't fault a business for being successful, or can you?\nMea culpa.\n\nMy original reaction after a night at Rye runs below: \n\nugh.  my god.  ugh.  \n\nIf there's an award for most douchtastic bar, this one is a frontrunner.  I'ver never seen so many guys with striped button-down shirts, unbuttoned to there, paired with flip-flops.  Chicks tend to be of the flat-ironed hair,floofy maternity strapless shirt variety.  Drinks are pricey.  From what I remember, the people were packed like spaghetti into the space.  On a cold SF night I was sweating like a whore in church from the crowd.  And the poor smokers were in an actual cage- finally someone has found a way to imprison them.  Mostly I feel sorry for the suckers that flock to this pretentious sweatlodge looking for flat-ironed poon.  They are sure to be disappointed.  Me- I'll be at one of the sad-sack bars on Polk.", "author": "Mags P."}

I do have to say that the bouncer was very nice and friendly, I have a thing about that and it's always nice when the first person you meet in a place is friendly and gives you a nice smile. However it was pretty much the last bit of friendliness I experienced that night at Rye. It's packed and you have to wait forever to order your drink. It's full of people who are there to be cool and frankly just about the only good thing about getting older is that you no longer feel the need to be part of that scene so I was very much over Rye in about five minutes.

Every once in a while you want to get a little bit dressed up and go somewhere kinda swanky where they serve something other than Pabst on tap and the lighting is dim so you look way hotter. The basil gimlet is delish--I probably had one or five too many by the way judging by the way I feel today, but it was totally worth the hangover and I'd do it all over again. The only reason Rye doesn't get a full 5 stars is because the bouncer let in that relentless bitch at the pool table who was so not cool the whole night.

I'm not the shortest dude in the world, but come on. I think the Warriors practice squad must've been there.\nThe women are pretty and they wear the cute little tops that show off their sexy little shoulders and gym sculpted backs, the drinks are stiff, but there is not much room at the front and middle of the bar.  Definitely a place to meet a hot chick spend lots of money on her drinks and hope that she didn't just reaffirm that you really are a sucker.

It's nice that they have the lounge area to the side but frankly I always forget it's there and would feel somewhat removed from the action.

Rye is the kind of joint that has all the ingredients of greatness but something is missing. Maybe its the crowd I don't know, but I found the two times that I went there both disappointing for different reasons. The first time the Jalisco heat cocktail was screaming good, the second time, not so much. The first time the bar wasn't too terribly packed with annoying people, except for the sorority girls discussing like \"oh my god they use such fresh ingredients, what's a sazerac?!\" Oh my god I thought to myself, like any good watering hole should and if you don't know go back to TGI Fridays! Oh man I sound like a booz snob, I'm not I promise, i was wheened on Smirnoff and other horrible swills... but seriously, it's a good place, its just not consistent from visit to visit. I see a lot of eye balling of cocktails at this joint. The jiggers don't come out regularly, funny enough, the Jalisco heat which was great the first time was measured, the 2nd time, it was a Friday night, it wasn't measured and didn't exactly jive, rather the flavors of the various ingredients didn't jive the way they did the first time around. So go ahead, go check out the bar, i'd suggest a week day vs. a weekend, too nutty then... go early try their good rye cocktails and judge for yourself...", "author": "Len S."}

This place makes drinks on par with Nopa, and I don't even have to worry about waiting for the N. This ultra hip lounge is located in the Tendernob on Geary between Leavenworth and Jones. As you enter you'll find the bar but if you continue down a few steps there is an additional room with tables and comfy chairs with walls lined with wine bottles on one side, and white bricks on the other where they project their light show magic. We sat at one of the tables- at around 9 the place is not terribly crowded- and are served by a very nice waitress who is patient as we deliberate over the oh so many mouthwatering cocktail choices. After careful consideration, my drink of choice consisted of gin with pummeled kiwi, cane sugar, cucumber, and lemon. In fact it came with a sliced cucumber floating inside and I made a comment, perhaps inappropriately so, to the waitress that it looked like spa water (ie that water they serve with cucumbers and fruits). Maybe she didn't know what I meant, since she looked appalled, but I quickly informed her that it was only a compliment, since I do indeed love spa water! I only tried one drink here, since next stop was Toronado, and I had the Bay to Breakers to run early the next morning, but I will indeed be back, and plan to sample a specimen closely related to the kiwi-cucumber variety, but instead with basil. The kumquat creations looked tasty too...so many choices it almost stresses me out (but somehow I'll get over it).", "author": "Kate A."}

The bartenders and owners have always made me feel like i have their undivided attention, even when they are super busy they may not be able to sit and chat but they never ignore you and i always return with a beautiful drink and and amazing smile. I'm not sure what their secret is but I'm guessing it has to do with the fact that everyone who works there seems to enjoy what they do. Every bar i happen to go to from now on will be judged by this place and most places don't even come close. If you have time, stop by and say hi to Jen and the rest of the gang. I try to get there a little early so i beat the rush, I would recommend a basil gimlet or even ask the bartender what they recommend. After you grab your drink and head to the outside smoking area and strike up a conversation with one of the many amazing people standing around. I was celebrating my 30th birthday on Sunday and Monday in the city and ended up stopping by there both days. I believe every first Monday of the month they have a cocktail competition for local mixologists, something i highly recommend checking out.

When we got there her friend was well on his way to wasted ; but I bought him a shot of patron for the birthday boy and one for myself and 2 rum and cokes. That came to thirty bucks...not bad but not cheap either. The rum and coke was nice and strong(plus). There was a nice mix of people; no cheap and slinky shirt girls and ghetto boys. No dance floor but you could dance if you wanted and the music was great!(plus). Since it's a bit on the small side my friend and I were standing near the bathroom and there was no line and it appeared clean (huge plus). Fast forward about an hour and a half later and we rejoin the b-day boy and his crowd. This fool is trashed!! And he turned 25 so I was thinking he should be over that s*** ; but he was definitely all over and inside the sloppy drunk M.O. Then real subtle-like he turns his head and spews all over the floor next to the booth he's sitting in.SICK!! So I ask the bartender for a stack of paper towels and attempt to sop it up a bit. Everyone around me was all disgusted and his buddies were embarrassed and avoiding each other's gazes. The more paper towels I spread onto the mess the more comical it became...like sprinkling petals in a wedding or something. Someone came by with a can of Folger's coffee to sprinkle on the mess and it was swept up. Ingenious!! They left, or more accurately, they were helped out by the bouncers. After that it was smooth sailing. The bartenders were all really nice and when I closed my tab after the first and only round they took off part of the tab because of the whole vomit fiasco. Awesome!! I am definitely coming back sans barfo to enjoy the chill atmosphere with no cover, fabulous staff and interesting crowd.", "author": "JoAnna S."}

We tried to go to the Ambassador for drinks last night but they had a private party so we crossed to Rye.  From the outside it was packed.  The \"cage\" of smokers was full.  Which was hilarious since once we got inside there was plenty of room for the most part.  So when I say cage, they have an artsy installation that separates the outside patio to the inside lounge via glass.  There was only one bartender there last night and we had to wait a bit for our drinks, but the space is nice, there is a pool table with girls that randomly dance around it (at least last night there was).  There are comfy booths are bar seating.  For a Tuesday night, busy enough, and comfortable enough.  There was a large bowl of oranges and limes in front of me that I was itching to poach, but held back.  I've been there for happy hour as well and I have to say it was packed.  There was a special on the board, but Todd went with Blood and Sand and I asked for a Beautiful for old times sake, but they didn't have Courvoisier (umm hello you are a lounge!!) so I differed to my current go to, Fernet.

The crowd is pretty chill, not too \"bridge and tunnel\" but not extreme TL.  The staff is super friendly, the ambiance is clean, industrial/modern, and the basil gimlets are worth the trip.  Never a cover, and not overly crowded on a Saturday night.", "author": "Bert D."}
