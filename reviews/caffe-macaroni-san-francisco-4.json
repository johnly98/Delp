While I'm aware it's difficult to pinpoint the origin of a stomach bug, my friend and I both woke up the next day with the same symptoms after we shared the food at Caffe Macaroni (seafood pasta and soup). It was the only place we had eaten together. Looking back, something seemed a bit wrong with the pasta, like it used spices to cover up a bad seafood taste. I have a hunch it was the mussels. The next day both of us woke with lower abdomen cramps and haven't been able to get better for a week now. I've gone to the doctor twice and am now on antibiotics, although it's too soon to tell if it's a virus or bacteria. \n\nI called the restaurant to let them know and the manager, while very polite and receptive of my information, refused to believe that it could've been their restaurant. He noted that no one else had called to complain, but I don't think that's a valid argument since it's pretty rare for people to call a place for getting food poisoning considering there's nothing the restaurant can really do at that point to make you better. \n\nSo, to leave a more well-rounded review, here are other thoughts:  The place has character, and feels pretty cool with the low ceilings. The staff had that Italian attitude that added to the authenticity. But to be honest, the quality just wasn't there. Had my friend and I not gotten a long-lasting and painful stomach bug--and yes, I'm very positive it's from here--I would've rated them 3 stars. \n\nI hope this is just a one-time only thing. But if you also got food poisoning or a stomach bug, please contact this restaurant so they can tidy things up. \n\nHappy dining~", "author": "Brent C."}

Of course, there was wine throughout the meal and a light creamy fruit topped dessert that was scrumptious. \nYes, I recommend this restaurant and think you would enjoy the food, enjoyable excellent service in a location that...other than the usual challenge to find parking in San Francisco...is a great place to dine and wine.", "author": "Willliam O."}

They also have seating outside in front of the cafe for another 8-10 people.\n\nOne of the greatest things about going to North Beach in San Francisco is that you get real, authentic Italian food made by Italian immigrants and very much in an authentic manner. The people at Caffe Macaroni were great. Very friendly and with Italian accents that make you feel immediately like you made the right choice on where to dine. I haven't heard the word \"prego\" that many times since I was in Italt two years ago.\n\nI had the baby squid ragu over spaghetti and my wife had the baked pasta. Both dishes were AMAZING. My dish had so much flavor I was using bread to soak up every last bit of sauce on my plate. By the time I was done, my plate was so clean it looked like there was never any food on it. \n\nGreat food, good prices and a very cool experience.

I can see why it has great ratings but I can also see why it has some terrible ones.  \n\nWe walked up on a Saturday night with no reservations at about 930pm.  There were only 2 other tables taken.  The dining room itself is literally the cutest thing.  It is tiny and cute and transports you to a whimsical place.  Mario (the owner?) was standing outside to greet us but it seemed like he was upset we were coming in.  I sat at the wrong seat and he yelled at me.  \n\nWe were trying to order and he would come to our table but not look at us.  He would ask if we were ready but then he would walk away without listening to us.  It felt very much like he was mad and didn't want us to be there.\n\nWe never got waters, even though we asked for them and had to ask for the bread.  The bread was terrible!  Seemed older and was stone cold.  The garlic oil was the saving grace.  That oil was freaking delicious.\n\nWe ordered the papparedelle and the linguini.  Both were good but not stellar.  There seemed to be missing some seasoning.  Maybe salt.  They just didn't have any oomph.  Not great but not bad.  \n\nThe servers were basically ignoring us even if we had a request.  Can I please just have some water?  I wish I spoke Italian so I could know if they were talking about us.  \n\nWe wanted to get dessert but they turned the lights off to the display case while we were sitting next to it.

This was my pick the day before a 15K race so I was carbo loading! \n\nThe tortellini was delicious! Filled with cheese and beautifully al dente and dressed in a not so overwhelming or heavy cream sauce. The pancetta and peas were a perfect addition, adding additional creaminess and sweetness to this dish. \n\nThey also start you off with a bread basket and a plate of olive oil with garlic solids inside.\n\nWhat caught my attention the most aside from the garlic themed decor is the owner in white. Judging by these reviews his name is Mario. There was a pup and his owner stopping by and Mario did not hesitate to welcome the pup by offering him a biscuit. It was so sweet. I love establishments that are pet friendly and cater to man's furry best friend too. \n\nThis place was great and you can tell locals frequent this place, as the patron they sat next to me knew Mario and asked him about his kitchen remodeling.\n\nWill come back to try their other menu offerings!", "author": "Connie M."}

Three seems too little for the experience but 4 seems a bit high. This is a sold 3.5 in my book.\n\nWe were going to the speakeasy for the night so I looked for a reservation within walking distance with great reviews. According to Yelp this is a 4.5 so we were excited. We had a reservation and when we showed up we were surprised to see only seating for 10 people which were all taken. They told us it would be a few minutes. After freezing outside for a while and wondering how we were going to fit they brought us upstairs which we didn't know existed.\n\nThe ceilings are low and the place is more than intimate. My wife thought it was a bit too claustrophobic for her tastes and would probably never go back.  \n\nI saw the garlic oil and bread on Yelp and was excited to try it before our meal but ours never came. We asked the waiter for some and it ended up coming after our main course arrived. The service was overall slow and not super friendly (not bad, just not great).

It also seemed to be missing something (maybe a pinch of salt.)\n\nRavioli was also good but nothing special. It was a red sauce with a drizzle of pesto on top. The red sauce also seemed a bit thin but it seems that this is what the place is going for.\n\nChicken/gnocchi dish was just ok.

That is impressive in of itself; North Beachers are notoriously picky & not at all fond of most of the local tourist traps.  \n\nThis restaurant might look like a tourist trap by all outward appearances, but believe me it is not.  Authentic, fresh, & thoroughly delicious, CM does pastas & sauces to perfection.  The sauces here, red, white, or green, are all superb.  Salivation worthy.  And the arrabbiata is bomb AF.\n\nThe space is funky, tiny, warm, & fun.  Casual is the vibe, so if you're after a refined, elegant dinner, this is obviously not a natural choice.

The white wine sauce was pretty flavorful but it was too liquidy; it didn't have enough butter to really stick to the pasta. The pasta was al dente and that's about the best I can say for the dish.

I'm updating it because of the shocking behavior of the owner. I encourage you to keep reading till the end.\n\nLast night, I took my friend there because of my first positive experience. It's a small place so the moment I entered to write down our names, the server who was on her way out told me \"you shouldn't stand on the way!\" And aggressively pushed me out. I smiled and said I needed a table for two. She ignored me and kept serving others. At first, I thought she just had a bad day but then realized she was actually very nice and friendly to other customers, taking photos of them and trying to be humorous.\n\nWe waited for a few more minutes, but she still ignored us and didn't take a minute to write our names down. I was very surprised by this unwelcoming behavior and wanted to talk to the manager but I was told that the server was actually the owner. We left  the place in shock and dined at another restaurant where we were very welcomed.\n\nI don't want to put a label on what she did but it's Trump's America and it gives confidence to people with racist inclinations to expose their beliefs in action. Or even if she was not racist and did this because she hated my appearance for a personal reason, it shows she as the owner doesn't  really value her customers and it's all about money. The restaurant is doing well and who cares if a random customer is humiliated.\n\nWhen I pick a restaurant my criteria won't be focused on food only. I care about other factors such as how much they really care about us as customers/humans. I wouldn't give business to someone with this kind of mindset.

Made reservations on open table 30 mins before just to make sure we have table.\n\nArriving around 5:45pm, restaurant was about a half full, mostly looked like marathon runners. By the time we were ready to leave, they were packed with some people waiting for tables. Easy to make reservations online via open table.\n\nSome outdoor patio seats and small dining area on the first floor. Taking narrow steep stairs will lead to low ceiling dining area with more tables. They packed tables so tight, once seated, hard to move around.\n\nSpaghetti with tomato and garlic I ordered was just so perfect. Perfect al dente, just the way I like it. Sauce had nice garlicky flavor, really enjoyed my food. \n\nIt was just happened to be my bambino's birthday, and they helped us celebrate with tiramisu.  I went downstairs to order a tiramisu and asked them if they could put a candle. Servers and all other guests sang birthday song, made the day so special. I had a bite of tiramisu and oh I wished I could have a whole cake or two to myself! \n\nAlthough I didn't drink but they had nice Italian wine on their list along with some Italian after dinner liquors. \n\nNext time when I am in town (not for marathon but just regular business trip), I would love to come back to try different food with a glass of wine or two.\n\nServers spoke Italian. (S as in plural, both spoke Italian).  I got to practice ordering my food with just a little I know.\n\nWho said we should eat pasta the night before marathon?

The restaurant is quite small inside, with only space for four tables. It's a cozy, intimate atmosphere.\n\nWe ordered the steak and penne amatrice. Both came out exactly as we expected, cooked perfectly. There was complimentary bread and olive oil (super garlicky) and we finished with tiramisu for dessert.

Don't be scared away it's great friendly service even if it feels a little cramped sometimes.\n\nMy favorite thing is to order spaghetti arrabiatta.  It's technically not on the menu but they make it really well anyway.  And I like to add the garlic from the garlic and bread dip on top.  Some times they go way too spicy but it's still good. I order it every single time and will keep going back for it.\n\nEverything else is tasty too.  I don't think they make their own fresh noodles but the flavors of the sauces are so great.  The papardalle with ragu is great too.  Other favorites: black pasta and seafood, baby octopus pasta, clams and linguine, burratta appetizer and the list goes on.\n\nDessert: who knew it's great here - the panna cotta is great (just I don't care for the cherry sauce) and the fruits and zabaoine (?) are really good too.\n\nIt's $17-$22 an entree so it isn't cheap but where in North Beach are you going to get this quality of food for cheap anyway.\n\nReservations on OpenTable but sometimes I think they just ignore it completely and do whatever they want.\n\n1 bathroom downstairs in the corner.\n\nStreet parking only.", "author": "Traci H."}

I don't get such a warm fuzzy feeling elsewhere. It's a neighborhood gem!\n\nThe restaurant has a perfectly quaint and warm ambiance suitable for catching up with friends, bringing your parents, or for date night. The seating area on the ground floor has no more than 4-5 tables. Going upstairs you'll find a few more tables in that same warm environment with a window so you can look out onto North Beach.\n\nThe service - I can't speak about it without mentioning the incredible waiters/waitresses! Mario is the owner and hopefully you will be served by Mikhael or Angela. Mikhael feels like family to me and interacting with him literally puts me right in Italy! He's quick to bring you some of their bread with the incredible garlic oil for dipping, speedy to fill up that glass of wine, and overall attentive to his guests. They really do treat their guests like royalty. \n\nThe food is DELIGHTFUL and authentic. Pasta is cooking perfectly al dente and you can truly taste the freshness in each of their sauces. My absolute faves are the Penne Amatrice (delectable tomato sauce with pancetta) and the Aglio Oilio (never had an Aglio Olio done as well as here). I stick to these two classics and occasional venture to their specials to have the seafood pasta. But those two top all!\n\nYou must have wine here. It is affordable and the best thing to do is to just tell Mikhael to choose one for you. \"Mikhael, surprise me\" \"Okay Bella!\"\n\nLove love love this spot!!

There is a more spacious (though tightly packed like in Italy) seating area upstairs, where your head may or may not touch the ceiling. Very cozy feeling.\n\nOur waiter was hilarious and made us feel at home. His name was Michaeli or something like that. Poor guy was waiting on all the tables that evening but always made sure we had what we needed. We started with some glasses of chianti while snacking on Burrata and Bufala. Would highly recommend the Burrata. Both were tasty starts to the meal though.\n\nEveryone at the table ordered the black linguine with prawns, mussels, clams, calamari, baby octopus, and garlic. Our colleague had talked so highly of this dish that we could not turn down the option. It was INCREDIBLE. Words can't even begin to describe how fresh this dish tasted. The seafood was huge and served in generous portions, and the black linguini was clearly homemade. Definitely coming back to have this again.\n\nAnd of course, we ended our meal with dessert. Well more like my friend ordered tiramisu and I stole a bite off her plate. Heavenly. Especially with coffee. Overall the experience, food, and service were all 5 stars. 6 stars, if that were possible.

Authentic Italian food complete with Italian-speaking cooks and servers. This hole in the wall is easy to pass up because it looks a little run down and sketchy, but usually those turn out to be the best eateries.\n\nFOOD: 5 stars. \nDefinitely the best Italian food I've had in awhile. I'm not a fan of extremely fancy food. I prefer the quality and taste of food over presentation. This place hit the spot. I don't remember the name of the dish I had, but it was basically a Baked Ziti. You could tell the sauce was 100% homemade. The pasta was cooked to perfection. It was delicious. My brother had the Margherita pizza while my mom and sister split the cannelloni. The cannelloni was fantastic. My dad had the Branzino (?) with spaghetti. This, in my opinion, was the most delectable  because it had so many layers of flavor. I highly recommend that dish. \n\nSERVICE: 5 stars.\nGreat service. The owner and bus boy/server were both very welcoming and made us feel right at home. They made jokes with us the whole time and were fantastic. No complaints at all.\n\nAMBIANCE/LOCATION: 4.5 stars.\nI think it could be better. Really tiny but it's places like these that I end up appreciating more because they are more friendly and tend to have great food. I just don't like the location of the restaurant.

Even though the portions were a little small they were packed with flavor. Service however was lacking but they made up for it later.\n\nFood: 5/5 (Would rate it higher actually but can't go over 100%)\nPortions: 3/5\nService: 3/5 (they redeemed themselves a star. Read review for details)\nAmbience: 5/5\n\nThe long: Thanks to the reservation we were seated immediately,  but only a party of 3 was waiting. We were seated outside along the steet.\nWe were given our menu and waiter/chef said he'd be back. After 10 mins he finally came back to take our order.  So we ordered off the menu the fasul di calamari (squid with cannolone beans, arugula), she got the  linguine di mare (linguine with seafood) and I got the penne a matrices  (penne with spicy garlic tomato sauce and pancetta). A beer and 2 waters to drink.\n\nA waitress brought out the beer quickly along with bread and an olive oil infused with minced garlic and chili flake.  We figured her hands were full to get the water and she'd be back.  Nope, didn't come back with water.  So 15 minutes pass and the squid appetizer arrives. This time it's the original all waiter and we again ask for water.  Again no luck. \n\nThe squid looked simple, almost boring.  When we tried it we were pleasantly surprised.  The squid itself was very tender and flavorful.  The cannolone beans added body and the arugula as fresh and a little bitter. Great appetizer.\n\nStill no waters at this point.  Getting thirsty, I start drinking the gf's beer.  After another few minutes we get the waiter/chef over again, order another beer and we finally get water.  Now this was probably 30 minutes since we sat down.\n\nShortly after receiving our water, our pasta comes out, but were missing the other beer which we never received.  Again very simple looking.  Portion was small. Our expectations went down after seeing the dishes.  We take our first bite and smile at each other.  My penne was garlicky, meaty and hearty.  Immediately gave a bite to the gf and she said the same thing.  She gave me a bite of the linguine and the sauce was amazing. Fresh, briny, garlicky goodness.  The clams and mussels were just steamed to the open they opened which meant they were tender.\n\nWhile eating, the waiter/chef gave the menu to another group. Then he started saying the specials.  I was like \"what?!\" I wanted to hear the specials also! They had a homemade papardelle pasta with ragu and fresh grated parmesan. Would have ordered that if I knew. Not that I was unhappy with my dish but that was what I craved for last night.  This waiter/chef was killing me.\n\nAfter finishing our food, the waitress clears our plates.  She asks if we received our second beer.  I said no but it's ok at this point.  It turns out the waiter/chef is her husband and although she was sorry, she loved when this happens so she could rip her husband a new one. Before proceeding to give her husband a new orifice, she wanted to make sure we were not charged for the second beer.  \n\nShe came back with the check and apologized about the beer and the wait.  She told us to take our time and went back into the restaurant.  I reviewed the check. \nPasta amatrice, check. \nLinguine di mare, check. \nOnly one beer, check. \nThat was it. 3 items.  They had missed the calamari.  Thinking to myself do I want to save money and hide the error, or support this little restaurant,  I opted for the latter. So the waitress comes over and I let her know she didn't charge us for the appetizer.  She was stunned I even mentioned it. She smirked.  I knew immediately her husband was going to get another verbal thrashing.  She appreciated my honesty and said she the appetizer was on her.  Feeling happy about saving money but at the same time a little guilty we left a generous tip.  \n\nAs we were getting ready to leave, the husband comes out and apologizes (good job wife!). In his hand is a shot. My gf's face lights up.  They gave us a free shot of limoncello.

I was uncertain of what to expect, because the signage and decor seemed very old school / divey and reminded me of a mom and pop version of Buca di Beppo. Then, when I arrived I noticed the wait staff varied from stand-offish to boisterous; this place seemed to attract alot of European tourists and return customers. The service was a bit slow, and forgetful, but friendly in an almost obtrusive way. Our server described each dish like this, \"Pappardelle bla bla bla\" - literally. I don't know what to make of it.\n\nVenue: There are a few small outdoor tables for 2-4 people (no heating lamp), a few indoor tables (4-6 people), and a small upstairs section which could seat a few small parties or one large party of maybe 15. It's a bit claustraphobic, but cute and oddly decorated with neon green twinkle lights and parchment paper rolls, a low ceiling, and a nice street facing view. The upstairs area got really loud and there were only 6 other people there. Reservations were somewhat easy, and I saw several walk in (Tuesday at 7:30PM) without much of a wait.\n\nFood: \n* COMPLIMENTARY BREAD AND GARLIC OLIVE OIL - 3.5 STARS:\nMediocre but fresh bread, soft on the inside but crusty on the outside. Served with their house made garlic olive oil, super flavorful and addictive. I think they use the same bread for the pizza.\n\n* BUFFALO MOZZARELLA E PROSCUITTO  - 2 STARS:\nSmall and mediocre piece of mozzarella (think: Costco, not bad but not great), served with maybe 4 slices of standard proscuitto. Meh, I've had better.\n\n* SQUID INK LINGUINI ($17) - 4 STARS:\nThis is not on their menu (note: their online and restaurant menu differ slightly). The seafood was mediocre in quality and freshness, but it was really flavorful and one of the two favorite pastas of the evening.\n\n* PAPPARDELLE BOLOGNESE - Special ($17) - 4 STARS:\nThis house special was very simple, yet so delicious - the other favorite pasta dish of the evening. The pasta and the sauce were perfectly executed - the pasta was nicely al dente, and the sauce and cheese were unexpectedly delicious. \n\n* SAUSAGE PASTA ($17) - 3 STARS:\nMix of farfella (bow tie) and rotini pastas served with pasta. It was just not my cup of tea.\n\n* PORK LOIN - 2 STARS:\nA bit dry and flavorless, served over cannelloni beans. Skip.", "author": "Jess C."}

The atmosphere, the decoration, the feel, the owner, the cooks and of course...the food!\n\nI picked this place after reading some Yelp reviews about restaurants around little Italy.\nI got there around 2PM, for a late lunch. There was only one couple seating in this super tiny restaurant (4 tables of 2 outside, 5 tables for 2 inside. There might be an upper floor, I didn't check).\n\nThe owner/waiter is Italian. Being from an French-Italian family, I ordered a special dish composed of Mozzarella and antipasti only, the sardine spaghetti, anchovies and a bottle of (excellent) Montepulciano. See photos for details.\nI won't describe all the great feelings I had while eating there. Everything was gourmet, well prepared and cooked (al-dente spaghetti). Sardines were amazingly grilled with herb and garlic and my antipasti was seasoned to perfection!\nI had a very nice espresso to conclude this amazing meal. 51$ for the whole thing. Unbeatable.

We went ahead and made a same day reservation since it was Valentine's day. Fast forward 2 hours, we were received by Mario who was very nice and led us to our table upstairs, up to this point everything was going well until the waitress took about 10mins to give us our menu (I had to ask her about it), and yes she was the one who seated us, so it was strange she forgot to give us our menu. Anyway, she took our order promptly and left. 30 minutes passed by and no water, no bread, we were totally forgotten and mind you this is a tiny place. \n\nAfter 1 hour of waiting, the food finally arrives. You'd probably say \"well it's Valentine's day of course the food will take longer than usual\", this is a small restaurant plus two couples who arrived after us got their food first, in fact, our food arrived when the people who arrived after us already finished! To make matters worse, the food was very disappointing. The pasta was not cooked properly, felt like they rushed in their cooking, and this was for both mine and my gf's dishes. The portions were not generous and they never filled our water. \nIn the end, by the time we left this restaurant we were still hungry, thirsty, and not satisfied with the taste. A waste of money and a waste of 80+ minutes of our life. We should have eaten Italian food at home instead, as I cook way better Italian food, faster, and a quarter of the price than this restaurant.

Oh yes, this place is so Italiano! The red vinyl long bench, the bright red stilettos hanging on the wall and the dangling garlic garlands in the front windows will grab you the instant you step foot into this gem of a place located in North Beach. Inside this warm and charming caffe, rest assured the kitchen will whip up some of the best culinary delights imported from Italy. Listen to Dino belt out some Italian favorites to set you in the right mood....\n\n                      \"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie\n                                                 That's amore\n         When the world seems to shine like you're had too much wine\n                                                  That's amore\"\n\nSo could Pavarotti and Bocelli!\n\nMario quickly showed us to our table and served us a complimentary basket of warm crusty bread with a side of chopped garlic and olive oil as a tasty spread while we browsed the menu. A great way to start as an antipasto was CM's own Pan Pumarol ($6.75). This was a bruschetta-like grilled focaccia bread and came in four oversized slices. The bread was coated with garlic and topped with tomatoes, oregano, olive oil, salt and pepper. Fresh garlic gave the bread a strong, pungent and nutty flavor. The grilling gave the bread the perfect crunch. Delizioso!\n\nNext was another dish which honest to God, I've never had before prepared this way. It was labeled in the menu as Fasul E'Calamari ($13.00). This was fresh Monterey calamari served in a light tasty broth with cannelloni beans, wild arugula and chopped tomato. Compliments to the chef for not overcooking the calamari, as the calamari was soft and tender and so were the cannelloni beans. There was not quite enough liquid to drink as a soup but plenty that begged to be sopped up with focaccia. Highly recommended! \n\nThe best dish tonight was unequivocally the Linguine Neri (Squid Ink) served with an assortment of Shell Fish ($21.75) like clams, mussels, calamari tentacles and a large shell-on shrimp. The full-bodied sauce as far as I can tell was a concoction of white wine, olive oil and garlic. What was interesting was the squid ink, a weird black colored ingredient that made the linguine look black, rich and briny. Contrary to common belief, while the black squid ink did add a subtle seafaring flavor, it was neither too salty nor briny. Instead, it paired well with the shellfish. I can say that if you love cioppino, you would love the flavors of squid ink linguine with shellfish.\n\nMario, the owner, was the perfect host. He was loud, he was quirky and above all funny. It was quite a welcome change to hear only Italian spoken among his help with Mario (in a nice way) as their Godfather. He hails from Positano, Italy and makes no bones that he appreciates your patronage. Parking can be a challenge and it may be easier later in the evening when the cars are gone from the nearby FiDi.\n\nGrazie tanto!", "author": "Geoff G."}

And because I'm using that word, I'll make this review more of a story.\n\nOur story took place this week-- in Nov 2015.  My global #LinkedInLife cohort and I were in SF for new hire training. We were a group from Hong Kong, London, NY, Chicago, and of course Cali. When we were ready for dinner, the one cuisine on which we could all agree was -- Italiano!  (side note-- is food the path to world peace?  Methinks so).  Coincidentally, Emi, our British born, yet Japanese colleague had a Sicilian cab driver on her way in. When she asked for restaurant recommendations, Caffe Macaroni was the first out of his mouth.  When she told us, we all immediately thought Macaroni Grill.  No offense, as MG has saved me many a night in mid America, but CM was/is on a completely different  dimension.\n\nOur impromptu outing began at our conveniently located hotel, Galleria Park, which hosts a lovely happy hour every evening.  Primed with a nice Mondavi Napa valley cab, we all quickly agreed on Italian (Emi and I had walked by the previous night, so we had already scoped it out).  Knowing the storefront looked to be the size of a shoebox, I called nonetheless.  \"Excuse me, but do you happen to have a table for 10 available.. for NOW?\"  I tried to ask gently (My inner Hungry Hippo starting to take over).  \"Of course!  C'mon over\"  was the welcome reply. \n\nAfter a missed turn from Google Maps (seriously, Google!), we made it to CM.  As I said, it looks to be the size of a shoe box, and the front booth was already filled. Nonetheless, the owner graciously welcomed us.  CM looks as though it's pulled straight out of Europe-- sidewalk cafe tables, long booth facing the front window, and the kitchen front and center. Then and there is where the magic began.  \n\nLike the first note in a symphony, the smells of the kitchen permeated the air.  My cartoon-self started floating towards it.  My practical self, asked, \"But where is there room?\"  We then met our server extraordinare, Michele, who guided us through a small opening, up the stairs to the second floor, that had ceilings so low, I literally scraped them (I\"m only 5'11).  It is painted all red with various adornments on the wall -- it's the authentic look chain restaurants always go for, but never achieve.  \"Gratzi!\" I replied-- which kicked off a hilarious opus of Spanglish-Italiano among all of us all night.  Michele served to be not only our waiter, but our entertainer and muse, kindly laughing at all our silliness and adding to the fire with his own retorts.. \"prego prego!\". \n\nWe ordered an assortment of antipasti-- pizza, charcuterie-- and although I didn't get any pizza (ahem!!!!), it smelled amazing and my colleagues would have said as much if their faces weren't stuffed.  When it came to the main entree-- my Rabbit bolognese with housemade pasta rags-- all the promise of those original smells on sidewalk was delivered wholly and completely. I eat a lot of Italian (my hubby is Sicilian!) and this meal was there at the top.  The pasta was perfectly al dente, and the sauce was delicious, perfectly clinging to the pasta.\n\nOur story concludes with a promise to dear Michele that I would write this review on Yelp.  The morale being-- when you have an experience like this-- the food, the energy, the laughs-- you must pay it forward.", "author": "Matthew S."}

My mom got the ravioli and I got the pesto pasta. We both preferred mine. Oil that comes with the bread was great but I do wish they would warm the bread up before it comes out and the nice waiter gave us a glass of wine on the house which we appreciated.

What Caffe Macaroni does differently though is that the olive oil they serve up is chock full of actual slices of garlic, which adds for some great flavor.\n\nThe carbonara I ordered was not quite what I expected, thinking it was something more akin to the one you can get at Chez Maman. Still, enjoyable, though I'm admittedly not a huge fan of al dente style noodles.\n\nAnd, having tried a bite of my coworker's spaghetti, I can say that was quite tasty, despite being so simple.

The sauce was light with a nice tang, but not overpowering. There was a good amount of seafood in the squid ink pasta, even a whole langostine. The seafood was slightly overcooked, though. The ink pasta tasted like it was freshly made.\n\nWe finished our meal with a small slice of spaghetti cake. Yup, you heard it right, it's made with leftover pasta.

Yelp epic fail.\n\nI stopped going to this place last year and just remembered that I promised myself that I was going to put this on Yelp. \n\nI have been to Cafe Macaroni twice. \n\nFirst experience: I tried the special of the day which was pasta with squids. It was a mediocre 3 stars experience.\n\n*Second experience*: I had 3 friends (my girlfriend and her friends) visiting the city and they asked me to go there. Even though I told them that I did not have a great experience and there are better restaurants in San Francisco, they insisted due to the raving Yelp reviews and outside seating.\n\nThe food came, 3 women and myself, none of us enjoyed our pastas. Not even one person thought the food was good. In a city that is well known with their great restaurants, this is unacceptable. However, I would still be giving at least 2 stars (or maybe not write a review at all). What made me to write this review is how the waiter treated us/me. \n\nFirst he said that he can only take 1 card for a table of 4. I told him that I don't see anything written about this anywhere (not on the menu or the walls, etc) and he should have let us know this ahead of time. He still did not change his mind and left the bill on table for us to figure out who is going to pay. I picked up the check and went inside because I did not want to argue in front of my girlfriend and her 2 friends. I tried to convince him with no luck. Finally I told him that thanks to this attitude I will probably never come back to this place again. Then I went back outside to our table. My friends asked what happened and I told them that I could not convince him and we need to give one card.\n\nGuess what happened after... After a minute the waiter came out, and shouted at me saying that he does not give a f*** whether I (or \"we\" since now he is talking in front of my friends) come back or not. My friends were in shock trying to understand what happened since they did not hear our conversation inside. \n\nWondering how many stars this behavior deserves ... in the heart of the most touristic city of US...

Well this was the case with me. I came here for two reasons: 1) sea urchin pasta 2) whole roasted branzino. I've had the sea urchin before but I was craving it again. I love the presentation of the pasta in the sea urchin shell. In addition when I ate here for lunch about a month ago I noticed one customer had a whole roasted branzino, which is a Mediterranean sea bass found throughout Italy. The neat thing was Mario filleted the fish right in front of the customer. \n\nI ate here again last night with the specific mind of having the sea urchin pasta. When I asked Mario if he still sells the sea urchin pasta he said he ran out of fresh sea urchins. He said when he gets fresh sea urchins he will definitely put it on the menu. I did have the backup plan - the whole roasted branzino, which was available. I also asked Mario what kind of pasta will compliment with the branzino and he recommended small spaghetti with garlic while I was waiting for the roasted branzino. \n\nThe spaghetti was perfectly light - it didn't make me full before having the roasted branzino. As usual the pasta was al dente. After eating the spaghetti, arrived the main course. If you want a performance art when you eat observe Mario filleting the branzino right in front of you. It is a great sight to see. Eating the whole fish is much better a fillet because it is juicier. Think of how cooking a whole rotisserie chicken is much different than cooking different parts of the chicken separately. The cool thing is even when Mario fillets the branzino the skin remains crispy. Is it the best fish I ever had? No but it's pretty damn good. Whereas you go to restaurants where they try to be fancy with their fillet fish, the art of roasting a whole fish is a skill that is underappreciated. And if not careful you can overcook the fish just as overcooking a steak.\n\nAs with the last time I ate here I gave this a 5-star rating. Mario really looked out for me when he suggested small pasta instead of regular sized pasta that can tend to be huge portions. By having a small pasta I wasn't full when I waited in anticipation for the roasted branzino. \n\nGrazie Mario.\n\nMario next time I'll order the sea urchin.", "author": "Gerald R."}

It's a pity because it was cooked well, with lots of flavor.

On the corner of Jackson Street and Columbus Avenue on the border of the Financial and Chinatown districts sits this tiny little caf\u00e9 that puts out big food. The owner used to own a place called The Purple Onion across the street ... a joint where a young Bob Dylan among others got a start performing. The owner sold the building when prices got too high to ignore and moved his downsized Italian restaurant to this little closet on the opposite corner.  \n\nCaf\u00e9 Macaroni has but five little two-person tables right in the window on the first floor along with its open kitchen...yes that is seating for 10; upstairs under an exceptionally low ceiling there are maybe 15 additional seats - so this restaurant weighs in with seating for roughly 25.  Now to the food...for our table of five that took up most of the first floor.  \n\nFor starters we shared two appetizers: Bufala mozzarella (roughly a third of a cup of fresh mozzarella with thin slices of prosciutto)...and their version of bruschetta (nice thick slices of soft Italian bread spread with a spicy olive tapenade and just a hint of tomato rather than a layer of chopped tomato). The main courses here start with a short menu of regular items that is supplemented with a nice array of daily specials...we had two of the specials.\n\nI had the pork belly (special) cooked in fennel (luscious pork belly sliced thin like bacon and served with the thin fennel slices it was simmered with)...one of our party had the spaghetti and meatballs (two large meat balls and very nice al dente noodles)...another had the special pollo giorno with potato gnocchi (the chicken was lovely but the gnocchi melted in your mouth)...another had the cannelloni stuffed with two cheeses in a light tomato sauce (mozzarella and ricotta and wonderful)...and the last had a pasta amiscat amatrice (delightful dish of pasta flavored with pancetta and pecorino cheese).\n\nWe complemented dinner with a bottle of chianti and finished with tiramisu...how very Italian. The hit of the dinner were the two servers...both very Italian with thick accents. But you could understand their speech just enough if you paid attention to their hand gestures which accompanied everything they did. When we arrived they pretended to reel us in like fish, and they continued to entertain for the whole evening. They are a real draw for this place as they make dinner a memorable event. \n\nThis place was highly recommended in YELP reviews and I agree. The little restaurant is noisy and the seating is close, but it is a delightful dinner place that can be romantic or just plain fun. Give it a try.", "author": "Rick B."}

I was gabbing away so when an enthusiastic man with a heavy Italian accent and friendly smile invite us into Caffe Macaroni, I just assumed we got tired of walking and were going in... little did I know this spot had actually been preselected by a couple of the other Ambassadors. CM does have an almost perfect rating and I can see why. I love a business that's not scared to invite people in from off the streets when they have some tables open or are having a slow night.\n\nOur group was seven or eight-ish big so it's worth noting CM is hella small. We were seated downstairs and combined almost all of the two seat tables they had to accommodate our group. The mirrors on the back wall did help to open up the space. It turned out they do have space upstairs, but I'm not entirely sure how much so if you have any more than five people in your group I'd say call ahead.\n\nNo macaroni... oh the irony. Somehow that made me love the name more. I settled on the Penne All Amatriciana (which I had to verify the pronunciation with the server). This place is Italian through and through. It would've taken me a bit to recite the menu aloud.\n\nWe were brought bread and olive oil with balsamic vinaigrette during our wait and I probably ate more than my share. Before we knew it, our food had arrived. My penne was cooked perfectly and the sauce was impeccable. And the pancetta... the pancetta! Yes, just do this! I think I stole off of everyone's plate and everything was delicious.\n\nThe only downfall of the night was the bill. Not the price, but when we asked for the checks we were given one for our group. And after it was brought we immediately let them know the bill needed to be separate. To which we found out couldn't be done. I've worked with a ton of different credit card machines... you can always cancel a check and start over... always. And they wouldn't allow us to use multiple cards (which that I understand). The whole paying escapade put a little damper on the night, but all in all I loved CM and I'm sure next time I'm in the area I'll be making a stop.", "author": "Tanya Y."}

We made a reservation and arrived on time.  I started to walk in the door behind a waitress that was waiting on a table outside.  I figured I needed to check in.  She turned around and rudely asked \"can I help you\" as though I was intruding or doing something wrong.  I told her we had a reservation and she rudely told me should couldn't help me but the owner Mario would be down when he could to handle things.  I'd have been okay with it had she been nice about it.  It was an immediate turn off.  It didn't take long and we were seated.  The place is small both upstairs and down.  It's very loud too so if you are trying to have a conversation, it may pose a challenge if you don't hear well.  Our waiter was very nice and worked to take care of us.  Mario and the rude woman were visible but were very focused on catering to specific customers and never came to our table as mentioned by many in the reviews.  The food we had was decent but I sadly I can get just as good or way better at a local family run Italian establishment in my hometown.    I would tell others who may be considering dining there is that it will be average and manage your expectations accordingly.

We decided to take the scenic route - you know, the 101 to the 1 at Morro Bay, riding the coast up for 123 miles to Monterey before cutting back over to the 101 - and it must have taken us a solid 11 hours or so, what with stops for food and bathroom breaks and leg stretching and all. It was a long haul, worth it, but very time consuming. And draining. \n\nWhat the hell does any of that have to do with Italian food? Because my parents, brother, cousin and his fiance were all waiting here for us, so we literally went from a half-day's drive straight into a seat here. Thankfully, Mario and his band of servers were so ebullient it got me back on my game in no time. My dad eats here whenever he's in the city, and being a fellow Italian he and Mario have become good friends, so our experience may have been a little more personal than most but that isn't to say anyone walking in off the street wouldn't be treated just as well. \n\nWe began with wine. What else? Mario brought out a trio of appetizers for the table to munch on, including calamari, black mussels, and burrata cheese. I'm a big seafood eater and all of this was absolutely exquisite. Lots of bold flavoring and complementary flavors. But all this was merely a warm-up to the main course. \n\nI never even looked at a menu. Mario ran down the night's specials and mentioned a black pasta dish with mussels, fish, scallops... basically all the things I wanted to eat at that moment in time in a bowl together. Black pasta is fantastic, by the way. Definitely get some if you see it offered. Not saying it'll blow your mind or anything, just that it's different enough to warrant trying. Every morsel of sea-dwelling creature contained within this large bowl of beauty was divine. Mario and his guys know how to do amazing traditional Italian and this dish exemplified what that's all about. \n\nA couple desserts and an espresso later, I needed to be wheeled out on a gurney.

We both had the lentil soup to start, and we finished with the tiramisu and cannoli.  Everything was delicious and the upstairs was a cozy area to sit (but don't stand too quickly with the low ceilings!).\n\nAt some point while we ate, another couple was seated at the other end of the same table, so we started chatting.  He had just flown back from Intel, so they were having their own romantic city getaway before driving home.  They also enjoyed their meals (squid ink pasta and I don't remember what else), so everyone was very happy with the place.  Once we had all finished, we waited a bit for our checks, and eventually the other couple said their goodbyes and got up to leave, saying they'd just pay downstairs.

My boyfriend and I made plans to come here after reading such great reviews of the place. We turned the corner and saw the owner standing outside greeting people and welcoming them into his restaurant. Actually a great tactic because a lot of people came in. It is a very small place though. Seating can only accommodate 10-12 people max. I think there was some seating available outside too.\n\nWe were seated and given menus. We weren't asked about our drink order until 10 minutes later. They only have one server, so I gave them some leeway, but then it took another 10 minutes to get our water! Eventually, the owner took over as our waiter and it was a smooth ride the rest of dinner. \n\nThe food is very delicious, but imo, not 5 star quality delicious though. My boyfriend liked his dish more than I liked mine. I can't remember the name of his, but it had sausage and broccoli rabe with tomato sauce. I got the pasta carbonara. Basically penne vodka but the sauce was just creamier. I found my dish to be too oily. The portions are also insanely small. Kind of like expensive restaurant quantity. I think they judge portions based on how you look physically, I am small, but I eat a lot of food, a lot more than most people would think. My boyfriend's dish was bigger than mine and the guy at the table next to us had the same dish as my boyfriend, but it was basically double the size! He was older and more on the heavier side. But again, just my theory, take it with a grain of salt (that's a saying right?) \n\nOverall, good food with nice atmosphere. If I'm ever in SF again, don't think I'll be coming back though.

I asked instead for the seafood risotto, but the waiter then recommended a \"seafood linguine with black sauce\"... so just a tip: they make it even if it's not rotated on the menu :D.\n\nSeafood linguine was amazing. Usually you get only a bit of seafood and a huge portion of pasta - but this was almost a 1:1 ratio. Really generous on the seafood (which was fantastic). My husband had the ravioli and I liked it, but the seafood linguini was definitely the standout of the two. \n\nOh and the BREAD and the sauce. You're hit instantly with the mouthwatering, pungent aroma of garlic when they bring out the sauce but it's addictive. We ended up drizzling it over the buffalo mozzarella that at we got (very light and fresh tasting). \n\nSad that I didn't have enough room for the Tiramisu dessert, but... next time! \n\nAmbiance notes: Waiter (or owner?) was hilarious and so charismatic.", "author": "Sylvia L."}

The server was really nice but I don't know.. he seemed a little TOO Italian.. the accent was really out there, as if he was putting on a show. The menu was strange.. it had the same sections of both sides but different dishes listed. There was no wine menu and we asked for wine, he offered us Australian cab. Um we're in an Italian restaurant.. maybe offer us something Italian? We asked for chianti, he offered us a bottle for $25  (discount he says). \n\nStarted out with the calamari.. which is not fried, and served with white beans.. I really liked it. I read about the spaghetti and meatballs but that was not on the menu. I asked for it and they made it for me! So that was nice. And it was delicious. My partner ordered the tortellini on the menu and that was also good. So yes the food was good! \n\nIt was just everythign else that was a little strange. Like the counter and kitchen faced the dining area so the cooks would be watching us if they were not cooking. A little weird. The credit card reader broke down and everyone had to pay cash (I had to walk over to an ATM). There was something amateurish about the place.

The owner, Mario, is very involved in every part of the experience and has a good amount of specials. We started with a margarita pizza - which was good but was more on bread than I expected. I got the black linguine seafood pasta which was great. A ton of seafood and the black linguine was cooked perfectly. She had ravioli which she liked.

Shame on me. \n\nThe restaurant itself is quite small and narrow, but they occupy two floors. We were seated upstairs by the window, with a view of the street below. One of my friends is fairly tall, so he had to hunch to be able to stand. Hilarious! \n\nWe decided to start the night off with some sangria, which we quickly polished off. We decided to have the meal family style because we couldn't decide what to get. The one thing we knew we had to try was the burrata cheese. The burrata cheese dish at Drago in LA is one of my favorite things, so I had high hopes for this. This came in a quite generous portion and was amazing. We got two more pasta dishes - a seafood pasta and a pesto pasta. Both were delicious. As it was my birthday, the server came up with a slice of cake and a shot of their lemon liqueur. I was pleasantly surprised, especially when the server took a shot with us. The lemon liqueur was very refreshing; it reminded me of my vacation in Italy. \n\nThe service is slow, but it forces you to enjoy your company. We tried to speed up the process to pay and leave, but the server joking told us that it was on its way. If you're looking to get in and out, this isn't the place for you. Caffe Macaroni is somewhere you go to have more than 1 glass of wine with dinner and to enjoy the night with a small group of friends.", "author": "Jenn G."}

They were at a table upstairs, the guys working there were so busy downstairs that they may have forgotten about them.\n\nTL;DR: food was decent, but the long wait, hurried service when we were actually given any, and the complete disregard for reservations (you could probably just walk up and say you have one and they would seat you without batting an eye) make this a resounding one star location for me.", "author": "Gina O."}

Yup, that's right, it's not just those 10 tables downstairs and outside. There's also an upstairs! We were seated at this counter-like table facing the windows, so we got a view of the street. It was super cramped upstairs, barely any room to even move around. And the ceiling was so low, I could practically touch it without tip-toeing (and I'm not even 5 feet tall). It was really stuffy upstairs. But I didn't mind, it's Valentine's Day and I thought it was very intimate and cozy. Although I did think it was a fire hazard being up there. If there was a fire, which would happen downstairs because the kitchen is downstairs, the people seated up stairs would probably not make it out! The stairs are so narrow and steep.\n\nAnyway, we waited awhile before someone came to take our order, but we didn't mind, we understood that it was busy due to the holiday. A few minutes after we ordered, the waiter asked if we could move one seat over. Now, this seat was at the edge of the communal counter-like table. This seat, specifically, was back to back with another seat behind (which someone on the larger side was sitting at). The waiters kept trying to convince us to move a seat over, my boyfriend tried and he could not fit, there was no leg room. So after we literally tried and showed them that my boyfriend would not fit there, they had the audacity to tell me to try to sit there because I'm a lot smaller, HOW DARE THEY! Trust me, I knew I wasn't going to fit there, I don't even know why my boyfriend even tried himself. Brownie points to him for being a good sport.\n\nSo after that whole ordeal was over, we got our food. It wasn't until our food came before we realized that we didn't even have utensils placed at our table for us. It's okay, they were busy, we understand. I had the linguine with clams. The portion was really small. I scarfed down the whole plate and was still SO hungry (like I said before, I am pretty small). The linguine was undercooked, it was still hard. The clams were bleh... I didn't like them. The best part was the bread that came with this garlic, olive oil, vinaigrette dip thing, WHICH WAS AMAZING (the dip, not the bread, I LOVE GARLIC). But they didn't give us our bread until we asked for it. They even gave bread to people who got seated after us, wtf! They also took forever to bring us water, we asked for it when we first got seated, and then asked again while waiting for our food, but we didn't get it until we were practically done eating. After we finished, we asked for the check, which took forever to come. The couple next to us saw how long we were waiting for the check and they asked for their check before they were even finished eating with their food. BUT THEY STILL GOT THERE CHECK BEFORE US. This is when I realized that the waiters were specifically being unattentive to us. Because we wouldn't move to a seat where we couldn't fit?!?! WTF WHO DOES THAT?!!?\n\nOverall, I am never coming here again. And I hope that you all have a way better experienced than I did. Only reason I'm even giving a star is for the garlic/olive oil/viniagrette.", "author": "Lina C."}

The staff, although charming were disorganized and inattentive.  We were seated upstairs which is cramped with low ceilings at the back table which, at best, should seat 3 and we were a party of 5.   We waited 20 minutes at the table before anyone spoke with us.  Specials were shouted from the stairs across 3 tables.  Didn't even hear them.   Drink orders were made.  The waiter brought our red wine unopened and there it sat for another 10 minutes before he returned with 2 glasses - we asked for 3.  more time passed....  It was finally opened and served in white wine glasses.   Water took even longer.  The late bread was stale and cold but the olive oil/garlic was ok.\n\nEntrees were mediocre.  Chicken scallopini well, wasn't even scallopini, it came in a lumpy cheesy sauce smothering an overcooked tough chicken.   Too hungry to send it back.  Seafood pasta smelled fishy.  Pizza was more bread that pizza but tasted pretty good.  The pesto was decent.\n\nOne of the most disappointing meals we've ever had in North Beach.", "author": "Steven S."}

This place is tiny as shit, the ceilings are low, and you can hear others' conversations if you're sitting upstairs.  But the food is phenomenal.  Like, don't-even-talk-to-me-when-I'm-eating phenomenal.  Eating here is like eating in Italy, fo real.\n\nAll of the dishes are simple, but fresh and made with love.  Well, I think so.  With the exception of the mussels/clams.  I had their seafood linguine and while it was unbelievably delicious, the shellfish didn't seem quite as fresh.  The noodles and sauce were all made in-house (or at least tasted that way).  Still very good, nonetheless.  And the two other dishes I tried (that I can no longer remember) were very nice as well.\n\nWe also ordered the bruschetta with burrata, which tastes like heaven and like the cow whose milk it's made from was milked a couple hours prior.  Thank you baby Jesus and miss cow.  My dinnermates had a couple of cocktails.  They said their drinks were a bit too sweet.  We finished off with tiramisu, which I dare say, is better than the tiramisu at Stella's.  Sacrilege, I know.  I'm still going to stop at Stella's every time I'm in the neighborhood though.  Anyway, I digress.  My point is--their appetizers, entrees, and desserts are good, okay?\n\nThe waitstaff is also super friendly, enthusiastic, and efficient.  I'm coming back here soon.

My cousins and I were visiting from Los Angeles and wanted an authentic Italian night and boy did we get one at this place. I'd like to thank my fellow yelpers for writing the reviews that they did because that's what let us here in the first place and I can definitely tell you I would be going back the next time I'm in San Francisco. We were celebrating my cousins birthday and we were extra lucky to be served by Micheli,  he is the heart and soul of what you would think in the Italian person to be, very warm very welcoming hilarious and absolutely there to make you feel like family. The food was incredible and so was the wine and the intimate atmosphere on top floor although it is very small that's what kind of makes it feel cozy and family oriented since we're all sitting around next to each other and every now and then you might hear someone sing Volare. I had something that was not on the menu I believe is the special and it was a pappardelle pasta, it was almost like a Bolognese but even better and very much what you would want to eat at an Italian restaurant with all the comforting ingredients. I've been to Italy and I could probably say that this pasta was probably one of the best I've eaten in a long time.  Their garlic oil for bread dipping is so yum and their calamari is more like a stew,  so if you're expecting fried  maybe not the appetizers of choice.  Micheli made our night on top of all the other good stuff about the restaurant,  it was more  memorable thanks to him and his awesome character", "author": "Izabell M."}

I've passed by the yellow sign countless times, but did not even think to stop by until my coworker urged me to try Caffe Macaroni for the legit Neapolitan cuisine. I'm no expert when it comes to Naples but I booked a table here because my bf is part Neopolitan and wanted him to get in touch with his southern Italian roots :P Fortunately he didn't mind because the food was delicious! \n\nOur dinner here was one of the best meals I've had in North Beach. There are lots of restaurants in the area that are fluff and cater to tourists... Caffe Macaroni is not one of them. Our waiter had a dry, wry, sense of humor and was so friendly. We were seated in the upstairs dining area and we chatted about our favorite Italian dishes and haunts in Rome. My bf and I shared an appetizer with mozzarella and a selection of cured meats, like proscuitto and mortadella. Combined with the warm crusty Italian bread with seasoned olive oil and garlic, this was a fantastic starter, albeit a little pricey for the quantity of food ($13). I ordered the squid ink pasta with seafood and my bf ordered a special, which consisted of thinly sliced and seasoned steak with arugula and pecorino.  As a general rule, I never EVER order pasta unless it's house made, and I have to say my squid ink pasta was phenomenal. The pasta was al dente and springy, the broth was a wine/herb/tomato/seafood mixture that begged to be mopped up by the crusty bread, and the squid, clams, and mussels and tender and flavorful, topped with a large head-on shrimp (I didn't let the brains go to waste). My bf loved his steak and said it was very flavorful, although it was missing the promised pecorino. It was light but filling and different from the usual steak he would've ordered, and allowed us to order tiramisu for dessert. Our tiramisu was a rectangle of creamy, espresso-y, chocolate-y goodness. I think there were legit coffee grounds in that thing, not just coffee mixed into the dessert. Amazing! Perfect because it delivered the caffeine we needed for a late night in the city.\n\nService was impeccable from start to finish. And the best part? Our waiter cryptically asks me if I drink alcohol. I told him not tonight, because I wanted to make sure I would be able to walk down the stairs, which were dark and steep. He promised me a small shot of housemade liqueur. I asked him what kind of liqueur and he coyly responds \"I don't know!\" as he's walking down the stairs. He returns with two shots of orangecello and takes a shot with me. It was just enough to make my cheeks warm but not enough to make me slide down the stairs on my ass. On the way out, he gives my bf and I a hug apiece.  Can a meal get any better than that? I think not!\n\nGRAZIE!!!", "author": "Bella L."}

One friend arrived a little late, we wanted to wait for her before we ordered food but felt completely hassled by the staff re: when she was going to show. Not relaxing. Then after all the hassle they kept forgetting to bring wine etc and we had to remind them of our orders. This was not the worst though - jese, the food was completely under par. My friends mussels were over cooked (vom), my pizza thing was indescribably awful (the only thing I could compare it with would be an unbelievably cheap oven pizza) & I can't speak for my other two friends as they were trying to be polite to me, but neither finished despite claiming to have been hungry before the food arrived.

The owners and waitstaff, mostly there for 15+ years, put on an unscripted amateur theater of the absurd for you and your date / family / gay lover / whatever, full of playacting, forgetting what you ordered, bringing free dishes and drinks, giving your date a kiss on the cheek speaking in Italian and the several other languages they know. Not because it's their concept or some corporate ownership requires it, I think they've just settled into this pattern for being in North Beach for the past few decades. Meanwhile, the food is pretty solid and reasonably priced. The ink squid pasta has been a constant \"special\" on the menu for the past 20+ years, always a good choice. The antipasti plate is nice. The tiramisu is kinda explosive in presentation, but delicious to eat.\n\nA word about the place -- it's grandfathered in, but basically if you're over 5'9\" best you duck your head. Seriously. The upstairs dining room has a ceiling about 6'4\", but due to some unevenness an average height American guy will bump his head.

I personally like to go with the specials, but one night I did feel like being boring and ordered a margherita pizza -- I will never order a margherita pizza again unless it's from this place. It was incredible...which I think is a true testament to the authenticity of this restaurant. Margherita pizzas only have so many ingredients and they're all pretty basic. So to be able to pull off a dish that blows the rest of the pizzas in the world out of the water, you're doing something right and you're going to get 5 stars in my book. \n\nAlso, Mario is the owner and he's just about the friendliest and most genuine guy you'll ever meet. His staff is just as amiable and provide excellent service.", "author": "David P."}

So they made it for her. She was delighted with the results.  \nJohn raved about his chicken parmigiana.  \nI found my elk risotto just ok.  I never had elk before and expected more flavor from the meat.  Tasted too much like a bland cut of beef cooked a tad too long to me.  Could've been worse.  Could've tasted like chicken:-)  I love my risotto al dente, but this was undercooked rice - and not arborio or another grain that absorbs liquid delightfully either.  The sauce was far too salty to taste any other flavors  that might have been there.  The mushrooms were thus negligible.  In a word: disappointing. I bet, though, that if I had complained, the owner who waited on us would've fixed the problem with an alternate dish quickly.\nMy glass of $8 Montepulciano was worth about $4.  The bottle sells for less than $8 at Trader Joes. \nMy espresso was just ok.\nThe cannoli was not quite forgettable -- but I wish we could forget the stale shells and bland cream with Hershey's chocolate sauce dribbled on top.\nWe all loved the spaghetti cake for dessert.  As good as it's simple mix of egg, sugar, olive oil and pasta is the owner's description.  \"What's spaghetti cake?\" asked the diners next to us.  His reply: \"That's a cake made a from a spaghetti.\"  And made well, I'd add.  He later explained that they usually make the dish from capellini, but had run out.  That would likely be the dessert to order no matter which pasta remained in the larder.\nAdorably small space plus a few tables on the sidewalk.", "author": "Scott C."}

Mine came with a good amount of fresh ricotta on top. It was filling, but not so much that we passed on dessert. We decided to split a tiramisu and I had an espresso to go with it. Damn that was good tiramisu! And the espresso was made the way it was supposed to be made. Smooth and just slightly bitter.

We thought we'd check out Caffe Macaroni-it is small and gives off the \"this is the real thing\" vibe. It was early enough that there was no line and we were seated immediately. The staff, from the servers to the owner/chef, were all accommodating to our various food requests ( limited dairy, no meat, one of us doesn't like fish, etc-we are not an easy group to feed) and they told us none of these issues would be a problem. We started with fresh burrata appetizer and a halibut appetizer that had the two fish eaters all but licking the plate. Next came some bread dish stuffed with pancetta which was adored by the meat eaters in the group-followed by our main courses that were all so delicious that the only sounds from our table was the sound of the clanking silverware accompanied by the words yummy and I want more.  The restaurant is small and if you are outgoing, bringing your neighbors into a conversation with you is fun. We shared a bite of our appetizer with our neighboring table who ended up ordering their own order of the same thing. By the end of the evening, we realized we had mutual friends with our neighboring restaurant mates and we stuffed our faces with the delicious tiramisu and the panna cotta that melted in our mouths, The chef brought us some limoncello to end the meal with. Not only did we have a truly authentic and delicious meal in this tiny but powerful restaurant, but we had a great and fun time laughing with our neighbors and talking to the chef and his wife,  people walked in and out of the restaurant- to say hi- to sit and eat- to sit and talk about what is going on in the world-& of course- to indulge in amazing food in an atmosphere that is like sitting in the kitchen of your friends home who happens to be a wonderful chef.

This was a very good but not excellent Italian restaurant. It's tiny and cramped. Upstairs has incredibly low ceilings. Quaint and cute, but if you're over 5'9\" you'll stoop. Service was confused, though sort of charmingly so--but most things in Italian are charming. Others found it less charming, and it was uncomfortable to be surrounded by two very unhappy parties.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-20", "description": "Three of us made a last minute (ie. 25 minutes out) reservation for a Saturday night dinner at Caffe Macaroni. Pleased by the high ratings on Yelp and Open Table, we figured it'll be a nice Italian spot for a chill dinner. Caffe Macaroni is teeny tiny, but has a solid offering of Italian cuisine ranging from pizza to pasta to paninis. Reservations seem to carry little merit as pretty much everyone huddled around the front door was welcomed in at random; no one asked the name on our reservation and we were seated about 20 minutes after the time. The downstairs area has maybe 4 tables and the door is open, so opt for the upstairs. Unless you're really tall, because the ceiling is just under 6 feet. The upstairs area is very cramped; I passed all the dishes to our neighboring tables as the waiters could not get through. Food is fine, simple. I had a baked cannelloni which was good but the rest of my party was not super impressed. If you don't eat pork, note that the olive oil served as an appetizer has prosciutto  in it--although it sounds like a nice touch, I'm told the flavor was just odd. Perhaps the biggest question we had about the dinner was overall cleanliness. The space is incredibly tiny and assuming the downstairs kitchen is the only one, you'll notice food is prepared next to the dishwashing station. Plates are set down willy nilly so if you worry about your glass getting too close to a bottle of Windex, you'll cringe. All in all, a good selection of dishes that'll fill you up and leave you content, but not necessarily craving a return trip.", "author": "Emilia S."}

We ended up sharing 2 appetizers, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts. All were fabulous. For appetizers we ordered the calamari and the clams and mussels. We used the bread to soak up all the amazing sauce. Entrees included shellfish over black pasta, tuna with linguine puttanesca, spaghetti with baby octopus, and buffalo with mushroom risotto. My personal favorite was the buffalo, but every dish was fantastic. For dessert we got the tiramisu and the limoncello cake. While the tiramisu was good, we could have devoured an entire limoncello cake, not just a slice. We ate in 4 other restaurants during this trip, and this place was by far the best.", "author": "Wendy H."}

It is a small restaurant with small seating areas on the 1st and 2nd floor.  I arrived with a party of 6 and we somehow squeezed into a corner of the 2nd floor.  I felt like sardines packed in a can.  Service here is friendly and the owner is the friendliest of them all.  \n\nNow, the food...I had a friend who came here before and recommended the place - he told me to just rely on whatever the owner recommended.  Unfortunately, the owner did not come to take our order and we had one of the cute, young Italian waiters take our order. I ordered the linguine di mare, which is one of my many \"go-to\" Italian pastas that I love to order in restaurants.  Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed with my pasta because I did not think the seafood (mussels and clams) were cooked properly.  The linguine was fine but the pasta was too dry and the seafood, especially the mussels, were overcooked. I suspect that they cooked the seafood separately before incorporating it into the pasta.  Also, the dish was lacking the mussel and clam broth/sauce that I usually get at other places that serve this type of pasta.  The other people at my table ordered gnocci and risotto but were not able to order the exact dishes on the menu because they ran out of some of the ingredients.  Their orders looked good but I did not get a chance to try their dishes.", "author": "Kai C."}

While we waited for 2 members of our party to find parking, which is notoriously difficult in North Beach, I politely asked the owner whether we could sit down first since it was a chilly evening and I didn't have a jacket. He had already mentioned at that point that the table was ready and he could seat us as soon as the rest of our party arrived so I thought it wouldn't be a problem. Not only did he refuse, he wouldn't even let us inside. I understand if it's your restaurant's policy to not seat guests until the full party has arrived but to force them to wait outside in the cold and refuse to offer any sort of indoor accommodation -- even if it's just a waiting area -- is appalling. I told him to just cancel our reservation as we were no longer interested in dining there. He then proceeded to chase us outside and tell us how unreasonable we were being. I don't care how good your food is -- that is an unacceptable way to treat your customers, especially coming from the owner.", "author": "Jerry L."}

It definitely won't be our last as the reviews were spot on. This is a quaint little restaurant on Columbus. It is pretty easy to find, but parking was a little bit of an issue for us - we got there around 8:45 and garages are only open until 10pm. We were finally able to find street parking without a meter. \nThe restaurant has two parts: a front room by the kitchen and an upstairs. We sat in the front room and were right next to the window which made for perfect people-watching. The menu, along with the staff, is completely authentic (they might even be a family as it seemed like the two servers were brothers). We started with a Chianti and some bread and oil for dipping. This meal was worth it just for the oil! It had garlic and peppers and parsley in it. I try not to eat the bread and save room for the rest of the meal, but this oil was too good to pass up. Then,  we had two Caesar salads that were delicious! We love a good Caesar, especially one with homemade dressing as this was. And they gave us extra anchovies on top. It was a great start to the meal. \nFor an entree I got a shellfish special: clams, mussels, calamari, and a giant prawn with a cherry tomato sauce on top of black linguine. It was great! There was tons of the seafood and just the right amount of pasta. My single complaint was that the prawn was still in the shell.  My boyfriend ordered the braised baby goat special with onions and potatoes. It was very tender, and my boyfriend had no problem cleaning his plate. Then, our meal ended with a shot of limeoncello and another half glass of wine for each of us, on the house! The service and the food just can't be beat here.", "author": "Alycia N."}

We ordered the Bufala & Caponata, a Caesar salad, Linguine di mare (Linguine pasta with mussels, clams, garlic, chili, parsley), and Gnocchi Alla Gorgonzola (Gnocchi With Gorgonzola Sauce). The antipasti was yummy, but we decided that we would probably get something else if we were to go back. The Bufala was superb so if you are a fan, definitely try. The caesar salad was honestly so incredibly good that I almost wanted to order another one so we wouldn't have to split it. Its an Italian staple and Macaroni did a phenomenal job on it. My husband's gnocchi is technically an appetizer (I believe) but when he sees gnocchi he orders it. It was incredibly rich and he wasn't able to eat barely half of it. Again, something that was very good, but we probably wouldn't order again. My liniguini was the best meal I've had in SF since we've arrived (September). At the end of my bowl, I was lapping up the sauce with bread, spoons, anything I could find. The atmosphere was perfect. My husband and I have never been to Italy, but from what our table guests next to us say, this restaurant transports you back to Italy. We had a lovely conversation with them as I'm sure everyone has great conversations in this restaurant as you are basically sitting with others. They had great Italian music playing the entire time, most of it we were able to recognize which really brought the ambiance to something that wasn't intimidating, but comfortable.
