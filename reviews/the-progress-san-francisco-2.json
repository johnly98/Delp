The menu is quite diverse both in portion side and across the creative dishes they've cultivated. I think what was a bit annoying, was that when we asked the server what he recommended, he just said pick 4-6 things off the menu and then revisit whether you want to order more...\n\nI get that it can be irritating to have people ask this question... but I expect a bit more when it's a menu that  has a lot of range. We ended up doing the 6 dishes which was wayyyy too much food.  In addition, if you had picked some dishes they were bite size... while others were multiple portions, so it's unclear why they wouldn't provide more advice to help with portion allocation.  Also, there should be some advice when it comes to what would pair nicely together...\n\nIt could just be the server, and not the practice of the Progress overall. Although, we did hear the server telling another table to just read the menu and fill in their requests themselves lol.  \n\nAll in all, the dishes were tasty and interesting.  We both prefer State Bird Provisions ambiance and dim sum style over the Progress but think it's worth going to at least once.", "author": "Melissa C."}

Considering the reservation process, service, ambiance, and the food; the meal here was probably one of the best culinary experiences I've had in a while. \n\nReservations:\nThe booking experience was pretty simple and fast. Reservations are accepted through OpenTable (get those dining points!)\n\nService:\nI wish I had taken the name down of our server! She was attentive (but not overly so), prompt, and nice. She gladly provided recommendations when asked. Throughout the dinner, I could tell that she was watching from afar to make sure that all of our requests were handled quickly. \n\nAmbiance: \nI really enjoyed the more casual vibe of the restaurant. There were some guests that were dressed business casual and others dressed casual. We dressed smart casual and we fit in just fine. The noise in the restaurant was very mild considering we went during peak dinner time. \n\nFood/Drinks: \n+ sunny jim - gin, lemon, vanilla, pineapple, kaffir lime leaf, soda\n+ summer fling - farm herb vodka, yellow chartreuse, velvet falernum, lime\n+ CA sturgeon caviar potato cloud\n+ heirloom tomatoes, fiscalini cheddar, almond romesco\n+ caramelized onion BBQ'd potatoes, chanterelles, poached egg, sea beans\n+ squid ink noodles, oyster mushrooms, kale, bonito flakes\n+ bone-in ribeye, aged garlic barley misozuke\n+ buckwheat doughnuts, apple compote, cantaloupe sherbet\n\nFor a drink, I would highly recommend getting the sunny jim as it was super refreshing. All of the dishes we ordered including the dessert were amazing. I would highly recommend ordering each and every one of the dishes listed. For two people, the amount of food was a little too much but we wanted to try as many dishes as we could. Overall, I am really impressed with this one Michelin-starred establishment and I could definitely see myself back in the future!", "author": "Joanne Y."}

In my opinion I think it's hard for restaurants to make a simple ingredients exciting, but The Progress managed to elevate everything it touched to the next level. For my bday we ordered the following: \n\nHeirloom Tomatoes--I usually have a, \"Don't order veggies at nice restaurants.\" policy. But after having these heirloom babies, I would gladly order them again and again. Probably because these were uber fresh, served with cheddar and romesco. (This is me salivating.) \n\nLamb Tartare--This was the only dish I would not order again. I'd never had lamb tartare before, so I thought I would take the plunge. \"Why not? It's my birthday!\"I thought, And plunge I did. Raw lamb served with yogurt and crackers? Sounded good, but the lamb didn't have quite enough flavor. So no flavor, raw lamb, and a little chewy. Overall, a no bueno. \n\nBraised Pork--The pork had a nice flavor kick from the jalapeno and the pork was soft to the touch of a fork. Talk about food porn. \n\nBBQed Potatoes--Speaking of food porn. These potatoes are not only BBQ flavored but have a poached egg on top. Thus proving the age-old question that adding a poached egg to a meal really does make everything taste better. \n\nBiscuits with foie gras mousse--So good, my boyfriend got an order to go. (Fun fact, they only take 8 minutes to cook!) Think about this. A restaurant in San Francisco finally figures out how to make an authentic Southern-style, flaky biscuit. The flakiest buttered biscuit you've ever had, and then add foie gras. I died and went to heaven. And then died again, because we ate the to-go order of biscuits for breakfast the next day.  \n\nOverall, the service was attentive, the vibe was casual and the food was amazing. They even gave me a free dessert for my birthday! It's not the cheapest place in the city, but an amazing choice if you're celebrating anything or just want to live large for a meal.", "author": "Liz S."}

I have always had beyond amazing meals here so I was a little worried that it would no longer hold the special place in my heart it always has, but boy was I wrong. \n\nCame here for my \"family\" birthday dinner, and given my overly simple picky father and overly foodie review reading mother, I knew this would be a risk. That being said once we navigated the menu (most at the table felt it was confusing on how many of each section to get etc) we all had a great dinner. \n\nStand outs were def the squid ink pasta and duck, but everything was phenomenal. I also loved the lamb tartare. Honestly you can't go wrong here. \n\nWe also had the grilled squid which was great.. but not before my father adamantly insisted he didn't like squid (says the person who regularly orders calamari both fried and grilled). I am telling you I almost lost it. The progress is great, but it is bougie and as I mentioned above the menu is not the most approachable for those not familiar with this sort of thing.. again, I know I was taking a risk bringing the fam here. The only negative I would say is that everything was very rich. That could have been a symptom of our ordering though/ not including enough vege to balance it out. \n\nTake away, the progress is regularly overlooked for its big sister State Bird, but 10/10 would return and it is always at the top of my list when planning a nice dinner out. \n\nLast notes: corkage is $30 ea for the first two bottles, then jumps to $60. Phenomenal cocktails though, so def make sure to get one! Finally there's supposedly a hotdog on the bar menu which I have yet to try, so a casual trip to the bar might need to be in my near future given my very real hotdog obsession ;)", "author": "Adele T."}

Wow, our dinner combination was excellent.  We started with cocktails, I ha d the Bad neighbor, one of the best cocktails I have had, my husband had the Manhattan, good but not the best.  We accompanied the cocktails with the caviar, foamed potato chips, good but small, not big on foam.  \n\nOur next courses accompanied by wines by the glass, were the charred green beans and plums with a tahini spread, the best veggie combo ever.  The anchovies dish came with shaved radish and cucumber and a dab of creme fraiche, delicious.  My favorite dish of the night was the squid, so tender, a must.  The ravioli dish was excellent as well.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant.  The food is over the top delicious.  Service is excellent and the atmosphere fun.  My only complaint, although a great glass of wine, like all SF restaurants these days, wines by the glass are expensive.  My Chardonnay was really good but $18 seems steep.", "author": "Carole W."}

Inviting and warm. \n\nThe food is exceptionally memorable. \n\nMy favorite was the octopus ink noodle dish and the rabbit. However, honestly, all of the dishes were impeccable in their own way. The squid dish was a little spicy and lightly creamy, but so well balanced! They make everyone to order and you can see the chefs working if you want to. Also, they bring out the dishes as they're ready, and then they bring out the main dish last! It's perfect! You don't get too stuffed, it's juuust right; for example, our party of 4 ordered 5 smaller dishes and then the large rabbit dish to end. We were all perfectly full. \n\nThe menus change daily. Be prepare to be blown away by the service, the food, the overall experience. Even the bathrooms are sparklingly fun! They have different colored tissue paper covered toilet paper rolls, and the walls are sparklingly pink! \n\nOh, and our friendly waitress was very knowledgeable about the ingredients and food. She even gave us the peanut milk(it was smooth, silky, balanced, delishhhh) for a birthday we were there to celebrate! \n\nIt's a great end to the meal, because it's slightly sweet, but a sweet end on your palate! \n\nSome tips: you can reserve a seating area: I would recommend the second level seating areas.

It's innovative, with different elements of asian, Italian, Californian, and French cuisines mixed in. I like the food even better than Rich Table, and better than Statebird provision next door for ambience and Lighting. \n\nService: 2 stars. \nwhen we came here the first time, the restaurant just opened and we ate in the main dining room, served with set menu. And we liked our waiter. \n\nThe second time, we sat in the bar area and the service was horrible. The Maitre D Shamus was super short with us, immediately turning around after responding to our first question on the menu. He served the wrong sparkling / still water option to some of us, served sparkling water to only me even though my friend ordered the sparkling water. And then without checking what each person had in their water glass, he poured flat water into my friend's glass with sparkling water. When we told him, there was no apology, and just a \"oh\" and turned around. We loved the sturgeon so much that we ordered a second one. Instead of delighting in my friend's decision, he gave me a look like \"really you want another one\"? \n\nThe dishes came out way too fast. Right when we finished one, the other one will immediately follow. There doesn't seem to be any pacing or the pacing was \"speed through and churn\". We were really surprised that the level of service was this poor at an one-Michelin star restaurant, especially from the Maitre D.\n\nSo if you really want a fantastic experience for a special occasion, I would recommend reserving in the main dining room. \n\nOK onto the food.\n\nMUST GET:\nCA sturgeon caviar potato cloud - fantastic. Reminded me a spin on Boeuf Hache in the French cuisine, except the potato is much fluffier, the beef substituted with caviar, and infused with crunchy tempura bits.  The result was fantastic. The caviar is not overwhelmingly salty. The combination of textures was ingenious. \n\nStewed artichokes with fava beans, peas, fried butter beans. The artichokes were flavorful. The fava beans a bit nutty. The butter beans were crunchy. The ingredients were amazing for this dish and the sauce that united them blended well with the juice from each vegetable to create this delightful summer medley. Fabulous. \n\nSOLID:\nSquid ink noodles with oyster mushroom, kale, and bonito flakes. Even though the Maitre d said that this dish tastes a bit fishy for him, we thought the the dish wasn't that fishy but perfectly balanced. The noodles could have been a bit more al dente. \n\nCoal roasted mushrooms. Nice medley and solid. Didn't love the hollandaise sauce on this but the mushrooms were great. \n\nSKIP: \nSchnitzel - huge portion. We shared it between four of us. Even though the veal was tender, not anything to rave about - one can order this elsewhere. Only order this if you really like fried foods.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

We live just a couple blocks away, and after walking over, were ushered in, past the line, to a nice corner booth. \n\nThe ambiance is fun, classy without being pretentious, warm and inviting. Pretty quickly we were greeted by our charming waitress who, while obviously busy working lots of tables, made sure to stop and chat with us, explain the menu and answer any questions we had. \n\nWe started with the baby fava bean tempura with some sort of delicious green sauce. The tempura was thick and crispy, a little doughy towards the center and nice and buttery. \n\nWe moved on to the \"SF Bay boquerones\" which our waitress explained are fresh anchovies, layered atop a dollop of creme fraiche, covered in lime-marinated cucumber shavings and cilantro blossoms. This was one of my favorites of the night. I can never get enough of fresh seafood, especially the kind that makes you feel like you're eating the ocean, and this totally evoked that. After asking our waitress about this, she let us know that they are one of the only places that sells this in SF and the anchovies are caught daily by a guy named Eric. I can only assume that it's one of those guys you see at 6am fishing off the piers, and I am totally down with that.\n\nNext we split the squid ink noodles with oyster mushrooms and bonito flakes. I audibly moaned when I took my first bite. I am a huge fan of squid and squid ink pastas and this one was just delicious and decadent. The mushrooms complimented it better than I expected and the flakes of bonito fish made it nice and salty.\n\nAt that point we were starting to get full but we were so enthralled with this epic meal that we decided to go for it and ordered the platter of duck. This is a half of a duck encircling a mound of wild rice with chili vinegar, Thai basil and crushed spicy peanuts. When this insanely beautiful platter landed in front of us, the table next to us literally told the waitress \"We'll have what they're having!\" Now I'm not a religious man, but Jesus Christ, this was one of the most amazingly rich and mouth watering cuts of meat I've ever eaten. The wing and drumstick that accompanied the slices fell right off the bone and the crispy skin was just crunchy enough to add that welcomed texture to the meat. \n\nAt this point we were tapped out and not sure we were going for desert but being my 30th birthday I figured we had to. We ordered the lemon sugar doughnut holes with white chocolate thyme ice cream and blueberry compote. This review is getting long, so I'll just say this - when we each took our first bite we literally just started laughing; laughing at the absurdity of of how insanely tasty the thing we were eating was. I legitimately felt like I was in food heaven. \n\nIf it sounds like I'm hyping this place up a lot, it's because I am. My girlfriend and I love trying new restaurants for our date nights and this one blew us out of the water. The waitress told us its \"Italian/Japanese fusion\" so I'm not surprised that mixing two of the best cuisines on earth worked out well for them.

Just about every item was an overseasoned salad, with a rando charred ingredient and some cream-colored sauce underneath. We were in tomato season, but did not need the same sliced tomatoes \"featured\" on every dish.\n\nThe Progress joins a number of other San Francisco restaurants in serving McFarland Springs farm-raised trout, but at a fine dining price point. Sure the politics of aquaculture are terrific, but the product just does not belong in fine dining, yet.

So good. I honestly contemplated ordering a second...)\n\n - Black Cod \n(deliciously flavored, but my 'not-so \n-closet' fat ass was still hungry. Whoops )\n\n- Roti w/quail eggs and greens. \n(Loved this so much. Perfect to eat any way you choose, filling, unique, and I would definitely order it again.)\n\nHad the 'Bad Neighbor' as a cocktail, and almost regretted it - had to stop myself from ordering more. \n\nNot only was the food great, (and I'm admittedly a tough critic, being in the service industry for 10+ years) and I would say without a doubt it was one of the best meals I've had in a while. \n\nCan't wait to bring my roommate and come back!", "author": "Tiba G."}

You'll willingly do it here at the Progress. \n\nThe avocado wedge salad with lettuce hearts, toasted chopped almonds and seeds, drizzled with a kasu-pumpkin jalape\u00f1o Caesar style dressing was simply to DIE for. Imagine me, hardcore campaigner for all things MMMeat, endorsing you to eat salad. Do not shy away from a plate full of lettuce and avocado -- it turned out to be the best dish I've had here! Another memorable vegetarian entree was the wood grilled potatoes and shiitake mushrooms, with nori salsa verde and yellow bean tempura drizzled with aged barley miso aioli. \n\nMeat and seafood dishes are seamlessly incorporated with powerhouse veggies like sprouted beans, hearts of palm, ramps, etc. These let the primary ingredients stand out: a fresh Halibut ceviche, smothered pork chop, king salmon tataki or steamed black cod. \n\nLet's not forget their cocktail program which is a standout. I like their Mercury in Retrograde ($13) a brown spirit based cocktail which has fall written all over it, thanks to the allspice. Or go the classic route and order a Vesper, its always cold and packs a punch, so you'd only need one (or two? who am I kidding?) Either way, you should happily skip the wines here and definitely give their craft cocktails a try. \n\nThe Progress was known for their set menus, charging $65 per person for 4 dishes, meant to be shared. On top of this, you were given a set of 3 \"tastes\" from the kitchen. I liked the previous format since I love sampling different dishes at a time and I felt the portions were big enough for sharing. Recently, they've changed their pricing option and now charge per dish, which ranges $14 - $40. Either way, expect to spend about at least $50 per person without drinks. \n\nOur different visits at the Progress (spring and fall) prove this restaurant can showcase both seasons with graceful ease. The flawless use of vegetables is especially elevated. That one Michelin star awarded to The Progress for 2017? was a long time coming.", "author": "Janice C."}

I really wanted to like this place a lot the second time I came back here. We had a large party (30 people occupying the entire second floor) the first time I was here and the foods were pretty good and their gnocchi was exceptional from my sweet memories of this place. Thus I wanted to come back the second time to give it another try. \n\nThe atmosphere was very good and the restaurant was not too loud. The services were pretty attentive as expected. So really why the three stars only? \n\nThe above was secondary to foods quality and taste as my rating was more on the taste and quality side. Our waiter recommended 3-4 dishes per person and so we did that but it was a bit too much foods for us. The portions were smaller than other similar-grade restaurants. Overall food taste and quality is average, comparing to other similar restaurants in the same class. \n\nOur table had the following: \n\nBuffalo style beef sweetbread $14: they were just okay. Nothing really good about this app. \n\nJapanese salad $18: falls below my expectation for an expensive salad\n\nRed squash chop chop salad $16 : this one was pretty GOOD and I did enjoy every bite. \n\nBurrata $16: was pretty good\n\nBarley miso bbq sun chokes: $15 average \n\nChickpea dumplings: $17 it was just okay. Too try on the dumpling skin and lack of good flavor. \n\nHam and cheese roti: $18 this one is a disappointment! The salad on top of the roti killed it and the sauce was not that great. \n\nSeated local back cod: $32 this one is DELICIOUS finally to have an entree that was full of flavor. Soft and very tender fish met with crispy skin and seasonings on top of the skin made this dish a success. The sauce was a good compliment.  \n\nChicken, duck and quail polpette: $28 for a total disappointment. It came with 4-5 ish small meatballs (polpette is meatball for a fancier name) and they lack of flavor and rough. The mushroom was good but we didn't pay $28 for some pieces of mushroom. Too small of a portion. \n\nWhen foods are on the expensive side which is what people already expected before coming to dinner so I am totally fine with the bill. However, what's not cool is that the price you pay doesn't reflect the taste and quality I am expecting. I did find some dishes were delicious but too many of them fell below expectation. Restaurants like this should have a fairly consistent quality and taste across the menu (not just better at some, then not so good at others).", "author": "Lena H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-11", "description": "We visited The Progress with the family. DH and I have been to neighboring restaurant State Bird Provisions, so we were looking forward to it. The decor is modern rustic, like walking into a Crate and Barrel catalog. Street parking wasn't too bad on a Sunday evening. Music is fun, upbeat. The restaurant was very loud due to the acoustics. It's not easy to have a conversation here.\n\nOrdering here is, um, interesting. The menu has bubbles next to each item and you're supposed to fill it in with a pencil. I think they're shooting for nostalgia value in taking an exam 1980's-1990's style, but I'm sure it will bring flashbacks for some. ;) The 3 dishes in the center of the menu were larger, meat-based mains, meant to be shared. The side dishes and veggies had to be ordered separately.\n\nDH and mom didn't get drinks. I got a Bundaburg ginger beer for $5, which was the perfect splurge. Dad got a glass of wine. We each tried a Hog Island oyster ($3.50 each), which was as perfect as an oyster could be, with a touch of seaweed and yuzu.\n\nThe Japanese salad ($18) came out first. Heart of palm, trout roe, local seaweed, aged tamari. It was really tiny, but gorgeously plated. Each person got about 3 tablespoons of salad. Basically some roe with a handful of microgreens over it. We were slightly alarmed, then decided to order one more dish. Seriously, would it break the bank to add a little more lettuce? It was good, loved the microgreens, but a tad salty with the roe and tamari. I feel like it's missing something to round out the flavor and absorb all that sodium.\n\nNext was the squid ink pasta ($18) with chanterelle and cauliflower mushrooms, kale and bonito flakes. The noodles were chewy and had a buttery aroma. It worked well with the sauce. DH didn't toss the noodles in the sauce before doling out the portions, so it got super salty near the bottom. This was a pretty small portion too.\n\nThe chickpea & pecorino fritters ($17) with caramelized onions and Jimmy Nardello peppers. This was the best dish of the evening, recommended highly by our server. The peppers were not spicy. The savory and tangy sauce paired with the soft fritters worked perfectly. I could gobble down a whole plate by myself!\n\nThe grilled barley miso sunchokes ($15) were okay as a side starch, but nothing to write home about. They were tender and slightly smoky.\n\nThe rabbit prepared 3 ways with shishito peppers and fennel ($52) was one of the better rabbit dishes that I've tried. Rabbit isn't one of my faves, since I always think of it as \"mushy bland chicken\". They did a pretty good job with two of the 3 ways. The one with a super savory sauce gave it a solid umami punch. The one with the bacon wrap...well, what do I need to say? It's baconlicious! The \"ribs\" were generously seasoned, although a tad undercooked in some parts. DH likes his stuff very rare, but even he shunned some pieces for being under done.\n\nThe duck platter ($60) had half a good sized duck on it. Leg and wing were confit and quite tasty. The breast pieces seemed a bit underdone and chewy in the middle. DH thought it was okay, but could have used a little more cook time. The \"fried rice\" had the rind on it, which is the harder part on the bottom of the pot. It's supposed to be tastier. DH did not like this extra texture. It wasn't that hard, but a surprise. The flavors were Thai inspired with fresh basil and chili peanuts.\n\nWe didn't get dessert because we were running late to a concert. \n\nOverall, technical skill wasn't as good as State Bird Provisions. Some stuff oversalted, some stuff undercooked. Also seems pricey for the quantity of food. Service was excellent. The family really enjoyed the waiter and his recommendations were spot on. DH says this place is easier to get into than State Birds and there is a reason for this.", "author": "Kari C."}

We decided to grab a few drinks and an appetizer prior to our reservation next door with State Bird Provisions. \n\nThe staff (hostesses and mixologist), were so relaxed, friendly and oh so, kind. The place is quite upscale, so we expected an air of pretentiousness, but that wasn't the case. \n\nTo start, we ordered two cocktails: \"The Relief.\" The beverage contained pineapple, rum, apricot, yuzu, orange, and ginger beer. It arrived so beautifully (see pictures). We were surprised with the listed price of $13 per cocktail. Impressive to boot, is that all proceeds of the cocktails were going to be donated to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts by The Progress and SF Dining Collective. When I read that, I would have paid $20 for one cocktail (nicely done, Progress). \n\nNext, we ordered the melon and goat cheese with serrano chiles, pipitas and muscatel vinegar salad to pair with our cocktails. Again, beautifully prepared, light, airy and delicious! Each bite was a delightful surprise. I'd also like to personally thank the host for saving my phone.

Solid food with tapas options in 4 curated categories from meat to sea to veggies.  They also offer large entrees that are easily 2 person servings.  We had 4 tapas and some wine and were well enough full.  We began with the charred summer beans.  Really nice dish that had fresh beans of all sorts in a nice tangy sauce.  Colorful and fresh.We then had the salmon tataki.  Super raw salmon but extremely mushy and tasty.  Very solid dish and maybe the best of the night.  We also had the ricotta ravioli and the squid.  Ricotta was smooth and featured a fantastic touch on the tongue. The squid was a little too hard and chewy for my liking and didn't add much variety to a typical squid.  Overall, Progress was very good but dishes were small and taste not life-changing.  Service was pushy at times but fine otherwise.

The squash salad was also a great balance of flavors and textures - slightly sweet pomegranate seeds, buttery smooth roasted squash, smoky pieces of Spanish ham, and generously sprinkled chunks of stinky pecorino cheese, finished with a tangy drizzle of balsamic vinegar. I dream of that. \n\nThings that were mediocre: the persimmon toast thing (rather bland), the kimchi pork pierogi (couldn't taste the kimchi at all and the porky was not very juicy). The warm apple cake was decent but was probably the strong point of their not-very-great dessert menu.\n\nThe only big issue that came up for us was that our server was super pushy, and encouraged us (party of 2) to add another 2 small plates to our order. We weren't convinced as we were not that hungry, so we pushed back and said we didn't think we needed it. He continued being aggressive about it so we just agreed and chose some dishes randomly (the persimmon toast and pierogi).\n\nWe ended up with more food than we needed, and the dishes we didn't like as much were the ones we were pushed to order randomly!! I'm not a huge fan of when restaurants are aggressive like this - I understand and appreciate that they try to recommend a good portion size for us, but it should feel more like a recommendation and not some sort of emotional blackmail lol. :'(", "author": "Anna C."}

But having to wait for an hour at State Bird on a Monday night, I figured I would maximize my experience and eat at Progress. \n\nThe hostess/waitress was quite attentive, even for working the door. There was a point where three different people came up to me to say the salmon is taking longer than normal. I was impressed by the dedication by their staff to keep me updated and happy. \n\nThe smoked raw tuna is so wonderful! One of the few meals where I was eating really quickly, then slowly Savored every bite of tuna. The amount of smoke is just right: not overpowering my mouth or the composition. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside as I'm tasting it. The winter radishes give it a earthy, yet flower like texture. The pine nuts were simple, yet outstanding to the flavor. They taste like they picked them fresh from outside. The charred jalape\u00f1o buttermilk dressing was delicious! They put just enough to compliment the meal, while still teasing me for more. Close to the end, I was scooping up every stray pine nut and remaining residue of buttermilk dressing. A fantastic, delicate meal that's light yet has all the grace and zen of a Japanese garden. \n\nThe ravioli tasted like nothing I had ever had before. The flavor profile was earthy, yet had a cheesy, slightly sweet taste, with a hint of bitter tart in the backdrop. Everything was so well mannered and composed, from the starches of the noodle down to the apple cider Saba. I was expecting the cheese to do most of the work, but I was wrong. The entire composition has such an modern elegance, while possessing old time feel. I see visions of the Roman Senate having this meal during an eloquent dinner. It's a pretty small dish so Id recommend trying it out.\n\nI want to go back here sooner than later to have a proper 5 course meal. This place may be outshined by State Bird in popularity, but by no means should this place be ignored.

This place is just ridiculous. We paid $100 and left hungry. We went to J town and had a bowl of ramen after. \n\nOyster- $3.5 for a tiny piece of oyster that is seriously lacking favor. They added a piece of seaweed to enhance the favor but the seaweed dominate the entire flavor profile. \n\nWinter Citrus salad- they literally put 4 pieces of lettuce leaves, less than half of a citrus, some cheese shavings. Nothing special, but it was $15. I was infuriated with this lack of creativity, overpriced dish \n\nRicotta Ravioli- the pasta freshly made. Good texture. Flavor was ok. Again, 5 pieces of 2 square inch ravioli cost $17\n\nMushroom and short rib- this is the more reasonably priced dish.

We paid $400 but we left Michael Mina feeling satisfied and happy. Today we left the Progress feeling hungry and angry.

If you didn't know, The Progress is owned by the same folks who run SBP literally next door. Similar to SBP, they have a unique way they serve their product--at about $65 per person, they basically just add more to the plate and serve it family style (so if there's 3 of you, they'll just portion 3 servings). Simple enough, but honestly the price point just isn't there. I think they're really banking off the hype/prestige of SBP and the general SF food scene.\n\nDespite all this, the food is tasty, the drinks are well-crafted, and service is impeccable.

Worth checking out but not some place I would want to come back to again and again.\n\nHubby booked reservations for us to have dinner here to celebrate our anniversary. When we arrived, we were promptly seated and were wished happy anniversary by the hostess, manager and maitre'd. Such a warm welcome. \n\nOnce we sat down, our server brought us waters and explained the menu and how the meals are served family style after you choose 4 items from the daily menu items. We added an order of their roti in addition to the 4 items because our server mentioned that is what they are known for. Meal started with some appetizers consisting of fresh radishes, beer bread and the most delicious slices of roast beef. We ordered the lamb carpaccio, beef and marrow dumplings, grilled abalone and morel mushroom cavatelli. \n\nFirst came the roti topped with 6 runny quail eggs, salmon roe, and pickled cucumbers on top of a giant crispy roti. Presentation was awesome but dish lacked flavor. Could probably use just a dash of sea salt sprinkled on top since only saltiness was from the roe. Lamb carpaccio came with chunks of pickled fennel and fluffy potato fried bread--this was was my favorite because the spicy aoli was really tasty and made the dish pop. Beef and marrow dumplings came in a brown butter sauce with a mix of mushrooms--this was tasty but not something I'd order again. Next up was grilled abalone and brocollini--the brocollini was the star of this dish which means the abalone just wasn't that memorable. Last was the morel cavatelli--pasta was fresh and there were a ton of morels but sauce just tasted like watered down gravy and really didn't have much flavor or spice. \n\nFor dessert, we got the ice cream duo and a dark chocolate mousse with hay cream and fresh strawberries. Ice cream was a big disappointment--bland and I didn't taste yuzu or matcha. The dark chocolate mousse was absolutely divine and I could have it every night. \n\nParking was whatever you could find on the street which isn't always easy in this neighborhood. I would have been happier if they valet cars for a small charge since they own State Bird Provisions right next door too. If I'm spending close to $300 on dinner, I think it only makes sense for the restaurant to help make parking easier. \n\nOverall, meal was decent and food was unique in that there are a lot of original flavors and ideas such as dessert with hay cream which is literally hay steeped in cream to infuse the hay flavor. However, if you take away the novelty, this turned out to be a 3 star meal with very well cooked but not especially tasty food that was beautifully plated but lacked that extra something that would make me want to come back again.

It met all the hype and our expectations, and then some. Here, you'll get family-style dining in a venue that either once housed \"The Progress Theatre,\" or is based on it. Indeed, inside you'll be welcomed to stone walls, high ceilings, and a boisterous ambience.\n\nBut it's the food that revs up the volume several notches. When we dined, we chose six items from a large menu of offerings. While you now choose four, you can add more dishes at extra cost. And what creative offerings these were. After a shared course of six small, but tasty, starters, we started with the shaved cauliflower herbs and pig fries, which was a delicious way to pair something meaty with lots of greens as the base. Next, the tomato curry roti was yummy and ever-so-slightly crisp while remaining chewy; ricotta and fava hummus provided a novel spread in which to dip the roti. Then, a dish of grilled Sicilian artichokes with quinoa and shaved pig's head was yet another creative combination of savory meats with succulent greens.\n\nWe moved on to a \"treasure chest\" of fermented sausage, trout quenelles, and pumpkin-rice dumpling in a creamy pork broth - a hearty yet refreshing dish. Next, some savory, rich lamb merguez was complemented well by yellow eye beans, octopus, and crispy squid. Finally, polpettes of rabbit and pork, which came with bits of blood orange and castelvetranos, was another satisfyingly meaty dish. A dessert of elderflower floating island, rhubarb sorbet, and Arnold Palmer gelee was a soothing, not overpoweringly sweet way to balance out what was quite a hearty, rich meal. \n\nThe service was casual and very explanatory, and the overall experience was absolutely energizing. We all remarked at the end about how lucky we were to live in an area with such amazing creativity and innovation in all walks of life, particularly in its food. A fitting way to mark my 1500th review here on Yelp!", "author": "Vincent L."}

This place isn't too \"stuffy\" and is therefore perfect for the young professional. We got the buratta with chanterelles and the depth of flavors was on point - by far my favorite. The trout caviar, squid ink pasta, and duck platter were all unique and made us want to order everything on the menu. This would have been our favorite Michelin. We even had amazing dinner neighbors. I also loved that the waiters were each tasked to pace our dishes and didn't enter the order until it was needed. Food timing and service optimization fascinate me because it can be so difficult to get right. Kudos on that.\n\nOne thing I expect at a high-end restaurant is great service. Throughout dinner, service was efficient, but not super personable. I'm cool with that. When we got to the dessert portion and three of the options looked awesome. I LOVE dessert. I asked about the pastry because I didn't want it to be too bread-y, as the meal was filling enough. My question focused on the carb to other ingredient ratio and got a very judgmentally-charged and annoyed response back. The waiter and his tone insinuated that the boyfriend and I just had a full meal and we shouldn't be worried about eating another carb-y dessert. However, that wasn't the intention of my question. This response wasn't helpful and I proceeded to look at Yelp pictures instead.\n\nA ~minute later, Benjamin came back to ask if we had decided and told us that he needed the table back at some point (insert attitude in his tone). I had just pulled up the Yelp pictures at that moment and could not find pictures of any relevant dessert.\n\nThe 3rd time, in under ten minutes - maybe five, Benjamin offered to move us to the bar. It was about 9pm and we had been seated for almost the same amount of time as a party of four next to us. Plus, we were at the end of our meal and they were not. At this point, our neighbor even leaned over and commented on Benjamin's remark, and we proceeded to bond over his level of rudeness.\n\nAfter we ordered dessert, service was noticeably curt with a ton of tension from that point onward.\n\nThe end.", "author": "Christina L."}

They offer a family-style menu where everyone in the party has to choose the same 4 dishes for $62/person, dessert is not included. You can also add more dishes \u00e0 la carte. 1 Michelin star as of this review.\n\nI started off with a cocktail while my husband had a beer. I opted for The Remedy with mezcal, smoked ginger, honey, lemon and jalapeno. I'm into spicy drinks and I asked my server to have the bartender make it extra spicy, and it still wasn't spicy enough. The smoky flavors was definitely masking the heat. Nonetheless, I liked it. My husband had Apricot Sour Ale (a sour beer) which was totally up my alley! I took a sip and loved it. \n\nBefore the 4 selections, they do serve 3 small dishes for the table. That night we had the Pixie Mandarin, Red Beet and Pickled Squid, all of which cleansed and opend our palettes for the rest of the meals for the night.\n\nRaw Hamachi, Tuna-Citrus Salad served with with smoked olive vinaigrette, fennel, tepary beans - Hamachi is one of my favorite types of sashimi so I couldn't pass this one up as a starter. Colorful, refreshing and tasty. \n\nLamb Tartare with sesame tahini-spicy chili oil, bronze fennel, and potato fry bread - I've never head lamb tartare so that was a first. It was a bit chewy and tendony compared to beef tartare. I enjoyed it a lot with the potato fry bread. Another colorful dish!\n\nGrilled Monterey Bay Abalone with mendocio nori-anchovy \"bagna cauda\" - Abalone is hard to cook, I know because I'm Asian and my family loves abalone and sometimes they end up being tasteless and tuff like rubber. The abalone here was soft and chewy, easy to swallow and retained a lot of its natural flavors. \n\nApplewood Smoked Squab with gingered sweet potato, smoked chili vinegar and spicy peanuts - They left the claws on the squab which may freak some people out if they're not used to eating chicken feet like I am. It was tender and flavorful. I dig it.\n\nThe deserts were okay, they were $10 a pop. I never share dessert so I ordered a the Milk Chocolate \"mont blac\" with caramelized puff pastry, sweet adzuki, and coconut cream. It was good, but my mind wasn't blown. My husband had the Poppy Seed Angel Cake with white chocolate sesame, rose petal cream, and kiwi. He digged it.\n\nOverall, great service, the food was good.

Lots of light, plants, high ceilings, and wood finishes. Gorgeous. I also love the paper menus and pencils to check off your desired dishes -- fun. \n\nWhen it came time to order drinks, friend got the martini (voted best in the nation in 2017, woo!) and I chose a nebbiolo from the wine list. Both were excellent. \n\nWe also chose to split the pork & kimchi pierogi and the head-on prawn platter with potatoes. I've been on a serious dim sum kick lately, and the pierogi reminded me of a cross between a pork dumpling and a true potato pierogi -- all the flavor of a pork dumpling, with an amazing, potato-y exterior. I could've happily ordered another plate of them and foregone the prawns.\n\nI'm glad I didn't though, because the prawns and potatoes were equally incredible. The prawns were HUGE (like, slightly intimidating to dismantle) but incredibly succulent, almost like rock lobster.

First Benu, then Wako, and now The Progress.\n\nI was initially VERY excited to try The Progress after learning it is the sister restaurant to State Bird Provisions. So when I saw there were openings available on their website the weekend of Mike C.'s birthday, I grabbed one for Friday night at 7:45pm.\n\nWe arrived a few minutes early, but had to wait 10 minutes for our table because they were running behind schedule. No problem -- we went to the bar and got drinks. The restaurant has a casual vibe and I saw that there were just as many groups having dinner as there were couples. Once seated at the table, we ordered the following...\n\nFrom the Western Additions section:\n+ Hog Island Sweetwater oysters (5/5)\n+ CA sturgeon caviar potato cloud (4/5)\n+ Some kind of fish n chips reinterpretation (2/5)\n\nFrom the main menu ($62/pp for four shared courses):\n+ Raw hamachi, tuna-citrus salad (4/5)\n+ Spiced beef & marrow dumplings (4/5)\n+ Gulf shrimp-pumpkin kimchi (3/5)\n+ Black trumpet mushroom-duck broth (2/5)\n+ Seared steelhead (2/5)\n+ Grilled squab (5/5)\n\nFor dessert:\n+ Warm banana cake (5/5; this was presented to us as Mike's birthday dessert)\n\nAside from the oysters and the grilled squab, there weren't really any stand-out dishes, which is kind of sad considering we ordered a LOT more than most parties of 2 would. There were still some solid dishes though, so the 2-star review isn't wholly due to the food.\n\nThe service. Oh, the service. It actually started off wonderfully -- our server was kind, attentive, and came by at all of the right times to ask how we were doing and clear our plates. However, once the table next to us became occupied by a more mature couple, our server started to ignore us and cater to their every need... yep. Our drinks would need refills and our table would be crowded with finished dishes, but she was nowhere to be found.\n\nIn the end, we had to ask a different server for our check because we had a show to catch at Punch Line Comedy Club. They rushed out the birthday dessert, which we quickly devoured, and when our server returned with our check, she wished Mike happy birthday for the first time.

Yes, it was definitely a little pricey, but for the portions we got, the service we received, and ambiance of our table, I would say that I would definitely come back. We reserved The Balcony for one of their two nightly reservation slots (6:00PM or 8:30PM) and were seated at around 8 because the previous party was already gone. The Balcony, by the way, perches over the kitchen and provides a birds-eye view of all the action, and it's away from the hustle and bustle loudness of the ground floor. It's a great place for group meal (6-10 people), and the restaurant does an excellent job of accommodating for food allergies and preferences.\n\nAnd, the food? Superb. They started off with an amazing spread of butter beer bread, pickled tempura carrots, house chips with a roe dip, and then things got even better. Their take on a spicy tuna sashimi salad was delectable, and the brussel sprout leaves on the cod made for an excellent textural interplay (the cod itself was perfectly flaky). At the main meat entree, we had some tender pork, which I could not get enough of. The dessert capped the meal off well with a flaky pastry and strawberries and cream. Everyone else also enjoyed a shot of peanut butter milk (described as a creamier and more decadent version of leftover milk in a delicious bowl of cereal), but I had to refrain, lest I wanted to risk anaphylactic shock.

The service was okay, but the dish timing was really off. There was a very large gap between our first two dishes, and our last two dishes.  During this time the waitresses kept awkwardly checking over our shoulders to check out the table, but every time they just walked away and did not even apologize for the delay or acknowledge us.  Then when the second two dishes came, they came within 5 minutes of each other.\n\nAnyway, for food we ordered the CA sturgeon caviar potato cloud, grilled escarole & spanish octopus, dried spiced BBQ lamb ribs, grilled llano seco pork lion, and bn ranch beef.  Not to sound ratchet, but we literally finished every dish clean because every element on the dish worked and was delicious!\n\nI highly recommend you add the CA sturgeon potato cloud onto your meal, just imagine a foam that tastes like potato, with little fried bits for texture, and the perfect amount of saltiness from the caviar.\n\nAll the dishes were great, but my least favourite dish was the bn ranch beef -- the meat was a little tough, and the bottom side of the meat was getting cooked too much by the other items that were below it.  There was also a lot of seaweed on the dish which was good, but eventually became overwhelming.\n\nOverall, this is a solid restaurant and it's not hard to get a reservation (unlike their sister restaurant) but again, I don't understand at all why it is worth of a Michelin star.", "author": "Jacqueline T."}

Here is a yelp I think may be helpful.  The Progress is the sister restaurant to State Bird.  I gave them 4 on here because I couldn't do 3.5.  Here are some hints.  Parking is terrible so leave yourself ample time to park. We had a group of 8 which means we had a private upstairs area just for us.  Great venue for up to 10.  Problem is that you have to take prefix menu.  The food overall was good.  Maybe over kill in terms of amount of food especially because they gave two huge orders of fillers.  The presentations were over all pretty.  Good use of fresh farm to table greens.  Service was attentive, solid 4.  Where they failed is the ending wow factor.  Considering how beautiful the apps and most entrees were, the desserts were no more than a 2.  Disjappointmenting right?  One of the desserts was a roasted date with Grenache.  Wow toothache in the works.  None of us ate it.  The pastry chef is clearly not attentive.  Considering all the greens they had from their garden, they should've at least placed the super sweet date on top of shiso leaves from a break and contrast to the sugar.  Or use a lemon curd to counter the sweetness of the date.  The strawberry sorbet again looked plain and not in tune with restaurants theme.  Perhaps one mint leaf or an edible flower on the top of sorbet wouldn't been perfect.  Unfortunately it's not how you start but how you finish.  Beautiful apps, great cocktails, good main courses, but unacceptable desserts...until next time ciao.", "author": "Dee Dee L."}

On average, when we needed our server we waited 5-10 mins before he noticed us.\n\nSecond, most of the food was good- but definitely not Michelin star status. We had the smoked foie gras w biscuits. Good but the flavors were not balanced at all. \n\nThe boquerones were excellent. The smoked black cod was again good but a VERY small portion of cod in relation to the rest of the dish and more importantly the sauce (which was very good) was too watery so it pooled at the bottom and the fish took on absolutely none of that flavor. \n\nThe blistered shishito peppers and tomatoes were also missing a pop of flavor.  The same could be said for our dessert. Good but not great. \n\nAt these types of places, you expect the unexpected and it seemed as though the imagination had fizzled. I probably would choose another place to dine.", "author": "Megha A."}

However, after dining here, I left not that impressed.\n\nI love the decor of the space. It looks small from the outside but when you walk in there's high ceilings with great use of wood and an open kitchen. It makes the place spacious and cozy all at once.\n\nThe service was what you'd expect from a Michelin rated restaurant. The staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and extremely attentive to each table. They're good enough to refill your water glass without you realizing that it happened. Plates and utensils are cleared and replaced in between dishes as necessary.\n\nThe concept of the menu is interesting. It's $62 per person per table, and you pick 4 items from the menu and the kitchen will scale the portions relative to the size of your party. The portions are fairly sized and you'll leave comfortably full.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was a bit of a letdown. Granted, everything we got was tasty, had great flavor and was and perfectly prepared, but nothing really made me go \"Wow, that's good! I need to come back for more!\" This could be a result of the dishes we picked. We got the bone marrow dumplings, which were probably the highlight of the 4, the brussels sprouts, seared cod and bn ranch beef. I think if I were to come back, I'd get the lamb ribs instead of the cod or sprouts. They also give you 3 small dishes on the house to whet your palate before dinner.", "author": "Khoi T."}

Finally managed to get a reservation to try The Progress as it had been on my list for a long time, and the food definitely didn't disappoint! You apparently can also order bar food without a reservation, something I will definitely be coming back for!\n\nI had a reservation for 8:00pm, and was on time, but did have to wait about ~15min before being seated that I dinged the meal for (4/5). It's a dining peeve of mine when I clearly have a reservation at a certain time and the restaurant doesn't accommodate here, especially a Michelin starred one. I get it. You can't really rush the person who's already eating but also need to keep the person who wants to sit down waiting. Someone loses, but I don't like it to be me. \n\n[Dinner]\nThe appetizers were included, with asparagus, a cold sliced beef dish, and a really tasty spread. For the family-style dinner, I had the beef and marrow dumplings, the clam, pork, asparagus broth, the jammy green curry, and the ling cod with a friend. I enjoyed the beef and marrow dumplings, but the clam, pork, asparagus broth was definitely the highlight of the meal for me. It was savory and a little spicy, but all the flavors worked really well. I also liked the rustic plates that everything was plated on here. The ling cod was also very fresh. The menu really highlighted asparagus. The one dish I was not a huge fan of was the jammy green curry.I really hate tofu in all its forms but wanted to give this a try because it was so highly recommended and I saw the dish being ordered around the room. The curry just didn't really work for me, maybe because the flavors and the asparagus clashed so much. However, the plating was great and the dish looked very beautiful.\n\nDesert was awesome. I had the saffron cake, and four shots of the state bird peanut milk. Order the peanut milk!!! HIGHLY recommend.\n\n[Drinks]\nI ended up bringing my own bottle to celebrate an anniversary. Corkage was $30. \n\n[D\u00e9cor]\nNot your traditional fine dining restaurant as you're seated pretty closely to each other, but it's also less stiff and really relaxed.

I heard a lot of mixed reviews about this place before coming here, and to be honest, I didn't like state bird when I tried it 4 years ago. \n\nThe experience at The Progress was disappointing. The inside resembled a Nopa feel..very casual. You pick 4 plates and you can add on sturgeon caviar and oysters which were both sold to us as amazing! We got all the add ons and the waitress's recommendations. Every dish was lacking something or didn't go well together in our opinion. It was beautiful! But not tasty. The toast with cod/sturgeon (I can't remember which one now) but it was so so soooo salty. The oysters were probably my favorite things, because the seaweed on it was delicious! I would skip the caviar. \n\nIt had a farm to table feel to every dish, but I wish it was better connected together. It seemed like things were seasoned with salt and pepper with a weird blend of caper or pea sauce just didn't go well with anything.

I'd say, it's not \"fancy\", but definitely worth sprucing up a bit.\n\nSO here's the deal with food:  You choose a dish from each course of the pre-fixed menu (and I believe it's 4 courses).  They do accommodate for special-needs eaters, so vegetarians can breathe a sigh of relief.  The appetizers are already chosen for you, and I will say they were AMAZING.  Lots of little bite-sized plates and everything is delicious.  But the main courses fell a little bit flat -nothing memorable to me at all. \n\nThe biggest gripe I have is that the experience simply doesn't match up to the price.

The chef doesn't know how to process Asian food, IMO.\n\nTo start, we ordered the oysters. $3.5 each. Glad we only ordered two. The citrus and the seaweed totally took the flavor of the dish, just too much.\nPig's head charcuterie was okay, but the portion was small, just enough for two people. $12.\nCrispy local coonstripe was too oily. The head of this kind of shrimp is fatty already, so the correct way to cook it is to absorb the extra oil after fry the shrimps. Or airfry the shrimps, or grill the shrimps to crispy. Learn how to process the food properly.\nBoquerones, salty, salty, salty.\nSmoked black cod...well...the fish is fatty, isn't it? Then I don't get it. Why ponzu butter and stir fried peas? Need more fat? No thanks.\nSquid ink noodles. Salty, salty, salty. The noodle itself is too soft without chewy texture. The kale is sort of pickled. The extra creamy sauce don't really go well with pickled salty kale. I became really full after just one bite of the noodles.\n\nService was good. Ambience is quite loud. And it became really crowded after 8pm on a Saturday. I don't get why this restaurant is soooo trendy right now.\n\nTotal was $140. I'm going to drink a lot of water now.

We got to our reservation a little early so we sat in the bar area for drinks. The hostess sat us pretty quickly (and about 25min before our actual reservation time) which was nice. The beer selection is good and the cocktails are delicious. I got the remedy which has mezcal and jalape\u00f1o - super smoky tasting at first but the flavor really grew on me and I ended up having 3 throughout the night! \n\nFOOD: so amazing...it was obviously pricey but we left full and happy. There only two of us but we really wanted to try as much as possible. We ordered: 3 oysters, 1 caviar with potato cloud, pig fries, smoked tuna salad, nettle and ricotta ravioli with mushroom, seared octopus, and the BBQ duck. Oh and the sticky toffee cake for dessert (SO good). Lots of food and totaled about $260 including 6 drinks on top of all that food. The oysters were yummy but the caviar and potato cloud was one of my favorites - tasted like a potato chip foam but salty and amazing. The pig fries were crispy and chewy at the same time and had a yummy sauce on them. The tuna salad was phenomenal - with radishes and an amazing buttermilk dressing. The ravioli was delicious and the octopus was easily on of my favorites dishes ever. The octopus was super tender and the fried kale with butter beans and oranges really went well with the octopus. Lastly, the BBQ duck - SO amazing and lots of food (cost $60 but we had leftovers to bring home). It came with a gingery garlic cilantro fried rice which was also amazing.

The salads and tuna were passable, but the two entrees, rabbit and octopus were only half eaten by the table (nobody asked either to be boxed up).

I offered my dessert to the table untouched and there were no takers. On the plus side, the cocktails were passable. \n\nIn the interest of full disclosure I found little of the menu appealing when we arrived and I dislike 'family style' dining if I'm paying for it.

It just got worse from there. \n\nThen, to top it all off, they charged a $4/person mandate fee BEFORE taxes. \n\nI was in town specifically to scope out potential locations for an event I am planning and this dinner was an immediate decision NOT to have it at The Workshop.

Choose your equipment (outfit), choose your party (dining partner), and choose your quest (dishes).\n\nMy high school years aside, The Progress is well-known as the sister restaurant to the famed, Michelin-starred State Bird Provisions. Though the two restaurants are right next to each other, they differ drastically in terms of dining style. Also, it's wayyyy easier to get a reservation at The Progress--I booked our date night only a few days in advance. But he don't have to know that ;)\n\nThe Progress straight up tells you in your reservation email that \"dinner will feature a choose-your-own-adventure dinner of small bites and larger, family-style platters, priced at $58/person.\" $58 gets you a set of complimentary appetizers and 4 shared dishes. Our thirsty selves started off with some cocktails, which The Progress offers and SBP does not. Our server recommended the $11 RIVER MAID, a refreshingly citrus gin cocktail. My boyfriend got the $12 MAI TAI--he got 2, to be exact. Coco for coconuts.\n\nLike Gary Danko and La Folie, you are allowed to choose your 4 dishes among any of the listed options. Some entrees are heavier than others, but there's no limits to your imagination. After sharing some recommendations, our server gave us the menu and pencil and left us to our own devices. Per his recommendation, we ordered an a la carte appetizer and an extra dish on top of the 4 shared dishes (our server was nice and charged us for the cheapest of the a la carte dishes)\n\n(COMPLIMENTARY) Appetizers of buttermilk biscuits, sweet corn croquettes, carrots & zucchini, and bottarga with chickpea hummus.\n-The sauces were amazing. We were using as many starches as we could to mop up the remaining sauces. And those buttermilk biscuits, mm.\n\n(A LA CARTE) $10 California Sturgeon Caviar Potato Cloud.\n-A recommendation from our server. Tiny portion about the size of my palm, so it's not a lot to share. The caviar is hidden in a small pile in the middle, but once you get to it, the saltiness pairs well with the airy, creamy potato-flavored foam.\n\n(A LA CARTE) Sashimi of Half-Moon Bay Halibut with whipped avocado, green coriander, and a spoonful of flowers.\n-Fresh and refreshing. Great combination of flavors and textures. I wish we got more slices!\n\nBoquerones of local anchovies, lime-pickled cucumbers, basil, and tumeric fry bread.\n-A recommendation from our server, who likes it because the anchovy taste isn't overpowering. I thought it was interesting, though the anchovy pieces were quite small and shadowed by the accompanying cucumbers, turnips, and basil.\n-The tumeric fry bread is yummy! The texture reminds me of yo tiao, the Chinese donut.\n\nGrilled Spanish Octopus with shell bean hummus, shaved fennel, toasted black rice, and preserved lemon.\n-Tasty tentacles! The smoky char from the grill is very prominent--I simultaneously liked and disliked it. I was a big fan of the big portion, though.\n-Boyfriend was not as impressed.\n\nSquid ink-flat noodle \"stir-fry\" with clams, fried squid, tofu skins, and squash stalks.\n-The noodles were good. Seafood was generous, and the fried squid was on point. A solid dish, but the boyfriend liked it more than I did.\n\nBBQ Liberty Farms Duck with gai-lan, thai basil, and duck fat peanut rice.\n-Winner winner duck dinner. This was a generous portion of 9 juicy, fat-lined duck slices. It was so fatty, it tasted like pork. In the best way possible.\n-That duck fat peanut rice is all sorts of good.\n\n(A LA CARTE) $10 Double Blueberry \"Pie\" made with cream cheese ice cream, puff pastry, and fino basil.\n-It's a deconstructed blueberry pie, and it's not that great. The ice cream and blueberry reduction were tasty, but the standalone puff pastry was underwhelming in taste and overwhelming in lardy, flaky texture. I guess I wasn't good at appropriately portioning everything onto my spoon :(\n\nI have to say, choose-your-own-adventure dinners are gratifying and satisfying, especially when they're family-style. Hop on The Progress train before it gets a Michelin star and prices shoot through the roof!\n\nFYI: boyfriend liked The Progress more than State Bird Provisions.

Family style concept, where all parties have to agree on 4 dishes makes the operational efficiency part easier for them. The Progress delivers on some very tasty inventive dishes, but lacks a subtle refinement one would expect at the price point and category, mainly due to the family style presentation which feels a little lazy. In the menus, there's emphasis on fresh, seasonal ingredients that weave through the different dishes. I noticed there was a theme of black butter or citrusy creaminess throughout the meal.\n\nFive amuse-bouches:\nButtermilk Biscuits with Peach Apple Bourbon Black Butter - This was my favorite, the biscuit was warm and melt in your mouth flaky and heavenly. Super decadent and rich flavorful butter.\nRainier Cherries with Almond Cream - Almond cream was subtle and not super nutty\nSummer Squash with Curried Peas - Pea paste was fresh, detected some basil\nNectarine - Fruit soaked in some syrup\nCarrots with whipped ricotta - Yummy combo of sweet and savory\n\nMains:\nHalibut Ceviche (4.5/5) - Fresh fish with creamy sauce. Similar to a poke bowl with the sesame and oil.\nSmoked Ham - (3/5) - Of the dishes, this felt the most heavy handed and lazy. The sauce was good and heavy for a starter dish, creamy but not particularly interesting. \nLamb Shank (5/5) - Rich and flavorful lamb, very tender, almost crumbly and gravy like. My favorite dish of the evening, tender lamb vinegary tang.\nCod Toast (4/5) - The toast was buttery and soaked in olive oil with some lemon acidity and brightness. My piece of cod was mostly tender but a touch overcooked and dry in some areas.\n\nDesserts:\nFloating islands nectarine sorbet (4/5) - The sorbet was very fresh and fruity as if biting into an icy sugary fruit at peak ripeness.\nChocolate cherry cake (3/5) - The chocolate was dense, crumbly and dark, slightly bitter but in an aromatic, peaty way like whiskey. Well paired with thyme butter, caramel like richness.\n\nThe service was pretty good, our hostess and server were both super friendly, enthusiastic without being too pushy or hovery though did try to upsell getting more desserts. I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for a table of 4, and we were seated in the upstairs area, which only had two tables. It was the perfect casual ambiance and vibe for catching up with friends - not surrounded by too many other people, modest and minimal light wood interior, soft lighting, big wide tables so you're not elbow to elbow or running out of space, dishes are plated on the neutral colored, earthy ceramic tableware patterns that all these new American places do.

It's relatively easy to score reservations here, compared to its sister restaurant. Out of the 14 offerings, you and your dinner companions select 4 dishes for $58/pp, dessert is excluded. You're recommended to select 2 appetizer dishes from the top portion of the menu and 2 entr\u00e9e dishes from the bottom portion. You'll also get a few neat snacks for the table (included in pricing). \n\nThe Verdict?: I dig it. \n\nWhat my dinner companions and I ordered that evening: \n- Don Watson lamb tartare (turmeric kohlrabi, chili lime vinaigrette, and black rice cracker) \n- Super fresh ricotta (local citrus, heart of palm and rosemary almonds)\n- Grilled Spanish octopus (harissa hummus, shaved winter radishes and toasted black rice)\n- BN Ranch beef (kosho butter basted squash and brussels spouts)\nDESSERT (extra charge $10 each) \n- Pistachio stack cake (if you're in a party of 6, order at least two or even three--this thing is light and petite!) \n\nI appreciated how accommodating the kitchen was regarding my current preggo dietary restriction. Since I couldn't devour the lamb tartare, our server allowed me to substitute this dish with a serving size for myself. I went for the Devil's Gulch Rabbit, which was dainty and scrumptious. \n\nIn exception to the lamb tartare, the dishes were creative and well prepared. I personally enjoyed all the dishes I was able to taste. I must mention that the BN Ranch beef, cooked to a medium-rare, was delicate and savory. I adore grilled octopus, so I was thrilled to encounter one that was tender, yet chewy, and nicely charred on the outside. I must admit my favorite dishes were all the proteins. \n\nNot completely certain if it's my belly talking, but in a group of 6, portions were rather inadequate.

Recommend by San Fran insiders as THE new place to try, so we went on a 1 night stay in San Fran. The food was crazy delicious, and creative, and the interesting combos just worked! The service is casual but professional, reminds me of Rose's Luxury in DC, perfect mix of fine dining with chill atmosphere. The space is nice, a little industrial for my liking. \n\nThe Food: They bring you some delicious little nibbles to start, which was awesome. The family style is good, but probably could get awkward if you arent with the right group. The whole table has to pick which dishes to share, so be sure to go with people you have similar tastes with. For me the best thing we ordered was the Lamb Shank Flat Noodle Stir Fry! But everything was great, really. \n\nThe Service: This was a super special meal, and almost a perfect, 5 star experience, except for 1 thing: we felt so so rushed! We were in and out in about an hour and 1 mins, which is just preposterous when youre spending that kinda of money (around $100/person with drinks!) I personally like to sit down, peruse the menu, order a drink, and then order my food. But we werent sitting 3 minutes before they dropped off the 'free' mini appetizers, and from then on it was rush rush rush. There is NO REASON not to replace our plates between courses at a restaurant of this caliber, an inexcusable thing, IMO.  I told this to some of my SF friends, and they said they've heard the same thing about the pacing of the meal. Slow down, Progress!

Boy, did they go fast! so if you're looking to go out on a holiday or busy weekend night, i suggest making a reservation a while before your planned evening. i actually made changes to the res. and they still were very accommodating. i actaully change it twice, lol. I know, I know, I'm one of those people. i sowwy -_-- \n\nparking was not really a problem, but then again we went on a weekday. It's street parking and there is also a parking garage next to it. They say it gets super crowded, so plan accordingly! \n\nThe Venue\nTwas clean and hipster. i wasn't expecting super fine dining kine, haha. they sat us up on the balcony. So it was literally just our table up there. It was super great to have that private space. Super recommend! they got gender neutral bathrooms, too. its like just one room with several doors to each little private bathrooms. great space to take a breath from stuffing and drinking yourself, silly. \n\nThe FOOD...... and draanks (fuh, finally)\nHonestly, I think we ordered the whole menu, somethings we ordered twice. yeah, that good. The oysters were great, super fresh. not hella briny and the yuzu nori was interesting. They put a bit much on top but it was good. pig fries, um YES. and that freakin' dutch baby.... HELL YESSSSSSS. the truffles make it super flavorful and rich.  Salads were good, but to warn all these servings are like personals. We ordered multiple of dishes so we all could try it. but yeah mostly, it's for one teenytiny human. we had all the pastas. I think i gotta say my fav was the squid ink and the ravioli. The squid ink, like before when i had squid ink stuff the taste was like non existent. There wasn't an added flavor. But these noods were delicious! i liked that it added a depth of flavor to the noodles. Almost like fresh ocean. so i guess like briny. the ravioli tasted meaty and was rich. I loved this, like seriously, so flavorful. so rich. the pierogies however, I wouldn't order these again. They were mostly pasta, the filling was good but i didn't get really more than just a taste of it. no kimchi flavor at all. but pleasepleaseplease get the roti and make it rain on iiiiiitttttt. had the octopus, abalone, and ragout. octopus had great char. abalone, well this is my first time trying it so i have nothing to compare it to, hehe. it was delicious tho! The ragout was yum! the meat was broken down pretty far, there were no like chunks of meat but the potatoes were good, smoked i believe. We also had the Duck. It was sooo good. Seasoned super well. we were mostly stuffed by this point but we made quite an effort to indulge ourselves in this haha. oh and the trout was delicious. there were like different ways it was cooked? and actually some of the fish looked different, but still great texture and seasoned well. they ran out of the ribeye... and honestly if they had it, i dont think we wouldve tried everything that we did. For dessert, we had the pannacotta and the peanut milk. I liked the peanut milk more because well, i love peanut butter. so i'm bias, haha. But it tastes like a tiny shot of peanutbutter ice cream. it didn't coat the tongue, it was pretty clean tasting. the pannacotta, the shiso was really subtle. I loved the meyer lemon and olive oil was an interesting combination. but if i could get the peanut milk in a carafe instead, i'd be hella set! We had drink flowing throughout dinner. We had the Sunny Jim, The Remedy, Manhattan, and the Martini. Sunny Jim, sweet and light. The remedy, smoked ginger, yum. the jalapeno was subtle but nice little kick on the lips when you sippin' on that slizzuurrr. The Manhattan, brown butter bourbon? how could you say no? \n\nOverall;\nbe prepared to spend for one of the tastiest menus you'll ever come across. for the amount of food, i know most people would be deterred because of the menu prices.

Came here with a group of friends and ordered about 8 dishes worth of food. A mix of meat, seafood, and salad plates. Everything was pretty underwhelming except for the vegetarian dumplings. The most disappointing dish was the $80 steak we ordered to be shared with three people. It came looking unappetizing and tasted just like it. The $80 price tag definitely added to the negative review considering legitimate steakhouses don't even charge $80 for a 24oz cut of meat. And when they do, it tastes better than whatever was made at Progress. \n\nEveryone ordered about two drinks each and our bill came out to be roughly $83/person after tax and tip (group of 4). Such an underwhelming dinner for such a hyped up place. Definitely pass.", "author": "Teresa L."}

My friend made a reservation weeks in advance. I was very impressed how we were sat in a section separate from the rest of the restaurant! Our table was upstairs, and it felt as if we had our own private balcony since it was the only one up there. There is another one on the other side but you would have to go and take another set of stairs. I really loved the privacy we had! \n\nPricing for dinner was $72 per person. It was a family style dinner and the meals were already prepared for us. \n\nBecause they already set the menu, it was nice of them to ask if anyone had allergies so they can prepare separate dishes. \n\nWe order extra potato cloud caviar, it was a good try. It was crunchy and tasted like potato chips!\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was the portion sizes for our table, I felt like it was really tedious and difficult to share between 10 people. I mean the lazy Susan in the middle of the table definitely helped though.\n\nIf I could give the service 5 stars I would! After each meal they politely pre-bussed the table and prepared it for the next course. Also, all the servers were very knowledgeable about all the drinks and dishes we were eating which is great!", "author": "Janellah Z."}

Brace yourselves for some truth. But first, the things I liked -- loved the decor. There's a lot of detail in everything. There's details in the ambiance that are really special. \n\nThen there are too many details when it comes to the four dishes we chose. Some raw local halibut destroyed by smoked creme fraiche and cold hearts of palm. I felt like I was eating raw fish with cream - I didn't think that worked - but now there's these hearts of palm here too. Think about it for a second. It doesn't work. \n\nI think we had an octopus dish -- I can't complain but I don't remember it at all. I think we had a black cod dish. The cod was cooked perfectly. But there's an issue with seasoning here. \n\nAnd this was by far the biggest gripe of the night. I f-ing hated that they brought out the third and fourth course when my date was in the bathroom. I really didn't like it because we were waiting so long for the courses that she hit the loo. \n\nWhy bring not one but two goddamn courses out when one half of the party is missing?\nI'm just looking at the two dishes with the table positioned directly to look right at our table. \n\nI get it, this is like... \"cool casual\" - we love details, we can't be wrong, basic shit like don't bring out two courses until perhaps the party of two is whole again - I was half-expecting them to tell me to eat it while it is hot. \n\nI've been to State Bird - I was unimpressed. This was a weaker version of that. \n\nIn fairness, the only reason this is 2 stars and not 1 star is because of that Peanut Milk that is served for dessert. That's what I expected this whole damn thing to be. Something just left of center, not covered in flowers w/ flavor profiles pulling you in 6 different directions - in a bad way - drawn and quartered - not that bad. \n\nThere's too many good places in SF to bother with this place.

Not really knowing the sizes of the dishes, we listened to the waiter and ordered more. turns out we definitely didn't need to order the extra dishes. In hindsight, I wish the waiter made his point but then suggested we receive our original order and order more if we wanted, which would have felt a little less pressure-ful. \n\nI ordered a root beer, which didn't show up for quite some time. I had to inquire about it before receiving it... and at no point did the waiter apologize for the oversight. \n\nSome of the food was great - the roti was delicious and my dining partner loved the fried quail. But the stir fry was SUPER salty and honestly not terribly pleasant to eat. The dessert with the fig sorbet was great. \n\nAs a final disappointment, my dining partner asked for his leftover quail to be packaged to go. The waiter never brought the leftovers back.

Mainly because we went with people who really enjoyed it, actually I guess everybody enjoyed it, but for me. However, after reading other recent Yelp reviews that seemed to line up with how I felt, I figured what the hell.\nAnyways, first the positives, Nice space (a little loud, but whatever), attentive service and good cocktails. Okay, but after that, the food really wasn't for me. A collection of mismatched ideas that at least for me really didn't work at all. Again, everybody I was with seemed to enjoy the food, so maybe I'm just missing it? Almost all the dishes seemed under seasoned and frankly underwhelming to me. I knew I was in trouble when I sat down and looked at the menu. Super odd choices on the part of the kitchen, who puts fish sauce on a charcuterie plate? I love both things, but together, the fish sauce simply overwhelmed everything else.  Also one of the fish dishes, I believe the steamed cod, wow didn't seemed cooked at all, I don't mean the fish, I mean everything else. Just seamed like something served at a raw food restaurant and again not for me at all. Another super odd choice for me, was the corn desert with tomato. It really tasted like it had ketchup on it. I again enjoy ketchup, but not on my desert.\nFamily style is great, but leaving hungry because you didn't really like anything at $65 a plate sort of stinks. Anyways, for me the whole thing was very disappointing. The only reason I'm bothering to give it 2 stars is because of the service and it's obvious they are trying. Personally, I would never return. Clearly there are people that enjoy this type of food, and it's just not me, and that's okay.

One night to convince us how awesome San Fran's food is. All the recommendations we got were oyster bars, clam chowder places and the likes and with the hubby not liking any fish or seafood, those were off the table. We asked the girls in our shared Uber what they would recommend for us Farm-to-Table aficionados and they suggested State Bird Provision but also mentioned that it's hard to get a table especially on a Saturday night. We tried our luck and even found free parking around the corner - yay! However, they only had tables for 9pm which would have been to late for our flight so they suggested next door \"The Progress\" owned by the same people. They were also booked but we found a cute little table corner in the bar area. The place itself looks really nice and had shared bathroom - so if you're a hardcore conservative that placed might not be for you lol. I ordered \"The Remedy\", a smoked mezcal. The smoke flavor was really strong in this one. We shared the melon and goat cheese which was delectable. The items on the menu are designed to be shared. Then we shared the duck entree. It comes on a really big platter and tastes great especially when you combine duck and rice. I just thought there wasn't that much meat for $60.

We had no dinner plan. It looked like a pleasant day for walking, so off we went. Midway through the walk, she texted back, first she was not sure, then she was certain that she was coming at 7 pm, but then the very last message was, she's going on a Tinder / Match / (insert any number of dating sites that I don't know much about) date and therefore we'd have to eat without her. By then we had arrived at the Progress.\n\nI've always wanted to come here. Ever since I've lined up eating at the State Bird a couple of years ago, learning about the Progress's opening, I've wanted to come here. I know it as the family style dinner. Tried to come with another couple but somehow it's difficult to organize one such expedition. Turns out that you don't have to eat a mountain. You can just get a dish or two, and eat at the bar area. My favorite kind of dining style.\n\nOn Saturday at 6:20 pm, the bar seating area is still not too packed. There are a few cozy Japanese style sitting areas for people to huddle and enjoy a complete meal. We found two mid section bar stools to sit on. It was perfect for people watching.\n\nNoted the following immediately: lots of couples. The women here who were presumably the wives with big rings and bigger hair of the pair were very pretty, the men, not so much, and they seemed bored. So bored so that they were checking me out. So I was told by my friend. I blamed on the dress that was meant for teenagers but fitted me like a glove that I had on that day. This British label vintage 1940s style dress was very much enjoying a high fashion cocktail at that precise moment, which by the way, was made just as tasty as the dress. Delicious ap\u00e9ritif that makes one want to order food is always a winner. \n\nWe each got to pick a few things. He wanted jerky, I wanted fermented sausage.  We got both. In between drinks we decided on the other tapas. Black rice oysters served with kimchi seemed completely irrationally bizarre, yet it worked wonders. it's the Southern Chinese AND Korean influence that surprised me. A daily special which we got talked into: dumplings with sauerkraut and potatoes was very deliriously confusing but in the utter most whimsical way: German ingredients stuffed in Chinese potsticker skins.  I think it reminded him what his German grandma made when he was little. It then inspired me to make Chinese dumplings later that week. \n\nThe Progress, being a sister restaurant to the Michelin Starred State Bird, one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco, is making a good progress towards being also Michelin starred. Being the James Beard 2015 winner is no easy feat in and of itself, especially in a competitive market like this one. It also got the same vibe as Batard, the 2015 James Beard winner restaurant in TribeCa, Manhattan, where I had done my birthday dinner recently. I do believe the staff is equally attentive as State Bird, and the restaurant self carries a more relaxed and chilled aura than their peer in New York. \n\nGilded tiles on ceiling and floor of the bathroom. I starred at this girl in the mirror, dressed in a black and red pencil skirt dress, with plunging neckline, she looked completely foreign to me. She stared at me back in a nonchalant way and that startled me a little. I think this restaurant transforms people. Gone was the nerdy sporty woman in glasses, covered in oversized sweater and jeans, incoming the petite version of the red head from Mad Men: there was no shortage of self confidence. \n\nA superb restaurant cares not only about the food and service, but also creates an ambience, with some magical fairy dust thrown in.

Surprisingly, it wasn't as difficult to land a reservation here than for State Bird.\n\nWhen you walk in, it's a much more grander scale than State Bird.  The decor is warm and looks a lot brighter.  Plus they have two upper balconies for dining.  The big difference with The Progress is that they have a full cocktail bar here with tables so you can dine at the bar as well.\n\nThe food menu is completely different and can hold it's own against State Bird.  Where State Bird is more of a dim sum and tapas style restaurant, the Progress has a more family style dining approach with a 6-course dinner.  While the experience is still similar, the food portions here are larger.  I dined here with a couple friends so sharing each dish between the three of us was pretty easy to do.  The only thing that did take a while was for us to decide which 6 dishes to pick for our dinner.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nComplimentary \"Banchan\" --  http://bit.ly/1FnBuQb \n\nRaw Japanese Snapper with Turnips & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche -- http://bit.ly/1HVWSJL \n\nSmoked Duck with Marinated Pioppini Mushrooms & Dried Plum --  http://bit.ly/1yZ5FFK\n\nShaved Cauliflower-herbs & Pig Fries --  http://bit.ly/1yZ6zC7\n\nAromatic Spiced Squab with Salted Chili Paste -- http://bit.ly/1HW03kN \n\nLamb Merguez with Yellow Eye Beans, Octopus & Crispy Squid --  http://bit.ly/1HW1iAu\n\nDessert Assortment --  http://bit.ly/1DNhNkO\ndessert choose 1 per person\nlemongrass floating island, rhubarb sorbet & coconut-ginger gel\u00e9e\npoppyseed angel cake, strawberries, sicilian pistachio & mascarpone\ndates \u00e0 la mode, St. George NOLA, hazelnuts & chocolate\n\nSo much food!  And we enjoyed pretty much everything we ordered.  My faves were definitely the Smoked Duck which was similar to the duck I had back at State Bird minus the pancakes, the Pig Fries because of their sheer fried pork awesomeness,  and surprisingly, the Lamb Merguez with Octopus and Squid, simply because I'm not into lamb that much.  But somehow they found a way to bring that dish all together and the Lamb Merguez didn't have an overpowering lamb taste.  The dessert assortment, while good, was a little bit of a let down in comparison to State Bird's dessert offerings.  I might end up skipping dessert next time since it's optional.\n\nJust recently, they changed the food menu at the bar.  Though it's still a la carte, the portions are more tapas sized like State Bird and at more affordable prices.  So basically, you can get a \"State Bird\" experience at the bar.\n\nIs The Progress better than State Bird?  It's pretty close,  Food-wise they're almost equally impressive, but I still prefer the whole \"dim sum\" experience at State Bird to be more entertaining.   Nonetheless, The Progress is an amazing follow up from the State Bird Provisions team and I wouldn't hesitate to go back again to try their other dishes, just like I would with State Bird.", "author": "Rodney H."}

Thankfully something with some flavor. It also didn't hurt it had a kick to it. \n\nAside from the food, the interior was gorgeous and the service was great (props to our waitress who had a passion for wines).", "author": "Neal N."}

Overall I think our party of 6 enjoyed our dinner, but I really wanted to be \"wow'ed\" by the meal. Unfortunately the main entrees on the menu were not really to my liking - the three options were the duck, rabbit, and fried trout. We ordered the trout and duck. The duck was pretty well done. A bit gamey and also duck isn't usually something I'd eat. The preparation of the trout was not to my liking. It was described as fried whole trout but it was actually diced up and chunks were deep fried.  The sauce on the fish was good but I felt deep frying it ruined the potential of the dish. Overall the entrees were 3/5. \nThe starters and side dishes saved the meal. All the items we ordered were so well prepared and so many amazing complementary flavors. \nWe doubled up on certain dishes and still the portions were a bit on the small side still. \nAmong our favorite dishes were the slightly smoked tuna, the squid ink noodles, octopus, and beet and arugula salad. \nThe ones that were ok but didn't stand out too much were the caviar potato cloud and the ravioli. \nThe service was great and overall the bill was less than I expected (under $100 per person with gratuity). We were full without feeling stuffed. \nSo overall not a bad meal but not the best ever and there are probably better places in this price range to go.\nWe were able to get reservations for 6 on a Saturday two weeks before going.", "author": "Jules M."}

Foodie review! \n\nOverview came with no reservation on a Wednesday night and accidentally mistaken the place for state bird. Two of us spent $165 4 dishes and about 5:6 cocktails.\n\nLOCATION AND AMBIANCE: 5 STARS \nAbsolutely loved the place inside. Funny and true story the wife and I were headed to our hotel in San Rafael from San Jose. Decided to try a bookmark we had saved and decided upon state bird. So of course since both restaurants are unmarked we accidentally mistaken the restaurant for it. However we decided to stay since it looked equally as cute  and less busy. We had amazing seats at the bar and I felt like it worked out for the better. The decor inside is lots of large tables with a very earthy natural reclaimed look and finish. Open and well lit with very good natural table spacing.\n\nSERVICE AND STAFF: 3.75 STARS \nIn the restaurants defense we did sit at the bar, which meant they were probably less inclined to check and follow up on our meals than drinks. However there were moments that the bar tenders even seemed to ignore the fact that I was going through my drinks rather quickly and also open enough to give the bar tender more than enough room to get creative with my drinks or make me something off menu. Also the food service seemed a little off where waiters were unsure if certain items were ours or not ? However everyone was polite, I just wish they would be more attentive or paying attention to my needs as I was practically sitting front and center at the bar.", "author": "Thedips D."}

It was just too crowded. However they recently had a special dinner we were able to snag reservations. The space is unmarked on the outside. When you walk in there's the bar area to the left which then opens to a shotgun space. There are also two mezzanine spaces opposite each other. It was pretty clear they were slammed as they were running 30 min behind on seating. Once we got settled we had:\n\n-Eggplant and tomatoes, dashi, tomato gelee\n-Terrine of figs and their leaves\n-Anchovy-shiso tempura\n-Fire ants on a log\n-Kombucha\n-Sea urchin with savory panna cotta\n-Grilled squid\n-Chawanmushi, lamb tartare, matsutake, clams\n-Black cod, charred alliums, summer squash, walnut pesto\n-Veal, cauliflower mushrooms, seaweed\n-Fromage blanc marshmallow sherbet, sesame sable, mulberry\n-mochi crepe, cognac ice cream, fig jam, cocoa nibs\n\nAll fairly delicious.

While my dining experience was just fine, it was nothing spectacular, and not worth the price. I would not come back. \n\nWe came here because this is the sister restaurant to State Bird. We can't get a reservation at State Bird, so we tried this place. As you may or may not know, it's $65 per person for 6 dishes (or 5 dishes + 2 desserts). We opted for the 6 savory dishes choice because desserts are always the highest markup items. \n\nThe meal came with a plate of complimentary snacks. Most were very tasty. From the menu, we ordered: halibut, anchovies, tiger prawns, cod, figs, and fried oysters. I thought the halibut and the anchovies were the best. Very flavorful. The cod, prawns, and figs are okay. I didn't like the oysters; they tasted very fishy. \n\nOverall, I didn't think that any of the dishes stood out that much from similar restaurants of this caliber or price range. Nothing tasted particularly interesting or memorable, even though everything tasted good. Gary Danko is probably $20-30 more per person, but tastes a whole lot better. \n\nThis place also isn't very formal. People aren't dressed up; it's very casual. The table are quite close together. The dining area is very large. It's extremely noisy in here, so while the food came slowly and you have the time to talk to your dining companion, it's very difficult to hear.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

I dined as a guest in a banquet party so of course I couldn't complain about the dishes, but now in the anonymity of Yelp I can let go. \n\nTo be fair the service was very good, appropriate for a celebratory dinner. The squash soup was tiny, good but barely a mouthful. The snap pea appetizer was tasty, hot and crisp. If only the rest of the meal had followed suit. \n\nThe raw halibut was stale and tasteless. The beef and marrow dumplings were really an embarrassment - served cold and oily, with too-thick wrappings and a completely tasteless filling (my wife spit it out).

Unlike most bespoke cocktails this one actually contained some alcohol. First course was potato foam stuff with Caviar from local sturgeon. This was amazing and worth the walk down the cold Fillmore corridor to The Progress by itself. Next course was a forgettable tuna dish with ranch, pine nuts, and watermelon radishes. Wine was Chenin Blanc from the Loire which was great if maybe too pricey by the glass, but everything is now so who cares. The best dish was the octopus steak that was perfectly cooked and amazing. I forget the rest of the meal, courses here are small and spendy but it's a great menu and beautiful space. Service was good and efficient although our server was little too present.

This is as pretentious as food comes.  Incredibly expensive for tiny portions of weird food.

I am giving this two stars instead of one because they had exceptional service including the host, the waitress, and the bussers.  The food was also probably good if your style is 'very expensive weird food that no one without pica would have eaten 10 years ago.'

I've never had so many in tune people take care of us before. I mean seriously, every person working there was paying attention to us and we didn't even know it. My husband unknowingly dropped his napkin, boom, replaced. I dropped my knife, boom replaced. We couldn't make up our minds on wine, boom, we're doing a tasting. I wish every restaurant had service like this. The only thing they didn't anticipate was my butt hurting from their hard seating. Next time I might bring a cushion. I mentioned this to them on our way out, they got a good laugh. Service doesn't get much better than this. \n\nFood. Oh the food. Here's the deal, $65 each for 6 dishes shared family style. It's up to you and your party to select those 6, including dessert. You can of course order more than 6 dishes, it's entirely up to you. On our visit we ordered 11 dishes between the 2 of us because well, we love to eat and try new things. So it was full on dining realness for us. \n\nI'm not going to go over every dish in minute detail as the menu changes frequently so what's there today, may not be there tomorrow. I did take photos of the dishes we tried and I'll post the ones we loved most. However, if it's on the menu, get the pig fry charcuterie salad! A salad of crispy pigs ears, ham, and greens dressed with lime and fish sauce. It was my favorite dishes of the evening. \n\nOh, cocktails. The Progress makes one of the greatest Manhattans I've had the pleasure of sipping on. Their secret, brown butter infused bourbon. Come on, butter and bourbon, so much love with this drink.

Reservations for two, to celebrate my birthday. We were greeted by their wonderful staff and seated. Ambiance is welcoming yet modern and simple. Great place for a date or a gathering of people. It's \"family style\" (regardless if its 2 people or 10 people) and your table chooses 6 main dishes OR 5 main dishes and dessert (per person) for $65 per person. I loved this concept of selecting together and sharing together - eating the same flavors on different palettes.\n\nPOISON OF CHOICE.\nSummer Jin - Forgot to jot down the description but its a very refreshing fruity drink. \n\nTHE SNACK.\nThe kitchen provided each table at the restaurant with a \"snack'. It was a plate with 6 bitesize items with 2 pieces of each. I'm unable to provide descriptions of each but each were very tasty. Chinese sausage with curry powered, Beet with some infused flavor, Fried eggplant with a creamy dip, Hamachi drizzled in flavored olive oil, Grilled pepper, and a Peach with more infused peach flavor.\n\nTHE SELECTION.\nRaw local HMB halibut with turnips, \"ikura\" & creme fraiche - this was the first dish that came to the table. We mixed the halibut around all the ingredient and ate it with the purple chips it came with. the halibut was very fresh and creamy, actually, extra creamy with the creme fraiche. The ikura was a nice tough to add the salty factor without adding salt seasoning. Very well executed first dish to introduce our other selections. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nOcean beach \"boquerones\" with lemon, cucumber, basil & pardons - Boquerones means sardines for those that don't know! The plate serves 4 boquerones and they were perfectly cooked. The slightly saltiness paired well with the green olive oil it was resting on and combining each bite with the cucumber was a really good pairing. The shishito peppers felt like they were there to cover space on the plate but they were still good to eat. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nGrilled local spot prawns with brown butter & tiny garden vegetables - Probably the biggest shrimps I've ever ate in life. The shrimp itself came out whole and the taste of their body was very juicy, tender, buttery, and a sweet - it wasn't too \"shrimpy\" in flavor for a big shrimp. Don't be afraid to dig in, they provide wet towels and additional plate for the shells. Optional to suck the head, being Filipino there is no hesitation to suck the head. Goodness, it was \"the biggest head\" that I sucked AHAHA. It is where all the flavors are but do expect scary looking brain cerebrum with it too. I was focused and intrigued by the big shrimp I didn't even get a chance to sample the tiny garden vegetables it came with.   HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nLamb merquez with yell eye beans, octopus & crispy squid - I'm not a fan of anything lamb as it is too gamy, HOWEVER I did enjoy this dish. The dish was a blend of tiny chopped lamb sausage, octopus, and squid so it is not just lamb. The lamb did have a strong flavor for such a small piece but its flavor could easily be diluted by the taste of octopus and squid and the cilantro in this dish. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nBlack rice fried hog island sweet water oysters & butter clam-kimchi 'piccata' - I didn't even notice the purple/black items in the dish were oysters until I bit into one of them. The oyster was very delicate and soft covered in a lightly crispy black rice coating. They were laid on top of a butter clam-kimchi 'piccata' which to me had a very strong tangy flavor. The oysters by themselves were delicious and the clam-kimchi piccata by itself is delicious but together I was getting savory and tangy which didn't settle quickly into my palette but after awhile it did. The best part of this dish for me were the oysters, they were so good. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nTHE DESSERT.\nGoddess melon floating island, yogurt sorbet & strawberry - The yogurt sorbet was a nice palette cleanser. It also came with a foamy creme fresh cloud garnished with fresh cracked pepper. Loved the foamy ball but wasn't too thrilled with the crack pepper on the dessert. It just didn't belong in the dessert. Still a very simple and yummy dessert.\n\nCoconut-cinnamon ice cream plum sungold tomato caramel, hazelnut - This dessert had more going on with texture and flavor. The ice cream was more coconut than cinnamon but very light hints of cinnamon to contrast the coconut flavor. It had a drizzle of plum sungold tomato caramel sauce which didn't have much tomato flavor but can taste the plum and caramel. Mixed in the sauce are small shavings of coconut which ties the sauce with the ice cream - i like that! And two sticks that were like bread-cookies, very airy and cripsy, good additions for texture when it comes to ice cream desserts.\n\nGood food + Greater company = awesome experience\n\nI miss my SF life.\n\n Will I be back? I'd love too.\n\nJABA APPROVED. Until the next review...", "author": "Jane A."}

With a unique tasting menu that has diners choose from a fixed set of small plate starters and protein plates - you get a tour de force of some fantastic tastes and flavors. \n\nThe chefs have found a great niche focusing flavors by blending the savory with the salty and the sugary with the umami.

Oh, and it's where all the cool kids work so that adds to the fun factor of an evening event at the restaurant.\n\nA word of advice - the restaurant is best set-up to accommodate tables of four or more.

Had a group of five and our table was ready, but they would not seat us cuz our last person was held up in traffic - like that never happens. Right. Nice booth when we were finally seated, and proper fast attention from the server. Tee-tiny cocktails, but some exotic signature thingies with fennel extract and eye of newt and so forth. The place was scream at the top of your lungs loud, so bring a megaphone or just text everyone. Dinner is served family style, and the menu was a bit goofy. There were a number of items listed and for the dinner fee, we were able to select four for the table and supplement with al la carte if we were so inclined. They brought some appetizers which included corn bread in little lozenge-style bites that were nothing to write home about. The pickled seaweed and edamame was tasty but the ham came up way short. Portions were very small. Two plates came right away. Apparently, the chef enjoys camouflaging the meager portion size with a ton of trendy micro greens. Yawn. The tomato and plum dish was good, served with feta and the ravioli dish with beef and marrow was acceptable, but not fab. Table was awash with greens. \n\nAnyhoo, then almost an hour wait for the second set of dishes. We had to threaten to leave in order for them to pay some attention to us and even then, it was a struggle. Had the octopus, which was slightly charred but tasty, however it was like Survivor in the Costa Rican jungle trying to separate the plant matter from the sparse protein.  I forget the other thing we had as we were so irritated at the lackadaisical and uninspired service.  Bill was presented immediately, though. Place was emptying at 10 pm when we left.

It's like the universe knows I'm paranoid about parking in the city and being late and being hangry, so to calm me down I always get parking really quickly and then I'm everywhere super early. So we got to the progress too early for our reservation which is fine because they have a lovely bar to sit at and have a drink. I love this bar as it feels casual and luxurious at the same time. There is a great bartender I see every time I'm here - red headed guy with tattoos- and he's super nice and makes a great drink. \n\nWe were happy to be celebrating our engagement with both our parents. My parents are kinda picky parents who hate spending money on food so it always makes me nervous to take them anywhere. Luckily the Progress is amazing and my parents loved it! The only thing I would have changed is they put our group of 6 in a booth, 3 and 3 on each side. It was not ideal as everyone kept having to get up and down to let people out to use the restroom. It's probably only a real problem if you have my parents but it was still pretty annoying. Not a fan of booths. \n\nOur shared table appetizers included : \nDates with a hazelnuts cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche\nCured meat\nTofu with pesto\nPickled carrots\nButtermilk biscuit (delicious) \n\n4 family style table items we picked were: \nRaw Halibut - came on one plate - very cool and refreshing\nDuck Broth with mushrooms and dumpling in individual bowls - my favorite! \nPork shoulder - large portion that came sliced up and ready to eat on top of lettuce with some korean bean paste on the side\nGrilled octopus - amazing very tender octopus\nSeafood fried rice which had black fried octopus, aoili, and calmari. I never order fried rice because I always think it's kinda boring but this was sooo amazing. It has converted me into a believer of fried rice. \n\nAt the end, we were completely stuffed so we shared desserts. \nWe got a floating island - meringue with a raspberry gelatina, and a coconut sorbet - and olive oil cake with fennel on top. Both  light, sweet, and just right. \n\nOverall a perfect dinner.  Everyone was happy, even my old-school, picky parents.", "author": "Veronica L."}

My expectations were high, probably too high which always leads to some disappointment.  I was expecting for some of the dishes to blow me away, none did but all were very good.\n\nThree of us sat down for dinner and the first thing you notice is the noise level, it's high and the overall vibe borders on frenetic.  Nothing wrong with that, just don't expect a quiet date night atmosphere,  Four courses are ordered and served family style. There are a few amuses which were:\nSmoked trout with mandarin and seven pepper cracker\nPotato fry bread with carrot sour salt and yogurt\nRadish with buddha's hand kosho lard\nThe trout and potato fry bread had excellent flavor the radish was just ok.\n\nOn to the meal we shared:\nTempura of eggplant with black sesame babaganoush, queso fresco, persimmons and mustard greens\nSpiced beef and marrow dumplings with shitake mushrooms, young ginger and lemongrass vinaigrette\nGrilled escarole and Spanish octopus with harissa butter bean sauce, pomegranate and mint\nGrilled llano seco pork loin with crushed broccoli, tomatillo, dried cumin chili oil and farm greens\nAlso ordered a supplement of Hog island sweetwater oysters with yuzu pickled local nori\n\nThe eggplant, dumplings and octopus were all excellent, layered flavors and textures.  The pork was VERY fatty (and I like fatty pork) and overall the dish was a bit bland.  The oysters were excellent the nori should have been smaller as it was very chewy.\n\nWe shared two desserts:\nWarm apple crepes with buttery calvados broth, huckleberries and pine nuts\nBrown butter walnut cake with pumpkin mousse, mapled prunes and black sesame\nBoth desserts were very good, the three of us were split on the best, always a good sign :).\nHad an excellent Mascarello freisa (like an Italian gamay) with the meal\n\nOverall a very good to excellent dinner and excellent service throughout the evening.", "author": "Tom D."}

I told them that my friend was vegetarian, and all they did was point out the 4 dishes that were vegetarian. Since the prix fixe consists of 4 dishes, we had to order all four of those.

I land between a 4 and 5 ish but I guess it's a pretty good restaurant and I find myself still recommending it to people as a great foodie option, so a 5 it is.\n\nSO and I came to The Progress last night -- his first, my second. I enjoy The Progress primarily because relative to SBP, you almost never have to wait in line here. The caveat is that you'll likely be sitting at a tiny table at the bar or next to it, but if you don't like to wait in lines like me and just care about good food, this is a godsend. \n\nWe rolled in around 9pm on a Saturday night and were able to grab a small hidden table pretty easily -- great spot tucked into a corner that gave us a lot of privacy and intimacy relative to some of the other bar seats that are a bit more open. The only con with these open seats is that service is not always the best and it takes some time to capture a waiter's attention, but once they know you're there, they're attentive enough and the food rolls out pretty quickly.\n\nI've found that the food changes here quite often depending on what's seasonal, but here's what we got last night:\nOcean beach boquerones with lemon cucumber, basil, padrons\nAlaskan sockeye pickled in dashi with nori, avocado, and cucumber\nSpiced don watson's lamb tartare with sesame rice crisps\nBlacked rice fried sweetwater oysters-kimchi piccata\nLocal spot prawn with brown butter and uny garden vegetables\nGrilled cauliflower a la romana with smoked prune romesco\nWhite chocolate-brown butter pear cake, fig ice cream, and cocoa syrup\nRaspberry sorbet, noyaux floating island, o'henry peaches\n\nNot sure how valuable it is for me to go into the details of each dish since even these dishes have changed quite a bit since I was last here, but I honestly found every single one to be quite good. They weren't mindblowing, but they were all pretty interesting and very well executed. The lamb tartare and prawn were probably our savory standouts and the dessert was the SO's favorite dessert to date. Cannot really speak to how amazing the dessert was. The noyaux was my favorite and SO really loved the pear cake and fig ice cream. Really, really well executed. \n\nI also got the Sunny Jim which was a pretty delicious drink to go along with the meal. Final total came out to be $120 post tax and tip which is an alright price for two I guess. It wasn't a ton of food so SO was a little hungry when we left, but I felt pretty good about it. Given how great the quality of the food was and how innovative the dishes were, it's still always a favorite for me to go to.\n\ntldr; pretty good ; SBP is more mindblowingly WOW, in my opinion, but I prefer the Progress since no ridiculous waits or lines if you're okay with sitting at the bar", "author": "Jasmine X."}

I saw at least 70 people standing outside. No surprise, every person is there for State Bird Provisions. I can't even imagine how long you have to wait to get a reservation there, because there were a good 35 people that walked in just for a 5:30pm reservation that had to check-in and wait in line before they could even be seated. Anyways, I was pretty glad to be going to the less popular (yet still hyped) Progress. \n\nUpon entering, I was definitely impressed. There was an awesome bar near the front where you can order bar food and drinks, and wooden stools! Now, let me tell you, I freaking love wooden stools or anything of that style. Once you pass the bar, you enter the main dining hall. Just as impressed. Awesome ambiance, very trendy, great seating, etc. When we sat down we instantly were greeted by the waiter/host and he explained how the process works: choose 4 menu items, family style. Two from the appetizer and two from the \"heavy\" section that is all protein based. Initially, first impression was great and I was very engaged in the experience.\n\nSomething throughout my experience did throw me off. Considering the bill is bound to be near $200 bucks on average for two people, I definitely didn't like that a few different waiters continued to ask me if they could clear up my plate (or did just try taking it without asking). It was a bit off-putting. Other than that, I thought every dish that was presented to my table looked incredible and was made with strong execution. You really can't go wrong ordering anything on the menu, and the experience will always be a fun one, especially if you're a first timer. The highlights for me: Stir fried lamb and the shrimp fried rice. Both were absolutely delicious!\n\nFinal verdict: The Progress doesn't quite match-up against it's counterpart, State Bird Provisions, but it does bring a new and fun place to have a different experience. The service is top notch, the food/execution is amazing and the vibe is very trendy. If you're looking for something new and unique, this place brings that.", "author": "Alex B."}

We were going to get in at State Bird Provisions (their sister restaurant next door) but in reading the reviews, made a last second decision to come here. And I mean last second. We secured an online reservation 6 minutes before our dining time and drove like Steve McQueen in Bullitt to get there.\n\nParking was a bear because there was a concert at The Fillmore next door so we were a little late but received a warm greeting. We loved the warm, confident vibe the staff put out the entire evening. \n\nEverything is served \"shared family style\" ($58  pp) and at the beginning, it feels like homework but our server was helpful in navigating things as we were given a checklist and a pencil and asked to select 4 of 13 items to share. The thing that struck us throughout the night is the amount of thoughtfulness that goes into every detail of the food and the presentation. Nothing is an accident. I find this hard to believe but our server said the menu changes every single day based on available ingredients. It seems like it would take a week to plan a menu like this.\n\nThey first brought out \"a few things for the table\" that included tasty bites like roasted brooks cherries with almond cream, radish with pistachio & rose petal spice, smoked pork loin with pickle and mustard, ahi tuna with green coriander vinaigrette as well as smashed curried peas on seven pepper cracker. It was all amazing. There are optional items you can get (oysters, pig's head charcuterie, caviar, scallops) but in my mind, \"a few things for the table\" was more than ample. \n\nWe ordered a couple of glasses of wine. They had a nice and varied wine list but next visit, we'll happily pay the $30 corkage and bring a nice bottle from home.\n\nOur four selected items were: \nLightly Smoked Wild King Salmon: Perfectly and smoked and served with english pea creamed morels. \n\nGrilled Spanish Octopus: Beautiful to look at and well-prepared with shell bean hummus, shaved fennel, toasted black rice and preserved lemon. We were trying to be a little adventurous and this wasn't our favorite (again, as with anything you put in your mouth here, it was excellent) and we were instantly regretting the decision to not get the Double Duck Broth with Dumplings.\n\nSpring Potatoes and Shiitake Mushrooms: When we ordered this, I thought it was a mistake because what can you do with a fingerling potato that's amazing. It turns out the answer is \"this.\"\n\nGrilled Llano Seco Pork: Served with crushed broccoli, tomatillo salsa verde and dried chilli-cumin oil, it was Lori's favorite.\n\nAll this great food, efficient yet breezy, hip service and a warm inviting dining room made this a night to remember.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-06-01", "description": "Nabbed reservations for The Progress after finding State Bird to be booked out through the end of time. I was super excited to try this place since the reviews sounded great, and small dishes are my jam. I did read some reviews that made me a little wary about possible issues with oversalting or inconsistency, but heey, James Beard can't be bad, right? Upon walking in, I was impressed by the decor--so beautiful, airy, serene. Unfortunately, service was woefully subpar, and while the ideas behind the dishes were commendable, the execution missed the mark on several occasions. We spent over $160 on a meal that probably warranted half that price at most based on the poor execution. \n\nFOOD:\n-Crispy Local Coonstripe Shrimp: Flavorless with uneven breading. This is similar to salt and pepper shrimp, which you can get at most random hole-in-the wall Chinese restaurants with much more flavor. At least these were nice and crispy, but that was all we could say about it. \n-Squid ink noodles: Probably the only redeeming dish out of the lot, but nothing special if you've ever had squid ink pasta. Flavor was good and we could not think of anything bad to say about it. \n-Quail egg roti: Not horrible, but not great. The eggs were cooked well. Felt like there was something lacking, like it needed a little more oomph. \n-BBQ Duck - The flavors in this dish were my favorite, and the texture was SO SO close to being great, but there was one major issue. The crispy rice was not really crispy--moreso hard. It tastes like what happens when you leave a bowl of rice out and it dries out and you try to eat it, and when you bite into it, it's hard, tough, gets stuck in your teeth, makes you concerned about breaking your teeth, and is entirely unpalatable. I take it they were going for more of a crispy texture like that nice crunch you get from the crispy crunchy crusty bits of the rice  along the stone bowl of bibimbap, and if the crunchy rice was executed better, this dish would have been a home run. The duck was soft, juicy, and seasoned well, and the combination of flavors in the dish were so good. However, when half of a $60 dish is not edible, it ruins the entire dish. \n\nSERVICE:\n-So I grew up in a culture where hole-in-the-wall restaurants run by terse employees is the norm. They get the job done, and they spare the frills and pleasantries. When I go to fancier places, I expect the service to be marignally better in that the service is friendly, but I don't expect them to be pulling out chairs for you, handing you your napkins, etc. So my standards are still pretty low. I go out to eat for the food. That said, the service here was so disappointing. The staff for the most part, did not seem enthused about their jobs. I didn't care much for our waiter, who had a bit of an attitude that he did not hide very well (we weren't loud and rowdy, didn't even bother him, didn't have any special or unusual requests, nor complain about anything, so it wasn't like this was called for). It took a very long time to ask for refills, get the check, etc. We also asked for a box for our leftovers as we got our check. He took the food and the check and later came back with the receipt to sign but no leftovers, so we waited. After 10 minutes or so, our waiter still did not come by our table, so we thought that maybe the leftovers would be waiting at the front podium. Nope. That said, with the overall experience being so lackluster, we just left without it. \n\nPRICE TO QUALITY: \n-The ideas are there, but they missed the mark on execution/delivery. Would have been happier paying half of what we did as a result, but even so, would not return. \n\nI did like the menu style though -- you filled in bubbles next to all the items you wanted, which solves the issue of trying to remember what 8 things your group wants to order at a small plates or tapas restaurant. \n\nOverall:\n2.5/5", "author": "Jenny B."}

But this isn't a review of SBP, it's a review of The Progress, a lively restaurant that's worthy of its own space in the restaurant universe.  \n\nMy 4-person party came here to celebrate a couple of birthdays which is always a good excuse to go for broke.  With a fixed price, \"pick 4 items for the table\" menu, The Progress  managed to leave one normally extravagant friend gasping at the end.  \"Somehow I wasn't expecting it to be that much\" she coughed, and I understood her reaction.  Our bill came in upwards of $450 despite the $58 per person fixed price.   \n\nHere's how we ran it up:  \n\n*  We brought one marvelous bottle of wine from home.  Many restaurants waive corkage when you go on to purchase wine from their list.  Not here: $30 corkage.;  \n\n*  The wine list is steeply priced.  We purchased one of the less expensive reds:  $65/bottle.;\n\n*  Fabulous Whipped Potato topped Caviar ($10/per) for each member of our party, a single Uni Guacamole ($13) shared among 4, a couple post-meal desserts, and espresso.  You can stick to the straight-up, fully satisfying $58 per person menu but you'll have a whole lot more fun if you throw in a lot of extras.  Money: you can't take it with you.; and\n\n*  Saying \"sure\" to the completely unnecessary upsell of \"filtered\" tap water (add $3 per person).  (Our Hetch Hetchy water is some of the finest out there; don't let this become some weird trend).\n\nLike SBP, The Progress is doing something unique with their offering.  The fixed price menu comes with an assortment of tastes/bites (about 5 little plates) to be shared.  It's a neat twist, enabling diners to more widely sample the kitchen's creations.  \n\nWhat you won't get to do is try everything on the menu.  With only 4 mains per table that'd take at least two visits.  \n\nThe Progress may be standing in the wide shadow of SBP but it needn't hang its head.  It's a fun, hot spot with joyful service, an intriguing concept, and really good food.", "author": "Tracey A."}

I just read an esquire magazine review on this being one of the 10 best new restaurants in the country. I came with good expectations.\n\nCool spot, and clean simple interior. Good service and overall good vibe.\n\nThe plates were super creative. \n\nMy issue with this restaurants was that all of he plates tasted the same. They created a finishing oil, that was a bit tangy with a Thai like flavor that they put on everything.. So I had 4 large dishes and 4 small dishes and 5 or 6 of them had the exact same flavor profile. If you finished them differently I think it would be much better.\n\nI think I would like to come back after the restaurant matures a bit and keeps some favorites on the menu as well as the seasonal rotation\n\nCheck it out for yourself and I hope you enjoy!", "author": "Kev M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-14", "description": "One of SF's most famous culinary adventures is to navigate through the dinner menu at the Progress. Five set appetizers, four dishes out of thirteen mains the table collectively picks and any additionally priced drinks, sides and desserts. This adventure starts from $58/person. On my first visit back to SF since I moved back to SD the No1DP and another friend/fellow Yelper David W. partook this adventure. This is our story.\n\nPre-trip: Another fellow friend/Yelper was supposed to join us but couldn't make it the day of the dinner. This was immediately solved through a phone call as due to the fame there would be guaranteed walk-ins, so no penalty for us. \n\nThe Setting: David made the reservations for 5:30pm dinner on Saturday. The Progress is located next door to SBP. There's a bar area that takes walk-ins (with a different ruleset for walk-in diners), a main dining hall and more \"private\" dining options on the mezzanine floor. It was less crowded and noisy than its more famous neighbor. As for our waitress she navigated us through our meal though she also had help when the dishes were being passed. \n\nDrinks\nMe: Great Mana (mezcal, aged rum, banana, coconut, lime, bitters)\nDavid: Sunny Jim (gin, lemon, vanilla, pineapple, kaffir lime leaf, soda)\nNo1DP: The Cutthroat (mezcal, tequila, fino sherry, vermouth, bitters, absinthe)\nWe all got drinks based on our preferences. No1DP definitely got a sipper and was too strong for David and I. David got a sweet, refreshing drink that wouldn't interfere with his tastebuds. I got a drink that was mixed quite well, which meant that the alcohol strength was hidden by the high-quality ingredients. I paced myself to have my drink last the entire meal. \n\nA Few Things - all are included in the pricing.\n- Barhi dates with hazelnut crema\n- Buttermilk biscuits with apple bourbon black butter\n- Little gem hearts with curried yogurt\n- Smoked mackerel dip with black rice crackers\n- Tofu & peanut pesto\nThe appetizers have little bites that number the amount of guests. The No1DP's favorite appetizer was the buttermilk biscuits while David and I most enjoyed the smoked mackerel dip. The crackers were full of umami, which increased with the creamy fish dip. The lettuce was fresh and the curry flavor was weak. We could taste more of the tofu than the pesto, though the flavor and texture combination work. No1DP loved how the butter made the biscuit, I thought there was nothing special about the apple butter. \n\nOur Menu - the significant feature is that it is served family-style and the dishes are scalable per the number of guests.\n- Sunchoke Roti (pleasant ridge reserve, ranch & grating of black truffle)\n- Zuckerman's Asparagus (smoked Alaskan king salmon, creme fraiche & shaved cucumber)\n- So-Cal Swordfish (pistachio 'crema' & green olive-mandarin relish)\n- Grilled Llano Pork Shoulder (sunflower seed sambal, marinated baby carrots & gem lettuce cups)\nOverall we picked okay - there were some good qualities about each dish but no dish stood out in particular nor did we were blown away by our choices. Each dish was plated beautifully. We were impressed by the quality of the meats, in particular how the swordfish was seared just right and how the pork shoulder tasted like it was marinated in lemon. We enjoyed making the pork shoulder into our own version of lettuce wraps and we asked for extra sambal as it added a peanut-like flavor to the meat. I liked eating my swordfish with the mandarin slice so it adds a sweet flavor. Veggies on the asparagus dish were so small as it was hard to pick up with a fork. I liked the ranch on the roti as it made the bread less dry. \n\nDesserts - these are $10 each and are portioned individually.\n- Deluxe Vanilla Bean Ice Cream (chocolate ganache roasted dates, trufflebert hazelnuts, nocino)\n- Pistachio Stack Cake (mascarpone cream, raspberry jam, kumquats)\nWe were pleasantly surprised with the dessert options and honestly if I had to pick a favorite dish of the night it would be the pistachio cake. The cake itself was very soft and I loved how the pistachio and the wafer-like shavings added a crunch to the cake. LOVED how the mascarpone kept the cake together. I also liked the ice cream though the No1DP liked the chocolate-covered dates. David got a house soda and got everyone hooked as it tasted like a crisp and clean Sprite. \n\nEpilogue: My actual rating is 3.5, rounded up. I'm rounding up because nobody thought there was nothing particularly bad about any dish. I can say good things about every dish. What prevents me from giving this place 5 stars was that all of us had an exceptional experience dining at SBP (me, twice) and considering that SBP is my favorite restaurant in all of SF and how that hype extends to the Progress our party wasn't blown away by any dish. I would still recommend this restaurant as one of the great dining experiences SF has to offer but unlike SBP it doesn't warrant a repeat visit as there are plenty more restaurants to go through.", "author": "Isabella B."}

(Wines are a bit obscure, bit I didn't drink that night so I won't comment.)\n\nHere's what we ate:\n\nPotato-caviar thing was delicious but tiny.\n\nGrilled radishes were surprisingly good, especially the green tops.\n\nJapanese Salad and the Autumn Salad were each amazing. Impossible to describe properly, let's just say each had a remarkable character and personality, seasoned perfectly, and we fought over the last bites.\n\nSquid ink pasta w/ Kale was almost life-changingly good. Briny, tangy, the noodles were perfect, I'm going to be dreaming about that dish for a long time.\n\nChickpea dumpings: unusual, super tasty, a little gummy. That dill topping just made the dish so good.\n\nCauliflower and chicories: flavorful and innovative - even the cauliflower hater at our table loved it.\n\nQuail meatballs - a delicious and well-composed dish. The actual meat wasn't quite as succulent as it could have been, but the sauce and garnishes saved it.\n\nBlack cod: Very delicious, even if it was less surprising than the rest of the menu.\n\nOne big miss (and I hope they're reading this because the server didn't seem to take our feedback seriously): the octopus and lamb shank dish. There was real potential for greatness with the sauce they chose. But sadly, the octopus was unpleasantly salty and chewier than a fine restaurant should let it be. I know what amazing tender octopus should be like and I tend to associate rubbery octopus with cheap joints. So this was a $32 miss. (Also the lamb was overcooked. Lamb shank should be silky and this was dry.)\n\nDessert: So full we could only share one: Apple cake with huckleberry sauce - we almost licked the plate. Peanut milk OF COURSE.\n\nFull disclosure: we did not try the large platters of proteins, just the regular sized ones)(\nThe food was timed really well. Everything seemed to arrive promptly and there were no moments of waiting around. Courses were grouped and paced perfectly.\n\nValue was OK. About $100/person before drinks. So it's squarely in the expensive category. The decor was cool, but hardly fancy. The service was good, but not quite up to snuff. A lot of the fancy handmade plates were chipped, and not in an intentional way. Portion sizes are not large, so take your server's advice on how many things to select.\n\nOverall quite an enjoyable meal. Interesting without being overly strange, each dish was exciting and unexpected. If they could tighten up the details it would be truly extraordinary.", "author": "Al M."}

I have to admit, from reading reviews, it felt sorta like we were only allowed reservations to the \"red headed step child\" of their next door neighbor State Bird. I wasn't expecting to be wowed and I think going in with little expectations can always work out in the favor of a legit good restaurant. \n\nWe walked around like the tourists we were for a second, trying to find their sign. **Hint* There isn't one, don't look like a tourist. \n\nUpon entry you immediately notice this place had some thought put in to it. The design was beautiful and don't even get me started on the badass glitter bathrooms...The only people I felt sorry for were the ones who were next to us tucked away in the only corner spot. They seemed to have trouble maneuvering their way to the bathroom. \n\nOn to the food, it's legit y'all. When we order here in Austin one of my favorite things to do at a \"shared plates\" establishment is to just leave it up to the waiter. Say \"pick your favorite\" and every dish is a sweet sweet surprise; they know best, right? Unfortunately, we were not guided in this direction and it almost seemed as if the waiter wouldn't have had time to do it anyway. He gave us 3 suggestions and we took one (which didn't disappoint, by the way). \n\nAfter some long and intense decision making, we narrowed it down and were quickly brought a plate of appetizers. I can't even tell you what they were...maybe one was a strawberry with mole? Either way, all of it was delicious and we got super pumped for what was about to go down. Each dish brought out  made our bellies and hearts fulfilled. We had ended our lovely vacation with the best meal we could have hoped for. \n\nIt's not cheap, but food that well thought out shouldn't be.

It all started off well, we were 15 minutes late to our reservation due to rush hour traffic and they were extremely accommodating. When they took the reservation, they asked what occasion we were celebrating and noted that it was a birthday. However, once we were seated, the whole thing took a nosedive due to our server. She was not very friendly and probably checked on us once during the two hour meal. When we finished our food, she offered the dessert menu. We wanted to order at least two things, but she took 20 minutes to get back to us and we were already late for our next engagement and we had to leave without dessert. On top of that, we noticed the table next to us celebrating an anniversary got complimentary champagne and another table across the room got birthday desserts, but we did not get the same level of detailed attention.\n\nThe food and drinks were good but not spectacular.

I like the menu/family style dining format, too. IMHO, this restaurant's food is a lot better than its sister restaurant next door.\n\nMost recent experience was a few days ago on a Saturday night, had reservations at 5:30pm and arrived on time, seated immediately. Waitress was friendly and outgoing, introduced us to their new menu format ($58 each person, family style) which you choose 4 dishes (instead of the previous format where you choose 6 but snacks are not as substantial). A bunch of small dishes will be served before your chosen four, and you can add some other items that's listed at the top of the menu if you wish. \n\nFOOD/DRINKS\nCA STURGEON POTATO CLOUD- $10 each, we ordered one per person. Worth it. The potato cloud is actually a super fully mashed potato-like 'cloud' and the caviar is hidden within, along with some crispies that tasted like potato chip crumbs. Very delicious.\n5 SNACKS- 1. dates: very very good dates, small bite size, served with hazelnut crema and made me want more 2. Roasted carrots with curried yogurt: nicely cooked and nice Indian curry flavor 3. Coppa with chili powder: thinly sliced, bite size, nice salty/spicy snack 4. Buttermilk biscuits: buttery and flaky, so delicious with the apple bourbon black butter 5. Yuba with curry pumpkin: light refreshing dish, pumpkin seeds add nice flavor and texture\nCHIOGGIA BEET SALAD- delicious salad with crunchy quinoa, beets are sweet and yuzu vinaigrette refreshing \nDOUBLE DUCK BROTH- served in individual bowls, includes two duck/foie gras dumplings, mushrooms, turnips, veggies; a very flavorful and rich duck broth that is delicious. Japanesey flavor/style, and quite a large amount. I was feeling full after this course and have two more to go excluding dessert\nNORTHERN CA BLACK COD- cooked perfectly, just done, crispy and salty on the outside, tender in the inside. I enjoyed the blood orange relish and charred cabbage with it\nBN RANCH BEEF- beef was cooked nicely, though I thought could use more seasoning like black paper. Served with butternut squash and Brussel sprouts. The least impressive dish of the night\nPOMELO ICE CREAM- recommended by a staff and I do love pomelo so was very excited to try this. Not as good as I had hoped, served with earl grey cream and rye crepes. Crepes could have been better\nPISTACHIO STACK CAKE- brought over with a lit candle for our bday celebration. It looks heavy, but actually tasted quite light and was sooo good! Loved the combination of flavors. Definitely would've eaten more if I wasn't so full already\nSEMILLON white wine- half bottle to share, recommended by waitress and nicely complimented our food\n\nSERVICE/STAFF- waitress was great, very helpful and cheerful. Checked on us from time to time, food came out in a timely manner and we were paying the bill at around 7:15pm. The ONLY little thing is that we were charged the pistachio cake even tho we didn't order it, and they brought it over with a lit candle. So we actually thought it was a generous gesture from the restaurant. However, since we really enjoyed the cake and the entire experience that night, we didn't feel like there is a problem paying for it. \n\nAMBIANCE/DECOR- I like the high ceiling and open space with wooden tables and chairs. We were seated in a booth so it was cozy but the table was still plenty big, so big that the waitress explained that we would be asked to pass down our plates/utensils for her throughout the meal. That's fine because I prefer more space for our plates and to sit more comfortably! Bar seating is available near the entrance for folks without reservations. \n\nBill came out to be about $100 per person and we were all full and very satisfied, even had leftover- boxed half of our beef home (otherwise wouldn't of been able to eat dessert!).

The pig ears were crunchy and smoky, but I thought the texture was a little too hard and chewy. And I didn't really like the smokiness of the cauliflower. I wanted something to contrast the pig ears. Not just more smokiness. This dish was a little too one note for me. The treasure chest was okay. I enjoyed the broth, but it felt like this dish was trying to be both light and strong at the same time. The delicate mousse was fighting the strong fermented sausage flavor. I felt like this dish was having an identity crisis.\n\nI want to come back and have a full on meal here. Two dishes isn't really enough to judge them on their food.

The space is roomier and seating is more comfortable.  And reservations are actually possible. \n\nFor $62, you get to select 4 dishes, which come with complimentary amuse bouche to start.  You also have the option of additional dishes with their own prices.  Do not skip this section.\n\nFresh oysters with nori.  Never had fresh oysters with nori.

Therefore, I went to The Progress with high expectations but an open mind, knowing the concept would be different.\n\nDRINKS:\nWe got drinks while waiting for our table to be ready. This was the highlight of the night. AWESOME cocktails. I got the The Mezzanine (mezcal, house banana liqueur, allspice, lime, nocino). Being on a mezcal kick from Mexico a week earlier, I thoroughly enjoyed this smokey concoction. I also tried the King's Crossing (rye, calvados, mulling spice, lemon, egg white, cider). Woah, tasted like delicious spiked apple cider. During dinner, I enjoyed a chardonnay and prie blanc. They had a short, but varied wine by the glass selection. Impressive bottle selection.\n\nFOOD:\nAmuse Bouche - beef jerky, fried oyster, something with trout I believe, and cheese crackers. Great presentation and strong flavors. Off to a great start!\n\nSmoked duck w/ marinated yellowfoot mushrooms & dried plum - I insisted on ordering this, as I love the duck pancakes at State Bird. Unfortunately this was very disappointing. I have to agree with the reviewer that said this tasted like bologna. I couldn't finish it.\n\nPorcini & mt. tam dumpling w/ nettle salsa verde - Not bad, enjoyed the cheese filling, but too much dough to filling ratio.\n\nPercorino roti w/ black truffle buttermilk - How do you mess up roti? Soggy and the truffle was barely detectable. \n\nTreasure chest of fermented sausage, trout quenelles, pumpkin-rice dumpling in pork broth - My favorite dish of the meal. Delicious broth, loved the sausage and pumpkin dumplings. Trout quenelles was so-so.\n\nDungeness crab, bok choi, tofu stir fry - Ick. Barely any crab, tofu was bland and had an off putting taste. And I like tofu! - plain, fried, stinky, dried...but not this tofu.\n\nWild mushrooms w/ pickled local nori & kale - Bland. Lacked cohesiveness.\n\nThe meal wasn't a total flop, but it was disappointing and left me unsatisfied. The food sounded great on the menu but all lacked one thing or another in the execution.\n\nOther notes:\n-Good service in both the bar area and at dinner. Enthusiastic, helpful, and great all around.\n-They serve the full menu a la carte at the bar.\n-We had our own two top, but some tables were communal style.\n-Very beautiful, well-designed space. Custom chairs, tables, lighting. And the bathroom had fun colorful toilet paper.\n-No, I did not get a second dinner.", "author": "Adrienne H."}

Summary: good, creative, well-crafted cocktails - and the bar is definitely cheaper than the restaurant.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what's up with 4 $ signs because the bar absolutely is just normal bar prices, and from what I could see of the menu, that ain't quite the full story. But, looking at the pictures from others, maybe the dishes are small and you need to order more than one? I'm not sure. YMMV, but it SEEMS like you might be able to get out without an insane bill if you're judicious. \n\nAnyway, we stopped by here for some cocktails while waiting on a table at a nearby restaurant. They have some really solid, inventive cocktails at slightly-higher-than typical prices ($10-15, which I don't think is too bad for the premium stuff). I especially loved their tropical/tiki-inspired drink, but there were several good options. I wouldn't mind coming back here from time to time to try the full set.

It's right next to its sister restaurant, State Bird Provisions, with the same unassuming facade.  Once you step in, you're whisked away into married chefs Stuart Brioza's and Nicole Krasinski's world -- and we're fortunate transients to enjoy it!\n\nSERVICE:\nThe staff was very accommodating from start to finish. We didn't have any reservations, but their friendly host was able to seat us promptly. Every member of the staff who served us -- from the sommelier to dining room attendants -- were top-notch.  \n\nLOCATION:\nThe modern industrial look of the dining room was hip and haute.  Everything was well thought of, including the swanky bathrooms wrapped in gold wallpaper and linoleum.  Loved the open space and open kitchen, which made up for the tight bar seating.  \n\nFOOD:\nLove their take on \"family-style\" dining, which allowed us to try 6 spectacular dishes from their innovative menu.  We started with an appetizer platter compliments of the chef (I couldn't call it an \"amuse bouche\" because it was hefty!), then our dishes were served in 3 waves.  We chose 3 from the top \"lighter\" menu, and 3 \"heavy\" dishes, and were pretty satisfied and full at the end of it:\n\n* pig fries with shaved cauliflower and herbs (the clear standout of the meal!)\n* pecorino roti with perigold truffle buttermilk (fluffy and delicious!)\n* raw japanese snapper with turnips and creme fraiche (light and refreshing)\n* lamb merguez with octopus and crispy squid (a hearty and delightful stew)\n* lobster with bokchoy and tofu (stir-fried and seasoned perfectly)\n* spiced squab with chili paste (crispy skin and tender succulent meat!)\n\n\nWe expected nothing less from the James Beard honorees, and at $65 per person, this was a very satisfying 5* meal.  If you're not up for a big dinner, you can also try smaller versions of their dishes a la carte at the bar.  Their menu changes seasonally, so we'll definitely be back!", "author": "Dawne L."}

Only trouble was when he told me it was only $57 for two dinners, one extra app, two cocktails and a glass of wine.  I had to break the news that they'd left off a \"1\" or possibly a \"2\" in front of that, haha.  Turns out they'd accidentally only brought us the bar tab, which was perhaps slightly high in my opinion, but all in all we ate some good food.\n\nStarting with the five little amuses bouches:\n\nbahri dates with hazelnut crema- a little underwhelming, the crema was very light on flavor, and the date had an out of character softness\n\n roasted carrots with curried yogurt-mahvelous, for those of us fascinated with miniatures, these were the tiniest carrots I've ever seen, but they were sweet and earthy and the yogurt had the silkiest texture\n\nfish fry with kimchi tartar sauce- very good, tiny crispy fresh little fishies with a knockout tartar, just the right balance of tart, pickly, and mayonnaise-eness\n\nMaple slow cooked bacon- this was perfectly cooked with a good meaty chew and crisp fat.  I'm not a big maple fan, otherwise this would have been a knockout\n\nWe got one optional starter for an extra $10, which was a lime foam with crispy potatoes and caviar.  I got it for the caviar, which was almost nonexistent.  I would pass on this next time.\n\nHere are the four selections we made:\n\nsteak tartare, truffle aioli, shaved kohlrabi& buttermilk crackers:  Very well executed.  the chop wasn't too fine. ( I hate when it's like ground beef.)  The truffle aioli was  exquisite.  I've never thought truffles were all they're cracked up to be (even though I'm a total fungiphile), but this lived up to the hype.  This is a must order\n\nrustic pork, seaweed & clam broth shungiku, yuba & potato:  Again an incredible dish the broth had such deep flavor from the clam and pork combo, with just a hint of heat.  The bowl it was served in made it a little awkward to eat, though, and each of us had an unopened clam.  When you only get about 5 of them, it's not right if you get one punk\n\ndevil's gulch rabbit smoked prune romesco, guanciale, roasted turnips & chicories - all I can say on this one, is I wish there were more.  With only two petite pieces of rabbit, we didn't really get to know the flavor very well\n\ncrispy squid and octopus with merquez sausage - we loved the cephalopods, but the sausage was quite dry and therefore not that tasty.  I don't know if it was house made, but it definitely needed more fat.\n\nThe service was a bit spotty.  The layout of tables for two, with some of them of them placed right at the edge of the larger booths was just plain weird.  We were seated in one of those initially adjacent to a table with 5 five young, very loud women.  Fortunately we moved and though packed in pretty tight on the wall of two tops, it was quieter.  We quickly made friends with our neighbors when their Virgin Sunny Jim got delivered to my husband, instead of his non virgin one.  I already mentioned the bill snafu, which our waiter handled gracefully.  I think at one point or another we were served by every server in the house.  I don't care for this type of free for all arrangement, because it's hard to know who's point person when you need something.  However after some initial confusion, we adapted.  I would definitely go back.  Lots of things I'd like to try.  Biggest negative, TOO EFFING LOUD.  They need to put in some sound absorbing materials\n\nFood:  37/40\nService:  16/20\nAtm/Intang:  14/20  for noise and seating arrangements\nValue:  19/20\nOverall: 89/100   doesn't quite make it to the fifth star, maybe next time", "author": "Diane B."}

While I don't regret it, it confirms to me that I think both of these places are overhyped...\n\nWe were able to make reservations quite easily since you have to provide a credit card to reserve online, and this filters out all those bots and flaky people who aren't sure. I showed up about 20 minutes late for my reservation (my bad) but they were ok to still seat us as long as we finished in about an hour - ok with me, I can eat fast!! Service was great, and the staff all around was friendly. \n\nYou get a menu and you have to choose which of the dishes you want for the pre-fixe dinner. On top of this, you get a few smaller bites at the beginning of your meal. Of the ones we got, my favorite was the creamed morels on a cracker, and the tuna. The tiny adorable buttermilk biscuits with the apple butter were also really good.\n\nFor our mains we had the halibut ceviche, grits, garlic fried rice, and pork \"tacos\" (it was sort of like a deconstructed vietnamese sandwich minus the carbs). The ceviche was really fresh - this was probably my favorite, so we were off to a great start! Then came the grits - pretty buttery, surrounded by crispy greens and poached eggs - this was solid. The deconstructed Vietnamese sandwich I found funny, because I'm fairly certain I've had the same thing at a Vietnamese restaurant for only a couple of bucks, but this was way fancier - deconstructed, and on a plate and everything! And I got to assemble it myself! Tastewise, it was fine but I wasn't really impressed. Finally, we had our garlic fried rice. Mind you, I wasn't expecting much since it was just simply labeled as garlic fried rice. The garlic fried rice was fine I suppose on its own, but we couldn't finish it. There was something spicy in it and we couldn't tell what it was, and then the squid was really mushy and gross tasting. I'm sure that's the way it was supposed to be, but I wasn't prepared for it and it kind of threw off the whole meal since that's what we finished with. \n\nThe progress just wasn't for me, but I can see how others may think otherwise.", "author": "Lily C."}

I was surprised since they open at 5:30 and in less than 15 mins it was a full house with patrons already waiting for a table. The host was friendly and sat us right away. \n\nAs a mom of a toddler it's often difficult to go to a \"nice\" restaurant these days. I quoted nice because anything other than our usual Japanese weekday lunch special is a treat. The Progress on my nice scale was beyond what I've had in awhile. My mother-in-law was in town and it was her idea to try this place. It's not exactly \"kid-friendly\" but they do have high chairs and my daughter was a perfect angel. As long as she has some munchies she's great at restaurants. The dress code is casual but I'm leaning more towards smart casual as 90% of the people there were trendy and appeared to be on a date. When I return, I'll certainly leave the little one at home. \n\nWe tried the fried rice, wild mushroom & farro spezzato, roti and beef. Every dish delivered unique flavors throughout but my favorite was the beef. Perfectly cooked and complemented nicely with brussel sprouts and squash. I somehow managed to make room for dessert and tried a more savory option. The manchego cheese melted on puff pastry topped with Asian pear and honeycomb was a delightful finish.

It was super comfortable and warm. Second, I loved that you got to choose. Often with price fixed meals there are one or two things that just aren't your thing. So it was nice to choose 4 things from a pretty long list of options. We went for the crudo (amazing! it had an avocado whip that was so silky and so flavorful), octopus, mushroom+potato, and cod (awesome -- the sauce, as the server put it, was drinkable). They also start you with 4 appetizers -- all were excellent. We added an extra thing -- sourdough pancake with quail eggs and truffles. This felt very decadent, but was so tasty -- a great way to start the meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-16", "description": "Stepping off Fillmore and into The Progress was a beautiful surprise.  The two story shiny ceilings, light wood slat walls, very nice but not pretentious.  They said the restaurant serves \"family style\" but I would call it \"small plates\" or a small serving for one because to me the other infers larger portions.  I've had their other restaurant on my radar for some time but haven't gotten in yet so my expectations were a midnight burger may be in order after the concert but that wasn't the case.  What I didn't realize is it also the other restaurant is dim sum style and even here your menu was a checklist for the staff so multiple people delivered your dishes.  There were some great dishes, some OK dishes and one I just couldn't really get past visually or audibly.  She suggested a party of two have 4-6 dishes so we ordered two salads; \"gently smoked raw tuna charred jalapeno buttermilk winter radishes and ground pine nuts\" and \"roasted beet & puntarelle salad with pistachio anchovy bogna cuda\".  The dishes were beautifily plated, with a few bites of rare tuna and pine nuts were the best I've ever tasted.  I don't know why they seemed so much better, maybe it was toasting.  The three small different color beets cut in half, wasn't much to share but I was happy with these choices.  Next was our \"entr\u00e9e\" but the \"grilled Monterey bay abalone with celery root-black truffle butter broccoli shoot 'salad' was a third salad and unfortunately the 2 small slices of abalone were grilled black and a bit rubbery.  Abalone had been on my list to try which is why we came here.  The $36 dollar price seemed like a reasonable price since I have heard abalone is priced more like lobster but when I saw the portion and plating as a salad topper I understood the price wasn't actually low for a salad.  I wouldn't order this again.  Maybe I don't like abalone or maybe it was just over cooked.   Hubby not a fan of truffle so he didn't even like the salad dressing.  I'll pass on this if we return.  The \"mushroom & beef short rib ragout with smoked potato, pickled onion and farm egg was EXCELLENT, we would have just preferred to have much more of it and not share.  Everything about this dish was tasty and it was cheaper than the abalone but more filling.  A last minute decision sent me back to the \"pig fries with chili aioli & pecorino\".  Unfortunately I couldn't get past the fact that they were pig ears.  They were cut into strips like fries, tasted like pork rinds and  greasy but the white line down each fry was the deal breaker.  I ate a few, more than hubby but we left some on the plate and that isn't like us, especially with \"small plates\".  The biggest disappointment was the drinks.  I am always testing new drink recipes at home, buying different boozes or making my own mixers so when at a fancy place I like to try a signature cocktail.  Campari was on my grocery list to start testing with but if I can't make something better than this drink it is off the list.  It was the Negroni Thyme with Thyme Gin, Campari and cocchi; It was VERY sweet, syrupy in fact, bitter as expected but all one note, cloyingly sweet and I said I didn't like sweet drinks but the only other gin drink seemed like it would be sweater, Sunny Gin.  Now I can't see how.  The vodka martini my husband ordered was also a looser, although I saw the rosemary oil bubbles on top all you tasted was the vermouth and liking a dry martini this didn't work.  He tried a regular martini next which was much better.  They need another vodka drink besides a martini.  We don't always have dessert but I wanted the full experience and the peanut butter shot was interesting, it tasted like thin peanut butter milk, OK but one and done.  The earl gray donut holes were very tasty served with a red berry and chocolate chunk ice cream.  Since the menu is dated I assume it changes often if not daily so I'll check the menu periodically since we are in the area a lot but at over $200 it won't be a place we frequent but you always need a special occasion place.", "author": "Dianne M."}

As for The Progress, it's the most talked about restaurant opening in SF this year from the wildly popular, State Bird Provisions. \n\nCurrently, it's reservations only for the dining area. The bar has a tiny alcove for 4 diners with a limited food menu. I was a \"refresh\" maniac for the last 4 days so I was lucky enough to snag reservations when they went live on OpenTable on Tuesday; the same day as their grand opening. \n\nThe Progress' menu is Californian/New American and is served family-style. Items are available a la carte or choose any 6 courses for $65, and pay an extra $10 pp for each add'l course: http://bit.ly/1z10K6n. We choose to create our own tasting menu with 9 courses ($95 pp) and were full by the third course so I highly recommend coming in a large group so you can sample everything. \n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\n*Amuse Bouche/\"Snacks\": Radish, Smoked Trout, Lop Cheong (Chinese sausage) & Broccoli Tempura: http://bit.ly/1z10K6n\n*Dried Duck w/ smoked prune romesco & almond: http://bit.ly/1C3ksEC\n*Shaved Cauliflower-Herbs & Pig Fries: http://bit.ly/1wmcjYI\n*Sunchoke, Rosemary & Smoked Cured Egg Roti: http://bit.ly/1zzZAl2\n*Spicy Dungeness Crab Ricotta Cavatelli: http://bit.ly/1zA52Wn\n*Smoked Black Cod Fried Rice w/ squid & chrysanthemum: http://bit.ly/1DQph6g\n*Lamb Scallopini w/ pea shoots & cipollini: http://bit.ly/13D5dV5\n*Aromatic Spiced Squab w/ salted chili paste: http://bit.ly/1C373N1\n*Grilled BN Beef w/ mustard-miso oyster sauce: http://bit.ly/1xsmZ9X\n*Persimmon Sorbet w/ gingered-coconut floating island & candied buddha's hand: http://bit.ly/1wPqog5\n\nI adored the quad of amuse bouches (\"snacks\" which was a great indicator of the great things to come. The smoked trout was so addictive that I could have annihilated an entire bowl of it. \n\nFor the appetizers, the standouts were the Shaved Cauliflower with pig fries and Dried Duck. The pig ears were gelatinously crunchy and really gave a delicious texture contrast to the cauliflower. The prosciutto-like Dried Duck was sublime when wrapped around the baby potato croquettes. \n\nThe Roti was carbliciously flaky with the smoked cured egg giving it an assertive saltiness. Make sure to eat this while it's still hot! We weren't too fond of the Crab Cavatelli as the tomato sauce overpowered the crab meat. Didn't like the green beans that were mixed in either.\n\nA must order, the Black Cod Fried Rice was aromatic and complex both in flavor and texture from the tempura calamari. Another must order is the squab, it was nicely spiced and uber tender. The salted chili paste reminded me of gochujang but much, much better. While the lamb was also perfectly tender, it could have used a sauce to tie everything together. My least favorite was the BN Beef which was a tad chewy. The mustard-miso oyster sauce sounded great on paper but I found it a bit funky tasting.\n\nAt this point, we needed to lay our muffin tops onto a flatbed to roll out of the restaurant but luckily dessert was refreshing and light.  A genius exotic combo, the persimmon sorbet and meringue-like floating island and candied buddha's hand was perfect for someone like me who doesn't care for sugary sweets but craves a little something sweet to end a multi-course dinner.\n\nOh and I can't forget about the cocktails.

The concept of The Progress is interesting and appealing (set menu of 4 courses served family style, with many options for dishes), but the flavor and execution of nearly every dish left a lot to be desired.\n\nFirst ordered oysters, their flavor and delicate texture overpowered by a tangle of chewy seaweed. Why is seaweed necessary when oysters naturally taste of the sea? Then came the small dishes - a curried pea dip ended up being the most delicious bite we had all night.\n\nA pea-nettle-ham cavatelli was oversalted and overpowered by the very smoky ham, to the point where the other components of the dish were just irrelevant. Duck broth with duck dumpling and morels was too salty to eat and enjoy, and with minuscule pieces of duck this felt a little half-hearted (and sad that the morels could not be tasted). Octopus with preserved lemon, chili, crunchy black rice, and herbs was the only good dish of the night, though again there was a problem with too much salt in the preserved lemon sauce which dotted the plate. The final dish, pork with tomatillo, broccoli, and chili oil, simply did not work. The pork itself was bland and gamey, and the flavor combinations which seemed to attempt an Asian-Californian-Latin fusion were not successful.\n\nFor the price paid ($58 pp), I expected a lot better. It seems like the space would be nice for a drink, as the design of the restaurant is gorgeous (lots of open space and curved wood everywhere, lending a warmth and coziness to an otherwise expansive space), and their house Mai tai with fresh nutmeg and peanut is delicious, but I'd skip the food.", "author": "Alexi K."}

It was our second visit and not disappointed at all.\n\nWe ordered different dishes from our first visit and were very pleased.  \n\nAsparagus with lime pickle yogurt & pistachio - The asparagus was so tender and sweet, which paired nicely with the lime pickle yogurt and the crunchiness from the pistachio.....yum!\n\nTomato curry 'roti' with ricotta & fava hummus - The only downside to this dish is that you get one roti...wish they provided more!\n\nTempura baby favas with manchego - OMG!  This was sooo good!  I was a bit skeptical to eat a tempura fava pod, but...it was very tender  with a nice crunch on the outside.  The cheese made such great flavor with a touch of sundried tomatoes on top.....Definitely a must if it's on the menu....\n\nWood oven roasted morels & smoke hollandaise - Smokey indeed!  Although there were loads of flavor from the morels...it was a bit smokey and needed something else to compliment it.....we ended up eating it with the potatoes from our other dish....\n\nPolpette of guinea hen & pork with blood orange & castelvetranos - As far as protein goes, this was a tasty one!  Lots of different flavors from the polpette which played nicely with the blood orange & castelvetranos olives as well as the potatoes....\n\nAromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste - Loved the aromatic spices on the squab as well as the chili paste...but was not a fan of the squab itself...there was not flavor....luckily for the spices, otherwise, it would have just been bland....\n\nOverall...a definite must for all you foodies!

I reached out directly to the restaurant first in an attempt to resolve our issue but after a number of emails I started to feel that they were more focused on throwing a bone than truly taking responsibility.\n\nI would stay away from the squab!\n\nHere is what I emailed the restaurant staff the day after:\n------------------------------------------------\nTo the management of The Progress,\n\nYesterday I hosted a dinner at your restaurant for important business associates who flew in for that day, my wife, and a friend who made the reservation. The service was great and a few of dishes we ordered were also very nice. We finished the main course with the squab, and in all honesty, half of the people at the table found it highly unpalatable (i had to spit out my first bite into a napkin). We left the restaurant with a highly unsatisfying feeling and quite literally a bad taste in our mouths.\n\nI would typically write this experience off, but what followed next very much cemented my determination to contact you instead. Out of the 5 people in our party, 3 including myself did not feel well last night and two did not sleep at all. This is not something that one would expect from a decent restaurant serving good food - much less one that is top rated and bills $700 for that said dinner. I am still not feeling well and wanted to reach out to make you were aware of the situation. I look forward to your response and give you the opportunity to remedy this experience.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nI was offered $100 by the restaurant for the squab dish but felt that it did not reflect correctly the responsibility they needed to take - in my opinion a full refund was well deserved since the whole dinner was ruined by what followed - not one dish. After I made that know to the restaurant they did not refund anything or respond further.\n\nTake it for what you will, but this city is so full of amazing restaurants that know the value of customers and know how to take responsibility when something goes wrong, why would you go to this one?", "author": "Leo S."}

The menu is simple and straightforward. A few \"complimentary\" dishes to start, then choose 4 (or more a la carte) entree-style dishes as mains and finish with dessert, if desired. We went with the Mackerel Citrus Salad, Escarole and Octopus, Blackened Cod, Garlic Fried Rice, and the Lamb Ribs. The set provided well rounded flavors, albeit on the heavier side. We opted to order one more dish a la carte and it was the right call. Overall, the food was delicious, but I wish there was more flexibility to serve the food at the same time. Would have liked to eat the ribs with the rice.\n\nDrink: We opted for a glass of the Zinfandel and were not disappointed. I then ordered an old fashioned and it was delicious as well. I'd like to explore their selection a bit more next time, but it seems like they're on the right track.\n\nService: Great and helpful staff. Not a ton of conversation, but that's okay since we were more interested in the food. Explaining the food and what's on the plate is always a nice touch. Multiple people were involved in serving our table and they were attentive.\n\nAmbiance: The Progress has a casual refined feeling. It's great for those who want to experience finer dining, but in a relaxed setting. The decor and disarming and warm so you'll feel right at home.\n\nWe'll definitely be back to try some of the more seasonal fares.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-09", "description": "After the advent of their innovative State Bird Provisions, the chef and his wife, best known for their work at Rubicon, opened this next incarnation of their dining style.  Our kind and generous host scored us a reservation on a recent weeknight.  His wife couldn't make it so the three of us composed the following meal which comes family style:\n\nAmuse bouche (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=eWhbF7rRdz831xdmqr9lkg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Can't remember the exact ingredients but there was a variety of flavors in different forms.   \n\n1) Chanterelle-crescenza 'panzanella' with quince and saba (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uVQv1STiV8E8jRsh92Ovmw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - My recollection is panzanella is a bread salad in Italian cuisine.  Flavors were good but, not reading the menu, would not be able to identify this dish.\n\n2) Potato-sauerkraut dumpling with 'fall flavor' plum preserves (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JmNLjmEaDHf74dVjffF6mA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Intriguing mix of flavors as described on the menu, the tone of this dish was more subtle or subdued than expected.  (when I read sauerkraut, I expected \"sour\" kraut!)\n\n3) Porcini mushrooms roasted in the wood oven with yuzu kosho and nori (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DLnb1p72xPOcQr0KqlmUyg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - My personal favorite of the meal as, knowing my palate, mushrooms are the 'it' for me.  Smooth soothing textures.\n\n4) Spiced ling cod with lightly smoked potatoes & black garlic (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=8jArvpzbZAu85I0yeFuMwA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Like the other dishes, didn't quite taste the \"spiced\" part of this and the cod was on the firmer side, similar to a halibut texture.\n\nDesserts (not shared)\n5) Cocoa crepes, chestnut mascarpone, plum jam, mandarin and pecan (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qP5EemuiIURGHZOF-39iaA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Those not necessarily aesthetically appetizing, the flavors work.  The chocolate wasn't too rich so it paired well with the plum jam and mandarin.  The pecan's nuttiness added a different texture to this dish.\n\nNo complaints on the meal, but nothing really \"wowed\" me to the point of having to come back for more.  Perhaps it was because our gracious host engaged in a kaleidoscope of conversation topics which distracted me from the food.  We were given a booth table on the far right just before reaching the kitchen.  Our waitress and servers were all cheerful, professional, and informative in describing the dishes and instructing us on the menu.  \nIn a nutshell, the menu is $65.00 per person.  The menu is separated into four categories (three savory and one sweet) and you can mix and match six courses as you please.  The dessert may or may not be included but, if you decide to supplement them to the other courses, there is an extra charge.  If dessert is your sixth course, then each individual diner may choose their own.  The savory dishes are apportioned according to the number in your party.\nThe best description for the vibe here is that it is \"live\"; there is a bit of a buzz with partygoers celebrating birthdays with BYO party favors to romantic couples.  The communal dining setup also makes it more of a family like or bonding experience.  \nAfter dinner and while walking to the car, my dinner companion asked me which location did I prefer, State Bird or Progress. She enjoyed State Bird for the variety of dishes and the dim sum parallel.  I enjoyed this experience more as I felt the dishes were heartier and the pace less hectic and more relaxed here.  As I tell everyone, there's only one way to find out... \nTry it for yourself!", "author": "Mike C."}

The dishes were simple yet creative.  The ingredients, though familiar in appearance, tasted much better than I recall.  The chef obviously took the time to select quality ingredients to construct the meal. Maybe they took a little too much time because there were some noticeable gaps between courses (a contributing factor to the 4-star rating).  But, the chef did make amends to, or at least appeased, the growling bellies of my dining partners by sending up an additional course of ravioli.\n\nOverall the experience was great. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly (he must have been in good shape too because I lost count of how many times he had to run up and down the stairs to bring us our food and drinks.) and the food was delicious and fun.\n\nOk, the burning question: State Bird or Progress?

We all started off with cocktails and they are so watered down. I got the sunny Jim and it was like Mike's hard lemonade. The amuse bouche plate was a nice gesture.\n\nOkay our food order comes in. First was the lamb tartare. The runner who mixed our tartare was 'F' ing rude, he barely mixed our tartare and just tossed the utensils after mixing. I like the dish and the creativity of the sesame cracker. Next, we had the smoked duck. Maybe the second best dish of the night. It's like a twist on the vietnamese beef carpaccio. The roti is good but it's not as good as roti at Singapore/Malaysia restaurant. And when you think about the cost for this dish, it's ridiculously priced as 1 of 6 dishes of the meal. Likely my favorite dish was the squab. Love the bo-ssam style. The next two dishes was forgettable. Over cooked steak and lobster. We finished off with a guava sorbet.

The simple wooden furniture, hand-thrown ceramic plates, and weird geodesic dome on the wall could have come from the inaugural Pottery Barn catalog or the beginning of Good Earth Caf\u00e9.\n\nIn constrast to the dim sum style carts at its sister restaurant, State Bird Provisions, The Progress is prix fixe and family style. For $65, diners agree on and select six options from a list of approximately 20 options.\n\nServed atop a melange of fennel and cherry tomatoes and sprinkled with fresh herbs and fish sauce, crispy pig ears were too salty. Rich and satisfying, \"treasure chest\" soup features an odd, yet tasty, combination of fermented sausage and trout quenelles with a sweet onion rice dumpling. \"Everything roti\" with smoked onions and baby squash blossoms could easily have been renamed \"nothing roti,\" as its flavors were muted and dull. The wood oven roasted blonde morels were bathed in an overabundance of smoked hollandaise. Porcini mushrooms with ham and wagon wheel cheese croquettes were somewhat forgettable. Tender and moist, the Five Dot Ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce was delicious.\n\nSince the meal is family-style, pacing is important. If dishes arrive too quickly, someone at the table will feel rushed; too slowly, everyone will feel frustrated. It is here that The Progress meets its downfall: some dishes arrive before diners finish the previous one; at other times there is an overly long wait.\n\nThe dining room is hot and loud: jackets off and earplugs in.

State Bird is great but sometimes you get tired of the routine; it got a little bit repetitive and a hungry foodie always wants more. Thank god the Progress opened!  The concept is you pick 6 dishes from the menu (about 20 total items) and share family style, for $65/person. If you want to add dishes, they are an additional $10/person. Corkage is $25.\n\nThe restaurant ambiance is very cool. The bar has a metal frame hanging from the ceiling holding various plants. The restaurant as a whole is very long, and feels like you're on a train from the curved ceilings and curved walls. There are a lot of new wooden and modern panelings which are beautiful. There are two upstairs parts of the restaurant, on each end. In the center, it's a bunch of open space which creates a nice center and buzz of excitement. \n\nThe bartenders are attentive and quick, and thus we got our drinks with swift speed. I got the Sunny Jim ($11, gin, lemon, vanilla-pineapple syrup, kaffir lime leaf, soda, with curry-dusted pineapple), which tasted like a lemonade with vanilla and cream in it, quite tasty and different from any other drink I've had before.  My bf ordered the Concession ($11, rum, house cherry cola syrup, licorice bitters, with buttered popcorn) - he loved it, but for me it was too bitter of a drink (a \"guy\" drink).\n\nOur waiter, Gerald, was an extremely friendly, hilarious gay guy whom everyone would love to have as their BFF. He kept joking around with our table, and others too, and made my bf and I feel very at home. It was great! I hope you get him as your waiter. The chef, Stuart Brioza, was there putting the final touches on the dishes and also bringing some dishes to each table. He presented some of ours very happily, and with lots of pride; you could tell that his heart and soul went into this restaurant. Very cool!\n\nIt turns out the food is very much Asian Fusion, which took me by surprise. We ordered 6.5 dishes. My favorites were #1, 3, 4 and 5:\n\n1) Shaved cauliflower herbs and pig fries. This dish had a sour taste from the lime, and with the herbs and cauliflower, and savoriness of the fried meat, which made it taste like a Thai dish. The pig ears (don't be afraid like I was!) were not in an ear shaped like I had imagined, but instead little strips fried and oozing with fat drippings. Your loss if you don't order this one!\n\n2) Barely Poached Ridgebacks with yuzu & olio nuovo. Ridgebacks are Ebi, very similar to the dish you can sometimes order at Japanese restaurants where they fry the head, and the body of the shrimp. The head was fried, which was quite tasty. The body was poached, and very soft and the texture was amazing. However we felt this dish could have been ordered at another restaurant, not exactly the most innovative (not to say it was bad either though!)\n\n3) Sunchoke, Rosemary, and Pecorino Roti - the WINNER of the night. Roti is a style of Indian Crepe, if you've never had. It's flaky and doughy at the same time. You just rip it off, and it went terrifically with the pecorino cheese. Oh, my god! All of the other tables were ordering it too. \n\n4) Smoked black cod fried rice with squid & preserved lemon. Quite tasty. The black cod seemed like it was poached (vs. fried like I had envisioned) but that was great too, it just made the dish softer. The squid was fried, which gave the dish a nice contrast and complimented nicely with the pucker from the lemon.\n\n5) Treasure Chest of fermented sausage, fish quenelles, tofu and pumpkin-rice dumplings in a creamy pork broth. Basically a ramen soup with lots of little trinkets. I would say this dish was creative due to the fish quenelles and fermented sausage in the soup. What kind of soup ever includes those ingredients?! They were so delicious though! Quenelles were my fav since it was so soft - like biting into a fish cream puff. \n\n6) Aromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste - the \"China\" dish of the night. I wasn't too crazy about this one, but the squab was cooked well (medium rare) and thus soft and chewy. It also came with lettuce wraps and the chili paste - one of which was extremely bitter, which is probably why I didn't care for this dish much. It also wasn't the most creative. \n\n7) Honey cocoa ice cream & olio nuovo. Honey cocoa ice cream was extremely buttery, creamy and chocolatey in a smooth and tasty way. However that was the highlight of the dish. I wouldn't order desserts again; stick to the main savory dishes!\n\nCan't wait to return. I want to come back in summer, so I can try new things on the menu.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

We made a reservation about 3 weeks in advance and were able to get a table for 2 at 7:30pm on a Monday night! \n\nWhen we arrived, we let them know that we both preferred vegetarian food and they informed us that there would definitely be enough options for us to enjoy our meal without any substitutions. Score! One tip: because this place is family-style dining, it is hard to dine with people who have different dietary restrictions than you. Because you are only allowed to pick 6 dishes for the entire table, if only one person out of a large party is vegetarian, they will probably not get enough food because they won't be able to try the non-veg food options. Just something to think about before planning dinner here. \n\nAnyways, I decided to start off with The Sunny Jim which was a deliciously refreshing, citrusy cocktail. Some highlights from our meal: they bring you a platter of 7-8 small, cute little samplers to try out in the beginning. Basically, just a way for them tickle your taste buds and make you even more hungry haha. It was a great way to start the meal! My favorite dish was a small toast like dish with a mushroom and salad topping! It was delicious and definitely recommend it for everyone! The dessert was some of the best I've had as well. We tried one of their famous \"floating island\" desserts and a chocolate dish. Both were exceptional and we cleaned the plates even after being extremely full from dinner. \n\nI loved the concept of this place - it's basically like a pick your own prix fix menu. It's very interactive and communal because everyone is sharing from the same plate. Most of their dishes, they bring out already divided for the number of people dining, but something of them, you have to split yourself.

All the cocktails we tried were excellent.\n\nAt 5:30 promptly we were seated along with a few other tables. Our server was excellent. He was funny and nice and wished us a happy anniversary. We were given our \"choose-your-own-adventure\" menu. All of the dishes are family style and will be presented in a logical way as guided by the server. He was excellent at choosing our courses and they were delivered perfectly. It appears that the dessert though is NOT family style, so you can get more than one dessert and share if you wish.\n\nAfter we ordered, we were given a plate of amuse-bouches: chinese sausage, pickled things, tempura broccoli (amazing). The service was a little rocky at this point. We had to ask for a drink menu and we weren't given enough serving utensils for the amuse-bouche. But everything was excellent food-wise.\n\nOur service was as follows:\n- Pig fries (pretty good, great flavor, don't want to know what it is made of)\n- Roti (delicious, one of the best)\n- Treasure Hunt (so good, sausage, fish, pumpkin mochi in the most amazing broth)\n- Pork Jowl and Farro (maybe the best flavor combination)\n- Squab (served like a lettuce wrap, not my favorite)\n- Black Cod Fried Rice (really good)\n\nWe didn't get dessert because they didn't appeal to us. \n\nThe service was excellent. Plates and flatware replaced after each course. Napkins folded when you leave the table. It seemed like there were about 10 different people who approached our table for one reason or another. Everyone was so friendly.\n\nHow was it overall? It was great. The service, food, atmosphere, cocktails, all were top-notch. It's one of the best places to dine in SF. I will definitely return. However, I was still not satisfied when I left. I expected my mind to be blown and it wasn't. it was really good, but just not at that point where I could collapse. How does it compare to SBP? It doesn't. It's similar yet totally different in many ways. I still prefer the \"dim sum\" style and the fun of SBP. I like that at SBP you can try many different things and get more of a dish. Menus at good places never do the dishes justice so I like to try more dishes to see what's good. For example, if I knew the squab was a lettuce wrap, I wouldn't have ordered it. But I think comparing this to SBP is a bit unfair. Compared to most of the places in SF this is a wonderful place to eat.", "author": "Ryan L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-14", "description": "The Progress is a place that you go for a shared experience, albeit pricey. Thankfully, I came here for a friend's birthday celebration instead of a date night (which I would advise against unless your idea of a date night is being jam packed into a restaurant where you can't hear anybody speaking because the noise level is just a bit crazy). \n\nAmbience: Loud and convivial, and it's why I took off 1 star from this review. Expect to hear amplified conversations around you as you wonder how the wait staff even maneuvers their way around this tight-fighting establishment. It was also difficult to even listen to our server explaining the dinner menu process to us because of the noise level. I completely understand how this in it of itself can be overwhelming for even the most well-intentioned diner in all of us.\n\nHospitality: We arrived promptly and were asked to wait, except the bar area is HELLA crowded so you just have to make like a wall flower and hope you don't get trampled on by the hustling and bustling of everything and everyone around you. Definitely not a place for those of us who are claustrophobic. \n\nFood: The dinner menu is quite interesting. It's basically a somewhat pre-fixe set style for $65pp where you share everything.  Along the top horizontal portion, there are pictures of the menu options that can be add-ons and you just indicate the quantity you would like. On the left side are the vegetarian appetizer selections that are included as part of the pre-fixe set. Along the right column, there are 2 rows: the top are lighter dinner fare, while the bottom normally contain the heartier entree selections. You pick 4 entrees that are served family-style, and it's recommended that you pick 2 from the top and 2 from the bottom. \n\nGiven that this is the sister restaurant to Michelin-starred State Bird Provisions, I expected nothing but the best when it comes to food at the Progress. Overall, I would say that the chefs at the Progress are definitely very creative and the establishment sources seasonal ingredients (ie: Adriatic figs were plentiful on our menu and we saw a huge fig selection at the farmer's markets earlier in the day). However, it still needs some work to convince me that this place is really worth the hype. The menu features a great selection of very unusual pairings, so I'll get right to it:\n\nAdd-Ons: We opted for Santa Barbara coral prawns. So, I get that these prawns can be eaten raw, but I wasn't completely sold on the fact that these prawns appeared cooked, but were raw inside. Albeit raw, they had a very sweet texture, but again, I wasn't asked how I preferred them served to me, and I would have greatly benefited from that option. \n\nAppetizers: The appetizer portions were very small and I felt like it was meant for 1. I don't recall what we had, but they are all vegetarian small-bite plates. Overall, a good palate cleanser to begin the meal.\n\nEntrees: (off topic: They change out your dishes after EACH entree, which is feel is a bit too excessive and unnecessary; plus a waste of water for dishwashers. How messy can you get eating ceviche?)\n\nHalibut Ceviche: So good! The halibut was fresh and flavorful with each bite. The leche de tigre was on point, and the assortment of seasonal vegetables (ie: Mexican sour gherkins) really put a refreshing spin on the dish. \n\nGrilled spanish octopus with harissa: This was done very well. The portions were on point and the octopus was perfectly charred. \n\nDuck breast with bok choy: The duck was perfectly cooked (medium rare and so tender), but the other elements on this dish were sub-par. It included some fried rice which is underwhelming because you know if I wanted fried rice, I would hop over to local Chinese restaurant. I felt like this dish had the potential to be great, but it fell flat at the overall execution. \n\nDrinks: Damn, they are STRONG! They definitely do not skimp on their liquor, so just drink responsibly.\n\nDesserts: We ordered a couple to share, but none of them really stood out as amazing. I believe one was a panna cotta, but if I don't remember much about them, then I'm sure it wasn't one for the win.", "author": "Chan K."}

You and your dining mates collectively choose 6 courses for $65 per person.

Fried oysters were served on a bed of kimchi, there was no heat or spice. Cod was very well cooked but the greens it was paired with were too overpowering in flavor therefore not making it that memorable of a dish. The chicken soup, everything was just the same texture.... the broth had good flavor but noodles were overcooked, everything was very mushy.\n* food was not plated well. Especially the main dishes. Look at the pics I'm going to post, everything looks sloppy and thrown together.\n* lamb tartare - was bland... wish it was better seasoned, or the chips had less texture as I felt each piece was competing with itself. \n* Server was nice, but took a lot to get drinks, refills, and getting her to come back to the table.... tables next to us didn't seem to have that issue, wondering if it's because my party was a good 15 years younger?....

It was four courses, a very light appetizer, one \"western addition\" plate, and a glass of wine each. My favorite dish was the pork and marrow dumplings. So delicious. The lamb also had great flavor, and to be honest - even the light appetizers were great. The only dish I would be careful about is the abalone. It started off really great, but the sauce is very salty/acidic. If you don't like salty foods, I would go with another selection.\n\nAmbience was calm and relaxing.

My experience started off with a challenging reservation via OpenTable. I just could not get the web page to confirm my resez. Agitated, I resorted to the colonial method of booking a restaurant (calling the restaurant). No one answered and I didn't bother leaving a voicemail either. I called back the day of and was able to snag a table for my friends very easily. Cool-let's move onto the food.\n\nAfter examining the menu and surveying our dietary restrictions, we were left to choose from Vegetarian options. I wasn't incredibly excited about this but forged ahead. The server gave us a few amuse bouches which were A-OK. We decided to choose the Avocado wedge salad, Eggplant and polenta from what I recall. The wedge salad was really really good BUT for the pp cost can you impress me with something more than lettuce hearts? Yawn. \n\nThe polenta was delectable and incredibly fluffy. I can confidently say that it was the best polenta I've ever had. I think what makes Progress worthy is the presentation. Farm to table is always a hit amongst the SF crowd but I do expect more creativity when it comes to \"fine dining\". Needless to say I wasn't blown away. $300 later I was still hungry and thinking of ways to justify the amount of money I spent on this meal.

What a terrific decision! Becca, our bubbly and competent bar steward made our time very enjoyable as we asked her many questions about the specialty drinks she was whipping up. We tried the rose Negroni and a Manhattan made with burnt honey whiskey. For starters to share we ordered the local halbiut ceviche (yummm) that arrived with tasty, crunchy light crackers and the tempura eggplant with babaganoush, queso fresco, pluot, and greens. Also yumm.  As main courses the grilled Spanish octopus with shaved fennel was calling out my name and my husband ordered the ling cod with roasted peppers and shaved squash. The ling cod was good, while the octopus was terrific.  The apple crepe dessert with a serving of warm Calvados was delicious but so small that it disappointed.

The worst part was that there were a few super rare/undercooked squab pieces. In addition, the salted chili paste was too strong to use with the squab- I wouldn't order this dish again.\n-Lamb Merguez w/Yellow Eye Beans, Octopus, Crispy Squid (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-progress-san-francisco-2?select=nlsFMUmYM22Bflb2tlDXuQ#MLvZFyFb76JhwdNwdjLPMQ): Again, really salty.

The food was where it went right at the first dish and then wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, and WRONG until the 6th dish. \n\nThe first yummy dish we had last night was the spiced don watson's lamb tartare. I have never had rare lamb before and this was a delightful experience. The lamb was very fresh and I recommend this dish to anyone who enjoys tartares. The other yummy dish was the lamb merguez with yellow eye beans, octopus and crispy squid, which was soooo heavenly. Everything on this dish was seasoned well. I was really surprised at how delicious the crispy squid was! It was yummier than the octopus, which was already waking up my taste buds from the NOT-SO-YUMMY dishes! \n\nHowever, the 2nd all the way to the 5th dish was not up to par to the expectations I had of this place. The dishes were:\n\n1) Pig fries -- go to your local Chinese butcher shop. They will sell you more tastier pig ears for less than $5! \n\n2) Black rice fried butter clams-kimchi 'picatta' -- WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THIS?! My eyes were confused and my tastebuds were scarred from this weird texture. It looked like dried poop sprinkled with black sesame seeds. \n\n3) 'Treasure chest' of fermented sausage, trout quenelles and sweet onion-rice dumpling -- I HATED HATED HATED THIS DISH. If you ever had Vietnamese nem nuong (grilled pork) you would probably call this a poorly-made-white-person-who-lost-his-taste-buds-at-11-years-old version. Ugh. So gross. I was ALMOST ashamed of myself for finishing it. \n\n4) Grilled guinea hen with eggplant vinaigrette -- I wanted to like this dish like my boyfriend did, but there was just something off about it. Perhaps the vinaigrette made the meat not taste fresh to me or something, but I was over it after just one bite. \n\nSadly, even the dessert was BLEH. We had the Santa rosa plum and strawberry cake, as well as, the malted stracciatella ice cream -- both were not memorable. I was disappointed and felt extremely underwhelmed by the food here. My boyfriend, who isn't a harsh critic as me (he's a mountainman who eats dehydrated food as much as you and I inhale h2o), said that he wasn't feeling the food either. \n\nOverall, I would label this a wannabe Asian-Mexican Fusion with American Preparation-Style restaurant. Emphasis on the wannabe and American parts. Tip to the chefs: you should reallyyyyy make the food the way it is supposed to taste. As a Vietnamese girl who cooks authentic Vietnamese food and comes from four generations of chefs, I suggest using the smelly fish sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, shrimp/crab paste... etc... Once you get over the not-so-pleasant smell, you will realize that these sauces and pastes will add more flavors to ANYTHING that you make -- even lazy dishes like instant noodles.", "author": "Jen N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-30", "description": "My friends and I chose the $65 dinner option with our 6 courses (not served in any particular order, but definitely listed favorite in order):\n\n1) SPICED POINT REYES LING COD, BLISTERED ROMANOS & JIMMY NARDELLO VERJUS\n-I highly recommend this dish for its well-seasoned flavors. The cod was clean and tender, the romanos were light and crisp, and the nardello verjus were absolutely fun to eat - they tasted like miniature tacos with a blast in your mouth!\n\n2) SUPER FRESH RICOTTA WITH 'AUGUST GLO' NECTARINES & ROSEMARY ALMONDS\n-Another highly recommended dish, even if you're not a 'salad' person. The ricotta was absolutely light and refreshing, plus a generous amount was served. The sweet nectarines and rosemary almonds definitely brought more flavor to the ricotta, and the overall dish was a great combination.\n\n3) PIG FRY 'CHARCUTERIE' SALAD WITH FISH SAUCE & HERBS\n-This dish is a must have for meat lovers. I wasn't able to hear the waiter describe the dish because of the excessive conversations throughout the restaurant, but the variety of meat was definitely a great experience, however, I felt that the fish sauce made the charcuterie salad a bit too salty.\n\n4) STINSON BEACH 'BOQUERONES' WITH LEMON CUCUMBER, BASIL, & PADRONS\n-Although I love seafood, I didn't really enjoy the boquerones. I felt like the fishes were seasoned to taste similar to unagi (eel), yet it didn't have the similar texture, so I was definitely thrown into confusion. I did, however, enjoy the padrons peppers for its sweet, salty, and soft texture.\n\n5) DEVIL'S GULCH RABBIT WITH EGGPLANT VINAIGRETTE & SHELLING BEAN SALSA VERDE\n-The gulch rabbit was tender, smokey, and delicious, but the vinaigrette eggplant and shelling was definitely not a favorite. I felt that the vinaigrette was overpowering the freshness of the eggplant shelling, but when eaten with the rabbit it does give an unusual combination taste.\n\n6) BLACK RICE FRIED HOG ISLAND SWEETWATER OYSTERS & BUTTER CLAM-KIMICHI 'PICCATA'\n-This dish was my least favorite because the kimichi salad was overly acidic. I felt like I was eating vinegar mustard and it was difficult to cleanse my palette, as well as enjoying the oysters. Definitely drank a lot of water for this one.\n\n\nExtra dishes we decided to order ($10 for each additional dish):\n\n7) POTATO-SAUERKRAUT DUMPLING WITH 'DAMSON' PLUM PRESERVES\n-Definitely another must have dish. The potato filled dumplings served with plum preserves brought sensations to my palette and I would definitely reorder this dish if I ever revisit The Progress again.\n\n8) WHITE CHOCOLATE-BROWN BUTTER PEA CAKE, FIG ICE CREAM, COCOA SYRUP\n-I highly recommend this for your dessert option as the pea cake is dense, but flavorful, and the fig ice cream tastes a bit tart with a slight sweetness, and the sweet cocoa syrup will remind you of your childhood sundae ice cream days.\n\nWe also ordered several alcoholic drinks (A fire in Georgia, Mai Tai, Sunny Jim, Manhattan, etc), which were mostly strong, so if you're a light drinker you should definitely let your server know your beverage preferences.\n\nSome things to note:\n- the building is covered in white glass with no sign indicating its location, except two huge front doors\n- the menu seems to alternate every now-and-then, so you may not see several of these dishes when you visit the restaurant\n- the attire can be from casual to formal\n- HIGHLY not recommended for kids\n- no music is played in the background\n- restrooms are uni-sex\n- they will continuously give you new plates and utensils (why? I have no idea)\n- you WILL get penalized/charged if one of your party members is absent\n\nOverall, we had a great time, but my most favorite dishes were #1, #2, #3 and #7 for protein meals and #6 for dessert.", "author": "Nathalie Y."}

The appetizer were small. 5  pieces of melon for 6 people and we have cut it up to share. The service was fine. The waitress told us we should have enough to eat. The dumping was good but for 6 people we only had 1.5 to 2 pieces. Sometimes I think it is a rip off. You can be the judge. We did not order any wine. Maybe this is why they are not happy. But our company do not drink. I have to drive. I am embarrassed to my guest. We went to state bird. I think we had enough to eat there. I like to enjoy my dinner when you paid that much.

It's a social type place classy place, family style restaurant which is absolutely perfect for almost all group setting dinners where you want to socialize in a fun environment yet dine on Michelin Star food.\n\nThe restaurant was bustling when we arrived so the waitress led us to hang at the bar for a short while. They have one of my favorite pinot noir's by the glass (Tyler from Santa Barbara) and I jumped at the chance of ordering a few glasses for us.\n\nWe were then seated at what felt like a table in one of our houses which was so cool and were presented the wine list and menu. Excellent wine list which reasonable pricing and simple menu from which we ordered:\n\n1) Garlic fried rice - This was a wow dish\n2) Spiced beef and marrow dumplings - This was a SUPER WOW dish. Amazing\n3) Grilled Llano seco pork loin - This was surprisingly the only thing that was OK but still I enjoyed\n4) Some kind of beet salad which was phenomenal\n5) Warm apple crepe - It was a simple apple crepe.

We informed the hostess in advance of our dietary restrictions and our server was fully aware of our vegetarian status when we arrived. \n\nMENU (Vegetarian choices)\n\nOur server went through the entire menu and pointed out the vegetarian dishes and also told us which dishes could be made vegetarian to accommodate us. We ended up ordering 7 dishes inclusive of a dessert. The menu is family style where you order 6 dishes for the table and each person pays $65. If you would like additional dishes it is $10 per person. Initially we ordered 6 dishes, but we re-ordered the roti dish because it was amaze balls!\n\nKudos to the chef for making sure there is more than 1 vegetarian dish on the menu. Usually I'm hesitant to try certain restaurants because they don't accommodate vegetarians. Aside from the token salad, roasted veg and pasta dishes many new age 'American' restaurants don't have a whole lot on their menus for veg heads. \n\nThe Progress not only accommodated us, but far exceeded our expectations when it came to vegetarian menu items. I'd say 30% of the dishes are vegetarian and about another 20% can be made vegetarian. Vegetarians and vegans can appreciate these percentages. \n\nAMBIANCE\n\nThe restaurant is incredibly beautiful. There is wood everywhere and it is romantic and lovely. The bathroom stalls are dramatic glitter bombs with glitter on the walls and they are awesome. \n\nSERVICE\n\nThe service made our experience fantastic. I loved the food, but the service is going to bring me back to The Progress. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a smile. The servers were relaxed, casual and thoughtful. The person that brought out our desserts was great. She explained each dessert and was smiling and happy. Its always nice to see happy smiling faces when you go out for dinner! \n\nHOW WAS THE FOOD?\n\nLoved the food! It was 'out of the box' good food. The roti dish was our favorite!! We ordered two of them. The desserts were different and interesting. I'd have to say the desserts were the most creative and fun!\n\nI'll BE BACK!", "author": "Reena P."}

A large bar area with more than 20 seats, so without reservation, it's not a bad thing. The last few times I was here around 5:15 week nights, I got in. \n\n    The 90-seat dining room with a few more tables on the second level, usually fill up by 6 PM, and it's jam packed every night just like its sister State Bird Provisions next door. \n\n    The Progress serves bar menu and full dinner menu at the bar, so it's such a great option for diner like me CANNOT get any reservation from both restaurants :-) It's not a complain, in fact it makes me more excited and a little adrenaline rush with the thought that I couldn't get any seat even at the bar, haha. That was how I feel about last night dinner with my best friend in town. \n\n   Luckily chef Stuart Brioza was in, what a treat for my best friend and my visiting somm friend from NYC. \n\n   Love the concept of 6 dishes for $65 per person, and each additional dish for $10, plenty of delicious food to share, reasonable price point, great concept and execution. \n\n- spot prawn - was so delicious\n\n- shaved cauliflower-herbs & pig fries\n\n- spiced lamb tartare - I had this dish 3 times now, and loving it each time more.\n\n- raw japanese snapper - beautifully presented as good as it looks.\n\n- porcini & mt. tam dumpling with nettle salsa verde - newest dish in APR 2015, refreshing.\n\n- pecorino 'roti' with perigord truffle buttermilk - a MUST TRY\n\n- roasted mushrooms & kale with local wakame kraut - I had this dish 3 times and will continue order it as long as it's on the menu, a great choice for vegetarian.\n\n- butter clams on the half shell with kimchi piccata & shungiku\n\n- Spanish  barnacles - it was so delicious and I came back last night, it was gone!  \n\n- black butter butternut squash with caramelized onion & swiss chard\n\n- polpette of guinea hen & pork with blood orange & castelvetranos - another FAV dish of mine. \n\n- lamb merguez with yellow eye beans, octopus & crispy squid - my 3rd time with this dish, highly recommend \n\n- maitake, tofu curry & bok choy 'stir fry' with smoked black cod ponzu - reminds me of Chinese cuisine.\n\n- aromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste - reminds me of a Vietnamese dish that I had when I was growing up. It got the 5 spice flavor, the meat was so tender, delicious, I forgot when was the last time the squab could taste that good.\n\n- grilled Five Dot Ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce - this was the only dish that wasn't my style :-) but my friends love it! I prefer my beef/steak with less sauce on it. \n\n    The cocktail list is also good. I presonally enjoyed the Paloma (reposado tequila, pomelo, lime, sugar, madras curry tincture) recommended by our server Kelly.\n\n  The wine list was delicious by Sommerlier Jason Alexander, if you are a wine lover, collector, or a somm, you would enjoy this list tremendously. He offers wines of the world, beautiful white Burgundy, the grower Champagnes, Rieslings, and plenty of French, Italian and Spanish red for under $70 bottles! And if you are a collector, check out the Cellar Selection, I'm in love! \n\n    The service by Eric last time at the dining room was excellent. The last 2 times at the bar was equally fantastic, attentive, caring, and purely enjoyable for us. \n\n    I'm looking forward to my next visit to explore the ever evolving menu daily and the wine list to pair with it. \n\n    Again, congratulations The Progress, San Francisco for being Jame Beards Foundation Award Semifinalists 2015, and I'm sure many accolades to come. \n\nNOTE: no valet parking, come at 5 PM on week night, you will surely get in at the bar!", "author": "Manda Bear B."}

Each of the dishes were wonderfully prepared and the flavors blended so well. The lamb  is a MUST have. The combination of flavor in that dish is just Ah-Ma-Zing!

Didn't have a reservation, but we were lucky enough to wait only 5 minutes before we were seated.\n\nThe bar menu is slightly different than the family style menu.

Unfortunately, when I think about this meal (which was a birthday celebration), all I can remember is the \"Facetime Incident\" and not the food.  I know we enjoyed what we ordered, though.

I made dinner reservations for my birthday at 8:30pm. We showed up early and had to wait till 8:55pm to get seated. Didn't get our snacks till 9:20pm, which is basically enough to feed birds.. I had to call the manager over at 9:40pm as we were still not served our first dish. Seriously, it's a rip off and the service is SOOO slow. I think their tactic is to let the customers wait so they will keep ordering drinks in the meantime. Would I come back again? NOPE! Not worth my time at all. Let's not talk about the tip.

Well-presented and creatively imagined dishes which unfortunately let-down when it comes to flavor.\n\nThe good: Aesthetic appeal of this gorgeous restaurant; creativity and presentation of the dishes; service\n\nThe bad: unfortunately, the flavors do not come together as well as they might. Nothing was delicious.\n\nWe had a good time at Progress the weekend before last. The restaurant is unbelievably gorgeous IMO, with a vibrant, energetic, fun ambiance. Service was on-point the entire night through, with only one slight timing issue. \n\n$65 prix fixe - choose your dishes to share with your party. Interesting dishes, creative, and well-presented.\n\nOnly drawback: nothing made me say, \"Wow, that's so good!\". Amazing taste is essential, that's the primary reason I'm paying so much to eat at The Progress, so the lack thereof was disappointing to say the least. Portion sizes are fine, and we left full at least.\n\nCauliflower and Pig Fries (2/5): just ok, didn't care for the astringency of the pig fries myself. Other half of party thought they were too rubbery.\n\nSpring Pea & Mt. Tam Dumplings (3/5): expertly cooked, blandly flavored\n\nTomato Curry Roti (4/5): perfectly cooked, nice flavor - favorite dish of the night\n\nTreasure Chest (2/5): big letdown. Broth was good; the disparate pieces didn't come together well in this dish, and were average when considered on their own. Not a fan of the pungent flavor of the sausage\n\nMaitake with black cod ponzu (3/5): fine, nothing special.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-13", "description": "They serve a 6- course tasting menu for $65 per person (really, really good price).\n\nBut. It's served \"family- style.\" And YOU get to pick your entire meal.\n\nKinda cool. Right?\n\nHere's how dinner went down: We walk in & the vibe is on-point. Chill music is playing in the background, we are immediately greeted and taken to our table, the servers are dressed in casual attire (ie: jeans and flannel), and the ambiance was super cool. For a meal of this caliber, you would think it'd be somewhat pretentious with people walking around in suit and ties- it wasn't.\n\nFrom start to finish, our entire 2 hr experience was very laid back & professional at the same time. It was perfect.\n\nOh, and did I forget to mention that it's FUN!! Like even if you come here with boring Betty, you'll still have a good time.\n\nAs soon as we sat down, we were given a menu and a #2 pencil. Out of 17 items, we got to choose 6 courses for the entire table (with option to add more as you like).\n\nWhile we were deciding on what to get, a sampler platter of TINY bites came to the table (to be eaten with a toothpick).\n\nEverything was so damn delicious- it setup the rest of the meal perfectly. Basically, it got you excited for everything else to come.\n\nShortly after, our plates came out one by one (and since their menu changes all the time, I won't bore you guys with every detail in every single dish).\n\nThe first 4 dishes below are the ones that really, really blew my mind:\n\n+ First, we had the spiced lamb tartare with various \"mix-in\" condiments. The condiments included sprouts, sesame seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, egg yolk bottarga, bronze fennel fronds, pickled kohlrabi strips and green onions. They served it with crunchy/salty black rice crackers.\n\nUhm, how on earth do they make these black rice crackers? Anyone??!!?!?!!\n\n+ Next, was the shaved cauliflower herbs & pig fries. If this is still on the menu, it's MUST GET. It was the perfect balance between flavors and textures- crispy, salty, crunchy and spicy. The herbs tasted like they were just pulled from the garden hours before.\n\n+ Third, we had the pecorino 'roti' with perigord truffle buttermilk.\n\nWhen it came to the table, everyone just looked at each other like, 'THAT'S IT?'\n\nBut from the very first bite to the last, we couldn't have enough of it. In fact, I'm still raving about it today to my friends: \"GUYS, I JUST HAD THE BEST ROTI EVER!\" (real life).\n\nSo even the simplest sounding menu item, was one of the biggest surprises. It was executed very well, and the truffle buttermilk was orgasmic. You gotta get it.\n\n+ OMG. This squab. I didn't even know what squab was until now. Every bite was tender with juicy flavors that can't be described. The closest thing I can think of is the quail at Cockscomb but this is even BETTER.\n\nThe feet on the legs were a little freaky. Just ignore it.\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nThis is a place where you get to experience some of the best culinary dishes that SF has to offer, without breaking the bank.\n\nAt The Progress, you know you will be getting an amazing meal & dining experience without sitting through a boring, pretentious 3 hour Michelin meal.\n\nChefs Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski has been changing the game since they opened State Bird Provisions, offering small tapas in a dim sum cart format. For those of you who don't know, it's one of the most highly talked about restaurants EVER. And they've won a ton of awards... no big deal.\n\nSo. You can see why The Progress has been the talk of the town since they opened. And trust me, they definitely live up to the hype.\n\nGot any special occasions, bdays or anniversaries coming up?\n\nBecause if I were you, I'd totally make a ressie ASAP (before it becomes impossible). Do it now, and you'll thank me later!\n\nMore pics and deets here: http://cyneats.com/the-progress-sf/", "author": "Cynthia L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-09", "description": "I'm writing this review post-Lazy Bear, so the Progress is a little less shiny in my mind, but nevertheless, The Progress is a must try.\n\nThe door is unlabeled, but you know exactly where you are because of the line next door at State Bird. Luckily, reservations aren't too tricky to make at the Progress.\n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful, all wood and happy voices and a very tight squeeze to get to your table. You're brought a variety of snacks, and it's all well and good and delicious, but not particularly memorable.\n\nYou're given a check list, similar to dim sum, where you can pick 6 dishes to eat family style or 5 dishes and an individual sized dessert. My boyfriend and I picked the following:\n\nSmoked duck with marinated pioppini mushrooms & dried plum. This was very, very good. The plum was sweet, which played well with the smokey sweetness of the duck. \n\nShaved cauliflower-herbs & pig fries. This was good, but not too special. The pig fries had a healthy heaping of pig ear. I don't think I would order this again. \n\nSpiced lamb tartare with various mix-in condiments. This was probably my favorite dish. Really delicious and flavorful, and it came with these delicious, delicate chips that were salty and brought all the flavors together.\n\nPolpette of guinea hen & pork with blood orange & castelvetranos. This was probably my least favorite dish. Thinking back, I can't remember a single thing about this dish that stood out. \n\nTreasure chest of fermented sausage, trout quenelles & pumpkin-rice dumplings in a creamy pork broth. This was so freaking good. I just wanted more of it. The broth was amazing, and I really wanted another pumpkin dumpling, and I definitely wanted more of the trout quenelles. My least favorite element of this dish was the sausage, but that's just personal preference.\n\nThe dessert I chose was the poppyseed angel cake, strawberries, pistachio & marscapone. It was delicious, light, and exactly what I needed to finish off the evening.\n\nThis is a great place to go with a group of friends who have similar tastebuds to you. The alcohol selection is impressive, but it adds up once you've had a few glasses. I highly recommend checking out The Progress.", "author": "Christina S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-01", "description": "Have you ever had eyes for the hot older brother, but no matter how hard you tried, you failed?  So, you settled for the not as pined over but nice younger brother.  Okay, I don't double dip or even attempt to double dip amongst family or good friends, but I'm sure a lot of people can relate to this right?  So, I've always wanted to try older brother (or sister) restaurant, State Bird Provisions, but I've tried all the tips that my friends have given me in order to make a reservation and no luck.  I swear SBP is harder to get into than Stanford!  At first it seemed hard to get a reservation at The Progress as well, but about three weeks prior I was actually able to get a reservation for President's Day Monday at a reasonable time (6PM).  We both had the day off so I grabbed it.  \n\nThe door for both restaurants don't seem to be clearly marked.  We arrived a couple minutes early and were seated right away.  The restaurant already had a good amount of patrons.  We ended up sharing a communal style table which is for two parties of two, with a seat in between both on each side.  I honestly wasn't expecting much from The Progress due to a slew of mixed reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised.\n6 dishes for $65 per person..all parties must agree on the dishes as they are shared.\n\nA plate full of different amouse bouches were served: a chicken jerky, cheddar cracker, squab mousse, a fontina cheese dumpling and one more that we forgot.  Overall, they were really good bite size starters.  Two of my favorites were the squab mousse and fontina cheese dumpling.  \n\nOur 6 dishes:\n*Crab, bok choy, and tofu stir fry - Wonderful start to our meal.  Lots of bits of crab meat and we loved the tofu pillows, all in a light ginger sauce.  \n*Polpette of rabbit & pork with blood orange & castelvetranos - Never had rabbit, the pork and rabbit were so flavorful and tender.  The blood orange was a nice acidic and sweet compliment to the meat.  Our favorite dish!  \n*Grilled Five Dot Ranch beef w/mustard-miso oyster sauce - Like Cherylynn said, this was our least favorite dish.  Although it wasn't horrible, we were expecting more.  There were only four pieces of beef, and they weren't tender at all.\n*Black butter butternut squash w/caramelized onions & swiss chard - I gots to have my veggies!  The sweetness from the butternut squash and caramelized onions worked well with the bitterness of the swiss chard.  The butter tied in the savoriness.  \n*Shaved cauliflower-herbs & pig fries - I've had Taiwanese pig ear before and hated it, but we thought why not, let's try this, especially since it's fried.  These ears were done right!  The texture was so not like the other pig ear I've had (no cartilage weirdness here), there were also lots of pork belly strips, some acidity and fish sauce to cut the fattiness and the shaved cauliflower was a nice touch as well.  \n*Aromatic spiced squab w/salted chili paste - Crispy skin and wonderful spices and the chili paste was hot!  But there was very little meat on this, which made it a bummer.\n\nLike others said, we were still a little hungry, so yes, we went to that wonderful place further down Geary for a supplement (Jack In The Box).  The service was great, food was good; honestly I was expecting the worst.  But it's pricey for what you get.  If I could ever get a reservation at State Bird, I'm sure for what you pay here I'd be more satisfied over there.  3.5 rounded up.

Love the twist in using a different citrus. Would definitely get again. \n\n- \"Malaysian jerky with peanuts\" -\n....Uh, you mean grilled pork? Honestly, this is the grilled meat from any Vietnamese vermicelli\n\nOUR SIX DISHES\nThere's a menu you get to bubble in (I feel like I'm in school again haha) the six dishes you want for $65/person\n\n- Spiced lamb tartare -\nDelicious! Don't taste that gaminess of lamb. The \"mix in\" condiments is greaaaat and the black sesame rice crackers were perfect for this mix\n\n- Smoked duck -\nSuper strong mushroom taste, just aiiite\n\n- \"Treasure chest\" -\nPumpkin rice dumping has a rice ball consistency, not sure if I taste pumpkin\nFermented sausage tastes stronger than I anticipated, it's fermented after all\nTrout quenelles tastes like typical Asian noodle bowl's fish balls\nCabbage was very pickled\nBroth is nice but got acidic as I neared the bottom of the bowl\nLoved the bowl it came in though! \n\n- Rabbit+pork w/ castelvetranos -\nThe meat reminded me of meat you get from shwarmas, with an added layer of crisp from the fried outer layer. Was quite good. \nThe \"castelvetranos\" threw me off. It was weird. It tasted tart from the blood orange but savory from being with the rabbit+pork and sweet from the onions? And there's bits of fried potato skin in there? I wasn't sure what was going on but I couldn't eat more than a spoonful.\n\n- Five Dot Ranch beef -\nTasted grilled, which is good. Dish is good overall but nothing mind blowing or super memorable\n\n- Squab -\nCame in five slices, a wing, and a leg that was flipping us off (see photo). I was quite entertained by the long nails on the bird's foot, haha\nThe \"chili paste\" that came with this reminds me of the chili ginger sauce often served with hoi nam chicken\nAlso had cabbage leaves and a lemon slice with spices to piece the dish together. The flavors for this dish is great\n\nDESSERT\n- Elderflower floating island, guava sherbet, Arnold Palmer gelee -\nYum! Enjoyed this very much. It's refreshing without being overly sweet or creamy. Would definitely get again\n\n- Poppyseed cake with rhubarb and mascarpone -\nGood but not as good as the sherbet, that is all. \n\nCOCKTAILS\n- Sunny Jin -\nGin mix and it tastes like juice haha but what do you expect from a gin cocktail? \n\n- The Mezzanine -\nSaw mezcal and my eyes widened! But sadly, the drink is not as stiff as I'd like it. The smoky flavor I enjoy so much is masked too well. So sad. \n\nOverall, a good meal and a great experience. There was just the right amount of interaction between waiter, diner, and the food. The food will be prepped but not ready to eat until the waiter pours the broth or mixes the condiments. The diner would piece together the squab, cabbage, lime and chili paste to enjoy in one bite.\n\nIt's a great dinner but I'm not in a hurry to be back any time soon.", "author": "Sandy T."}

Not offering to re-fill a wine glass when someone accidentally spills their $20 glass of wine is not fine. \n\nBoils down to this: I consider a $600 dinner an \"experience,\" not just a dinner. A restaurant charging that much should (at all times) be contributing to the experience. When someone spills their wine on accident, they're already embarrassed. Not providing a refill just lets that person sit there not drinking while the rest of the group continues drink. That detracted from our experience. \n\nIf you want to be of such a high caliber of a restaurant, then be it. Don't fake it. It takes more than constantly refilling water glasses. I've paid much more for a dinner, but left the restaurant 100% satisfied because the experience was extraordinary. \n\nI was originally bringing my parents here next week.

With our food and 3 drinks, as well as an extra dessert we got out of here around $200 after tip. While pricey, I think given how cool the atmosphere is, the quality of the food, the creativity....it was worth it to me. I wasn't eating shaved black truffle on top of virgin angel hair pasta made by 5 yr old cats pooping, so I felt that the value was really good. Interesting was that everything up front was sweet/tart, and everything at the back was savory.\n\nApp Taste - sort of just started off the mouth watering appetite. Nothing out of control here, I was actually sort of worried that the rest of the night would go badly after a giant bowl with tiny tiny finger foods that seemed so-so were presented. Good sausages.\n\nRicotta w/Nectarines - reminded me of a really good yogurt breakfast bowl. Really good ricotta, tart and beautiful nectarines. \n\nSauerkraut dumplings - delicious. Sour and salty cabbage, large portions, and REALLY nice char on the dumplings (something i never experienced before...usually i just taste pan burn). Plum preserves finished off the sweet/tart combo.\n\nEverything roti - delicious, crunchy, tasted like a ballpark summer day to me (dunno why), with sour yogurt and delicious pickled zucchini. Delicious, best dish of the front bunch.\n\nSpiced cod - intersting presentations, sort of like little chunks of cod (versus the restaurant presented filets) but cooked PERFECTLY, so crunchy yet not overcooked at all. Savory dish to kick it off\n\nPork - medium pork was juicy and delicious...at first we thought it was under seasoned then we scooped up the DELICIOUS broth that was below and it was a unified experience. With the salty cooked broth, the pork was on point. \n\nLamb Merguez- best dish of the night. Spicy salty crisp lamb sausage, charred squid, deliciously chewy and flavorful octopus on a salty broth...just amazing. A beautiful dish to look at, a complex layer of sea and land, crunchy and soft, juicy and dry...just so good.\n\nWe got hooked up with 2 desserts (vs the 1 we ordered). Both were excellent. Cinnamon ice cream with delicious caramel, chocolate olive oil cake. Nothing like Milk bar blow you away, but really good and nothing to complain about.\n\nDrinks - all solid.

I was lucky enough to have friends who invited me along. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like was how we had to wait 45 minutes for our table (with a reservation mind you) and the response from the front of the house was just \"we are waiting on the previous table to leave\" 5 minutes is understandable. 10 minutes is reasonable. 20 is somewhat pushing it, and when it hit 30 minutes behind our reservation I was ready to jump up and go kick that table out myself. 45 minutes is inexcusable. At that point you COULD kindly suggest that they take the conversation to the bar perhaps? Or maybe throw us something to nosh on as we're trapped in a little alcove STARVING?! We did offer to tell the hostess that we would kindly ask them ourselves because shit, it's been forty-fecking-five minutes already! Plus I just came from the gym. Thank goodness I ate a banana on my walk over or I probably would've keeled over from low blood sugar.\n\nYou pay a set price for a certain number of dishes. I believe 6 courses for $65 (per person) and an additional $10 for each extra course. You can order the dishes a la cart if you wish. We stuck with the 6. \n\nGeoduck clam and carrot \"cocktail\" - a great way to open your dining experience at Progress. refreshing, light, and I just wanted a huge bowl of this all to myself. The carrot juice was sweet and complimented the geoduck beautifully.\nshaved cauliflower, herbs \"pig fries\" - HUGE HIT.

Our server, however was a tad chilly, never asking once how our food was.  \n\nParking, can be difficult, I have parked in Japantown's lot before, but this time, it was full, so we ended up circling the blocks several times, finally ending up at the Jazz Heritage Center a couple blocks away, it was $12, not bad. \n\nHouse water is filtered.  Wines by the glass are reasonably priced at around $14/glass.  Do the Chablis and the Pinot Noir.  Love that they pour you a taste at the table, so you have a choice of whether or not to continue.   \n\nLove how they have the interactive menus, which allow for the tables to collaborate and make their selections with a simple tick of a pencil.  If you go over the 6 items, you will be charged $10/pp for each item.  We ordered 8 savory and one dessert, so for food it ended up being the following:\n\n$130 for the base menu, 6 items\n$40 for 2 additional items\n$10 for 1 dessert\n\nNote: if you select 1 dessert, every person in your party will get that same dessert if you don't specify and if you're over the 6 item limit, it will cost you $10 per.  \n\nFor the guy who likes a lot of meat or carb-y sustenance, these plates are petite and do not stick to your ribs at all.  For me and the bf, 8 savory dishes were a bit much, we took a little box home and the dessert was completely unnecessary.  \n\nBathrooms are unmarked, in the hallway across from the kitchen.  No toilet seat covers.  Unisex and super fun photo ops inside!\n\nWe were sitting one over from the kitchen and it was warm, and generally, there wasn't much circulation.  I would ask for a round table for two in the future for more privacy.  The dining room gets deafening.  \n\nMenu changes frequently, but it seems the popular items remain.  I went on the site throughout the week and the day of to check to see if the menu would change and it didn't.  When we got there, there were a few items that were not on the menu or in previous reviews, which keeps the diner on the edge and surprised.  \n\nEats:\n-wonderful 'banchan' to start, one of the items was fried smelt, which took me back to a childhood Chinatown favorite.  The jerky and pate were standouts.  \n-spiced lamb tartare, very Asian with strong sesame oil flavors, ok-good, least fav\n-shaved romanesco & pig fries, this is INSANE, a signature dish for sure, I would order this everytime, maybe two, the runners were getting this course to every table\n-black bass with turnips & cr\u00e8me fraiche, subtle, beautiful dish, light\n-wild mushrooms & kale with wakame kraut, a tad salty, so earthy and rich\n-'treasure chest', umami\n-polpette of rabbit & pork with blood orange, perfect seasoning, a favorite\n-lamb merguez with yellow eye beans, octopus and crispy squid, large portion, executed perfectly except for the overly salty merguez\n-spiced squab, tender, juicy, they need to bottle the salted chili paste\n-pineapple confit tart, guava ginger cream & pink peppercorn, couldn't taste the peppercorn, but the remaining elements were tropical and light.  \n\nLovely dinner.

Sister restaurant and neighbor to State Bird, this restaurant is much easier to make reservations for, and the bar opens at 5pm. If you were not a fan of State Bird Provisions you probably wouldn't like The Progress either. But I loved the modern, fusion take on these shareable dishes and would definitely come back. Dinner is served in 6 courses, $65/person (plus a complimentary amuse bouche). Each additional course is $10/person, and cannot be served in individual persons. I.e. If you come in a group of 2 or 4, everyone orders the same and gets an additional dish too. \n\n* AMUSE BOUCHE - 4 STARS:\nSome of these items can also be found in some version at State Bird. Everything was tasty, but the sausage was my favorite. Like an elegant lap cheung (Chinese Sausage), so delicious.\n\n* ROTI - 3.5 STARS:\nsunchoke, rosemary & pecorino 'roti'\nDelicious, fresh, and chewy roti. I was expecting more cheese or flavor in the sauce, it was nice but a little too subtle to complement the very thick and doughy roti.  \n\n* BRUSSELS SPROUTS - 2.5 STARS:\nwild mushrooms with pickled local nori & brussels sprout leaves.\nI love both ingredients, but the mushrooms were way too salty. \n\n* COD FRIED RICE - 4 STARS:\nsmoked black cod fried rice with squid & preserved lemon\nNice and crunchy, and just a generally perfect combination. Would have preferred more toppings but overall very good.\n\n* PUMPKIN RICE DUMPLING - 4 STARS:\n'treasure chest' of fermented sausage, fish quenelles, tofu\n& pumpkin-rice dumpling in a 'creamy' pork broth \nJust a really satisfying and delicious dish.\n\n* ESCAROLE SALAD - 4 STARS:\npuntarelle & escarole with fermented kohlrabi & soft egg vinaigrette \nLoved the soft egg on top of the greens, topped with a nice crunchy texture complement.", "author": "Jess C."}

Yet another time where I wish there were half Yelp stars.  The Progress, on paper, is an awesome idea.  Take everything I love about State Bird and make it a bit bigger and better.  Add a bar with great cocktails, add seating at the bar where you can get some food without reservations, take amazing small plates but make them bigger to share with your friends, and put all this in a bigger space.  It seems like a no-brainer, can't-go-wrong type of scenario.  Right?  Well, not exactly. \n\nI have now been to The Progress twice.  (I've been to State Bird about 4 times).  I love State Bird.  I don't think I've had a dish that I did not like.  However I can't say the same about The Progress.  Both times I've gone, I've sat at the tables by the bar.  I have no complaints about the service.  It really is excellent 5/5 star service even when you are at these tables.  The drinks are great, another 5/5 stars. \n\nSo why only 3/5 overall?  The food was a tremendous let down.  It's hard to explain, but nothing I have gotten there is amazing.  (I've tried 6+ dishes now).  I won't comment on specific dishes because they change their menu.  And perhaps my biggest problem is the price point.  Perhaps it is much more expensive to order a la carte (which I have done both times at the bar), but for $60+ per person I expect more.  Again, it may be a much better deal to have reservations and do the regular dinner.\n\nI didn't want to write my review after a single experience where I wasn't amazed.  However after going there twice, I can say that I am so disappointed (given how much I love State Bird).  I would give this place a 3.5/5 overall, however I can't get myself to round up to 4.  That being said I think this place still has amazing potential and could easily be a 5 star place with some adjustments.", "author": "Paul W."}

The portions were filling without making me feel like I ate way too much.\n\nThe pacing for dishes was a little odd. After starting out perfectly with an appetizer plate and each of the veggies separately, we got the final three plates all at the same time. The portions were a good size, but it made the experience feel a little rushed, like we had to hurry and eat to make sure we got to the food while it was still hot on the plate. \n\nThe wait staff was very friendly, got us drinks quickly, and we're a joy to chat with. While we were trying to decide if we should order a seventh dish a la carte, the appetizer dish (which is a nice extra and not part of the dishes you get to choose) came out. That sealed that we should definitely just go with the recommended six plates. Desserts are one per person, so basically everyone gets to choose their own option, but it still counts as one course. \n\nThe appetizer was superb and great way to start the meal. A tender leek, nut-covered jerky, small piece of salmon and cucumber with sauce, a leafy thing with avocado sauce, fried gnocchi, and sliced strawberry with cheese. We both ended up scraping the plate clean with our toothpick utensils. \n\nFor drinks, we got some wine and a Sunny Jim. The Sunny Jim wasn't bad, but the vanilla was way too overpowering. If I didn't know the drink had gin (or any other ingredient), I would've guessed it was just some vanilla soda water.\n\nFor our mains, we ordered:\nShaved cauliflower and pig fries: A great mix, though the crispier pig ears weren't quite as delicious as the thick and meaty fried bits. The cauliflower and abundant greens made me feel a little less guilty about all the fried deliciousness.\n\nWild mushrooms & kale with local wakame kraut: The highlight of the meal for me. Tender kale with mushrooms so succulent it was like eating a steak. \n\nPolpette of pork with blood orange & castelvetranos: I think the castelvetranos referred to the olive sauce under this dish. On their own, the meatballs were a little salty, but they paired well with the potatoes. Adding the blood orange on top gave the entire dish a surprising pop. This needed a little more fruit to help even out the salty meat.\n\nLobster, bok choy, & tofu stir fry: An OK dish, but the lobster and the tofu tasted plain. The real surprise came from the kimchi; a toothsome addition that I wish there was more of throughout. \n\nGrilled Five Dot Ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce: The mustard sauce was very nice, but the beef tasted very standard. Not quite the high quality that I'd expect for the small portions of meat. \n\nDessert: \n- Elderflower floating island, guava sherbert, & arnold palmer gelee\n- Milk chocolate-black lager ice cream, cocoa sable & caraway seed.\nFortunately, we didn't have to end the meal with so-so steak. I'd be hard-pressed to pick a favorite from these two amazing desserts. The fruity guava sherbert was a great foil to the rich, chocolatey ice cream sable. The chocolate dish also had a delicious crunchy chocolate surprise as the base, and it tasted like it was sprinkled with homemade Honeycrisp cereal. \n\nSide note: Several people around us ordered the \"Treasure Chest\" a broth covered mix of sausage and dumpling that looked wonderful.", "author": "Justin H."}

Ouch.\n\nWarm greeting upon arrival. Table not ready? No prob, we'll hang out at the bar.\n\nAs we waited at the relatively empty bar (7:15pm) someone SCREAMS \"MELODY!!!\" - I'm like, Wahhhh? I thought a friend had spotted me and was screaming at me out of excitement, turned out to be the hostess letting us know our table was ready.  Nothing major, just jolted me a little.\n\nAnother man showed us to our table and left us with the wine menu.  We sat there with 2 empty glasses - no water, no menu.. just looked at each other for 5-10 minutes and looked around for whomever was going to be our waiter and wondered why we weren't seated with a menu.\n\nFinally, our waiter shows up and plops down the menu and just says a quick welcome and brings over some water.  Not sure he secretly knew we'd done our research and knew we already knew you chose 6 for $65 family style... but was rather surprised there was just a pencil and paper .. no explanation then us left to our own devices.  A few minutes later it seemed he thought better of it and came by to let us know quickly what was up -- for such a new concept (which I DO LOVE) you would think there's the usual \"have you dined with us before? here's our exciting way of ordering..\" something friendly like that.\n\nI did appreciate that you can chose to forego dessert and have your 6th course be a savory dish which we did.  I disagree with other reviewers who left hungry - my husband left full as did I.  \n\nThey give you a delicious amuse bouche which we enjoyed and then the courses come out rather fast - which worked for us because we were hungry.  The roti was probably one of my favorite dishes along with the prawns.  The dumpling was forgettable - I did not even have more than a bite of my steak and rabbit/pork polpette.  \n\nAs much as I wanted to love the place - great space, great dining concept - loved being able to try 6 courses without feeling disgustingly stuffed at the end of our meal.. no dish really impressed me that much or made me gave me that \"This is why I love living in SF\" feeling of tasting amazingness which is what I'm looking for when I pay $65pp for dinner.  It probably sounds snobbish, but I feel like that's what everyone is looking for, right? We're not all making $200K/year and are able to afford meals this expensive - we go out for a nice night out and expect to get our monies worth.\n\nDespite the meh feeling about the food (not bad by ANY means.. ) I think it was just overall service that was lacking.", "author": "Melody T."}

Staff is great, space is great, food is great.\n\nSo why 3 stars? Because I have never been so underfed at a high end restaurant. I'm all for 'California Cuisine' and hipster concepts but this was almost comical.  We had a group of 6 and all the dishes here are served family style. You order 4 entrees for the table and you get some appetizers automatically, prix fixe pricing. We became convinced they only scaled the dishes for 3 or 4 people they were so small. We even had 2 teens eating less than others and it was still stressful whether there would be enough to go around. Each dish was delicious just extremely small for 6 to share. The way the menu is set up you have no choice to add more either.\n\nTake the buttermilk biscuits appetizer for example. We got exactly 6 biscuits that were less than 1\" square, not even a full mouthful each.   The date appetizer again was exactly 6 small dates. So the appetizers gave each person less than one full bite each, the main courses gave maybe 3-5 bites each per person. \n\nAnd the wine - small list of wines by the glass. At $15-$20 per glass (you read that right) I would expect a big pour, but again the wine poured was about 25% less than any other restaurant and the glass was only about 1/3 filled. I was going to complain but who has the energy.\n\nOverall the food and service is really good but for these high prices we shouldn't have to think about eating somewhere else after.  \n\nNEVER go here with a party of 4 or more.", "author": "Jim J."}

Jason responded right away to my email and extended an invitation for my boyfriend and myself to join them again for dinner as their guest, to allow them to \"make up for our dissatisfaction\" and to show us that their goal is to impress, as well as to express gratitude for our honest feedback.

It sounded a bit odd with kiwi, garlic and almonds, but it was truly the best thing I've eaten so far this year.\nA couple of larger dishes could've used some editing. The black cod dish for example was delicious but too fussy. A friend said he thought a lot of the food was busy and trying too hard. I disagree. These guys are going for it and not everyone will like it.\n\nOne thing I did notice was a little of that precious, somewhat pretentious attitude from some staff. That unfortunate tone you get from pissy bartenders that work in a busy, of-the-moment restaurant. I also thought it was sloppy they open their doors at 5:30 but were still having their shift meeting at 5:40 in the middle of the dining room, blocking the path to the toilets. Pretty amateurish. \n\nMaybe it's the Momofukuzation of today's restaurant industry, as these details seem to come with the territory. That petulant, \"Whatever man, I love tats, all things pork and pounding Fernet!\" kind of immature attitude that dumbs down what, in this case, could be a truly excellent restaurant if they buttoned it up a little.", "author": "Nigel T."}

Ultimately I prefer State Bird over The Progress in terms of the overall experience. I do like how The Progress is laid out, the space is unique and efficiently designed, much roomier than it cohort next door, SBP with really cool balconies too!\n\nAs for the food I think if I went with just 1 other person I would have been more satisfied as I feel for each additional person they wasnt a full additional portion to go with. What I found awesome was as soon as we ordered they dropped a huge plate of \"snacks for the table.\" There were some great goodies in this amuse plate. The standouts to me were the poached leeks with trout roe, the spiced chicken jerky, and the squad pate.\n\nAs for dinner we had the following 6 courses in this order. They actually came out in two groups of three. First group was 1) kiwi and ricotta 2) black bass with turnips 3) Pecorino Truffle Roti. The Kiwi and Ricotta was absolutely amazing so fresh, so well balanced. The Black Bass was another huge hit, perfect smoke on the fish, reminded me of the smoked sturgeon dish we had at State Bird months ago and equally as good. The Roti was lackluster, the buttermilk truffle sauce was kinda bland and borning.\n\nThe next three dishes wew 1) Polpette of Rabbit and Pork 2) Lamb Merguez, yellow eye beans, squid and octopus 3) Grilled Beef miso mustard oyster sauce. Of the 3 the Merguez and seafood was the best dish but the octopus was a bit overcooked. The Beef I had thought was going to be a flavor bomb but was pretty light and nice surprise but it didnt deliver that flavor punch I wanted and might have been sous-vide just a bit too long as it lost its creaminess from the fat and was somewhat dry if not for the abundance of sauce. The polpette had flavor and were tender but lacking any cohesiveness to the dish and were dry as well.\n\nMy \"Jim\" drink I had was fabulous as were my counterparts mocktails. I'd give it another go again but it didnt live up to the hype or my expectations", "author": "Michael B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-27", "description": "The Progress is a new sister restaurant, opened by the same owners of State Bird Provisions. In fact, the two are physically, right next door. Whereas SBP is the dim sum service of haute cuisine, The Progress is the banquet counterpart where courses are served family-style for each table.\n\nService was superb. They were attentive to refilling your water, and checking on you throughout the meal. Moreover, the waiters were quite knowledgable about the menu and are able to describe the dishes to you, with detail and opinion. The only downside of the service, at least considering the amount you were paying, was that they do not exchange the dishware often enough between \"courses.\" Although we had at a reservation at 7:30, we were not seated until past 8pm. So, be prepared to wait, even with a reservation. \n\nUnlike SBP, The Progress has a full liquor license, which means cocktails, beer, extensive wine list and a standing bar that opens at 5pm. After a glance, my friend and I decided to go with The Concession (popcorn infused rum, Coca Cola syrup with Vermouth as its base). It was smooth, lingering on the tongue and rich on the taste buds. I loved it. In fact, I would come back just to explore their cocktail menu. \n\nTheir menu is composed of 12 dishes that seem to change, with the exception of some popular dishes like \"pig fries\" and \"smoked duck.\" Although, don't quote me on this because it has only opened for a month or so. Each person at your table is charged at a starting price of $65, with the entire table having the option of choosing 6 dishes. The courses are portioned to match the number of people at your table, which in our case was 4. Keep in mind that you are paying for about $20 per plate, rounding out to about $100pp with a drink or dessert.\n\n1) Shaved romanesco, herbs and pig (ear) fries: very interesting. The pig ears tasted like they were pickled and then deep fried. The combination of salty, briny, fried pig ears paired well with the shaved romanesco and herbs. \n2) Yuzu and olive oil marinated raw tuna with green daikon: This was delicious. The tuna was fresh. However, I wished they did something with the raw daikon and carrots so that they would embody more flavor and pair better. Overall the tuna was good but the other components were lost in this dish. \n3) Curry rabbit & chicken karaage: interesting. It took us a little bit to figure out whether we were eating rabbit or chicken. The chicken and rabbit karaage were placed over a layer of shredded carrots and saut\u00e9ed black trumpet mushrooms. Overall, the trumpet mushrooms and rabbit were my favorite parts of this dish. The mushrooms were earthy and cooked down to a silky perfection. The rabbit was well cooked, tender and carried a light hint of curry. The chicken was dry, lackluster and left much more to be desired. \n4) Treasure chest of fermented sausage, trout quenelles and pumpkin rice dumpling in a creamy pork broth: my favorite of the 6, mostly because each component was interesting and executed well. I've never had fermented sausage, which tasted almost like the kimchi in the soup. The trout quenelle's had the texture of Chinese fish balls but was much more flavorful. The pumpkin rice dumpling was soft, bouncy and extremely interesting. However, each person only gets one dumpling, which was barely the size of a quarter. The broth was light in taste but rich in texture. \n5) Lamb merquez with yellow eye beans, octopus and crispy squid: this one was good too. Possibly the 2nd contender. The lamb merquez was oversalted and chewy. Despite being the star of the dish, it tasted like slim jims. That said, I especially enjoyed the rest of the dish. The octopus was tender with a hint of smokiness from the grill. The squid was deep fried and the yellow eye beans were buttery and sweet. Overall, this dish came together well, except for the lamb merquez, which got lost in this dish.\n6) Dungeness crab, bok choy and tofu stir fry: it was good but not $20 good. The flavors reminded me a dashi-flavored stir fry agedashi tofu. The dungeness lump crab meat added flavor and luxurious touch to the dish, but that was about it; it was simply mixed in. \n\nMain dishes aside, I really enjoyed the \"banchan plate\" which came with 4 different bite-size banchan. Meager in portion, but very adventurous in interpretation and concept. My favorite was the fancy cheese-it cracker and malaysian style beef jerky.\n\nI appreciate the concept that State Bird Provisions upholds. Unfortunately, The Progress fell short of my expections. I enjoyed it the first time, but probably won't return.The beautiful ambiance couldn't make-up for the price per dish and the quality of it. Each dish recreated asian-fusion flavors, but in the end, the components were not executed as well as I wished. Moreover the construction and fusions of each dish felt disorganized and could have been more thought out. For the same style of food, I would rather return to SPB than The Progress, or save it for Benu", "author": "Jenny Z."}

It's delicious with sometimes surprisingly effective flavor and texture combinations; a careful balance between rustic and refined.\n\nThe restaurant design is unparalleled. Every detail is accounted for without seeming over the top. It's gorgeous from the smooth curved underside edges of the polished wood tables to the nook below the stairs next to the bar and the underside is the banquette benches. Someone took their time to do this right. \n\nBut, my favorite part of the experience has to be the staff. It was amazing how well put together and happy everyone was after being open for just two weeks! It's also refreshingly impressive that they have stripped away the pretentiousness often associated with high end dining by allowing the staff to choose their own attire. \n\nThere are signals here at The Progress which we will see others emulating for years to come.

We had read good reviews and wanted to try it  We really liked it and will definitely come back  Both the food and the service were very good.\n\nThey do a great job with a family-style, small plates approach. They have a semi-fixed menu where you pick 2 lighter appetizer items and 2 heavier entree items.  We decided to go with all seafood items:  halibut cerviche, smoked cod salad, grilled octopus, and a seafood noodle stir fry.  All of the dishes were very well-prepared and had great flavor combinations.  They were very accommodating with wheat allergies, and many dishes were either already or easily made gluten-free.  We would like to try some of the meat items next time.  \n\nWe shared a Pavlova for dessert along with Americanos.  Both were very good.\n\nThe Fillmore neighborhood was \"interesting\", and I wouldn't say it's in a wonderful neighborhood.  The front is fairly inauspicious and we missed it on the first drive-by.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-21", "description": "This place is awesome! The food is delicious: creative in flavor and texture, fresh, and unique.  Many of the dishes have an Asian flair and the meal start off with complimentary snacks, similar to its sister restaurant, State Bird Provisions.  Of the starting snacks, the croquette with wild mushroom sauce and pickles was my absolute favorite. The pecorino fancier was a really interesting mix of flavors - nutty, floral, peppery.  The carrots and summer squash was very good, I really enjoyed the flavors in the carrot mole.  The melon was underwhelming and didn't taste transformed in any way.  Besides that, each dish we ordered was delicious and had an element that was new/different and something none of us had really experienced before.  I also loved that they didn't shy away from bold flavors - spices and heat, which I think can be hard to find at fine dining establishments.  The cocktails were also very enjoyable.\n\nIt was expensive - over $100 per person when all was said and done, but none of us felt ripped off or upset about the bill.  It was an incredible meal with memorable moments in each dish. \n\nWe got:\nAl la carte seafood starter - \ncornmeal fried prawn heads - OMG so good. This was bar snack that we saw when we were walking in and requested an order and they were delicious.  Crispy, salty, and meaty with a tasty green aioli and the fresh parsley really added a nice counter point.\n\nMain meal - \nAvacado Wedge Salad - this was my least favorite of our 4 pre-fix dishes.  You only get 4 so choose wisely ;).  That being said it was still super tasty, I do love a good green goddess dressing.  However compared to the other dishes it just wasn't as special.  I did like that it had a nice kick with the fresh jalapeno pepper and crunch with the puffed quinoa. This is a good option if you're a. not that hungry and want a lighter dish b. a vegetarian (the menu has a lot of animal protein)\nLamb dumplings - WOW so good! The dumplings themselves are wrapped in a paper-thin tender dough and so well seasoned.  The flavors of cumin and coriander really came though and the lime cut through the richness of the lamb. \n\"creamed\" corn grits - we were the most unsure about ordering this dish, but were really glad we did.  It has a lot of different elements in it from tomatoes to fresh beans to sweet corn and seared salmon.  Together they create an amazing complex bite with sweet, salt, cream, crunch, bitter, and smoke all coming together.  Highly recommend this dish as its definitely a summer seasonal.\nKorean Steak - really tasty, this was my favorite dish of the bunch (which is saying A LOT).  It was the most simple dish medium rare steak sliced over crispy kimchee fried rice, but the flavors were bold and true and the texture of the chewy crunchy rice was awesome. It was a great follow up to the lighter dish of grits and salmon.  \n\nDessert-\nCake Roll - the peaches on this plate are TO DIE FOR.  The cake itself was a little on the tough side but the flavor was great. It all paired very well with the walnut sauce on the plate.  Next time I'd like to try the pavlova.\n\nOverall The Progress has moved into my list of favorite restaurants in SF and I can't wait to go back!", "author": "Sam L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-30", "description": "After hearing a lot of hype around the opening of The Progress, I was absolutely stoked when I managed to score a reservation when they opened it up on Open Table.  Over the holidays I had a lot of home cooking, and so it was a nice break to finally have someone do all the heavy lifting.  As you've probably already know, The Progress serves up dishes family style where you have the option to choose 6 dishes of your liking from their menu.  Obviously it helps to have a lot of friends with you, but I thought we did just fine with just the two of us. We went with the 5 savory dishes and 1 sweet dish for our choosings.  Here's what we ordered:\n\n- Dried duck with prune romesco & almonds\n- Matsutake dumplings with sake lees & kale\n- Sunchoke, rosemary & pecorino 'roti'\n- Don Watson's lamb scallopini with fava greens & cippolini\n- Grilled BN ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce\n- Sampler of honey cocoa ice cream & olio nuovo, jasmine tea poached fruits, greenage plum jam & ricotta whey AND triple citrus sorbet & star anise lime caramel gingered coconut floating island & candied buddha's hand\n\nBeverages:\nThe Concession\nKing's Crossing\n\nFavorite dish: Matsutake dumpling\nFavorite savory bites/tastes: Tempura broccoli appetizer\nFavorite sweet bites/tastes: Candied buddha's hand (SO YUM!) & honey cocoa ice cream\nLeast favorite dish: Grilled BN ranch beef\n\nService was pretty good, they seemed concerned about our well-being when the kitchen fell behind towards the end of our meal.  They gave us an extra glass of wine, and the sampler of the dessert was a surprise since we had initially checked the honey cocoa ice cream dish.  It did take us a little while for us to submit our order, but they made up for it with a beautiful presentation of some appetizer samplers that came with tempura broccoli, root vegetables & goat cheese, Chinese smoked sausage, and squid ink chip and trout spread.  Overall, it's hard not to compare The Progress with State Bird, and while I don't think we were quiet as blown away as we were at SBP, this was definitely a pleasant surprise and it really did meet my expectations.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-28", "description": "Last night I ate at State Bird, it is my absolute favorite restaurant, EVER. While waiting on our reservation, we noticed that Progress had opened. My husband popped in and came out with a grin. He said he snagged us a reservation for the very next day. Now seeing as I can eat State Bird every day and not be bored, I was SUPER excited to try out the new digs. \n\nTo start off, Progress is a much bigger space. It has a small bar with nook tables and a bigger restaurant area. It also seems like there is two upstair rooms for bigger parties. We got seated at a communal table in the middle, sharing it with another couple. \n\nFirst things first, Progress has quite the array of drinks, including cocktails. A welcome improvement from the wine and beer selection next door. While I didn't try a drink, it did look good, and the prices were on par with the regular SF price ($9-$14) for a cocktail.\n\nThe menu is array of dishes that you can pair together, making a 6 course menu for $65 a person. You can add extra dishes for $10 each. Upon ordering we were delighted with a complimentary appetizer. It was a scrumptious large plate with broccoli tempura, trout mouse (reminiscent of the one at state bird) and some picked carrots. It was great, just enough for a small bite but it had me eager and waiting for the menu ahead.\n\nThe first two dishes we had were the sun choke 'roti' and wild mushroom and pickled nori. These two dishes I enjoyed very much. The roti reminded me of a Indonesian type flaky roti, not a tortilla indian type. I actually had a chance to speak to the chef about it, and he said he was determined to have a outstanding bread dish, similar to the garlic bread at SB. He did well with this edition. It's served standing in a dip of ranch, which is unlike any other ranch you've ever had. According to our waitress it's made with sunflower root, who would have thought! The wild mushroom dish was good, interesting with a japanese flair. You can definitely taste the noori and the sesame seeds.. I liked it.  \n\nThis is where I start docking stars. In my 7 or so times visiting State Bird, it's a consistent 5 in my book. Is it fair to be holding Progress to the same standards? I think so. It's the same head chef and it's actually attached to it!\n\nWe were then presented with the spiced lamb/fava beans dish and the 'treasure chest'. The lamb had a powerful rub but the meat was tender. I felt like the rub overpowered the brilliance of the meat, and it would have been better with just one coat, instead of the 5. The 'treasure chest' was a mixture of different foods, sausage, tofu, fish and onions, and a warm pork broth poured on top. I thought the tofu was slightly out of place, the sausage was great and the fish was meh. The broth was good, however it was slightly salty for my taste.\n\nThe next and last savory dish was the cod fried rice. This is where i lost it. It was a piece of cod with rice, some tartar sauce  and various toppings and fried calamari on top. It sounds great, but it was just off..and SALTY as the sea. I tried at least 4 bites until I couldn't take it anymore. It was too much salt to handle. I looked over and noticed my husband couldn't stomach it anymore. We had a good 3/4's of the dish still in the plate and couldn't get through it. We were pretty full at that point so just decided to call it quits. Slightly upset that this salt had over powered the previous dishes we did enjoy. We did tell the waitress and she took it away and apologized.\n\nFor dessert we had ordered the sorbet with 'coconut island'. The waitress brought out our dessert along with the other dessert - cocoa ice cream and fruit, on the house. I'm guessing this was to make up for the salty dish. It was nice of them to do. I'm not much of a sorbet person, so maybe it's just me, but I found the ice cream to be way too tart. The 'coconut island' was the best part, but even then it was just okay. It was like a merengue top on a bed of sweet milk. The other dessert was a deep flavored cocoa ice-cream on tart huckleberry sauce with a side of jellied fruit. The ice-cream was good, however again the huckleberry sauce threw me off because of the tart-ness. I'm a huge dessert person, and at the end of both these desserts I was left unsatisfied.\n\nMy final review? Progress has a way to go. It may be the same chef, but moving one door down did a number on the food. The service is great, the atmosphere feels amazing, and it has the same charm as next door, it just needs that phenomenal menu. Maybe it's still in it's early stages and they are working out the kinks. I hope so. Will I be back? Yes, I'd like to try this place again in about 6 months. But until then, I'll still line up next door.", "author": "Bevi K."}

All I had was the address of the place and the request to \"dress up for dinner.\" I came to The Progress with no expectations and no knowledge of its existence, and I left feeling satiated and satisfied. Sounds like a win to me.\n\nFrom the outside, the place looks like a swanky nightclub or a young SOMA startup trying to close their Series A funding round. The surrounding area was a bit too colorful for my liking: the potheads and the homeless were all over the place. Neither the cold nor the smells seemed to deter the State Bird Provisions hopefuls who lined up outside of the front door before 5:30 pm. The Progress is a sister restaurant of State Bird... actually, more like its conjoined twin. They are right next to one another.\n\nWhen we showed up at 5:30, the place was empty. A few people were congregating at the bar, while the hostess was nowhere to be found. We peeked into the dining room, and it kinda looked like the locker room before an important game. The waiters were being briefed on whatever was going to \"go down\" that day, while the patrons waited.\n\nWhen they finally showed us to the table, we noticed that the decor was simple yet elegant. Industrial and functional, it conveyed a simple message: it's all about the food. The menu was printed on thick paper, and we were told to choose 4 items for $58. The waiter inquired about our food preferences and helped us eliminate the items that wouldn't work for us. My sister and I settled on sunchoke roti, celery root ravioli, quail fried rice and yellowtail. We also opted for a potato cloud with caviar (a $10 per person addition) which was totally worth its weight in gold.\n\nEvery dish we ordered was inventive, tasty and perfectly presented. The potato cloud tasted like the fluffiest mashed potato puree you'll ever have with a surprisingly generous serving of caviar. The sunchoke roti's only shortcoming was that there wasn't enough of this deep fried deliciousness. The celery root ravioli were perfectly complemented by a quince puree, creating a light and flavorful combo. The yellowtail was cooked perfectly, medium rare if you will, and the greens they selected were great. Finally, the fried rice was crispy and flavorful, topped with strips of juicy quail meat. I can still taste it.\n\nDessert failed us a little. The \"floating island\" or \"ile flottante\" is one of my favorite things ever. A soft merengue floating in a \"pool\" of creme anglaise - I mean, how could one go wrong? The Progress' version was rather pedestrian. Even the Americano was served in a tiny glass. \"Where's the rest of it?\" I kept thinking. At least the other drinks totally made up for it: the old school hustle (made with rye AND peated whiskey) and the buttery manhattan (which tasted like a perfect combination of bourbon and butterscotch) are highly recommended. \n\nSolid experience and good value for the money!", "author": "Yan G."}

Everything is served family-style with a minimum commitment of 6 courses at $65/person and going up from there depending on your appetite.\n\nWhile everything was derricious, there were a number of notables like the exquisitely soft smoked duck and marinated yellowfoot mushrooms & dried plum.  Meaty, earthy awesomeness with some lovely acidity for balance.  The shaved cauliflower-herbs & pig fries tasted like they were just pulled from the garden hours before and I loved the variety of porcine parts used for the fries to provide a little surprise from piece to piece.\n\nFor the vegetable-inclined, the black butter butternut squash with caramelized onion & swiss chard turned out to be surprisingly hearty in addition to its depth of flavor accentuated by the soft sweetness of the onions.\n\nAnd that aromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste...ri-freaking-diculous!  Anyone familiar with Chinese squab preparations will remember that the birds far more often than not turned out dry and bland.  In this case, the tenderness and moisture upon first bite made us all seriously question if it was real squab.  Cray?  Yes.\n\nThe polpette of rabbit & pork with blood orange was solid though the former component was difficult to discern.  A good mix of savory flavors and citrus acidity.  The lamb merguez with octopus & crispy squid was very nicely cooked, just not particularly standout in its combination.  Lastly, our 'treasure chest' of fermented sausage, trout quenelles & pumpkin-rice dumpling in a 'creamy' pork broth was certainly unique.\n\nAs for sweet offerings, they were all fantastic with the combination of milk chocolate-black lager ice cream, cocoa sable & caraway seed being very much reminiscent of the bird's nest dessert aka crack in a bowl at SBP.  Get it.\n\nService here was good though quite a bit more distant than at SBP where there's so much more interaction with the staff presenting the vast array of plates.  Overall, the food here is top notch and absolutely on par with its big sibling next door.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-28", "description": "This is an overdue review. My bf and I went here for our two year anniversary and he made the reservation a month in advance. This is one of the hottest new restaurants in SF and comes from the hands of people who brought you State Bird Provisions. It is poppin' so definitely make a reservation if you can or be prepared for a wait. They reserve a portion of their tables for walk ins though so definitely come try your luck.\n\nAt The Progress it's a bit different than State Bird where you get 6 courses for $65 and you mark off the menu which 6 you want to try. They have 4 different sections - appetizers, entrees and desserts and you can 6 of any of those. You don't have to pick a dessert if you don't want to which is nice or you can get all apps. \n\nEveryone gets an amuse-bouche platter as a starter and for ours we had homemade cheese crackers (it was okay), tempura oyster, baby radish in house made hummus, and homemade beef jerky. Everything else was very good minus the cheese cracker which I thought was underwhelming and kind of strange to be included with the other food.\n\nWe ordered the yuzu and olio nuovo marinated raw tuna with green daikon, shaved cauliflower-herbs with pig fries, pecorino 'roti' with black truffle buttermilk, 'treasure chest' of fermented sausage, trout quenelles and pumpkin mochi in a creamy pork broth, and lastly aromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste. \n\nEverything we had was fantastic. My favorite dishes of the night were the pig fries - bits of fried pig ears and pork jowl. So delicious when eaten with the shaved cauliflower and I think there was romanesco too. Little bites of fatty goodness that exploded in your mouth like an umami fireworks show. \n\nAnother fantastic dish was the treasure chest in which the house made fermented sausage was something I've never had before but definitely the best sausage I've ever eaten. It was just a very unique flavor and it's hard to describe, it tastes aged but in the good way like a dry-aged steak tastes. It tasted very meaty and unctuous which I personally really like. Also that broth? Omg it rivals any good ramen broth I've ever had. You could taste the hours and hours of the pork that simmered away to make it. Only thing was that I wish there had been more pumpkin mochi. We only had one piece each and it was so delicious I wanted more haha.\n\nAlso the pecorino roti with the black truffle buttermilk sauce? I've never had anything like it before and it's something I wish I could everyday for like breakfast or something. It wasn't too heavy or rich which I thought it would after a few bites. Instead there a highly addictive quality to it that makes you want more when you're done. \n\nAll in all a fantastic meal that left me wondering how they could make each bite so perfectly balanced. Each bite had just the right amount of salty, sweet, umami, and acidity.", "author": "Kaisi G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-02", "description": "Overall, I really enjoyed all of the food. Most of it was very well balanced and the ingredients were incredibly fresh. You definitely could taste the quality immediately. It's hard to say anything negative about the experience, but it felt like the price point was a little bit off. With two drinks and food, each of us were looking at bills well over $100. Given the quantity of food, it felt like a little much. I would definitely enjoy eating some of the dishes again, but I can't honestly imagine that I will make it back any time soon.\n\nComparing this to State Bird may be unfair since they are trying to be independent establishments. But with the close proximity, and food/plating style, comparison comes naturally. Both restaurants have a distinct charm with well-trained and attentive wait staff. For me though, State Bird is the winner by a long shot serving up a a more creative menu with better portion sizes.\n\nLocal kiwi with super-fresh ricotta, almonds & pickled sunchokes: The ricotta was freshly made in house and the texture was divine. A lovely, fresh beginning to the meal.\n\nPorcini & mt. tam dumpling with nettle salsa verde: The dumplings had a creamy, soft porcini mushroom filling. I could have eaten about 10 more.\n\nRed snapper with turnips and creme fraiche: Probably my favorite item of the day. The snapper was fresh and the sauce really complimented the flavors.\n\nPecorino 'roti' with perigord truffle buttermilk: The roti was flaky and delicious and the buttermilk sauce was light and flavorful. Not all bites had the truffle shavings, but the ones that did were divine.\n\nDungeness crab, bok choy & tofu 'stir-fry': I need to figure out how to recreate this light ginger sauce. The crab meat was fresh and delicious.\n\nAromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste: Served with small pieces of lettuce, the squab was tender and perfectly cooked. The seasoning was very spice forward, but didn't overpower the squab at all.\n\nGrilled Five Dot Ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce: The ordered this as an add on ($10/person) for three since I don't eat red meat.\n\nPro-Tip: at the bar, you can order off the menu a la carte. Might honestly be better value for your money.", "author": "Vinitha R."}

We also loved the lamb tartare and the tomato / roti dish - both were very flavorful and unique!  The roasted kale and mushroom dish was pretty good, though not out of this world.

So it had high expectations. \n\nThe menu has a 6 course for $65 per person, in which you can had any array of the 6 dishes. we placed our order for the Roti, wild mushroom for apps and Spiced lamb, treasure chest, cod fried rice for entrees and coconut island for desert. \n\nBefore we started we were greeted with a amazingly displayed complementary appetizer, which has a perfect broccoli tempura, trout mouse and pickled carrots, Progress was of to a great start and had me looking forward to the rest of the menu. \n\nIn came the two apps the sun choke roti and the wild mushroom, the roti had a very Malaysian flare to it and as a premier bread dish, this was splendid. We had a chance to talk to Chef Stuart about it and he mentioned that he wanted bread dishes similar to their ever so popular garlic burrata and this does it justice. the roti in itself is amazing, but the dip which is ranch made our of sunflower root, ummm mind blown....\nthe Mushroom dish served with nori and sesame seeds was delicious as well. and had us looking forward to the entrees. \n\nWe had a great build up so far, in comes the spiced lamb. there were not kidding when they said spiced, this was heavily seasoned, maybe a little too heavy. I love lamb and i usually love every lamb dish, but this just didn't have it for me, it was a bit salty and the many coats of spices on it didn't do any favors. this was sub par. \n\nthe treasure chest had to be my favorite dish of the night next to the roti. the sausage in it was scrumptious, absolutely delicious and the broth in spite of being salty was delicious none the less, highly recommend. \n\nthe Cod fried rice, I am not sure what happened here, but it was salty beyond belief, completely ruined the experience. I felt like the chef had a generous salty hand with the other dishes, but this went over the top. had a few bites and couldn't stomach it anymore. had me reaching for the water to try to take the salt taste off. \n\non the whole the entrees in my opinion need a lot more work in the kitchen. \n\nfor desert we order the coconut island but the waitress got us the other desert cocoa ice cream with fruit and comped it as the other dish was too salty.\nthe coconut island was tart but manageable. as dessert go this was sub par as well. the cocoa ice cream came with huckleberry cream and was decent. but nothing i would think about or be memorable. \n\nOn the whole The Progress has a good start and then came to an abrupt halt and i was sorely disappointed.

I've heard of State Bird Provisions through foodies and reviews in the city (I'm relatively new to SF) but was unable to get a reservation (you need to book wayyyy in advance or hope to get a seat by waiting at 4.30). The Progress is the sister restaurant to SBP. \n\nAt first glance - Similar to SBP, and right next door, there is no signage to indicate the establishment. The interior was chic with good lighting and decent acoustics (it was not too loud and you could hear the person sitting at your table). When we were seated, there was a sign at our table to indicate a reservation and a handwritten 'Happy Birthday' on the card - it was very cute! \n\nThe staff - My water glass was always full (and I drink a lot of water) and the servers were very attentive. Maybe too attentive though. As it turned out our server was busy so another server hastily served us our dessert before being able to place the requested birthday candle on the birthday girl's dessert. Oops!\n\nThe food - As a person raised on sharing food and family style meals, what's great about this restaurant is that you pick four (4) food options from the menu (mix of apps and entrees) and it's served family style in beautiful, instaworthy, handmade ceramic dinnerware. The bites are truly bites - but absolutely delectable. And the mains are truly mains --- there is plenty to eat with portions relative to the number of guests. Simply, I'd be surprised if you were still hungry after the meal! \n\nThe drinks and dessert were spot on. I'd go back just for the Blueberry Pie, mainly for the Cream Cheese ice cream (so yum!). If you can't get a reservation for a meal, definitely don't hesitate to stop by for a drink and/or dish at the bar.\n\nOverall, The Progress is definitely a sure thing if you want an excellent meal and good dining experience.

Family style meals.  6 courses for 65.00 a person with a few snacks thrown in for good measure.  At the end of the day, feels like a steal.\n\nWe went all savory, after spending the afternoon hiking the Presidio and eating Bi-Rite ice cream.\n\nHad the following:\n\n1. Black rice fried oysters with kimchi \"picatta\".  One of my 2 favorite dishes of the night and one of the best plates of food I had in a week laced with exceptional food. \n\n2. Potato sauerkraut dumplings with plum preserves.  And....my other favorite dish of the night.  Simple, and absolutely delicious.  \n\n3. Abalone.  Great ingredient.  Wasn't overly fond of the preparation.\n\n4. Oven roasted maitakes.  Good rule of thumb is that everything roasted in a wood oven simply tastes better.  These were incredibly tasty, yet the dish was slightly one note to me.  Then again, mushrooms are not my favorite ingredient.\n\n5.  Ling cod with black garlic and smoke potatoes.  Fish was slightly overcooked, but a very flavorful dish.\n\n6. Lamb merguez with calamari and octopus.  The last favorite of the meal.  Delicious smorgasbord in a bowl.\n\n\n\nWine list was very good and helped myself to a few glasses.  Would have been nice to see an expanded beer list given the great selections to choose from in the Golden State (I'm looking at you Pliny).\n\nVery good service, and one of the 3 best meals I had on the entire trip.

Given the fact that I was pleased as punch after having tried State Bird, I was super stoked to learn that my friends made reservations at The Progress for my birthday (a joint one, actually, with another close friend of mine).\n\nThe menu varies by season and changes as often as they feel like it so I'm not entirely sure how objective I can be, but if it helps, we did order some of their more acclaimed dishes including the pig fries, the lamb tartare, the roti, and the treasure chest.\n\nNothing melded together and even individually, nothing really knocked my socks off either. The treasure chest came with an incredibly rich and overwhelming salty broth (and I normally love a good pungent, super-salty, fermented anything . . . but here, not so much). The lamb tartare was tasty enough and I enjoyed the rice crackers it came with -- a nice touch in lieu of the traditional crostini, but it was still unmemorable. The roti was tasty, but it's very difficult to complain about any fresh-off-the-pan flattened carb. We also got some heinous beef tenderloin dish that had a nonsensical miso gravy that still makes me cringe as I write this, months later. It was salty, one-note, and rubbery. \n\nAlso, it was noted several times (while making the reservation, in confirming the reservation, and prior to ordering) by the restaurant staff that we were celebrating two birthdays . . . and still zero acknowledgment in the form of a free dessert (maybe expecting this was too entitled . . . but would it kill you to stick a candle in the tartare or something)?\n\nI have absolutely no reservations about being boxed into a prix fixe style of ordering if that's what the restaurant conceptually is all about. I will, however, and do take up issue with the fact that I found literally zero of the six dishes that we were forced to order worth a second visit.\n\nGo next door to State Bird Provisions instead.

I'm a huge fan of state bird, so the bar is definitely high, as State Bird is a hard act to follow.\n\nI had a planned a large party dinner here for my bf's bday.  We had the semi private mezzanine area with a set course menu.  They started out by bringing several plates of snacks, which were absolutely beautiful.  However, I know we were all wondering if this was out entire meal, and if we had to stop at McDonald's after.  Thankfully this is a gift from the kitchen, and really gave you a good sample of many different flavors.  \n\nNow on to the entrees.  My favorites were the treasure (amazing broth, and the mochi a pleasure surprise), and the squab which paired beautifully well with the home made korean hot sauce.  I was most excited about the truffled roti but sadly this was my least favorite.  Maybe of us didn't even eat our share as it had an add bitter taste.  I'm not sure if it was under cooked, or if it was in the sauce, be it just didn't work for me.\n\nOtherwise all the food was great, very inventive and creative.  Why not 5 stars?  I've gone to many michelin restaurants that are hard to get into.  However despite getting reservations at state bird 4 times, this is probably the hardest place I've ever reserved.  Since my party size exceed the max allowable on opentable I had to contact them by email.  I already had an opentable reservation for 6 as a backup, but emailing them was an absolutely nightmare.  I had initially contacted the restaurant two months in advance, and this was followed up by about 15 emails, and 2 phone calls, and in the end to have nothing confirmed until the week before it.

When we arrived, we checked our backpacks into their complementary coat check.  The hostess notified us that our table wasn't ready yet, but I found out why, later.  So, we waited around for about 25 minutes until we were seated upstairs.  The restaurant space definitely opens much larger than what the entrance way initially revealed.\n\nTheir drink menu had many flavorful beer options.  To be honest, I was a little skeptical of the six-course family-style menu, particularly, with its sufficiency.  I went to the gym earlier, so I was carrying a voracious appetite, and I've been burned too many times before, leaving somewhere hungry after blowing through plate after plate of $15 \"tapas.\" But this was not the case here-- at the end of the meal, I was thoroughly stuffed.  Let's go to the tape!  (disclaimer: I can't remember what they called each of their dishes, but I'll try to describe what we selected as best as I can)\n\nBanchan\n1st:  Asparagus with Mascarpone\n2nd: Mushrooms & Kale\n3rd: Treasure Chest a/k/a sausage in a \"6-hour\" tonkatsu\n4th: Lamb Merguez\n5th: Lobster & Bok Choy\n6th: Spiced Squab Lettuce Wraps\n\nEvery dish had an interesting ethnic influence. The highlights were 1) the asparagus, which started off our meal with a blast of sweet and savory freshness, 2) the mushroom-kale, packed with flavor and fiber, and 3) the lobster, cooked to juicy perfection.  The lamb merguez was just okay, and the treasure chest didn't quite work for me.  The tanginess of the sausage and the creamy tonkatsu was a strange combination.\n\nWe ended up finishing our meal somewhere close to 11:00pm.  Each course came out at a leisurely pace, giving us ample time to dissect and digest each complex creation.  Thankfully, I had nothing important to do the next morning, so this wasn't a problem for me.  I would definitely suggest allotting about two hours when eating here.\n\nOverall, The Progress was a very enjoyable dining experience.

Crispy pig fries - delicious and rich in flavor!

Will order again if it was on the menu.\n- butter clams with kimchi piccata: clams had a strong sea-taste to it as if it wasn't fresh, so I wasn't exactly impressed with this dish\n- treasure chest with fermented sausage, trout & dumplings: Many like this dish, but I felt as if it was too salty for us. The sausage and the broth itself. The dumplings and trout were fine, but nothing that wows us.\n- squab with chili paste: The squab is probably my second favorite of all the things we had, but it was just a piece of leg, so I felt like it was hard to fully enjoy that between two people. Good in flavor but a bit towards the saltier side, but not bad.\n- grilled five-dot ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce: not bad, really liked the veggies. The sauce was too overpowering in the dish, and the beef lacked a strong flavor of its own when it was drenched in the sauce.\n- sesame almond tarta with houjicha cream, kumquats and cherries: Pretty good! Liked the sesame tart part best.\n- salted caramel floating island, coconut sorbet and strawberries: I liked the strawberry best in this entire dish.\n\nProbably won't be back, but nice to have given it a try.

If I drop that type of dough on a nice dining experience, things should be perfect. \n\nI really wanted to love this place. I love the concept of family style dining. For a set price of $70/person you get 4 appetizers (fixed), and 4 main entrees. There are also additional adders for ~$15 each and dessert for $10 each. The food was beautifully presented and plentiful. We had a bottle of Viognier that was wonderful with a dry pineapple/banana nose and a buttery finish. \n\nFOOD: We ordered the halibut ceviche (pretty but lacked flavor. Not recommended), the dry fried beans (delicious but they forgot to add the shiitake mushrooms), chicken polpette (flavorful as well but they forgot the figs until we asked where they were. The server gave it to us on the side) and grilled pork (the pork was well seasoned and cooked, but the crushed broccoli reminded me of homemade baby food). There are four additions you can opt to add for an extra charge. We chose the tempura striped shrimp for $15/dozen. The server (who was very nice) recommended to eat these whole. My friend and I tried it but we both agreed that the shell was scratching our throats too much. Either it needed to be fried more to break down the shell or younger. For dessert we shared a goats milk cheesecake that came with roasted cherry tomatoes and a sesame crusted cookie. Strangely I was not expecting it to be such a savory dessert. It was good, but I guess I was in the mood for something sweet. \n\nIn addition to the food mishaps, I did not appreciate the fact that my chair was bumped by everyone that passed, even the servers. It didn't lend to a relaxing eating experience. As well, we asked for leftovers to be wrapped, but then the server didn't bring it to us; and we forgot about it until we arrived home. \n\nSo there it is folks! We had a well cooked meal with tons of mistakes, bumps and forgets that drove the ratings down for its chaotic nature. What could have been an amazing meal was instead disappointing, especially since half of the two last dishes were to be packed and we didn't have it.

Serving each other from a family style dish, when there are so many little components on the platter seems a little silly and too fussy to deal with.  With the way the food was constructed and presented, it just seems better suited to be a 6 course tasting menu with individual dishes for each person.  \n\nAs far as the wine program goes, I love many of the producers on the list, but like many wine programs around town these days, its basically the same over and over again - small batch, artisan producers making the same styles of wine.    \n\nAgain, the food tasted great and the cocktail and beverage program were of high quality, but something just didn't sit right with me.", "author": "Grape C."}

You can imagine my excitement when I heard Stuart Brioza and his wife Nicole Krasinski were opening a new sister restaurant, The Progress. I was thrilled!! Within the first week of the opening I was planning to visit with girlfriends.  It was super exciting getting to experience The Progress just after they opened and see how well prepared, organized and perfect the team was. No surprise if you know how strong of a team State Bird Provisions has. However, typically the first week or two of an opening there are still kinks to work through. That was not the case at the new Progress Restaurant.\n\nUpon arriving we were seating at our table on the second floor with fabulous views of the main floor dining room.  Talk about a killer view. I felt like queen of the restaurant. Kidding, but it felt pretty great being on the upper level overlooking the open kitchen, the dining room and all of the excitement! Emily, a familiar face from my many visits next door at State Bird Provisions (which is literally next to The Progress) greeted us and explained the menu and what we were in store for.  The menu is choose your own adventure family-style menu where you select 6 dishes to share. We landed on 5 and asked for Emily's suggestion on the 6th. Everything we ordered was wonderful.  We started with a dish compliments of the Chef (1st food plate below) then we had a few salads, a few entrees and of course saved room for dessert. I have since returned to The Progress a second time which was equally as amazing as the first visit. The only change is the menu has evolved so a few of my favorites like the naan and a beet/ricotta salad have already moved on replaced with new exciting options.\n\nYou may be wondering, what is it about The Progress that's so great? Well, aside from the fresh, delicious, inventive food the atmosphere and the service complete the experience. Service is a huge part of your dining experience. So when a staff is attentive, on it, knows the menu, and can answer any question no matter how odd it is I am impressed. I also appreciate when the team keeps an eye on my water, wine (#1 priority), and ensures that the entire visit is seamless. That is exactly what the team at The Progress does. And the best part is, they're not in your face about it, it's subtle but well done. As evident, I highly recommend you check out The Progress for yourself. The food is just as amazing as you'd expect from the State Bird & Provisions renowned Chefs Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski with a killer team, amazing atmosphere, and overall just fabulous! 1525 Fillmore St. San Francisco, CA. 94115. 415-673-1294. \n\nThanks for checking out my post I hope you enjoy dining with The JetSetting Fashionista.

This became a trend as the next time we went we were unable to get a table on another Wednesday night. So we'd meet each other at the Progress in the bar area. \n\nDuring this visit I had a glass of their white wine and a fish kimchi little bits appetizer. The appetizer was fried trout with a kimchi sauce. It was amazing and flavorful! There is separate menu for the bar area. The bar staff was very helpful and let me taste a few white wine option until I chose. The menu has several appetizers and small plates. In addition there are a few entrees to choose from. \n\nThe location is very spacious and doesn't have the name on the outside of the restaurant. I visited several other places on Filmore street for an entire year until I realized that State Bird Provision and the Progress were hidden in plain sight.

Nothing to grab them with other than fingers.  Not very sanitary so please add toothpicks.  Small plates of a vegetable wrap with an avocado sauce was passed.  It was okay.  They were size wise the wide of a cigar and about no more than 1.5 inches high.  And the last thing I ate were beef on skewers.  Very tender and flavorful.

Normally I would consider posting on yelp, but in this case, since in the past several months I had such an amazing experience at your sister restaurant, I thought I would do you the courtesy of emailing you directly.\n\nWe were greeted, and put at the bar, got two cocktails and they were to put it mildly, gross.  I had the house liquor, bitters, orange peel, it was inexplicably cacao soaked rye and tasted in a sad way like a Christmas chocolate orange, my wife's cocktail was black butter washed, but you forgot to strain off the fat, so it tasted like fatty whiskey in the worst possible way, it took us probably 4 courses to get them down.  our guests had 2 more cocktails which were fine, not good, but acceptable considering the first 2 cocktails.\n\nWe were seated, 2 menus were placed in front of us, and we didn't see a server for at least 10 minutes to at least explain the idea of the menu to us.  we had not eaten at this restaurant before, we knew the basic concepts, but the server would just creep on our sheet looking for us to complete our 6 dots without actually telling us what to do here.  \n\nRegarding serving size, suffice it to say, for a 4 top, we paid an average of 41.50 for each dish we received, and we had trouble seeing any value in these dishes.  There were some hits (the soup with sour sausage), but $41.50 for two bites each was steep, even by SF standards.  The most brutal was getting 4 delicious dumplings with peas and mt. tam cheese.  They tasted good, but nothing new or exciting considering the assumed cost of the dish. I understand the cost of doing business in SF is brutal,especially opening a second restaurant, but $40 for four dumplings is hard to swallow...\n\nEither way, throughout our meal we were hit inconsistently with dishes, and when we wouldn't finish one in time we were asked by 4 different servers if we were finished, which was ironic considering we couldn't get anyone to talk to us about the actual menu to begin with.  We brought our own bottle of wine, and before our server plopped down our non wine glasses, he told our table condescendingly how much corkage was, which I have never experienced in my life.\n\nIn particular, the final dish was embarrassingly banal, polpette with no real flavor to speak of and as we finished (forced along repeatedly by multiple servers) we found our water pitcher taken from us while still full, and when there was a sip left in each of our glasses, if we looked away, our glasses would be taken without a word.  All told, we left less than 2 hours after our reservation began, and we felt needlessly rushed throughout our dining experience.\n\nAs i said, a few months ago, we had a truly amazing meal at state bird, and we were so excited to bring our friends to the progress as a gift for their wedding. Needless to say, our experience from start to finish was... honestly, pretty horrifically bad, and considering what we had heard about your new restaurant, we were genuinely surprised and saddened by our experience.\n\nthanks for reading about our experience, and I hope this is at least useful for you to read.", "author": "Jonathan F."}

We were so excited when we walked in the door and were greeted by the soothing sound of a cocktail shaker. The menu is family style and they bring you a wonderful assortment of bites to enjoy with your cocktail while you jointly select from the small menu which 4 plates to share. The fried grits with a shrimp head sauce were to die for. The food was beautiful, luxurious and really well prepared. The smoked salmon with peas and morels was the standout for me. \n\nUnfortunately our experience was really marred by the service. We felt terribly rushed through our entire meal despite ordering a bottle of wine that we clearly planned on finishing. We were pressed to scrape off bites from our plates as staff hovered to take them away and when the dessert menu came we were repeatedly pressed to make our choice (I lost count after the 6th stop by of one of a bevy of staff).  We finally asked if they were rushing to turn our table and noted that we really just wanted to enjoy our wine before moving to our next course. Then our waiter tried to take away our dessert menu entirely presumably to bring our check. I stopped him and said we probably would get something but we're not quite ready. We finally gave up and just ordered the chocolate cherry cake (itsy bitsy BTW) and were then rushed through eating that (staff trying to take the plate while there was clearly still a fair amount of the portion left that we were enjoying). Despite the quality of the food and spending 200+ on dinner, we left annoyed. \n\nIt's a shame that with all the care that went into the menu and food prep that the front of the house couldn't just let us relax and savor the meal.

Not cool.  \n\nThe bartender was sweet and took good care of me.  The service at our table was also very good, but I would prefer to have one server throughout the meal.  There must have been six different people who asked us questions, delivered food, and took things away.  Weird.  The worst was when dessert was delivered by yet another new person (just when I thought I had met every employee in the place).  Our desserts were auctioned off, e.g. \"OK, who ordered the ice cream?\"  That's fine at a casual restaurant, but at this price point, they should have their game tight.\n\nThe food was creative, with some good things and others that I didn't care for.  They require you to order six items and pay a fixed price.  I would like to have the option of ordering just two or three items if I am not that hungry or can't find six things on the menu that appeal to me.  At a place that is already expensive, this does not give you the option of ordering light and keeping the tab under control.\n\nI left with ringing in my ears, a sore throat from trying to talk with my dinner companions (which required raised voices), and a sore butt and numbness in my legs from sitting on a bench with no cushion.

It says right on the menu 6 dishes/$65 per person and then I think it's $10 per additional dish, so there's essentially no way out of it. You're basically forced into sharing and they go so far as to provide you with a pencil and paper menu to write on (as if you're at a dim sum place) which seems a far cry from the usual fine dining experience.\n\nI'm becoming tired of restaurants all saying they're family style - it seems like a cheap way to force people to order more food than they sometimes need (more than 1 dish per person) and it can also be challenging depending on who you are dining with. Some people are vegetarian, have allergies, are pregnant, don't eat seafood, are not adventurous eaters (the list goes on). There are also people that you may not feel comfortable sharing with (your boss with bad table manners or your picky friend who asks for substitutions on everything). I find it much easier to stick to a traditional ordering format unless you are with a bunch of people who you are very close to and you all want to try the same things.\n\nAs for the food...delicious!! The real standouts to me were the vegetable dishes which were AMAZING. We got the most delicious nectarine salad where the fruit was at the absolute pinnacle of ripeness, a roasted fig dish covered in a light, warm cheese fondue(!), an heirloom tomato salad w/pieces of roasted tomato with warm, crispy cheese croquettes and an insane roasted cauliflower in romesco sauce dish that was so hearty and savory you would have never imagined it contained only vegetables. The meat entrees we had were very good, but not nearly as creative or outstanding as the veggie dishes (we had the chicken and pork).\n\nOur waitress was very nice and the service overall was very good. I loved the interior decor, though found some of the tables a little too long which made it hard to talk across the table without yelling. Overall, the food was delicious and interesting.

My friend told me that it was the newest restaurant by the SBP team, and since I'd been in and out of town over the past few months, I had no idea it even existed.\n\nSo I made note to try, and after the holidays, I looked online and managed to score an early dinner reservation a few days later.  My husband was delighted that I was asking him on a \"date,\" and off we went.\n\nBeautiful decor, similar in style to SBP.  I want my future bathroom to look the way theirs did: glittery copper walls and a teal door.  Seriously, I had to tell my husband to go into the restroom to see what he'd be living with in the future.\n\nYou choose 6 items from the menu to share as a table for $65/person.  7 items is $75/person, and so on.  We ended up with 7 since too many things looked good, and a drink each (btw, the drinks are strong - I had to enlist my husband to help finish mine, since I was recovering from a cold and didn't want to pass out on the table).  The menu items change slightly based on what's in season, so don't expect the same thing every time you go.\n\nHighlights:\n+ Shaved cauliflower herbs & pig fries: these are thinly sliced fried pork ears (YUM), with a tangy spicy accompaniment of cauliflower.  I could eat this all day, every day.\n+ Aromatic spiced squab: dip a piece in the chili paste, then wrap with a radicchio leaf and eat.  Like a lettuce wrap, but way better.\n+ Farro spezzato rustico with pork jowl & octopus: almost like a sophisticated porridge.  I'm usually not a huge fan of octopus, but I almost picked up the bowl and licked it clean.\n\nJust okay:\n+ Smoked black cod fried rice: wasn't a fan of the aioli that came with it; I would've liked it better without, and I kept comparing it to SBP's duck fried rice (which I LOVE).\n+ Treasure chest of fermented sausasge, shrimp quenelles, tofu and pumpkin-rice dumpling in a pork broth: Loved the broth, tofu and the pumpkin-rice dumplings, didn't really like the other stuff because they didn't seem to mesh well with the broth.\n\nMeh, skip:\n- Porcini & Mt. Tam dumpling with nettle salsa verde: my problem with \"fusion\" food is that they create things for the sake of being creative, instead of for the actual taste.  Prime example is this dish; nothing tasted good together, though separately all items are delicious on their own.\n\nBecause I don't eat beef and I'm allergic to oysters, I didn't have any of the grilled BN beef, but my husband said it was okay.\n\nOverall a good dining experience with wonderful staff and ambiance.  Our entire meal, including one drink each, tax and tip, was close to $250.  We did have leftovers, and I don't recommend getting more than 6 dishes for the table, as it's a deceptively large amount of food because it's just a few bites per plate.\n\nNot entirely sure I would pick The Progress over SBP, as I like some of the flavors of the other restaurant better, but it's definitely a must-try at least once.", "author": "Tori S."}

While especially the simplest dishes showed off inventive style, there were many moments where family style didn't feel like the best medium.  I'm a compulsive sharer--at Gary Danko, the server brought us an extra plate because we were eating each other's dishes--but the added steps: assembling the 4 ingredient squab, selecting which lamb mix-ins we wanted, pouring the pork broth over the tumble of plain-looking \"treasures\" and especially having to divide each dish into 4 portions, felt like the next version of making guacamole tableside: a gimmick that sidelined dinner in favor of the show.\n\nAnd while some of the dishes were fantastic, some over-favored fermenting and many were stingingly salty.  The Chef's gifts were roasted mushrooms in crisp housemade furikake, tempura mussels with too much black pepper, jerky with peanuts that tasted a lot like kalbi, housemade ham on a cracker, radishes with butter, but the unexpected stand out was the oranges with curry oil--a weirdly rich, refreshing bite.\n\nLamb Tartare--I loved the black rice cracker, but the pickled kohlrabi overpowered the other mix-ins. After picking it out, I could better taste the fresh meat. Perhaps I could have asked our server to hold them, but if my fiance doesn't like fennel, and the other couple have their own preferences, and we're eating out of the same dish; well, you get the picture.\n\nRoti came out burning hot and crisp. Like the oranges, the uninspiring description belied a winning dish. I would have gladly eaten the whole serving smeared with the tart, homemade ricotta.\n\nTreasure Chest was the first salt bomb.  The pork broth was rich, but needed the surprisingly mild trout quenelles (think rubbery matzo ball) to tame its saltiness.  The mochi balls were gritty instead of chewy and smooth. The fermented sausage was new for me--strong sausage with a sour punch like sauerkraut--but it didn't necessarily go with the broth.\n\nThe Morels, recommended by one of our innumerable servers, were blindly salty. Couldn't enjoy the custardy egg yolks, or the tender mushrooms, it was all salt.\n\nPolpette was not my choice but I'm so glad we got it--the creamy smoked potatoes made the dish.\n\nSpiced Squab was served as a lettuce wrap and the dark meat was richer than I'd anticipated. The wings were dried out, tough instead of crispy, and overseasoned. The right amount of rub was better applied to the meatier breast.  \n\nWe opted for 6 courses + 2 desserts. I should have listened to fellow yelpers: the poppyseed cake was moist, but utterly boring with stewed strawberries. The lemongrass floating island was worth it--the sorbet and cream blending to be surprisingly light. \n\nThe 4 of us were seated at a booth on 3 sides of a table--the 4th side was too close to our neighbors for anyone to sit there, so the two of us at the heads of the table weren't within arms distance of the center of the table, making family style even more challenging.

(That's why they're the pros, huh?)\n\nThree of us, with six savory courses to decide on. (We decided to add on dessert afterward.) It was hard because literally everything sounded good. We started, however, with the house sampler platter - featuring smoked burrata, fried smelt, parmesan crackers with pork rillette, cured fish...all yummy.\n\nFor our courses:\n-Shaved cauliflower with pig fries: delicious all around. The veggies, the dressing/sauce and the crispy pig fries.\n-Porcini and mt. tam dumplings - yum! even from a mushroom hater. All the flavors were excellent and balanced.\n-Pecorino roti: hmmm....fried bread dough, cheese, truffle sauce? Everything about it was a winner.\n-Treasure chest: we didn't realize ahead of time that it was a soup, but the pureed fish quenelles, fermented sausage and broth were all really nice.\n-Aromatic spiced squab - what SBP does with quail, Progress does with squab...treat a small bird with care. Not fried like the state bird, but roasted and delicious and meaty and juicy. The feet on the legs were a little freaky...and a little cute. Weird, I know.\n-Polpette of rabbit and pork - wow - so good! We were getting full at this point but the juicy bites of meat, and the sauce and the potatoes. Incredible.\n\nDessert - we shared two: the beer-milk chocolate ice cream disc served on top of a sable cookie and some sort of fruit preserve. It had cocoa nibs and deep-fried pieces of farro on top for crunch!! Amazing. And the black sesame sponge cake with rhubarb. \n\nAll in all, an amazing meal and shout out to the chefs - both savory and pastry - for another home run.", "author": "David B."}

Came here on a Tuesday night with a party of 4 before heading to the SHN Orpheum to watch Hamilton so we were in a bit of a hurry. The dishes were all great until our 4th one, which was the fried rice. As we were finishing up my friend found a hair in the dish and it was most definitely not hers or anyone else's at the table. We were in a big hurry and no one wanted to \"cause a scene\" so we quickly paid and I quietly let the server know what happened. She immediately went to tell someone who looked like the manager what happened. We awkwardly waited but no one came over until we were about to get up someone came over to give us a shot of peanut butter milk. Although the shot was great there was no apology no acknowledgment of my friend finding a hair in the dish. Overall, I am very disappointed in the way The Progress handled the whole ordeal and will not be returning here ever again. We were not demanding even a free meal, but a simple apology would have sufficed. I am not one to ever want to cause trouble at a restaurant but I have had better service at chain restaurants when something like this happens than at The Progress.", "author": "Elsa S."}

Reservations recommended, otherwise you'll be sitting at the bar with a limited menu. $65 per person, with each additional dish $10. \n\nI started the meal with the El Diablo... never tried pear tequila but it was tasty! The drink was made well and it really stood out since it was so red. Free amuse bouche which consisted of a chinese sausage (lap cheung), tempura battered broccoli, nori cracker, and pickled radish. Tasty little snack and the presentation was nice, definitely got me excited for the meal! Next up was the dried duck with smoked prunes and the pig fries. I'm not sure if it's because these two came together, but the dried duck didn't really stand out to me. It was lacking something in flavor, which made it an easily forgotten dish. The pig fries (pig ears) were AMAZING. I think I should have just ordered another one of those dishes. Everything on that dish complimented each other so well, and there was just enough acid to lighten the dish up. Each bite had a nice crunch and it was just on point in everything. Again, I'm not sure if the duck was just MEH, or because it went up against the pig fries and lost a horrible fight. But winner here, goes to the pig fries! The next dish was the lamb scallopini, which was pretty good. I'm not sure if the lamb was done two ways (since there were two different colored meats) or if one was lamb or whatever... but both were pretty good. One of the meats was too peppery which kind of masked the natural lamb flavor (some people hate that, I guess) but I felt like it was over seasoned. Then the spiced squab came and... presentation wise... I was like WOAH. I say that because the claw was just hanging there. The squab was seasoned nicely, moist, and it had a nice crisp all over. Was definitely my second favorite dish of the night I think. The next dish was the smoked black cod fried rice with squid and preserved lemons. The cod pieces were fried which was tasty. Overall, the dish was good, but some bites were a bit salty compared to other bites. I'm not sure how that happened since we gave it a good mix... but that was definitely one of my complaints. My friend that I was eating with couldn't eat the dish since it was too salty for him (it was okay for me since he probably got the saltier parts... lol). We then added the treasure chest since so many people around us was ordering it which consisted of fermented sausage, fish quenelles, tofu, pumpkin rice dumpling in pork broth. The broth was rich and nicely flavored. The fermented sausage was a bit too strong for me... I felt like I was forcing myself to eat it since I don't like wasting food... but it was definitely pretty sour/salty or however you want to describe it... eating it with the tofu kind of toned the flavor down a bit. Then came down to the dessert and I'm not much of a dessert person, so I won't write much about it. We got both the desserts that they were offering that night, but I preferred the guava sherbert one over the honey cocoa ice cream and the crepe. One of the reasons was that the chocolate one had too much going on and all the flavors were overpowering each other, whereas with the sherbert, everything complimented each other pretty well. \n\nDecor inside is nice and I think they're still making changes (at the time I went). Service is great and the staff is extremely friendly. Some of the dishes were a little off, but I'm sure with time, they can only improve. Definitely recommend coming to this place if you're in the area. I've never been to State Bird (which is right next door), but I'm excited to try if it's similar to here!", "author": "Johnson S."}

What I can say is that the atmosphere and decor are really welcoming--although there is a decent amount of noise, it wasn't overwhelming, and the rusticness (rusticity?) lent a casual air that was emphasized by the servers. Their team approach works well--obviously I don't really know how the individual servers are as people but they come across as very down to earth and attentive without being overwhelming in any way. The food: most striking is the flavorfulness of pretty much all of the dishes we had.  The combination of ingredients, while complex like a lot of other restaurants, somehow felt more harmonized. Standouts for us were the burrata and the octopus/lamb shank but every dish was worth eating.

What were the odds the food would be any less good or the service any less friendly?  Apparently very very low. What was I expecting though? I was expecting a more handcuffed version of State Bird.  In some ways it was but instead of police cuffs it was more like those soft kinky ones that you can easily remove if needed.  \n\nRight out of the gate I recognized some of the faces from next door working the Progress.  Just like next door we were warmly greeted and found out we were late for our reservation.  I basically got the time wrong.  No matter they readjusted quickly and before our drinks at the bar were finished we were getting seated.  Did I not mention there is a full bar here?  Bonus!  \n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful right down to the restrooms.  If I had a complaint it would be nice if they labeled them.  I figured it out but I could see confusion on someone else's face without signage.  There is loft seating on one side and a private large party table in the balcony on the other side. ( I hope to sit there one day )\n\nThe food is magnificent in typical Nicole and Stuart style.  Delicious, unique, and perfectly plated.  Since the format is family/sharing style there's less hustle and bustle around the restaurant aside from the kitchen.  Much like next door you can peer into the kitchen except here you'll feel less in the way.  \n\nWe made it a point to try the cocktails as that's a major change from their sister restaurant.  The cocktails were solid and worked will with the meal.  The house Martini however is probably the best one I've ever had. The smoked olive and smoked juice blended well with the martini and made for a really great version of a classic.  \n\nThe price was 65 dollars per person with the choice of 6 dishes. Which is very reasonable these days in my opinion.  If you want more of a certain dish they can whip it up at an extra cost.    They walk you through the menu and make great suggestions.  Without going through all the dishes I will say if you're a pork fan and the pig fries are on the menu that night. GET THEM. One of the best dishes I've ever had.  Even my friends who hadn't experienced those parts of the pig in that dish were floored.  \n\nBottom line Nicole and Stuart have struck again.

Three of us went for a walk-in at State Bird next door, but they were full for the night.  I had read an article about the delicious cocktails at Progress and the seasonal food, so we decided to give it a try.  My Sunny Jim cocktail came and it was just meh, so that was my first cautionary indicator of what was to come.  We got snacks for the table, which came standard with the meal.  The best of them were these thumbnail-sized biscuits, which ended up being the HIGHLIGHT of the whole meal!  I asked for more and thought that they would provide them as a courtesy, but the waiter said he would charge me $6.  Wellllll, OK, but 2 more measly pieces came to the table.  Like that's it?!?  Now I know this place is straight-up robbing me.  \n\nWe ordered uni guac, which was not bad.  For.the 4 family-style entrees, we chose red snapper, fried rice, rabbit, and beef.  The snapper came out first, accompanied by the rice.  My brother complained - 2 tiny finger-sized miniscule pieces for 3 people?!?  This is a bad joke.  The waiter apologized for miscommunicating to the chef, so we thought another portion of fish would come, but they decided to give us a plate of roti instead.  The rabbit and beef that came after were resoundingly unmemorable.  I refused dessert, since there was no point in continuing to be disappointed.  When we walked out, the hostess and the manager asked me how my meal was.  I made the mistake of saying it was OK.  For close to $300 total though, I should have been honest and said it was one of the worst meals I have ever had and those prices ($58 per person) were insane for the poor quality.

I could see any of the dishes I had at either restaurant fluidly transfer to the other restaurant's menu without anybody noticing a variance in chef de cuisine. from the food description, presentation and taste, it's all very similar. actually, I couldn't tell and don't know if they've got two chef de cuisine but I would assume so. even the restaurant concept is pretty much the same, encouraging family style eating. the only difference is the way in which you choose your food. at state bird you choose from a dimsum-like cart and at the progress you choose a six course menu from a list of dishes. \n\nnotable dishes were the farro spezzato (like a rich hearty ragu served with crisped farro and creamy cut farro), the shaved cauliflower with pig fries (which translates to pig ears), and the roti with pecorino and sun choke pur\u00e9e (a nice cross between Asian and Italian). these dishes were excellent and excited me. the rest of the menu, while good overall, wasn't anything to rave about (much like state bird). the desserts didn't sound as appealing so we stuck with savory for the night. \n\nnow onto service...after we sat down we waited for approximately 15 minutes with no approach towards the table (not even water was poured). at this point i wondered whether we were forgotten or not assigned to a specific server considering two tables In the same area that were sat after us were already getting their cocktails. we asked if we were going to have someone greet our table, which finally got the ball rolling. the person whom we asked got us water and took our cocktail order and a few minutes following our actual server approached with a quick apology excusing himself for the few tables he was just slammed with. As a server in my life's earlier years, I understand this and how overwhelming it can be when you get three tables at once on top of your already existing three tables. from then on service was great and I have no complaints.", "author": "Regina C."}

So over the top hipster/judgmental that they overpowered the food and atmosphere. At one point they brought a dish out and someone asked a question about it. Without saying a word the server took the dish off the table, turned, and walked away. The very same dish was brought back by a different server minutes later. No explanation. Unreal! And that was just one of many unpleasant surprises. Slow. Inattentive. Defensive. Taking themselves wayyyyyy to seriously in all the wrong ways. So many great places in SF with great service AND great food. I would not bother with this restaurant at all. I will never go here again and would strongly recommend steering yourself to one of many alternates: Delfina, Zuni, Cala, Al's Place, Slanted Door, La Ciccia, Manufactory, etc. Great food and great service ARE mutually exclusive here.

Amuse-bouche was nice. We ordered the roti / dumpling appetizer. I've had roti (Indian) and roti-prantha (malaysian / asian), this was bland with a cheesy sauce. Weird..... the dumplings were forgettable too. For mains we got the lamb (was like mini hard sausages), treasure chest (probably the best part of the meal, the broth was yum), and tofu / dungeness crab (casually plated).\n\nWine: we took our own special bottle, $30 corkage.\n\nDessert: we tried both. The ice cream (honey cacao?) was yum, but others again not memorable.\n\nDress: Casual, maybe even wear your shorts. No seriously!\n\nAmbience: loud music, which became mellow middle of meal, then loud again.....\n\nIn a nutshell - if yo you want to spend $200+ on a meal for two, with corkage and tip, then be my guest.

Prices are reasonable at $65 for five courses (easily sharable).

Of the 5 we picked, get these, pickled sausages in pork broth, roti, lamb tartare. For dessert..... The amazing floating ice cream thing. That ish just melts like a mix of cotton candy and warm marshmallows. The rum cake was good if you're into that, I wasn't so much.

I had loved State Bird Provisions and was so looking forward to this based on reviews. I went there just last night and I'm having difficulty remembering what was ordered - which is not a good sign. What does come to mind is a plate of mush consisting of fishy salmon tataki blanketing soft polenta- not a pleasant texture together. The avocado wedge was nice as was the tomato and plums but I would have just as easily gone to the farmer's market and made I salad myself for dinner.\n\nOn top of that, the sommelier who was serving us that evening was incredibly rude and unprofessional. We enjoyed our first bottle of wine and ordered another of the same bottle. One of the staff had put a tasting glass down for us to try the second bottle, which she ignored and proceeded to pour the second bottle into each of our glasses that still had the previous bottle's wine. The only thing she did to check the wine was to smell the cork, which is a personal choice, but it does not give you a definitive yes or no that the bottle is good. \n\nShe came back with another bottle and allowed us to taste this time and it was much better, but she made a point to tell us before pouring that she tested the other bottle and that there was nothing wrong with it so after this they could serve us wine by the glass. So we just sat in silence vs argue with her because the previous bottle was not good. Period. All three of us tasted something wrong. Not the kind of treatment I'd expect when we're paying upwards of $100 per person.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the frozen yogurt we got at loving cup on the way home.", "author": "Heather C."}

We enjoyed the fun of selecting six dishes to share family style, although I do find it a bit strange that not every ingredient is listed on each dish, especially for allergy purposes.  I realize the staff is very good about asking, but it was strange not to know what all the garnishes were and whether we should avoid any on that basis.\n\nThe \"banchan\" to start were fun, but nothing out of this world.  The dishes were interesting and had very novel combinations: kiwi and ricotta, mackerel tartare, etc.  I have to say that I didn't love any one dish.  They were all pretty good, but I feel like they lacked depth of flavor.  The \"treasure chest\" was fun, but the best part was really the broth more than anything.  For the dungeness crab and tofu dish, there was hardly any crab and the tofu was just bad.  It was way too dense and felt like cooked cubes of cheese.

Definitely a much better experience than when we went to State Bird Provisions - mainly because we were able to get a reservation for tonight and not wait in line for 3 hours.  :)  We were seated upstairs, which seemed weird since there were still some open tables downstairs, but still okay.  The atmosphere and setup of the restaurant was good.  The inside is pretty deep and ultimately leads to the kitchen, and there are two upstairs areas.  I'm assuming most of you know how the ordering at this restaurant works, so I'll skip that.  This is what we ordered and what we thought of them:\n\n-Sampler platter:  they bring this out as a 'snack.'  There was a fried mussel, malaysian jerky, grapefruit with olive oil and pepper, mache lettuce with dill dip, a parmesan cracker, and pan-fried snap peas.  Overall, pretty good, but the grapefruit just tasted like grapefruit - not a very necessary part of the plate.  \n\n-Shaved cauliflower-herbs & pig fries.  This was probably one of the best dishes we had.  It comes with fried pig ear, fried jowl (maybe?), shaved raw cauliflower, and mint.  SO GOOD - definitely get this.\n\n-Raw Japanese red snapper with turnips & creme fraiche.  This dish comes with squid ink crackers on the side for you to load up with the fish.  It was seasoned very well, and very appetizing, since the turnips were pickled and added good acidity.\n\n-'Treasure chest.'  My family thought this was quite a weird dish, but my husband and I enjoyed it very much.  Everything on its own is sort of random, but together, this dish definitely worked.  If you are faint of heart, you shouldn't get this dish - the fermented sausage is pretty strong-tasting, and imagine pairing that with kimchi.  Overall, I liked this dish a lot.  The broth definitely made it.\n\n-Squab.  Super, super tender, to the point of almost raw, but so tasty.  The salted chili paste on the side was great.\n\n-Five Dot Ranch beef.  This would be the one dish I would not recommend.  The meat was overcooked, and the miso oyster sauce on top didn't add much.  I think this was generally underseasoned, and not very good.  \n\n-Lamb merguez.  This was also a dish with very random stuff put together, but again, we really liked it.  The fried squid and the octopus were delicious.  The lamb sausage is definitely pretty gamey tasting - my husband described it as a 'high quality slim jim.'  \n\nWe ordered the elderflower floating island dessert, and the milk chocolate black lager ice cream.  Both were very good and we thoroughly enjoyed them.  The elderflower floating island was subtle but had a good perfumey flavor to it.  The ice cream was great without being overly sweet.\n\nAll in all, we really enjoyed our dinner at The Progress.  Our waiter was also pretty awesome too.

We've wanted to go back, but I'm not much for booking two months in advance or camping out in a long line.  So I was excited to give The Progress a try while it's still fairly easy to get in. \n\nMy husband and I showed up right at 5 pm - no reservations - and got seats at the bar. The kitchen doesn't open until 5:30, so we started with cocktails (The Concession and the Manhattan). The place filled up quickly. Our bartender gave excellent food recommendations. We decided on three dishes to share. \n\nThe first to arrive was the lamb tartare with an array of condiments; a perfect start. Then we had a little hiccup: our second dish took forever to arrive. It was the popular pig fries - I saw people all around us getting theirs. Our bartender was very busy and yet she knew we'd been waiting a long time; she called and even walked back to the kitchen on our behalf. When the fries finally came, she apologized for the wait and took the fries off the bill. Mistakes happen; I appreciate how we were treated. And man, those fries were tasty!\n\nFinally, we got the treasure chest. My husband loved the sausage and I loved the broth. I think the dishes we chose complimented each other very well.

Service was phenomenal and the whole dining experience was absolutely the best I've had in a long time. \n\nThe amount of food, I felt was not at a bad price point. $65/person for 6 plates. Although, our reservations were at 9:45p, so we did have a bit of food before then. We will come back again closer to a regular dinner hour to confirm this.\n\nWOULD ORDER AGAIN:\n\nPork Fries - Basically bacon fries w/ fried pork ears. Tossed with a tasty acidic cauliflower salad. I need more salad though, to cut the fat.\n\nApple Sorbet w/ Black Pepper Floating Islands - Delicious way to end the dinner! Glad Jerald was kind enough to let us try this one and the Choco Honey Sorbet.\n\nThe Treasure Chest - Sausages and kimchee in a broth. Most memorable for me was this pumpkin mochi they put on top. Highlight of my night! I wish they had a plate of the pumpkin mochi alone!\n\nSunny Jim - Tasted like sunshine in a cup! Felt like I was on vacation!\n\nDON'T MIND SKIPPING NEXT TIME:\n\nDumplings w/ Salsa Verde - The salsa verde was phenomenal. But the dumpling was a bit doughy. I would have preferred it more with a thinner skin or a crispier sear on the dumpling. The cheese inside the dumpling also made it more fattening.\n\nRoti w/ Truffle Cream Sauce - This sounded delicious on the menu, but right as it arrives, you just get a whiff of the cheese. So it's kinda stinky. The roti itself didn't have a lot of flavor, which was expected. But the cream sauce was underwhelming as well. The sauce could have used a bit of salt. \n\nSPECIAL NOTES:\nWe started with a free snack plate, which was great. I love free. My absolute favorite item on the snack plate was this piece of radish with some sort of sauce on it. I was too excited to listen to the server tell me what it was. LOL. Something super simple, yet, blew my mind. Thanks Progress!", "author": "L M."}

Just like State Bird, family style dishes are fun in a big group. It was easy to work with the reservation person on finding a time - ended up going back and forth with them several times to get options, etc. so that being easy was really nice.\n\nCons: We did the 10 person mezzanine table - waiter was kind of rude, the meal was only 8 course pri fixe and it draaaaged. There is no reason 8 courses should take 3 full hours. I didn't even spend that much time at French Laundry and that was like 14+ courses. So our group was sitting there a good majority of the time waiting for the next course/getting antsy and tired because we had the 830 reservation time. \n\nOverall: Liked State Bird a little more only because the meal moved faster and the waitress we had was really fun - food-wise they were both good but the experience was pretty different between the 2 for the other points I mentioned.", "author": "Brittney E."}

The flavors definitely lived up to the hype. \n\nWe wanted to try everything on the menu but settled on the dried duck which was interesting but with unique flavors.

The sunchoke, rosemary & smoked cured egg 'roti' was simply exquisite - hot and flaky and accompanied by great sauce. The \nspiced garlic squab had just the right amount of spice and we used to roti to make our cups instead of the lettuce. The \nsmoked black cod fried rice with squid & chrysanthemum had a strong Asian and seafood flavor.

We ordered the hamachi salad (absolutely delicious), the marrow dumplings (good but under seasoned), the Ling cod (the carrot was on point but there wasn't any depth of flavor otherwise here, too much smoked paprika, and drastically lacking salt), and the dry aged beef (good but needed something else). We also had some oysters (fine), a mont blanc desert (interesting pastry texture, overly sweet), and cocktails. The manhattan was by far the best thing we had.

Through some computer sorcery I got a booking for Saturday night.\n\nWalking in, you walk through a crowded bar area to be seated in a downstairs area or one of two alcoves upstairs. \n\nThe decor is a basic one, with unfinished, industrial areas scattered ( or it could be they just haven't finished decorating...)\n\nService was fine but timing of food delivery was, frankly, slow. It gave us time to digest but it shouldn't cause us to want to dream about past meals because we can't remember how long our last course was there. Not really acceptable in a place where the menu is really limited in it's delivery to communal dishes.\n\nTried 3 of the wines by the glass; the Riesling, the Muscadet and the Nero D'avolo. All ok, but not the best examples for the price. Was not impressed with the Syrah as it was horribly young with green tannins. Happily they replaced it easily.\n\nThe full bottles looked more interesting, but as I was the only drinker I could only look at them enviously.\n\nThough I saw a previous review offering an a la carte menu we were only offered a set one at $65 for 6 shared courses. Sweet idea but frankly it's bollocks.  Make the portions bigger. They said the portions would be sharing size.....\n\nNot really, I'm afraid. The portions were more anti obesity than anti hunger. \n\nThe food. Yes. The main reason for coming. First, a mixed amuse bouche of some pickled ( and not) radishes, some Chinese spiced sausages and other tempurad objects. It started exceptionally well with the meals show stopper; the crab. Tasty, well spiced with a touch of chili, this is the dish I would come back for.  And the cauliflower/pig fries was interesting and tasty. Lamb scallopini was good but not grand. \n\nBut...the squab was just horrible. Yes it's a gamey bird but there's a fine line to being undercooked. And the presentation was more backstreet Chinatown than Fillmore. Beef was okay, not amazing, the duck was just forgotten by the waiters....\n\nDessert was reminiscent of a Polish compote; nice in an old country sort of way.\n\nMaybe it's expecting too much after state bird and maybe is unfair to review so soon after opening but there was no opening week discount and $300+ later I felt a little short-changed.", "author": "Pantera W."}

Just this large industrial metal door.\n\nWe were  greeted by the staff and taken to our table. Our main waitress introduced herself and gave us a short and sweet explanation of how the menu works. Which was great for me because I was a little overwhelmed.\n\nLooking through the amazing dishes, Christina and I were hard pressed to make a decision. In the end we chose 5 dishes and two desserts for $65/person.\n\nAfter taking our order, another staff member brought us a beautiful snack tray with 6 different samples. All were unique and thoughtful and make you want more.\n\nI'll describe the dishes in the order they came.\n\nFirst up, the 'Spiced lamb tartare with various 'mix-in' condiments'. The condiments included sprouts, green onion, a nut of some sort, peppers, and more. They served it with a crunchy and salty blue sesame chip.\n\nSecond we had the smoked duck with pioppini mushrooms and dried plum. The duck left a magnificent smokey/sweet flavor in your mouth that was so tasty.\n\nAround the same time she delivered our shaved cauliflower and pig fries. This provided a crispy and salty compliment to the smokey/sweet duck.\n\nAfter our appetizer plates, we had two more coming.\n\nAnother waiter brought us our Treasure chest soup and described the ingredients. He was pretty humble when he described the dish, but he didn't need to be because it was a treasure. The pumpkin-rice dumpling was just sweet enough to mix well with the pork broth. The sausages were complex and a little overpowering at times, but unique. \n\nLast we had guinea hen and pork polpette. This dish was good, but unfortunately it just couldn't compare to the four previous plates.\n\nQuite full, we still had dessert. I had the milk chocolate-black lager ice cream with cocoa sable and caraway seed. It was sweet, chocolaty, crunchy, and just the right size.\n\nThe inside of The Progress is a wonderful view filled with crafted wooden tables and chairs.

I really did not feel my server was into our table but it was busy.  the concept requires you to have a tasting menu of sorts for $58.  We don't drink alcohol so felt like our server was bummed on not getting that sale.  He forgot our caviar after we verbally told him that's what we wanted and then he said write it on the menu.\nThe food was really very simple yet creative.  We got the lamb tartar that had an assortment of items like lemon zest and mung beans.  very clean on the palate.  We also had the duck dumplings in the duck broth very good.  The outstanding dish of the night was the octopus.  It was perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicious.  We also had the rabbit.  We thought the plating was random and it had a mashed turnip that was weird.  Our rabbit was a little over cooked.  the sauce, perhaps a demi glace of some kind was really good.\nThe desserts were odd.  I had the pistachio cake and my date had the yogurt and rhubarb sorbet.  Funky flavors.  Not really yummy.  I aslo ordered tea which was $8! For tea! Like water and flowers/herbs $8! Um..I would rethink that one.  \nYou can really see that the staff cares for the most part.  Every person touched the table.  I thought are server was average.  I also think you should be allowed to order more items. \nThey were very busy so maybe the don't need any pointers.", "author": "Angie S."}

From the minute we walked in the door we were greeted with a huge smile, sat right away (15 minutes late to our resi), our server was spot on, the beer (IPA) was great, as was all the food and wine.  The vibe and atmosphere is top notch (busy at 6pm) and when we left the bar was packed.  The recipe for success and knocking it out of the park runs deep for these folks at The Progress and State Bird, so take it upon yourselves to make a visit.  Plan on $300 for 2 people.  Cocktail, dinner ($65/head), dessert (we went extra $10), wine ($80 bottle), and tip.  Parking was easy (i think we got lucky), but if not Kabuki is right there.  We did get lucky enough to see a homeless person pissing on the sidewalk when we left, but sadly, that's the new norm for San Francisco.", "author": "Alexander C."}

And to snag one of the large tables on the mezzanine with set menu?!?! Score!! Sadly I was terribly disappointed and exhausted at the end of the meal. \n\nIt was the 8:30 seating so I was already hangry. And we were seated late and it took them awhile to get things going with drink orders and \"snacks.\" Once we had a few small tastes, I felt better. And they were pretty tasty - especially the fried mussels and the potato croquettes. But then the rest of the meal was disappointing and slow. \n\nThe concepts were exciting on paper but poorly executed. Something was not quite right about each course. I didn't even finish most of them. At one point, I even thought - \"Well, I needed to go on a diet, anyway!\"\n\nEach course took about 30 minutes. After 4 courses, my friends and I joked that we were never going to leave. Luckily, they served the last 3 savory courses at the same time so we thought - we might make it out before midnight!! But then it was 45 minutes plus before the desserts were served. Several of us were so tired and the food was so mediocre that we just wanted to leave and go to bed. Which is just so sad because delicious food is worth the wait. Just not this time. And for what we paid? Definitely not. You get more bang for your buck at SBP. \n\nMy advice: Skip The Progress and stick to State Bird.", "author": "Pei L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-05", "description": "Over the past year the restaurant reviewer and one of the commentators of the New York Times have complained that it can be a royal pain to get a meal at many restaurants.  The chef may offer only a fixed menu with no changes permitted; or may not offer a menu at all; alternatively you may be given a poem that offers little clue to what is to come.  And a meal can take hours.\n\nThe Progress has put the fun back into fine dining.  The restaurant is beautiful.  The servers are friendly.  You get a menu and can choose six of whatever the hell you want.  It's kind of a marriage of Gary Danko with the old Yun Luck Rice Shoppe in New York City.  \n\nThe restaurant has great music, mood, and energy.  And the food is very good at worst and inspired at best.  One more thing, Stuart Brioza and his wife know what it means to be a host/chef/owner.  They were all over the place cooking, greeting, serving, and bussing.  They exude hospitality.  \n\nA beautiful amuse was presented to each table that said welcome in a most tasty way.\n\nI then started my meal with smoked black cod fried rice with fried squid.  The squid was great.  The rice only OK as I was unable to taste the cod.  This was the weakest plate of my meal.\n\nGrilled shrimp with daikon, yuzu and olive oil was light and a nice introduction to what was to follow (in my estimation the food got better as the meal progressed).\n\nWild mushrooms came with pickled nori and brussels sprouts leaves.  The mushrooms had that earthy taste that I so love; the brussels sprouts leaves were a nice accent.  I did feel that there was a bit too much acid on the plate but others would likely disagree.\n\nTreasure chest of fermented sausage, fish quenelles, tofu, and a pumpkin rice dumpling in a pork broth was a highpoint of the meal and a great palate cleanser.  I suspect that this, in various guises, will become a signature of the restaurant.\n\nTwo meat courses came next and each was wonderful.  First, Don Watson's lamb scallopini with fava beans and cippolini tasted the way lamb should (the Don Watson name gives you a hint of that before this plate arrives).    Next, BN ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce had that mineral taste that you rarely experience these days in meat.  \n\nOverall a great but expensive meal.  With a cocktail, tax, and tip I dropped $100 on my meal.  But it was worth it.  One does wonder whether the pricing will limit the popularity of The Progress. \n\nI left wondering whether they might offer a less expensive three or four course alternative to the full 6 course meal.  In any event, The Progress points the way towards dining the way many of us wish it to be.", "author": "David D."}

We had made a reservation through open table, and as a party of 2, we were seated upstairs. It was a tad chilly (so bring a longer sleeve layer), but the night was also very young (we had a 5:45pm rez before an 8pm show). We had a rotation of servers, but each one had his or her own delightful personality. All of the servers knew the details of the plates they served, and then dipped out without too much of an interruption in our date night. \n\nAnother thing. At first, we weren't sure that 6 plates to share would be enough (we were pretty hungry), so we ordered a 7th plate for the additional $10. We should've stopped at 6! But tasting each of the dishes we selected was such a treat. We had the dried duck with smoked prune romesco, creamy pork broth with the kimchi rice balls (yummy), pickled nori and brussel sprouts (probably my fave of the night!), smoked black cod fried rice, puntarelle & escarolle with the soft egg (also delish), and the grilled beef with the mustard-miso oyster sauce.\n\nThe server reordered our selections to fit the tastes and layers for the evening and he did a fabulous job. Our meals went from light to heavy but without any sacrifice in flavor from the dish before it. \n\nAnd a shout out to the bartender(s)! I am perhaps one of the pickiest mixed drink persons I know - so much so that I often just stick with beer. But the pear margarita was delightful and refreshing. I finished it by the end of the salad courses, and would have switched to wine or beer for the heavier dishes, but I didn't want to spoil any room for the delightful food that was yet to come!", "author": "Seth P."}

After two or three courses, though, I picked up in a strong trend: all of the dishes were VERY salty.\n\nI've got a salty palate, so usually this doesn't bother me... but I really felt like I was being smacked over the head with salt by the fifth course. Given the restaurant's pedigree and price point, I think I was hoping for more subtly in the flavors.

SF style should work*. We were super excited to try State Birds new sister restaurant, but the excitement died down after we dined there. The concept is more family style, where one can order 5 dishes to be shared and each order a dessert of their own.The most underwhelming dish was the Pecorino Truffle Roti. The dumplings at Statebird are so much better. They can learn a thing or two from there after all State Bird is their role model. The tofu - dungeness crab was okay as the tofu was super hard and the whole dish was not flavorful at all. The only one star goes to the Treasure chest dish where the broth seemed similar to what we've had at SB and another star for being State Birds's sister. They do have the potential especially since they are from the same folks as SB, but need to make changes to their menu if they want to succeed. \n\nThey just got nominated for the James Beard..

We had 5 carnivores, a vegan, and two people with allergies. It would have been impossible to pick 4 that would have made us all happy. Our waiter worked with us and brought substitutes for the folks with the restrictions and it worked perfectly. We all loved our food.  We got the caviar pillow, oysters, pork loin, octopus, halibut ceviche, and bone marrow beef dumplings.  The vegan in our group got her own modified selections. The portions were well sized, the cocktails were delicious, and the food was sublime. If you haven't been here, you must try it.", "author": "JJ B."}

They provide some complimentary snacks for you like beef jerkey and vegetable and a corn fritter that was amazing! Our server explained that you choose 6 items, it could be all sweet or savory, and there are many options to choose from. We choose to get 6 savory and add on for $10 a dessert to share.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-16", "description": "We were a party of eight so we had to go with the $65 pre-fixe menu.  We were seated upstairs in the small loft area, which fit two other parties of four and a party of two.  I enjoyed this because it's much more quiet and intimate.  Downstairs was pretty busy & loud.  The only problem with being upstairs is just having to go downstairs and through the entire main floor to use the restrooms.  Restrooms were very nice because they are three large private washrooms with jet hand dryers and music playing for your listening entertainment.  They wrap extra toilet paper individually with different color tissue paper placed in a basket for easy access, which was a nice touch. Everyone in our party noticed and brought it up at the dinner table (we're such great conversationalists).  \n\nOverall, none of the food from the pre-fixe really impressed me and I feel like I'm easily impressed when it comes to food.  Maybe it's due to the pre-fixe menu because now looking over the current regular \"choose your own adventure\" menu and what other people ate on yelp, the dishes sound amazing and much more adventurous!  I am not saying the food we got was bad in any way, but the flavors were nothing out of the ordinary.  One dish just tasted like ketchup (can't think of a more elegant term).  I was mostly disappointed with the choice of proteins for the mains: chicken and steak.  It just seemed so basic and kind of boring, but again, it was a pre-fixe.  Perhaps the stars of the show may have been the dessert because they looked amazing, but unfortunately I was feeling too sick to have any.  Having been to State Bird Provisions already, I was left thinking, \"wait, why did they open another restaurant and what's so special about this one?\"  \n\nAs far as service & attention, it was good - nothing to complain about.  Water was always filled.  They accommodated our gluten-free friend. And the dishes were served on beautiful ceramic dishes.\n\nInitially, I thought I wouldn't want to go back to the restaurant, but after writing this review, think I may need to give them another shot and try their regular menu.  But since it is so hard to get reservations,...I'll just wait for another restaurant to open up.", "author": "D W."}

I had one of the more memorable meals of my life at their sister restaurant, State Bird Provisions. However, I ended the evening with a sour taste in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, the food was fine and the service was decent. Just not when paying $65/pp for a family-style menu that allowed 2-4 bites of each course. I am willing to pay for an excellent meal, but at the Progress, it felt like robbery.  \n\nFor our a table of five people, we had to agree on 6 menu items that we would share family-style. When each of the courses arrived, we were each able to try a very small portion. So, that's $65 for a few bites each of 6 items. At State Bird, many of the dishes were stand-outs, with bold, memorable flavors. At The Progress, the only dish that I will remember is the Pig Fries. \n\nWe also enjoyed some delicious (and very expensive) cocktails and wine. When all was said and done we paid $800. \n\nI'd go back to State Bird Provisions in a heart-beat, but unless they change the menu format at The Progress I will stay away.", "author": "CL S."}

I know. \nBut I remember passing on State Bird Provisions a year or so back (ya know pre-Beard award and reservation system hack) after looking at the potential difficulty getting a reservation. Now it's essentially impossible unless you spend an hour or two waiting in line outside. So, when I happened to find a dining for 1 table on short notice I jumped. \n\nOverall, good. Not great, but good. Ups and downs. Lefts and rights. The food ranged from interesting to boring. Details below, but highlights were the treasure chest and rustico were amazing. Must trys and they made up for the misses (see lamb).\n\nYes, the place just opened and are probably working things out, but the biggest problem here is going to be how they manage the table to kitchen interface. You order for the table and they bring food to share based on the number at your table. Love the idea. Yet, then how was dining for one such a problem for the staff? It's like it blew their minds. Essentially my dishes came out sporadically. So I waited 30 minutes then received three dishes at once. The last was cold by the time I got to it. Then waited another 30 for my next course. You get the idea. \n\nThe courses are diverse and since they didn't come in a predictable order any attempt pairing individual wines here would be difficult (sometimes I split half for whites and half for reds. Don't even try here. Pick something that will go with everything off their ridiculous wine list). The staff didn't seem overwhelmingly educated on the menu (which is odd at this price...overheard things like \"oh so you had the farro\" \"No, that was the crab\" \"Oh, i haven't had that dish yet\"....Seriously?)\n\nThe rundown:\nSnacks: Didn't exactly wow me. Seriously tempura broccoli? Nothing wrong here, just not a strong first step.\nSpanish mackerel tartar with horseradish creme fraiche: it was fresh and nice. again not amazing but the mackerel was very good. The squid ink chips were a nice surprise addition that added a nice bitter/saltiness to round out the dish. B+ \nPorcini and mt tam dumpling: this actually came last of the first set of dishes and didn't get to it until it had cooled, but it was tasty and had a nice smokey undertow to it. B-\nFarro Spezzato 'rustico' with octopus and pork jowl: awesome. great depth with bit of cumin (?). Super tasty. Elegent, yet rustic. Really it's a ragu with octopus and piggy. Delish. A\n'Treasure Chest' of fermented sausage, trough quenelles and pumpkin rice dumpling in a 'creamy' pork broth: again awesome. not listed here is that there is also kim chi in which pulls out the sour notes in the sausages (also fermented). It contrasts greatly with rich broth. The pumpkin dumpling was also super flavorful. Superb. A\nDon Watson's lamb scallopini with fava greens and cippolini: This was a flat out fail. The lamb was cut thin and so encrusted with sesame cooked to the point of flavorlessness.  It didn't work with the greens either. F (no joke) \nGuava on buttermilk sherbet with black pepper floating meringue: The buttermilk sherbet was nice and the guava went well. Same for the meringue. Yet they didn't really go. It was like two deserts in one. It was two parts of separate deserts. Not perfect, but both parts tasty for a subtle finish, which I actually appreciated a lot. For food porn, I hate getting to the second to last dish and just being done with rich food only to have eat an over the top desert. I'd rather they go this route. B \n\nCurrently $65 for 6 courses (10 more per course per person I think...) so I'd give it a B though I'm perhaps be a bit generous.\nAgain. Wine list: amazing.", "author": "Zack S."}

The Progress is connected to another restaurant, by the same owners, called Freebirds. At Freebirds, they do it dim sum style, where it is personal size. At The Progress, they do it family style so each person gets to choose 2 items on the menu, and the chef makes it to order by how many people there are in the party. I like this style, because you are able to have a taste of everything instead of having to eat the same meal and not get to taste others. Since there were only three of us, we ordered 6 things. \n\nMy thoughts on The Progress, was that I loved that they had an open kitchen and that they did it family style, however my disappointments were the loudness, and that there is no signage above or on their restaurant.  \n\nThe \"super fresh ricotta with 'august glo' nectarines & rosemary almonds\" I liked this a lot. The nectarines were perfectly ripe and it went very good with the ricotta, almost like a parfait. the \"sliced heirloom tomatoes with sweet corn-mt. tam croquettes\". The croquettes were very smooth, and the corn added a very nice crunch with the tomatoes. The \"potato-sauerkraut dumpling with 'damson' plum preserves\" I will tell you this right now, I absolutely hate sauerkraut, and I was thinking, okay this is the one I'm going to hate the most! I could not taste the sauerkraut what so ever in the dumpling, it tasted like a creamy potatoes with the nice plum sauce. The \"spiced Sonoma coast ling cod, blistered romanos & jimmy nardello verjus\". I have no idea what verjus are. After looking it up I found out that it is a pressed juice of unripened grapes. I liked how the green beans were cooked and had that nice crush as well as the champagne grapes, however there was just a little but too much dill for me on the cod. The last savory dish we had was the \"BN (Niman Ranch) beef with dill pickle-chaterelle butter\". This sadly was my least favorite, because I am not a fan of beef in general and this was just too rare for me that I had to cut it up in small small pieces to chew it. \n\nWe got to have all 3 desserts! \n\nCheck out my profile to find my official blogs as well as more food reviews", "author": "Food G."}

The thoughts in my head while I was sampling the food ranged from: I've seen this before, it tastes as a blander version of a dish I've had at AL's place to...I feel awkward fighting over the small servings on a shared plate, maybe not enough stuff is in season, I could have surely used more sauce or more seasoning, or more something.

Overall I was left feeling short changed. The entrees were interesting and most were tasty, but the portions were on the small side and some of the dishes could have used more flavor. My main disappointment is they claim to serve family style meals, however the portions are small tapas style. While I didn't expect the portions to be huge, I did expect them to be slightly more substantial.  After a tab of $155 with tip for 2 people I shouldn't be hungry, but 2 hours after a four course meal with appetizers that was exactly the case. The positives of the meal are the duck dumpling soup, swordfish and pork shoulder were good. The beef tartar was underwhelming. It is pretty apparent people come here for an \"experience\" unfortunately that was not enough for me. I expect to leave satiated regardless of whether I pay $30 or $155 for a meal. I believe the chefs love what they do, but have fallen into the current ridiculous trend of making pretty food that doesn't actually feed patrons. If you aren't wealthy and come here eat at the bar and try a few ala carte items, or just go to state bird if you can manage to get a table. Between state bird provisions and the progress I was far more impressed with state bird. I have a feeling state bird will continue its popularity,  while the progress will continue to find its stride. The fact that it is still hard to get a reservation at state bird shows that state bird has struck a cord with people. Maybe sometime in the future the progress can say the same.", "author": "Sheila L."}

It's not as difficult to nab them here as they are at State Bird Provisions (both by the same people), which is partially why we ended up here, but you still have to plan ahead. Family style, so be prepared to share your food with others. \n\nOur meal:\n(1) Assorted appetizer on the house -- YUM, loved this playful collection of a solid food and a sauce; the samosas and the plum were my favorites. \n\n(2) spiced don watson's lamb tartare with black sesame crisps - (8/10) - AMAZING, although I could have done without the black sesame crisps, which were light and fluffy and not oily at all, but felt strange pairing with the tartare\n\n(3) pig fry 'charcuterie' salad with fish sauce and herbs - (7/10) - enjoyed the asian inspired sauce and loved the herbs and how they brought balance from the saltiness of the pig, but still thought it was overhyped\n\n(4) 'treasure chest' of fermented sausage, trout quenelles and sweet onion-rice dumplings in a creamy pork broth (9/10) - delicious! essentially sausage + fish cake + mochi in ramen-esque broth, and the kimchi was a delicious and pleasant surprise, and the broth was to die for. \n\n(5) lamb merquez, octopus, and crispy squid in a yellow eye bean stew (6/10) -- impressive to have three proteins cooked in three different ways, but the crispy squid was the star of this dish. the stew was flavorful and the squid/octopus had great flavor, but the lamb was overpowering and salty and way too much. \n\n(6) grilled local spot prawns with brown butter & tiny garden vegetables (9/10) -- I don't like having to work for my food, but the sauce and the tiny tomatoes were AMAZING and were well worth the trouble.\n\n(7.1) coconut-cinnamon ice cream, plum sungold tomato caramel and hazelnuts (9/10) -- the caramel was really what won this dish, with the plum cutting through the sweetness and the hazelnuts/pastry puff bringing another texture and dimension to the flavors. \n(7.2) cocoa olive oil cake, meyer lemon curd cream and umeboshi peaches (6/10) -- be warned that the peaches are salted, reminiscent of salted caramel. overall okay, but nothing in comparison to the above dish. \n\nWas a bit disappointed, to be honest, with the overall meal.

Even though they've only been open for 2 weeks, things ran super smoothly, and food execution was spot on.\n\nThe space feels more open than State Bird, and there is a small bar area that is available for walk ins. Reservations are getting to be just as difficult as for State Bird next door.\n\nEverything is family style, so between the members of your table, you choose 6 courses (could be all 6 savory or could include dessert).  Cocktails were also really good.\n- Wild cat: I don't usually love licorice, but the absinthe in here was subtle, and the drink was very well balanced.  This was definitely my favorite\n- Negroni: a bit too heavy on the campari for me, but the umeboshi vermouth was interesting\n- El Diablo: if you like ginger beer, this one is good, not too sweet\n\nOnto Food:\n1. \"Amuse\": a giant platter that was like a full course in itself - this was a nice surprise!\n(a) Fried broccoli on a mushroom aioli: This is NOT your ordinary tempura broccoli - it was sweet and tender but had a good crisp outside with an almost potato chip flavor. I don't know how they did it, but this was the best broccoli I've ever had\n(b) Turnips with goat cheese cream: this was probably the most mild of the 4. \n(c) Chinese lap cheong: sweet, classic Chinese sausage flavor\n(d) Squid ink crackers with smoked trout, topped with horseradish: the squid ink crisps were very light and were really good; the horseradish was very mild, but the combination of all 3 things went really well together\n2. Dried duck: thinly sliced dried duck, which was on the saltier side, but this was balanced nicely with the smoked prunes and the potato croquettes.  The croquettes were small, nicely crisped, and actually pretty dense inside; the romesco was good with these, too\n3. Shaved cauliflower and pig fries: the cauliflower was like shaven kimchee, but the real star was the pig fries (pork belly, pig ears). The pig ears were amazingly crisp and had so much flavor - the pig fries were definitely one of the favorites of the table\n4. Farro spezzato with guanciale and octopus: the octopus was charred nicely but still very tender inside. The farro was creamy and topped with squab liver, which I had never had, but it added great flavor.  The guanciale was really nice with the creamy farro.\n5. Treasure chest: fermented sausage, fish quenelles (like Asian fish balls), tofu, pumpkin rice dumplings, and a tonkotsu dashi broth. The broth smelled like dashi and looked like ramen broth.  I loved the house made fermented sausage, which was very strong and savory.  The tofu was like agedashi tofu but had a thicker batter, which I didn't love, but it held up to the broth.  The pumpkin rice dumplings were like pumpkin gnocchi and were pretty amazing. There was also pickled cabbage on the bottom to balance out the dish. It was surprisingly good even though the ingredients sound kind of random.\n6. Smoked black cod fried rice: the black cod was not as strong as salt cod in traditional chinese fried rice, but I liked the less salty flavor of it, and it was in large pieces. Calamari added a nice texture.  If you're not expecting traditional salt cod fried rice, it's good; otherwise, it's a bit more mild\n7. Spiced squab with salted chili paste: the most impressive dish in terms of technical execution.  A very thin squab was perfectly charred but medium in the center (I assume sous vided), and it was cut up into bite sized pieces. Raddichio was spiced with 8 spices, and you wrap it with squab, smoked meyer lemon drizzle, and their house chili paste. This was the best squab I've had, and I've never had it cooked so perfectly. The lemon went surprisingly well with the spiced chili paste, and it was a very well balanced and unique dish.\n\nWe were all stuffed by the end.  Pacing was good on everything, portions were just right, and the dishes showed the chef's versatility.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-09", "description": "I suppose my new year's resolution is to eat out each night and at a new restaurant every time. I made my way out to The Progress with the BF and a friend visiting from LA (with whom I also went to SBP my first time!). We aren't the type to make reservations, so we pressed our luck by going early to wait in line for one of the few tables left open for walk-ins.\n\nThe BF and I arrived first at 4:30p; no one was in line yet, but the SBP queue had already gathered. Here's the deal: if you don't have a reservation, you can get there early to wait in line and try to snag one of the seated tables. There's also an option to eat in the bar, but the tables are small and best for 2 people max; I even saw some people standing to eat at the bar -- whatever works. \n\nThey open doors @ 5p for both resos and walk ins, with the option of hanging out by the bar to grab some drinks. For walk-ins, first seating is at 5:30p so we hung out for a bit. Cocktail prices are reasonable, with the usual selection of gin/rhum/bourbon/mezcal/tequila style drinks. Our table took awhile and I had to check in with the host again (who seemed a bit stressed), but we were eventually seated closer to 6p.\n\nThe dining style and cuisine focus is quite different from SBP -- less tapas/dim sum and more family style portions with a huge emphasis on Asian flavors. The table has to decide on 6 dishes to fit within the $65/person, but if you want to add additional dishes, it's an extra $10/person per dish. After you decide which 6 plates you want, the chef and staff will portion out the dishes depending on the size of the group. We selected the following:\n\n+ Amuse bouche of smoked lap xuong, fermented goat cheese and pickled radish, broccoli tempura, and toasted seaweed with a salmon/mustard seed topping - beautifully plated and great rich flavors to kick start our palates. This really set the tone of the Asian cuisine themed menu.\n+ Shaved cauliflower-herbs and pig fries - one of my favorites of the night; the pig fries were crispy yet chewy at the same time. I could have ordered 2 of these to myself.\n+ Sunchoke, rosemary, & pecorino \"roti\" - we saw someone order this at the bar and knew we had to get it as well. The roti dough was freshly made and presented in a tent like, folded manner with shavings of pecorino on top of it. I didn't care for the specks of rosemary in it, but the sunchoke was a nice break from the rich flavors.\n+ \"Treasure Chest\" of fermented sausage, fish quenelles, tofu & pumpkin rice dumpling in a creamy pork broth - the production of pouring the broth into the soup is part of the experience. Seriously, do not sleep on this. The broth is rich and creamy like a ramen broth, with the tofu fried to a unique consistency that still maintained it's fry even while in the broth. The sourness from the fermented sausage (reminded me of something we ate in CPH) created a well-balanced amalgamation of flavors.\n+ Don Watson's lamb scallopini with fava greens & cippolini - encrusted with sesame seeds, the lamb was cooked well and had a nice crisp due to the sesame seeds. By this time I was getting a bit full, so the smaller portion was fine by me.\n- Smoked black cod fried rice with squid & preserved lemon - I suppose I expected this to be like Mission Chinese Food's salted cod fried rice, and it wasn't. The consistency was more creamy and that's likely due to the rice being recently made; not the day old rice we usually use to make this ;)\n- Aromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste - we didn't actually order this, so when the chef brought it out we were confused. Our server had made a mistake and as a way to make-good, extended this plate gratis which was extremely courteous. Squab tasted like a mix between quail and lamb with a five-spice like rub; I wasn't over the moon about this dish so it was great that it was free. \n\nDessert: our server gave us the option to order both desserts as 1 dish which was awesome -- he just asked us which one we wanted more of to portion it out accordingly.\n+ Honey cocoa ice cream & olio nuovo w jasmine tea poached fruits, greengage plum jam & ricotta whey - dat honey cocoa ice cream was the richest chocolate ice cream I've ever had and want to keep eating. Mixing the jam and fruits together was also a nice refreshing touch.\n- Triple citrus sorbet & star anise lime caramel w gingered coconut floating island & candied buddha's hand - more neutral on this one, I could have eaten just scoops of the honey cocoa ice cream and been satisfied.\n\nService was impeccable (despite the delay in being seated and the host looking confused when I checked in with her), the ambiance was bright and lively, and the food was spectacular. The tables were actually made from a tree in the Presidio that was either cut or had fallen down 4 years ago, and had been curing ever since. Apparently I'm into tables.", "author": "Johanna L."}

I was so impressed upon being seated when our hostess asked if we had any dietary restrictions!  Wow!  I told her I was vegan and from that point on, any employee who made their way to our table knew that I was the vegan and explained my dishes to me.  It was really impressive and the food was absolutely delicious.\n\nAs I said, I didn't have a say in picking the restaurant and am not sure I would have picked it since I'm vegan and don't want to put them through a lot of trouble creating dishes that aren't their specialty.

My boyfriend wasn't a fan as he thought it was too acidic\n\n- 'treasure chest' of fermented sausage, trout quenelles - as Asians, suppose we thought it wasn't too special. The chinese sausage we have all the time (and we didn't even think it was the best type), but the pumpkin mochi was good. Nice to have a soup during the meal\n\n- smoked duck with marinated pioppini mushrooms & dried plum - we both thought not too memorable\n\nWe also ordered a serving of the dessert (poppyseed angel food cake) to share for the two of us, which is what the server recommended. It was fine - we wanted a dessert to round out the meal, but also wasn't super memorable.\n\nService was fast, it took 2 hours for our meal, even though the food came out quickly.

The best was the lamb merguez with yellow eye beans, octopus & crispy squid. Probably the best dish I have had in the last few years anywhere.  The  different flavors and textures matched perfectly.  An absolute standout dish.  \n\nNext best was the roasted mushrooms & kale with local wakame kraut.  Seemingly so simple but incredibly flavorful.\n\nNext best was the shaved cauliflower-herbs & pig fries, pretty fantastic as well.\n\nNext best was the smoked duck with marinated yellowfoot mushrooms & dried plum. \n\nThe only dish that disappointed for us was the grilled Five Dot Ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce.  Something about this just didn't gel and for us it was fairly bland.  So overall 5 of 6 dishes were very good to excellent, with the top three above being pretty fantastic.  \n\nOnly tried one cocktail, the Paloma, which was well balanced.  \n\nThe Progress is definitely worth another visit as six dishes leaves many things untasted.

You don't want to know the details.  Oh, and the cocktail I ordered was their spin a a pisco sour. No egg white, added pomegranite juice and that spritz of perfume taste. Made rez for about 10 days in advance, that's weird, everyone talks about long waits. It took me several days to be able to order any food that was artfully combined.

We wished we had asked more questions about the preparation.\n3) food was just okay\n\nWe spent $280 total and just expected a better experience for the cost. \n\nWe did really like the tasting platter at the beginning and the snapper", "author": "Alissa D."}

The food and cocktails were fantastic.  The menu has already changed quite a bit so I won't get into specifics on dishes, but you really can't go wrong.  The waitstaff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I am comparing it to State Bird (perhaps unfairly) and I prefer the serving style there to the family style serving at the Progress.  I love to share, but some of the food was difficult to serve.", "author": "Leslie B."}

Maybe we had too high expectations, but I was a bit disappointed with food. \nService was very good , but food was just OK to so-so.\nThinking back I liked some dishes and didn't like others, but there were no OMG moments at all. Also since we got $85 tasting menu I expected a more cohesive thought through meal, but instead we just got family style collection of different dishes that didn't always match/were not suppose to be served together.\nSo at the end of the day I got a lot of muddled flavors.\nAlso I think from the value perspective for $85-90 per person I would expect more .....", "author": "Julia Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-11", "description": "I don't usually feel inspired to write reviews unless I have a complaint, but in this case I have none at all. Our dinner here last week was fantastic - honestly, it lived up to the hype.\n\nWhen we arrived the host who greeted us said she was giving us the best seat in the house, and she was right - the table on the mezzanine near the entrance, where you can look out over the whole space and into the kitchen. I was surprised they sat a party of two at a four-top but we enjoyed the extra space. The interior is beautiful.\n\nWe chose: tuna crudo, shaved cauliflower and pig fries, sunchoke and rosemary roti, lamb scallopini, spiced squab, and one portion of each dessert (didn't realize you could do that but I was so happy to try both) - that's one honey cocoa ice cream with a buckwheat-beer crepe, and one guava sherbet and coconut floating island.\n\nThe pig fries were fantastic (the name of the dish is misleading; it's all about the pig). I would never have chosen the roti if I hadn't read reviews praising it, but it might have been my favorite dish; the rosemary worked really well to bring these seemingly disparate ingredients together. The squab was perfect. The tuna and lamb are the ones I'd be most likely to replace next time; they felt a little less creative in terms of flavor combinations.\n\nBoth desserts were great but if I had to criticize: they each come as two components, and we kept losing track of which ones went together. If I could split them up then I'd get a crepe (the poppyseed cream that came with it is wonderful) and a floating island.\n\nOn the recommendation of our waiter, we also had a half-carafe of the trousseau gris, which I would never have chosen but was an excellent match for us.\n\nThe portions were perfect - as two small women, we worried we'd run out of stomach space, but at the end I felt pleasantly full. Service was on point. Just overall a great experience.", "author": "K S."}

When we arrived there were about 25 people milling around the entrance.  Our reservation was for 8pm, and we were seated at 8:32.  Because they charge a $50 per person cancellation fee I believe the onus is on them to NOT overbook.  While waiting I had a beer at the bar.  They could have comped it, but I paid cash; $6.50 with a $1.50 tip.  Reviewed bill after dinner, which I rarely do.  An extra $6, which I questioned; it was for the beer that I had paid for.  No mention of it with the bill.  This is unacceptable, and I question the ethics of this place.  Very unfortunate", "author": "George S."}

From the beginning to the end it was a memorable experience.The restaurant has a casual atmosphere not fancy but well thought out. Everyone was very friendly and helpful from the maitre d to the all the servers and especially our waitress. The food was amazing and the service equally so. Its expensive but worth the price. You choose 6 dishes for $65 per person and they create the dishes for the size of your party. You can add a dish for $10 per person we added one dessert at the end. What I liked about the restaurant is that they brought out two items at a time and spaced the food. Bringing out the lighter items first and than the more entree driven items towards the end. They also grouped menu items that were complimentary and thus enhanced the taste and the experience. We had the ricotta, raw halibut, spring pea dumplings, baby favas, cod, squab and the apricot ice cream for dessert. I think our favorite dish was the favas. The food is fresh, hot and the chef created a wonderful blend of textures and flavors to enhance your dining experience.", "author": "Brenda S."}

Could easily walk by it on the street because there is no signage, but once you're inside it's a feast for the eyes.  Beautiful contemporary design with high curving ceilings, it is sophisticated, yet relaxed and welcoming.  Service was outstanding; attentive and informative without being intrusive. Our party of four shared 6 dishes and all were delicious with the standouts being the thai basil-curry oil marinated raw albacore and the spectacular sliced heirloom tomatoes with sweet corn-mt. tam croquettes. The 2012 Domaine Joseph Roty Gevry Chambertin was an excellent pairing.   All the desserts (and yes, we tried all 3) were outstanding. The Progress is a winner.", "author": "Peter C."}

The menu setup was confusing and required a lot of explanation from our server. $60 a person and you get to choose 4 dishes, that's it. The size of the dishes depends on the amount of people eating at the table. We had 5 people at the table. The small plates at the beginning came out before we even received the drinks we ordered. The food was pretty good, our favorites were the steak tartare, the sunchoke roti, and the tea smoked duck fried rice. The size of each plate, for 5 people to share, was really quite small. (Who decides how much 5 people can eat??! )When it was time for dessert, they were individual sized plates. They were actually really small and cost $10 a piece. We left hungry by the end of the meal, feeling that the whole experienced was overpriced, almost $500 after a few cocktails, a beer, a coffee, 3 desserts, and tax was added to the meal. One more thing, the seating is SO uncomfortable, solid wood chairs and benches for the booths. Our behinds were asleep by the end of the meal. Certainly will not be making a special trip to the city again to dine here.", "author": "Andrea D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-05", "description": "Very good food, but it's gratuitously expensive as well as pretentious in the modern \"tech money\" style. (Similar vibe to Central Kitchen.) Too noisy to have a comfortable conversation; hard, uncushioned wood seating; over-salted food. You have to agree with everyone at your table on the dishes that will each be shared family style. While some of the dishes we had were inventive and superb, asparagus is asparagus - telling me the farm it came from doesn't make it worth ten bucks for a few nicely sauced stalks. I felt really ripped off after spending $110 per person for dinner, with a single glass of wine each. If you've already had your IPO, go and have a good time. Otherwise there are many restaurants in town that are just as good or better, offer a more comfortable dining experience, and cost half the price.", "author": "tw s."}

We were able to sit at the bar, and order the six course choose your own adventure tasting menu.  It was super tasty.  Favorites included the roti with homemade ranch dressing. Hubs loved the cauliflower with \"pig fries.\" We both also loved the treasure bowl, which was a pork broth with all kinds of goodies in it. The first bite was just ok, but each bite just got better and better.  The cocktails are delicious and strong.

I'm a huge fan of State Bird so needed to try The Progress. The space is really inviting - the high ceilings give it a great feel. Everyone there was very welcoming and our server was very helpful in finding out ingredients for a friend of mine so we knew which selections to avoid. We love tapas so we actually selected 3 of the smaller dishes and 1 of the larger ones. In total, you get 5 small starters and then 4 larger dishes which was plenty! We also added some oysters which are not included in the pre-fixe price. On the starters, the highlights were the dates with the hazelnut crema, biscuits with apple bourbon black butter and strangely the crispy pig ear. I didn't think I would care for it but they were oddly addictive! The highlight of our meal where the tempura baby artichokes and the sunchoke roti. SO delicious! I could have eaten both those dishes myself. The simplicity of the dishes was amazing with how well balanced and flavorful they were.

On our first visit we were two people and they had just opened so the portions were a little small and the timing of the dishes was odd. But the food was good.  (Good, but not great) The second time was yesterday and we had five people. I think we had more food per person as I was very full when we left. I especially enjoyed the complementary starter platter of crispy fish, salmon, beef jerky, and a few other things. Other highlights were the treasure chest ( am in love with the tender pumpkin-rice dumplings) and wild mushrooms and kale.  I didn't think the texture or flavor balance of the squab was that great. The squab was very very rare and thus hard to chew.  The grilled beef with mustard miso was only ok.  Nothing memorable about the flavors or texture. Also, I wish the wine list had a few more food-friendly Rhone wines in the fifty dollar range.", "author": "Priscilla C."}
