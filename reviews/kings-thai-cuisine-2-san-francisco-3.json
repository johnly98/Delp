I had one of the best Pad Z-Ew ever! I'm usually worried that the restaurant would put too much soy sauce and it would come out too salty, but this place put just the right amount. Thankfully, the beef was well cooked (some places don't cook it all the way through and it's unpalatable). The beef slices were quite thin, which made it easily edible as opposed to thick slices. I liked their choice of Chinese broccoli as the vegetable stir fried with the noodles. From sharing a Tom Yum soup, I would say it's more mellow compared to other places, which some people prefer. Personally, I like spicy and sour Tom Yum soups. \n\nI feel like they could have tried a little harder with the restaurant decor. Some cultural artifacts would be appreciated, as opposed to bland tables and chairs. The ceiling still looks like the standard grids you see in offices. However, the up side is that the tables can be easily arranged to accommodate groups of varying sizes. The menu is quite extensive, offering many options such as vegetarian food, curry, soup noodles, and dessert. It is one of the most variegated I've seen in Thai restaurants.", "author": "Louis Suo L."}

I moved back home to Hawaii and this is still one of my go to places when I visit The Bay. \n\nSurrounded by a bunch of Asian markets and restaurants, King of Thai, which used to be called King of Thai Noodle, is the best place for Thai in that area. Although the prices have changed the quality and quantity of the food is huge. So it'll definitely curb your appetite. \n\nYou have to order the Papaya Salad. It's a must try. So tasty with a bit of a kick to it. The crab fried rice is also a staple for us when we order. You also can't go wrong with Panang Curry. Just the rice and curry alone is enough to feed 4 people. Pad Thai is also one of those things that have to compliment your Thai meal, so be sure to get an order. \n\nThe place is still a little tight. Not good for big crowds.

I noticed a visa and MasterCard logo on the window, and I figured i'll give this place a try.  \n\nThe break down: \nFood: 3/5.... mediocre food but good sized portion. \nService: 2/5... My waiter never checked in on me.\n\nThe reason I give this place a 1 star is because they have $15 minimum charge for credit cards.  I thought this is ridiculous since my total bill was $13.51.  The waiter said I can order a Thai Tea or something else. \n\nI didn't want to order anything else. I asked the waiter to charge me the .25 cent fee it will cost to swipe my card.  She said no, and was persistent that I ordered something else. It was until I said,  \"just charge me the 15 dollars, but I will not tip,\" that she swiped my card for 13.51.\n\nWhat gets me angry is that they are robbing customers of a few extra bucks. I am sure an average bill after tax for a single person is around $13- $14. They set the minimum right above the average cost, and expect customers to buy more to meet the minimum requirement. If that's not robbery, what is?  If that's not the case, they should charge a small  credit card fee.\n\nBecause the owners are cheap, and scam their customers, they lose a potential loyal customer.... over a couple of cents(transaction fees).", "author": "Ngoc T."}

I've been coming to this place since it was still named King of Thai during my high school years. The food quality and taste continues to be top notch.\n\nI've gotten many dishes here: pad see ew, pad kee mao, kao pad, etc. but my absolute favorite dish that I get every single time nowadays is the kao pad gai tod, which is the fried chicken over fried rice.\n\nThe portion size of the fried chicken over fried rice is ENORMOUS. Two people can share one plate and they'll both be full. BUT IT'S SO DELICIOUS THAT I FINISH IT EVERY TIME. The chicken is crispy on the outside, and tender and juicy on the inside. I like to cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and dip each one in the sweet chili sauce before popping them into my mouth. I also like to get some of the green pickled chili slices from the side containers and drop some on my chicken and fried rice when I want some extra spice. The fried rice is very tasty to eat by itself too.\n\nFree parking is a pretty hard to find around this area, so you may have to settle for metered spots if you drive here. I like this place more than the other King's Thai Cuisine on 8th avenue because this one is bigger, cleaner, and credit card is accepted ($15 minimum).", "author": "Wesley S."}

We usually get the Pad See Ew (with chicken or seafood) and the Yellow Curry Chicken and are always very satisfied with both whenever we get it, and probably spend a little over $30, which is a steal! I'm sure there are fancier Thai places in SF, but I like classic Thai food, and this place always hits the spot for me!

On this particular night, we decided to come by for dinner and get our usual: a CUP of tom kha, and our individual entrees. We specifically stated that we wanted just a CUP of this soup, and we weren't told no or anything. When our orders were brought out, the waitress brought over 2 BOWLS of the tom kha and told us that they only have 1 size and that this is what we ordered. My friend and I told her we asked for a cup and that we weren't told otherwise. Another waitress came by and said they had a regular size and a bowl, and that we ordered the \"bowl\" instead. She tried to have us keep our bowls and we said no, we want the small size. She gave us such a hard time for no reason at all and then was rude to us for the remainder of our meal.

The spring rolls were vegetarian, stuffed with leafy lettuce, bean thread noodles, and tofu. Alone, it was a bit of a tasteless bite. You really had to use the provided peanut sauce which was definitely a star. Made in house, this sauce comes out warm and chunky with lots of chopped peanut pieces. Our second appetizer were the curry puffs. Our puffs were definitely super overfried in my opinion - brittle and oily. But the curried potatoes on the inside had good flavor.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered a variety of dishes to pass back and forth between our party of 6. Everything more or less tasted the same unfortunately due to the excessive amount of curry. Definitely a missed opportunity to really marinate the various proteins to add just a bit of extra oomph to each dish. My favorite was probably the Siam House Special Noodles. The coconut flavor really came through in this curry tossed flat noodle dish. It also had the most variety of toppings which was nice. Second favorite was probably the duck curry despite the duck flavor really being masked. The addition of lychees to this dish gave it a nice fruit, sweet undertone though.\n\nI also ordered a lychee iced tea to my meal. Definitely found it way too sweet though. Too bad.\n\nAll in all, our meal came out to be $125 for about 8 dishes. It definitely wasn't the best Thai food I had for the price paid.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

The service isn't all that great but the food I've ordered has always been consistent. There have been a couple of plates I've tried that weren't my personal favorites so I've refrained from ordering those and given their other items a try and it made up for the ones I didn't like. \nOn my last visit with friends we ordered 3 entrees to share and an appetizer. To start off we ordered curry puffs which have become sort of my go to by now. The potatoes inside the puffs are extremely tasty and it comes with some garnish that adds a sweet subtle flavor to the puff. Then we had yellow curry with rice, Pad Kee Mao and Tom Kha. The yellow curry with rice is definitely a go to because it always tastes great with warm rice. You can choose to make it vegetarian or add protein of your choice. The Pad Kee Mao was really spicy but also tasted great. If you're not a lover of spicy things then probably avoid this dish. It was solid and we all enjoyed it. Next was the Tom Kha; this one actually left a bit to be desired. Since it was a coconut milk soup we thought it would be rich but tasted somewhat watered down but it wasn't completely horrible. \nFor drinks we had their sangria and Thai tea. Both drinks were pretty great and we all enjoyed them. \nThe cost of all of this was $59 and some change which is pretty affordable considering we all left really full and satisfied as well as with leftovers for the next day. \nAs for the service, this restaurant is kinda popular for college students at USF so given that we went on a busy night full of college students, our server was pretty busy and it even took them a while to take our order. What made up for it was that the food came out really quick and although our main server was busy with other tables, other staff would come and constantly fill our water cups which I really appreciated.", "author": "Melanie L."}

We arrived around 9pm and were seated immediately. We had our waitress by our side the moment we sat down and she was taking our drink orders and appetizer orders super quickly. Within 10 minutes we received our appetizers, which were very fresh and tasty, as usual. We ordered the spicy calamari, which is one of my favorites. Then we had the fried tofu with peanut sauce, which of course is always very good when it comes out hot and we also decided to try the curry puff which was a major hit at our table. Overall the appetizers were a great success and very filling, so in a sense we didn't even really need main courses, but we all love to eat, so we each proceeded to get a main dish for ourselves. \n\nI personally ordered the Pad Gra Praw (Minced Chicken), with a side of steamed vegetables. This dish was very light and full of flavor. My boyfriend & friend ordered the half size Tom Kah Soup, one with chicken and the other with shrimp. They both were really happy with their choice in soup, because the soup was cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of aromatic flavors. My other friend went with the chicken pad thai and was very delighted with his meal. The portions for all these items were just the right size. There wasn't too much, but there wasn't too little, so we were satisfied with our late night dinner choices. \n\nThe final bill came out to about $70 dollars total for all the food, which is a awesome, especially with the amount of food that we ordered. \n\nThis still stands as one of my favorite places to go to when it's late and there isn't much to choose from on a late night!!", "author": "Julia K."}

I tried this place today for lunch for the first time. The food was not good.  It was too fishy because they put lots and lots of dried shrimps in my dish. \n\nWhen I went to pay with my credit card, the owner told me, very rudely, that they have a $15 minimum charge for credit cards, I asked her if she could possibly make exceptions and she said no. So I explained to her that I'm temporarily disabled. It would be very far and difficult for me to walk out to get cash. She yelled at me to go outside to get cash, otherwise I have to buy more food. I said \"No\" to her and told her I didn't want to buy more food.  I asked her to be more polite, and she was so angry at me. \n\nI briefly checked their main entrance and the windows. There was no notification or service agreement sign which specifies a minimum charge for using credit cards. I asked her why there was no posting of a large sign in a visible place. She yelled and pointed out the tiny sign right next the cash register which was far from my table. It was so tiny and impossible to read from my seat. I told her the sign is too small to see. She snatched my credit card and told me I need to follow the law. \n\nI told her I can't bear her rudeness and disrespectful treatment, and  I will not pay until she apologizes to me. She threatened me that she would call the police.  Three officers arrived very quickly. I explained what happened to me. One of the officers told me it's the law and I need to follow the law. However he told me I could write a Yelp review or notify the BBB (Business Better Bureau). \n\nI'd never ever go back to this place again.", "author": "Jun Y."}

The fried chicken comes with sweet chili sauce which you don't really need because the fried rice is sooo bomb that I kinda wish I ordered a plate to-go.

When I had gotten my receipt it was $9.95, plus and extra $3.00! I asked what the $3.00 was for and the guy plating the food said it was for the extra seafood I requested. I told him I did not request extra seafood. He called our waitress over and they were speaking in some kind of language, which we did not understand. The guy told us that our waitress said I said extra seafood. I told him I chose seafood, but the word extra did not come out of my mouth.

It comes with 2 1/4 sliced tomato, but this time it came with 3. So basically they gave him 3/4 of a tomato. 1/4 of a slice was an extra $1.00! Oh heavens!

Few minutes later she brings us tea, stood there asking us to put in our dinner order. We told her we need few minutes more to decide. Within 2 minutes  she comes back again asking us to put in our order. So finally we rushed and put in our dinner order. 20 min later they bring out crab fried rice, and we asked what happened to our appetizers. They all look at each our like we are speaking a foreign language. So we told them to take this back and bring our appetizers first. Then the waitress comes by and say \"my Bad\" really!!  10 min goes by now they bring out our Pad-Thai, still no appetizers. We asked to speak to the manager. Manager is no where to be found the premises. You are in a customer service business at least make sure you employees are trained well or be available to face your customers.

Menu was very similar to King of Thai and Kin of Thai Zagat frames are still on the wall so I expected the food to be the same. \n\nFood- I usually order the #4 at King of Thai, but decided to order the #3 here this time because I didn't feel like beef balls or sliced beef. I got it with my usual small rice noodle. Husband ordered the mixed noodle (I call it mixed because there is pork, chicken, fish cake, etc etc) in clear chicken broth. The bowls were HUGE and came out quickly. But to my disappointment, my noodles were not the same King of Thai noodles. The broth looked and tasted different and the rice noodles kept breaking when I used chopsticks to put them into my spoon. Argh! Broth was much fattier (with glops of fat on top- like ramen except this ain't ramen!) and is already spicy (which I don't mind). The biggest disappointment off all is that there was zero beef stew even though #3 is supposed to be beef stew. It was all beef tendon!!! Thank goodness I don't mind tendon! But they should really add that detail on their menu \"beef tendon stew\". Oh well, the hot noodles still cured my hunger on that cold rainy night. Husbands noodle I thought was better. The broth was clear as stated on the menu and it had a nice chicken flavor tho just a tad bit too salty for me. \n\nSERVICE/STAFF- nice and friendly staff. Orders were taken correctly (I think) and they came to check on us once during our meal. This usually does not happen at the King of Thai that we frequent to. Waitress came to give me a hot tea refill and cleared our bowls away when we were done eating but didn't pay bill or finish our drinks yet.\n\nPLACE/DECOR- fairly clean looking tables and chairs. Photos of King and Queen of Thailand on wall. TV was playing NBA and lots of Zagat frames on the wall. Not a lot of seating, maybe around 20. Bathroom is in the back opened with sliding door, not really clean, but wasn't disgusting. \n\nStill deserving a solid 3 stars from me though my noodles turned out to be beef tendon noodles because it was still tasty, food came out fast, and service was good.

A message in the window from the owner explains that there was a family dispute (I understand it's over politics in Thailand) and they separated from the original KOTN. The KOTN locations have gone more upscale and raised their prices, while King Thai Cuisine is closer to the original menu which is a very good thing.\n\nStill, I think you should consider the funkier original location up the street before settling in here. For two reasons: first, the other one is marginally cheaper--$7.75 vs $8.45 for beef noodle soup as of August 2015. Second, they've doctored the menu with white-out up the street rather than reprinting it, which means it has more items on it (though not all may be avallable).\n\nBut if you get a parking spot and don't feel like an exploratory walk, this place is just fine. And definitely better than the KOTN side of the family.", "author": "Otis M."}

You walk in, awkwardly standing there for minutes waiting to get seen so that you can get seated. Once they finally assign you to a table, they disappear for another 15 minutes and don't even provide a glass of water at the very least. It's impossible to flag them down. I'm literally at the table, raising and waving my hand like an elementary school student, hoping that you'll call on me next! Finally, they see you, and you receive the worst attitude for flagging them down. \"Hold on, please!\" Then, they disappear for another 15 minutes. Each time, I have to wait a *minimum* of 30 minutes to get some food served (even water). \n\nI usually give tips, even to mediocre service... Because everyones' gotta make a living, right? But my very last experience here was so bad, I just couldn't tip anymore. And it will probably be my last time here for good. \n\nIt's unfortunate, it really is.

King's Thai is conveniently located on Clement & 4th right by the Inner Richmond bar circuit: The Bitter End, Abby Tavern, Ireland's 32, Plough & The Stars, Neck of the Woods, and Fizzee's are all within a short walking distance of King's Thai Cuisine. As a result many trips have been made here inebriated on the way home from said bars. \n\nBut to dismiss King's Thai Cuisine as simply \"drunchie\" food would do them a disservice. King's Thai stands the test and tastes good when you are sober as well. The restaurant is convenient, the service is decent, and the food comes fast and is good. When you are craving Thai with large portions (always leftovers for later) on a reasonably low budget this is the place to be. \n\nMy personal favorite dishes are the Panang Curry (red curry + peanut sauce s/w meat + onions & peppers), the Yellow Curry (s/w meat + potatoes, onions, carrots), the Pad See Ew (flat noodles + meat in soy glaze sauce s/w egg * Chinese broccoli), and Tom Kha (a rich soup made from coconut milk, chicken stock, ginger, lime, & fish sauce s/w mushrooms onions and choice of meat).", "author": "Tomas K."}

Where would you get comfort food from then?! All kidding aside, my family and I have always loved the ease at which you could order up a plate of no-frills, hearty, tasty Thai food for less than $10 a dish. And the variety of sauces on the table! No other place compared. We would eat in, order out, and come to King of Thai on the fly. The restaurant, it seems, has upgraded in recent years. Since I no longer live in the neighborhood, it was a surprise to me how much they changed up their appearance. They took down all wall signs, replaced one of their walls with a dark wood, and kept one side with the original wall-to-wall mirrors. Their menus are no longer paper and plastic.. they upgraded to a fancy leather bound version. The menu appears to be the same, but the portions are smaller. They unfortunately do not have the same variety of sauces and peppers that they used to have. =\\ I ordered a Thai tea and roast duck over rice. I'm used to having leftovers, but I pretty much consumed the entire thing (save a few pieces.. I was really trying to practice some self control and not overeat). Like most restaurants have done in the past few years or so, they also raised prices. I have to say, though, King's Thai still has impeccable service.

SO HO HUM. That's all I think. I don't normally order anything that's not from above list. \n\n\nThe service can be really rude.", "author": "Margaret S."}

And they remodeled and changed the name! Anyways, I love both King's Thai Cuisine on clement street but this one is my favorite because of the spaciousness. I recommend their specials, they're always unique than a lot of the stuff you find at Thai restaurants. From the regular menu I really like the combination beef noodle soup with wide noodle and the fried chicken over fried rice. If I need a little spice in my life, I'd order the pad prik khink with chicken and a fried egg on top (make it spicy). The sangria is so good here (better than Cha Cha cha's in my opinion). For dessert I would get the mango sticky rice!!! Love this place, definitely will always come back!", "author": "Keerati C."}

You walk in through a tiny entrance that shows their cook space which might freak you out or set you off if you see a fly from the streets of Clement wander in which is highly likely. You are instantly greeted as this is also where the wait staff stand. The seating itself is very limited as this restaurant is really small. They're open nice and late so when you have a hankering for some inexpensive Thai this could be your go to spot. Their tea is delicious. I think I can drink so many cups of it and they happily refill! The problem with this place is that it's hard to find parking sometimes and they don't accept credit card. A lot of spots here don't but this one really should. People aren't running around with tons of cash especially not late at night. Cheap eats, quick eats... No credit cards!

The noodles in the soup were not as firm as we would have liked and we were hoping for more stewed beef meat and less tendon. However, the broth was rich and flavorful. The pad thai was delicious. It wasn't too sweet and the prawns were large and well seasoned. The tofu was nice and crunchy. The stir fried green beans with meat were spicy and flavorful.

This is your place. I love, love, love this neighborhood and wish I lived here but that's another story. We were craving Thai food and this definitely hit the spot. But the things is: we waited and we waited and we waited....to even get some kind of attention after we had already waited and waited and waited just to be seated! We started to make bets and then we made a plan to leave if we didn't get served in...X amount of minutes. We ended up staying because our server arrived just in the nick of time. It was THAT slow. I totally get that meals don't have to be rushed and really shouldn't be rushed if you can help it - and we weren't even in a particular hurry - but we were very thirsty and also quite hungry after an afternoon at the deYoung. And when you're thirsty and hungry, this kind of waiting is just irritating. Ok now onto the food: as I said, decent but not amazing. I ordered Tom Yum Goon with chicken (one of my favorites) and it was tasty but the broth was a bit heavy for my liking. My husband and our friend ordered other dishes. One was a duck salad and the other was served in an actual coconut. Our friend LOVED his coconut curry dish, my husband said his salad was just OK. Would I return? Yeah, sure, why not.

There were only two other diners besides myself in the room.  I was hungry and ordered the Grilled Honey Pork special and Yellow Chicken Curry.  The waitress suggested the sticky rice that came with the Pork would be sufficient for the curry and that I wouldn't need more. She delivered the food and I never saw her again to ask how I liked the food or if I needed anything else.  I thought the pork would be cut up in cubes. Instead, it was served as 3 thin slices which were predominantly 3/4 fat.  I was very disappointed.  The yellow curry was in a bowl so large it looked like soup with little else in it.  My spoon did discover pieces of chicken and some potato. I brought the fatty pork to the restaurant's attention but they did nothing about it saying I should have said something before eating it.  The glaze however hid the fat until you were actually cutting it up.  By the amount of fatty meat left on my plate I thought it was obvious. Most places would have apologized and offered something.
