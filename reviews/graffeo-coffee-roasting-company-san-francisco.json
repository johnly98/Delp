The food is really very good there, and if you're in the area, I suggest you give them a try - but that's another post.\n\nThis is really about the coffee that I finished up my meal with.\n\nNormally, I am a huge fan of Peet's Major Dickason's Blend for my drip brewed morning coffee at home, and then when pressing the DeLonghi Magnifica into service - long about three in the afternoon - I'll sip some wonderful Illy. One sugar. And, either a biscotti or a madeleine. Never both. Savored, dipped and nibbled.\n\nThis is what being civilized is all about. it's not so much about stopping to smell the roses, as it is slowing down to appreciate the luxurious liquor that a fine roasted coffee bean can provide. It's heady. Sirupy. Sensual. Yes, Illy is rather expensive, I suppose - especially since I love the Illy Brazilian MonoArabica.  But really, a single? Occasionally a double? Certainly such a small cuppa love deserves putting the very best beans forward. No?\n\nI digress. \n\nI have found a new love. Full-bodied. Not bitter. Bold yet silky smooth. Like a velvet glove being drawn lightly down one's spine. By candlelight. Motioning the waiter over, I had to know what this magical elixer was.\n\nHuh? Graffeo? Never heard of it.\n\nThat's embarrassing, since I'm not exactly new to San Francisco. But Graffeo has been right there in North Beach since 1935 - roasting amazing dark, rich blends of Costa Rican, Guatamalan and New Guinea beans. Zagat knew about them, as did Wine Spectator! Sheesh. They positively swoon over Graffeo - gushing things like \"best coffee around\", \"Number 1 Coffee\", \"best beans on the planet\", and something about it being served at the Oscars.\n\nThis Graffeo outfit seems to be what companies like Peet's used to be about: Family. Passion. Quality. Don't get me wrong. I still drink Peet's, but the family finally sold out to a larger company from Europe, and we'll see what happens as the thing evolves.\n\nIt didn't take me long to check them out online - and get ordering. And, that's when I noticed something very interesting - that differentiates Graffeo from all the rest. They don't 'do' flavors. And they don't 'do' every variation and version under the sun - trying to capture every taste and palate out there in the usual coffee marketing strategy. They keep it simple - and very high quality.\n\nGraffeo does dark, light and Swiss Water Process decaf. Period. They'll combine some half dark/decaf, half light/decaf - and a 3/4 dark or light over the decaf.\n\nThat's as far as they're going, thank you very much. Eight premium choices. If you need more, go get the floorsweep from that Seattle outfit. Come to think of it, I'm burnt out on the surplus of often mediocre choices that companies offer nowadays. Dozens of choices do not necessarily equate to quality.", "author": "Cynthia R."}

How about 8 salad dressing choices (you'll pick ranch in the end, anyway) or a build-your-own taco station with more types of salsa and fixings than there are people in the restaurant?\n\nThe effect of having too many choices is that we often have none at all, really. It's a paradox. But that makes it no the less true. Put me in front of a shelf of 60 shampoos, and my mind will turn to mush, I'll revert back to age 6, and I'll become suddenly vulnerable to TV advertising ... silky radiance! A full head of hair!

A $7.99 12 oz. bottle of foamy suds?\n\n(Pause, as I get down from my soap box).\n\nSo, Graffeo, huh? Why trek all the way here for only 3 basic choices*: light, dark, or 50/50? Isn't there a Peets or Starbucks nearby where you can get your beans cheaper and in prettier packages? Why not head down to the Ferry Building and get a sexy-looking 8 oz. bag of Blue Bottle beans and flirt** with the super-chic baristas who will give you an impromtu \"coffee consultation\" to find just the right beans for your lifestyle after you've waited in a line 20 people deep? Why North Beach, why this place, which does not actually serve coffee and has a 1/2 pound minimum purchase?

Just because.\n\nLight, dark, 50/50, whatever. It's all good here. They've got caf class and they've got caf style. The secret is in the beans, the heat, and the knowhow that takes a generation or more to master. Scruffy-haired fly-by-night back alley roasters with college degrees can't match that, no matter how slick their under the radar screen advertising is. \n\nTry Graffeo once, and then you'll know. It won't be a one-time deal. Once you do Graffeo, you're in it for life. \n\nHow's THAT for a choice, ya'll?\n\n(*) Technically, they offer decaffeinated beans, too.

It's one of the only fluid bed roasters in the world, where the coffee beans are treated like fluid.\n\nI don't know if you've ever had Graffeo. I was turned onto it recently, and I think, quite frankly (and this is no bullshit, as I've had my share of good coffee), it's the best coffee I've ever tasted. It reminds me a little of what I like about Kona coffee. It's better than Blue Bottle, much better, and I think Blue Bottle is excellent, though my friend D. thinks otherwise. And he's a coffee expert among experts.\n\nIt's not grassy, like San Francisco Bay coffee. It's not burnt like Charbucks. It's nutty and chocolatey and smooth. It's got that something going on that's undefinably delicious, almost offputting. It's so good you can't believe it, and believe it you will, at least I did. And now I'm a convert.\n\nRuch Reichl of the New York Times once called it the best coffee in the world. It's a combination of New Guinea, Columbian and Costa Rican beans.\n\nD. described the process of the fluid bed roaster to me. It'll roast 3 loads in an hour, a load being 180 lbs. It's got a vacuum that sucks the beans up through a pipe into... I'm not a mechanical engineer, and since I'm slightly tipsy, I can't recall the terms D. used as he led me through, but I can assure you that if you like coffee and you're in San Francisco, you'll be pleasantly blown away by Graffeo.", "author": "Abendigo R."}

In a way, such is rather unfortunate considering their prime location. Nonetheless, they focus on one thing, and that one thing they do right. If you want a tatse of their coffee, simply head over to Mario's Bohemian Cigar Store on the corner of Union & Columbus and ask for a single espresso. Add a small spoon of sugar if you like, and tell me if this isn't the best espresso around.\n\nSince I love coffee, and I do not own a professional espresso maker, I instead brew Graffeo coffee in a drip coffeemaker. I buy one pound of half & half at a time. I have it ground ahead of time, since it really does not affect the quality as long as you store it in an air-tight and light-tight container, and as long as you use it within a week or two.\n\nGraffeo coffee is $13.25 per pound. It is not cheap, but remember, most of the coffee you buy is not sold in one pound bags - they are usually 12 ounces. The price definitely holds up to the superior quality.", "author": "Geoffrey B."}

Over the years I've sampled dozens of different beans, and finally I've alighted on a source I'll return to without trepidation (with the caveat that change is the only constant). The beans create fantastic espressos, at least for my grinder and machine (a Rancillio). The espresso emerges the color of caramel, the flavor is richly chocolaty, yet balanced and smooth. Graffeo dark roast consistently offers me 'all crema all the time' espressos, unlike Blue Bottle and various other artisanly-selcted beans that I've tried. Fortunately, the caffeine content seems low, for I've yet to suffer the jitters, unlike with some other dark roasts I've tried. The avuncular man behind the counter further validated my joy at discovering these beans; I would feel conflicted if the espresso were delicious, but the service was snide or indifferent.

I love the place (s):  No frills storefronts with a giant roasting machine center stage, raw beans in bags piled up everywhere, roasted beans in 50 gallon garbage cans ready for sale, a couple of commercial grinders and a cash register.  But most important I love the beans:  The dark roast produces the best espresso I've ever made (on our Pasquini Livietta).  Friends and neighbors \"drop by\" unannounced for a cup when they think the machine might be fired up.  And since we moved from Marin (where I used to buy from the San Rafael store) to Los Angeles we continue to buy only Graffeo.  But I miss the ritual of going to the store and taking in the aroma of roasting beans and yapping with the guys behind the counter.  So rather than buy from their convenient online store, I prefer to call them every month or so to place my 3 pound order.  Just the sound of Luigi's familiar voice brings calm to this stormy, impersonal time we live in and gives me a sense of something being right in the world.  And in keeping with their impeccable service, the order arrives almost instantly to my doorstep.  Like I said, Graffeo has changed my life.", "author": "Patricia G."}
