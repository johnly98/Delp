{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-10", "description": "12/17/17\n\nSo, get this...\n\nWe were here to take out my gf's cousin and his mom for dinner.  He's from China, finished undergrad here, and just landed a job at Facebook (and he bragged that the sign-on bonus alone was enough for him to live on for years.)  His mom came here from China for a vacation, to celebrate with him, and so since she's only here for a short while we figured we'd take them out...\n\nAt one point we were talking about my gf's amazing cooking (she's in chef school) so I whipped out my phone to show them pics of her yummy stuff...\n\nHe looks at me working my phone and asks, \"What's that!?!?\"\n\n\"Facebook.\"\n\n....\n............. Yeah.\n\nSo I stared at him, then looked down at his shirt, black with the Facebook logo.  .......and gulped my food down...\n\n..\n\n....alright, so this was like 4 months ago and I didn't take notes.  I don't remember the food much except it was mostly average, but the owner and other server were VERY nice to us.  They were very gracious and humble, and quite social, making many suggestions to us as we contemplated our choices.  As the night wore on they continued to impress us with their service, being extremely attentive and friendly.  This was VERY remarkable given the vast majority of the best Chinese restaurants have terrible service.  In fact, having good service almost is a bad sign for getting authentic Chinese!--well, I guess good for us the food was good enough.\n\nMy gf luckily has a semi-photographic memory for food, so I'm just going to print her notes here:\n\n1. Drunken Chicken $9.00:  \"I think this tasted standard, do not remember anything special about this one.\"\n\n2. Shreaded Bean Curd with Fried Green Onion $7.00:  \"Did not get the eat this, because it was far from me. It looked fresh though.\"\n\n3. Shanghai Steamed Dumpling with Pork $9.75:  \"The flavor of filling and soup was pretty good, but the skin was not good, soggy and leaking.\"\n\n4. Pressed Duck (Half):  \"Before we ordered my bf confirmed with owner that the duck is fried. It looked like fried, but it was definitely not freshly fried. It was little cold and hard. But I think the duck is dry brined or something like that, so it had the special salty taste. I liked the flavor, but texture was not good.\"\n\n5. Braised Meatball with Vegetable in Clay Pot $10.95:  \"This is a very traditional dish in Shanghai. The meatball is supposed to be huge and super juicy/ tender. It's also called lion king ball in Chinese. This was ok, tasted like a dish my mom could cook at home. The meatball tasted average, do not have that super tender texture it's supposed to have.\"\n\n6. Smoked Ham, Salted Pork with Bamboo Shoots and Soy Bean Sheet Knots:  \"This is another very traditional soup dish from Shanghai. The key to this dish is that the bamboo needs to be super fresh and broth needs to be rich and little salty. I think this one tasted standard, nothing special.\"\n\n7. Stir Fry Special (not on menu, written in Chinese on the wall):  \"This stir fry has the special vegetable JiaoBai (do not know the English name). It's like a root vegetable and I think it's only available in spring. The slice it and cook with thinly sliced pork with soy sauce. This one tasted good, especially if you eat with bowl of white rice. The pork was tender and vegetables tasted fresh with right amount of sauce.\"\n\n8. Boiled Sweet Rice Ball in Wine and Cassia Blossom Soup:  \"I liked this one very much. The soup has right amount of sweetness and I can also taste the rice wine as well as the dry cassia blossom. The wine flavor is subtle , not overpowering. The filling is sweetened black sesame, which was very tasty.\"\n\nSo, really, the food was just a 3/5, but since the prices were pretty good, and the service was so extraordinary for an authentic Chinese restaurant, I'd give them...\n\n4/5\n\n\n#chinese #sanfrancisco #star", "author": "Dean C."}

I always order at least XLB and pork shank, a typical Shanghai dish. Food was good in the past. XLB was dry, practically no soup. The pork had no taste. My girlfriend cooks low salt. She agreed there was no flavor to the pork or the sauce. \nUpon complaining, the waiter brought us extra sauce. We had to add salt to the extra sauce. My girlfriend blurted, \"Even the salt has no flavor!\" It was Saturday night from 7 to 8:15.  Place was nearly empty. Parking is impossible. I'm not coming back.", "author": "Sammy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-15", "description": "Granting my request for more xiao long bao, the hubby braved the crowded, crazy roads of San Francisco and drove us to Old Shanghai for what we hoped to be an excellent lunch. \n\nParking is a nightmare and there are a few specific slots in front of the restaurant that have a strict 30 minute limit. Argh! Luckily, there is a parking garage right across the road (located on top of a Ross and Walgreens) that charges $1 for every 20 minutes, which is actually reasonable for SF parking. The restaurant itself is on the tiny side with large round tables to accommodate bigger parties and square tables for smaller ones.\n\nWe were greeted with a sincere smile and politely led to our table that was dressed with clean white plates and utensils. Already, I was impressed with the service. It was much more welcoming than most Asian restaurants we have been to. The menu is gigantic, but neatly organized into categories like dim sum, noodles, cold dishes, and proteins. I did spot some spelling mistakes, but nothing too glaring.\n\nHungry and raring to eat, we chose xiao long bao (of course!), green onion pancake (hubby's favorite), wonton soup, and Chinese donuts (only offered for weekend lunch). Food came out fairly quickly and presentation was neat. The Chinese donut was crispy, but shone with an oily sheen that made me feel guilty the minute I took a bite, but it paired well with the wonton soup. The soup was certainly the \"fanciest\" wonton soup we've had with sauteed garlic pieces, strips of eggs, and dark pieces of seaweed. While we enjoyed the light flavor of the broth, the wontons themselves were a tad bit on the bland side.\n\nThe green onion pancake was crispy, but too dense for our preference. We couldn't finish the whole serving. As for the long awaited xiao long bao, I was disappointed. Each dumpling stood tall and looked quite lumpy from the large pork filling on the inside. The lack of delicious soup, however, was upsetting. We barely slurped up anything. \n\nOld Shanghai is a great place in terms of clean decor and attentive service, but if you're coming for a xiao long bao fix like we were, we can't say it'll be worth the trek.", "author": "Quyen L."}

Old Shanghai seemed like a good choice from the Yelp reviews, but after the meal, my parents were disappointed by the quality and portion of food and the service. \n\nWe ordered:\n- Tofu with shanghai green soup\n- Xiao long bao\n- Whole fish in sweet and sour sauce\n- Rice with salted pork and vegetables in clay pot\n- Shredded bean curd with yellow chives\n- Another vegetable dish (not on menu, but on the specials board) with wood ear, lotus, and mushrooms. \n\nI think out of everything, the only decent dishes were the xiao long bao and the whole fish...The tofu with shanghai green soup was filled with MSG. The rice with salted pork and vegetables was inconsistently flavored - my sister took a bowl, and it was tasteless; I took a bowl too, and it was extremely salty. This dish overall didn't have flavor - it was just salty and bland. The vegetable dishes we ordered also lacked flavor and were not very good. In addition, portions were very small here. We ordered 6 dishes for 4 people and were barely full (and we definitely as a family don't eat a lot.) \n\nThe final strike was when my parents asked if there was dessert. Usually Chinese restaurants serve complimentary dessert (like red bean soup or fruit.) This restaurant didn't. Only after my parents persisted about the dessert, that the waiter brought out some red bean filled pastries.\n\nI'm not sure if my family didn't like this restaurant because we are from Guangdong region and this is Shanghai food.

Besides the won ton in supreme broth I ordered pork in ginger and garlic sauce and chicken with plum sauce. I didn't recognize whatever was floating in the broth so didn't even try it. I tried one won ton and tossed the rest. Inside was a mixture of ground pork and maybe spinach with absolutely no flavor at all. These definitely were not the flavorful won ton I long for. \n\nThe first bite of the pork dish had me more excited. The sauce was delicious, so it was a real let down when the meat turned out to be tough and dry. Some meat with a little fat on it would have elevated this to fabulous. Don't be afraid of fatty meat. The fats where the flavor, juiciness and tenderness resides. With different meat I'd order again and again. \n\nThe chicken dish was unfortunately dry as well with over cooked nuggets of thigh meat and too little sauce to bring some life to the dish. It's too bad because the flavor is there it just needs more care and more sauce. \n\nI would probably give this another try and see if they can cook without incinerating the protein.", "author": "Gail N."}

Such a pretty presentation all self contained and wrapped in a ball of goodness...sorry getting off topic.\n\nBraised Pork Shank was impressive looking if you look at the photo a previous Yelper posted. The waiter help get a spoon to break apart the meat off the bone so it would be easier for us to eat. It was good and well cooked with a nice dark brown soy sauce over it. \n\nThe Mongolian beef, I believe this dish was spicy, but meat was tender. So if you want some heat to your food, you will enjoy this dish. I had to grab water!\n\nDried Mushrooms with shanghai green vegetables was what I order and I enjoyed it, cooked to perfection and great combo ingredients. Yummy in my tummy! \n\nI don't recall the exact name, but we also had a boneless chicken with ginger oil. It was a small dish where everyone got a bite. It was ok and dish didn't really stand out with flavor. Just normal.\n\nWe had a spare rib dish, which I was not used to seeing in this presentation called Wu Xi Sparerib with red fermented soy bean sauce. I was not used to seeing the ribs in red sauce. But it is soy bean sauce on it which had good flavor. Interesting dish. \n\nI think I pretty much covered most of the dishes our table had that I could recall. The other half of my group ordered a cool looking deep fried fish dish. Presentation was really cool as you can see from the other Yelper's photos. \n\nThank you for reading if you got this far.

Being a Shanghainese restaurant, we went with some more traditional dishes, including their:\n\n* Shredded Turnip Cake - Not bad at all, although I'm accustomed to eating turnip cake that's a bit more finely shredded. And, strangely enough, their turnip cake actually has meat inside (not a bad thing, just, unexpected).\n\n* Noodles with Fried Green Onion Oil - Probably the best part of the meal, these were simple, greasy, and quite tasty.\n\n* Xiao Long Bao - I'm starting to see a trend with most of the XLB I've had in SF: they're all a little too sweet, and Old Shanghai's was no exception. Their dumpling skin is also a bit on the too-thick side, but, hey, at least they're nice and soupy.\n\n* Sauteed Pea Sprouts - Not bad, but much more expensive and tougher than pea sprouts should be.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A spacious enough restaurant that accessibility shouldn't be an issue.\n\nBathroom - Didn't check them out.", "author": "Johnny W."}

One thing that stands out is the staff is very polite and well mannered. I've been to some 5 star Chinese restaurant & bad manners or impoliteness is a real mood killer. They take the time to listen as opposed to talking. Not a big restaurant, medium size. So noise level don't echo like some of these big restaurants. Of course like any restaurant once the big tables get filled & people are laughing, enjoying their meals then the noise is inevitable. Happy sounds as opposed to clanging dishes or staff disputes ......... Thank You David & your wonderful staff.  Still good so don't move or do any big changes.  I'm not ready to let you go yet ........ I also love all of the pictures of my Shanghai girlfriends on the wall .... gives me something to look at when I'm bored or other than my wife. LOL!

The xiao long baos, I wish were more soupy. I've had better in SoCal. The dumplings were plump and delicious. I really didn't like the green onion pancake. It was a little thicker, so it was more breadlike. I prefer ones that are more crispy. The green onion pancake was about a 3, and the rest of  food was about a 4, so 3.5 stars.", "author": "Arnold W."}

The wait staff were really nice. The food was absolutely delicious!! We had Mongolian beef and beef fried rice, which was a phenomenal option. I also had a small serving of wonton soup, which was good but not the type of wonton I'm used to ( I think they include seaweed in them) but still tasty. I would def go back to this place the next time I visit San Fran and in the mood for good sit down Chinese Food.", "author": "Katherine R."}

The xiao lung bao are delicious, but they also have excellent sweet sticky rice dumplings, boiled jiaozi, and the best vegetarian dumplings in the city. I love their salty dou jiang (soybean soup) with you tiao...have to have it.  If you don't know what to order, the owner will help you with good recommendations.

We got the Yang Zhou fried rice, xiao long baos, chow mein, and noodle soup. The prices for the dishes range from $10-12 each plate. The dumplings were $7.50 for 8 of them. The fried rice was a little bland but not bad. The Xiao Long Baos were nice and hot. The chow mein was a little bit dry, but maybe that's just how it is. The food came out pretty quickly and there were only two people running the whole restaurant. I would say the reason it is only 3 1/2 is that the food is pricey. There are some alternative restaurants with the same food but much cheaper nearby. It was also pretty chilly in there.", "author": "Jordan W."}

This place is alot cleaner than the other shanghai restaurants that I have gone to. However, the prices did not justify the taste of the food. I thought the XLB wrapper was too thick and my mom complained it wasn't as good as Shanghai Dumpling King. The place gets packed with tour buses from Hong Kong or Shanghai , which help fill up the restaurant. Service was quick even though the restaurant was completely filled which gives them a plus star. But ill probably stick to shanghai dumpling king for my XLB.", "author": "Jason L."}

Needless to say... this a definately a restaurant that must try!!!!\n\nI had such a wonderful diner with friends tonite.  Old Shanghai was recently renovated since early August 2012 and now the two stories restaurant have a room on the 2nd floor for private party.  It's not a typical chinese restaurant in the city but it's a local's jewel.  The place is clean and tidy, people there are nice and sincerely, and the owner is friendly to povide good recommendation to suit your dining preference.  They've authentic Shanghainese food, yet without the heavy seasoning and greasy feel.  Food is delicious and delightful.  They have wide varities of shanghainese appetizers & dishes: my favorite is the \"Smoked Fish\" and \"Pig Ears\" (if you know what I'm talking abt), authentic \"Xiao Long Bao\" are delicious and juicy, \"Crystal Shrimp\" and \"Sour Fish\" are favorable, \"Vegetable Clay Pot Rice\" is refreshing, and a perfect ending will be to have the \"Rice Ball Sweet Soup\" for dessert.  The food we had tonight were so good that we can't wait another minute to finish picture taking, but immediatly pickup our chopsticks to eat!!!  I'm a big fans of Shanghainese food, however, the bayarea does't have much of such type restaurants really consider \"Good\"!!! This is the very \"Best\" one in the bayarea and I'd recommend everyone to go try!!! The owner/chef are very flexible and they're willing to take special request on the menu, given that you let them know what your preference ahead of time (Give them a call).  I'll definately bring friends, families and colleagues to dine there again!!!! Thank you for the YUMMY FOOD!!!!", "author": "Vickie C."}

If I could give it zero stars I would and grudgingly giving in 1 star.\nService:\nFirst, we had made a reservation and when we arrived, they had to clear a table for us.  So much for making a reservation!  After we finally got seated, it took easily 15 - 20 minutes for someone to take our order.  \nFood:\nMultiple issues here.  First, everything was extremely bland.  I guess they don't believe in seasoning their food and they certainly don't taste it before it comes out of the kitchen.  Secondly, they are really stingy in ingredients.  We ordered pickled greens with pork noodle soup and we couldn't find the pork.  We ordered Shanghai Wonton soup and the wontons had only a fleck of meat in them.  We ordered Fried Rice in a clay pot and it was a ridiculously small portion for $10 and this one also didn't have much in ingredients.  We ordered the Xiao Lung Bao (soup dumplings) and they were small, no soup inside the dumplings and expensive.  An order of 6 for $12.  Most other restaurants are 6 for $5.   Basically, the whole meal was carb overload because all we ate was noodle and rice.  No protein.  Totally disappointing meal and we vowed never to go back.", "author": "Harlan C."}

I had really high expectation, not only because of the high rating but the name 'Shanghai' should imply that they can make Xiao Long Bao better than other Chinese restaurant? After all it's Shanghai's specialty. The pork XLB was no better than other places in the neighbourhood, the crab one was exactly like pork. I couldn't taste crab flavour at all. I had good crab xiao long bao before back in China, and it was out of this world. This place though, failed terribly at their own specialty food. The sauce was bleh. Pan fried savory pancakes were rather oily. Worst of all, my favorite drunken chicken was simply boiled chicken with PURE cooking wine pure over it! If you're going to make it like that I could have make it at home! Good drunken chicken should rid of the bitterness of the wine and bring out the flavour of chicken, but the bitterness of their wine overpower everything ): Sadly I didn't like anything about this place except the nice, clean place and quick, friendly service. I'm giving an extra star because of it", "author": "Bobo V."}
