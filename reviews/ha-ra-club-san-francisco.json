Many years ago I walked in with a internet date.   Rick behind the bar greeted me and somehow psychically knew my name.  We had never met before but he straight up guessed my full name.   He then quietly & solemnly took me aside when my date used the bathroom to tell me that my date had herpes.  My date was from another state, had only moved to SF days before & was quite squeaky clean vanilla, and there was no way he could have known him, but Rick told me he just knew and wanted to warn me.  Rick was captivating and fun.  I always dug his stories about growing up in the bar, his family's history, SFs history, and the buildings history. The place is just soaking in stories, very vibey. \n\nI would then run into Rick all the time in the TL over the next few years, and we would always have these great momentary transcendental conversations.  The last time I saw him, he was phasing out of bar scene and I figured the place would be sold, and hipped the hell up to some Disneyland idea of what millennials like, so I avoided going back. \n\nUntil this weekend!  I was pleasantly surprised to feel the same charm and history I always felt at this TL hole.  Now there are just some sweet upgrades (nice tvs, beer keg tap tables), a little less crusty & more modern.  I love that the walls are still gushing with history, hate, love, laughing, fucking, fighting, its all still there.  Still the best Tenderloin Bar.", "author": "Chelsey G."}

(Cue the dreamy \"flashback-sequence\" effect used for exposition in the 1980's and 1990's...)\n\nHa-Ra Club was the gritty survivor.  The echos stirred at this little way-past-its-prime lounge on Geary.  I liked going there and experiencing the post-modern impending demise of the last gasp of its era.  The bartender, while not your average guy, was a hell of a gentleman who had a lot of worldly wisdom.  Those who dwained to dwell in \"old\" Ha-Ra's environs were for real.  You knew it wouldn't last.  It effectively closed a while ago.  In my mind, this one was buried and dead.  (Finger.  No pulse.  ... He's dead, Jim.)  \n\n(Flash Forward - Fade into a man walking down Geary on his way to a farmers market.)\n\n10:30am, Temperature:  62.7 Degrees.  Purpose:  I'm on the way to the Fillmore Farmers Mar.... ....  ... (scratch) ... IS HA-RA BACK OPEN?!?! \n\nI wondered in.  And, my jaw dropped.  Dropped.  This place has been redone in a big way.  Then, I was blown away the more I hung out and talked to the folks.  They blew this remodel away.  I cannot believe how good a job they did off maintaining the original character of the bar while enhancing it into a modern setting.  Seeing the \"old bar\" and the \"new bar\" is something.  I loved the nostalgia, but to see a place that is above-average to begin with is quite a juxtaposition.  They opened up the area over the bar and it feels much more spacious.  The bar and behind the bar are the same as always.  The pool area is essentially the same with the addition of high-tops.  But, while retaining these classic elements, they did it up and it is beautiful.  I'd like to know if they used a professional designer - this was well done and someone deserves some props.  \n\nThere should be a part of me that wishes the old place didn't change, but I don't feel that way.  I think this has the potential to be a heck of a bar.  They did a great job.  And, it does stand-out against the back-drop of the neighborhood bars.  It'll be interesting to see how this place goes moving forward, but they have a foundation of a 60+ year-old bar that has a lot of good vibes.", "author": "Adam S."}

A number of reasons, not the least of which being that when you go there, right about when you are wondering if you are in the right place - you are just about there...\n\nThree experienced SF bar proprietors (with at least one a local legend) brought this one-time nightspot of wrestler HAnk Hanastead and boxer RAlph Figari, as well as a former brothel, back to its old glory: vintage photos, original ceiling, red-velvet wallpaper, and all (see - a pro wrestler, prizefighter, and a former brothel - three more reasons this place is cool).\n\nIt is on a stretch of Geary Street in the Tenderloin (regardless of what the realtors and rental agents tell you) that is still a block or two from a lot of the gentrification that has happened in the area. So get there now if that's your draw, because given how things are going in The City the 800 block of Geary will be tamed soon as well...\n\nHa-Ra oozes character and stories, which whoever is behind the bar will generally share if they're not too busy. The crowd can be 'interesting' depending on when you're there, it's a great place to catch a game or a drink before heading home. They have a good selection of liquor and beer, and know their cocktails...\n\nI read the Yelp complaints about the pricing, honestly not sure what people expect in SF when here. SF and the Bay Area are not an inexpensive place to eat or drink practically anywhere anymore, I don't see Ha-Ra as being any different better or worse in that regard. It's a great go-to spot for a change of pace, and it's been a sure-fire fun night every time I've been there so far.", "author": "Arthur S."}

A sneer. \"You can't believe everything you read on the Internet!\" says the barkeep. \n\nHe's the lone man on the staff, and on his days off (Sundays and Mondays) the bar is closed. Maybe that's how the hints of the Ha Ra's demise began.

Cheap tables suitable only for a dive or a low budget cafeteria. Cheap beer, PBR included (much appreciated as always). Pool table in the corner an obvious must.\n\nPeople bitch about the crabby bartender but so what? He's like that to EVERYbody. Chill out, it's only offensive if he's being selective. Would you get pissy if a deaf person wasn't listening to you? Of course not, they're not listening to anyone. Same with the bartender, deal with it. He was asked about happy hour and his reply was \"Not here. When I'm working it's unhappy hour.\" Well said good sir, I salute you for your honesty.\n\nLots of \"dive bars\" in SF try too hard. That defeats the purpose, if you're going to invest time and effort into a bar why on Earth would you work to make it look uncared for? A true dive just ends up that way, like Ha-Ra. They have booze, they have chairs, and they have more booze. All you need, case closed.", "author": "Justin N."}

He's a straight shooter who isn't afraid to tell you to \"fuck off\" if you're acting like an asshole and he'll always steer you in the right direction when it comes to your drink order. If he doesn't like it, he'll tell you, \"it's crap!\" If he approves, chances are he'll crack open a beer of his own and stop what he's doing to tell you some dirty jokes. Without him, I don't think there would even be a reason to visit.\n\nDon't expect a fancy library of malt whiskeys, fine scotch or trendy vodkas... head in expecting to drink well cocktails and Miller High Life (served in champagne glasses, on request).

He says to our crew, \"You guys better be drinking Budwiser's or shots because the taps are all dead.\" After hearing this myself and the three other chaps I was with kinda glanced at each other with the same thought in our mind \"Do we really want to do this?\" I'm so glad we did!\n\nWe sat and our bartender extraordinaire (Carl) was able to extend the drink menu and rustled up some Miller High Life's from the back for our drinking pleasure. Of course we had to request the appropriate glassware for the 'champagne of beers'. Even though Carl made sure to call us several derogatory names, sure enough he obliged the odd request.  \n\nAbout an hour after what was supposed to be a one and done beer visit, all three of us were now the only patrons left in the bar 2 shots and 2 'champagnes'  each deeper. \n\nWhy you ask? Carl! He's like my cranky old grandfather only way funnier. He told us dirty jokes, ripped on each and every one of us, and swigged shots of Cuervo every 10 minutes. Even when we decided to leave and go next door he closed up the bar early to have a beer with us there. I don't even remember the name of the next place we went because the Ha-Ra was that good. \n\nBeware of what your getting yourself into. If you want clean glasses, a working restroom, and an attractive crowd the Ha-Ra probably isn't for you.

But Ha-Ra does have an interesting history in itself.  Started by Harry and Ralph.  Ask Carl to show you the bullet hole in the ceiling for starters :)\n\nNow if you're looking for a Hanger 1 Martini, or a Mojito, or some other fancy drink, this place isn't for you. If you're looking for a hipster/trendy bar, look elsewhere.  If you want a live DJ and a dance floor, keep looking.  If you're offended easy by a dirty joke and a sarcastic sense of humor, PLEASE DON'T GO THERE!\n\nHowever, if you want a decent selection of beer, past your typical Bud/Miller selection, for a reasonable price then this is your place.

If you want a shot of whiskey, or tequila, with your beer you've come to the right place.

I could see how that might be true, but if your mileage may vary, he couldn't have been cooler when we popped in. Of course the fact that many of us (including Carl) were about three quarters in the bag and were encouraging of his litany of jokes no doubt helped us fit in a little. Regardless, in a pinch?

I stopped in here yesterday afternoon to take a break from passing out flyers in the neighborhood for my FUNDAYS MUNDAYS event @800 LARKIN. I had a Samuel Adams from the tap. The bar appeared to have a few of its regulars in there and a very nice and helpful bartender (an older 40s or 50s blond woman) seemed to know them very well and treat them like family.

Other than that, it's quite the dive right on the Tender-Nob that is Geary St. Just sit there and take it all in...you're in for an experience.", "author": "Michael B."}

This was stop number 2, just after the nearby Endinburgh Castle pub, on my birthday crawl. It didn't smell, had good drinks and few people- which was good for it's size. Overall it's a great, low-key dive bar to hang out in. HA RA!", "author": "Cassy R."}

Knowing our past seasoned knowledge of dive bars and fun times we found ourselves in the TL. Also we found ourselves at the Ha-Ra!! Ha-Ra!!! The bartender was RAD!! I could tell he had been in the business for a while knowing the style of old fashion drinks I order. Its hard ordering from someone who isn't skilled in their profession. Anyhow I also appreciate the fact he could handle this lame patron who obviously was visiting the city without style! Thank you bar mate!! I think your name was Casey or Kevin Oopps! Sorry don't recall. Anyhow, you were fun with style and class!!", "author": "sarah k."}

I had my credit card in my hand completely visible the entire time i sat at the bar(few minutes because it was busy) I ordered a beer, card still in hand, the bartender poored it, and i went to hand her my card and she said cash only, WHY didnt she bring it up when she saw the card? blind? I told her I couldn't pay (its 2012 really lets get a card machine why don't we) and she gave me a REALLY hard time when I told her I couldn't pay, even after I apologized and didn't even SIP my beverage. I'm sorry but she should have mentioned as she saw my card on the bar waiting to hand her before I paid. They have an atm machine but it would not take my card, I had to borrow cash from a friend. The situation would have been more bearable if the bar tender wasn't a complete bitch about it. We all have bad days, I think she could have been a little nicer considering i was polite and up front off the bat. I payed her the cash when I got it 20 minutes later, didn't even touch my beer and left. Will not be going back.", "author": "Erin L."}

He will cuss at you for playing the Hollies, Carrianne. (sorry i like that song, and the hollies for that matter). The place is just a block away from the GAMH, to meets your peeps before the show.

So, first of all, I hung out here tonight with our newly minted Seattle Yelp Community Manager, Katie, and this is by far the best Wednesday night I've had in awhile. So, after dinner at Red Box we decided to grab a few beers and talk some shop. It was pretty much dead in here save an old man with a dragon cane, a gash on his head and one black glove and a couple (?) at the end of the bar plugging money into the juke. We were chatting it up with Carl, our gracious bartender giving us obviously watered down tequila shots whilst telling us Monica Lewinsky and Michael Jackson jokes. Carl would take a minute to bark at the old man at the end of the bar and take breaks to flirt with my companion. Katie rolled with the punches and even talked about Seattle bars he almost worked in with him. The heavily tatttooed man at the end of the bar surprised me by spouting his love for KC and The Sunshine Band and even reminisced about one of the great concerts of theirs he saw. This guy going to see The Sunshine Band was about as foreign as me at a hip hop show. Soon it was just the two of us in the bar rocking out to Patsy Cline and watching a random woman come in to use the bathroom while Carl gave us his mixed up Viagra/Ex Lax jokes (he didn't know if he was coming or going... badaboom!) I've been here before shows at the GAMH, but those nights don't hold a candle to tonight, and even though Carl said he didn't give a shit if I come back (he took quite a shine to Katie) I'll definitely be back here much more often even though my experience won't be nearly as fun as this night was...", "author": "Michael E."}

This bar is a god sent to any one who hates the fru fru cocktail lounges of the big city life. My husband frequented this bar a couple nights a week after work while we were dating. He had told me all about Carl and Jerry and how I needed to come have drinks with him as soon as I turned 21. So my first bar  was the Ha Ra Club. It has all the warmth of an ice cold beer and smells like sweaty cab drivers. I love that its dark and dank. I love the history behind it and the fact that every one for the most part is a regular. I like to go into my bars and not have to say my drink a thousand time to 4 different people. I like knowing that when I get off work I can go into a place and my drink will be ready for me as soon as the bartender sees my face. It is very true that this bar does not have a good boos selection and a Cocktail Nazi but I love Carl and my needs are simple. It is not a bar for the social scene it is a bar to go have a drink, watch sports, maybe play pool, and maybe shoot the shit with the drunks. The Ha Ra  is the anti cocktail lounge and that is something that I find charming.", "author": "Nichole S."}
