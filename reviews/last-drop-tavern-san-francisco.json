After we split the bill, I realized the sister didn't pay because she was going to \"pay her sister later\". Which was fine but that meant that I paid for her portion. I knew it wasn't right, but I also didn't want to pay for her portion and tip the server, otherwise I would feel taken for a fool. So I didn't tip. I planned on making it up to the server at another time since the bar is by my office. \n\nHOWEVER, the server had the audacity to come up to me, tap me on the shoulder and say \"sir if you can't afford to come out, don't come out at all!\" Excuse me? He also told my co worker that I was \"marked\" the next time I came in, whatever that meant. The server didn't know what was going on, but he had the balls to disrespect like that. \n\nA few days later, I noticed on my credit card statement that the server gave himself a $10 tip. I called my credit card who refunded my $$. I was surprised but not that surprised that a ghetto server would tip himself without my consent. \n\nMy friends who are servers and bartenders said it sucks when they don't get tips, but they don't know the other side so they just keep working and it's not a big deal. After all there will be more tips. \n\nAnyway, keep in mind if you don't tip to however the servers like, they'll tip themselves and publicly shame you. Which is absolutely ridiculous because my value to them would have been much more over time and it wasn't worth fighting over. But it's downtown San Francisco and there's plenty of other bars to choose from. \n\nI'd say skip this place.", "author": "Lucas M."}

It's a little hidden and dark on the inside, with castle-like decor.\n\nBecause I took myself on a date, I sat at the bar so as not to take a table from someone else. There are TVs behind the bar anyway, so I just watched soccer and enjoyed the peace and quiet. There was an awesome happy hour special - $5 for a margarita! I had 2. I also got the baja fish tacos (3 for $9) and the chips and guacamole ($5). The food was so delicious, tacos covered in savory sauce, and the guacamole was really fresh. My marg was strong but not bitter, nor did I struggle by ANY means to drink them both down. Took my food maybe 10 minutes tops to get to me.\n\nThe bartender who was taking care of me was super nice, and attentive that he was not too in my face, but also didn't make me feel like I was forgotten.

Went here on the recommendation of yelp after some shopping, and was impressed. The happy hour has discounted beer, wine, and appetizers (some of which can stand in as a main, i.e. the fish tacos), allowing you to get a fun late lunch/early dinner in with drinks for a very affordable price. \n\nOver the course of our visits here we've tried most of the happy hour offerings. The top pickings: the fries (thick cut and served with a spicy aioli) and the fish tacos (very good and an amazing deal for the portion size). The boyfriend also liked the wings (they were just barely edged out by the fish tacos because of the portions) and the deviled eggs. The artichoke dip was a little too salty for my tastes, but my friends really enjoyed it. The guacamole was the only thing that really fell short (just not as flavorful as most). \n\nAlthough it isn't on the happy hour menu, we also had to try the mac n cheese. Best decision of the meal. First nicety: it comes inherently vegetarian with the option to add different meats for an additional small charge. I hate removing meat for dishes to make them vegetarian--the dish is relying on the meat for flavor and I'm paying for meat I'm not getting--so this set up was a welcome change. But the best part was the cheesiness! Lifting a forkful, you could see the cheese strings stretch to keep your bite attached to the rest of the bowl. It was mac n cheese heaven; you must try this!\n\nWe've always been served by a waitress with light blonde hair, though I've yet to get her name. She's always very nice, and the perfect amount of attentive without being overbearing. She also patiently helped us pick beers which the boyfriend and I are still learning to do (we're wine people).\n\nCome check this place out!!", "author": "Cara W."}

A tourist couple was the only other customer there enjoying their drinks. The bar tender was super attentive, even after the place got pretty packed around 4 p.m. I think our bar tender's name was Anya (that was the name on the receipt), and all her cocktails were on point -- taste and alcohol.

Surprisingly, there was still plenty of seating with patronage that were a lot tamer. We ordered a mix of HH items and an item off the regular menu. \n\nGuac & Chips: Pretty standard. They seemed like store bought chips, and the guac was lacking that avocado flavor. Can't complain for $5. \nFish Tacos (3): Battered fish on top of little street sized tortillas. A little too saucy for my taste (it was dripping out the sides and on the verge of making the batter soggy), but pretty good flavor. Fish was fried nicely. \nCesar Salad: Good salad...fresh romaine pieces with a good amount of Parmesan slices on top. Slices of baguette croutons laid on the side. Good dressing to salad ratio too, considering it was premixed. \n\nGood place to relax and watch a game without the crowd. Food is pretty good for bar food and for the price. Waitresses were attentive too and didn't snub us when we could't make a decision and sent her back a few times (sorry!).", "author": "Michelle C."}

I checked online for bars near the hotel, and found the positive reviews for the Last Drop Tavern.  This place is right around the corner and about a block and a half down Powell Street from three big hotels...The Stanford Court, the Mark Hopkins, and the Fairmont.  It's an easy walk downhill...coming back up a little more challenging!  We had a great time at this little bar.\n\nFirst, the people are extremely friendly, both customers and staff.  It's a combination of tourists and locals, but everyone is treated great.  There is a good beer selection on tap and bottle, a fully stocked bar with a nice cocktail menu (Moscow Mule was excellent), and plenty of TV's to allow for a good view of sports wherever you are sitting.  This really isn't a sports bar so to speak, more like a neighborhood tavern that has the games on.  The food menu features a good selection of typical bar bites to full plates, and everything we had (wings, fresh cut french fries, penne pasta with alfredo, steak/chicken fajitas) tasted fresh and was well prepared.  We were extremely satisfied with our drinks, the great service, the fun atmosphere, and the overall experience.\n\nI would definitely recommend the Last Drop if you are staying on Nob Hill or near Union Square.", "author": "David S."}

It's hard to find a bar that you can also eat at [safely] when you have celiac.  But guess what?  YOU CAN HERE! \n\nWe initially walked in because I saw that they served tacos (on corn tortillas) and I thought, \"hey, that sounds good, and tacos are usually safe, so why not.\"  So right off the bat I ordered a margarita and it was reminiscent of what my friend serves at his bar-- he literally owns the place-- in San Diego, and he makes a mean margarita, my friends.  Then I saw fajitas on the menu and I ordered that instead, with chicken.  The fajitas were hot 'n juicy.  It came with corn tortillas, rice, and pinto beans, and gosh durnit, if I didn't lick that plate clean you can call me Sally.  [to be clear, my name is not Sally]  Ok, so the fajitas aren't anything earth-shattering.  It doesn't have exceptionally unique flavors that make it \"sing,\" or anything like that, but it was good, comforting, nourishing, yummy food and I enjoyed every bite.  (and didn't have a lick of indigestion, let alone any celiac symptoms:)  Delicious food, safe for a celiac...at a bar! :D \n\nFor the non-celiac folk:  my sister had a chicken caesar salad, fries, and a screwdriver, and she enjoyed everything she consumed as well.  (I have to say, that salad and fries looked very good, but luckily I wasn't having any food envy with what was in front of me!)\n\nThe kicker is the fact that this is a cool, chill, comfy, down to earth joint, with really warm and friendly staff.  I'm an East Bay girl, but if I'm ever in Union Square again (a high likelihood, to be sure) I will totally hit this place up again.  GO HERE!  And order some Mexican food with your cocktail-- you won't regret it, fellow celiacs:)\n\nThank you, Last Drop Tavern, for the great food, service, and atmosphere!  I look forward to many happy returns.", "author": "Teenie J."}

It was a seat yourself place and within 5 minutes we met 3 people - likely the manager (older gent), the bartender, and our waitress.  All were very short, rude, and not friendly - almost like they were doing us a favor. We ordered drinks and received menus.  We could not get a recommendation out of anyone, so we started with grill cheese dippers for our appetizer - they were good!  Then ordered fish and chips and California sliders for our entrees.  Both were average at best. Also to tell you the type of place you are dealing with - they charged one of us for a soda refill. Beers were cold and as you know hard to screw up  Guinness!

Beef sliders were some of the tastiest I've ever had. Not over cooked and super flavorful. Boyfriend said his grilled cheese bites were absolutely awesome with the multiple cheeses and bacon. He also really liked the \"tomato soup\" because it wasn't your traditional soup (which he isn't a fan of). He said it more tasted like a tomato sauce of some kind. The garlic fries were outstanding. The fries were super crispy but not even the slightest bit burnt. The sauces they gave with them were on point too. We would definitely recommend!", "author": "Steph H."}

The manager confrontationally standing over me sneering and demanding I taste a second pour of skunked Stella after my husband and I both tasted my drink and found it lacking didn't change my opinion of its skunkiness. \n\nThe cherry on top of this sadsack service sundae was the manager loudly and rather rudely demanding to know if I still wanted it or not after forcing me to taste it in front of him and stomping away without a word when (obviously) I said no.\n\nThankfully there was a boisterous gaggle of Brits next booth over drinking Guinness, which prompted me to switch over to that dark beer lover of my youth. I doubt they would have put up with putrid Guinness, so I was happy to have that vote of confidence.\n\nThe Last Drop as a bar is small but pretty. The place actually smelled nice, and had a surprising surplus of antlers on the wall. Weird sort of haphazard seating warranted by a small and oddly shaped interior, it came off as cozy and comfortable.\n\nThe bacon deviled eggs were basic deviled eggs with a pinch of bacon and scallions on them. Nice enough, but we expected something a little more interesting, maybe bacon-wrapped? The street tacos had some kick from the salsa, and good cilantro coverage. The guacamole and chips were nothing special, bland with cheap bulk chips. Overall a decent middle of the road experience marred only by the tantrum from management.\n\n(Oh and FYI - I've had to send a beer back a total of 2 times in the past decade, this being the second. Check your draft lines for contamination guys!)", "author": "Emily H."}

Funnily enough, the bartender (possibly owner?) and the guy sitting next to my dad all shared the same name! In any case, the bartender helped us take a picture outside with Powell Street in the background, and then offered to us to come inside to have a drink. After finding out about the special day, he gave the birthday boy a glass of whiskey to celebrate, and then served us up our drinks. We maintained pleasant conversation the entire time, and the entire experience was quite enjoyable! We didn't order any food since we were only there for 20 minutes or so, but I can say the drink selection was extensive and expensive. Many of the drinks were 7 or 8 dollars. \n\nBesides the expensive drinks, everything else was good. The environment was really well-decorated and had a great British feel to it. The service was prompt and courteous, and the bartender engaged in friendly conversation and practically brought us in off the street. It was nice! I'd definitely recommend the Last Drop Tavern to friends.", "author": "John B."}

She messed up my sister's order, giving her sweet potato fries instead of normal fries.

Really nice guy and easy going to talk to. Once I got seated, he offered to remove my coat for me! \n\nOn the tables, they only have the HH menu, cocktails, wine, beer and small plates and bites. If you're looking for a meal definitely check out Yelp and other Yelp reviews on what to order. We got the HH chicken wings and the clams (which come in a soup base and bread on the side). \n\nDrinks - blood orange margarita for me and my boyfriend got a stout beer. Was definitely good, but I'm a gal who likes well blended and mixed drinks, so I'm open to try other drinks when I come back! \n\nI recommend this place if you're near union square or by downtown.

I came in and the hostess welcomed me immediately and I sat at the bar. \n\nThe second I sat down I was treated like a king. I was talking with the bartender about what beers were good, they had just gotten, and her recommendation. Drank a great North Coast brew while wondering what I wanted to order. In the meantime, an older gentleman (who I'm assuming was either the owner or manager on duty) had come up to me and asked if I needed anything. \n\nI ordered the fish tacos and some sweet potato fries (my muse) and had them in front of me in next to no time at all. Prior to that I had finished my beer and the owner/manager had instantly got back to me and asked if I wanted something else. I ordered an old fashioned cocktail and it was pretty good compared to the others I've had and it was probably the best priced one for what I got too. The fish tacos were great, the filets were large compared to the tortilla but who complains about too much meat? The fries were excellent also.\n\nAfter finishing my dinner and my old fashioned, the owner/manager again came up to me almost immediately and wanted to know if i'd like another. We checked my tab so I was sure I had the funds and I asked for his recommendation. He actually recommended their blood orange margarita which was hella good.

I tell our server, she replies well I eat this every week and it is always fine. Then she smells it and asks me if I had tried it. Why so i could get food poisoning, no thanks. I asked her if she could just get me a salad instead and she replies, sorry the kitchen is backed up. Then we ask for the manager and the manager was also very defensive and rude.

However, I was in Union Square looking for someplace to eat and Yelp recommended this place. It was about 1:30 on a Friday afternoon, but the place was quiet except for 3 or 4 other people. I got the sense this is the kind of place that could fill up around dinner time or during special events, though. There were a couple of tvs on the walls but they didn't detract from the atmosphere. I sat at the bar. The bartender, Shibli, was easygoing, soft-spoken and friendly. I ordered the fish and chips with a lagunitas IPA - absolutely fabulous, not too greasy, good tartar sauce, and I thought the little corked glass pitcher of vinegar Shibli pulled from behind the bar was a nice touch, rather than just a \"help yourself\" bottle already on the counter. Very good beer selection, and even a nice range of cocktails.

I grew up working in restaurants and eat out quite often. I appreciate good service and have never been treated so rudely as we were treated when we went to The Last Drop Tavern. My wife and I spent the weekend in San Francisco with 2 other couples a few days ago. When the 6 of us entered the bar, we were the only ones in there. I thought it was odd that the place was empty and we soon learned why... \nWe ordered appetizers and a drink and proceeded to chat amongst ourselves in a reasonable and normal tone. We ordered another round and then ordered entrees. The appetizers were humorously small and lacked flavor.\nThere was a very serious looking gentleman watching our table like a hawk. We asked the waitress (who was very nice) if the gentleman was the owner. She shook her head and sort of chuckled. No, he is the Manager, she said.\nHe continued to watch our table with a menacing look.\nThe Manager soon approached our table and, to our disbelief, asked us to quiet down or he was going to kick us out. We are all approaching 50 years old and are business owners/executives. We thought that he was kidding at first but he told us that he was definitely not kidding. \nWe were astonished and genuinely bewildered. He then asked us to leave so we did.    \nI never go to social media to vent because it can be so damaging to a business but felt strongly that I needed to let others know how rude and unprofessional that the Manager is.

Happy hour was a special bonus, as draft beers were only $5. However, we should have went with the $5 well whiskey. As it was my birthday, I decided to allow my girlfriends grandmother to treat me to a shot of Jameson Black. While delicious, at $15, it was between $5-$7 more than any other place I'd had it in a number of different states. That was the least of our worries. When it came time to check out, 5 minutes after giving her our card, she alerted us to the fact that the credit card machine was down and we could pay cash or wait 5-10 minutes. After 15 minutes, she informed us that there was an ATM outside if we didn't want to wait any longer. Of course, we weren't interested in paying an ATM fee on top of our already inflated bill. 20 minutes later, after running the card several times, they insisted that we did not have enough money in our account. Turns out, we did, and our card was charged twice for a grand total of $114.26. They then informed us that our account would not be credited the overcharged amount until the next day. Then they made us sign a permission slip giving them authority to recharge the card for the original amount. As a final gesture of good will, they said they were sorry and wished they could comp it. Don't let the lure of happy hour fool you, take your money and your debit card somewhere else. In closing, I will say they lived up to their name, as I left the \"last drop\" of my patience on the bar.", "author": "Pac N."}
