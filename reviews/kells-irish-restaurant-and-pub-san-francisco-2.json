I really hated the pub space. The walls were like probably 5 feet away from the bar itself. So you can imagine trying to squeeze into the crowd with the walls being so close to the bar. The bar was too small, too stuffy (no A/C at all), too dark, too loud, and you literally had no space to move or dance around. They played horrible music. My friend and I looked at each other and started laughing. We couldn't find our other friend so we decided to leave this terrible bar. There were so many bad vibes and it was such a disappointment.

When more people trickled in we decided to hit the dance floor where a strange variety of music was playing and a frisbee was being thrown around. The songs went from an EDM to a hip hop to a pop song and then back around. Very strange but at least they were dance-y.\n\nThe major buzz kill was when my friend and I went to the bar to get another round of shots. My friend wasn't being assisted by the bartender at all so I hopped in to help out. We made eye contact multiple times with the one bartender that was working but did not get served despite standing smack dab in the center. After about 15 min of this nonsense, I noticed that people who arrived later at the bar were being served right away. Then I noticed that all these customers being served before me were all white. \n\nUnderstaffed? Definitely. Racist? Hm, very probable. I know my friends were able to be served drinks earlier, but maybe there was a different bartender working at that time. All I know is that when other customers showed up, this bearded bartender made his unreasonable priorities pretty apparent. Needless to say we took our business elsewhere.", "author": "Addy Y."}

There is nothing Irish about it, at least on a Friday night. \n\nI stayed because I had friends that were there and I paid a cover because I'm a dude. Girls dont have to pay cover. So out of spite for all this bar stood for, I refused to buy any drinks the whole night although I desperately needed some for myself to deal with this pedicament I found myself in. \n\nThe music was just from  speakers and seems to have been curated from someones itunes list. The sound got loud then soft then loud again from song to song. And in between each song there was a 5 to 10 second pause that effectively killed any dance vibes that had been established. You can expect a mix of 90s rap and r&b and hip hop you kind of remember from 2006. A few karaoke classics at least where you could enjoy belting it out even if you weren't enjoying \"dancing\". Also the downstairs was small and crowded and I spent more time getting bumped and shoved by people going back and forth from upstairs than I spent actually dancing. \n\nThe drinks (that I was given) were average.

We wanted to have a couple drinks before heading to dinner and went to different places that were all conveniently closed. When we arrived to this bar, they had just opened and only had a handful of other patrons. \n\nInside, the bar is all dark wood and dim lighting. They already had Christmas decorations up (unless it always looks like that...). My biggest complaint is that the bathroom is downstairs. Truly, I do not like bathrooms at restaurants and bars that are in the bowels of the building (too many like them in Washington DC) so making the seeming long trek freaked me out a bit especially after a couple of drinks. The day before I watched a YouTube video of someone playing The Silent Hill (I think that's the name) jump scare game and...I KID YOU NOT...the hallway to the bathroom looked like the freaky game! Anyway, bathroom was clean so it was all good. \n\nService and drinks were fine. The bartender was a cute little lady that jumped up onto the bar to grab bottles high on the shelves. One minor complaint was they only carried ginger beer and not ginger ale, so our drinks tasted different. Took some getting used to.", "author": "Chas Y."}

I think that was the song that was playing when we walked in, and there were blonde chicks dancing on the chairs screaming \"I DON'T CARE!\" to the lyrics of the song haha.  The club was filled entirely with fun white people.  \n\nWhat also made it fun was the random songs they would incorporate throughout the night, like they had a salsa song, then 15 minutes later a country song, and later on an Irish song.

As you head to the back though, you'll feel the place get increasingly hotter, almost like a steam that heads to a downward stair-set. This  is where the biggest surprise was.

There was no Rob Lowe/Demi Moore moment with cheesy 80's music. \n\nThe story is quite funny. My wife was stuck at the bar with another work colleague. We were like 45 minutes late. It was Friday and about 5 of us were driving up from San Jose. When we walked in, I walked up to introduce myself. They were sitting at a giant round table with 6 chairs. I asked if anyone was sitting next to her. She sarcastically said \"Yes!\" I said, \"Okay! Sorry!\" And went to the opposite side of the table. One of the best moves I ever made. She hit me with sarcasm and I made a bold counter move, even though the seat was empty. It made her think! Hey wait it was like an 80's movie. \n\nIts a great Irish bar located on the edge of North Beach and that is where the Italians would want it...right on the edge. \n\nTypical bar food...like cheese sticks...I'm sure they are good but we will have to ask my wife... since she took the last one!  Another great story. I think she was making a counter move from across the table. Okay who am I kidding this was totally turning into an 80's movie...where boy meets girl. \n\nSundays are my typical night of grabbing some Italian food at my favorite places in North Beach.

I'm pretty open to fun places where there's lots of people and good music playing. Kells definitely delivered with the number of people (place was pretty packed). However, the music kind of sucked, and the drinks really weren't strong, but I've had worse.\n\nFor the dudes: If you're at least 6', love polos, and unabashedly listen to Bon Jovi when you party, then this is the bar for you. It's a pretty fratty bar, and there's definitely lots of pretty ladies to scoop up. If you're into typical 80s bar music and sorority girls, you'll love this place.\n\nFor the ladies: See above, as most of the dudes that frequent this place fit the above description. You'll dance when they bang out \"Livin on a Prayer,\" you'll be surrounded by tall dudes looking to take you home and never call you again. Or maybe at least get a second date out of it. You'll be up for some competition, so wear your best slutty outfit if you're looking to meet people. If you're looking for a relaxing night where dudes don't hit on you all night (myself included), then go somewhere else, or wear your favorite college hoodie out to the bar.\n\nOverall: the drinks are pretty weak, but they're not overly expensive (mind you, I live in Manhattan). The music is pretty mediocre (the night I was there, a cover band was playing Beastie Boys, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix, to name a few, which at first sounds awesome, but the singer did a pretty good job of destroying it. At least some people were into it.) The atmosphere was lively, though, so if you have a group, it actually might be a good place to go because it's loud and happening.

Big statement, right? Where I can understand that Kell's is not a place for everyone, I do think it is a place for anyone who wants to have a great time.\n\nA typical Kell's night would start with a friendly welcome greeting from the dashing doormen. OK- that might not be the case for everyone, and sure, guys do have to pay a $5 cover on Saturday nights, but it keeps out the riff-raff! Covers are typical in big cities and fun bars- it's not like they're robbing you blind like other places around town. \n\nKell's usually gets busiest after midnight, as the North Beach bar hoppers slowly make their way to the party. The crowd is a mixture of college aged co-eds, young professionals, foreigners and locals. You can meet a Silicon Valley techie, a couch surfing/hostel-staying Peruvian or your typical USF baseball playing d-bag, all in the same place. The music is great and adds to the general ambiance of Kell's- a hodgepodge of  80s favorites (Bon Jovi, Journey, Neil Diamond are typical), 90s&2000s classic top 40s (Ride Wit Me-Nelly, It's Britney Bitch, Rihanna all guaranteed) with your everyday Irish jig thrown in there somewhere. There is no DJ because this isn't a club, so if you're lookin for the hot 100, look elsewhere. (or request it downstairs, chances are, they'll have it!)\n\nThe drinks are stellar. Most notably, and my favorite, the Long Islands from the downstairs bartenders are always on point. Specialty drinks from the upstairs bartenders are also delicious. All the bartenders have heavy hands, as you can't really order a weak drink at Kell's. Where ever you get your drink, it will definitely quench your thirst and leave you a little tipsy, to say the least. \n\nOverall, the experience at Kell's is a fantastic one. Highly recommended for you and all your friends.", "author": "Amy B."}

I went last weekend with my sister from another mister and we had had a pretty good time. There are two separate floors for dancing. I would say the music was a mix of current top 40's mixed with classic songs from the 80's, 90's, and early 2000's. The night that we went there seemed to be a ridiculous amount of 5'8\" white guys and basic bitches acting like idiots on the first floor and then hooking up EVERYWHERE around 1am. The lower floor was a bit better,  it was less crowded and a more diverse group of people were hanging about. There are plenty of places to sit on both levels which is a plus for those of us rocking the 3 + inch heels. Ample parking in the side streets around the bar also got this place some points. Overall this place was okay, I would probably go here again as a warm up for the rest of the night, but it wouldn't be the focal point of the evening.", "author": "Adrina F."}

A total weakness of mine and my friends (and just about every other American girl don't lie). \n\nThe music was an eclectic but still enjoyable mix. Sweet Caroline played, and going to college in Boston made me fall in love with this bar and its music choice.

At one moment, my friends and I were chatting with some great females and at the next moment, I am getting raped on my tab.  \n\nLet me explain.  Before I left the bar, I went to sign my tab out at the front bar.  When my tab came, I noticed that it was much higher than I anticipated.  Now, normally I am not one to dispute with how much I am being charged and just pay the thing.  Tonight was different though.  \n\nI had noticed that I was being charged for more than twice the amount of drinks that I had purchased.   When I tried to ask the bartender (ass) about the charges he ignored me.  Not once but twice.  He continued to poor drinks and act like I didnt even exist.  When I finally got his attention again and showed him the receipt, his exact words were \"what do you want me to do about it\".  I told him there was a mistake and that there was no way that I bought the amount of drinks on the tab. He then proceeded to call me a liar and walked away.         - Great Service !\n\nThe end result - I will be getting way overcharged than I should have been.  Whats funny though about the situation is, I dont give a shit about the money. What I care about is my character being attacked by some punk ass bartender that  wont take the time to understand that he is serving me, a customer.\n\nBottom line - dont show this place the light of day.  They have lost my business and my friends business forever.

The bartenders switch the songs on their stupid cd player leaving awkward silent breaks in the music as well as absolutely no continuity.

I like it well enough but I have no desire to go to North Beach for a night out unless I'm with the girls from Sonoma County.  Because it's just easier that way.  \n\nMaybe I'll come back when I'm with the girls.  If there is dancing there later at night it probably is alot like my favorite bar in Petaluma, and provided there is no cover (which being a bar, it shouldn't) I would more than happy to check it out.  But my favorite bar in Petaluma is my favorite bar BECAUSE it is in Petaluma.  San Francisco is soo not Petaluma and if I have options, I'm going to take them.", "author": "Alexis B."}

Yeah at 31, I think I was older than most of the crowd but definitely not the oldest.  On a Friday night the dance floor downstairs was busy but you had room to move at least. The bar upstairs was busy, and people were having fun.  With that kind of environment even if you don't like the people how can you not have fun?  \n\nThe guys I was with, admittedly were \"those guys' the ones sticking their hands where they shouldn't be, picking girls up and tossing them on their shoulders and just being the wild and crazy drunk you always have to encounter when out at a packed bar.  And while I waited for some girl to scream bloody murder, it never happened while I was there, they just looked at my friend like the creepy pervert he was being, and sorta gracefully danced away from him.  \n\nAside from pretending not to be with the drunken idiots of the bar, I had fun.  Everyone was dancing, and just enjoying themselves.  And since I don't get out on a dance floor often (boyfriend hates it) the few times he is willing to dance with me, I take full advantage.  \n\nNot my favorite place by any means, but not bad either.  \n\nAny bar that has people is gonna be crowded, sticky and have beer spilling everywhere, it's just part of being out at a decent place.

I dropped my 5 on cover and D slid in on pure bday love. \n\nAnd we were greeted with what the D - who was born in, raised in, went to college in, and got his Master's in Madison Wisconsin - described as \"the whitest bar I've ever been in\". Seriously I thought I was about to be shipped out to Gitmo for sure... thank god I had to D with me, otherwise someone would have called Homeland Security on my ass. \n\nI'll give Kells credit - it does what it does really well - piles of fratty white guys and a lot of white girls of varying levels of attractiveness drunk to varying degrees. The bartender was fantastic - ruthlessly efficient, with a radar for who needs a drink when. I didn't have to wait more than a minute for a drink, even though the bar was packed to the gills and rowdy as hell. \n\nIt was a loud, boisterous frat party with lots of drinks and everyone having a great time, and I could imagine I would have no problems picking up a very cute little sorority girl here - were I white. Unfortunately, I ooze \"terrorist\" from every brown poer of my body, so instead I got the coldest shoulders I've seen since moving to the bay. \n\nOne star for great bartending and good parking, and one star to represent how fun this palce could be if I were as white as the D.\n\nEDIT: Ah... and one more thing to add... someone stole the D's jacket!

It is definitely a place where most people would walk in and say, \"I'm too old for this crap\". \nYes, maybe I should be one of those people, but I still need a little craziness after a long work week. \nYes, it smells like vomit in various corners, without fail, every single Friday and Saturday night. \nYes, my friends and I all say we are not, absolutely not going to Kells, for obvious reasons, then somehow end up there at about 12:30 after other bars and clubs being supper uppity and boring, or just filled with American douchbaggery. \nYes, maybe we only think it's great because we wait until 12:30 to go when we already drunk. \nYes, there are always a handful of creepy horny guys here, but don't you dare let them ruin your night. \nYes, sometimes we just want to dance it out to Katy Perry and sing at the top of our lungs to \"Here I go again\" and Journey! \nYes, the hostel in North Beach ends their pub-crawls here, so that always makes for some good craic. Other than that, we don't really notice the crowd much because we tend to make our own entertainment here. Going here with a good group of friends is a must. \n\nWhen we take people here who have never been, we warn them of these things. It's a crowded drunk fest. Just go with it or go home. We realize it is not for everyone. \n\nAnd for the record.... Sometimes we dance on the benches because it is by the only window in the whole place, so we not only have room to dance, but get some cool air too. It's not to show off our awesomeness. \n\nI am only giving it four stars to keep with the tradition my friends and I have about loving to hate Kells. We just need to accept it and say, though embarrassing, \"We love Kells\". Something amazing always happens either here, or in the post Kells debauchery when no one is ready for the party to stop. I just can't quite face the reality of this yet myself, so I can't give it five stars. I am still in denial of my secret love for Kells. \n\nP.S.

I hate the stuffy superficial atmosphere, not being able to move without bumping into at least ten people, and hearing the same terrible music remixed in slow motion. However I love Kells. Granted I've only been here twice but both experiences were great. For one thing the music here is fantastic. They play everything from the iconic \"Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy\" (which even non-country fans have to love) to the more modern Rihanna and of course Don't Stop Believing. The last time I was here they played 80s music on the downstairs floor for a good hour towards the end of the night. People here are much nicer then at many bars/clubs I've been to. It has a low key, friendly, completely unstuffy vibe and it just seems like everyone wants to have a good time (not like everyone has a 'hidden' hookup agenda). I love that it's light enough to be able to see people's faces and people in general. There are definitely people from all over here, even from places like Brazil. And I love that there are areas to sit down and chillax if you want to take a break and grab a drink. It gets crowded but not so crowded that you can't dance and generally people respect each other's space. I completely agree with what many people said about the 'college' vibe of this place. Basically at this point in my life there are many things I'd rather do with my saturday night then spend it at a club. But if I were to spend it at a club I would absolutely, hands down, choose to spend it at Kells. And end up having a damn good time.", "author": "Alla B."}

Kells has two dance floors, a large bar, and wonderfully CLEAN facilities. The bartenders are attentive and pour strong drinks at good prices. It's CROWDED, so be prepared to get up close and personal with the rest of the bar. The scene feels like a \"college frat party\" - lots of collared shirts dancing to the Top 40's/pop hits. For a fun and familiar feeling night out (think - large crowd singing Journey at the top of their lungs) this place is the spot. Nothing wrong with a little trip back down memory lane.....

The place plays great music from newer stuff to all your favorites growing up.  Great music while getting drunk and drinks are reasonably priced.  There is an occasional fight to watch which is always some excitement and almost every Friday or Staurday night there will be some cute girls there.  I have not been in awhile now but if you are single and want a good bar that is like a college bar with young people 21 to 30 and cute girls, good music and dont mind being super crowded and having an occasional area of the bar smell like piss then this is definetely a great place for you to go in SF on a Friday or Saturday night.", "author": "Harry E."}

One of the guys I was with puked on himself sitting at a booth, and I don't think anyone cleaned it up, and it was pretty hot downstairs, but other than that I was diggin the scene.  It's actually a good place to go if you want to drink and dance, but not feel like you're in a \"clubby\" type place, like Ruby Skye/Velvet Lounge, etc.  This is more of a \"get drunk and dance if you want\" type place.

Even though it was packed, there was plenty of room to dance, and and even more eye candy. And you could even hold a conversation because it wasn't too too loud.\n\nI had the time of my life here! I'll definitely be back again, and I can't wait :)", "author": "Sarah C."}

I expected it wouldn't be so crowded or big. Last time I went here it was on a Tuesday night and no one was in this place. On this Saturday night though it was packed and it felt more like a two story club than a Irish bar.\n\nThe amazing thing was how many hot girls were in this place. Maybe it's just me - I've been hanging out in the Mission too much and I was drunk, but damn. The scenery here was really good. Of course, where there are cute girls, there are also lots of meatheads. On that note, this place was like a Marina bar, preppy white kids and barely anyone else. I think I saw like three minorities here and most of them were wearing JCrew with the collar up. \n\nSo yeah, I can understand why this place sucks, but it's also sorta in nowadays for whatever reason so it's worth a shot. Oh yeah, one other thing.", "author": "Hmmm W."}

I can't imagine people complaining about what you get from kells. It is what it is and it isn't going to apologize for it and it shouldn't.  after a brief wait on a Friday night, you go in, there's a bar on your left, and another one downstairs.  Two dance floors and lots of crowds all over.  It reminds me (quite a lot actually) of these places I used to go when I lived in Salamanca, Spain.  Woody and brick feel.  Loud enough you mostly have to shout to be heard.  They play the cheesy pop music that (half the time) you know the words to.  And at least someone in your group, it's their FAVORITE song EVER!  They don't try to do too much.  They aren't sophisticated.  They want to get you in, get you drunk, get your booty bouncing and hopefully, get you making out and grinding up on a member of the opposite sex (whether or not you came with someone).  [and btw, in my case, mission NOT accomplished in that regard, but I'm not going to have this be a bitter review  ].  I am happy to report Mission-80%-accomplished. in? check. Drunk? Check. booty bouncing? Almost.  And from looking around: Mission-100% accomplished with a large part of the kells population that day.  Lots of grinding and making out, I'm sure a bunch of them were exchanging saliva before exchanging #'s.  yes, I did that once at kells, I'm not proud to report.  So i think kells had a lot of happy customers that night and so i forsee a lot of those folks making return trips. l too will come back again one day.  Someday when I have friends that want to get in, get drunk, get bouncing to cheesy music and get making out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-01-28", "description": "Kell's is a good spot to go if you are with a small group of friends and want to go someplace that is packed and loud.  I don't know if you'll ever want that, but it's definately \"too late\" to go there if you don't get there early unless you like waiting in lines that are constantly being passed through.  It's a good spot to dance when you're completely drunk and like to sweat on the dance floor because the downstairs gets jammed pack and doesn't seem to have any ventilation.  Definately not a spot to bring a g/f or a date.  To get a drink is a task in itself but over I'd say it's what you make of it.  Dan the bartender there is a cool guy that will take care of you if you tip well.

The reason I hate this place is simple, the weekends.  This might be the biggest bridge and tunnel bar in San Francisco.  Don't believe me?  Go there on a Friday or Saturday night and look at the line of people waiting to get into a Irish Pub??? Then you can find out about a cover to get in..... You look at these poor aimless souls that think this is how it works in the big city and wait like cattle to be let in to have the privilege of being served here.   We were out in the neighborhood and we had some friends that were going out in SF for the night and were at Kells (surprise surprise).  I ask the miniature sized bouncer who was controlling his line to quickly go in and look for them to bring them out so we could go to a real bar only to have him demand $20 from me.  Mind you I was leaving 4 friends outside to try and quickly go grab our friends.   But this toughguy who probably weighed about 170 on a good day wasn't having it.  We ended up leaving or friends to suffer and went out and had a fun time.  Stay away from this place on the weekends.", "author": "Eli Z."}
