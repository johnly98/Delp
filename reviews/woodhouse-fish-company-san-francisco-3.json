This makes a lot of people unhappy, mostly black women.\" - Dennis Rodman\n\nLocation: Lower Pacific Heights, San Francisco. \n\nI came here with one of my Yelp sisters... \"Yo E! I'm in yo hood!\" So we spontaneously decide to meet up. The trendy part of Fillmore was a great meeting spot, and if you know San Francisco, y'know... with your latest Lululemon yoga pants, and overpriced Latt\u00e9Z. Nonetheless we figured to meet on Fillmore after perusing a bunch of cafes in the area. Since we both craved seafood it was an easy decision on Woodhouse at say noon-ish.\n\nAfter meeting up at the Kabuki we stroll to Fillmore. Yes, walking to your meals is a pro tip on staying fit! Lululemon or not! And after a few blocks we arrive to a very clean, country kitchen setting, with everything so white... the walls, silly. We are both famished so order almost immediately after receiving the menus. I order the Anchor Beer Battered Fish & Chips. My trendy friend orders a Maine Split Top Lobster Roll. I add the House Iced Tea and she adds the Arnold Palmer.\n\nAs we sit and chat about Yelp (I know sad), girl talk, and yesterday's gossip, we can't help watching the upper crust people. And before we can scream \"white picket fence\" our lunch is delivered to our table. After a few bites, more chit-chat, we both agree it's a fabulous lunch. My Fish & Chips was pretty perfect, crisp outside, moist inside. My friend also really enjoyed the Lobster Roll. I'm stuffed, but my friend decides to order dessert too. She chooses the Sourdough Bread Pudding. Delicious! \n\nIn the end, I recommend Woodhouse Fish Company to all. It's a really cute caf\u00e9 as described above, and in this case the neighborhood pretty much set the tone. Ok, what I'm trying to say is, yes it's delicious, but on the pricier side. I'm not being cheap, I'm just saying I don't need to spend extra to impress Reese Witherspoon. Hey now, the food was delicious, and my friend.. well whiter than white... D'uh!", "author": "Eric R."}

Wanted seafood but know that the areas in North Beach and wharf are chock full of tourist (and horrendous parking).\n\nSo, looked into Fillmore. Parking STILL sucked but at least traffic was better. After 10 minutes found a great spot as someone pulled out--score!\n\nAt Woodhouse, we ordered the marque dishes, namely the cioppino and the lobster roll. I went for the larger version, i.e. 6 oz. My lobster roll was hearty on a toasted bread that was not soggy. The sauce for the lobster was understated but fine. My meal came with fries and cole slaw. The fries were perfectly done (I wonder if they were in duck fat? Cuz they taste like something I had elsewhere)--crispy. The cole slaw was light--maybe a bit more vinegar to give it some tang would help. Overall, I think the lobster roll is good and authentic but may instead next time go for...\n\nThe Cioppino! It was amazing. My other half ordered it and was it great. Chock full of seafood from Massachusetts (mussels) and locally. It is very hearty. A little more kick/spice than I would like but good. Also pretty amazing price for that.\n\nAmbience is a regular meal place. We were seated next to an adorable toddler but with premonition of what's to come, we moved to a table farther away with bar-type seating. Lucky! cuz soon the kid did not want to eat...(by the way, the fish and chips looked great at that table).\n\nOverall, I will bookmark and keep this place in mind for another meal.", "author": "Sonny W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-18", "description": "I have been coming to Woodhouse Fish Company with my wife and family for many years and every single time has been an amazing culinary experience.  I have tried many things on their menu including the clam chowder, calamari, dungeness crab, crab sandwich, lobster roll, ciopinno, and pasta.  Every single thing on their menu is delicious and consistently good.  \n\nThe one thing I come here for the most is their lobster roll, which is just out of the world delicious.  It is so moist, tender, and juicy that you will literally eat yourself into a food coma.  Every time I have it I am so full I feel like my pants are going to burst open because of how incredibly delicious it is.  Last time I was there I had their cioppino, which was equally amazing, although I did not care for the fish in it that much.  But other than that, it was the best ciopinno I've ever had.  The clams, mussels, squid, and other seafood in it were outstanding, as was the sauce.  \n\nMy only suggestion would be to offer something other than french fries with the lobster and crab roll sandwiches because it cheapens the experience.  The fries are good, but I would suggest serving freshly baked potato chips instead - it would be a more appropriate match.  Keep the coleslaw, though, because that stuff is amazing.  I don't even normally like coleslaw but the one they serve with the lobster roll is so yummy.\n\nParking nearby is hellacious and there is absolutely no room in this restaurant to move around - it can get quite crowded, so I wouldn't come here if you are feeling claustrophobic.  I don't think there is anything they can do about it because this place is so damn popular that they have to make use of every last square foot of space in it to pack everyone in. \n\nAnother highlight of Woodhouse is their customer service.  Every server is friendly and accomodating.  They have such good service and will do their best to keep you happy and keep your water cups full.  The food always comes out hot and steamy.  \n\nPrices are about what you would expect for food of this quality, so it isn't cheap, but it isn't overly expensive either.  It's definitely not a place I can afford to go to regularly, but I will come here periodically to satisfy my lobster craving.  \n\nDefinitely check this place out.  They set the bar so high it will be difficult to go anywhere else for seafood afterwards.", "author": "Howard B."}

Have had much better experience with baked lobster fresh out the shell dipped in butter and lemon sauce- I guess chilled lobster takes away from the palate picking up intensity of flavor. Oysters were just ok, have had better at EMC, didn't find them exactly flavorful. Not sure if something's wrong with my tastebuds, it seems many other people enjoy this place, it's not bad! But for this price point I was expecting something more memorable, I feel like I've forgotten the taste of what I've eaten here already. Great service though!", "author": "Vincent H."}

The waitress was on top of everything and attentive without being annoying. The rest of the staff was quick to refill our waters and take away dishes when we were done. \n\nThe atmosphere was well executed with tasteful and appropriate decor all the way down to the lights above the bar area. The TV in a painting frame was also interesting. \n\nThe food was delicious but nothing that will blow your mind away. The price was also rather high.\n\nWe ordered the large clam chowder to split. I'm glad we did as we saw a table next to us get the small later and it was a tiny cup. It was prepared to perfection, it was fresh and definitely ranks in my top 5 chowders I've ever had.\n\nWe also had the cheese melt. It was nice and gooey but perhaps not warm enough by the time it was served to us. It left us feeling like there was something missing though. Can't quite put my finger on it. \n\nThe lobster roll was the reason why we came here and what we were craving. The bun was cooked to perfection with the right amount of hardened crust and buttery flavor. You can tell they've perfected making those. However, even with the bigger 6oz lobster option ($37 price tag!! Ouch!), the bun seemed to take over and it was too big and too fat. The lobster itself consisted of large (sometimes too large) lobster chunks, covered lightly with mayonnaise and topped with chives. The fries on the side were nicer and crispy with good structure but weren't very absorbent of salt and pepper. The coleslaw was mediocre and lacked flavor (both the lobster roll and the melt came with coleslaw and fries, on the side).\n\nAgain, everything was delicious and the service was great, but at that price point, it was missing that extra oomph to justify it.", "author": "Mario B."}

I didnt even look at the menu, just looked at yelp and planned my order before my visit. \n\nCity parking is a nightmare, so dont even bother. I took the bart then uber, so that solve the problem.\n\nMy waitress with the red hair gave me a blank look, maybe because I was a party of one ? I sat close to the kitchen, to make sure I didnt have to flag her down so often. Overall she was tentative and semi-friendly. \n\nMy orders were... \n\n1) $1 oyster : super! Not too small or large. They were very fresh, and with a hint of lemon - couldnt get any better deal elsewhere! (+1 star)\n\n2) New England clam chower : I was taking by surprised because it was so hot! My maxillary wall got slightly burned :( All the clam chowers I have had previously was luke warm. This one came with a bit of chives, and a lot of clams to chew on. Not too watery or too many potatoes filler. It was simply heart warming (+2 stars) \n\n3) Small Lobster roll: no fillers ( such as a big lettuce - like the roll in pleasanton, checked my review) no overly dressing with mayonnaise. Simply pure chunks of fresh lobster. Add in a bit of Tabasco sauce, lemon and every bite will transport you to the beach. The bread was perfectly toasted and not soggy. Overall, I was please with my roll, but I have had better - check out my vegas loster roll review.  This one havent quite reach that high level yet. I will come back for a bigger lobster roll to compare the two (+1)  \n\n4) chocolate moose with whip cream and raspberry : out of this world! It wasnt overly sweet, just my definition of the prefect dessert. Because it felt so light and the taste was OH so refreshing, that i was eating by a big spoon full (+1) \n\nNegative : Since I didn't even check the menu, I was surprised to see that they have increased their prices. I asked when, and they said last week, so I will keep an eye out for the price on my next visit :)", "author": "hong m."}

($1 oysters on Tuesdays!)\n\nI've never visited Cape Cod, but I'd venture to say that Woodhouse feels like a more upscale version of a timeless mom-and-pop restaurant in some summer beach destination. With a lot less seersucker, of course, because this is San Francisco we're talking about. \n\nWe came here with the lobster roll in mind, but we also ordered some oysters, a bowl of clam chowder, and the shrimp roll. I abandoned any thoughts of Massachusetts as soon as I spotted the generous amount of avocado resting on top of the shrimp roll -- what a Californian take on a classic. I'm usually fairly ambivalent about clam chowder, but just a spoonful of this rich, flavorful chowder destroyed everything I had thought was true.\n\nAnd the lobster roll: perfectly buttered and toasted bread and tender, fresh lobster meat. Unpretentiously nautical, Woodhouse's claim to the best lobster roll in the city is well deserved, even if the food is a bit pricey.", "author": "Amy C."}

The seating is a little tight but not overly so. The gf and I started off with the mussels and thought the broth was lovely. Then came out crab cakes and fish and chips. The spill on the crab cakes gave it a night savory kick. The salad that it came with was good but nothing special. Now onto the star; their fried fish. It was hot, the fish was flaky, and their tarter sauce has the right amount of tartness to balance the grease of the fish. \n\nThe service there that night was fantastic. The gf had a glass of wine and accidentally dropped it, causing it to shatter as it hit the marble counter top. Our waiter came by and asked if we were ok while wiping down the counter. He asked if we had a full glass or half before it went all over the counter. We said half, but he came by with another glass that was more than the first!

The coleslaw was tiny (and also excessively creamy), placed in what is usually the size of a sauce cup. The fries turned out quite perfectly: warm but not too hot, with a satisfying crisp. \n\nThe $22/small (3 oz) is a decently filling portion size, especially since you get stuffed with fries. After tax/tip/SF mandate it totals closer to $28. The menu price is similar to New England Eatery ($23.50) in Burlingame, the other lobsta roll eatery in the Bay. \n\nService is friendly, and the vibe of the restaurant is more of a traditional seafood restaurant, in contrast to the many hipster places in SF. It's a nice sit-down place that's good for taking your visiting friends (unless they are from the East Coast), since it doesn't get too loud and features a unique repertoire of seafood. They also have a specials board, on which I noticed a pork belly shrimp po-boy. \n\nThe verdict?

I mentioned this restaurant to my friend and she said this was one of her favorite places to have seafood.\n\nThe hardest thing was choosing what to order. I was told to order the fish and chips, but I also wanted to try the clam chowder. So we ordered a 3 piece order of the fish and chips and a cup of the clam chowder. We also order the garlic bread because we wanted to have a little sample of it.\n\nSo the portions are very filling here. I could have had the 2 piece order and still not finished it. You could tell that the fish was fresh and they had a nice batter. The fries were nice and crispy.  I couldn't stop nibbling on them even when I was full. The clam chowder was amazing. It had huge chunks of clam and a nice amount of garlic. Order through side of garlic bread. It's not on the menu, but you can order it if you ask for it.\n\nI came in around 5 pm which was perfect for me to get my food quickly and get home.

I normally start with a cup of New England clam chowder, then get the fish n chips for my main course - so flaky and so good!

The garlic wine broth really made the entree, especially with the garlic bread for dipping! \n\nI am a big seafood person and love the consistency and freshness that Woodhouse offers.

I've been wanting to come for years...I used to traipse up and down Fillmore while my son rehearsed with the SF Boys Chorus back in the day when they rehearsed on Post. But I never really wanted to eat there by myself...although it would be perfectly comfortable to do so, I wanted to enjoy it with someone.\n\nFinally came with the hubby during our weekend-long anniversary celebration. We were meeting friends at the Fillmore for a concert that began at 9 so stopped in to Woodhouse at 7:15 to see how long the wait would be. They could take us at the counter right away. We love a good counter. Their counter only holds about 6 people in its L-shaped configuration, and we got the end that has 2 seats looking towards the kitchen. \n\nFrom the moment we sat down we felt a warm and friendly vibe from everyone...the hostess, the bartender who took care of us with drinks and food, the servers...even the other people sitting with us at the counter. When I asked if they had a stout beer, the bartender replied \"I wish\" and I said \"ME TOO!\" and we laughed. I love that he could feel my pain. Anyway, hubby had some kind of beer and I had some red wine...perfectly fine.\n\nIt was painfully difficult to narrow our choices. From oysters to local-caught squid to soft shell crab sandwich to clam rolls to lobster rolls to a whole trout - it was a huge problem for me. Finally decided to split an iceberg crab louie salad and then hubby got the cioppino and I got the full lobster roll. The salad was very good - loads of crab did not disappoint. Hubby loved and scarfed down the cioppino. The lobster roll was also delicious but I will recommend that it is A LOT of lobster so I should have gone with the smaller portion offering. Although, I did take it back to the hotel fridge, and dipped back into it around 11am the next day and it held up extremely well so I was pretty happy with my two-meal lobster roll.\n\nAnyway, service was exactly as it should be with timing and checking in and explaining different items so we always felt cared for but not bugged.\n\nSo glad we finally came and I will not hesitate to come again!", "author": "Laurie H."}

I expected a wait so this was a wonderful surprise. We decided to order a small lobster roll ($22) and a large lobster roll ($36) to split. We felt ordering two smalls would not give us enough lobster meat and two larges would be too much but also too pricey. In addition, we had the hefeweizen and the ipa, both were great but we both loved the ipa alot more. \n\nThe lobster rolls were amazing! I definitely had my lobster craving satisfied but I wouldn't have if we had only gotten small rolls. They use the same size rolls for both and the only difference is that there's double meat on the large. What we did was we each took half a small and half a large and split the meat evenly over both rolls. Therefore, we each ended up with a lobster roll containing around 4.5 ounces of meat...and boy oh boy was the meat good! The lobster tasted so fresh and juicy and despite it having some mayo sauce on it, the flavor was not masked by it. It was by far the best lobster roll I have ever had (here on the west coast, since I have not yet tried east coast rolls so its unfair to compare). In addition, the coleslaw was refreshing and creamy and the fries were a great compliment. \n\nI totally recommend this place for the lobster rolls.

The lobster didn't have much flavor. It's a Maine-style roll, so the lobster is served cold with a house-made mayo dressing. The toasted bun was good.

We were there because I asked for an excellent cioppino restaurant, and WFC did not disappoint. Delicious broth, a variety of seafood with every element fresh and tender, and, importantly, the right size. Too small a serving leaves you disappointed, too large a serving and you are faced with leftovers of a dish that truly cannot be eaten reheated.\n\nSo why only four stars?

We were looking for some crab but foolishly thought it would be available. Little did we know the wild crabs are mating so their sex is not to be disturbed just so humans could eat their bodies.\n\nWe had:\n1) Clam chowder bowl--very creamy and delicious!\n2) Fish and chips--perfectly flaky batter with tender/juicy fish meat on top of a bed of fries that were a little above average.\n3) Lobster roll--not the best ever, but gets the job done if you're looking for that succulent lobster meat sitting between some buttery sourdough bread. The buttery lobster taste could've been more apparent and not as drowned out by the celery/mayo sauce.\n\nI guess after eating seafood around the world, in my opinion this place just didn't have that oomph that makes it stand out from the rest. Everything was good, but won't be the best. If anything, this is a great place to take a date to enjoy the interior design, the area around Japantown, some good seafood paired with an SF brew.", "author": "Marlon T."}

My go to dishes from here would be the oysters, fried whole-belly ipswich clams, toasted-buttered dungeness crab roll, baja-style fish tacos and the cioppino.\n\nThe ipswich clams are perfectly battered and fried with great flavor bite after bite. I really liked the dungeness crab roll and prefer it over the lobster roll any day of the week but i'm just being bias because i love crab and i can eat it for days. The mayo mixed with the real crab meat was very light and the toasted bread was perfectly buttered and did not anyway over power the star of the sandwich, the crab. Our usual dish we order is the cioppino due to the amount of seafood you get with a light yet chunky broth and the clams they serve here are really large.\n\nThe staff are always friendly and attentive everytime my friends and i stop by. Our orders always come in a timely manner and steamy hot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-24", "description": "The dinner decision for the evening was up to me, and I settled on Woodhouse because of the famous lobster rolls. You can't find them at too many places in Hawaii (at least, in sandwich form), so I was anxious to try the entr\u00e9e here. Plus, I was craving fresh lobster.\n\nWoodhouse doesn't take reservations, so our group of four showed up around 6:15 p.m. on a Saturday evening and were told the wait was 20-30 minutes. There are neighboring stores you can browse in while waiting for your name to be called. Just check back in with the hostess close to your time to make sure your entire party is present. \n\nThe restaurant isn't that big and seating is rather crowded, so if you have a larger party, it's a good idea to go early. I must say, even though Woodhouse was busy, their customer service was on point. One of our group member's entrees was super delayed in coming (the stuffed artichokes took a long time to prepare, I guess). But, to compensate for the long wait time, our server brought a huge bowl of soup for her and comped one of our beers. That was a nice gesture on the restaurant's behalf, but the food was delicious. It was worth waiting for.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\n\"Stuffed Artichokes\": This was probably the most unique entr\u00e9e on our table. It featured split, grilled and stuffed artichokes that were filled with Dungeness crab and bay shrimp. I was impressed with the sheer size of this dish, as well as the fillings -- they didn't skimp on the crab or the shrimp. Even though this entr\u00e9e took a while to make, my friend said it was delicious and it was definitely different. It also comes with dipping sauces and garlic toast. \n\n\"Baja-Style Fish Tacos\": This entr\u00e9e comprised crispy, battered cod with cabbage, chipotle aioli, pico de gallo and avocado. It featured three fish tacos. Having spent some time in San Diego, I feel like my standard for fish tacos is high ... but this dish really wowed me. Instead of being grilled, the fish was crispy. It was lightly battered and perfectly fresh; not too crispy, oily or greasy. My friend and I were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed it! And, the tacos weren't puny - three per order was a good size. The chipotle aioli was also delicious; it added a nice kick to the tacos. If you're craving fish but don't want all the fries (from the fish and chips), I highly recommend giving this entr\u00e9e a try. \n\n\"Split-Top Maine Lobster Roll\": You could get the smaller version for $22 or the larger version for $36. I was hungry by this time, but I opted for the smaller version because I didn't know how large the large actually was. The small ended up being the perfect size - the sandwich itself wasn't super duper big, so I was able to finish it all because I was starving. I had leftovers of the fries, which was fine. The sandwich itself was just as tasty as I imagined it to be - the bread was warm, buttery and slightly chewy, and I actually really liked the coleslaw. It was refreshing and tasty. The lobster chunks were juicy, fresh, buttery and flavorful. The fries are thin fries, and since I don't use ketchup, I coated them liberally with malt vinegar to give it added taste. Yum! I would recommend this lobster roll because it's worth trying if you haven't before and it hits the spot if you're craving it. But, go with the smaller option so you can perhaps try some of the other entrees your group orders. \n\n\"Cioppino\": My friend wanted to compare this cioppino dish to others he had gotten in the past. This entr\u00e9e came with garlic bread and was deemed \"the grand San Francisco seafood dish.\" There was too much tomato for my personal preference in this dish, but it was a good seafood medley if you want things with shells (clams, mussels, etc.) in a hearty broth. \n\n\"Cheddar Cheese Crab Melt\": I was thinking of ordering this or the lobster roll, since I really wanted a sandwich for dinner. But, since I knew I was going to get something with crab the next morning for brunch, I decided to pass on the crab cheese melt for dinner that evening. I read good things about it though, and I want to try it next time. It seems like this sandwich includes the same buttery bread that's used to make the lobster roll, and the sandwich itself comes generously stuffed with chunks of crab and lots of melted cheese. \n\n\"Fish and Chips\": This was another entr\u00e9e I was debating on getting, since I love a good fish and chips and SF is known for their seafood. You have the option of getting two or three pieces. I would probably opt for two pieces if I ever order this dish. Now that I know the fish here really is phenomenal--and I like the way it's battered and prepared--I look forward to ordering this one day.", "author": "Kelli S."}

Is the price of $35 for double meat justifiable? No, not at all (most expensive sammich I've ever had). But it was still delicious. I can't believe that at our table of 4 Seattlelites, none of us asked for the clam chowder (I just stared at the dude next to us and his giant bowl of goodness). If I ever come back here, I'll have to get that.\n\nGot the bay shrimp avocado roll, the lobster roll, baja fish tacos, and the crab melt. The baja fish tacos were actually the best out of the 4 of them. Maybe it's just because they use cod, and I love cod. The shrimp and avocado roll wasn't my cup of tea; the shrimp was sweet and it was a weird combination with the giant slices of avocado.\n\nOverall, my tummy was happy.

Light on the mayo, with small dice celery and chives with a buttered split bun.  I haven't had one in Maine, but if they were going for buttery sweetness, I think they hit it.  Tasty, but I'm pretty sure one with crab or shrimp would taste about the same.

I had high hopes for this place because i've heard so much about it. The clams being $16 and the mussels being $14 although considered appetizers were actually pretty good. It wasn't a meal to fill someone up but it was just the right amount to help with hunger. The sauce for the clams was a garlic creamy butter type flavor, very similar to hog island and the fries just went well with the sauce. Tasted like a garlic butter clam chowder but i personally would drink the sauce on it's own. I think Hog island wins it for me though because the flavor there was much more balanced and clams were plenty.

I just think the food now is just missing something that would put the food over the top. \n\nThe items I had a couple times are\n*The Dungeness Crab roll - The meat is cool, but the sandwich overall is just too dry. Maybe if they used or gave some hot butter on the side, because its literally a mound of crab inside, nothing else. I had to resort to using the cole slaw to put inside to make it taste a little better.\n\n*Lobster Roll - This was the roll was made me fall in love in the first place. The flavor is this roll is a lot better, but same thing... its just missing something to put it over the top. It is a little bit pricy, seems like they tone down the amount of lobster they pack inside, so if your trying a roll, this has to be the one you get.\n\n*Fish tacos - Crispy and crunchy, but they're decent. Nothing memorable about these.\n\n*New England Clam Chowder - Just your average clam chowder. Unfortunately it doesn't taste better than what you can get on the pier. \n\nI used to once rave about how good Woodhouse is, but upon trying other places, I feel like this isn't the home-run go-to place that stole my heart the first time I came.

We were told a 30-minute wait, so we decided to walk around/shop some more besides standing outside in the cold. By the time it was 7:30PM we were sat in a closely-quartered two-top table. The ambiance is pretty New England-y/preppy and the tables are extremely close to the point where you can rub elbows with your neighbors. \n\nBecause we ate small portions all day, (Fraiche right before), we decided to start with the oysters and share a lobster roll. Prices are HIGH here, even for seafood standards. But it was delicious. Lobster is in large portions, but the bread was a bit too buttery for me. Fries are terrific, not too oily or overdone. I would definitely come for their Tuesday deal, but I think SF has better seafood spots that dole out bigger portions for the price you're paying.\n\nService was slow during the dinner rush, but we had a cheerful server.

The menu is very slight; they should have a chef who has perfected the cooking of the few seafood items on it by now. There were fewer diners than there've been in the past - perhaps the word is spreading that this once fresh restaurant is no longer worth its steep, steep prices (my $21 soft-shell crab BLT - in a small hot-dog bun - had burnt bacon and crab that was fried to the point where it was not recognizable as crab). $160 lunch bill and nobody enjoyed the meal.", "author": "Alison H."}

Street parking was ample and we were seated immediately in the small interior.

Last one I had was thirty years ago in Cape Cod. This is just how I remembered them, and honestly, once you get past the sweet succulent lobster here, which was plentiful but not indulgent, there's not much to review. The shoestring fries were dece,as was the slaw.\n\nNow we get to the good part. Awesome fish and chips (and I know a thing or two about fish and chips, hailing from Seattle). Batter was perfect, light and not greasy, and the wild Alaskan cod was copious and delish! And maybe some of the best tartar sauce around!  I will be back for this!\n\nThough maybe a bit skimpy on the crab (I know, a clich\u00e9 with crab reviews), the split artichoke was presented and executed with perfection. Tasted wonderful! (And next time I'll get extra aioli because it was great and well, just because.)\n\nReviews tend to bypass the lemonades and Arnold Palmers, but Woodhouse's deserves a special mention for their nifty presentation of these beverages--you get your own cordial of simple syrup to sweeten as you may. \n\nIt's this attention to detail--simple syrup, tartar sauce, aioli--that lifts this place above the rest.

We were able to walk around and chitchat while we waited.\n\nWe weren't super hungry, so we got a few things to share: Poke, Cioppino, and Crab Cakes. At the recommendation of our waitress, I paired this with a Sauvignon Blanc. I would say skip the Poke, because it just tasted like ahi tuna drenched in soy on a chip. The crab cakes are a perfect balance of crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth goodness on the inside. Finally, the cioppino was truly the star of the show. It might not look like much when it arrives, but it's definitely filling and there's plenty of good stuff (read: seafood) in it.\n\nFor a seafood place in San Francisco, I would say this place is average price. Definitely not cheap, but you're also not paying as much as you would elsewhere in the city. Also, service was fine. Nothing really noteworthy there.

There was still a fair amount of seating when my friend and I arrived at noon, so we chose the high top tables in the back for a little more privacy than the regular tables. Loved the decor of the place: lots of seafood/marine-themed art, but also a little panda bear wearing a Giants hat hehe ^_^\n\nTuesdays are $1 oysters all day so there's no crowd like at HH places. The Point Reyes oysters were on the saltier/brinier side than I'm used to, and the horseradish could've been stronger, but for the price I'll take it LOL. We also shared a small lobster roll and the daily special, a shrimp and pork belly po'boy. I liked that the rolls had a nice crunch on the edges but were fluffy on the insides, and that they weren't overly buttered so you could really taste the flavor of the meat. The pork belly came out tender and juicy, while the sprouts countered the saltiness of the meat, and the jalapenos added a nice kick to the whole sandwich; the shrimp, sadly, was disappointing and over-breaded. The lobster roll may have looked small, but it was packed with lobster meat, including an enormous claw. I loved that it wasn't covered in mayo either so all you tasted was pure fresh sweet lobster. What was drenched in mayo, however, was the cole slaw, so I recommend you eat the sandwich before your palate is ruined by that. Fries were thin, crispy, and not too oily, just the way I like them.\n\nThis was a way more expensive lunch that I'm used to (came out to just under $30 each) but I'd be willing to splurge here once in a while!

The calamari came with a marinara or cocktail sauce (I'm not sure which), but truly, it needed nothing. The lobster roll was deeply, deeply satisfying.\n\nDespite being full, I spied a strawberry shortcake on the menu, and I can never ever pass that up, especially in a place where I couldn't imagine not loving it.\n\nIt was ambrosial.

It came with these yummy fries (that tasted like McDonalds fries) thin, yet crispy and a side of cole slaw, which wasn't too tart, yet totally refreshing. Loved every bite!!  My friend had the Dungeness Crab Melt with the same fries & slaw & loved it! \n\nFor dessert we splurged and went with the Sourdough Bread Pudding. Its served hot.

The whole roll was smaller than my hand and I have the world's tiniest hands!

My waitress was really helpful when it came to ordering these little pearls. There were three types: Point Reyes, Kumamoto, and some other type that costed $1.50 extra. I enjoyed the Kumamoto oyster because it was more creamy than the other. The Point Reyes, however, was subtly on the sweeter and juicier end. Both were fresh and that's all I can say. So EAT THE OYSTERS haha. \n\nWell every other choices that my fam and I ordered were delicious also. We got the Cioppino, Trout, Crab Cakes, and Fried Calamari. All were great, so I'm guessing you can't really go wrong with any of their options. \n\nIf you're a drinker and want to order some beer, my dad really enjoyed the IPA.

I did a quick yelp search, and this place came up. All of us really wanted creamy new england clam chowder and not the buttery broth variety, and Woodhouse definitely offers it. This place is really small and cozy (probably only seats 30-35), and we had a table of 6 people, so we had to wait 1.5 hours to get a seat. I liked that they took down my phone number so that they could text me when our table was ready. We took the opportunity to wander around Japantown and take some sticker pictures to kill some time. So, I'd recommend to either call ahead or go with a small party.\n\nI ordered a cup of NE clam chowder and a small lobster roll. They also have a large lobster roll, which is the same sized roll with double meat. The clam chowder was absolutely delicious!! It was creamy, rich, and flavorful, and it came with a ton of clam. I really wish I had ordered a full bowl instead. The lobster roll, in my opinion, was just ok. The bread was great--buttery, perfectly toasted. The lobster itself didn't wow me in flavor or texture.

I'm actually not a huge fan of celery so I wish I knew that in advance, but my review won't reflect my bias hatred towards celery.\n\nWoodhouse gives you a pretty proportional amount of lobster to your bread serving so you definitely get lobster with every bite. I personally wish the sandwich was a bit larger considering that it was already over $20. I know they have a \"large\" option to double the amount of lobster, but I think it's too pricey ($30+), and doesn't reflect on the rest of the sandwich, meaning the bread (same size).\n\nThe fries were super crispy and still warm even though I didn't touch them until I finished my sandwich.

They've got a simple menu with the classic seafood options - chowder, mussels, crab, etc. Most people come on Tuesdays for the $1 oysters. I don't like lines, so I've only been here for lunch. \nThe space is bright and refreshing with a seaside theme. The panoramic painting of a beach above the bench really brightens up the venue. The framed flat screen tv displays scenes of the pier on a loop, a very nice touch. There is a bar area towards the back of the restaurant. The rest of the decor has some knick knacks here and there, but not done in an overwhelming cheesy way like some seafood places.\n\nSplit-Top Maine Lobster Roll - $22 for 3 oz., $36 for 6 oz. lobster meat, same-sized roll:\nIt's a little pricey for a lobster roll, but not an egregiously high price. Most lobster rolls have about 3-3.5 ounces of lobster meat and average a little under $20 (depending on location, seasonality, and the type of restaurant). I wouldn't have cared had I not noticed it is quite a jump (~20-30%) from just the past year. \nAnyways, the lobster is richly dressed Maine style with mayo and scallions & celery. It looks like a lot of tender claw meat, but once I turned the roll to the side, I saw that most of the meat was lying on top of the sandwich and didn't sit too well in the thin roll. The roll was buttery and toasted to a golden brown crunch while still soft inside. Mr. Joy would have preferred it without celery and Connecticut style with butter instead of mayo, but it was still an excellent Maine lobster roll. It also comes with fries, slaw, and a lemon wedge.\n\nThey change up the pasta options every so often. The one I tried last was their Dungeness Crab & Uni Linguine. It was topped with a good amount of shredded crab. Some uni was interspersed throughout the linguine. The white wine sauce was buttery and creamy, but not too thick and heavy. The bacon bits added some smokey, salty flavor, while the chives and lemon wedge brightened up the dish. \n\nI'd like to try their cioppino next time. The server we had was very friendly and outgoing. Maybe one day I'll make it down on a Tuesday if I get here early enough to beat the crowd, since they don't take reservations.", "author": "Joy W."}

That's where I sat. Great place because the servers don't have to come from behind they can place it nicely in front of you. The two things that I loved in the restaurant were the framed tv that shows stills of cool sea related things and from time to time will show a webcam shot of fishermen unloading crab. And two: the Picasso drawing of a fish. Awesome!\n\nTo start off I had the Big Eye IPA, which I highly recommend being that I am a big fan of IPAs. Love the bite of the drink.

It was not and I repeat NOT over mayonnaise'd. It was just right mix of creamy goodness. The role was toasted to perfect and it was crispy yet soft. It came with fries that were ok but still good. \n\nThe crab cakes were super moist and had a delectable crunch on the outside. The spices use to create these were awesome.

The place can get busy and parking can be very difficult.  We got there at 5:30 and sat at a nice window table as the place was 25% full.  By 6pm people had to submit their names and wait.  Any party larger than 4 is going to have to split up in this small location.  We later saw a group of 9 split between a table top and counter seating.\n\nBe sure to always check the specials board. As it is close to the end of soft shell crab season, I went with the soft shell crab BLT over the Pork Belly & Oyster Po-Boy off the specials menu.  My gal went with the Dungeoness Crab Sandwich.  The entrees are all served with slaw and garlic fries.  The fries are not too garlicky. \n\nAlthough I did not get them this time, the onion rings and the fish and chips are great options especially for those with kids.  Oh I went with my standard Arnold Palmer which is also fun because they let you pour in the sugar to make it just right for you.   Its like a fun chemistry kit.  Also great for the kids!\n\nI should mention that I do usually come for the signature lobster roll and its buttery goodness, but told myself I could get that any day!  I was also told that the Po Boy might get added to the full menu as it is popular.  \n\nFood came out fast and service was friendly.  The soft shell crab was excellent.  I almost forgot about the bacon which as we all know- everything tastes better with bacon!! I will definitely be looking forward to that item coming back on the specials menu!!  \n\nShortcoming of the restaurant is the 2 item dessert menu, but that is okay since there are good options along Fillmore for that!

I'd been here 2 or 3 times now, but have never been wowed by the food. I've tried the crab cakes, shrimp/avocado roll, New England clam chowder, lobster roll, fettuccine with prawns, and iceberg louis salad with shrimp. The crab cakes were good with the sauce, but nothing suuuuper exciting. The shrimp/avocado roll was all right - small shrimp is used, with slices of avocado on top. It felt like a lot of bread relative to the filling. My clam chowder bowl was really disappointing, especially after having so much delicious chowder in Seattle. It was weird - it didn't really have any flavor or taste, yet it was still salty and peppery at the same time. It was just missing that clam chowder taste?? The lobster roll is pretty good, and the smaller size is pretty small, but the fries help fill you up. (You have to ask for ketchup separately, they don't have any on the table by default)\n\nWhat I really wanted to include in this review was the fettuccine pasta dish I got for dinner today. It had a sort of pesto-y, white wine sauce, with large prawns. It looked really good, but it was WAY too salty. I tasted all the salt immediately in my first bite. I tried another bite but it was just so salty that I couldn't eat it anymore. The flavor, besides all the salt, was pretty good otherwise. Lots of herbs and pesto flavor. We told our server that the dish was just too salty for us, and he apologized and took it away, and asked if we wanted to get another dish instead. We replaced it with the iceberg louis salad with shrimp, which came with lots of the small bay shrimp. It was good - but they drenched the salad in a lottttt of thousand islands dressing :( which rendered a lot of the salad at the bottom of the dish way too wet and soaked in sauce. Sigh. But I did like it otherwise. \n\nWe weren't charged for the salty fettuccine, but were charged for the salad - just in case anybody was wondering how sending dishes back work. I don't eat here super regularly, only occasionally when I want some seafood, but after the salty dishes I had tonight, it might be awhile before I try it again :/ service is stellar though and the people working there are chill and super reasonable, so that stops me from saying that I'll *never* come back!\n\ntl;dr lobster roll is my fave thing to get here; fettuccine dish was too salty, clam chowder meh.

We didn't even want to try to look for street parking, so we parked at the Japantown garage and walked the two blocks. I'd recommend this as their prices are pretty affordable. \n\nWhen we arrived at 11 we realized they weren't open until 11:30 on the weekends, so we shopped at Crossroads Trading Co. across the street.  As soon as they opened at 11:30 we were the first ones in, with other customers coming in right behind us.  I was excited because that meant other people thought they were good. We got a nice little table right by the front window.\n\nWe already knew what we wanted to order (I always do my Yelp research lol).  We shared a bowl of clam chowder and the lobster roll.  The waiter brought us water and refilled them throughout our meal.\n\nThe clam chowder arrived first. It was garnished with chopped chives and came with a packet of oyster crackers.  It had a good amount of clams and was not loaded with potatoes like other places. It was not too hot, so we were able to enjoy it.\n\nThe lobster roll comes with crispy fries, a small side of coleslaw, and a lemon wedge.  They have two sizes for the lobster roll, but we opted for the smaller. Judging from pictures, it looks like you just get more lobster, not a bigger roll too.  I didn't want to be overwhelmed with lobster and I wasn't sure the price jump justified getting a more lobster that would just fall out of the roll anyway. The server already brought us plates and the roll was cut in half, which I thought was nice since they already knew we were sharing. The lobster portion was very generous and there were big pieces - claws and all.  It was tossed in a creamy mayonnaise with chopped celery.  I was afraid it might be too mayonnaise-y, but it was perfect. The squeeze of lemon over the top really brightened everything up too.  The roll was nice and buttery and grilled so the outside had a slight crunch, but the inside was soft.  Mmmm. The only other time I've had a lobster roll was at the wharf where it comes in a hard, untoasted sourdough bread.  This was way better!\n\nTheir fries were all crispy!  This is very rare as you seem to always get one soggy one, but these were great.\n\nI'm not a fan of coleslaw usually, but I had to try theirs because everything else was good.  I would say it was better than I expected.  My boyfriend doesn't typically like coleslaw either, but he put some in his lobster roll and enjoyed it.  \n\nOn the table they have a container/bucket that has salt, pepper, tobasco, malt vinegar, and ketchup.  I like how instead of a bottle of heinz ketchup it's more of a jar.  The wider mouth makes the ketchup come out faster.\n\nOverall the experience and food was very tasty. The restaurant is small, but it's decorated nicely.  It seems to get busy quickly, so come early.  The waiters were all friendly and the food was delicious.  I would come again and recommend.", "author": "Allison L."}

I'm okay with that. \n\nWe arrived at WH on a Saturday night. Let me preface this review by noting that we had been drinking all day in Napa (ugh). When we got back to SF, I quickly switched to beer (self-five!), and I was 2.25 pints in by the time I arrived at WH (self-five!). \n\nWe started with the calamari and clam chowder. The calamari was mighty tasty--it was definitely flash-fried perfectly--light, flaky and crunchy. I could have easily murdered that entire dish by my lonesome. But never mind the calamari, you're going to want to start directly with the clam chowder. Oh my goodness, I'm a bit of a clam chowder (as well as idiot) savant. If clam chowder is available, I'll probably order it. This is easily one of, if not the, best I've ever had. Please note the gravity of this statement, as I grew up on the east coast and have extensively traveled across the east coast in my adulthood. \n\nThe ingredient that seems to make WH's clam chowder especially delicious is onion. I don't know what they did with that onion, but it makes WH's clam chowder kind of outstanding. I think I'd like to take a bath in it. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the crab and uni linguine, light on the bacon. I ordered it with light bacon, against my better judgment, because my friend had been there for dinner  on NYE 2014 and said the bacon flavor had overpowered the dish. I took note and I'm glad I did. The dish was delicious--perfectly portioned (you're going to want to share anyway because it's pretty rich), served with a creamy sauce and topped with fresh crab. The bacon keeps the dish a little interesting.  It. Is. Good. \n\nWhat's on tap? Anchor Steam and Scrimshaw Pilsner.  I was so surprised at the quality of the Scrimshaw Pilsner (which I did not order myself). I generally prefer to order what's on tap, because it tastes fresher and better to me. I ordered an Anchor Steam because I knew nothing about the Scrimshaw. Maybe I was buzzed, or maybe I'm developing a taste for pilsners,  or maybe both, but that was a nice beer. \n\nAnyway, this restaurant was great.

I just ran across Jelena's recent review and after seeing John's comment, I knew that I couldn't go wrong following my two fellow \"Jay Z's\"!!  \n\nMy mom's b-day was yesterday and she was longing for some lobster so I treated her to 2 large lobster rolls which we split - one with just drawn butter (upon request) and one with the light mayo.  The mayo is your typical lobster roll that you often see but the drawn butter option really lets the natural lobster flavor shine through!!  Both were delicious and satisfying.  The regular one with 3 oz of lobster runs $18 but for an extra $8, you get double the lobster at 6 oz so go crazy and splurge!!  Just make sure to hover over your plate to eat so you don't lose a single morsel of goodness.", "author": "Joyce Z."}

Very satisfying.\nThe last item is the steamed mussels. This dish was filled with so many little bad boys and no empty shell where I could not find the mate. This alone makes it a success. A savory broth but a bit peppery for my taste. The waitress was kind to offer some after dinner sourdough to dip with the various broths.

My friend and I came on a Saturday at 10pm and there was still a 20-30 minute wait but the staff was so friendly and seated us right when a table was available. \n\nIt took awhile for our waitress to come take our order but since it was our first time, we didn't mind the wait too much since we were trying to figure out what to order. We decided on clam chowder, 8 oysters, calamari, a lobster roll, and a crab roll. Our calamari came out first and by then, we were starving so we scarfed it down. It was really good and came with a decent sized portion! The clam chowder wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't anything special. The oysters, however, were so fresh and tasty! I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nNow onto the lobster and crab rolls.. While we were waiting to be seated, I scrolled through a bunch of yelp reviews and most people said that the crab roll was so much better than the lobster roll. I was a little unsure at first because I've only heard people talk about lobster rolls when they mention Woodhouse Fish Co. We ordered both to try and let me tell you... the crab roll is AMAZING!!! The crab was warm, tender, and flavored to perfection. The lobster roll was a bit disappointing for me. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it didn't really live up to my expectations. I was really looking forward to a juicy bite of wonderfully flavored lobster but the lobster ended being cold and not as tender as I would've liked. \n\nKeep in mind this place isn't as cheap as you might think! A half order of the lobster roll is $19 and a half order of the crab roll is $18.\n\nI'll definitely be coming back here but next time, I'm sticking to just the crab roll.

We were seated right away by the waiters and surveyed the seafood menu. They had so many options from pastas, to fried fish, to sandwiches. Even the desserts sounded scrumptious! After some debating, we ended up ordering the Maine Lobster Roll ($18) the 3 piece crab cakes and fish and chips (both were $15) and the Crab Louie Salad. I really enjoyed my Lobster Roll because of the savory element coming from the fresh lobster and the buttery element from the softness of the roll. The crab cakes were nice and crispy and tangy with the chipotle sauce. And the crust of the fish and chips was soooo flaky, yet delicious. The skin basically fell off when I picked one piece up. The creamy tartar sauce that comes with the fish compliments the dish well.\n\nMy only complaint is that the service was just on par, nothing too memorable. I don't think our waitress refilled our waters, especially when we needed it the most. Also the meal was quite expensive for lunch, though understandable since seafood is normally really expensive.

But we were fortunate to get a table of six without a wait at 6pm on a Wednesday. \n\nBowl of New England Clam Chowder - a creamy thick chowder topped with some chopped chives.  Usually restaurants serve chowders with more potatoes than clams. Not this one. Clams were plentiful and they tasted fresh and tender.  One of best clam chowders that I've had.

A deep-fried soft-shell crab with bacon and tomato served in a roll with a side of shoestring fries and a small cup of cole slaw.  Crab was tasty, but wished a different type of bread was used, maybe a bun, as it was hard keeping the crab in the roll after each bite. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/woodhouse-fish-co-san-francisco?select=B0pnfsTDIjiN6aM0ORGmYg#8t4pcxSKmkZ_MwuvpBlz-A)\n\nLobster & Hand-cut Pappardelle with saffron butter, pea pesto, garlic and cherry tomatoes.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/woodhouse-fish-co-san-francisco?select=B0pnfsTDIjiN6aM0ORGmYg#ykPB_uC7DNurXVP3BsJKHQ)\n\nCrab Cakes - shared as an after dinner appetizer by our group since they forgot to serve it before our main courses.  Three cakes drizzled with chipotle sauce with a nice mixed green salad tossed in vinaigrette with chopped beets.  Wished the cakes were made with lump crab meat and it needed a little more seasoning.

Filling portions with a tasty and unique take on classic seafood dishes, but a bit too pricey.\n\nFood: Delicious and generously portioned. We ordered:\n1) Local oysters. Since it wasn't Tuesday (buck-a-shuck!) these were $2.50 each. Fresh and tasty, but small. Would pass next time.\n2) Lobster roll. Meaty and satisfying, and while I'm not a celery fan (the flavoring is very celery-heavy), I can appreciate the uniqueness of this dish. The accompanying fries were delicious.\n3) Cioppino. A HUGE dish (would recommend sharing!), we couldn't even finish this. Loaded with seafood of all types, and surprisingly spicy. The bread, while good on its own, clashed flavor-wise with the rest of the dish.\n4) Sourdough bread pudding. Topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream, this one will make you kiss your diet goodbye. Warm and luscious, and definitely big enough to share. \n\nService: Slow, but friendly. Were a bit slow on refilling our water.\n\nAmbiance: A small place with low lighting, probably not the best for large groups but definitely a good date spot! I sat at the bar and it was just fine, but I'd recommend making a reservation.\n\nPrice: I'd put this one at $$$ rather than $$, personally. Was pricier than expected.", "author": "L H."}

It was creamy and flavorful. They gave lots of clams (they were most definitely NOT stingy about it). They gave a small bag of oyster crackers to add to the clam chowder. I loved every bite of it! Would def recommend.\n\n-Oysters $2.50 each: came on a basket of ice with some cocktail sauce. It was good and big, after eating 10 of these, my boyfriend wanted more!\n\n-Maine Lobster roll $22 for 3oz: what we came here for! I do agree with everyone else that we have good lobster roll. The bread roll was not as buttery as other places and they gave lots of lobsters. However, it was a lot smaller than I had expected. This is def only for one person to eat and not to be shared. After all the food we ordered, I was still hungry for more food but our total was already about $64 including tax but not tips, so it is a little pricey but it is seafood. I would go elsewhere for the lobster roll for bigger portions for about the same price.\n\nP.S. You can substitute the fries that comes with the lobster roll for onion rings for $2 extra but I thought it was worth it. It was super crispy but not burnt.

Funny that my review is right around the average - my experience was neither spectacular or terrible.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail, New England clam chowder, and lobster roll.  \n\nLast thing first - guys, I know skinny fries are traditional with a lobster roll, but it doesn't mean people like it or they're a good option.  I'd like to have seen some creativity here - anything besides frozen little fries that don't have much flavor.  The lobster roll was tasty, however.  The bun it was served on was particularly nice, toasted perfectly.  Good amount of lobster salad too, but for the price, I would expect it.  The shrimp cocktail had 4 prawns - was good but not great.  The clam chowder was also good, but not Maine/Boston good.  I've had richer, thicker, and chowders with more seafood in them, so it's not something I would necessarily come back for.  I might come back to try the salmon burger - we had already ordered enough and I still want to try it.   \n\nIn comparison to a similar place in New England, this place is more expensive and not quite as good.

This is a pretty small yet a clean cut restaurant. We got seated immediately (with the choice of counter or table seating) during lunchtime and had enough time to look at the menu and decide. My sister and I shared their fish tacos and the lobster roll.\n\nLobster roll: Definitely a must when coming here. Their lobster is super fresh and isn't too fishy-tasting, which is nice because it didn't give me a headache or made me want to gag. The bread they use for the sandwich is toasted, buttery, and fresh as well. Also, their sandwiches come with a small side of coleslaw and fries so you're bound to be full! Their lobster sandwich comes with the option of it being 3 oz. ($18) or 6 oz. ($28). We got the 6 oz. one but personally I think the 3 oz. would have been good between the both of us (we don't really each much anyways..)\n\nFish Tacos ($14): They comes in threes with limes on the side. Fish was delicious! And again, not too fishy or bad aftertaste. It wasn't too oily either. Great flavor too! It's kinda messy since they fall apart easily, but it's not a huge deal. I would recommend this as something to share between two people. \n\nOnly reason why I gave them four stars was the service. It took them a while to bring out the food, like about 15 minutes?

It was enjoyable, ample, and would have been 5-stars if the fish had been a little less \"done\".  The toasted bread served with it was \"pretty\" but had none of the flavor it suggested (butter, parsley, garlic?)  The sourdough bread for the table had been warmed up in the microwave (ugh!)  Overall, we enjoyed ourselves . . .   Not sorry about Swan's.", "author": "Vera P."}

The bread that came with it was deliciously buttery with the perfect crunch to it. My only complaint was the mayo base sauce on the lobster was on the heavy side.\n\nSoftshell crab with bacon lettuce and tomato- i expected more taste of their crispy softshell crab but the blt completley overwhelms the taste.\n\nBoth dishes came with fries and they were nice and crispy.

All tables were occupied so we put in our names, there were two couples ahead of us.  The hostess advised us it shouldn't be long as several tables are finishing up.  Four tables departed at once and the hostess seated the first two couples ahead of us.  Then the hostess sat a family of four who had come in after us!!  WHAT!!!  There was still an empty table for four available and NO ONE on the list after us.  When I went up to see how long it would be, thinking that she should give the two of us the open table, she said we would have to wait for a table of two to open up.  WHAT!!!  What kind of restaurant seats people out of order (with the exception of large parties waiting for several tables) ?!?!  So we sat waiting for a table of two to be come available, 15 minutes goes by, finally a table for two came available.  The open table for four stayed available for another 15 minutes, that's right, 30 minutes that table went unseated!!!  Very FRUSTRATING!!\n\nOur waitress provided average service.  She took our order, brought our food, and gave us the check.  The place was busy, so it was hard to get her attention when we needed things. Also when my husband asked if he could substitute the fries, she advised he could substitute with any side, he wanted a salad, she never bothered to tell him it would be an extra two dollars.  He didn't even like it the salad had way too much dressing.\n\nAs for the food.....\n\n**3.5 stars** for the clam chowder, better than average, good flavor, thinner consistency than your typical clam chowder.\n\n** 3 stars**  for the fried fish, fish was not bland which I like, but I didn't care that much for the batter.\n\n** 2 stars for the fries, a bit on the dry side\n\n** 3 stars** for the tartar sauce, homemade which was good, but it lacked a bit of flavor.\n\n**2 stars ** for the coleslaw, not impressed, very runny sauce\n\nWell it is always good to try somewhere new, but in this case it didn't pay off :(", "author": "Andrea B."}

She took her time sauntering around the dining room and staring at walls before finally coming to take our order 15-20 mins later (we had to flag the hostess down and tell her we were ready). Ordering went off without a hitch. We told her what we wanted and she wrote it down. She didn't come by our table again until it was time to bring out the food which she placed in front of me in a manner that brought back nostalgic memories from grade school and the lunch lady dropping my plate in front of me with disdain before screaming \"next!\" She also managed to write down two crab rolls instead of lobster rolls, but they were quick to fix the error. By the time we were done eating, we handed her out card and asked her to go ahead and ring us up for the bill. She must have forgotten because she proceeds to print out the check and bring it to us 30 seconds later...while she still has our credit card in her apron.

The bun and sides are the same. $19 for half or $32 for whole. Granted, it's good. But I don't know if it's *that* good. Dungeness is in season and local.

On top of that, the wait staff and hostess were friendly and attentive, despite having to deal with multiple parties waiting to grub on seafood. No missed guests here. No siree bob.\n\nTHE GRINDS:\n\nClam Chowder: I've had many a clam chowder in my day from canned to fresh, and this by far was the best I've ever had. The clams are thick, detectable pieces bathed in a thick, velvety cream and wine reduction sauce. Forget trying to soak the broth in oyster crackers. This soup is stand alone delicious.\n\nLobster Rolls: Had this been cheaper, I would have definitely grabbed the larger size.

Been to both this location and the one in the Castro - both good, though this place is more spacious. \n\nWhat I loved:\n- Steamed clams: they have it listed as a starter but the clams are huge and meaty and they give you a big portion. I would eat it as a meal alone next time. Best deal on the menu for $15. \n\nWhat I liked:\n- Lobster roll: Nice chunks of lobster. A tad too much mayo for my taste, but still pretty good. \n- Make your own Arnold Palmer! As someone who loves Arnold Palmers but find most premade ones overly sweet, I'm so happy you can customize the tartness and sweetness here. \n\nWhat disappointed:\n- The shrimp cocktail: my friend got this. 3 shrimp for $14?! No way. Better get a second order of those clams instead", "author": "Han Z."}

So after wandering around, we came here.\n\nMy friend and I tried the Make your own Arnold Palmer. It comes with a glass with ice and unsweetened lemon juice, with tea and liquid sugar on the side. My issue was that the lemon juice was literally just lemon juice, so it actually started tasting better when the ice melted...\n\nAs for the food, we shared an order of calamari, full lobster roll, and fries. The calamari was delicious! The batter was perfectly crispy and the calamari itself tasted fresh. I mean, it's a seafood place, it better have fresh calamari! The lobster roll was surprisingly filling. The lobster roll here comes undressed, without butter and cold. It' so simple, and it's perfect with a little squeeze of lemon. The french fries were good, too.\n\nThe wait was long, but it can be 100% attributed to the really incompetent hostess that was working there. She'd just sit at her hostess booth and take down everyone's name without any regard for the open spaces available already. Half of the restaurant cleared out before she even called a party, which just backed up the line. Letting people sit down all at once also makes the servers busier and backs up the kitchen. That's actually why a lot of restaurants, when they open, let in small groups at a time, so that they don't get busy all at once.

We didn't know what Ipswich clams where so we asked our waitress.  She described them as a cross between an oyster and squid.  The Ipswich clams were large, chewy and full of flavor.  If you can't decide between the Ipswich clams and the calamari, order the clams!\n*Cioppino - AMAZINGLY & DELICIOUS!!  Being allergic to fish, I'm not able to order cioppino at many restaurants because it contains fish or fish stock.  Woodhouse uses a tomato bisque broth and throws in mussels, bay scallops, clams, crab meat, a shrimp, and fish.  The bisque was extremely flavorful and has you wanting more bread. \n\nOTHER DISHES:\n*Clam Chowder - The chowder was good and contained diced potatoes, small chopped clams, and topped with a dash of chives.  We split a bowl of chowder among the three of us and it was a perfect serving size.\n*Fried Calamari - Good, but nothing special about it.  Both rings and legs were lightly breaded and deep fried and served with both a marinara and an aioli sauce.  \n*Crab Cakes - Not a fan.  The crab was bland and the crab cakes contained too much bell peppers, therefore it tasted more like a bell pepper cake (if there is such a thing).  More of the spicy chipotle sauce may have helped the dish.  I ended up only taking a few bites and passing the rest to my friend.   \n\nWHAT TO KNOW:\n*No reservations - on a Thursday night, we were given an hour wait time, however we were seated about 30 minutes later\n*Portions are decently sized - we had leftovers\n*Parking can be a bit difficult to find\n*Another location located on Market Street\n*Crabs are decently priced, but unfortunately they were out that day\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waitress was nice and double checked with the kitchen to make sure the cioppino broth did not contain fish.

I asked if he was down to have a lobster roll... the only thing is that we have to travel 1 mile to get there. My boyfriend was down, so we made the trip. What our tourist asses didn't know was that the 1 mile included some of the steepest hills in SF... and we traveled on foot... WITH BIKES.\n\nSo the adventure going to Woodhouse was hell for us.. but the lobster roll made it ALL WORTH IT. We got the lobster roll with fries, with extra lobster lol. $26 for one. My oh my.... the lobster roll was bangin. The lobster was so succulent and the seasonings were perfecto. And with lemon? Wow. The toasted brioche that was served with the lobster was also delicious. You would think the fries were just a filler but no... the fries were also very good. OMG. We savored every bite with inappropriate sounds. It was THAT good.\n\nOn top of that, service was friendly and the restaurant was pretty cool... it had this super East Coast nautical theme going on. \n\nOverall, we had such a yummy experience. Woodhouse will definitely be one of the first stops we visit when we come back to SF. Thanks!", "author": "Felicia L."}

I have to say the servers were very accommodating and friendly. They always had a smile on their face even when try brought the bad news that they were all out of lobster rolls for the night. But that was because we had a really late dinner. I think like 8:30 to 9. \n\nAnyways, I ended up ordering the dungeoness crab melt sandwich. The server said it's actually his favorite so I decided to switch. Pretty disappointment that I didn't get to try the lobster roll but the crab melt made up for it. The roll is about $2 cheaper than the lobster roll and filled with flavor and buttery goodness! It comes with crispy golden fries and cole slaw. I ordered a small and are everything! When the bill came I noticed a discount on the crab melt because we didn't get to have what we originally wanted. Which is definitely a nice gesture! \n\nI would definitely come back to try out the lobster roll.", "author": "Stephanie T."}

I always go for the perfect bite and use malt vinegar with tartar sauce after squeezing fresh lime.\n\nSecondly, the french fries are well seasoned and since they are thin cut they are crunchy throughout.

It was a little pricey ($27) and the portion wasn't that big. But at least every clam and mussel was filled with meat, unlike many other places I've tried. It also had one large piece of crab, scallop, and fish in it as well. The soup (or sauce?) was delicious.

Other dishes to make note of are the creamy and clam-filled clam chowder, and the tasty and plentiful cioppino. A fun thing they also do is a create-your-own lemonade or Arnold Palmer, where they give you the simple syrup and iced tea so you can adjust the taste to your liking.

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, egg nog with brandy, fruit cake, honey glazed ham. These are holiday foods I would crave. But for someone reason right now I wanted fish! Seafood! When it's craving comes I have to satisfy it! So the Woodhouse fish company is what I decided on. An excellent choice I must say!\n\nThey had some delicious sounding stuff on the menu! Crab Stuffed artichoke, Cioppono, fish n chips, BBQ oysters, raw oysters, crispy calamari, crab cakes, lobster roll! What to choose?! I decided on the fish n chip and top split toast lobster roll! Delicious! The fish n chips was yumtastic. Big pieces of fish! Really flaky and full of fish! The breading was crisp and light. Dipped in the tarter sauce with a squirt of lemon OMG! Heavenly! The lobster roll was extra delicious! A buttery toasted roll split on top and stuffed with sweet refreshing lobster chunks! Another squeeze of lemon just brings it to another level of flavor town! \n\nFor dessert I tried the sourdough bread pudding and that was amazing too! Served hot, surprisingly the sourdough bread had a nice sweetness to it with a hint of sourness at the end, very different! This is an excellent place to have lunch or dinner. The ambience is friendly, the restaurant itself is charming, not huge but comfortable. Most definitely a place I will be coming back to again for my seafood!", "author": "Roger P."}

They've got to be award winning here. \n\nSpeaking as a clam chowder and lobster lover, Woodhouse Fish Co. did not fail to deliver me the goods. Kudos to them for meeting my high expectations for these specific food items. \n\nThe chowder was perfectly made in my opinion, and I so rarely say this for any joint that I go to. A variety of little details gone awry can easily make me frown when it comes to clam chowder. For instances: I hate when places are stingy and try to cheat you out of a properly proportioned chowder- such as when clams and potatoes are not in good ratio. I hate when places oversalt or under-season their chowder. I hate it if the clams are ever too mashed or not chewy enough. I hate when I have any reason to believe ingredients are not fresh. See, I'm rather picky, which is why I'm so thoroughly impressed by WFC for serving me what I believe is the perfect clam chowder. Amazing. Round of applause to you, WFC.\n\nAs for the lobster roll, I loved the roll even more than I loved the clam chowder. They pack in so much lobster meat, it made me feel like someone in the kitchen has a really big crush on me. Paying twenty dollars ain't no thang if you get a whole lobster served to you. Plus, with such a fresh take on the sandwich sauce, my happiness made me want to pay them forty dollars for the roll. Jk, I wouldn't do that. I just walked away super thrilled that I got to eat a meal for half the price that it is worth. \n\n\nYes. I loved my meal. Thank you, Woodhouse Fish Co.", "author": "Mimi N."}

After Alecia comes back, I see a couple get up, and there's an empty table.  I asked if I could sit down.  She says, \"Well, I've already placed your order to go and we have people waiting for tables and that is a table for four.\"  She does not offer me a seat at the bar either.  The wait list is sitting before me, and turquoise marked lines are crossed out on all but one name.  Hostess moves from front to back of restaurant being busy, talks to guests at bar.  No one takes the table for four which are essentially, two tables pushed together.   Male host comes forward.  I asked if I could sit down pointing to obvious empty table.  He says, \"Um, sure, let me check.\"  I said, \"because she said someone was waiting for that table, and that is the reason I can't sit there.\" Checks with Alecia.  \"No, I'm afraid someone has spoken for that table.\"  I said, \"No one is waiting behind me, are they at the bar?\"  He says, \"well sometimes people go down the street to have a drink and they come back.\"  A couple comes in, asks for a table.  Sure, would they be willing to sit at the bar?\" \"Yes\"  Off they go.  No name is crossed from list.  Another table for 4 comes available.  Three adults come in, with a stroller and a baby.  They are seated at table of four. No name is crossed from list.  Another couple enters. They are escorted to the bar.  No name is crossed off the list.  Four people people come in.  They ask if a table is available.  The table that was first empty is given to them after I waited solo for ten minutes.  I recount my experience to the waitress, note I've stood patiently by, and watched 4 parties ahead of me seated, with no names crossed from list.  I tell her, I noticed, they came from the street and no names were crossed off the list.  I tell her to cancel my order and walked out.\n\nI have never been so humiliated.  I will never be back.

The oysters were super good and were served super-hot. A few minutes later the main dishes were on the table. Lobster roll was divine. The bread was perfectly toasted and buttered and there was a good amount of lobster. I ordered the small and was glad I did. I ate half and gave the other half to the BF.

It was the largest order for the roll. ($26). I'm glad I chose the 6oz because it was stuffed with huge chunks of lobster meat.

We were told that the wait for 45 minutes but there's a lot of bars/restaurants with bars on Fillmore so we just ducked into a spot down the street for a quick drink while we waited. \n\nRestaurant is pretty cozy so there aren't a lot of tables. They do have bar seating so there's always options of whichever seating opens up faster. The oysters didn't seem too fresh to me even though they were caught locally. Half of em didn't have any \"oyster liquor\" but it might be because I'm also eating them in a month that doesn't haven an \"r\" so that's why they're probably subpar. No complaints about the grilled oysters tho! Lobster rolls weren't anything to write home about either. Would rather drive down to Old Port for a more satisfying roll. \n\nOverall food was just mediocre, but the ambiance is good and service is attentive. They show an oyster farming documentary on loop against one of the walls of the restaurant which is cool to check out throughout your meal.

The beets offered a nice complement to the savory crab cakes, as well.  According to my fianc\u00e9, the lobster roll was very good, though he might've preferred a bit less lobster (I know what you're thinking - is he crazy?!), but sometimes you need just enough lobster so that it's not spilling out the side of the sandwich and you need just the right seafood:bun ratio.

All we saw and felt were the fibrous leaves so we peeled away the leaves and sucked on the bits of meat on each leaf. For $18, were we really going to leave an entire artichoke behind? It definitely wasn't worth just eating the bits of shrimp and crab meat! And so we sucked each leaf cleaned... and it was so much work for so little return.

Tip: Alaskan cod is what you want when it comes to deep-fried fish, and here it was tender, moist, and flakey from the first to the last bite. Equally important is the batter, and the breading on these fish and chips excelled. Crisp, not too bready or overly crispy, it was light and flakey like panko but finer and more dense. The seasoning was excellent (that is to say, not noticeable in a good way) leaving the quality of the fish and balanced crust to excel. Great fish to breading ratio and mouth feel. Two pieces was enough for a meal, even without the appetizer. \n\nThe crab was fresh but unremarkable and small. The server was polite but inattentive, to a somewhat frustrating degree. It was a slow 3pm, and he seemed more interested in distributing hot sauce bottles than checking on the several tables that needed his attention.

Massive chunks of seafood in a rich, slightly spicy tomato broth. Heavenly bread to sop up every last drop. Perched on top?  A huge portion of crab. I'm pretty sure the cluster of people by the door were not waiting for a table, they were all intently watching me elbows deep inhale the cioppino. I'd fly from Seattle again just for the cioppino. One of my favorite dishes I tried during my foodfest in SF.\n\nI tried the lobster roll too. I've never had one before and instantly fell in love- light, fresh, not too much mayo. On great chewy bread along with very addicting fries. Both dishes were pricey, but rightfully so. \n\nThe cons was having to wait for 15 minutes to be served drinks, just two beers. Coming off a plane, traveling to the restaurant, waiting for a table, finally ordering that first cold draft beer...and watching your server walk by your table empty handed for almost 15 minutes is kind of like a patron's torture.  Our food runner ended up bringing out the beers immediately. There may be my claw marks still on the table.\n\nPerhaps service would be better on a slower night, and maybe I'd enjoy it more being sat less close to our neighbors.

I usually come here for the lobster roll, but one faithful Sunday after a night of too much drankin I came here and couldn't pull my eyes off the ciopinno on the table next to mine.. Soo aromatic and the smell would taunt me so alas, I gave in to my heart's desire and got the cioppino instead of the lobster roll. \n\nBEST.DECISION.EVER. I love love love the cioppino. Greatest taste, mouthful of flavors, warm soupy goodness filled to the brim with so much seafood! Crab meat, mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp, and fish all swimming in my mouth. First bite I was blown away, second bite I was still blown away! Still thinking bout this from time to time.. my mouth was like a virgin, being touch for the very first time~ YUM. Definitely would order this again when I come back - the desire is no longer for the lobster roll but for this aquarium in a bowl! My only regret was that my friend and I decided we wanted a whole adventure in SF so I thought to myself - must save stomach space for all the food to come. So I packed up the other half of my cioppino for lunch the next day (though I desperately wanted to eat it). The nice waiter packed it up for me .... in a PAPER TRAY?! All I thought was how will this paper tray hold my precious cioppino.. but alas, it did and my precious made it home safely into the fridge. The next day when I opened it however, I saw that the tray was lined with a piece of aluminum foil and a lot of the soupy saucey goodness had evaporated... My heart cried a little inside. Woodhouse, get better trays for your wet foods! I still microwaved it for dinner and ate it like it was heaven on earth, though it tasted a little strange and not as delicious. Learned my lesson later that night when my stomach was hurting for hours. Eeek! No more day old cioppino for me !! I knew I should've devoured the whole thing in one sitting when I had the chance. So lesson here is: don't pack the cioppino to-go, just swim in the goodness until there is nothing left. Lick the bowl at the restaurant, don't bring home the paper tray.. it won't be the same.

I checked out the menu day prior and decided what to order. We came about 20mins after they opened for lunch so it was not crowded. Got seated by this girl who I didn't know was just the hostess. As we were seated, she made no mention that our waiter was going to come shortly. Since we already knew what we were going to order, I looked over to her where all the workers just muddled around the bar area to get her attention. She smirked and told the waiters that I was staring at her as if I was expecting her to serve us. What nerve! And she said it loud enough for us to hear even tho we were about 3ft from her. Talk about being tactful...there were none. \n\nOur waiter came, he was okay. No introduction...Not overly nice nor overly rude. Took our order of crab cakes, fried calamari, melted cheese crab sandwich, side salad and cup of white chowder. \n\nFood came fairly fast but not as hot as I liked with the exception of my soup. This was okay. My preference is to have hot temperature food. Calamari arrived first and it was disappointing. Oily and not fresh calamari. (I was told by a seafood chef that fried calamari should come without oil of any sort) The rings were rubbery and tentacles were few in between.  Salad was fresh but I didn't like the dressing. Tastes like Paul Newman dressing. Some people love Pauls dressing but I don't. But, The crab cakes were a hit! My gf is from New Orleans and she said it was the real deal without much breadcrumbs. Lastly, the melted cheese crab sandwich came...luke warm. One taste, I knew that crab was not fresh. The sandwich is a crab Po boy but grilled with a slice of cheddar. \n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed since I had better even in Redwood City off Veterans Blvd. But, anywhere on Fillmore gets raves by people who don't seem to get out of that area much. Since my buddy loves anything that is overpriced and to say he eats at eateries on Fillmore is beyond me. \n\nFor 58.30 for lunch to me is not worth the food and service that we received.

I went late at night around 10 and there was still a 20 minute wait but the staff was extremely friendly. Not only that but whenever my water cup was low...it got filled up. Amazing. \n\nBut let's keep going. The food. Superb. For a meal for two, we ordered the clam chowder, 8 oysters, calamari, lobster roll and a crab roll. Everything was good! I was craving calamari that day and it was a good portion which I was happy about. There were no complaints. I just want to go on about the crab roll...\n\n....where do I even start about this crab roll. I split the rolls for dinner and started with the crab roll. Good lord I didn't know seafood could taste like this. It was so good. The reviews on here say it's amazing...BELIEVE IT. I ate the lobster roll after the crab roll, don't get me wrong, it was still good but the whole time I was wishing I hadn't shared my crab roll and just ate it all to my selfish self. I even picked at the scraps of crab left on my plate like my dog when my food falls on the floor. It was honestly just great. The crab was so tender...so good...so flavorful...so majestic. If I could roll around and be stuffed in a room of this crab and eat my way through to freedom I would. \n\nDefinitely worth the try.", "author": "Alex J."}

That neighborhood has soooooo many restos, it's hard to select, but when my sweet friend G invited me to lunch for my birthday, this was my suggestion.  Parking was only slightly tricky, and when we arrived a bit before noon, it was about 85% full, but fortunately no wait for us.  The two tops are very tiny and crammed in there like, well, sardines.\n\nWe ordered 1/2 doz oysters to share.  They were very fresh tasting, but strangely lacking in the lovely liquor I like to slurp.  She got a wedge salad, and I copied her, even though I'm not always a fan, and was afraid it might be too much food with the rest of my order.  It was delicious.  The dressing was just the right amount, and perfect balance of blue cheese to liquid (in this application, I don't like the cheese to overpower) and not too thick.  The iceburg lettuce seemed as though it was a smaller than usual head, and the serving was about a quarter of it.  Not too large, so I thought I would still be able to stuff down the large lobster roll I ordered.\n\nShould have gone with the smaller version, but my love of the big bug, which I so rarely eat, lured me in.  So I concentrated on just the lobster, and left the roll - they always seem like hot dog buns to me, despite how New Englanders rave about them.  There was a huge amount (6 ounces) of lightly dressed, impeccably fresh lobster.  I loved it.  I wish I'd had more room for the fries which were well executed in the \"frites\" style.  G. had the dungeoness crab melt, which she devoured.

I went last night on a whim with some good friends from out of town. I couldn't think of other spots in the area that didn't need reservations. Plus, one of my friends was craving seafood so this was a must-try! \n\nWe (3 of us) got there around 8 PM. The hostess quoted us for one hour. We decided while wait we'd head to grab coffee nearby until it was time to return. We returned around 8:40 and as estimated, we were sat around 9. They put us at the counter which was not ideal, but hey, we were hungry! Luckily, the counter was spacious and the stools were comfortable (by the way, they have hooks under the counter in case you wanna hang your jacket, bag, or sweater). \n\nWe were quickly greeted with a server. She took our drink orders (I had a glass for pinot gris for $8. EXCELLENT... their house chardonnay is only $6 which to me is stunning since this is in/near Pacific Heights!). We also placed an order for calamari. The calamari was lightly battered and the rings were thickly sliced. FRESH. FRESH. FRESH, I tell you! And the accompanying sauces (a slightly spicy aioli and cocktail sauce) were delicious to dip the calamari in. I had the bay shrimp and avocado roll. My gosh. I can't think of the last time I had shrimp that plump, juicy, and NOT overcooked. They pretty much put a whole avocado in between this buttery, slightly sweet brioche (that was also grilled!). UGHHHH AHHHMAZZING. The slaw is fantastic as well. I don't usually like cole slaw, but it was slightly tart, not drenched in sauce, and wasn't super sour like some bad quality slaws out there. The FRIES make life worth living: crunchy and thin (but not matchstick thin). To me, given the neighborhood and the food options available, this was $13 and ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT. \n\nMy friend from Boston ordered the full lobster roll. I took a bite. Delicious. And as a former Bostonian, he wholeheartedly approved (that's some serious biz right there!). They also put a generous amount on the roll so it's definitely worth the $26 as well. My other friend ordered the crab cakes (3) and said it's one of the best he's had in awhile. \n\nService was fine. Not much to report. They were minimally attentive -- not in a negative way... the server didn't check up on us regularly and oftentimes we had to remind them for things like plates, new silverware, water refills... So if not for the \"meh\" service, I would've given Woodhouse 5 stars. (I still wish Yelp would allow for half-star ratings... because I personally feel it's more like 4.5 stars.) Ambiance... very nautical... very New England-ish (which my friend who lived in Boston appreciated). Anyway, in case you haven't stopped by, do that!

Well, actually...\n \nCan't decide like me?  Simple - convince your friend to get one while you get the other and share!  Done and done. \n\nOkay, seriously...when people talk about how great the Maine Lobster and Crab Rolls are here, it's no joke.  They really are that good.  Even the fries are terrific - nice and crispy!  Whether you choose the Lobster Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=pm3jXWAZfmH7eJ04y-dQVw#CW14rSIUVM_FPuLSMGSTmQ) and its huge chunks of deliciousness or the Crab Sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=pm3jXWAZfmH7eJ04y-dQVw#OnhNXD4qYSMihErn6LStpg) and its buttery crab flavor, you really can't go wrong.  The only reason why I might say the Crab Roll was slightly better is because I just generally like crab more.  Otherwise, they're both really good....and really big!  Each one is offered in small and large sizes, but after trying the 3oz Crab Roll and 6oz Lobster Roll, I'd say spring for the upsize.  The smaller one is probably good enough, but if you're already paying $17 or $18 for one, it might be worth it to kick in the extra $8 bucks to double up on the good stuff.\n\nAs much as I would love to round up Woodhouse to five stars for their sandwiches though, the Clam Chowder and Iceberg Louie Salad (with Shrimp) is why it's four stars instead.  Both were decent, but they were slightly flawed.  For the Louie Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=pm3jXWAZfmH7eJ04y-dQVw#KeKz8yTjGbbn2dlIxdwc6g), I loved how much shrimp they included, but we both thought the salad was a little salty and kind of heavy on the dressing.  As for the bowl of Clam Chowder (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=pm3jXWAZfmH7eJ04y-dQVw#k6pHrSQuCJCWIe4V9B7XhQ), it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't say it's the \"the best one ever\".  I liked the consistency/texture, but I wish it had more clams and flavor.\n\nRegardless, you'll probably see me sooner rather than later Woodhouse.  Not only is your seafood good, but your do-it-yourself Arnold Palmer is pretty cool (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=pm3jXWAZfmH7eJ04y-dQVw#A8sWN_9rCGYsIV2qOiL0_Q) and you seem like a nice place to bring date.

Staff are polite and attentive but not overbearing. Service is spot-on and appropriately quick.\n\nO: We ordered a (small) cup of Manhattan clam chowder ($7), which came with oyster crackers, and two entrees - fish tacos ($16) and a small Dungeness crab roll ($21 with cole slaw and fries). Limited selection of beers are $6-7. The food was fried and tasty, although the chowder was a bit too salty and quite a small serving for $7. The fish tacos were delightful, simple, and fresh, but seemed to be a re-hashed version of \"fish and chips\" without the fries and, rather, served in a corn tortilla with avocado and a chipotle mayo. Nonetheless, the three tacos were quite filling and did hit the mark. The crab roll was fresh, not too fishy, and also quite filling.\n\nA/P: Service is perfect. The food is good but is almost too simple for the price, even for fresh seafood. Even so, I would up-rate this place to 4 stars given it's freshness, balanced plates, quick and clean service, and polite staff. Definitely recommended to anyone who is not afraid of gaining a couple pounds from these fried foods. The only gripe is that the price is a tad too high for the food.\n\nOverall rating: 3.5.

Though we were both pretty hungry starting out, we ended up having to box the fish and chips up virtually untouched.  \n\nWhat we didn't realize was that many of the dishes came with generous serving of vegetables, such a nice surprise in this day and age when a dish is described to you in such detail that you are totally disappointed when you ended up with only a tiny bite of it.  The squid, for example, came in a skewer chockfull of tender meat on a bed of spinach cooked in such pungent olive oil it makes me wish for it again now.  The artichoke entr\u00e9e was a generous portion, sitting on top of a beautiful salad mix.  The cheese bread that accompanied the dish was so tasty that my partner, who normally tries to stay away from carbs, finished her piece before I even had a chance to taste mine.

We'd be that much closer to peace, prosperity, the end of global warming, and really good shellfish. I was already a big fan of the one on Market Street because they serve world-class lobster rolls in a faux-rustic setting that definitely has the Cape Cod shack vibe to it. The Fillmore location reflects the upscale customer base that can be found traversing this neighborhood in their Skechers. I thought the Restoration Hardware touches would diminish the appeal of Woodhouse but not really when the food is this good. \n\nWe came on a Wednesday evening before the Morcheeba concert at the nearby Fillmore. It was already fairly well-packed in there, but in the nick of time, we landed one of the tables for two in the front. Apparently, the emaciated, tailored-looking matrons at the table next to us didn't think of us as fit company for dining neighbors and promptly asked the waitress if they could be moved. Good riddance. May you always avoid undesirable people from your life and end up old, wrinkled and bitter. Oh wait... too late. The waitress herself was nice and not at all overbearing. Thank the seafood gods.\n\nJamie W. and I immediately split a $7.50 bowl of the Creamy New England Clam Chowder, which was pure, thick ambrosia speckled with chopped chives on top (see photo). Clams were plentiful and potatoes were used quite sparingly, just the way I like it. I was hoping to lick the bowl, but the two busybody matrons were still sitting next to us at the time. For my entree, I was predictable and went for the $26 Split-Top Maine Lobster Roll with Fries and Slaw (see photo). Yes, $26. I realize that's pricey, but I consider it an investment granted a short-term one with minimal return. But immediate gratification is important at times. OK, all the time. The upside is that the roll is just as richly delicious as the one you can get at the Market Street location. \n\nJamie got more bang for his buck with a $13 order of the Fish & Chips, three good-size pieces of Anchor Steam beer-battered Alaskan cod that came with quite a pile of shoestring potatoes underneath and a soupcon of fresh tartar sauce (see photo). The pieces were so tender-crispy that I could have had a side order of that as well. Bottom line, I was just thrilled the food didn't disappoint here. While the place was abuzz with diners savoring their food, I was able to appreciate some of the offbeat decorating choices like the framed flatscreen that showed a streaming video of a fisherman's life in the Bay Area. \n\nFOOD - 5 stars...just as stellar as its Market Street twin and oh, that lobster roll \nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...nicer finishes here \nSERVICE - 4 stars...very friendly and helpful...handled difficult customers like the two old biddies with elan \nTOTAL - 5 stars...Woodhouse scores again...is a third SoMa location coming up...please?", "author": "Ed U."}

Oh my goodness, it's deliciously addicting good. Mmmm. For around $19, it's pricey but it's not that bad. Compared to LobsterMe in Vegas, their small lobster roll is around $18 with no sides.

It had plenty of meat in it, but overall it was lacking some seasoning.  I dumped a ton of salt in it, which made it a little better, but definitely not worth 7 bucks for a cup.

I was outnumbered so I reluctantly agreed. \n\nAnd boy, did my appetite get activated from the moment I sat down. I know it's going to sound like I got paid to write this review, but let me just make clear: I didn't. Woodhouse is just this good.\n\n#1: The clam chowder is phenomenal here- not too heavy or salty. The potato bits were tender and melted in your mouth. There was the perfect proportion of clams to soup. If anyone ever asks me where to get clam chowder in SF, I'm directing 'em all here.\n\n#2: I had the best oyster po' boy of my entire life here. Sometimes the fried oyster pieces are too heavy on the cornmeal; here, they were perfect and flavorful yet not overly greasy. And they came accompanied by fried pork belly (a surprisingly tasty pairing), jalapenos and fresh coleslaw.\n\n#3: The lobster rolls are freakishly good. I actually just ate a bunch of lobster rolls last month when I was up in Maine, but ... (and Maine residents will probably kill me for saying this) this one was superior. And I'll tell you why: the secret is in the bread. A lot of the Maine renditions had insanely fresh, yummy lobster filling, but the bread was sweet and soft and meh. Here, it's crispy yet has a lot of pull. It made all the difference.\n\nPS We came on a Sunday afternoon. There was a line out the door but don't be deterred. We put our names on the list -- the hostess explained they didn't call or give out buzzers, but names are never crossed out so you could come back whenever. We went across the street to shop at Steven Alan, came back after 30 minutes and our table was ready. So smart, and so seamless.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

The fish and chips and the fish tacos were both fried with a thin battering, and the fish was so flakey and moist. \n\nBUT, when it came to the end of the meal, there was a pool of oil in the fish and chips that rendered half of the chips inedible. As we got down to the bottom of the bowl, the fries became so saturated with oil, that a slight squeeze would make oil drip all over your fingers. So we informed the waitress about the issue, since my partner used to work at a kitchen in the past and knew the process after deep frying is to drain the oil either on parchment paper or by shaking it off to not leave a cup of oil in the serving tray.\n\nMy problem wasn't with the nasty feeling in my stomach I had at the end of meal staring at a pool of oil, but rather the way the waitress handled the situation on a relatively idle day. We had said \"There seems to be a lot of oil at the bottom of the fish and chips and we can't eat the rest of the chips.\" In which she responds, \"Well everything is fried, the fish is fried, the chips are fried\".. as she says this she walks away to go do something else.\n\nThis problem could have been easily remedied with even the smallest apology, but because of the poor service, and haphazard mistake of the cook, the nasty, greasy feeling in my stomach this place gives me will never go away.", "author": "Fiona Y."}

The weather finally turned back to a nice, normal, windy SF-appropriate temperature, so I decided that Monday night would be the day that I would get my clam chowder. The boyfriend likes the Manhattan stuff and I'm fond of the New England one, so I had assumed we'd have a bit of a showdown in this small restaurant next to Fraiche.\n\nBut then we saw that there was fish and chips. So instead of having that showdown, we agreed on a cup of New England clam chowder (aw yiss) and a set of fish and chips for us to share.\n\nNow, I'm not a chowder aficionado. There was just a period of time as a child where all I'd agree to eat was clam chowder out of a can, so I thought that Woodhouse's was freakin' amazing. I still preferred the stuff from one of the many places on Pier 39 or Monterey, of course, but this was still excellent. And they serve it with your choice of crackers or sourdough bread. Boyfriend wanted crackers. I wanted bread. And the waitress was like, yeah, np, man. And that was good. But the boyfriend, who has been all over the US, decided that the clam chowder was just okay. Take that as you will; he went to uni in Boston.\n\nThe fish and chips, though. Oh my gosh. One of the tastiest, classiest, and amazingly barely-greasy-at-all fish and chips I have ever had. The fish was perfectly cooked and had such a light, wonderful flavor. What was it even fried in!? Was it fried!? And the chips that came with it were kind of like getting only the perfectly crunchy ones from McDonald's. I am a peasant, okay? I don't know how else to describe those so-called shoestring fries - they looked like McDonald's fries but were five bajillion times tastier.\n\nTo round off this lovely cold-weather meal, we got the sourdough bread pudding. I have never had proper bread pudding before. The boyfriend loves bread pudding. He approved. I proceeded to try and eat as much of it as I could because it was so rich and wonderful, but also very hot, so I basically ended up burning my tongue in an attempt to make sure I got some bread pudding before he ate it all.\n\nOverall, this is definitely a place I'd go to again if I'm feeling extra-fancy for fish and chips. Going here is more than just sating a craving - it's feeling really, really good about it too, and being very satisfied in the end.", "author": "Robbin A."}

From New England clam chowder to freshly shucked oysters to gourmet grilled fish, I love it all and pity those with seafood allergies for missing out on such a tasty part of life. \n\nLucky for me, the people at Woodhouse Fish Company seem to share this passion for las frutas del mar. I came here with some coworkers on a sunny weekday for lunch and though we were warned that the place gets packed, we were fine for an early meal and got a table right away for four. I tasted a bunch of things, from the crab cakes to the lobster roll to the fish tacos, and I gobbled up every last bite of everything with relish. It's hard to pick a favorite but I'd say probably the fish tacos, which were perfectly battered and crispy with a very fluffy, delicious fish inside (I can't remember what kind). \n\nMy only hesitation from giving it a full five stars is that the menu isn't especially inventive. But then again, I don't think that's what this place is going for. They're more about mastering those classic dishes that you crave.

Golden, crispy, crunchy and with a slight cornmeal flavor. Almost like corn dog batter.

We both had the fish and chips and just ripped into them when they arrived because they were so good, Huge servings, you can order 2 or 3 pieces. Two pieces are more than enough, neither one of us was able to finish our meal. The service was good too. The guy at the table next to us was having the lobster roll and it looked superb.

With that dorkus managing to reach the City only around 9:20pm even though the flight landed at 7:15pm, the list was further reduced by one and my eight-ball decided \"Woodhouse\" it'd have to be for the night. \n\nWe arrived with about a half-hour to spare and settled down to a drink and steamed garlic shell fish (we chose mussels over clams) with the french fries option. The fries were really well made and crispy on the outside. The steam garlic mussels too were really good with that garlicky \"broth\" offering a fine backdrop of flavor. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=m5SJ-8pWVvuel7PStQzHJQ)\n\nI was initially going for the seafood cioppino but was steered away by my friend who's allergic to crustaceans and on asking for options was notified of the special; a sauteed sturgeon with risotto. I immediately did an about turn and two \"suateed sturgeons\" it was for the entree.\n\nThe two pieces of sturgeon was pretty good though I'd say the flavors on the fish were pretty subtle; which may be the nature of the fish. The risotto looked like a cous-cous based risotto; I prefer the rice based risotto. I wish the fish was as rich as the risotto in flavor.\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=B-VKqs_AY7qqLN8RI7DVEw)\n\nIt was pretty good but I will have to try another dish before I can think about rating it a 4-star.

Ironically, I like Woodhouse because it is not very San Franciscan, it's very East Coast.  The lobster roll, fish and chips, crab Louie, Oysters, and fish entrees NEVER FAIL to please.  Woodhouse seems to have a very discerning eye over the QUALITY OF WAITERS they have, who are great at their jobs.  \n\nEven friends from all over love me for taking them here.  Last, I am so happy this place isn't just another San Francisco seafood restaurant that's run down, grimy, and priced at triple its worth.  It would be all too easy to fall into line with some of the \"famous\" San Francisco seafood restaurants, especially ones along the pier (any of them). \n\nWoodhouse Fish Co. has struck the perfect balance: where you order seafood and get a lot of that seafood, proportional to the dish; the practice elsewhere is a very expensive, pleasantly displayed  2-4 oz size of seafood disguised by leafy greens and terrible spices for $30.  \nThe Woodhouse Clam Chowder is butter and tasty.  The Woodhouse Fish Co. has all kinds of fresh Oysters.  The Fish and Chips are light, flavorful, fluffy, with no fishy taste.  The crab louie is sweet, and if you hate crab, you'll love it after the salad.  I don't review drinks, but that's because the choice is simple: always get an Anchor Steam with all your dishes.\n\nThe Market location absolutely needs to stay open longer (till 10:30 even), I often choose not to go at all because it gets close to 8, and Market/Church closes at 9:30, but then there's always Fillmore Woodhouse.", "author": "Xander M."}

Not sure if I was there on a bad night or not, but the food is mediocre at best. The price they charge for the quality and taste of their food is outrageous. Below is a list of what we ordered: \n* Fried Calamari - Batter was flavorless. Came with two different sauces, basic cocktail sauce and the other I'm not sure what it was but it was gross. Skip this. \n* Clam Chowder - Barf. No flavor. Skip this. \n* Fish and Chips - Came with three good size pieces of fish. The fish had a nice crunch on the outside and was flaky and moist on the inside.  Tartar sauce was homemade and tasted good. Fries tasted like they were the frozen type (would expect fresh cut fries at a place like this). The coleslaw is bad, bad, bad. Try this if you like fried fish.  \n* Lobster Roll - One of my friends ordered this. He said it was not the best lobster roll he's ever had, but not the worst. Said he's had much better for like half the price, but the roll it came in tasted good. Also came with fries and coleslaw. Try this at your own risk. \n* Oyster and Pork Belly Po'boy - Other friend ordered this, it was a daily special. She said the oysters were deep fried crisp, but was tender and juicy inside. The bread was the same as the lobster roll, which she said was soft and toasted to perfection. Also came with fries and coleslaw. Try this. \nAll in all, the food kind of lacked flavor. The person working the deep fryer definitely knows what he's doing, as everything was cooked perfect. Noticed other tables ordering other items, so maybe try those things. They need to either lower their prices, or get a better chef.", "author": "Reid C."}

I'd definitely get here on the earlier side since they don't take reservations.\n\nThe menu is short but sweet and offers something for everyone. I'm not big on oysters but my boyfriend and his friend are. They ordered a half dozen oysters, which were Blue Point oysters, and also another half dozen of oysters that were offered as a special that day. They were very fresh and they definitely enjoyed them! Try oysters from different locations so you get different flavors. We also ordered the Fried Whole Belly Ipswich Clams which were crispy on the outside and very juicy on the inside. \n\nFor our main dishes, we ordered:\n\n-Anchor Steam Beer-Battered Fish & Chips (2 pieces): I loved the batter! The outside was very crunchy and crispy and the inside was very juicy and flavorful. My only complaint was that it was a little on the greasy side.\n-Toasted-Buttered Dungeness Crab Roll (Half): The crab was fresh and very sweet and buttery. I liked the bread! The half size portion is a good size.\n-Half Dungeness Crab in a white wine, garlic, and butter sauce: This is what our friend ordered and he loved it. He said it had tons of flavor and loved the wine sauce. The only downside is that it is a little messy!\n\nI really enjoyed our dinner at Woodhouse Fish Company - the food was great and extremely flavorful and fresh, our server was very knowledgeable and always checked up on us.

I got the crab cakes and was very hesitant, but the waiter told me how they made them and said there was more crab in them than other ingredients.  They were fantastic.  I compared them to the ones I had in Maryland and these were better.  Light and crispy and again, the crab so fresh.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant.

Walk-in's ONLY and during prime time, the wait can easily be well over an hour. Whatever, I've waited almost 3 hours for Boiling Crab, an hour ain't nothing, and especially when our group of 5 is happily killing time browsing through Woodhouse's photo gallery on Yelp and painstakingly thinking what to order. (I wanted that lobster roll more and more by each passing second!)\n\n(I apologize for the low-qual photos.

(see photo -- compared the oysters with the lemon wedge).

I'm a huge fan of clam chowder so I definitely had to order the bowl (all for myself). The chowder was very creamy, chunks of tatters, and spoonfuls of clams in each bite! This was the highlight of my dinner, and Woodhouse's redemption for their diminutive sized oysters! Shoot, I wanted to lick my plate cleeaannn! \n\nSplit-Top Maine Lobster Roll - http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=iNU0KoU4Rx77r18u2A7TRw&userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\n\"Oh baby! here it is.. my 6oz lobster roll! wait, that's it..?\" \nThe roll came with a cup of house slaw (meh) and a palette of crispy (yet frozen) fries. The lobster roll itself, was loaded with a good handful of lobster meat, but was terribly unseasoned. Each bite was just filled with a mouth full of cold bland lobster meat.. The amce roll was nice and toasty though and thankfully, the trusty Tabasco and pepper shaker was close in hand to dowse the lobster, but I must've of hyped myself up for failure because $26 for a tasteless lobster roll just doesn't cut it.\n\nMaybe I came on a non-lobster-rollish day or maybe I somehow got an unseasoned handful of lobster meat from their batch but whatever it may have been, it wasn't worth it. Our parties orders wasn't spectacular either: the Baja Fish Tacos were comparable to Rubio's Fresh Mex's fish tacos, the Dungeness Crab legs were overcooked (it's the second time my friend ordered it, and the second time they've overcooked it), and the Toasted-Buttered Dungenness Roll could have been butterier. \n\nFor the hefty price I'm paying, I was expecting some damn food seafood, seafood that could rival some of my favorite fine dining restaurants, but it just wasn't happening.

Around $10-$20 depending on what item you get. \n\nSPLIT TOP MAINE LOBSTER ROLL $18: BIG and I mean BIG fat chunks of fresh lobster meat that did not disappoint. Absolutely fresh and delicious. Probably one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had.\n\nCRAB MELT $12: This was also bomb. Good chunks of crab meat and fresh meat. So good.\n\nBUTTERED BREAD on the roll/melt: WOW, how did they make this? The bread had the perfect amount of softness with a nice toasted crunch on the outside. The butter was not overwhelming at all and balanced the freshness of the seafood so well.\n\nFRENCH FRIES: This is what I call a bomb french fry! Skinny, perfectly crisp and well-seasoned. They know how to make 'em good! Possibly one of my favorite fries. \n\nCOLESLAW: Once again, fresh, refreshing and not overwhelmingly mayo-filled like most slaws. \n\nFYI: Refreshing, fresh and delicious seafood.

They give you options where you can choose how many ounces of lobster you want (I think it was 2 oz vs 5 oz) and how many crab cakes you want.

The kitchen is open so you can hear everything that goes on. Let's start with the crowded restaurant and extremely small space, open loud kitchen, smacking the plates every 5 seconds in the kitchen, the heat level inside the restaurant( only one window is open and the AC is hardly on). \nThe food is alright, you can definitely find better. The fish and chips was overly cooked the batter tasted burned. We received the food before our appetizer, which was pointless to get to begin with. The calamari was overly battered and fried. Was not juicy, soft and tinder. But it was hard, crispy and over chewy. I found better food all over the fisherman wharfs than this place. Avoid the mess and the noise and go somewhere better with more options, better price and less noisy.", "author": "Tete J."}

Thankfully, that night was a Tuesday night, where there are $1 oysters!  As expected, it was a little busy and told the wait would be about 20 minutes.  It was actually a bit quicker since we were open to sitting at the counter.  Our waiter was really friendly and gave us good pointers and recommendations.  We ordered a half dozen oysters, the large lobster roll, and 3 crab cakes.  \n\nThe oysters were good.  I'm not much of an oyster fan, but they were pretty creamy and not too fishy...  the wife is the big oyster fan in the family!  The crab cakes were pretty good, not the best we've had, but not bad at all either.  We really enjoyed the lobster roll.  It was amazing except for the $26 price tag.  \n\nI was torn between 3 and 4 stars for this place, so I'd give it a solid 3.5.

I know seafood is pricey, even in the bay, so I don't really have an issue with their price point. \n\nWe had the local squid and the daily whole fish,which was some type of sea bass. The squid was great, perfect texture and well seasoned. The fish was good too, just not enough for two to split. Which for $32, we hoped it would be. Oh and the seasoning seemed to essentially be the same for both. No big deal. We then ordered a side of slaw, which fortunately or unfortunately was the star of the show. \n\nUpon leaving, we noticed some dishes that looked much bigger and AWESOME.

It is very bright even on a gloomy day in SF. Clean and has wooden tables, booth seating, and bar seating like at Swanson Depot. I think the most interesting decoration there is a large LCD mounted on the wall inside a classic frame. It looks like a window to the outside world. Or a living portrait. The TV broadcasted some video that looked like live feed from the Half Moon Bay. I thought this was a very clever d\u00e9cor and matched perfectly with the restaurant. \n\nOrdered: \n\n* Lobster Roll 3 oz $18 OR 6 oz. $26 (4 of 5) - yummy! 3 oz is pretty filling. I think 6 oz choice is overkill, but if you are up for the challenge GO FOR IT! The lobster filling was fresh and light. There was some chopped celery mixed-in to add texture. I liked it. It was light on mayo and fresh on lobster. I also really enjoyed the thick Texas bread slit in the middle to create a pocket that held the lobster filling perfectly. I strongly recommend ordering this 3 oz roll when you are the restaurant.\n\n* Maryland Soft Shell Crab BLT $14 (3.5 of 5) - the lobster roll tasted just a little better. Definitely, this was also a great creation. The soft shell crab was fried perfectly and placed in the bread slit accompanied by his friend, the bacon, lettuce, and tomato. Too bad, the bacon's taste slightly overcastted the soft shell crab's taste. The soft shell crab was also a little oily compared to the lobster roll. And it made a bigger mess when you bit into the BLT and the tomato started to divide. This was really good, but the lobster roll was just a little better tasting and better executed. \n\nChoices of raw oyster when we went were listed on the blackboard and listed below:\n\nSkookum is from Washington $2EA \nBlue Point is from Connecticut $2EA \nKumamoto is from California $3EA \n\nI don't remember much, but at the end, I think the Kumamoto was smaller in size and pricier, but they were the better tasting and had a sweeter finish.", "author": "Janice T."}

So in doing so, my hat's off to this delicious eatery. It's a cool spot.\n\nI had the dungenness crab roll/sandwich. I took a cab down here from my hotel because some of the reviews said it was mind-blowing. I personally didn't think so, but I enjoyed it! I found the taste a little simplistic. I think the choice of bread/roll could have been much better, but I thought it was good. And its always hard when people rave about anything; sets the bar too high. \n\nService was impeccable. Busy, but food came out timely. Really cool decor, loved it.\n\nHere's my only thing, and it has nothing to do with star rating, but it may unfortunately be for some people and thus should be taken into consideration by management: \n\nI sat solo at the bar top waiting for my food to arrive enjoying the ingenious portrait/TV on the wall that showed all the beautiful views of San Francisco. Landscapes, aerial views, etc. Really stunning. My food arrives, and almost as if it were timed comedically, the TV shifts from gorgeous local landscapes to fishermen catching the crab and preparing them for slaughtering. I'm a pretty compassionate person so I was sitting there watching as trash bins filled up with barrels and barrels of live crabs, desperately trying to fight for their lives, as more barrels of crabs toppled on top of them, and, needless to say, I didn't finish my sandwich. And a few minutes later it shows the crabs in the bins being wheeled onto the dock, but they're damn near lifeless because they've given up on living at this point and realize their approaching demise. It all sounds funny but I found it really sad and a bit crude actually. It'd be like going to a steakhouse and having a huge TV screen in front of you showing the cows being lined up for slaughter. Appetizing? But, again, I don't feel thats anything to do with service and taste so I didn't grade with that in consideration.

Two staff members tried to explain to me how busy the kitchen was even though I sat there and watched the chef and his line cook stand there with nothing to do, literally waiting for someone to tell them to go ahead and prepare our entrees. Someone finally realized something was wrong and all of a sudden there was a rush to get our food out. The line chef couldn't stop smirking at me throughout the meal. I must admit that by the end of the meal I was tired of this random guy in the back of house staring me in the eye and smirking every time I looked up. We finished our food in a hurry ready to pay. \n\nI asked why things took so long and had a food runner lie to me first, my waitress came over at that point and initially tried to tell me that the kitchen was just busy until I told her that I had seen everything. At this point she informs me that the this (not sending entrees for an hour?) has happened before and she would talk to the manager about it. He comes over and initially offers to take off one of our lobster rolls. I tell him that it isn't about the money. I just want someone to be honest with me about what had occurred and I don't like the idea of being lied to. At the end of it we still get the run around and he takes off the calamari ($16) rather than one of the lobster rolls ($28). I paid and left. \n\nIf the kitchen had been swamped and our food took four hours then that would have been fine. The fact that I watched them stand around and do nothing while I was sitting there waiting for my food is not OK. Lying to a customer about the situation is not OK.

Here however, the whole meal was perfect. I also got to taste a little bit of the stuffed artichokes and i give huge thumbs up on that meal. Artichokes were perfectly cooked and marinated with the crab and shrimp thats in it. \n\nWait time was around 45min. The restaraunt is small so the place can get really busy at times. Service was good but not great. Overall, i would come back again", "author": "Lauren A."}

And everything we had ordered was AMAZING. \n\n1. Clam Chowder- the best! It's soo good! Clam Chowder is one of the few things I look for in a seafood restaurant because a lot of times, it can be too rich with too much cream in their recipe or too much filling of other ingredients (potatoes, vegetables, etc) and not enough clam, or the clam in the soup can be bad quality and chewy. BUT this one was just SPOT ON! Not too thick, perfect consistency, perfect clams, perfect ratio. \n\n2. Calamari- Again, really good! calamari is also something I look at because it's really easy to either use bad-quality calamari that turns out chewy and flavorless or just too much breading. Woodhouse's calamaris are just so soft and the breading is really light and airy so it's just perfectly crisp! LOVED IT. \n\n3. Clams in White wine & Garlic- If I had to be somewhat disappointed in anything we got that night, it's probably this one, BUT DONT GET ME WRONG: it was STILL really good. The only reason I would say I'm disappointed is because for the price, we didn't get too many clams. But dipping the garlic bread in the sauce was really good so I guess it still turned out alright!\n\n4. LOBSTER ROLL- OMG IF YOU ARE GOING TO COME HERE, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS. IT'S LIKE A SIN TO COME TO WOODHOUSE AND NOT ORDER THE LOBSTER ROLL. the lobster is SO fresh, SO soft and tender but extremely meaty, AND BEST OF ALL, it's not completely DRENCHED in sauce, which for me can be a turn off. The bread is perfectly soft and airy and buttered and toasted. omg, seriously, words only just continue to make this item underrated. I just can't explain verbally how amazing this dish is! Even the fries that come with it are good!! I would literally make the journey all the way to SF just to eat this. It's THAT good. \n\nEven on top of all that, our waitress was so nice and so attentive, which is never bad! It can be a little be pricey, but for the quality and execution of the seafood dishes, it's TOTALLY worth the money. WILL BE BACK AGAIN SOON. ugh, salivated as I was writing this.", "author": "Judy B."}

The large is packed full of so much lobster it's nuts.\n\nThis time, I had a Dungeness Crab Melt which was okay, but... just not that flavorful. \n\nMy friend and I also had the shellfish appetizer which was good. No complaints there - the clams were large and delicious. Just don't expect \"garlic bread\" when you ask for garlic bread - it's more like cheese bread.\n\nLastly, I would like to point out a peeve of mine: any restaurant that makes onion rings with panko flakes (or fish n' chips) isn't doing it right. Panko should only be used for katsu, and that's about it. Recommendation: don't order their onion rings. They're panko onion rings.", "author": "Cameron W."}

We decided to give it a try. \n\nThere is a lot of light coming from the the front entrance, which makes the the room look cozy. I like the wall decor and wood-centric furnitures.

The shrimps were fresh, which well balanced with the intricate richness of the avocado.

Not this bad-boy! Bread is very important in any sandwich and this place has nailed it with their roll. It's buttery, toasted and perfect. The lobster meat is sweet, fresh and delicately coated with mayo. It's one of the best things I've ever placed on my taste buds. And that halibut--light, flavorful, fresh and placed on pesto coucous. Now, I'm usually not a pesto fan, but I would be if every other pesto tasted like this! It was all topped with heirloom tomatoes in a vinaigrette and scarfed in literally minutes.  \n\nBeyond all the delicious noms from the sea, their service was great!

People were being asked to wait 10 minutes and put their names of the list, go window-shopping first the come back.\n\n5:15 PM: (APPETIZER)\nWe got our appetizer of ROCK SHRIMP CROQUETTES W/ POLENTA CAKE.  Delish! The polenta was the smoothest I've had. The croquettes were crispy on the outside and nice with big pieces of rock shrimp on the inside. This was a main dish but we decided to share as an appetizer. ($17) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=TWm_7KaoUhvuH7CFSLq7cg\n\n5:15 pm, 5:30 PM, 5:45 PM.....(DECOR)\nAdmired the decor. Woodhouse is nautical: huge fish art pieces are suspended on the walls such as a giant blue marlin and giant squid with long tentacles. Model toy boats line the shelves. A rustic bar is at the far end of the restaurant. The ceiling is ornate and high.  The whole place has a whole rustic fishmarket feel to it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=zj0taFfcjrtCzB70k8d-MA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=cqh_hhQPo-KJvXGWD6_7hQ\n\nStill no food after almost an hour. We amused ourselves by taking pictures of one another.  Fried food started to come out. We were the very first ones there but we still haven't gotten our  food along with others. We wondered if the chef was late for work today.\n\n6:00 PM: (MAIN)\nAn hour later and fiance was suffering from hunger pangs. Our food finally came out;\n\nARTICHOKES STUFFED WITH CRABMEAT AND SHRIMP W/ CROSTINI:  My guy really enjoyed his dish and labored through each artichoke leaf until he was rewarded with the artichoke heart. The shrimp and crab were very fresh.  ($18)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=_0daxx3EHx9PLBMrrQZK5g\n\nCRAB CAKES ON GREENS: I enjoyed my crabcakes which were crispy on the outside; creamy and packed with crabmeat on the inside. Definitely a generous crabcake and not a fake one with nothing but fillers. The salad was refreshing and lightly dressed. ($12) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PFk6k_hEGG0n6_FAJSm9EQ?select=XZtfu5uNB1TJKdrv3E8EzQ\n\nSAUTEED VEGGIES: Good choice! I didn't know that my guy ordered this. The sauteed green beans, carrots and broccoli in butter complimented our seafood dish. ($6)\n\n6:35PM (SOCIAL SCENE/AMBIANCE)\nOur friendly but busy server gave us our check. The restaurant was packed with people waiting. Some are with kids in stollers. This is a family-friendly and casual date place restaurant.\n\nBOTTOMLINE: 3.5 Stars for food and unreasonalby long wait.\nCharming neighborhood  seafood restaurant. Trustworthy place for fresh good quality seafood. The flavors are not multi-dimensional enough and would benefit from more spices but solid. \nDoes not accept reservations. Prepare to wait or come early. Super-super slow service. \n\nTAB: $71 including bubbly H20, tax and 20% tip.\n\n6:40 PM:\nPIcked up our reserved ticket for \"The Source Code.\" Then tried to  catch the tail-end of  Cherry Blossom Festival but it was over. Woodhouse made us miss it. Booo!!!!\n\n6:50 PM:\nShared a BANANA ICE CREAM CREPE at Sophie's Crepes at the J-Town Mall.  I also bought mochis and onigiri at Kissako Tea to sneak in to the theater later.\n\n7:20 PM:\nDrink at Kabuki Bar and Bistro before the movie.\n\n7:40 PM:\nWatch \"The  Source Code.\"  A movie about violence (not graphic) but ended on a beautiful note and friendships with strangers.

From there, we each got a Louie (crab for NJ, shrimp for me) and shared a basket of fries.  The Louies were simple and pretty perfect:  fresh seafood, iceberg letttuce, hard-boiled egg, grape tomatoes, and that rich Louie dressing that pulls it all together.  The Fries, though not as salty perfect as Slow Club fries (my personal standard of fry excellence) were a pretty delicious accompaniment and they stayed nice and crispy even as they cooled.    \n\nWe were in and out of there, had excellent service, and left fully satisfied.

When you walk-in, you feel a little bit like you walked into a nicer Long John's Silver. It has this harbor feel to the decorations (makes sense since it's a seafood joint lol). We came at 6pm on a Friday evening and wear seated promptly. I noticed on our way out though around 7:30pm that there was quite a wait so the timing of when you come by can be critical.  \n\nWe ordered the 3 oz. (or whatever the weight is of the smaller portion) split-top Maine lobster roll and the baja fish tacos.  The lobster roll tasted amazing. The lobster was chewy and flavorful. Combined with the buttery roll, it was a definite win on the palate. The lobster roll came with french fries and cole slaw.  The smaller portion was $18 (which is what we ordered) and the larger one was $23 or $25 (I don't quite recall). I felt it was a bit pricey for the sandwich, but I guess since it's lobster it does call for a higher price.  \n\nTHe baja fish tacos were delicious. The entree was served with three tacos and the tacos had avocado on them. They were perfectly crunchy and delicious. \n\nThe service was great as the food came out extremely quickly.  They did not appear to rush us either when we were done since my friend and I were catching up.  \n\nMy only gripe on this place is that I was not full when I was done. It could just be that I was extremely hungry but i definitely could have eaten more even though we split both of the entrees (that should equal to 1 entree each). Maybe next time I'll just have to order the larger lobster roll. :P", "author": "Sabrina C."}

The place as a casual feel to it, but the lighting is a little bit dim, so it seems \"warmer?\" or \"comfy-er?\"  \n\nAnyway, I was hungry and knew what I wanted pretty quickly, and I ordered the crab melt ($12).  The food came out pretty quickly and each half of the sandwich was about the size of my fist.  For a crab \"melt,\" I expected this to be a hot, or at least warm sandwich, but it was actually cool/room temperature, which was a surprise (and not a happy surprise).  Whatever, it still tasted decent.  The fries were pretty standard.  They are on the skinnier side, which I like.  It's also served with a small serving of coleslaw.  I usually don't really care for coleslaw, but I thought it was okay.\n\nThe service was pretty friendly and helpful.  Waters were refilled regularly and the whole experience was pleasant.  So while the crab melt was just so-so, I would consider trying out other dishes and  I can see why Woodhouse is well-liked.

Oh man, I have yet to try the lobster roll but what I've ordered so far has been excellent. The ambience is very relaxed, although the place is small you never feel crowded. And the service is excellent, a little slow at times but not unbearable.\n\nThe crispy calamari is so good, breading is nice and light and I prefer the cocktail sauce over the creamy sauce but both are still good. \n\nI've had both the New England and Hartford style clam chowder, both are excellent and although I like my chowders a little on the brothy side, I'll take it either way. Hartford style was a little on the salty side.\n\nAs for entrees I've had both the fish and chips, and the soft shell crab BLT. I love me some fish and chips but OH MAN, the soft shell crab with the heirloom tomato, bacon, and micro greens, I could keep ordering that! So when it's in season I suggest you do so. And this is just my own preference, Crispy ShoeString Fries. How great!!! \n\nI am looking forward to finally ordering a lobster roll, and maybe a whole fish.", "author": "Matt M."}

It was packed full of mussels, clams, shrimps, crab legs and bite after bite of baby scallops in a chunky and hearty tomato broth -- really tasty. We also ordered a Clam Chowder and Dungeness Crab Cocktail. Both were pretty good and nothing out of the ordinary compared to other seafood joints. If I were to complain, I would say the Clam Chowder was a tad too creamy for my taste, but at least they didn't skimp on the clams.

Called the original one on Market and found out the wait would be 45 minutes, so I called the one on Fillmore and they said it would be about the same, but they would take my name down. That worked out perfectly because by the time we got there, we only had about a 10 minute wait. Everyone was exceptionally nice and the place was bumpin'. A nice casual seafood place with a good vibe and great food. \n\nApparently I was in the mood for something fried. Got the calamari to start. Nice, lightly battered, delicate pieces of squid served with aioli and cocktail sauce with a wedge of lemon. A good start to the meal. And the trout slayer wheat beer. The can graphics looks like someone made it on their home computer circa 1990 with some clipart, but the beer was actually really good. For the entree, got the fish and chips. 3 tender pieces of Alaskan cod with shoestring fries. They weren't really shoestring fries, but everything was very good. Clam chowder was also pretty good. Creamy, but not too rich, chunky, good bits of clams. They offer Manhattan, New England and Hartford-style? Not sure what Hartford style is, may have to find out next time. \n\nEDIT: The power of Google tells me that Hartford style is a mix of New England and Manhattan: 3/4 New England with 1/4 of Manhattan spooned on top. Interesting. \n\nI liked this place, the server was awesome, and eating at the counter was a good experience.

The Split-top Maine Lobster Roll is the way to go with large and delicious pieces of lobster nestled between perfectly buttered bread.

The Steam Shellfish has a garlic-ky broth thats topped with parsley and goes great with the garlic bread. The half dozen oysters are worth it if you're more of a raw oyster kind of person. I tried the fresh Shigoku but to be honest, I can't taste the difference with any oysters. \n\nParking around the area could improve a bit but then again, this is San Francisco we're talking about.

Making the assumption that San Francisco has better seafood than Truckee and, therefore, better lobster rolls, I decided to go to Woodhouse to try out their version.\nMy friend and I got there starving and immediately smelled the unmistakable aroma of clam chowder. After a lot of walking up and down the hills in SF, my mouth started to water. We had a seat at the bar, were greeted quickly enough, and promptly ordered the 6oz version of the lobster roll.\nI also ordered the DIY Arnold palmer which comes with tea, a tart lemon mixture, and simple syrup. This was a cool and fun experiment. It took a while to get the combination I desired, but I felt pretty good about myself once I got it just right.\nMy first observation upon seeing our lobster roll was that the 6oz is obnoxious. The excess lobster easily falls off the side and I ended up taking some off the top. I don't have the biggest appetite, but would still recommend the 3oz variety for prospective customers. Anyway, there are two types of lobster on the 6oz roll. Chunky pieces of lobster and shredded lobster. I had never seen shredded lobster on a lobster roll until I came to Woodfish. My vision of a lobster roll based on what ive had in the past and pictures Ive seen have always been actual whole chunky pieces of lobster. Not little shredded pieces of lobster. And of course, therer was more of the shredded variety than there was the big pieces. Long story short, the shredded lobster, in my opinion, affected the taste of my lobster roll. I wonder if this only happens on the 6oz version as a way to get the roll to make weight. Either way, I was somewhat disappointed as the shredded variety lacked in taste.\nOverall, I thought my lobster roll was okay. I thought the roll I had at Morgans all the way in Truckee was hands down much better than the 6 oz version at Woodhouse. That being said, the clam chowder here smelled so good that I would still come back to try it out.", "author": "Reggie W."}

I asked for a side of sliced bread so i can dip it in the broth of my crab. OMG. this was was SO good. My crab legs had meat on them (you know some places don't) and that broth was heavenly. In reality a half only gets you about 3 oz of meat, i wish i ordered the whole. At least i know for next time.

It's really nice how you can have drinks while you wait. \n\nWe ordered the tuna tartare, lobster roll, cioppino, fried clams (highly recommend it!), and stuffed artichokes. Yes... we kinda over ordered for 3 girls.\n\nEverything was good but my favorite dishes were the tuna tartare (really fresh and delicious) and fried clams. I've had fried clams before and I never liked them. They were always small and basically all you taste is the fried batter. Woodhouse clams are different. They are whole clams deep fried. The are very tasty and juicy/meaty. I don't think anywhere else fries whole clams like them so I highly recommend giving them a try.", "author": "Karen L."}

And in honor of $1 oyster night, my co-diner and I went for the cheap and this is our review based on the few things you can get for the biggest bang possible.\n\nThe Food: We ordered about two dozen oysters ($24) and two chowders ($6 cup, $9 bowl). The oysters were pretty good, not amazing, but still taste pretty fresh and the accompanying sauce is really good -- it has just the right amount of spice in there. My New England clam chowder really made me sad. Yeah, I know, this place isn't exactly near Fisherman's Wharf, but every now and then, I like to be reminded that San Francisco is an awesome seafood hub, but this clam chowder just didn't do it for me. It wasn't creamy enough or savory enough, even though it had quite a bit of clams.\n\nThe Drink: We also ordered two glasses of house sauvignon blanc plus refills ($20). And now, maybe it's just because I came back from Napa a couple days before this visit, but this sauv blanc was just not good. It tasted like some $8 on-sale wine that you can get from Safeway. So if you're selling this to me at $5 per glass, I'm just going to say that my sophisticated palettes will be insulted. \n\nTip: The oyster dining experience requires delicate hands and focus, so make sure you don't down too much alcohol too quickly . . . you may just end up squirting lemon juice in your eye as you're aiming it atop the oyster.

With the prices here, this is not my normal idea of a snacking spot, unless you're there for just an oyster or two and a drink.  \n\nAnyway, brother bear has always wanted to try this and is super spontaneous with food, and never really eats at the same place twice.  So, since he never intends to come back to Woodhouse Fish Company, naturally he orders a lobster roll (A freakin' +), a fried clam roll with full, pop in your mouth clams (A freakin' +), one kumamoto oyster for me (A-, since I'm still easing into oysters and am learning how I can gauge them!), and a clam chowder (B).  \n\nBEST SNACK EVER!  Because I feel guilty if I eat a meal without any form of veggies or fruits, and enjoy the balance of some good things with fatty buttery, fried stuff, some arugula or thinly sliced tomatoes up in that shizz would have been nice.  Whateva, though!   Also, staff sat us right away at the bar and was super nice and fun with us.

I really wanted to try the lobster roll. But I'm mayo-phobic so I, unwilling to compromise the quality of their esteemed lobster roll, opted for the crab roll instead. My friend, however, is mayonnaise friendly and he ordered the lobster roll. Both sandwiches looked incredible. My friend's was piled high with fresh lobster, which was surprisingly not drenched in mayo. He said it was amazing and devoured it in under 10 minutes. My crab roll was delicious. Lots of fresh Dungeness crab in a perfectly soft and buttery roll which was seared to a crispy perfection. It was oozing with crab juice. The fries were also great--not too greasy and light and crispy. \n\nWe also had the sourdough bread pudding. It was ridiculously good. But it was also really heavy. We couldn't finish one between the two of us. \n\nMy only regret about our meal is that the table next to us seemed to order a meal that was significantly more extravagant than ours and I was constantly looking over in envy. It was a family of four (2 small children with their parents) and I have never wanted to steal a child's plate of food more. The chowder the kids had looked (and smelled--yes, we were that close) amazing. The parents ordered steamed mussels, steamed clams, and cioppino. I was having a mental dilemma deciding whether or not we should head into dinner #2 and just order more food. And I know yelp is about reviewing your own food, but man their food looked GOOD. Giant clams and juicy mussels and cioppino stuffed with yummy seafood goodness. I know what my next meal at Woodhouse is going to be. \n\nHigh marks for attentive service and beyond fresh, amazing seafood. I wish parking was easier, but that's a small price to pay for the awesome food we got.

It was crowded around 3 PM and my uncle, who was from another country, was first put off by the plain appearance of the place, but finally realized why this place was so popular. He especially loved the calamari, and this was the first time I tried the lobster roll. It starts at $18 ($26 for more of that lobstery goodness), but it was definitely worth every bite: the bread was perfectly toasted and buttered, and the lobster was warm and had a creamy taste to it. A bit pricier than what I'm used to, but you get what you pay for. A great representation of the seafood here in SF rather than those tourist traps that sell clam chowder for $10. 5/5\n\nMy second visit was on 6/22/13 around 4 PM. We had just arrived before the dinner rush so we assumed we would be able to get in and out of there in 30-45 minutes. Welllll I was wrong. We ordered as soon as we were seated and 20 minutes passed by. Ok, I thought, that was bearable. Then passed another 30 minutes, and we saw the party of 5 next to us, which came in much later than us, receive all their food. When my lobster roll and my bf's crab cakes came out shortly after, it was barely even warm. I had already drank so much water in the waiting process that I was unable to really to enjoy my meal. It just really dampened my dining experience when I was served cold food. 3/5 \n\nI will still come back to this place because their seafood is still delicious and fresh, but I really hope they step up their service and bring out dishes when they're done.

My family and I finally had a chance to try it today for lunch.\n\nWith Labor Day holiday, I was expecting the place to already be crowded but I guess folks were having a late morning. My party of 4 was the 3rd to arrive (only two couples before us).\n\nThe waiter was flinting around the restaurant and as we entered, he went to fetch someone's take out order. Upon his return, he said we could take any table so we seated ourselves. The guy continued to flint around ignoring us so my sister got up to get the menus for us (strike 1).  We decided what we wanted and put in our order, most regular items from the menu like simple sandwiches, soup, plate of crab cakes.\n\nNow, I'm the type of person who takes in the entire dining experience (ambience, service and food). I noticed that the waiter told an Asian couple that came in after us that they couldn't sit in the curved section of the banquette because it was set for 3 people. Later a single middle-aged Caucasian man strolled in and sat in that same table for lunch. The server never said a word denying him that seat even when there were plenty of tables for 2 open. (strike 2)\n\nTwo in my party had chowder to start and two of us waited for our main dishes. And we waited and we waited. Other couples came in and sat down, ordered, and got their fried clams and chowders before we got our main dishes. In fact everyone, who came in and ordered after us, got their food before we did. What's the problem with that? Is this server clueless? How much complexity is it to serve up a crab melt, a clam sandwich and a plate with 2 crab cakes??? I put the blame on the server for bad timing. He didn't even say he was sorry for the delay (unlike most other decent establishments). In fact, I had to ASK \"Where is our food???\" The waiter than said, \"Oh, I see it in the pick up area now.\" Like how long was it sitting there, huh??\n\nAbout the food:\ncrab melt sandwich - at a little bigger than my fist, the crab sandwich was soft and tender in a lobster-type bread roll. This dish though is full of butter and I could feel it hardening my arteries so could only eat half of it.\n\ncrabcakes - my companion thought they were salty and asked for bread to eat to absorb some of the salt (salt intolerant beware!)\n\nclam chowder - very rich and had flavor. Is this thickened with potatoes or starch? After having Sam's Chowder House's version last weekend, WFC's was somewhat disappointing.\n\nfries - skinny fries that remind one of French pomme frites; good flavor and texture.\n\nOverall, I would not come back to Woodhouse Fish Company in Pac Heights.

I got the two piece fish and chips and she got the lobster roll. We shared the calamari appetizer and she also got a cup of clam chowder.\n\nThe calamari was light and chewy, just how I like it. I hate tough and extremely hard/crispy calamari. Theirs was perfect. I haven't had too many fish and chips in my life, but this has to be my favorite one so far. Batter is super light and crispy and the cod was flaky and buttery. It was cooked perfectly. I only tried a bite of their lobster roll, and I couldnt really tell if I liked it from that one bite, but my friend seemed to enjoy it. \n\nThe only reason I docked off one star was because their service was kind of lacking. My BFF and I came on a Friday for lunch and there were literally 2 parties there and one solo customer, so 3 parties total including us. The service was really slow. We had to ask for refills and flag them down for to go boxes and our bill. Oh, and there were 2 waiters there, so that couldve already been a one waiter to one table kind of thing, but it still sucked. The waitress also forgot to put in the order for my friend's clam chowder, so we had to remind her when we were more than halfway done with our food and after that, I saw her put it in the system, meaning she didn't put it in at all. Other than that, I would go back.", "author": "Faye M."}

The waiter stated the soft shell crab was in season and it would be the best time to order it.  It was on the special black board menu and I had to have it.

It's a must try, but I will not be ordering it the next time I come back.  \n\nThe crab cakes came with 3 patties and it was yummm,. especially with the side of salad it came with.

The pesto pasta was topped with pine nuts, YUM!   \n\nThe mussels were EH,. very original,. will not be ordering that next time.     \n\nThe WHOLE crab,. everyone was fighting over it.  I don't usually like crab since it takes to much work to eat.  One complaint was my friends stated it was missing the joints?! where was the meat?! I am assuming they take the joint piece off the crab and use it for the crab cakes!? Good, but overprices $24 for a whole crab!\n\nFISH/CHIPS = a plate you can get anywhere. DON'T ORDER IT\n\nRaw oysters,. they were good, did not have the fishy smell to it and went down smooth.  Even none oyster eaters loved it! \n\nThe bill came out to be $44 a person including tip.

The breading- the lightest and most savory breading I have ever eaten (ever.)\n2.  The fish- was in big hunks, very juicy on the inside, and was available in two portion sizes\n3.  The tarter sauce- was the best I have ever had, it was clearly made in house, with chunks of pickles\n\nThe fries were standard, nothing to rave about, but the house salad was impressive in freshness and flavor.  Just another reason why I deemed this experience a 5 star winner.  I ordered the house salad mostly to feel better about the fried food, so I was not expecting it to be anything special.  I was shocked and my husband was too as we fought over the last bites.  It was so fresh with the right amount of tangy dressing, garnished with very flavorful heirloom pear tomatoes.

Ran across this lovely place on Yelp!\n\nFirst let me say I'm not a huge Lobster fan just because I find it's not as flavorful as crabs and shrimps, and a bit $$$$ \n\nAfter reading a few reviews I had to try to Lobster Roll, and let me tell you... IT was SCRUMPTIOUS. They do NOT skimp on the Lobster. I got the 3oz (smaller portion), was debating on the 6oz because I was HANGRY. Surprisingly the 3oz portion was very fulfilling. Even though it was served as a roll, you absolutely get the full flavor and lobster chunks in each and every bite. I also found the price for the meal very reasonable for what you get. \n\nThe service was great and on point. Very friendly atmosphere, I would say we were in/out within the hour.

I truly appreciate his concern and the fact that he would reach out to me. \nI know how tough it can be running a small business these days. I also understand how much tougher it is now that every Tom, Dick, and Harry has the power to write an unsubstantiated one star review on Yelp. So when a business owner contacts me after I have written a negative review (which I really don't relish doing in the first place), I know that he/she takes customer service seriously. I am looking forward to giving this business another try, especially given all the previous great reviews that led me here in the first place. Thanks.", "author": "Delilah P."}

I've had fresher lobster, and this tiny portion was under-seasoned.

Its not melted by any means but I really enjoyed it that way.

I only live a few blocks away, and I'm surprised it took me this long to try the place out!\n\nWe had a craving for seafood so we started off with a dozen oysters. We got the Miyagi oysters, which are smaller than the East Coast oysters they sold, but I think they're way tastier. They came served on a small cookie sheet of ice. Perfectly chilled. Awesome oysters.\n\nMy girlfriend got the full crab. You can get it chilled, steamed, and another preparation which I don't recall. She went for steamed. While steamed crab is always a messy affair, it was really awesome. LOTS of good meat in there. As a crab lover, I definitely approve.\n\nOn the waiter's recommendation, I got the cioppino. It was delicous. While many cioppinos are very soupy, this one was more of a pile of varoius shellfish with a broth on the bottom. So it's really just a great bunch of seafood with a marinara-style broth in the bottom.\n\nWhile we were stuffed, we decided to get some desert, and we split the bread budding. Also. awesome. Everything we ate that nice was delicious.\n\nThe decor of the place is really cool. Lots of old maps framed on the wall. They actually have a relatively large HDTV in a picture frame that just shows old boats and seascapes and such. It's one of those casual, but classy, places. The menu is pricey, but it's not a ripoff. The \"whole crab\" was $27, and I believe that was the most expensive item on there. All in all, I loved Woodhouse Fish Company.

Haha must I say, we were definitely craving some Pho, but since it was just a walk from her apartment at the Fillmore, we figured why not.  Plus, I've been telling her how I wanted to try the good stuff in San Francisco, and so here we were.\n\nWe started off with the chowder (mixed red and white), which I had no idea existed.  Yes, you can call me sheltered... Anyways, the chowder was good.  It wasn't out of this world, but it satisfied.  I've also been craving oysters for the longest time, so we ordered one of each.  Our waitress was great to provide detail about each, giving us a lesson of each type of oyster, which of course I would forget.  But I loved all the oysters that we tried.  If it was $1 each, I probably would've ordered more, but given that it was $2-$3 per oyster, I think we were pretty adventurous on our wallets with what we ordered.  Next, came our main dishes. My friend ordered the sea bass and I ordered the chappino.  Her sea bass was alright... in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong, my friend loved it, but I am not a fan of a fish on a bone.  I hate picking out the bones and on top of that, it still had that \"fishy\" taste to it so I was just glad I didn't order it myself.  So, I think that is just a personal preference.  As far as my dish, OMG.  YUMSKIS.  So my chappino consisted of fish, scallops, clams, mussels, crab meat, shrimp in a tomato based sauce with garlic bread on the side.  The crab meat was the best part of it as it seemed the most fresh and I was glad I didn't have to do any work as far as getting it out of its shell.  There was a good amount of meat to the crab and it was fresh.  The chappino was so good, I finished it all.  The rest of the seafood itself was fresh as well and the sauce did a great job complementing it.  \n\nOverall, the food matched its price and definitely worth coming back again.", "author": "Wendy Y."}

Luckily he got 3 pieces of fish as he gave me one - YUM (and I kept reaching over for more fries)!  The fish batter was crispy and fried just right, and we loved their tartar sauce (I still finished all of my meal too, plus had a taste of clam chowder, full full, yum).  Our friend got the \"fribs\" (fish that's cut to look like ribs), and that looked pretty good too!  \n\nAnd the topper was the strawberry shortcake w/ fresh whipped cream!!  Mmm!

It was a last minute decision, sparked by a conveinent parking lot on California and Fillmore and a very long wait at Delfinas.  It was a Sunday night that followed the most beautiful Sunday day which is what I will attribute to the wait at almost every good restuarant on Fillmore.  People did not want to go home!\n\nWe split half of the king crab, the plain with melted butter on the side.  It was amazing.  I should have gotten the full and ate it for an entree.  The cioppino was amazing.  The red broth so delish, it didn't even matter that it ended up all over our shirts.  The broth even made their amazing near perfect bread taste better.  I'll never understand though having to grab king crab out of a red soup and crack it with our hands.  This soup should have been eaten on the side of a beach, over sand, with a bathing suit on...rather than a nice restaurant;)  But if I go back I will order the soup.  Food envy was kicking in...\n\nBut I'll be honest, the baked stuffed artichoke sounded amazing, but didn't quite deliver.  The salad underneath with the beets was a pleasant surprise.  The crab on the one artichoke super yummy.  But the baby shrimp were tasteless as were the artichoke leaves.  I left most of it on my plate.  \n\nLuckily the menu had at least four more things I'd like to try.  Next time I will also order from the wine list.", "author": "Kierstan G."}

Then we ordered a monterey squid appetizer, clam chowder cup, fish and chips and a Louis salad (with crab instead of shrimp). 15 minutes later we got our salad and cup of soup. Then we waited and waited and waited for the entrees. We finally asked about them 25 min after getting our apps. They said they had \"staggered\" the food for us on purpose, which made no sense because other parties had been getting multiple dishes together. What obviously happened is that they forgot to place our entree orders. It took another 20 minutes to get our entrees--and the Louis salad had shrimp, not crab. And by that time we were very hungry and annoyed. Instead of owning up to their mistake, they said they were \"busy.\" But every single party that was seated after us--sometimes a half-hour after us--got their entrees before us. It's the disingenuousness of the staff's response to our complaints that pissed us off the most.\n\nWe also got to know the couple eating at a table next to ours. Get this: one of them had a rubber band in their fish and chips, and the other found a hair in her salad! (They were too kind and didn't even complain to the staff.)\n\nFor what it's worth, the fish in the fish and chips was great. And the staff comped us an entree. But given the terrible experience, they should have comped us the whole meal. As you can see, I almost never leave reviews so the fact that I'm doing so now means that I was pretty rattled by the experience.

I've been a fan since they first opened the Market joint, and the 2nd is equally good.  We both love the garlic bread and fried calamari as appetizers and both were tasty tonight, but they must have a shortage of lemons because the wedges were too skinny to squeeze.  The other shortcoming tonight was our entree's being delivered moments after we started the appetizers, as in \"we're too busy for you to really enjoy your dinner with us\", but aside from those two mishaps, the food was delicious.  I had their fish and chips with a from, fresh cod like fish with a great tempura style coating, perfect shoestring fries, a good tartar sauce and the poor aforementioned anorexic lemons.  Dave ordered his favorite, the lobster roll and he was in bliss with that, the salad and slaw served with it.

As we were waiting we decided to see if we could order a glass a wine/beer from the bar. The bar seating was packed and since they don't have a bar tender, the host went over as grabbed us a drink(glass of champange for me and beer on tap for the hubby). The host was very attentive and kept giving us an ETA for when we would be seated. \n\nWe sat down about 20 minutes later and our server came right over. She informed us that they were out of their whole crab-which was a total bummer because that is what we wanted but there were several other things on teh menu I wanted to try so we just now need to go back soon and get the crab!. \n\nWe started off with 12 oysters(they have about 4 different varieties). They were $2 each but on Tuesday they are $1 each.\n\nMy husband and I shared the Artichoke Entree(it is a very LARGE artichoike that is steamed and seasoned and then on one half there is crab and on teh other half there is bay shrimp. It is HUGE and comes with a big salad. very yummy!\n\nWe also shared the large order of teh lobster roll which is big chunks of lobster is a toasted buttered roll and comes with teh best fries! They are so yummy! I ate all of mine and then some of my friends! They are so cripsy and simple; i couldn't stop eating them. I actually had to ask the server to have her take it away\n\nWe ended the night with the chocolate pudding cake with habenero and whip cream with cayenne. So good. I didn't think it was very spicy but still delicious! \n\nMeal was on the expensive side(4 people, 2 drinks each, 3 entrees=$200) but it was worth it. so good!

Sorry I can't remember the name of the particular tuna. It was very tasty though.\n\nCalamari appetizer was very good. Nice tender calamari, not to much breading and not dried out nor overly chewy. The sauces were pretty good- one tasted like Thou Island which I normally hate but it had a smokey, bacon flavor that was quite good.\n\nLobster roll was delicious.  A little pricey but I was glad I ordered it. It was huge with lots of nice, fresh lobster in it. Not 'lobster-esque molded white fish substance'. Large, juicy fresh chunks of lobster in a surprising light mayo-y sauce. It was white like mayo but not heavy and cloying. You could still taste the lobster even with the sauce. So glad the husband doesn't like shellfish so I could have this all by myself.\n\nTuna Cheeseburger was tasty. Husband wished there was just a hair less cheese on it though.  Fish just seems like it shouldn't/wouldn't go well with cheese but this worked.\n\nThis is a nice friendly restaurant.

Lightly battered and extremely crunchy Cod with a bit of cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and chipotle aioli (fantastic, even though I hate mayo)!  They give you 3 generous tacos, the fish is moist with a light crispy batter and the flavor is FANtastic. The CRISPY CALAMARI is also fried in a light crispy batter, so one can actually taste the fish, served again with the spicy chipotle aioli; fabulous.  THE MANHATTAN CLAM CHOWDER was also done just right and the CHOCOLATE MOUSSE W/PEACHES (special of the day) was rich and just as delicious as it was unique.

After reading reviews for this place, we decided to give this place a try.\n\nConsidering how many people raved about the Lobster Roll, several of us ordered them with the intent of sharing.  $26 for a 6 ounce sandwich isn't cheap, but we all desperately wanted to try it and decided to supplement our meals with various appetizers.  \n\nFor starters, we had calamari and clam chowder with Sourdough bread.  I can honestly say, we started the meal off wrong.  The calamari, which I would consider a staple dish when it comes to seafood, was absolutely disgusting.  It was undercooked, soggy, bland, and heavy on the batter.  Considering this place is called the FISH COMPANY, you think they would be able to do seafood justice, but NO, they couldn't get calamari right.  Seriously, I've had better calamari at boba cafes all over town than I had here at this place.  \n\nAs for the clam chowder, it was decent.  Flavorful? Yes, for the most part, but really heavy on the potatoes.  Don't get me wrong, I love potatoes, but this isn't called potato chowder, its called CLAM chowder.  Thus, I was unimpressed by their soup. \n\nMoving on to the main dish, we all had split Lobster Rolls.  Well, you can probably assume by my one star rating, this meal definitely wasn't up to par.  The Lobster roll sounded appealing when the waitress described it, 6 ounces of claw and tail meat tossed in an aioli sauce then placed into a Sourdough roll that is buttered and toasted.  Boy, was I wrong.  First, I was caught off guard by the fact that the sandwich was cold.  To make things worse, the roll was more like a thick slice of sourdough bread that must have been toasted at 6 AM in the morning.  The bread was soggy and just as cold as the lobster meat.  Then, to make matters worse, I found three pieces of shells in my sandwich.  Definitely a turn off to this restaurant.  \n\nMy recommendations: GO SOMEPLACE ELSE!!! The food is disgusting, the service is nothing to be desired, and the prices are definitely not worth it.  If you want better seafood than this place, go to Long John Silvers.  But, if you don't mind not having seafood, you're in Japan Town, so stop by some other local eateries, otherwise you'll leave this restaurant with an empty wallet and a dissatisfied stomach.  The only thing that helped saved my appetite was the short walk to The Fillmore Bakeshop half a block away.", "author": "Merisa M."}

I thought it was good, but the cake wasn't cake like.  It tasted more like a biscuit with a consistency of a scone.  I'm used to having fluffy shortcakes that are easy to fork out, unlike this one where it was hard like a cookie. It was filled with fresh whipped cream and strawberries.  It was still very very delicious, just not what I was expecting when we ordered it.\n\nBREAD PUDDING: SOOOOOO goood. This was the better of the two desserts.  It came in stick form and each stick of bread had a somewhat crispy out side but when you bite into it, it's soft and doughy. Went very well with the whipped cream and caramel.  This won our hearts over the strawberry shortcake. YUMMY!\n\nOur party was trying to chat it up and enjoy our food, but we felt really rushed.

Finally before watching Avengers we got a table and had dinner here.  Three lobster rolls, one soft shell crab blt (I learned through GQ that soft shell crab is actually known as soft crab), fried calamari and oysters.  \n\nThe lobster roll at $26 is a bit pricey but it's lobster so what do you expect?  There are a ton of lobster meat that is for sure.  The hoagie bun was perfectly grilled.  There was so much lobster meat that it falls out when you eat it.  I'm a huge fan of soft shell crab and the blt is a great way to put the crab to use.  Big enough and lots of flavor, it is definitely a better deal than the lobster roll at $16.  It was a special so it may not be there the next time.  The bun again was perfectly cooked just like the bun on the lobster roll.\n\nI'm not a huge oyster fan but the gf and her brother said it was good.

We ordered 38 oysters, and they were a great deal--if you're okay with having x-small oysters. In my opinion, for raw oysters, eating x-small ones are the best, because the taste isn't too overwhelming. But not filling at all because they were way too small. Some oyster barely had a half inch of meat on them. \n\nThe oysters were tender and fresh, and the service was fast. \nWe also ordered The Clam Chowder and Fried Calamari dishes. The Clam Chowder was kind of watery instead of the expected chunky and thick, but it was still good chowder. The seasoning wasn't too salty, and it was very subtle. The fried calamari was probably my SO and my favorite dish out of the three things we ordered. The batter they were fried it was just the right amount, and it stayed crispy around the calamari. The batter stayed on the calamari as you bite into it instead of falling off, so that was pleasant.\n\nFor the size of the restaurant, they do a good job of making sure their customers are comfortable and well-served.\n\nI've been hearing and reading much about their lobster roll, so that's something I think I'll have to go back and try next!

Well finally found a seafood type place close to CPMC Pacific campus. YAY. First off 2 time eating there; first exceptional, second mediocre... but due to location and price of cioppinno will need more experiences to get a better understanding if the second time was a fluke?! Hoping they go 2/3! \n\nLooked at reviews said good fish and chips and good ciopinno (my favorite) so since im stuck in the hospital my mom (allergic to seafood except fried stuff) went and picked it up since they dont do delivery (boo! should delivery especially to sick patients in need of good food in hospital! haha). Mom was pleased with the fish and chips ($12.50 or so for 3 pieces), though only 2 bites of coleslaw. Both loved the cioppinno ($19)- spicy, full of mussels and clams and crab (though scallops little overdone) and huge prawns deeelish, hit the spot (Mom just sipped the broth). Got combination cocktail though for $15 was VERY disappointed 2 prawns and 2 bites of crab and a box full of lettuce... pussnuggets! \n Next day mom and aunt went in for lunch and got clam chowder, heresay is good and a crab melt heresay is good that full of crab! \nNow to my second experience. Cioppinno again and tried just the plain prawn cocktail, asked said 5 were in it for $10 ( really wanted prawns mmmk) but when I got it there was 4. then I got half a crab for $12 I think. I \"snuck\" outta the hospital myself cause mom was gone and picked up my food... maybe cause I wasted about 20-30 minutes site seeing around fillmore street it affected the taste. Cioppinno had NO spice :( but still ate it and was still good relatively just loved that kick. The crab was steamed with white wine, didnt really hit the spot for me unfortunately... \nI ate it all that night though, no leftovers and even though slightly disappointed will be back to try clam chowder myself, cioppinno again, steamed mussels and/or clams, and artichokes and crab entree... will steer clear of overpriced cocktails though. \n\nJust so glad it opened and is so close to CPMC! I know their menu is online but still added prices so people dont have to click a million links to get an idea of costs. Also uploaded pictures of take out boxes. Also noticed that Market Street location is slightly cheaper and has couple more options on menu.", "author": "Tabitha E."}

We stumbled in (literally because we were dying from hunger by then) around 7 and were seated at the bar after a 30 minute wait. We decided to split the lobster roll and two crab cakes and it ended up being the perfect amount of food for us. The lobster roll comes in two sizes, a smaller one with 3 oz. of lobster meat (for $18) and a larger one with 6 oz. of lobster meat (for $26). We chose the latter since we were splitting and I was pleasantly surprised at how much lobster was piled on top of that sandwich. Lobster was literally spilling out of the sandwich. It's definitely one of those things that you can't be all neat and proper about so don't try to. The crab cakes were fantastic as well. Great texture and flavor, and they were somehow both light tasting and filling at the same time.\n\nThe service was great too.

Had the three piece fish and chips ($14) and a glass of Frog's Leap sauvignon blanc.  Everyone was really nice and professional.  The staff worked together as a team and it seemed like my water was constantly being refilled for me...nice!    As I started on my wine, I discovered that my wine glass had something stuck on the inside and the waitperson took care of it immediately for me.  Not only that, but I noticed that when it came back, the level of the wine was actually slightly higher, not lower, so guessing she might have actually replaced it rather than just pouring it into a new glass.  During my lunch, my wine was served cafe-style in a regular glass which was fine, although the romantic in me longed for traditional stemware.\n\n$14 for a three piece fish and chips sounded like a veritable bargain after the $23.99 at Fish (restaurant) in Sausalito recently.  There was even a two piece option at $12 for lighter appetites although I certainly would not fall under that category.  The special of the day was a whole bronzino for $25.  That sounded so appealing that I came so close to ordering it, but stuck to my guns and ordered what I originally came for.  I'm a sucker for whole fish, done right.   I still remember a most memorable whole striped bass with a bottle of Greco di Tufo I once had at Poggio in Sausalito.\n\nAnyway, back to the fish and chips...the batter was light and crispy, the fish perfectly cooked.  Fries were good although there were a lot of little pieces towards the end.

The server was knowledgeable, and definitely took his time describing the specials, but I -- in my never ending quest to find the most delicious fried fish -- ordered the fish and chips.  Not being a fry fan, I substituted my fries for onion rings.  He told me that it would be an extra $1 to sub; I told him that was fine.  When our food arrived by a different server, I pleasantly told the guy that I had ordered onion rings, not fries.  He told our server, and our server came by and said that it was \"[his] fault, [I] didn't put in the order.\"  I swear, I didn't b*tch him out.  I just don't eat fries.  It's a waste to give them to me.  So I tried to give it back, but he just had a side order of onion rings come by.\n\nHe spent the rest of our time there avoiding me and only talking directly to my friend.  When our bill came, to my surprise, he had charged the full amount for a side of onion rings.  What?  Wait, he freely admitted that the mistake was his, and he still charged me the full amount?  I thought he'd just charge me the $1 that he told me he was going to charge me.  And, FYI, if that had happened, I'm a much more generous tipper.\n\nIf I was eating at a hole-in-the-wall, I wouldn't expect good service.  I don't expect bad service from nice restaurants.  There are places where the food is average, but the service makes it a staple in my regular restaurant rotation.  This would not be it.

Once our waiter gave us the menu and water, he didn't come back for awhile but everything went fine once he came back to take our order.  \n\nGot the cioppino, soft shell crab sandwich (special on the board), 2 pieces fish and chips, and a bowl of clam chowder.  The chowder was pretty good, had more clam pieces than I remember getting from Boudin's on the pier.  Not watery and just the right thickness.  Still can't say it's the best I've ever had, but pretty good.  The fish was hot and crispy and didn't taste overly greasy.  Loved the coleslaw and fries that came with it.  Wish they gave a bit more coleslaw though cuz it came in a teeny tiny cup.  The fries were crispy the whole time.  Tartar sauce was great too.  I also loved the soft shell crab sandwich.  Who wouldn't love a deep fried crab sandwiched between two pieces of butter toasted bread?  Yum!  \n\nThe cioppino was huge.  Enough to feed two people.  It was good too, lots of fish, small scallops, giant crab claw and a smaller one, clams, and two kinds of mussels.  One of the mussels tasted yucky but the other seafoods were quite good.  The garlic sourdough dipped in the seafood-tomato sauce was fantastic.  I thought the prices were reasonable given that it's seafood and besides that one bad mussel, everything else tasted very fresh.  \n\nEnded the dinner with the bread pudding.

The place is a little loud, and my dining companion is a little hard of hearing, so he was having a little difficulty with the noise level (there's nothing to dampen it). Speed of service was average, server has helpful but with a somewhat bland personality. \n\nFood: pleasantly surprised, the food itself would be 4 stars. Start was shrimp louie salad, which was OK, if a bit overdressed. Crab roll was tasty, buttery, really nice, although more slaw would be appreciated (as well as perhaps a lighter, more tangy, less mayo-based version). Fellow diner had halibut special with risotto, nettle pesto, sprouts, and toasted walnuts. THAT dish was outstanding. Dessert was bread pudding with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Very good on that. \n\nOne minus: drafty. The windows were open, and chilling breezes swept through regularly. Not conducive to enjoying my dinner. \n\nAnother minus: price. I feel it's a little overpriced for what it is. Especially for someone who visits relatives back east, and is familiar with the ol' crab shack offerings, these are on the high end.", "author": "C N."}

Service was great, friendly, and attentive. They have specials listed on the board and simple menu but everything sounded and looked amazing. We decided that we would just order a little of everything and share. We started of with tostadas, classic clam chowder, fish and chips, stuffed artichokes, and a lobster roll. As much food as that sounds for a party of 3, we demolished EVERYTHING. The tostada was light crisp and fresh, chowder was perfectly creamy with chunks of tender clams, fish and chips crispy light and flakey, stuffed artichokes were UHMAZING flavorful and huge portions of crab and shrimp stuffed in it, and the lobster roll was meaty, light, and fresh. Definitely a place to come back to when in the area. Prices are reasonable for seafood, quality and portion sizes.", "author": "Arlene C."}

At least one that won't serve you mediocre quality fish at inflated prices.\n Woodhouse to the rescue!  and in a bustling neighborhood to boot.  Woodhouse does a great job with all their dishes. We five dined on a weekend night,  ordered everything from simple (mouthwatering)  fish and chips to whole cooked fish of the day and it was all perfectly cooked ( Suggestion: they could and should have deboned the whole fish).\nStarted with clam chowder, with a  real clam taste and smooth and creamy and not too salty or floury. Had a few oysters  from WA, just to check them out also fresh and nicely served with a choice of horseradish and chili sauce or just lemon.\nMains were crab cakes,&  lobster roll ( small order)  the roll was like back east with a soft buttered white Acme bread with crispy crust and a good amount of meat in a tasty but not overpowering salad sauce. Most plates had fries or roasted root vegetables on the side, which were kind of a nice surprise. Beer ( Steam) and wines were well suited, they have a house Chardonnay which went perfect with the fish.\nService was prompt and pleasant. Prices are fair for the quality of the grub.\nThe place is small, and  ( No Reservations) the wait in the evening for larger parties is often long on weekends.Put your name in at 6- 6:30  and go have a drink at Harrys, you'll be ready to sit by 7:30. I'd go back anytime. Nice thing is you can take the out of towners to a place for fish that is not on the Wharf.", "author": "Aaron Z."}

The clam chowder was delicious. They were generous with their seafood portions in the chowder & the creamy texture gave them an upper edge to some of the chowder I've had at other eateries. The Calamari was ok. Breaded nicely & a great sharing dish. The Stuffed Artichoke was also another winner. It was grilled, sliced in half and stuffed with one side crab and the other shrimp. The dipping sauce was also a plus - homemade mayo? and some other side that I can't remember because i was intently focused on stuffing my face with the mayo. \n\nI ordered the Top Maine Lobster Roll - $18 for 3 oz. and $26 for 6 oz., i opted for the big boys club and ordered the 6 oz. It was also delicious. The butter bread and the texture of the lobster was rich & well seasoned. The Fish & Chips and that was pretty good. The batter was a bit much at times but it held a nice texture. I also noticed that their fish was proportionately generous. \n\nThe place itself is a little small but its worth the wait.

This would be the second time I've tried any seafood roll. The ambiance is nice. It seems loud but its not bar loud where you have to scream across the table to be heard but just loud enough to create an enjoyable lively environment. I ordered the small dungeness crab sandwich and he had the large lobster sandwich. We also shared a bowl of clam chowder. The chowder was alright. You can definitely taste the difference in clams than when you compare it to Boudins. But I've definitely had better clam chowder.  Onto the sammies. My roll was SUPER filling for a small and I am no small eater. The bread was filled with crab meat. I was defintely surprised because the other placee where i had first tried the lobster roll i was like \"wow this is it?\" So after seeing my small, i wondered what a large would look like - and bam there it was.  the same size bread as the small BUT it was LOADED, and i mean PACKED JAM worst than LA traffic jam packed with nothing but LOBSTER. he was so happy. If only i could show you the face he made when he saw what his dinner was about to be. Service was also great. I always had water - never once had to ask! Expect to wait long at places like this.

We lucked out and got a table right away as other larger parties were waiting. Our server was fantastic (and friendly and funny)! He first helped this red wine drinker select a nice white (damn those migraines!) and even brought me a sample to taste to see if I liked it. My partner ordered his usual Arnold Palmer, which came with a glass half full of lemonade, a separate carafe of tea, and another carafe of simple syrup to sweeten it to your own taste. Sweet. \n\nThe server also was very thorough in describing the menu and the differences in the oysters. We ended up trying two different kinds of oysters (the Humboldt Co. ones were the best, IMO). They were served with lemon and a cocktail sauce with horseradish. The horseradish was a bit spicy for my taste, but the oysters were were really tasty. \n\nWe also had a crab louie salad, which was very good and perfectly dressed. By that time I was already nearly full, but that feeling subsided when our entrees came out. I ordered the fresh Alaskan wild salmon with chevril sour cream and cherry butter. Coupled with mustard greens and a potato thingie (yes, that's the culinary technical term), it was absolutely incredible. Everything balanced really well and I tried eating very, very slowly to savor it.. My partner ordered the whole dorade, which was also delish (especially the skin!). The best part, though, was the rum-soaked sweet potato patties that came with the whole fish. I really think it was one of the best things I have ever tasted. \n\nAlthough stuffed and happy, I can never resist a bread pudding when I see one, so I ordered the sourdough bread pudding with a huge scoop of fresh whipped cream and caramel sauce. It was HUGE and I could only eat about half.\n\nIn addition to the great service and amazing food, the atmosphere is neat, too.

The Crab Cakes were cooked to perfection, the exterior was a nice thin crisp with a moist interior.\n\nIt was a bit pricier for lunch, but great food quality so I was extremely satisfied with the price.", "author": "Steph L."}

Crispy and tender with a wonderfully spicy sauce. It really doesn't get much better. \n\nI ordered the crab cakes which come with a small salad. They were a light tasty lunch- I would certainly eat them again. \n\nThe crab roll was tasty with toasted bread and melted cheese. The fish and chips were great. The fish was so tender it would fall apart if you tried to dip it into the tartar sauce. \n\nThe only thing I didn't really care for was the shrimp roll. Cold tiny cocktail shrimp in a sandwich just didn't do it for me (although others may like it).\n\nThe disappointment for me was the pricing. Lunch for the wife, me, and two youngsters ended up being right at $100 with tip. Dropping $100 for a lunch just isn't something I can do with any kind or regularity. Maybe my problem is that I moved out of San Francisco a few years ago so I'm no longer used to the SF pricing. I'm guessing I could find a similar meal in my area for about $50.", "author": "Bill C."}

Their meals are consistently delicious- they feature a number of nice seafood dishes on the regular menu, and my favorites are usually their specials.  I have enjoyed most consistently the crab & lobster sandwiches, as well as the tuna burger- which are always on the menu, and served with tasty, crispy fries.  They feature a very nice fish & chips- which I believe is usually cod.  Most recently, I had an excellent special- a poached halibut dish served with a couscous-like pasta with an herby pesto garnish, cherry tomatoes and walnuts. So good I went back and had it again a week later :-) My most recent lunch for two with my wife, which included a sauteed corn appetizer, two entrees, a beer and a soda was about $50 w/tip out the door- so not cheap as far as lunch goes- but we were well fed and it really was excellent.  In the seafood category, it is probably a tad different and less formal than down-town classics Sam's and Tadich Grill, maybe similar to Yabbies on Polk Street to some degree.  Anyways, I have had consistently great meals there and would recommend this ALWAYS to anyone looking for a superb lobster or crab sandwich, and a stellar fish and chips.", "author": "Andy S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-16", "description": "While a few of my favorite places to eat on Fillmore have unfortunately closed over the last several months, I am so happy that this place opened and have been striving.\n\nI actually have been eyeing on this place for a while now every time I walk past it.  But given that they are serving casual-yet-high-quality seafood, the price was kind of discouraging to just casually stop by alone on a random weekday. \n\nBut just the other day, after I got off my ballet class at 8pm, my husband picked me up in the city and we thought we should break our terrible routine of resorting to Subway sandwiches every week after my dance classes and try something new.  It was a chillier evening compared to the last few nights and the timing and the temperature seemed to be right for some good, cozy seafood.  \n\nSo I mentioned this place to my husband and we decided to check it out.  We sat at the bar... and because we are addicted to Dungeness crab roll at Fish in Sausalito, we just had to try it here too to compare.  So we got a large (meaning sandwich stuffed with more crab) crab roll to share, plus a mixed green salad and a cup of chowder plus drinks.  \n\nWe saw white chowder, red chowder, and Hartford.  \"Hartford\"??? We were not familiar with it so we asked our waiter and learned that it's white and red, half & half.  Because white is thicker than the red, they stay somewhat separated until you mix them up to your liking.  We thought that was interested so we gave that a shot.  And lemme tell you... I am HOOKED.  It kind of tastes like... lasagna. LOL.  I know it sounds wierd, but to have that rich creaminess of white clam chowder with a bit of tomato based chowder mixed in?  You catch my drift.  This chowder if definitely something I'll have cravings for.\n\nThe crab roll was great too.  I may prefer the one at Fish in Sausalito slightly better in terms of the buns (they use Acme torpedo roll there, Woodhouse uses an oldschool hotdog bun type bread.  Very yummy nonetheless but it's really personal preference) and also the fact that you get to choose fries, slaw or salad at Fish but at Woodhouse the sandwiches come with fries by default, and overall portion is slightly less too.  \n\nI'm not trying to complain at all, in fact, their fries were REALLY good (light, fresh and crispy!) but I do appreciate that at our other favorite we have choices.  That aside, crab meat was plump and wonderful and sure did not disappoint : )  There really is a hefty amount of crab meat stuffed inside that bun for the \"large\" size order!\n\nI also must mention their mixed green salad too... this is IMO a VERY delish mixed green salad.  With sweet beets, heirloom tomatoes and goodies.  And their vinaigrette was perfect, just tart enough and sweet enough.  I felt that that helped balance out the rich chowder, butter drizzled crab roll and fries a bit : )\n\nThe bill was not cheap, but we saw on the receipt that you actually get a discount at Fraiche next doors for froyo if you show them the receipt!  Definitely an added perk.  We totally went over there and made dessert out of froyos to call the dining experience of the evening a smashing hit : )\n\nWe would love to try their lobster roll and other dishes the next time... and definitely come back for their yummy chowder too!", "author": "Sascha O."}

You'd think you were sitting along a pier from the scent alone.\n\nVisiting on a Wednesday evening, I met  a friend around 9 without reservations and was able to grab a table fairly quickly. \n\nThe specials chalked up on the board were a colorful combination of local ingredients highlighting a prized piece of the bay. Simple, yet direct, and layered in a smooth tone, the menu is an easy read.\n\nWhat I should've opted for were their famous and well known fish and chips, but a very rare voice within me, concerned about my arteries for Sunday's Marathon led me to the dungeness crab melt. ( in all honesty, I don't think the melt was any healthier... )\n\nServed on a small tray with a side of crisp fries, the dish was satisfying but lacked an inherent uniqueness. The crab was rich but the heavy melted cheese damped the flavor of the main show.\n\nThe staff embodies a neighborhood spirit and warms up the space gently. \n\nWoodhouse is a solid choice for seafood along Fillmore, and while I'll be back to devour the fish and chips soon, I'd suggest a few other places for sea dwellings in the city.", "author": "Mike K."}

Much like most people with proper sense of taste, I love fried foods. A guilty pleasure that  we all love, but not everyone is open to admitting it.\n\nWent with my wife and her cousin to this location. The weather was great and thought parking might be a bit better here. Not much parking in the area except a bunch of street parking.\n\nWe got there at the right time; they must have just opened as we were the only customers...minus the loners at the bar area.\n\nThe servers were great. They were very attentive and quick to get to you. It probably helped that we were the only ones there, but even 15 minutes later when the place completely filled up, they were still \"Johnny on the spot\" --- well the servers were all women, so more Janes, then Johnnys.\n\nWe started with the crispy calamari. I thought it was strange that they would call it that as I assumed the batter if fried would be crisp. Well, the reason they call it \"crispy\" is that the batter has some crunch granules...almost like it was covered with Special K cereal. There was a crunch, but definitely not \"crispy\". Regardless, the squid was bland. It had no flavor. It was lifeless in flavor. You dip it in the saffron-like aioli or the cocktail sauce and that is all you taste. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS.\n\nI had the 3 piece fish and chips, Mrs. had the crab melt and the cousin had the lobster roll.\n\nthe fish and chips were very disappointing. The fish, much like the calamari, had very little flavor. The batter was sloppy and over-battered. It was crunchy, but again no flavor. The tartar sauce had chunks of goodness in it and tasted fresh, so that saved the fish, but goodness...what is the deal...why not even a touch of flavor and why so  messy on the frying? \n\nThe crab melt looked good, but same situation. Just bland.\n\nThe lobster roll had promise, but when it came out, it was overly red in color. By that, I mean the meat was red which is usually a sign that it is mostly meat from the claw. The sweet goodness found in the tail was sadly not in the sandwich. You got the lobster flavor, but it didn't burst in your mouth.\n\nThe reason I didn't give this place one star is that the fries were awesome. They were crispy, they were tasty and had a nice hint of garlic on them. They were the stars. The rest was just blah.\n\nAll this blahness for $80 (total including tip). Not worth it. Don't bother.

Yum! The menu is short and sweet, but every day they have specials (I think they stay specials for a week or until they run out, then there are new ones). \n\nI've tried so many items off their set menu and their specials. \n\n- Clam chowder (new england) \n* Only ok to me. I like something more creamy.\n- Oysters\n* Always fresh and delicious, add a little tabasco and horseradish and it's just delicious\n- Split top maine lobster roll\n* Really good and you get chunks of lobster. \n- Fish & Chips\n* The fries are really good. I love crunchy fries and this is what you get with these. The fish is always moist inside, and the outside is crispy, never burnt\n- Stuffed artichoke\n* This is really delicious. You get one half of an artichoke stuffed with shrimp and the other half stuffed with crab. Both the shrimp and crab are really fresh. The artichoke is seasoned well\n- Dungeness crab (cracked and steamed in white wine, lemon & garlic butter)\n* This is one of my favorites, it was just really good. The crab is fresh and the sauce is so buttery and garlicky. It just goes together very well. It definitely takes time to enjoy all of it. \n- Baja style fish tacos\n* My bf DEVOURS these. It's one of his all time favorites and he almost always orders this. I never tried it but believe me, they must be good if they are gone in ten minutes flat. \n- Clam pasta\n* They had this clam linguini on the menu that doesn't seem to be there anymore but it's really tasty. This is saying a lot because I'm forever in love with Ernesto's clam linguini. \n\nTheir fish specials have never disappointed. So venture off the menu and check it out.

The steamed clams are the best I've ever had, the clams are fresh, fat and juicy; the garlic/butter/white wine sauce is to die for, we save the sauce for dipping garlic bread, regular bread, shoestring fries, lobster roll, crab roll. \n\nI discovered WH whilst on the search for a lobster roll as good as Pearl's Oyster Bar in NYC and got more than I asked for, I think it's even better. Just the perfect mix of lobster, mayo, celery & tarragon with buttered brioche bun toasted to perfection. We also love the Dungeness crab roll for its warm buttery fresh crab meat also in a toasted brioche bun. \n\nAnother thing to love about WH is that it's a family business and they actually care about being environmentally responsible; they only serve fish deemed \"Best Choice\" or \"Good Alternative\" by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Guide.

The waitress, knowing that the total tab was about to hit triple digits graciously obliged the change.  All that food sounded great at the time, but by the end of it, I was stuffed and felt gorged...my own fault.   My dumb story doesn't take away from the real point of my review .

I had the same amount of lobster as everyone else --- if not the same, then really close to it! I didn't feel like I didnt have enough, and I think my friends actually realized the 3 oz would have been a been a better size.  Regardless, it was really fresh and even better with some lemon squeezed on it, but I wish the lobster had a slight mayo base. If not mayo, something that would make it a little less dry.  I realize that the \"expensive\" lobster rolls usually don't have a  mayo base, so I guess that's just a personal taste.\n\nEither way though, it was yum.

They were delicious and very fresh.\n\nI would definitely check out the specials next time since those were extremely tempting.  Or just go with a few people and share.\n\nService was quick and friendly.  It was a bit crowded so expect a wait, but the servers do a good job of coming around and checking on you.", "author": "Jason K."}

We shared an appetizer, fried squash blossoms on slices of heirloom tomatoes, which was truly delicious. I'd never had a squash blossom before so this was a wonderful introduction. I ordered the special of the day, roasted sea bream, with mixed vegetables and a fried potato pancake. The fish was excellent. It was stuffed with garlic and basil, not the usual dressings for a fish, but very flavorful indeed. For dessert I ordered the sourdough bread pudding with rum reduction sauce and topped with homemade whipped cream. After eating a whole fish my goal of eating dessert was lofty, at best. However, what I could manage to shovel down was really good. The use of sourdough bread gave the pudding a tangy taste, offset by spices and the sweetness of the whipped cream. \n\nAs usual the service was really great. It could not have been a better day, nor a better meal.", "author": "Courtney S."}

My sister and I waited patiently for a table to be ready while my 2 friends were having trouble parking.  When the 2 of us were seated, we ordered 30 oysters to start so that it wouldn't look like we were going to sit there for another 30 minutes with no food on the table.  My 2 friends came in 10 minutes later.  They weren't even in their seats yet when our skinny blonde and black haired server came and asked if they wanted drinks.  They asked for 2 more minutes to settle down so she walked away.  Then, I am not exaggerating when I say, she came back less than a few minutes later and asked in a VERY rude tone \"are you guys gonna order anything else but oysters?\".  That was horrible.  It made me feel like she was looking down on us as if that was all we were going to get.  So what if that was all that we wanted?   We all exchanged WTF-faces and began ordering.  She also waited impatiently while we were ordering.\n\nBy the end of the meal, we have had 54 oysters, 2 ceviche specials, a large bowl of chowder, friend calamari, lobster roll, crab roll, 1 lemonade, and 4 beers.  That's a lot of stuff!  Everything was delicious as always. Ingredients were fresh.  No complaint here (:\n** The host, busser, and other servers who came by were all very nice.\n\nAfter we ordered so much food, she got a bit nicer but still cold.  She couldn't even take 2 seconds to stop and say thank you when she dropped off our check later.  She just walked by and drop it off on her way to her next destination with no eye contact or thank you to us.  My friend quietly asked me at the end of the meal if it was frowned upon to only order oysters.  My 13 year old sister even said \"she's really mean\".  To have a kid say something like is a big no no.\n\nI understand that it was a really busy night.  I really do and am not judging her based on that.  We're not extremely high maintenance people who demands everything to be perfect.  It's the attitude that really erks me.  I'm in the industry myself and know that that's not the way to treat your customers.  She was rude and insincere.\n\nThis was suppose to be a 5 star review but service is very important to me.  I really love this place.  But she made it clear that it wasn't a 5 star night.  If we're going to spend $180 +/- for the meal, we want to be treated that way.  If we wanted to be talked down to, we would go to Denny's after 2 am on a friday night.\n\nI would still come back but I'll definitely ask NOT to be in her section, even if I have to wait another 30 minutes.", "author": "Soph T."}

Lunch was scheduled for 2pm, so I was starving and actually excited for some seafood-y goodness, even though seafood isn't ever my #1 pick for a meal.  \n\nI did very little research on Woodhouse since the plans were kind of last minute, so I went in not knowing what to expect.  I arrive to find a fun and upbeat atmosphere with friendly hostesses and servers.  While awaiting on my dining companion, I decided on glass of Sauvignon Blanc (the quality was pretty crappy and it should've been a $1 less) while perusing the menu. \n\nThis is NOT your place if you're on a diet.  Almost everything is fried on the menu--don't get me wrong, I do enjoy fried food every once in awhile, but it would've been nice to have some more non-fried options to choose from.  \n\nWe split:\n-fish and chips, made with wild Alaskan cod served atop shoestring french fries (good, but super greasy--i did love the tartar sauce that came served with it)\n-Baja style fish tacos, made with more cod with cabbage, pico de gallo, and avocado (really good, but hard to eat, and they were skimpy with the avocado, but I love avocado and could eat a whole one daily).\n\nIn general, the food is better than mediocre, but I thought it was a bit overpriced.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-12", "description": "Went here with a friend who had recommended this place because she claimed that the lobster roll was super delish.  I had only tried lobster rolls in NY, and so I was curious how the west coast version would fare compared to the east.  My verdict: nice attempt, but Luke's Lobster in NY is the hands down champ when it comes to lobster rolls.\n\nThey have 2 \"sizes\" of lobster and crab rolls.  More accurately speaking, they aren't necessarily referring to the size, but rather the amount of lobster meat that is in the roll.  The larger \"size\" contains twice the meat as the single size.  I believe the prices for the lobster roll (with fries) were 18 & 26.  I ordered the single size, while my friend ordered the double portion.  In my opinion, the single size didn't contain enough lobster meat.  And although they weren't super mayo-y, there was more mayo and other fillings in addition to the lobster.  And between the lobster and crab roll, the crab roll didn't even come close.  If you have to choose one, I'd opt for the lobster roll.  If I was giving a rating solely based on the lobster roll, I'd give it a 3.\n\nAside from the rolls, we also ordered oysters, tuna tartare, and the cioppino.  The oysters were super fresh and sweet, the tuna tartare was also amazing, and the cioppino was flavorful and satisfying on a cold night.  Our appetizers and entree definitely bumped up my overall rating from a 3 to a 4.", "author": "Jackie K."}

The decor is cozy casual - waiters are wearing Woodhouse baseball caps and t-shirts instead of button downs, and there is a big screen playing scenes of the Bay along one wall.

I was hoping to like it, as the whole Woodhouse experience had been quite delightful thus far, but found that the food kind of fell flat. My tacos were tasty - fried fish, cabbage, that zesty light orange sauce found on all fish tacos - but there was really nothing special about them, and they came with no side anything. Just three pretty standard tacos on a plate. \n\nMy friend's salmon was a large portion and served on crispy polenta, but the fish itself was a little dry and lacked the flavor you would expect from a fish house.

Not bad, but I realized this sandwich is for people who really like oysters, not for someone like me that only likes Po' Boys because I could care less what you deep fry and stick in a sandwich as long as the dressing and herbs/spices are good.

You see, it was our 1 year wedding anniversary and in our book, celebrating with (lots of) fresh seafood is how we roll.\n\nWe must have gotten to WFC at just the right time because a table opened up that was perfect for 2 grown ups and a little dude in a stroller. No attitude about the kidlet, just a nice friendly welcome and a speedy seating at a clean table.\n\nWe tend to over do it at times like these and today was no exception. Though, we did exercise a little restraint and opted out on oysters. What we did go for was the large lobster roll, the 3 piece fish and chips, and the seafood iceberg salad. The roll and the fish came with perfectly fried thin and crispy fries, and a little cup of coleslaw. \n\nThe lobster roll was jam-packed with lobster, and in a word: delicious. (which is a lot coming from me since I'm more of a crab fan) The grilled bread is New England all the way.\n\nThe fish on the fish and chips was light and crispy and fried to absolute perfection. Not at all greasy or soggy.\n\nThe salad was covered with crab. So much so, that you could barely see the lettuce underneath it all. \n\nDid I mention how yummy and crispy and lightly salted to perfection the fries were? I did? Well, they were that good.\n\nA couple of general things worth mentioning about WFC: they use crushed ice in their drinks (fun! totally old school). The wine list, while not adventurous, is nicely priced and well-paired with the menu. The service is friendly and prompt. The prices are fair. Not too cheap, not too pricey. Parking, not so great, but that's the City for you... what're you gonna do?\n\nWoodhouse Fish Company is one of those places that doesn't always pop to the front of my mind when I'm thinking of places to eat in SF, but when it does, I always wonder why I don't think of it more often. Especially since it's so consistently yummy and just a nice place to spend an afternoon. Or 45 minutes.

The best, and I suppose most important, thing to say is that they know how to cook fish. As in, they understand that fish is not supposed to taste like a McDonald's Fish Fillet (surprising how many restaurants \"aim\" for this particular accomplishment). They know that lobster isn't supposed to be rubbery and that fish shouldn't ever be \"well done.\" \n\nThe only thing I took away an extra star for is the overabundance of breading, oil and fried stuff on their menu. Except for their $1 Oyster specials (YAY), they don't seem to do much raw or grilled food. Hey I get it - mayo and breadcrumbs are seafood's natural homies. But come on people.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-12", "description": "Woodhouse deserves special recognition for helping my family with a difficult situation, a situation staff had no idea we were facing, one we never mentioned. They solved an invisible problem, which helped my stepmother and me enjoy a calm dinner with my father. The father I am gradually losing.\n\nYou see, my father has Alzheimer's. Since he is in fabulous physical shape, he doesn't \"look\" impaired or frail. However, eating out with him in restaurants has become challenging. About three years ago, I suggested Le Colonial, not knowing my father had this problem, as I live out of town, and it was before his diagnosis. It was too noisy for him, and disorienting. He started to become agitated. Eventually, he WAS agitated, and yelling. A new or noisy environment sets it off.\n\nMy father still does well at Pasta Pomodoro because he's a regular who's eaten there hundreds of times. But my stepmother gets weary of endless Pasta Pomodoro. And since I no longer live in the City, my stepmother wisely wants me to have a treat. So while she and I were out for a movie, she suggests we call my father and ask to meet us at Woodhouse on Fillmore. He has already been to Woodhouse on Market, and loved the lobster roll, so this seemed like a prudent compromise.\n\nSo we arrive around 6:30 p.m., Thursday, Dec. 29. Since I don't know these people's names, I'm going into specificity. We get on the table list. A handsome, bearded, 29-ish and incredibly sweet man takes our name and says about 15 minutes for a table. Perfect. By the time my dad arrives, we will already be seated, and that will reduce potential for agitation.  (If the answer had been 45, we would have left.) Woodhouse is a calmer, quieter, family type place. We should be OK, with luck.\n\nBut 15 minutes went by and no table. (Meanwhile, we have a whole separate set of worries: While my dad has never been lost, it could happen any day.) The host is super nice, apologizes for the delay, and reassures us he is working on our table as soon as another party leaves. He explains so nicely - the reason for the delay is the others ordered dessert. Completely understandable. Meanwhile, my father shows up. Whew! But now the table worry rises into view again. After 3 minutes, my father is starting to pace. We can feel his agitation coming on. Meanwhile, my stepmother and I are starting to pop in every few minutes to check status, trying to act cool. And the host patiently says to me \"Don't worry, you can wait outside. I promise I will come and get you.\" He's just so sincere, I absolutely trust him. Meanwhile, Dad is pacing. Not frantically, not something that anyone who doesn't already know him would likely notice. But we know what it means. At one point, immediately after we had explained the table status to my dad yet again, he goes in himself and talks to Peaceful Lovely Bearded Man (I feel he needs a name). I have no idea what he said to PLBM, but my dad came back outside again. Meanwhile as we are waiting outside, PLBM came out on his own at least two times to give us updates on the table status and to reassure us. Then, after perhaps 30-40 minutes total, PLBM comes out to tell us our table is ready! Whew! Now waiting 40 minutes for a table on Fillmore on a busy holiday weekend is nothing radical. Heck, that might even be an average night's wait. But in our situation, it could have been a dangerously long fuse.\n\nSo we sit at our table. My dad is a former Coast Guard officer, as well as a lighthouse buff, so the d\u00e9cor is the perfect soothing ambiance for him. And the next wonderful staff member steps up to the table: our server. (Management: We sat in first booth on right across from counter.) She was a beautiful woman, about 25, slightly round face, with long dark-brown hair pulled neatly into a ponytail. The female equivalent of PLBM aka PLUnbeardedW. She was so unhurried, so patient. She listened to our menu questions. She connected with us, easily and naturally. I realize everything is going to be fine. The invisible situation has been defused. \n\nMy dad got his Lobster Roll again and loved it, although he never remembered eating before at Market Street. I had crab cakes - yum. However, I was modest and only ordered two, so I was still kinda hungry. PLUW recommended the Hartford chowder, which is a combination of New England (white) and Manhattan (red) chowder. Another YUM. I need to hurry back for that.\n\nLa pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of this lovely dining experience? Dessert. Dear, sweet PLBM came over to our table as we were finishing our dinner, and apologized again that we had to wait. Not only did he apologize, he offered to buy us dessert! Now that's service. We went for the sourdough bread pudding, which was yummy too.\n\nPLBM, I hope you recognize this tale, and our party, so you know how truly grateful I am.

I asked for two sides of bread to mop up the remaining broth and it was quite a filling meal.\n\nI'd also recommend the do-it-yourself lemonade, which is similar to what you find at Rose's Cafe. Delish!\n\nI would come here again, but only the Fillmore location. The Market location is kind of old and stuffy.", "author": "Wendy T."}

It's casual with huge airy windows that give the small space an open feel. The food and beverage was lacking, however and the whole menu is just a few ticks above fast food. The wine list was very sparse and the beer choices were equally puny. In general I found the food to be lacking in flavor.  The beer battered fish for fish and chips was the exact same thing used in the fish tacos. The batter was doughy and turned to mush at the first sprinkle of malt vinegar. The oysters were good but not fabulous. They were lacking in liquor and brine. Clam chowder was ok. The peach cobbler desert was bland and was served at a scalding temperature having been blasted In the microwave too long. No ice cream accompaniment only some whipped cream which quickly dissipated.  With all the SF choices for seafood, this place needs to step up their game.", "author": "C S."}

I thorough enjoyed making a mess while devouring each and every leaf, and more than once I forgot proper etiquette and licked my fingers. Sorry neighboring diners, it was just too good. Loved there was no mayo in the seafood, but healthy yelpers be warned, the artichoke was definitely grilled up with plenty of butter and oil.\n\nWe ended with another excellent dish, the strawberry shortcake. Large enough for the three of us to share and get quite a few scoops each, we all thought it was rather tasty. Not to mention the joy that comes with realizing you are having strawberries in January.

They had one type of oyster that was small called Kumamoto which is great for people who don't normally like that oyster taste but want to develop their palate. Aka: an intro to oysters oyster. Very sweet. Buttery. \nThe other two types of oysters were great too. \nNo trouble getting a seat at 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon either which was shocking. I'm sure it's worse during happy hour. \n\nNote: Lobster rolls mysteriously have two prices, as do the crab rolls. The smaller price is for 3 ounces of lobster, and the bigger is for double the lobster. It all comes on the same yummily buttered and toasted bread roll though. So you can either have a reasonable amount of lobster or your lobster can be dripping down your arms. Your call. Three ounces may not sound like a lot but it's a good portion size. Seven dollars more lets you be a fattie. Fries are great. Well-seasoned and perfectly crisped. Cole slaw was whatever.", "author": "Candice L."}

My husband and I headed to \"Woodhouse\" for a late lunch and found parking atrocious (but it is the city) so not too bad. \n     -Arrived around 4:30 on a Sunday\n     -Upon walking in we found the place quaint and on its way to being very occupied. Decor was nice and made us want to stick around for yum yum food. \n     -Ordered the cup of clam chowder as recommended by most Yelpers! I would have to say it was very good although I am not a clam chowder connoisseur. Lots of clams and potatoes and zero pieces of sand. Overall great flavor. Are these things that make for good chowder? If so, thumbs up. \n    -Ordered a dozen oysters. 6 were Hood Canal oysters from the west coast and 6 were Blue Point oysters from the east coast. \n     The west coast version had a very \"oceany\" taste. Not bad but they did have a hint of seaweed flavoring but with an awesome texture. \n     Now the east coast oysters were meatier, had no oceany flavor and were our favorite. Regarding the west coast oysters; I'm not sure if you can knock the oyster preparers for having pieces of shell in the oyster that made it hard to really enjoy it but if they could keep an eye on that, everything would have been perfect with both oyster varieties. I don't mind a small shell or two but I had to pick at my tongue at least 6 times to get the shell out. \n     -We both ordered the daily specials, my honey ordered the \"Sauteed Salmon\" which came with summer squash Au-gratin and smoked bacon & leeks over spinach. \n     - I ordered the \"Grilled Mahi Mahi\" which came with mango salsa, mixed vegetables, and jasmine rice.\n     -My husbands choice was beyond great. His salmon was sauteed to perfection with a light and crispy crunch and then leeks with a little bacon served over spinach and a side of squash Au-gratin. The flavors mixed well and he stated that he would definitely order it again.\n     -My mahi mahi was light and was served over rice mixed with vegetables. It seemed like something that a person with stomach issues would order because it was so light. To be fair, mahi mahi is a light tasting fish but it tasted like it required something more. What would that something be? I'll leave that to the cook. I would rather have something with more substance for dinner....but I would order that particular mahi mahi dish for lunch. \n     ++++Overall this place was amazing if a little pricey with a total bill of $80. For dinner...not too bad. The oysters were awesome with lemon, horseradish and cocktail sauce, the waitress and host were friendly and helpful, our dishes were awesome (my husbands) and pretty good (mine) and the chowder was pretty great on a cold night in SF.

When I first walked in, I thought it was super cute for a small fish restaurant, but right from the start the server gave us trouble for wanting to seat 10 people. We were willing to divide up into multiple tables (better... no group tax/service fee), but he was still being really odd about it... and it wasn't even crowded yet! We made sure to beat the dinner crowds and got there at 5:30pm on a Saturday. My table (1 out of 3) ordered some appetizers and dinner. I ordered the lobster roll, others ordered the fish tacos, seared tuna special, and stuffed artichoke special. \n\nMy table was having a good time laughing, talking, and eating our appetizer when we realized how much time has passed (an hour).... and we still didn't get out food yet. That's when we looked at the other two tables and realized they were FINISHING their meals! When we asked our server about our food, he didn't apologized or anything-- brushed it off as if one of our orders, which was on the special menu, took awhile.... uhhhh... if it was on the Special/Food of the Day menu, wouldn't you think that item would be faster to prepare? \n\nWhen we FINALLY got our food, we had to rush to eat it because our friends at the other two tables were long done and just waiting for us. We spent over two hours in that place. \n\nSure, the food was good, but the service was horrible. We didn't feel bad holding up the three tables during Saturday rush dinner hour because it was their fault. \n\nAwful server, bad service, and long waits.... no bueno.\n\nNot good for groups.

Everything looked so good we had a difficult time deciding what to order.  I had my heart set on the cioppino, but the server sold us on the pacu fish ribs.  What an ingenious idea, to cut fish into ribs, baste it in bbq sauce and grill it like it's turf-wandering counterpart?\n\nMy girlfriend and I agreed the cioppino was delicious.  Hearty and more substantial than some of the thinner broth-type cioppino's we'd tried in the past, and loaded with all manners of marine goodness upon which were placed two slices of garlic cheese broiled toast.  SO GOOD!\n\nThe fish ribs were just as tasty, and we were surprised by how moist and succulent they were.  The server had described them as being like swordfish, but they weren't as 'meaty'.  I'd say the texture was between swordfish and black cod.  Firmer than cod, but there was a little bit of that melt-in-your-mouth quality too.  The bbq was perfect with just the right bit of smokiness and tang.  The only thing we didn't touch much of was the coleslaw.\n\nAnd you have to try the fruit crisp a la mode if they have it as a special.

I ordered the bigger size roll and she ordered the cioppino and we shared. The roll was toasted perfectly, the shoe string fries were just perfect but then we get to the actual lobster part. It was pretty much lobster with a bunch of mayonnaise just thrown on top. If you want a lobster roll that highlights the flavor of the lobster with what they mix with it, this isn't the place for you. If you love smothering mayonnaise on everything because you are a fat American, then by all means spend your $26 on this. Maybe I came on an off day but I was not satisfied with it and it border lined gross. Since all the other components were there it helped make up for the lackluster lobster. The cioppino was tasty. I have had better elsewhere but it was nice and warm broth with tasty seafood. There were scallops which were nice, the shrimp were perfect and there was no sand in the clams and mussels even though they were tiny. The crab was also tasty. So overall a good product that came with garlic bread to soak up the juices. After leaving we were full but the lobster roll is what we wanted and we left disappointed because we wanted to like it from all the positivity we've seen on it.

Luckily,  I was meeting some friends up for dinner at Woodhouse!  \n\nThe oysters definitely hit the spot.  So fresh, so smooth.  \n\nI also ordered real food this time.  I shared a bowl of Clam Chowder (white) and a Bay Shrimp and Avocado Sandwich with a friend.  The Clam Chowder came out lukewarm...which is a big NO NO.  I HATE lukewarm food!  I asked to have it reheated, which was no problem (I hope!).  Even when it was cold, it was one of the best clam chowders I've ever had.  It was not too salty and the clam taste is distinct and present.   When it came out steaming...I inhaled it.  The sandwich was messy but still tasty.  A little too much mayo for me...but I should have expected it.  The fries and slaw that came with the sandwich were addicting.  I couldn't stop eating them!  Thankfully..the night was busy and the server took the fries away from me before I got a chance to clean off my tray. \n\nOverall, a solid seafood restaurant.

My friend has been raving about them for their dishes like they were the best invention since chocolate cake so there was no way I wasn't going to give it a try.\n\nI came in on a random weeknight and there was a wait.  Well, it is Fillmore afterall.  What do you expect?\n\nAfter about 30 minutes of waiting,  we were finally seated in a tiny two top in the middle of a crowded room.  Did I ever mention I detest close knit tables with a PASSION?  Oh wells.\n\nWe ordered:\nCrispy Calamari\nFish & Chips\nCrab Cakes\n\nThe crispy calamari was fried to perfection and served with tartar sauce and marinara(?).  It was good but nothing to write home about.\n\nAlthough I didn't get to eat the fish and chips, it looked so delicious in all its glory.  Huge crispy pieces of fish with a hint of fresh squeezed lemon, dipped in a creamy tartar sauce - it was enough to make my heart skip a beat...in a good way!\n\nThe crab cakes were stuffed with crab and all things tasty, just the way it's supposed to be.  There were more crab than there were filling and it was dressed with a nice, spicy chipotle sauce and paired with a crisp, spring salad.   \n\nEven though it sounded like everything was fried (in this case, it was), the meal was surprisingly light yet fulfilling.  Everything was solid but in no way was it earth shattering the way some people made it seem...All it is is good, solid seafood dishes made well to taste good.\n\nOriginally I was going to give them a 3.5 star rating but because of our awesome server, they deserve 4 stars!

We were greeted warmly at the door and offered our choice of tables - a pre-8pm luxury.  The bar seating looked inviting and afforded a nice view of the classically framed flat TV showing clips of the fishing industry, then and now.  Our affable server, Zia, welcomed us and recommended the BBQ Oysters and the Roasted Fish of the day (Sea Bass).  We added a couple cups of the Clam Chowder, opting for the creamy tomato Hartford and the creamy New England (an all tomato variant, the Manhattan, is also available).  A couple of beers and the evening was set for a tasty experience.  \nThe restaurant, decorated with a nautical/fish industry vibe, is very welcoming, relaxed and inviting.  On par is the fast, friendly service complemented by the delicious execution of the fresh food.  We thoroughly enjoyed the well proportioned cups of Clam Chowder followed by the delicious BBQ oysters (4 to an order).  Our efficient food runner and busser kept our water glasses topped and cleared the bar for our shared main course of roasted sea bass.  The whole fish was charred to perfection and was neither dry nor over seasoned.  The accompanying cauliflower and sauce was an excellent compliment to the overall balance of flavors.  While not intending to, we indulged on dessert, ordering the Sourdough Bread Pudding - a concoction of texture and subdued flavor that finished the meal perfectly.\nGreat service and scrumptious food served in a well designed and casual environment.

Eh, the first time I guess my friend and I didn't need it, and the second time, it was brought promptly with lots of butter as soon as I asked for it. Also, both times the service was super friendly.\n\nThe first time, I had the Dungeness crab melt which had plenty of crab and plenty of melt - melty cheese that is. I enjoyed that thoroughly and had a refreshingly biting fresh lemonade. My friend had the DIY Arnold Palmer; I like that since I think there's usually not enough lemonade.\n\nThe second time I was fiending for seafood, and with most other places in my neighborhood closed or serving sushi which I just had, I opted to return here. I was the last person seated and decided to go for the gold. I had a few oysters - very fresh - served with lemons and cocktail sauce with horseradish. I like my cocktail sauce a bit more chunky and spicy, but mix in the horseradish, a squeeze of lemon, and some dashes of Tabasco, and it's all good. I also ordered the wedge salad which was ok. It was actually drowning in dressing, I mean like at least 6 oz, but the dressing had lots of bleu cheese, and I just scraped the extra dressing off to the side. Better too generous, I guess. Then came the half Dungeness crab cooked in white wine and garlic. Very tender and delicious. That's when I had to ask for bread and butter to sop up that white wine sauce. Geez, I made a mess. Picked a sauvignon blanc to a sip alongside made for nice late meal.\n\nAs a fan of seafood served from the humblest cart by the beach in the tropics to high end, I am glad to find a comfy and clean moderately priced spot in my hood that is reminiscent of family seafood shacks close to the water with its decidedly angler bent decor. Next time, I'll put the fish and chips to the test.", "author": "Myla A."}

It's a small place and can fill up very quickly. The seating is particularly tight and high stress if you're seated by the hosts' stand, which is situated smack dab in the front of the restaurant. The orientation of the restaurant is a bit odd, there's a bar in the back which doesn't seem to have much room for a bartender let alone drinks on shelves. We were situated pretty close to the bar, but somewhat comfortably. Here's my abbreviated rundown to save you time:\n\n1. Ordered fish and chips, everything is deep fried (as expected), but the batter if fluffy.\n\n2. Ordered 2 crab cakes, comes with a side of salad w/ beets. The beets were a nice touch as well as the chipotle sauce.\n\n3. Ordered a bowl of clam chowder. This was ok, but I wouldn't get again since it had a strong flavor of butter (cook was maybe trying to fix something?)\n\n4. Ordered the fish tacos. These came as a slight surprise since they were deep fried as well. The taco shells are soft, but hard in some places. Still a good choice despite the shells flaw.\n\n\nI'd come back again, the food is pretty good and the fish and chips are legit.", "author": "Wil M."}

Really wanted to like this place and was happy when food arrived and they looked like the pics on yelp. Everything LOOKED delicious.  We ordered the large lobster roll, crab cake, and fish n chips.  Unfortunately, all the dishes were not salted enough and lacked flavor.  Couldn't taste the crab in the crab cake, the lobster in the lobster roll, the fish in the fish n chip.  What hurt most was the lobster cos it was $26. I think this is because the seafood is brought in frozen and not fresh.  When you bite into lobster its waterlogged.  What was good was oysters and fries which were more like pomme frittes. Also batter on fish n chip was one of best I've had as it was light and crispy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-24", "description": "This micro-chain seafood restaurant is one of the best I have been to. This intimate fish house has one thing in common with Luna Park, one of my other favorite SF restaurants: value. The food is fresh and delicious and reasonably priced. And I must say much better than anything the tourists are eating over at Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nI started out the evening with the special appetizer: Tuna Tartare. I know...I know, it's a culinary cliche and overdone, but it's yummy. This was good, but could have done with a touch more acid. The tuna was delicious and fresh, but the fat from the avocado and tuna seemed to mute the flavors of the dish overall.\n\nNext came the Lobster Roll which was fan-effing-tastic. The roll was buttered and grilled with tons of lobster meat that was perfectly cooked and dressed. The lobster was tender, sweet, and chilled just enough to give a nice contrast to the warm buttery roll. And a bargain at $16.00. It is served with coleslaw and fries. The slaw was a slam dunk. I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw, but if it is on the plate, then I'll usually eat it. This was perfectly balanced with a slight sweetness (from a little bit of apple I think) that really brought out the sweetness of the lobster roll. The fries were tasty - you know the kind, lightly seasoned with a light dusting of cornstarch before frying to give them a little texture.\n\nAnd for dessert...a buttermilk panna cotta with sliced mango. I'm not a huge fan of dessert, but this rounded off the meal with just the right tanginess from the buttermilk to cut the richness from the lobster.\n\nThey don't take reservations, so plan on waiting for a table. When we arrived the wait was 40 minutes, but the host took our cell number and called us when a table opened up. Service overall was excellent, but I must say what keeps them from that fifth star was the timing. Our courses came a little too close together and our entrees were fired much too soon. The hot food in our entrees wasn't so hot when it arrived at our table, which was shortly before we finished our appetizers. The kitchen may have been having an off night and prices are so reasonable at this place that I'm guessing they rely on fairly quick turnover to keep the lights on.\n\nOne thing that has to go is the 'DIY Lemonade'. When you order the lemonade, it is brought in three glasses. The lemon juice in a glass with ice, a small decanter of soda water and a smaller decanter of simple syrup. To get lemonade, just pour and stir. It's hokey and it doesn't taste any better than when someone in the kitchen does it for me, so I don't get it. And all those glasses and decanters clutter up the table.\n\nThree appetizers+Three entrees+Three desserts+Three DIY Lemonades=less than $130.", "author": "Joshua R."}

Oh well, love it or hate it...\n\nGood thing I braved the peer pressure and stuck around for the three cheese and crab melt, though...holy hell that was good! ($8.95). We also got the lobster roll ($15.95) which was bursting with lobster meat and totally yummy (although I honestly prefer crab to lobster). The DIY strawberry lemonade was another great experience...they bring all the ingredients out to you and you make it to your own liking...\n\nVery good seafood, reasonable prices, a nice environment and not too crowded (on a weeknight).

However, they have bowed to contemporary tastes and have a reasonable wine selection and some slightly more sophisticated dishes. Primarily, though, this still seems like a blue-collar traditional seafood restaurant with a selection of oysters, lobster sandwiches clam sandwiches and such, all fresh and served with a smile.  The person dining next to me at the bar seemed like a regular, and really endorsed the lobster rolls, so that's what I will get next time. I ordered and enjoyed the blackened cod special, with a hash of vegetables saut\u00e9ed in butter. It was subtle (as blackened fish can be), if not an exquisite dish. I am used to a more New Orleans style blackened, which would be much more spicy than this, but I still found it quite pleasant - cooked to perfection albeit under spiced.", "author": "whit e."}

Thought the story was over. \n\nThe next day, , saw the itemized receipt and found that they charged me $12 for the kids meal and not $6. Called up restaurant n were told that kids meal for fish and chips is the same as a 2 piece fish and chips from adults menu. Told the manager that the server told me it was $6. Manager insisted that only grilled cheese and pasta was $6, without even checking with server. In good faith, I ordered the kids meal even tho no menu was available. Cannot believe that a kids meal is a kids meal charged at grown up pricing,. Felt cheated. No wonder, they do not have a kids' menu so that they can charge kids meal at adult prices. If only pasta and grilled cheese is $6, server should have told us. Or could have told us that they only offer grilled cheese and pasta for kids. He should never even say fish and chips is a kids meal at all, let alone charged me from an adult menu. \n\nTold the manager we already had a bad wait yesterday n manager said he already offered us dessert. Said there was nothing he could do. Told him that his server made a mistake and he needs to rectify that. Manager said something that made me feel like I was trying to get a good deal, n said that the restaurant was now very crowded now n that I was making him cry in front of his customers, he yelled and said \"How much $ do I want, $10, $ 20? I told him that all he had to do was credit me back $ 5 (the difference between the price) and that if he is so uptight and upset about it, don't bother. \n\nOh well, maybe I should have asked for the taxes and service charge on that $5 too.

Or to be more exact, there was a trend to make rustic seafood dining in to fine dining.  The lobster boil would be poured on to your table, potato, corn, the lobsters, and clams.  All of this was ceremoniously dumped on to a picnic table covered with brown paper inside a huge warehouse decorated to look and feel like an old time New England lobster shack.  You got a plastic bib.  And you roll up your sleeves and dig in, bracing your feet against the picnic table posts.  When it came time for the check, you paid as much for that \"rustic\" experience as you would at Gary Danko.  \n\nThis place mimics that feeling.  Wanna be rustic, simple, wholesome, hearty food, but priced like an upscale dining room.  \n\nI ordered a lobster roll.  $17.  It had a lot of lobster and the bread was so deliciously buttered and split down the top.  In the end, I liked the bread more than the lobster filling.  \n\nIt was served on a F**King 1/8 baking sheet.  An aluminum baking sheet.  What?  Am I not paying a truck-ton of money for this?  Why can't I have a real plate?  I don't want a stupid baking sheet.  I don't care if that's how they do it in New England, they don't charge $17 effing dollars for a trucking lobster roll in New England!  For a while, McDonalds was serving lobster rolls in New England too!  Since it's not New England, and you're graping me up the ying yang with the price, would it kill you to serve that roll on a plate?  Please?  Who's brilliant idea was this?  Who thought this'd be \"cute\" and \"exciting\"?  \n\nAt least the server was really really nice.  He deserved better than I.  \n\nWe ordered 1/2 dozen oysters that arrived at our table in worse condition than Lindsey Lohan on Oprah that time.  I thought instead of an oyster knife, maybe the shucker just used his teeth.  There was no briny juice left in the shells.  The oyster was mangled and the gills were torn asunder.

The crispy calamari was really good and the portion generous. The same was true of the fish and chips. You can get three pieces of fish or two. Next time I will opt for two because after three pieces I was stuffed and did not have room for the chips. They make a pretty good cioppino that is served with garlic bread.  The garlic bread is among the best I have ever had. The cioppino is another matter and I find it hard to rate. People rave about the cioppino and my feeling is that it is slightly above average for $25 and would be very good at $20, if that makes sense. I guess, stated another way, the cioppino was overpriced and for $25 the roasted fish of the day is a better value.\n\nIn sum, I think that for the most part WFC, which by the way does not accept reservations,  is a good reliable restaurant that I see myself going to three to four times a year.", "author": "Chocoolate I."}

It is a bit pricey for the amount of food you get, however I pretty much savored each and every bite that my cousin would let me steal of his roll. My crab melt was also very delicious. I do wish they had used the same break on my crabmelt (more of a bun) than on my lobster roll (more slices of bread) but both were still absolutely amazing. Another friend ordered the Ciopinno and that was also spectacular. It was very clean, very fresh, and not too salty as many are. It also came with a good amount of seafood which is fantastic with Ciopinno's since they are usually one of the more pricier items on the menu. Really a delicious restaurant with a great casual feel to it.\n\nAlso another great thing about this restaurant is the location since it is located central on Fillmore.

Every Tuesday is their $1 oysters special. I was hesitant as to how good of a deal this was. $1 per oysters? There must be something fishy going on. I was pleasantly blown away by how fresh and how succulent the oysters were! They were big cool briny and slight sweet. Shucked properly too because the edges of the shell didn't fall into my oysters, which is a pet peeve of mine. They'll give you extra lemons and cocktail sauce if you ask. Yum oh yum! From Washington State. We had 24 oysters for $24. What a deal! \n\nWe also had their fried Ipwich Bellied Clams with tartar sauce. Absolutely divine! It wasn't overly fried. The clams held on to their tenderness and to their inkiness. AGH! SO GOOD! \n\nGot onion rings too. The onion rings were clearly thrown into batter and then thrown into the fire right after. You can see the sizzle leave holes in the batter, which means it was just freshly made on the spot. It wasn't like they left the onion rings in the batter overnight. I'm not a big fan of onion rings but they were very respectable. \n\nThen we had the artichokes s with shrimp and lobster. They gave us one HUGE artichoke sliced in half and stuffed with shrimp in one half and lobster in the other half. Served over a bed of yummy herbal salad. Yummy as well! The artichoke was grilled so it had a nice smoky tinge to it while the interior was melt-in-your-mouth soft. It was a lot of work to graze off the edible parts from each artichoke leaf. But that's how it is with artichoke! \n\nThen we topped it off with their strawberry shortcake! This is the real-deal strawberry shortcake done right and classic. The old-fashioned way. The shortcake was still warm and crisp from the oven. The whipped cream was made from scratch. None of that from-a-can thing going on. Absolutely light and creamy and soft whipped cream! And their strawberry drizzle was sweet! Altogether, the combination was superb! This is an authentic strawberry shortcake. It was pretty big for one serving, so do share it with someone else. Enjoy!\n\nI'd come back here again for their $1 oysters on Tuesdays and their strawberry shortcake. Haven't tried other items on the menu but I kept eying other people's dishes. They sure looked yummy!", "author": "Pamela L."}

Currently, they are only open for lunch, but will open for dinner once they receive their liquor license. \n\nI ordered the the lobster roll  and the \"do it yourself\" lemonade. The lobster roll was bursting with huge pieces of lobster on a slice of thick buttery toast. The lemonade came with a small carafe of water and sugar so you can blend the lemonade to your own taste. My bf ordered the fish and chips. \n\nThe fish was flaky and melts in your mouth. I was trying to eat my lobster as ladylike as possible, but there was so much lobster that it literally dropped into my carafe. I only realized this after I continue to make my lemonade.

Is the place really wonderful?  I go to find out.\n\nFirst let me say that the place is new and still working out opening day kinks.  Also, the food represents good value and is a real addition to Fillmore Street.\n\nOn entry I am asked whether I would like a table, or seating at the counter.  I opt for the counter and am seated facing a wall rather than at a seat where I might see the chef at work.  Given that the counter is empty, this seems a poor choice on the part of the host.  \n\nI start with an ample and well-priced caesar salad.   The romaine is fresh but the salad is overdressed.  While I am halfway through the salad fried calamari arrive.  Timing remains a bit off in the kitchen.  The calamari are not greasy, but bland and coated with too much breading.  \n\nCrab cakes arrive, minus a fork.  My waitress kindly permits me to swipe the utensil from a nearby setting.  The crab cakes are sided with a small salad in which not all of the cherry tomatoes are ripe.  The crab cakes themselves are nice but a bit greasy.  \n\nThe place is spare, utilitarian, with bric a brac here and there and the requisite swordfish on the wall.  Sort of reminiscent of the Anchor Oyster Bar in the Castro.  But rather than being populated by the somewhat eccentric Castro clientele, Woodhouse has a tamer group from Pacific Heights.  \n\nThe place is new and plainly still shaking out the bugs in both the food and service.  So no, to me it is not five star.  But Woodhouse does have potential.", "author": "David D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-28", "description": "Came here with fellow yelper, JolieCrush J., and a few other friends last weekend and did not leave disappointed.  The restaurant is really small, so if you have a group bigger than 4 people, be prepared to wait for a bit (ours was about an hour or so).  \n\nAt first glance, the menu was not that pricey for a seafood place.  The most expensive items on the menu were about $25 or $26 dollars for an entree, not too shabby.  \n\nTo start, we decided to share the stuffed artichoke entree, some calamari, and the chowder, which I wasn't entirely sure was for the entire table(due to the fact that they only have one unisex bathroom and the line can be quite long especially if there are females in front of you...oh, forgot to add the detail that they ordered the appetizers while i was in line), but in any case, the bowl was passed around and I was able to have a spoonful.  The chowder was nice and creamy and had real clams in it, and for the price, it was a pretty good portion.  The calamari was just ok.  Tasted pretty ordinary to me.  The stuffed artichoke was excellent.  One of them came stuffed with dungeness crab and the other one was stuffed with shrimp.  I personally liked the crab one better, but the shrimp was just as good.  The artichoke was grilled to perfection and it came with some homemade mayo, which was much better than that crap you buy in stores.  Little details like this make a huge difference in flavor.\n\nFor my entree, I decided on the whole roasted fish special.  Delicious.  By the time I was done eating it, it looked like the plates that those cartoon cats have with just the bones laying there.  On that particular night, they coated the fish in cornmeal, roasted it, and served it over a ragu made with tomatoes and squash.  The fish skin was nice and crisp, the meat was cooked just right, and like I stated earlier, I ate every last morsel on my plate.  Around the table, the other orders were mussels, poke, lobster rolls and fish and chips.  If you just took a soundtrack of our tables noises, it would sound like we hadn't eaten for days, even though the wait for our table was just one hour.  Nom nom nom's all around as everyone was enjoying their dish.\n\nThe service was really good and our waiter knew the items really well.  Since I ordered the special based on his description, I would have to say that he was pretty accurate in describing the menu items.  Random story, so since I was going to be using my hands to eat this, I was given a wet nap which was stolen by one of my fellow diners.  I asked our waiter for one and he ended up forgetting, so I reminded him, and instead of giving me the standard packaged one, I got this towel dipped in hot water with a lemon wedge on a plate instead.  Pretty damn cool!  Details restaurant folks, pay attention!  I should probably add that the reason I requested a wet nap instead of washing my hands in the rest room was because, yes, you guessed right, someone decided to spend about 15 minutes in the one person bathroom and I got tired of waiting.  \n\nOverall, a great restaurant and I will surely come back here again, with a smaller group of course.\n\nSide note, the ketchup comes in those fat bottles with wide mouths instead of the old school tall and skinny ones.  My friend decided that he would violently shake-weight-shake the bottle to get the ketchup out and was rewarded with 80% of the bottle on his plate.  Hahahaha.  Luckily, he requested a side plate to put his ketchup on.  Moral of the story: lay off the shake weights a few weeks before eating here.", "author": "JP T."}

It looked delicious, but tasted very bland, nothing memorable. Came here for dinner again last night with the bf. I had the 2 piece fish and chips and shared a bowl of the clam chowder. The clam chowder was sad. It was very runny and weak in flavor. The worst part of the meal were the fish and chips. Very heavy and tasteless. All the lime juice and malt vinegar couldn't cover up the lameness in this dish. My bf and I left there feeling sick and wishing we had that hour back. Yelp is usually good about recommending good eats, but in this case, this was a big fat FAIL. I'm checking this off my list and never coming here again. Also, the prices are ridiculously expensive for the quality of the food you get. The only positive is the place is very clean and the service was very friendly.

The stuffed artichoke (which used to be my fav) has come soggy, wet, and inconsistently grilled/cooked/sauced the last few times.  The lobster roll, while still delish, seems to be getting smaller and smaller every time.  The fish and chips are still pretty solid.  The cioppino was overly spicy and salty and the seafood was overcooked when I had it last (a few visits ago).  \n\nHowever, a couple nights ago I dined there with a girlfriend and while the artichoke was not the greatest, we got a black cod special, and it was cooked to perfection:  crisp skin, super tender white meat, all over some braised fennel bulbs, broccolini, purple potatoes, and sprinkled on top with delicious deep fried bits of fennel.  That dish was a true winner.  It's hard not to like this place (Chad one of the hosts is super nice, and Shelley one of the waitresses is just a pleasure), and it's easy to see why people (including me) keep coming back.  \n\nDrinks:  Arnold Palmers and Lemonades are pricey, but come with little carafes of simple syrup and carbonated water (tea if it's an AP), making it a fun delight to mix it yourself.  \n\nPlus, I'm down for supporting all the neighborhood restaurants on this side of Pine.", "author": "Isabel M."}

The price, at $16.75, is pretty standard, but I didn't pay for the meal and even if I did, it's worth it for the sheer amount of lobster packed in there.\n\nThe decor really is reminiscent of what I would think is a typical New England coastal scene.  It's airy, there's lots of wood and rope, but it's a little more up-scale than one would think.  The floors are swabbed clean as though a sailor himself did it.  Very pleasant all around.\n\nJust one tip: there's the inevitable wait, but just go in, put your name down, and travel a hop, skip and a jump to Harry's down the street for cocktails.  Woodhouse will call you when your table's ready.\n\nNext time I'll be coming for $1 oysters on Tuesdays, and to try their \"do-it-yourself\" lemonade, Hartford clam chowder, and sourdough bread pudding.

We ended waiting about 20 minutes, so it wasn't too bad. I recommend ordering family style so you can try a little of everything. We got raw oysters, crab cakes, clam chowder, and fish tacos. The service was a little on the slower side, but it was a popular night (I guess in SF it's always a popular night, especially in the Castro) so I suppose that can't be helped. Everything was really fresh and flavorful. The crab cakes were my favorite, all dense and crispity, but the clam chowder and fish tacos were equally delicious as well. GO HERE if you're craving good, fresh seafood at a (relatively) reasonable price and can't be bothered to make it to Fisherman's Wharf or North Beach.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Been here twice for dinner and loved both times.  \n\nFirst time, hubby and I came at 5pm on a Saturday so it was pretty empty, which worked out for us because we were hungry. We ordered half a dozen oysters to share.  Hubby got a cup of the clam chowder.  Then we shared a lobster roll (smaller size) and crab cakes.  Everything was delicious, especially the lobster roll.  You can get it in the smaller size, with 3 oz of lobster meat or the larger size, with doubled the meat.  It comes with this buttered brioche bread that was lightly toasted and oh so soft.  The oysters were also super fresh.  We opted for the kumamoto oysters and they were plump and juicy.  The chowder was also creamy and tasty with many pieces of clam.  The crab cakes were so so, nothing too special, so I probably wouldn't order them again. \n\nThe second time we went, it was with a larger group at 7ish on a Thursday night.  They don't take reservations but I called ahead and put my name on the waitlist. When we got there at 7, we were the first on the list but ended up waiting 30 minutes for a table to clear up.  This time around, hubby and I shared the 3 oz lobster roll again and also tried the dungeness crab roll.  We also got a dozen oysters to share with our friends.  As usual the food was yummy and everyone had a good time.  We even ordered 2 desserts to share: the bread pudding and chocolate custard.  Both were YUMMY, especially the bread pudding.  Even though it was made with sour dough bread, it didn't taste like sour dough at all.  It came with this rum caramel sauce drizzled on top and around the bread, topped with a generous helping of whip cream.  We all thought it was pretty amazing.  I'll be back again for their $1 oyster Tuesdays!", "author": "Kat M."}

You can eat here without having the hassle of finding parking, thanks to a convenient nearby parking lot ($4 for 2hr max). \n\nWe came here on a Saturday around 6:45 pm and it wasn't very crowded at the time. We waited for about 5 minutes before being seated. My girlfriend ordered the Sturgeon with Ravioli which came out great. It was cooked so perfectly, tender and juicy. I ordered their Crab Cakes that came with a side salad. The crab cakes are to die for. The only downside, the portions of our dishes were quite petite. My girlfriend and I weren't full so we decided to go with what seems to be their most popular dessert. We ordered the Sourdough Bread Pudding and it was phenomenal! Two cubed pieces of sourdough that was topped off with caramel and whipped cream. It was a little sweet but totally manageable. I thought about it and you know sometimes you want to try dessert but you're just too full? After we finished the dessert, we were comfortably full. I guess the smaller main dishes weren't such a bad thing after all.\n\nTowards the end of dinner we noticed that there was a crowd of people waiting around the front and place was really packed. It seemed all the customers were locals because waiters and waitresses were calling some customers by their first names when asking what they wanted to order. It was pretty cool. On the way out we were told \"Thank You\" by at least three employees. Everyone's just so friendly!\n\nIn conclusion, if you want an atmosphere with good vibes, excellent service and superb food for an affordable price. Look no more.

It's not overpriced like the Farrallon or dirty and bird infested like the stalls at Fisherman's Wharf. It's the real deal. Woodhouse has two locations, one Castro/Market and the other conveniently located by my house on Fillmore and Bush. The restaurant clearly was designed by someone who has been to an actual New England town like Newport, RI. Its quaint, white walls with pops of color (very Pottery Barn) with a nautical theme. The only thing about the ambiance that throws me off is the large 'electronic picture' hanging by the special board that displays a bunch of random nautical-type pics. It really doesn't jive with the overall New England theme. They don't take reservations and the restaurant is small but the tables turn over quickly. There is a nice long bar with 10 seats if you don't want to wait for a table. Come early, around 6pm for minimal to no wait.\n\nI ventured to the Pacific Heights location with my friend Kerstin last night. It's a great place to have a meal with a vegetarian (pescatarian) friend because they can order anything off the menu and you don't have to feel bad about the limited non-meat selections. Since neither of us could decide on what to get, we split the Ciopinno and the Dungeness Crab Special, a whole crab grilled with cracked pepper and sea salt with jalapenos and green onions. OMG delicious. We both couldn't decide which was better but after much deliberation and eating, I liked the crab special the best. Some other highlights on the menu are: Crab Cakes, Stuffed Artichokes with Dungeness crab and bay shrimp, clam chowder, fish and chips and the $1 oysters on Tuesdays. Everything I have tried is great, so I am sure the other half of the menu is just as delicious. This is the best spot for seafood in the city and the beer/wine is reasonably priced. \n\nIt's Crab Season in San Francisco so go now why the little guys are fresh!!!", "author": "Alice S."}

Popped in yesterday for an early dinner around 5pm and we were lucky enough to snag a corner table by the window. Ordered a cup of New England clam chowder and the lobster roll. The chowder had an impressive amount of clams in it, but could have been thicker and needed a hearty dose of salt and pepper. The lobster roll arrived on buttered Acme bread with a side of perfectly crisp fries and coleslaw. Really tasty, but the portion size was disappointingly small for the price - I felt like I was eating a kid's meal. The lobster roll is priced at 3oz of meat for $18 and 6oz for $26. I could have easily polished off another serving. 1 cup of soup, 2 orders of the 3oz lobster roll, and 2 iced teas with refills for a total bill of just over $51 - not including tip. Overall, service was excellent and food was delicious, but pricey for the portions - also, we were still hungry afterwards and ended up buying some yogurt at Fraiche next door and some sandwiches at La Boulange across the street.", "author": "Elaine W."}

Fish and chips are the best bang for your buck 3 large strips of perfectly fried cod on a bed of crunchy fries. Kick that back with a beer and you'll be greased up well for about $15. $1 oysters on Tuesdays is more of a headliner given the oysters are the size of clams.

We decided to look for someplace that had lobster rolls on the menu and came up with this one.  Seemed like a good idea.  Honestly, I can say once was enough.  It was OK, but I know of better places were I can have a better culinary experience.  Waitress very knowledgeable. Must have had 4 different interesting specials. Looked great but wanted to stick with the standard menu.  For appetizers we ordered the New England clam chowder and crab cakes (it's an entree but you can get it as an appetizer).  The chowder was very potato cheese almost a fatty taste to it.  I didn't taste clam and very few actual clams in it.  The crab cakes on the other hand had a little more flavor, even though also a little starchy and dry.  For the main course we ordered the lobster roll and fish & chips. The lobster roll was just OK.  I honestly have had much better.  If I was in the Fillmore and REALLY wanted a lobster roll then I would probably show up there but, again, I would go to other venues.  The fish and chips were good.  The fish batter was like funnel cake batter which was very good.  I would say that was the best dish honestly. We attempted to stay with staples since that is pretty easy way to gauge the restaurant.  That being said I have to hope some of the other dishes were better as other people seemed to be very pleased with their meals.  I might try it again and go for something different but my experience wasn't good enough to warrant a second visit any time soon.    .", "author": "Sarah O."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-10", "description": "So another day, and another foodie adventure. My friend said she felt like oysters so we start heading over to Woodhouse since I've been dying to try another Lobster Roll after the orgasmic experience of it at Sam's Chowder House. Not wanting to constantly drive all the way down to Halfmoon Bay from SF, and hearing good things about the Lobster Roll here, and the fact that it's a stone's throw away in SF, this was a must try for me.\n\nIt's located on Fillmore, maybe a few blocks from Geary, and it's on those blocks where it's packed with different kinds of stores and businesses so it can be easy to miss. If you're going during a time where the meters are enforced tho... ughh what a hassle. One hour max and quarters only give you a few minutes. I had to go out 3 times during our meal just to keep feeding the meter! Decor was nice with nifty pictures and decorations on the walls. The place itself is not that big though and you might feel crowded when sitting at the tables if the place is packed.\n\nLucky for us we went during a weekday, maybe around 2-ish and the place was almost empty. Which is good because we overheard them telling someone that they don't take reservations. Server mentions their off-menu specials and what's this? $1 oysters? Seems we lucked out coming on Tuesday which is when they have that special. We also ordered a bowl of chowder, calamari, onion rings and of course my Lobster Roll.\n\nIt would have been nice if they gave us some kind of bread or something to munch on while we wait. Wouldn't be much of a deal except it took a while to get our oysters which came out first, and I know Sam's Chowder House was always on top of it with the pre-meal bread the couple times I went there. Keep in mind there was only one other couple in the restaurant at the time. Oysters were ok, but damn were they small. Guess I can't complain since they're the $1 dollar variety, but still... \n\nFinally after another meter feeding, I come back to see everything on the table which was good since I was starving at that point. Alright, the Lobster roll. They actually have 2 prices on there... 18/26. I asked the server what the difference was? At 26 bucks... that better be ONE MINDBLOWINGLY DAMN GOOD SANDWICH. Like seriously, that's a steak dinner right there, a whole crab, etc. Not to mention the Lobster roll from Sam's is just 20 bucks. He explains to me that it's simply a matter of size. I go for the lesser variety and upon seeing it, I'm admittedly slightly disappointed. It's smaller than the one at Sam's and definitely less Lobster meat. They also have more celery chunks in there which almost make the sandwich have a more salad-y feel. Still good, but not OH-MY-GOD-THIS-LOBSTER-ROLL-IS-MAKING-LOVE-TO-MY-MOUTH kind of good at Sam's, whose sandwich was basically stuffed with big generous chunks of Lobster. The bread was of a different variety. Some sort of toasted buttered bread which almost reminded me of a cheese sandwich melt kind of bread. Sam's is more of a traditional roll. It did however, come with french fries which I prefer over the lays-variety potato chips that Sam's included with their roll both times I went. Fries were good... and if I didn't know better I could have sworn they were McDonald's fries... except slightly crispier. Not a bad thing, since I do love me some McDonald fries.\n\nOnto the side dishes, the onion rings were very good. Some of the best I've had, big, crunchy and the onion doesn't pull out in its entirety leaving an empty breaded husk like other onion rings I've had. You get a basket of them... but even though I liked them... have to question the value of a small basket of $6 onion rings. We had also ordered the fried Calamari, which I have mixed feelings about. I'm of the belief that you'd have to fail pretty hard to do Fried Calamari wrong, but it takes a bit of... something to do it extraordinarily well. Unfortunately in this case, it wasn't the latter. It was only ok. The pieces were a bit on the small size, and so much so that some pieces I wasn't even sure if there was a piece of calamari lost in the breading... The fried breading itself was crumbly too, and felt too soft. It was literally falling apart at times. \n\nMy friend had ordered the chowder and while she liked it, I was annoyed that it was served almost in a plate. We had ordered a bowl of chowder and while I wasn't expecting a bread bowl or a giant cereal bowl... well you know what I mean. \n\n\nWe also ordered some sort of bread pudding for dessert and it was pretty good, a bit similar to french toast. Again good, but not great. And that pretty sums the experience here for us. Not as good as Sam's Chowder House which I was hoping it'd be as good as, and value-wise not quite there, but it is in the city...", "author": "Peter W."}

I just like a bit of each kind on my spoon. No mixing. Followed up by the fish and chips. I really love their fries. And the batter on the fish is flakily crisp, never soggy. I also really like their crab melt. Yum!\n\nThat being said, I've had a couple negative experiences here. They won't stop me from coming here, but they're perhaps worth mentioning. I'd advise against going when they first open for the day. I went before around that time and the chowder was cold. Not lukewarm, but cold. Everyone was sending their chowder back. They were very apologetic - their service is always excellent, but the chowder should never have been served in the first place. I think it's because they were still getting setting up and getting situated. Most other restaurants start prepping before they open, but I'm thinking that perhaps they don't. And one time, the size of the fish in my fish and chips was half of what they normally would've been. They looked like fish sticks. =( Perhaps they were running low on fish? In any case, I was wishing that I had chosen to order something else that day.\n\nI like the concept of the do-it-yourself lemonade, but for me to really mix it the way I want, I'd need either a bigger glass or less ice and more of the sugar water vs. regular water.

The place was still full at 9:40pm (closes at 10pm) when i walked in.  A couple that was waiting at the door just got seated despite the time... so i guess business is good.  The host was very nice and courteous.  The 15mins wait time for pick up was pretty spot on.  It was thoughtful of them to leave one edge of the takeout box open to let the french fries breath.  The aroma was irresistible!  Finally I sat down and bit into the lobster roll.  Delicious!  The meat was fresh and the lumps of leg meat were all in tact and really juicy.  I drizzled a little bit of Sriracha sauce on it which gave it a little more heat and dimension.  The bread was also nicely toasted with a slightly chewy texture which was perfect for the lobster salad in it because it held the moisture very well. It only took me 2 minutes to finish it....", "author": "Adele W."}

I stopped by the Fillmore Street location this weekend and I'm glad I did. \n\nWhen I first walked in it reminded me of several little places in New England I had been to before. Intimate restaurants with a few tables and counter seating. The only thing missing was a view of the water, which you can see \"virtually\" on a plasma screen on the wall. A nice touch. \n\nAs for the food, I had the Steamed Crab and my friend had the Lobster Roll. The crab was cooked perfectly and I was surprised by the large portion, especially for the price. I tried the lobster roll which was also quite a meal. The plentiful lobster was falling out of the roll and seasoned perfectly. And I agree with the last review, the fries are great!

My friends and I tried to get as much as we could here, we pretty much wanted to try everything!  And everything we got was AWESOME!\nWe got the oysters and fried calamari to start.  The oysters were fresh and really good.  I would love to go on a Tuesday when they have $1 oysters, it's normally $2 an oyster.  So worth it.\nThe calamari was good too, perfectly fried and yummy.  We then got the baja fish tacos, lobster roll, crabcakes, and my personal choice, half dungeness crab. \nThe fish tacos were amazing, so crispy and amazing.  Totally made us want to try the fish and chips, which will be a must on our next visit.\nThe lobster roll was good, kinda like tuna salad but lobster salad with no a lot of mayo which was good.  It was nice and refreshing tasting. Loads of lobster which is always a plus.\nThe crabcakes were good, I'm not a huge fan of crabcakes but these were good.  I liked the salad that came with it too, but I love any salad that comes with vinaigrette dressing.\nLastly was the half dungeness crab, first off I love the fact that you can get a half instead of a whole.  It's cheaper and it feeds one perfectly!  I'm a huge dungeness crab lover and I will pretty much want it if they have it on the menu yet not everyone does, so being able to get a half order just enough for myself is heaven.  I got it with the white wine, butter, and lemon, oh man so good.  Buttery, but not too buttery.  Smelled so good and tasted so good.  I was so eager at eating it, it flew out of my hands a couple of times.  I apologize to my friend next to me who got some of the butter sauce on her pants.  \nI also got an iced tea which was very refreshing and they also have a do-it-yourself arnold palmer.  My friend got it and it was really good.  I liked the concept.  \n\nOverall, LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and will definitely be going back each time I visit SF.

I was expecting the food to be fabulous.  It was pretty good, but not fabulous.  The calamari was breaded nicely, but the calamari itself was quite chewy..... the two sauces it came with (cocktail and some creamy aoli) were perfectly tasty.  I got the lobster roll with fries.  The fries were perfect...crisp and thin.... the lobster roll was very good... ton of lobster meat, perfectly toasted bun/bread... but I feel like it could have used a little more flavor.  Maybe a tad more butter or some salt or some kind of seasoning.  I'm not that sophisticated when it comes to seafood, I  don't know what makes a real good lobster roll, and it could be that that was the perfect one with just a few simple ingredients that really lets the lobster shine, so I feel like that's how it was meant to come out.

I give two thumbs up to their variety of seating choices: at the bar if you're on a quick lunch break, at a table for two on a romantic date, high up on bar-like stools & tables for a group of friends or against the comfy looking bench if you are dining solo.\n\nService- polite, but a little slow bringing out our dishes, despite there not being a huge lunch rush.\n\nPrices- a little high, even for a seafood spot & definitely for a lunch spot. $49 (without tip) felt way too steep.\n\nFood- maybe it was what we ordered, but the BFF & I were less than thrilled. We shared the artichoke with bay shrimp & lobster, which was awesomely fresh & plentiful (This was the dish we liked best.)\n- The BFF had half a dungeness crab & observed that you get very little meat for the price you pay & that the buttery sauce is not at all buttery, but in fact, watery. \n- I had the petrale sole. The fish itself was fine, but it seemed there was all that \"brown butter\" for nothing; i couldn't taste a buttery-ness. If I'm going to eat that many calories, I want to at least KNOW it. The spinach was ok but the mashed potatoes really ruined my dish- it was whipped smooth, leaving ZERO texture to the dish & was smeared everywhere. Every bite of sole or spinach had mashed potatoes (which had no flavor & a texture I disliked) running through it. I think a suggestion for them would be to put it on the side instead of underneath the fish.\n\nI am going to come in once more to try their lobster roll because the table behind us had it & it looked delicious.

Convenience--Open from 11:30 on allowing me to have a late lunch or early dinner if I want. \n2. Amazing food--My first meal was a half crab. I ordered a potato gratin as a side, but the crab was plenty on its own.  It was succulent, flavorful and fun to eat.  I had never cracked a crab on my own before but it was easy.  The next time I brought my husband.  he had the crab, which was plenty for him too.  I had a fish special of the night, a well prepared tasty sea bass. On my third visit I had the lobster roll. Oh my! I've tried lobster many times and it never did anything for me.  I'm a crab person, I guess.  But this roll was amazing! Huge whole pieces of lobster in a lemon aioli, not too much sauce, just the right amount to make it moist and well-flavored. M husband had the fried clams appetizer as his entree.  There were plenty and he loved them. Everything was well-prepared, fresh with attention to detail.\n3 Service.  The service was wonderful and efficient, no matter how busy they were.  I went in alone and was treated as well as if my husband as with me. We do not order booze and we were still treated with care.  This is unusual in the city.\nI highly recommend Woohouse Fish Company.  Try it!", "author": "renee j."}

They have two sizes, a small for 18 and a large for 26, but the only difference is that the larger one has more lobster in it.  It was delicious.  The lobster roll consisted of a buttery toasted bread bursting w/ tons of lobster.

Super excited about having a casual seafood restaurant open in our neighborhood, we came in with an hour and 45 minutes to spare before a movie we already had tickets to at the Kabuki. We figured that was more than enough time to grab a quick dinner. Tables were turning when we got there so we didn't have much of a wait. Unfortunately, after ordering our food, we ended up waiting and waiting, all the while, witnessing the tables that were seated way after us getting their food before ours. I eventually had to tell our server that we had a movie to get to. When our entrees were finally brought out, B's halibut was mixed up with our next-door-diners' petrale sole (this couple had been seated, oh, about an hour and 15 minutes after us).  The chef came out to apologize for the mix-up to the diners next to us, but left us with nothing but 15 minutes to suck down our entrees before we ran off to the theatre. That lack of apology, dear readers, was the most disappointing part of the whole experience.\n\nThat being said, we are still excited to have this restaurant in our 'hood because I like the atmosphere, the food was delicious, and the service, in general, was good. I would chalk this up to breaking my rule of never dining at a new restaurant until they've been opened for at least 6 months, but no one else seemed to have any problems with service. And I *liked* our server. I just wish he followed up more, like checking to see if we wanted another beer, or explain why our food was taking forever, or even telling the chef that we'd been inconvenienced by the entree mix-up as well. Honestly, if we didn't have somewhere to be, we would probably have taken this in stride, but this experience was too damn annoying to not share. Hopefully our next visit will be a better one.", "author": "Lisa C."}

Appetizer portions are huge and very well made. The mussels and fries were perfectly opened and had plenty of liquid underneath to be soaked up with bread(this stuff is the ambrosia of the gods people!)\n\nThe only thing that knocked off that last star was they ran out of  clam chowder.

My friends and I arrived around 8:30 and were seated w/in 15 minutes (which was w/in the estimated 30 minute wait time that the host projected) and I have nothing but praise for the service, location and food.  \n\nLocated in the Fillmore St. shopping district, there is a casual, yet stylish crowd wondering around.  The location doesn't take reservations (first come, first serve) and parking is a bit difficult to find, but it is definitely worth the effort.  There is a very small waiting area, so if you come during a BUSY time, be prepared to wait OUTDOORS.  \n\nThe menu is broken up into Salads/Soups/Apps and main courses.  I chose to have ALL appetizers tonight.  I started off with a cup of the New England style clam chowder, which was solid.  The clam pieces are visible, the cream not too heavy for the stomach. The cup is a small cup, but it is a nice way to start a meal.  The 1/2 dozen oysters can be mixed and matched.  Tonight they carried 3 varieties and I had them do a 2X2X2 combo for me.  They were fresh and tasty.  Not the best oysters that I had, but decent for the price point.  For my main course, I just had the FRIED calimari, which was DELICIOUS.  The cocktail sauce provided was tart and tangy and the aioli sauce had a hint of smokiness that paired well with the crispy calimari rings.  The STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE dessert was absolutely amazing.  Fresh strawberry with syrup, handmade whipped cream and a warm shortcake biscuit was literally \"to die for\".  LOVED IT.  Plus, the LEMONADE was like a science experiment for me.  They brought out a glass with ice, fresh squeezed lemon juice and soda water and sugar SYRUP to mix to my particular taste.  SO MUCH FUN.\n\nMy total came out to be approximately $35.00 (incl. tax sans tip).  I can't wait to go there again.  Next time, I want the FISH AND CHIPS.

We weren't craving oysters. What we wanted was their crab sandwich and lobster roll! And you bet your @$$ that's what we got. Both of the sandwiches comes in a small or large size. It's the same sized bun and everything but just double the meat. We ordered large for both. He is a big lobster fan so of course ordering the lobster roll was his choice and I, being the crab lover, chose the crab sandwich. We ordered both to be split in half to share. Funny though, when we were finished, my brother told me that he preferred the crab sandwich and I actually preferred the lobster roll instead. They both come with french fries and plenty of it. The sandwiches get pretty pricey but it was worth every penny. I believe it was $17 for the small and $26 for the large. Definitely worth going for the large.

Considering my strong opposition to all things sourdough related, I was more than a little skeptical about this dessert, but I figured that I had to eat at least one sourdough thing while in San Francisco. I generally like bread pudding, so this seemed like a good compromise. Though it's thought to be a fairly easy dessert to make, bread pudding can also go very wrong. Too chewy, too gooey, too bland...I've tried (and made) quite a few less than satisfactory ones. This bread pudding surpassed all of my expectations. Everything about it was amazing...not too sweet, very flavorful (probably due to some combination of sugar and sourdough) perfectly moist and surrounded by a delicious housemade caramel sauce. I'm looking at tickets to San Francisco as I write this. Before dessert we did actually have dinner...crab cakes, fish tacos and scallops. All were excellent, if a bit smaller than what we were expecting for the price. Obviously very fresh and well prepared. My crab cakes had big chunks of crab throughout as opposed to being fishy-flavored breadcrumb balls that some places try to pass off as crab cakes. Scallops were also delicious, but two medium sized scallops hardly a dinner make. The wait at this busy spot was long...but I would wait around all day just have to have some more of that bread pudding.", "author": "Martha M."}

I haven't been here in a year or so, i really liked it in prior visits, but went last night and the food seems to be off.  I ordered the crab melt and was shocked at how tiny it is now, when they first opened this was an entire sandwich now it's half a sandwich.  Ok, so i figured they would make up for it with the amount of fries....they use to give a huge portion of fries, well...NOT anymore. Was really surprised about the small amount on my plate. And the melt just didn't taste that great.  Once this was a satisfying meal, now i was left hungry.  Good thing my friend ordered the fish tacos...well, after having one of the tacos, i was really disappointed. Only tasted oil and no other flavors.  Definitely would not order the fish tacos again.  The staff was great, but don't think i'll be back any time soon for the food.", "author": "Dilly M."}

But, yesterday, my first gigantic dissapointment, which has to do with more management/admin matters.  \n\nAfter a tough gym workout, I was looking forward to getting a lobster roll to go.  It was 9pm and I called to place an order, as they are speed dialed into my cell phone.   (I had planned my daytime eating around this decadent lobster roll and even timed my gym workout to make it to Woodhouse before their 10pm closing, so that they wouldn't be out of lobster.  Plus I worked out extra hard to pre-burn off those Woodhouse fries). BUT the phone just kept ringing and ringing.  I thought, maybe they are busy with takeout orders.  Then I got to the place (still on my cell phone, ringing Woodhouse) and discover that the place is CLOSED!!!  It was 9PM!! They are supposed to be open, 7 days a week!  The phone message didn't indicate that they were closed.  I suddenly understood what  was going through Chevy Chase's mind when he got to Wollyworld, found out it was closed and punched the moose.

We also had some of the fresh off the cob corn, which was good. Between the four of us we ordered:\n1) The lobster roll- which was very good.\n2) Halibut en papilote which was perfectly seasoned, and cooked very well.  The sauce (from the fish, veggies, butter, and wine) was excellent.\n3) Sole, which was very good, not sure about the setup (with mashed potato) but it was still very good.\n4) I had the excellent  cioppino- spicy, and packed full of various different seafood.  The broth was well flavoured and delicious.  Well worth it.\n\nWe had a bottle of J Pinot Gris, and a couple extra glasses by the glass.  All in all was around $150 for all four.  Well worth it, and completely delicious.

I ordered the lobster roll and it was every bit as good as I expected.  My roll was absolutely stuffed with chunky lobster goodness.  For comparison, I've enjoyed lobsters rolls at various restaurants from Maine to Boston.  I think WFC's version can stand up to any that I've tried there and even surpass some.  I'm also a big fan of the lobster rolls at Sam's Chowder House which seemed a bit more buttery.  WFC's is slightly different, perhaps slightly sweeter, but it's every bit as good.  Service was excellent and the waitress even took the time to chat with me a bit about the restaurant and other items on the menu.

Just Tuesday, these Peninsula natives opened their doors for lunch, and what a welcome addition they are to the neighborhood.  Located on Fillmore Street near Pine, this seafood haven is more spacious and offers a more evolved menu than its sibling.  It's a bright, comfortable, simple yet well-decorated spot executed with the help of Jamis MacNiven, their dad.  Jamis owns Buck's in Woodside and has built restaurants like the Hard Rock Cafe which used to be on VanNess Street.  When you go in, check out the big fish overhead and the framed flat screen featuring a boating and fishing video.  Rowan and Dylan, whose middle name is Woodhouse, were friendly hosts who were rolling up their sleeves alongside their employees, greeting, seating, serving customers and answering phones.  Gotta love that.                      \n                                        \nChef Jon Hearnsberger, formerly of Anchor Oyster Bar, turns out some seriously satisfying grub.  My parents and I had a great meal there yesterday.  The cup of clam chowder was very flavorful, creamy, and filled with clams.  It wasn't as piping hot as it could have been, but the recipe is a winner.  The crab cakes were pleasingly light and crispy on the outside,  filled with crab and had a nice crunch from chopped celery and green onion.  Two crab cakes come with salad greens, tomatoes and beets in a light vinaigrette.  The crispy calamari was equally impressive.  Again, it had a perfectly light and crisp coating that wasn't greasy or heavy, and the squid was incredibly tender.  The Ipswich clam roll and lobster roll were both piled high on a hearty toasted bun and came with thin-cut fries and slaw.  Hearnsberger uses local and sustainable ingredients wherever possible so you can feel good about indulging.\n                           \nLook at their chalkboard for daily fish specials. Yesterday, they featured health-conscious dishes such as halibut prepared in parchment light on the oil, as well as grilled salmon with asparagus. They don't have their wine and beer license just yet, but for now, you can order a make-your-own lemonade to wash down all that tasty goodness.\n\nI can't wait to go back with my husband and kids and try everything else on their menu!  They will be open for dinner service soon, once they get that liquor license.  And they're not taking reservations right now, so feel free to walk right in.   For now, their lot of two-tops and four-tops and 10 stools at the bar are enough, but once word gets out that they're open for business, I can imagine lines out the door.", "author": "Dina B."}

Two of us decided to have dinner there and  walked in for a table. The gentleman at the door asked our name, by the time we gave it we sat he walked over and asked again as he did not seem to pay attention the first time. This by itself is no real big deal, and I do not fault this to be honest but it does set a tone of carelessness. Lets skip to food. I ordered clam chowder and fish and chips, and my date ordered a wedge salad with \"may-tag blue\" and a side of garlic sauteed veggies. My soup landed first and was cold. I told the waitress and she immediately took it back. I assumed that it would come back out quickly but for whatever reason it came out 10 min later just as the food came out as well. At first appearance it all looked good. I began to eat the fish and chips and within about 4 bites realized that the fish and the chips should have been called \"Grease, a little fish and some oily fries\" it was terrible.I eventually got ill form the oil and did not eat most of the food. I asked how my dates food was and she shrugged. I tasted the so-called may-tag blue cheese wedge salad, and there was a salad with a creamy dressing but nothing at all that tastes like may-tag blue cheese. In fact it tasted entirely like parmesan. I can not be 100% sure if it was or not but I have eaten my fair share of blue cheese and salads of this type and none but this tasted like parmesan.  So at this point it was just bizarre. I asked how the veggies were and she indicated they were NOT SAUTEED in garlic at all in fact they were boiled, tasted frozen and had no salt and no garlic clove was ever anywhere near these veggies. We called the waitress and told her and she agreed that she can tell it just seemed boiled and that they had not sauteed it ! well at this point i pointed out the fish and oil chips, she mentioned the salad did not taste that good, and to our shock the waitress said \"I mean, the fish and chips are like the best thing here\" I really don't give a @#$ what is \" the best\" it was all very bad, including the service and the attitude. She went back and showed the man who forgot our name, who shrugged in a \"who cares\" kind of way, and came back and gave us the bill and said that she removed the $5 veggies. WELL,  I have some advise for the woodhouse fish company. In the future, I would advise you to care about every customer. If  a customer has a bad meal, come over, apologize, and invite the customer to come back for a entree on you. This will not only save your customer and maybe change they're opinion, either by your gracious attitude , or the better food next time, but mainly it will keep you in business, by keeping a customer from telling  10+ people not to eat there. Well nobody ever said anything about taste, or business sense.. oh well..\n\nUPDATE: CAN YOU BELIEVE NOBODY HAS EVER BOTHERED TO REACH OUT FROM THIS PLACE.. JUST REINFORCES HOW BAD IT IS...", "author": "oliver g."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-10", "description": "Ok I like most things about Woodhouse. The food is East Coast seafood which is tasty and reminds me of Cape Cod. Servings are not large but the quality is good. Four of us sat at the bar on Saturday night at about 9pm. The service was good and the food was as expected. I had the lobster roll and a cup of clam chowder. Both were solid 4.5's. The fries that came with the roll were good and crispy too. So now to the real reason for this review... the beer selection. Three of us there were beer drinkers and I wouldn't even say we are picky beer drinkers. There was nothing we wanted. We would have each drank 3 beers with dinner but instead I had 2, one guy had 1 and didn't finish the 2nd and the 3 guy only had one and didn't like it. So you know, these are the beer choices: On Draft, Scrimshaw, Anchor Steam and Ranger IPA. In a bottle, Amstel Light, Great White. In a can... Trout Slayer. Okay, so there are two of the six that anyone has heard of... Anchor and Amstel. I understand if you want to try to be hipster and have a can of beer on the menu and ever a \"nautical themed\" draft beer like Scrimshaw. It goes with the fishouse. So, I pay attention to beers and beer prices when I go out. One of my questions to bartenders is \"what beer do you sell the most?\" and \"which do you sell the least?\". Amstel is almost always the least sold. Anchor is not much better and is many times the least sold draft beer. So, not only do they have too many \"no name\" beers but they picked two of the least popular \"normal beers\". Seriously, they would make a lot more money. Some customers want to try something different but a lot of us like to have the same drink or at least something we know we like. Just add a bud/coors/miller light and a stella/heiniken to the list and you are all set. It really isn't that hard and trust me I am representing the silent majority here.

I didn't want to get my hopes up, but browsed the menu MANY times before going. Not knowing whether I'd be back, my friend and I decided to try a little of everything. We started off with the half dozen oysters. They were fresh, but a couple had some sand in it. We shared a lobster roll and boy was that a big mistake. The golden toasted split top roll with the buttery lobster was fabulous. We wished we each got our own. My friend got the grilled fish of the day, a well seasoned fish with generous portions of vegetables. I ordered the stuffed grilled artichoke. The artichoke was grilled and seasoned, then stuffed with shrimp and crab. It sat on a bed of salad accompanied with two pieces of cheese bread. Wow, was that a big plate of food!

At $26 a roll, I expected some tail! This made a significant different to the texture and bite of the roll and so I suggest not having the lobster roll here if you're looking for a real one. \n\nFries and Onion rings are freshly hot and crispy.

First off, the restaurant is designed right and love the overall look of the furniture and the model of a fishing boat. Not the deadliest catch but kind of like The Eye of the Storm boat. The condiments of malt vinegar, tabasco and ketchup in a shiny tin is a pretty nice touch. The food matched the surroundings pretty well. The fish and chips are just great. How'd they get that batter nice and crunchy with the right golden color? That's execution right there! The chips were extra crunchy and we even took it home and popped them in the oven for a late night snack and they came out even better. I had the fish tacos and loved the salsa relish with the lime squeezed over to give it that right flavor. The calamari was damn irresistible and the Seafood Ciappino was pretty good. Two things wrong though, one, it was a little salty and secondly the bread they served it with wasn't enough. Lastly, the lemonade was pretty inventive. Lemon juice, club soda and simple syrup you're at the captains wheel for mixing this concoction to your preference. Nice... just get here early for dinner or the wait can get to be unbearable.

Me and his dad had the ciopino and it was excellent .. i was pissed because i couldnt finish the dish because i was too full.  we would definitely go back here!!!  It's affordable too .. thought the quality was byfar more than that we paid for!!", "author": "Joy G."}

Our appetizer (steamed mussels) was very good with a light sauce, but the entrees were too greasy and too much sauce for a delicate fish. I won't go back here since there are other better options in the city.", "author": "Ichiban S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-27", "description": "Decent prices and portions. Had the crab cakes, which were pretty good, and my friend had the special (roasted halibut with risotto). Very flavorful and moist, without being underdone or chewy. It's crowded and noisy, and the service isn't very attentive (our waiter took our order and then we never saw him again - not even to get our check). Overall, not bad.", "author": "Lemon S."}

We were blown away by the delicious, fresh, and perfectly prepared food.  I had the pasta with crab and my husband had the whole roasted fish (dorado, also known as sea bream, I think).  My pasta was made that day and was perfectly al dente.  There was plenty of crab meat in large yummy chunks and the sauce was very light and not overpowering.  Basically, a bowl of yummy, perfectly cooked seafood pasta.  My husband's whole roasted fish was equally delicious.  It was flacky with a subtle vinegrette-like sauce and delicious veggies all around (the grilled fennel was incredible).  The waiter was very helpful with suggestions on how to tackle eating/deboning the whole fish.  We had a yummy spanish white wine to go with the meal and finished off with an amazing chocolate mousse with caramel whipped cream.  Be prepared to wait a bit for a table if you don't have a reservation, but it's well worth the wait for some amazing fresh seafood at pretty reasonable prices.  Definitely a new favorite.", "author": "squirrel l."}
