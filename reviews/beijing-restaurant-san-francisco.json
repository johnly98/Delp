Very dry and bread-y.\nTheir tofu dishes are pretty legit, the rice is okay, and their more traditional Beijing dishes seem to capture the crowd that comes for them, anyhow. If you're up for an adventure, try something traditional. \n\nThey do serve your typical American Chinese food, for sure. That seems pretty standard from what I could see. The flavors aren't bland but there are some things that are hit-or-miss. Some things they make better than others and in some dishes--better just not make it at all.\n\nVegetables are fine and flavorful. I had the pea sprouts with garlic. I've had all the dumplings on the menu, nothing to rave about, honestly. Definitely not their speciality, here. You can tell, no offense to my Chinese Grandma working day-in-and-day-out back in the kitchen. \n\nThe soup is pretty whatever. Not bland, flavorful, and will hit-the-spot if you need a hangover pick-me-up or feel like being all warm and cozy in the inside. Except, they use the same broth basically for all the soup and there is fake crab meat and fish balls of some kind. If you're not into that, don't order the soup. You'll be maybe upset if you're all about getting the real thing all the time.\n\nNot the number #1 best Chinese but definitely more flavorful than others I've been to have to offer in the area. If you haven't tried Shanghai Dumpling King nearby, try it. It's killer-deliciously-fantastic. They specialize obviously, with dumplings. They were closed today, so I came to Beijing. Beijing will do the trick if you're feeling like a lazy bag of beans on your way home from bart or the freeway. They've got parking if you need it. \n\nJust don't order the dumplings. Please, don't.", "author": "T. C."}

I was happy to see Chinese food in SF street food festival, but not until I tried them. The quality of the food they offered in the festival is far below par.\n\nTwo dishes offered in 2017 festival, street pancake and sizzling squid.\n\nThe sizzling squid is served super fast, taste is not impressive, but ok. A little bit overly salty, but still acceptable.\n\nI waited very long time for the pancake, even there's not too many people in the line. \n\nOnce got the pancake, I quickly noticed it looks completely different from what it showed on menu photo. The photo showed pancake has egg on the outside, with glaze of cilantro and green onions. But what I get is a light browned pancake have nothing outside, no egg, no greens.\nAnd the pancake taste weird. The pancake part taste very similar to traditional American pancake, instead of Chinese pancake. The filling is not tasty too, the sauce used in the pancake filling is the same as the sauce used for squid I believe, which is not what I expected from a Chinese pancake.", "author": "Wenjing Y."}

The best part - they have their own small private lot to the side for customer parking! - that's unheard of in SF.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive - stews, veggies, appetizers, cold dishes, beijing pancakes, and even hotpot. The veggie fried rice was ok - great portions but the flavor was avg. I was actually surprised they had rice because northern chinese cuisine is known for not eating rice and supplementing it with bing and baos (pancakes and buns). \n\nThe fish fillet with tofu was good - slightly oily but the flavors were great. The best dish was the bean curd and napa cabbage warm pot / soup - great flavors but not heavy. I wish the bean curd was actually bean curd and not tofu - either that or change the menu item name. \n\nThe Beijing street pancake was awesome - as close to authentic as you can get. Thin layer of egg around a pancake filled with crispy wonton skin chips, hoisin sauce, and cilantro. Yum!\n\nPrices are good and they take credit card.

Nothing really extraordinary or out of this world. You have to order in advance to get the duck. I'd encourage you to visit Great China in Berkeley for really unique beijing duck; no need to order in advance. The duck at Beijing restaurant was moderately fatty and the skin was somewhat crispy but there were also pieces that were soggy. It didn't feel like we got much meat or skin for the price we paid; must have been a really small duck. It was nice that it came with soup for the price though; not all places give you the bones in a soup. \n\nThe beijing street pancake was okay, but nothing like what you can get on the streets of beijing. I wish they included the crispy wonton inside. It's hard to find this dish regardless though, so I'm glad they gave it an attempt. \n\nCrispy eggplant dish was different and pretty tasty. I'd never had anything like that before, but it would taste just like you would expect battered and fried eggplant with sauce to taste like. \n\nThe chive pancake was okay, but I've had better -- crispier and firmer on the outside. \n\nSauteed pea shoots were the bomb!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-04", "description": "This restaurant has been a fixture in the Excelsior District and has been a mystery to me for years, at least until now. Beijing is known as the little red Resturant that specializes in norther Chinese dishes. Even Yao Ming (the Houston Rockets basketball legend) loved this place and has been on record as saying \"it's one of his favorite places to eat when he comes to San Francisco.\"\n\nEach dish is packed with big flavors and the menu itself, offers so many options to choose from. In fact the current menu has about eight pages worth of delicious food. I personally loved the: long beans, a curry style chow mein, the crispy onion pancake and of course the steamed pork dumplings. The long beans were fried just right and the pepper sauce that's coated on those beans takes the dish to new heights. The curry version of chow mein uses angel hair noodles and mixed with large pieces of shrimp, green onions and dollops of Curry. Add eggs and cuts of sausage, that's married together in spices. \n\nThe onion cake was cooked to perfection. Unlike most places that keep it drenched in cooking oil. It was the best combination of airy and crispy and cooked to perfection. Although it was good it missed a salty element like hoisin sauce to compliment it. Instead of getting it, Thats when the frustration began to set in. Our table had continuously asked for hoisin sauce or something to use as a dipping sauce. We were told numerous times they were getting it for us. But fifteen minutes later and after asking the staff members numerous times. we were finally told they don't carry any. That kinda served was the theme throughout the meal. Plates of food were slammed down on our dining table. When we were giving our order, the waiter was real short and seemed annoyed. Like we did something wrong by wanting to eat there. Asking for things like hoisin and water was a chore and became frustrating. \n\nNow I will say it could've been because it was busy. Because when I asked why was it like that. it was made clear the main focus should always be on the foods an not the service. So the service is just secondary I guess. Anyhow I say that as a warning so people aren't turned off by it. So once again the Restuarant is very small so you will feel like people are sitting and eating right on top of you. There's very little you can do about it But the food was really good and the price point was low. That ultimately means it's worth going back for another taste in my opinion.", "author": "Donald W."}

On a whim I added a few more items to the order including Fried Prawn and Saut\u00e9ed Green Beans.\nThe man who took my order was pleasant but during my wait I witnessed him bussing tables and PICKING THINGS OFF OF THE FLOOR then delivering food to tables and handling fresh table settings without washing his hands in between.\nHe and then someone I assumed was a delivery driver both put my bag together constantly fiddling with it. For some reason the only used one tall bag placing the soup containers at the bottom.\nWhen I got home and removed the items and was not happy:\nThe bottom of the bag was completely flooded by one of the soup containers that had leaked and lost all of its liquid. So I had to deal with the mess of wet napkins and fishing the chili sauce containers out while dumping the bag of broth down the sink. If you order soup to go or delivery here, I strongly recommend you insist that they put it in a separate bag so it can be monitored easier in travel.\nAt least have lost the broth I now had extra Won Tons to add to the second soup container to make a better dumpling/soup ratio (I was feeling Melissa McCarthy's struggle in Ghostbusters). \nThe broth was very bland and definitely needed the Chili Sauce to give it some flavor.\nI was shocked to find the Fried Prawn was whole and with eyes and feelers poking out through breading. In an attempt to be adventurous I tried one but it was quiet disgusting to me and tasted like their digestive tracks were still intact and they had been fried in old oil. Perhaps this is a more traditional Chinese way to serve them? I don't know. I had never seen them prepared this way and was not expecting it but has now made me leery of ordering fried prawn in restaurants without asking if they'd been cleaned. At any rate, the oil they used was inexcusable.\nI'll attempt to attach a pic of the prawn so you can see what I mean.\nLastly, where the soup was bland, the Saut\u00e9ed Green Beans were almost too salty but still pleasant.\nI can't recommend this place to anyone but if you insist on going, take these things into consideration.", "author": "Ken H."}

It tastes pretty good, maybe there were too much dough that the taste of green onion was quite lacking. It would have been better if it was more flavorful. one thing good about this is that it's not oily like other pancakes I've had.\n\nBeef Stew Noodle Soup:\nIt tastes okay, it was a little spicy but very slightly. I like everything about this from the thick chewy noodles to the beef, but the soup was a bit bland for my liking, I've definitely had better beef stew noodle in the city. \n\nChives and Shrimp dumpling:\nThe dumpling tasted fine, it wasn't anything special. I don't think it was worth my money for the dumplings because I think the ones I buy at ranch 99 tastes better but that's just me.\n\nI don't remember what this dish is called so I'm just gonna name it the \n5 color noodle salad:\nIt consist of cucumbers, green and red bell peppers, egg, cilantro and noodles. It's a cold dish. They first bring it out and set up and placed nicely on a plate with the noodles in the middle, then they pour a brown thick soup with pork shreds in it, and starts mixing it all together. The texture of the noodle is actually very interesting because it looks like \"Ho Fun\" (Thick rice noodle) but when you bite it the texture tastes kind of like jello. I think it tastes okay, but I'm not a fan. Even though they mix it in the sauce it seems that the flavor of the sauce can't really seep into the food therefore you can't really taste it.\n\nFor me I think the food here was all lacking in flavor which was disappointing because in the Chinese culture the flavors are suppose to be very bold and strong.

As you can tell, I'm a bit behind on my reviews. :X\n\nBeijing is quite small with several tables to accommodate a party of four, and then a large rectangular table in the back to accommodate 16. Since we came early enough, we were promptly seated. \n\nFOOD:\nBR serves up Northern Chinese Cuisine meaning you will find dishes with Szechuan and Shanghai influences that many other Chinese restaurants in the city won't have.  \n\nIf you're on a diet, make sure to ask how the dishes are cooked b/c some of the dishes are fried when I thought it would be braised or steamed.\n\n*Sizzling Seafood Rice Soup ($5.95): YUM! The soup was very comforting; the broth was rich and flavorful as opposed to being salty. The scallops, calamari, and shrimp were fresh, sweet, and tender. The sizzling rice is like rice crispies that are placed on the soup upon serving which give it a nice texture contrast.\n\n*Cumin Lamb ($9.95): VERY GOOD! The lamb was stir fried to a perfect tenderness and wasn't too gamey. The cumin flavor was very prominent which was slightly bitter and nutty, while the peppercorns added a strong kick.\n\n*Ground Bean Sheet w/ Pork ($7.95):YUM! This is basically a rendition of chow fun (wet). The bean sheets are like clear chow fun noodles which were tender w/ a bite. The pork was tender and flavorful and the bean sprouts added a nice fresh crisp to the dish.\n\n*House Special Steamed Meatball ($9.95): GOOD! These meatballs are basically lion head meatballs which is a hearty comfort food for me. The fist-sized meatballs were soft, tender, full of flavor; salty, savory, and sweet from the white/black pepper, soy, ginger, and scallions.\n \n*Egg Surface Tofu ($8.95): OK. I thought the tofu would be steamed or braised since it would be topped w/ an egg white sauce. However, it was fried. Aside from the misunderstanding, the tofu was soft, tender and the runny egg white sauce added creaminess to the tofu.\n\nSERVICE:\nEfficient and prompt, however, there was a slight language barrier. My friend can't eat fish and the Sizzling Rice Soup came w/ fish, so it took some explaining and hand gestures to the waiters. \n\nOverall Beijing is the real deal when it comes to Northern Chinese Cuisine. All the dishes are authentically cooked and as opposed to using salt or MSG, they utilize spices to produce flavorful dishes that will tingle your taste buds!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I would give this restaurant negative stars if I can.\n\nThe food is ok, but the customer service is TERRIBLE. I have never EVER been to a restaurant that is so disrespectful to its customers. I have literally seen them picking up utensil from the floor and DIRECTLY put it on one of the tables. Yes, customers, you don't even know what you are putting into your mouth.\n\nThe other time I ordered something for delivery, the experience didn't get any better. When I gave them the delivery address, the person on the phone just couldn't get the name of the address. I literally spent 10 minutes spelling out NELSON RISING LN. Literally. \n\nOK. I understand they are not native speakers so I went on with my utter patience. I said \"I want No.x, blah blah blah; No.y, blah blah blah.\" While I try to be nice and make things go smooth, it made the guy on the phone impatient (WTF?). Him: \"Don't say the numbers.\" Then I gave them my credit card number, the guy went: \"If you're not pausing every four numbers I'm not writing it down\". And no, he didn't say it in a suggestive manner, but really made me feel he was the boss and he's telling me I'm not doing the right thing. I am utterly offended.\n\nTo the staff in this restaurant, there is a saying that customers are always right. You don't get to dictate how the customers make order. And If you don't get something the customer said, APOLOGIZE, say sorry or pardon me. Or I assure you that your place is gonna close down in a few years.\n\nTo the fellow customers, run if you don't want to be bullied by these rude people.

I need cash tip.\" he replied. I looked around uneasily and thought about whether or not I had cash to throw atop the $4 tip I'd already given. \"I don't have any cash and I already tipped you.\" I didn't know what else to tell him and he just stood there staring at me. I felt uneasy, like maybe he'd come later and take what is rightfully his. (Cause I'm dramatic AF)\n\n\"Okay,\" he finally said after a 10 second staring contest that felt like 10 minutes, \"Next time, I know. I know, next time.\" and then he left.

I felt responsible.\n\nI called the restaurant and spoke to someone who said that they don't take credit card tips, only cash. \"Then who got my $4 tip?\" I really wanted to know. The man on the phone told me I can come in and tip Joe (the delivery guy) in person, if I wanted him to get a tip, but that was it.  I hung up, no longer dejected and mainly just over it all.\n\nThen I opened my hot, yummy looking noodles, took a big bite and stared at the bland, flavorless meal in front of me. What an illusion.

No false modesty, no fake humility. I grew up with the stuff, it's my version of comfort food, I've studied its history, creation and technique extensively, and I make it myself. I've had beef noodle soup cooked by master Taiwanese chefs where the noodles are the definition of al dente (\"kiu kiu\" in Mandarin) because they're completely handmade, the beef and broth are stewed for an entire day and the bok choy (my preference over spinach) is just the right amount of crisp. I wasn't expecting anything like that from Beijing Restaurant, but I was expecting a certain level of quality for a restaurant purporting to offer Northern Chinese cuisine.\n\nThe beef noodle soup here sucks. Don't get it. It's flavorless, oily beyond description and just plain gross. The beef is actually stewed quite nicely and very tender, but its good qualities are lost in a badly seasoned broth accompanied by overcooked, mushy bok choy (of which they only give a couple). The best thing I can say about their beef noodle soup is it's still miles better than that atrocious mess at Kingdom of Dumpling.\n\nThe Beef with Green Onions is much better and gives me hope that Beijing Restaurant kind of knows what it's doing. In this dish, the beef was tender and perfectly flavored without being overwhelmed by all the green onions. Served simply over a bed of fragrant, jasmine long-grain rice, it's a simple, tasty meal for those days when you don't want to deal with anything fancy.\n\nI do plan on trying Beijing Restaurant again and ordering other dishes that they might be better at, so this review might get updated with a higher rating. But for now, I'll cross this place off as yet another beef noodle soup disappointment.", "author": "Josephine L."}

The restaurant is pretty small, but they can accommodate large groups of 10 because of the large banquet tables.\n\nFOOD: CHEAP, COMFORTING AND DELICIOUS. I recommend the beef noodle soup (veggies, beef, spicy broth and udon type noodles), Cumin Lamb (My favorite, spicy and flavorful. Tender not overcooked lamb, that didn't taste gamey), Chinese Burger (ground meat, green onions in a \"bao\" type bun). Dinner here for a group of 10 getting at least 8 dishes was somewhere in the $12-$15 neighborhood. \n\nSTAFF: RUDE RUDE RUDE. I did not like the service I got at all. Overall, when going to a restaurant you should not feel bad for asking for: 1.) more bowls to eat the food you are paying for or 2.) Water to Drink. If you can stomach the service, then it is okay. \n\nLogistics:\nPARKING: Street parking available in the surrounding neighborhood. Be careful in the dark alleys at night\n\nOverall, I wouldn't come back to this little shack. The food is worth coming for, but the environment and staff would keep me away.

We had to ask for water over 5 times to different waiters, and get out of our seats to do so, because the waiters were too scared to make eye contact with us. Or even come near our table. \n\nFirst, they failed to give us white rice, after many attempts of asking. Then they messed up on an order of Chicken Chow Mein twice. First they forgot to put our order in after 30 minutes of waiting. Then they brought over combination chowmein in stead of chicken chow mein. After we told them that was wrong, Shrimp Chow Mein appeared on their table.. My friends were starving so they didnt care anymore and just thought they should just eat it. \n\nUntil we realized we would probably get charged more for it. Indeed I was right. I told them the problem, and they seemed to just shrug it off and say it would get fixed.

I first tried some menu items from this restaurant back in June, and I've become a regular customer since, but only recently have I actually sat inside the restaurant to eat.\n\nThe restaurant space is fairly small.  Hundreds of photographs adorn the walls and if you've read some of the other reviews you'll probably already know that basketball star Yao Ming is featured on several of them.  The service is excellent, and honestly, when was the last time you heard that about a casual, inexpensive Chinese restaurant in the City?  They have their own parking lot too, and they deliver to the neighborhood.  They even deliver for free if your food total hits the $15 minimum.\n\nI've stuck to the House Specials, the hand pulled noodles and the Beijing dim sum for the most part.  I think the only dish I've ordered not listed under those three categories was a beef chow fun, and I've had that at least three times.  Here are some of the items I've tried when I've dined at the restaurant.\n\nHouse Special Steamed Baozi (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/OagR2JyL-nSm1oBYQ1O1hw/l) and (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/ljnVUENOs0WR-U4YELdChw/l) - These are little steamed buns with a lean pork and chopped Chinese greens filling.  They're not soupy like xiao lung baos, and the outer bun is quite thin.  These are quite good but only when they're hot.\n\nThree Flavor Dumplings (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/_lbwwg7dJWwJl_UEmiHz2A/l) and (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/5LgcTqh7dnz3525Tk5cuuw/l) - These are my favorite steamed dumplings here.  They're packed with a juicy mixture of ground pork, ground chicken, shrimp and chopped chives.\n\nBeef Stew Noodle Soup (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/a-IzRHuhtOzz4FRrEUV1Pg/l) - I love their hand pulled noodles which are less doughy than some and always seems to have the exact same chewy consistency and texture.  The beef stew has a good mix of meaty pieces, pieces with tendons and tender Shanghai bok choy.  I'm not a big fan of the dark brown broth though because I think it lacks depth.\n\nPreserved Vegetable Shredded Pork Noodle Soup (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/qkiy-6GpgCJEX8LXLgOB-w/l) - This is easily my favorite of the soup noodles here.  I often have the spicy preserved vegetables with pork over rice at home, so this selection is very homey to me.  The vegetables and pork are stir fried then served on top of the handmade noodles and chicken broth.  I love the little splash of sesame oil to finish the stir fry.  It just taste so good!  The broth in this dish is usually perfectly seasoned for me.\n\nBeef Chow Fun (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/GLnj-MVDPlzLzfgO1q5tTw/l) - I learned about good wok hay at a very young age.  Wok hay in Cantonese often refers to foods cooked perfectly in a wok with a nice seared flavor locked into the ingredients.  The fried beef in Beijing's beef chow fun has a beautiful crust on nearly each piece of meat sizzled to near perfection.  They go really easy on the bean sprouts and the onions too meaning I get more chewy rice noodles than I do inexpensive fillers.\n\nHouse Special Hot Chicken Wings (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/EU38hA8fVl4pLn1yXJ2IgQ/l) - These crispy fried chicken wings are very good with a nice outer crust and juicy meat on the inside.  Mixed in a saute of green onion, white onion, cilantro and dry red chiles the flavor had absolutely no spicyness to it however.  Perhaps had they broken the meat of the chiles that would have helped.  If you want good chicken wings these are very good.  If you want good, spicy chicken wings then these are definitely disappointing.\n\nOverall I'd give a 4.5, but for hand-pulled noodles and flavorful dumplings delivered to my front door I've got nothing but 5 star love for Beijing Restaurant.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

The meat pancakes were very soggy. The prawns with pine nuts came with no pine nuts. My instructions online were to add white rice and I also called to make sure they added the with rice. I DID NOT GET ANY WHITE RICE! So I had to cook rice after my food came. By the time the rice was cooked, my food was cold.

I took my parents here and they are tough critics for authentic Chinese food, and this seemed to pass their test. \n\nSure, it's not in the best of neighborhoods and it might look a little small and divey on the outside--but that's when you know you've stumbled on something good. The inside of the restaurant is much more warm and bright. Customer photos line the walls (but not in a cheesy sort of way). It's more charming than cheesy. Maybe the endorsement from Yao Ming helps--I don't know, maybe I'm biased because I like basketball. \n\nThe service is good, and the food is good. We enjoyed the Beijing beef pancakes, the beef noodle soup, the Beijing noodles, the mushu pork, and these Bejing hamburger things my dad ordered that looked straight off some fancy food truck in SF. \n\nAll in all, a pretty solid meal in an unexpectedly pleasant environment with decently priced food at a place that stays open til' 2am!

My Chinese friends have always told me never to buy fried rice from a Chinese restaurant but I ignore their advice and continue to order it.  The food was delivered in less than 30 minutes and was hot and  ready to eat. \n\nI enjoyed the food so I called Beijing a week later to have more food delivered.  I said I wanted to have some food delivered but the Beijing employee told me there was nobody available for delivery.  Dine-in and delivery were my only options so I ordered a pizza instead.\n\nA few days later I still had a yen - or should I say yuan - for Chinese food so I called Beijing back.  I got the same reply from the Beijing employee.  Nobody was available to deliver food.  Since there are dozens of Chinese restaurants near my neighborhood, I simply checked the phone book and ordered from Win Garden.\n\nI will order from Beijing again but only if they deliver.

My parents are hard to please and even more difficult to veer away from any Cantonese food that is within arms reach. Luckily, it was my bday dinner and they couldn't say no since it was still Chinese food. Everything was delicious, especially every type of noodle that we had. No rice ordered of course, northern China is big on noodles and breads while southern Chinese is about rice. \n\nThe server made it sound like every dish was \"special\" to their restaurant which was another reason for us to order enough the usual 7+ dishes for a family of 4. The lamb dumplings are better at Darda in Milpitas but they had some of the best hong shao ro (red braised pork) I've had in a long time. The za zhang mein had a refreshing cucumber flavor and the texture of the noodles were springy. I got into zombie eating mode from all the deliciousness and ended up experiencing the meat sweats for the first time. My sister explained to me that difficulty breathing is part of the deal. \n\nI noticed that they also have American Chinese food on the menu which looked good too but I highly suggest that you avoid those and order what they're really known for - authentic northern Chinese food.", "author": "Rena J."}

And for the most part, the Bay Area just sucks to get good northern Chinese food. \n\nBeijing restaurant comes somewhat close. I came here with my dad and was greeted with those wonderful plastic flaps. For Americans confused as this, the flaps are used to protect the diners from the cold and wind every time the door opens.\n\nThis is a pretty small restaurant and I ordered the Beijing noodles (\u70b8\u9171\u9762) and Beijing crispy pancake (\u714e\u997c). The crispy pancake was pretty authentic, crispy on the inside, and had the right amount of egg, cilantro, green onions, and even sesames. However, I found the Beijing noodles to be TOO salty and lacking in pork pieces.

Textually, this dish was perfectly prepared, the crunch of the celery combined with the toothsome offal provided a satisfying compliment to one another. I can say without hyperbole that this may have been one of the best preparations of liver I've had within the last six months. \n\nI enjoyed the House Special Eggplant (9.95)  (ordered for my long-suffering mother) as well. Coming with a basil sauce, and incorporating both chicken and shrimp alongside the aforementioned eggplant, this dish easily won a place in my heart with it's exceptionally herbal flavor profile which graciously complimented the delicate flavor of the eggplant, without being overwhelming. The eggplant was extraordinarily tender, and contrasted well with the crunch of the perfectly cooked shrimp, and tender chicken.\n\nWe also tried the Cumin Lamb (10.95 per serving)  on the recommendation of just about every Yelper who has ever reviewed this Restaurant. While it wasn't overly spicy, the tender morsels of Lamb came coated in both cumin and crushed red peppers, which provided an explosive counterpart to the slightly gamey flavor of the exceptionally juicy, not overly greasy lamb, shocking my palate with an intense burst of flavors after every bite. When combined with the crunchy onions and green peppers that garnish the dish, what results is a unique flavor and textural profile miles away from the over-sauced, saccharine sweet examples of Chinese Cuisine I grew up on.\n\nFor appetizers, we shared some excellent Crab and Cream Cheese Puffs (5.25), which featured excellent fillo dough and remarkably delicate crab. In addition, we also had the Jaebing, which combined soft scrambled egg, onions, cilantro and sesame seeds into a unique crepe-style treat which housed a deep-fried wonton in its center, providing a fantastic crunch in this extraordinarily hard-to-find dish.\n  \nI would be remiss if I were to ignore the \"Chinese Burger\" (3.95 a piece), which combines  tender pulled pork, vinegar and cilantro in a dense, biscuit-like bun. This culinary delight  could be a revelation for anyone who hasn't found themselves in favor of fusion-style cuisine yet, existing for all intents and purposes as a fantastic bridge between Southern sandwiches and Chinese flavor profiles.\n\n5 Stars, solid food..\n\nExtras:\n\nParking available!\n\nConvenient to the 44, 47, 29, 14. \n\nCredit Cards accepted.\n\nOpen LATE.", "author": "Casey U."}

Seeing from the reviews that their specialty is beijing food and not american chinese food, I pretty much stuck to the beijing menu items.  I ordered online at their website.   If your order is less than $100, it takes about an hour.  If it's more than $100, it will take longer.\n\nMy order came promptly in about an hour.\n\nI found their beijing items interesting, but I don't think they are to my taste.  I ordered:\n\n-jing dong meat pancakes\n-cumin lamb\n-steam house special baozi\n-west lake lamb dumpling\n-combination fried rice\n\nFor $8.25 and only about 4-6 slices of a pancake, I thought it was pretty pricey and it wasn't especially tender or chunky or tasty.\n\nThey give generous servings of cumin lamb with lots of green/red/yellow pepper chunks and I loved the fragrance/flavor of the cumin, but the meat wasn't especially tender and the heat of the chili or red pepper flakes was SOOOOO hot that I was grabbing for water/soda every mouthful. I am used to hot food since my mom cooks filipino dishes which are sometimes hot AND I also regularly like eating indian foods which are nearly always hot AND i do like many hot chinese dishes, but the heat was so hot even for me, especially without any other food items except rice to dissipate the heat like with dairy products (sour cream, yogurt) or bananas.  They should put options as to how hot somebody wants their dishes like 1-not hot at all, 2-mildly hot, 3-normal hot.\n\nThe steam house special baozi is like small sized steam buns.  I thought I would enjoy them since I know how regular sized pork-filled steam buns taste like, but they smelled/tasted a bit too vinegary and there wasn't much filling.\n\nThe west lake lamb dumpling was a bit too thick on the outside and the filling tasted kind of gamey.  Also, the outside shell looked like it was kind of raw.  I'm not an expert on these kind of dumplings, but it didn't look very appetizing at first.\n\nFunny as it seems, the only item I really felt comfortable with was their fried rice which was well mixed, had some medium shrimp and a few strips of meat, though I've had better fried rice at joe's excellent chinese cuisine or jasmine tea house.\n\nI couldn't finish all of the food in one sitting so I put the remainder - the baozi and dumplings in the refrigerator and fried/reheated them the next day and they tasted a lot better.\n\nI MAY try it another time to see what other food items are like, but I don't think I would make it a regular go-to place or be rushing back to order for delivery from there.", "author": "Frugal C."}

The order came out like this: green onion and beef, then the beef stew noodles, a cup of rice, and last the deep fried crab puffs. Green onion and beef were tender, but it was pretty bland - it needed salt (and I am not a big salt person either but this dish needed it). Beef stew a little flavorful, beef was so tender too, noodles \"freshly made\", but did not stand out. D/f crab puffs contained plently of cream cheese but where's the crab? Maybe had 2-3 minced imitation crab pieces, but plenty of cream cheese - cream cheese galore! Oh well not a problem at least its less than $6.\n\nThe service was not that great. Some of our plates and food were slammed on the table. Felt neglected because they pretty much just stood there and not once asked if we needed anything. The hubs asked for water politely and it felt like it was a hassle for them to do it. When another young couple came in they were pretty much entertained preferrably because they were Chinese and spoke Mandarin. Their server talked to them more, and ensured if everything was ok. And here we are in the corner neglected like a child on time out. The lady immediately had her glass refilled even though it was 2/3 full, and the owner seen this from his register.

The last two times I've been, in the last 3-4 months (including this week) the food was TERRIBLE. Am sure they changed their cook and/or management. I ordered General Tso's chicken. As anyone familiar with dish knows, it has a hot-sweet glaze over all of the pieces, which are chunks. This time it came with literally no sauce/glaze but for some sriracha-type chili-ketchup shaken on the top of the dish- not even hitting all the pieces. This is not the correct sauce/glaze and to just shake some on top w/o coating pieces- never have seen this in a dish I order very frequently at Chinese restaurants all over. Also the chicken was small, scrap-like pieces with mostly breading and weird spongy texture inside. Pretty sure it was bulk frozen chicken fingers. The chow mein also was bad. Normally the boiled noodles then are wok-fried a with the meat/veg. These were not stir-fried, and they were cold & greasy with little meat & veg. Finally, waitstaff was rude: as I was there in person placing a to-go order with 3 or 4 items, with a few questions or instructions about ingredients (degree of spicy etc); the girl kept stopping to answer the phone and take other customers' orders. Then again, she'd stop in middle of my order to go seat diners just walking in.Then we'd start all over again with my order, since she'd have lost her place or gotten confused.

The wings here, pretty damn good, and pending on your preference, might even be better than San Tung. The batter used creates a crispier skin, the meat is tender and the spice level just right. It has more of a after taste, smoky spicy feel. Doesn't hit you right away.  \n\nThe lamb, tender, not over cooked like a lot of other places I've tried. It's also not covered in chili powder, just a tad, along with pepper flakes. Not only is it cooked right, they left just enough fat on the meat. \n\nthere are other dishes, but not really worth mentioning.

Beijing Restaurant is an unflashy restaurant located at a semi-isolated area within the boundaries of the city.  I'd been reading reviews about this place for quite some time, and finally decided to give it a go.  The staff was outstandingly personable and knowledgeable.  I had a ball chatting with them.  The food, however, was a different story.  At best, it's okay.  We ordered quite a few dishes (that's how excited we were and how much we trusted Yelp's 4 stars), including dumplings, chive pancakes, seafood, noodles, even their specialty of the day (large hotpot dish).   It should have made for a lot of chopstick ruckus or starry-eyed patrons. And though no one spit out their food, no one was excited to take home leftovers either.  \n\nI won't be choosing it over other restaurants in the city.  If I'm in the area, perhaps I'd drop by -- but that'd be because of transportation issues, a line of closed restaurants, or ravenous hunger from dealing with the latter options.

She found it on Yelp and we both wanted to try Beijing since it's rated 4 stars and located close by.  \n\nFOOD:\n*Sizzling Rice Soup ($5.95 small) - Good.  Beware if you have seafood allergies - fish, imitation crab, squid, clams and shrimp are included in the broth.  I'm allergic to fish and they were extremely nice to redo the soup for me without fish in the broth since I didn't know fish would be in the soup.\n\n*Cumin Lamb ($9.95) - YUM!  Thin slices of lamb are cooked with a variety of spices, bell peppers, and onions.  Be careful, the spices add a good kick to the dish.\n\n*House Special Steam Meat Ball ($9.95, 4 pieces) - It was okay.  We figured this was similar to lionhead meatballs, which it sort of is.  Medium size pan fried meatballs are served on lettuce leaves with a thick sauce and green onions on top.  \n\n*Egg Surface Tofu ($8.95) - Good.  We didn't know what the dish was and asked the waiter who told us an egg sauce was placed on top of the tofu.  When the dish came out, it was deep fried tofu pieces with a thick light brown sauce.  Although I don't know where the egg was in this dish, it was still good where the tofu was perfectly deep fried and the sauce gave it a bit more flavor.\n\n*Pork with Ground Bean Sheet ($7.95) - YUMMY!!  This dish was similar to a chow fun dish with the sauce.  Ground bean sheets were like clear chow fun/ho fun noodles or thick clear flat noodles.  The dish contains lots of chopped garlic with shreds of pork in a very flavorful brown sauce.  \n\nSERVICE:\nGood - the waiters were all friendly and accommodating.  They were also willing to pack our leftovers (always a big plus to me!!).\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*The menu states no MSG\n*The restaurant is clean (big bonus points for an Asian restaurant!)\n*The restaurant is small - it can probably accommodate about 30 people or so\n\nPARKING:\nA small lot is adjacent to Beijing on Alemany Blvd or metered street parking. \n\nBeijing has great food and I'll definitely be back to try more items off their extensive menu!", "author": "Nicole S."}

There was something very different about this one... in reading the menu, there was acutally Beijing food on the menu!  Boy, was this a pleasant surprise.  So many restaurants named Mandarin, Hunan, Shanghai, or other northern cooking styles offer menus that don't reflect their cuisine, serving the more common Cantonese fare.  This restaurant is the real deal and, yes, they literally deliver too!\nWhen dining with my family, we recently ordered the following:\n\nAppetizers:\na) Green Onion Pancake - Green Onions check.  Tasty dough check.\nb) Steamed Pork and Vegetable Dumplings - Tasty choice especially with dark vinegar dipping sauce.\nc) Pot Stickers - The plate came piping hot and the bottoms were crispy good.\nd) Rainbow Noodle Skin (Fen Pi) - A segregated salad mixture of shredded eggs, cucumber, green and red bell peppers, pork slices, and cellophane noodle in a sweet brown sauce (possibly the same bean sauce on their jia jiang mein).  It reminded me of Great China's (Berkeley) famed \"Double Skin\", but not quite as good. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8sTqr9ehaZuqORQCddYeUg?select=z3tRaMbENkKV8D9LfhD_Dw)\ne) Pork Meatball Soup - Served in a clay pot over a small flame, the ingredients include sour cabbage, Napa Cabbage, pork meatballs, and cilantro in a tastebud opening broth.  If you don't like sour, you won't like this dish.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8sTqr9ehaZuqORQCddYeUg?select=WbBMS4hhqmH1n5iEcjdpww)\nf) House Fried Rice - My brother chose this dish because he tired of the normally served white rice at most Chinese restaurants.  It was okay with small pieces of beef and shrimp.\ng) Fish Flavored Eggplant - Cooked in a brown sauce spiced up with some red chili oil, the eggplant was both soft and chewy at the same time.\nh) Basil Chicken - Stir fried chicken meat with baby corn, red bell peppers, water chestnuts (canned), and basil, this dish was tasty and a nice contrast to the other dinner flavors.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8sTqr9ehaZuqORQCddYeUg?select=17reIZRa3vFH8BVM26GoeQ)\n\nAs usual, we overordered for a party of four.  However, since our family doesn't mind leftovers, the abundance of food is not an issue.  They also offer a hot pot menu, which is nice during winter months.  We arrived before 6 pm to beat the dinner rush as the restaurant is quite small (six or seven tables for four and two large tables for ten or more).  They have a small adjoining parking lot that is gets full later in the evening (if you don't want to wait, come early).  We must dine here more than I remember as we were seated next to our picture on their walls of fame (assorted pictures of dining guests).  The delivery option also makes things convenient if you can't let go of the TV remote control at home.", "author": "Mike C."}

It's the best.\n\nSoups: (large 6.95 to 7.95) (small: 4.95 to 5.95): get the Won Ton Soup as most resturant will serve you Hot and Sour. The Warm Pots (9.50 to 10.95) are soups as well, not solid dishes.\n\nThe Beijing Specials: (6.95 to 12.95)\nare great!!! The main dish I would choice in my opinion would be the Cumin Lamb (beef) 9.95. It's kinda gamy, but it's great!!! \n\nBeijing Dim Sum (6.95 to 7.95) are another popular dish, the pancakes are great with rice.\n\nFlour Balls (7.95 to 8.25) are a Chinese Street Food that are great in the mouth. \n\nFried Rice (5.95 to 6.95)\nSteam Rice is 1.00 here.\n\nChow Mein (5.95 to 6.95) great dish with great food. \n\nThe Chicken, Beef and Chicken meals (7.95 to 10.95) are the same as any other Chinese place.\n\nMushu (7.25 to 8.95) are good, all of them cone with 4 pancakes. (note: Chinese pancakes are not the same as American Breakfast pancakes!!!! Lumberjacks beware.)\n\nFor the Veggie Heads: Tou Fu and Beggie Meals (6.95 to 8.95).\n\nThere is a great lunch special that only runs in the week days (5.50). You get served with Appetizer, Soup and Rice.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the vibe is great. There is a number of Asians that go here in a common basics.\n\nOverall: Great food, great place.\n\nIf you don't believe me, trust Yao Ming or he'll dunked your *ss in the hoop!!!", "author": "Ivy V."}

I didn't get the rice or an order of egg rolls which I paid for. I also received kung pao chicken instead of cashew prawns. This was an order placed on the internet and doesn't seem too hard to mess up a written order.\nWhen I called to tell them about the mistake they brought the white rice, but not the egg rolls and they didn't say anything else. They really didn't seem to understand their mistake or communicate well.\nI probably won't order for delivery again.", "author": "Tenzin N."}

The place is decorated to a certain degree so it's decently nice for an SF restaurant, especially out on Alemany.  There's a parking lot on Alemany so that's very convenient. The best part of this place is the type of Chinese food. The food is not your Cantonese style food, it's more of a northern and some western Chinese influence.  The place is pretty small so is not good for a big group. They are also opened really late now.\n\n-Cummin lamb is delicious. They toss on the spices and create a good blend for the lamb. Very very tasty dish!\n\n-Mao Po(aka Numbing) fish soup with chilli peppers is very unique. The tastes are just really bold and unique. The fish and soup are a good compliment. This is a bigger dish that you'll definitely want to share as is the case for most Chinese dishes at Chinese restaurants\n\n-Lamb skewers, you can skip this. It's basically the cummin lamb but on skewers and more expensive. I didn't really taste all the good charcoal grill flavors that you would have if it was done on the streets in China. I'm assuming they used a griddle to cook these?\n\n-Dumplings were good! The skin of the dumpling is not too thick and the meat inside is pretty juicy and well seasoned. However, they do not have minced garlic for the dumplings? We requested it but they said that they didn't have any. How is it possible that a restaurant, any restaurant, not have minced garlic? I, and I believe many other people, like our dumplings with black vinegar(instead of soy sauce) and minced garlic. They have the black vinegar but not the minced garlic. \n\n-Eggplant dish was fabulous. They did a great job with the eggplant, very purple, tender but not overly mushy that the eggplant has no form.", "author": "Brian B."}

This is authentic mapo sauce, not the type the Cantonese restaurants cook with. Tofu, pork, peas, carrots.\n\n- Spicy Cold Beef Tripe ($6) - A bit expensive for a small amount of tripe but nonetheless very delicious with the mala sauce.\n\n- Garlic Eggplant - Eggplant with spicy garlic sauce. The sauce is great to go over rice.\n\n- House Chicken Wings ($12) - Expensive for the wings but they are delicious. Must try this at least once.\n\nWhen the BF went in for pick-up, he said he saw one of the workers eating from our Mapo Tofu. The lit was open and he literally had a spoon and was scooping it out. There was no bowl in sight so basically his saliva got mixed in the entree. They just closed the lid and put it in our take-out bag.

We ordered the beef pancakes, three flavors dumplings, sweet & sour meatballs, string beans and the cumin lamb. \n\nThe pancakes were good, although a bit greasy. The flavor seemed pretty authentic too. The dumplings were above average and juicy, always a plus. Sweet & sour meatballs were a new item for me -- they were small and fried and smothered in a vinegar and sugar sauce (no ketchup, yay!). That was my least favorite item of the day, but still pretty tasty. The string beans were crispy and tender on the inside, very garlicky and good. Cumin lamb was packed with flavor and quite the punch. My boyfriend thought it was a bit dry, but the meat was very tender and I liked it.\n\nAll in all, the place is definitely repeat visit worthy. The restaurant was a lot smaller than I expected and pretty packed. The wait staff is a bit disorganized at seating the guests, but it's worth the wait.

Not bad, I liked that so this way you know what you are ordering.  I was not really that hungry for the lunch specials, which included appetizer and soup.  I ordered the bbq pork fried rice (I judge a restaurant by the way the fried rice prepared.)  The rice and the ingredients were fresh, lots of scrambled eggs.  A little bland for my taste but thats me.  Huge portions, but the bbq pork was lacking, it was served slivered instead of the traditional big pieces.  I only ate half and brought the rest home, not bad, lunch and dinner for one price.  Reasonable prices, small clean and friendly staff. 3 stars for now.

The dining area was bright, neat and clean.  The chairs and tables are dark wood and the restaurant has a cozy feeling to it as there were tons of pictures of the owners with customers throughout the walls.  One particular customer that stood out was Yao Ming, definitely a good sign if he eats here.  ;)\n\nThe service was friendly and staff extremely nice.  I ordered the Yelp recommendations but also asked the waitress/co-owner for recommendations. She said a soup or warm clay pot would complement our selections.  She recommended the Sliced Fish with preserved vegetables warm pot.  It was an excellent recommendation as it turned out to be my favorite dish here. To the food:\n\n* Sliced Fish with Preserved Vegetables Warm Pot:  This was the best dish, tasty and contained generous slices of rock cod, homemade preserved vegetables, clear noodles, and topped with fresh cilantro.  Nicely served on a stand with small sterno-type chafing fuel to keep the pot warm. (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/8n4gMrljNwpFd6j3-dehOQ/l)\n\n* Cumin Lamb:  This dish was very tasty, generous amount of cumin seeds and lamb which were stir fried with green peppers and onions.  Very flavorful and surprisingly minimal amount of oil. (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/afq7mpaeWRgXHcUFwkiKYA/l)\n\n* Beijing Beef Pancake: Was so huge it barely fit on the plate, filling tasted similar to the meat in dumplings. (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/f0JlEL9SwtkpA6KV374O_w/l)\n\n* Beijing Noodles with special sauce: The noodles were chewy and slighlty gummy.  The sauce was salty, dark brown, and contained real pieces of pork. Served with diced celery, bean sprouts, and julienned cucumber. (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/-ygyhzQ2AYbf6IxGajAe-w/l)\n\n* Mongolian Beef: This was good as well but was overshadowed by the other dishes. (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/eB_jvZsfDwJZpbFhJZwnAQ/l)\n\nWhile we were eating one of the patrons asked the waiter/co-owner what ingredients were in a dish.  He said about 14 different ingredients but he didn't know what they were. So he than called out the other waitress/co-owner and she patiently listed out all the ingredients by heart. \n\nThis is the reason I gave this restaurant 5 stars, besides the great food, the owners are very nice and patiently answer all questions.

The lamb skewers were okay, but tasted a bit like it was marinated with too much corn starch.  The noodle soup was above average, but I've had better.  The noodles were hand pulled but lacked some chewiness (tasted a bit overcooked?!?).  I liked the beef slices though.  The soup was also light and not too oily.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Stir-fried Liver in Spicy Garlic Sauce\n- the liver was tender and the sauce was pure spicy delight. The gravy would have been excellent over a plate of rice or with a steamed bun.\n\n2. Sweet and Sour Pork Meatballs\n- The American sweet and sour sauce is laden with ketchup, red food coloring 5 and processed white vinegar. Authentic Chinese sweet and sour is actually a very heavy sauce, traditionally made with black vinegar that is more similar to Worcestershire and reduced with a lot of sugar to a sticky, thick-as-molasses syrup. This sauce is decadent, and drizzled over bite-sized, deep-fried pork meatballs.\n\n3. Chive Dumplings (Jou Cai He Zi)\nThese are like Chinese empanadas, filled with chives, eggs and garlic wrapped with a flour pastry. The pastry is then pan-fried in hot oil until the skin is bubbling and charred, and the juices from the filling run over your chin as you bite into it. \n\n4. Sour Cabbage and Pork Belly Clay Pot (Suan Cai Bai Rou Sa Guo)\nThis is the real deal. The cabbage is house-made and the pork is sliced so thin that it disintegrates in your mouth. The broth is rich in pork essence and they give you lots of fen pi (the slippery glass noodles) to slurp down with your soup.\n\nI took my father there to sample the food, and he was very pleased with the meal. This is a great family restaurant, with authentic Beijing-style food at a great price. \n\nOur entire meal came out to $39 and some change, and we had tons of leftovers for the next day.", "author": "May T."}

The menu's quite extensive, but we followed recommendations and tried to keep towards the Beijing dishes. The food:\n\n#26 Slice Fish with Preserved Vegetable in Warm Pot: Delicious. Normally I'm not particularly inclined towards fish soup or preserved vegetables, but I'd love to have this again, especially during cold weather. The mild white fish contrasts very well to the sharp taste of preserved vegetables, and the broth is tasty without being too heavy. The noodles were hard for me to eat, but that's my problem.\n\n#54 Beijing Beef Pancake - my favorite, 'cause how could it not be? There's a pretty thin layer of delicious beef between wonderful layers of soft, but crispy on the outside, \"pancake.\" I can't offer the most accurate comparison of what other culture's bread-like, meat-stuffed thing this is, but it's pretty much perfect.\n\n#66 Stired Flour Ball with Pork - probably my least favorite, although still pretty tasty. I wasn't sure what to expect with the flour balls, but they had the texture of slightly undercooked pasta, which is not bad in and of itself, but I kind of associate it negatively with the pasta. The flavors were good though.\n\n#91 Beijing Style Noodles with Brown Paste - We asked for a recommendation between this and the Beijing Noodles with Special Sauce. We were told the \"special sauce\" one was \"dry,\" while the brown paste was wet. I was a bit wary of the special sauce after hearing it was salty, so we went with brown paste - which definitely was \"wet,\" somewhere in between a soup and heavy sauce consistency. I liked the noodles, and the sauce was tasty, but a little bland. We had tons of leftovers, and I think I'll add a lot of vegetables to absorb some of the sauce. \n\nThe meal came to $33 without tip and would have very easily been enough food for 4 people.

Disappointment :-(   (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8sTqr9ehaZuqORQCddYeUg?select=C1zRokrBTWC8pxxBQbMuMw)\n- Egg rolls: These were crisp and tasty.

(photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8sTqr9ehaZuqORQCddYeUg?select=yCh7hIXx3ZptHL3R7fJnLw)\n- Prawns in spicy garlic sauce: Served on a bed of steamed brocolli. Unfortunately there was mostly brocolli and not many prawns, and there were too many onions slathered on top. And the sauce wasn't even spicy garlic, it was vinegary-tasting and watery, much like the sweet and sour sauce. Disappointment again. (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8sTqr9ehaZuqORQCddYeUg?select=1t7t8bdluQNwcEG_SV1Bvw)\n- Shrimp fried rice: Okay, it's getting a bit better.

So I packed the food myself and made a mental note: \"Service is two stars.\"\n\nValue: 4 stars. \nPortions are much smaller than at other Chinese restaurants, but the food is also less greasy.

Because of the location and its appearance, I assumed it was an Americanized Chinese, like a Panda Express. However, after the first try, I have been going back very often. The BeiJing food is very authentic. I like their meat pancake (jing dong pancake), and beef noodle soup. \nTip: Part of their menu is design for its neighborhood, so some items are Americanized, such as their lunch special. They need the customer base from the people work and live near by, which are mostly American and Mexican. These items tend to be a little salty, not as authentic, but still good. So, when you are there, try things on the main menu, and ask for suggestions.\nTip: For those who expect Cantonese food, don't go there. I think that was why someone gave one star because of \"searching for green onion pancake\"\nCONS: their service used to be very good, very polite and available. But the last two visits, the service is just like another Chinese restaurant. You will get service, but not as good as before. Last visits, I was there for week day lunch, but before, I was there for weekend lunch or dinner. Maybe that makes the difference.\n\nUpdate: ever since their menu updated with new price... couple of years ago(?), the food portion is smaller, and not tasted as good as before. Service is so so.

FYI: Yes, that parking lot on the side of the building is theirs.  Despite the outside of the restaurant looking a bit sketch, how awesome is it when you see a pic of the owners with Yao Ming right next to your table?  The hotpot part of the menu needed some translation/explanation so I'll break it down based on what I learned:\n\nFor each person, it is $2.50 for dipping sauce and broth\nThen you can request \"orders\" of meat, veggies, or noodles.  Meat is $6.50 an order and veggies/noodles/tofu=$3.50.  You can get spicy, regular, or half spicy and half regular which comes in a divided hotpot.  This is a great alternative to other shabu shabu places that require every person to order their own meat, veggies, etc and don't allow sharing.  We got tofu, spinach, noodles, lamb, and 2 orders of beef with the half-half broth.  The spicy side was for me, and warning: It is super spicy!  My face was melting off, literally!  I consumed probably 2 pitchers of water, but pain never tasted so good!  My mouth waters just thinking about the tender meat and spicy noodles and veggies. \n\nNext time I take my friend out, it is my treat so I am going to take him here!! YUM! I can't wait!  Beijing Restaurant also inspired me to perfect my own hotpot at home!", "author": "Steph W."}

I went to this restaurant with a huge craving for the sour/spicy goodness and instead got an off smelling glop of dark brown-near black liquid mess.  I could not believe it! That is what they call hot & sour soup???\n\nHow could they let this dish pass the kitchen?  I was so offended that they even served it to us this way.  This is literally one of my favorite soups and have ordered and made it many, many times.  I'm not usually a picky eater AND don't usually give bad reviews, but COME ON!!!   This was soup was pretty foul. \n\nFor a second, I thought: maybe it's just me and the H&S soup in Beijing is supposed to be this dark, so I hopped on my phone to google it.  \n\nWRONG!!! SO SOOO WRONG!!!\n\nI came to the conclusion that they had this soup sitting out, it got a little suspect so they tried to cover it up by adding extra soy sauce.\n\nI'm still bothered by it.  That soup wins an award for the WORST soup I have EVER had.  \n\nI am writing this to call out the staff at Beijing Restaurant, to let your customers know if you don't have a dish available or made fresh tell your customer,  \"sorry we are out, \" instead of serve someone that crap.  Or even take it off the menu if you can't get it right.  I can't imagine anyone enjoying it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-24", "description": "Northern Chinese food is not a common occurrence in the bay area but these guys do it right.\n\nWith that said let's talk about the food:\n\nPlease don't come here if you want traditional \"American\" Chinese food.  Go here for the glutinous meatballs, stir fried flour balls, hand made dumplings, and other tasty treats.  They do have traditional American style grub but you can get that anywhere.\n\nThe meatballs are high in starch, chewy, and very subtle in flavor.  The balls get a quick fry then are \"re-hydrated\" in sauce (ie tossed in a wok w/sauce).  The result is a savory, chewy meatball that is not like anything you will find at an Italian restaurant.  I love them and think it is worth a shot for anyone with an adventurous palate.\n\nStir fried flour balls are the Han version of gnocchi.  They're smaller chewier and bathed in Chinese flavors.\n\nThe dumplings are made fresh and available all day.  I go in at 11pm and there are still dumplings to be had and they always taste delicious.  I have tried them all and I love every single one of them.  Very subtle fresh flavor.\n\nI have to reiterate that this food is subtle in flavor.  It is not over the top like \"American\" style or Sichuan  cuisine.  There are many styles of food on the menu so there is something for everyone but if you want an authentic taste of Northern/Beijing cuisine stick to the house specialties.  \n\nThe cumin lamb is good: chewy, dry fried lamb with bell peppers stir fried together.\nThe noodles with brown sauce are glutinous, savory, and mild.  The cornstarch thickened broth has a viscous character to it but the mild, savory flavor paired with the chewy noodles really attracted my attention.  \nThe Beijing noodles have cold crunchy vegetables with black bean paste and hot noodles.  The ingredients are tossed table side and give you and cold/warm, crunchy/chewy sensation when you're eating it.\nThe garlicky pea shoots are always tasty and a good way to inject some vegetables into your meal.\nThe liver and vegetables is good if you like a strong irony, metallic, liver flavor and crunchy savory bell pepper.  Offal fans may like this dish.\nThe pancakes are awesome and the scallion/green onion will appeal to authentic/American style fans alike.  The cake is thick, flufy, doughy and packed with subtle oniony flavor.\nThe vegetable pancake is so tasty and chewy it should not be missed.\nThe stirred fried beef and tofu is also tasty.\n\nNever had anything from here I did not like.  Please try the Chinese lager they have here it pairs well with the food and is pretty reasonable in price (for the large 24oz bottle).\n\nI love this restaurant.  The food comes out as it is prepared so if you have a problem with that tell you server (ie mains before apps).  The younger guys that work at night (when I go in) may not be polished servers but they are friendly and willing to help you understand what you are eating.  Did I mention they cook until 1:30a and stay open till 2a!  Love the food, beer, service and location, make Beijing your spot for Northern Chinese food too!", "author": "Robert H."}

It's out on Alemany basically in the middle of nowhere, all by itself, and when you walk in you're transported into someone's kitchen in the far east. We could smell the food walking up and we were not disappointed.\n\nWe sat down and looked at the menu. It's like seven pages. Seven pages... I thought any place with that many different things has to screw something up, but I was wrong. We ordered Stir-fried potatoes, Wushu Pork, Lamb Dumplings, General's Chicken, Egg rolls and Mongolian Beef.\n\nStir-Fried Potatoes: They looked like noodles. We weren't sure if they screwed up our order, but one bite into them told us they'd gotten it just right. Seriously delicious. Savory, wonderful, thin sliced, wonderfully crispy potatoes in some amazing concoction of a sauce that just melts in your mouth.\n\nWushu Pork: Four pancakes and a pile of goodness. You make the pancakes into containers for the food and you eat it as a wrap. It is absolutely delicious, sweet, perfectly cooked and awesome.\n\nLamb Dumplings: I have heard on Yelp that these are really good and I have to say I wasn't surprised at all. Lamb can tend to be really overpowering, so to see it as part of a dumpling is a bit scary. Not so in the case of Beijing; every bite was a fantastic reminder of how truly gifted the chef is here. You have to taste these to believe them.\n\nGeneral's Chicken: This recipe is always butchered. It's kind of the bastard child of every terrible Chinese restaurant, and honestly I was expecting it to be decent, but it was beyond description. Seriously, I've never had a rendition of General's Chicken that tasted this good. Perfectly battered, tender chicken. I feel like every dish here is a journey.\n\nEgg rolls: Meatless, terrific little bites of tastiness. Seriously great, and the sweet and sour is nothing to be trifled with.\n\nMongolian Beef: This is by far the best rendition I've ever had of this dish. Tender beef, wonderful vegetables, I mean honestly there aren't enough adjectives in the world to describe this restaurant.\n\nBasically, the best chinese meal I've ever had. Hands down. And by the way, all this food came out to fifty bucks. *EPIC WIN*\n\nTl;DR: AMAZING food, cheap, kind of out of the way spot, worth the trip, best chinese meal ever.", "author": "Joshua G."}

The first taste, however, was a bit underwhelming.  After stirring well and constructing a more comprehensive taste (be sure to get some of the preserved cabbage and some fish into a single bite), I found myself devouring the rest of my serving and going in for more.  It was like fish soup with a ton of kimchi in it. I imagine that sounds pretty awful to some people, but for me it was great!\n\n--Shrimp with Pine Nuts\nThis was surprisingly good, even though it just looked like Shrimp with mayonnaise on it, or maybe cake icing or something.\n\n--Sweet and Sour Chicken\nI never really like \"sweet and sour\" dishes. That being said, this was some of the best sweet and sour chicken I've had.\n\nI'm not sure what the other items were called... \n\nWe had a noodle salad with HUGE noodles, nice fresh veggies, and well seasoned pork. I'll definitely try to figure out what this was and order it again.\n\nThere was also a spicy beef dish that was basically a soup. It was a little greasy for some, and way too spicy for others, but it was right up my alley.  With a good amount of rice to soak up some of the liquid, it was really good and definitely sated my spice lust for the evening. I had that great steady building-up of spice as opposed to a sharp biting spice. This would be a great dish on a cold day.\n\nI swear we had one more dish, but I can't remember what it was for the life of me.

I wonder where he sat when he dined there?  It's clean inside by Chinese restaurant standards.  The majority of diners weren't Chinese.  \n\nThe menu has your standard Chinese fare along with Beijing specials (warm pots, hot pots, dim sum, flour balls, and hand pulled noodles). The menu says they don't use MSG and that they have free delivery.  \n\n* Stirred flour balls with three flavors ($7.25).  The flour balls are tiny little chewy balls stir fried in a slightly sweet, soy based sauce with shrimp, a mild white fish and chicken (three flavors), zucchini, and frozen peas and carrots.  The balls are very hard to pick up.  There wasn't much meat.  The dish was interesting but hard to eat - probably wouldn't get it again.\n* Beijing beef pancake ($7.25): A must, but you need to eat it quickly. The outside is thin and crispy and the inside is stuffed with juicy ground beef.  If you let it sit, the pancake becomes soggy.  \n* West Lake lamb dumplings ($7.50): Very good boiled dumplings though not as good as Kingdom of Dumpling, juicy ground lamb in handmade thick wrappers.\n* Beef stew noodle soup:  The broth was too salty and not that beefy.  Good handpulled noodles though they're not as good as King of Noodle's.  \n* Hot braised beef tendon ($8.95): Served over a bed of bok choy, the braised tendon pieces were extremely tender - really good, even better than I expected and I've had plenty of tendon\n* Chicken with ground bean sheet ($7.25): A bit oily but very tasty stir fry of slippery wide, clear bean noodles with pieces of skinless chicken and topped with cilantro\n\nRemember to get the beef pancake and hot braised beef tendon.", "author": "Lolia S."}

I've seriously been here probably close to 30 times now, I feel like I should get some sort of mileage card from this place.  It's in the Excelsior neighborhood, and for some reason my fiance automatically thought it meant they served bad Chinese food.  Dude, just because it's not in freakin' Chinatown doesn't mean it's bad Chinese food!  Heck, even Yao Ming has been in here, and if that ain't a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is!\n\nSeriously though, I've never had a bad meal in this joint. The combination fried rice, the sweet and sour chicken, the chicken and corn soup, the sizzling rice soup, the nappa cabbage with pork dumplings, the 3-flavor house special vegetables, they're all fantabulous!  I will echo other reviewers though, and say that they could probably use a bigger space.  When the restaurant is packed, it can get pretty hot in there, and yet if it's cold outside, every time the door opens the entire restaurant feels the cold draft.\n\nBut, that's a small price to pay for not having to cook at home.

Out of everything, I enjoyed the appetizer the best (wide noodles mixed with bits of pork, cilantro, and finely chopped cucumber, jalapenos, red chili peppers, and egg).  The beef pancake had little flavor, I prefer Kingdom of Dumpling/King of Noodles' dumplings, I didn't care for the beef stew noodle (although the rest of my party really enjoyed it, especially the noodles), and the beef cumin was just really....odd (again, Chili Cheese Fritos).\n\nService was friendly, but I doubt I'll be returning anytime soon.

The interior of the restaurant was remodeled recently and is very clean inside. Service was surprising good for a Chinese restaurant. Dishes came flying out of the kitchen once we put in our order. At one point, they brought us the wrong dish and when we pointed it out, they immediately apologized, took it away and shortly afterward, brought out the correct dish. Servers were not only polite and attentive, but also seemed nice and happy. The restaurant is small and seating is limited. We made reservations and we had no issues with getting seated or finding parking in their adjacent lot, but I am not sure what the situation is like at other times. The food was good. My favorites of the night were their battered and fried fish fillets in sauce, egg surface tofu, and peking duck. In addition to serving the Northern style pancakes, hoisin sauce, and scallions with the peking duck, they also made a soup with the reserved duck and duck bones which was very good.

Not everyone in China eats rice, for instance. Away from the waterways, only the more affluent routinely eat rice. So the poor have to use something else. So they make flour balls as a substitute. \nTwo of our dishes were from potatoes, too.

Welcome to the neighborhood, Beijing Restaurant!\n\nUpdate 12/11/09:\n\nWent back for seconds and ordered the following for delivery:\n\nLg. Hot and Sour Soup\nBeijing Beef Pancake\nMu Shu Chicken\nBeijing Noodles in Special Sauce\nBeef with Green Onion\nNapa w/ Pork Dumpling\nCrab Cheese Puffs\nSteamed Rice\n\nTotal was $56 + change. Nothing particularly wowed us this time. The napa/pork dumpling is basically a pot sticker, maybe slightly smaller, but more to an order. Crab cheese puffs were pretty standard. Beef w/ green onion was basically mongolian beef without white onions.\n\nThe only truly \"new\" dishes that we ordered were therefore the mu shu chicken and the beijing noodles in special sauce. The former was pretty good, although a little light on chicken and heavy on cabbage and other filler. I did not enjoy the beijing noodles- the noodles themselves were OK but the sauce was overly salty. Basically, the dish consists of thick, udon-like noodles in salty brown sauce with bean sprouts, celery and eggplant. Seemed like kind of a rip for $7.25, the most expensive noodle dish on the menu. Not nearly as good as the chow fun.\n\nDelivery was pretty prompt at prime time  on Friday night but the delivery man claimed not to have change. Not a big deal but something to keep in mind in the future.\n\nEverything was pretty good except for the beijing noodles, which I wouldn't order again. Got to try to branch out a little more next time.", "author": "Brian H."}

The food is fantastic, the vibe inside is very relaxed and customer oriented with neon-backed photos on the walls, and a very friendly staff.  The one criticism I have to make, which almost took the review to 4 stars, is sometimes the staff can be a little slow and/or confused.  I have been here twice and both times we've had to do some extra waiting before getting service.  I've also seen other customers struggling with this as well, having to flag down a server to order.  I only really point this out because the place is so small that there shouldn't be tables that go forgotten; especially when the restaurant is only 3/4 full.  That being said, when they do get around to helping you it's fantastic, aside from the issue we had last time where our vegetables came out 10 or more minutes after our meat and noodles, again, another table was having the same problem.  \n\nI haven't branched out to the Beijing style dishes that a lot of people on here have been talking about but now that I've read the reviews next time I know what I have to order!  Thus far the sweet and sour shrimp (sorry for being a cliche whitie) is out of this world!  A light sweet red sauce on perfectly fried big shrimp with pineapple, onions, and green peppers.  The asparagus chicken was also perfectly cooked and delicious.  The chow mein extremely surprised me as it wasn't greasy AT ALL!  Packed full of flavor but not drenched in oil it was some of the best chinese noodles I have ever had.  The pot stickers were also good, but probably the least favorite of anything Ive had, but a killer deal!  $4.50 for 6 pot stickers is almost unheard of in the bay area, especially at the quality that they produce.  They were good, but I just prefer mine to be a little crispier with slightly thicker wrapper.  While we're talking about prices though - GODDAMN!!  SUCH fair prices!  One of the main things that will keep me coming back for more.  Pot stickers and 3 entrees for $27?  Yes!  Considering you get tea and water at no charge and that's what I usually go for in most situations, that's less than $35 out the door for an awesome and satisfying meal!\n\nI also want to note, and maybe this will further dampen my un-authentic food cred, that they have another delicious appetizer that is cream cheese and crab deep fried served with sweet and sour sauce.  Yes, it is americanized and unhealthy, BUT, it is amazing!

Beijing Restaurant.\n\nYes more NORTH than Shandong province. \n\nAnd I don't see any dumbed down Chinese or much in the way of other mixed regional Chinese on his menu either. \n\nThis mofo also does not use M$G or rely on sweet and spicy fried chicken to prove his salt to the ma$$e$. Some hardcore culinary kung fuud indeed.\n\nRE$PECT\n\nSF may have the legendary Old Mandarin Islamic on Vicente, but that's a niche of Northern Islamic Chinese (no pork) and you really only should go there for the hot pots and chin dribbling greasy beef pancake. \n\nBeijing Restaurant offers something that's more down home, less flashy (similar to Everyday Beijing in San Mateo) but truly hits da $pot.\n\nGet the \"warm pots\" (sa guo), which are actually super piping hot contrary to the translation. Think of them as lesser refined Northern Chinese \"nabemono\", but will surely do wonders. \n\nThe star of the warm pots is the key ingredient, sour/preserved/pickled napa cabbage (suan bai tsai). When paired with the right meats, it is an unbeatable combination that is perfect for cold weather. In NE China (dongbei), suan tsai bai rou (last 2 words = white meat = belly bacon = belly good) is probably the definitive comfort food. \n\nAt Beijing Restaurant, the highly recommended item from the warm pots selection is #27 \"Slice Fish with Preserved Vegetable in Warm Pot\" or really \"Suan Tsai Yu Pien Sa Guo\" which is an easy 5 stars (provided you are not put off by sour cabbage, it is as strong as the kind at Old Islamic Mandarin). The sour cabbage has the positive effect of cutting down the fat and oils from the fatty meats (especially the belly bacon) so you don't feel so dirty, yet it nurtures and soothes (and lubes) going down, while working its way through your convoluted inner pipes. The fish used in #27 is a type of cod, and is super delicious, poached to the right texture, retaining flavor and bite. These guys have it down. In addition to the sour green goodness and scrumptious fish, the application of mung bean wide noodles (fen pi) worked out way better than their thinner bean thread vermicelli counterparts (fen si) served in other sour cabbage pots, an excellent detail. Worthy of applause.\n\nIncredible in house hand made noodles, and an extremely well executed #91 beef noodle soup (the clear broth rendition), Tsing Tang Niu Rou Mien, where they actually properly stewed slices of beef shank with the criss cross cut tendon, and not using brisket cuts like other Northern or non-Canto joints in town. Even the clear broth was great. The beef stew noodles soup did look REALLY good, although that will be on the to-try next time.\n\nPork and cabbage dumplings.....sadly this is not their forte. The texture was good, but the content was overly marinated and seasoned, which no amount of white pepper or black vinegar could do much to help. This is where San Tung and Kingdom of Dumpling holds an edge. But in terms of noodles and \"warm pots\", this place is rockin'.\n\nThere is a newer and bigger 2nd location of Beijing Restaurant on Irving / 40th Ave, where you can advance order Peking Duck.

The waitress was perky, helpful, and just as friendly as can be.  And the food?  Superb.  As each dish came to the table, I struggled with the dichotomy of the impressive food quality versus the look of the building.  How can this be?\n\nThe explanation came quickly: \"We've been open for six months\".\n\nThis place deserves all the rave reviews it's been getting.  The prices are very fair, the cooking is superb, and the people are friendly and helpful.  And there's parking.  That's something I can't say about nearly any other Chinese restaurant in SF.

The food was flavorful and authentic, avoiding a lot of Americanizations. The decor is nothing remarkable, though it is a nice touch that the walls are adorned with past smiling customers. The staff is friendly and care about you enjoying your meal. The place is a little tiny, but you'll enjoy yourself the most with a group of friends since the joy of coming here (and all good Chinese restaurants) is the variety, crispy, soft, sour, spicy, salty, sweet, fried, steamed, etc.\n\nSome practicalities:  If you come here with just another friend, take a peek at the recommendations to settle on something, otherwise, the choices can become daunting. I always like to choose one thing familiar, and one thing I've never had before. Parking is not bad and it's easy to get to by bus.", "author": "Boris C."}

Beijing Restaurant is definitely a family run, mom and pop kind of place. \n\nI love the cumin lamb (requested extra spicy) for its tender lamb and strong cuminy spicy flavors. The house special pie is about an inch thick and stuffed full of ground meat and scallions. It's quite different than the run of the mill scallion pancake at other places, more filling too. I had heard great things about the house special eggplant and I love Thai/Vietnamese/Japanese/Chinese preparations of eggplant. That being said, it was a decent plate of eggplant but no better than other versions I have tried. The sweet brown sauce served with it was reminiscent of that served by many take-out type of places. \n\nThe waitstaff were really friendly and actually seemed to care if we enjoyed our food (a rarity at some Chinese places).

It was a warm day and my sister wanted Chinese style cold noodles. Restaurant supposed to be authentic Beijing style and Yao Ming known to frequent. Everything was pretty good. We ordered Beijing Cold Noodles, fresh hand-pulled noodles with just the right amount of chew to it served with julienned cucumbers in a sauce of chili oil, sweet soy, ground sesame sauce, and chopped fresh garlic. This dish was clean and simple. Many other places will add bits of meat or gunk into the sauce which takes away from the refreshing nature of cold noodles. This is the best cold noodle I have had. We also ordered the General's Chicken Wings which were lightly battered, crispy wings in a sweet and spicy sauce. Yum! We also had the beef pancake which was pretty good. To start, we had the spicy tripe and Hot and Sour Cucumbers. The spicy tripe looked bathed in chili oil, but the taste was off because it tasted like black peppercorns. The cucumbers were really good and were marinated in soy, vinegar, and chili oil. This vinaigrette went well with the tripe and as a dipping sauce for the beef pancake. We definitely will be back, but because of its location on Alemany just off of Mission, we won't be back until the next facial.

That goes for both the selection and flavor of the food, as well as the service. \n\nFirst the food: besides the cumin lamb that has been praised by many, I have to point out my favorite dish: Ga Da Tang, which is a soup made with droplets of dough, a bit like gnocchi, mixed with tomatoes, egg, and veggies. Not quite like congee, it's truly Northern-Chinese home-cooked goodness, which I have not seen in any restaurant outside of China. \nTheir pea sprouts were great and not too greasy, as was their Zha Jiang Mian, which is the equivalent of a Beijing version of pasta bolognese, of which we ended up ordering 3 huge bowls.\nTo our great surprise, they even had street food like Jian Bing, which is a egg pancake wrapped in a crispy layer and condiments, that is usually made by tricycle-riding street vendors in Beijing, as well as Rou Jia Mo, a hamburger-like bun stuffed with shredded meat and cilantro (though from ShanXi province originally, it has become a staple across China). \nThe dumplings were quite good, especially the skins, where you could tell were freshly hand-rolled. The lamb dumplings were my personal favorite (though not quite as good as at Kingdom of Dumplings in SF).\nWe also had two plates of Yu Xiang Rou Si (shreds of pork, carrots, bamboo shoots with fish sauce), which were legit, and a plate of home-style Tu Dou Si (shredded potato quick stir-fried) that came later in the meal, otherwise we would have ordered more.\nAlso noteworthy: they have old-Beijing style yogurt, which brought back childhood memories for many of us, and YanJing Beer, which they privately import directly from Beijing!\n\nIt's true that the place is small but last night, our group of 14 had an epic meal. Friends brought friends so we had to combine lots of tables into a long one that spanned the width of the restaurant. The waiters were surprisingly helpful and nice to accommodate more and more people, took our orders quickly, though we kept on adding more dishes one-off. Among our friends were several from Beijing or who had lived in Beijing at some point, so we happily conversed with the wait staff in Beijing-accented Mandarin and ended up making friends with the owner of the place, Mr. Jin, who showed us Beijing-style hospitality and introduced us to the chefs who are all family members.

My wife and I ordered four items:\n\n1) Beijing noodles with special sauce (Beijing zha jiang mian). I've had this in Beijing (where there are places that specialize in this one dish) and this is identical in style and pretty competitive in quality. As others have noted, the Beijing version of this is not quite the same flavor as Korean za zang noodles; the sauce is a bit saltier and has meat, and there are veggies to mix in as well. The noodles are freshly handmade and it's obvious from the texture.\n\n2) Beijing vegetable pie (jiu cai su hezi). Paper-thin pancakes wrapped around a filling of green onions, tofu, and some other vegetables. Beware: this contains dried shrimp, so if you're allergic, best to avoid it. But if you're not, you'll appreciate the rich savory flavor and the fact that, although it's obviously fried, it doesn't come out at all oily.\n\n3) Steam house special baozi (xiao long zheng bao). This was nothing too exceptional: it's a bun with a pork and vegetable meatball inside. They will warn you ahead of time not to expect a Shanghai-style xiao long bao (the kind with the paper-thin skin) -- this is a full-fledged bun. I may not sound super-enthusiastic but I'd probably order it again; it's a simple dish executed well.\n\n4) Spicy bean curd beef (lazi xiang gan niu rou). If you've had Hunan xiao chao, this is similar, strips of bean curd and slices of beef stir-fried together. But it also has strips of crunchy bell pepper and other vegetables that provide a more varied mouth feel. Despite the name it's not particularly spicy.\n\nAll in all, I'd definitely go back next time I was in that part of San Francisco with a hankering for Chinese food. Definitely reminds me of the food at the mom-and-pop places I like to frequent when I'm in China.", "author": "Steven G."}

Never asked for anything except extra napkins and the check.  \n\nFrom service to food, it was just a poor experience.  I'm really shocked.  I may disagree with some reviews but this was just crazy.  Authentic or not, it just wasn't a good meal.  Give it another try?  Only if someone else is flipping the bill ...", "author": "Angie C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-19", "description": "The place has been fixed up very nicely inside and out since Beijing Restaurant took over, and the food and value are a definite step up from the many other Chinese restaurants in the Excelsior. They do lunch specials 11-3, which are much more mainstream chinese options that you see everywhere and just fairly average quality, but you get a whole meal (spring roll, rice, soup) with very generous portions for $5.50.\n\nFor dinner or a la carte, the food is really fantastic. I am no expert on the different styles of Chinese cooking, but we've been trying out the menu and have definitely found some unique dishes. They also have a good number of vegetarian options, including a veggie mushu. And as others have said, the green onion pancakes are great!", "author": "Steve S."}

First off I am not Chinese. I am a huge fan of the people of the Excelsior. And I try to support the neighborhood restaurants as much as my stomach can handle. \n\nNow I am writing this for my Non- Asian neighbors. If you like the food from Yummy House or Excelsior Chinese, than this is not the place for you. If you enjoy a spirited game of WHAT'S THAT ?, than head for Beijing Restaurant. This is one those places that if you are from the region, than you will like it. The food is either overly salted or bland and mushy. If you are not Chinese and you go to the restaurant, good luck. The staff is somewhat friendly, but the disdain does present itself when you begin to ask questions about the menu items. \n\nIn all fairness, we did try this restaurant a few times and each experience was just as bad. Sometimes you just don't want your prawns looking back at you as you bite into it.", "author": "Steve G."}

We need good/clean restaurants in the area.\n\nMy first visit was take out.  I ordered traditional Beijing dishes.  I don't remember what because it was some time ago.  I do remember that I was disappointed by the lack of taste and poor representation of Beijing food.  My second visit was dine-in.  I was hoping that it would be better than take out.  Again I was disappointed for the same reasons.  My girlfriend is a fan of fried crab wontons.  I know it's white people food, but she's white so that makes it okay.  It came out looking like egg rolls, all rolled up.  We have NEVER had crab wontons rolled up like egg rolls.  We also ordered the Special Flour Ball with vegetables.  I could not believe my eyes when I saw canned peas & carrots and something diced up (flour ball) with a bit disced cucumbers.  Where are the flour balls?  It was awful!  We also ordered the Hunan Fish.  Again it was awful.  Imagine watered down Hunan sauce from a jar over fired fish that had been in a take out box for 30 min.  Yes, soft and saugy.   For desert we ordered the Fried Sweet Cake Beijing Style.  OMG, it wasn't cake at all.  It was fried sweet bun (like pork buns) with red bean paste inside over a bed of raw cabbage.  Yes, cabbage!  Who uses raw cabbage as garnish on a desert?  To make the dish sweeter they sprinkled plain sugar all over.    Needless to say we will not be back despite the glowing reviews here.  \n\nWhy people think a restaurant is good because Yao Ming eat there.  Yao Ming is NOT a chief nor a food blogger/writer.

I can't do anything for her which kills me!  Her stomach is upset, all the lights are off and I'm seating next to her trying to make her feel better.  She asks me to get her something light to eat like soup.  I suggest Won Ton Soup cuz there's plenty-O-Chinese food restaurants within blocks of our house.  She agrees saying it sounds good.  I call Beijing Restaurant because it's very close and has many and good reviews, takes credit cards and delivers however my wife can not eat shell fish!  When the gentleman answers the phone I ask if their Won Ton soup has shrimp in it.  It's not uncommon for the stuffing to contain shrimp.  The gentleman on the other end of the phone doesn't seem to understand what I am asking so he gets another person on the line.  I ask again and he says no, then I ask if he can deliver to which he replies no even though I know they do.  He gives me an excuse about it being busy and the delivery person is gone and won't be back for sometime. I explain that I am just around the corner but he still says no.  I decide that I can go get it and start to place an order.  He stops me in the middle of placing my order and asks me to call back in 10 minutes.

We've been twice in the last week and both times the food was wonderful and really interesting.  I should say my husband is Chinese and both of us are adventurous Asian food eaters, so we tend to know quality and authenticity when we find it.\n\nThe owners Sandy and Jin are two Beijing natives (by way of New Zealand) who are young, energetic, and very outgoing.  They are very excited about their food and eager to tell you about the special \"small food\" dishes  and hand-made noodles Jin's mother (who ran a restaurant in Beijing for 20 years) is making in the back alongside another trained chef.\n\nThe restaurant specializes in Beijing cuisine, only here, they mean it. The place is small (9 tables), occupying an unusual corner spot you may have never noticed before. There are dishes here you will rarely find in the bay area and everything we've had has been wonderful.  The first time, we had:\n\n* Cumin Lamb\n* House Special Pie--really a kind of turnover with wonderful pork and ginger\n* House Special Steamed Meatball--amazingly tender and delicious\n\nThe second time we had:\n* Warm Pot with fish-a kind of soup in a clay pot with tender slices of rock cod and preserved vegetable in a tasty broth\n* Beijing Beef Pie--fantastic\n* Beijing Style Noodles with Special Sauce-made with hand-pulled noodles you mix everything together with cucumber, been sprouts, and celery--a tad salty, but that might be Beijing style\n* We even tried dumplings with fennel! Apparently it's a Beijing favorite\n\nThe menu has lots of other interesting dishes on it, including flour ball dishes (meaning dishes with dumplings), and lots of Beijing specialties as well as many more traditional Chinese restaurant dishes.  They do a very inexpensive lunch as well.\n\nI hope Yelpers will check it out and help these guys get off the ground.", "author": "kathy s."}

After all, there are thousands of Chinese people in the City and I'm guessing many of them don't quite have the burdens of pro basketball to weigh them down in their production of great Chinese food.\n\nWell Yao, tip of the hat, well done, you are now famous in my book for your culinary sensibilities and not just your jump hook.\n\nTo make this review short, this is the best Chinese food I've had in the City.  You know, like me and at least 2 of my dining partners were like \"we're gonna take our parents here next time they visit the City!\" good.  You won't find greasy meat and veggies served up in a kiddie pool of sauce.  You'll find awesome flavorful dishes with the right amount of everything.  The Cumin Beef is highly recommended as are the hunan green beans.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, I'd order off the beaten path for the best experience.  Just about anything off of the Beijing Special list is golden.  Ever had flour balls?  Me either until I came to this place.  Give them a try!  If you find yourself still lost, ask the waitstaff.  Our waiter recommended the cashew shrimp and we got a delicious lightly glazed serving of shrimp and vegetables that tasted ridiculously fresh and was a nice compliment to the spicy dishes we ordered.\n\nAnother great part; the prices aren't too different from any other place in SF and the food is top notch.\n\nThe only possible drawback is that they do close at 9pm so make sure you're in early.", "author": "Steven R."}

The stir-fried flour balls had a firm, slightly chewy texture and were well seasoned without being overpowering.  The braised beef tendon was soft and chewy, with a rich brown sauce.  Only the black bean paste noodle (jia jiang mian) was not to my liking, as it was too salty.  We also ordered a dessert made from rice flour and red bean that was outstanding.  Although I am normally a fan of red bean paste, I found myself eating two pieces without even realizing it.\n\nAll of the food was made to order and tasted extremely fresh.

The meatballs are made from scratch and the vegetables are grown by the owners.  This is an exceptional (and very authentic) way to start a Beijing cuisine meal.  Just make sure you like white pepper because there's quite a bit of it and it makes your throat sear!\n- Beijing style gnocchi stir fried with meat.  This is equivalent to dough that's been chopped up into bits and stir fried with a meat of your choice.  Very tasty and a favorite among a lot of my friends who come here.\n- Zha jiang noodles.  Noodles are hand pulled so they're al dente and fresh.  Just make sure to use the sauce sparingly because it's quite concentrated and intense!\n- Beef pie or vegetable pie.

I would consider it pricier for Asian food, around ~30 per head after all is said and done.\n\nThey are known for their beef pankcakes, which I have to say are not bad. There non hotpot food is quite good as well.", "author": "Ho Yin C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-03-28", "description": "Great family-owned authentic Chinese food. Every time we go we try something new and are not disappointed. Although the place is kinda small, it's still a good place to go with a group and eat family style as Chinese food is meant to be enjoyed that way.\n\nThe service is always prompt and attentive as well. You can tell they are working hard to establish this new restaurant as one of San Francisco's best places for authentic Chinese food.\n\nThere's also a very convenient free parking lot. When approaching on Alemany from the south the lot will be on the right just before reaching the restaurant.", "author": "Bradley D."}

They are young and energetic and they will go far in this business.\n\nI mirrored my dish choices to what others here have recommended as signature dishes:\n\nBeijing noodles with special sauce\nCumin Lamb\nHouse Vegetable Combo\n\nThe lamb came first and it was notable that although this is a deep fried dish, there was an absence of oil pooling at the bottom of the dish. The lamb bits were just that: small irregular shards of lamb coated with spices and very unappealing. In fact it was salty. Forgettable.\n\nThe house vegi plate was good: steamed with a opaque sauce that was flavorful. Not unique however tasty.\n\nThe hand-pulled noodles came at last, and there is a little self-assembly process: vegetables are tossed in and the sauce is on the side with small bits of cured meat: pork?? It is dark soybean based. Not overpowering like a black bean sauce. It was...bland. I was sort of expecting something dynamic like a vietnamese garlic noodles, this dish fell way short of my expectations. At least they listened to the other reviews and it wasn't salty.\n\nOn the positives:\nThe prices were very good. The clientele looked to be locals. They have a parking lot! Service is friendly.\n\nIf there is a next time..I'll try their dim sum.", "author": "Rod A."}

Clean, attentive and informative service - and the food is AWESOME!  Hot and Sour soup is outstanding.  The house steamed meatballs are so good I ordered for a dinner party I threw - MAGIC.  The chicken with broccoli is GREAT.  Curry lamb is EXCELLENT.  Potstickers are very good.  The pancakes were good - but oily for me.  Like a flattened potsticker, pan fried ... just not my cup of tea.  I plan to sample more offerings ... when I don't go for the family favorite (steamed meatballs.)   Highly recommend this neighborhood favorite that can compete with ANY Chinese restaurant - it really is THAT good.  Sorry Henry Hunan - this is officially our favorite now!  5 stars is well deserved.", "author": "Patricia W."}

Although it does offer the regular Mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, combination fried rice, etc... , their specialty is the Beijing-style food!  Dishes I had are:  wide rice noodle salad (soo flavorful!  a little bit spicy!  delicious!), cumin lamb ( but then again, i love cumin with anything), Beijing beef pancake (basically a green onion pancake with beef in the middle.  i usually like my pancakes thin, but it's thick because of the meat so it's ok - very tasty), beef noodle soup ( the soup is very beefy/flavorful; the noodles were cooked just right - nice and chewy!  i wouldn't be surprised if they're homemade noodles!), lamb and pork dumplings (i like dumplings in general; these were good dumplings.  the lamb flavor wasn't very lamb-y), Beijing style meat ball ( i forgot what it's called on the menu; i think some people call it \"lion's head\"; that piece of meat was soo soft and packed full of flavor!  i'm pretty sure there was a lot of fat in it! oh well!  it's worth it!), and for dessert, we had the Beijing style fried sweet cake! (i'm not a big fan of red bean, but this piece of cake was deeeeeeeeelicious! it's basically red bean paste wrapped in deep-fried mochi.  it comes out crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. )", "author": "Soph I."}

The food is good, but, more worth the praise, OMG, the service was phenomenally good.  One never expects Chinese restaurant food servers to be attentive or polite, so it was a huge surprise.  I think Chinese food isn't the healthiest, but the food here was definitely tasty.  My niece, who is the pickiest Cantonese little eater (non-eater is more like it), eats most of the dishes here, so we'll be coming back.", "author": "JK S."}

I remember when it was nulite kitchen and before that it was fish and chips. Drove by at about 8, to try their wonton soup on a cold night but the restaurant was packed. So the following day ordered lunch special mongolian beef. Good taste and enough that i ate the rest for lunch. I like when the chiles are whole and you can break them up to your likin, very tasty. Second time i ordered the mushroom chicken, fresh mushrooms, no canned straw mushrooms here, very good. Now time to advance to eating in the restaurant. Not impressed. Order takeout, lunch special. Did like the chow fun, not so greasy", "author": "rick v."}

Great food, great prices, but not the best Beijing food I've ever had. As far as Mandarin food, they don't have much competition (Old Mandarin, Five Happiness). If you want to ask me how I rank them, I would still say 1) Old Mandarin, 2) Beijing Restaurant, 3) Five Happiness. On this cold winters night, we ordered a hot & sour soup (someone had a cold), pork pancake, stir fried green beans, lion's head meatballs, and beef noodle soup. All together not expensive...\n\n- Hot & Sour Soup - Delicious - and hit the craving for something with heat. Great for a cold! Not too goopy, fresh ingredients (well maybe not the bamboo shoot, but when has hot & sour soup ever had fresh and not canned bamboo shoot?)\n- Pork Pancake - Delicious, but probably even better there. We had it to go, so it was a bit soggy by the time we got home.\n- Stir Fried green beans - Good, not as good as Mandarin Islamic, but good. Deep fried (as usual) and stir fried in soy sauce.\n- Lion's Head Meatball - Really good, but not worth the price. I think it was something around $9-10 for 4 meatballs. Sorry I'll make it myself next time for 1/3 of the price.\n- Beef Noodle Soup - Yummy noodles - yes they make them fresh - I'm not sure these were my favorite homemade noodles, but they were good - something about the texture that I didn't LOVE (I did like it though). Soup was a bit disappointing - overall great, but the one we had that night it was clear that the meat hadn't been stewed in the soup for an incredibly long time as the flavor was not drenched into the beef and the soup lacked some soy sauce flavor - it was a bit watered down. I'd definitely try it again to see if it improves, but initially quite disappointing. Yes, Old Mandarin's was better this time around. \n\nOf course there can always be round 2.", "author": "Jeannette L."}

I'd definitely give it another try.", "author": "Sophia B."}
