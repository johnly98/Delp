Still have to feed minor child thanks to pesky laws that require me to keep her alive until age 18.\n\n*shakes fist*\n\nWent on Yelp and looked for Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean delivery options, because those are usually on the healthy side. Found De Afghanan Kabob House and ordered a lamb kabob plate, a beef kabob plate, a potato and garbanzo side order, and some plain yogurt. Also upgraded all the rice from plain to seasoned for a couple of dollars more.\n\nFood comes. I tell the minor child to divide the meat so that we both get some of each.\n\nA few minutes later I notice minor child Hoovering up rice and meat. I become alarmed...will there be anything left for ME?!\n\nI attempt to stall her by urging her to try the potato and garbanzo side. To appear legitimate, I try it myself. Holy mother-trucking heck...it's DELICIOUS! Spicy, tangy, and herby, with great textural variety between the soft potato and the firm garbanzos.\n\nWhile I'm doing my own Hoovering on that side dish, my tax deduction takes advantage of the distraction by opening the second dinner container and digging into MY portion of meat and rice. I remind myself that she's a growing human in a GOOD way (vertically), while I'm a growing human in a BAD way (horizontally), so I beg her to at least leave me half of the second plate. She takes mercy on me and finally backs away from the table. With what's left, I'm able to cobble together a somewhat decent dinner.\n\nWhile I wasn't able to amortize this delivery into a second day of meals, I'm still very pleased. The meat chunks were tender and smoky and nicely grilled, and both meats were of good quality. The potato and garbanzo salad was out of this world...I am so in love with it! Very glad that I ordered that extra side of it for tomorrow.\n\nFour stars = Yay! I'm a fan.", "author": "Valeria R."}

My friend ordered the Chicken Qorma plate, which is similar chicken pieces but in gravy, which he definitely enjoyed. My friend also got the firni dessert - rice pudding with rose water/pistachio flavoring.

This dish is fire!! Chicken kabobs are far too often dry and under flavored, but De Afghanan does not make this mistake. The meat was SO tender and flavorful (addictive lemony seasoning on top) and I know for sure I haven't had a chicken kabob in this city that can beat it. It came with rice, about 5-6 good sized pieces of chicken, and some mixed cucumber. Top it off with some unbeatable homemade green chutney they give on the side and you have yourself a winning dish. They also provide a free side of Afghani bread to dip into the chutneys and that was buttered well and fresh tasting. \n\nHead over here to get some amazingly flavorful kabobs, not to mention perfectly cooked :).", "author": "Sabina S."}

I came here for lunch and got the following items:\n\n1) Bolani - this was really delicious.  It's like a pancake filled with potato and scallion served with a yogurt sauce.  It reminds me of Indian dolsa.  They also bring over an Indian green chutney which I also used on it. This is a pretty large dish; I would be surprised if a group less than 4 people finished it. If you do decide to get it expect to take the unfinished portions home, it'll be hard to take the dipping sauces home without spilling and the pancake doesn't keep well. It gets soggy. You can try pan frying it which might help. \n\n2) Triple kabob - chaplee and beef were delicious.  The chicken was good. The chaplee comes in like a patty of hamburger-like meat mixed with vegetables and spices.  It was mildly spicy and delicious. The beef was also delicious. The chicken reminded me of chicken tandoori.  I liked using the green chutney on it also.  \n\nOverall, the food was like a mix of persian food with indian food. The kebob and rice felt persian while the dolsa like bolani, green chutney and chicken tandoori like kebab felt Indian.  I don't have other Afghani places to compare this too but I liked the foot here and would definitely recommend it. \n\nTL/DR: The food is like a mix of persian and indian foods.

It can feed 2-3 people. \nCrispy on the outside without it being awfully oily. The filling has a hint of sourness (good sour, like somewhat tangy).\nThe chicken Qorma is typical of middle eastern dish/stew, in which it uses a lot of spice, but milder than most middle eastern dishes I've tasted. It's savory and somewhat sweet with a silky texture (easy to go down). Even better when it coupled with that green sauce on the table.\nI say it was definitely a good first time.", "author": "Jenny T."}

I'm embarrassed to say that I was completely unfamiliar with Afghan food prior to this experience and I know now that I was definitely missing something. We had several dishes and they were all fantastic. \nThe Qabili (braised lamb shank) was amazingly tender and served with basmati rice which was studded with raisins and julienned carrot. The Bolani (a bread stuffed with potatoes) was easily my husband's favorite and came with a perfect yogurt dipping sauce. We also ordered the Triple Kabob plate and had no complaints there either. The chicken breast and tri tip were super tender and flavorful but the star of that plate was the chaplee, a spicy ground sirloin patty. The chaplee isn't for the kiddies due to the spiciness but my husband and I loved it. \nAnyone in San Francisco needs to check this place out. It's a family run restaurant with real pride in their food and it shows. This meal was definitely my favorite in a two week stint of trying everything we can in the city.", "author": "Jacqui N."}

This place is very unassuming and quiet. The food is on point. We had a late lunch when we went for dinner, so we just split a few things. We initially wanted to order delivery and stay in- but they don't deliver everything that is offered at restaurant- dogh OR bolani- so we had to get over there. We had a bit of a wait (about 15 minutes- the place is small), but food came fairly quickly. Highly recommend the cool dogh (yogurt drink with cucumber and mint), the potato bolani (you will prob have leftovers and they are delicious all the same) with a thick yogurt dipping sauce and green and red chutneys similar to (but not the same as) Indian chutneys. My husband and I also split the lamb plate that comes with two different kinds of rice, huge chunks of lamb, and a small salad with tiny diced cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. So good!!!

I ordered the Combination Kabob which came with tekka beef and chicken kabobs \"charboiled to perfection\". At first, I was extremely skeptical because there are so many hyped up restaurants in SF. But, seriously- it was perfection. The tekka beef (marinated tri beef) had a wonderful smoky flavor  and was cooked perfectly. The chicken was tender boneless chicken breast that was moist and juicy. It came with a bed of rice and a small tomato, cucumber rice. There were also two hot sauces, and I liked the green cilantro one alot! \n\nI loved the complimentary Shor Nakod and flat bread. The Shor Nakod was a wonderful mixture of garbanzo beans and potatoes in this green, citrusy sauce. It was a refreshing way to contrast all the meat we were eating. \n\nThe restaurant can get a bit crowded at times, so I recommend coming early.

I barely needed to cut my beef and chicken!!!\n\nWe also had the eggplant appetizer which is incredible. You must get that even if you think you don't like eggplant!! You won't regret it. Paired with the soft, fluffy, and chewy bread they bring out, the texture and flavor combination is fantastic.\n\nThe second dish we shared was the dumpling on their specialty menu. Everyone loved it. The only confusion I had with it was that the meat definitely tasted like lamb instead of the advertised ground beef. Anyway, still great but just unexpected.\n\nThe sheer chai was also great, although slightly overpriced for what's basically hot milk tea with spices. That being said, it was really well done, so while I probably wouldn't get it again, I'm glad I did this time.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I split the triple combination. Everything was delicious. We didn't notice that Chapli/Chaplee is spicy, so be wary of that! Definitely not unbearable, but it clears the nose.\n\nLast but not least, it was my future father in law's birthday so when they heard that, they brought out a dessert on the house! It was so good - floral, light, creamy, and sweet but not too sweet.", "author": "Mio W."}

We had heard the hype and decided to see for ourselves. The place is small (only around ten small tables or so), and the let us know that the wait would be around an hour. I think it was well worth the wait, and my friends thought so too.\n\nFood was amazing! We ordered the Borani Kadoo (pumpkin appetizer) and Mantoo (meat dumplings) to start. The pumpkin was so good, it pretty much melted in your mouth. A must try. For entrees, we shared the Chicken Qorma (curry) and Triple Kebab (tekka beef, chicken, and chaplee). The curry was a little spicy for me, but I ordered the Dogh (yogurt drink), which cut through the spice very well. The meat in the kebab combo was super tender and juicy, not dried out at all. If you try anything here, that Sheer Yakh (Afghan ice cream) is to die for! We also ordered the Firni (milk pudding), which was delicious as well. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but I couldn't get enough of their desserts.\n\nAs I mentioned, the inside is very small and it's a bit tight if you're standing there waiting. My friend also noted that the American flag was hung the wrong way according to flag rules. Minor details. Service was mediocre throughout the meal. For example, they took a while with the drinks and they were not very attentive. I think some people got complimentary bread, but our table didn't.

Ordered a kabob and lamb shank. Kabob came out first and we were almost done eating it and the lamb shank still hadn't arrived.\n\nThree lamb shanks then arrive at the table behind us who had sat down and ordered about 10 minutes after us. Server then comes over and says they ran out of lamb shanks and would we want anything else. I ask how they ran out when we ordered first yet the table behind us somehow got 3 a second ago? He then back pedals and says they ordered a third one last minute and he accidentally gave them the last one instead of us so its his fault.\n\nNo apology or offer to comp us a different dish. I just shook my head and said no I didn't want anything else, I had wanted to try that dish. He then goes back to the other table and basically grabs one of the lamb shanks and tries to give it to me but it had been sitting on their table. I refuse and then he brings it back to their table. \n\nReally bad service and I'm pretty sure this violates health code. Earlier in the meal he had dropped two kabobs at another table and the chef asks him if it was table 5. He goes back and checks the ticket, realizes his mistake and then removes the plates and takes them to the right table! \n\nThis was our second visit and had liked the food here but with service like this not planning to return.

The chicken Kabob is probably as good as it gets and is definitely deserving of a \"WooHoo!\".\n\nBefore I digress, I just want to say that it was one of the best chicken kabobs I've had ever had (bar none); soft and succulent, it was simply bursting with flavors! The seasoning was just right and you can tell that it was marinated for quite a while, and cooked quickly on high heat (for it to be so juicy). The green cilantro/pepper based sauce/chutney compimented the kabobs perfectly. The sides included aromatic long-grained rice, seasoned and cooked perfectly, in two different styles (or maybe one was brown rice, and the other white; I couldn't tell). The shirazi, or the eastern version of a pico-de-gallo made a perfect match for the rice and the juicy hunks of chicken.\n\nWe did, however, start with the Bolani. A flat bread that was stuffed with, in our case, potatoes and leek, served with a yogurt dip. I loved it! It was similar to an Indian \"Alu Paratha\" and I happen to love the alu paratha. As you could tell, that dish was a carb-country-fare on a plate. The bread was a little crunchy and a little flaky without being as leavened as a puff pastry (but tending towards that very slightly), with the soft steaming moist stuffing; dunking it in the seasoned yogurt, it was magic in my mouth!\n\nI also tried a bite of the dumplings and they were *really* very delicious too. But having tasted the kabobs, I'd be hard pressed to order dumplings instead; but I'd be willing to, nay, love to, split a plate of kabob and a plate of dumplings with a dining companion --- if only I can fool them into not diving headlong for the kabobs.\n\nI had a glass of the \"Dogh\", a savoury yogurt drink that was seasoned. It is akin to an Indian \"salt\" lassi; but I'd venture so far as to say that it is very close to a \"Butter Milk\". I love butter milk. But it may not be for everyone.\n\nNext time, I wanna try the \"sheer yakh\" ice-cream. \n\nAt $61 for the Bolani appetizer, three entrees, and two drinks, the check for $61 (+ tips) was pretty reasonable.\n\nI will be back.", "author": "Umesh T."}

Enough protein for days, all three chunks of chicken, three chunks of teka beef and two chaplee beef patties were very well marinated and cooked. The meat was incredibly tender and insanely flavorful with a nice herbaceousness. Even the chicken breast was as tender as perky boobies. The teka beef was my fav of the trio because the flavor was explosive and the meat melted in my mouth like a fine steak from a high-end steakhouse. \n\nAll platters are served with rice, salad, and warm Afghani bread. The combo platter, however, was served with both Challow and Pallow which were addictingly good. Challow is (white) rice with cumin seed and canola oil. Pallow is (brown) rice with cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper, cumin and canola oil. If you're going to indulge in carbs, this is the way to do it--with tasty, aromatic rice. \n\nDon't be fooled by that mountain of orange rice in the Quabili Pallow ($13.99) because underneath all those carblicious carbs was an incredibly tender lamb shank: http://bit.ly/1fmmb7W. Loved the addition of raisins and carrots for a sweet crunch.\n\nEven though we had enough leftovers for another couple, I had to try the Sheer Yakh: Afghan ice cream ($6): http://bit.ly/1fmmgbR. The vanilla ice cream with the rose water and cardamom was really refreshing and helped cool our palate from the complimentary Shornakhod: garbanzo beans and potatoes in tangy chutney sauce: http://bit.ly/1ez285n.\n\nService was pleasant and the food service was pretty prompt considering there were only two staff on the premises at the time. \n\nThere's only 6 four-tops and 1 two-top table so the restaurant is good for small parties only: http://bit.ly/1gzALfR.

If I could give them ZERO stars, I would!! After a long and tiring day in the city, my family was craving some really good Afghan food. We've eaten at the Fremont restaurant before (Don't know if these locations are related), so we were excited to discover another location in the city. My husband and brother in law dropped my sister and I off at the restaurant, along with my two children, to find parking. We walked in and told the waiter/owner (whoever he was) that we were a party of six. The restaurant was on the smaller side and was a seat yourself, but we wanted to see if he could help us figure out seating.  He told us right away that he didn't have space for us to sit together, randomly proceeds to tell us that they were out of \"Bolani,\" even though we didn't even ask him anything about the menu yet. And then tells us that maybe we should go somewhere else and gives us a name of a different restaurant. We thought his comments were weird (as who tells a customer to check out another restaurant- most owners are courteous and friendly and would try to make arrangements). We decided not to take offense and sat down at the open table, figuring seating will eventually work out. We were hungry, it was late, plus we were looking forward to eating there all day. Luckily a table for two opens behind us, and we decided we would just split our party to sit separately between these two tables. A few minutes later another family walks in. The owner quickly comes up to us, tells us to \"get up\" and that he is giving our table to the other family. We asked him why (since we were there first and already seated) and if the other family had reservations. He told us that he doesn't do reservations but he \"had the right to refuse service to anyone he wants and that he does not want to serve us.\" The other family looked embarrassed and upon realizing what was happening offered to sit somewhere else, but the owner insisted they take our seats. He basically kicked my sister and I, along with my two children, without any explanation and humiliated us in front of a full restaurant. We were so shocked and never experienced anything like this before. Who asks seated customers to leave, especially when there were no issues with us.  We didn't know why he did this as we had no issues with him. It seemed like he wanted us out as soon as we got there. Our husbands hadn't arrived yet from parking so we were forced to wait outside in the dark, with two children in an area that we were not familiar with. What a rude and shameless person he was. Who kicks women with children out in the dark without any reason?? He obviously lacks customer service skills, lacks passion for his business and doesn't care about his customers. My husband finally arrives and we explained what happened. He went inside to politely speak to the man and the guy had no explanation, except that \"he had the right to refuse service to anyone.\" Of course he had nothing to say, no reason, no apology, as we gave him no reason to do this to us. He's either racist or lacks complete professional skills to run a business. I do not recommend this place to anyone. He said he's related to the Fremont location, which is such a bummer. We should've realized from the start that he didn't want us there and saved ourselves the waste of time.

Imagine my surprise when they picked up and closed shop in Berkeley and relocated in SF, down the street from my house. Ecstatic, was the word. \n\nThe food was pretty good, and fairly cheap. I ordered the Borani (more on this), Triple Kabob, Combination Kabob, Quabili Polo and Firni.  The Triple and Combo Come with a lamb, chicken, chaplee and chopan kabob, so we had a chance to have everything. The food is great. But I ended up having a little trouble with the borani. Online, its a pumpkin dish, which isn't bad I assume, but I wanted potato. So we called and got potato instead of pumpkin. Mind you, it isn't anywhere on the delivery menu, but you CAN order potato leek Bolani if you call the restaurant. In fact, I think most things are available for delivery, but NOT on the delivery menu. Call the restaurant to confirm. \n\nCan I just say the Firni was SO YUMMY!? It's a rice pudding with rose water, sprinkled with cardamom and pistachio over the top. It was soooo good, I might go there just for dessert some time. \n\nIn short, good food, good prices, albeit, confusing ordering process.

Quite simply there's at any point two or more tables ready to pay but no one approaches them until the wait line becomes unbearable.

No, the fairly spartan ambiance is in line with its Tenderloin location, including the door that couldn't remain shut after you close it. But the food pictured in the laminated menu looked appetizing and our inhibitions subsided.\n\nWe first received our bread basket of Bolani, a native flatbread freckled with sesame seeds (photo: http://bit.ly/1hWWxgS) along with a tasty dip that mixed chickpeas and diced cucumbers in a green sauce that I'm guessing was made from cilantro (photo: http://bit.ly/1hW2REg). Already on the table were jars of spicy and mild sauces that we also applied to the bolani (photo: http://bit.ly/1jT7Jth). I think the appetizer that came next was my favorite dish of the evening, the $6.99 Barani Kado, chunks of saut\u00e9ed pumpkin seasoned in garlic and pepper with mint and a drizzle of homemade yogurt on the top (photo: http://bit.ly/1gISAHf). It was a nice combination of savory and sweet with the pumpkin providing just the right texture for a most enjoyable consumption. Jamie W. ordered the $16.99 Lamb Kabob, six big chunks perfectly tender from the grill accompanied by two different rices and a fresh side of chopped tomato, onion and cilantro (photo: http://bit.ly/1ljroGx).\n\nThat was quite satisfying, but I ordered their Triple Kabob for the same price. I got a combination of chicken, tekka beef and chaplee  This appeared to be the better deal for the insatiable appetite since I received three large chunks of the chicken, three of the beef, the same sides and a hefty ground sirloin patty mixed with scallions and crushed red pepper (photo: http://bit.ly/1jhKDJT). The chicken was surprisingly moist and the beef was juicy, all of it quite tender and well marinated. But the standout was the chaplee because of the mix of seasonings mixed inside the meat. It was especially good with the table sauces. The server was quite cordial and informative about the dishes. She appeared to be the only one serving all the tables. It was really good eating, and I wouldn't hesitate to come back for more of that pumpkin. Maybe Afghan food is the breakout foodie fad, but what do I know?\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...succulent kabobs, but it's the Barani Kado that stays in this glutton's memory\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...not much of it but it's clean\nSERVICE - 4 stars...terrific server really showed off the food with pride\nTOTAL - 4 stars...a strong four stars for this Afghan outpost of a popular South Bay chain", "author": "Ed U."}

Heard great things about the food, though when I got take out and had a view of the kitchen, I was not super impressed.

Take out was super slow, even though everything I ordered was tossed into the microwave, and I called 10 minutes in advance.  \n\nThe food was good, and I am trying to put my anti-microwaving feelings aside, since I think this is probably a common practice, that I just saw here in person due to the smallness of the space.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

The place is not tiny, but not giant either.  If you come at peak hours, you'll be standing around waiting, so it's up to you whether you want to wait inside or outside - they could be doing a better job providing seating considering the number of people waiting when we left.  With one server taking care of everyone, service was also a bit slow.  \n\nOur food was good, with one mistake.  We ordered the Bolani as an appetizer (Leek & potato-filled pastries) but received the Kado Borani (Roasted squash topped with garlic yogurt in a flat bread) instead.  This was disappointing as we didn't really enjoy the Borani.  The squash was in large shavings and the taste was just bland - we both agreed it would have been better pureed and baked as a bread filling.  The entrees we ordered were the Bodinjon Borani (eggplant) and the Lamb Kabob - both were pretty good.  The 6 chunks of lamb I got were juicy and had a good amount of flavor on its own, and the fresh pepper/cilantro sauces on the side were a nice addition.  It was $17 for the 6 chunks of lamb, and I typically eat about 1/4 of my rice.  Of what I had, the rice was cooked well, but not exceptional.  We had to ask for the complimentary flatbread on the side - it came with our dish, but the server was too busy and overlooked it.  \n\nIf these hole-in-the-wall restaurants just added one more server, service would turn from subpar to exemplary and everyone would leave happy.  As it is, the food was good, but we did a whole bunch of waiting around eating it AND paying for it.  3.5 star experience and I'm looking forward to comparing it with the other Afghani place nearby.", "author": "Ben K."}

Bolani reminds me of naan but with potato filling accompanied by white yogurt sauce.  It's a great appetizer dish but for our case, it went rather well with the alcohol in our stomachs.\n\nFor mains, we shared the lamb kebob and the chicken, beef, and chaplee combo.  Let me start by saying how great the rice are.  There's two different types: white and brown.  While I cannot tell the difference, I can say that the rice were not oily like other restaurants.

I like mine done medium rare. The kebobs are juicy, perfectly seasoned, and taste wonderfully beefy.

Great stuff.  \n\nNext came my chicken, beef, chapli triple combination kabob plate.  Accompanying the perfectly prepared meats were white and brown rice, the latter tasting of cinnamon, a small well-seasoned salad, and some wonderfully crisp bread.  This plate was a complete meal for me; it had everything you could want and for under seventeen bucks it is a near-steal.

After an enjoyable movie around the corner at the AMC, at 6:30pm on a Saturday night, we indulged in the dishes praised by other 5-star rating customers.  Dishes were indeed 'not greasy or overly seasoned..'  Hey, do go for the pumpkin bolani appetizer & the tri-tip kabob, w/ homemade yogurt.  Ditto the well prepared specialty entrees. Baklava dessert was nicely light & warm.  Our pleasant, courteous waiter assumed a museum docent role for a few minutes & provided us with a historical & cultural orientation to themes in a painting of Afghan life & sports.

The food was pretty damn good. It wasn't spicy hot but was very flavorful. I got the vegetarian eggplant and peppers in a tomato sauce drizzled  with yogurt and mint. It came with basmati rice and Afghan bread. I ordered an appetizer called Bolani. It's like a tortilla filled with potatoes and leeks and it is served with yogurt and mint too. On the table was a little dish with some mint chutney very similar to Indian mint chutney that I ate with everything. It was very very good. I used the Afghan bread to sop up all the sauce and practically licked the plate clean. \n\nThe restaurant is very unassuming. Without the sign outside you wouldn't even know it was there. It's small but cozy and the lady who helped me was very sweet. There was a noisy group in there eating in the corner and it was interesting to eves drop on the one girl who used to be a vegetarian even though she hates most things vegetarians love like cheese and avocado. She eventually became anemic and went back to eating meat. She didn't even know why she tried being a vegetarian when she hates most vegetarian staples. \n\nI would definitely eat here again. The prices for the portion size are a little high but when you're traveling in San Francisco you expect to pay a little more. I wouldn't go out of my way but if you are in the area it's a very good option and very different from all the sushi in the area.", "author": "Dustin S."}

Today I came here enticed by the idea of Afghani food, a cuisine I am not familiar with. There were a selection of appetizers including bolani, sabzi, and borani badenjan or kadoo. They had a number of enticing kabobs on the menu from beef to chicken to lamb. Their vegetarian option was badenjan challow, a saut\u00e9ed eggplant with tomatoes, garlic, and peppers. I went with one of their specialty dishes, the chicken qorma: seasoned boneless chicken with tomatoes, saut\u00e9ed onions, garlic, split peas, and spices. It was served with basmati rice and afghani bread. With the sides it made for a very filling meal and was very delicious. The chicken was tender and the spices were just right and not overpowering. The bread was really good and was great to dip in the extra sauce. They had a variety of afghani drinks as well, but I just went with water this time... There was so much food, I was already full. The service came from a young girl who was very polite and I feel like it might have been a family operation and she was related. It had a very homey feel to the place and was very intimate.

The Borani Bademjan - eggplant sauteed with fresh tomatoes, garlic and peppers topped with our homemade yogurt. that is served with afghan bread - was pretty phenomenal. It came out piping hot and redolent. The shornakhed that I was given as an amuse- a salad made of  garbanzo beans and potatoes with fresh herbs and spices - was also really delicious. I have to say their vegetarian options are topnotch. I wasn't too crazy about my teka beef kabob because It had a funky texture, and my chicken kabob was dry. Still, the marinade on the meat was good and the rice was tasty. The flavors were all authentic. The server, who is part of the family that runs this place, was really nice and the prices are very reasonable. It was a 4.5 out of 5 star dining experience for me.

I'd describe as a Mexican Quesadilla, but instead of a flour tortilla it's a delicious pastry and instead of sour cream it's served with yogurt and cilantro chutney!  Deeeeeee-lish.  They also have hot sauce on be table which adds some serious heat to the dish if you so desire.  Their dishes are also served with a side dish, sometimes it's like a pico de gallo and other times I've been served a potato salad, which is so savory and acidic, you have to taste it to understand, divine!

The decor was plain and simple but stayed true to the cuisine of the restaurant. We got the bolani which is like potato bread of some sort that you pair with a yogurt sauce which is on the tart side. I usually like it and I did here. Very savory dish and a great way to start the meal. Be careful not to eat too much or else you'll get full and wont' want to eat anything else. We then got borani which I think is what it was which is like a ravioli. It was okay but it was the same yogurt sauce and the meat had a little too much spice which was overpowering. We then got a mixed kebab plate and sometimes when you order chicken kabob it is dry, but not here. That's how you can usually gauge how well the other kabobs were cooked. If you can do chicken right, chances are you can get the other meats right too. They did and I was so happy. Moist, tender cuts of meat over rice with salad, I was scarfing everything. No leftovers for us. It's a nice little addition to the neighborhood. Check it out.", "author": "Jeromy G."}

Primed and ready, I ordered the lamb kabob for takeout but was told they had just ran out. An Afghan place running out of lamb meat seemed pretty strange, like a taqueria running out of beans and tortillas, but I grudgingly went with chicken. For whatever reason they gave me beef, which turned out to be a fortunate mistake because it was delicious! My meal was packed with rice, meat, bread, sauces and an amazingly delicious side of chic peas. More than enough for lunch, I was stuffed, drowsy, and thoroughly unproductive the remainder of the day.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-05-01", "description": "First, let me stipulate that the other reviews of De Afghanan Kabob House are accurate.\n\nThe place itself is a standard mom and pop ethnic restaurant, a little cleaner than usual, better ventilation, but standard nonetheless.\n\nThe food is undeniably tasty. I had the triple kabob, the spinach entree, and a cup of chai. Is it authentic? I wouldn't know.\n\nSo, why am I rating De Afghanan Kabob House a lowly three? In a word, the pricing.\n\nThe pricing formula is remarkably straightforward. The owners start with a price which is pushing the edge of reasonable and then add a 50% markup.\n\nThe \"chai\" was a teabag and some water -- for $3.50. Over the last few years, the San Francisco buying public has gotten used to paying the inflated price of $2.50 for a teabag. Think for a minute of what the profit margin is for a teabag.\n\nThe amount of spinach was reasonable -- for $6.99. It was priced at $9.99. \n\nThe triple kabob was a fair amount of food. Two not very hungry friends could split it, along with the spinach and be satisfied. $13.99? Maybe. But no, it was $16.99.\n\nYou have to give it up to the owners of De Afghanan Kabob House. They are nothing if not consistent.\n\nWhy is De Afghanan Kabob House so pricey? Is it the greed of the owners, the greed of the landlord, or both? In defense of the owners, I should note that with rents for a one bedroom hitting $3000 as of this writing, I would bet a shiny quarter (what with inflation) that commercial rents are just as asinine. Maybe the owners of De Afghanan Kabob House are forced by market conditions to charge these insane prices.\n\nAll I know is the food, as good as it is, is curdling in my stomach as I write this.", "author": "Michael K."}

It comes with about eight good sized pieces of lamb that are really tender and juicy, which is what I loved the most because alot of other Afghan restaurants that I have been to always overcook theirs.  It also comes with two sides of rice and some diced onions and tomatoes. The place is small, but the food and service are great, which makes this establishment a must visit.

After a long wait, we got our food.  The food was, as usual, delicious.  But, we then had to wait 30/40 minutes for him to run our credit card.  He only did it when we physically got up and stood over him to get him to run our cards so we could leave.  Extremely frustrating experience and beyond poor service.  \n\nDespite the amazing food, I won't be able to go back due to the bad experiences with this waiter.", "author": "N B."}

Then the bolani smelt uncooked like I could still smell the raw dough I wouldn't recommend this place at all especially with family's. The one in Fremont Ca is way better, better food better service", "author": "Aisha B."}

But growing up and living in Fremont the famous De Afghanan is the only place I do like to go...My co-workers love Afghan food and told me that they saw this place and tried it and were really impressed.  I looked at the menu and sure enough it was De Afghanan. \n\n I recently went with my co-worker to try it out being I work in SF and it is definitely the same DELICIOUS food that Fremont has.  \n\nThe waitress was super nice, very hospitable and explained that the one in Fremont is owned by her uncle.  We got the bolani and the triple combo plate so my friend could try the chapli kabob, the beef kabob and the chicken kabab.  It came with brown(paloe) and white rice along with the signature bread...It was sooooo good....every bite was amazing.  The place was very clean and the food definitely amazing...There was no wait and we got our food super fast.\n\nCant wait to go back with more friends from work. \n\nTry this place you wont be disappointed for the best afghan kabobs- perfection.", "author": "My M."}

Finally they are in sf now! Highly recommended. Fantastic food, we ordered bolani for appetizer and got chaplee kaboob and chicken kaboob. All of them were off the hook.

I ended up getting a type of beef kabob and let me tell you.. It was the juiciest, most tender meat kabob. I ate absolutely everything. They offer a lot for such a small place. They are clean and really friendly. I definitely advise everyone to try this place out!", "author": "Justin N."}

The flavors are great.  The combo gets you the chicken, beef, and chaplee. Love the chaplee. And add the desert - a little bit of sweet without being too heavy.  The firni is my favorite. I wish I could visit more often!   The staff is very friendly too!", "author": "Jon C."}

This restaurant may be a brushed-up hole in the wall, the decor may be quite cheesy, but the food is absolutely awesome and this is what matters. I had Triple Kabob. The Chaplee kabob was OK, not very distinctive taste; the beef kabob was nice and the chicken kabob was absolutely awesome. All three well tasty, chicken was exceptionally well done and juicy, each kabob had its own distinctive taste, nothing like one-fits-all BBQ seasoning. The dish includes two salads (great for breaking the heaviness of the meat) two kinds of rice (which, again, has its flavour, it is not just rice) and bread which goes great with complimentary chutneys (cilantro chutney and chilli chutney). I also recommend Dogh -- a drink of savoury yoghurt, ice, cucumber and spices -- goes great with meat. The establishment has a TV set, personally I don't like it, but it is possible to sit so that it is not in your field of vision. All in all highly recommended!", "author": "Grzegorz J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-09", "description": "Nice and small place and perfect for those who would like to be introduced to middle eastern food. Authentic and with a twist of fusion presentations. Mantu was authentic although the yogurt wasn't as sour as I had wanted it to be. They probably didn't ferment it long enough to give it a tart sour taste. But it was still tasty. And I'm assuming the herbs weren't as strong since this little hole in the wall accommodates a variety of different people eating here. For example I noticed the little jar of hot sauce on the table which would accommodate the Asian and Mexican customers and to those who likes spicy food. But the hot pepper sauce is definitely an Asian sauce. That was very nice of them, although I couldn't imagine eating this sauce w the wonderful food they serve. Also the dishes were served with a side of picante look instead of larger sliced tomatoes and cucumbers which I'm accustomed to when eating afghan food. The restaurant is clean with nice people so I give it a 4star for an overall rating.", "author": "Joy J."}

The flavoring of the meat was okay, but nothing special and the beef and the chicken were both dry, which really ruined them for me.  You also don't get very much meat, as you can see from the pictures.  The prices are nothing to write home about; you could get the same or lower prices for equivalent food in nearby restaurants instead of this six-table joint.  There are no lunch specials.  There was just nothing I really liked about my meal here and there are better Middle Eastern restaurants in the area.  I won't come back.", "author": "John M."}

I have eaten here more times than any other restaurant, which is why it is my first yelp review. The lady that works at the front counter, who i believe is also the owner, is the sweetest! She knows my order and my husbands order as soon as we walk in. I usually get the eggplant dish and the chicken platter with the kabuli and my husband gets the triple kabob plate well done and mild. They get it right every time! This place has never had an off day. For desert, try the baklava warmed up. It's perfection. The Berkeley location was perfect for me because it was so close but I guess i'll be driving to SF for my afghan food fix from now on!", "author": "Charlotte W."}
